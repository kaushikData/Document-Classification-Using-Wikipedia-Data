      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3500">The 33rd [[Cuban National Series]] saw further dominance from the previous year's group winners: [[Pinar del Río (baseball team)|Pinar del Río]], [[Industriales]], [[Villa Clara (baseball team)|Villa Clara]] and [[Santiago de Cuba (baseball team)|Santiago de Cuba]]. Among them, only Pinar del Río won its group by fewer than seven games, in a 65-game season.

After winning their semifinal series, Villa Clara and Industriales fought to a seventh and deciding game. Villa Clara ultimately won, after Jorge Fumero knocked in [[Ariel Pestano]] for the game's winning run.

The '''1–3–1 defense and offense''' is a popular strategy used in [[basketball]].[[Image:ZONE1-3-1.jpg|thumb|Typical 1-3-1 Formation]]

The 1-3-1 zone defense is a defensive basketball formation. It was originally utilized by legendary basketball coach, Red Sarachek. This defense is named for its formation since there is one defender at the point, three defenders at the free throw level, and one defender at the base line. The main focus of this defensive strategy is to force turnovers. This is done by using quick, pestering defense and anticipating any passes to attempt a steal. A two-man trap is implemented in this defense. The defense attempts to guide the ball handler towards a corner and quickly close in and double team the offensive player creating a trap with the defenders and side lines. This trap often forces the ball handler to get rid of the ball prematurely taking the offense out of their set up. This often results in poor passes or shots. These poor passes are meant to be taken advantage of in this defense so the weak side defenders must anticipate passes to create turnovers.

== Defense ==
The defensive usage of the 1-3-1 is mostly used to create [[Turnover (basketball)|turnovers]], not for protecting the paint, due to only having one player down low. They usually have two guards to double team the ball carrier.

Another variation of the 1-3-1 defense is the full court press version. The lead guard will pressure the ball in the backcourt, and also can shade over to the side and form a 2-man trap 
with a defensive player in the 3-set when an offensive guard tries to bring up the ball down the sideline.

One effective press-break against the 1-3-1 full court press is to have either the power forward or the center to flash to midcourt and then quickly pass the weak side guard running down the sideline, not allowing the trap to be formed.

There are multiple ways to approach defense in the sport of basketball. Typically they are divided into man defenses and zone defenses. The 1-3-1 zone defense is a zone defense. It falls under this category because each player guards a specific zone within the formation. This defense is named for its formation.  A picture of the formation is shown on the right. In basketball positions are numbered from one to five.  One and two are guards, three and four are forwards, and five is the center in a typical basketball lineup. Guards are quick and typically are good ball handlers and shooters. Forwards usually are the most athletic and are typically taller than the guards. The center is the tallest player and specializes in close vicinity to the basket.

==Formation==
In this formation, the one will take the top and meet the oncoming offensive guard. The two and three positions are split out on the edges of the court at free throw level, or on the wing. The four position is down beneath the basket and acts as a rover along the base line. The rover position is typically the best athlete’s position since there is the most area to defend around the basket. The five position is posted in the center of the formation at about free throw level.

==Zone Responsibilities==
The goal of the 1-3-1 zone defense is to create turnovers. This defense focuses extra pressure on the ball handler and will exert more effort to force turnovers. Turnovers within this defense are created by a couple key features of this strategy. Two defensive players will try to trap the ball handler in one of the corners of the half court. In basketball the ball can only be held for five seconds before passing, shooting, or dribbling. If a player is trapped in the corner they tend to stop their dribble before making a decision to pass or shoot. This creates a problem for the offense but is exactly what the defense wants to happen. When a player is double teamed without their dribble they tend to make poor decisions. Often bad passes and shots are forced out by the player just to get the ball out of the corner. It is vital for players not guarding the ball handler to anticipate a bad pass or shot in order to make a steal or get a rebound. This will help create the most turnovers.

Each player will have their own responsibility in the zone. They each have their own area to guard on the court. Players will also shift as the ball is moved to be in better defensive position. This means moving to a better location to cut off passes and gather rebounds. Typically, the one will take the top position. They will meet the ball handler and force them in one direction while playing close defense. Based on the direction the ball handler dribbles the defender on the wing, either the two or three position, will close in on the ball handler for a double team. The intention is to force a double team quickly and drive the offensive player into a corner of the court. The double team creates a lot of free space on the court. The other three players must shift to cover this area equally during a trap. A trap can be made at any of the four corners both at the base line and at half court. The only difference is the base line is defended by the rover and they will trap with the wing instead of the one position. By forcing these double teams the offense will make long cross court passes. These passes are more likely to get stolen because they are less accurate and travel in the air longer. More space is open during a double team so the defenders not trapping must take advantage of the long passes and force any possible turnovers

==Coaching Strategy==
'''Defensively'''
Coaches usually do this to throw the offense off tempo. It is thrown in to mix up the defensive look and force the offense to adjust or face flustering defensive pressure. Normally the 1-3-1 defense is used to create turnovers and is fast paced so players cannot keep it up the whole game. By applying pressure to the ballhandler the defense plans to take advantage of any mistakes forced from the pressure. The extra defensive pressure often makes the ball handler lose some composure and turn the ball over. By using this at key points in the game this strategy can change momentum, cause quick scoring shifts, and create a large enough lead to break the opponents morale. This defense is very effective if run correctly and can take a team out of the game both physically and mentally.

'''Offensively'''
The 1-3-1 defense attempts to fluster the offensive set up. The key to beating the 1-3-1 zone is to get the defenders out of position. This is accomplished by quickly passing the ball around the perimeter. If the offense can pass the ball before the defense traps them then the defense must shift to adjust to the new ball position. As the defense shifts passing lanes open up and defenders have to rotate to stay in position. Speeding up the tempo and running fast breaks also can beat this defense. Pushing the ball quickly up the court gives the defense little time to set up the zone. If the offense can get to the basket before the zone sets up scoring can be achieved easily. The defense can easily be beaten if composure is kept and good passes are made. Issues occur when the offense is surprised by the extra pressure and is not expecting the trap that occur in basketball.

[[File:24h velo (LLN) (1808220531).jpg|thumb|The 24 heures de vélo in 2007]]
''Les '''24 heures vélo de Louvain-la-Neuve''''' (English: the ''24-hour bike ride of Louvain-la-Neuve'') is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[festival]] organized by students from the [[Université Catholique de Louvain]] held every year during October in [[Louvain-la-Neuve]]. The main event is a 24-hour [[bicycle]] [[relay race]] spanning the whole city, surrounded by the crowd during various music concerts and parties.

It is said that the event gathers more than fifty thousand people and that it is the second largest "beer event" in Europe after the [[Oktoberfest]]. Approximately, 2000 students are involved in the organisation of ''Les 24 heures vélo de Louvain-la-Neuve''.

In 2006, the 30th edition of the event took place from 25 to 26 October.

The 2008 event passed without major incident, with between 45,000 and 50,000 people attending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lesoir.be/regions/brabant_wallon/bonne-cuvee-pour-les-24-h-2008-10-23-653387.shtml |title=Les 24 h vélo de Louvain-la-Neuve sous le soleil |publisher=[[Le Soir]] |language=French |date=23 October 2008 |accessdate=2009-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the event took place from 24 to 25 October. About 40,000 people attended, but it was relatively trouble-free, with only 23 arrests, less than the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rtbf.be/info/regions/detail_une-nuit-assez-calme-aux-24-heures-velo-de-louvain-la-neuve?id=7862875 |title=Une nuit assez calme aux 24 heures vélo de Louvain-la-Neuve |publisher=[[RTBF]] |language=French |date=25 October 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bear Down Gym''', originally known as '''Men's Gymnasium''', is a 300-seat multi-purpose arena in [[Tucson, Arizona]].  It opened in 1926.  It was home to the [[University of Arizona]] Wildcats basketball team.  It was replaced when the [[McKale Center]] opened in 1973.  It is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

Bear Down Gym is also famous for its inclusion in the 1984 blockbuster film [[Revenge of the Nerds]]. It was the gymnasium of the fictional "Adams College" and also temporary home to the Nerds after they were kicked out of their original Freshmen home ([[Cochise Hall]]).

It was designed by [[Lyman &amp; Place]]/[[Roy Place]], architect, and was built by [[Clinton Campbell]].&lt;ref name=appendixA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdarc.org/pdf/scvnha/appendix_A.pdf |title=Appendix A: Descriptions of Important Historic Sites}}, part of {{cite web|url=http://www.cdarc.org/pdf/scvnha/cover.pdf |title=Feasibility Study for the Santa Cruz Valley National Heritage Area |publisher=Center for Desert Archaeology |editor=Jonathan Mabry |date=April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as '''Men's Gymnasium, University of Arizona''' in 1990.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;

The building has been renovated and updated to accommodate the growing needs of University of Arizona students, including housing resources for students such as the Think Tank, where students are tutored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wildcat.arizona.edu/article/2015/07/places-to-know-campus|title=Places to know on campus|last=McGlothlin|first=David|date=2015-07-15|work=The Daily Wildcat|access-date=2017-10-02|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans are in the works to add a three-story building over the spot currently holding an old swimming pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wildcat.arizona.edu/article/2017/04/bear-down-gym-gears-up-for-major-improvements|title=Bear Down Gym gears up for major improvements|last=Heffernan|first=Marissa|date=2017-04-23|work=Daily Wildcat|access-date=2017-10-02|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Chichibunomiya Rugby Stadium'''|秩父宮ラグビー場|Chichibunomiya Ragubī-jō}} (also called Prince Chichibu Memorial Stadium) in the [[Aoyama, Tokyo|Aoyama]] district of central [[Tokyo]] is the spiritual home of Japanese rugby union and the headquarters of the [[Japan Rugby Football Union]]. Named for [[Yasuhito, Prince Chichibu|Prince Chichibu]], the late brother of [[Emperor Hirohito]], the venue is used mostly for rugby sevens and rugby union matches.

It will be demolished. The space will be used for a parking lot for the [[2020 Summer Olympics]]. [[Meiji Jingu Stadium]] will be demolished and the space used to build a replacement rugby ground.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Tokyo to rebuild iconic Jingu, Chichibunomiya stadiums |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/04/02/national/tokyo-to-rebuild-iconic-jingu-chichibunomiya-stadiums/ |work=[[Japan Times]] |location=Tokyo, Japan |date=April 2, 2015 |access-date=May 27, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
The stadium currently can accommodate 27,188 spectators, but only part of the stands are covered. A large electronic scoreboard was added to the grounds as a step toward modernization before the fifth [[Rugby World Cup]] in 2003.

On April 19, 2007, it was announced that the stadium was to be equipped with lights for night games by the end of July, to assist with the [[RWC 2015]] bid. The first rugby game under lights was Japan v Asian Barbarians in August 2007, the send-off for Japan going to RWC 2007. Since then it has been used for the first [[2007-08 Top League (fifth season)|Top League]] game of the 2007–8 season between [[Suntory Sungoliath]] and [[Toshiba Brave Lupus]], also played under lights and won 10–3 by the former on October 26, 2008.

==History==

Originally completed in 1947, it was at first called Tokyo Rugby Stadium. In 1953 the name was changed to Chichibunomiya Rugby Stadium.  The stadium also served as a venue for [[Football at the 1964 Summer Olympics|football]] matches in the [[1964 Summer Olympics]].

The name Chichibunomiya commemorates the sporting prince, [[Yasuhito, Prince Chichibu|Prince Chichibu]], who was not a rugby union player but was passionately fond of the sport and died in 1953. His statue is in the stadium.

On February 3, 2008, snow prevented two Top League games being played in the 13th and final round of the fifth season. They were postponed to February 9.

From 2012 through 2015, the stadium hosted the [[Japan Sevens]], a newly created event on the circuit for men's national [[rugby sevens]] teams now known as the [[World Rugby Sevens Series]]. When inaugurated, the tournament was the seventh on the circuit schedule, and was held in late March/early April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.irbsevens.com/news/newsid=2044732.html#japan+joins+expanded+hsbc+sevens+world+series |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927045309/http://www.irbsevens.com/news/newsid%3D2044732.html#japan+joins+expanded+hsbc+sevens+world+series |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 September 2011 |title=Japan joins expanded HSBC Sevens World Series |publisher=International Rugby Board |date=18 August 2011 |accessdate=29 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 2014–15 series, Japan was removed from the schedule in favor of a return to former series host [[Singapore Sevens|Singapore]].

'''Defence''' ('''defense''' in the USA) in [[ice hockey]] is a player position whose primary responsibility is to prevent the opposing team from [[Goal (ice hockey)|scoring]]. They are often referred to as '''defencemen''', '''defencewomen''' or '''defenceplayers''', '''D''', '''D-men''' or '''blueliners''' (the latter a reference to the blue line in ice hockey which represents the boundary of the offensive zone; defencemen generally position themselves along the line to keep the puck in the zone). They were once called cover-point. A good defenceman is both strong in defensive and offensive play and for defenceman pairing also need to be good at defending and attacking.

In regular play, two defencemen complement three [[Forward (ice hockey)|forwards]] and a [[goaltender]] on the ice. Exceptions include [[Overtime (ice hockey)|overtime]] during the regular season and when a team is [[Short-handed|shorthanded]] (i.e. has been assessed a penalty), in which two defencemen are typically joined by only two forwards and a goaltender; in [[National Hockey League]] play in overtime effective with the [[2015–16 NHL season|2015-16 season]] the teams have only three position players and a goaltender on the ice and may use either two forwards and one defenceman (typically), or conversely, two defencemen and one forward.

==Historical designations==
Organized play of ice hockey originates from the first indoor game in Montreal in 1875. In subsequent years, the players per side were reduced to seven per side. Positions were standardized, and two correspond to the two defencemen of current six-man rules. These were designated as '''cover point''' and '''point''', although they lined up behind the center and the rover, unlike today. Decades later, defencemen were standardized into playing left and right sides of the ice.

===Point===
According to one of the earliest books on ice hockey, Farrell's ''Hockey: Canada's Royal Winter Game'' (1899), [[Mike Grant]] of the [[Montreal Victorias]], describes the point as "essentially defensive. He should not stray too far from his place, because oftentimes he is practically a second goal-minder ... although he should remain close to his goal-keeper, he should never obstruct that man's view of the puck. He should, as a rule, avoid rushing up the ice, but if he has a good opening for such a play he should give the puck to one of the forwards on the first opportunity and then hasten back to his position, which has been occupied, in the interim, by the cover-point."{{sfn|Farrell|1899|p=95}}

=== Cover-point ===
Hugh Baird, then captain and cover-point of the [[Montreal Hockey Club]], describes the cover-point as "a combination of a defence man and a forward, and is allowed, in virtue of this fact, more latitude with respect to leaving his position, than any man on the team, except the rover. In his capacity of a defence player, he should linger around his goals as long as the puck is near... When the play is at the other end of the rink, the cover-point should advance to about the middle, so that when the puck is lifted down, he may return it without loss of time, in order to keep the game centered around his opponents' goals, and to save his forwards the trouble of skating up to him so that they may again 'get in to play.' It is by playing far up under these circumstances that a clever cover-point can chine to the advantage of his team. If he has a good opening he should shoot well for the goals, but if he has not, he should, as I have said, return the puck instantaneously."{{sfn|Farrell|1899|p=98}}

==Distinguished defencemen==
Each year the [[National Hockey League|NHL]], the premier ice hockey league in the world, presents the [[James Norris Memorial Trophy]] to the best defenceman in the league. [[Bobby Orr]] of the [[Boston Bruins]] – an eight-time Norris Trophy recipient&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bobby Orr – Legends of Hockey |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=p197902&amp;type=Player&amp;page=bio&amp;list=#photo |accessdate=2008-09-27 |publisher=[[Hockey Hall of Fame]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316025744/http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=p197902&amp;type=Player&amp;page=bio&amp;list= |archivedate=March 16, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; – is often considered to be the greatest defenceman in NHL and ice hockey history. In addition to his Norris Trophy honours, he is the only defenceman in NHL history to capture the [[Art Ross Trophy]] as the league's leading scorer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bobby Orr Biography|url=http://www.hockey-fans.com/players/orr.php|accessdate=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Orr was selected as the best defenceman of all-time (second overall player behind [[Wayne Gretzky]]) in ''[[The Hockey News]]''' [[List of 100 greatest hockey players by The Hockey News|Top 100 NHL Players of all-time]].

Conversely, according to the [[IIHF Centennial All-Star Team]] (also chosen by ''The Hockey News''), the greatest defencemen to play in [[International Ice Hockey Federation|IIHF]]-sanctioned international competition are [[Vyacheslav Fetisov]] and [[Börje Salming]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iihf.com/channels/iihf-world-championship/news/news-singleview-world-championship/article/iihf-centennial-all-star-team.html?tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=552&amp;cHash=3a26b76f60 IIHF Centennial All-Star Team&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=='Stay-at-home' and 'offensive defence'==
Defence players are often described by the amount they participate in the offence. The extreme of non-participation in offence is a ''[[Stay-at-home defenceman|Stay-at-home]]'' defender, who takes few risks and does not score much, instead focusing on defending against the opposing team. A good example is [[Rod Langway]], who won the Norris Trophy while scoring only three goals that season, as the award winners preceding him were primarily offensive defencemen such as [[Bobby Orr]], [[Denis Potvin]], and [[Larry Robinson]].

The extreme of participation is an ''offensive defenceman'', who gets aggressively involved in the team's offence. To accomplish this, the offensive defence player often pinches in to keep the play from going [[Offside (ice hockey)|offside]] and moves towards the [[Ice hockey rink#Half boards|halfboards]] and [[Slot (ice hockey)|high-slot]] area for scoring opportunities. This makes it difficult for the opposing team to protect their net from being scored upon if the team can maintain control of the [[Hockey puck|puck]]. However, this can lead to more odd man rushes and [[Breakaway (ice hockey)|breakaway]] opportunities for the opposing team if the defender does not succeed. Bobby Orr's end-to-end rushing allowed him to defend effectively as well as attack. By contrast, [[Paul Coffey]] enjoyed high offensive production but his defensive play was considered mediocre for most of his career.

===Defensive zone play===
When in the [[Hockey rink#Zones|defensive zone]], the defence player is responsible for keeping the opposing forwards' opportunities to a minimum when they are on a rush, forcing them to the corners and blocking both passing and shooting lanes. When the opposing offence is putting pressure on the defence's team, the defence skater usually plays closer to the net, attempting again to block shooting lanes but also ensure that the goalie is not screened (prevented from being able to see the puck at all times). It is especially critical for the defenceman to keep opposing forwards from being able to move effectively in front of the net. If a shot on net is made, an unguarded forward can often redirect it too quickly for the goalie to adjust or else score on a rebound. Another important duty is clearing rebounds away from the goal, and preferably to the defenceman's teammates, before opposing forwards can get to them.

===Neutral zone play===
In the [[Hockey rink#Zones|neutral zone]], the defence hangs back towards his or her own blue line, usually playing the puck up to other teammates. According to Jay Leach, who writes for NHL.com's "learn to play hockey" section, the defence must "Move the puck hard and quick to the open man. Join the rush, &lt;nowiki&gt;[but]&lt;/nowiki&gt; do not lead it." Because of this responsibility, defencemen must read the other team's defensive strategy effectively in order to make an effective first pass that furthers the offensive momentum without leaving the defenceman out of position should his team lose control of the puck. In certain situations the best option could be to skate the puck into the zone to maintain offensive speed as well as preventing an offside.

===Offensive zone play===
In the [[Hockey rink#Zones|offensive zone]], the defence skaters usually "play the blue line." It is their duty to keep the puck in the offensive zone by stopping it from crossing the blue line that demarcates where the offensive zone begins. Should the puck cross this line, the offence cannot touch the puck in their opponent's zone without stopping play (see [[offside (hockey)|offside]]). Defencemen must be quick to pass the puck around, helping their forwards to open up shooting lanes, or taking open shots themselves when they become available. The defence must also be able to skate quickly to cut off any breakaways, moving themselves back into the defensive zone ahead of the onrushing opponent.

Essentially in all three zones of the rink, the defence is the backstop for the puck. It should never go behind the defence, unless the player lets it. The defence keeps the momentum of play squarely directed towards the opposing goal, or at least away from his own.

Because defencemen are often expected to shoot on the opposing net from long range, these players often develop the hardest and most accurate [[slapshot]]s. This is because taking a more stationary position on the blue line rewards pure accuracy and patience, rather than the adept hand–eye coordination attributed to forwards. [[Al MacInnis]], who was seven times decorated with "Hardest Shot" in NHL skills competitions, was able to score frequently from the blue line because his slapshot was simply too fast to block effectively.

When a team is on a [[power play (sport)|power play]], a defence player can set up plays in the offensive zone, and distribute the puck to the teammate that he or she feels is in the best position to score, similar to a [[point guard]] in basketball and a [[quarterback]] in [[American football]] and [[Canadian football]]. For this reason, a defenceman will often be described as the power play "quarterback". This is also referred to as "playing [[The point (ice hockey)|the point]]" (this term derives not from the basketball position, but from an older name for the defence position in hockey itself).

==Faceoffs==
During [[faceoff]]s in the defensive zone, most teams have their defence players pair up with opposing forwards to tie them up while leaving the team's forwards open to move the puck, though this is at the discretion of the individual coach. In the offensive zone, the defence player acts in his or her usual role, keeping control of the puck as the forwards fight for position.

In the first organized ice hockey, (see [[Amateur Hockey Association of Canada]]), defencemen used to line up in an "I" formation behind the [[Rover (ice hockey)|rover]] (defunct) as ''point'' and ''coverpoint''. Defence is still referred to as "playing the point", though this term now refers mostly to the role of defencemen on the power-play.

==Skating==
Defencemen must possess excellent skating abilities, specifically in speed, constant foot movement and quick transitioning from forward to backward and vice versa. With regard to skating backwards, defencemen must acquire a higher skill level than offensive players. This allows them to face their offensive opponents as they rush down the ice toward the defensive zone. A defenceman must be as comfortable going backwards and sideways as forwards. Defencemen must also gain confidence in quickly carrying the puck to open up the attack during a defensive zone breakout. This requires the ability to burst out of the defensive zone with speed, yet at the same time having the ability to use their vision to execute quick passes to open forwards, or gaining the neutral zone before shooting the puck into the offensive zone.

'''''Desi Adda: Games of India''''' is a collection of video games developed by [[Gameshastra]] and published by [[Sony Computer Entertainment Europe]]. It was released for [[PlayStation 2]] on October 27, 2009. It was later released for [[PlayStation Portable]] and was the first Indian developed game to be added to [[PlayStation Network]].&lt;ref name="pressrelease" /&gt;&lt;ref name="indiatoday" /&gt; The game was released in three languages: [[Hindi]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]].&lt;ref name="indiatoday" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mint"/&gt;

==Gameplay==
''Desi Adda'' consists of a collection of cultural games from India, based on traditional Indian sports. These include [[Fighter kite|kite fighting]], [[Kabaddi]], [[Pachisi]], and [[Gilli-Danda]].&lt;ref name="indiatoday" /&gt;&lt;ref name="siliconera" /&gt; The player is placed in an Indian village, where they can play the different games with other villagers and converse with them. The player will learn from the villagers of a couple in love, and must interact with different villagers in order to progress the story. An additional beat-matching dance game is unlocked by completing the story.&lt;ref name="bollywoodhungama" /&gt;

==Plot==
The player takes the role of Avinash, the son of an [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|NRI]] businessman. Avinash has lived aboard but returns on a trip to his ancestral village. During his visit, he meets Gowri and Gopal, a couple who are in love. The village head, Garjan Singh, opposes their match.&lt;ref name="businessstandard" /&gt; Through his interactions with villagers, Avinash helps the couple gain approval for their wedding.&lt;ref name="bollywoodhungama" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sony"/&gt;

==Development==
The game was developed by [[Gameshastra]], an Indian-based developer. Sony Computer Entertainment Europe published the game, with the goal of helping keep the PlayStation 2 market in India alive.&lt;ref name="mint" /&gt;&lt;ref name="siliconera" /&gt; It is the first game developed entirely in India to be released on the PlayStation Network, and included three languages. ''Desi Adda'' was designed for both home consoles and handheld devices, and oriented towards casual gaming. It was targeted towards a first-time gamer audience between the ages of 8 and 15.&lt;ref name="businessstandard" /&gt;

==Reception==
[[Bollywood Hungama]] was critical of the bonus beat matching game, calling it a "show stopper" as the controls were not very responsive. They were more receptive towards the Gilli Danda game, saying that the unpredictability made it fun. Ultimately however, they did not feel the game was worth the price.&lt;ref name="bollywoodhungama" /&gt; [[ET Now]] noted that the game was very simple in terms of gameplay and graphics, and was not really appealing to gamers over the age of ten.&lt;ref name="etnow" /&gt;

'''Freerunning''' is a way of expression by interacting with various obstacles and environment. Freerunning may include flipping and spinning. These movements are usually adopted from other sports, such as [[gymnastics]], [[Tricking_(martial_arts)|tricking]] or [[breakdancing]]. Freerunners can create their own moves, flows and lines in different landscapes. It is all about becoming creative in an objective environment. Practitioners of Freerunning usually do [[Parkour]] as well. Freerunning is often associated with Parkour by adding acrobatic and stylish moves, showcasing the art of movement. Freerunning was founded by [[Sebastien Foucan]], who discussed the subject in [[Jump London]] in 2003. Foucan developed freerunning as a more inclusive form of ''[[Parkour]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Parkour? |work=World Freerunning Parkour Federation |url= http://www.wfpf.com/parkour/ |date=2018 |accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parkour's military [[obstacle course]] training lends itself to [[martial art]] as a means of weapons avoidance and efficiently closing a distance to an opponent.

==Etymology==
The word "freerunning" was first used in the documentary, ''[[Jump London]]''.&lt;ref name=SebLR1&gt;{{cite interview | last = Knol|first = Enzo |title = Enzo Knol – Find your way – London Real |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGq1j_xyzHM |work = London Real |location = London |date = 28 October 2012 |accessdate = 3 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name came about because of a suggestion by Sjors Peters, who was working with Knol at the time. The thinking behind the name was, to quote Knol, "'Free' because it's free, and just 'running'."&lt;ref name=SebLR1/&gt; In the documentary, freerunning was defined as an English translation of Parkour.&lt;ref&gt;Note: Foucan has since said that the confusion regarding the roots of the term came out of the fact that he was still formulating his ideas at the time of the filming.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{wiktionary}}

==Philosophy==
The central principle of freerunning is that one should express oneself by moving fluidly in one's environment; there are no limitations on the form of this movement.&lt;ref name="Freerun"&gt;{{cite book |last= Foucan |first= Sebastien |authorlink= Sebastien Foucan |title= Freerunning |year= 2008 |publisher=Michael O'Mara Books |location= U.K. |isbn= 978-1-56975-652-2 |page=8|id=  {{ASIN|1843173301|country=uk}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Foucan expands on a number of basic principles of the sport in his book, ''Freerunning''.&lt;ref name="Freerun"/&gt; Other practitioners have suggested other principles. For example, [[Daniel Ilabaca]] encourages people to think positively, suggesting that practitioners of freerunning will sometimes fall—largely because they think they might.&lt;ref name=Ilabaca1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beachcombermb.com/opinions/2012/01/27/parkour-legends-daniel-ilabaca-tim-shieff-and-oleg-vorslov/ |title=Parkour Legends: Daniel Ilabaca, Tim Shieff and Oleg Vorslov |author=Declan Saldana |date=27 January 2012 |accessdate=3 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807001610/http://www.beachcombermb.com/opinions/2012/01/27/parkour-legends-daniel-ilabaca-tim-shieff-and-oleg-vorslov/ |archivedate=7 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Origins in Parkour===
{{Main|Parkour#History}}
In Western Europe, the idea of moving past obstacles for personal development or sport originated with [[Georges Hébert]].&lt;ref name="gen"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://parkourgenerations.com/article/parkour-history |title=Parkour History |last=Edwardes |first=Dan |work=ParkourGenerations.com |date=22 August 2014 |accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He observed untrained native tribes in Africa with fantastic athletic ability and created the 'natural method' system to train people using the same ideas. His ideas eventually led to the ''parcours du combattant'' ('obstacle course', literally 'assault course'), which is now a standard of military training.&lt;ref name=Hebert1&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.urbanfreeflow.com/articles/methode_naturelle.htm |title=George Hébert and the Natural Method of Physical Culture |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050323090031/http://www.urbanfreeflow.com/articles/methode_naturelle.htm |archivedate=23 March 2005 |accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Wikiversity|Parkour and Freerunning}}

These ideas were picked up by a young [[Raymond Belle]], who used them to practical effect while separated from his family during the [[First Indochina War]]. When he moved to France and started a family, he passed on these ideas to his son, [[David Belle|David]]. 30 years later, other young people were attracted to these ideas and a small group formed, the [[Yamakasi]], which included Foucan.&lt;ref name="gen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Parkour-DB2"&gt;{{cite book |title=Parkour |last=Belle |first=David |authorlink=David Belle |year=2009 |publisher=Intervista |isbn=978-2-35756-025-3 |pages=31–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group trained together for several years and in 1997, through David Belle's brother, Jean-Francois, they started to attract attention and be invited to perform at events. The Yamakasi eventually split apart, though, because some members sought to find more individual expressions of the discipline.&lt;ref name="CineParkour1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Parkour-DB3"&gt;{{cite book |title=Parkour |last=Belle |first=David |authorlink=David Belle |year=2009 |publisher=Intervista |isbn=978-2-35756-025-3 |pages=71–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, action star [[Jackie Chan]] had also been heavily incorporating the same concepts in most of his films ever since the early 1980s from the other side of the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parkourfreerunningonline.com/jackie-chans-special-style-of-parkour/ |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081600/http://www.parkourfreerunningonline.com/jackie-chans-special-style-of-parkour/ |archive-date=2016-03-04 |title=Jackie Chan's Special Style Of Parkour |date=November 5, 2015 |publisher=Parkour and Freerunning Online: Your source of Parkour and Freerunning videos |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further development===
Foucan wanted to create a discipline that was more personal to the individual than Parkour and more easily adapted to suit each person's individual goals.&lt;ref name="Freerun"/&gt; His idea was similar to that of [[Bruce Lee]]'s creation of [[Jeet Kune Do]]. Foucan wanted to take everything that he had found useful and that he liked from his Parkour experiences and combine it into one sport.&lt;ref name=SebLR1/&gt;

Foucan's early ideas were first spread through the ''Jump London'' documentary (2003) and its sequel, ''[[Jump Britain]]'' (2005). Foucan has appeared in other productions, such as ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' and Madonna's ''[[Confessions Tour]]''.&lt;ref name="CineParkour1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ciné Parkour |last=Angel |first=Julie |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-9569717-1-5 |pages=17–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; With each appearance both the discipline and Foucan himself increased in fame.&lt;ref name="Freerun" /&gt;

==International==
In 2014, the [[BBC]] traveled to Indian administered [[Kashmir]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-30347099/ |title=Kashmir Freerunning Finding Freedom in the Art of Parkour|work=BBC|date=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to highlight the youth partaking in freerunning as a form of freedom of expression.

'''Grisham Stadium''' is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Carrollton, Georgia]]. The stadium is home to the [[American football|football]] program from Carrollton High School and is also the former home field for the [[University of West Georgia]].

Grisham Stadium is currently undergoing extensive renovations, which include a [[state-of-the-art]] [[artificial track]] and field, complete visitor's [[locker room]]s, and updated concessions. A new grand entrance will be incorporated in 2008-2009 to include a brick memorial walkway. A {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} bronze Trojan monument will also greet fans upon entering the updated stadium. These additions will be linked with the existing "TrojanTron" and Matrix Boards, as well as the home fieldhouse which houses the Trojan Hall of Fame.[http://www.westga.edu/~stadium/news.html]

'''Joseph Julius Kryczka''' {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|QC}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|ɪ|s|k|ɑː}}; June 4, 1935 – January 11, 1991) was a Canadian [[ice hockey]] administrator, lawyer and judge, who was commonly known as "'''Justice Joe'''".&lt;ref name="ASHOF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ashfm.ca/hall-of-fame-honoured-members/in-memory/kryczka-joseph|title=Kryczka, Joseph|website=Alberta Sports Hall of Fame &amp; Museum|access-date=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HockeyGods"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hockeygods.com/images/11793-Joe_Kryczka_and_Adam_Kryczka_University_of_Alberta_Golden_Bears|title=Joe Kryczka and Adam Kryczka University of Alberta Golden Bears|date=2014-03-16|website=HockeyGods|access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="summit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1972summitseries.com/kryczka.html|title=Joe Kryczka|website=1972 Summit Series|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="y81"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kryczka dead|newspaper=Medicine Hat News|location=Medicine Hat, Alberta|date=January 15, 1991|page=7|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/obituary-clipping-jan-15-1991-765680/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; His hockey career included tenures as president of the [[Hockey Alberta|Alberta Amateur Hockey Association]], and later the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]] from 1971 to 1973. He began his legal career as a lawyer, then was appointed a judge, and later elevated to a justice on the [[Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta]].

Kryczka was the lead negotiator who secured the agreement for [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canada]] to play the [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|Soviet Union]] at the 1972 [[Summit Series]]. His negotiating skills were unrecognized at the time, and his contribution to the Summit Series was overshadowed by [[Alan Eagleson]]. During his career he negotiated other notable disagreements in Canadian hockey. When the [[Western Hockey League|Western Canada Hockey League]] broke away from the governing body, Kryczka was able to reunite the league with the rest of Canada, and maintain the threatened the [[Memorial Cup]] competition. He also successfully brought Alberta hockey back under the national umbrella when it resigned. He later dealt with the [[World Hockey Association]] when it raided rosters of Canadian junior teams without compensation, and then became the first commissioner of the [[Canadian Hockey League|Canadian Major Junior Hockey League]].

Kryczka graduated from the [[University of Alberta]], and played hockey with the [[Alberta Golden Bears and Pandas|Golden Bears]]. He practiced law in [[Calgary]] for over 20 years, was a director with the [[Calgary Cowboys]], and later played a key role with Calgary's successful bid for the [[1988 Winter Olympics]]. He was later inducted into both [[Canada's Sports Hall of Fame]] and the [[Alberta Sports Hall of Fame and Museum|Alberta Sports Hall of Fame]] in 1990.

Kryczka began volunteering as community hockey coach in 1959, and also [[Official (ice hockey)|refereed]] in various leagues.&lt;ref name="ASHOF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sportshall" /&gt; He was elected to the executive committee of the [[Hockey Alberta|Alberta Amateur Hockey Association]] (AAHA) in 1963,&lt;ref name="sportshall" /&gt; and served as the Calgary [[Boosterism|Booster Club]] president from 1964 to 1965.&lt;ref name="cbc-p5"&gt;''Calgary Booster Club (1986)'', p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected second vice-president of the AAHA in September 1966,&lt;ref name="y54"&gt;{{cite news|title=Stu Peppard Is Returned|newspaper=Lethbridge Herald|location=Lethbridge, Alberta|date=September 26, 1966|page=12|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-sep-26-1966-764987/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became its president in October 1967.&lt;ref name="y55"&gt;{{cite news|title=Talking About Sports|newspaper=Peace River Record Gazette|location=Peace River, Alberta|date=October 4, 1967|last=Windjack|first=Fred|page=6|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-oct-04-1967-764996/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kryczka's presidency of the AAHA coincided with the formation of the [[Western Hockey League|Western Canada Hockey League]] (WCHL), which had teams in [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Manitoba]]. Various disputes arose with the WCHL, because it was outside of the jurisdiction of the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]] (CAHA), the governing body for the AAHA. In February 1969, the CAHA and Kryczka as president of the AAHA, were named in a lawsuit by the WCHL and its governing body, the Canadian Hockey Association.&lt;ref name="y56"&gt;{{cite news|title=Alberta Court To Rule|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press|location=Winnipeg, Manitoba|date=February 18, 1969|page=24|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-feb-18-1969-765068/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WCHL sought development money for its players drafted by the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), as per the draft agreement between the NHL and the CAHA, but the CAHA refused to distribute money to a league it did not sanction.&lt;ref name="y56" /&gt; Later that month, Kryczka gave an ultimatum to the Alberta Hockey Referees Association, stating that the AAHA would only use referees which did not officiate in the WCHL.&lt;ref name="y57"&gt;{{cite news|title=AAHA ultimatum is given to refs|newspaper=Medicine Hat News|location=Medicine Hat, Alberta|date=February 24, 1969|page=11|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-feb-24-1969-765085/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="y58"&gt;{{cite news|title=Alberta Referees Adamant|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press|location=Winnipeg, Manitoba|date=February 25, 1969|page=28|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-feb-25-1969-765088/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision threatened to end an agreement from October 1968, where referees in Alberta formed an independent organization to officiates games for both governing bodies.&lt;ref name="y58" /&gt; Later in March, Kryczka suspended two referees who still worked games in the WCHL.&lt;ref name="y59"&gt;{{cite news|title=Two refs cannot work senior tilts|newspaper=Brandon Sun|location=Brandon, Manitoba|date=March 5, 1969|page=8|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-mar-05-1969-765094/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1969 CAHA annual general meeting, Kryczka said that the WCHL succeeded in drawing many fans, and gave an opportunity for many young men to play in [[Western Canada]]. He also felt that CAHA branches such as Alberta, should be able to establish a major junior category for higher-level competition, similar to what the WCHL did  across three provinces.&lt;ref name="y60"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hockey Bodies Nearing Peace?|newspaper=Lethbridge Herald|location=Lethbridge, Alberta|date=May 20, 1969|page=11|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-may-20-1969-765108/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="y61"&gt;{{cite news|title=CAHA tries to lure CHA back into fold|newspaper=Medicine Hat News|location=Medicine Hat, Alberta|date=May 21, 1969|last=Krevenchuk|first=Walter|page=6|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-may-21-1969-765344/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="y62"&gt;{{cite news|title=CAHA courting WCHL?|newspaper=Brandon Sun|location=Brandon, Manitoba|date=May 21, 1969|page=6|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-may-21-1969-765347/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CAHA reorganized its committees to give more representation at the national level to its leagues, but the motion to have a major junior classification was defeated.&lt;ref name="y63"&gt;{{cite news|title=CAHA shuffles organization|newspaper=Brandon Sun|location=Brandon, Manitoba|date=May 23, 1969|page=6|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-may-23-1969-765628/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="y64"&gt;{{cite news|title=CAHA Keeps Its Junior Format|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press|location=Winnipeg, Manitoba|date=May 23, 1969|last=Krevenchuk|first=Walter|page=49|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-may-23-1969-765636/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==CAHA vice-president==
[[File:Memorial Cup.jpg|thumb|right|The Memorial Cup is awarded to the junior ice hockey champion of Canada, and its status was threatened in 1971 while Kryczka was vice-president of the CAHA.]]
Kryczka was elected vice-president of the CAHA in May 1969.&lt;ref name="y65"&gt;{{cite news|title=CAHA reorganizes after 53 years|newspaper=Medicine Hat News|location=Medicine Hat, Alberta|date=May 23, 1969|page=5|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-may-23-1969-765645/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="y66"&gt;{{cite news|title=Talking About Sports|newspaper=Peace River Record Gazette|location=Peace River, Alberta|date=June 11, 1969|last=Windjack|first=Fred|page=6|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-jun-11-1969-765650/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1969, he was optimistic that the CAHA and the WCHL would be able to agree on reuniting. He felt it would be possible if the WCHL agreed to appropriately compensate CAHA teams from which players were signed, and that there would be no expansion into cities with an existing CAHA team.&lt;ref name="y67"&gt;{{cite news|title=Trouble Lies Within CAHA's Ranks, Munro|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press|location=Winnipeg, Manitoba|date=September 9, 1969|page=74 |url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-sep-09-1969-765655/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further confirmed that the CAHA had not approved of its players being signed by the WCHL, or relocation into its territory.

The CAHA added multiple vice-presidents as of 1970, and Kryczka was elected first vice-president by acclamation on May 29, 1970.&lt;ref name="y69"&gt;{{cite news|title=Earl Dawson Re-Elected|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press|location=Winnipeg, Manitoba|date=May 29, 1970|page=44|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-may-29-1970-766234/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took objection to [[Clarence Campbell]] stating that the NHL may need to revert back to direct ownership of teams, because of concessions made to the WCHL, and having different age limits across Canada's junior hockey system.

==CAHA president==
===First year===
Kryczka succeeded [[Earl Dawson]] as president of the CAHA, on May 29, 1971.&lt;ref name="y43"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kryczka CAHA Head; Addison Honored|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press|location=Winnipeg, Manitoba|date=May 29, 1971|page=60 |url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-may-29-1971-766350/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role also made him a director with  [[Hockey Canada]] for two years.&lt;ref name="sportshall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Greer" /&gt; He hoped to make the CAHA financially independent of both the NHL and the [[Government of Canada]], and become more of an administrative body.&lt;ref name="y38"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Nation|newspaper=Medicine Hat News|location=Medicine Hat, Alberta|date=September 15, 1971|last=Lynch|first=Charles|page=2 |url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-sep-15-1971-766428/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after becoming president, Kryczka announced a resolution to the [[Memorial Cup]] competition, where the Ontario and Quebec leagues agreed to compete with the Western Canada teams which gave up having extra overage players.&lt;ref name="y41"&gt;{{cite news|title=Memorial Cup issue settled|newspaper=Lethbridge Herald|location=Lethbridge, Alberta|date=July 24, 1971|page=12|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-jul-24-1971-766373/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the agreement, all three leagues were invited to participate in the meetings to renew the CAHA-NHL contract when it expired in 1972.&lt;ref name="y41" /&gt; 

In June 1971, he announced that the CAHA had rejected an invitation from the IIHF to return to play in the World Championships, since Canada would still not be able to use its professional players.&lt;ref name="y42"&gt;{{cite news|title=briefly...|newspaper=Brandon Sun|location=Brandon, Manitoba|date=June 7, 1971|page=7|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-jun-07-1971-766357/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year in September, Kryczka stated that the CAHA had not been invited to play in the [[1972 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sapporo]], and accused Ahearne of political grandstanding for saying that Canada could be removed from the IIHF for its refusal to play.&lt;ref name="y40" /&gt;&lt;ref name="y39"&gt;{{cite news|title=Olympic Invitation Exists But...|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press|location=Winnipeg, Manitoba|date=September 4, 1971|last=McNeil|first=Al|page=58 |url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-sep-04-1971-766400/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kryczka met with [[Harold Wright (athlete)|Harold Wright]] of the [[Canadian Olympic Committee|Canadian Olympic Association]] (COA) in September to review the situation, and Wright confirmed that the COA received an invitation to the Winter Olympics on July 28.&lt;ref name="y39" /&gt; Wright felt that he decision was in disregard to recreational hockey in Canada, and that the CAHA should send a team, as the Olympics was a different an unrelated tournament, compared to the World Championships.&lt;ref name="y36"&gt;{{cite news|title=Olympians Fire Salvo|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press|location=Winnipeg, Manitoba|date=September 18, 1971|page=62 |url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-sep-18-1971-766444/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CAHA was urged by the COA to send an amateur team, since the [[U Sports|Canadian Interuniversity Athletics Union]] (CIAU) proposed sending a team in lieu of the CAHA.&lt;ref name="y39" /&gt;

Despite the discussions, Kryczka was committed to the CAHA's withdrawal from international play, until it could use its best players against the Europeans.&lt;ref name="y36" /&gt;&lt;ref name="y37"&gt;{{cite news|title=No Bluff, Says CAHA Leader|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press|location=Winnipeg, Manitoba|date=September 17, 1971|last=Sutton|first=Gerry|page=42|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-sep-17-1971-766442/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="y01"&gt;{{cite news|title=Canada To Air Position|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press|location=Winnipeg, Manitoba|date=April 11, 1972|page=49|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-apr-11-1972-773663/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that Canada would voice its concerns at the next IIHF general meeting in the summer of 1972. He felt that the IIHF should allow professionals in the World Championships similar to [[FIFA]], and reiterated that the CAHA had a good relationship with the NHL, which would release such players for an event.&lt;ref name="y01" /&gt; Kryczka remained open to other competitions, which included the [[Izvestia Cup]].&lt;ref name="y01" /&gt;

Meanwhile, Kryczka had been collaborating for two years with [[Charles Hay (ice hockey)|Charles Hay]] from Hockey Canada, in attempts to convince the [[Soviet Union]] to play Canada in a hockey series allowing professional players.&lt;ref name="y11"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jim Coleman column|newspaper=Medicine Hat News|location=Medicine Hat, Alberta|last=Coleman|first=Jim|author-link=Jim Coleman (journalist)|date=April 19, 1972|page=6|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-apr-19-1972-773688/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HS-76-77"&gt;''Houston &amp; Shoalts (1993)'', pp. 76–77&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1972, the [[Global Affairs Canada|Canadian Bureau of Public Affairs]] empowered Kryczka, Hay and [[Lou Lefaive]] from [[Sport Canada]], to oversee diplomatic efforts to return Canada to international ice hockey, and gave them needed assistance from [[List of diplomatic missions of Canada|Canadian embassies]] in Europe, and specifically the [[Embassy of Canada in Moscow]].&lt;ref name="MH-32"&gt;''Macintosh &amp; Hawes (1994)'', p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable Canadians involved in the process included [[Gordon Juckes]] from the CAHA, [[Doug Fisher (politician)|Doug Fisher]] and Allan Scott from Hockey Canada, [[Robert Ford (poet)|Robert Ford]] the Canadian ambassador in Moscow, and translator [[Aggie Kukulowicz]] who worked at [[Air Canada]] in Moscow.&lt;ref name="summit" /&gt;

The negotiations for a Canada-Soviet series were finalized at the [[Hotel International Prague]] during the [[1972 World Ice Hockey Championships]].&lt;ref name="HS-76-77" /&gt; Kryczka was chosen as the lead negotiator of behalf of the Canadian delegation, due to his legal background.&lt;ref name="MH-32" /&gt; He also went into the negotiations with an understanding of the [[Russian language]], but never revealed this to the Soviets.&lt;ref name="HS-76-77" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McKinley-p168"&gt;''McKinley, Michael (2014)'', p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, his neighbours were Russian immigrants who never spoke to him in English.&lt;ref name="Maki"&gt;{{cite web|title=Man who helped set up games is erased from tournament lore|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/man-who-helped-set-up-games-is-erased-from-tournament-lore/article25305354/|last=Maki|first=Allan|date=2002-09-20|website=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; After each day of negotiating, he informed Hay of what the Soviets had said to each other.&lt;ref name="McKinley-p168" /&gt; Kryczka later gave an interview to journalist [[Jim Coleman (journalist)|Jim Coleman]], and said that the Soviets had previously decided they could defeat any NHL team, and drew out negotiations to get more concessions on the rules of play.&lt;ref&gt;''Houston &amp; Shoalts (1993)'', p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

The final agreement negotiated by Kryczka stipulated that Soviet players were to be paid {{CAD|5,000|link=yes}} per game in Canada, and Canadian players were to be paid [[Soviet ruble|SUR]]5,000 per game in [[Moscow]]. It also stipulated the choice of referees was acceptable to both parties.&lt;ref name="Maki" /&gt; It was signed on April 18, 1972, and agreed to an eight-game series where both [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Team Canada]] and the [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|Soviet Team]] were allowed unrestricted rosters which included professionals.&lt;ref name="MH-32" /&gt;&lt;ref name="y12"&gt;{{cite news|title=Canada May Rejoin World Hockey|newspaper=European Stars and Stripes|location=Darmstadt, Hesse|date=April 20, 1972|page=21|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-apr-20-1972-773682/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two-page document had no official seal or letterhead, but included the signatures of Kryczka, [[Andrey Starovoytov]] as the general secretary of the [[Ice Hockey Federation of Russia|Soviet Union Ice Hockey Federation]], and the approvals of Ahearne as the president of the IIHF, and former CAHA president [[Fred Page]] as the vice-president of the IIHF.&lt;ref name="Maki" /&gt;

===Second year===
Kryczka began his second year as president by speaking to delegates at the 1972 general meeting of the CAHA.

The Canada-Soviet series began September 2, 1972, and Canadians believed they would easily defeat the Soviets.&lt;ref name="Struth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyisnowmagazine.com/blog/2014/2/26/when-the-cold-war-became-hot-the-summit-series-between-the-ussr-and-canada#.Wxdf4pxE00M=|title=When the Cold War became Hot – The Summit Series between the USSR and Canada|last=Struth |first=Matthew|date=2014-02-26|website=History is Now Magazine|access-date=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, after seven games it was tied with 3 wins each and a draw. The Canadians and Soviets disagreed over who should referee the final eighth match. Kryczka was against having the West German officials [[Josef Kompalla]] and [[Franz Baader (ice hockey)|Franz Baader]] referee the game, and demanded to have [[Ove Dahlberg]] of Sweden, and [[Rudy Batja]] of Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref name="y18"&gt;{{cite news|title=Question of Officials Brings Out New Soviet-Canada Ice Dispute|newspaper=Fort Walton Beach Playground Daily News|location=Fort Walton Beach, Florida|date=September 28, 1972|page=13|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-sep-28-1972-773537/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nitzyshockeyden.blogspot.com/2012/09/summit-series-72-josef-kompalla-in-his.html?m=1|title=Summit Series '72, Josef Kompalla in his own words|date=2012-09-27|website=Nitzy's Hockey Den|access-date=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A compromise was reached that included Kompalla and Batja as referees for the eighth game, and in the pregame ceremony Kryczka and [[Alan Eagleson]] presented the Soviet hosts with a [[totem pole]] as a gift from Canada.&lt;ref name="Maki" /&gt;&lt;ref name="y77"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gimme a M, gimme an A...|newspaper=Brandon Sun|location=Brandon, Manitoba|date=October 23, 1976|last=Davidson|first=Bill|page=6 |url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-oct-23-1976-765739/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada went on to win the final game by a 6–5 score, and won the series 4 games to three, with a draw.&lt;ref name="Struth" /&gt;

Kryczka received little credit at the time for his role in the series and was overshadowed by Eagleson, with whom he shared a mutual dislike.&lt;ref name="Maki" /&gt; Eagleson was attending the World Championships and was not part of the negotiations, but he was the first person to phone Canada from Prague, and take credit for the event by reporting the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;''Macintosh &amp; Hawes (1994)'', p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Remy Greer argued that, "if it wasn’t for the negotiating prowess of Kryczka, the series might never have happened".&lt;ref name="Greer" /&gt; Eagleson felt that series was made by the NHL players, and gave no thanks to others involved.&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://o.canada.com/news/eagleson-to-stand-in-shadows-on-anniversary-of-summit-series-triumph|title=Eagleson to stand in shadows on anniversary of Summit Series triumph|last=Fisher|first=Matthew|date=2012-08-31 |website=Canada.com|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He felt that Kryczka only helped with the totem pole, and nothing else.&lt;ref name="y77" /&gt; Kryczka's wife later said that she needed to sit between them at each game, as they were both "loud-mouthed lawyers" with a "hate-hate relationship".&lt;ref name="Maki" /&gt;

The Canada-Soviet series later became known as the [[Summit Series]], and fostered a source of national pride as a significant historical event.&lt;ref&gt;''Henderson &amp; Prime (2011)'', p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Kryczka said that Canadian amateur hockey gained from the series because the CAHA earned $100,000 as its share of the profits, and it would be probable to see another similar professional event due to public demand.&lt;ref name="y19"&gt;{{cite news|title=Future series likely|newspaper=Lethbridge Herald|location=Lethbridge, Alberta|date=October 4, 1972|page=6|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-oct-04-1972-773525/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also speculated that the success of the CAHA in negotiating the series, may render the rival Hockey Canada structure obsolete.&lt;ref name="y19" /&gt; He was open to more tournaments and games which followed IIHF statutes, and condemned reports that the NHL and the NHLPA were trying to negotiate international games on their own for the sake of keeping profits to themselves, instead of following proper international procedures.&lt;ref name="y20"&gt;{{cite news|title=CAHA Won't Play Dead Over Proposed Series|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press|location=Winnipeg, Manitoba|date=November 9, 1972|page=49|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-nov-09-1972-773496/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="y04"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sully Says|newspaper=Lethbridge Herald|location=Lethbridge, Alberta|last=Sullivan|first=Pat|date=November 15, 1972|page=15|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-nov-15-1972-773484/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="y21"&gt;{{cite news|title=CAHA won't bow out|newspaper=Brandon Sun|location=Brandon, Manitoba|date=December 12, 1972|last=Sutton|first=Gerry|page=6|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-dec-12-1972-773473/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; He felt that the CAHA deserved its credit for developing the international game, and opening the door for the NHL to play the Soviets. He said that European clubs were interested in playing, as long as sanctioning went through the IIHF, the CAHA or AHAUS.&lt;ref name="y21" /&gt; Canada later played the Soviets again in the [[1974 Summit Series]], which led to the establishment of the [[Canada Cup]] in 1976, and the subsequent return of Team Canada to the World Championships in 1977.&lt;ref name="y81" /&gt;

After the 1972 series, Kryczka gave a directive to the minor ice hockey council of the CAHA to find ways to improve its youth development system, and catch up to the Soviet system.&lt;ref name="y21" /&gt; He looked towards junior hockey as the next big stage for international hockey to be played at the [[IIHF World U20 Championship]] being planned in 1974, and said that Canada and the USA had been collaborating on a [[1975 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships|planned 1975 event]].&lt;ref name="y22"&gt;{{cite news|title=CAHA Leader Lauds Junior Tournament|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press|location=Winnipeg, Manitoba|date=December 13, 1972|last=Svoboda|first=Chuck|page=47|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-dec-13-1972-773441/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that at the junior age level, there would be no concerns over who is or is not a professional player, and that the CAHA agreed to send the reigning Memorial Cup champion to represent Canada at the events.&lt;ref name="y22" /&gt; Kryczka announced in January 1973, that he would not seek reelection as CAHA president.&lt;ref name="y24"&gt;{{cite news |title=briefly...|newspaper=Brandon Sun|location=Brandon, Manitoba|date=January 23, 1973|page=6|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-jan-23-1973-772053/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kryczka's remaining four months as president were occupied by dealing with the WHA competing for junior-aged players, and threatening the CAHA's existing draft and development agreement with the NHL. Kryczka had previously sent a letter to WHA president [[Gary Davidson]], requesting the league honour the age at which players become professionals, as agreed with the NHL.&lt;ref name="y23"&gt;{{cite news|title=CAHA Urges WHA To Follow Rules|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press|location=Winnipeg, Manitoba|date=February 3, 1972|page=50|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/sports-clipping-feb-03-1972-773017/}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 15, 1973, the WHA permitted its teams one month to negotiate and sign any junior, college, or non-professional of amateur draft age, which Kryczka called disruptive to junior hockey.

'''Joe Louis Arena''' is a defunct multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. Completed in 1979 at a cost of $57 million as a replacement for the [[Detroit Olympia]], it sits adjacent to [[Cobo Center]] on the bank of the [[Detroit River]] and is accessible by the [[Joe Louis Arena station]] on the [[Detroit People Mover]]. The venue is named after former heavyweight champion [[boxer]] [[Joe Louis]], who grew up in Detroit.

It was the home of the [[Detroit Red Wings]] of the [[National Hockey League]]&lt;ref name="pistons"/&gt; and the second oldest NHL venue after [[Madison Square Garden]] until the start of the [[2017–18 NHL season]]. Joe Louis Arena is owned by the city of Detroit, and operated by [[Olympia Entertainment]], a subsidiary of team owner [[Ilitch Holdings]].&lt;ref name="holdings"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympiaentertainment.com/about-olympia-entertainment|title=About Olympia Entertainment|accessdate=July 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, the Red Wings hosted their final game at Joe Louis Arena; the venue was succeeded by the new [[Little Caesars Arena]], in [[Midtown Detroit]], beginning with the 2017–18 season. Joe Louis Arena will be demolished, and its site slated for redevelopment. The arena closed on July 30, 2017. Demolition was scheduled to begin in September 2017, but Olympia renewed the lease of the arena with the city and are using it as storage and offices until November 2017. Olympia Entertainment moved out in November 2017, and demolition is planned to begin sometime in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.freep.com/story/money/business/2018/02/03/demolition-detroit-joe-louis-arena/1088694001/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Joe Louis Arena replaced the [[Olympia Stadium]], where the [[Detroit Red Wings]] had played since 1927. The neighborhood around the Olympia had gradually deteriorated, especially after the [[1967 Detroit riot]]. After two murders near the Olympia, Red Wings owner [[Bruce Norris (ice hockey)|Bruce Norris]] seriously considered moving to a proposed arena in suburban [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]]. However, the city of Detroit countered with a proposal for a new riverfront arena at one-third of the rent Pontiac was offering. The package also gave the Red Wings operational control of the arena, nearby [[Cobo Arena]] and nearby lots.

The arena hosted its first event on December 12, 1979: a college basketball game between the [[1979–80 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team|University of Michigan]] and the [[Detroit Titans men's basketball|University of Detroit]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} The Red Wings played their first game at Joe Louis Arena on December 27, 1979, hosting the [[St. Louis Blues]]. The game ended in a 3-2 loss for the Red Wings.&lt;ref name="khan"&gt;{{cite news |title=Red Wings Celebrate 30th Anniversary of Joe Louis Arena|first=Ansar|last=Khan|url=http://www.mlive.com/redwings/index.ssf/2009/12/red_wings_celebrate_30th_anniv.html|work=Michigan Live|date=December 26, 2009|accessdate=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Wings first win at the arena came on December 30, 1979, where they defeated the [[New York Islanders]] 4-2. {{fact|date=November 2018}} Later that first season it hosted the 32nd [[National Hockey League All-Star Game|NHL All-Star Game]] on February 5, 1980,&lt;ref name="nhlallstar"&gt;{{cite web |title=NHL All-Star Game Summaries/Results by Year|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=29166|publisher=National Hockey League|accessdate=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was played before a then-NHL record crowd of 21,002. Joe Louis Arena was the site of the [[1987 NHL Entry Draft]], which marked the first NHL Entry Draft to be held in the United States. In 1980, the arena hosted the [[1980 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] that nominated [[Ronald Reagan]] as the Republican candidate for [[President of the United States]].

[[File:New scoreboard.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The electronic scoreboard at Joe Louis Arena, during a game between the [[Detroit Red Wings]] and the [[Los Angeles Kings]] on March 9, 2007]]
In 1990, color matrix boards were installed on the scoreboard; these were replaced by four Sony [[JumboTron]] video walls three years later, when the matrix boards were placed in the corners of the fascia. In 2006, LED video screens replaced the JumboTrons. The screens debuted November 22, 2006, when the Red Wings played the [[Vancouver Canucks]]. That same day, the arena's West Entrance was named the "[[Gordie Howe]] Entrance" in honor of the legendary Red Wing player, and a bronze statue of Howe was placed inside the entrance. Joe Louis Arena houses 86 premium suites.&lt;ref name="ballparks"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hockey.ballparks.com/NHL/DetroitRedWings/index.htm|title=Joe Louis Arena|work=Ballparks.com|accessdate=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the arena introduced the Comerica Bank Legend's Club, a 181-person private seating location in the arena's southeast corner.&lt;ref name="pistons"&gt;{{cite news |title=Competitive Spirit Makes Mike Ilitch Perfect Fit for Pistons|first=Bob|last=Wojnowski|url=http://detnews.com/article/20100810/OPINION03/8100328/Competitive-spirit-makes-Mike-Ilitch-perfect-fit-for-Pistons|newspaper=[[The Detroit News]]|date=August 10, 2010|accessdate=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Red Wings' final game at Joe Louis Arena was played on April 9, 2017 against the [[New Jersey Devils]]. The Red Wings won 4–1, the final goal in the arena's history coming from Red Wing [[Riley Sheahan]]. It was the second of two he scored, which were also the only goals he scored at all during the 2016–17 season.&lt;ref name="mlive-lastgame"&gt;{{cite web|title=Watch Red Wings' Riley Sheahan end 79-game drought with first goal|url=http://www.mlive.com/redwings/index.ssf/2017/04/watch_red_wings_riley_sheahan.html|website=MLive|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What slump?

The last ticketed event held at The Joe was a [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] Live Event, held on July 29, 2017. The arena will be demolished and replaced with new development at the site in 2019.

==Other tenants and events==

In 1995, the [[Detroit Junior Red Wings]] won the [[Ontario Hockey League]]'s [[J. Ross Robertson Cup]], defeating the [[Guelph Storm]].

Joe Louis Arena hosted college hockey events as part of [[College Hockey at The Joe]], the [[Great Lakes Invitational]], and the [[Big Ten Conference]] hockey tournament in 2015 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Detroit Arena Will Be in Mix to Host Many Events|first=George|last=Sipple|url=http://www.freep.com/story/sports/nhl/red-wings/2014/09/24/detroit-red-wings-arena/16155149/|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=September 24, 2014|accessdate=November 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Detroit Pistons]] of the NBA used the arena for Game 5 of [[1984 NBA Playoffs#(4) Detroit Pistons vs. (5) New York Knicks|their 1984 playoff series]] against the [[New York Knicks]] when the [[Pontiac Silverdome]] was unavailable due to a scheduling conflict. In the game, Pistons star [[Isiah Thomas]] scored 16 points in the final 1:34 of regulation to send the game into overtime before the Pistons lost. The Pistons were forced to return to Joe Louis Arena for 15 games during the 1984–85 season, after the roof of the Silverdome collapsed during a snowstorm.

The National Hockey League's [[Detroit Red Wings]] hosted the [[Stanley Cup Finals]] at the arena six times (1995, 1997, 1998, 2002, 2008, and 2009), and won two of their Stanley Cup championships at Joe Louis Arena in 1997 and 2002. The 1998 Stanley Cup championship was won in Washington, D.C.'s [[MCI Center]] and the 2008 championship was won in Pittsburgh's [[Mellon Arena]]. The Red Wings lost in the Finals to New Jersey in 1995 at the [[Meadowlands Arena]] and lost on home ice in the 2009 Stanley Cup Finals to Pittsburgh.

Joe Louis Arena was the site of the decisive Game 5 of the [[2006 WNBA Finals]] between the [[Sacramento Monarchs]] and [[Detroit Shock]] on September 9, due to [[The Palace of Auburn Hills]] (the Shock's usual home arena) being used for a [[Mariah Carey]] concert on the same day. The Shock won the game 80–75 to clinch the championship.

Former [[Arena Football League]] team the [[Detroit Drive]] also had success during their time at the arena, playing in six consecutive ArenaBowls from 1988 to 1993 and winning four of them. Four of the games ([[ArenaBowl III]], [[ArenaBowl IV]], [[ArenaBowl V]] and [[ArenaBowl VII]]) were played in Joe Louis Arena.

Joe Louis Arena was the site of the [[2013 Skate America|2013 edition]] of the [[Skate America]] figure skating competition. In addition, Joe Louis Arena hosted the [[1994 U.S. Figure Skating Championships]], best known for the pre-competition attack on [[Nancy Kerrigan]] by associates of [[Tonya Harding]].

It was announced on May 7, 2015, that the [[Horizon League Men's Basketball Tournament]] would be held in Detroit beginning in 2016 under a five-year deal; the 2016 and 2017 tournaments were held at Joe Louis Arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moving Horizon League tourney to Detroit is all about branding|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/sports/college/2015/05/07/jla-to-host-horizon-league-basketball-tournament/70957924/|website=Detroit News|publisher=Digital First Media|accessdate=8 May 2015|date=May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joe Louis Arena was also a [[concert]] venue. Until the Palace of Auburn Hills was built in 1988, Joe Louis Arena was Michigan's largest indoor arena for concerts. The first concert to take place there occurred on February 17, 1980,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/tours/800217ticket.jpg|title =February 17th, 1980 Rush ticket stub|date =|access-date =|website =|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160415110222/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/tours/800217ticket.jpg|archivedate =2016-04-15|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which [[Max Webster]] opened for the Canadian rock group [[Rush (band)|Rush]] To compensate for most of Joe Louis Arena's concert business being moved north following the opening of the Palace, the Red Wings began a tradition of playing a home game on [[New Year's Eve]]. Aside from [[Labor unrest|lockouts]] cancelling part or all of the [[1994–95 NHL lockout|1994–95]], [[2004–05 NHL lockout|2004–05]], and [[2012–13 NHL lockout|2012–13]] seasons, the Red Wings left the New Year's Eve date open in years they were scheduled to participate in the [[NHL Winter Classic]]. For New Year's Eve 2012 and 2013, the [[Zac Brown Band]] held concerts at the Joe. The 2012 date was open due to the planned 2013 Winter Classic that was postponed by lockout until [[2014 NHL Winter Classic|2014]].

The '''John F. Kennedy Civic Arena''' (also known as '''Kennedy Arena''') is an indoor [[ice skating]] and [[ice hockey]] arena located in [[Rome, New York]].  The arena was home to the [[Copper City Chiefs]] of the [[North East Hockey League]] during the league's failed 2007–2008 season.  The arena would have been home to the [[Eastern Professional Hockey League (2008)|Eastern Professional Hockey League]] franchise, but the team folded before the season. Since 2010, it has been home to the [[Rome Frenzy]] of the [[Federal Hockey League]].

The John F. Kennedy Civic Arena is one of the [[City of Rome]]’s most popular venues. It was originally constructed in 1963, opened in 1964, and renovated in 2008. The arena hosts numerous figure skating and ice hockey events, as well as learn-to-skate programs for youths. It is home to the Rome Free Academy varsity hockey team, which plays its home games at the 1,200-seat facility.

The arena is a regional facility, used primarily for ice hockey and figure skating from October through March. The primary users are the Ford Stanwix Hockey Association, a not-for-profit youth hockey organization; Rome Free Academy; Rome Catholic High School; a local figure skating club; various local groups and organizations, and the general public.
 
The arena is located at 500 W. Embargo Street in the City of Rome.  It is co-located with the Municipal Pool.

Municipal Pool is a community facility, open from June through early September. It includes a standard-size recreational swimming pool, two water play slides, and a bathhouse with restrooms. It meets the recreational swimming needs of west Rome. 

The arena and pool are served by a large parking lot off of Jay and Embargo Streets with space for more than 150 vehicles. A smaller lot on the arena's west side is used primarily by employees and hockey officials.
  
==Copper City Chiefs==
The Copper City Chiefs semi-professional hockey team was established in 1963 and folded at the end of the 1988 season.  The team played in the Kennedy Arena when it opened in 1964. During the 1960s they played in a league of cities in the state of New York. In the 1970s they played in a league of teams from New England states and New York. In the 1980s, the team played against Senior A, Senior B, and Intermediate Level teams from Ontario, Canada.

The Rome Copper City Chiefs were organized in 1963 under their original name of the Rome Knights, an unchartered recreational organization which was begun to provide athletic recreation in the form of ice hockey to adults who had played minor professional or college ice hockey.  

For six years, until 1971, the Knights played ice hockey by invitation; that is, inviting teams from the surrounding area to Rome's John F. Kennedy Arena.&lt;ref name=Sweeney&gt;Ron Sweeney, interview conducted by Robert Kirchner, Rome, New York, 21 May 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; The Knights were not part of any formal league at this time, nor were they affiliated with a National Hockey League (NHL) or professional hockey team.  However, during their existence many of their rostered players had some minor professional experience.  The Knights engaged in strictly invitational hockey games, usually paying expenses of the opposing team so they would play in Rome.  This was gradually expanded over the years to include teams from as far away as Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the Canadian province of Ontario.  

In the middle 1960s, interest in the Knights ice hockey team increased, primarily as an overflow from the [[Clinton Comets]] of the Eastern Hockey League, a professional farm team for the New York Rangers of the NHL.  The presence of former Clinton Comets, along with the Knights' physical style of play, stimulated the general population's interest in attending Rome Knights hockey games.  

In 1971 the Rome Knights changed their name to the Copper City Chiefs. Rome is referred to as the Copper City, after the Revere Manufacturing Plant that once produced copperware in the city through the 1970s. 

The Rome Copper City Chiefs continued to play invitational games and increased their following in and around central New York.  In 1971 the Clinton Comets folded. This brought more professional players to the Chiefs and added to the increased attendance at their games. A new general manager took control of the team and instituted a publicity campaign to further increase game attendance and provide further incentives for local business sponsorship.

During the 1972–1973 season, the Chiefs' general manager met with managers of opposing teams, and they decided to form the Northeastern United States Hockey League. This was composed of teams from upstate New York, parts of Massachusetts, and northern New Jersey.  League play, coupled with increased advertising and publicity, helped increase attendance, but also required the Chiefs to play in more away games.  As added incentive for fans to attend their games, schedules of play were arranged for the 1973-1974 season to give maximum home play to teams that had a traditional adversary relationship.  The league was successful and attendance between 1973 and 1975 increased to an overall average of 900 per game.  End-of-season league play-offs were standing room only.  But involvement in the league, which was never formalized enough to support and enforce the schedules (i.e., no penalty for missed games, forfeitures), also created additional expenses for all the teams. The league folded as teams withdrew due to financial hardships.&lt;ref&gt;Rome (New York) ''Daily Sentinel'', 11 February 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

During their 25 years of existence, supporter participation fluctuated, peaking during 1973-1975. Those seasons showed average game attendances of approximately 900.&lt;ref name=Sweeney/&gt; After the 1975 season, participation gradually declined, culminating in the 1984-1985 season's average attendance of 250.&lt;ref&gt;David Adams, interview conducted by Robert Kirchner, Rome, New York, 2 June 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renovations==
After an almost $3.5 million renovation, Kennedy Arena was officially dedicated on January 30, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romenewyork.com/organization.asp?orgid=193 J. F. Kennedy Arena Renovation Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821024117/http://www.romenewyork.com/organization.asp?orgid=193 |date=2007-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The renovation raised the [[seating capacity]] from 800 to 1,200. Other improvements included a longer ice rink; new boards, glass, and safety net; new bleachers across the back end of the arena; four new locker rooms; upgrades to locker rooms; and an enhanced heating and lighting system.&lt;ref&gt;http://when-in-rome.com/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; Improvements were also made to the warming room and concession area, to allow for more and better off-season use of the facility, including usage by teens and seniors.  

The shell of the building remains relatively unchanged from its original construction in 1963.

'''Kaiser Permanente Arena''' is an [[indoor arena]] located in [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]], in the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]].

==History==
A $3.5 million loan by the city of Santa Cruz was given to the Warriors to build their arena, with the 1.5-acre lot being provided by the Santa Cruz Seaside Company, owner of the [[Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk]]. Construction ran for 78 days between September and December 2012, halted just a few times by rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/localnews/ci_22244068/ready-go-sc-warriors-arena-passes-inspections-city?source=pkg|title=Ready to go: Santa Cruz Warriors arena passes inspections, city reminds fans about parking for home opener|publisher=|accessdate=January 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arena was opened on December 23, 2012, with a victory by the Warriors against the [[Bakersfield Jam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=May|first=Jacob|title=NBA D-League: Santa Cruz Warriors slam Jam in inaugural home game|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/localnews/ci_22252831/nba-d-league-santa-cruz-warriors-slam-jam|accessdate=December 24, 2012|newspaper=Santa Cruz Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By April 2014, Kaiser Permanente Arena had 39 sell-outs out of the 53 Warriors home games. In the meantime, the Warriors reached two D-League finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/santacruz/ci_25624995/love-game-bond-between-warrior-city-surprising-success?source=nav|title=Love of the Game: Bond between Warriors, city a surprising success|publisher=|accessdate=January 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arena has a seating capacity of 2,505.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hayes |first1=Reggie |title=Untitled |work=News-Sentinel |date=May 23, 2015 |location=Fort Wayne, Indiana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States men's national basketball team]] hosted their [[FIBA]] [[FIBA Basketball World Cup|World Cup]] qualifying first-round games at Kaiser Permanente Arena on February 23, 2018 against [[Cuba men's national basketball team|Cuba]] and on February 26, 2018 against [[Puerto Rico men's national basketball team|Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mad Ants' Trey McKinney-Jones added to USA roster |work=News-Sentinel |date=February 8, 2018 |location=Fort Wayne, Indiana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arena also serves as the home of [[UC Santa Cruz]] men's and women's basketball games. In November 2017, UC Santa Cruz hosted a [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] basketball tournament at Kaiser Permanente Arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bearcats Squash Banana Slugs in Overtime, 56-52, at UCSC Thanksgiving Classic |work=US Official News |agency=Willamette University |publisher=Plus Media Solutions |date=November 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium currently is home to the Loyalsock Lancers football, boys and girls soccer teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://pafootballnews.com/15-loyalsock-township-lancers/ | title = Loyalsock Athletics - Kenneth M Robbins Stadium | date = 16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium is owned and operated by the [[Loyalsock Township School District]].

== History==
Formerly called Lancer Stadium was opened in 1971. And has been remodeled multiple times in its history. Including new bleachers added in late 1990s, terf added in 2011. The turf was donated after the sports [[dome]] in [[Muncy, Pennsylvania]] collapsed after large amounts of snow on the roof caused the collapse. Originally designed as indoor turf it was transplanted at Kenneth M. Robbins Stadium.

In 2017, school board and township members announced plans on replacing the turf in 2018. On December 23, 2017 officials announced the new terf work will begin in March 2018 and be complete by August 1, 2018.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

It is used primarily for basketball, and is home to the Lobos de [[Universidad Autónoma de Durango]]-Mazatlan basketball team.  It is also used for [[concerts]], [[boxing]] and [[lucha libre]]. It was one of the original buildings of the UAD's Mazatlan campus which was established in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://prezi.com/ncqczszcchgy/curso-de-induccion-ius-uad-campus-mazatlan/ Curso de induccion IUS UAD Campus Mazatlan at prezi.com]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first events at the arena was a concert by [[Lorena Herrera]], a Mazatlan native.  Until the [[Mazatlan International Center]] was built, it was the largest indoor venue in the city.  
Concert capacity of the Lobodome is around 4,000.  Despite its name, the arena's roof is arch-shaped.  

The Lobodome was the site of an exhibition basketball game featuring [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] stars on October 8, 2011, during the [[2011 NBA Lockout|NBA Lockout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mexicotoday.org/article/charlotte-bobcats-forward-eduardo-najera-brings-nba-stars-goodwill-trip-mexico |title=Charlotte Bobcats Forward, Eduardo Najera, Brings NBA Stars on Goodwill Trip to Mexico &amp;#124; Mexico Current News and Mexico Current Events, all the Latest News on Mexico Today |publisher=Mexicotoday.org |date=October 13, 2011 |accessdate=November 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the aforementioned, other national and international stars, including [[Thalía]], [[Gloria Trevi]], [[Paulina Rubio]], [[Los Tigres del Norte]], [[Rocio Durcal]], [[Maribel Guardia]], [[Vicente Fernandez]], [[Pepe Aguilar]], [[Jenni Rivera]], and even [[Air Supply]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hotelplayamazatlan.com/mx/event/air-supply-en-mazatlan/ Air Supply en Mazatlan]&lt;/ref&gt; have performed here.

'''RK Bjelovar''' (Rukometni Klub Bjelovar) is a [[team handball]] club from [[Bjelovar]], [[Croatia]] formed in 1955. The club currently competes in the [[Croatian Second League of Handball]] (North) and the [[Croatian Handball Cup]].

During [[Communist Yugoslavia]], the club was known as '''Partizan''', named after the [[Second World War]]'s [[Yugoslav Partisans]]. After Croatian independence in 1991, the current name was adopted. Despite being the most successful club in Yugoslavia, it has had little success since the 1980 season and has been thoroughly eclipsed by [[RK Zagreb]] in modern Croatian handball.

'''Ski jumping''' is a [[winter sport]] in which competitors aim to achieve the longest jump after descending from a specially designed [[ramp]] on their [[ski]]s. Along with jump length, competitor's style and other factors affect the final score. Ski jumping was first contested in Norway in the late 19th century, and later spread through Europe and North America in the early 20th century. Along with [[cross-country skiing]], it constitutes the traditional group of [[Nordic skiing]] disciplines.

The [[ski jumping hill|ski jumping venue]], commonly referred to as a ''hill'', consists of the jumping ramp (''in-run''), take-off table, and a landing hill. Each jump is evaluated according to the distance traveled and the style performed. The distance score is related to the [[construction point]] (also known as the ''K-point''), which is a line drawn in the landing area and serves as a "target" for the competitors to reach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/olympics/ski-jumping-and-nordic-combined-winter-olympics-spectators-guide|title=Ski Jumping Winter Olympics Spectator’s Guide by Ron Judd (13/12/2009)|publisher=[[The Seattle Times]]|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The score of each judge evaluating the style can reach a maximum of 20 points. The [[ski jumping techniques|jumping technique]] has evolved over the years, from jumps with the parallel skis with both arms pointing forwards, to the "[[ski jumping techniques#V-style|V-style]]", which is widely used today.

Ski jumping has been included at the [[Winter Olympics]] since 1924 and at the [[FIS Nordic World Ski Championships]] since 1925. Women's participation in the sport began in the 1990s, while the first women's event at the Olympics has been held in 2014. All major ski jumping competitions are organised by the [[International Ski Federation]]. [[Stefan Kraft]] holds the official record for the [[list of the longest ski jumps|world's longest ski jump]] with {{convert|253.5|m|ft}}, set on the [[ski flying]] hill in [[Vikersundbakken|Vikersund]] in 2017.&lt;ref name="wr2017"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/sports/articles/2017-03-18/kraft-sets-world-record-in-ski-jumping|title=Kraft Sets World Record in Ski Jumping|accessdate=18 March 2017|date=18 March 2017|publisher=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ski jumping can also be performed in the summer on an in-run where the tracks are made from porcelain and the grass on the slope is covered with water-soaked plastic. The highest level summer competition is the [[FIS Ski Jumping Grand Prix]], contested since 1994.

== History ==
[[Image:Rye Olaf.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Olaf Rye]]]]

Like most of the [[Nordic skiing]] disciplines, the first ski jumping competitions were held in [[Norway]] in the 19th century, although there is evidence of ski jumping in the late 18th century. The recorded origins of the first ski jump trace back to 1808, when [[Olaf Rye]] reached {{convert|9.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}. [[Sondre Norheim]], who is regarded as the "father" of the modern ski jumping, won the first-ever ski jumping competition with prizes, which was held in [[Høydalsmo]] in 1866.

The first larger ski jumping competition was held on [[Husebyrennet]] hill in [[Oslo]], Norway, in 1875. Due to its poor infrastructure and the weather conditions, in 1892 the event was moved to [[Holmenkollen]], which is today still one of the main ski jumping events in the season.

In the late 19th century, Sondre Norheim and Nordic skier [[Karl Hovelsen]] immigrated to the United States and started developing the sport in that country. In 1924, ski jumping was featured at the [[1924 Winter Olympics]] in [[Chamonix]], France. The sport has been featured at the every Olympics since.

Ski jumping was brought to Canada by Norwegian immigrant [[Nels Nelsen]]. Starting with his example in 1915 until the late 1960s, annual ski jumping competitions were held on Mount Revelstoke — the ski hill Nelsen designed — the longest period of any Canadian ski jumping venue. Revelstoke's was the biggest natural ski jump hill in Canada and internationally recognized as one of the best in North America. The length and natural grade of its {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=on}} hill made possible jumps of over {{convert|60| m|ft|abbr=on}}—the longest in Canada. It was also the only hill in Canada where world ski jumping records were set, in 1916, 1921, 1925, 1932, and 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/bc/revelstoke/decouvrir-discover/hist/ski |title=The History of Skiing on Mount Revelstoke |access-date=2017-10-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018071701/https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/bc/revelstoke/decouvrir-discover/hist/ski |archive-date=2017-10-18 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, the origins of the [[ski flying]] began in [[Planica]], Slovenia, where [[Josef Bradl]] became the first competitor in history to jump over {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}. At the same venue, the first official jump over {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} was achieved in 1994, when [[Toni Nieminen]] landed at 203 metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skisprungschanzen.com/EN/Ski+Jumps/SLO-Slovenia/Planica/0475-Letalnica/|title=Letalnica, Planica|publisher=skisprungschanzen.com|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964 in [[Zakopane]], Poland, the large hill event was introduced at the [[FIS Nordic World Ski Championships]]. In the same year, the normal hill event was included on the Olympic programme at the [[1964 Winter Olympics]]. The team event was added later, at the [[1988 Winter Olympics]].

== Rules ==

=== Hills ===
{{main|Ski jumping hill}}

[[Image:Ski jumping hill profile.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Model of a ski jumping hill. {{nowrap|A-B – point of departure}}; {{nowrap|t – take-off zone}}; {{nowrap|HS – total hill length}}; {{nowrap|P-L – landing area}}; {{nowrap|K – K-point}}]]
A ski jumping hill is located on a steep slope, and it consists of the jumping ramp (''in-run''), take-off table, and a landing hill. Competitors glide down from a common point at the top of the in-run, achieving considerable speeds at the take-off table, where they take off with help of speed and their own leap. While airborne, they maintain an aerodynamic position with their bodies and skis, that would allow them to maximize the length of the jump. The landing slope is constructed so that the jumper's trajectory is near-parallel with it, and the athlete's relative height to the ground is gradually lost, allowing for a gentle and safe landing. The landing space is followed by an ''out-run'', a substantial flat or counter-inclined area that permits the skier to safely slow down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fis-ski.com/mm/Document/documentlibrary/Skijumping/03/20/22/StandardsfortheConstructionofJumpingHills2012_english_English.pdf |title=Standards for the Construction of Jumping Hills - 2012 | publisher=[[International Ski Federation]] |accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The out-run area is fenced and surrounded by a public auditorium.

The slopes are classified according to the distance that the competitors travel in the air, between the end of the table and the landing. Each hill has a [[construction point]] (''K-point''), which serves as a "target" that the competitors should reach. The classification of the hills are as follows:&lt;ref name="rulesFIS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fis-ski.com/mm/Document/documentlibrary/Skijumping/03/19/96/ICR_JP_2012_Final_English.pdf |title=THE INTERNATIONAL SKI COMPETITION RULES (ICR)|publisher=[[International Ski Federation]] |accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{|class=wikitable

|-
| Medium hill || 45–74 m || 50–84 m
|-

=== Scoring system ===
Competitors are ranked according to a numerical score obtained by adding up components based on distance, style, inrun length (gate factor) and wind conditions. In the individual event, the scores from each skier's two competition jumps are combined to determine the winner. 

Distance score depends on the hill's K-point. For K-90 and K-120 competitions, the K-point is set at 90 metres and 120 metres, respectively. Competitors are awarded 60 points (normal and large hills) and 120 points (flying hills) if they land on the K-point. For every metre beyond the K-point, the competitor is awarded extra points; the typical value is 2 points per metre in small hills, 1.8 points in large hills and 1.2 points in ski flying hills. A competitor's distance is measured between the takeoff and the point where the feet came in full contact with the landing slope (for abnormal landings, touchpoint of one foot, or another body part is considered). Jumps are measured with accuracy of 0.5 metres for all competitions. &lt;ref name=rules&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fis-ski.com/mm/Document/documentlibrary/Skijumping/03/19/96/ICRSkiJumping2017_clean_English.pdf | title = The International Ski Competition Rules (ICR): Book III – Ski Jumping | date = October 2017 | access-date = March 19, 2018 | publisher = [[International Ski Federation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|64–65}}

[[Image:Telemark landing Miyanomori.jpg|thumb|Telemark landing]]

During the competition, five judges are based in a tower to the side of the expected landing point. They can award up to 20 points each for jumping style, based on keeping the skis steady during flight, balance, optimal body position, and landing. The highest and lowest style scores are disregarded, with the remaining three scores added to the distance score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/02/why-does-olympic-ski-jumping-need-judges/283875/|title=Why Does Olympic Ski Jumping Need Judges?|date=17 February 2014|accessdate=14 March 2017|publisher=theatlantic.com|author=Jim Pagels}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gate and wind factors were introduced by the 2009 rules, to allow fairer comparison of results for a scoring compensation for variable outdoor conditions. Aerodynamics and take-off speed are important variables that affect the jump length, and if weather conditions change during a competition, the conditions will not be the same for all competitors. Gate factor is an adjustment made when the inrun (or start gate) length is adjusted from the initial position in order to provide optimal take-off speed. Since higher gates result in higher take-off speeds, and therefore present an advantage to competitors, points are subtracted when the starting gate is moved up, and added when the gate is lowered. An advanced calculation also determines compensation points for the actual unequal wind conditions at the time of the jump. These points are added or withdrawn from the original scores of the individual jump according to the wind conditions; when there is back wind, the points are added, and when there is front wind, the points are subtracted. Wind speed and direction are measured at five different points based on average value, which is determined before every competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsjusa.com/ski-jumping-101/ |title=Ski Jumping 101 |publisher=Women's Ski Jumping USA |access-date = March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If two or more competitors finish the competition with the same number of points, they are given the same placing and receive same prizes.&lt;ref name="rulesFIS"/&gt;
Ski jumpers below the minimum safe body mass index are penalized with a shorter maximum ski length, reducing the aerodynamic lift they can achieve. These rules have been credited with stopping the most severe cases of underweight athletes, but some competitors still lose weight to maximize the distance they can achieve.&lt;ref name="SlidingScale"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/12/sports/olympics/12skijump.html|title=For Ski Jumpers, a Sliding Scale of Weight, Distance and Health|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=11 February 2010 | first = Jeré | last = Longman | date = February 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to prevent an unfair advantage due to a "sailing" effect of the ski jumping suit, material, thickness and relative size of the suit are regulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcolympics.com/news/ski-jumping-101-equipment|title=Ski jumping 101: Equipment| date = June 19, 2017 | work=NBC Olympics|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==
{{for|details|Ski jumping techniques}}

[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-61623-0009, Harald Pfeffer.jpg|thumb|Kongsberger technique]]
Each jump is divided into four parts: in-run, take-off (jump), flight, and landing.

By using the [[ski jumping techniques#V-style|V-style]], firstly pioneered by Swedish ski jumper [[Jan Boklöv]] in the mid-1980s,&lt;ref name="Techniques"/&gt; modern skiers are able to exceed the distance of the take-off hill by about 10% compared to the previous technique with parallel skis.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Previous techniques included the [[Ski jumping techniques#Kongsberger|Kongsberger technique]], the [[Ski jumping techniques#D.C3.A4scher.2Fparallel|Däescher technique]] and the [[Ski jumping techniques#Windisch|Windisch technique]].&lt;ref name="Techniques"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skijumping-info.com/info-section/the-history/80-info/107-techniques.html|title=Development of ski jumping technique|publisher=skijumping-info.com|accessdate=15 January 2012|archive-date=29 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129035059/http://www.skijumping-info.com/info-section/the-history/80-info/107-techniques.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the mid-1960s, the ski jumper came down the in-run of the hill with both arms pointing forwards. This changed when the Däscher technique was pioneered by [[Andreas Däscher]] in the 1950s, as a modification of the Kongsberger and Windisch techniques. A lesser-used technique as of 2017 is the H-style which is essentially a combination of the parallel and V-styles, in which the skis are spread very wide apart and held parallel in an "H" shape. It is prominently used by [[Domen Prevc]].

Skiers are required to touch the ground in the Telemark landing style ({{lang-no|telemarksnedslag}}), named after the Norwegian county of [[Telemark]]. This involves the landing with one foot in front of the other with knees slightly bent, mimicking the style of [[Telemark skiing]]. Failure to execute a Telemark landing leads to the deduction of style points, issued by the judges.&lt;ref name="rulesFIS"/&gt;&lt;ref name = Kunnskapsforlagets&gt;''Kunnskapsforlagets idrettsleksikon'' (Encyclopedia of Sports), Oslo: Kunnskapsforlaget, 1990. {{ISBN|82-573-0408-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major competitions ==

All major ski jumping competitions are organized by the [[International Ski Federation]].

The large hill ski jumping event was included at the [[Winter Olympic Games]] for the first time in [[1924 Winter Olympics|1924]], and has been contested at every Winter Olympics since then.&lt;ref name="olympichistory"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/winter-olympics-ski-jumping.html|title=Winter Olympics: Ski Jumping|publisher=infoplease.com|author1=John Gettings|author2=Christine Frantz|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The normal hill event was added in [[1964 Winter Olympics|1964]]. Since [[1992 Winter Olympics|1992]], the normal hill event is contested at the K-90 size hill; previously, it was contested at the K-60 hill.&lt;ref name="olympichistory"/&gt; Women's debuted at the Winter Olympics in [[2014 Winter Olympics|2014]].&lt;ref name="womenolympics"/&gt;

The [[FIS Ski Jumping World Cup]] has been contested since the [[1979–80 FIS Ski Jumping World Cup|1979–80]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fis-ski.com/ski-jumping/news-multimedia/news/article=facts-figures-about-the-world-cup-sapporo.html|title=Facts &amp; Figures about the World Cup in Sapporo|date=23 January 2014|accessdate=14 March 2017|publisher=[[International Ski Federation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It runs between November and March every season, and consists of 25–30 competitions at most prestigious hills across Europe, United States and Japan. Competitors are awarded a fixed number of points in each event according to their ranking, and the overall winner is the one with most accumulated points. [[FIS Ski Flying World Cup]] is contested as a sub-event of the World Cup, and competitors collect only the points scored at ski flying hills from the calendar.

The ski jumping at the [[FIS Nordic World Ski Championships]] was first contested in 1925. The team event was introduced in 1982, while the women's event was first held in 2009.

The [[FIS Ski Flying World Championships]] was first contested in 1972 in [[Planica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slovenia.si/slovenia/society/sport/winning-disciplines/planica-cradle-of-slovenian-sport/|title=Planica – cradle of Slovenian sport|accessdate=14 March 2017|publisher=slovenia.si|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315003428/http://www.slovenia.si/slovenia/society/sport/winning-disciplines/planica-cradle-of-slovenian-sport/|archive-date=2017-03-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Four Hills Tournament]] has been contested since the 1952–53 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vierschanzentournee.com/en/ergebnisse/tourneesieger |title=All Winners |website=Four Hills TournamentĐĐ&lt;/ref&gt; It is contested around the New Year's Day at four venues – two in Germany ([[Oberstdorf]] and [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]]) and two in Austria ([[Innsbruck]] and [[Bischofshofen]]), which are also scored for the World Cup. Those events are traditionally held in a slightly different format than other World Cup events (first round is held as a knockout event between 25 pairs of jumpers), and the overall winner is determined by adding up individual scores from every jump.

Other competitions organised by the International Ski Federation include the [[FIS Ski Jumping Grand Prix]] (held in summer), [[FIS Ski Jumping Continental Cup|Continental Cup]], [[FIS Cup (ski jumping)|FIS Cup]], [[FIS Race (ski jumping)|FIS Race]], and [[FIS Ski Jumping Alpen Cup|Alpen Cup]].

== Women's participation ==

In January 1863 in [[Trysil]], Norway, at that time 16 years old Norwegian Ingrid Olsdatter Vestby, became the first-ever known female ski jumper, who participated in the competition. Her distance is not recorded.&lt;ref name="Haarstad"&gt;Haarstad, Kjell (1993): Skisportens oppkomst i Norge. Trondheim: Tapir.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women began competing at the high level since the [[2004–05 FIS Ski Jumping Continental Cup|2004–05 Continental Cup]] season.&lt;ref name="women"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/mattslater/2009/03/why_its_time_to_let_ladies_fly.html|title=Why it's time to let ladies fly|author=Matt Slater|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2 March 2009|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Ski Federation]] organized three women's team events in this competition and so far the only team events in history of women's ski jumping.

Women's made a premiere [[FIS Nordic World Ski Championships]] performance in [[FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2009|2009]] in [[Liberec]].&lt;ref name="women"/&gt; The first world champion became American ski jumper [[Lindsey Van]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dnevnik.si/1042246241|title=Liberec: Svetovna prvakinja v skoki Lindsey Van, Manja Pograjc zasedla 24. mesto|publisher=dnevnik.si|date=20 February 2009|accessdate=14 March 2017|language=Slovenian|author=(sta)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2011–12 FIS Ski Jumping World Cup|2011–12]] season, women competed for the first time in the [[FIS Ski Jumping World Cup|World Cup]]. The first event was held on 3 December 2011 at [[Lysgårdsbakken]] at normal hill in 
[[Lillehammer]], Norway. The first-ever female World Cup winner was [[Sarah Hendrickson]],&lt;ref name="sarah1stwin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/olympics/skijumping/story/_/id/7309917/us-teen-sarah-hendrickson-captures-inaugural-women-world-cup-ski-jump|title=Sarah Hendrickson, 17, wins ski jump|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=3 December 2011|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who also became the inaugural women's World Cup overall champion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ladies-skijumping.com/wiadomosci/352/Zao-Sarah-Hendrickson-wins-overall-World-Cup/|title=Zao: Sarah Hendrickson wins overall World Cup|author1=Stefan Diaz|author2=Egon Theiner|publisher=ladies-skijumping.com|date=3 March 2012|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, women had only competed in [[FIS Ski Jumping Continental Cup|Continental Cup]] seasons.

=== 2014: Olympic Games ===
In 2006, the International Ski Federation proposed that women could compete at the [[2010 Winter Olympics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fis-ski.com/uk/news/pressreleases/pressreleases2006/gacongressdecisions.html|title=FIS MEDIA INFO: Decisions of the 45th International Ski Congress in Vilamoura/Algarve|publisher=[[International Ski Federation]]|accessdate=14 November 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130123053734/http://www.fis-ski.com/uk/news/pressreleases/pressreleases2006/gacongressdecisions.html|archivedate=23 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the proposal was rejected by the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] because of the low number of athletes and participating countries at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/11/28/sports/ME_SPT_OLY_IOC_Meetings.php|title=IOC approves skicross; rejects women's ski jumping|publisher=iht.com|accessdate=15 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of fifteen competitive female ski jumpers later filed a suit against the [[Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games]] on the grounds that it violated the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] since men were competing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/content/view/16139/|title=Female Ski Jumpers Seem Olympic Inclusion|publisher=Epoch Times|accessdate=14 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/1109/p17s03-ussc.html|title=Why women can't ski jump in the Winter Olympics|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suit failed, with the judge ruling that the situation was not governed by the charter.

A further milestone was reached when women's ski jumping was included as part of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] at normal hill event. The first Olympic champion was [[Carina Vogt]].&lt;ref name="womenolympics"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/winter-olympics/26057176|title=Sochi 2014: Carina Vogt wins women’s ski jumping gold|author=Rob Hodgetts|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=11 February 2014|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Record jumps ==

[[File:VikersundbakkenWorld Cup Ski flying 2011.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The all-time longest jump was achieved in Vikersund in 2017.]]

Since 1936, when the first jump beyond {{convert|100|m|ft}} was made, all world records in the sport have been made in the discipline of [[ski flying]]. As of March 2017, the official world record for the longest ski jump is {{convert|253.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}, set by [[Stefan Kraft]] at [[Vikersundbakken]] in [[Vikersund]], Norway. Two years prior, also in Vikersund, [[Dimitry Vassiliev]] reached {{convert|254|m|ft|abbr=on}} but fell upon landing; his jump is unofficially the longest ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/blogs/world-of-sport/ski-jump-world-record-broken-for-second-time-in-two-days-as-anders-fannemel-flies-to-glory-164459525.html|author=[[Eurosport]]|title=Ski jump world record broken for second time in two days as Anders Fannemel flies to glory|date=15 February 2015|accessdate=15 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217025612/https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/blogs/world-of-sport/ski-jump-world-record-broken-for-second-time-in-two-days-as-anders-fannemel-flies-to-glory-164459525.html|archivedate=17 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniela Iraschko-Stolz]] has held the women's world record of {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} since 2003.

=== Perfect-score jumps ===

Those who have managed to show a perfect jump, which means that all five judges attributed the maximum style score of 20 points for their jumps. [[Kazuyoshi Funaki]], [[Sven Hannawald]] and [[Wolfgang Loitzl]] were attributed 4x20 (plus another 19.5) style score points for their second jump, thus receiving nine times the maximum score of 20 points within one competition. [[Kazuyoshi Funaki]] is the only one in history who achieved this more than once. So far only seven jumpers are recorded to have achieved this score in total of ten times:

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Sports Illustrated'' cover jinx}}
[[File:Sports Illustrated cover January 21 2002.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The magazine cover for the January 21, 2002 issue of ''Sports Illustrated''.]]

The '''''Sports Illustrated'' so-called cover jinx''' is an [[urban legend]] that states that individuals or teams who appear on the cover of the ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine will subsequently be [[jinx]]ed (experience bad luck).

==Explanations==
A common explanation for the perceived effect is that athletes are generally featured on the cover after an exceptionally good performance, which might be an [[outlier]] compared to their usual level of performance. Therefore, their future performance is likely to display [[regression toward the mean]] and be less impressive by comparison.&lt;ref&gt;Goldacre, Ben. ''Bad Science''. Page 39. London: Fourth Estate, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This decline in performance would then be misperceived as being related to, or even possibly caused by, the appearance on the magazine cover.

Most athletes that seemed to suffer the jinx most typically suffered because of an injury to their body, or some other bad luck following their appearance. One prime candidate for this explanation is [[Eddie Mathews]] who suffered a broken hand while the team's nine game winning streak came to a close following the cover.  In this case, the odds are that a player will suffer an injury while playing any given sport with injuries a given in a physical contact sport such American football or baseball which is what Mathews played.  Even injuries in individual sports such as skiing can fall under this explanation as it is common to make a bad move in this sport and get caught up in a massive mistake of the athlete's own doing which results in injury.  Finally, winning and losing streaks come to a close in all sports and this includes Milwaukee's nine-game winning streak in 1954.  This makes the [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|1972 Miami Dolphins]] perfect season, [[2007 New England Patriots season|2007 New England Patriots]] perfect regular season, and the [[2008 Detroit Lions season|2008 Detroit Lions]] winless season all the more remarkable.

''SI'' addressed its own opinions on the alleged cover jinx in a 2002 issue that featured a [[black cat]] on its cover.&lt;ref&gt;

==Notable contradictions to so-called curse==
While the list of "examples" of the so-called jinx may be extensive, records contradict the existence of a curse.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|title=Sports Illustrated|url=http://i.cnn.net/si/si_online/covers/images/1984/1210_large.jpg|publisher=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Michael Jordan]] holds the cover record of 50 appearances, none of which hindered his success.

*[[Muhammad Ali]] appeared on [[Sports Illustrated#Cover history|40 covers]], experienced a typical array of luck in his professional and personal life, and was named the ''Sports Illustrated'' [[Sports Illustrated#Sportsman of the Century|Sportsman of the Century]], owing to skill, not luck.

*[[Vince Young]] also discredited the ''Sports Illustrated'' jinx by appearing on the cover of ''Sports Illustrated'' twice during Texas' National Championship season.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0201/25/ltm.01.html|title=Is Their (sic) a "Sports Illustrated" Cover Jinx?|publisher=[[CNN]]|author=[[Paula Zahn]]|date=2002-01-25|accessdate=2007-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Emmitt Smith]] appeared on the cover the same week the [[Dallas Cowboys]] won [[Super Bowl XXVIII]]. In the ''[[America's Game]]'' documentary, Smith recalled that he adamantly wanted off the cover for fear of the jinx. Regardless, the Cowboys went on to win their second consecutive title of the 1990s, and fourth in team history.

*[[Tony Dorsett]] appeared on the cover under the title of "Heading for the Heisman" in 1976 and indeed won the [[Heisman Trophy]] that year.

* [[Andrew McCutchen]] was featured on a September 2013 cover, during a season in which he later won the [[National League MVP Award]] and led the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] to their first playoff berth in twenty years.

* The [[2013 Seattle Seahawks season|2013 Seattle Seahawks]] appeared on a September 2013 cover in which the magazine predicted a [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] win for the team; the Seahawks won the Super Bowl the following February.

* [[George Springer]] was featured  on the cover of the June 30, 2014 issue, which also predicted that the [[Houston Astros]] would win the [[2017 World Series]]; not only did the Astros win the World Series in 2017, but  Springer was named MVP of that series.

*[[Stephen Curry]] was featured on two consecutive May 2015 covers and led the [[Golden State Warriors]] to their first NBA title in forty years.

* [[Kyrie Irving]] was featured on the June 6, 2016 cover and led the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] to their first NBA title in franchise history.

* [[Usain Bolt]] was featured on the July 18, 2016 cover promoting his quest as the fastest human ever and won gold in the 100, 200, and 4x100 meter relay at the 2016 Rio Olympics.

* The [[Chicago Cubs]] appeared on the October 10, 2016 cover in which the magazine predicted a [[2016 World Series]] win for the team; indeed, the Cubs won the World Series. [[Lamar Jackson]] appeared on the September 26, 2016 issue and later won the [[Heisman Trophy]] that year.

==Notable incidences==

*May 1, 1967: [[Chaparral Cars|Chaparral]]'s [[Jim Hall (racing driver)|Jim Hall]], who appeared along with his Chaparral 2F on the cover, would go on to suffer from a number of mishaps for the rest of the decade.

In [[1969 Can-Am season|1969]], his Chaparral 2H suffered from a poor season and in [[1970 Can-Am season|1970]], the innovative 2J fan-car, despite its performance, proved to be unreliable and following protests from competitors, was banned from competition at the end of the season. Hall and his team had to wait until the end of the decade for any success.
*June 19, 1967: The boxing success of welterweight "Gypsy" Joe Harris, who lost sight in his right eye at age 11, earned him cover recognition&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.si.com/vault/cover/1967/06/19 SI.com vault], 19 June 1967 cover (accessed 15 June 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; despite the handicap which, at the time, had not yet been publicized nor discovered by boxing regulators. However, on 11 October 1968 (about two months after his first career loss in 25 career bouts) a routine doctor's examination of inflammation in the eye revealed his visual impairment. Stripped of his boxing license and unable to hold gainful employment thereafter, Harris fell into a life of drug and alcohol abuse before dying in 1990 at age 44.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-02-26/sports/8903230019_1_pennsylvania-state-athletic-commission-street-fight-gypsy-joe-harris "Gypsy Joe Came Close To A Title, But Then..."], Chicago Tribune, 26 February 1989 (accessed 15 June 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.philly.com/1990-03-07/sports/25903674_1_street-fight-emile-griffith-eye "Gypsy Joe Harris, Boxer, Dead At 44"], Philly.com, 7 March 1990 (accessed 15 June 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

The article prominently mentions [[Jack Hamilton (baseball)|Jack Hamilton]] of the [[California Angels]], with [[Washington Senators (1961–71)|Washington Senators]] manager [[Gil Hodges]] opining that Hamilton throws "the most flagrant spitter I ever saw ... It was the worst exhibition I've seen in baseball ... He made a farce of the game. Everyone knows that 90% of the pitchers in our league have thrown a spitter at one time or another, but none continues to break the rule like Hamilton."&lt;ref&gt;Weiskopf, Herman.

Conigliaro (who would appear with his grotesquely blackened eye on the 22 June 1970 cover&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.si.com/vault/cover/1970/06/22 SI.com vault], cover image for 22 June 1970 issue (accessed 16 June 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;), was knocked out of action for the [[1967 World Series]], missed all of 1968, and continued to struggle with vision problems before retiring at age 30. The incident also scarred Hamilton, who would never again pitch inside so aggressively against hitters and lost effectiveness before leaving the sport less than two years later. Hamilton has steadfastly denied that the pitch to Conigliaro was a spitball despite contradictory statements from his own teammates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cantstopthebleeding.com/45-years-ago-the-pitched-that-changed-tony-cs-life 45 Years Ago : The Pitch That Changed Tony C’s Life], cantstopthebleeding.com, 18 August 2012 (accessed 16 June 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurdle would go on to hit just .264 with seven home runs and 56 runs batted in while appearing in 133 games in 1978.  Hurdle would not appear in a single [[MLB All-Star Game]] in his ten years as a player in [[Major League Baseball]] and compiled a lifetime batting average of just .259 with 32 home runs in 193 runs batted in for the Royals, [[Cincinnati Reds]], [[New York Mets]], and [[St. Louis Cardinals]] (he did, however, make an appearance in the World Series in 1980 with the Royals).

*October 5, 1987: [[Lloyd Moseby]] appeared on the cover with the caption "Here Comes Toronto". The [[Toronto Blue Jays|Blue Jays]] would lose their last seven games of the season, blowing a 3.5 game lead in the [[American League East]]. Ironically, they were eliminated in the final game of the season October 4, one day before the cover date.  This is also a proof of the disadvantage of print media which has a fixed deadline though the shipment date is sometimes in advance of the cover date.
*June 20, 1988: [[Michael Spinks]] appeared on the cover before his fight with [[Mike Tyson]] with the quote, "Don't count me out". Tyson promptly knocked him out, and into retirement, in just 91 seconds a week later.

He finished the season with a record 59 consecutive scoreless innings pitched, breaking the mark of 58 held by former Dodger Don Drysdale. He was selected to his second All-Star game and was a unanimous selection for the National League Cy Young Award. He also won the Gold Glove Award for the best fielding pitcher in the National League. Hershiser was also the only player to receive the Cy Young Award, the Championship Series MVP Award, and the World Series MVP Award in the same season. In 1990, it was discovered that Hershiser had a torn labrum in the shoulder of his pitching arm. Dr. Frank Jobe performed shoulder reconstruction surgery on Hershiser on April 27, 1990, the first time the procedure had been performed on a major league player. The Dodgers did not reach another World Series until 2017

===1990–2000===

This time, running back [[Ahman Green]] was pictured with the headline: "Red Alert: [[Ahman Green]] and [[1996 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|Nebraska]] Set Their Sights on a Third Straight National Title." The following week, the Huskers were shut out for the first time since 1973, 19–0 by Arizona State. Despite this early loss, the Huskers were still in position to play for the national title late in the season before suffering a humiliating upset in the inaugural [[1996 Big 12 Championship Game|Big XII championship game]] to the 7–4 [[Texas Longhorns football|Texas Longhorns]].

Later in [[2002 Winter Olympics|2002]] she would finish with a bronze medal while fellow American [[Sarah Hughes]] wins Gold.  Finally injuries forced Michelle to retire prior to competing in the [[2006 Winter Olympics]].

*September 11, 2000: Painted in gold, gymnast [[Ivan Ivankov]] was on the cover of the Olympic preview issue with the caption, "The World's Best Gymnast." He won no medals in Sydney, finishing an unlucky fourth in the all-around contest.

The Beavers went on to have a 5–6 record with a less than stellar performance from one-time Heisman candidate Simonton.
*November 18, 2002: Highly touted [[high school football]] quarterback [[Brian Brohm]] appeared on the cover as part of a four-part series on the sport. Brohm had a decent college career but was injured toward the end of his time in college and was a complete bust in the NFL. Brohm has spent his professional football career in second-tier leagues.
*September 15, 2003: [[Buffalo Bills]] defensive tackle [[Sam Adams (football player)|Sam Adams]] was pictured running back a fumble for a touchdown against the [[New England Patriots]].  The Bills did not beat the Patriots again until 2011.

*October 11, 2003: In the midst of each league's respective [[League Championship Series]], both the [[2003 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] and [[2003 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] were featured on dual covers to that week's issue. Both teams would go on to suffer great collapses, as the [[2003 Florida Marlins season|Florida Marlins]] defeated the Cubs (partially thanks to Cubs fan [[Steve Bartman incident|Steve Bartman]]'s interference with a fly ball in the eighth inning of Game 6) and the [[2003 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] beat the Red Sox; allowing both teams to advance to the World Series.  This could also be seen as a continuation of the Cubs' "[[Curse of the Billy Goat]]" and the Red Sox' "[[Curse of the Bambino]]" (however, the Red Sox would break their curse the following season by winning their first World Series title since 1918, and it would be another 13 years before the Cubs broke theirs).
*November 17, 2003: The [[Kansas City Chiefs]] appeared on the cover after starting the season 9–0, but would lose the following game in Cincinnati to the Bengals.

*In December 2007, [[2007 Missouri Tigers football team|Missouri Tigers]] quarterback [[Chase Daniel]] appeared on the cover, which stated "Mizzou, That's Who" after the Tigers defeated the 11–0 [[2007 Kansas Jayhawks football team|Kansas Jayhawks]] and took over the #1 ranking in the polls for the first time since 1960. In the Big 12 Championship game played the following week, they lost to the [[2007 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma Sooners]], 38–17, knocking them out of a chance to play for the BCS National Championship.
*August 25, 2008: [[Michael Phelps]] appeared on the cover following his Olympic triumphs and reappeared in December 8 issue as [[Sportsman of the Year]]. In February 2009, publication of a photograph of Phelps using a [[bong|water pipe]], a device used for smoking tobacco or [[marijuana]], surfaced on a British newspaper resulting in the loss of [[Kellogg Company|Kellogg]] as a sponsor, as well as a three-month suspension imposed by [[USA Swimming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Phelps Disciplined Over Marijuana Pipe Incident|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/06/sports/othersports/06phelps.html?ref=sports|work=The New York Times|author=Juliet Macur|date=February 5, 2009|accessdate=2009-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In January 2010, [[2009–10 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]] point guard [[John Wall (basketball)|John Wall]] appeared on the cover under the headline "The Great Wall."

*In February 2010, American alpine skier and Olympic gold medal hopeful [[Lindsey Vonn]] injured her leg the same week as she appeared on the cover. Vonn suffered a severe bruise on her right shin following a crash during training February 2. She caught a break when poor weather caused the alpine events at the [[2010 Winter Olympics|Olympics]] to be delayed, enabling her to recover enough to win gold in her first event, the downhill. However, the "jinx" would apparently catch up with her in her other four events. First, she crashed out in the slalom portion of the super-combined after finishing first in the downhill portion. In the super-G, she admittedly skied the last part of the course too conservatively, ending up with a bronze medal. Vonn then crashed out of the giant slalom, and was disqualified for straddling a gate in the slalom.
*Also in February 2010, [[Serbia]]n tennis player [[Ana Ivanovic]] posed for the magazine, in the middle of a period in which she won just twelve professional matches between January and July 2010. Shortly after her appearance in the magazine, the Serb dropped out of the [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]]'s Top 50 as her on-court form and confidence got worse.

The next week, [[Ali Farokhmanesh]], whose three-pointer in the last minute clinched [[2009–10 Northern Iowa Panthers men's basketball team|Northern Iowa's]] epic upset of #1 [[2009–10 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]] and placed him on the cover, had a poor performance of his own after being featured. He went 2–9 and missed 3 free throws as the Panthers fell 59–52 to [[2009–10 Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team|Michigan State]].
*In April 2010, the "[[Core Four]]" of the [[New York Yankees]] ([[Derek Jeter]], [[Mariano Rivera]], [[Andy Pettitte]] and [[Jorge Posada]]) appeared on the cover, and within one week, all but Jeter suffered injuries. However, Jeter went on to have the worst offensive season of his career.
*In June 2010, [[Stephen Strasburg]] was featured and later that week earned his first MLB loss, and then was injured and was put on the disabled list. On August 28, 2010 it was confirmed that Strasburg would need [[Tommy John surgery]].
*On July 19, 2010, [[LeBron James]], [[Dwyane Wade]], and [[Chris Bosh]] all appeared on the cover introduced as the [[Miami Heat]]'s Big Three. At the time Bosh and James signed with the Heat during free agency, and the team was heavily favored as a championship contender. The Heat would represent the Eastern Conference in the [[2011 NBA Finals]], but ultimately lost to the [[2010–11 Dallas Mavericks season|Dallas Mavericks]]. James also saw a significant drop in stats during the six games in the Finals, and was heavily criticized and questioned for his performance in late-season and clutch situations.
*In August 2010, three University of Texas football players were featured on a regional cover of ''SI'' noting a defense worthy of "winning it all."

Five of those losses came at [[Darrell K Royal–Texas Memorial Stadium]], their home field.
*October 11, 2010: [[David Price (baseball)|David Price]] was shown blowing a bubble on the cover of the magazine's Major League Baseball playoff issue, the [[Tampa Bay Rays]] pitcher had a poor outing in the first game of the [[2010 American League Division Series]], allowing 4 earned runs on nine hits, including two home runs, in a 5–1 loss to the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. Price would go on to pitch in Game 5 of the series and lose by the same score of 5–1 to end the Rays' playoff run and season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/boxscore.jsp?gid=2010_10_06_texmlb_tbamlb_1|title=Box Score: Texas vs. Tampa Bay – October 6, 2010|publisher=MLB.com|date=2010-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*On April 19, 2011, [[Derrick Rose]] of the [[Chicago Bulls]] appears on the cover prior to the NBA Playoffs. The Bulls had a good stretch in the postseason, but eventually lost in the Conference Finals to the Miami Heat. The Heat would go on to the Finals but then lose to the Mavericks.

*October 15, 2011 – [[Jimmie Johnson]] had an accident at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] in the [[Bank of America 500]], jeopardizing his chance of a sixth consecutive [[NASCAR]] [[Sprint Cup Series]] championship. Johnson would finish 6th in the points, his worst finish at the time since joining the Sprint Cup series full-time.
*October 24, 2011 –  Outfielder [[Nelson Cruz]] of the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] appeared on the cover of ''Sports Illustrated'' as the [[2011 World Series]] began.  The Rangers would go on to lose the World Series to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in 7 games despite being one strike away from winning the Series twice during Game 6. During Game 6, Cruz had the opportunity to catch a [[David Freese]] fly ball that would have won the Rangers the championship, but missed it, allowing the Cardinals to stay in the game.  Since then the Rangers have never won a post-season series and remain the oldest MLB franchise not to win a World Series.
*December 14, 2011: The [[Denver Broncos]] (specifically [[Tim Tebow]]) appeared on the cover after a six-game win streak. They would go on to lose the next three games of the regular season, one of those games being against a team (the [[Buffalo Bills]]) that was in the midst of a 1–8 stretch; however, the Broncos had still accrued enough wins to make the playoffs and won its wild card game in the [[3:16 Game]].

===2012===
*January 8, 2012: [[Green Bay Packers]] quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]] appeared on the ''Sports Illustrated'' cover as the [[2011–2012 NFL playoffs]] began.

The Giants became the first team with a 9–7 regular season record to win the Super Bowl.  The Patriots, who had an AFC-best 13–3 regular season record, had already lost to the Giants in week 9 of the regular season and in week 4 of the preseason.  The Patriots had also lost to the Giants in their one previous Super Bowl match-up in [[Super Bowl XLII]].
*On February 17, 2012, with point guard [[Jeremy Lin]] featured on the ''Sports Illustrated'' cover, the [[New York Knicks]] snapped a seven-game winning streak by losing at home 89–85 to the [[New Orleans Hornets]], the team with the second-worst record in the NBA.
*On February 23, 2012, when featured on a second consecutive ''Sports Illustrated'' cover, Lin went 1 for 11 as the Knicks lost to the [[Miami Heat]] 102–88.  In March, Lin tore a [[meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]] in his left knee and subsequently underwent season-ending knee surgery.
*March 26, 2012: [[Albert Pujols]] was featured on the ''Sports Illustrated'' baseball preview cover.  Next to the cover photo was the caption, "The game's greatest slugger starts over with the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Angels]]".  Pujols did not hit a home run with the Angels until May 6, 2012, in his 28th game and 111th at-bat of the season.  Dating back to 2011, his regular season homerless streak lasted 33 games and 139 at-bats.&lt;ref&gt;Boren, Cindy.

''The Washington Post''. May 7, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to 2012, Pujols had hit 445 career home runs, 32+ home runs in each of his 11 [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] seasons (including 37 in 2011), and 3 home runs off 3 different [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] pitchers in Game 3 of the [[2011 World Series]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2011_10_22_slnmlb_texmlb_1#gid=2011_10_22_slnmlb_texmlb_1&amp;mode=box/ Box score: St. Louis vs. Texas, October 22, 2011].

They went on to lose to the Diamondbacks the same night in an 11–4 blowout. [[Ted Lilly]] received his first loss of the season. [[Clayton Kershaw]] lost to the [[Astros]] the following night. The Dodgers were then swept by the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] and then lost a series with the [[Colorado Rockies|Rockies]]. They lost 8 of the next 11 games. Matt Kemp's seemingly minor injury became much more serious hamstring injury and the team was without his services for over two months.  Furthermore, this was a start of an injury plagued portion of Kemp's career as he finished 2012 by playing through a shoulder injury.  In 2013, Kemp got his 1,000th hit, but he also appeared in only 73 games as he battled ankle and hamstring injuries.  Finally, Kemp struggled through the 2014 season to the point that he got switched to left field and was traded to [[San Diego Padres|San Diego]] in the offseason.

*November 13, 2012: [[2012 Kansas State Wildcats football team|Kansas State Wildcats]] quarterback [[Collin Klein]] was featured on the cover, the week after Kansas State reached #1 in the [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]] standings for the first time in school history. At the time, the team was a serious contender to play in the [[2013 BCS National Championship Game|national title game]], and Klein himself was a front-runner for the [[Heisman Trophy]].

*December 2012: [[Deron Williams]] of the [[Brooklyn Nets]] struggles and gets injured soon after being on the cover of ''Sports Illustrated'' in the off season. This was one of the worst streaks of his NBA career.

*April 29, 2013: [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] forward [[Kevin Durant]] was featured on the cover. In their next game, Durant's star teammate [[Russell Westbrook]] tore his lateral meniscus against the Rockets, and the Thunder went on to lose their series with Memphis.
*May 15, 2013: [[Memphis Grizzlies]] point guard [[Mike Conley, Jr.]] was featured on the cover. After winning their first two playoff series against the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] in the first round and the Oklahoma City Thunder in the conference semifinals, the Grizzlies lost to the [[San Antonio Spurs]] in a 4–0 sweep of the Western Conference Finals.

*November 4, 2013: [[2013 Oregon Ducks football team|Oregon Ducks]] QB [[Marcus Mariota]] was featured on the cover for his undefeated run with the Ducks. Three days later, Oregon lost to [[2013 Stanford Cardinal football team|Stanford]] in a gut-wrenching loss to stop their undefeated record.

*December 2, 2013: Cowboys Quarterback [[Tony Romo]] was on the cover the week after he beat the Raiders on Thanksgiving, and were 7–5 leading the NFC East.  The story was about how America shouldn't blame him for all of the Cowboys recent collapses. The next week, the Cowboys were destroyed by the [[Chicago Bears]] 45–28, although most of the blame for the loss went to the defense.  However, the week after was a matchup with the [[Green Bay Packers]], who had to use backup quarterback [[Matt Flynn]] with the usual starter [[Aaron Rodgers]] out with a broken collarbone.  Dallas went up 26–3, and ultimately ended up losing 37–36, with much of the blame going to Romo for his two late interceptions, one of which resulted in the winning score and the other being the game-sealer.  After a win in [[Washington Redskins|Washington]] the next week, Romo was ruled out for the final game after a back injury, required surgery. This game against the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] would ultimately decide the NFC East. [[Kyle Orton]] started, but the Cowboys lost a close one 24–22, ending their season at 8–8 for the 3rd straight year. The saga doesn't end there as Tony Romo would go winless in his next two Thanksgiving games while injuries would hamper the rest of his career.  This includes a loss to Philadelphia in the 2014 Thanksgiving game.  Then in 2015 Romo gets his collarbone injured twice and both times in the third quarter.  First it was a sack by [[Jordan Hicks]] of the Eagles in a Week 2 win while the second came during a Thanksgiving loss to the [[Carolina Panthers]], which would ultimately finish the regular season 15-1.  In the 2016 preseason, Romo injured his back on the third play of the contest at Seattle and watched as Rookie [[Dak Prescott]] led the Cowboys to a 13-3 season which included a Thanksgiving win over [[Washington Redskins|Washington]].
*December 9, 2013: Ohio State QB, [[Braxton Miller]] was featured on the cover after the Buckeyes win their 24th straight game. A week later Ohio State lost the [[Big Ten]] championship game to Michigan State, 34–24.

*December 30, 2013: The players who had scored game-winning touchdowns in Auburn's last two regular-season games—Ricardo Louis [[Prayer at Jordan–Hare|against Georgia]] and [[Chris Davis (cornerback)|Chris Davis]] against Alabama—were featured on the cover. Two weeks later, they lost to [[2013 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State]] in the [[2014 BCS National Championship Game|BCS National Championship Game]]. The Tide would go on to lose 45-31 to the [[2013 Oklahoma Sooners football team| Oklahoma Sooners]] in the [[2014 Sugar Bowl| Allstate Sugar Bowl]].

A '''stutter step''' is a footwork technique in [[tennis]] and other sports.

The term has fallen out of usage in the modern game, but the technique is still used. The stutter step is basically running forward with small steps while [[Squatting position|squatting]], having the back perpendicular to the ground, and having the [[racquet]] up in front. It is a technique used to approach the net after a strong approach shot in preparation for a [[volley (tennis)|volley]]. It allows the player to be in a stable ready position while moving forward and creating a higher percentage volley.

== Common meaning in modern usage ==
Although the term is mainly used in tennis, it has also become a modern term that is used commonly meaning to "unsurely make a decision or perform a job or activity". For example, you could 'stutter step" in a decision, or take slow, unsure steps and be cautious towards it instead of to just make up your mind and go for it.

== In basketball ==
In basketball, the stutter step is a common warm-up drill where you shuffle and scuff your feet in a quick moving motion across a length of flooring. This warm-up is supposed to keep the players alert and help them prepare to defend players in a real game, since the stutter step is a littler version of shuffling.

== In track and field ==
In [[track and field]], a stutter step is usually related to an event where foot placement needs to be precise:  shortened adjustment steps leading up to a hurdle, or on a runway event where the final step initiates the jump, vault or throw.

== In video games ==
[[Real-time strategy|RTS]] games have players issuing orders to units on a game field. Some units are unable to attack while moving. Stutter stepping is when units are ordered to move the moment their attack animation begins, allowing them to follow or flee from enemy units while attacking.

'''Tent boxing''' is an amusement seen at agricultural shows throughout [[Australia]]. Born in [[England]], now banned in the [[United States]], the outback is today the only place such an attraction can survive.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

== History ==

Starting in the late 19th Century boxing troupes of professional fighters would travel the mining towns and outback of the country, following fairs and carnivals, putting up big top tents and taking on all-comers for cash in the ring.

Among the more famous of tent boxing troupes, are the ones created by Roy Bell and Jimmy Sharman.

Fred Brophy, who owns the Cracow Hotel in [[Cracow, Queensland]], is believed to be one of the world's last boxing tent showmen.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Julia; Lyons, Leonie [http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2007/08/10/2001684.htm?site=westqld Fred Brophy: An Aussie boxing tent legend], [[ABC Western Queensland]], 29 July 2008. Retrieved 8 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.outbackqueensland.com.au/news/fred-keeps-outback-fight-club-alive Fred keeps 'Outback Fight Club' alive], ''Outback Queensland'', 28 October 2015. Retrieved 8 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brophy continues to travel with his troupe across Queensland each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/pauline-hanson-takes-a-turn-as-ringcard-girl-in-fred-brophy-boxing-tent-at-birdsville/news-story/0c59056d4b3cf6319830819cb64e8f2e Pauline Hanson takes a turn as ring-card girl in Fred Brophy boxing tent at Birdsville], ''[[The Courier-Mail]]'', 31 August 2017. Retrieved 8 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.news-mail.com.au/news/brophy-to-find-bundy-boxing-champ/3231568 Brophy to find Bundy boxing champ], ''[[NewsMail]]'', 6 October 2017. Retrieved 8 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;North, Melissa [http://www.northweststar.com.au/story/5213562/fred-brophy-confirms-he-will-return-for-the-isa-rodeo Fred Brophy confirms he will return for the Isa Rodeo], ''North West Star'', 7 February 2018. Retrieved 8 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

For his years of touring with his tent boxing show, Brophy was awarded the [[Medal of the Order of Australia]] in 2011 for his role in raising money for charity and for services to the entertainment industry.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Karyn; Harris, Julia [http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2011/01/28/3124523.htm Fred Brophy, boxing tent legend, awarded OAM], [[ABC Western Queensland]], 28 January 2011. Retrieved 8 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== A dangerous sport ==

Largely unreported on, little is known about early tent boxers and events due to participants and spectators being largely illiterate. In more modern times, very few photographs exist of the movement as organisers disapprove of media involvement.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Fred Brophy insists he will continue travelling with his tent boxing troupe, until he dies, even though the sport was banned in [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[West Australia]] and [[South Australia]] in 1971 by the government, due to health concerns.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

'''The Field House''' is a former athletic facility on the campus of the [[University of Toledo]] in [[Toledo, Ohio]], United States, that was closed in 1976 and remodeled in 2008.

==Construction==
Made from Wisconsin Lannon stone,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://utmemorialfieldhouse.wordpress.com/architecture/|title=Architecture|date=11 October 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; construction of the building took place between March, 1930 and January, 1931 on land owned by the university. The cost of construction was approximately $470,000. The Field House was the second building constructed on the present UT campus. The facility covered more than an acre of ground, utilized a dirt floor and seated only 2,000 spectators around an elevated wooden basketball court. The building also contained two gymnasiums devoted to men's and women's physical education classes.

==Usage==
The primary use for the gymnasium was a location that could be utilized for men's and women's physical education courses as well as being the facility for the [[Toledo Rockets men's basketball]] team to compete. Additionally, the venue was utilized for social and academic functions including commencement ceremonies.  The Field House provided a great venue and gathering place for all to come and enjoy the speeches or performances being held. Although its main use was a gymnasium for basketball it held some very iconic speakers and bands.  Some famous people that spoke in the Field House included politicians [[Barry M. Goldwater]] as well as President [[Richard Nixon]]. Additionally, some famous bands and singers performed in the Field House including [[Pink Floyd]], [[Jimmy Hendrix]], [[Kenny Rogers]], [[The J. Geils Band]], [[The Kingston Trio]], [[Hall and Oates]], [[The Beach Boys]], [[Simon and Garfunkel]] and also [[The Byrds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/venue/university-of-toledo-field-house-toledo-oh-usa-3d429f7.html|title=University of Toledo Field House, Toledo, OH, USA Concert Setlists - setlist.fm|website=www.setlist.fm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remodel==
Upon completion of [[Savage Arena|Centennial Hall]] in 1976, The Field House became obsolete and became underutilized becoming a storage facility for the campus for nearly 20 years. In 2006, however, facing a burst in student enrollment, an expansion of program offerings, and concern about future space needs, the university commissioned a major overhaul that, three years later, recast the 134,200 square foot gymnasium into a learning environment housing classrooms, teaching labs, faculty offices, and space for future growth. Construction began in July, 2007, with the demolition of the old interior and extensive cleanup effort on the exterior brickwork commencing in December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azshmina.com/project/memorial-field-house-2/|title=» Memorial Field House|website=azshmina.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a span of only 10 months, and the addition of a second and third floor, the result was a $27 million renovation, with 54 classrooms, 70 offices, and a 250-seat auditorium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toledoblade.com/Education/2008/09/18/Revitalized-Field-House-gains-new-life-former-arena-holds-state-of-the-art-classrooms.html|title=Revitalized Field House gains new life; former arena holds state-of-the-art classrooms|date=18 September 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; usable interior

The '''triangle offense''' is an offensive strategy used in [[basketball]]. Its basic ideas were initially established by [[Basketball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] coach [[Sam Barry]] at the [[University of Southern California]].&lt;ref&gt;Barry, Dan (June 28, 2017) [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/28/sports/basketball/triangle-offense-new-york-knicks.html "The Triangle Offense, a Simple Yet Perplexing System, Dies."] New York Times. (Retrieved October 11, 2018.)&lt;/ref&gt; His system was further developed by former [[Houston Rockets]] and [[Kansas State University]] basketball head coach [[Tex Winter]], who played for Barry in the late 1940s. Winter later served as assistant coach for the [[Chicago Bulls]] in the 1980s and 1990s and for the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in the 2000s, mostly under head coach [[Phil Jackson]].

The system's most important feature is the sideline triangle created by the [[center (basketball)|center]], who stands at the [[low post]], the [[forward (basketball)|forward]] at the wing, and the [[guard (basketball)|guard]] at the [[basketball court|corner]]. The team's other guard stands at the top of the [[key (basketball)|key]] and the weak-side forward is on the weak-side [[low post|high post]]—together forming the "two-man game". The goal of the offense is to fill those five spots, which creates good spacing between players and allows each one to pass to four teammates. Every pass and cut has a purpose and everything is dictated by the defense. 

It has been shown that the triangle offense is the most optimal way for five players to space the floor on the basketball court. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://relativitydigest.com/2016/11/12/basketball-a-game-of-geometry/|title=Basketball – A Game of Geometry|date=2016-11-12|work=Relativity Digest|access-date=2018-02-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategy==
[[File:Triangle_offense.svg|thumb|right|The initial setup of the triangle offense, with a sideline triangle to the right of the free throw lane. The point guard (circled "1") has brought the ball up the floor, passed to the shooting guard (circled "2"), and cut to the strong-side corner]]

The offense starts when a guard passes to the wing and cuts to the strong-side corner. The triangle is created from a post player on the strong-side block, the strong-side corner, and the extended strong-side wing, who gains possession on the first pass. The desired initial option in the offense is to pass to the strong-side post player on the block who is in good scoring position. From there the player has the options of looking to score or pass to one of the perimeter players who are exchanging from strong-side corner and wing, a dive cut down the lane, or the opposite wing flashing to the top of the key which initiates another common option known as the "pinch post".

If a pass to the block is not possible, the second option is either to pass to the weak-side guard who flashes top of the key from the weak-side wing position or passing to the strong-side corner. If the ball is passed to the corner the options are either shoot, pass to the strong-side block, or pick and pop with the wing. If it is passed to the weak-side guard it initiates the "pinch post" option. There are two options. The first and most common is to pass to the weak-side forward who flashes to the elbow (corner of the key at the free throw line) to receive the pass. When he does the options are a rub handoff, back door cut by guard without the ball, post up of the guard on a smaller player, or face up and attack. The second option is a pick and roll with the forward. The advantage to the first option is there are so many weapons to attack the defense it opens up a lot of freedom and ability to score effectively. The advantage on the second option is that the player who has the ball and uses the screen now has the entire side of the floor to work with to go one on one. Meanwhile, on the other side, the wing sets a screen for the corner guard on the triangle split. If the hand-off is not available, the forward or the guard can pass to the corner guard coming off the screen. If the defense overplays or expects the split, both the wing and the corner guard can back cut to the basket. During all of this time the original strong-side block player is able to establish position for an easy shot while the defender is lured by all of the movement and cutting by the other players.

If the strong-side wing-to-guard pass is not possible, the third option is for the weak-side forward to flash to the strong-side elbow, take the pass, and cut to the basket on the trademark backdoor play of the offense. Meanwhile, the wing and corner guard exchange on a down screen. The forward with the ball can pass to the cutting guard or to the corner guard coming off the wing's screen. If nothing's available, he can shoot the basketball himself.

The offense also has a variety of options if there's heavy pressure from the defense. If the initial wing-pass by the guard isn't available, the triangle can be created on the other side by passing to the other guard, who then passes to the weak-side forward (who then becomes the strong-side wing). The guard, who initially had the ball, then cuts to the other corner. The center or the pressured wing can flash to the opposite post. If the guard-to-guard pass is not available, the weak-side forward can make a similar flash cut that was mentioned earlier. That also creates many cutting opportunities. If there is heavy pressure on everybody, the center can release the pressure by cutting to the high post for a pass by the ball-handling guard. That would also create space for possible cuts.

Head coach [[Phil Jackson]], with help from assistant coach [[Tex Winter]], won 11 [[NBA Finals]] with the triangle offense. Jackson coached the Bulls from 1989–1998. He next served as the head coach of the Lakers twice, first from 1999–2004, and then from 2005–2011. The [[Chicago Bulls]] under Jackson won six championships in the 1990s playing in the triangle. His first three title-winning teams in Chicago featured superstars [[Michael Jordan]] and [[Scottie Pippen]]. Jackson's later three titles with the Bulls came with Jordan, Pippen, and fellow superstar [[Dennis Rodman]]. Jackson's [[Los Angeles Lakers]] won five championships employing the triangle. His first three Lakers championship squads fielded superstars [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Kobe Bryant]], while his last two title teams saw him pair Bryant with fellow All-Star [[Pau Gasol]].

When Jackson became the head coach of the Chicago Bulls before the start of the 1989–1990 NBA season, he and Winter originally installed the triangle offense in an attempt to subvert the [[Jordan Rules]] strategy employed by their Eastern Conference rivals, the [[Detroit Pistons]].&lt;ref name="rules"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/jordan-rules|title=The Jordan Rules|publisher=answers.com|accessdate=2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Jordan Rules" was a defensive strategy which consisted of solely targeting Michael Jordan. Jordan had already established himself as an elite NBA superstar by single-handedly turning Chicago into a playoff contender. However, by sharing responsibility rather than shouldering it, he continued to blossom as a great all-around basketball player. More importantly, the Bulls also improved notably as a team, finishing with a 55–27 record.&lt;ref name="triangle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/1989-90-chicago-bulls-season |title=1989-90 Chicago Bulls season|publisher=answers.com|accessdate=2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bulls fell to the Pistons in 7 games in the 1990 Eastern Conference Finals. The following year, however, Chicago finished the 1990–1991 NBA season with a then-franchise best 61–21 record, good for first place in the East, then swept the archrival Pistons 4–0 in the 1991 Eastern Conference Finals. The Bulls then defeated the Los Angeles Lakers in the [[NBA Finals]], four games to one. Michael Jordan won his second [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award]] that season and won his first championship.

The triangle offense was used very effectively by the Bulls during the 1995–96 season. Jordan, back at the helm for the team in his first full season since coming out of retirement, won his fourth NBA MVP award. He also finished the season as the league's leading scorer for the 8th time. The Bulls recorded a then NBA-record 72–10 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/warriors/gameday/20160413/recap|title=Warriors End Regular Season in Record-Breaking Fashion - Golden State Warriors|author=|date=|website=nba.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; season en route to what was then their fourth NBA championship. Jackson won his first (and only) [[NBA Coach of the Year Award]] for his efforts during his team's record-breaking season. Overall, the Bulls won six NBA titles during the 1990s, and the team is considered to be the NBA's greatest dynasties.

Jackson installed the triangle offense again when he started coaching the Lakers in the 1999–2000 season, with Winter once again serving as an assistant on his staff. This time, Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant served as the focal points of the team's offense. O'Neal won the NBA MVP Award in 2000, and Bryant rose to prominence as one of the NBA's newest stars. The Lakers became an elite NBA team during Jackson's first term as their coach, making four NBA Finals appearances in five years and winning three straight championships from 2000–2002. At the end of the 2004 Finals, which resulted in losing to the Detroit Pistons, his contract was not renewed. Jackson returned to the Lakers as head coach starting in the 2005–2006 season. Despite the presence of Bryant as the centerpiece of the team, the Lakers could not get past the first round of the playoffs in 2006 or 2007. However, the team acquired versatile forward Pau Gasol from the [[Memphis Grizzlies]] during the 2008 season. With Bryant and Gasol running the triangle offense, the Lakers made the NBA Finals three straight times and won in 2009 and 2010. In the process, Jackson surpassed [[Red Auerbach]]'s record of most titles won by an NBA coach.

When Phil Jackson retired as a head coach at the end of the 2010–2011 season, he finished his career with over 1000 victories over the course of his coaching career, regular season and playoff games combined. Jackson, Jordan, Pippen, Rodman, and O'Neal are all [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]]. Tex Winter earned induction into the Hall of Fame in 2011 for his contributions to basketball involving the triangle offense. He was an assistant for both the Bulls and Lakers on the first nine of Jackson's 11 championship teams, and served as a consultant to the Lakers on the final two.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2586">The '''Western Australian Institute of Sport''' ('''WAIS''') is an elite sports institute set up in 1983 by the [[Government of Western Australia]] to support athletes in [[Western Australia]]. Previously, if elite athletes from Western Australian needed to train or receive coaching at an international level they had to move to one of the [[Australian Institute of Sport]] (AIS) campuses which were generally based in the eastern states. The founding director was [[Wally Foreman]] who held the position for 17 years until 2001.

The institute is based at the WAIS High Performance Service Centre (next door to [[HBF Stadium]]) and has sport programs including [[Athletics (track and field)|athletics]], [[baseball]], [[canoeing]], [[cycling]], [[gymnastics]], [[Field hockey|men and women's hockey]], [[netball]], [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[sailing]], [[softball]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] and [[water polo|men and women's water polo]].
