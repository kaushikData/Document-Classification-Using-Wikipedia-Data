[[File:AGroupOfNobleDames.jpg|thumb|First US edition&lt;br&gt;(publ. [[Harper and Brothers]])]]
'''''A Group of Noble Dames''''' is an 1891 collection of short stories written by [[Thomas Hardy]]. The stories are contained by a [[frame story|frame narrative]] in which ten members of a club each tell one story about a noble dame in the 17th or 18th century.

==Contents==
'''Part I—Before Dinner'''
*''The First Countess of Wessex'' by the local historian
*''[[Barbara of the House of Grebe]]'' by the old surgeon
*''The Marchioness of Stonehenge'' by the rural dean
*''Lady Mottisfont'' by the sentimental member
'''Part II—After Dinner'''
*''The Lady Icenway'' by the churchwarden
*''Squire Petrick’s Lady'' by the crimson maltster
*''Anna, Lady Baxby'' by the colonel
*''The Lady Penelope'' by the man of family
*''The Duchess Of Hamptonshire'' by the quiet gentleman
*''The Honourable Laura'' by the spark

==Publication==
All ten stories were published in serial magazines before Hardy collected them into book form. "The Duchess of Hamptonshire" and "The Honourable Laura" were written relatively early in Hardy's career, in 1878 and 1881 respectively. "The First Countess of Wessex" and "The Lady Penelope" were written in 1888-89. Hardy revised all four of these stories significantly before adding them to the collection in 1891. The remaining six stories were written in early 1890 and published in [[bowdlerised]] form in a special Christmas number of ''[[The Graphic]]'' in December 1890.

Hardy collected all ten stories together for the first time in ''A Group of Noble Dames'', which was published in England by Osgood, McIlvaine, &amp; Co. and in America by [[Harper &amp; Brothers]] in 1891. The critical reception of the book was mixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wallace, William|title=Brief review: ''A Group of Noble Dames''|journal=[[The Academy (periodical)|The Academy]]|date=22 Aug 1891|volume=40|issue=1007|page=153|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GzcZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Brief review: ''A Group of Noble Dames''|journal=[[National Review (London)|The National Review]]|date=March–August 1891|volume=17|page=845|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ayktAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA845}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==TV and Film Adaptations==
"[[Barbara of the House of Grebe]]" was adapted as a television drama by the BBC as part of an anthology series called ''Wessex Tales''. Broadcast 12 December 1973 on [[BBC2]].

'''''Alcibiades the Schoolboy''''' (''L'Alcibiade, fanciullo a scola''), an Italian [[dialogue]] published anonymously in 1652, is a defense of homosexual [[sodomy]] ([[anal sex]]) loosely styled after [[Plato]]nic [[dialogue]]. Set in ancient [[Athens]], the teacher is modelled on [[Socrates]], who so desperately wants to consummate the relationship he has with [[Alcibiades]], one of his students, that he uses all tactics of [[rhetoric]] and [[sophistry]] at his disposal. He argues that [[Nature]] gave us [[sexual organs]] for our own pleasure, and that it would insult her to use them otherwise, citing examples from [[Greek mythology]] and culture, as well as refuting counterarguments based on the [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] story. It is "a tour de force of pederastic fantasy and one of the frankest and most explicit texts on the subject to have been written before the twentieth century."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abebooks.com/Alcibiades-Schoolboy-ROOCO-Antonio-Entimos-Press/9994036425/bd&lt;/ref&gt; It has been called "the first homosexual novel".&lt;ref&gt;William A. Percy, "Alcibiades the Schoolboy. Afterword", http://www.williamapercy.com/wiki/index.php?title=Alcibiades_the_Schoolboy, retrieved 2014-09-02&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years the identity of the author was a mystery. The work was first attributed to [[Pietro Aretino]], but an article in 1888 by Achille Neri identified the author as [[Antonio Rocco]], a [[libertine]] priest and philosopher and member of the [[Accademia degli Incogniti]] founded by [[Giovan Battista Loredan]].

The text is unashamedly explicit, and it has been argued that "it must be understood in the context of similar texts of the trend of [[libertinism]], using the term in its original sense of a sceptical philosophical tendency."

'''Amarna letter EA 34''', titled: ''"The Pharaoh's Reproach Answered"''&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Moran|Moran, William L.]] 1987, 1992. ''The Amarna Letters.'' EA 34, ''"The Pharaoh's Reproach Answered"'', pp. 105-107.&lt;/ref&gt; is a moderately tall [[clay tablet]] [[Amarna letter]] from the King of [[Alashiya]]. (See here: [http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?partid=1&amp;assetid=309802001&amp;objectid=274290])

Besides a complicated story line to EA 34, the letter is shown to be in ''Very Good'' condition. It is a bright color, and the [[cuneiform]] is finely inscribed. The [[scribe]] has some distinct techniques: clarity of the cuneiform; because of a listing, use of non-common cuneiform; a technique with "7 and 7 times" that is non-standard; and some specific signs that are also artful (i.e. the simple multiple use of "tug2" ([[túg (cuneiform)|túg]])), which is used for types of clothing.

Besides the interesting use of two verticals for [[ka4 (cuneiform)|ka4]] ([[Image:B099ellst.png|100x24px]]), see as: ( [[Image:C+B-Persia-Cuneiform1.PNG|100x24px]][[Image:C+B-Persia-Cuneiform1.PNG|100x24px]] ), "tug2" (túg)) is distinctive, in the ''Gift Listing'', because in a grouping of more uncommon-use cuneiform, "tug2" is dramaltically simple. It is similar to this ([[Image:Assyrian cuneiform U1245F MesZL 869.svg|100x24px]]), when the added second horizontal up-stroke is added (like an open "pair of scissors"). "Tug2" (túg) is found on the ''Obverse'', lines: 22, 23, and 25; six times. It is found once on the tablet ''Reverse'', line 47.

EA 34 is numbered 29789 in the [[British Museum]].

The [[Amarna letters]], about 300, numbered up to EA 382, are a mid 14th century BC, about [[1360 BC]] and 20–30 years later, [[Text corpus|correspondence]]. The initial [[corpus linguistics|corpus]] of letters were found at [[Akhenaten]]'s city [[Akhetaten]], in the floor of the [[Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh]]; others were later found, adding to the body of letters.

'''American literature''' is [[literature]] written or produced in the [[United States]] and its [[Colonial history of the United States|preceding colonies]] (for specific discussions of poetry and theater, see [[Poetry of the United States]] and [[Theater in the United States]]). Before the [[American Revolutionary War|founding of the United States]], the British colonies on the eastern coast of the present-day United States were heavily influenced by English literature. The American literary tradition thus began as part of the broader tradition of [[English literature]]. 

The revolutionary period is notable for the political writings of [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], and [[Thomas Paine]]. [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s [[United States Declaration of Independence]] solidified his status as a key American writer. It was in the late 18th and early 19th centuries that the nation's first novels were published. An early example is [[William Hill Brown]]'s ''[[The Power of Sympathy]]'' published in 1791. Brown's novel depicts a tragic love story between siblings who fall in love without knowing they are related. 

With an increasing desire to produce uniquely American literature and culture, a number of key new literary figures emerged, perhaps most prominently [[Washington Irving]] and [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. In 1836, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] started an influential movement known as [[Transcendentalism]]. Inspired by that movement, [[Henry David Thoreau]] wrote ''[[Walden]]'', which celebrates individualism and nature and urges resistance to the dictates of organized society. The political conflict surrounding [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]] inspired the writings of [[William Lloyd Garrison]] and [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] in her famous novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''. These efforts were supported by the continuation of the slave narratives such as [[Frederick Douglass]]'s ''[[Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave]].

In the mid-nineteenth century, [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] published his magnum opus ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'', a novel about adultery. Hawthorne influenced [[Herman Melville]], who is notable for the books ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' and  ''[[Billy Budd (novel)|Billy Budd]]''. America's greatest poets of the nineteenth century were [[Walt Whitman]] and [[Emily Dickinson]]. Mark Twain (the pen name used by [[Mark Twain|Samuel Langhorne Clemens]]) was the first major American writer to be born away from the East Coast. [[Henry James]] put American literature on the international map with novels like ''[[The Portrait of a Lady]]''. At the turn of the twentieth century a strong naturalist movement emerged that comprised writers such as [[Edith Wharton]], [[Stephen Crane]], [[Theodore Dreiser]], and [[Jack London]].

American writers expressed disillusionment following [[World War I]]. The short stories and novels of [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] captured the mood of the 1920s, and [[John Dos Passos]] wrote too about the war. [[Ernest Hemingway]] became famous with ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]'' and ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]''; in 1954, he won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. [[William Faulkner]] became one of the greatest American writers with novels like ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]''. American poetry reached a peak after World War I with such writers as [[Wallace Stevens]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Robert Frost]], [[Ezra Pound]], and [[E. E. Cummings]].  American drama attained international status at the time with the works of [[Eugene O'Neill]], who won four [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama|Pulitzer Prizes]] and the [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize]]. In the mid-twentieth century, American drama was dominated by the work of playwrights [[Tennessee Williams]] and [[Arthur Miller]], as well as by the maturation of the American [[musical theatre|musical]].

[[Great Depression|Depression]] era writers included [[John Steinbeck]], notable for his novel ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]''. [[Henry Miller]] assumed a distinct place in American Literature in the 1930s when his semi-autobiographical novels were banned from the US. From the end of World War II until the early 1970s many popular works in modern American literature were produced, like [[Harper Lee|Harper Lee's]] ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]''. America's involvement in World War II influenced works such as [[Norman Mailer]]'s ''[[The Naked and the Dead]]'' (1948), [[Joseph Heller]]'s ''[[Catch-22]]'' (1961) and [[Kurt Vonnegut Jr.]]'s ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'' (1969). The main literary movement since the 1970s has been [[postmodernism]], and since the late twentieth century ethnic and minority literature has sharply increased.

==Colonial literature==
Because of the large immigration to [[Boston]] in the 1630s, the articulation of [[Puritan]] ideals, and the early establishment of a college and a printing press in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], the [[New England colonies]] have often been regarded as the center of early American literature.  However, the first European settlements in North America had been founded elsewhere many years earlier. Towns older than Boston include the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish settlements]] at [[Saint Augustine, Florida|Saint Augustine]] and [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], the [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch settlements]] at [[Albany, New York|Albany]] and [[New Amsterdam]], as well as the English colony of [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] in present-day [[Virginia]].  During the colonial period, the printing press was active in many areas, from Cambridge and Boston to [[New York City|New York]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[Annapolis]].

The dominance of the English language was not inevitable.&lt;ref name="Baym, Nina 2007"&gt;Baym, Nina, ed. ''The Norton Anthology of American Literature''. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first item printed in [[Pennsylvania]] was in German and was the largest book printed in any of the colonies before the American Revolution.&lt;ref name="Baym, Nina 2007" /&gt;  Spanish and French had two of the strongest colonial literary traditions in the areas that now comprise the United States, and discussions of early American literature commonly include texts by [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca]] and [[Samuel de Champlain]] alongside English language texts by [[Thomas Harriot]] and [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]].  Moreover, we are now aware of the wealth of [[oral literature|oral literary]] traditions already existing on the continent among the numerous different [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] groups.  Political events, however, would eventually make English the lingua franca for the colonies at large as well as the literary language of choice.  For instance, when the English conquered New Amsterdam in 1664, they renamed it New York and changed the administrative language from Dutch to English.

From 1696 to 1700, only about 250 separate items were issued from the major printing presses in the American colonies. This is a small number compared to the output of the printers in [[London]] at the time. London printers published materials written by New England authors, so the body of American literature was larger than what was published in North America. However, printing was established in the American colonies before it was allowed in most of England. In England, restrictive laws had long confined printing to four locations, where the government could monitor what was published: London, York, Oxford, and Cambridge. Because of this, the colonies ventured into the modern world earlier than their provincial English counterparts.&lt;ref name="Baym, Nina 2007"/&gt;

Back then, some of the American literature were pamphlets and writings extolling the benefits of the colonies to both a European and colonist audience. [[Captain John Smith]] could be considered the first American author with his works: ''A True Relation of Such Occurrences and Accidents of Noate as Hath Happened in Virginia...'' (1608) and ''The Generall Historie of Virginia, New England, and the Summer Isles'' (1624). Other writers of this manner included [[Daniel Denton]], [[Thomas Ash (writer)|Thomas Ash]], [[William Penn]], [[George Percy]], [[William Strachey]], [[Daniel Coxe]], Gabriel Thomas, and [[John Lawson (explorer)|John Lawson]].

===Topics of early writing===

The religious disputes that prompted settlement in America were important topics of early American literature. A journal written by [[John Winthrop]], ''The History of New England'', discussed the religious foundations of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. [[Edward Winslow]] also recorded a diary of the first years after the ''[[Mayflower]]'s'' arrival. "[[A Model of Christian Charity|A modell of Christian Charity]]" by John Winthrop, the first governor of Massachusetts, was a Sermon preached on the ''[[Arbella]]'' (the [[flagship]] of the [[Winthrop Fleet]]) in 1630. This work outlined the ideal society that he and the other Separatists would build in an attempt to realize a "Puritan utopia". Other religious writers included [[Increase Mather]] and [[William Bradford (1590-1657)|William Bradford]], author of the journal published as a ''[[Of Plymouth Plantation|History of Plymouth Plantation, 1620–47]]''. Others like [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] and [[Nathaniel Ward]] more fiercely argued state and church separation. And still others, like [[Thomas Morton (colonist)|Thomas Morton]], cared little for the church; Morton's ''The New English Canaan'' mocked the religious settlers and declared that the Native Americans were actually better people than the British.&lt;ref name=Skipp&gt;Skipp, Francis E. ''American Literature'', Barron's Educational, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Puritan poetry was highly religious, and one of the earliest books of poetry published was the ''[[Bay Psalm Book]]'', a set of translations of the biblical [[Psalms]]; however, the translators' intention was not to create literature, but to create hymns that could be used in worship.&lt;ref name=Skipp/&gt; Among lyric poets, the most important figures are [[Anne Bradstreet]], who wrote personal poems about her family and homelife; pastor [[Edward Taylor]], whose best poems, the ''Preparatory Meditations'', were written to help him prepare for leading worship; and [[Michael Wigglesworth]], whose best-selling poem, ''[[The Day of Doom]]'' (1660), describes the time of judgment. It was published in the same year that anti-Puritan Charles II was restored to the British throne. He followed it two years later with ''God's Controversy With New England''. [[Nicholas Noyes]] was also known for his [[doggerel]] verse.

Other late writings described conflicts and interaction with the Indians, as seen in writings by [[Daniel Gookin]], [[Alexander Whitaker]], [[John Mason (c.1600-1672)|John Mason]], [[Benjamin Church (ranger)|Benjamin Church]], and [[Mary Rowlandson]]. [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]] translated the [[Bible]] into the [[Algonquin language]].

Of the second generation of New England settlers, [[Cotton Mather]] stands out as a theologian and historian, who wrote the history of the colonies with a view to God's activity in their midst and to connecting the Puritan leaders with the great heroes of the Christian faith. His best-known works include the ''[[Magnalia Christi Americana]]'', the ''[[Wonders of the Invisible World]]'' and ''The Biblia Americana''.

[[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] and [[George Whitefield]] represented the [[First Great Awakening|Great Awakening]], a religious revival in the early 18th century that emphasized [[Calvinism]]. Other Puritan and religious writers include [[Thomas Hooker]], [[Thomas Shepard (minister)|Thomas Shepard]], [[John Wise (clergyman)|John Wise]], and [[Samuel Willard]]. Less strict and serious writers included [[Samuel Sewall]] (who wrote a diary revealing the daily life of the late 17th century),&lt;ref name=Skipp/&gt; and [[Sarah Kemble Knight]].

New England was not the only area in the colonies with a literature: southern literature was also growing at this time. The diary of [[William Byrd II|William Byrd]] and ''[[The History of the Dividing Line]]'' described the expedition to survey the swamp between Virginia and North Carolina but also comments on the differences between [[American Indians (U.S.)|American Indians]] and the white settlers in the area.&lt;ref name=Skipp/&gt; In a similar book, ''Travels through North and South Carolina, Georgia, East and West'', [[William Bartram]] described the Southern landscape and the Indian tribes he encountered; Bartram's book was popular in Europe, being translated into German, French and Dutch.&lt;ref name=Skipp/&gt;

As the colonies moved toward independence from Britain, an important discussion of American culture and identity came from the French immigrant [[J. Hector St. John de Crèvecœur]], whose ''[[Letters from an American Farmer]]'' addresses the question "What is an American?" by moving between praise for the opportunities and peace offered in the new society and recognition that the solid life of the farmer must rest uneasily between the oppressive aspects of the urban life and the lawless aspects of the frontier, where the lack of social structures leads to the loss of civilized living.&lt;ref name=Skipp/&gt;

This same period saw the beginning of black literature, through the poet [[Phillis Wheatley]] and the [[slave narrative]] of [[Olaudah Equiano]], ''[[The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano]]''. At this time American Indian literature also began to flourish. [[Samson Occom]] published his ''A Sermon Preached at the Execution of Moses Paul'' and a popular hymnbook, ''Collection of Hymns and Spiritual Songs'', "the first Indian best-seller".&lt;ref name=Gray&gt;Gray, Richard. ''A History of American Literature''. Blackwell, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revolutionary period===

The Revolutionary period also contained political writings, including those by colonists [[Samuel Adams]], [[Josiah Quincy II|Josiah Quincy]], [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]], and [[Joseph Galloway]], the last being a loyalist to the crown. Two key figures were [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Thomas Paine]]. Franklin's ''[[Poor Richard's Almanac]]'' and ''[[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin]]'' are esteemed works with their wit and influence toward the formation of a budding American identity. Paine's pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (Book)|Common Sense]]'' and ''[[The American Crisis]]'' writings are seen as playing a key role in influencing the political tone of the time.

During the Revolutionary War, poems and songs such as "[[Yankee Doodle]]" and "[[Nathan Hale]]" were popular. Major satirists included [[John Trumbull (poet)|John Trumbull]] and [[Francis Hopkinson]]. [[Philip Morin Freneau]] also wrote poems about the War.

During the 18th century, writing shifted from the Puritanism of Winthrop and Bradford to Enlightenment ideas of reason. The belief that human and natural occurrences were messages from God no longer fit with the new human-centered world. Many intellectuals believed that the human mind could comprehend the universe through the laws of physics as described by Isaac Newton. One of these was Cotton Mather. The first book published in North America that promoted Newton and natural theology was Mather's ''The Christian Philosopher'' (1721). The enormous scientific, economic, social, and philosophical, changes of the 18th century, called the [[American Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], impacted the authority of clergyman and scripture, making way for democratic principles. The increase in population helped account for the greater diversity of opinion in religious and political life as seen in the literature of this time. In 1670, the population of the colonies numbered approximately 111,000. Thirty years later it was more than 250,000. By 1760, it reached 1,600,000.&lt;ref name="Baym, Nina 2007"/&gt; The growth of communities and therefore social life led people to become more interested in the progress of individuals and their shared experience in the colonies. These new ideas can be seen in the popularity of [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s ''Autobiography''.

Even earlier than Franklin was [[Cadwallader Colden]] (1689 - 1776), whose book ''The History of the Five Indian Nations'', published in 1727 was one of the first texts critical of the treatment of the Iroquois in upstate New York by the English.  Colden also wrote a book on botany, which attracted the attention of Linnaeus, and he maintained a long term correspondence with Benjamin Franklin.

==Post-independence==
In the post-war period, [[Thomas Jefferson]] established his place in American literature through his authorship of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], his influence on the [[United States Constitution]], his autobiography, his [[Notes on the State of Virginia]], and his many letters. [[The Federalist]] essays by [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[James Madison]], and [[John Jay]] presented a significant historical discussion of American government organization and republican values. [[Fisher Ames]], [[James Otis, Jr.|James Otis]], and [[Patrick Henry]] are also valued for their political writings and orations.

Early American literature struggled to find a unique voice in existing literary genre, and this tendency was reflected in novels. European styles were frequently imitated, but critics usually considered the imitations inferior.

=== The First American Novel ===
In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the first American novels were published. These fictions were too lengthy to be printed as manuscript or public reading. Publishers took a chance on these works in hopes they would become steady sellers and need to be reprinted. This scheme was ultimately successful because male and female literacy rates were increasing at the time. Among the first American novels are [[Thomas Attwood Digges]]' "Adventures of Alonso", published in London in 1775 and  [[William Hill Brown]]'s ''[[The Power of Sympathy]]'' published in 1791. Brown's novel depicts a tragic love story between siblings who fell in love without knowing they were related. 

In the next decade important women writers also published novels. [[Susanna Rowson]] is best known for her novel, ''Charlotte: A Tale of Truth'', published in London in 1791.&lt;ref name="Parker, Patricia L. 1976"&gt;Parker, Patricia L. "Charlotte Temple by Susanna Rowson." ''The English Journal.'' 65.1: (1976) 59-60. ''JSTOR.'' Web. 1 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1794 the novel was reissued in Philadelphia under the title, ''[[Charlotte Temple]].'' ''Charlotte Temple'' is a seduction tale, written in the third person, which warns against listening to the voice of love and counsels resistance. She also wrote nine novels, six theatrical works, two collections of poetry, six textbooks, and countless songs.&lt;ref name="Parker, Patricia L. 1976"/&gt; Reaching more than a million and a half readers over a century and a half, ''Charlotte Temple'' was the biggest seller of the 19th century before Stowe's ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]].'' Although Rowson was extremely popular in her time and is often acknowledged in accounts of the development of the early American novel, ''Charlotte Temple'' is often criticized as a sentimental novel of seduction.

[[Hannah Webster Foster]]'s ''The Coquette: Or, the History of Eliza Wharton'' was published in 1797 and was also extremely popular.&lt;ref&gt;Schweitzer, Ivy. "Review." ''Early American Literature.'' 23.2: (1988) 221-225. ''JSTOR.'' Web. 1 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Told from Foster's point of view and based on the real life of Eliza Whitman, the novel is about a woman who is seduced and abandoned. Eliza is a "coquette" who is courted by two very different men: a clergyman who offers her a comfortable domestic life and a noted libertine. Unable to choose between them, she finds herself single when both men get married. She eventually yields to the artful libertine and gives birth to an illegitimate stillborn child at an inn. ''The Coquette'' is praised for its demonstration of the era's contradictory ideas of womanhood. &lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Kristie. "An Assault on the Will: Republican Virtue and the City in Hannah Webster Foster's 'The Coquette'." ''Early American Literature.'' 24.2: (1989) 135-151. ''JSTOR.'' Web. 1 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; even as it has been criticized for delegitimizing protest against women's subordination.&lt;ref&gt;Joudrey, Thomas J.

[[File:Washington Irving and his Literary Friends at Sunnyside.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Washington Irving]] and his friends at [[Sunnyside (Tarrytown, New York)|Sunnyside]]]]
Both ''The Coquette'' and ''Charlotte Temple'' are novels that treat the right of women to live as equals as the new democratic experiment. These novels are of the Sentimental genre, characterized by overindulgence in emotion, an invitation to listen to the voice of reason against misleading passions, as well as an optimistic overemphasis on the essential goodness of humanity. Sentimentalism is often thought to be a reaction against the Calvinistic belief in the depravity of human nature.&lt;ref name="wsu.edu"&gt;Campbell, Donna M. "The Early American Novel: Introductory Notes." ''Literary Movements.'' 14 July 2008. 1 March 2010. http://www.wsu.edu/~campbelld/amlit/earamnov.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
While many of these novels were popular, the economic infrastructure of the time did not allow these writers to make a living through their writing alone.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mildred Lewis Rutherford|Rutherford, Mildred]]. ''American Authors.'' Atlanta: The Franklin Printing and Publishing Co., 1902.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Brockden Brown]] is the earliest American novelist whose works are still commonly read. He published ''[[Wieland (novel)|Wieland]]'' in 1798, and in 1799 published ''Ormond'', ''[[Edgar Huntly]]'', and ''[[Arthur Mervyn]]''. These novels are of the Gothic genre.

The first writer to be able to support himself through the income generated by his publications alone was [[Washington Irving]]. He completed his first major book in 1809 entitled ''A History of New-York from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty.''&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Guy. "The Winning of the West: Washington Irving's 'A Tour on the Prairies'." ''The Yearbook of English Studies.'' 34: (2004) 88-99. ''JSTOR.'' Web. 1 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the picaresque genre, [[Hugh Henry Brackenridge]] published ''Modern Chivalry'' in 1792-1815; [[Tabitha Gilman Tenney]] wrote ''Female Quixotism: Exhibited in the Romantic Opinions and Extravagant Adventure of Dorcasina Sheldon'' in 1801; Royall Tyler wrote ''The Algerine Captive'' in 1797.&lt;ref name="wsu.edu"/&gt;

Other notable authors include [[William Gilmore Simms]], who wrote ''Martin Faber'' in 1833, ''Guy Rivers'' in 1834, and ''[[The Yemassee]]'' in 1835. [[Lydia Maria Child]] wrote ''Hobomok'' in 1824 and ''The Rebels'' in 1825. [[John Neal (writer)|John Neal]] wrote ''Logan, A Family History'' in 1822, ''Rachel Dyer'' in 1828, and ''The Down-Easters'' in 1833. [[Catherine Maria Sedgwick]] wrote ''A New England Tale'' in 1822, ''Redwood'' in 1824, ''[[Hope Leslie]]'' in 1827, and ''The Linwoods'' in 1835. [[James Kirke Paulding]] wrote ''The Lion of the West'' in 1830, ''The Dutchman's Fireside'' in 1831, and ''Westward Ho!'' in 1832. [[Robert Montgomery Bird]] wrote ''Calavar'' in 1834 and ''[[Nick of the Woods]]'' in 1837. [[James Fenimore Cooper]] was also a notable author best known for his novel, ''[[The Last of the Mohicans]]'' written in 1826.&lt;ref name="wsu.edu"/&gt;  [[George Tucker (politician)|George Tucker]] produced in 1824 the first fiction of Virginia colonial life with ''The Valley of Shenandoah''. He followed in 1827 with one of the country's first science fictions, ''A Voyage to the Moon: With Some Account of the Manners and Customs, Science and Philosophy, of the People of Morosofia, and Other Lunarians.''

==Unique American style==
[[File:Edgar Allan Poe portrait.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Edgar Allan Poe]]]]

After the [[War of 1812]], there was an increasing desire to produce a uniquely American literature and culture, and a number of literary figures emerged, among them [[Washington Irving]], [[William Cullen Bryant]], and [[James Fenimore Cooper]]. Irving wrote humorous works in ''[[Salmagundi (periodical)|Salmagundi]]'' and the satire ''[[A History of New York|A History of New York, by Diedrich Knickerbocker]]'' (1809). Bryant wrote early romantic and nature-inspired poetry, which evolved away from their European origins.

Cooper's ''[[Leatherstocking Tales]]'' about [[Natty Bumppo]] (which includes ''[[The Last of the Mohicans]]'') were popular both in the new country and abroad. In 1832, [[Edgar Allan Poe]] began writing short stories – including "[[The Masque of the Red Death]]", "[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]", "[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]", and "[[The Murders in the Rue Morgue]]" – that explore previously hidden levels of human psychology and push the boundaries of fiction toward [[mystery fiction|mystery]] and [[fantasy]]. 

Humorous writers were also popular and included [[Seba Smith]] and [[Benjamin Penhallow Shillaber]] in [[New England]] and [[Davy Crockett]], [[Augustus Baldwin Longstreet]], [[Johnson J. Hooper]], [[Thomas Bangs Thorpe]], and [[George Washington Harris]] writing about the American frontier.

The [[Boston Brahmin|New England Brahmins]] were a group of writers connected to [[Harvard University]] and [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. They  included [[James Russell Lowell]], [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], and [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]]

[[File:Ralph Waldo Emerson ca1857.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]]]
In 1836, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], a former minister, published his essay ''Nature'', which argued that men should dispense with organized religion and reach a lofty spiritual state by studying and interacting with the natural world. Emerson's work influenced the writers who formed the movement now known as [[Transcendentalism]], while Emerson also influenced the public through his lectures.  

Among the leaders of the Transcendental movement was [[Henry David Thoreau]], a nonconformist and a close friend of Emerson. After living mostly by himself for two years in a cabin by a wooded pond, Thoreau wrote ''[[Walden]]'', a memoir that urges resistance to the dictates of society. Thoreau's writings demonstrate a strong American tendency toward individualism. Other Transcendentalists included [[Amos Bronson Alcott]], [[Margaret Fuller]], [[George Ripley (transcendentalist)|George Ripley]], [[Orestes Brownson]], and [[Jones Very]].&lt;ref&gt;Gura, Philip F. ''American Transcendentalism: A History''. New York: Hill and Wang, 2007: 7–8. {{ISBN|978-0-8090-3477-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As one of the great works of the Revolutionary period was written by a Frenchman, so too was a work about America from this generation. [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]'s two-volume ''[[Democracy in America]]'' described his travels through the young nation, making observations about the relations between American politics, individualism, and community.

The political conflict surrounding [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]] inspired the writings of [[William Lloyd Garrison]] and his paper ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]'', along with poet [[John Greenleaf Whittier]] and [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] in her world-famous ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''. These efforts were supported by the continuation of the slave narrative autobiography, of which the best known examples from this period include [[Frederick Douglass]]'s ''[[Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave]]'' and [[Harriet Jacobs]]'s ''[[Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl]]''.

At the same time, American Indian autobiography develops, most notably in [[William Apess]]'s ''A Son of the Forest'' and [[George Copway]]'s ''The Life, History and Travels of Kah-ge-ga-gah-bowh''. Moreover, minority authors were beginning to publish fiction, as in [[William Wells Brown]]'s ''[[Clotel|Clotel; or, The President's Daughter]]'', [[Frank J. Webb]]'s ''The Garies and Their Friends'',  [[Martin Delany]]'s ''Blake; or, The Huts of America'' and [[Harriet E. Wilson]]'s ''Our Nig'' as early African American novels, and [[John Rollin Ridge]]'s ''The Life and Adventures of [[Joaquin Murieta]]: The Celebrated California Bandit'', which is considered the first Native American novel but which also is an early story about [[Mexican American]] issues.

[[File:Nathaniel Hawthorne old.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]]]
In 1837, the young [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] (1804–1864) collected some of his stories as ''[[Twice-Told Tales]]'', a volume rich in symbolism and occult incidents. Hawthorne went on to write full-length "romances", quasi-allegorical novels that explore the themes of guilt, pride, and emotional repression in [[New England]]. His masterpiece, ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'', is a drama about a woman cast out of her community for committing adultery.

Hawthorne's fiction had a profound impact on his friend [[Herman Melville]] (1819–1891), who first made a name for himself by turning material from his seafaring days into exotic sea narrative novels. Inspired by Hawthorne's focus on allegories and psychology, Melville went on to write romances replete with philosophical speculation. In ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', an adventurous whaling voyage becomes the vehicle for examining such themes as obsession, the nature of evil, and human struggle against the elements.

In the short novel ''[[Billy Budd (novel)|Billy Budd]]'', Melville dramatizes the conflicting claims of duty and compassion on board a ship in time of war. His more profound books sold poorly, and he had been long forgotten by the time of his death. He was rediscovered in the early 20th century.

Anti-transcendental works from Melville, Hawthorne, and Poe all comprise the [[Dark romanticism|Dark Romanticism]] sub-genre of popular literature at this time.

American dramatic literature, by contrast, remained dependent on European models, although many playwrights did attempt to apply these forms to American topics and themes, such as immigrants, westward expansion, temperance, etc. At the same time, American playwrights created several long-lasting American character types, especially the "Yankee", the "Negro" and the "Indian", exemplified by the characters of [[Brother Jonathan|Jonathan]], [[Sambo (racial term)|Sambo]] and [[Metamora; or, The Last of the Wampanoags|Metamora]]. In addition, new dramatic forms were created in the [[Tom Shows]], the [[showboat|showboat theater]] and the [[minstrel show]]. Among the best plays of the period are [[James Nelson Barker]]'s ''Superstition; or, the Fanatic Father'', [[Anna Cora Mowatt]]'s ''Fashion; or, Life in New York'', [[Nathaniel Bannister]]'s ''[[Putnam, the Iron Son of '76]]'', [[Dion Boucicault]]'s ''[[The Octoroon|The Octoroon; or, Life in Louisiana]]'', and [[Cornelius Mathews]]'s ''Witchcraft; or, the Martyrs of Salem''.

==Early American poetry==
{{See also|American poetry}}
[[File:Whitman-young.jpg|thumb|left|[[Walt Whitman]], 1856]]
The [[Fireside Poets]] (also known as the Schoolroom or Household Poets) were some of America's first major poets domestically and internationally. They were known for their poems being easy to memorize due to their general adherence to poetic form (standard [[Poetry#Form|form]]s, regular [[Meter (poetry)|meter]], and [[rhyme]]d [[stanza]]s) and were often recited in the home (hence the name) as well as in school (such as "[[Paul Revere's Ride (poem)|Paul Revere's Ride]]"), as well as working with distinctly American themes, including some political issues such as abolition. They included [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], [[William Cullen Bryant]], [[John Greenleaf Whittier]], [[James Russell Lowell]], and [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]]. Longfellow achieved the highest level of acclaim and is often considered the first internationally acclaimed American poet, being the first American poet given a bust in Westminster Abbey's Poets' Corner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/5654 "A Brief Guide to the Fireside Poets"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116214914/http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/5654 |date=January 16, 2014 }} at [http://www.Poets.org Poets.org]. Accessed 10-07-2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walt Whitman]] (1819–1892) and [[Emily Dickinson]] (1830–1886), two of America's greatest 19th-century poets could hardly have been more different in temperament and style. [[Walt Whitman]]  was a working man, a traveler, a self-appointed nurse during the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865), and a poetic innovator. His magnum opus was ''[[Leaves of Grass]]'', in which he uses a free-flowing verse and lines of irregular length to depict the all-inclusiveness of American democracy. Taking that motif one step further, the poet equates the vast range of American experience with himself without being egotistical. For example, in ''[[Song of Myself]]'', the long, central poem in ''Leaves of Grass'', Whitman writes: "These are really the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands, they are not original with me ..."

In his words Whitman was a poet of "the body electric". In ''[[Studies in Classic American Literature]]'', the English novelist [[D. H. Lawrence]] wrote that Whitman "was the first to smash the old moral conception that the soul of man is something 'superior' and 'above' the flesh."

By contrast, [[Emily Dickinson]] lived the sheltered life of a genteel unmarried woman in small-town [[Amherst, Massachusetts]]. Her poetry is ingenious, witty, and penetrating. Her work was unconventional for its day, and little of it was published during her lifetime. Many of her poems dwell on the topic of death, often with a mischievous twist. One, "[[Because I could not stop for Death]]", begins, "He kindly stopped for me." The opening of another Dickinson poem toys with her position as a woman in a male-dominated society and an unrecognized poet: "I'm nobody! Who are you? / Are you nobody too?" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.edickinson.org/search|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124023453/http://www.edickinson.org/search|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2018-01-24|title=Emily Dickinson Archive|date=2018-01-24|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American poetry arguably reached its peak in the early-to-mid-20th century, with such noted writers as [[Wallace Stevens]] and his ''[[Harmonium (poetry collection)|Harmonium]]'' (1923) and ''The Auroras of Autumn'' (1950), [[T. S. Eliot]] and his ''[[The Waste Land]]'' (1922), [[Robert Frost]] and his ''[[North of Boston]]'' (1914) and ''[[New Hampshire (poetry collection)|New Hampshire]]'' (1923), [[Hart Crane]] and his ''[[White Buildings]]'' (1926) and the epic cycle, ''[[The Bridge (long poem)|The Bridge]]'' (1930), [[Ezra Pound]], [[William Carlos Williams]] and his epic poem about his New Jersey hometown, ''[[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]]'', [[Marianne Moore]], [[E. E. Cummings]], [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]] and [[Langston Hughes]], in addition to many others.

==Realism, Twain and James==
[[File:MarkTwain1907.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mark Twain]], 1907]]

Mark Twain (the pen name used by [[Mark Twain|Samuel Langhorne Clemens]], 1835–1910) was the first major American writer to be born away from the East Coast – in the border state of [[Missouri]]. His regional masterpieces were the memoir ''[[Life on the Mississippi]]'' and the novels ''[[Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'' and ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]''. Twain's style – influenced by journalism, wedded to the vernacular, direct and unadorned but also highly evocative and irreverently humorous – changed the way Americans write their language. His characters speak like real people and sound distinctively American, using local dialects, newly invented words, and regional accents.

Other writers interested in regional differences and dialect were [[George W. Cable]], [[Thomas Nelson Page]], [[Joel Chandler Harris]], [[Mary Noailles Murfree]] ([[Charles Egbert Craddock]]), [[Sarah Orne Jewett]], [[Mary E. Wilkins Freeman]], [[Henry Cuyler Bunner]], and William Sydney Porter ([[O. Henry]]). A version of local color regionalism that focused on minority experiences can be seen in the works of [[Charles W. Chesnutt]] (African American), of [[María Ruiz de Burton]], one of the earliest [[Mexican American]] novelists to write in English, and in the [[Yiddish]]-inflected works of [[Abraham Cahan]].

[[William Dean Howells]] also represented the [[realism (arts)|realist]] tradition through his novels, including ''[[The Rise of Silas Lapham]]'' and his work as editor of ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''.

[[Henry James]] (1843–1916) confronted the Old World-New World dilemma by writing directly about it. Although he was born in New York City, James spent most of his adult life in England. Many of his novels center on Americans who live in or travel to Europe. With its intricate, highly qualified sentences and dissection of emotional and psychological nuance, James's fiction can be daunting. Among his more accessible works are the novellas ''[[Daisy Miller]]'', about an American girl in Europe, and ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]'', a ghost story.

Realism began to influence American drama, partly through Howells, but also through Europeans such as Ibsen and Zola. Although realism was most influential in set design and staging—audiences loved the special effects offered up by the popular melodramas—and in the growth of [[American literary regionalism|local color]] plays, it also showed up in the more subdued, less romantic tone that reflected the effects of the Civil War and continued social turmoil on the American psyche.

The most ambitious attempt at bringing modern realism into the drama was [[James Herne]]'s ''[[Margaret Fleming]]'', which addressed issues of social determinism through realistic dialogue, psychological insight, and symbolism. The play was not successful, and both critics and audiences thought it dwelt too much on unseemly topics and included improper scenes, such as the main character nursing her husband's illegitimate child onstage.

==Beginning of the 20th century==
[[File:Ernest Hemingway in Milan 1918 retouched 3.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Ernest Hemingway]] in World War I uniform]]

At the beginning of the 20th century, American novelists were expanding fiction to encompass both high and low life and sometimes connected to the [[naturalism (literature)|naturalist]] school of realism. In her stories and novels, [[Edith Wharton]] (1862–1937) scrutinized the upper-class, [[Northeast megalopolis|Eastern-seaboard]] society in which she had grown up. One of her finest books, ''[[The Age of Innocence]]'', centers on a man who chooses to marry a conventional, socially acceptable woman rather than a fascinating outsider.

At about the same time, [[Stephen Crane]] (1871–1900), best known for his Civil War novel ''[[The Red Badge of Courage]]'', depicted the life of New York City prostitutes in ''[[Maggie: A Girl of the Streets]]''. And in ''[[Sister Carrie]]'', [[Theodore Dreiser]] (1871–1945) portrayed a country girl who moves to [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] and becomes a kept woman. [[Hamlin Garland]] and [[Frank Norris]] wrote about the problems of American farmers and other social issues from a naturalist perspective.

Political writings discussed social issues and the power of corporations. [[Edward Bellamy]]'s ''[[Looking Backward]]'' outlined other possible political and social orders, and [[Upton Sinclair]], most famous for his muck-raking novel ''[[The Jungle]]'', advocated [[socialism]]. Other political writers of the period included [[Edwin Markham]] and [[William Vaughn Moody]]. Journalistic critics, including [[Ida M. Tarbell]] and [[Lincoln Steffens]], were labeled "The Muckrakers". [[Henry Brooks Adams]]'s literate autobiography, ''[[The Education of Henry Adams]]'' also depicted a stinging description of the education system and modern life.

Race was a common issue as well, as seen in the work of [[Pauline Hopkins]], who published five influential works from 1900 to 1903. Similarly, [[Sui Sin Far]] wrote about Chinese-American experiences, and [[Maria Cristina Mena]] wrote about Mexican-American experiences.

===1920s===
[[File:Francis Scott Fitzgerald 1937 June 4 (1) (photo by Carl van Vechten).jpg|thumb|200px|[[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], photographed by [[Carl van Vechten]], 1937]]
The 1920s brought sharp changes to American literature. Many writers had direct experience of the First World War, and they used it to frame their writings.&lt;ref&gt;Hazel Hutchison, ''The War That Used Up Words: American Writers and the First World War'' (Yale University Press, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimentation in style and form soon joined the new freedom in subject matter. In 1909, [[Gertrude Stein]] (1874–1946), by then an expatriate in Paris, published ''[[Three Lives]]'', an innovative work of fiction influenced by her familiarity with cubism, jazz, and other movements in contemporary art and music. Stein labeled a group of American literary notables who lived in Paris in the 1920s and 1930s the "[[Lost Generation]]".

The poet [[Ezra Pound]] (1885–1972) was born in [[Idaho]] but spent much of his adult life in Europe. His work is complex, sometimes obscure, with multiple references to other art forms and to a vast range of literature, both Western and Eastern.&lt;ref&gt;Noel Stock, ''The Life of Ezra Pound'' (1970)&lt;/ref&gt; He influenced many other poets, notably [[T. S. Eliot]] (1888–1965), another expatriate. Eliot wrote spare, cerebral poetry, carried by a dense structure of symbols. In ''[[The Waste Land]]'', he embodied a jaundiced vision of post–World War I society in fragmented, haunted images. Like Pound's, Eliot's poetry could be highly allusive, and some editions of ''The Waste Land'' come with footnotes supplied by the poet. In 1948, Eliot won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Kenner, ''The invisible poet: TS Eliot'' (1965).&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry James, Stein, Pound, and Eliot demonstrate the growth of an international perspective in American literature. American writers had long looked to European models for inspiration, but whereas the literary breakthroughs of the mid-19th century came from finding distinctly American styles and themes, writers from this period were finding ways of contributing to a flourishing international literary scene, not as imitators but as equals. Something similar was happening back in the States, as Jewish writers (such as [[Abraham Cahan]]) used the English language to reach an international Jewish audience.

[[File:Carl Van Vechten - William Faulkner.jpg|thumb|200px|[[William Faulkner]] in 1954]]
American writers also expressed the disillusionment following upon the war. The stories and novels of [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] (1896–1940) capture the restless, pleasure-hungry, defiant mood of the 1920s. Fitzgerald's characteristic theme, expressed poignantly in ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'', is the tendency of youth's golden dreams to dissolve in failure and disappointment. Fitzgerald also elucidates the collapse of some key American Ideals, such as liberty, social unity, good governance and peace, features which were severely threatened by the pressures of modern early 20th century society.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Meyers, ''Scott Fitzgerald: A Biography'' (HarperCollins, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sinclair Lewis]] and [[Sherwood Anderson]] also wrote novels with critical depictions of American life. [[John Dos Passos]] wrote about the war and also the [[U.S.A. trilogy]] which extended into the Depression.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell Geismar,  ''American moderns, from rebellion to conformity'' (1958)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernest Hemingway]] (1899–1961) saw violence and death first-hand as an ambulance driver in World War I, and the carnage persuaded him that abstract language was mostly empty and misleading. He cut out unnecessary words from his writing, simplified the sentence structure, and concentrated on concrete objects and actions. He adhered to a moral code that emphasized grace under pressure, and his protagonists were strong, silent men who often dealt awkwardly with women. ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]'' and ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]'' are generally considered his best novels; in 1954, he won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Keith Ferrell, ''Ernest Hemingway: The Search for Courage'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Faulkner]] (1897–1962) won the Nobel Prize in 1949, after Hitler was defeated in World War II: Faulkner encompassed an enormous range of humanity in [[Yoknapatawpha County]], a [[Mississippi]]an region of his own invention. He recorded his characters' seemingly unedited ramblings in order to represent their inner states, a technique called "[[Stream of consciousness writing|stream of consciousness]]". (In fact, these passages are carefully crafted, and their seemingly chaotic structure conceals multiple layers of meaning.) He also jumbled time sequences to show how the past – especially the slave-holding era of the [[Deep South]] – endures in the present. Among his great works are ''[[Absalom, Absalom!]]'', ''[[As I Lay Dying (novel)|As I Lay Dying]]'', ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]'', and ''[[Light in August]]''.&lt;ref&gt;John T. Matthews, ''William Faulkner: seeing through the South'' (Wiley, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==The rise of American drama==
{{See also|Theater of the United States}}
Although the American theatrical tradition can be traced back to the arrival of [[Lewis Hallam]]'s troupe in the mid-18th century and was very active in the 19th century, as seen by the popularity of [[minstrel show]]s and of [[Tom Shows|adaptations of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'']], American drama attained international status only in the 1920s and 1930s, with the works of [[Eugene O'Neill]], who won four [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama|Pulitzer Prizes]] and the [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize]].

In the middle of the 20th century, American drama was dominated by the work of playwrights [[Tennessee Williams]] and [[Arthur Miller]], as well as by the maturation of the American [[musical theatre|musical]], which had found a way to integrate script, music and dance in such works as ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' and ''[[West Side Story]]''. Later American playwrights of importance include [[Edward Albee]], [[Sam Shepard]], [[David Mamet]], [[August Wilson]] and [[Tony Kushner]].

==Depression-era literature==
{{see|List of writers of the Lost Generation}}
[[Great Depression|Depression]] era literature was blunt and direct in its social criticism. [[John Steinbeck]] (1902–1968) was born in [[Salinas, California]], where he set many of his stories. His style was simple and evocative, winning him the favor of the readers but not of the critics. Steinbeck often wrote about poor, working-class people and their struggle to lead a decent and honest life. ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'', considered his masterpiece, is a strong, socially-oriented novel that tells the story of the Joads, a poor family from Oklahoma and their journey to [[California]] in search of a better life.

Other popular novels include ''[[Tortilla Flat]]'', ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'', ''[[Cannery Row (novel)|Cannery Row]]'', and ''[[East of Eden (novel)|East of Eden]]''. He was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1962. Steinbeck's contemporary, [[Nathanael West]]'s two most famous short novels, ''[[Miss Lonelyhearts]],'' which plumbs the life of its eponymous [[antihero]], a reluctant (and, to comic effect, male) [[advice columnist]], and the effects the tragic letters exert on it, and ''[[The Day of the Locust]]'', which introduces a cast of Hollywood stereotypes and explores the ironies of the movies, have come to be avowed classics of American literature.

In non-fiction, [[James Agee]]'s ''[[Let Us Now Praise Famous Men]]'' observes and depicts the lives of three struggling tenant-farming families in Alabama in 1936. Combining factual reporting with poetic beauty, Agee presented an accurate and detailed report of what he had seen coupled with insight into his feelings about the experience and the difficulties of capturing it for a broad audience. In doing so, he created an enduring portrait of a nearly invisible segment of the American population.

[[Henry Miller]] assumed a unique place in American Literature in the 1930s when his semi-autobiographical novels, written and published in Paris, were banned from the US. Although his major works, including ''[[Tropic of Cancer (novel)|Tropic of Cancer]]'' and ''[[Black Spring (novel)|Black Spring]]'', would not be free of the label of [[obscenity]] until 1962, their themes and stylistic innovations had already exerted a major influence on succeeding generations of American writers, and paved the way for sexually frank 1960s novels by [[John Updike]], [[Philip Roth]], [[Gore Vidal]], [[John Rechy]] and [[William Styron]].

==Post–World War II==

===The postwar novel===
[[File:Normanmailer.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Norman Mailer]], photographed by Carl Van Vechten, 1948]]

The period in time from the end of World War II up until, roughly, the late 1960s and early 1970s saw the publication of some of the most popular works in American history such as ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' by [[Harper Lee]]. The last few of the more realistic [[modernist]]s along with the wildly Romantic [[beatnik]]s largely dominated the period, while the direct respondents to America's involvement in World War II contributed in their notable influence.

Though born in Canada, Chicago-raised [[Saul Bellow]] would become one of the most influential novelists in America in the decades directly following World War II. In works like ''[[The Adventures of Augie March]]'' and ''[[Herzog (novel)|Herzog]]'', Bellow painted vivid portraits of the American city and the distinctive characters that peopled it. Bellow went on to win the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1976.

From [[J.D. Salinger]]'s ''[[Nine Stories (Salinger)|Nine Stories]]'' and ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' to [[Sylvia Plath]]'s ''[[The Bell Jar]]'', the perceived madness of the state of affairs in America was brought to the forefront of the nation's literary expression. Immigrant authors such as [[Vladimir Nabokov]], with ''[[Lolita]]'', forged on with the theme, and, at almost the same time, the [[beatnik]]s took a concerted step away from their [[Lost Generation]] predecessors, developing a style and tone of their own by drawing on Eastern theology and experimenting with recreational drugs.

The poetry and fiction of the "[[Beat Generation]]", largely born of a circle of intellects formed in New York City around [[Columbia University]] and established more officially some time later in San Francisco, came of age. The term ''Beat'' referred, all at the same time, to the countercultural rhythm of the Jazz scene, to a sense of rebellion regarding the conservative stress of post-war society, and to an interest in new forms of spiritual experience through drugs, alcohol, philosophy, and religion, and specifically through [[Zen Buddhism]].

[[Allen Ginsberg]] set the tone of the movement in his poem ''[[Howl]]'', a Whitmanesque work that began: "I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness..." Among the most representative achievements of the Beats in the novel are [[Jack Kerouac]]'s ''[[On the Road]]'' (1957), the chronicle of a soul-searching travel through the continent, and [[William S. Burroughs]]'s ''[[Naked Lunch]]'' (1959), a more experimental work structured as a series of vignettes relating, among other things, the narrator's travels and experiments with [[hard drugs]].

Regarding the war novel specifically, there was a literary explosion in America during the post–World War II era. Some of the best known of the works produced included [[Norman Mailer]]'s ''[[The Naked and the Dead]]'' (1948), [[Joseph Heller]]'s ''[[Catch-22]]'' (1961) and [[Kurt Vonnegut Jr.]]'s ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'' (1969). ''[[The Moviegoer]]'' (1962), by Southern author [[Walker Percy]], winner of the National Book Award, was his attempt at exploring "the dislocation of man in the modern age."&lt;ref name="NYT_Conversations"&gt;Kimball, Roger [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E5D81238F937A3575BC0A963948260 Existentialism, Semiotics and Iced Tea, Review of Conversations with Walker Percy] New York Times, August 4, 1985, Accessed September 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Updike with Bushes new.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Updike]]]]

In contrast, [[John Updike]] approached American life from a more reflective but no less subversive perspective. His 1960 novel ''[[Rabbit, Run]],'' the first of four chronicling the rising and falling fortunes of [[Rabbit Angstrom|Harry "Rabbit" Angstrom]] over the course of four decades against the backdrop of the major events of the second half of the 20th century, broke new ground on its release in its characterization and detail of the American middle class and frank discussion of [[taboo]] topics such as [[adultery]]. Notable among Updike's characteristic innovations was his use of present-tense narration, his rich, stylized language, and his attention to sensual detail. His work is also deeply imbued with [[Christian]] themes. The two final installments of the Rabbit series, ''[[Rabbit is Rich]]'' (1981) and ''[[Rabbit at Rest]]'' (1990), were both awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]]. Other notable works include the [[Henry Bech]] novels (1970–98), ''[[The Witches of Eastwick]]'' (1984), ''[[Roger's Version]]'' (1986) and ''[[In the Beauty of the Lilies]]'' (1996), which literary critic [[Michiko Kakutani]] called "arguably his finest."&lt;ref name="kakutani"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/12/books/books-of-the-times-seeking-salvation-on-the-silver-screen.html|title=Seeking Salvation On the Silver Screen|last=Kakutani|first=Michiko|work=[[The New York Times]] Books|date=January 12, 1996|accessdate=December 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequently linked with Updike is the novelist [[Philip Roth]]. Roth vigorously explores [[Jewish identity]] in American society, especially in the postwar era and the early 21st century. Frequently set in [[Newark, New Jersey]], Roth's work is known to be highly autobiographical, and many of Roth's main characters, most famously the Jewish novelist [[Nathan Zuckerman]], are thought to be [[alter ego]]s of Roth. With these techniques, and armed with his articulate and fast-paced style, Roth explores the distinction between reality and fiction in literature while provocatively examining American culture. His most famous work includes the Zuckerman novels, the controversial ''[[Portnoy's Complaint]]'' (1969), and ''[[Goodbye, Columbus]]'' (1959). Among the most decorated American writers of his generation, he has won every major American literary award, including the Pulitzer Prize for his major novel ''[[American Pastoral]]'' (1997).

In the realm of African-American literature, [[Ralph Ellison]]'s 1952 novel ''[[Invisible Man]]'' was instantly recognized as among the most powerful and important works of the immediate post-war years. The story of a black [[Notes from Underground|Underground Man]] in the urban north, the novel laid bare the often repressed racial tension that still prevailed while also succeeding as an [[existentialism|existential]] character study. [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]] was catapulted to fame by the publication in subsequent years of his now widely studied short story, "[[The Man Who Was Almost a Man]]" (1939), and his controversial second novel, ''[[Native Son]]'' (1940), and his legacy was cemented by the 1945 publication of ''[[Black Boy]]'', a work in which Wright drew on his childhood and mostly [[autodidactic]] education in the segregated South, fictionalizing and exaggerating some elements as he saw fit. Because of its polemical themes and Wright's involvement with the [[Communist Party]], the novel's final part, "American Hunger," was not published until 1977.

Perhaps the most ambitious and challenging post-war American novelist was [[William Gaddis]], whose uncompromising, satiric, and large novels, such as ''[[The Recognitions]]'' (1955) and ''[[J R]]'' (1975) are presented largely in terms of unattributed dialog that requires almost unexampled reader participation. Gaddis's primary themes include forgery, capitalism, religious zealotry, and the legal system, constituting a sustained polyphonic critique of modern American life. Gaddis's work, though largely ignored for years, anticipated and influenced the development of such ambitious "postmodern" fiction writers as [[Thomas Pynchon]], [[David Foster Wallace]], [[Joseph McElroy]], [[William H. Gass]], and [[Don DeLillo]]. Another neglected and challenging postwar American novelist, albeit one who wrote much shorter works, was [[John Hawkes (novelist)|John Hawkes]], whose surreal [[visionary fiction]] addresses themes of violence and eroticism and experiments audaciously with narrative voice and style. Among his most important works is the short nightmarish novel ''[[The Lime Twig]]'' (1961).

===Short fiction and poetry===

In the postwar period, the art of the short story again flourished. Among its most respected practitioners was [[Flannery O'Connor]], who developed a distinctive [[Southern gothic]] esthetic in which characters acted at one level as people and at another as symbols. A devout Catholic, O'Connor often imbued her stories, among them the widely studied "[[A Good Man is Hard to Find]]" and "[[Everything That Rises Must Converge]]", and two novels, ''[[Wise Blood]]'' (1952); ''[[The Violent Bear It Away]]'' (1960), with deeply religious themes, focusing particularly on the search for truth and religious skepticism against the backdrop of the nuclear age. Other important practitioners of the form include [[Katherine Anne Porter]], [[Eudora Welty]], [[John Cheever]], [[Raymond Carver]], [[Tobias Wolff]], and the more experimental [[Donald Barthelme]].

Among the most respected of the postwar American poets are [[John Ashbery]], the key figure of the surrealistic [[New York School (art)|New York School]] of poetry, and his celebrated ''[[Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror (book)|Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror]]'' (Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, 1976); [[Elizabeth Bishop]] and her ''North &amp; South'' (Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, 1956) and "Geography III" (National Book Award, 1970); [[Richard Wilbur]] and his ''Things of This World,'' winner of both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award for Poetry in 1957;  [[John Berryman]] and his ''The Dream Songs'', (Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, 1964, National Book Award, 1968); [[A.R. Ammons]], whose ''Collected Poems 1951-1971'' won a National Book Award in 1973 and whose long poem ''Garbage'' earned him another in 1993; [[Theodore Roethke]] and his ''[[The Waking]]'' (Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, 1954); [[James Merrill]] and his epic poem of communication with the dead, ''[[The Changing Light at Sandover]]'' (Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, 1977); [[Louise Glück]] for her ''The Wild Iris'' (Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, 1993); [[W.S. Merwin]] for his ''The Carrier of Ladders'' (Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, 1971) and ''The Shadow of Sirius'' (Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, 2009); [[Mark Strand]] for ''Blizzard of One'' (Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, 1999); [[Robert Hass]] for his ''Time and Materials,'' which won both the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award for Poetry in 2008 and 2007 respectively; and [[Rita Dove]] for her ''Thomas and Beulah'' (Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, 1987).

In addition, in this same period the [[Confessional poetry|confessional]], whose origin is often traced to the publication in 1959 of [[Robert Lowell]]'s ''[[Life Studies]]'',&lt;ref name="Lowell"&gt;[http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/5960 Groundbreaking Book: Life Studies by Robert Lowell (1959)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529005428/http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/5960 |date=May 29, 2010 }} Accessed May 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and [[beat poetry|beat]] schools of poetry enjoyed popular and academic success, producing such widely anthologized voices as [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Charles Bukowski]], [[Gary Snyder]], [[Anne Sexton]], and [[Sylvia Plath]], among many others.

==Contemporary American literature==

Though its exact parameters remain disputable, from the early 1970s to the present day the most salient literary movement has been [[postmodernism]]. [[Thomas Pynchon]], a seminal practitioner of the form, drew in his work on modernist fixtures such as temporal distortion, unreliable narrators, and [[internal monologue]] and coupled them with distinctly postmodern techniques such as [[metafiction]], [[ideogram]]matic characterization, unrealistic names (Oedipa Maas, Benny Profane, etc.), [[Absurdist fiction|absurdist]] plot elements and hyperbolic humor, deliberate use of [[anachronisms]] and [[archaism]]s, a strong focus on [[postcolonial]] themes, and a subversive commingling of high and low culture. In 1973, he published ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'', a leading work in this genre, which won the [[National Book Award]] and was unanimously nominated for the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]] that year. His other major works include his debut, ''[[V.]]'' (1963), ''[[The Crying of Lot 49]]'' (1966), ''[[Mason &amp; Dixon]]'' (1997), and ''[[Against the Day]]'' (2006).

[[Toni Morrison]], recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature, writing in a distinctive lyrical prose style, published her controversial debut novel, ''[[The Bluest Eye]]'', to critical acclaim in 1970. Coming on the heels of the signing of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1965]], the novel, widely studied in American schools, includes an elaborate description of incestuous rape and explores the conventions of beauty established by a historically racist society, painting a portrait of a self-immolating black family in search of beauty in whiteness. Since then, Morrison has experimented with lyric fantasy, as in her two best-known later works, ''[[Song of Solomon (novel)|Song of Solomon]]'' (1977) and ''[[Beloved (novel)|Beloved]]'' (1987), for which she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction; along these lines, critic [[Harold Bloom]] has drawn favorable comparisons to [[Virginia Woolf]],&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Harold: ''How to Read and Why'', page 269. Touchstone Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Nobel committee to "Faulkner and to the Latin American tradition [of [[magical realism]]]."&lt;ref name="nobelmorrison"&gt;"Nobel Prize Nobel Prize Award Ceremony Speech". Nobelprize.org. 19 Aug 2010 [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1993/presentation-speech.html]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Beloved'' was chosen in a 2006 survey conducted by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as the most important work of fiction of the last 25 years.&lt;ref name="nytsurvey"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/21/books/fiction-25-years.html|title=What Is the Best Work of American Fiction of the Last 25 Years?|work=The New York Times|date=May 21, 2006|accessdate=December 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in a lyrical, flowing style that eschews excessive use of the comma and semicolon, recalling [[William Faulkner]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]] in equal measure, [[Cormac McCarthy]] seizes on the literary traditions of several regions of the United States and includes multiple genres. He writes in the [[Southern Gothic]] aesthetic in his Faulknerian 1965 debut, ''[[The Orchard Keeper]]'', and ''[[Suttree]]'' (1979); in the [[Epic Western]] tradition, with grotesquely drawn characters and symbolic narrative turns reminiscent of Melville, in ''[[Blood Meridian]]'' (1985), which Harold Bloom styled "the greatest single book since Faulkner's ''[[As I Lay Dying (novel)|As I Lay Dying]]''," calling the character of [[Judge Holden]] "short of [[Moby Dick]], the most monstrous apparition in all of American literature";&lt;ref name="bloommccarthy"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/harold-bloom-on-blood-meridian,29214/|title=Harold Bloom on ''Blood Meridian''|last=Bloom|first=Harold|work=A.V. Club|date=June 15, 2009|accessdate=March 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a much more pastoral tone in his celebrated [[The Border Trilogy|Border Trilogy]] (1992–98) of ''[[bildungsroman]]s'', including ''[[All the Pretty Horses (novel)|All the Pretty Horses]]'' (1992), winner of the [[National Book Award]]; and in the [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] genre in the Pulitzer Prize-winning ''[[The Road]]'' (2007). His novels are noted for achieving both commercial and critical success, several of his works having been [[Film adaptation|adapted to film]].

[[Don DeLillo]], who rose to literary prominence with the publication of his 1985 novel, ''[[White Noise (novel)|White Noise]]'', a work broaching the subjects of death and consumerism and doubling as a piece of comic social criticism, began his writing career in 1971 with ''[[Americana (novel)|Americana]]''. He is listed by Harold Bloom as being among the preeminent contemporary American writers, in the company of such figures as Philip Roth, Cormac McCarthy, and Thomas Pynchon.&lt;ref name="bloom_novelists"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2003/09/24/dumbing_down_american_readers/|title=Dumbing down American readers|last=Bloom|first=Harold|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=September 24, 2003|accessdate=December 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1997 novel ''[[Underworld (DeLillo novel)|Underworld]]'' chronicles American life through and immediately after the [[Cold War]] and is usually considered his masterpiece. It was also the runner-up in a survey that asked writers to identify the most important work of fiction of the last 25 years.&lt;ref name="nytsurvey" /&gt; Among his other important novels are ''[[Libra (novel)|Libra]]'' (1988), ''[[Mao II]]'' (1991) and ''[[Falling Man (novel)|Falling Man]]'' (2007).

[[File:Jonathan Franzen at the Brooklyn Book Festival.jpg|thumb|175px|left|[[Jonathan Franzen]] at the 2008 [[Brooklyn Book Festival]]]] 
Seizing on the distinctly postmodern techniques of [[digression]], narrative fragmentation and elaborate [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], and strongly influenced by the works of Thomas Pynchon, [[David Foster Wallace]] began his writing career with ''[[The Broom of the System]]'', published to moderate acclaim in [[1987 in literature|1987]]. His second novel, ''[[Infinite Jest]]'' (1997), a futuristic portrait of America and a playful critique of the media-saturated nature of American life, has been consistently ranked among the most important works of the 20th century,&lt;ref name="time100"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/the_complete_list.html|title=All-Time 100 Novels: The Complete List|work=Time Magazine|accessdate=December 4, 2009|date=October 16, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his final novel, unfinished at the time of his death, [[The Pale King]] (2011), has garnered much praise and attention. In addition to his novels, he also authored three acclaimed short story collections: ''[[Girl with Curious Hair]]'' (1989), ''[[Brief Interviews with Hideous Men]]'' (1999) and ''[[Oblivion: Stories]]'' (2004).

[[Jonathan Franzen]], Wallace's friend and contemporary, rose to prominence after the 2001 publication of his [[National Book Award]]-winning third novel, ''[[The Corrections]]''. He began his writing career in [[1988 in literature|1988]] with the well-received ''[[The Twenty-Seventh City]]'', a novel centering on his native [[St. Louis, MO|St. Louis]], but did not gain national attention until the publication of his essay, [[Why Bother? (essay)|"Perchance to Dream,"]] in [[Harper's Magazine]], discussing the cultural role of the writer in the new millennium through the prism of his own frustrations. ''[[The Corrections]]'', a [[tragicomedy]] about the disintegrating Lambert family, has been called "the literary phenomenon of [its] decade"&lt;ref name="timefranzen"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,2010000,00.html|title=Jonathan Franzen: Great American Novelist|work=Time Magazine|accessdate=August 16, 2010 | first=Lev | last=Grossman | date=August 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was ranked as one of the greatest novels of the past century.&lt;ref name="time100" /&gt; In 2010, he published ''[[Freedom (Franzen novel)|Freedom]]'' to great critical acclaim.&lt;ref name="timefranzen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kakutani_franzen"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/16/books/16book.html?ref=books|title=A Family Full of Unhappiness, Hoping for Transcendence|work=The New York Times|first=Michiko|last=Kakutani|date=August 15, 2010|accessdate=August 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tanenhaus_franzen"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/29/books/review/Tanenhaus-t.html?ref=books|title=Peace and War|work=The New York Times|first=Sam|last=Tanenhaus|date=August 19, 2010|accessdate=August 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable writers at the turn of the century include [[Michael Chabon]], whose Pulitzer Prize-winning ''[[The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay]]'' (2000) tells the story of two friends, Joe Kavalier and Sam Clay, as they rise through the ranks of the [[comics]] industry in its heyday; [[Denis Johnson]], whose 2007 novel ''[[Tree of Smoke]]'' about falsified intelligence during Vietnam both won the National Book Award and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and was called by critic [[Michiko Kakutani]] "one of the classic works of literature produced by [the [[Vietnam War]]]";&lt;ref name="kakutani_johnson"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/31/books/31book.html|title=In Vietnam: Stars and Stripes, and Innocence Undone|work=The New York Times|accessdate=April 17, 2010 | first=Michiko | last=Kakutani | date=2007-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Louise Erdrich]], whose 2008 novel ''The Plague of Doves'', a distinctly Faulknerian, polyphonic examination of the tribal experience set against the backdrop of murder in the fictional town of Pluto, North Dakota, was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize, and her [[2012 in literature|2012]] novel ''The Round House'', which builds on the same themes, was awarded the [[National Book Award for Fiction#2010 to date.5B40.5D|2012 National Book Award]].&lt;ref name="national_book_erdrich"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-2012#.ULu_iYUx9D0|title=2012 National Book Awards|work=National Book Foundation|accessdate=December 2, 2012|date=November 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minority literatures==
[[File:SandraCisneros.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Sandra Cisneros]] best known for her first novel ''[[The House on Mango Street]]'' (1984) and her subsequent short story collection ''[[Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories]]'' (1991). She is the recipient of numerous awards including a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship, and is regarded as a key figure in [[Chicano literature|Chicana literature]].&lt;ref name="Madsen2000"&gt;{{Harvnb|Madsen|2000|p= 107}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

One of the developments in late-20th-century American literature was the increase of literature written by and about ethnic minorities beyond African Americans and Jewish Americans. This development came alongside the growth of the Civil Rights movements and its corollary, the Ethnic Pride movement, which led to the creation of [[Ethnic Studies]] programs in most major universities. These programs helped establish the new ethnic literature as worthy objects of academic study, alongside such other new areas of literary study as [[women's literature]], [[gay and lesbian literature]], working-class literature, [[postcolonial literature]], and the rise of [[literary theory]] as a key component of academic literary study.

After being relegated to cookbooks and autobiographies for most of the 20th century, Asian American literature achieved widespread notice through [[Maxine Hong Kingston]]'s fictional memoir, ''[[The Woman Warrior]]'' (1976), and her novels ''China Men'' (1980) and ''[[Tripmaster Monkey|Tripmaster Monkey: His Fake Book]]''. [[Chinese-American]] author [[Ha Jin]] in 1999 won the [[National Book Award]] for his second novel, ''[[Waiting (novel)|Waiting]]'', about a Chinese soldier in the [[National Revolutionary Army|Revolutionary Army]] who has to wait 18 years to divorce his wife for another woman, all the while having to worry about persecution for his protracted affair, and twice won the [[PEN/Faulkner Award]], in 2000 for ''Waiting'' and in 2005 for ''[[War Trash]]''.

[[Indian-American]] author [[Jhumpa Lahiri]] won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for her debut collection of short stories, ''[[Interpreter of Maladies]]'' (1999), and went on to write a well-received novel, ''[[The Namesake]]'' (2003), which was shortly adapted to [[The Namesake (film)|film]] in 2007. In her second collection of stories, ''[[Unaccustomed Earth]]'', released to widespread commercial and critical success, Lahiri shifts focus and treats the experiences of the [[Immigrant generations|second and third generation]].

Other notable [[Asian-American]] novelists include [[Amy Tan]], best known for her novel, ''[[The Joy Luck Club (novel)|The Joy Luck Club]]'' (1989), tracing the lives of four immigrant families brought together by the game of [[Mahjong]], and Korean American novelist [[Chang-Rae Lee]], who has published ''[[Native Speaker (novel)|Native Speaker]]'', ''[[A Gesture Life]],'' and ''Aloft.'' Such poets as [[Marilyn Chin]] and [[Li-Young Lee]], [[Kimiko Hahn]] and [[Janice Mirikitani]] have also achieved prominence, as has playwright [[David Henry Hwang]]. Equally important has been the effort to recover earlier Asian American authors, started by [[Frank Chin]] and his colleagues; this effort has brought [[Sui Sin Far]], [[Toshio Mori]], [[Carlos Bulosan]], [[John Okada]], [[Hisaye Yamamoto]] and others to prominence.

Hispanic literature also became important during this period, starting with acclaimed novels by [[Tomás Rivera]] (''[[...y no se lo tragó la tierra]]'') and [[Rudolfo Anaya]] (''[[Bless Me, Ultima]]''), and the emergence of Chicano theater with [[Luis Valdez]] and ''[[Teatro Campesino]]''.  Latina writing became important thanks to authors such as [[Sandra Cisneros]], an icon of an emerging [[Chicano literature]] whose 1984 [[bildungsroman]] ''[[The House on Mango Street]]'' is taught in schools across the United States, [[Denise Chavez]]'s ''[[The Last of the Menu Girls]]'' and [[Gloria Anzaldúa]]'s ''[[Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza]]''.

[[Dominican-American]] author [[Junot Díaz]], received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for his 2007 novel ''[[The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao]]'', which tells the story of an overweight Dominican boy growing up as a [[social outcast]] in [[Paterson, New Jersey]]. Another Dominican author, [[Julia Alvarez]], is well known for ''[[How the García Girls Lost Their Accents]]'' and ''[[In the Time of the Butterflies]]''. [[Cuban American]] author [[Oscar Hijuelos]] won a Pulitzer for ''[[The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love]]'', and [[Cristina García (journalist)|Cristina García]] received acclaim for ''[[Dreaming in Cuban]].''

Celebrated Puerto Rican novelists who write in English and Spanish include [[Giannina Braschi]], author of the [[Spanglish]] classic [[Yo-Yo Boing!]] and [[Rosario Ferré]], best known for "Eccentric Neighborhoods"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/bookfest/author/giannina_braschi|accessdate=February 17, 2015|title=Giannina Braschi|work=National Book Festival|publisher=Library of Congress|year=2012|quote='Braschi: one of the most revolutionary voices in Latin America today'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Norton"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/norton-anthology-of-latino-literature/oclc/607322888|author=Ilan Stavans|accessdate=February 17, 2015|title=Norton Anthology of Latino Literature|publisher=Norton|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Puerto Rico has also produced important playwrights such as [[René Marqués]], [[Luis Rafael Sánchez]], and [[José Rivera (playwright)|José Rivera]] and New York based poets such as [[Julia de Burgos]], [[Giannina Braschi]] and [[Pedro Pietri]], as well as various members of the [[Nuyorican Poets Café]].&lt;ref name="Norton"/&gt;

Spurred by the success of [[N. Scott Momaday]]'s Pulitzer Prize–winning ''[[House Made of Dawn]]'', Native American literature showed explosive growth during this period, known as the [[Native American Renaissance]], through such novelists as [[Leslie Marmon Silko]] (e.g., ''[[Ceremony (Silko novel)|Ceremony]]''), [[Gerald Vizenor]] (e.g., ''[[Bearheart: The Heirship Chronicles]]'' and numerous essays on Native American literature), [[Louise Erdrich]] (''[[Love Medicine]]'' and several other novels that use a recurring set of characters and locations in the manner of [[William Faulkner]]), [[James Welch (writer)|James Welch]] (e.g., ''[[Winter in the Blood]]''), [[Sherman Alexie]] (e.g., ''[[The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven]]''), and poets [[Simon Ortiz]] and [[Joy Harjo]]. The success of these authors has brought renewed attention to earlier generations, including [[Zitkala-Sa]], [[John Joseph Mathews]], [[D'Arcy McNickle]] and [[Mourning Dove (author)|Mourning Dove]].

More recently, [[Arab American literature]], largely unnoticed since the [[New York Pen League]] of the 1920s, has become more prominent through the work of [[Diana Abu-Jaber]], whose novels include ''[[Arabian Jazz]]'' and ''Crescent'' and the memoir ''The Language of Baklava''.

[[Bernard of Clairvaux]]'s '''''Apologia ad Guillelmum''''' was written in 1125 at the ostensible request of his friend and fellow monastic reformer, [[William of St-Thierry|William of Saint-Thierry]], and is the key document in the early twelfth century controversy over art, the greatest controversy over art to occur in the West previous to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Things-Greater-Importance-Clairvauxs-Apologia/dp/0812281810|title=The "Things of Greater Importance": Bernard of Clairvaux's Apologia and the Medieval Attitude Toward Art|last=Rudolph|first=Conrad|date=1990-07-01|publisher=Univ of Pennsylvania Pr|isbn=9780812281811|edition=First|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Already in the [[Early Christianity|Early Christian period]], there was disagreement within the Church as to the appropriateness of [[Catholic Church art|religious art]].  While the use of religious art gradually came to be accepted by the mainstream, its rejection within certain limits remained a constant throughout the Middle Ages.  In the twelfth century, certain elements within reform monasticism (especially the [[Cistercians]] but also others) saw the use of art by monks as inappropriate for a number of reasons.  Criticism of the use of monastic art was seen as a criticism of the greatest patrons of religious art of the time, traditional [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monasticism (virtually all of the greatest medieval art up until this time had been religious).  Since traditional Benedictine monasticism was one of the richest and most influential segments of society—and since art was one of the great vehicles of interaction between traditional monasticism and the lay public, this interaction being an important source of wealth for monasticism—the controversy over art that arose involved far more than aesthetic questions.

The ''Apologia'' is the most articulate document we have for this controversy and one of the most important in understanding how medieval art was used and perceived.  In it, Bernard takes up five major criticisms of the use of monastic art.

== Art to attract donations ==

=== The monastic investment ===
Perhaps Bernard's harshest criticism of the monastic use of art addresses the economic base of monastic art production: the monastic investment in art for the purpose of attracting donations from the visiting public. In doing so, he takes up a number of different themes such as the justification of investing in art, art for the honor of God, the relation between material and spiritual prosperity, and the financial necessity of pilgrimage art.

=== The liturgical artwork ===
[[File:Master Of Saint Gilles - The Mass of St Gilles - WGA14485.jpg|thumb|''The Mass of Saint Giles'', by the [[Master of Saint Giles]], c. 1500 (National Gallery, London)]]
In discussing the artistic means by which the investment in art was carried out, Bernard particularly criticizes excess in art, focusing especially on excess in material, craftsmanship, size, and quantity.  In this criticism, what he most objects to is not monumental sculpture and painting but rather liturgical art, that is, works often of gold, silver, and jewels that were used in the liturgy and often in the Cult of Relics.

=== The equation between excessive art and holiness ===
In his critique of the reception of art on the part of the general public, Bernard took up the indispensable element of medieval pilgrimage art: the equation between excessive art and holiness, that is, the use of excessive art in order to create a sense of ''praesentia'' (the physical presence of the holy).

=== Art in opposition to the care of the poor ===
Following in the patristic tradition, Bernard also sees art as in opposition to the care of the poor, his most significant social objection external to monasticism properly speaking.

=== Art as a spiritual distraction to the monk ===
One of Bernard's most important criticisms of the monastic use of art is that of art as a spiritual distraction to the monk.  Aside from simple distraction, this criticism includes such dangers to the medieval monk as curiosity and materiality.

=== To Whom the Apologia Was Addressed ===
While the traditional view has been that the ''Apologia'' was directed at the art of the monastery of [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]] in particular and that of other offending Cluniac and traditional Benedictine monasteries in general, more recent scholarship has shown that the ''Apologia'' was instead directed at not only all of traditional monasticism but also marginal traditional Benedictine monasteries, the new ascetic orders ([[Carthusians]], [[Gilbertine Order|Gilbertines]], [[Premonstratensians]], and so on), and Bernard's own [[Cistercians|Cistercian Order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rudolph|first=Conrad|date=1988-01-01|title=Bernard of Clairvaux's Apologia as a Description of Cluny, and the Controversy over Monastic Art|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.2307/767000|journal=Gesta|volume=27|issue=1/2|pages=125–132|doi=10.2307/767000|issn=0016-920X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''balafon''' is a kind of [[xylophone]] or [[percussion]] [[idiophone]] which plays melodic tunes, and usually has between 16 and 27 keys. It has been played in Africa since the 12th century according to oral stories; it originated in Mali, according to the Manding history narrated by the [[griot]]s.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==History==
Believed to have been developed independently of the Southern African and South American instrument now called the [[marimba]], oral histories of the balafon date it to at least the rise of the [[Mali Empire]] in the 12th century CE. Balafon is a [[Manding languages|Manding]] name, but variations exist across West Africa, including the ''balangi'' in [[Sierra Leone]]&lt;ref&gt;Cootje Van Oven. "Music of Sierra Leone", in ''African Arts'', Vol. 3, No. 4 (Summer, 1970), pp. 20-27+71.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Balafon#Gyil|gyil]] of the [[Dagara people|Dagara]], [[Lobi people|Lobi]] and [[Gurunsi]] from [[Ghana]], [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Ivory Coast]]. Similar instruments are played in parts of [[Central Africa]], with the ancient [[Kingdom of Kongo]] denoting the instrument as ''palaku''.

Records of the balafon go back to at least the 12th century CE. In 1352 CE, Moroccan traveller [[Ibn Battuta]] reported the existence of the [[Xalam|ngoni]] and balafon at the court of [[Mali Empire|Malian]] ruler [[Suleyman (mansa)|Mansa Suleiman]].

European visitors to West Africa described balafons in the 17th century largely identical to the modern instrument. The [[Atlantic Slave Trade]] brought some balafon players to the Americas. The ''Virginia Gazette'' records African-Americans playing a ''barrafoo'' in 1776, which appears to be a balafon. Other North American references to these instruments die out by the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;cited in Dena J. Epstein. Sinful Tunes and Spirituals: Black Folk Music to the Civil War. University of Illinois Press (1977). {{ISBN missing|date=November 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The balafon has seen a resurgence since the 1980s in the growth of African [[Traditional music|Roots Music]] and [[World Music]]. Most famous of these exponents is the [[Rail Band]], led by [[Salif Keita]]. Even when not still played, its distinctive sound and traditional style has been exported to western instruments. Maninka from eastern [[Guinea]] play a type of [[guitar]] music that adapts balafon playing style to the imported instrument.

===Etymology===
 in the [[Mandinka language|Malinké]] language ''balafon'' is a compound of two words: ''balan'' is the name of the instrument and ''fô'' is the verb ''to play''. Balafon therefore is really the act of ''playing the bala''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Instruments/Anglais/dpbf_j_txt03a_en.html ''The balafon or balan (xylophone)'' by N'Gafien Inoussa, age 16, at "The Virtual Museum"]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070422093415/http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Instruments/Anglais/dpbf_j_txt03a_en.html |date=April 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bala'' still is used as the name of a large [[bass (sound)|bass]] balafon in the region of [[Kolokani]] and [[Bobo Dioulasso]]. These ''bala'' have especially long keys and huge calabashes for amplification. ''Balani'' is then used as the name of the high pitched, small balafon with small calabashes and short (3 to 4&amp;nbsp;cm long) keys. The ''balani'' is carried with a strap and usually has 21 keys, while the number of keys on a ''bala'' vary with region.

==Construction==
[[Image:Balafon Jamie.jpg|thumb|upright|Gum-rubber mallets on a balafon]]
A balafon can be either ''fixed-key'' (where the keys are strung over a fixed frame, usually with [[calabash]] resonators underneath) or ''free-key'' (where the keys are placed independently on any padded surface). The balafon usually has 17-21 keys, tuned to a [[tetratonic]], [[pentatonic]] or [[heptatonic]] scale, depending on the culture of the musician.

The balafon is generally capable of producing 18 to 21 notes, though some are built to produce many fewer notes (16, 12, 8 or even 6 and 7). Balafon keys are traditionally made from [[béné]] wood, dried slowly over a low flame, and then tuned by shaving off bits of wood from the underside of the keys. Wood is taken off the middle to [[Flat (music)|flatten]] the key or the end to [[Sharp (music)|sharpen]] it.

In a ''fixed-key'' balafon, the keys are suspended by leather straps just above a wooden frame, under which are hung graduated-size calabash [[gourd]] resonators. A small hole in each gourd is covered with a membrane traditionally of thin spider's-egg sac filaments (nowadays more usually of cigarette paper or thin plastic film) to produce the characteristic nasal-buzz timbre of the instrument, which is usually played with two gum-rubber-wound mallets while seated on a low stool (or while standing using a shoulder or waist sling hooked to its frame).

==Regional traditions==
As the balafon cultures vary across West Africa, so does the approach to the instrument itself. In many areas the balafon is played alone in a ritual context, in others as part of an ensemble. In Guinea and Mali, the balafon is often part of an ensemble of three, pitched low, medium and high. In Cameroon, six balafon of varying size perform together in an orchestra, called a ''komenchang''. An [[Igbo people|Igbo]] variation exists with only one large tuned key for each player. And while in most cases a single player hits multiple keys with two mallets, some traditions place two or more players at each keyboard.

The [[Susu people|Susu]] and [[Mandinka people|Malinké]] people of [[Guinea]] are closely identified with the balafon, as are the other [[Mandé peoples|Manding]] peoples of [[Mali]], [[Senegal]], and [[the Gambia]]. [[Cameroon]], [[Chad]], and even the nations of the [[Congo Basin]] have a long balafon traditions.

Often, balafon players will wear belled bracelets on each wrist, accentuating the sound of the keys.

In some cultures the balafon was (and in some still is) a sacred instrument, playable only by trained religious caste members and only at ritual events such as festivals, royal, funerial, or marriage celebrations. Here the balafon is kept in a temple storehouse, and can only be removed and played after undergoing purification rites. Specific instruments may be built to be only played for specific rituals and repertoires. Young adepts are trained not on the sacred instrument, but on ''free-key'' pit balafons.

===Gyil===
[[File:Gyil.JPG|thumbnail|The gyil of northwestern Ghana]]
The '''''gyil''''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|ˈ|dʒ|ɪ|l|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|iː|l}}) is the name of a buzzing [[pentatonic]] balafon common to the [[Gur languages|Gur]]-speaking populations in northern [[Ghana]], [[Burkina Faso]], southeastern [[Mali]] and northern [[Ivory Coast]] in [[West Africa]]. Among [[Mande people|Mande]] populations in Ghana like the [[Ligbi language|Ligbi]] (Numu), [[Bissa language|Bissa]] and [[Dyula language|Dyula]], the same instrument is known as ''bala''. The gyil is the primary traditional instrument of the [[Dagara people]] of northern Ghana and Burkina Faso, and of the [[Lobi people|Lobi]] of Ghana, southern Burkina Faso, and [[Ivory Coast]]. The gyil is usually played in pairs, accompanied by a calabash gourd drum called a ''kuor''. It can also be played by one person with the drum and the stick part as accompaniment, or by a soloist. Gyil duets are the traditional music of [[Dagara people|Dagara]] funerals. The instrument is generally played by men, who learn to play while young; however, there is no restriction on gender. It is also played by the [[Gurunsi]] people of the [[Upper East Region]] of Ghana, as well as neighbouring Gurunsi populations across the border in south and central Burkina Faso. A dance related to the gyil is the [[Bewaa]].

The gyil's design is similar to the ''balaba'' or balafon used by the [[Mande languages|Mande]]-speaking [[Bambara people|Bambara]], [[Dyula people|Dyula]] and [[Sosso]] peoples further west in southern [[Mali]] and western [[Burkina Faso]], as well as the [[Senoufo]] people of [[Sikasso]], a region that shares many musical traditions with those of northern Ivory Coast and Ghana. It is made with 14 wooden keys of an African hardwood called [[#gyil|liga]] attached to a wooden frame, below which hang [[calabash]] gourds.&lt;ref name="Colter2008"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://contexts.org/articles/winter-2008/harper/ | last = Harper | first = Colter | title = Life, Death, and Music in West Africa | journal = Contexts Magazine | year = 2008 | volume = Winter | pages = 44–51 | accessdate = 2008-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spider web silk covers small holes in the gourds to produce a buzzing sound and antelope sinew and leather are used for the fastenings.&lt;ref name="Colter2008" /&gt; The instrument is played with rubber-headed wooden mallets.

===Cameroon===
{{Main|Music of Cameroon#Modern Cameroonian music}}
During the 1950s, bars sprang up across Cameroon's capital to accommodate an influx of new inhabitants, and soon became a symbol for Cameroonian identity in the face of colonialism. Balafon orchestras, consisting of 3-5 balafons and various percussion instruments became common in these bars. Some of these orchestras, such as [[Richard Band de Zoetele]], became quite popular in spite of scorn from the European elite.

The middle of the 20th century saw the popularisation of a native [[folk music]] called [[bikutsi]]. Bikutsi is based on a war rhythm played with various [[rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]]s, [[drum]]s and balafon. Sung by women, bikutsi featured sexually explicit lyrics and songs about everyday problems. In a popularised form, bikutsi gained mainstream success in the 1950s. [[Anne-Marie Nzie]] was perhaps the most important of the early innovators The next bikutsi performer of legendary stature was [[Messi Me Nkonda Martin]] and his band, [[Los Camaroes]], who added [[electric guitar]]s and other new elements.

Balafon orchestras had remained popular throughout the 50s in Yaoundé's bar scene, but the audience demanded modernity and the popular style at the time was unable to cope. Messi Martin was a Cameroonian guitarist who had been inspired to learn the instrument by listening to [[Spanish language]]-broadcasts from neighboring [[Equatorial Guinea]], as well as [[Cuba]]n and [[Zaire]]an [[African Rumba|rumba]]. Messi changed the electric guitar by linking the strings together with pieces of paper, thus giving the instrument a damper tone that emitted a "thudding" sound similar to the balafon.

===Guinea===
The balafon, [[Kora (instrument)|kora]] (lute-harp), and the [[Ngoni (instrument)|ngoni]] (the ancestor of the [[banjo]]) are the three instruments most associated with [[griot]] bardic traditions of West Africa. Each is more closely associated with specific areas, communities, and traditions, though all are played together in ensembles throughout the region. [[Guinea]] has been the historic heartland of solo balafon. As griot culture is a hereditary caste, the [[Kouyaté]] family has been called the ''keepers of the balafon'', and twentieth century members of this family have helped introduce it throughout the world.

==== The Sosso Bala ====
[[File:SoussousGuiembeBalafon.jpg|thumb|[[Djembe]] and balafo, Guinea]]
The Sosso Bala is a balafon, currently kept in the town of [[Niagassola]], [[Guinea]] that is reputed to be ''the'' original balafon, constructed over 800 years ago. The [[Epic of Sundiata]], a story of the formation of the [[Mali Empire]], tells that a griot named [[Bala Faséké Kouyaté]] convinced [[Sosso]] king [[Sumanguru Kante]] to employ him after sneaking into Sumanguru's palace and playing the sacred instrument. [[Sundiata Keita]], founder of the Mali Empire overthrew Sumanguru, seized the balafon, and made the griot Faséké its guardian. This honor is said to have passed down through his family, the Kouyatés, and conveys upon them mastership of the balafon to this day.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.jumbierecords.com/about/sossobala.html Preserving the Sosso Bala]", ''JumbieRecords.com'': a charity record to raise funds for preserving this instrument.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the truth of this story, the Sosso Bala is an instrument of great age, and was named by [[UNESCO]] as one of the Nineteen [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.unesco.org/bpi/intangible_heritage/guinea.htm The Cultural Space of 'Sosso-Bala' in Niagassola, Guinea]", ''UNESCO.org''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Senegal ===
The title of the [[Senegal]]ese National Anthem is "[[Pincez Tous vos Koras, Frappez les Balafons]]" (''Everyone strum your [[Kora (instrument)|kora]]s, strike the balafons'').

===Mali===

A modern festival devoted to the balafon, the [[Triangle du balafon]], now takes place annually at [[Sikasso]] in [[Mali]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maliculture.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=122&amp;Itemid=1 Mali Ministry of Culture.] ''Le Triangle du Balafon: Projet de Festival du Balafon, Troisieme Edition, Sikasso – 02 au 05 Novembre 2006'', (2006). {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304145020/http://www.maliculture.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=122&amp;Itemid=1 |date=March 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Bearded Slave''''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Schiavo barbuto'') is a [[marble]] sculpture by [[Michelangelo]] datable to around 1525–1530 and kept in the [[Galleria dell'Accademia]] in [[Florence]]. It forms part of the series of "unfinished" Prigioni intended for the [[Tomb of Pope Julius II]].

== History ==
It seems that, from the first design of the [[Tomb of Pope Julius II]] (1505), a series of "Prigioni" was planned for the bottom level of the mausoleum, a series of statues larger than life size of chained figures in various poses, leaning on pilasters which would frame niches containing [[Victoria (mythology)|winged Victories]] and be surmounted by herms. With a pair on each side of each niche, there must initially have been sixteen or twenty such statues planned. This number was reduced in successive designs, to twelve (second version, 1513), eight (third version, 1516) and finally maybe only four (fourth version, 1526, or fifth version, 1532), before being eliminated from the project altogether in the final version of 1542.

The first members of the series, who are mentioned in Michelangelo's letters are the two ''Prigioni'' of Paris, named the "Slaves" in the nineteenth century: the ''[[Dying Slave]]'' and the ''[[Rebellious Slave]]''. They were carved in [[Rome]] around 1513.

The Florentine ''Prigioni'' (''[[Young Slave]], Bearded Slave, [[Atlas Slave]]'' and the ''[[Awakening Slave]]'') were probably carved instead in the second half of the 1520s, while Michelangelo was employed at [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence|San Lorenzo]] in [[Florence]] (but historians suggest dates between 1519 and 1534). It is known that they were in the artist's warehouse on the via Mozza in 1544, when his nephew Leonardo Buonarroti asked permission to sell them (Michelangelo did not visit Florence after 1534). The permission was denied and only in 1564 were they donated, along with ''[[the Genius of Victory]]'', to the Grand Duke [[Cosimo I]] who placed them at the four corners of the [[Grotto of Buontalenti]] in 1591. They were removed from there in 1908, in order to be reunited with other works of Michelangelo in the Florentine gallery.

With respect to the exact date, Justi (and others) propose 1519, on the basis of a letter of 13 February, in which [[Jacopo Salviati]] promised the cardinal Aginesis, Julius II's heir, that the sculptor would have the four figures for the tomb ready by the summer of that year; Wilde proposes 1523, pointing to a statement of the cardinal Giulio de' Medici (the future [[Clement VII]]) who had seen them before he departed for Rome in that year; finally [[Charles de Tolnay|de Tolnay]] dates them to 1530–1534 on the basis on their style, frequent references to incomplete sculptures for the pope's tomb in letters of 1531–2 and [[Vasari]]'s statement that they were created while the artist was preparing the cartoon of ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]]''.

== Description and style ==
The ''Bearded Slave'' is the most finished of the Florentine ''Prigioni'' and gets his name from his thick, curly beard. The way his muscular torso twists indicates a deep knowledge of anatomy, typical of the best works of Michelangelo; his legs, slightly bent and separated, are covered by a band of fabric. His right arm is raised to hold his bent head, while his left hand remains unfinished, but seems to hold the band of fabric.

The whole surface retains many traces of the various chisels and scrapers used on the sculpture. Along his hips there is a repaired fracture, whose cause is unknown.

Its unfinished state creates an extraordinary energy (already noted by Bocchi in 1591), with the figure caught in a sort of primordial act of freeing himself from the cage of the rough stone, an epic battle with the forces of chaos. The iconographic meaning of the figures was probably linked to the motif of the ''captivi'' in Roman art, and indeed [[Vasari]] identified the ''Prigioni'' as personifications of the provinces controlled by Julius II. For [[Ascanio Condivi|Condivi]], however, they symbolised the Arts, made "prisoners" by the death of the pontif. Other scholars have made proposals of a philosophical/symbolic character or connected to the artist's personal life and his "torments".

The '''Binagadi asphalt lake''' (or '''Binagadi tar pits''') are a cluster of [[tar pit]]s in urban [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]].  [[Asphaltum]] or [[tar]] has seeped up from the ground in this area for tens of thousands of years.  The tar is often covered with dust, leaves, or water.  Over many centuries, animals that were trapped in the tar were preserved as bones.

This ancient flora and fauna deposit is protected by the State as a monument of a nature of the special significance pursuant to the Decree of the Government of Azerbaijan Republic No. 167 of March 16, 1982.&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1175/ "Binegadi" 4th Period Fauna and Flora Deposit]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography of the area ==
The Binagady locality is on the crest of a hill 0.5&amp;nbsp;km southeast of the settlement of Binagady, and 7&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Baku]]. The coast at its closest is 10&amp;nbsp;km to the south and 25&amp;nbsp;km to the north.&lt;ref name="Vereshchagin"/&gt; 

The bone-bearing area comprises approximately 1.5 hectares and is located on a hilltop near the Kyrrar hill. The area is 54–57 m above present sea level, and 48 m above the level of [[Lake Boyukshor]]. An ancient mud volcano (Kichik-Dag) lies north of the fossiliferous area; further to the north is the meridionally elongated, saline Lake Masazyr (Mirdalyabi) and to the northeast Lake Binagady. To the east is the saline depression Kariatakh-Shor, beyond which rises the Balakhany Plateau. Extending from the Binagady hill are oil-bearing Salinas and the saline Lake Beyuk-Shor, which stretches far to the southeast.&lt;ref name="Vereshchagin"/&gt;

==Natural-Historical Museum==

Binagadi fauna and flora deposit is richer by number of Quaternary animal relics than the Californian [[La Brea Tar Pits]]. The Binagadi deposit is important in studying the [[paleobiology]] of entire [[Caucasus]], [[Middle East]], and the European part of [[Post-Soviet states|NIS countries]].&lt;ref name="unesco"/&gt;

==Discovery of the first==
The locality was discovered in 1938 by a student, Mastan-Zade, who was studying the Apsheron bitumens. The first excavations were organized 
by Bogachev in 1938 (Azerbaidzhan branch of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R.). The excavations continued until 1941 with the participation of Kasabova and Sultanov and were resumed in 1946 under the supervision of Burchak-Abramovich.&lt;ref name="Vereshchagin"&gt;N. K.

'''Caribbean people''' are the people born in or inhabitants [[Caribbean]] region or people of Caribbean descent living outside the Caribbean. The Caribbean region was initially populated by [[Amerindians]] from several different [[Island Caribs|Kalinago]] and [[Arawak|Taino]] groups. These groups were decimated by a combination of slavery and disease brought by [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonizers]]. Descendants of the Taino and Kalinago tribes exist today in the Caribbean and elsewhere but are usually of partial Amerindian ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ufdcimages.uflib.ufl.edu/CA/00/40/02/47/00001/PDF.pdf The Caribbean as a Melting Pot]&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Caribbean people usually further identify by their own specific ethnic ancestry, therefore constituting various subgroups, largest of which are: [[Afro-Caribbean]] (largely descendants of emancipated African slaves) [[White Caribbean]] (largely descendants of [[History of the Caribbean|European colonizers]]) and [[Indo-Caribbean]] (largely descendants of [[Girmityas|jahaji]] [[indentured workers]]).

'''Daniel Klein''' ({{lang-lt|Danielius Kleinas}}) (1609–1666) was a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[pastor]] and scholar from [[Tilsit]], [[Duchy of Prussia]], who is best known for writing the first [[grammar]] book of the [[Lithuanian language]].

Klein studied [[philosophy]], [[theology]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] in the [[University of Königsberg]]. In 1637 he became a Lutheran pastor.

In 1653 Klein published the first grammar book of the Lithuanian language (''Grammatica Litvanica''), written in [[Latin]]. Klein coined the distinctive Lithuanian letter [[Ė]].&lt;ref&gt;{{DOClink|[http://www.euro-languages.net/lithuania/upload/files/euro_languages_lt_25.doc The Lithuanian Language: Traditions and Trends, Giedrius Subačius]|1.5 MB}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote a Lithuanian dictionary, but it was left unpublished.

Klein published collections of Lithuanian [[hymn]]s (Lit. ''giesmes''), some of which he wrote himself.

The '''Decadent Movement''' was a late 19th-century [[Art movement|artistic]] and [[literary movement|literary]] movement, centered in [[Western Europe]], that followed an aesthetic ideology of excess and artificiality. The visual artist [[Félicien Rops]]'s body of work and [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]]'s novel ''[[À rebours|Against Nature]]'' (1884) are considered the prime examples of the decadent movement. It first flourished in France and then spread throughout Europe and to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Critical Theory - Oxford Reference, pp.113-114&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was characterized by self-disgust, sickness at the world, general skepticism, delight in perversion and employment of crude humor and a belief in the superiority of [[human creativity]] over logic and the natural world.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Symbolist Landscapes: The Place of Painting in the Poetry and Criticism of Mallarmé and His Circle|last=Kearns|first=James|publisher=MHRA|year=1989|isbn=094762323X|location=|pages=15|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Against the Grain|last=Huysmans|first=Joris-Karl|publisher=Lieber &amp; Lewis|year=1922|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Project Gutenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The concept of decadence dates from the eighteenth century, especially from the writings of [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosopher who suggested that the decline (''[[decadence|décadence]]'') of the Roman Empire was in large part due to their moral decay and loss of cultural standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.constitution.org/cm/ccgrd_l.htm|title=Considerations on the Causes of the Greatness of the Romans and their Decline|last=Montesqieu|first=Charles-Louis de Secondat|publisher=The Free Press, New York.  Collier-Macmillan, London.|others=Translated by David Lowenthal|year=1965|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Constitution Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;   When Latin scholar [[Désiré Nisard]] turned toward French literature, he compared [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Romanticism]] in general to the Roman decadence, men sacrificing their craft and their cultural values for the sake of pleasure.  The trends that he identified, such as an interest in description, a lack of adherence to the conventional rules of literature and art, and a love for extravagant language were the seeds of the Decadent Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Desmarais|first=Jane|date=|year=2013|others=Edited by Jane Ford, Kim Edwards Keates, Patricia Pulham|title=Perfume Clouds: Olfaction, Memory, and Desire in Arthur Symon's London Nights (1895)|url=|journal=Economies of Desire at the Victorian Fin de Siècle: Libidinal Lives|volume=|page=|pages=62–82|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== French Decadent Movement ===
The first major development in French decadence would come when writers [[Théophile Gautier]] and [[Charles Baudelaire]] used the word proudly, to represent a rejection of what they considered banal "progress."&lt;ref name="Drowninginlimbo"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?isbn=0947757813|title=An anthology of French symbolist &amp; decadent writing|publisher=Atlas Press|year=1994|isbn=0947757813|page=12|author=Remy de Gourmont|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baudelaire referred to himself as decadent in his 1857 edition of [[Les Fleurs du mal|''Les Fleurs du Mal'']] and exalted the Roman decline as a model for modern poets to express their passion. He would later use the term ''decadence'' to  include the subversion of traditional categories in pursuit of full, sensual expression.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Five Faces of Modernity: Modernism, Avant-garde, Decadence, Kitsch, Postmodernism|last=Calinescu|first=Matei|publisher=Duke University|year=1987|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his lengthy introduction to Baudelaire in the front of the 1868 ''Les Fleurs du Mal,'' Gautier at first rejects the application of the term  decadent, as meant by the critic, but then works his way to an admission of decadence on Baudelaire's own terms: a preference for what is beautiful and what is exotic, an ease with surrendering to fantasy, and a maturity of skill with manipulating language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gautier|first=Theophile|year=1868|others=Collection authored by Charles Baudelaire|title=Charles Baudelaire|url=|journal=Les Fleurs du Mal|volume=|pages=|via=WikiSource (France)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though he was Belgian, [[Félicien Rops]] was instrumental in the development of this early stage of the Decadent Movement.  A friend of Baudelaire,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Censorship Effect: Baudelaire, Flaubert, and the Formation of French Modernism|last=Olmsted|first=William|publisher=Oxford|year=2016|isbn=9780190238636|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was also a frequent illustrator of Baudelaire's writing, at the request of the author himself.  Rops delighted in breaking artistic convention and shocking the public with gruesome, fantastical horror.  He was explicitly interested in the Satanic, and he frequently sought to portray the double-threat of Satan and Woman.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Egoists, a Book of Supermen: Stendahl, Baudelaire, Flaubert, Anatole France, Huysmans, Barrès, Nietzsche, Blake, Ibsen, Stirner, and Ernest Hello|last=Huneker|first=James|publisher=|year=1909|isbn=0404105254|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Kindle Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Colour of Angels: Cosmology, Gender and the Aesthetic Imaginatio|last=Classen|first=Constance|publisher=Routledge|year=1998|isbn=0415180740|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At times, his only goal was the portrayal of a woman he'd observed debasing herself in the pursuit of her own pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hideous Absinthe: A History of the Devil in a Bottle|last=Adams|first=Jad|publisher=Tauris Parke|year=2008|isbn=1845116844|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been suggested that, no matter how horrific and perverse his images could be, Rops' invocation of supernatural elements was sufficient to keep Baudelaire situated in a spiritually-aware universe that maintained a cynical kind of hope, even if the poetry "requires a strong stomach."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Their work was the worship of beauty disguised as the worship of evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Charles Baudelaire: A Study|last=Symons|first=Arthur|publisher=Eklin Matthews|year=1920|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Gutenberg Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For both of them, mortality and all manner of corruptions were always on their mind.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  The ability of Rops to see and portray the same world as they did, made him a popular illustrator for other decadent authors.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The concept of decadence lingered after that, but it wasn't until 1884 that Maurice Barrès referred to a particular group of writers as ''Decadents.'' He defined this group as those who had been influenced heavily by Baudelaire, though they were also influenced by [[Gothic novel]]s and the poetry and fiction of [[Edgar Allan Poe]].  Many were associated with [[symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], others with [[Aestheticism]].&lt;ref name="Stephan1974"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRoNAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA165|title=Paul Verlaine and the Decadence, 1882-90|first=Philip|publisher=Manchester University Press ND|year=1974|isbn=978-0-7190-0562-6|location=|page=|pages=|quote=|via=|author=Stephan|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/fnart/symbolist/texts/decadence_chronology.html A Chronology], retrieved December 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weir1995"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WOb26cxGBfMC&amp;pg=PA16|title=Decadence and the Making of Modernism|publisher=Univ of Massachusetts Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0-87023-992-2|page=16|author=David Weir|accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pursuit of these authors, according to [[Arthur Symons]], was "a desperate endeavor to give sensation, to flash the impression of the moment, to preserve the very heat and motion of life," and their achievement, as he saw it, was "to be a disembodied voice, and yet the voice of a human soul."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://harpers.org/sponsor/balvenie/arthur-symons.1.html|title=The Decadent Movement in Literature|last=Symons|first=Arthur|date=1893|website=Harpers.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1884 decadent novel ''[[À rebours|À Rebours]] (''English, ''Against Nature'' or ''Against the Grain''), [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]] overthrew the past, subordinated nature to the human creative will, and suggested the primacy of, but inherent disillusion in, pleasure.  He also identified likely candidates for the core of the Decadent Movement, which he seemed to view Baudelaire as sitting above: [[Paul Verlaine]], [[Tristan Corbière]], Theodore Hannon, and [[Stéphane Mallarmé]].  His character Des Esseintes hailed these writers for their creativity and their craftsmanship, suggesting that they filled him with "insidious delight" as they used a "secret language" to explore "twisted and precious ideas."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Not only did ''Against Nature'' define an ideology and a literature, but it also created an influential perspective on visual art.  The character of Des Esseintes explicitly heralded the work of [[Gustave Moreau]], [[Jan Luyken]], and [[Odilon Redon]].  None of these artists would have identified themselves as part of this movement.  Nevertheless, the choice of these three established a decadent perspective on art which favored madness and irrationality, graphic violence, frank pessimism about cultural institutions, and a disregard for visual logic of the natural world.  It has also been suggested that a dream vision that Des Esseintes describes is based on the series of satanic encounters painted by Félicien Rops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valazza|first=Nicolas|year=2010|others=Edited by Amaleena Damle and Aurelie L'Hostis|title=The Flower and the Monster: On Huysmans' Painters|url=|journal=The Beautiful and the Monstrous: Essays in French Literature, Thought and Culture|series=Modern French Identities|volume=|page=96|pages=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capitalizing on the momentum of Huysmans' work, Anatole Baju founded the magazine ''Le Décadent'' in 1886, an effort to define and organize the Decadent Movement in a formal way.  This group of writers did not only look to escape the boredom of the banal, but they also sought to shock, scandalize, and subvert the expectations and values of society, believing that such freedom and creative experimentation would better humanity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Not everyone was comfortable with Baju and ''Le Décadent,'' even including some who had been published in its pages.  Rival writer [[Jean Moréas]] published his [[Symbolist Manifesto]], largely to escape association with the Decadent Movement, despite their shared heritage.  Moréas and [[Gustave Kahn]], among others, formed rival publications to reinforce the distinction.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Legitimizing the Artist: Manifesto Writing and European Modernism, 1885-1915|last=Somigli|first=Luca|publisher=University of Toronto|year=2003|isbn=1442657731|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Verlaine embraced the label at first, applauding it as a brilliant marketing choice by Baju.  After seeing his own words exploited and tiring of ''Le Décadent'' publishing works falsely attributed to [[Arthur Rimbaud]], however, Verlaine came to sour on Baju personally, and he eventually rejected the label, as well.&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;

Decadence continued on in France, but it was limited largely to Anatole Baju and his followers, who refined their focus even further on perverse sexuality, material extravagance, and up-ending social expectations.  Far-fetched plots were acceptable if they helped generate the desired moments of salacious experience or glorification of the morbid and grotesque.  Writers who embraced the sort of decadence featured in ''Le Décadent'' include [[Albert Aurier]], [[Rachilde]], Pierre Vareilles, [[Miguel Hernández|Miguel Fernandez]], [[Jean Lorrain]], and [[Laurent Tailhade|Laurent Tailhaide]].  Many of these authors did also publish symbolist works, however, and it unclear how strongly they would have identified with Baju as decadents.&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In France, the Decadent Movement is often said to have begun with either [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]]' ''[[À rebours|Against Nature]]'' (1884) or  Baudelaire's ''Les Fleur du Mal''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studiocleo.com/librarie/baudelaire/essay.html ''Baudelaire and the Decadent Movement''] by [[Paul Bourget]], retrieved December 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  This movement essentially gave way to Symbolism when ''Le Décadent'' closed down in 1889 and Anatole Baju turned toward politics and became associated with anarchy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  A few writers continued the decadent tradition, such as Octave [[Octave Mirbeau|Mirbeau]], but Decadence was no longer a recognized movement, let alone a force in literature or art.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-Century Thought|last=Everdell|first=William R.|publisher=University of Chicago|year=1997|isbn=9780226224817|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with the association of decadence with cultural decline, it is not uncommon to associate decadence in general with transitional times and their associated moods of pessimism and uncertainty.  In France, the heart of the Decadent Movement was during the 1880s and 1890s, the time of [[fin de siècle]], or end-of-the-century gloom.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  As part of that overall transition, many scholars of Decadence, such as [[David Weir (academic)|David Weir]], regard Decadence as a dynamic transition between [[Romanticism]] and [[Modernism]], especially considering the decadent tendency to dehumanize and distort in the name of pleasure and fantasy.&lt;ref name="Weir1995" /&gt;

=== Distinction from Symbolism ===
[[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] has often been confused with the Decadent Movement. Arthur Symons, a British poet and literary critic contemporary with the movement, at one time considered Decadence in literature to be a parent category that included both Symbolism and [[Impressionism (literature)|Impressionism]], as rebellions against realism.  He defined this common, decadent thread as, "an intense self-consciousness, a restless curiosity in research, an over-subtilizing refinement upon refinement, a spiritual and moral perversity."  He referred to all such literature as, "a new and beautiful and interesting disease."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Later, however, he would go on to instead describe the Decadent Movement as an "interlude, half a mock interlude" that distracted critics from seeing and appreciating the larger and more important trend, which was the development of Symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Symbolist Movement in Literature|last=Symons|first=Arthur|publisher=E. P. Dutton|year=1919|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is true that the two groups share an ideological descent from Baudelaire and for a time they both considered themselves as part of one sphere of new, anti-establishment literature.  They worked together and met together for quite a while, as if they were part of the same movement.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Maurice Barrès referred to this group as decadents, but he also referred to one of them (Stéphane Mallarmé) as a symbolist.  Even Jean Moréas used both terms for his own group of writers as late as 1885.&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;

Only a year later, however, [[Jean Moréas]] wrote his [[Symbolist Manifesto]] to assert a difference between the symbolists with whom he allied himself and this the new group of decadents associated with Anatole Baju and ''Le Décadent''.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;  Even after this, there was sufficient common ground of interest, method, and language to  blur the lines more than the manifesto might have suggested.&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;

In the world of visual arts, it can be even more difficult to distinguish decadence from symbolism.  In fact, Stephen Romer has referred to [[Félicien Rops]], [[Gustave Moreau]], and Fernand Khnopff as "Symbolist-Decadent painters and engravers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=French Decadent Tales|last=Romer|first=Stephen|publisher=Oxford|year=2013|isbn=0199569274|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there are clear ideological differences between those who continued on as symbolists and those who have been called "dissidents" for remaining in the Decadent Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephan|first=Philip|year=1972|title=Naturalist Influences on Symbolist Poetry, 1882-86.|url=|journal=The French Review|volume=46|pages=299–311}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often, there was little doubt that Baju and his group were producing work that was decadent, but there is frequently more question about the work of the symbolists.&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;

In a website associated with Dr. Petra Dierkes-Thrun's [[Stanford University]] course, Oscar Wilde and the French Decadents (2014), a student named Reed created a blog post that is the basis for much of what follows.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wildedecadence.wordpress.com/2014/03/03/the-differences-between-symbolism-and-decadence/|title=The Differences between Symbolism and Decadence|date=2014-03-03|website=Oscar Wilde and the French Decadents|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== On Nature ====
Both groups reject the primacy of nature, but what that means for them is very different.  Symbolism uses extensive natural imagery as a means to elevate the viewer to a plane higher than the banal reality of nature itself, as when Stéphane Mallarmé mixes descriptions of flowers and heavenly imagery to create a transcendent moment in "Flowers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/54372|title=Flowers|last=Mallarmé|first=Stéphane|date=|website=Poetry Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decadence, in contrast, actually belittles nature in the name of artistry. In Huysmans’ ''Against Nature'', for instance, the main character Des Esseintes says of nature: “There is not one of her inventions, no matter how subtle or imposing it may be, which human genius cannot create . . . There can be no doubt about it: this eternal, driveling, old woman is no longer admired by true artists, and the moment has come to replace her by artifice."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== On Language and Imagery ====
Symbolism treats language and imagery as devices that can only approximate meaning and merely evoke complex emotions and call the mind toward ideas it might not be able to comprehend.  In the words of symbolist poet [[Stéphane Mallarmé]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;Languages are imperfect because multiple; the supreme language is missing... no one can utter words which would bear the miraculous stamp of Truth Herself Incarnate... how impossible it is for language to express things... in the Poet's hands... by the consistent virtue and necessity of an art which lives on fiction, it achieves its full efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mallarmé|first=Stéphane|year=1956|others=Translated by Bradford Cook|title=from Crisis in Poetry|url=https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/media/0076/mallarme.PDF|journal=Mallarmé: Selected Prose Poems, Essays &amp; Letters|volume=|pages=|via=Scan from an un-cited anthology on Amerhert's website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;As Moréas would go on to assert in his manifest on symbolism, words and images serve to dress up the incomprehensible in such a way that it can be approached, if not understood.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mutablesound.com/home/?p=2165|title=Symbolist Manifesto|last=Moréas|first=Jean|date=1886|website=Mutable Sound|others=Translated by C. Liszt|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decadence, on the other hand, sees no path to higher truth in words and images.  Instead, books, poetry, and art itself as the creators of valid new worlds, thus the allegory of decadent Wilde's [[The Picture of Dorian Gray|Dorian Gray]] being poisoned by a book like a drug.  Words and artifice are the vehicles for human creativity, and Huysmans suggests that the illusions of fantasy have their own reality: "The secret lies in knowing how to proceed, how to concentrate deeply enough to produce the hallucination and succeed in substituting the dream reality for the reality itself."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== On Reality, Illusion, and Truth ====
Both groups are disillusioned with the meaning and truth offered by the natural world, rational thought, and ordinary society.  Symbolism turns its eyes toward Greater Purpose or on the Ideal, using dreams and symbols to approach these esoteric primal truths.  In Mallarme's poem “Apparition”, for instance, the word “dreaming” appears twice, followed by “Dream” itself with a capital D. In “The Windows,” he speaks of this decadent disgust of contentment with comfort and an endless desire for the exotic. He writes: “So filled with disgust for the man whose soul is callous, sprawled in comforts where his hungering is fed.” In this continuing search for the spiritual, therefore, Symbolism has been predisposed to concern itself with purity and beauty and such mysterious imagery as those of fairies.

In contrast, Decadence says there is no oblique approach to ultimate truth, because there is no secret, mystical truth.  They despise the very idea of searching for such a thing.  If there is truth of value, it is purely in the sensual experience of the moment.  The heroes of Decadent novels, for instance, have the unquenchable accumulation of luxuries and pleasure, often exotic, as their goal, would have space in its search for thrills for even the gory and the shocking.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In [[The Temptation of Saint Anthony (book)|''The'' ''Temptation of Saint Anthony'']], decadent [[Gustave Flaubert]] describes Saint Anthony's pleasure from watching disturbing scenes of horror.  Later Czech decadent Arthur Breisky has been quoted by scholars as speaking to both the importance of illusion and of beauty: "But isn’t it necessary to believe a beautiful mask more than reality?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bugge|first=Peter|year=2006|title=Naked Masks: Arthur Breisky or How to Be a Czech Decadent|url=http://slovoasmysl.ff.cuni.cz/node/123|journal=Word and Sense: A Journal of Interdisciplinary Theory and Criticism in Czech Studies|volume=|pages=|access-date=19 February 2017|via=Word and Sense website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== On Art ====
Ultimately, the distinction may best be seen in their approach to art. Symbolism is an accumulation of “symbols” that are there not to present their content but to evoke greater ideas that their symbolism cannot expressly utter.  According to Moréas, it is an attempt to connect the object and phenomena of the world to "esoteric primordial truths" that cannot ever be directly approached.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Decadence, on the other hand, is an accumulation of signs or descriptions acting as detailed catalogs of human material riches as well as artifice.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; It was Oscar Wilde who perhaps lay this out most clearly in ''[[The Decay of Lying]]'' with the suggestion of three doctrines on art, here excerpted into a list:
# "Art never expresses anything but itself."
# "All bad art comes from returning to Life and Nature, and elevating them into ideals."
# "Life imitates Art far more than Art imitates Life"
After which, he suggested a conclusion quite in contrast to Moréas' search for shadow truth: "Lying, the telling of beautiful untrue things, is the proper aim of Art."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Abstracts/Wilde_1889.html|title=The Decay of Lying|last=Wilde|first=Oscar|publisher=|year=1889|isbn=|location=|pages=|access-date=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence and legacy ==

=== Collapse of the Decadent Movement ===
In France, the Decadent Movement could not withstand the loss of its leading figures. Many of those associated with the Decadent Movement became symbolists after initially associating freely with decadents.  Paul Verlaine and Stéphane Mallarmé were among those, though both had been associated with Baju's ''Le Décadent'' for a time.&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;  Others kept a foot in each camp.  Albert Aurier wrote decadent pieces for ''Le Décadent'' and also wrote symbolist poetry and art criticism.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Decadent writer Rachilde was staunchly opposed to a symbolist take over of ''Le Décadent''&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt; even though her own one-act drama ''The Crystal Spider'' is almost certainly a symbolist work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kiebuzinska|first=Christine|year=1994|title=Behind the Mirror: Madame Rachilde's "The Crystal Spider"|url=|journal=Modern Language Studies|volume=24|pages=28–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, once strong voices for decadence, abandoned the movement altogether.  Joris-Karl Huysmans grew to consider ''Against Nature'' as the starting point on his journey into Roman Catholic symbolist work and the acceptance of hope.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Anatole Baju, once the self-appointed school-master of French decadence, came to think of the movement as naive and half-hearted, willing to tinker and play with social realities, but not to utterly destroy them.  He left decadence for anarchy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== The Decadent Movement beyond France ===
While the Decadent Movement, per se, was truly a French phenomenon, the impact was felt more broadly.  Typically, the influence was felt as an interest in pleasure, an interest in experimental sexuality, and a fascination with the bizarre, all packaged with a somewhat [[Transgressive fiction|trangressive]] spirit and an aesthetic that values material excess.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Picture of Dorian Gray: An Annotated, Uncensored Edition|last=Wilde|first=Oscar|publisher=Harvard University|year=2011|isbn=|editor-last=Frankel|editor-first=Nicholas|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many were also influenced by the Decadent Movement's aesthetic emphasis on art for its own sake.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robbins|first=Ruth|year=2015|others=Edited by Jane Ford, Kim Edwards Keates, Patricia Pulham|title=Always Leave Them Wanting More: Oscar Wilde's Salmoe and the Failed Cicrulations of Desire|url=|journal=Economies of Desire at the Victorian Fin de Siècle: Libidinal Lives|volume=|pages=21–34|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bohemia'''

Czech writers who were exposed to the work of the Decadent Movement saw in it the promise of a life they could never know.  They were neither aristocrats nor bored bourgeoisie.  They were poor and hungry for something better.  The dreams of the decadents gave them that something better, but something that was hopelessly unattainable.  It was that melancholy that drove their art.  These Bohemian decadent writers included [[Karel Hlaváček]], Arnošt Procházka, [[Jiří Karásek ze Lvovic]], and Louisa Zikova.  One Czech writer, [[Arthur Breisky]], embraced the full spirit of ''Le Décadent'' with its exultation in material excess and a life of refinement and pleasure.  From the Decadent Movement he learned the basic idea of a [[dandy]], and his work is almost entirely focused on developing a philosophy in which the Dandy is the consummate human, surrounded by riches and elegance, theoretically above society, just as doomed to death and despair as they.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pynsent|first=Robert|year=1973|title=A Czech Dandy: An Introduction to Arthur Breisky|url=|journal=The Slavonic and East European Review|volume=51|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Britain'''
[[File:Beardsley-peacockskirt.PNG|thumb|upright|Aubrey Beardsley, ''[[The Peacock Skirt]]'', illustration for [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]'', 1892]]

Though influenced through general exposure but also direct contact, the leading decadent figures in Britain associated with decadence were Irish writer [[Oscar Wilde]], poet [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], and illustrator [[Aubrey Beardsley]], as well as other artists and writers associated with ''[[The Yellow Book]]''. Others, such as [[Walter Pater]], resisted association with the movement, even though their works seemed to reflect similar ideals.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Decadent Republic of Letters: Taste, Politics, and Cosmopolitan Community from Baudelaire to Beardsley|last=Potolsky|first=Matthew|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|year=2012|isbn=0812244494|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While most of the influence was from figures such as Baudelaire and Verlaine, there was also very strong influence at times from more purely decadent members of the French movement, such as the influence that Huysmans and Rachilde had on Wilde, as seen explicitly in ''The Picture of Dorian Gray''.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2014/october/rachilde-wilde-discovery-10-21-2014.html|title=Rebellious French cross-dresser played an overlooked role in shaping Oscar Wilde's legacy, Stanford scholar says|last=Beacock|first=Ian|date=21 October 2014|website=Stanford News|others=Scholarship by Petra Dierkes-Thrun|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  British decadents embraced the idea of creating art for its own sake, pursuing all possible desires, and seeking material excess.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  At the same time, they were not shy about using the tools of decadence for social and political purpose. Beardsley had an explicit interest in the improvement of the social order and the role of art-as-experience in inspiring that transformation.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;  Oscar Wilde published an entire work exploring socialism as a liberating force: "Socialism would relieve us from that sordid necessity of living for others which, in the present condition of things, presses so hardly upon almost everybody."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Soul of Man Under Socialism|last=Wilde|first=Oscar|publisher=Arthur L. Humphreys|year=1909|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Gutenberg Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Swinburne wrote explicitly addressed Irish-English politics in poetry, as when he wrote, "Thieves and murderers, hands yet red with blood and tongues yet black with lies | Clap and clamour--'Parnell spurs his Gladstone well!'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swinburne|first=Algernon Charles|year=1886|title=The Commonweal: A Song for Unionists|url=|journal=A Channel Passage and Other Poems|volume=|pages=|via=Gutenberg Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In many of their personal lives, they also pursued decadent ideals.  Wilde had a secret homosexual life.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  Swinburne had an obsession with flagellation.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

'''Russia'''

[[File:Evfimia Nosova (Ryabushinskaya) by N.Feofilaktov (1913, priv.coll).jpg|thumb|Portrait of {{ill|Euphemia Pavlova Nosova|ru|Носова, Евфимия Павловна}} by {{ill|Nikolai Kalmakov|ru|Калмаков, Николай Константинович}}]]
The Decadent Movement reached into Russia primarily through exposure to the writings of Charles Baudelaire and Paul Verlaine.  The earliest Russian adherents lacked idealism and focused on such decadent themes as subversion of morality, disregard for personal health, and living in blasphemy and sensual pleasure.  Russian writers were especially drawn to the morbid aspects of decadence and in the fascination with death.  Dmitry Merezhkovsky is thought to be the first to clearly promote a Russian decadence that included the idealism that would eventually inspire the French symbolists to disassociate from the more purely materialistic Decadent Movement.  The first Russian writers to achieve success as followers of this Decadent Movement included Konstanin Balmont, [[Fyodor Sologub]], [[Valery Bryusov]], and [[Zinaida Gippius]].  As they refined their craft beyond imitation of Baudelaire and Verlaine, most of these authors became much more clearly aligned with symbolism than with decadence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bristol|first=Evelyn|year=1980|title=Idealism and Decadence in Russian Symbolist Poetry|url=|journal=Slavic Review|volume=39|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some visual artists adhered to the Baju-esque late Decadent Movement approach to sexuality as purely an act of pleasure, often ensconced in a context of material luxury.  They also shared the same emphasis on shocking society, purely for the scandal. Among them were [[Konstantin Somov]], {{ill|Nikolai Kalmakov|ru|Калмаков, Николай Константинович}}, and Nikolay Feofilaktov.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowlt|first=John E.|year=1982|title=Through the Glass Darkly: Images of Decadence in Early Twentieth-Century Russian Art|url=|journal=Journal of Contemporary History|volume=17|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spain'''

Some art historians consider [[Francisco de Goya]] one of the roots of the Decadent movement in Spain, almost 100 years before its start in France. Their works were a cry of denouncement against injustice and oppression. However, Ramón Casas and José María López Mezquita can be considered the model artists of this period. Their paintings are an image of the social conflicts and police repression that was happening in Spain at the time.
Spaniard writers also wanted to be part of this movement. [[Emilia Pardo Bazán]] with works like [[Los Pazos de Ulloa]] where terror and decadent topics appear. [[El monstruo]] (The Monster), written by [[Antonio de Hoyos y Vinent]] belongs to Decadent Movement. But the Decadent Movement is overlapped by the [[Fin de Siglo Movement]] with the authors of the [[Generación del 98]] being part-decadent: [[Ramón María del Valle-Inclán]], [[Unamuno]] and [[Pío Baroja]] are the most essential figures of this period&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to the Spanish Novel: From 1600 to the Present|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn= 9781139000222 |location=|pages= 138|quote=|via=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-companion-to-the-spanish-novel/decadence-and-innovation-in-fin-de-siglo-spain/DBB78766FF30C8855E20D9F9A59286B2}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

'''United States'''

Few prominent writers or artists in the [[United States]] were connected with the Decadent Movement.  Those who were connected struggled to find an audience, for Americans were reluctant to see value for them in what they considered the art forms of [[fin de siècle]] France.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Landscapes of Decadence: Literature and Place at the Fin de Siècle|last=Murray|first=Alex|publisher=Cambridge|year=2016|isbn=1107169666|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Poet [[Francis Saltus Saltus]] was inspired by Charles Baudelaire, and his unpracticed style was occasionally compared to the French poet's more refined experimentation.  He embraced the most debauched lifestyle of the French decadents and celebrated that life in his own poetry.  At the time, mostly before Baju's ''Le Décadent'', this frivolous poetry on themes of alcohol and depravity found little success and no known support from those who were part of the Decadent Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Man in the Mirror: William Marion Reedy and His Magazine|last=Putzel|first=Max|publisher=University of Missouri|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=43|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The younger brother of Francis, writer [[Edgar Saltus]] had more success.  He had some interaction with Oscar Wilde, and he valued decadence in his personal life.  For a time, his work exemplified both the ideals and style of the movement, but a significant portion of his career was in traditional journalism and fiction that praised virtue.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Decadent Culture in the United States: Art and Literature Against the American Grain, 1890 - 1926|last=Weir|first=David|publisher=State University of New York|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time when he was flourishing, however, multiple contemporary critics, as well as other decadent writers, explicitly considered him one of them.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  Writer James Huneker was exposed to the Decadent Movement in France and tried to bring it back with him to New York.  He has been lauded to his dedication to this cause throughout his career, but it has also been suggested that, while he lived as a decadent and heralded their work, his own work was more frustrated, hopeless, and empty of the pleasure that had attracted him to the movement in the first place.  Largely, he focused on cynically describing the impossibility of a true American decadence.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

== Critical studies ==
German doctor and social critic [[Max Nordau]] wrote a lengthy book entitled ''[[Degeneration (Max Nordau)|Degeneration]]'' (1892).  It was an examination of decadence as a trend, and specifically attacked several people associated with the Decadent Movement, as well as other figures throughout the world who deviated from cultural, moral, or political norms.  His language was colorful and vitriolic, often invoking the worship of Satan.  What made the book a success was its suggestion of a medical diagnosis of "degeneration," a neuro-pathology  that resulted in these behaviors.  It also helped that the book named such figures as Oscar Wilde, Algernon Charles Swinburne, Paul Verlaine, and Maurice Barrès, members of the Decadent Movement who were in the public eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=J. A.|first=|year=1895|title=Max Nordau's Degeneration|url=|journal=The Sewanee Review|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930 Italian art and literature critic [[Mario Praz]] completed a broad study of morbid and erotic literature, translated and published in English as ''The Romantic Agony'' (1933).  The study included decadent writing (such as Baudelaire and Swinburne), but also anything else that he considered dark, grim, or sexual in some way.  His study centered on the 18th and 19th Centuries.  The danger of such literature, he believed it unnaturally elevated the instinctive bond between pain and pleasure and that, no matter the artists' intention, the essential role of art is to educate and teach culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mumford Jones|first=Howard|year=1936|title=Reviewed Work: The Romantic Agony. by Mario Praz, Angus Davidson|url=|journal=Modern Language Notes|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deference''' (also called '''submission''' or '''passivity''') is the condition of submitting to the espoused, [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] influence of one's superior or superiors.&lt;ref&gt;John B. Kirbya, "Early American Politics—The Search for Ideology: An Historiographical Analysis and Critique of the Concept of 'Deference,'" ''The Journal of Politics'', Volume 32, Issue 04, November 1970 pp 808–838&lt;/ref&gt; Deference implies a yielding or submitting to the judgment of a recognized superior, out of respect or reverence. Deference has been studied extensively by [[political scientists]], sociologists, and psychologists.

==Politics==
Smolenski (2005) examines deference in colonial Pennsylvania, to see how claims to political authority were made, justified, and accepted or rejected. He focuses on the "colonial speech economy," that is, the implicit rules that determined who was allowed to address whom and under what conditions, and describes how the qualities that inspired deference changed in the province from 1691 to 1764. The Quaker elite initially established a monopoly on political leadership based on what they believed to be their inherent civic virtue grounded in their religious and social class. By 1760, this view had been discredited and replaced with the consensus that civic virtue was an achieved, not an inherent, attribute and that it should be determined by the display of appropriate manliness and the valor of men who were willing to take up arms for the common defense of the colony. Further, Pennsylvanians came to believe that all white men, not just wealthy property owners, were equally capable of achieving political voice. Martial masculinity, therefore, became the defining characteristic of the ideal citizen and marked a significant transformation in the way individuals justified their right to represent the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;John Smolenski, "From Men of Property to Just Men," ''Early American Studies, An Interdisciplinary Journal,'' Fall 2005, Vol. 3 Issue 2, pp 253–285&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology==
[[Erving Goffman]], a Canadian-born [[sociology|sociologist]] and writer, explored the relationship between deference and demeanor in his 1967 essay "The Nature of Deference and Demeanor".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Erving Goffman|year=1967|title=Interaction Ritual|location=New York, NY|publisher=Anchor House|isbn=0-394-70631-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Goffman, a person with a poor demeanor will be held in lower esteem in the eyes of society. The same is true for people who behave in a good demeanor, however: society will hold them in a higher esteem. An example of this situation can be seen through the way a person acts in a social setting. e.g. a man pulling out a chair for a woman at a restaurant. On the other end of the spectrum, a person not bathing before they go to a fancy dinner party. These examples can be defined as presentational deference. Demeanor does not only limit itself to the actions of an individual, but also the appearance of an individual. A person offers themselves to a social group through a good appearance or a well demeanored appearance. When an individual has a well demeanored appearance it makes interaction between people easier. After a person is socially accepted to a group, it is expected that they will conform to interactional norms. Through acting on those norms, people receive deference.

==Psychology==
There is ongoing debate among psychologists as to the extent to which deference in a relationship is determined by a person's innate [[personality type]] or is the result of a person's experiences and [[classical conditioning|conditioning]]. In [[interpersonal relationships]], a partner can assume a submissive role to fit in or to make him or herself acceptable to the other partner,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=James J. Gross|title=Handbook of Emotion Regulation|publisher=Guilford Publications|year=2006|isbn=978-1-59385-148-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be a benign aspect of a relationship. On the other hand, it may be an indication of an interpersonal problem, such as [[Domestic violence|partner abuse]]. If one or both of the people are experiencing chronic, pervasive emotional distress then the sex partners or individuals may require psychological evaluation.

In interpersonal relationships, some people prefer or are willing to adopt a submissive role in [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]] or personal matters. The level and type of submission can vary from person to person, and from one context to another; and also is dependent on the other partner being willing to assume control in those situations. Some people can include occasional acts of submission in an otherwise [[conventional sex]] life, or adopt a submissive lifestyle.

{{Refimprove|date=March 2009}}
'''Dinefwr Castle''' (sometimes anglicised as '''Dynevor''') is a Welsh [[castle]] overlooking the [[River Tywi]] near the town of [[Llandeilo]], [[Carmarthenshire]], [[Wales]]. It lies on a ridge on the northern bank of the Tywi, with a steep drop of one hundred feet to the river. Dinefwr was the chief seat of the Kingdom of [[Deheubarth]]. The castle is a Grade I listed building. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| url = http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-11117-old-dynevor-castle-dynevor-park-llandeilo|title= Old Dynevor Castle,dynevor Park, Llandeilo|publisher= British Listed Buildings|accessdate = 25 August 2014}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The present [[castle]] is entered via a massive door protected by a restored length of [[battlement]]. The short path from the car park reveals impressive views of the [[Towy]] valley. The door admits the visitor to the main space enclosed by the walls, from which there are several stairs to the main battlements and towers. A narrow [[Spiral stairs|spiral staircase]] leads to a high tower, which gives extensive views of the deer park to the north and the Tywi valley to the south and west. The castle [[keep]] is entered via the [[basement|cellar]] at its base, but access to the circular walkway at the top can only be made via the battlement walk. Details such as the well and several [[garderobe]]s are visible in the structure. There is a path around the base of the main structure to the north.

==History==
Tradition relates that a castle was first constructed on this site by [[Rhodri the Great]], but there are no remains from this period. Dinefwr later became the chief seat of Rhodri's grandson [[Hywel Dda]], first ruler of Deheubarth and later [[king of the Britons|king of most of Wales]]. [[Rhys ap Gruffydd]], ruler of Deheubarth from 1155 to 1197, is thought to have rebuilt the castle. [[Giraldus Cambrensis]] tells a story about a plan by King [[Henry II of England]] to assault the castle during a campaign against Rhys. One of Henry's most trusted followers was sent on reconnaissance, guided by a local Welsh cleric, who was asked to lead him to the castle by the easiest route, but instead took the most difficult route he could find, ending the performance by stopping to eat grass with the explanation that this was the diet of the local people in times of hardship. The planned attack was duly abandoned.

Rhys ap Gruffydd also built the spectacular castle at [[Carreg Cennen]], about four miles away to the south. It is not visible from Dynefwr, but [[Dryslwyn Castle]] can just be seen on a hill blocking the [[Tywi]] valley to the south-west. Rhys also founded two religious houses during this period. [[Talley Abbey]] was the first [[Premonstratensian]] abbey in Wales, while [[Llanllyr]] was a [[Cistercian]] nunnery, only the second nunnery to be founded in Wales and the first to prosper.

On Rhys ap Gruffydd's death the castle passed to his son [[Rhys Gryg]], and the earliest parts of the present castle are thought to derive from this period. [[Llywelyn the Great]] of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]] was now extending his influence to this area, and Rhys, finding himself unable to resist, dismantled the castle. Llywelyn however had it restored and held it until his death in 1240. In 1255 [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd|Llywelyn the Last]] gave Dinefwr to [[Rhys Fychan]], then later gave it to Maredudd ap Rhys before later returning it to Rhys Fychan.  Maredydd now allied himself to King [[Edward I of England]], and helped Edward capture Dinefwr in 1277.  Maredudd had apparently been promised Dinefwr in return for his help, but Edward did not keep his promise and had Maredudd executed in 1291.
[[Image:View from Dinefwr Castle.jpg|thumb|View from Dinefwr Castle]]
The castle now came into English hands, though it is recorded to have been burnt during the rebellion of [[Llywelyn Bren]] in 1316. In 1317 it was given to [[Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester|Hugh Despenser]], the king's [[favourite]]. It was unsuccessfully besieged by the forces of [[Owain Glyndŵr]] in 1403. Towards the end of the 15th century the castle was held by Sir [[Rhys ap Thomas]], who carried out extensive rebuilding. In 1531 his grandson [[Rhys ap Gruffydd (rebel)| Rhys ap Gruffydd]] was executed for treason and the castle was confiscated by the crown, though the family were later able to recover it. In 1660 [[Newton House, Llandeilo|Newton House]] was built nearby and the castle keep modified as a summer house. The remains of the large windows can be seen at the top of the keep, but it burned down in the 18th century.
The castle is now owned by the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales and managed by CADW on their behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.welshwildlife.org/2011/castle-woods-llandeilo/ |title=(Dinefwr / Dynefor) Castle Woods – Llandeilo &amp;#124; &amp;#124; The Wildlife Trust of South and West WalesThe Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales |publisher=Welshwildlife.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public access==
The castle is now owned by the [[Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.welshwildlife.org welswildlife.org]&lt;/ref&gt; (who do not charge for entry) and is managed by [[Cadw]] but lies within [[Dinefwr Park]], which is owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]. Visitors who wish to see the castle and are driving there, may park in the town and walk up to the Castle using the free Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales access route. If visitors walk or park in the National Trust site and are not National Trust, Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales or Cadw members there is a site entrance charge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/dinefwr/prices/]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a small free car park near the castle for disabled badge holders, but it can only be reached by a rough track through a field. Permission can be gained at the National Trust office to drive over the field up to the castle, weather and conditions permitting.

'''E. Gene Smith''' (August 10, 1936&amp;nbsp;– December 16, 2010) was a scholar of [[Tibetology]], specifically [[Tibetan literature]] and [[Tibetan history|history]].

==Life and career==
Ellis Gene Smith was born in [[Ogden, Utah]] to a traditional [[Mormon]] family.&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt; He studied at a variety of institutions of higher education in the U.S.: [[Adelphi College]], [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges|Hobart College]], [[University of Utah]], and the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]].&lt;ref name="SmithSchaeffer2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=E. Gene Smith|author2=Kurtis R Schaeffer|title=Among Tibetan Texts: History and Literature of the Himalayan Plateau|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_XzJlTrj6RMC&amp;pg=PA1|date=15 June 2001|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-86171-179-6|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Seattle, he was able to study with [[Dezhung Rinpoche]] and members of the [[Sakya Phuntso Phodrang]] family who had been brought to Seattle under the auspices of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] grant to the [[Far Eastern and Russian Institute]]. He studied [[Tibetan culture]] and [[Buddhism]] with Dezhung Rinpoche from 1960 to 1964 and spent the summer of 1962 traveling to the other Rockefeller centers in Europe to meet with other Tibetan savants.

In 1964 he completed his Ph.D. qualifying exams and traveled to [[Leiden]] for advanced studies in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]].&lt;ref name="tele"/&gt; In 1965 he went to India under a [[Foreign Area Fellowship Program]] ([[Ford Foundation]]) grant to study with living exponents of all of the [[Tibetan Buddhist]] and [[Bönpo]] traditions.&lt;ref name="SmithSchaeffer2001" /&gt;

He began his studies with [[Geshe Lobsang Lungtok]] (Ganden Changtse), [[Drukpa Thoosay Rinpoche]] and [[Khenpo Noryang]], and [[Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche]]. He decided to remain in India to continue serious studies of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and culture. He traveled extensively in the borderlands of India and Nepal. In 1968 he joined the [[Library of Congress]] New Delhi Field Office.&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt; He then began a project which was to last over the next two and a half decades, the reprinting of the Tibetan books which had been brought by the exile community or were with members of the [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan-speaking]] communities in Sikkim, Bhutan, India, and Nepal.

He became field director of the Library of Congress Field Office in India in 1980&lt;ref name="tele"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Gene Smith - Telegraph| work = [[Telegraph (newspaper)|Telegraph]]| date = 7 January 2011| accessdate = 2015-01-14| url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/books-obituaries/8246945/Gene-Smith.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and served there until 1985 when he was transferred to Indonesia. He stayed in Jakarta running the Southeast Asian programs until 1994 when he was assigned to the Library of Congress Middle Eastern Office in Cairo.&lt;ref name="tele"/&gt;

In 1997 he retired from the Library of Congress.&lt;ref name="SmithSchaeffer2001" /&gt; He briefly worked as a consultant for [[Trace Foundation]] for the establishment of the Himalayan and Inner Asian Resources in New York, an organisation dedicated to the preservation and dissemination of Tibetan literature.&lt;ref name="LRobit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Memorial for E. Gene Smith this weekend in New York|url=http://www.lionsroar.com/memorial-for-e-gene-smith-this-weekend-in-new-york/|accessdate=February 17, 2016|work=[[Lion's Roar (magazine)|Lion's Roar]]|date=February 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Smith founded the [[Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center]] (TBRC), together with [[Leonard van der Kuijp]] of [[Harvard University]] and friends to digitize the 12,000 volume corpus of Tibetan literature.&lt;ref name="NYTtexts"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jacobs|first1=Andrew|title=After Winding Odyssey, Tibetan Texts Find Home in China|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/world/asia/after-winding-odyssey-tibetan-texts-find-home-in-china.html?_r=0|accessdate=February 17, 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This digital library is the largest collection of Tibetan literature outside of Tibet.&lt;ref name = "economist"&gt;{{cite news |title=Gene Smith |url=http://www.economist.com/node/17899572 |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |date=13 January 2011 |accessdate=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; TBRC continues to acquire, preserve, organize and make available Tibetan texts.

In 2001, [[Wisdom Publications]] published ''Among Tibetan Texts'',&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{Cite web| title = E. Gene Smith, Guardian of the Tibetan Canon, Dies at 74| author = Margalit Fox| work = [[The New York Times]]| date = 2010-12-28 | accessdate = 2015-01-14| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/29/world/asia/29smith.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Gene_Smith&amp;st=cse}}&lt;/ref&gt; a collection of essays that Smith wrote back in his Delhi times, as introductions to Library of Congress reprints of Tibetan texts. As introductions to Tibetan literature, culture and history, these had circulated since the early 1980s amongst students and researchers, and had acquired a sort of cult status. A chapter is also devoted to Smith in David Jackson's biography of Dezhung Rinpoche, "[[A Saint in Seattle.]]"&lt;ref&gt;David Jackson, A Saint in Seattle: The Life of the TIbetan Mystic Dezhing Rinpoche, Wisdom PUblications, Boston, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the subject of the award-winning documentary ''[[Digital Dharma]]''.&lt;ref name="DocMag"&gt;{{cite news|title=Meet the DocuWeeks Filmmakers: Dafna Yachin--'Digital Dharma: One Man's Mission to Save a Culture'|url=http://www.documentary.org/magazine/meet-docuweeks-filmmakers-dafna-yachin-digital-dharma-one-mans-mission-save-culture|accessdate=February 16, 2016|work=Documentary Magazine|issue=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the film "an affectionate tribute to the late E.

'''Ganweriwala''' ({{lang-ur| {{nastaliq| گنویريوالا}}}} {{lang-pa|{{nastaliq|گنیریوالا}}}}) is an [[Indus Valley Civilization]] site in [[Punjab, Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="Pruthi2004"&gt;{{cite book | author=Raj Kumar Pruthi | title=Prehistory and Harappan Civilization | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uRMGDmdE9FkC&amp;pg=PA123 | accessdate=8 April 2012 | date=1 January 2004 | publisher=APH Publishing | isbn=978-81-7648-581-4 | pages=123–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==

Ganweriwala is situated near the Indian border on the dry river bed of the [[Ghaggar-Hakra River|Ghaggar-Hakra]] , now a part of vast desert. It is spread over 80 hectares and comparable in size with the largest sites of the Indus Valley Civilization, such as [[Mohenjo-daro]]. But it is not excavated and only identified and it may turn up as top five largest towns of [[Indus Valley Civilisation]].&lt;ref name=harappa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harappa.com/har/ancient-indus-sites.html |title=Ancient Indus Sites |work=The Indus Civilization |accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significant finds==
Although excavation is yet to begin in this site, a stray find of a terrecotta tablet is a significant find. In this seal, a cross legged person (suggested as yogic posture) and a kneeling person below a tree and upon a tree are depicted.&lt;ref name="safarmer.com"&gt;[http://www.safarmer.com/Indo-Eurasian/worshippers&amp;gods1.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt; Such kneeling persons on tree, particularly in front of a tiger like animal, are shown in tablets or seals found at Harappa (H 163 a), Mohenjadaro (M 309 a) and Kalibangan (K 49a).&lt;ref name="safarmer.com"/&gt;
More recently Sidra Gulzar and [[Asko Parpola]] discovered an inscribed tablet from Ganweriwala that may ultimately help to solve the riddle of the Indus Valley script. Despite its degraded condition, one can see the horn of the missing “unicorn bull" to the bottom right, plus seven signs of the Indus script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sidra Gulzar|author2=[[Asko Parpola]]|title=CWA 77|journal=World Archaeology|date=19 May 2016|page=7|url=http://www.world-archaeology.com/issues/cwa-77-out-now.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Indus Civilization inscription found         - Research portal Tuhat - University of Helsinki|url=https://tuhat.helsinki.fi/portal/en/publications/new-indus-civilizat(8a6adb8e-175d-4d68-98a2-8c1e178b485b).html|website=tuhat.helsinki.fi|accessdate=16 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==
It is equidistant from [[Mohenjo-daro]] and [[Harappa]], situated in between these two ancient cities. In this aspect, the excavation may provide more information about this ancient civilisation.&lt;ref name=harappa /&gt;

== History ==
Atsina is the name applied by specialists in Algonquian linguistics. [[Arapaho language|Arapaho]] and Atsina are dialects of a common language usually designated by scholars as "Arapaho-Atsina". Historically, this language had five dialects, and on occasion specialists add a third dialect name to the label, resulting in the designation, "Arapaho-Atsina-Nawathinehena".&lt;ref name = "mithun336"/&gt; Compared with Arapaho proper, Gros Ventre had three additional phonemes {{IPA|/tʲ/}}, {{IPA|/ts/}}, {{IPA|/kʲ/}}, and {{IPA|/bʲ/}}, and lacked the velar fricative {{IPA|/x/}}.

[[Theresa Lamebull]] taught the language at [[Fort Belknap College]], and helped develop a dictionary using the [[Phraselator]] when she was 109.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, the White Clay Immersion School at [[Fort Belknap College]] was teaching the language to 26 students, up from 11 students in 2006.&lt;ref name = "ictmn" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "boswell"&gt;{{Cite news

'''Halet Çambel''' (27 August 1916 &amp;ndash; 12 January 2014) was a Turkish [[archaeology|archaeologist]] and Olympic [[fencing|fencer]]. She was the first Muslim woman to compete in the [[Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name="obit - Telegraph"/&gt;

==Private life==
Çambel was born in [[Berlin]], [[German Empire]] on 27 August 1916, to Turkish [[military attaché]] Hasan Cemil Bey (Çambel), a close associate of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], founder of the Turkish Republic, and Remziye Hanım, the daughter of [[Ibrahim Hakki Pasha]], a former [[Grand Vizier]] (prime minister of the Ottoman sultan) and the Ottoman [[ambassador]] to the German Empire at the time.&lt;ref name="c1"/&gt;

She completed her secondary education at [[Robert College|Arnavutköy American High School for Girls]] (today Robert College). During the high school years, she was inspired by her [[history of art]] teacher, who organized visits to historic sites of Istanbul. It was at this time that she began to perform [[fencing]]. Between 1933-1939, she was educated in [[archaeology]] at [[Sorbonne University]] in [[Paris]], France. Çambel became a scientific assistant at [[Istanbul University]] in 1940. In 1944, she received a doctorate. From 1947 on, Çambel served as lecturer.&lt;ref name="nature-cite"/&gt; She was a [[visiting scholar]] for two years at [[Saarland University|University of Saarbrücken]] in Germany.&lt;ref name="c1"/&gt;  In 1960, she was appointed professor, and founded the Institute of Prehistory. She became [[emeritus]] in 1984.&lt;ref name="ad"/&gt; 

On returning to [[Istanbul]] after the 1936 Summer Olympics, where she represented her country, she started a relation with [[Nail Çakırhan]], a communist poet and journalist, who became a celebrated architect.&lt;ref name="c1"/&gt; They were married for seventy years until the death of Nail Çakırhan in October 2008.

Çambel died at age 97 in Istanbul on 12 January 2014.&lt;ref name="CNN Turk article"/&gt; Following a memorial ceremony held at Istanbul University's Faculty of Letters, she was taken to [[Akyaka, Muğla]], where she was interred beside her spouse's grave.&lt;ref name="c1"/&gt;

==Sports==
She competed in the women's individual [[foil (fencing)|foil]] event at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name="sports-reference"/&gt; Çambel was the first Muslim woman to compete in the Olympics.&lt;ref name="ds1"/&gt; Although invited by a "female German official" to meet [[Adolf Hitler]], Çambel refused it on political grounds.&lt;ref name="bbc1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="c1"/&gt;

==Professional career==
After [[World War II]], Çambel began studying with German archaeologist [[Helmuth Theodor Bossert]] (1889–1961), who was professor for archaeology at Istanbul University. In 1947, Bossert and she began excavating [[Karatepe]], the walled city of 12th century BC late [[Hittites|Hiitite]] king [[Azatiwada]], located at the [[Taurus Mountains]] in southern Turkey.&lt;ref name="c1"/&gt; She played a key role in the decryption of [[Anatolian hieroglyphs|Hittite hieroglyphics]] with the help of the [[Phoenician alphabet]] after their discovery of [[Karatepe Bilingual]] there.&lt;ref name="nature-cite"/&gt;

Çambel was also active in promoting the preservation of Turkey's cultural heritage. In the 1950s, she resisted the government's attempt to move the artifacts from [[Karatepe]] to a museum. The government eventually agreed, and in 1960 established an outdoor museum, the [[Karatepe-Aslantaş Open-Air Museum]], where her husband Nail Çakırhan designed some buildings. She also fought efforts to dam the [[Ceyhan River]], which would have flooded many archaeological sites. She was able to have the proposed water level reduced sufficiently to save the sites.&lt;ref name="nature-cite"/&gt;

In 2004, Çambel received the [[Prince Claus Awards|Prince Claus Award]] in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="c1"/&gt; The jury report cited her "for conducting rescue excavations of endangered heritage sites, introducing stone restoration and ensuring proper conservation of significant cultural heritage in Turkey," for founding a chair of [[Prehistoric archaeology]] at Istanbul University, and "for her dedicated scholarship and for her unique role in expanding the possibilities for interaction between people and their cultural heritage."&lt;ref name="Claus cite"/&gt;

'''Hillyard, Washington''' is a neighborhood in [[Spokane, Washington]] which existed as a separate town between 1892 and 1924. 

The town came about due to the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] and was named for [[James J. Hill]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meany|first=Edmond S.|title=Origin of Washington geographic names|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015027074981;view=1up;seq=130|year=1923|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; then-head of the railroad.  Between 1904 and 1912, many of the town's houses were built, to house railroad workers working in the local [[classification yard|yard]].  Hillyard was the home of the Great Northern's famed shops where [[locomotive]]s were manufactured, repaired, and refurbished.  At the time, the Hillyard shop was the largest in the nation.

In 1924, Hillyard was officially annexed by neighboring [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]].

Due to its historical roots as a town housing railroad workers, Hillyard acquired a rather rough reputation, which lasts into recent decades.  (As recently as 1979, Daniel Leen described the Hillyard train yards in his book ''The Freighthoppers Manual for North America'' as having "the feel of warmed-over death.")  After the Great Northern underwent a series of mergers, becoming the [[Burlington Northern Railroad]] and eventually the [[BNSF Railway]], the Hillyard yard and shops were closed in the early 1980s with BN's main yard operations in Spokane moving to Yardley.  Only the decaying structures of the old shops remain today. Hillyard suffers some of the worst poverty in Spokane, per capita it is the poorest neighborhood in the state of Washington.

Hillyard continues as a neighborhood of Spokane in which residents take pride. A Hillyard Festival is held every year in August, and the preservation of historic buildings is a local concern. Murals and a small railroad museum celebrate the town's history. Many of the neighborhood's residents are descended from the railroad workers who started the town, but Hillyard is recently becoming a popular home for immigrants of [[Russians|Russian]], [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]], [[Micronesia]]n, and [[Southeast Asia]]n descent. The downtown Hillyard business district, located on Market Street, has become Spokane's first neighborhood to be listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. According to Teresa Brum, Spokane's Historic Preservation Officer in charge of the project to have Hillyard listed on the National Register: "This is the most architecturally intact neighborhood left in Spokane. Most of it looks as it did 90 years ago." Hillyard neighborhood is still there and is still home to the lower class of Spokane.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spokesmanreview.com/news-story.asp?date=092001&amp;ID=s1026394&amp;cat=section.regional&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historic-hillyard.com/history.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[North Spokane Corridor]] has forced a large number of relocations in the neighborhood.&lt;ref name=Hansen&gt;{{cite news |title=North-south freeway to exact quite a toll |author=Dan Hansen |date=June 1, 1997 |work=[[Spokesman Review]] |url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/1997/jun/01/north-south-freeway-exact-quite-toll/ |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is predicted that the freeway's presence will help revitalize areas of the neighborhood that remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The North Spokane Corridor: Moving Ahead |work=Greater Spokane Chamber of Commerce |url=http://www.greaterspokane.org/blog/2011/01/the-north-spokane-corridor-moving-ahead/ |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Holy Week in Popayán''', Cauca (Colombia), is the celebration of the Passion and death of [[Jesus Christ]] through daily processions continuously performed since the sixteenth century between Good Friday nights and Holy Saturday. This parade takes place in the ancient streets of the "White City". Religious images of Spanish, [[Andalusia]]n, [[Quito]], Italian and [[Payanes]] arranged on a wooden platform with 4 front and 4 back "barrotes" (bars) are carried in the shoulders of the "Cargueros". These images are representations of different episodes recounted in the Gospels on the Passion, Crucifixion and Death of Jesus Christ. Each performance is a "paso" (step). The steps are taken through the streets, a distance of a cross-shaped layout since the time of the Conquest, passing by the main churches and temples of the city.

On September 30, 2009 it was declared a [[Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] by the [[UNESCO]] committee.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00011&amp;RL=00259|editorial=UNESCO Culture Sector&lt;/ref&gt;

The processions were acquired great importance and size over the years since it was increasing the number of images and ornaments that were enriched, this was thanks to economic and social development through the city during the Spanish period because Popayan became the political and economic center of the colony settled here since colonial institutions as the Royal Mint of Spain. Mining development in the Governorate of Popayán that processions will help great contribution in gold jewelry, silver and emeralds that embellished the images with crowns and jewels, the seats and litter. Mining was powered by Indian slave labor. Slaves had a life expectancy of three years. It was said one could never lose one´s way to the mines of Popayán because the roads were lined with bones of dead Indians. Hanke, Louis. Las Casas and the Spanish Struggle for Justice in the New World. Most of the development of the procession was in the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth Española.La colonial period most of the images are of Spanish origin and Quito as they were the most prominent art schools of the time, the gold in is mostly payanesa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museonacional.gov.co/sites/popayan/popayan2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2003-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120630110636/http://www.museonacional.gov.co/sites/popayan/popayan2.html |archivedate=2012-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time it was thought that the processions definitely would end, as was the case since this event the procession of [[Easter Monday]] ends, but by the intervention of small groups of religious people the processions managed to resurface.&lt;ref&gt;Jaime Fletcher Feijoo, Holy Week processions in Popayán. Something for cargueros. 1950&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century during [[independence from Colombia]] development decreases in processions due to war because most of the money was used for the liberation cause.

=== 20th century ===

For the 20th century the same thing happened for the economic crisis that Colombia lived. In 1937 the Master [[Guillermo Valencia]], decided to form a Civic Council to take care to preserve that tradition and 1939 said board received official recognition by the ordinance No. 14 issued by the [[Departmental Assembly (Colombia)|Assembly of Cauca]]. The new body was given the name of '' '[[Board Permanent Pro Easter Popayán]]' ''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Creation of the Permanent Board Pro Week Santa|url=http://juntaprosemanasantapopayan.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=20&amp;Itemid=57|editor=Junta Permanent Pro Easter | accessdate = 21 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the nights of Easter, referring to sahumadoras from one of the balconies of the city the Chilean poet [[Julio Barrenechea]] told Jorge Enrique Velasco:&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Enrique Velasco - Lotus - the eternal religious in Popayán - 1955&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote | Look, there comes a poem of mine: ' "she takes up the tray with the fire between camellias and the fire glows and eyes, face Black And going walked still perfuming the sidewalks while.. the town looks after crying candles " ''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Barrenechea | first = July | title = one hundred poems, one voz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jx1XPC7x6u8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=es&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=8 April 2012 | language = Spanish | year = 2010 | publisher = RIL Publishers | isbn = 978-956-284-764-3 | chapter = Black of Sahumerio | pages = 89, 90, 91}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Some rains forced to suspend the processions. On Holy Thursday, March 31, 1938, when it was not possible to draw the procession the next day marched three extra steps after having had to intervene Guillermo Valencia to achieve because freighters desire to not endured load that year.

In the Easter of 1964 it rained for three days from Tuesday to Thursday and no procession managed to completely finish its route, cargo ships managed by the Board and the [[Archdiocese of Popayán]] in compensation authorize take 22 steps the Friday instead of 12 who were scheduled, so it was necessary to use 176 freighters.

Some steps have fallen by breaking any of the bars as in the case of "judgment" of [[Maundy Thursday]] in 1940 in the street trade and "logos" against the Popayán Teatro Friday of 1949, to break the bar of the front right corner.

On 22 March 1951 Mr. Don Arcesius Velasco Iragorri "The Cripple" died in front of the [[Church of San José (Popayán)|Church of San José]] the Holy Wednesday loading the passage of "The Taking "on the right front. This is one of the heaviest steps for its size and proportions of images. Since 1952 the passage of "The Arrest" to reach the Church of San Jose, pays homage to its freighter deceased is called "The Touch" where family members give continuity to the legacy of "Lad", and friends say the step on his shoulders for a minute, commemorating the fact fateful March 22.

=== 21st century ===

In recent years the processions have been enriched with new steps, such as Jesus' encounter with the women on the street of bitterness, Mr. expiration, The Descent, The transfer of Christ to the tomb, our lady virgin Easter, our lord Jesus Christ resurrected, among other images made by Spanish and Ecuadorian imaginary.

From 21 February to 3 April 2003 the [[National Museum of Colombia]] presented in its temporary exhibition hall and alternates hall, an exhibition called "Holy Week in Popayán. The procession goes inside" made up of steps, gold and silver ornaments, pictures, litter and textiles, becoming the first out processions outside Popayan&lt;ref name="National Museum of Colombia"/&gt;

'''Ion Cojar''' (January 9, 1931 - October 18, 2009) was a [[Romania]]n [[acting]] teacher, researcher and [[theatre director]]. He is the founder of a unique method that revolutionised the Romanian school of acting.&lt;ref&gt;according to Victor Rebengiuc, Mircea Albulescu, Dan Puric, Gelu Colceag, Florin Zamfirescu and Adrian Titieni: http://www.mediafax.ro/cultura-media/doliu-in-lumea-teatrului-5008432/, http://www.mediafax.ro/printare/5008432/, http://m.stirileprotv.ro/index.php?article_id=3207787, http://www.cronicavip.ro/cronicavip/article.php?article_id=63920, http://www.realitatea.net/a-murit-actorul-si-regizorul-ion-cojar_643566.html, http://yorick.ro/adrian-titieni-nu-avem-o-radiografie-a-valorilor-corecta/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ion Cojar on IMDB: https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1486212/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adriantofei.wordpress.com"&gt;http://adriantofei.wordpress.com/ion-cojar-en/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ion Cojar as acting teacher==

Ion Cojar changed the old way of understanding acting in Romania, when the actor was taught how to play [[theatre]], to act, to fake, imitate or mimic life, emotions or characters, with a new one that demands actors, directors and teachers to create the circumstances in which the truth of life can occur, and the actor/actress to go onstage or during filming through authentic psychologically-realistic processes that cannot be anticipated or consciously controlled, at the end of which he/she would be actually changed as a person, so that the audiences may be able to follow the lifelike processes, to understand and believe what they see and hear, to empathize with the actors.&lt;ref name="adriantofei.wordpress.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revistateatrul.cimec.ro"&gt;http://revistateatrul.cimec.ro/listaAutor.asp?IndexS=C&amp;NumeS=Cojar0Ion&lt;/ref&gt;

Ion Cojar argued that in order to have an authentic performance, the actor’s psycho-emotional processes, along with his speech, body movements and physiological changes, which are the results of those processes, must not be anticipated, because this way they would be anchored in preconceived ideas and would not be new and authentic, and also must not be consciously controlled, because we cannot observe our own processes as they are taking place without interrupting them.&lt;ref name="adriantofei.wordpress.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revistateatrul.cimec.ro"/&gt;

In everyday life we never know what is going to happen or how we are going to behave or what we are going to say when we interact with someone. We just try to change something in that person in order to achieve our goal. In the same way, the actor, in a certain life situation and with a certain psychology that were previously assumed, aims to actually change something in his partner in order to achieve his goal (his character’s goal that he previously assumed), without anticipating any obstacles, by venturing into the unknown and allowing himself the freedom to make mistakes. This way, everything that will happen to him in the process, from emotions to body movements to speech, will come organically, without being consciously controlled or anticipated, and this way they will be authentic, just like in everyday life, and thus the audiences will understand and believe what they’ll see and hear and will empathize with the actor.&lt;ref name="adriantofei.wordpress.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revistateatrul.cimec.ro"/&gt;

Ion Cojar also argued that we can know for sure that the actor is not faking or acting, but is going through an authentic process when we see instant, organic changes in the color and texture of his face, like when blood instantly floods its vessels in important moments, because these changes are impossible to fake.&lt;ref name="adriantofei.wordpress.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revistateatrul.cimec.ro"/&gt;

As a professor and researcher at ''The National University of Theatre and Film from [[Bucharest]]'', guided by the principle "''process, not success''", Ion Cojar worked with his students in order for them to develop a specific psycho-emotional mechanism that, along with the use of a specific acting method, would allow them to easily transform conventions in life truth (conventions like fictional and imaginary life situations, given plot and lines, a character’s personality and goal etc.), unlike the old acting school when students were taught how to play theatre.&lt;ref name="adriantofei.wordpress.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revistateatrul.cimec.ro"/&gt; Ion Cojar always said that "''the art of the actor has nothing in common with theatre''",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.evenimentul.ro/articol/arta-actorului-daca-nu.html&lt;/ref&gt; a statement that became his trademark.

The professional actors who were trained via Cojar's pedagogical method tend to use in their creative processes an acting method derived from the previous one. One of his former students, [[Luminita Gheorghiu]], won the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]] Award for Best Supporting Actress with her performance in [[The Death of Mr. Lazarescu]] (2005).&lt;ref&gt;Luminita Gheorghiu on IMDb: https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0315640/&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Mircea Gheorghiu, another former student of Ion Cojar, is considered to be the main continuator of his teaching method in the art of the actor.&lt;ref name="adriantofei.wordpress.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Gheorghiu on IMDb: https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3993998/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://academytv.ro/team-view/michael-freeman/&lt;/ref&gt; Adrian Țofei, a former student of Mircea Gheorgiu, won the Special Jury Prize for Best Actor at the 2016 [[Nashville Film Festival]] for his performance in [[Be My Cat: A Film for Anne]].&lt;ref name="https://nashvillefilmfestival.org/news/2016-feature-award-winners/"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nashvillefilmfestival.org/news/2016-feature-award-winners/ |title=2016 Feature Award Winners - Nashville Film Festival|publisher=Nashvillefilmfestival.org |date=2016-04-22 |accessdate=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel with the development of his method, Ion Cojar supported an educational system in which the students are not taught or modeled by the teachers, but in which the environment is that of laboratory experimentation and self-knowledge, of despecialization and deliverance from preconceptions acquired in family, school and society, an environment in which the student is able to become aware of and to use his/her full native [[creativity|creative]] potential that makes him/her  unique.&lt;ref name="adriantofei.wordpress.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revistateatrul.cimec.ro"/&gt;

In theory, Ion Cojar gathered all his research and discoveries in his book entitled "''O poetică a artei actorului''" ("''Poetics of the actor's art''").

==Ion Cojar as theatre director==

As a theatre director, Ion Cojar also argued that the audiences, in order to empathize in a total way with what they’re seeing and hearing, must not have any clue or the impression that they're witnessing a theatre show, but a genuine life event. He aimed to make theatre shows that paradoxically don’t look like shows at all, where the audiences would find no elements whatsoever to indicate that they are witnessing a theatre show and not an actual life event.&lt;ref name="adriantofei.wordpress.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revistateatrul.cimec.ro"/&gt;

[[File:Kagal book.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|right|''The Book of the Kahal'' (1869) by Jacob Brafman, in the Russian language original.]]
'''Iakov Aleksandrovich Brafman''' (1825—28 December 1879), commonly known as '''Jacob Brafman''', was a [[Russian Jew]] from near [[Minsk]], who became notable for converting first to [[Lutheranism]] and then the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. He was a leading polemicist against the [[qahal|kahal]] (the communal Jewish theocratic government in Russia) and the [[Talmud]]. Brafman's works ''The Local and Universal Jewish Brotherhoods'' (1868) and ''The Book of the Kahal'' (1869) were foundational texts in establishing a theoretical basis to modern [[anti-Jewish]] thought in Russia and established a framework for themes later covered in ''[[The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion]]''.
==Background==
Brafman was born in 1825 and lived in [[Kletsk]], a ''[[shtetl]]'' near [[Minsk]] in the [[Pale of Settlement]]. His father was a [[rabbi]]. The Jews had lived in the town since the 16th century, when it was part of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], but had in Brafman's fathers lifetime become part of the [[Russian Empire]] following the [[Second Partition of Poland]]. Brafman grew up in poor conditions and was orphaned at a young age, being raised by relatives. Despite being under age, local agents of the ''[[qahal|kahal]]'' (the communal Jewish government ran by rabbis in the Pale, which dealt with taxation and conscription), placed Brafman on a list of "volunteers" for the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. Not being particularly fond of this idea, Brafman fled the reach of the kahal and went to Minsk, where he tried to establish himself as a [[photographer]].

Once in Minsk, Brafman converted to [[Lutheranism]] for a time, before in 1858 converting to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. There was a state visit to Minsk in that year by Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]] and Brafman submitted a memorandum on how Jews in Russia should best be proselytized into Orthodox Christianity and educated into "useful" subjects. The dichtomy of useful and usless Jews had been established by Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia]]. Nicholas saw "use" in bourgeois Jews who were willing to assimilate into Russian society and could be utilised in academic and agricultural professions, while seeing as "useless" the poorer adherents of [[Orthodox Judaism]] who lived in the ''shtets'' and kept themselves apart from wider society. Brafman's writing was sent to [[St. Petersburg]] and subsequently earned him the chair of [[Hebrew]] Studies at the Russian Orthodox Seminary in Minsk in 1860.&lt;ref name="yivo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Brafman_Iakov_Aleksandrovich|publisher=YIVO Encyclopedia|title=Brafman, Iakov Aleksandrovich|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brafman vs. the Kahal==
Brafman moved to [[Vilna]] in 1866 and began writing vehemently against the ''kahal'' and Jewish organisations more generally. Brafman; who had his own personal conflict with the ''kahal'' as a young man; argued that the kahal existed as a tyranny against individual Jews, while also being a system which enabled the exploitation of their non-Jewish neighbours.{{sfn|Webman|2012|p=60}} He argued that the mentality of the ''kahal'' was the main barrier to [[Jewish assimilation]]. Brafman worked on studying Jewish community books of the ''kahal'' from Minsk from the years 1794 and 1833, with his own commentary added to try and prove his thesis; at the same time the Rabbinical Seminary of Vilna was providing their own Russian translation. Brafman published his findings as ''The Book of the Kahal: Materials for the Study of the Jewish Life'' (1869). Brafman joined the [[Imperial Russian Geographical Society]] in 1870 and became a respected figure in academia.&lt;ref name="yivo"/&gt;

One of the main problems with Brafman's thesis was that the ''kahal'' system itself in the Russian Empire had been dissolved under Nicholas I in 1844.&lt;ref name="yivo"/&gt; For Brafman he posited a [[conspiracy theory]] that the ''kahal'' in fact continued to exist as a secret [[State within a state|shadow government]] among Jews, with reactionary rabbis working to keep control over the "average Jew" and to undermine Christian business interests at the same time. Brafman's works chimed well with the [[Slavophiles]] then active in Russia and the political theory of ''[[Orthodoxy, Autocracy and Nationality]]'', which sought to distance Russian civilisation from French and British [[liberalism]]. Brafman's other major work, ''The Local and Universal Jewish Brotherhoods'' (1868), took aim at international Jewish organisations, particularly those based in [[France]]. His main object for criticism was the ''[[Alliance Israélite Universelle]]'' under prominent [[freemason]], [[Adolphe Crémieux]].{{sfn|Webman|2012|p=60}} For Brafman this was the "kahal of kahals" and as part of an [[international Jewish conspiracy]] controlled the other ''kahals''.{{sfn|Webman|2012|p=60}} He saw this as the successor of the [[Grand Sanhedrin]] ([[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s Rabbinic Assembly of 1807).&lt;ref name="yivo"/&gt;

==Influence==
Brafman also took aim at the [[Talmud]], claiming that the Jews, using Talmudic principles, would exclude adherents of other religions from trade and industry and themselves accumulate all capital and landed property.{{sfn|Webman|2012|p=60}}&lt;ref name="yivo"/&gt; Brafman's works, which included the idea of a secret Jewish shadow government and the aspects of an internationally orchestrated "conspiracy" against all Christian nations, crossing over with masonic involvement, provided an essential framework for what would become, ''[[The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion]]'', authored by agents of the [[Okhrana]] at the turn of the 20th century.{{sfn|Webman|2012|p=60}}

Brafman was particularly well received by [[conservative]] Slavophiles in Russia. [[Vsevolod Krestovskii]], one of the most widely read Russian writers of the day, was inspired by Brafman to write a trilogy of novels; ''The Darkness of Egypt'', ''Tamara Bendavid'' and ''The Triumph of Baal''.{{sfn|Webman|2012|p=61}} For Krestovskii, the "kahal of kahals" in Paris, with a network of Jewish spies was used to back up British-French militarism against Russia, causing defeat in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]] of the [[Great Eastern Crisis]] (British Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] in particular is singled out as an "arch-villain").{{sfn|Webman|2012|p=61}}

[[Hal Draper]], an American Trotskyist, in his book ''Karl Marx's Theory of Revolution'' claimed that [[Mikhail Bakunin]]; one of the Russian founding figures of [[anarchism]]; was likely inspired by Brafman's writings on Jews.{{sfn|Draper|1989|p=296}} In the case of Bakunin, in a letter written in December 1871, he made the claim that Jews were a "collective parasite", and claimed that "this world is presently, at the disposal of [[Karl Marx|Marx]] on the one hand and the [[Rothschilds]] on the other," putting a conspiratorial spin on this theme as part of his rivalry with the Marxian socialists in the [[First International]].{{sfn|Draper|1989|p=296}}

'''Jean Piaget''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|p|i|ˈ|æ|ʒ|eɪ}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˌ|p|iː|ə|ˈ|ʒ|eɪ}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EPD|18}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|ʒɑ̃ pjaʒɛ|lang}}; 9 August 1896 – 16 September 1980) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] psychologist known for his work on child development. [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development]] and epistemological view are together called "[[genetic epistemology]]".

Piaget placed great importance on the education of children. As the Director of the [[International Bureau of Education]], he declared in 1934 that "only education is capable of saving our societies from possible collapse, whether violent, or gradual."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  His theory of child development is studied in pre-service education programs. Educators continue to incorporate constructivist-based strategies.

Piaget created the International Center for Genetic [[Epistemology]] in [[Geneva]] in 1955 while on the faculty of the [[University of Geneva]] and directed the Center until his death in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.piaget.org/aboutPiaget.html|title= About Piaget|publisher=Jean Piaget Society |accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of collaborations that its founding made possible, and their impact, ultimately led to the Center being referred to in the scholarly literature as "Piaget's factory".&lt;ref name="Burman-HoP2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burman|first=J.

==Personal life==
Piaget was born in 1896 in [[Neuchâtel]], in the [[Francophone region of Switzerland]]. He was the oldest son of Arthur Piaget (Swiss), a professor of [[medieval literature]] at the [[University of Neuchâtel]], and Rebecca Jackson (French). Piaget was a precocious child who developed an interest in biology and the natural world. His early interest in zoology earned him a reputation among those in the field after he had published several articles on mollusks by the age of 15.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biography.com/people/jean-piaget-9439915 "Jean Piaget"], Biography. Accessed 28 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; When he was 15, his former nanny wrote to his parents to apologize for having once lied to them about fighting off a would-be kidnapper from baby Jean's pram. There never was a kidnapper. Piaget became fascinated that he had somehow formed a memory of this kidnapping incident, a memory that endured even after he understood it to be false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Restak |first1=Richard |title=The Naked Brain: How the Emerging Neurosociety is Changing How We Live, Work, and Love |date=2006 |publisher=Harmony |location=New York |page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He developed an interest in [[epistemology]] due to his godfather's urgings to study the fields of philosophy and logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Biehler|first1=Robert F.|title=Psychology Applied to Teaching|date=1978|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|page=113|isbn=0395119219}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at the University of Neuchâtel, and studied briefly at the [[University of Zürich]]. During this time, he published two philosophical papers that showed the direction of his thinking at the time, but which he later dismissed as adolescent thought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.piaget.org/aboutPiaget.html A Brief Biography of Jean Piaget], Jean Piaget Society (Society for the study of knowledge and development)&lt;/ref&gt; His interest in [[psychoanalysis]], at the time a burgeoning strain of psychology, can also be dated to this period. Piaget moved from Switzerland to Paris, France after his graduation and he taught at the Grange-Aux-Belles Street School for Boys. The school was run by [[Alfred Binet]], the developer of the Binet-Simon test (later revised by Lewis Terman to become the [[Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales]]). Piaget assisted in the marking of Binet's intelligence tests. It was while he was helping to mark some of these tests that Piaget noticed that young children consistently gave wrong answers to certain questions. Piaget did not focus so much on the fact of the children's answers being wrong, but that young children consistently made types of mistakes that older children and adults did not. This led him to the theory that young children's cognitive processes are inherently different from those of adults. Ultimately, he was to propose a global theory of cognitive developmental stages in which individuals exhibit certain common patterns of cognition in each period of development. In 1921, Piaget returned to Switzerland as director of the [[Rousseau Institute]] in [[Geneva]]. At this time, the institute was directed by [[Édouard Claparède]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gseacademic.harvard.edu/~hgsebio/presentations/A%20Brief%20Biography%20of%20Jean%20Piaget.pdf|title=A Brief Biography of Jean Piaget|author=Mayer, Susan |date=21 October 2005|website=gseacademic.harvard.edu|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piaget was familiar with many of Claparède's ideas including that of the psychological concept 'groping' which was closely associated with "trials and errors" observed in human mental patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Voyat, G. |year=1981|title=Jean Piaget: 1896–1980|journal=The American Journal of Psychology|volume=94|issue=4|pages= 645–648|pmid=7044156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, he married Valentine Châtenay (7 January 1899 – 3 July 1983)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondationjeanpiaget.ch/fjp/site/biographie/index_biographie.php Fondation Jean Piaget – Biographie]. Fondationjeanpiaget.ch. Retrieved on 2018-02-26.&lt;/ref&gt; the couple had three children, whom Piaget studied from infancy. From 1925 to 1929, Piaget worked as a professor of psychology, sociology, and the philosophy of science at
the [[University of Neuchatel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/h0020564|pmid=4910176|title=Distinguished Scientific Contribution Awards: 1969: Citation for Jean Piaget|journal=American Psychologist|volume=25|issue=1|pages=65–79|year=1970|author=Anon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, Jean Piaget accepted the post of Director of the International Bureau of Education and remained the head of this international organization until 1968. Every year, he drafted his "Director's Speeches" for the IBE Council and for the International Conference on Public Education in which he explicitly addressed his educational credo.

Having taught at the [[University of Geneva]] and at the [[University of Paris]], in 1964, Piaget was invited to serve as chief consultant at two conferences at [[Cornell University]] (March 11–13) and [[University of California, Berkeley]] (March 16–18). The conferences addressed the relationship of cognitive studies and curriculum development and strived to conceive implications of recent investigations of children's cognitive development for curricula.&lt;ref&gt;Rockcastle, Verne N. (1964, p. xi), the conference director, wrote in the conference report of the Jean Piaget conferences about Piaget: "Although few of us had any personal contact with Piaget prior to the conference, those who attended came to have the deepest and warmest regard for him both as a scientist and as a person. His sense of humor throughout the conference was a sort of international glue that flavored his lectures and punctuated his informal conversation. To sit at the table with him during a meal was not only an intellectual pleasure but a pure social delight. Piaget was completely unsophisticated in spite of his international stature. We could hardly believe it when he came prepared for two weeks' stay with only his 'serviette' and a small Swissair bag. An American would have hat at least two large suitcases. When Piaget left Berkeley, he had his serviette, the small Swissair bag, and a third, larger bag crammed with botanical specimens. 'Where did you get that bag?' we asked. 'I had it in one of the others,' he replied."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 he was awarded the [[Balzan Prize]] for Social and Political Sciences. He died in 1980 and was buried with his family in an unmarked grave in the [[Cimetière des Rois]] (Cemetery of Kings) in Geneva. This was as per his request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burman|first1=Jeremy Trevelyan|year=2013|title=Profiles of international archives: Les archives Jean Piaget, University of Geneva, Switzerland|journal=History of Psychology|volume=16|issue=2|pages=158–61|doi=10.1037/a0031405|pmid=23544355}}.

==Career history==
[[File:Jean Piaget.jpg|thumb|Bust of Jean Piaget in the [[Parc des Bastions]], [[Geneva]]]]
Harry Beilin described Jean Piaget's theoretical [[research program]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.28.2.191 | last1 = Beilin | first1 = H. | year = 1992 | title = Piaget's enduring contribution to developmental psychology | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 191–204 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as consisting of four phases:
# the sociological model of development,
# the biological model of intellectual development,
# the elaboration of the logical model of intellectual development,
# the study of figurative thought.
The resulting theoretical frameworks are sufficiently different from each other that they have been characterized as representing different "Piagets." More recently, Jeremy Burman responded to Beilin and called for the addition of a phase before his turn to psychology: "the zeroeth Piaget."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burman | first1 = J. T. | year = 2011 | title = The zeroeth Piaget| journal = [[Theory &amp; Psychology]] | volume = 21 | issue = 1| pages = 130–135 | doi = 10.1177/0959354310361407 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Piaget before psychology===
Before Piaget became a psychologist, he trained in [[natural history]] and [[philosophy]]. He received a doctorate in 1918 from the [[University of Neuchatel]]. He then undertook post-doctoral training in Zurich (1918–1919), and Paris (1919–1921). He was hired by [[Théodore Simon]] to standardize [[psychometrics|psychometric measures]] for use with French children in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = The Early Evolution of Jean Piaget's Clinical Method|last = Mayer|first = Susan|date = 2005|journal = History of Psychology|volume = 8|issue = 4|pages = 362–82|doi = 10.1037/1093-4510.8.4.362|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6646116_The_Early_Evolution_of_Jean_Piaget%27s_Clinical_Method|pmid = 17152748}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theorist we recognize today only emerged when he moved to Geneva, to work for [[Édouard Claparède]] as director of research at the [[Rousseau Institute]], in 1922.

===Sociological model of development===
Piaget first developed as a psychologist in the 1920s. He investigated the hidden side of children’s minds. Piaget proposed that children moved from a position of [[egocentrism]] to [[sociocentrism]]. For this explanation he combined the use of psychological and [[clinical method]]s to create what he called a semiclinical [[interview]]. He began the interview by asking children standardized questions and depending on how they answered, he would ask them a series of nonstandard questions. Piaget was looking for what he called "spontaneous conviction" so he often asked questions the children neither expected nor anticipated. In his studies, he noticed there was a gradual progression from intuitive to scientific and socially acceptable responses. Piaget theorized children did this because of the social interaction and the challenge to younger children’s ideas by the ideas of those children who were more advanced.

This work was used by [[Elton Mayo]] as the basis for the famous [[Hawthorne effect|Hawthorne Experiments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hsueh, Y. |year=2001|title=Basing much of the reasoning upon the work of Jean Piaget, 1927–1936|journal= Archives de Psychologie|volume= 69|issue=268–269|pages=39–62|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-15215-002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hsueh, Y. |year=2002|title=The Hawthorne Experiments and the introduction of Jean Piaget in American Industrial Psychology, 1929–1932|journal= History of Psychology|volume= 5|issue=2|pages=163–189|doi=10.1037/1093-4510.5.2.163}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Piaget, it also led to an honorary doctorate from Harvard in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hsueh | first1 = Y | year = 2004 | title = He sees the development of children's concepts upon a background of sociology": Jean Piaget's honorary degree at Harvard University in 1936 |journal = History of Psychology | volume = 7 | issue = 1| pages = 20–44 | doi = 10.1037/1093-4510.7.1.20 | pmid = 15022668 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological model of intellectual development===
In this stage, Piaget believed that the process of thinking and the intellectual development could be regarded as an extension of the biological process of the [[adaptation]] of the species, which has also two on-going processes: assimilation and accommodation. There is ''assimilation'' when a child responds to a new event in a way that is consistent with an existing [[schema (psychology)|schema]].&lt;ref name = Ormrod&gt;Ormrod, J.E. (2012). ''Essentials of Educational Psychology: Big Ideas to Guide Effective Teaching''. Boston, MA: Pearson Education Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; There is ''accommodation'' when a child either modifies an existing schema or forms an entirely new schema to deal with a new object or event.&lt;ref name = Ormrod/&gt;

He argued infants were engaging in an act of assimilation when they sucked on everything in their reach. He claimed infants transform all objects into an object to be sucked. The children were assimilating the objects to conform to their own mental structures. Piaget then made the assumption that whenever one transforms the world to meet individual needs or conceptions, one is, in a way, assimilating it. Piaget also observed his children not only assimilating objects to fit their needs, but also modifying some of their mental structures to meet the demands of the environment. This is the second division of adaptation known as accommodation. To start out, the infants only engaged in primarily reflex actions such as sucking, but not long after, they would pick up objects and put them in their mouths. When they do this, they modify their reflex response to accommodate the external objects into reflex actions. Because the two are often in conflict, they provide the impetus for intellectual development. The constant need to balance the two triggers intellectual growth.

To test his theory, Piaget observed the [[habit (psychology)|habit]]s in his own children.

===Elaboration of the logical model of intellectual development===
In the model Piaget developed in stage three, he argued that intelligence develops in a series of stages that are related to age and are progressive because one stage must be accomplished before the next can occur. For each stage of development the child forms a view of reality for that age period. At the next stage, the child must keep up with earlier level of mental abilities to reconstruct concepts. Piaget conceived intellectual development as an upward expanding spiral in which children must constantly reconstruct the ideas formed at earlier levels with new, higher order concepts acquired at the next level.

It is primarily the "Third Piaget" (the logical model of intellectual development) that was debated by American psychologists when Piaget's ideas were "rediscovered" in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Hsueh, Y. (2005). The lost and found experience: Piaget rediscovered. The Constructivist, 16(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Study of figurative thought===
Piaget studied areas of intelligence like [[perception]] and [[memory]] that are not entirely logical. Logical concepts are described as being completely reversible because they can always get back to the starting point, meaning that if one starts with a given premise and follows logical steps to reach a conclusion, the same steps may be done in the opposite order, starting from the conclusion to arrive at the premise. The perceptual concepts Piaget studied could not be manipulated. To describe the figurative process, Piaget uses pictures as examples. Pictures cannot be separated because contours cannot be separated from the forms they outline. Memory is the same way: it is never completely reversible; people cannot necessarily recall all the intervening events between two points. During this last period of work, Piaget and his colleague Inhelder also published books on perception, memory, and other figurative processes such as learning.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, James W. (2003) "Piaget, Jean (1896–1980)" in ''Encyclopedia of Education''. 2nd ed. Vol. 5. New York, NY: Macmillan Reference USA. pp. 1894–898.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF02687400 | last1 = Valsiner | first1 = J. | year = 2005 | title = Participating in Piaget | journal = Society | volume = 42 | issue = 2| pages = 57–61 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Piaget's theory is based upon biological maturation and stages, the notion of readiness is important. Readiness concerns when certain information or concepts should be taught. According to Piaget's theory, children should not be taught certain concepts until they reached the appropriate stage of cognitive development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Britannica|459096|Jean Piaget}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, young children in the [[preoperational stage]] engage in "irreversible" thought and cannot comprehend that an item that has been transformed in some way may be returned to its original state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/preoperational.html |title=Preoperational Stage - Egocentrism |last=McLeod |first=Saul |website=Simply Psychology |language=en |access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
{{Main|Piaget's theory of cognitive development}}
Piaget defined himself as a 'genetic' [[Epistemology|epistemologist]], interested in the process of the qualitative development of knowledge. He considered cognitive structures development as a differentiation of biological regulations. When his entire theory first became known – the theory in itself being based on a structuralist and a cognitivitist approach – it was an outstanding and exciting development in regards to the psychological community at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Howard (1981) ''The Quest for Mind: Piaget, Levi-Strauss and the Structuralist Movement'', University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a total of four phases in Piaget's research program that included books on certain topics of developmental psychology. In particular, during one period of research, he described himself studying his own three children, and carefully observing and interpreting their cognitive development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Beilin Harry |title=Piaget's Enduring Contribution to Developmental Psychology|year=1992|url= http://psycnet.apa.org/books/10155/023|journal=American Psychological Association|volume=28|issue=2|pages=191–204|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.28.2.191}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one of his last books, ''Equilibration of Cognitive Structures: The Central Problem of Intellectual Development'', he intends to explain knowledge development as a process of equilibration using two main concepts in his theory, assimilation and accommodation, as belonging not only to biological interactions but also to cognitive ones.

Piaget believed answers for the epistemological questions at his time could be answered, or better proposed, if one looked to the genetic aspect of it, hence his experimentations with children and adolescents. As he says in the introduction of his book ''Genetic Epistemology'': "What the genetic epistemology proposes is discovering the roots of the different varieties of knowledge, since its elementary forms, following to the next levels, including also the scientific knowledge."

===Stages===
The four development stages are described in Piaget's theory as:

'''1.''' ''[[Theory of cognitive development#Sensorimotor stage|Sensorimotor stage]]'': from birth to age two. The children experience the world through movement and their senses. During the sensorimotor stage children are extremely egocentric, meaning they cannot perceive the world from others' viewpoints. The sensorimotor stage is divided into six substages:&lt;ref name="Santrock, John W. 1998"&gt;Santrock, John W. (1998) Children. 9. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

:I. Simple reflexes;
::From birth to one month old. At this time infants use reflexes such as rooting and sucking.
:II. First habits and primary circular reactions;
::From one month to four months old. During this time infants learn to coordinate sensation and two types of schema (habit and circular reactions). A primary circular reaction is when the infant tries to reproduce an event that happened by accident (ex.: sucking thumb).
:III. Secondary circular reactions;
::From four to eight months old. At this time they become aware of things beyond their own body; they are more object-oriented. At this time they might accidentally shake a rattle and continue to do it for sake of satisfaction.
:IV. Coordination of secondary circular reactions;
::From eight months to twelve months old. During this stage they can do things intentionally. They can now combine and recombine schemata and try to reach a goal (ex.: use a stick to reach something). They also begin to understand [[object permanence]] in the later months and early into the next stage. That is, they understand that objects continue to exist even when they can't see them.
:V. Tertiary circular reactions, novelty, and curiosity;
::From twelve months old to eighteen months old. During this stage infants explore new possibilities of objects; they try different things to get different results.
:VI. Internalization of schemata.

Some followers of Piaget's studies of infancy, such as [[Kenneth Kaye]]&lt;ref name="K. Kaye, 1982"&gt;Kaye, K. (1982) ''The Mental and Social Life of Babies''. U. Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; argue that his contribution was as an observer of countless phenomena not previously described, but that he didn't offer explanation of the processes in real time that cause those developments, beyond analogizing them to broad concepts about biological adaptation generally. Kaye's "apprenticeship theory" of cognitive and social development refuted Piaget's assumption that mind developed endogenously in infants until the capacity for symbolic reasoning allowed them to learn language.

'''2.''' ''[[Theory of cognitive development#Preoperational stage|Preoperational stage]]'': Piaget's second stage, the pre-operational stage, starts when the child begins to learn to speak at age two and lasts up until the age of seven. During the pre-operational Stage of cognitive development, Piaget noted that children do not yet understand concrete logic and cannot mentally manipulate information. Children’s increase in playing and pretending takes place in this stage. However, the child still has trouble seeing things from different points of view. The children's play is mainly categorized by symbolic play and manipulating symbols. Such play is demonstrated by the idea of checkers being snacks, pieces of paper being plates, and a box being a table. Their observations of symbols exemplifies the idea of play with the absence of the actual objects involved. By observing sequences of play, Piaget was able to demonstrate that, towards the end of the second year, a qualitatively new kind of psychological functioning occurs, known as the Pre-operational Stage.&lt;ref name="Santrock, John W. 2004"&gt;Santrock, John W. (2004). Life-Span Development (9th Ed.). Boston, MA: McGraw-Hill College – Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-operational stage is sparse and logically inadequate in regard to mental operations. The child is able to form stable concepts as well as magical beliefs. The child, however, is still not able to perform operations, which are tasks that the child can do mentally, rather than physically. Thinking in this stage is still egocentric, meaning the child has difficulty seeing the viewpoint of others. The Pre-operational Stage is split into two substages: the symbolic function substage, and the intuitive thought substage. The symbolic function substage is when children are able to understand, represent, remember, and picture objects in their mind without having the object in front of them. The intuitive thought substage is when children tend to propose the questions of "why?" and "how come?" This stage is when children want the knowledge of knowing everything.&lt;ref name="Santrock, John W. 2004"/&gt;

The Preoperational Stage is divided into two substages:
:I. [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development#Symbolic function substage|Symbolic Function Substage]]
::From two to four years of age children find themselves using symbols to represent physical models of the world around them. This is demonstrated through a child's drawing of their family in which people are not drawn to scale or accurate physical traits are given. The child knows they are not accurate but it does not seem to be an issue to them.
:II. [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development#Intuitive thought substage|Intuitive Thought Substage]]
::At between about the ages of four and seven, children tend to become very curious and ask many questions, beginning the use of primitive reasoning. There is an emergence in the interest of reasoning and wanting to know why things are the way they are. Piaget called it the "intuitive substage" because children realize they have a vast amount of knowledge, but they are unaware of how they acquired it. Centration, conservation, irreversibility, class inclusion, and transitive inference are all characteristics of preoperative thought.&lt;ref name="Santrock, John W. 2004"/&gt;

'''3.''' ''[[Theory of cognitive development#Concrete operational stage|Concrete operational stage]]'': from ages seven to eleven. Children can now conserve and think logically (they understand reversibility) but are limited to what they can physically manipulate. They are no longer egocentric. During this stage, children become more aware of logic and conservation, topics previously foreign to them. Children also improve drastically with their classification skills

'''4.''' ''[[Theory of cognitive development#Formal operational stage|Formal operational stage]]'': from age eleven to sixteen and onwards (development of abstract reasoning). Children develop abstract thought and can easily conserve and think logically in their mind. Abstract thought is newly present during this stage of development. Children are now able to think abstractly and utilize [[metacognition]]. Along with this, the children in the formal operational stage display more skills oriented towards problem solving, often in multiple steps.

=== Developmental process ===
Piaget provided no concise description of the development process as a whole. Broadly speaking it consisted of a cycle:

*The child performs an action which has an effect on or organizes objects, and the child is able to note the characteristics of the action and its effects.
*Through repeated actions, perhaps with variations or in different contexts or on different kinds of objects, the child is able to differentiate and integrate its elements and effects. This is the process of "reflecting abstraction" (described in detail in Piaget 2001).
*At the same time, the child is able to identify the properties of objects by the way different kinds of action affect them. This is the process of "empirical abstraction".
*By repeating this process across a wide range of objects and actions, the child establishes a new level of knowledge and insight. This is the process of forming a new "[[cognitive]] stage". This dual process allows the child to construct new ways of dealing with objects and new knowledge about objects themselves.
*However, once the child has constructed these new kinds of knowledge, he or she starts to use them to create still more complex objects and to carry out still more complex actions. As a result, the child starts to recognize still more complex patterns and to construct still more complex objects. Thus a new stage begins, which will only be completed when all the child's activity and experience have been re-organized on this still higher level.

This process may not be wholly gradual, but new evidence shows that the passage into new stages is more gradual than once thought. Once a new level of organization, knowledge and insight proves to be effective, it will quickly be generalized to other areas ''if they exist''. As a result, transitions between stages can seem to be rapid and radical, but oftentimes the child has grasped one aspect of the new stage of cognitive functioning but not addressed others. The bulk of the time spent in a new stage consists of refining this new cognitive level; however it does not always happen quickly. For example, a child may see that two different colors of Play-Doh have been fused  together to make one ball, based on the color. However, if sugar is mixed into water or iced tea, then the sugar "disappeared" and therefore does not exist to the child at that stage. These levels of one concept of cognitive development are not realized all at once, giving us a gradual realization of the world around us.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Patrica H. (2009) ''Theories of Developmental Psychology'' 5th Edition, Worth Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is because this process takes this [[dialectic]]al form, in which each new stage is created through the further differentiation, integration, and synthesis of new structures out of the old, that the sequence of cognitive stages are logically necessary rather than simply empirically correct. Each new stage emerges only because the child can take for granted the achievements of its predecessors, and yet there are still more sophisticated forms of knowledge and action that are capable of being developed.

Because it covers both how we gain knowledge about objects and our reflections on our own actions, Piaget's model of development explains a number of features of human knowledge that had never previously been accounted for. For example, by showing how children progressively enrich their understanding of things by acting on and reflecting on the effects of their own previous knowledge, they are able to organize their knowledge in increasingly complex structures. Thus, once a young child can consistently and accurately recognize different kinds of animals, he or she then acquires the ability to organize the different kinds into higher groupings such as "birds", "fish", and so on. This is significant because they are now able to know things about a new animal simply on the basis of the fact that it is a bird – for example, that it will lay eggs.

At the same time, by reflecting on their own actions, the child develops an increasingly sophisticated awareness of the "rules" that govern in various ways. For example, it is by this route that Piaget explains this child's growing awareness of notions such as "right", "valid", "necessary", "proper", and so on. In other words, it is through the process of [[objectification]], [[Introspection|reflection]] and [[abstraction]] that the child constructs the principles on which action is not only effective or correct but also ''justified''.

One of Piaget's most famous studies focused purely on the discriminative abilities of children between the ages of two and a half years old, and four and a half years old. He began the study by taking children of different ages and placing two lines of sweets, one with the sweets in a line spread further apart, and one with the same number of sweets in a line placed more closely together. He found that, "Children between 2 years, 6 months old and 3 years, 2 months old correctly discriminate the relative number of objects in two rows; between 3 years, 2 months and 4 years, 6 months they indicate a longer row with fewer objects to have "more"; after 4 years, 6 months they again discriminate correctly" (''Cognitive Capacity of Very Young Children'', p.&amp;nbsp;141). Initially younger children were not studied, because if at four years old a child could not [[Conservation of quantity|conserve quantity]], then a younger child presumably could not either. The results show however that children that are younger than three years and two months have quantity conservation, but as they get older they lose this quality, and do not recover it until four and a half years old. This attribute may be lost due to a temporary inability to solve because of an overdependence on perceptual strategies, which correlates more candy with a longer line of candy, or due to the inability for a four-year-old to reverse situations.

By the end of this experiment several results were found. First, younger children have a discriminative ability that shows the logical capacity for cognitive operations exists earlier than acknowledged. This study also reveals that young children can be equipped with certain qualities for cognitive operations, depending on how logical the structure of the task is. Research also shows that children develop explicit understanding at age 5 and as a result, the child will count the sweets to decide which has more. Finally the study found that overall quantity conservation is not a basic characteristic of humans' native inheritance.

=== Genetic epistemology ===
According to Jean Piaget, [[genetic epistemology]] attempts to "explain knowledge, and in particular [[scientific]] knowledge, on the basis of its history, its sociogenesis, and especially the psychological origins of the notions and operations upon which it is based". Piaget believed he could test [[epistemology|epistemological]] questions by studying the development of thought and action in children. As a result, Piaget created a field known as genetic epistemology with its own methods and problems. He defined this field as the study of [[child development]] as a means of answering epistemological questions.

===Schema===
A Schema is a structured cluster of concepts, it can be used to represent objects, scenarios or sequences of events or relations. The original idea was proposed by philosopher Immanuel Kant as innate structures used to help us perceive the world.&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck, Michael W. and Keane, Mark. T. (2010). ''Cognitive Psychology: A Student's Handbook'', (6th.). East Sussex: Psychology Press..
&lt;/ref&gt;

A schema (pl. schemata) is the mental framework that is created as children interact with their physical and social environments.&lt;ref&gt;Naested, I., Potvin, B., &amp; Waldron, P. (2004). Understanding the landscape of teaching. Toronto, Ontario: Pearson Education Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, many 3-year-olds insist that the sun is alive because it comes up in the morning and goes down at night. According to Piaget, these children are operating based on a simple cognitive schema that things that move are alive. At any age, children rely on their current cognitive structures to understand the world around them. Moreover, younger and older children may often interpret and respond to the same objects and events in very different ways because cognitive structures take different forms at different ages.&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer, D. R., Wood, E., &amp; Willoughby, T. (2005). Developmental psychology: Childhood and adolescence. Toronto, Ontario: Nelson Education Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;

Piaget (1953) described three kinds of intellectual structures: behavioural (or sensorimotor) schemata, symbolic schemata, and operational schemata.

*''Behavioural schemata'': organized patterns of behaviour that are used to represent and respond to objects and experiences.
*''Symbolic schemata'': internal mental symbols (such as images or verbal codes) that one uses to represent aspects of experience.
*''Operational schemata'': internal mental activity that one performs on objects of thought.&lt;ref&gt;Piaget, J. (1953). The origin of intelligence in the child. New Fetter Lane, New York: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Piaget, children use the process of [[Constructivist theory|assimilation and accommodation]] to create a schema or mental framework for how they perceive and/or interpret what they are experiencing. As a result, the early concepts of young children tend to be more global or general in nature.&lt;ref name="Auger, W. F. 2007"&gt;Auger, W. F., &amp; Rich, S. J. (2007). Curriculum theory and methods: Perspectives on learning and teaching. Mississauga, Ontario: John Wiley &amp; Sons Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Gallagher and Reid (1981) maintained that adults view children’s concepts as highly generalized and even inaccurate. With added experience, interactions, and maturity, these concepts become refined and more detailed. Overall, making sense of the world from a child’s perspective is a very complex and time-consuming process.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, J. M., &amp; Reid, D. K. (1981). The learning theory of Piaget and Inhelder. Austin, Texas: Pro-Ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schemata are:
*Critically important building block of conceptual development
*Constantly in the process of being modified or changed
*Modified by on-going experiences
*A generalized idea, usually based on experience or prior knowledge.&lt;ref name="Auger, W. F. 2007"/&gt;

These schemata are constantly being revised and elaborated upon each time the child encounters new experiences. In doing this children create their own unique understanding of the world, interpret their own experiences and knowledge, and subsequently use this knowledge to solve more complex problems. In a neurological sense, the brain/mind is constantly working to build and rebuild itself as it takes in, adapts/modifies new information, and enhances understanding.&lt;ref name="Auger, W. F. 2007"/&gt;

====Physical microstructure of schemata====
In his ''Biology and Knowledge'' (1967+ / French 1965), Piaget tentatively hinted at possible physical embodiments for his abstract schema entities. At the time, there was much talk and research about RNA as such an agent of learning, and Piaget considered some of the evidence. However, he did not offer any firm conclusions, and confessed that this was beyond his area of expertise.

==Research methods==

Piaget wanted to revolutionize the way research was conducted. Although he started researching with his colleagues using a traditional method of data collection, he was not fully satisfied with the results and wanted to keep trying to find new ways of researching using a combination of data, which included [[naturalistic observation]], [[psychometrics]], and the psychiatric clinical examination, in order to have a less guided form of research that would produce more empirically valid results.
As Piaget developed new research methods, he wrote a book called ''The Language and Thought of the Child'', which aimed to synthesize the methods he was using in order to study the conclusion children drew from situations and how they arrived to such conclusion. The main idea was to observe how children responded and articulated certain situations with their own reasoning, in order to examine their thought processes (Mayer, 2005).

Piaget administered a test in 15 boys with ages ranging from 10 to 14 years in which he asked participants to describe the relationship between a mixed bouquet of flowers and a bouquet with flowers of the same color. The purpose of this study was to analyze the thinking process the boys had and to draw conclusions about the logic processes they had used, which was a psychometric technique of research. Piaget also used the psychoanalytic method initially developed by Sigmund Freud. The purpose of using such method was to examine the unconscious mind, as well as to continue parallel studies using different research methods. Psychoanalysis was later rejected by Piaget, as he thought it was insufficiently empirical (Mayer, 2005).

Piaget argued that children and adults used speech for different purposes. In order to confirm his argument, he experimented analyzing a child's interpretation of a story. In the experiment, the child listened to a story and then told a friend that same story in his/her/their own words. The purpose of this study was to examine how children verbalize and understand each other without adult intervention. Piaget wanted to examine the limits of naturalistic observation, in order to understand a child's reasoning. He realized the difficulty of studying children's thoughts, as it is hard to know if a child is pretending to believe their thoughts or not. Piaget was the pioneer researcher to examine children's conversations in a social context – starting from examining their speech and actions – where children were comfortable and spontaneous (Kose, 1987).

===Issues and possible solutions===

After conducting many studies, Piaget was able to find significant differences in the way adults and children reason; however, he was still unable to find the path of logic reasoning and the unspoken thoughts children had, which could allow him to study a child's intellectual development over time (Mayer, 2005). In his third book, ''The Child's Conception of the World'', Piaget recognized the difficulties of his prior techniques and the importance of psychiatric clinical examination. The researcher believed that the way clinical examinations were conducted influenced how a child's inner realities surfaced. Children would likely respond according to the way the research is conducted, the questions asked, or the familiarity they have with the environment. The clinical examination conducted for his third book provides a thorough investigation into a child's thinking process. An example of a question used to research such process was: "Can you see a thought?" (Mayer, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;372).

===Development of new methods===
Piaget recognized that psychometric tests had its limitations, as children were not able to provide the researcher with their deepest thoughts and inner intellect. It was also difficult to know if the results of child examination reflected what children believed or if it is just a pretend situation. For example, it is very difficult to know with certainty if a child who has a conversation with a toy believes the toy is alive or if the child is just pretending. Soon after drawing conclusions about psychometric studies, Piaget started developing the clinical method of examination. The clinical method included questioning a child and carefully examining their responses – in order to observe how the child reasoned according to the questions asked – and then examining the child's perception of the world through their responses. Piaget recognized the difficulties of interviewing a child and the importance of recognizing the difference between "liberated" versus "spontaneous" responses (Mayer, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;372).

====Criticism of Piaget's research methods====
"The developmental theory of Jean Piaget has been criticized on the grounds that it is conceptually limited, empirically false, or philosophically and epistemologically untenable." Piaget responded to criticism by contending that the vast majority of critics did not understand the outcomes he wished to obtain from his research.&lt;ref name=lm&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.103.1.143 | last1 = Lourenço | first1 = O. | last2 = Machado | first2 = A. | year = 1996 | title = In defense of Piaget's theory: A reply to ten common criticisms | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 103 | issue = 1| pages = 143–164 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Piaget believed development was a universal process, his initial sample sizes were inadequate, particularly in the formulation of his theory of infant development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/h0078835|title=Amazing new discovery: Piaget was wrong!|journal=Canadian Psychology/Psychologie canadienne|volume=34|issue=3|pages=239|year=1993|last1=Siegel|first1=Linda S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piaget's theories of infant development were based on his observations of his own three children. While this clearly presents problems with the sample size, Piaget also probably introduced confounding variables and social desirability into his observations and his conclusions based on his observations. It is entirely possible Piaget conditioned his children to respond in a desirable manner, so, rather than having an understanding of object permanence, his children might have learned to behave in a manner that indicated they understood object permanence. The sample was also very homogenous, as all three children had a similar genetic heritage and environment. Piaget did, however, have larger sample sizes during his later years.

===Development of research methods===

Piaget wanted to research in environments that would allow children to connect with some existing aspects of the world. The idea was to change the approach described in his book ''The Child's Conception of the World'' and move away from the vague questioning interviews. This new approach was described in his book ''The Child's Conception of Physical Causality'', where children were presented with dilemmas and had to think of possible solutions on their own. Later, after carefully analyzing previous methods, Piaget developed a combination of naturalistic observation with clinical interviewing in his book ''Judgment and Reasoning in the Child'', where a child's intellect was tested with questions and close monitoring. Piaget was convinced he had found a way to analyze and access a child's thoughts about the world in a very effective way (Mayer, 2005). Piaget's research provided a combination of theoretical and practical research methods and it has offered a crucial contribution to the field of developmental psychology (Beilin, 1992). "Piaget is often criticized because his method of investigation, though somewhat modified in recent years, is still largely clinical". He observes a child's surroundings and behavior. He then comes up with a hypothesis testing it and focusing on both the surroundings and behavior after changing a little of the surrounding.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, John L. (1969).

*[[Developmental psychology]]
*[[Education]] and [[Morality]]

*[[Artificial intelligence (AI)]]

=== Developmental psychology ===
Piaget is the most influential developmental psychologist to date,&lt;ref name=lm/&gt; influencing not only the work of [[Lev Vygotsky]] and of [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] but whole generations of eminent academics.{{Clarify|date=December 2012}} Although subjecting his ideas to massive scrutiny led to innumerable improvements and qualifications of his original model and the emergence of a plethora of neo-Piagetian and post-Piagetian variants, Piaget's original model has proved to be remarkably robust.&lt;ref name=lm/&gt;

=== Piaget on education ===

By using Piaget’s theory, educators focus on their students as learners. As a result of this focus, education is learner-center and constructivist-based to an extent. Piaget’s theory allows teachers to view students as individual learners who add new concepts to prior knowledge  to construct, or build, understanding for themselves.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henson|first1=Kenneth|title=Foundations for Learner-Centered Education: A Knowledge Base|journal=Education|date=2003|volume=1124|issue=1|pages=5–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teachers who use a learner-centered approach as a basis for their professional practices incorporate the several dispositions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; They provide experience-based educational opportunities. These teachers also contemplate the learners’ individual qualities and attitudes during curriculum planning. Educators allow learners’ insights to alter the curriculum. They nourish and support learners’ curiosity. They also involve learners’ emotions and create a learning environment in which students feel safe.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

There are two differences between the preoperational and concrete operational stages that apply to education. These differences are reversibility and decentration. At times, reversibility and decentration occur at the same time.&lt;ref name="Educational Psychology"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seifert|first1=Kelvin|last2=Sutton|first2=Rosemary|title=Educational Psychology|date=2009|publisher=Orange Grove|location=Florida|isbn=978-1616101541|edition=2nd|url=http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Educational-Psychology.pdf|accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When students think about the steps to complete a task without using a particular logical, sequential order, they are using reversibility.&lt;ref name="Educational Psychology"/&gt; Decentration allows them to concentrate on multiple components of a problematic task at a time.&lt;ref name="Educational Psychology"/&gt; Students use both reversibility and decentration  to function throughout the school day, follow directions, and complete assignments.

An example of a student using reversibility is when learning new vocabulary. The student creates a list of unfamiliar words from a literary text. Then, he researches the definition of those words before asking classmate to test him. His teacher has given a set of particular instructions that he must follow in a particular order: he must write the word before defining it, and complete these two steps repeatedly.&lt;ref name="Educational Psychology"/&gt; A child in the preoperational stage gets confused during this process and needs assistance from the teacher to stay on task. The  teacher refers him back to his text in order to notate the next word before he can define it.&lt;ref name="Educational Psychology"/&gt;  A child in the preoperational stage does not understand the organization required to complete this assignment.  However, a child in the concrete operational stage understands the organization, and he can recall the steps in any order while being able to follow the order given.&lt;ref name="Educational Psychology"/&gt; Using decentration, the child has the two activities on his mind: identify words and find them in the dictionary.&lt;ref name="Educational Psychology"/&gt;

A sample of decentration is a preschooler may use a toy banana as a pretend telephone. The child knows the difference between the fruit and a phone. However, in this form of play, he is operating on two levels at once.&lt;ref name="Educational Psychology"/&gt;  In an older child at the concrete operational level, decentration allows him to complete subtraction of two-digit numbers and indicate which of the problems also involved borrowing from the other column.  The student simultaneously does both.&lt;ref name="Educational Psychology"/&gt;  Using reversibility, the student has to move mentally between two subtasks.

Regarding the giving of praise by teachers, praise is a reinforcer for students. Adolescents undergo social-emotional development such that they seek rapport with peers. Thus, teacher praise is not as powerful for students who see teachers as authority figures. They give no value to praise provided by adults, or they have no respect for the individual who is giving praise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hawkins|first1=Shannon M.|last2=Heflin|first2=L. Juane|title=Increasing Secondary Teachers' Behavior-Specific Praise Using a Video Self-Modeling and Visual Performance Feedback Intervention|journal=Journal of Positive Behavior Interventions|date=2001|volume=12|issue=2|pages=97–108|doi=10.1177/1098300709358110}}&lt;!--|accessdate=July 7, 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
During the 1970s and 1980s, Piaget's works also inspired the transformation of European and American [[education]], including both theory and practice, leading to a more ‘child-centered’ approach. In ''Conversations with Jean Piaget'', he says: "Education, for most people, means trying to lead the child to resemble the typical adult of his society ... but for me and no one else, education means making creators... You have to make inventors, innovators—not conformists" (Bringuier, 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;132).

His [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|theory of cognitive development]] can be used as a tool in the [[early childhood education|early childhood]] classroom. According to Piaget, children developed best in a classroom with [[Social interaction|interaction]].

Piaget defined knowledge as the ability to modify, transform, and "operate on" an object or idea, such that it is understood by the operator through the process of transformation.&lt;ref name="Piaget"&gt;Piaget, J. (1964). "Development and learning". In R.E. Ripple and V.N. Rockcastle (Eds.), ''Piaget Rediscovered: A Report on the Conference of Cognitive Studies and Curriculum Development'' (pp. 7–20). Ithaca, NY: Cornell University.&lt;/ref&gt; Learning, then, occurs as a result of experience, both physical and logical, with the objects themselves and how they are acted upon. Thus, knowledge must be assimilated in an active process by a learner with matured mental capacity, so that knowledge can build in complexity by scaffolded understanding. Understanding is scaffolded by the learner through the process of equilibration, whereby the learner balances new knowledge with previous understanding, thereby compensating for "transformation" of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Piaget"/&gt;

Learning, then, can also be supported by instructors in an educational setting. Piaget specified that knowledge cannot truly be formed until the learner has matured the mental structures to which that learning is specific, and thereby development constrains learning. Nevertheless, knowledge can also be "built" by building on simpler operations and structures that have already been formed. Basing operations of an advanced structure on those of simpler structures thus scaffolds learning to build on operational abilities as they develop. Good teaching, then, is built around the operational abilities of the students such that they can excel in their operational stage and build on preexisting structures and abilities and thereby "build" learning.&lt;ref name="Piaget"/&gt;

Evidence of the effectiveness of a contemporary curricular design building on Piaget's theories of developmental progression and the support of maturing mental structures can be seen in Griffin and Case's "Number Worlds" curriculum.&lt;ref name="Number Worlds"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Griffin | first1 = S.A. | year = 2004 | title = Building number sense with Number Worlds: a mathematics program for young children | journal = Early Childhood Research Quarterly | volume = 19 |  pages = 173–180 | doi=10.1016/j.ecresq.2004.01.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The curriculum works toward building a "central conceptual structure" of number sense in young children by building on five instructional processes, including aligning curriculum to the developmental sequencing of acquisition of specific skills. By outlining the developmental sequence of number sense, a conceptual structure is built and aligned to individual children as they develop.

=== Morality ===
Piaget believed in two basic principles relating to [[moral education]]: that children develop moral ideas in stages and that children create their conceptions of the world. According to Piaget, "the child is someone who constructs his own moral world view, who forms ideas about right and wrong, and fair and unfair, that are not the direct product of adult teaching and that are often maintained in the face of adult wishes to the contrary" (Gallagher, 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;26). Piaget believed that children made moral judgments based on their own observations of the world.

Piaget's theory of [[morality]] was radical when his book ''[[The Moral Judgment of the Child]]'' was published in 1932 for two reasons: his use of philosophical criteria to define morality (as universalizable, generalizable, and obligatory) and his rejection of equating [[Norm (sociology)|cultural norms]] with moral norms. Piaget, drawing on [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] theory, proposed that morality developed out of peer interaction and that it was autonomous from authority mandates. Peers, not parents, were a key source of moral concepts such as equality, reciprocity, and justice.

Piaget attributed different types of psychosocial processes to different forms of social [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]], introducing a fundamental distinction between different types of said relationships. Where there is constraint because one participant holds more power than the other the relationship is [[asymmetrical]], and, importantly, the [[knowledge]] that can be acquired by the dominated participant takes on a fixed and inflexible form. Piaget refers to this process as one of social transmission, illustrating it through reference to the way in which the elders of a [[tribe]] initiate younger members into the patterns of beliefs and practices of the group. Similarly, where adults exercise a dominating influence over the growing child, it is through social transmission that children can acquire knowledge. By contrast, in [[cooperative]] relations, power is more evenly distributed between participants so that a more symmetrical relationship emerges. Under these conditions, authentic forms of intellectual exchange become possible; each partner has the freedom to project his or her own thoughts, consider the positions of others, and defend his or her own point of view. In such circumstances, where children’s thinking is not limited by a dominant influence, Piaget believed "the reconstruction of knowledge", or favorable conditions for the emergence of constructive solutions to problems, exists. Here the knowledge that emerges is open, flexible and regulated by the logic of argument rather than being determined by an external authority.

In short, cooperative relations provide the arena for the emergence of operations, which for Piaget requires the absence of any constraining influence, and is most often illustrated by the relations that form between peers (for more on the importance of this distinction see Duveen &amp; Psaltis, 2008; Psaltis &amp; Duveen, 2006, 2007). This is thus how, according to Piaget, children learn ''moral judgement'' as opposed to ''cultural norms'' (or maybe [[ideology|ideological]] norms).

=== Historical studies of thought and cognition ===
Historical changes of thought have been modeled in Piagetian terms. Broadly speaking these models have mapped changes in morality, intellectual life and cognitive levels against historical changes (typically in the complexity of social systems).

Notable examples include:

*[[Jürgen Habermas]]'s reworking of [[historical materialism]].

=== Non-human development ===
Neo-Piagetian stages have been applied to the maximum stage attained by various animals. For example, [[spider]]s attain the circular sensory motor stage, coordinating actions and perceptions. [[Pigeon]]s attain the sensory motor stage, forming concepts.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

===Origins===
The origins of human intelligence have also been studied in Piagetian terms. Wynn (1979, 1981) analysed [[Acheulian]] and [[Oldowan]] tools in terms of the insight into spatial relationships required to create each kind. On a more general level, Robinson's [http://www.prometheus.org.uk ''Birth of Reason''] (2005) suggests a large-scale model for the emergence of a Piagetian intelligence.

=== Primatology ===
Piaget's models of cognition have also been applied outside the human sphere, and some primatologists assess the development and abilities of primates in terms of Piaget's model.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8018-6012-1"&gt;{{cite book |author1=McKinney, Michael L. |author2=Parker, Sue Taylor |title=Origins of intelligence: the evolution of cognitive development in monkeys, apes, and humans |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |year=1999 |isbn=0-8018-6012-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philosophy ===
Philosophers have used Piaget's work. For example, the [[philosopher]] and [[social theorist]] [[Jürgen Habermas]] has incorporated Piaget into his work, most notably in ''[[The Theory of Communicative Action]].'' The philosopher [[Thomas Kuhn]] credited Piaget's work with helping him to understand the transition between modes of thought which characterized his theory of [[paradigm shift]]s.&lt;ref name="Burman, J. T. 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0959354307079306 | last1 = Burman | first1 = J. T. | year = 2007 | title = Piaget No 'Remedy' for Kuhn, But the Two Should be Read Together: Comment on Tsou's 'Piaget vs. Kuhn on Scientific Progress' | journal = Theory &amp; Psychology | volume = 17 | issue = 5| pages = 721–732 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, that said, it is also noted that the implications of his later work do indeed remain largely unexamined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burman | first1 = J. T. | year = 2008 | title = Experimenting in relation to Piaget: Education is a chaperoned process of adaptation | journal = Perspectives on Science | volume = 16 | issue = 2| pages = 160–195 | doi = 10.1162/posc.2008.16.2.160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before his death (September 1980), Piaget was involved in a debate about the relationships between innate and acquired features of language, at the Centre Royaumont pour une Science de l'Homme, where he discussed his point of view with the linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] as well as [[Hilary Putnam]] and [[Stephen Toulmin]].

=== Artificial intelligence ===
Piaget also had a considerable effect in the field of [[computer science]] and [[artificial intelligence]].  [[Seymour Papert]] used Piaget's work while developing the [[Logo programming language]]. [[Alan Kay]] used Piaget's theories as the basis for the [[Dynabook]] programming system concept, which was first discussed within the confines of the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center ([[Xerox PARC]]). These discussions led to the development of the [[Alto (computer)|Alto]] prototype, which explored for the first time all the elements of the [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), and influenced the creation of user interfaces in the 1980s and beyond.&lt;ref name="isbn978-0262041201"&gt;{{cite book |author=Drescher, Gary |title=Made-Up Minds: A Constructivist Approach to Artificial Intelligence |publisher=MIT Press |location=Boston |year=1991 |page=236 |isbn=978-0-262-04120-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
Piaget's theory, however vital in understanding child psychology, did not go without scrutiny. A main figure whose ideas contradicted Piaget's ideas was the Russian psychologist [[Lev Vygotsky]]. Vygotsky stressed the importance of a child's cultural background as an effect to the stages of development. Because different cultures stress different social interactions, this challenged Piaget's theory that the hierarchy of learning development had to develop in succession. Vygotsky introduced the term [[Zone of proximal development]] as an overall task a child would have to develop that would be too difficult to develop alone.

Also, the so-called [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]] maintained that Piaget's theory does not do justice either to the underlying mechanisms of [[information processing]] that explain transition from stage to stage or [[individual differences]] in cognitive development. According to these theories, changes in information processing mechanisms, such as [[speed of processing]] and [[working memory]], are responsible for ascension from stage to stage. Moreover, differences between individuals in these processes explain why some individuals develop faster than other individuals ([[Demetriou]], 1998).

Over time, alternative theories of Child Development have been put forward, and empirical findings have done a lot to undermine Piaget's theories. For example, Esther Thelen and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Spencer | first1 = J. P. | last2 = Clearfield | first2 = M. | last3 = Corbetta | first3 = D. | last4 = Ulrich | first4 = B. | last5 = Buchanan | first5 = P. | last6 = Schöner | first6 = G. | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2006.00955.x | title = Moving Toward a Grand Theory of Development: In Memory of Esther Thelen | journal = Child Development | volume = 77 | issue = 6 | pages = 1521–1538 | year = 2006 | pmid =  17107442| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that babies would not make the [[A-not-B error]] if they had small weights added to their arms during the first phase of the experiment that were then removed before the second phase of the experiment. This minor change should not impact babies' understanding of object permanence, so the difference that this makes to babies' performance on the A-not-B task cannot be explained by Piagetian theory. Thelen and colleagues also found that various other factors also influenced performance on the A-not-B task (including strength of memory trace, salience of targets, waiting time and stance), and proposed that this could be better explained using a [[dynamic systems theory]] approach than using Piagetian theory. [[Alison Gopnik]] and Betty Repacholi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Early reasoning about desires: Evidence from 14- and 18-month-olds | journal = Developmental Psychology | year = 1997 | first = Betty | last = Repacholi |author2=Alison Gopnik | volume = 3 | pages = 12–21| doi=10.1037/0012-1649.33.1.12}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that babies as young as 18 months old can understand that other people have desires, and that these desires could be very different from their own desires. This strongly contradicts Piaget's view that children are very egocentric at this age. In reaction to these challenges, it has been argued that their criticisms depend on a fundamental misreading of Piaget's theory.&lt;ref name=lm/&gt;

'''Kolab Now''' is a [[web-based email]] and [[groupware]] service, based completely on [[Free software|free]] and [[Open-source software|open-source]] software. It is owned and operated by Kolab Systems AG and was formerly known as MyKolab.

==Kolab==
Kolab Systems AG is the company behind the [[Kolab]] groupware suite. Founded in 2010 in Zürich, Switzerland, Kolab Systems has taken the place of the Kolab Konsortium which initially provided Kolab services primarily in German speaking areas from 2004 to 2010. It is also the largest contributor to the [[Roundcube]] web mailer project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://roundcubeinbox.wordpress.com/2013/03/11/the-kolab-story/|title=The Kolab story|work=The Roundcube Inbox}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's board of directors is composed of CEO [[Georg C. F. Greve|Georg Greve]], the founding president of [[Free Software Foundation Europe]], CTO Jeroen van Meeuwen, Michael Moser, CCO and co-founder of Switzerlands leading Open Source Integrator Adfinis-SyGroup AG, and Philipp Koch, co-founder of Swiss hosting company Nine.ch.

==Background==
Kolab Now, under the original name "MyKolab", was launched in January 2013 as a public [[beta release]] and became fully available later that year in August 1, as a paid service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kolab.org/blog/greve/2013/08/09/mykolab.com-building-open-source-cloud-service-was-missing|title=MyKolab.com: Building the Open Source Cloud service that was missing|work=kolab.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After documents detailing United States and British government [[mass surveillance]] programs like [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] and [[Tempora]] were leaked by [[Edward Snowden]] in May 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/edward-snowden-says-motive-behind-leaks-was-to-expose-surveillance-state/2013/06/09/aa3f0804-d13b-11e2-a73e-826d299ff459_story.html?tid=pm_politics_pop|title=Edward Snowden says motive behind leaks was to expose ‘surveillance state’|author=Barton Gellman|date=10 June 2013|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/intelligence-leaders-push-back-on-leakers-media/2013/06/09/fff80160-d122-11e2-a73e-826d299ff459_story.html|title=Edward Snowden comes forward as source of NSA leaks|author=Barton Gellman|date=9 June 2013|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; US-based companies [[Lavabit]] and [[Silent Circle (software)|Silent Circle]], under pressure of government agencies, decided to shut down their email services rather than run the risk of having to disclose personal data of their users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lavabit.com|title=Lavabit|author=Ladar Levison|work=lavabit.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://silentcircle.wordpress.com/2013/08/09/to-our-customers/|title=To Our Customers|work=Silent Circle Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, [[Pamela Jones]], author of now-defunct legal site [[Groklaw]], revealed her use of MyKolab in her farewell post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20130818120421175|title=Groklaw - Forced Exposure ~pj|work=groklaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones' endorsement increased demand for MyKolab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kolabnow.com/news/after-groklaw-shutdown-mykolab-lavabit-alternative-offering-lite-option|title=After Groklaw shutdown: MyKolab as Lavabit alternative, offering Lite option|work=kolabnow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based outside of the United States, Kolab Systems received media attention as one of the few and most secure alternatives still in operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/why-kolab-might-be-the-best-secure-email-service-still-1171618005|title=Why Kolab Might Be the Best Secure Email Service Still Standing|author=Adam Clark Estes|publisher=Gawker Media|work=Gizmodo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Privacy of customer data==
Hosted in Switzerland, Kolab Now claims the benefit of strict privacy laws; it uses exclusively free or open source software, guaranteeing transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kolabsys.com/news/no-foreign-data-reeves-privacy-respecting-email-service-mykolabcom-launched|title=Kolab Systems AG|work=kolabsys.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the service is subject to the national laws of Switzerland, Kolab Now states that there will be no access to a user's data by third parties without a duly authorized warrant issued by a Swiss judge.&lt;ref name="kolabnow.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://KolabNow.com/tos|title=Terms of Service|work=kolabnow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also stated in the terms of service that only the minimum of logs, necessary for [[debugging]] and improvement of the service, is kept.&lt;ref name="kolabnow.com"/&gt;

===Requests from government agencies===
Like any company, Kolab Now can be obliged to provide access to [[lawful interception]] requests.  However, the Swiss authorities are generally reluctant to make such requests for access, and the government publishes anonymised statistics of all such lawful interceptions along with the rationale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.li.admin.ch/en/themes/stats.html|title=Statistics|work=admin.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1 September 2015, Kolab Now reports having granted only one request from a government agency for data concerning a customer,&lt;ref name="privacy stats"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kolabnow.com/privacy/statistics|title=Lawful Access Statistics|work=kolabnow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they note that this was an "administrative request", i.e. a request for information ''about'' a customer rather than a request for access to the customer's data.  Kolab Now received two further requests but denied them because they came from an agency with no jurisdiction in Switzerland (both were from U.S. local police).&lt;ref name="privacy stats" /&gt;

In 2012, in all of Switzerland, there were only 20 cases of real-time internet wire-tapping and a further 26 for retroactive communication meta-information.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.li.admin.ch/download/stats_2012.xlsx&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Swiss intelligence agencies|Swiss Federal Intelligence Service]] traditionally have no mandate to operate within the country. A controversial revision of the law, effective 1st September 2017, has recently given them wider license, in particular wholesale monitoring of cross-border traffic. According to Kolab Now, not much will change for its customers, however. (&lt;ref name="surveillance law"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kolabnow.com/news/comment-revised-secret-service-law|title=Comment on the Revised Secret Service Law|work=kolabnow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Email encryption==

Kolab Now chose not to provide server-side encryption, and recommends using [[Kontact]] or [[Mozilla Thunderbird]] with [[Enigmail]] for proper end-to-end encryption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://KolabNow.com/faq#encryption|title=FAQ|work=kolabnow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With server-side encryption, the encrypted data, the key, and the passphrase would need to pass through the web interface and be available on the server.  Holding all three, the provider would have access to all the data despite the encryption.

==Account types==
Kolab Now offers 2 types of accounts: Individual and Group manager accounts.&lt;ref name="kolabnow.com1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://KolabNow.com/pricing|title=Pricing|work=kolabnow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individual account===
It is aimed at the individual who wishes a more secure and private alternative to free email services, with full groupware functionality. There's the option of a Lite&lt;ref name="kolabsys.com"/&gt; version, which offers the email service only and do not include the groupware synchronisation feature. Standard storage size for this account type ranges from 2 up to 100&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kolabsys.com/news/mykolabcom-receives-best-grade-user-friendliness-offers-more-storage# | title=MyKolab.com: Receives best grade for user friendliness, offers more storage | author=Kolab Systems AG}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gigabyte|GB]], with cost incurring accordingly.

===Group Manager account===
This account type provides the customer with an administration login, used purely to set up the actual groupware account within a domain under the customer's control, and to administrate users existing within that domain. It is also possible to use an own [[SSL Certificate]] for that domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://KolabNow.com/support/account#domains|title=Account Management|work=kolabnow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cost is incurred per user in a similar fashion to the individual accounts.

==Features==

===Synchronisation with mobile devices===
The ActiveSync option allows to synchronize emails, contacts, events and tasks from Kolab Now to a mobile device. This works with all devices that support ActiveSync, such as Android, iPhone or Blackberry Z10. Alternatively, it is possible to use [[CalDAV]] and [[CardDAV]] capable clients to synchronise data.

===Native desktop client for all platforms===
The Kolab Client runs on all modern operating systems such as Linux, Windows and MacOS. It supports different applications such as Mail, Address Books, Calendars, ToDo Management, Journals, Notes and offers many detailed features for each of them. It is based on [[Kontact]] and uses the [[Qt (software)|Qt]] Technology to be fully portable.

===Server-side mail filtering===
It is possible to define the criteria for emails to be filtered into different mail folders. The filtering will happen on the server right after the mail is received. This way emails are the same on all devices. Users can edit the filters as [[Sieve (mail filtering language)|SIEVE]] scripts directly.

===Free/Busy Information for Planning===
Allows to see whether the participants of events are free or busy without revealing any information about what they are doing during these times. This allows to schedule appointments and ensure that everybody is able to participate.

Other available features:

* Threaded mailview
* Task management
* File storage
* Customisable webclient
* Set up multiple identities
* Multiple calendar folders and views

==Payment and pricing==
Kolab Now currently supports [[PayPal]] and [[Bitcoin]] as well as credit card as payment methods for monthly subscriptions and [[wire transfer]] for yearly payments only.  The current monthly price for individual accounts with standard groupware functionality is 8.99 [[Swiss franc|CHF]], and for the email-only version, 4.55 [[Swiss franc|CHF]].&lt;ref name="kolabnow.com1"/&gt;

[[File:Olav den helliges saga CK5.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Torgny the Lawspeaker]] showing the power of his office to the king of Sweden at [[Gamla Uppsala]], 1018. The lawspeaker forced king [[Olof Skötkonung]] not only to accept peace with his enemy, king [[Olaf II of Norway|Olaf the Stout]] of Norway, but also to give his daughter to him in marriage.

A '''lawspeaker''' or '''lawman''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: ''lagman'', [[Old Swedish]]: ''laghmaþer'' or ''laghman'', [[Danish language|Danish]]: ''lovsigemand'', [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''lagmann'', [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]: ''lög(sögu)maður'', [[Faroese language|Faroese]]: ''[[løgmaður]]'', [[Finnish language|Finnish]]: ''laamanni'') is a unique [[Scandinavia]]n legal office. It has its basis in a common Germanic [[oral tradition]], where wise people were asked to recite the law, but it was only in Scandinavia that the function evolved into an office. Two of the most famous lawspeakers are [[Snorri Sturluson]] and [[Torgny the Lawspeaker]].

==Sweden==
In [[Sweden]], this office was the most important one of regional governments, where each  ''lagsaga'' (usually the same as the [[Provinces of Sweden|traditional province]]) was the [[jurisdiction]] of a lawspeaker who was subordinate to the lawspeaker of [[Tiundaland]]. The lawspeaker presided over the [[thing (assembly)|things]], worked as a judge and formulated the laws that had been decided by the people. The lawspeaker was obliged to memorize the law and to recite it at the [[thing (assembly)|thing]]. He was also responsible for the administration at the thing and for the execution of the decisions, and it was his duty to safeguard the rights and liberties of the people and to speak in their behalf to the king or his representative. It was the lawspeaker who, on the behalf of the people, recognized the elected king when he passed on the [[Eriksgata]]. However, after the establishment of the province laws, ca 1350, he would participate at the [[Stone of Mora]] with twelve companions from his jurisdiction.

According to the [[Westrogothic law]], the lawspeaker was appointed for life by the [[yeomen]] (''bönder'') of the province from among their number; it was also stipulated that his father should also have been an landowner.&lt;ref name=larsson /&gt;{{rp|pages= 411–27 (pp. 414–15)}} The office was not hereditary, but he was usually selected from the more powerful families.

The first named Swedish lawspeaker, if the text is correct, is the Lum recorded in a register of [[Västergötland]] lawmen copied by Laurentius Dyakn, a priest in [[Vidhem]], in the 1320s; he must have lived around 1000. The first Swedish lawspeaker for whom we have substantial biographical information is [[Eskil (Lawman)|Eskil]] (c. 1175-1227), the seventeenth in Laurentius's list.&lt;ref name=larsson /&gt;{{rp|pages=411–27 (pp. 411–12)}} From the mid-13th century and onwards, the lawspeakers became more attached to the king, and it was common that lawspeakers were members of the king's council. King [[Magnus IV of Sweden|Magnus Eriksson]] decided that the king would influence the appointment of the lawspeakers. Six nobles and six yeomen would in consultation with two clergymen appoint three men from the jurisdiction among whom the king would select the one he deemed to be most fit. This procedure would be in effect until the 16th century when the whole process of selection was transferred to the king.

From then on, the lawspeakers only came from the nobility, and it had turned into a pension, in which a member of the [[Privy Council of Sweden]] was selected and received a salary, but had other people taking care of the work. This privilege was abolished during the [[Reduction (Sweden)|Reduction of 1680]], after which the lawspeakers were obliged to take care of the work themselves, and there were checks on the appointment of members of the privy council. Still, the appointment remained restricted to noblemen until 1723.

By then, the functions of the office had become restricted to that of a judge, a function which also became less important by time. In 1849, the office was abolished, but the title remained occasionally in use as a title of honour for governors.

In 1947, the title of ''lagman'' (pl. ''lagmän'') was reintroduced for senior judges, namely the presidents of divisions of the courts of appeal. Since reform in 1969, presidents of the district courts (''tingsrätter'') are ''lagmän'', while presidents of divisions of the courts of appeal are ''hovrättslagmän'' ("court of appeal lawspeakers"). Correspondingly, presidents of the district administrative courts (''förvaltningsrätter'') also carry the title of ''lagman'' and presidents of divisions of the administrative courts of appeal are ''kammarrättslagmän'' ("administrative court of appeal lawspeakers").

== Finland ==
Finland being governed by Swedish law wholly until 1809, the events were the same as in Sweden. However, the ''lagman'' offices were terminated and ''lagman'' became an honorific title only in 1868 (at that time laws were published also in Finnish and thus also the term ''laamanni'' official). In the 1993 reform, ''laamanni'' and ''lagman'' were reintroduced as the title of the chief judge of a [[Judicial system of Finland#District Courts|district court]] or a senior judge in a court of appeal.

==Norway==
In [[Norway]], the lawspeakers remained counselors versed in the law until king [[Sverre I of Norway]] (1184–1202) made them into his officials.  In the laws of [[Magnus VI of Norway]] (1263–80), they were given the right to function as judges and to preside at the [[lagting (disambiguation)|lagtings]] (the Norwegian superior courts). Modern historians regard the lawspeakers in ancient times (especially before around 1600), of which there were 10–12 in the entire kingdom, as part of the [[nobility]]. In the 14th and 15th centuries they were usually recruited from the existing higher nobility, with some holding the rank of knight, the highest rank of nobility in the kingdom. In the 16h century they were still usually recruited from the existing nobility, albeit more often from the lower nobility. Lawspeakers received fiefs. For example, Marker fief was by tradition held by the lawspeaker of Oslo. They were also treated as equal to the nobility on formal occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Tor Weidling: "Perspektiver på adelen i Norge ved utgangen av middelalderen og på 1500-tallet" (p. 61). In Tore Hermundsson Vigerust (ed.), ''Benkestokk-seminaret'', Oslo: Kane.benkestokk.teiste forlag, 1999, {{ISBN|8291870020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical lagtings and the office of lawspeaker were abolished in 1797, but the title was reinstituted in 1887 together with the introduction of the [[jury]] system.

==Iceland==
In [[Iceland]], the office was introduced in 930, when the [[Althing]] was established. He was elected for three years. Besides his function as the president of the thing, his duties were restricted to counselling and to reciting the law. It was the sole government office of the mediaeval [[Icelandic Commonwealth]]. The lawspeaker was elected for a term of three years and was supposed to declaim the law at the Althing, a third of it each summer. In fact, Grímr Svertingsson's term was cut short, not because of incompetence or illness, but because his voice was too weak for the job. Apart from his function as a lawsayer and chairman of the court, the ''lǫgsǫgumaðr'' had no formal power, but he would often be appointed as an arbitrator in the frequently arising disputes. The office lingered on for a few years in the transitional period after 1262, after which it was replaced with a ''lǫgmaðr''. The traditional date for the founding of the Althing is 930 with [[Úlfljótr]] appearing as a founding figure and the original author of the laws. After the union with [[Norway]] in 1264, two royal lawspeakers were appointed who had an important influence on the legal processes at the thing. The office was abolished together with the Althing in 1800.

===List of Icelandic lawspeakers===
Scholars are suspicious of the fact that Úlfljótur's first two successors have been assigned a period in office of exactly 20 summers each, but from ''Þorkell máni'' on, the chronology is probably correct; names are given in their modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] form.

'''''Liō''''' is a daily [[comic strip]] created by American artist [[Mark Tatulli]] and distributed by the [[Universal Press Syndicate]] since May 15, 2006. As a [[pantomime comics|pantomime strip]], it has an international appeal. In 2008, the strip brought Tatulli a [[National Cartoonists Society]] Newspaper Comic Strip Award.

==Characters and story==
The strip focuses on the adventures of a creative little boy, Liō, who lives with his father (unnamed in the strip) and various monsters, animals, aliens, lab creations, and other creatures. Liō's mother is deceased.&lt;ref name="xmaseve"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/lio/2009/12/24/ |title=Strip for December 24, 2009 |publisher=Gocomics.com |accessdate=December 24, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5o0aOq9MM?url=http://www.gocomics.com/lio/2009/12/24/ |archivedate=March 5, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently unknown how she died.  The setting of the story varies from Liō's house to his school and the general outside world. The time period appears to be contemporary, except for an episode set in the year 2101, when Liō is in his nineties but still very much capable of mischief.

The story is told visually, with little or no dialogue. Gags frequently involve the supernatural, alien invasion or mass destruction of many sorts, creating a surreal, disturbing atmosphere. Some of the strip's recurring themes involve Liō getting even with grade-school bullies, helping animals (most of which are non-anthropomorphic but display obvious intelligence) defend themselves against humans or their predators, and performing [[mad scientist]] style experiments.  He is often seen using robots that he constructs himself for causing mischief. Another recurring gag in the strip is parody of other famous comic strips, including ''[[Cathy (comic strip)|Cathy]]'', ''[[For Better or For Worse]]'', ''[[Garfield]]'', ''[[Zits (comics)|Zits]]'', ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]'', ''[[Blondie (comic strip)|Blondie]]'', ''[[Peanuts]]'', ''[[Pearls Before Swine (comic strip)|Pearls Before Swine]]'', ''[[The Family Circus]]'' and [[Berkeley Breathed]]'s strips.

In addition to Liō, the strip only has one other major character, Liō's unnamed father. He is frequently shown to be the subject of Liō's pranks, and sometimes he has to get his son out of difficult situations. When he watched a news report of an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] invasion, he gave Liō a spanking for apparently having piloted the alien ship and parking it in the backyard (dated at 2007/02/09). On the other hand, one day when the boy came home from school dejected because a drawing he created had horrified the faculty, Dad proudly hung up the piece of art on the refrigerator, giving his son much-needed comfort and joy (dated 2009/03/15). Quite often, father and son prove that they really love each other, no matter what.&lt;ref name=xmaseve /&gt;

Liō has at least five companion animals: 
*Fido, a spider who has helped him cheat on tests.
*Cybil, a white cat who has unique methods for getting Liō to feed her. She looks sweet and innocent but is not. She also has an affinity for gin.
*Frank, a cobra who sometimes sleeps in Liō's bed.
*Ishmael, a giant squid, mainly identified as a [[cephalopod]].
*Mittens, a lobster rescued from his father's planned dinner.

There are several frequently recurring characters:
*Liō's hunchbacked assistant.
*His grade-school teacher Mrs. Gatchi.
*A group of school bullies.
*Assorted mythical monsters (both alive and undead).
*Assorted aliens.
*Various lab creations (some alive, some robots).
*Eva Rose, a violent girl with bangs that cover her eyes and an interest in surgeries and autopsies. Liō has a crush on her.  She does not return the feeling and is often quite violent towards him or his expressions of love. This does not sway Liō in the slightest, except maybe to make him even more determined in his quest to win her love.
*Bubbles, Liō's wide-eyed infant cousin who is scared of nothing and comes up with devious plots.
*The monsters under the bed.
*Hunters.
*Archie, Liō's psychopathic [[Ventriloquism#Ventriloquist.27s_dummy|ventriloquist's dummy]].
*Liō's grandmom.

==Style==
While it may seem that all the strips are from Liō's imagination, Tatulli has stated that all events in the strip actually happen to Liō, (Although on the back cover of an [[AMP! Kids]] Liō book, There's a monster in my socks, they say all the monsters and robots are from his imagination.) &lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amuniversal.com/ups/features/lio/tatulli_interview.htm|title=Q&amp;A with Mark Tatulli on Liō from Universal Press Syndicate website|accessdate=2006-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; though most of the time others turn a blind eye to it, unlike the other-worldly situations in ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]''.

Another notable aspect of ''Liō'' (reminiscent of such strips as ''[[The Little King]]'', ''[[Henry (comic)|Henry]]'' and ''[[Ferd'nand]]'') is its general lack of dialogue, though there are occasional vocalizations (such as "Eeck!" or "Aggh!") and there are labels on certain objects to make the gags more obvious. One-time characters have sometimes spoken, and characters in some of the parodies have had dialogue even when Liō himself is silent.

Tatulli has credited [[Gahan Wilson]], [[Charles Addams]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/lio/bio.phtml |title=Interview with Mark Tatulli on gocomics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[U.S. Civil War]] era [[caricaturist]] [[Adalbert J. Volck]] as influences on the visual style of ''Liō''.&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt;

==Distribution==
The strip debuted on May 15, 2006 in more than 100 newspapers which included ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'', ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'', ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'', ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'', ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Denver's ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'', ''[[Raleigh News and Observer]]'', ''[[The Seattle Times]]'', ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]''. The strip is mostly wordless, therefore it can easily be marketed worldwide; one paper, ''[[De Morgen]]'', a [[Brussels]]-based [[Flemish language|Flemish]] newspaper, introduced the strip on the day it debuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amuniversal.com/ups/newsrelease/?view=325|title=Liō Starts May 15|accessdate=2006-07-26|date=2006-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
As of August 2007, ''Liō'' runs in more than 330 newspapers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/departments/syndicates/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003622436|title='Lio' Pantomime Comic Is Doing Well in Asia|accessdate=2007-08-14|date=2007-08-07}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
An October 23, 2007 article in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' revealed that the strip had been optioned for a live-action feature film by producer David Kirschner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117974581.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 | work=Variety | title=Dark 'Lio' leaps to screen | first=Michael | last=Fleming | date=October 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
But as of 2017 there has been no word if the film started production.

'''Michael Edward Stone''' (born 22 October 1938) is a professor emeritus of [[Armenian Studies]] and of [[Comparative religion|Comparative Religion]] at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. He is also a published poet.

==Biography==
Michael Stone was born in [[Leeds]], [[England]] in 1938. In 1941 his family moved to [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], where he was raised. He earned a bachelor's degree from the [[University of Melbourne]] in [[Semitic studies|Semitic Studies]] and the [[Classics]] during the years 1956–1960. He immigrated to [[Israel]] in 1960. His father, Julius Stone, was a professor of International Law at the University of Sydney and the first chairman of the Truman Institute at the Hebrew University.

After a year-long acclimation program at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem|Hebrew University]] (1960–61), Stone transferred to [[Harvard University]] in the United States and there completed a doctorate under Professor [[Frank Moore Cross|Frank M. Cross]] in the Department of Near Eastern Languages during the years 1961–65. His doctorate addressed the conception of [[eschatology]] in 4 Ezra. Afterwards he became a lecturer in Comparative Religion at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]. In 1966 he returned to Israel, became a lecturer in Comparative Religion at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and in the following year became an associate professor. In 1980 he became a full professor of Armenian Studies and was named as the Gail Levin de Nur Professor of Religious Studies. In 2007 he retired from the Hebrew University, where he continues his research and lecturing as a professor emeritus.

Stone held many visiting research and professorial positions at academic institutions worldwide. He was (according to chronology) assistant professor of religious studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara (1965–66), lecturer in Jewish studies and Armenian studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (1966–69), senior lecturer in the same (1969–76), visiting research fellow at Harvard University (1971–72), George Scott Fellow at Ormond College of the University of Melbourne (summer of 1974), visiting member of the Theological Faculty at [[Leiden University]] (summer of 1975), associate professor at the Hebrew University (1976–80), the Berg Professor of Judaic Studies (1977–78) and the Tarzian Adjunct Professor of Armenian History and Culture at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (1977–83), fellow-in-residence (1980–81) and visiting scholar (autumn of 1984) at the [[Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study|Netherlands Institute for Advanced Studies]], distinguished visiting professor at the University of Pennsylvania (summer 1985), visiting scholar at the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Studies (summer of 1986), distinguished visiting fellow at Ormond College of the University of Melbourne (spring of 1988), visiting professor of Jewish studies at Harvard Divinity School (fall of 1989), visiting professor at [[Yale University]] (autumn of 1991), Distinguished NEH Visiting professor at the [[University of Richmond]] (spring 1993), visiting professor of religious studies at the [[University of Virginia]] (1993), fellow-in-residence and the director of a research group on translation techniques at the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Studies (1997–98), visiting professor of New Testament and Judaic studies at Harvard University (autumn of 2001), distinguished senior visiting fellow in the Kluge Center of the [[Library of Congress]] (autumn 2003), the Sugden Distinguished Visiting fellow at Queen’s College of the University of Melbourne (summer of 2004), and distinguished visiting professor of Judaic studies at the [[University of North Carolina at Charlotte]] (2006–07).

He is a member of the editorial board of the journal, [[Revue des Études Arméniennes]] (Paris), served as a member of the scientific board of [[Patma-Banasirakan Handes|Patmabanasirakan Handes]] (Erevan) and as a member of the editorial board of Dead Sea Discoveries. He is a founder of the Society of Biblical Literature Pseudepigrapha Group (USA) and was a member of the steering committee.

He married Nira Weintraub in 1961. She was a scholar in the history of Byzantine and Armenian art, a field in which she taught for many years at the Hebrew University. They have two children and six grandchildren. Nira died in the summer of 2013.

Stone has written and published many poems in English, and he is a member of the Israel Association of Writers in English.

==Research==
Michael Stone is first and foremost a historian of religious thought. His research focuses on two fields: Jewish thought and literature of the [[Second Temple period]] including its transmission into the [[History of Jerusalem during the Middle Ages|Middle Ages]]; and [[Armenian studies|Armenian Studies]]. His work emphasizes texts and their interpretations but extends beyond a narrow textual focus to ideological analysis within religious and intellectual history.

==Armenian Studies==
Credited with “single-handedly pioneer[ing] the study of the Armenian language, literature and history,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Things Revealed: Studies in Early Jewish and Christian Literature in Honor of Michael E. Stone |editor1-first=Esther |editor1-last=Chazon |editor2-first=David |editor2-last=Satran |editor3-first=Ruth |editor3-last=Clemens |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden, Boston |year=2004 |page=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone’s research has focused on several topics within this subject:

===Jewish literature translated into Armenian: reception, redesign, and the transmission of Jewish and biblical stories and traditions by the Armenian people===
Stone has published several books dealing with Jewish literature translated to Armenian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Testament of Levi: A First Study of the Armenian Manuscripts of the Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs in the Convent of St. James, Jerusalem |location=Jerusalem |publisher=St. James Press |date=1969}} {{cite book |title=Concordance and Texts of Armenian IV Ezra |location=Jerusalem |publisher=Israel Oriental Society |date=1971}} {{cite book |title=The Armenian Version of the Testament of Joseph: Introduction, Critical Edition, and Translation |location=Missoula |publisher=Scholars Press |date=1975}} {{cite book |title=The Armenian Version of IV Ezra |location=Missoula |publisher=Scholars Press |date=1979}} {{cite book |title=The Penitence of Adam |location=Leuven |publisher=Peeters |date=1981}} {{cite book |title=Textual Commentary on the Armenian Version of IV Ezra |location=Atlanta |publisher=Scholars Press |date=1990}} {{cite book |title=Selected Studies in Pseudepigrapha and Apocrypha with Special Reference to the Armenian Tradition |location=Leiden |publisher=Brill |date=1991}} {{cite book |author=With S. Ajamian |title=Text and Context. Studies in the Armenian New Testament. Papers Presented to the Conference on the Armenian New Testament, May 22-28, 1992 |location=Atlanta |publisher=Scholars Press |date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, The Armenian Version of 4 Ezra,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Armenian Version of IV Ezra |location=Missoula |publisher=Scholars Press |date=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone published the first full critical edition of any text connected with the Armenian biblical canon. Following its publication, Stone produced several volumes of texts and exegesis addressing biblical or Jewish traditions. These volumes contain manuscript texts edited anew including the first editions of documents that were beforehand unknown. In this vein, many of Stone’s articles are dedicated to the publication of texts, and in so doing he established a wide body of texts that were important both for Armenian and [[Pseudepigrapha]] Studies.

He published the first edition of the Armenian version of the Armenian Adam book, The Penitence of Adam in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Penitence of Adam |location=Leuven |publisher=Peeters |date=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; In so doing, he initiated long-term research on the [[Deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical]] books dealing with [[Adam and Eve]], which he collected over the past decade. He published concordances of Armenian deuterocanonical literature about Adam (1996, 2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Armenian Apocrypha Relating to Adam and Eve |location=Leiden |publisher=Brill |date=1996}} {{cite book |title=A Concordance of the Armenian Apocryphal Adam Books |location=Leuven |publisher=Peeters |date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and additional literature related to Armenians and other Adam traditions (mentioned below).

===Armenian deuterocanonical literature===
With these publications Stone initiated a new field of study and research: deuterocanonical literature in Armenian, which is the transmission of biblical and Jewish traditions in Armenian. In so doing he had lasting influence on Armenian Studies as well as the study of deuterocanonical literature. In recent years he has focused on the way in which these traditions function within the Armenian culture and how their transformation reflects changes in the religious and intellectual history of the Armenian nation. He presents diachronic questions that were never before posed and traces shifts of religious, intellectual, and cultural history that were hardly addressed. These questions touch on understanding the human condition and existential purpose. Furthermore, the diachronic research of entire traditions highlights changes that occurred in Armenian thought throughout generations and ties them to Armenian history, politics, religion, and thought. Here he attends to ancient Jewish elements in Armenian culture.

===Armenian paleography and history in Israel===
Stone’s interest in Armenian manuscripts led him to study the [[Armenian alphabet|Armenian script]]. He published a number of technical descriptions of manuscripts and co-published with Dr. Nira Stone the Catalogue of the New Armenian Manuscripts in the [[Chester Beatty Library]], [[Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=With Nira Stone |title=Catalogue of the Additional Armenian Manuscripts in the Chester Beatty Library, Dublin |location=Dublin |publisher=Chester Beatty Library |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He edited and published Armenian graffiti from [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] in a significant work of historical, epigraphic, and linguistic consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Armenian Inscriptions from the Sinai with Appendixes on the Georgian and Latin Inscriptions by M. van Esbroeck and W. Adler | location = Cambridge, MA | publisher = Harvard University Press | date = 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inscriptions shed light on ancient Armenian pilgrimage, on the character of the pilgrims, and on their linguistic usages. His research tied into Armenian graffiti in [[Nazareth]]. He proved that a portion of the inscriptions in Sinai and Nazareth are the oldest Armenian script in the world and were inscribed within decades of the creation of the Armenian alphabet (early fifth century CE).

Stone published numerous Armenian inscriptions from the Land of Israel and made several significant discoveries regarding Armenian pilgrimage and monasticism in the Holy Land. He was the editor in chief of The Album of Armenian Paleography, a large project that exhibits and analyzes the development of the Armenian script beginning with the most ancient dated manuscripts and up until the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = with D. Kouymian and H. Lehmann | title = Album of Armenian Paleography | location = Aarhus, Denmark | publisher = Aarhus University Press | year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of preparing this work he devised techniques for producing script tables directly from digital images of the manuscripts themselves. On one side of each opening there is a picture of the manuscript; on the other there is a copy of a segment of the text, paleographic discussion, and bibliography. At the end of the book appear development tables.

===Jews in Armenia===
With Israeli archeologist Dr. David Amit, Stone researched and published on a medieval Jewish cemetery of southern Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = A Jewish Cemetery in the Middle Ages in Eghegis in Southern Armenia | journal = Pe'amim | issue = 98-99: Winter-Spring | pages = 39–66 | date = 2004 | language = Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; This thirteenth-century cemetery is akin to no other – not only in terms of Armenia but of the oriental-Jewish communities. On the tombstones there are inscriptions in both Hebrew and Aramaic that teach about the life of the Jewish community in southern Armenia, about which there was no information previously. His research on the [[History of the Jews in Armenia|Jews of Armenia]] continues today.

===Use of computer applications===
Stone recognized very early on the potential of computer applications for Armenian studies. In 1971 he completed his first computer-aided research in Armenian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Concordance and Texts of Armenian IV Ezra |location=Jerusalem |publisher=Israel Oriental Society |date=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then he has used a computer application to compare manuscripts to produce scientific editions of texts as well as  concordances. He wrote books in other fields of Armenian Studies; for example, the publication of his research with M.E. Shirinian dealing with the edition, translation, and exegesis of an ancient philosophical work preserved only in Armenian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pseudo-Zeno: Anonymous Philosophical Treatise |location=Leiden |publisher=Brill |date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with R.R. Ervine on [[patristics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Armenian Texts of Epiphanius of Salamis de mensuris et ponderibus |location=Leuven |publisher=Peeters |date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish thought and literature of the Second Temple Period==
On this subject Stone dealt with a range of topics. Among the specific documents that he researched are [[2 Esdras#4 Ezra|4 Ezra]], the Aramaic Levi Document, the [[Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs]], [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] and [[Noah]] literature, and literature relating to Adam and Eve. In the field of history of religious thought he has worked especially on apocalyptic literature and also on issues dealing with the central characteristics of Judaism of that period. He has also written monographs and articles on many other subjects in the field.

===The Apocalypse of Ezra (4 Ezra)===
This text was the subject of Stone’s research for twenty-five years, the culmination of which was his exegesis of 4 Ezra, published in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Fourth Ezra: A Commentary on the Book of Fourth Ezra. Hermeneia Series | location = Minneapolis | publisher = Fortress | date = 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work was written originally in Hebrew approximately thirty years after the destruction of the Second Temple and translated into Greek. From this Greek version it was translated into other languages: Latin, Ethiopic, Syriac, Arabic, Armenian, and Georgian. None of the Hebrew versions have been preserved and only fragments of the Greek, and for the vast majority of the text there remains to the present day only the translations from Greek, on which Stone worked. His book features detailed interpretation of the verses together with a wider analysis of the literary dynamic and religious worldview of the author as revealed in the text’s content and presentation of topics. Over the years he wrote a series of articles on 4 Ezra, including the significance of structure, its notion of divine justice, as well as mystical and exegetical elements. These studies have been called “groundbreaking” by other researchers in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Things Revealed | editor1-last = Chazon | editor2-last = Satran | editor3-last = Clemens | page = xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone published two collections of articles on 4 Ezra and other dimensions of Second Temple Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Selected Studies in Pseudepigrapha and Apocrypha with Special Reference to the Armenian Tradition | location = Leiden | publisher = Brill | date = 1991}} {{cite book | title = Apocrypha, Pseudepigrapha and Armenian Studies: Collected Papers | location = Leuven | publisher = Peeters | date = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent factor of his exegetical approach to ancient texts is the idea that descriptions of religious phenomena may represent actual experiences of the author or of the circle from which he/she came. This approach considers the religious experience of the author as a factor for researching ancient religious literature.

He also published the Armenian version separately (mentioned above)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Textual Commentary on the Armenian Version of IV Ezra | location = Atlanta | publisher = Scholars Press | date = 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as his doctoral thesis on the text’s eschatology (1989). In the course of his research he led the study of apocalyptic literature on topics relating to ancient religious thought.

===The Testament of Levi and the Dead Sea Scrolls===
Along with his research on 4 Ezra, Stone published the Armenian text of The Testament of Levi (1969).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Testament of Levi: A First Study of the Armenian Manuscripts of the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs in the Convent of St. James, Jerusalem | location = Jerusalem | publisher = St. James Press | date = 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; After many years of work, he published a critical Armenian edition of all twelve testaments of the sons of Jacob with the help of his former student, Dr. Vered Hillel (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Armenian Version of the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs: Edition, Apparatus, Translation and Commentary | location = Leuven | publisher = Peeters | date = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the 1960s he commenced cooperation with Professor [[Jonas C. Greenfield|Jonas Greenfield]] regarding the Aramaic apocrypha, which continued until Greenfield’s death in 1995. Together and separately, they published a series of articles that arose from their research, including some addressing the Enoch literature. Since then, Stone published their joint edition of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] fragments of The Testament of Levi in the DJD series.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | contribution = Aramaic Levi Document | title = Qumran Cave 4 XVII: Parabiblical Texts, Part 3 (DJD 22) | editor-last = Brooke | editor-first = G.J. | location = Oxford | publisher = Clarendon | date = 1996 | pages = 2–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Dr. Esther Eshel, Stone completed his and Greenfield’s translation, exegesis, and research on this third- or second-century BCE work. The work survives in fragments transmitted in Jewish and Christian channels, including the [[Cairo Geniza]], a Greek manuscript, and Dead Sea fragments. They arranged scattered segments and wrote exegeses.

The research on the Book of Enoch led Stone to become interested in the Dead Sea Scrolls. He wrote on the relationship between the Pseudepigrapha and Qumran literature, classification of the Jewish literature in the days of the Second Temple, and related topics.

With Esther Eshel he edited the 4Q464 manuscript,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = An Exposition on the Patriarchs (4Q464) and Two Other Documents (4Q464a and 4Q464b) | journal = Le Muséon | volume = 105 | date = 1992 | pages = 243–264}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with Esther Chazon a fragmentary work on the end times. Likewise, in his edition of fragments from the Testament of Naphtali, Stone showed that the fragment found at [[Qumran]] was included in altered form in the Greek Testament of Naphtali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Testament of Naphtali | journal = JJS | volume = 47 | issue = 2 | date = 1996 | pages = 311–321}} {{citation | contribution = 4QTestament of Naphtali | title = Qumran Cave 4. XVII: Parabiblical Texts, Part 3 (DJD 22) | editor-last = Brooke | editor-first = G.J. | location = Oxford | publisher = Calrendon | date = 1996}} | pages = 73-82&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi [[Moshe ha-Darshan]], author of the Midrash Genesis Rabbati (France, eleventh century) knew of a similar or identical document to the Qumran one in a semitic language. From this the question of literary transmission from the days of the Second Temple to the Middle Ages arose acutely.

Stone founded the Orion Center for the Study of the Dead Sea Scrolls at the Hebrew University in 1995 and directed it during its early years.

===The Books of Adam and Eve===
Toward the end of the 1990s, Stone returned to a subject he discussed in his earliest articles: the Armenian apocryphal “Death of Adam.”

After publication of his commentary on 4 Ezra he turned to the apocryphal literature of Adam and Eve. In 1992 he wrote, A History of the Literature of Adam and Eve,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A History of the Literature of Adam and Eve | location = Atlanta | publisher = Scholars Press | date = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1999 he published a book on the subject with Professor Gary Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A Synopsis of the Books of Adam and Eve | edition = 2nd revised | location = Atlanta | publisher = Scholars Press | date = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Anderson, he also published a collection of studies on the Adam literature (2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | contribution = Studies in the Books of Adam and Eve | title = Literature on Adam and Eve | editor1-last = Anderson | editor1-first = G.A. | editor2-last = Stone | editor2-first = M.E. | editor3-last = Tromp | editor3-first = J. | location = Leiden | publisher = Brill | date = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and books on other aspects of the Adam and Eve literature.

The book, Adam’s Contract with Satan, deals with a tradition of Adam and Eve preserved in Slavic, Armenian, Georgian, modern Greek, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Adam's Contract with Satan: The Legend of the Cheirograph of Adam | location = Bloomington | publisher = Indiana University Press | date = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He followed the spread of this legend, which has it that after Adam and Eve left the Garden of Eden, they sinned a second time due to Satan deceiving them. That being the case, the post-lapsarian state of human beings in the world may be explained on two levels: 1—why we are not in the Garden of Eden based on the book of Genesis; 2—the fate of humans in the world is the outcome not of sin, but of deception (i.e., Satan deceived them). Subscribers to this perspective on the world see it differently than those that attribute it to the sin of Adam and Eve alone or to [[original sin]], as in [[Western Christianity]].

===The history of Ancient Judaism===
In this field Stone has delved into the character and phenomenology of Jewish apocryphal literature, a subject that occupied scholarship especially in the 1970s and 1980s. The conceptual innovations and insight contained in Stone’s writing on Second Temple Judaism (such as the transition from oral to written literature, the sociological approach to understanding the wisdom teacher, and questions pertaining to the pseudepigrapha) left a lasting impression on modern perceptions of the primary sources. His work in this field is published mainly in articles. Stone’s abilities and interests as a historian of religion are most prominent in this area of his research. His chief articles addressing these topics were gathered in two collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Selected Studies in Armenian Studies. SVTP 9 | location = Leiden | publisher = Brill | date = 1991}} {{cite book | title = Apocrypha, Pseudepigrapha and Armenian Studies: Collected Papers, 2 vols. OLA 144-145 | location = Leuven | publisher = Peeters | date = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current research===
Today Stone pursues several research endeavors in the field: he has just completed a comprehensive investigation of Adam and Eve in the Armenian tradition (2013);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Adam and Eve in the Armenian Tradition | location = Atlanta | publisher = Scholars Press | date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; he is preparing to publish many Armenian inscriptions from Jerusalem;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | contribution = The Armenian Inscriptions | title = Report on Excavations of the Third Wall | editor1-last = Amit | editor1-first = D. | editor2-last = Wolf | editor2-first = S. | location = Jerusalem | publisher = Israel Antiquities Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he is working on a book that will include previously unknown documents in Armenian about biblical figures.

==Research projects==

===Rock Inscriptions and Graffiti===
Stone collected photographs of graffiti inscriptions in many languages in the Sinai, the Negev, and the Christian holy places. He himself published much of the Armenian material documented during the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Rock Inscriptions and Graffiti Project: Catalogue of Inscriptions (3 vols.) | location = Atlanta | publisher = [[Scholars Press]] | date = 1992–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; This material has been mounted online at [http://rockinscriptions.huji.ac.il rockinscriptions.huji.ac.il].

===The Orion Center for the Study of the Dead Sea Scrolls and Related Literature===
In 1995, Stone founded the Orion Center for the Study of the Dead Sea Scrolls at the Hebrew University for the purpose of integrating new information from the scrolls with previous knowledge about Second Temple Judaism. Today, the Center is one of the important research institutes on the Dead Sea Scrolls.

===The International Association of Armenian Studies (Association Internationale des Etudes Arméniennes)===
Stone founded the International Association of Armenian Studies (Association Internationale des Etudes Armésniennes) in 1980, held the office of president until 2000, and since then is the honorary president. Membership in the organization, limited to researchers in the field, numbers today more than 200. It is the leading organization for Armenian Studies.

===The Jewish Cemetery in Armenia===
With the Israeli archeologist Dr. David Amit, Stone oversaw the excavation of the Jewish cemetery in Armenia and the publishing of the inscriptions.

'''Munsee''' (also known as Munsee Delaware, Delaware, Ontario Delaware) is an [[endangered language]] of the [[Eastern Algonquian languages|Eastern Algonquian]] subgroup of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language family, itself a branch of the [[Algic languages|Algic]] language family. Munsee is one of the two [[Delaware languages]] (also known as [[Lenape language]]s, after the tribe's autonym).  It is very closely related to the extinct [[Unami language|Unami]] Delaware, but the two are sufficiently different that they are considered separate languages. Munsee was spoken aboriginally in the vicinity of the modern [[New York City]] area in the [[United States]], including western [[Long Island]], [[Manhattan Island]], [[Staten Island]], as well as adjacent areas on the mainland: [[Lower Hudson Valley|southeastern New York State]], the northern third of [[New Jersey]], and northeastern [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 1978a, p. 213"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1996, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2009, Munsee was spoken only on the [[Moravian 47, Ontario|Moraviantown]] Reserve in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], by two elderly individuals, aged 77 and 90, in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Raymond, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://nationalpost.com/most_popular/story.html?id=1206724 Adam McDowell, "More than words: Can Canada's dying languages be saved?"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''National Post'', 22 Jan 2009.

==Classification==
Munsee is an Eastern Algonquian language, which is the sole recognized genetic subgroup descending from [[Proto-Algonquian language|Proto-Algonquian]], the common ancestor language of the Algonquian language family.  Munsee is very closely related to Unami Delaware.  Munsee and Unami constitute the Delaware languages, comprising a subgroup within Eastern Algonquian. Taken together with [[Mahican]], the Delaware languages constitute ''Delawaran,'' a subgroup within Eastern Algonquian.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 1996"&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Munsee developed as an English name for the aggregated group that formed along the upper Delaware River north of the [[Delaware Water Gap]].  Other Munsee dialect speakers joined the Minisink group;&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1978a, p. 213, 237&lt;/ref&gt; the earliest recorded mention of Munsee dates from 1725.&lt;ref name="Kraft, Herbert, 1986, p. xvii"&gt;Kraft, Herbert, 1986, p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt; Minisink is a Munsee term meaning "at the island", and is to be transcribed ''mə̆nə́sənk.'' It is the locative form of a now disused word /mənə́s/ "island"; cognates in other Algonquian languages are e.g. Ojibwe ''minis'', "island".&lt;ref&gt;Nyholm, Earl, and John Nichols, 1995, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Orthographic {{angbr|ink}} in the form Minisink is the modern Munsee locative suffix {{IPA|/-ənk/}} (discussed below in the Grammar section). The term "Munsee" is the English adaptation of a regularly formed word ''mə́n'si·w'' (person from Minisink).

Over time the British extended the term Munsee to any speaker of the Munsee language. Attempts to derive ''Munsee'' from a word meaning "stone" or "mountain," as proposed by [[Daniel Garrison Brinton|Brinton]], are incorrect.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 1978a, p. 237"&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1978a, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert C. Kraft|Kraft]]'s claim that ''Munsee'' is not an indigenous term, and that it results from a "corruption" of English use of Minisink is incorrect.  The term follows a regular pattern of Munsee word formation.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1978a, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnonyms===
Names for the speakers of Munsee are used in complex ways in both [[English language|English]] and in Munsee. The Unami language is sometimes treated as "Delaware" or "Delaware proper", reflecting the original application of the term Delaware to Unami speakers,&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1978, p. 73; Kraft, Herbert, 1986, p. xviii&lt;/ref&gt; but Munsee speakers use "Delaware" as a self-designation in English.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1974, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; The term Delaware was originally applied by British colonists to Unami speakers living along the [[Delaware River]], which is named after [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr|Lord De La Warr]], the first governor of Virginia. The term was gradually extended to refer to all Delaware groups.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1978a, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kraft, Herbert, 1986, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

The Munsee in Ontario are sometimes referred to as "Ontario Delaware" or "Canadian Delaware".&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1971, p. 11, n. 1-2; Goddard, Ives, 1974, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Munsee-speaking residents of Moraviantown use the English term "Munsee" to refer to residents of Munceytown, approximately {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} to the east.  In English, Moraviantown residents call themselves "Delaware", and in Munsee {{IPA|/lənáːpeːw/}} "Delaware person, Indian".&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1971, p. 122, n. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Delaware at Moraviantown also use the term [[Christian Munsee|Christian Indian]] as a preferred self-designation in English.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1974, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; The equivalent Munsee term is ''ké·ntə̆we·s'' ("one who prays, Moravian convert").&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 1978a, p. 237"/&gt; Munsee speakers refer to Oklahoma Delaware as "Unami" in English or /wə̆ná·mi·w/ in Munsee.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1971, p. 11, n. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The English term "Lenape" is of Unami origin,&lt;ref&gt;Kraft, Herbert, 1986a, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; and is used in English as a self-designation by speakers of Unami;&lt;ref name="Kraft, Herbert, 1986, p. xvii"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1978a, pp. 234-235, 225, Table 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mithun, Marianne, 1999, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt;

Exceptionally among scholars, Kraft uses Lenape as an English-language cover term to refer to all Delaware-speaking groups, while noting that this usage is "not entirely appropriate".&lt;ref&gt;Kraft, Herbert, 1986, p. xviii; Kraft, Herbert, 1986a, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

Munsee speakers refer to their language as /hə̀lə̆ni·xsəwá·kan/, literally "speaking the Delaware language".&lt;ref&gt;O'Meara, John, 1996, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic distribution==
Speakers of Munsee originally resided in the greater Manhattan area, the drainage of the Lower [[Hudson Valley|Hudson River valley]], and the upper Delaware River. The arrival of European explorers, traders and settlers resulted in the progressive displacement of Munsee people over a period of several centuries. Munsee groups affected by this process ultimately moved away from their homeland to communities in both the United States and Canada.

In the twentieth century, surviving Munsee speakers in Canada lived at [[Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation|Six Nations]], Ontario; [[Munsee-Delaware Nation 1, Ontario|Munceytown]], Ontario; and [[Moravian 47, Ontario|Moraviantown]] Reserve.  Now extinct in the first two locations, the language is used only by a few elders at Moraviantown, Ontario.

Since the early 21st century, the language has been taught to tribal members of the [[Stockbridge-Munsee]] Band of [[Mohican]] Native Americans, the [[Ramapough Mountain Indians]] and the [[Delaware Nation]], Moraviantown Reserve.&lt;!-- Don't keep changing name of Moraviantown band --&gt;

===Original location===
The southern boundary of Munsee territory was the area north of the Delaware Water Gap, following the river system southeast along the [[Raritan River]] to the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1978a, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; To the south of the Munsee were the Unami Delaware. To the north were the Algonquian [[Mahican language|Mahican]], and to the east were the Eastern Long Island peoples, who also spoke Algonquian languages, such as [[Mohegan-Montauk-Narragansett language|Unquachog]] (also spelled Unkechaug)&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Patricia, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and southern New England languages, such as [[Quiripi language|Quiripi]]. (Quiripi and Unquachog are likely members of a dialect continuum of a single language.)&lt;ref&gt;Costa, David, 2007, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Blair A. Rudes|Rudes, Blair]], 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboriginally, and for a period subsequent to the arrival of Europeans, Munsee was spoken within a series of small and largely autonomous local bands, located primarily within the drainage of the Hudson and upper Delaware rivers, the major river systems of the area. The general pattern, found throughout the Eastern Algonquian area, was one in which [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] groups resided along the drainages of major river systems, with divisions between upriver and downriver groupings.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Dean, 1978, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Named groups were found on the major tributaries; they developed larger sites on the main streams and smaller camps at the headwaters and on feeder streams.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Lorraine, 1995, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates vary, but these local groups may have had a population of up to two hundred people each.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 1978a, p. 213"&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1978a, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; These groups spoke localized varieties of the language now called Munsee, but there is little information on dialect variation within the Munsee-speaking area.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1978, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary known named Munsee groups, from north to south on the west side of the Hudson River, were the 
*Esopus, west of the [[Hudson River]] in the Hudson River watershed (with subgroups the Waoranecks, Warranawankongs, and others);
*Minisink (above the Delaware Water Gap);
*Haverstraw, Tappan, and Hackensack, south of the Hudson Highlands west of the Hudson River;
*Raritan, who originally resided on the lower [[Raritan River]] and moved inland;
*Wiechquaeskeck, from east of the Hudson who migrated to the lower Raritan after 1649; with the 
*Navasink, to the east along the north shore of New Jersey east of the Delaware River.

The Wappinger were to the east of the upper Hudson; below them going north to south on the east bank of the Hudson were the 
*Kichtawank;
*Sinsink;
*Rechgawawank;
*Nayack;
*Marechkawieck, with the Canarsee and Rockaway on western Long Island; and
*Massapequa and Matinecock on central Long Island, who may have been Munsee or perhaps were the predecessors of the Unquachog group identified in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1978a, p. 213-216&lt;/ref&gt;

The disruptions resulting from the entry of European settlers, fur traders, and explorers led to the displacement of these local groups. They gradually consolidated into larger groups that brought together speakers from the different groups within the Munsee-speaking area.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 1978a, p. 213"/&gt;

==Sounds==
Munsee phonology is complex but regular in many regards. [[Metrical phonology|Metrical]] rules of syllable weight assignment play a key role in the assignment of word-level [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]], and also determine the form of rules of vowel [[Syncope (phonetics)|Syncope]] that produce complex but mostly regular alternations in the forms of words.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1979, Ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Word-level stress is largely predictable, with exceptions occurring primarily in loan words, [[Reduplication|reduplicated]] forms, and in words where historical change has made historically transparent alternations more opaque.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 1982"/&gt;

===Consonants and vowels===
Munsee has the following inventory of consonants; [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) values are given in brackets.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 1979, p. 11"&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1979, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Some loan words from English contain /f/ and /r/: ''fé·li·n'' 'there is a fair going on'; ''ntáyrəm'' 'my tire.'&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 1982"&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

Different analyses of the Munsee vowel system have been proposed. Goddard (1979) presents an analysis in which Munsee and Unami have the same vowel system, unchanged from the Proto-Eastern-Algonquian vowel system (discussed in the ''History'' section below).&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 1979, p. 11"/&gt; In this analysis, there are four long vowels /i·, o·, e·, a·/ and two short vowels /a, ə/. Vowel length is indicated with a raised dot (·). However, in modern Munsee there are several sources of new short /i, o, e/ that arise from such sources as reduplication, loan words, and other various phonological changes, and that cannot be derived from other underlying vowels. Hence an analysis in which there are four positions that have contrastive vowel length as well as /ə/, is appropriate.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 1982"/&gt;

The short vowel {{IPA|/i/}} has the phonetic value {{IPA|[ɪ]}}. Short {{IPA|/a/}} has values centring on {{IPA|[ʌ]}}, with {{IPA|[a]}} occurring before {{IPA|[hC]}} (where 'C' represents any stop or the lateral consonant). Short {{IPA|/o/}} has values centring on {{IPA|[ʊ]}}. The long vowels {{IPA|/iː, eː, aː, oː/}} have the primary values {{IPA|[iː]}}, {{IPA|[ɛː]}}, {{IPA|[aː]}}, and {{IPA|[oː]}}, with {{IPA|/a/}} varying to {{IPA|[ɑ]}}, and {{IPA|[ɒ]}} after labial consonants.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 1982_18-19"&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1982, pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syllable weight===
Syllable weight plays a significant role in Munsee phonology, determining stress placement and the deletion of certain short vowels. All syllables containing long vowels are ''strong.'' Any short vowel in a closed syllable (i.e. (C)VC) is strong. Counting left to right, in a sequence of two or more open syllables containing short vowels, the odd-numbered syllable is ''weak'' and the even-numbered syllable is strong.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1979, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; As well, certain syllables containing short vowels (frequently such syllables occur in reduplicated syllables and loan words) must exceptionally be marked as strong.

In words longer than two syllables, the final syllable is excluded from consideration of stress placement, i.e. is [[Extrametricality|extrametrical]], and the last strong syllable preceding the final syllable in the word receives the main stress.

(a) ''payaxkhı́·kan'' 'rifle' (strong penultimate, receives primary stress)

(b) ''né·wake'' 'if I see him' (weak penultimate, preceding syllable receives primary stress)

In disyllabic words a strong penultimate syllable receives primary stress.

(a) ''á·mwi·w'' 's/he gets up from lying down' (disyllabic Strong-Strong)

In a disyllable with a weak penultimate syllable, the final syllable is strong, and receives primary stress.

(a) ''ăsə́n'' 'stone' (disyllabic Weak-Strong)

==Grammar==
{{Main|Munsee grammar}}
The grammar of Munsee is characterized by complex [[inflection]]al and [[Derivational morphology|derivational]] [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology.]] Inflection in Munsee is realized through the use of prefixes and suffixes added to word stems to indicate grammatical information, including number (singular or plural), [[Grammatical gender|gender]], [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Possession (linguistics)|possession]], [[Negation (linguistics)|negation]], obviation, and others.

Nouns use combinations of person prefixes and suffixes to indicate possession, and suffixes to indicate gender, number, diminutive, absentative, and obviation.

Verbs use a single set of person prefixes and a series of suffixes in position classes following the verb stem to indicate combinations of person, number, negation, obviation, and others.

==Writing system==
There is no standard writing system for Munsee. Linguists have tended to use common phonetic transcription symbols of the type found in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] or similar [[Americanist phonetic notation|Americanist]] symbols in order to represent sounds that are not consistently represented in conventional standard writing systems.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Goddard, Ives, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

Europeans writing down Delaware words and sentences have tended to use adaptations of European alphabets and associated conventions. The quality of such transliterated renditions have varied widely, as Europeans attempted to record sounds and sound combinations they were not familiar with.&lt;ref&gt;Brinton, Daniel, and Albert Anthony, 1888; Zeisberger, David, 1887&lt;/ref&gt;

A practical orthography for Munsee has been created in the context of various language preservation and documentation projects. A recent bilingual dictionary of Munsee uses a practical orthography derived from a linguistic transcription system for Munsee.&lt;ref&gt;O'Meara, John, 1996; see Goddard, Ives, 1979 for the underlying transcription system&lt;/ref&gt; The same system is also used in a recent word book produced locally at Moraviantown.&lt;ref&gt;Delaware Nation Council, 1992, pp. 57-63&lt;/ref&gt; The related Unami language is written using a distinct [[Delaware languages#Writing systems|practical orthography]].

===Writing system samples===
The table below presents a sample of Munsee words, written first in a linguistically oriented transcription, followed by the same words written in a practical system.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1982; O'Meara, John, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The linguistic system uses a raised dot (·) to indicate vowel length. Although stress is mostly predictable, the linguistic system uses the acute accent to indicate predictable main stress. As well, predictable voiceless or murmured /ă/ is indicated with the breve accent (˘). Similarly, the breve accent is used to indicate an ultra-short {{IPA|[ə]}} that typically occurs before a single voiced consonant followed by a vowel.&lt;ref&gt;See Goddard, Ives, 1982, p. 19 for further detail&lt;/ref&gt;

The practical system indicates vowel length by doubling the vowel letter, and maintains the linɡuistic system's practices for marking stress and voiceless/ultra-short vowels. The practical system uses orthographic {{angbr|sh}} for the phonetic symbol /š/, and {{angbr|ch}} for the phonetic symbol /č/.&lt;ref&gt;O'Meara, John, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

== Linguistic variation ==
Currently, the Munsee language has 8 native speakers whose personal dialects vary from each other.  Extensive details about how the language differs between all 8 speakers have been cataloged in a paper by Ives Goddard titled "The Personal Dialects of Moraviantown Delaware" which was published in Anthropological Linguistics volume 52.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 2010, p. 14"&gt;Goddard, Ives, 2010, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

=== &lt;u&gt;Phonological variation&lt;/u&gt; ===

==== Optional pronunciation of final /-w/ ====
Nouns and verbs that end in '''-i•w''', '''-e•w''' and '''-a•w''', some speakers often dropped the '''-w'''.  This drop also carried over into "careful speech".&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 2010, p. 14"/&gt;

==== Particles originally in /-i/ and /-e/ ====
A large class of particles and pre-words that are usually heard with final '''/-ɘ/''' retained the original '''/-i/''' in the speech of some speakers.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 2010, p. 14"/&gt;

==== Verb endings originally in /-i/ and /-e/ ====
Words that end with the negative suffix '''/-wi/''' or the subjunctive suffix '''/-e/''' had variants with final '''/-ɘ/'''.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 2010, p. 14"/&gt;

==== Particles originally in /-Í•wi/ ====
Another large class of particles and pre-words are found in older sources ending in '''/-Í·wi/''', e.g.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 2010, p. 15"&gt;Goddard, Ives, 2010, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other lexicalized Variations ===

==== Variation between | a | and | ə | ====
Some words have variation between underlying '''| a |''' and '''| ə |'''.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 2010, p. 15"/&gt;  It is possible to determine which vowel is older and which might be the innovation by using evidence from other Algonquin languages, other Munsee communities and earlier sources.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 2010, p. 15"/&gt;

==== Variation between short and long vowels ====
An initial and three words show variation between short and long vowels.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 2010, p. 16"&gt;Goddard, Ives, 2010, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;  These words are:

''ans ~ a·ns- '&lt;nowiki/&gt;'' scoop''': ánsham ~ á•nsham'' 'he dips up water'

''me•xalapó•ti•s ~ me•xa•làpó•ti-s'' 'spider'

''wekó•li•s ~ we•kó•li•s'' 'whippoorwill'

''yankw(ǎ)té•ho•n ~ ya•nkw(ă)té•ho•n'' 'apron'

==== Variation between | nš | and | nč |. ====
Two words have '''| nš |''' varying with '''| nč |'''.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 2010, p. 16"/&gt;''T''

These words are ''xwaskó-nšəy ~ xwaskó-nčəy'' 'corncob' and ''sànǎkó-nšə̃yak ~ sànǎkó-nčə̃yak'' 'elderberries'.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 2010, p. 16"/&gt;

==== Other differences in a single segment ====
A number of cases are present where one segment varies or is variably present.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 2010, p. 16-17"&gt;Goddard, Ives, 2010, p. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, '''/ t /''' is replaced by '''/ k /''' in ''le•làpatíhte•k'' (etc.) ~ ''le•làpatíhke•k'' (etc.) 'juneberry'.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 2010, p. 16-17"/&gt;

==== Nouns with variably present /-əw/. ====
Some nouns are found with and without a final '''/-əw/'''.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 2010, p. 17"&gt;Goddard, Ives, 2010, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bird names with | l | ~ | n |. ====
In two bird names, '''| l |''' varies with '''| n |'''.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 2010, p. 17"/&gt;

For example: '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''taskãmális -~ taskamáni•s '''kingfisher' ; ''ši•wa•pé•kăli•š ~ ši•wa•pé•kăni•š''  'bluebird''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 2010, p. 17"/&gt;''

==== More complex variation ====
Some words have more complex patterns of variation.  For example: the word "table" - ''e•həntáxpwi•nk'' is the original.  The word is sometimes changed to e•həntáxpo•n which is the same word but it is reshaped as a derived noun.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 2010, p.17&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Different words ====
Some cases involve different words or "highly divergent variants" used as synonyms. For example, there are 4 ways to say "eyelashes" that are seen in the personal dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 2010, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Variation origination ===
There is no community norm, as the more widely used variants do not define a community norm for either the speakers or the linguist.  Additionally, some variants cannot be rated as more and less popular or acceptable.  "Even a normative description would have to give both or all of them".&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 2010, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Some variation originates externally.  Some usages can be traced directly to the Northern Unami language that was earlier spoken by some members of the Munsee community.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 2010, p. 25"&gt;Goddard, Ives, 2010, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Some variation originates internally.  These pronunciations and grammatical tendencies are likely to have emerged in the not too distant past.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 2010, p. 25"/&gt;

==History==
Munsee is an Eastern Algonquian language. The hypothetical common ancestor language from which the Eastern Algonquian languages descend is Proto-Eastern Algonquian (PEA). An intermediate group ''Delawaran'' that is a descendant of Proto-Eastern Algonquian consists of Mahican and Common Delaware, the latter being a further subgroup comprising Munsee Delaware and Unami Delaware.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 1996"/&gt; The justification for Delawaran as an intermediate subgroup rests upon the high degree of similarity between Mahican and the two Delaware languages, but relatively little detailed argumentation in support of Delaware has been adduced.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pentland, David, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

Munsee is demonstrably phonologically conservative, and is considered to have retained many of the phonological characteristics of PEA. In comparison, Unami has undergone extensive phonological innovation, coupled with morphological [[regularization (linguistics)|regularization]].&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 1982"/&gt;

The PEA vowel system consisted of four long vowels ''*i·, *o·, *e·, *a·,''  and two short vowels ''*a'' and ''ə.'' The vowel history is as follows: ''*i·'' (from PEA merger of Proto-Algonquian (PA ''*i·'' and ''*i'' to PEA ''*i·''), ''*o·'' (from PEA merger of PA ''*o·'' and ''*o'' ), ''*e·'' (from Proto-Algonquian ''*e·''), and ''*a·'' (from Proto-Algonquian ''*a·''; the short vowels are''*ə'' (from Proto-Algonquian ''*e''), and ''*a'' (from Proto-Algonquian ''*a''). This system was continued down to Common Delaware,&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1982; Goddard, Ives, 1979, p. 11,&lt;/ref&gt; but Munsee and Unami have innovated separately with respect to the vowel systems.

Contrastive vowel length for Munsee high vowels has been reintroduced, and also for the front mid-vowels. For modern Munsee it is necessary to recognize long /i·, o·, e·, a·/ and short /i, o, e, a/. Innovating instances of short /i, o, and e/ arise from for example reduplicating syllables and loan words.

[[File:Naqsh-e Rajab 01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|"Shapur's Parade" at Naqsh-e Rajab]]
'''Naqsh-e Rajab''' ({{lang-fa|نقش رجب}}, {{IPA-fa|næɣʃeɾæˈd͡ʒæb}}) is an archaeological site just west of [[Istakhr]] and about 5 km north of [[Persepolis]] in [[Fars Province]], [[Iran]]. 

Together with [[Naqsh-e Rustam]], which lies 2.5 km away, the site is part of the Marvdasht cultural complex. Together, the two sites are a tentative candidate for [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage]] status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/898/|title=Nasqsh-e Rostam and Naqsh-e Rajab|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naqsh-e Rajab is the site of four limestone rockface inscriptions and [[Rock relief|rock-cut bas-reliefs]] that date to the early [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid era]]. One of the carvings is the investiture inscription of [[Ardeshir I]] (ruled in 226-241 CE), the founder of the dynasty. The second investiture inscription is Ardeshir's successor, [[Shapur I]] (241-272 CE). A third bas-relief, known as 'Shapur's Parade' celebrates the king's military victory in 244 over the Roman emperor [[Philip the Arab]]. A fourth bas-relief and inscription is attributed to [[Kartir]], high priest under Shapur I and his sons [[Hormizd I]] (272-273 CE) and [[Bahram I]] (273–276 CE).

'''Normative''' generally means relating to an evaluative standard. Normativity is the phenomenon in human societies of designating some actions or outcomes as good or desirable or permissible and others as bad or undesirable or impermissible. A norm in this normative sense means a standard for evaluating or making judgments about behavior or outcomes. Normative is sometimes also used, somewhat confusingly, to mean relating to a descriptive standard: doing what is normally done or what most others are expected to do in practice. In this sense a norm is not evaluative, a basis for judging behavior or outcomes; it is simply a fact or observation about behavior or outcomes, without judgment. Many researchers in this field try to restrict the use of the term normative to the evaluative sense and refer to the description of behavior and outcomes as positive, descriptive, predictive, or empirical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Grammar of Society:The Nature and Dynamics of Social Norms|last=Bicchieri|first=Cristina|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0521574907|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Norms in the Wild: How to Diagnose, Measure, and Change Social Norms|last=Bicchieri|first=Cristina|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2017|isbn=9780190622053|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Normative'' has specialized meanings in different academic disciplines such as philosophy, social sciences, and law. In most contexts, normative means 'relating to an evaluation or value judgment.' Normative propositions tend to evaluate some object or some course of action. Normative content differs from descriptive content.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/227918828|title=Normativity|last=Jarvis.|first=Thomson, Judith|date=2008|publisher=Open Court|isbn=9780812696585|location=Chicago, Ill.|oclc=227918828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major developments in analytic philosophy has seen the reach of normativity spread to virtually all corners of the field, from ethics and the philosophy of action, to epistemology, metaphysics, and the philosophy of science. Saul Kripke famously showed that rules (including mathematical rules, such as the repetition of a decimal pattern) are normative in an important respect.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/862091562|title=Being realistic about reasons|last=Thomas,|first=Scanlon,|isbn=9780199678488|edition= First|location=Oxford|oclc=862091562}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/7998796|title=Wittgenstein on rules and private language : an elementary exposition|last=1940-|first=Kripke, Saul A.,|date=1982|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0674954009|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=7998796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though philosophers disagree about how normativity should be understood, it has become increasingly common to understand normative claims as claims about reasons.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As Derek Parfit explains:

{{Quote|We can have reasons to believe something, to do something, to have some desire or aim, and to have many other attitudes and emotions, such as fear, regret, and hope. Reasons are given by facts, such as the fact that someone's finger-prints are on some gun, or that calling an ambulance would save someone's life. It is hard to explain the ''concept'' of a reason, or what the phrase 'a reason' means. Facts give us reasons, we might say, when they count in favour of our having some attitude, or our acting in some way. But 'counts in favour of' means roughly 'gives a reason for'. The concept of a reason is best explained by example. One example is the thought that we always have a reason to want to avoid being in agony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/744616054|title=On what matters Volume one|last=Derek.|first=Parfit,|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Scheffler, Samuel, 1951-|isbn=9780191576706|location=Oxford|oclc=744616054}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Philosophy ==
{{main|Ethics}}
In [[philosophy]], ''normative'' statements make claims about how things should or [[Is-ought problem|ought]] to be, how to [[Value theory|value]] them, which things are [[goodness and value theory|good]] or bad, and which [[Action (philosophy)|action]]s are [[right]] or [[wrong]].  Normative claims are usually contrasted with [[Positive statement|positive]] (i.e. descriptive, [[explanation|explanatory]], or [[constative]]) claims when describing types of [[theory|theories]], [[belief]]s, or [[proposition]]s. Positive statements are (purportedly) factual statements that attempt to describe [[reality]].

For example, "children should eat vegetables", and "those who would sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither" are normative claims. On the other hand, "vegetables contain a relatively high proportion of vitamins", and "a common consequence of sacrificing liberty for security is a loss of both" are positive claims. Whether a statement is normative is logically independent of whether it is verified, verifiable, or popularly held.

There are several schools of thought regarding the status of normative statements and whether they can be [[reason|rationally]] discussed or defended. Among these schools are the tradition of [[practical reason]] extending from [[Aristotle]] through [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] to [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]], which asserts that they can, and the tradition of [[emotivism]], which maintains that they are merely expressions of emotions and have no cognitive content. &lt;!--last sentence/statement: i.e., objectivity vs. subjectivity(?)--&gt;

Normative statements and [[norm (philosophy)|norms]], as well as their meanings, are an integral part of human life. They are fundamental for prioritizing goals and organizing and planning. [[Thought]], [[belief]], [[emotion]], and [[Action (philosophy)|action]] are the basis of much ethical and political discourse; indeed, normativity is arguably the key feature distinguishing ethical and political discourse from other discourses (such as natural science).

Much modern moral/ethical philosophy takes as its starting point the apparent variance between peoples and cultures regarding the ways they define what is considered to be appropriate/desirable/praiseworthy/valuable/good etc. (In other words, variance in how individuals, groups and societies define what is in accordance with their normative standards.) This has led philosophers such as [[A.J. Ayer]] and [[J.L. Mackie]] (for different reasons and in different ways) to cast doubt on the meaningfulness of normative statements. However, other philosophers, such as [[Christine Korsgaard]], have argued for a source of normative value which is independent of individuals' subjective morality and which consequently attains (a lesser or greater degree of) objectivity.

== Social sciences and economics ==
In the [[social sciences]], the term "normative" has broadly the same meaning as its usage in philosophy, but may also relate, in a [[sociological]] context, to the role of cultural '[[norm (social)|norms]]'; the shared values or institutions that [[structural functionalist]]s regard as constitutive of the [[social structure]] and [[social cohesion]]. These values and units of [[socialization]] thus act to encourage or enforce social activity and outcomes that ''ought'' to (with respect to the [[norm (sociology)|norms]] implicit in those structures) occur, while discouraging or preventing social activity that ''ought not'' occur. That is, they promote social activity that is socially ''valued'' (see [[normative#Philosophy|philosophy]] above). While there are always anomalies in social activity (typically described as "[[crime]]" or anti-social behaviour, see also [[normality (behavior)]]) the normative effects of popularly endorsed beliefs (such as "[[family values]]" or "[[common sense]]") push most social activity towards a generally homogeneous set. From such reasoning, however, functionalism shares an affinity with ideological [[conservatism]].

[[Normative economics]] deals with questions of what sort of economic policies should be pursued, in order to achieve desired (that is, valued) economic outcomes.

== International relations ==
In the academic discipline of [[International relations]], Smith, Baylis &amp; Owens in the ''Introduction'' to their 2008 &lt;ref&gt;''The Globalization of World Politics: An introduction to international relations'', New York, Oxford University Press {{ISBN|9780199297771}}, Fourth edition, pp.2-13&lt;/ref&gt; book make the case that the normative position or normative theory is to make the world a better place and that this theoretical [[worldview]] aims to do so by being aware of [[Tacit assumption|implicit assumption]]s and [[explicit assumption]]s that constitute a non-normative position, and align or position the normative towards the [[:wikt:loci|loci]] of other key socio-political theories such as political [[Liberalism]], [[Marxism]], political [[Constructivism (international relations)|Constructivism]], political [[Realism (international relations)|Realism]], political [[Idealism]] and political [[Globalization]].

== Law ==
{{See also|Normative jurisprudence}}
In [[law]], as an academic discipline, the term "normative" is used to describe the way something ought to be done according to a value position. As such, normative arguments can be conflicting, insofar as different values can be inconsistent with one another. For example, from one normative value position the purpose of the criminal process may be to repress crime. From another value position, the purpose of the criminal justice system could be to protect individuals from the moral harm of wrongful conviction.

== Standards documents ==
Normative elements are defined in [[International Organization for Standardization]] Directives Part 2 as "elements that describe the scope of the document, and which set out provisions".  Provisions include "requirements", "recommendations" and "statements".  "Statements" include permissions, possibilities and capabilities.  A "requirement" is an "expression in the content of a document conveying criteria to be fulfilled if compliance with the document is to be claimed and from which no deviation is permitted."  It is not necessary to comply with recommendations and statements in order to comply with the standard; it is necessary to comply only with the requirements (that are denoted by the verbal form "shall").  There is much confusion between "normative" and "requirement", however the ISO terminology is supported by national standards bodies worldwide and is the legitimate description of these terms in the context of standards documents.

In [[Standardization|standard]]s terminology still used by some organisations, "normative" means "considered to be a [[wikt:prescriptive|prescriptive]] part of the standard". It characterises that part of the standard which describes what ''ought'' (see [[normative#Philosophy|philosophy]] above) to be done within the application of that standard. It is implicit that application of that standard will result in a ''valuable'' outcome (''ibid.''). For example, many standards have an introduction, preface, or summary that is considered non-normative, as well as a main body that is considered normative. "Compliance" is defined as "complies with the normative sections of the standard"; an object that complies with the normative sections but not the non-normative sections of a standard is still considered to be in compliance.

* Normative = prescriptive = how to comply
* Informative = descriptive = help with conceptual understanding

Typically, ''normative'' is contrasted with ''informative'' (referring to the standard's descriptive, explanatory or [[Positive science|positive]] content).  Informative data is supplemental information such as additional guidance, supplemental recommendations, tutorials, commentary as well as background, history, development, and relationship with other elements.  Informative data is not a requirement and doesn’t compel compliance.

==Biography==
Ronen was born in Odessa in 1937 into a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] [[Jewish]] family. His father was the biochemist Emerich (Imre) Szörényi (January 12, 1905&amp;nbsp;– January 17, 1959), known for his work on muscle physiology. From 1934 to 1953, the family lived in the Soviet Union, where Emerich Szörényi headed the tissue protein research department of the Institute of Biochemistry and the biochemistry department of the Institute of Microbiology of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. In 1950, he was appointed head of the newly established  Institute of Biochemistry in Hungary, however, he was only able to return to Hungary with his family in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.matud.iif.hu/2010/12/09.htm|journal=Magyar Tudomány|title=A HATVANÉVES MTA ENZIMOLÓGIAI INTÉZET ELSŐ ÉVTIZEDE|last=Orosz|first=Ferenc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5922">The '''Paleo-Eskimo''' (also '''pre-Thule''' or '''pre-Inuit''') were the peoples who inhabited the [[Arctic]] region from [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug|Chukotka]] (e.g., [[Chertov Ovrag]]) in present-day [[Russia]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=9pxG5VDx9tkC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA354&amp;ots=qLsI2N7N_E&amp;sig=PxrV3jZ0fn8nrLsSyWR8Mbktw6M#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Sea mammal hunters of Chukotka, Bering Strait: Recent archaeological results and problems] by SV Gusev, AV Zagoroulko &amp; AV Porotov&lt;/ref&gt; across [[North America]] to [[Greenland]] prior to the arrival of the modern [[Inuit]] ([[Eskimo]]) and related cultures. The [[Early Paleoeskimo|first known Paleo-Eskimo]] cultures developed by 2500 BCE, but were gradually displaced in most of the region, with the last one, the [[Dorset culture]], disappearing around 1500 CE.

Paleo-Eskimo groups included the [[Pre-Dorset]]; the [[Saqqaq culture]] of Greenland (2500 – 800 BCE); the [[Independence I culture|Independence I]] and [[Independence II culture]]s of northeastern Canada and Greenland (c. 2400 – 1800 BCE and c. 800 – 1 BCE); the [[Groswater]] of [[Labrador]] and [[Nunavik]], and the Dorset culture (500 BCE to 1500 CE), which spread across Arctic North America. The Dorset were the last major Paleo-Eskimo culture in the Arctic before the migration east from present-day [[Alaska]] of the [[Thule people|Thule]], the ancestors of the modern Inuit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natmus.dk/sw18630.asp "The Prehistory of Greenland"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516102219/http://www.natmus.dk/sw18630.asp |date=2008-05-16 }}, Greenland Research Centre, National Museum of Denmark, accessed April 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==First ancient human to have genome sequenced==
In February 2010, scientists reported they had performed the first [[genome sequencing]] of an ancient human.  Using fragments of hair 4,000 years old, the [[National Museum of Denmark]], the [[Beijing Genomics Institute]], and additional collaborating scientific institutions sequenced nearly 80% of a Paleo-Eskimo man's genome. The man was found in Greenland and believed to be from the prehistoric [[Saqqaq culture]].

Based on the genome, the scientists believe there was a distinct, separate [[Human migration|migration of peoples]] from [[Siberia]] to North America some 5,500 years ago.  They noted that this was independent of earlier migrations, whose descendants comprised the historic cultures of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]], as well as of the later migration by the Inuit. By 4,500 years ago, descendants of this migration had reached Greenland.  The remains used for analysis were found in a Saqqaq culture area.&lt;ref name=Rasmussen&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Rasmussen | first1 = M. | last2 = Li | first2 = Y. | last3 = Lindgreen | first3 = S. | last4 = Pedersen | first4 = JS. | last5 = Albrechtsen | first5 = A. | last6 = Moltke | first6 = I. | last7 = Metspalu | first7 = M. | last8 = Metspalu | first8 = E. | last9 = Kivisild | first9 = T. | last10 = Gupta | first10 = Ramneek | last11 = Bertalan | first11 = Marcelo | last12 = Nielsen | first12 = Kasper | last13 = Gilbert | first13 = M.

&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientists reported that the man, dubbed "Inuk" (the [[Inuktitut]] word for "person"), had [[ABO blood group system|A+ blood type]] and genes suggesting he was adapted to cold weather, had brown eyes, brownish skin, and dark hair, and would have likely balded later in life. This marked the first sequencing of an ancient human's genome and the first sequencing of an ancient human's [[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] genome.&lt;ref name=Rasmussen/&gt;

==Paleo-Eskimo and Athabaskans==
A 2017 study identifies Paleo-Eskimo ancestry in [[Athabaskans]], as well as in other [[Na-Dene languages|Na-Dene-speaking]] populations.&lt;ref&gt;Pavel Flegontov et al (2017), [https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/10/13/203018 Paleo-Eskimo genetic legacy across North America.] {{doi|10.1101/203018}} biorxiv.org&lt;/ref&gt; The authors note that the Paleo-Eskimo peoples lived alongside Na-Dene ancestors for millennia. Thus, there's new evidence of a genetic connection between Siberian and Na-Dene populations mediated by Paleo-Eskimos.

According to these scholars, in general, the Paleo-Eskimos had large proportions of Beringian (which includes [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages|Chukotko-Kamchatkan]] and [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo-Aleut]]), Siberian, and South-East Asian ancestry. According to some scholars, they may also be related to the later [[Old Bering Sea]] archaeological culture.

'''Patriarchalism''' is a political theory that arose in [[England]] in the seventeenth century that defended the concept of absolute power for the monarchy, through language that emphasized the "paternal" power of the king over the state and his subjects.&lt;ref name="Gordon Schochet"&gt;{{cite book|title=Patriarchalism in political thought: the authoritarian family and political speculation and attitudes, especially in seventeenth-century England|first=Gordon|last=Schochet|publisher=Basic Books|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Patriarchalism_in_political_thought.html?id=HKEgAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|pages=|year=1975}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to divisive religious policy, controversial political strategy at home and disastrous diplomatic campaigns abroad, James I and Charles I alienated the consensus
of the people. Hence the patriots played down the leading role of the sovereign. They
questioned the royal prerogative, seeing the king as the mere figurehead of England. The king's absolute authority was challenged by the authority of Parliament.

Against this increasing opposition, the Patriarchalists emphasized the absolute right of the king, as the paternal head of state. In ''Patriarcha'' (composed in the late 1620s), [[Robert Filmer|Sir Robert Filmer]] said "many out of an imaginary fear
pretend the power of the people to be necessary for the repressing of the insolencies of tyrants, herein they propound a remedy far worse than the disease"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Filmer|title=Patriarcha, in Patriarcha and Other Political Writings|editor=J P Sommerville|publisher=Cambridge|year=1991|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filmer used genealogy as a way to legitimize kingship, by tracing the throne's origins back to the original fatherly rule of Adam.

Filmer argued that the king ''is'' the father; the relationship is not one of similarity, but of identity, the right of fathers having been passed down genealogically since Adam.

Stating that the ideal relationship was between a father and his son to indicate the "mutuall trust and Confidence" which was always necessary in the State, Kynaston put forward the view that the inferior (the people) ought not to plot against the superior (the king).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kynaston|first=F|title=A True Presentation of forepast Parliaments to the viewe of present tymes and Posteritie|publisher=British Library, Lansdowne|pages=167a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Mocket maintained that the maxim “Honor thy Father, and thy Mother” pertained to the political sphere rather than to the familial one since it had more to do with political obedience than with submission within the household&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hist.ceu.hu/conferences/graceh/abstracts/cuttica_cesare.pdf|title="Adam and the king": the fatherly image of the State. Patriarchalism as political language in early seventeenth-century England|publisher=Cesare Cuttica|accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Locke|Locke]] and [[Montesquieu]] were instrumental in the rejection of Patriarchalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Patriarchalism and Its Early Enemies|first=Mark|last=Hulliung|journal=Political Theory|volume=2|issue=4|date=1974-11-01|pages=410–419|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.|doi=10.1177/009059177400200404 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The '''SOAS School of Law''' was established in 1947 with Vesey-Fitzgerald as its first head, and as such is one of the 20 oldest law schools in [[England]]. Initially, the School of Law only hosted post-graduate students. In 1975, under the leadership of [[Antony Nicholas Allott]], the school developed a uniquely comparative undergraduate LL.B. Honours programme that thrives to this day.&lt;ref&gt; SOAS School of Law Student Handbook: 2009 &lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the Head of the Law School, Mashood Baderin, was appointed as Special Independent Expert to Sudan by the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.soas.ac.uk/news/newsitem75517.html|title=Professor Mashood Baderin appointed UN Independent Expert on human rights in the Sudan - SOAS University of London|website=www.soas.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013, Paul Kohler assumed the role as Head of the SOAS School of Law following the retirement of Baderin.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Academics==
The SOAS School of Law Honours [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LL.B.) programme is recognised as a Qualifying Law Degree by the [[Law Society of England and Wales]] and the [[Bar Council]] for the purposes of completing legal training. As such, the SOAS LL.B. satisfies all professional requirements for the [[Common Professional Examination]]. Admission is highly competitive with fewer than 80 available spaces each academic year.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Although many modules at SOAS embody a substantial element of English [[common law]], all modules are taught as far as possible in a comparative or international manner with an emphasis in the way in which law functions in society. Thus, law studies at SOAS are broad and comparative in their orientation. All students study a significant amount of non-English law, start in the first year of the LL.B. course, where 'Legal Systems of Asia and Africa' is compulsory. Specialised modules in the laws and legal systems of particular countries and regions is also encouraged and faculty experts conduct modules in these subjects every year.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Several combination BA degrees also allow students to combine law courses with another faculty, including history and politics. The SOAS School of Law also has a [[Master of Laws]] ([[LL.M.]]) which provides many advanced courses on comparative, international and transnational commercial law- all focused on Asian and African legal issues. The SOAS School of Law also offers a [[PhD]] programme.

In addition to academic programmes, SOAS School of Law students also have access to several Pro Bono law clinics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://l2b.thelawyer.com/soas-law-students-establish-international-human-rights-advocacy-network/|title=SOAS law students establish international human rights advocacy network - Lawyer 2B|website=l2b.thelawyer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Pro Bono law clinics offer students the opportunity to work alongside practising lawyers on actual cases involving human rights and civil rights which are taken on free of charge to the clients.

===Research===
The SOAS School of Law has expertise in the laws of Asian and African countries, [[human rights]], transnational [[commercial law]], [[environmental law]], and [[comparative law]].

It is home to the following research centres:
*Centre for East Asian Laws (CEAL)

*Centre for Ethnic Minority Studies (CEMS)
*Centre for Islamic and Middle Eastern Law (CIMEL). 

Faculty members routinely contribute to journals and publish volumes of leading research annually. The school has close ties with the internationally renowned [[Institute of Advanced Legal Studies]], which is also part of the federal [[University of London]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The SOAS School of Law was ranked 25th out of all British law schools by ''[[The Guardian]]'' League Table in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2017/may/16/university-league-tables-2018|title= league table for law|date=2017-09-21|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[QS World University Rankings]] placed SOAS in the 101-150 bracket in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2018/law-legal-studies&lt;/ref&gt; However, it should be noted that due to the highly specialised orientation and academic niche that the SOAS School of Law serves, a true comparison to other generalist institutions is impossible.

==SOAS Law Society==
The '''SOAS Law Society''' promotes opportunities to learn about the study of law and career options to student members at SOAS. The Law Society hosts meetings, intercollegiate exchanges, mooting tournaments and other educational events. Although there was formerly a separate '''SOAS Bar Society''' that conducted bar-related programming and organised moot teams and tournaments, it merged with the Law Society in 2013. Past moot teams fielded by the SOAS Law Society or SOAS Bar Society have participated in the annual English Law Students Association (ELSA) Moot Tournament and the prestigious [[London Universities Mooting Shield]], which was founded by SOAS Law School alumnus, barrister and present New York  attorney Daniel Jackson.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}
[[File:Amal Alamuddin Cannes 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Amal Clooney]] was a special lecturer on international criminal law.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6248">'''Selman Riza''' (1909–1988) was an [[Albanians|Albanian]] linguist and [[Albanologist]]. Riza was one of the founding members of the [[Albanological Institute of Pristina]] in 1953.

== Early life ==
Selman Riza was born in [[Yakova]] (now [[Gjakova]]), [[Ottoman Empire]] on 21 December 1909. In 1922 he migrated to Albania, where he first studied in the "Naim Frashëri" school. At the time of his graduation in 1925 he was honored as the best student of the school and gained a scholarship in the [[Albanian National Lyceum|National Lyceum of Korçë]] in 1925. As Riza graduated three years earlier than the regular duration of the studies the lyceum's director Leon Perre suggested him for the annual scholarship of the ministry of education. In 1931 he gained a scholarship in the [[University of Toulouse]], where in three years he graduated from both the faculties of French language and literature and that of law.&lt;ref name="Demiraj2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Demiraj|first=Bardhyl|title=Nach 450 Jahren: Buzukus "Missale" und seine Rezeption in unserer Zeit : 2. Deutsch-Albanische Kulturwissenschaftliche Tagung in München vom 14. bis 15. Oktober 2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qPtcT1oMeHAC&amp;pg=PA18|accessdate=7 July 2011|date=2007-06-18|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-05468-3|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he studied in the [[University of Heidelberg]], where he graduated from the faculty of German language. After returning to Albania he joined the faculty of the [[National Lyceum of Korçë]].

== Politics ==
After the [[Italian invasion of Albania]] protests were held in many parts of Albania. Selman Riza was arrested by the Italian authorities in the protest of Korçë held in the national day of Albania, on 28 November 1939. The documents of the town's fascist militia describe him as an anti-Italian activist, who disseminated antifascist material among his students. In 1940 Riza was arrested again and transferred to the [[Santo Stefano Island|Santo Stefano]] internment camp. In October 1941 he was released and moved to [[Durrës]] and in July 1942 to Kosovo, where he founded the ''Irredentist Antifascist Movement'', an anti-nazi and [[anticommunist]] organization. The manifesto of the organization was published in Tiranë in December 1943. In 1945 he returned to the city, but was arrested one day later by the [[Communism in Albania|Communist regime]]. Yugoslav authorities asked for his extradition, which was initially accepted but later the decision was overturned after the intervention of the minister of justice [[Manol Konomi]]. In 1948 a new extradition request was accepted and he was moved to Yugoslav prisons.&lt;ref name="Demiraj2007"/&gt; Riza was released in 1951, because he was heavily afflicted by [[scurvy]].

== Later life ==
After his release he co-founded the [[Albanological Institute of Pristina]] along with Ilhami Nimani, [[Mehdi Bardhi]], and Ali Rexha. In 1955 he returned to Albania and worked at the [[Albanian Institute of Linguistics and Literature|Institute of Linguistics and Literature]] in [[Tirana]] and the faculty of philology of the [[University of Tirana]].&lt;ref name="Demiraj2007"/&gt; In April 1967 he was again put to trial and as a result his writing and publishing rights were revoked. After being transferred to [[Berat]] his right to borrow books from the library was revoked too. Selman Riza died in 1988, while most of his works were published post-mortem. In 2005 [[Ibrahim Rugova]], [[President of Kosovo]], posthumously awarded him with the Golden Medal of the League of Prizren and in 2009 [[Fatmir Sejdiu]], his successor awarded Riza with the Golden Medal of Freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.president-ksgov.net/repository/docs/The_President_s_Activities,_No_07.pdf|title=President Sejdiu’s Speech at the Academy Celebrating the 100th Anniversary of the Birth of Professor Selman Riza|publisher=Office of the President of the Republic of Kosovo|accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==
In 1944 his commentary work on Albanological studies, titled ''Tri Monografina Albanologjike'', was published in Tiranë. His works' main subjects include variants of the [[Albanian language]] used in early Albanian literature, especially with [[Gjon Buzuku]]'s ''Meshari''.&lt;ref name="IglaBoretzky2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Igla|first1=Birgit|last2=Boretzky|first2=Norbert|last3=Stolz|first3=Thomas|title=Was ich noch sagen wollte|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9uUM5unig58C&amp;pg=PA43|accessdate=8 July 2011|date=2001-10-24|publisher=Akademie Verlag|isbn=978-3-05-003652-6|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1952 study on the Serbo-Croatian grammar is regarded as a work of [[contrastive analysis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shkenca.org/pdf/gjuhe/kontributi_i_s_rizes_ne_fushen_e_gramatikes.pdf|title= Me rastin e 95 vjetorit të lindjes, 1909-2004  - KONTRIBUTI I SELMAN RIZËS NË FUSHËN E GRAMATIKËS KONTRASTIVE|author=Agim Spahiu|accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Demiraj2007"/&gt; although that theory was not formulated until five years later by [[Robert Lado]].&lt;ref name="JohnsonJohnson1999"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Keith|last2=Johnson|first2=Helen|title=Encyclopedic dictionary of applied linguistics: a handbook for language teaching|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Qy-do1QP90C&amp;pg=PA86|accessdate=21 July 2011|date=1999-02-25|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-631-21482-3|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lucas Cranach the Elder - The Close of the Silver Age (?) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|''The Close of the Silver Age'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], c. 1527-35]]
A '''silver age''' is a name often given to a particular period within a history coming after a historical [[Golden Age (metaphor)|golden age]] whereby the Silver Age is a replication, being similarly prestigious and eventful but less so than the prior Golden Age. In many cultures the metal [[silver]] is generally valuable but less so than [[gold]].

==Greek myth==
The original silver age (Αργυρόν Γένος) was the second of the five "[[Ages of Man]]" described by the ancient poet [[Hesiod]] in his poem ''[[Works and Days]]'', following the [[Golden age]] and preceding the Bronze Age. These people lived for one hundred years as children without growing up, then suddenly aged and died. [[Zeus]] destroyed these people because of their impiety, in the [[Ogygian Deluge]].

After [[Cronus|Kronos]] was exiled, the world was ruled by Zeus. As a result of Pandora releasing the evils upon the world, a second generation of men and the age was called silver because the race of man was less noble than the race of the Golden Age.

In the silver age Zeus reduced the spring, and reconstructed the year into four seasons, so that men for the first time sought the shelter of houses and had to labor to supply their food.

The first seeds of grain were placed in the ground since now man had to gather their own food. A child grew up at his mother's side a hundred years, but adulthood lasted a short time. Being less noble than the Golden Age, humanity could not keep from fighting with one another, nor would they properly honor and or serve the immortals. The actions of the second generation infuriated Zeus, so in punishment he destroyed them.

==Other silver ages==
The term has been applied to a number of other periods following a "Golden Age", including:

* The [[Silver Age of Latin literature]]
* The [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], the 2000 DC Comics series ''[[Silver Age (DC Comics)|Silver Age]]'' was named after the period
* The [[Silver Age of Russian Poetry]]
* The [[Silver age of alpinism|Silver Age of Alpinism]]
* The [[Treta Yuga]] of Vedic philosophy of the ages.

'''Socialist law''' or '''Soviet law''' denotes a general type of [[legal system]] which has been used in [[communist state|socialist and formerly socialist states]]. It is based on the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system, with major modifications and additions from [[Marxist-Leninist]] ideology. There is controversy as to whether socialist law ever constituted a separate legal system or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=840224|pages=781–808|last1=Quigley|first1=J.|title=Socialist Law and the Civil Law Tradition|volume=37|issue=4|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|year=1989|doi=10.2307/840224}}&lt;/ref&gt; If so, prior to the end of the [[Cold War]], ''socialist law'' would be ranked among the major legal systems of the world.

While civil law systems have traditionally put great pains in defining the notion of [[private property]], how it may be acquired, transferred, or lost, socialist law systems provide for most property to be owned by the [[State (polity)|state]] or by agricultural co-operatives, and having special courts and laws for state enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Soviet-law|title=Soviet law|access-date=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars argue that socialist law was not a separate legal classification.&lt;ref name="austin"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.3.081806.112849|title=The Death of Socialist Law?|journal = Annual Review of Law and Social Science |volume = 3|issue = |pages = 233–253|last = Markovits |first = I.|date=December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[command economy]] approach of the communist states meant that most types of property could not be owned, the [[Soviet Union]] always had a civil code, courts that interpreted this civil code, and a civil law approach to legal reasoning (thus, both legal process and legal reasoning were largely analogous to the [[France|French]] or [[Germany|German]] civil code system). Legal systems in all socialist states preserved formal criteria of the Romano-Germanic civil law; for this reason, law theorists in post-socialist states usually consider the socialist law as a particular case of the Romano-Germanic civil law. Cases of development of [[common law]] into socialist law are unknown because of incompatibility of basic principles of these two systems (common law presumes influential rule-making role of courts while courts in socialist states play a dependent role).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Soviet-law|title=Soviet law|access-date=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet legal theory==
Soviet law displayed many special characteristics that derived from the socialist nature of the Soviet state and reflected [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] ideology. [[Vladimir Lenin]] accepted the Marxist conception of the law and the state as instruments of coercion in the hands of the bourgeoisie and postulated the creation of popular, informal tribunals to administer revolutionary justice. One of the main theoreticians of Soviet socialist legality in this early phase was [[Pēteris Stučka]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Alongside this [[utopian]] trend was one more critical of the concept of "[[proletarian]] justice", represented by [[Evgeny Pashukanis]]. A dictatorial trend developed that advocated the use of law and legal institutions to suppress all opposition to the regime. This trend reached its zenith under [[Joseph Stalin]] with the ascendancy of [[Andrey Vyshinsky]], when the administration of justice was carried out mainly by the security police in [[NKVD troika|special tribunals]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

During the [[de-Stalinization]] of the [[Nikita Khrushchev]] era, a new trend developed, based on socialist legality, that stressed the need to protect the procedural and statutory rights of citizens, while still calling for obedience to the state. New legal codes, introduced in 1960, were part of the effort to establish legal norms in administering laws. Although socialist legality remained in force after 1960, the dictatorial and utopian trends continued to influence the legal process. Persecution of political and religious dissenters continued, but at the same time there was a tendency to [[decriminalization|decriminalize]] lesser offenses by handing them over to people's courts and administrative agencies and dealing with them by education rather than by incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Elie |first=Marc |editor-last1=Kozlov |editor-first1=Denis |editor-last2=Gilburd |editor-first2=Eleonory  |date=2013 |title=The Thaw: Soviet Society and Culture during the 1950s and 1960s |publisher=Toronto University Press |pages=109{{hyphen}}142 |chapter=Khrushchev's Gulag: the Soviet Penitentiary System after Stalin's death, 1953-1964 |section-url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00859338/ |access-date=October 30, 2017 |isbn=978-1442644601 |id=HAL 00859338}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By late 1986, the [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] era was stressing anew the importance of [[individual rights]] in relation to the state and criticizing those who violated [[procedural law]] in implementing Soviet justice. This signaled a resurgence of socialist legality as the dominant trend. Socialist legality itself still lacked features associated with Western jurisprudence.

== Characteristic traits ==
Socialist law is similar to [[common law]] or [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] but with a greatly increased [[public law]] sector and decreased [[private law]] sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glenn|first=H. Patrick|title=Legal Traditions of the World: Sustainable Diversity in Law|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eERrPWIQn2kC&amp;pg=PA331&amp;dq=%22Socialist+law%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rQY-TPrODY6UjAf49cX5Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Socialist%20law%22&amp;f=false|edition= 4th |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-19-958080-4 |oclc=650838256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* extensive social warrants of the state (the rights to a job, free education, free healthcare, retirement at 60 for men and 55 for women, maternity leave, free disability benefits and sick leave compensation, subsidies to multichildren families, ...) in return for a high degree of social mobilization.
* the judicial process lacks [[adversarial system|adversary]] character; public prosecution is considered as "provider of justice."
* partial or total expulsion of the former [[ruling classes]] from the public life at early stages of existence of each socialist state; however, in all socialist states this policy gradually changed into the policy of "one socialist nation without classes"
* diversity of political views directly discouraged.
* the ruling Communist party was eventually subject to prosecution through party committees in first place.
* abolition of [[Private property#Socialist perspectives|private property]] considered as a primary goal of socialism, if not its defining characteristic, thus near total collectivization and nationalization of the means of production;
* subordination of the judiciary to the Communist Party
* low respect for [[privacy]], extensive control of the party over private life;
* low respect for [[intellectual property]] as knowledge and culture was considered a right for human kind, and not a privilege as in the free market economies.

A specific institution characteristic to Socialist law was the so-called [[burlaw court]] (or, verbally, "court of comrades", Russian товарищеский суд) which decided on minor offences.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Chinese Socialist law==
Among the remaining communist governments, some (most notably the [[People's Republic of China]]) have added extensive modifications to their legal systems. In general, this is a result of their [[free market|market-oriented]] economic changes. However, some communist influence can still be seen. For example, in Chinese [[real estate]] law there is no unified concept of [[real property]]; the state owns all land but often not the structures that sit on that land. A rather complex ''[[ad hoc]]'' system of [[use (law)|use rights]] to land property has developed, and these use rights are the things being officially traded (rather than the property itself). In some cases (for example in the case of [[city|urban]] residential property), the system results in something that resembles real property transactions in other legal systems.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

In other cases, the Chinese system results in something quite different. For example, it is a common misconception that reforms under [[Deng Xiaoping]] resulted in the [[privatization]] of agricultural land and a creation of a [[land tenure]] system similar to those found in [[Western world|Western]] countries. In actuality, the village committee owns the land and [[contract]]s the right to use this land to individual farmers who may use the land to make money from agriculture. Hence the rights that are normally unified in Western economies are split up between the individual farmer and the village committee.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

This has a number of consequences. One of them is that, because the farmer does not have an absolute right to transfer the land, he cannot borrow against his use rights. On the other hand, there is some insurance against risk in the system, in that the farmer can return his land to the village committee if he wants to stop farming and start some other sort of business. Then, if this business does not work, he can get a new contract with the village committee and return to farming. The fact that the land is redistributable by the village committee also ensures that no one is left landless; this creates a form of [[social welfare]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

There have been a number of proposals to reform this system and they have tended to be in the direction of fully privatizing rural land for the alleged purpose of increasing efficiency. These proposals have usually not received any significant support, largely because of the popularity of the current system among the farmers themselves. There is little risk that the village committee will attempt to impose a bad contract on the farmers, since this would reduce the amount of money the village committee receives. At the same time, the farmer has some flexibility to decide to leave farming for other ventures and to return at a later time.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

'''Temple rings''' (temporal rings) were part of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]], Scandinavian and others' medieval women's dress. Most were made of base metals such as copper alloys or iron, though silver and even gold were occasionally used. These were known as temple rings because they were worn on the head, near the temples of a woman or a girl.

A '''temple ring''' may also refer to an altar ring used in rites at a temple in [[Germanic paganism]].

==Slavic temple rings==
[[File:Flag of Rybolovskoe (Moscow oblast).png|thumb|Flag of Rybolovsk in [[Ramensky District]]]]
Temple rings were characteristic decorations of Slavic women. Different tribes had their own designs and they were made out of various metals. The rings were attached to a string that became part of a [[headdress]] or they were woven directly into [[braids]] of hair. The earliest archeological evidence of temple rings was found in the [[Catacomb culture]], [[Unetice culture]] and [[Karasuk culture]]. Later they were also found in the [[Chernoles culture]]. Temple rings were most popular between the 8th and 12th centuries, possibly influenced by the [[Arab culture|Arab]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] cultures. 

In later fashion styles, a temple ring was replaced by the [[kolt]] hanging from a [[ryasna]].

'''''The Gilded Cage''''' is an [[oil painting]] by [[Evelyn De Morgan]], with apparent stylistic influences of spatial representation from Surrealist modes of thought. It was her final work before her death in 1919. It is essentially an allegory for [[female]] hypnotic delirium.

In this painting, a woman "looks out" from what seems to be a window that may, in fact, be a scene from a mural painting within the greater composition with her hand stretched out and up in a gesture of yearning. She is looking at what may be compared to a group of [[Romani people|gypsy]] figures, [[Sun Dance|dancing under the open sky]].  The principal figure among the travelling group is a woman who dances while holding her baby close to her, thus otherwise suggesting the scene is representional for an altered-state vision of maternal duty.

Soaring free about the [[dancing]] group is a [[bird]], which contrasts sharply to the captive bird in the gilded cage that hangs beside the woman's older husband. The husband seems distraught at his wife's deteriorated - or "released" - state of mind.

He passed the [[Indian Civil Service]]s exam in 1871 and was appointed to what would become the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]] in India. He would go to serve between 1871–1900 in a variety of magisterial and executive positions including terms as district and sessions judge eventually retiring as commissioner in July 1900.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;

He also published two comprehensive volumes on Indian history, ''The Early History of India'' and ''The Oxford History of India''.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;

'''William Bernard''' (fl. 1849+) was a 19th-century [[sailor]], [[miner]] and resident of [[San Francisco]], better known as the notorious "Barnacle Bill" of [[United States|American]] yore whose fictional exploits are chronicled in the ribald [[drinking song]] "[[Barnacle Bill (song)|Barnacle Bill the Sailor]]" — itself adapted from "Bollocky Bill the Sailor", a traditional [[folk song]] originally titled "Abraham Brown".&lt;ref name="muse" &gt;Cray, Ed (1992). ''The Erotic Muse: American Bawdy Songs''. University of Illinois. {{ISBN|0-252-06789-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (Neither [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] [[comedy]] titled ''Barnacle Bill'' has anything to do with Bernard.)

Bernard first sailed into the [[San Francisco Bay]] aboard the ship ''Edward Everett'' on July 6, 1849, just as the [[California Gold Rush]] was heating up. Intent on striking it rich, he set out the next morning across the bay, accompanied by a shipmate named Mr. Phelps. They stopped first at present-day [[Yerba Buena Island]], where the treasure of a lost [[Spanish galleon]] was rumored by local sailors and dockworkers to be buried, but they found it deserted except for a small colony of [[domestic goat]]s. They did, however, discover the ruins of a large [[Ohlone|Tuchayune]] fishing [[village]] on the island's eastern shore, and reported seeing [[cremation]] pits strewn with human bones where the villagers ritually burned their dead. After camping for a few days on the small island, the two men moved on, exploring what is now [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] before heading to the [[gold mines]] to seek their fortunes.&lt;ref name="legend"&gt;Boyes, Marcia Edwards (1936). ''The Legend of Yerba Buena Island''. [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]: The Professional Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known about Bernard's fate. He returned to Yerba Buena Island at a later date, if only to [[Alcohol detoxification|dry out]], and lived there for a time before moving on again in search of fortune and fame.&lt;ref name="legend"/&gt;
