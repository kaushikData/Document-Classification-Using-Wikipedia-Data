Papua New Guinea law allows courts to take local customs and traditions into consideration in cases of abortion, so some medical practitioners in regions where local traditions allow abortion in cases of [[rape]] or [[incest]] may not face charges.&lt;ref name=UN /&gt;

==History==
Prior to the tribunal, cases were previously heard in the [[sheriff court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.journalonline.co.uk/News/1002392.aspx#.WzMf1qknbdc |title=President for new learning support tribunal |work=The Journal |publisher=Law Society of Scotland |date=24 October 2005 |accessdate=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tribunals were established in November 2005 by the [[Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004]].

'''Archibald Gordon''', M.D. (1812–1886) was a Scottish inspector-general of hospitals.

==Life==
Gordon studied medicine at [[Edinburgh University]], where he graduated M.D. in 1834. He entered the army as assistant-surgeon in 1836, served with the 53rd regiment in the [[Sutlej campaign]] of 1846, and in the [[Punjab campaign]] of 1848-9 with the 24th regiment. He became surgeon in 1848, and surgeon-major in 1854.

In the [[Crimea War]] he was principal medical officer of the 2nd division throughout the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855)|siege of Sebastopol]], and was made deputy-inspector-general of hospitals (1856), C.B., and a [[Chevalier of the Legion of Honor]]. In 1857 he served as principal medical officer with the expeditionary force to China in the [[Second Opium War]], and in the [[Oudh campaign of 1858-9]]. He became inspector-general in 1867, and retired in 1870. He was also honorary surgeon to the queen.

He died at [[West Hoathly]], Sussex, on 3 August 1886.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1813">'''CBHS Health Fund''' is an Australian private health insurance company founded on January 1, 1951 by the [[Commonwealth Bank of Australia]] (CBA) to provide insurance to its employees. Membership was expanded in August 1996 to include former employees.

==Description==
The organization changed its name to the  CBHS Friendly Society that same year, and it became independent of the bank. The name was changed again in 2007 to CBHS Health Fund Limited, and coverage was offered to family members of current and former employees starting in 2007. Contractors and franchise holders of CBA Group became eligible for membership in 2014. CBHS is a member of Private Healthcare Australia, formerly known as the Australian Health Insurance Association.

In 2016, data for CBHS customers was stolen from a marketing and member communications contractor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.itnews.com.au/news/attackers-exploiting-cba-health-fund-data-breach-439154|title=Attackers exploiting CBA health fund data breach|last=Coyne|first=Allie|date=11 October 2016|work=itnews|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-13/hackers-steal-personal-information-from-bank-health-fund/7929542|title=Hackers steal personal information from Commonwealth Bank's health fund|last=Sturmer|first=Jake|date=13 October 2016|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4355">The '''Campbell Shopping Complex fire''' was a major disaster in [[Malaysia]] which took place on 8 April 1976 at Jalan Campbell (now Jalan Dang Wangi), [[Kuala Lumpur]]. The entire shopping complex including its 20-storey office tower block was completely destroyed in a fire.&lt;ref name=Travel&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rRCJAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50|page=50|title=Insider's Kuala Lumpur (3rd Edn): Is No Ordinary Travel Guide. Open Your Eyes to the Soul of the City (Not Just the Twin Towers...)|first=Lam Seng|last=Fatt|publisher=Marshall Cavendish International Asia Pte Ltd|year=2011|ISBN=9814435392}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Malaysia's first towering inferno{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} and its worst fire disaster involving a high-rise building to date.&lt;ref name=Headline/&gt; The fire, which started at 10:30 pm, lasted for nearly 30 hours, claiming the life of one victim, Yap Leong Hoe, 59,&lt;ref name=Inferno/&gt; as well as the total losses of RM50 million. The cause of the fire was an electrical [[short circuit]].&lt;ref name=Headline/&gt; Ultimately, 156 shops and 41 offices were destroyed.&lt;ref name=Travel/&gt;

The building burnt for nearly 30 hours and did not collapse entirely, although one section of the podium collapsed due to the intense heat.

== History ==
The Campbell Shopping Complex itself was opened in May 1973,&lt;ref name=Inferno/&gt; which was at that time Kuala Lumpur's first high-rise shopping complex.&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt; It was kept under repair and reconstructed at a cost of RM10 million&lt;ref name=Travel/&gt; for a few years after the blaze before it was reopened to the public around 1979.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Interesting Facts==
* The incident occurred at a time when the Hollywood blockbuster movie ''[[The Towering Inferno]]'' was still fresh in the minds of many Malaysians.&lt;ref name=Travel/&gt;
* The [[Fire Protection Association of Malaysia]] (FPAM) was formed the same year after the incident occurred.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}
* The incident also highlighted the standards of fire safety in high-rise buildings in the country as well as the limited fire-fighting capabilities at that time.Laws were eventually passed to ensure that high-rise premises must meet certain standards of fire safety, e.g., the issuing of certificates before they can be deemed fit for dwelling or commercial purposes.&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt;
* There was even a proposal to have the tower block of the complex demolished shortly after the fire because it was initially thought that the intense heat from the blaze might have weakened the reinforced concrete structure of the building thus posing a hazard. However, this was averted after examinations done by competent engineers proved otherwise.&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt;
* According to some eyewitnesses, the blaze was visible from as far as [[Petaling Jaya]] in [[Selangor]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

'''Chew Valley Lake''' ({{gbmapping|ST5659}}) is a large [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]] in the [[Chew Valley]], [[Somerset]], [[England]], and the fifth-largest artificial lake in the United Kingdom (the largest in south-west England), with an area of 1,200&amp;nbsp;acres (4.9&amp;nbsp;km²). The lake, created in the early 1950s and opened by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1956, provides much of the [[drinking water]] for the city of [[Bristol]] and surrounding area, taking its supply from the [[Mendip Hills]]. Some of the water from the lake is used to maintain the flow in the [[River Chew]].

Before the lake was created, archaeological investigations were carried out that showed evidence of occupation since [[Neolithic]] times and included [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] artefacts. The lake is an important site for wildlife and has been designated a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI) and a [[Special Protection Area]] (SPA). It is a national centre for [[birdwatching]], with over 260 species recorded. The lake has indigenous and migrant water birds throughout the year, and two nature trails have been created. The [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] provide [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]] for some less common plants and insects.

Some restricted use for recreational activities is permitted by the owner, [[Bristol Water]], including [[dinghy sailing]] and fishing, primarily for [[trout]].

== Location ==
Chew Valley Lake is in the [[Chew Valley]] at the northern edge of the [[Mendip Hills]], surrounded by meadows and woods and close to the villages of [[Chew Stoke]], [[Chew Magna]] and [[Bishop Sutton]]. When it was built in the 1950s, its 1,200&amp;nbsp;acres (4.9&amp;nbsp;km²) were flooded with 4,500&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;imperial gallons (20,000,000&amp;nbsp;m³) of water from the Mendip hills,&lt;ref name="bw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bristolwater.co.uk/leisure/chewIndex.asp |title=Chew Valley Introduction |publisher=Bristol Water |accessdate=14 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706120237/http://www.bristolwater.co.uk/leisure/chewIndex.asp |archivedate= 6 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a catchment area of 14,000&amp;nbsp;acres (57&amp;nbsp;km²).&lt;ref name=riverchew&gt;{{cite web|title=Chew Valley Lake |url=http://www.riverchew.co.uk/chew_valley_lake.htm |website=River Chew |publisher=Jason Allen |accessdate=23 December 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227161748/http://www.riverchew.co.uk/chew_valley_lake.htm |archivedate=27 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is shallow, with an average depth of 14&amp;nbsp;ft (4&amp;nbsp;m) at top level and a maximum depth of just 37&amp;nbsp;ft (11&amp;nbsp;m). It is fed by small rivers, and it flows into the [[River Chew]] for 17&amp;nbsp;miles (27&amp;nbsp;km) before it joins the [[River Avon, Bristol|Avon]] to head out to sea. The deepest part is near the dam and the outlet tower, where the steeply sloping shores of Walley Bank and the north shore result in depths of up to 20&amp;nbsp;ft (6&amp;nbsp;m).&lt;ref name=riverchew/&gt; "Denny Island", above the surface throughout the year, is wooded and provides a habitat for wildlife.

The lake is owned and operated by Bristol Water, which created it in 1956 when the demand became too large for nearby [[Blagdon Lake]]. Working with the [[Avon Wildlife Trust]], [[Somerset Wildlife Trust]] and other environmental groups, Bristol Water has encouraged various species of birds and plants, and created a venue for visitors.&lt;ref name="bw"/&gt;

It has two landscaped picnic areas. Facilities include a [[tea shop]], with indoor and outdoor seating areas with a view of the lake, and information centre. There are a souvenir shop and small art gallery&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Gallery |url=http://www.chewvalleyart.co.uk/ |accessdate=4 January 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060102212053/http://www.chewvalleyart.co.uk/ |archivedate= 2 January 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and two nature trails. The Grebe Trail&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grebe Nature Trail |work=Bristol Water Leisure Guide |url=http://www.bristol-water.co.uk/leisure/chewNature-grebe.asp |accessdate=3 January 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821003315/http://www.bristol-water.co.uk/leisure/chewNature-grebe.asp |archivedate=21 August 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a hard-surfaced, all-weather path suitable for pedestrians, pushchairs and wheelchairs and covers a circuit 0.75&amp;nbsp;miles (1.2&amp;nbsp;km) long, starting and finishing at the wooded picnic area. The Bittern Trail&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bittern Nature Trail |work=Bristol Water Leisure Guide |url=http://www.bristol-water.co.uk/leisure/chewNature-bittern.asp |accessdate=3 January 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827162237/http://www.bristol-water.co.uk/leisure/chewNature-bittern.asp |archivedate=27 August 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is reached from the Grebe Trail by the footbridge over Hollow Brook. The grassy path is often waterlogged in winter, but there is a boardwalk over a short section. The trail runs along the east shore, visits an open bird hide and returns to the footbridge, making a 1-mile (1.5-kilometre) circuit. Bristol Water imposes conditions on visitors, particularly related to the areas where dogs are allowed.

== Access and transportation ==
[[File:Wodford Lodge, Chew Valley Lake.jpg|thumb|Woodford Lodge and part of the sailing club]]
Access to the waterside is restricted in places to reduce the disruption to wildlife. Paths around the lake are generally flat and, where paths are surfaced, wheelchair access is possible.

Visitors are officially invited to use public transport, but overwhelmingly arrive by private car, encouraged by the provision of parking spaces. The "Chew Valley Explorer" bus route 672/674 provides access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Changes to Chew Valley Explorer | work=Evening Post | publisher=This is Bristol | url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/Changes-Chew-Valley-Explorer/article-1009122-detail/article.html | accessdate=9 April 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130114015703/http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/Changes-Chew-Valley-Explorer/article-1009122-detail/article.html | archivedate=14 January 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 a 1.9-mile (3-kilometre) safe cycle route, the Chew Lake West Green Route, was opened along the B3114 on the western part of the lake. It forms part of the [[Padstow]] to [[Bristol]] West Country Way, [[National Cycle Network]] [[NCR 3|Route 3]]. It has all-weather surfacing, providing a smooth off-road facility for ramblers, mobility-challenged visitors and cyclists of all abilities. It was funded by [[Bath and North East Somerset]] Council with the support of [[Sustrans]] and the Chew Valley Recreational Trail Association. Minor roads around the lake are also frequently used by cyclists.

[[Bristol Airport]] is approximately 10&amp;nbsp;miles (15&amp;nbsp;km) away. The nearest major road is the [[A368 road|A368]], which runs along the southern edge of the lake and provides access from [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] and [[Weston super Mare]]. The [[A37 road|A37]] and [[A38 road|A38]] are slightly further away, providing access from [[Bristol]]. Car parking is available at the visitor centre and Woodford Lodge, for which a charge is made, and a small amount of parking is available at points around the lake; some of these are restricted to those with fishing permits.

== History ==
[[Image:Chewvalleylakeplaque.JPG|left|thumb|alt=plague with text commemorating the visit of Queen Elixabeth II|Plaque unveiled by Queen Elizabeth II in 1956]]The area the lake covers was once rich farmland. Farms and houses had to be removed before the land was flooded, and old roads, hedgerows and tree stumps can reappear when dry summers cause the level of the lake to drop. Prior to the flooding of the [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]], [[archaeology|archaeological]] [[excavation (archaeology)|excavations]] were carried out by [[Philip Rahtz]] and [[Ernest Greenfield]] employed by the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]], from 1953 to 1955. The excavations found evidence of people belonging to the consecutive periods known as [[Upper Palaeolithic]], [[Mesolithic]] and [[Neolithic]] (Old, Middle and New [[Stone Age]]), [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]], including implements such as stone knives, [[flint]] blades and the head of a [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]], along with buildings and graves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dunning |first=Robert |title=A History of Somerset |year=1983 |publisher=Phillimore &amp; Co |location=Chichester |isbn=0-85033-461-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] from this period are held at [[Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery]].&lt;ref name="ross"&gt;{{cite book | author = Ross, Lesley (Ed.)| year = 2004 | title = Before the Lake: Memories of the Chew Valley | publisher = The Harptree Historic Society | isbn=0-9548832-0-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further evidence of Neolithic and Bronze Age occupation is provided by the archaeological survey of the [[Mendip Hills]] Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.&lt;ref name=survey&gt;{{cite web|title=Mendip Hills An Archaeological Survey of the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty |work=Somerset County Council Archaeological Projects |url=http://www1.somerset.gov.uk/archives/hes/downloads/HES_MendipAONB.pdf |accessdate=16 January 2011 |format=PDF |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516154619/http://www1.somerset.gov.uk/archives/hes/downloads/HES_MendipAONB.pdf |archivedate=16 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Excavations have also uncovered Roman remains, indicating agricultural and industrial activity from the second half of the first century to third century AD. The finds included a [[Roman villa|villa]] at Chew Park&lt;ref name=survey/&gt; where wooden writing tablets (the first in the UK) with [[ink]] writing were found. The tablets were sent to the [[British Museum]], but other Roman material is on display at the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery with the lake's other historical artefacts.&lt;ref name="ross" /&gt;

Further excavations around the village of Moreton, which has now been totally submerged, found evidence of a thriving community in [[medieval]] times and possibly the remains of the [[Nunnery]] of Santa Cruz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Hucker, Ernest| year = 1997 | title = Chew Stoke Recalled in Old Photographs|publisher = Ernest Hucker|id = }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Middle Ages]] farming was the most important activity in the area covered by the lake, supported by four [[flour mill]]s powered by the River Chew. Stratford Mill was demolished and re-erected in the grounds of [[Blaise Castle]] Museum, in north-west Bristol. The largest settlement was Moreton, which is listed in the [[Domesday Book]] and survived until the flooding of the lake, when the remains of the Moreton Cross were moved to [[Chew Stoke]] Parish Church. There is evidence of [[Limekiln|lime kilns]], which were used in the production of mortar for the construction of local churches. Farming, both [[arable land|arable]] and [[dairy farming|dairy]], continued until the flooding of the lake, with most households also keeping pigs. There were [[orchard]]s for fruit production, including apples, pears and [[plum]]s.&lt;ref name="ross" /&gt; Moreton was also the site of [[gunpowder]] mill in the 18th century.&lt;ref name=body&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=__Q6AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT100&amp;lpg=PT100&amp;dq=Littleton+gunpowder&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oyK7d0gtCF&amp;sig=BYx1b5btgcaZ1MVx4wF1T_CsDpM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3wrmmmZ3KAhVGPxQKHdv0ClgQ6AEIQTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Littleton%20gunpowder&amp;f=false|last1=Body|first1=Geoffrey|title=The A-Z of Curious Somerset|date=2013|publisher=The History Press|isbn=9780752493299|pages=84–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reservoir ===
[[Image:CVLdam.JPG|thumb|744px|center|alt=Photograph showing the white coloured dam running horizontally across the picture with water and vegetation in the foreground and hills behind|Chew Valley Lake dam]]
[[Image:Chewpumpingstation.JPG|thumb|alt=White concrete single story building, with vegetation around|Pumping Station]]
Plans for the building of the reservoir were under discussion before the [[Second World War]], and an [[Act of Parliament]] submitted by the Bristol Waterworks Company was passed in 1939. Following this, farms were bought by the company and farmed by the previous owners as tenancies. Farms and buildings still remaining in private hands were acquired by [[compulsory purchase]]. The sanction for construction was given in 1949 and the contract awarded to A.E. Farr, who employed 300 people on the site. The main dam was stabilised by injecting concrete into the cracks in the [[bedrock]]. The core of the dam was made of [[puddling (engineering)|puddled]] [[clay]] mixed with [[sand]]. This was the first time the gain in strength brought about by the use of sand drains had been quantified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Skempton, A.W. | year = 1984 | title = Selected Papers on Soil Mechanics|publisher = Thomas Telford|isbn=0-7277-0205-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lake was inaugurated by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], accompanied by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]], with the unveiling of a commemorative stone and plaque, which can be seen from the dam, on 17 April 1956, although it was not full until 25 February 1958.&lt;ref name="ross" /&gt; Flowers were presented to the Queen at the opening of Chew Valley Lake by Judith Blair Brown, daughter of Kennedy Brown, who worked at Bristol Water Works at the time of construction of the lake.

During the [[Chew Stoke flood of 1968|storm of 10 July 1968]], the lake gained an extra 471&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;imperial gallons (2,140,000&amp;nbsp;m³) and rose 19&amp;nbsp;inches (480&amp;nbsp;mm) in under 12&amp;nbsp;hours. At one point worried [[Bristol City Police|Bristol police]] issued a warning that the dam might not hold, prompting localised evacuation of populated valley areas downstream including [[Pensford]] and [[Keynsham]].&lt;ref name="ea"&gt;{{cite book|last=Richley|first=Rob|title=The Chew Valley floods of 1968|publisher=Environment Agency|location=Exeter|date=June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecology ==
[[Image:Herriotts06-04.jpg|thumb|center|alt=photograph of the lake showing a road crossing via a causeway at Herriots Bridge. It is surrounded by green vegetation with hills in the distance|744px|Herriot's Bridge]]

The lake is designated a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chew Valley Lake |url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1002553.pdf |website=SSSI Citation |publisher=Natural England |accessdate=23 December 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924131553/http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1002553.pdf |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Special Protection Area]] (SPA) (Site Code: UK9010041) largely because of the diversity of species and habitats. Providing further protection, much of the area around the lake also falls within the [[Mendip Hills]] [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] (AONB).

The lake appears to have a higher sedimentation rate than would be expected in other similar reservoirs, being in the region of 100–150&amp;nbsp;t.km&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=R.S.|first2=M.

=== Geology ===
The main geological outcrops around the lake are [[mudstone]], largely consisting of red [[siltstone]] resulting in the underlying characteristic of the gently rolling valley landscape. Bands of [[sandstone]] from the [[Triassic]] period contribute to the undulating character of the area. There are also more recent [[alluvial]] deposits beside the course of the River Chew.&lt;ref name="banes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Area 2: Chew Valley |url=http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/sites/default/files/rural_landscapes_-_chapter_7.pdf |publisher=Bath and North East Somerset |pages=26–29 |accessdate=23 December 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202180741/http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/sites/default/files/rural_landscapes_-_chapter_7.pdf |archivedate= 2 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Birds ===
[[Image:Mallard in flight.jpg|alt=Bird with wings forward. Yellow bill, green head with white collar, brown body with blue wing feathers and orange feet.|thumb|Drake in flight on Chew Valley Lake]]
Over 260 species of birds have been recorded at Chew,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Birdwatching |url=http://www.bristolwater.co.uk/leisure/birdwatching-information.asp |publisher=Bristol Water |accessdate=12 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716064532/http://www.bristolwater.co.uk/leisure/birdwatching-information.asp |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; an internationally important site for wintering and migrating wildfowl. From late July to February, up to 4,000 [[duck]]s (Anatidae) of twelve different species may be present, including internationally important numbers of [[northern shoveler]] (''Anas clypeata'') and [[gadwall]] (''Anas strepera''). Up to 600 [[great crested grebe]]s (''Podiceps cristatus'') gather to moult on the lake in autumn.&lt;ref name="cvlbirding"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chew Valley Lake Birding |url=http://www.cvlbirding.co.uk/ |accessdate=3 January 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230173501/http://www.cvlbirding.co.uk/ |archivedate=30 December 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Data on bird species and their numbers on the lake, dating back to the first "[[Bird ringing|ringing]]" in 1964, is available from the Chew Valley Ringing Station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chew Valley Ringing Station |url=http://www.chewvalleyringingstation.co.uk/ |accessdate=6 January 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130185750/http://www.chewvalleyringingstation.co.uk/ |archivedate=30 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous other birds can be seen, especially during the spring and autumn [[bird migration|migration]]. [[Sand martin]]s (''Riparia riparia'') arrive early and can usually be seen hawking over the water for insects in the second or third week of March. Flocks of [[titmouse|tits]] (Paridae), [[Hirundinidae|swallows]] (Hirundinidae) and [[terns]] (Sternidae) can regularly be seen. Waders, such as [[northern lapwing|lapwings]] (''Vanellus vanellus''), [[dunlin]] (''Calidris alpina'') and [[common snipe]] (''Gallinago gallinago''), are attracted to the muddy shores if the water level drops in autumn. By midwinter up to 55,000 [[gull]]s, mostly [[black-headed gull]] (''Chroicocephalus ridibundus'') and [[common gull]] (''Larus canus''), may be roosting. Good numbers of [[reed warbler]]s (''Acrocephalus scirpaceus'') and [[sedge warbler]]s (''A. schoenobaenus'') nest in the fringing reeds, along with [[grebes]] (Podicipedidae) and [[Eurasian coot]]s (''Fulica atra'').&lt;ref name="cvlbirding" /&gt;

Much of the management work carried out in the nature reserve is aimed at encouraging ducks to breed, and small numbers of [[tufted duck]] (''Aythya fuligula''), [[common pochard]] (''Aythya ferina''), [[common shelduck]] (''Tadorna tadorna'') and [[gadwall]] raise broods most years. Recent breeding successes also include [[water rail]] (''Rallus aquaticus'') and [[Cetti's warbler]] (''Cettia cetti'').&lt;ref name="cvlbirding" /&gt;

A wetland reserve has been created at Heron's Green Pool on the opposite side of the causeway to the lake. A shallow pool fringed with [[Cyperaceae|sedges]] (Cyperaceae), [[Juncaceae|rushes]] (Juncaceae) and [[Calamagrostis|reedgrasses]] (''Calamagrostis'') and surrounded by lightly grazed, rough [[grassland]] may also prove attractive to snipe and lapwings.

=== Fish ===
In late summer large shoals of [[common roach|roach]] (''Rutilus rutilus'') and [[perch]] (''Perca fluviatilis'') fry congregate around the margins and weed beds, which are predated by the brown trout ([[Salmo trutta fario|''Salmo trutta'' morpha ''fario'']]) and [[rainbow trout]] (''Oncorhynchus mykiss'').&lt;ref name="fishing"&gt;{{cite web | title=Fishing information] | work=Bristol Waters | url=http://eis.bris.ac.uk/~cckhrb/BW/chew.htm | accessdate=4 January 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051228193850/http://eis.bris.ac.uk/~cckhrb/BW/chew.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 28 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chew Valley also holds a large population of [[northern pike|pike]] (''Esox lucius''), and fishing for these is permitted at certain times of the year.

=== Insects ===
[[Chironomidae|Aquatic midges]] (Chironomidae) provide the highest proportion of the fly life of the lake. The [[trout]] (Salmonidae) will feed at the surface on these and [[Corixidae|water boatmen]] (Corixidae), and below the surface on the [[caddisfly]] (Trichoptera) [[larva]]e and [[pupa]]e; they will also take the adult caddisflies when they emerge. Other aquatic fauna including ''[[daphnia]]'' and [[snail]]s are also found in the lake.&lt;ref name="awt"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chew Valley Lake Information |work=Avon Wildlife Trust |url=http://www.avonwildlifetrust.org.uk/reserves/chew_valley.htm |accessdate=3 January 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031000510/http://www.avonwildlifetrust.org.uk/reserves/chew_valley.htm |archivedate=31 October 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large populations of [[dragonflies]], including [[migrant hawker]] (''Aeshna mixta'') and significant numbers of [[ruddy darter]] (''Sympetrum sanguineum''), occur at the lake. Eleven species of wainscot [[moth]] make their home in the reed beds, including the nationally local brown-veined wainscot (''Archanara dissoluta''), twin-spotted wainscot (''Archanara geminipuncta'') and silky wainscot (''Chilodes maritimus'').&lt;ref name="cvlbirding"/&gt;

=== Vegetation ===
The lake is surrounded with fringing [[reedbed]]s, [[carr (fen)|carr woodland]] and [[grassland]], which are managed by [[Bristol Water]]. The water conditions are [[eutrophic]] with run off from local fields and streams. Open-water plant communities are rather sparse, largely comprising [[Potamogeton|fennel pondweed]] (''Potamogeton pectinatus''), [[Potamogeton|lesser pondweed]] (''Potamogeton pusillus''), [[Groenlandia|opposite-leaved pondweed]] (''Groenlandia densa'') and [[Ranunculus|water-crowfoot]] (''Ranunculus spp.''). On neutral soils around the reservoir, [[pepper-saxifrage]] (''Silaum silaus''), [[saxifrage|burnet-saxifrage]] (''Pimpinella saxifraga'') and [[scabious|devil's-bit scabious]] (''Succisa pratensis'') occur, and on calcareous soils fairy [[flax]] (''Linum catharticum''), [[Cirsium|dwarf thistle]] (''Cirsium acaule'') and [[salad burnet]] (''Sanguisorba minor'' subspecies ''minor'') are found.&lt;ref name="awt" /&gt;

The small and medium-sized fields around the lake are generally bounded by hedges and occasionally by tree belts and woodland, some of which date back to the most evident period of enclosure of earlier open fields which took place in the late medieval period. Mature [[oak]] (''Quercus'') and [[ash tree|ash]] (''Fraxinus excelsior'') trees are characteristic of the area with occasional groups of [[Scots pine]] (''Pinus sylvestris'') and [[chestnut]]s (''Castanea sativa''). Many [[elm]] (''Ulmus'') trees have been lost in this area, and dead/dying elms are also evident in the surrounding landscape.&lt;ref name="banes" /&gt;

Four areas of woodland containing 157 trees has been planted by The Life for a Life Charity around the lake on the Restaurant side, for the cremated remains of loved ones to be placed beneath them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifeforalife.org.uk/locations/find?site=16 |title=Chew Valley Lake |publisher=Life for a Life |accessdate=23 December 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715142045/http://www.lifeforalife.org.uk/locations/find?site=16 |archivedate=15 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These forests contain [[Scots pine]] (''Pinus sylvestris''), [[English oak]] (''Quercus robur''), [[rowan]] (''Sorbus aucuparia'') and the [[silver birch]] (''Betula pendula'').

== Leisure use ==
The lake is used for a wide variety of leisure pursuits.

=== Birdwatching ===
[[Image:Pic herriots pool.jpg|thumb|alt=Expanse of water with white birds. Trees and hills in the background|Birds on Chew Valley Lake taken from Herriott's Bridge]]

During 2005–2006 Bristol Water started restoring two artificial islands. These are intended to provide safe nesting and roosting sites for a range of wildfowl. Permits to enter the reservoir enclosure and to use the access roads, paths and bird hides are available (for a fee) only to members of ornithological and naturalist societies recognised by Bristol Water. They can be obtained from Woodford Lodge and include conditions of use imposed by the owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bristolwater.co.uk/leisure/birdwatching-information.asp |title=Birdwatching |publisher=Bristol Water |accessdate=21 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828052653/http://www.bristolwater.co.uk/leisure/birdwatching-information.asp |archivedate=28 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sailing ===
[[File:Sailing on Chew Valley Lake.webm|thumb|Boats sailing on the lake]]
Chew Valley Lake Sailing Club has a sailing area, approximately 1.9&amp;nbsp;miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) long, for [[dinghy sailing]]. The lake is divided into two areas: a restricted summer area which is available during the fishing season (mid-March to mid-October), and the full area which can be used throughout the winter and on Sunday afternoons. The sailing area is marked out by lines of small white buoys. Racing marks are red buoys with flags, although large inflatable marks are used of open events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chewvalleysailing.org.uk/lake-plan |title=Lake plan |publisher=Chew Valley Sailing Club |accessdate=17 September 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624051431/http://www.chewvalleysailing.org.uk/lake-plan |archivedate=24 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club can cater for fleets of over one hundred boats and it hosts large national events. Normal club racing has fleet starts for the following dinghy classes: [[Flying Fifteen (keelboat)]], [[Laser (dinghy)]], [[Solo (dinghy)]] and [[Topper (dinghy)]] as well as a handicap fleet run under the [[Portsmouth yardstick]] scheme. Five slipways enable easy launching. Off the water, the clubhouse facilities include large changing rooms, hot showers, hot food at the weekends, a bar and terrace overlooking the lake. The club caters for disabled people with facilities on both floors and a lift. [[Royal Yachting Association]] sailing courses are held at the club for members including race training, youth training, powerboat training, race officer training as well as more informal training run within each fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chewvalleysailing.org.uk/training/other-training |title=RYA Training |publisher=Chew Valley Sailing Club |accessdate=17 September 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624052001/http://www.chewvalleysailing.org.uk/training/other-training |archivedate=24 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fishing ===
Seasonal day and afternoon bank fishing permits are available at Woodford Lodge. The restrictions imposed by Bristol Water mean that no fishing is allowed from the dams or stone [[Dike (construction)|embankments]], the sailing club, in front of Stratford bird hide, in front of the [[picnic]] areas and in the [[nature reserve]]. There is a fleet of 32 motor boats for hire to fish.&lt;ref name="fishing" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3284">'''Circumsporozoite protein''' (CSP) is a secreted [[protein]] of the [[sporozoite]] stage of the [[malaria]] parasite (''[[Plasmodium]]'' sp.) and is the [[antigen]]ic target of [[RTS,S]], a pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine currently undergoing clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Porter|first=Michael|author2=Jennifer Nicki |author3=Christopher Pool |title=Transgenic Parasites Stably Expressing Full-Length Plasmodium falciparum Circumsporozoite Protein as a Model for Vaccine Down-Selection in Mice Using Sterile Protection as an Endpoint|journal=Clinical and Vaccine Immunology|date=June 2013|volume=20|issue=6|pages=803–810|url=http://cvi.asm.org/content/20/6/803.long|doi=10.1128/cvi.00066-13|pmc=3675977}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The amino-acid sequence of CSP consists of an immunodominant central repeat region flanked by conserved motifs at the [[N-terminus|N-]] and [[C-terminus|C-]] termini that are implicated in protein processing as the parasite travels from the mosquito to the mammalian vector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aldrich|first=Cassandra|author2=Alessandro Magini |author3=Carla Emiliani |title=Roles of the Amino Terminal Region and Repeat Region of the Plasmodium berghei Circumsporozoite Protein in Parasite Infectivity|journal=PLOS ONE|date=February 2012|volume=7|issue=2|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0032524|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0032524|pages=e32524|pmid=22393411|pmc=3290588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure and function of CSP is highly conserved across the various strains of malaria that infect humans, non-human primates and rodents.  It can first be detected in large quantities as sporozoites are forming within [[oocyst]]s residing in the midgut walls of infected mosquitoes.  Upon egression from mature oocysts, sporozoites begin migrating to the salivary glands, and CSP is known to be an important mediator of this process.  Additionally, CSP is involved in [[hepatocyte]] binding in the mammalian host. Here, the N-terminus and central repeat region initially facilitate parasite binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rathore|first=Dharmendar|author2=John B.

CSP is an approximately 42 [[Kilodalton|kD]] soluble protein and can readily be made using an ''[[E. coli]]'' [[expression system]].

The '''Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000''' ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/37/contents c 37]), known as the '''CRoW Act''' is a [[United Kingdom]] [[Act of Parliament]] affecting England and Wales which came into force on 30 November 2000.

==Right to roam==
The Act implements the so-called "[[right to roam]]" (also known as ''jus spatiandi'') long sought by the [[Ramblers' Association]] and its predecessors, on certain upland and uncultivated areas of England and Wales. This element of the act was implemented in stages as [[Definitive Map|definitive maps]] of different regions were produced. The act refers to areas of '[[mountain]], [[moorland|moor]], [[heath (habitat)|heath]] and [[downland|down]]' in addition to registered [[common land]]; not all uncultivated land is covered.
==Rights of way==
A staged review of [[public rights of way]], including limited rights to create new [[Public footpath (England and Wales)|public footpaths]] where needed, is being conducted under the Act. Again, this is being conducted in a staged manner, which can produce anomalies – of the two administrative areas of the County of Gloucestershire, South Gloucestershire was revised in the Southern area and the rest of [[Gloucestershire]] in the Midlands.

Some long-standing areas of dispute became accessible under the Act — these include [[Chrome Hill]] and [[Parkhouse Hill]] in the [[Peak District]].

==Nature conservation==
The Countryside and Rights of Way Act also made some changes in respect of nature conservation, in particular to Part I of the [[Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981]]. The three main changes are: the maximum penalty is now a term of imprisonment instead of a fine; the Secretary of State can designate "wildlife inspectors" who have a range of powers under the Act; offences of disturbing certain birds and animals are extended so as to cover reckless as well as intentional acts.

The act gave power to create local access forums (commonly referred to as 'LAFs'), comprising a balance of user, landowner and other interests, to give advice on development of access land and of the path network; the policy of footpath improvement would be set out in a Rights of Way Improvement Plan (RoWIP). (see for example http://www.jlaf.org.uk which covers a large part of the former Avon area).

==Scotland==
A more ambitious [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]] was enacted by the [[Scottish Parliament]] which formalised the Scottish tradition of unhindered access to open countryside, provided that care is taken not to cause damage or interfere with activities including farming and game stalking.

Cumulative learning is the cognitive process by which we accumulate knowledge and abilities that serve as building blocks for subsequent cognitive development.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4419-1428-6_1660|title=Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning|first=JungMi|last=Lee|editor-first=Prof Dr Norbert M.|editor-last=Seel|date=1 January 2012|publisher=Springer US|pages=887–893|accessdate=3 June 2016|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-1428-6_1660}}&lt;/ref&gt; A very simple example is the saying 'you can't run before you can walk'; the [[procedural memory]] built while learning to walk is necessary before one can start to learn to run. Pronouncing words is impossible without first learning to pronounce the vowels and consonants that make them up (hence babies' [[babbling]]).

This is an essential cognitive capacity, allowing prior development to produce new foundations for further cognitive development. Cumulative learning consolidates the knowledge one has obtained through experiences, allowing it to be reproduced and exploited for subsequent learning situations through cumulative interaction between prior knowledge and new information.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Arguably, all learning is cumulative learning, as all learning depends on previous learning&lt;ref&gt;Richey, Rita C. "The future role of Robert M. Gagne in instructional design." The Legacy of Robert M. Gagne (2000): 255-281.&lt;/ref&gt; (except skills that are innate, such as breathing, swallowing, gripping etc).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6716">The '''Dahl effect''' or Dahl concept is used in [[dentistry]] where a localized appliance or localized restoration is used to increase the available interocclusal space available for restorations. {{TOC limit|History=|Mode of action=}}

== Method and concept ==
The Dahl Concept refers to the relative axial tooth movement that is observed when a localised appliance or localised restorations are placed in supra-occlusion and the occlusion re-establishes full arch contacts over a period of time.

The effect works by a combination of intrusion (40%) of the anterior teeth in contact with the appliance and eruption (60%) of the unopposed posterior teeth.

== History ==
In 1962, D. J. Anderson from [[Guy's Hospital|Guy’s Hospital Medical School]], described the idea of manipulating occlusion by inducing over-eruption. This was achieved by placing bite-raising caps on certain teeth in the arch and observing the changes in distances between other teeth of opposing arches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=D.J.|title=Tooth movement in experimental malocclusion|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0003-9969(62)90043-2|journal=Archives of Oral Biology|volume=7|issue=1|pages=7–15|doi=10.1016/0003-9969(62)90043-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 1975, Bjørn L. Dahl from the Faculty of Dentistry of [[University of Oslo]] became the first author through a series of papers to report the successful use of the technique for the management of the worn dentition. Dahl, along with Olaf Krogstad and Kjell Karlsen, described this phenomenon where a [[Dahl appliance]] or anterior bite plane is used to increase the available interocclusal space available for restorations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dahl|first=BJøRN L.|last2=Krogstad|first2=Olaf|last3=Karlsen|first3=Kjell|date=1975-07-01|title=An alternative treatment in cases with advanced localized attrition|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2842.1975.tb00914.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Oral Rehabilitation|language=en|volume=2|issue=3|pages=209–214|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2842.1975.tb00914.x|issn=1365-2842}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A male, 18 year old patient with heavy wear on the palatal aspect of his dentition and no interproximal contacts in the anterior teeth was the subject of the experiment. A removable cobalt chromium platform was worn, which covered the upper palatal surface of the anterior teeth, while being held in place by clasps in the canine and premolar region. The appliance was worn for 24 hours each day over a 12 month period except for cleaning after every meal. This caused the premolars and molars of the patient to be propped open with the anterior teeth occluding the appliance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Clinical Application ==
The Dahl concept is commonly used when an increase in the [[interocclusal space]] is required together with an increase in [[occlusal vertical dimension]] ; for example when restoring a case of severe anterior [[tooth surface loss]]. &lt;br /&gt;Typically, restoring the worn anterior teeth with [[dental composite]] to the original proportions will result in an increase in OVD, with the posterior dentition held apart out of the [[occlusion (dentistry)|occlusion]].

Adaptation occurs over a period of some months: compensatory eruption of the posterior teeth will occur, together with some intrusion of the anterior teeth and potential growth of the [[alveolar bone]]. This will allow the posterior occlusion to reestablish at the new increased OVD, stabilizing the increased interocclusal space.

Dentoalveolar tissues tend to compensate by remodelling when incisal/occlusal tooth surface loss has occurred to allow the teeth to regain a functional occlusion. A subsequent increase in the OVD with the Dahl approach could exceed the patient's tolerance and adaptive capacity. If the patient is unhappy with the height of their teeth and a Dahl approach cannot be tolerated then crown lengthening may be appropriate.

== Dahl appliance ==
The original material used to construct Dahl's appliance was cobalt chromium. Now, many materials can be used to construct Dahl's appliance as long as the principles of technique are adhered to. A Dahl appliance should fulfil the following aims:
* A thickness of material should be placed on the incisal/occlusal aspect of those teeth where the creation of interocclusal space is necessary. No mucosal-bone component should be involved
* Thickness of the material placed should directly correspond to the required amount of inter-occlusal space, which will determine the increased in OVD as measured at specific site in the mouth.
* An occlusal bite platform should be constructed ideally to ensure the occlusal forces are directed along the long axis of teeth.
* Stable inter-occlusal contacts should be achieved.
* Movement of the discluded teeth should not be impeded by the appliance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poyser|first=N. J.|last2=Porter|first2=R. W. J.|last3=Briggs|first3=P. F.

== Advantages ==
The advantages of this approach are:
*  minimal removal of tooth substance is required to create the interocclusal space
*  lost OVD can be restored
*  minimisation of facial aging by restoring facial height 
*  safety
*  relative simplicity
*  relatively reversible
*  relatively cost effective approach

== Success of Dahl concept ==
Planned occlusal changes can be tested using a removable appliance prior to permanent treatment. Dental composite based approaches to [[tooth surface loss]] allow for easy adjustment or removal if required. One study published in the British Dental Journal, 2011 found that patient satisfaction was high when composite restorations were used in the Dahl approach and that the median survival time was between 4.75 and 5.8 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gulamali|first=A.

The '''Donka Hospital''' is a publicly owned hospital in [[Conakry]], [[Guinea]]. It has inadequate facilities to handle demand, and many Guineans cannot afford its services. More than once in recent years the hospital has had to deal with a major influx of patients wounded in civil disturbances.

==Facilities==
Donka is a University Teaching Hospital, one of two in Conakry, the other being [[Ignace Deen Hospital]].&lt;ref name=CBM/&gt;
It is located to the northeast of the [[Conakry Grand Mosque]] and across the main road from the infamous [[Camp Boiro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The hospital receives priority supply of electricity, but blackouts were frequent in 2006 when oil prices soared.
The hospital did not have enough money to pay for fuel for the main back-up power generator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2004, the West Africa Health Organization (WAHO), working with the Guinea Government, began giving two-year courses in ophthalmology for General Practice Doctors, with intensive theoretical and practical training.  Facilities were insufficient. [[Christian Blind Mission|CBM]], [[Sightsavers]] and WAHO arranged to build a new facility in the teaching hospital compound, which was opened on 9 April 2010.&lt;ref name=CBM/&gt;

==Treatment==
[[File:Pediatric doctors at Donka hospital reviewing mealses cases.jpg|thumb|300px|Pediatric doctors at Donka Hospital reviewing measles cases during an epidemic in 2009.]]

A 1989 study found that maternal mortality at the hospital was 12.47 per 1,000, an extremely high figure.
Causes include lack of primary health care or peripheral obstetrical services, poor training of nurses and midwives and lack of general health education among the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In March 2011, the general wardroom for pre-mature babies in the Maternity Center had four incubators, but only one was working. It held five babies. The center is not equipped to handle the demand. About 80% of premature babies die within a few days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Donka Hospital Institute of Nutrition and Child Health is the only children's hospital in Conakry.
Between January and the end of September 2006, 623 malnourished children were admitted, a significant increase over previous years. The "dark, airless wards" were overcrowded, with some children sleeping two to a bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The hospital's dialysis department has five dialysis machines and can only treat 21 patients. There are private dialysis centers, but most patients cannot pay the $100 cost of the treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Patient charges==
The hospital has built up debt over the years, and cannot persuade the government or aid agencies to help with repayments.
It therefore enforces a rigorous pay-as-you-go policy, which puts treatment and drugs out of reach of many poor people.&lt;ref name=Inarus/&gt;
New patients must first be tested for life-threatening illnesses such as tuberculosis, AIDS, cholera, malaria and cancer.&lt;ref name="Mariama Berey - A Case Study"&gt;{{cite web

The cost of a measles vaccine is as low as US$1.&lt;ref name=IFRC2003114/&gt;

Since many Guineans do not have enough money to pay for the blood test, they cannot get medical attention at the hospital.&lt;ref name="Mariama Berey - A Case Study"/&gt;
The director of the hospital, Dr Taibou Barry, acknowledged the problem in 2003, saying: "The families are poor and when they come to the hospital, they have to pay for everything, and that’s probably all the money they have, so they must choose to eat or to come to the hospital".&lt;ref name=IFRC2003114/&gt;

A 2008 report from [[IRIN]] described the case of Aboubacar Traoré, who took his two-year-old daughter to the hospital for emergency medical treatment. Although the fee for consultation was $5, as shown on a sign on the wall, the doctor demanded more. 
Another doctor at the hospital said she was not surprised. She said "I have seen colleagues here persuade patients that only they can treat them, and once the patient has gained trust in that doctor, he or she bribes the patient".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Civil unrest ==
At the start of 2007, strikes and protests were called due to rising commodity prices and falling living standards, coupled with pervasive corruption and political unrest. In the ensuing violence, about 180 people died and over 1,000 were injured.&lt;ref name=MSF200712/&gt; 
The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) provided six vehicles to take wounded people to Donka Hospital on 22 January 2007.
119 patients were admitted, most with bullet wounds. 
The ICRC supplied a surgical kit for treating up to 150 gunshot victims to the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Donka hospital cared for at least 800 wounded people, assisted by [[Médecins Sans Frontières]].&lt;ref name=MSF200712/&gt;
According to Djoulde Barry, director general of the hospital, 33 dead were registered there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 28 September 2009 a demonstration against the military junta at a city stadium was violently suppressed by security forces, with dozens of deaths and hundreds of injuries.&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt;
Women reported that soldiers had raped them in public in the stadium. Medical records from Donka Hospital showed that at least 32 of the women protesters were raped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

More than 220 first aid workers from the Red Cross Society of Guinea gave emergency medical assistance to more than 350 wounded people and took the most serious cases to the hospitals, mostly to the Donka National Hospital.&lt;ref name=ICRC2009-12-21/&gt;
The injured packed the emergency room. Military from the Presidential Guard and Anti-Drug and Anti-Organized Crime Unit showed up around 3:00&amp;nbsp;pm that day. They fired their rifles into the air, destroyed medicines and yelled at the wounded to leave the hospital. They prevented anyone else from entering the building. The register of people treated was later lost.&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt;

Following the 28 September violence, the ICRC gave essential medical and surgical items to Conakry's hospitals, including kits to treat bullet wounds, masks, gloves and saline solution, and also provided body bags.
The ICRC and the Red Cross Society of Guinea tried to reunite family members, particularly children, who had been separated in the violence.&lt;ref name=ICRC2009-12-21/&gt;
The [[NGO]] [[Terre des hommes]] was providing meals to patients in the Hospital, with the Health Ministry and private donations assisting in the supply of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

As follow-up to the violence, the ICRC helped Donka Hospital revise its emergency plan for handling a large influx of patients with bullet wounds.&lt;ref name=ICRC2009-12-21/&gt;

Further violence occurred before the October 2010 Presidential run-off elections. 
Supporters of the candidate [[Cellou Dalein Diallo]] of the [[Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea]] threw stones at police, who responded with gunfire. Two people were killed and at least 29 people were injured, treated in private clinics or Donka Hospital. The victims included "13 adolescents and three young girls".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The actress [[Mia Farrow]], who serves as a [[UNICEF]] Goodwill Ambassador, visited the hospital in May 2010.
She saw three newborn infants in one incubator in the maternity ward. 
She met mothers of severely malnourished children, and saw children fighting measles and other preventable childhood killer diseases.
She said "It is wrenching to watch a child dying of a disease that is completely preventable. This is a result of Guinea's failing health system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Fight Forever Foundation''' is a [[501(c)3]] [[non-profit foundation]] founded to find a cure for [[cystic fibrosis]](CF), a life-threatening, genetic lung disease affecting 100,000 people worldwide.  This objective is expressed in both Danny's personal mission and the shared mission of the Foundation, "Find a Cure or Die Trying."  To accomplish this mission the Foundation continues to build their International Medical Advisory Board to collectively stay abreast of the evolving advancements being made for a cure, while simultaneously raising funds, to effectively support promising advancements.

==History==

Danny Ferrone was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis at the age of two.&lt;ref name="diagnosis"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-11AA3FB250FA5FE0.html| title =LFHS graduate Ferrone gives all to find cystic fibrosis cure| publisher =High Beam Research| accessdate =2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After three and a half years weathering the harsh winters and high altitude of Colorado while a student at the University of Denver, Danny returned home to Chicago to focus on his health.  While training for the 2006 Accenture Triathlon, Danny came up with the idea to create the Fight Forever Foundation.  Founded by Danny Ferrone and two of his close friends, the Foundation's immediate fundraising efforts were centered on a campaign which involved Danny competing in triathlon and marathon events which were supposed to culminate in the [[Ironman World Championship]] in Kona, Hawaii in 2008.  Danny, with his limited lung capacity around 50%,&lt;ref name="lung capacity"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/local&amp;id=5694060| title =Chicago man with cystic fibrosis running in marathon for cure| publisher =ABC 7 News| accessdate =2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; finished marathons in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and Chicago, and the Accenture Triathlon in Chicago, twice, over the two-year campaign. However, his goal of qualifying for the Ironman World Championship fell short after a hard-fought performance at the qualifying Buffalo Springs Lake triathlon event in Lubbock, Texas in June 2008, where his time of 5 hours, 48 minutes failed to land him a spot in Kona.&lt;ref name="Lubbock"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.lubbockonline.com/stories/063008/spo_297531338.shtml| title =At Buffalo Springs Lake, Chicago native shows why he's an iron man| publisher =Lubbock Online| accessdate =2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current projects==
Never willing to give in, Danny is currently in Milan, Italy working together with the Italian Cystic Fibrosis Research Foundation and researchers throughout Europe, while continuing his training to compete in more marathons and triathlons.  He regularly speaks internationally at seminars for both researchers and people living with CF where he discusses the "Battle" he faces on a daily basis, and provides support to families and individuals also battling the disease.

{{wiktionary|Grannus}}

In the [[Celtic polytheism]] of [[classical antiquity]], '''Grannus''' (also ''Granus'', ''[[Mogons|Mogounus]],''&lt;ref name="mogo"/&gt; and ''Amarcolitanus''&lt;ref name="amarco"/&gt;) was a [[deity]] associated with [[spa]]s, healing [[thermal spring|thermal]] and [[spring water|mineral springs]], and the [[sun]].{{citationneeded|date=February 2015}} He was regularly identified with [[Apollo]] as '''Apollo Grannus'''. He was frequently worshipped in conjunction  with [[Sirona]], and sometimes with [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] and other deities.&lt;ref name="SMF"/&gt;

==Name==
===Etymology===
In the early twentieth century, the name was connected with the [[Irish language|Irish]] ''grian'', ‘sun’.&lt;ref name="MacCulloch"/&gt; Along these lines, the god was often linked to the [[Deò-ghrèine]] and the character [[Mac Gréine]] of [[Irish mythology]]. However, the Irish ''grian'', ‘sun’ is thought to be derived from [[Proto-Celtic]] *''greinā'' ‘sun’  and the Proto-Celtic *''greinā'' is unlikely to have developed into ''Grannos'' in [[Gaulish]] and other [[Continental Celtic]] languages. Derivation from a Proto-Celtic root *''granno-'' ‘beard’ (cf. [[Welsh language|Middle Welsh]] ''grann'' ‘chin; beard, hairs’ and [[Old Irish]] ''grend'' ‘beard, hairs’) has enjoyed some scholarly support, from which Jürgen Zeidler dissents, proposing a different root *''granno-'' with "probable reference to the sun's heat and [[light therapy|healing properties]]".&lt;ref name="Delamarre"&gt;Xavier Delamarre (2003). ''Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise.'' Éditions Errance, Paris, pp. 182-183. The quoted text is ''«référence probable à la chaleur du soleil et ses propriétés curatives»''.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Ranko Matasović]], in his ''Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Celtic'', has tentatively proposed that the root of this theonym comes from Proto-Celtic *''g&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;renso''-, which means "heat";&lt;ref&gt;R.  Matasović, ''Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Celtic'' (Leiden, 2009) p. 147, s.v. *g&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;rīns- / *g&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;renso-&lt;/ref&gt; however, Proto-Celtic initial ''g&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;-'' yields ''b-'' in Gaulish (cf. the name [[Brennus]]).{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Epithets===
At [[Monthelon, Saône-et-Loire|Monthelon]], Grannus is called ''Deus Apollo Grannus '''Amarcolitanus'''''&lt;ref name="amarco"&gt;{{CIL|13|02600}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("The one with a piercing or far-reaching look"&lt;ref&gt;Zeidler, Jürgen, "On the etymology of Grannus", Zeitschrift für celtische Philologie, Volume 53 (1), de Gruyter. 2003, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;), and at [[Horbourg-Wihr]] ''Apollo Grannus [[Mogounus]]''.&lt;ref name="SMF"&gt;Patrice Lajoye. [http://www.mythofrancaise.asso.fr/mythes/themes/divcelt2.htm Un inventaire des divinités celtes de l’Antiquité]. Société de Mythologie Française. See also the inventory's [http://www.mythofrancaise.asso.fr/mythes/themes/divcelt1.htm introduction]. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mogo"&gt;{{CIL|13|05315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In all of his centres of worship where he is assimilated to a [[Roman deities|Roman god]], Grannus was [[Interpretatio romana|identified]] with [[Apollo]],&lt;ref name="SMF"/&gt; presumably in Apollo’s role as a healing or solar deity. In [[Trier]], he is identified more specifically with [[Phoebus]] as Apollo Grannus Phoebus.&lt;ref&gt;{{CIL|13|03635}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SMF"/&gt;

==Centres of worship==
[[File:CarolusThermen02.JPG|right|thumb|Hot springs such as those at Aquae Granni (today's [[Aachen]]) are thought to have been dedicated to Grannus.]]
[[File:Grand amphitheatre vgen.jpg|right|thumb|The amphitheatre in [[Grand, Vosges|Grand]], dedicated to Apollo. The name of Grand has been linked to Grannus.]]
One of the god’s most famous cult centres was at Aquae Granni (now [[Aachen]], Germany). Aachen means ‘water’ in [[Old High German]], a [[calque]] of the Roman name of "Aquae Granni".&lt;ref name="Aachen"&gt;Dr. Rita Mielke. [http://www.aachen.de/EN/ts/100_taking_a_cure/100_99/index.html History of Bathing]. Aachen.&lt;/ref&gt; The town’s hot springs with temperatures between 45&amp;nbsp;°C and 75&amp;nbsp;°C lay in the somewhat inhospitably marshy area around Aachen's basin-shaped valley region.&lt;ref name="Aachen"/&gt; Aachen first became a [[spa|curative centre]] in [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt times]].&lt;ref name="Aachen"/&gt; 

According to [[Cassius Dio]], the Roman Emperor [[Caracalla]] (188 AD to 217 AD) unsuccessfully sought help from Apollo Grannus—as well as [[Aesculapius]] and [[Serapis]]—during a bout of physical and mental illness, visiting the god's shrine and making many votive offerings; Dio claims that the gods refused to heal him because they knew Caracalla's intentions to be evil.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' 78.15.&lt;/ref&gt; Caracalla's visit to the shrine of ‘the Celtic healing-god’ Grannus was during the war with Germany in about 215.{{citationneeded|date=February 2015}}

In the early twentieth century, the god was said to have still been remembered in a chant sung round bonfires in [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]], in which a grain [[wikt:sheaf|sheaf]] is set on [[fire]], and called ''Granno mio'', while the people sing, “Granno, my friend; Granno, my father; Granno, my mother”.&lt;ref name="MacCulloch"&gt;J. A. MacCulloch. 1911. [http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/rac/rac06.htm "The Gods of Gaul and the Continental Celts."] ''The Religion of the Ancient Celts.''&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''granno'' may simply be a derivative of an [[Occitan language|Occitan]] word of [[Latin language|Latin]] origin meaning "grain" (compare [[Auvergnat]] ''gran'' "grain", ''grana'' "seed" and [[Languedocien dialect|Languedocien]] ''grano'', from Latin ''grānum'' "[[grain]]").

==Festival==
A 1st century AD Latin inscription from a public fountain in [[Limoges]] mentions a Gaulish ten-night festival of Grannus (lightly Latinized as ''decamnoctiacis Granni''):

:&lt;small&gt;POSTVMVS DV[M]&lt;/small&gt;
:&lt;small&gt;NORIGIS F&lt;/small&gt;(ilius) &lt;small&gt;VERG&lt;/small&gt;(obretus) &lt;small&gt;AQV&lt;/small&gt;
:&lt;small&gt;AM MARTIAM DECAM&lt;/small&gt;
:&lt;small&gt;NOCTIACIS GRANNI D&lt;/small&gt;(e) &lt;small&gt;S&lt;/small&gt;(ua) &lt;small&gt;P&lt;/small&gt;(ecunia) &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;(edit)&lt;ref&gt;''[[L'Année épigraphique|AE]]'' 1989: 521; ''AE'' 1991: 1222.&lt;/ref&gt;

Translation: "The [[vergobret]]us Postumus son of Dumnorix gave from his own money the ''Aqua Martia'' ("Water of Martius [or Mars]", an aqueduct&lt;ref&gt;Laurent Lamoine, ''Le pouvoir local en Gaule romaine'', Presses Universitaires Blaise Pascal, 2009, pp. 114-115.&lt;/ref&gt;) for the ten-night festival of Grannus".

==Divine entourage==
The name Grannus is sometimes accompanied by those of other deities in the inscriptions. In [[Augsburg]], he is found with both [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] and [[Sirona]];&lt;ref&gt;{{AE|1992|01304}}&lt;/ref&gt; he is again invoked with [[Sirona]] at [[Rome]],&lt;ref&gt;{{CIL|06|00036}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bitburg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{CIL|13|04129}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baumberg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{CIL|03|05588}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SMF"/&gt; [[Lauingen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{CIL|03|11903}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa|Sarmizegetusa]] (twice).&lt;ref&gt;{{AE|1983|00828}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Mengen, Germany|Ennetach]] he is with [[Nymph]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{CIL|03|05861}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Lauingen|Faimingen]] with [[Hygieia]] and the [[Cybele|Mother of the Gods]],&lt;ref&gt;{{CIL|03|05873}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[Grand, Vosges|Grand]] with [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]]&lt;!-- Can we confirm this? --&gt;.&lt;ref name="SMF"/&gt; A votive altar at [[Astorga, Spain|Astorga]] invokes him after "holy [[Serapis]]" and "the many-named [[Isis]]", and before "the unvanquished [[Persephone|Core]] and [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] [[Sagatus]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{AE|1968|00230}}. The dedicant is Julius Melanius, an [[Procurator (Roman)#As governors|imperial governor]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SMF"/&gt;

[[File:Palaquium gutta - Köhler–s Medizinal-Pflanzen-099.jpg|thumb|right|''Palaquium gutta'']]
'''Gutta-percha''' refers to trees of the genus ''[[Palaquium]]'' in the family [[Sapotaceae]] and the rigid natural [[latex]] produced from the [[sap]] of these trees, particularly from ''[[Palaquium gutta]]''.

The word ''gutta-percha'' comes from the plant's name in [[Malay language|Malay]], ''getah perca'', which translates as "percha [[latex]]".

==Description==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Guttapercha-boom TMnr 60016733.jpg|thumb|Gutta-percha tree]]
Palaquium gutta trees are 5–30 m tall and up to 1 m in trunk diameter. The leaves are [[evergreen]], alternate or spirally arranged, simple, entire, 8–25&amp;nbsp;cm long, glossy green above, and often yellow or glaucous below. The flowers are produced in small clusters along the stems, each flower with a white [[Corolla (flower)|corolla]] with four to seven (mostly six) acute lobes.  The fruit is an ovoid 3– to 7-cm berry, containing one to four seeds; in many species, the fruit is edible.

In Australia, gutta-percha is a common name specifically used for the [[euphorbiaceae|euphorbiaceous]] tree ''[[Excoecaria]] parvifolia'', which yields an aromatic, heavy, dark-brown timber.

==Chemistry==
[[File:Guttapercha.svg|thumb|Chemical structure of gutta-percha]]
Chemically, gutta-percha is a [[terpene|polyterpene]], a [[polymer]] of [[isoprene]], or [[polyisoprene]], specifically ([[Cis-trans isomerism|trans]]-1,4-polyisoprene). The [[Cis-trans isomerism|cis]] structure of polyisoprene is the common [[latex]] [[elastomer]]. While latex rubbers are [[amorphous]] in molecular structure, gutta-percha (the trans structure) [[crystal]]lizes, leading to a more rigid material.

==Historical uses==
[[File:The Reels of Gutta-percha Covered Conducting Wire Conveyed into Tanks at the Works of the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company, at Greenwich MET DP801249.jpg|thumb|Cable manufacturing with gutta-percha at the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company in [[Greenwich]], London, ca. 1865]]
Scientifically classified in 1843, it was found to be a useful natural [[thermoplastic]]. In 1851, {{convert|30000|long cwt|kg|abbr=on}} of gutta-percha was imported into Britain.&lt;ref name=GPC/&gt;

During the second half of the 19th century, gutta-percha was used for myriad domestic and industrial purposes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Devil's Milk |last=Tully |first=John |date=2011 |publisher=NYU Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it became a household word. In particular, it was needed as insulation for [[Submarine communications cable#Construction|underwater telegraph cables]],&lt;ref name=GPC&gt;[http://atlantic-cable.com/Article/GuttaPercha/ Gutta-Percha company]&lt;/ref&gt; which, according to author John Tully, led to [[sustainability|unsustainable]] harvesting and a collapse of the supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tully|first=John|title=A Victorian Ecological Disaster: Imperialism, the Telegraph, and Gutta-Percha|journal=Journal of World History|year=2009|volume=20|issue=4|pages=559–579|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_world_history/summary/v020/20.4.tully.html|doi=10.1353/jwh.0.0088}} [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/journal_of_world_history/v020/20.4.tully.html muse.jhu.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Harvey Wickes Felter and John Uri Lloyd's ''[[Endodontology]]'': {{quote|Even long before Gutta-percha was introduced into the western world, it was used in a less processed form by the natives of the Malaysian archipelago for making knife handles, walking sticks and other purposes. The first European to discover this material was John Tradescant, who collected it in the far east in 1656.  He named this material "Mazer wood". Dr. [[William Montgomerie]], a medical officer in Indian service, introduced gutta-percha into practical use in the West. He was the first to appreciate the potential of this material in medicine, and he was awarded the gold medal by the Royal Society of Arts, London in 1843.&lt;ref name=prakesh&gt;Harvey Wickes Felter and John Uri Lloyd. [http://medind.nic.in/eaa/t05/i2/eaat05i2p32.pdf "Gutta-Percha-: An Untold Story. Prakesh et al. ~2001 Endodontology"]. King's American Dispensatory http://www.ibiblio.org/herbmed/eclectic/kings isonandra.html {{dead link|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Electrical===
Gutta-percha latex is biologically [[Chemically inert|inert]], resilient, and is a good [[nonconductor|electrical insulator]] with a high [[dielectric strength]]. The wood of many species is also valuable.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Western inventors discovered the properties of gutta-percha latex in 1842,{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} although the people of its [[Malay Peninsula|Malayan]] habitat had used it for many applications for centuries. Allowing this fluid to evaporate and coagulate in the sun produced a latex which could be made flexible again with hot water, but which did not become brittle, unlike [[rubber]] prior to the discovery of [[vulcanized|vulcanization]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

By 1845, telegraph wires insulated with gutta-percha were being manufactured in the UK. It served as the insulating material for early undersea telegraph cables, including the first [[transatlantic telegraph cable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schlesinger |first1=Henry |title=The battery how portable power sparked a technological revolution |date=2010 |publisher=HarperCollins e-books |location=New York |isbn=9780061985294 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gutta-percha was particularly suitable for this, as it was not attacked by marine plants or animals, which had disabled previous undersea cables. The material was a major constituent of [[Chatterton's compound]] used as an [[electrical insulation|insulating sealant]] for telegraph and other electrical cables.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Since about 1930, [[polyethylene]] has supplanted gutta-percha as an electrical insulator.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Other===
In the mid-19th century, gutta-percha was also used to make furniture, notably by the Gutta-Percha Company (established in 1847).&lt;ref name=GPC/&gt; Several of these ornate, revival-style pieces were shown at the 1851 [[Great Exhibition]] in Hyde Park, London. When hot it could be moulded into furniture, decorations or utensils.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

It was also used to make "mourning" jewelry, because it was dark in color and could be easily molded into beads or other shapes. Pistol hand grips and rifle shoulder pads were also made from gutta-percha, since it was hard and durable, though it fell into disuse when [[plastic]]s such as [[Bakelite]] became available.  Gutta-percha found use in canes and walking sticks, as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[Caning of Charles Sumner]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The material was adopted for other applications. The "[[guttie]]" golf ball (which had a solid gutta-percha core) revolutionized the game. Gutta-percha remained an industrial staple well into the 20th Century, when it was gradually replaced with superior (generally synthetic) materials, though a similar and cheaper natural material called ''[[balatá]]'' is often used in gutta-percha's place. The two materials are almost identical, and ''balatá ''is often called ''gutta-balatá''.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In 1856, United States [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Preston Brooks]] used a cane made of gutta-percha as a weapon in [[Caning of Charles Sumner|his attack]] on [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Charles Sumner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Green |first=Michael S. |date=2010 |title=Politics and America in Crisis: The Coming of the Civil War |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x80_kiWmx58C&amp;pg=PA94 |location=Santa Barbara, CA |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=94 |isbn=978-0-313-08174-3 |via= Google Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current uses==
===Dentistry===
The same bioinertness that made it suitable for marine cables also means it does not readily react within the human body. It is used in a variety of surgical devices and during [[root canal]] therapy. It is the predominant material used to [[wikt:obturate|obturate]], or fill the empty space inside the root of a tooth after it has undergone [[endodontic therapy]]. Its physical and chemical properties, including but not limited to its [[Chemically inert|inertness]] and [[biocompatibility]], [[melting point]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yee|first=Fulton S.|last2=Marlin|first2=Jay|last3=Krakow|first3=Alvin Arlen|last4=Gron|first4=Poul|title=Three-dimensional obturation of the root canal using injection-molded, thermoplasticized dental gutta-percha|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0099239977800915|journal=Journal of Endodontics|volume=3|issue=5|pages=168–174|doi=10.1016/s0099-2399(77)80091-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ductility]], and [[malleability]], make it important in [[endodontics]],&lt;ref name=prakesh/&gt; e.g. as gutta-percha points.

==Tjipetir blocks==
Mysterious blocks, about the size of a chopping-board, bearing the name "Tjipetir" (a plantation in the [[Dutch East Indies]] - now [[Indonesia]] - operating in the late 19th and early 20th centuries), have been washing up on the beaches of northern Europe for some time through 2013 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-30043875 |website=www.bbc.co.uk |publisher=BBC |accessdate=1 December 2014 |title=Tjipetir mystery: Why are rubber-like blocks washing up on European beaches?}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are believed to be blocks of gutta-percha from the Japanese liner the [[Miyazaki Maru]], which sank 150 miles (241.5&amp;nbsp;km) west of the [[Isles of Scilly]] during WWI.

'''Günther Messner''' (18 May 1946&lt;ref&gt;Diary of Günther Messner, entry from May 18, 1970. In [[Reinhold Messner]], ''Der Nackte Berg'', 2002, Piper Verlag, p. 119: ''Lager I (4700 m), Pfingstmontag, 18. Mai 1970. Heute ist mein Geburtstag, 24 Jahre werde ich alt.'' (= "Camp I (4,700 m), Whit Monday, 18 May 1970. Today is my birthday, I'm getting 24 years old.")&lt;/ref&gt; – 29 June 1970) was an [[Italy|Italian]] mountaineer from [[South Tyrol]] and the younger brother of [[Reinhold Messner]]. Günther climbed some of the most difficult routes in the Alps during the 1960s, and joined the Nanga Parbat-Expedition in 1970 just before the beginning of the expedition due to an opening within the team.

==Death on Nanga Parbat==
Günther was a member of a 1970 expedition to Nanga Parbat led by [[:de:Karl Herrligkoffer|Karl Herrligkoffer]]. Herrligkoffer had already organized six expeditions to Nanga Parbat and was said to be obsessed with the mountain after his half-brother, climber [[Willy Merkl]], along with eight others, died on the peak in 1934.&lt;ref name = "Outside" /&gt;

On 26 June 1970 [[Reinhold Messner|Reinhold]], Günther and Gerhard were at Camp 5 watching for a signal rocket from base camp. Blue indicated good weather, red poor. Radio Peshawar reported good weather, so the expedition leader Herrligkoffer fired a rocket, but it exploded red, not blue. Consequently, Reinhold commenced a solo quick-and-light attack without gear shortly after 2 a.m. to avoid the presumed bad weather. Günther and Gerhard were still asleep. Reinhold had a difficult time finding his way up the Merkl Couloir by headlamp but emerged at dawn. At sunrise the next morning, Günther and [[:de:Gerhard Baur|Gerhard Baur]] were installing rope to aid Reinhold's return. Baur recounts the story that Günther did something impulsive in that he impatiently dumped the ropes they were fixing and sprinted into and then soloed the difficult Merkl Couloir. Günther and Reinhold reached the summit together late in the afternoon, when Günther started showing signs of exhaustion, possibly due to the effort he made in trying to catch up with Reinhold earlier in the day.&lt;ref name = "Outside" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "messner2014free"&gt;{{cite book

What happened next was a matter of controversy for many years. According to [[Reinhold Messner]], the two brothers stayed near the summit overnight in an emergency bivouac (with only space blankets) close to the so-called Merkle-notch (named in honor of Herrligkoffer's half brother) since a night descent seemed impossible on the [[Rupal face]] due to Günther's exhaustion and [[altitude sickness]]. Reinhold states that Günther worried that reversing down the sheer Rupal Face would be dangerous. He says that Günther suggested a descent via the gentler Diamir Face.&lt;ref name = "Outside" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "messner2014free" /&gt;

The next morning, Reinhold recalls that Günther was delirious. Reinhold says that he started shouting for help at 6 a.m. and about three hours later, he saw [[:de:Felix Kuen|Felix Kuen]] and [[:de:Peter Scholz (Bergsteiger)|Peter Scholz]] in the Merkl Couloir, heading for the summit. The two parties got to within about 100 yards of each other and with difficulty there was some communication. "Are you both OK?" Kuen yelled. "Yes! Everything's OK," Reinhold controversially replied. Unfortunately in a misunderstanding Kuen and Scholz continued to the summit.&lt;ref name = "messner2014free" /&gt; Reinhold and Günther were then forced to do a second bivouac at the Mummery Rib. By the next morning, the third day without shelter or water, Günther could only stumble slowly along. The multi-day descent had brought the two climbers to the limit of their physical and mental strength, and was to end in tragedy when Günther disappeared at the bottom of the Diamir face, most likely killed by an ice avalanche during the descent. Reinhold, walking ahead and facing exhaustion, severe frostbite and the loss of his brother, continued down along the Diamir valley until he found some local shepherds that helped him.&lt;ref name = "Outside" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Guardian"&gt;{{cite web | url  = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/aug/19/barbaramcmahon

The expedition members Max von Kienlin and Hans Saler claimed that Reinhold declined the assistance of others when his brother Günther became ill. The main assertion by Hans Saler and Max von Kienlin was that Reinhold's decision to go down the Diamir face was not born of emergency, as suggested by Günther in his fatigue, but a gambit Reinhold had planned and had openly discussed with members of the team.&lt;ref name = "MensJournal"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mensjournal.com/magazine/reinhold-messners-mountain-madness-20121004?page=3

We couldn't continue along the southwest ridge either, because it is very long and up and down. And we couldn't wait for the others to come, because they couldn't have gotten to us until the following morning, and another day and night at that altitude would have been fatal for Günther.

==Remains and controversy==

For the next 30 years the dispute over the events of this expedition became possibly the most controversial fight in modern-day climbing. The dispute spawned more than a dozen lawsuits, countless attacks and counterattacks, a revenge theory (stemming from a post-expedition love affair between Messner and von Kienlin's wife), and numerous efforts by Messner to find Günther and vindicate himself.&lt;ref name = "Outside"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.outsideonline.com/1909816/es-ist-mein-bruder

In July 2000, climber [[:de:Hanspeter Eisendle|Hanspeter Eisendle]] found a human [[fibula]] at the base of the Diamir wall of Nanga Parbat. Due to the decomposition of the DNA, it could not be definitively determined at that time whether the bone belonged to Günther Messner - it was possible that the bone could have come from climbers who died on the mountain in 1962. A subsequent analysis at the [[University of Innsbruck]] strongly suggested that the owner of the fibula was Günther Messner.&lt;ref name = "SpiegelOnline"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/reinhold-messner-s-25-year-nightmare-one-corpse-a-hundred-questions-a-381521.html

On 17 July 2005, three local Pakistani guides found the remains of a climber at an altitude of 4,300 metres on the Diamir face an hour's climb above the Diamir base camp, near where Reinhold had believed Günther was lost. A search of the talus yielded a leather boot entombing a wool-socked foot and clothing which the climbers quickly realized could be the body of Günther Messner. Reinhold trekked to the spot and recognised the boot (a brown leather Lowa Triple Boot) and jacket on the body as those of his brother. Reinhold took the boot with him - with the bones still inside. The expedition doctor, [[Munich]]-based anesthesiologist Rudolf Hipp, harvested tissue samples for the DNA testing.&lt;ref name = "SpiegelOnline" /&gt;

On 21 October 2005 scientists at the University of Innsbruck completed a DNA analysis of tissue samples from the remains, and confirmed that the remains were that of Günther. This evidence vindicated the version of events told by Reinhold that Günther was on the west side of the mountain when he was killed, and not on the descent through the Rupal Wall.&lt;ref name="Geographic"&gt;{{cite web

Despite the undisputed DNA evidence controversy persists. Residual argument revolves largely around whether Günther perished in a fall near the summit, upper or middle part of the Diamir Face, versus toward the bottom, where Reinhold said he'd last seen his brother. The argument is based on glacial movement over a period of 35 years and the location where the remains were found. Saler has asserted that if Günther had died in the lower third of the face (as described by Reinhold) then the remains would have been found much lower than 14,110 feet (where they were reportedly recovered). The existence of a disputed handwritten note described in the 2003 book by von Kienlin, ''The Traverse'', was allegedly a "confession" recorded by von Kienlin documenting a conversation between Reinhold and von Kienlin in a motel room in [[Gilgit]], Pakistan, before they both returned home. The note says that "I lost Günther" and "For hours I was up there yelling for him. I don't know why, but he couldn't hear me. He was doing very badly. He didn't make it. Maybe he fell."&lt;ref name = "Outside" /&gt;

==Funeral==
On 8 September 2005, the remains were burned at the foot of Nanga Parbat on a pyre in Tibetan tradition. Also borrowing from Tibetan tradition, Reinhold and his expedition team of 14 trekkers and two journalists built a chorten, a square-shaped stack of stones, as a monument.&lt;ref name = "SpiegelOnline" /&gt; The participants sang "yelo Lak, the gods were merciful," and threw rice into the air.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6014">The '''Harris–Benedict equation''' (also called the '''Harris-Benedict principle''') is a method used to estimate an individual's [[basal metabolic rate]] (BMR).

The estimated BMR value may be multiplied by a number that corresponds to the individual's activity level; the resulting number is the approximate daily [[kilocalorie]] intake to maintain current [[body weight]].

The Harris–Benedict equation may be used to assist weight loss — by reducing kilocalorie intake number below the estimated maintenance intake of the equation.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

== Step 2 &amp;ndash; Determine Total Intake ==

While the original paper does not attempt to translate BMR into [[Energy_homeostasis#Expenditure|total energy expenditure]] (TEE), a BMR result may be multiplied by a factor that approximates an individual's [[physical activity level]] (PAL) to estimate their TEE. The following table enables approximation of an individual's daily TEE based on some example lifestyles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=FAO|author2=WHO|author3=UNU|title=Human energy requirements: Energy Requirement of Adults|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/y5686e/y5686e07.htm#bm07.2|website=www.fao.org|accessdate=11 February 2018|language=English|date=24 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Harris–Benedict equation sprang from a study by [[James Arthur Harris]] and [[Francis Gano Benedict]], which was published in 1919 by the [[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institution of Washington]] in the [[monograph]] [https://archive.org/details/biometricstudyof00harruoft A Biometric Study Of Basal Metabolism In Man].  A 1984 [[Basal metabolic rate|revision]] improved its accuracy. Mifflin et al. published an equation more predictive for modern lifestyles in 1990.&lt;ref name=pmid2305711/&gt; Later work produced BMR estimators that accounted for lean body mass.

==Issues in dietary use==
As the BMR equations do not attempt to take into account body composition, identical results can be calculated for a very muscular person, and a very fat person, who are both the same height, weight, age and gender. As muscle and fat require differing amounts of calories to maintain, the TEE estimates will not be accurate for such cases.

The paper behind the latest update (Mifflin et al) to the BMR formula states all participants in their study fall within the 'normal' and 'overweight' [[body mass index]] (BMI) categories, and so the results also do not necessarily apply to those in the 'underweight' or 'obese' BMI categories.

The '''Health Care Compact''' is a proposed [[interstate compact]] – which is simply an agreement between two or more US [[federated state|states]] that is consented to by the [[United States Congress]] – that places authority and responsibility for healthcare regulation to the member states (except for military healthcare, which will remain federal), and provides the funds to the states to fulfill that responsibility."

The proposers of the compact assert that healthcare is too complex to be run federally; that the constitution reserves to the states or to the people those powers not granted to the federal government, and that an interstate compact will bring healthcare down to a state level and follow the intent of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://healthcarecompact.org/leo-linbeck-iii-testimony-tennessee-april-20-2011 Leo Linbeck III - Testimony in Tennessee]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, the [[Texas House of Representatives]] voted for preliminary approval to allow the state to join the proposed interstate compact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9NT11HG0.htm|title=Texas gives preliminary OK to health care compact|publisher=[[Business Week]]|date=2011-06-16|accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hippocrates Prize for Poetry and Medicine''' was founded in 2009 by [[Donald Singer]] and [[Michael Hulse]]. The founders "wished to draw together national and international perspectives on three major historical and contemporary themes uniting the disciplines of poetry and medicine: medicine as inspiration for the writings of poets; effects of poetic creativity on the experience of illness by patients, their families, friends, and carers; and poetry as therapy".&lt;ref name="pmid20333814"&gt;{{cite journal

==Background==
The Hippocrates Prize for Poetry and Medicine provides international awards for unpublished poems in English by any living poet. There are seven main awards in the Hippocrates Prize for Poetry and Medicine. Three awards are given for international health students or international Health Service-related professionals, including clinicians, educators, researchers, and biomedical scientists.  Three awards are given for open international entries. The International Hippocrates Prize for Young Poets was launched in 2012, and is also given for an unpublished poem on a medical theme.&lt;ref name="hippocrates-poetry.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hippocrates-poetry.org/hippocrates-prize/ |title=Hippocrates Prize |publisher=Hippocrates Initiative for Poetry and Medicine |first1=Donald RJ |last1=Singer |work=Homepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 2017 Hippocrates Prize for Poetry and Medicine was held in partnership with the Arts and Humanities Initiative&lt;ref&gt;https://artsandhumanities.hms.harvard.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Harvard Medical School]]. The 2018 Hippocrates Prize for Poetry and Medicine was awarded in [[Chicago]] in partnership with the Center for Bioethics and Medical Humanities at Northwestern University’s [[Feinberg School of Medicine]]&lt;ref&gt;http://bioethics.northwestern.edu/poetry2018&lt;/ref&gt;, the [[Poetry Foundation]], the Arts and Humanities Initiative at [[Harvard Medical School]] and the [[Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.healthpolicyandtechnology.org/article/S2211-8837(18)30169-2/pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Separation''' from a healthcare facility occurs anytime a [[patient]] (or resident) leaves because of [[death]], [[Wiktionary:Discharge|discharge]], sign-out against medical advice or transfer. The number of separations is the most commonly used measure of the utilization of hospital services. Separations, rather than admissions, are used because hospital abstracts for inpatient care are based on information gathered at the time of discharge.&lt;ref&gt;http://meteor.aihw.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/327268&lt;/ref&gt;

This is one of the measures of morbidity used when determining the burden of a disease. The second factor used is the length of hospital stay. In Australia, the main hospital separations of 2004–05 were:
# Digestive Problems.
# Neoplasms.
# Injury/Poisoning.
# Pregnancy/Child birth.
# Musculoskeletal diseases.
# Genitourinary diseases.
# Respiratory Diseases.

On the other hand, as expected the length of hospital stay spans out as follow (from longest to shortest):
# Mental/Behavioural disorders: [[Schizophrenia]], delusional disorders, [[mood disorder]]s.
# Circulatory system diseases.
# [[Neoplasms]].
# Injury/Poisoning.

'''Hot work''' is a process that can be a source of [[Combustion|ignition]] when flammable material is present or can be a [[fire hazard]] regardless of the presence of flammable material in the [[wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]]. Common hot work processes involve [[welding]], [[soldering]], [[cutting]], [[brazing]] burning and the use of powder-actuated tools or similar fire producing operations outside of designated hot work areas. When flammable materials are not present, industrial processes such as [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]] and [[drilling]] become cold work processes.&lt;ref name="hughes"&gt;{{Citation | last = Hughes | first = Phil | last2 = Ferrett | first2 = Ed | title = Introduction to health and safety at work: the handbook for the NEBOSH national general certificate | page = 84 | publisher = Butterworth-Heinemann | year = 2005 | edition = 2nd | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=F-3XDSCSWKoC&amp;pg=PA84 | isbn = 978-0-7506-6623-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, such as the [[UK]] and Canada,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/safety_haz/welding/hotwork.html&lt;/ref&gt; a ''hot work permit'' is required for hot work.&lt;ref name="hughes"/&gt;

==Standards==
In the [[United States]], [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] maintains regulations for hot work in the marine industrial setting. The following regulations apply:
*[http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10220 Hot Work. - 1915.14]
*[http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10416 Welding, cutting and heating (hot work). - 1917.152]
*[http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=12976 Precautions for hot work. - 1915.503]

The '''Ivaylovgrad Dam'''(язовир "Ивайловград") is located in the eastern [[Rhodope Mountains]] and is situated on the [[Arda (Maritsa)|Arda]] river, Southern Bulgaria. There are another two large dams of the Arda upstream - [[Kardzhali Dam]] and [[Studen Kladenets|Studen Kladenets Dam]] to the west of Ivaylovgrad Dam.

The dam creates [[Ivaylovgrad reservoir]], which has a total volume of {{convert|157000000|m3|acre.ft|abbr=on}} and a [[drainage basin]] of {{convert|5128|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. It is situated at an average 120 m above sea level, its dam being {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|73|m|ft|abbr=on}} high. The top of the dam consists of six spillways, totaling {{convert|83.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} m in length.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebrdrenewables.com/sites/renew/Lists/Projects/DispForm.aspx?ID=1773&amp;Source=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eebrdrenewables%2Ecom%2Fsites%2Frenew%2Fcountries%2FBulgaria%2Fdefault%2Easpx Ivailovgrad Hydro Power Plant]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nek.bg/cgi?d=1434 NEK brochure "Hydro Power Casdaces and Dams" page 36] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706143239/http://www.nek.bg/cgi?d=1434 |date=2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ivaylovgrad Reservoir is an attractive place for tourists and [[fishing|fishermen]], where [[rudd]] is caught in great numbers.

==Hydroelectric generation==
Arda Hydro Power Cascade consist of three large hydro power sites, mainly used for electricity generation, with a total installed capacity of 331 MW and a total annual output of over 520 GWh/y. Ivaylovgrad [[hydroelectric power plant]] (HPP) is the last stage of the Arda cascade. The initial plans for the construction of a dam on the Arda date to as early as 1948. Construction began in 1959 and was completed in 1964, with the HPP starting production the same year. "Ivaylovgrad" Hydroelectric Power Plant is built-in inside the dam. The HPP has four [[Francis turbine|Francis-type turbines]], 26 [[megawatt|MW]] each with a mean annual generation of 195 GWh/y.

'''Lane's Emulsion''' was a [[patent medicine]] manufactured in [[New Zealand]].

The emulsion, which had a strong fishy smell owing to its high [[cod liver oil]] content, was invented by Edward Lane,&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, D., "[http://www.odt.co.nz/regions/north-otago/164026/tonics-recipe-nectar-goodness Tonic's recipe nectar of goodness]", ''Otago Daily Times'', 9 June 2011. Retrieved 22 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; a chemist from [[Oamaru]], in 1898, and was later manufactured in the town's Harbour Street (now part of the Oamaru Historic Precinct) in a building which still bears the product's slogan "It's famous because it's good". The original recipe contained cod liver oil, beechwood creosote, mineral lime, soda, brandy, vitamins, fresh egg yolk and some secret ingredients.&lt;ref name="oammail"&gt;Bruce, D., "[http://www.odt.co.nz/regions/north-otago/161791/not-whiff-lanes-entry-yet Not a whiff of a Lane's entry yet]", ''Oamaru Mail'', 24 May 2011. Retrieved 22 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sold in clear glass bottles, the thick cream-coloured liquid was fed to generations of New Zealand children and was also sold overseas. Originally claiming to be "a reliable remedy for pulmonary ailments", the product was still in production until the early 1980s. Oamaru company Crombie and Price, which bought Lane's Medicine in 1971, still holds the rights and recipe to the product.

[[File:Kitchen utensils-01.jpg|thumb|right|An assortment of utensils]]
A [[kitchen utensil]] is a hand-held, typically small tool that is designed for food-related functions. '''Food preparation utensils''' are a specific type of kitchen utensil, designed for use in the preparation of food. Some utensils are both food preparation utensils and [[eating utensil]]s; for instance some implements of [[cutlery]] &amp;ndash; especially knives &amp;ndash; can be used for both food preparation in a kitchen and as eating utensils when dining.

In the [[Western world]], utensil invention accelerated in the 19th and 20th centuries. It was fuelled in part by the emergence of technologies such as the [[kitchen stove]] and [[refrigerator]], but also by a desire to save time in the kitchen, in response to the demands of modern lifestyles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/food/kitchen_technology.htm "Kitchen technology"].

'''Lokopriya Gopinath Bordoloi Regional Institute of Mental Health (লোকপ্ৰিয় গোপীনাথ বৰদলৈ আঞ্চলিক মানসিক স্বাস্থ্য প্ৰতিষ্ঠান)''' is one of the oldest mental health care institutes in India established in the year 1876. It is located in [[Tezpur]] in [[Sonitpur district]] of  [[Assam]]. The Institute is spread over 81 acres of land.

==Location==
Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi Regional Institute of Mental Health (LGBRIMH) is located in Tezpur. It is connected by road, rail and air to other  parts of the country. The Institute is located about 2&amp;nbsp;km away from the ASTC Bus Stand, Tezpur. It is about 180&amp;nbsp;km away from [[Guwahati]].
The [[Tezpur Airport]] at Salonibari is about 15&amp;nbsp;km away from the Institute.

==History==
The Lokopriya Gopinath Bordoloi Regional Institute of Mental Health (LGBRIMH) was initially set up as
''Tezpur Lunatic Asylum'' under the [[British Government]] in April, 1876.
In 1922 the hospital was renamed as ''Tezpur Mental Hospital''. The hospital accommodation rose up to 700 beds in 1932.
After the Independence, the hospital was brought under the [[Government of Assam]]. In 1949, Late Dr. N. C. Bordoloi became the Superintendent of the hospital. During his tenure, the hospital saw marked improvement in the administration and treatment services. Dr. Bordoloi was the first psychiatrist in the country to receive the [[Padma Shri|Padmashree]] Award from the [[Government of India]] for his dedicated service.
A new Out-Patient Department (OPD) was built in 1987. In the following year, another two storied building was built to accommodate the increased number of patients.  In 1989, the hospital was renamed as ''Lokopriya Gopinath Bordoloi Institute of Mental Health'' on the name of first chief minister of Assam [[Gopinath Bordoloi]] .
In 1999 the Institute was handed over to the [[North Eastern Council]] (NEC). 
On 1 June 2007, the Institute was taken over by the [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (India)]], Government of India.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3112">'''Luteolysis''' (also known as '''luteal regression''') is the structural and functional degradation of the [[corpus luteum]] (CL), which occurs at the end of the [[luteal phase]] of both the [[Estrous cycle|estrous]] and [[menstrual cycle]]s in the absence of [[pregnancy]]. In domestic animals, luteolysis is initiated by the hormones [[prostaglandin F2alpha]] and [[oxytocin]].  In sheep, communication between the pars nervosa (posterior lobe of the pituitary gland), corpus luteum, and the uterus [[endometrium]] via the circulatory system is required for luteolysis. Studies with sheep have found that, if the uterine horn is ipsalateral to the ovary possessing the CL is surgically removed, the lifespan of the corpus luteum will increase drastically.

Luteolysis in primates (including humans), however, is not caused by prostaglandin, and removal of the uterus will not prolong the life of the corpus luteum. However, primates do respond to PGF2a, and asthmatics should take great care when handling this hormone as PGF2a is bronchoconstrictor.

[[Estrogen]], secreted by [[Granulosa Cells]] and primarily [[progesterone]], secreted by the corpus luteum, inhibit the release of [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) and [[Follicle Stimulating Hormone]] (FSH) by the [[adenohypophysis]] (anterior lobe of the pituitary gland) via classical negative feedback mechanisms. This removes the luteotrophic support provided by the gonadotropin luteinizing hormone (LH). During a pregnancy, the corpus luteum remains on the ovary releasing [[progesterone]] which will maintain a state of uterine quiescence and close the [[cervix]] until the delivery of the fetus. Alternatively if no implantation of a [[blastocyst]] occurs, the corpus luteum is degraded to a [[corpus albicans]] (scar tissue) by PGF2alpha released by uterine endometrial cells.

Degradation of the corpus luteum will result in reduced levels of progesterone, promoting an increase in [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) secretion by the adenohypophysis, which will trigger the development of a new [[Ovarian follicle|follicle]] on the [[ovary]].

If pregnancy occurs, the placental hormone [[chorionic gonadotropin]] continues to maintain the corpus luteum, but in some species it will eventually degrade sometime during pregnancy.

If pregnancy occurs in [[equine]], the placental hormone [[equine chorionic gonadotropin]] released by [[endometrial cup]] continue to maintain the progesterone by acting as LH and FSH for follicles in ovary which will in return lead to increase in amount of corpus luteum.

==Luteolytic agents==
*[[Danazol]] was described as a luteolytic agent.&lt;ref&gt;Wentz AC, Sapp KC. Danazol as a luteolytic agent. Fertil Steril. 1978;29(1):23-5. {{PMID|620838}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Cloprostenol]] is another example of such an agent.

Fluid [[viscosity]] increases within the damper as [[electromagnet]] intensity increases. This type of shock absorber has several applications, most notably in [[active suspension|semi-active]] [[vehicle suspension]]s which may adapt to road conditions, as they are monitored through sensors in the vehicle, and in [[prosthetic]] [[artificial limbs|limbs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lord.com/Home/MagnetoRheologicalMRFluid/MRFluidTechnology/TechnologyCompared/tabid/3773/Default.aspx Technology Compared] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017011256/http://www.lord.com/Home/MagnetoRheologicalMRFluid/MRFluidTechnology/TechnologyCompared/tabid/3773/Default.aspx |date=October 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial applications==
Many applications have been proposed using magnetorheological (MR) dampers. While vehicle applications are the most common use of MR dampers, useful medical applications have risen as well, including implants and rehabilitation methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carlson|first1=J.D.|last2=Matthis|first2=W.|last3=Toscano|first3=J.R.|title=Smart Prosthetics Based on MR Fluids|journal=Proc. 8th annual symposium On Smart Structure And Material SPIE|date=March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since MR dampers are not yet perfect, they are limited in terms of application. Disadvantages do exist when using a large scale MR damper, for example, particle settling within the carrier fluid may occur that inhibits some possible application.

===History===
The technology was originally developed by General Motors Delphi Automotive Division based in the USA and then developed further by BeijingWest Industries in China after BeijingWest Industries bought the technology from General Motors. BeijingWest Industries has subsequently introduced improvements including a redesigned ECU and the introduction of a dual coil system.

=== Automotive ===
These types of systems are available from OEMs for several vehicles, including the [[Acura MDX]], [[Audi TT]] and [[Audi R8|R8]], [[Buick Lucerne]], [[Cadillac ATS]], [[Cadillac CTS-V|CTS-V]], [[Cadillac DTS|DTS]], [[Cadillac XLR|XLR]], [[Cadillac SRX|SRX]], [[Cadillac STS|STS]], [[Chevrolet Corvette]], [[Chevrolet Camaro|Camaro ZL1]], [[Ferrari 458 Italia]], [[Ferrari 599GTB|599GTB]], [[Ferrari F12berlinetta|F12 Berlinetta]], [[Shelby GT350]], [[HSV Clubsport#E Series (2006–present)|Holden HSV E-Series]] and [[Lamborghini Huracán]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; These systems were produced by the [[Delphi Corporation]] and now by [[Beijing West Industries|BWI Group]] under the proprietary name [[MagneRide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://delphi.com/news/pressReleases/pressReleases_2006/pr_2006_11_30_001/ |title=Press Release: Audi R8 Features Delphi's Revolutionary MagneRide Semi-Active Suspension |publisher=Delphi.com |accessdate=2013-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ferrari F12 Berlinetta news and pictures new Ferrari supercar |url=http://www.evo.co.uk/news/evonews/279502/new_ferrari_f12_berlinetta_revealed.html |publisher=[[Evo (magazine)|evo]] |date=2012-02-29 |accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aviation===
MRF-based dampers are excellent candidates for stability augmentation of the lead-lag (in-plane bending) mode of rotor blades in helicopters.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://dx.doi.org/10.4050/JAHS.44.234 “Characterization of Magnetorheological Helicopter Lag Dampers.”] G.M. Kamath, N.M. Wereley, and M.R. Jolly (1999).  J. American Helicopter Society, 44(3):234–248.&lt;/ref&gt;
MRF-based squeeze film dampers are being designed for use in the [[rotary wing]] industry to isolate vibrations from the aircraft structure and crew.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijrm/2004/546845/abs/ A Magnetorheological Fluid Damper for Rotor Applications&lt;/ref&gt;

==Control==
A magnetorheological damper is controlled by algorithms specifically designed for the purpose. There are plenty of alternatives, such as skyhook or groundhook algorithms.&lt;ref name="MRD"&gt;[http://www.magnetorheologicaldamper.com/controlling-semi-active-viscous-damper-with-groundhook-algorithm Magnetorheological Damper Laboratory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425064345/http://www.magnetorheologicaldamper.com/controlling-semi-active-viscous-damper-with-groundhook-algorithm |date=2012-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the algorithms is to control the [[yield point shear stress]] of the magnetorheological fluid with [[electric current]]. When the fluid is in the presence of an applied [[magnetic field]], the suspended metal particles align according to the [[field line]]s. [[Viscosity]] of the fluid increases according to the intensity of the magnetic field. When this occurs at the right instant, the properties of the damper change helps in attenuating an undesired shock or vibration. The relative efficacy of magnetorheological dampers to active and passive control strategies is usually comparable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=ALY|first=Aly Mousaad|author2=Richard Christenson|title=On the evaluation of the efficacy of a smart damper: a new equivalent energy-based probabilistic approach|journal=Smart Materials and Structures|year=2008|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/0964-1726/17/4/045008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medicinal fungi''' are those [[fungi]] which produce medically significant [[metabolite]]s or can be induced to produce such metabolites using [[biotechnology]]. The range of medically active compounds that have been identified include [[antibiotic]]s, [[anti-cancer drug]]s, [[cholesterol]] inhibitors, [[psychotropic]] drugs, [[Immunosuppressive drug|immunosuppressants]] and even [[fungicide]]s. Although initial discoveries centred on simple moulds of the type that cause spoilage of food, later work identified useful compounds across a wide range of fungi.

==History==
Although fungi products have been used in traditional and folk [[medicines]], probably since pre-history, the ability to identify beneficial properties and then extract the active ingredient started with the discovery of [[penicillin]] by [[Alexander Fleming]] in 1928. Since that time, many additional antibiotics have been discovered and the potential for fungi to synthesize biologically active molecules, useful in a wide range of clinical therapies, has been extensively exploited.

[[Pharmacological Research|Pharmacological research]] has now isolated [[antifungal]], [[Antiviral drug|antiviral]], and [[Antiprotozoal|antiprotozoan]], isolates from fungi.&lt;ref name="pmid9705612"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Engler M, Anke T, Sterner O | title=Production of antibiotics by Collybia nivalis, Omphalotus olearis, a Favolaschia and a Pterula species on natural substrates. | journal=Z Naturforsch C | year=1998 | volume=53 | issue=5–6 | pages=318–24 | doi=| pmc=| pmid=9705612  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
      
The fungus with probably the longest record of medicinal use, ''[[Lingzhi mushroom|Ganoderma lucidum]]'', is known in Chinese as líng zhī ("spirit plant"), and in Japanese as mannentake ("10,000-year mushroom"). In ancient Japan, ''[[Grifola frondosa]]'' was worth its weight in silver, although no significant therapeutic benefits have been demonstrated in humans.&lt;ref name=acs-maitake&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.org/Treatment/TreatmentsandSideEffects/ComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine/DietandNutrition/maitake-mushrooms |publisher=American Cancer Society |title=Maitake Mushroom |work=Complementary and Alternative Medicine : Diet and Nutrition |year=2008 |accessdate=2011-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown another species of  genus ''[[Ganoderma]]'', ''[[Ganoderma applanatum|G. applanatum]]'', contains compounds with anti-tumor and anti-fibrotic properties.

''[[Inonotus obliquus]]'' was used in Russia as early as the 16th century, and it featured in [[Alexandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s 1967 novel ''[[Cancer Ward]]''.&lt;ref name="pmid20532760"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zheng |first1=Weifa |last2=Miao |first2=Kangjie |last3=Liu |first3=Yubing |last4=Zhao |first4=Yanxia |last5=Zhang |first5=Meimei |last6=Pan |first6=Shenyuan |last7=Dai |first7=Yucheng |title=Chemical diversity of biologically active metabolites in the sclerotia of Inonotus obliquus and submerged culture strategies for up-regulating their production |journal=Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology |volume=87 |issue=4 |pages=1237–54 |year=2010 |pmid=20532760 |doi=10.1007/s00253-010-2682-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography==

A native of the [[United States]], Michael Greenstone earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in economics from [[Swarthmore College]] in 1991 and a [[Ph.D]] in economics from [[Princeton University]] in 1998. Thereafter, he worked as a [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation|Robert Wood Johnson Scholar]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (UCB, 1998-2000) before becoming an assistant professor of economics at the [[University of Chicago]] (2003–06). In 2006, Greenstone moved to [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], first as associate professor (2003–06) and then as the 3M Professor of Environmental Economics (2006–14). During his tenure at MIT, Greenstone also held visiting appointments at UCB, the University of California Energy Institute, and [[Stanford University]].

=== Economic effects of air pollution===

How does air pollution affect economic outcomes? To investigate this question, Michael Greenstone and Kenneth Y. Chay use geographic variation in the reduction of air pollution due to the 1981-82 recession to estimate the impact of air pollution on [[infant mortality]] in the U.S.; they find that reducing TSPs by 1% results in a 0.35% decline in the county-level mortality rate of infants, with most of the reduction concerning newborn deaths, in particular among [[Afro Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/qjecon/v118y2003i3p1121-1167..html Chay, K., Greenstone, M. (2003). The Impact of Air Pollution on Infant Mortality: Evidence from Geographic Variation in Pollution Shocks Induced by a Recession. ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 118(3), pp. 1121-1167.]&lt;/ref&gt; In another study with Chay, Greenstone exploits the impact of the U.S. [[Clean Air Act (United States)|1970 and 1977 amendments to the Clean Air Act]], which set a federal ceiling for [[suspended particulate matter|total suspended particulates]] (TSPs), empowered the newly created [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] to designate "non-attainment" counties in excess of that ceiling, and to impose strict air quality regulations on polluters in such counties, on housing prices, to study the relationship between housing prices and air quality. They find that the legislation was effective in reducing TSP air pollution and, based on an elasticity of housing values with regard to TSP concentration ranging from -0.20 to -0.35, that the improvements in air quality between 1970 and 1980 attributable to the regulations imposed under the non-attainment designation caused an increase of housing values in non-attainment counties worth $45 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/jpolec/v113y2005i2p376-424.html Chay, K.Y., Greenstone, M. (2005). Does Air Quality Matter? Evidence from the Housing Market. ''Journal of Political Economy'', 113(2), pp. 376-424.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Greenstone also finds that the Clean Air Act's non-attainment designation probably played only a minor role in the 80% reduction of [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO2) concentrations in the [[United States]], possibly because regulators assigned the SO2 non-attainment designation to many counties that hadn't even exceeded SO2 ceilings for a single day and consequently didn't impose excessively strict regulatory oversight.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jeeman/v47y2004i3p585-611.html Greenstone, M. (2004). Did the Clean Air Act cause the remarkable decline in sulfur dioxide concentrations? ''Journal of Environmental Economics and Management'', 47(3), pp. 585-611.]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Greenstone also analysed the impact of the 1970 and 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments on industrial activity in the U.S. and found that pollution-intensive in "non-attainment" counties lost ca. 590,000 jobs, $37 billion in capital stock, and $75 billion (at 1987 U.S. dollars) of output over 1972-87 as a consequence of the greater regulatory oversight exercised by EPA.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/jpolec/v110y2002i6p1175-1219.html Greenstone, M. (2002). The Impacts of Environmental Regulations on Industrial Activity: Evidence from the 1970 and 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments and the Census of Manufactures. ''Journal of Political Economy'', 110(6), pp. 1175-1219.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic effects of climate change===

Together with Olivier Deschênes, Michael Greenstone initially found that climate change will increase agricultural profits in the U.S. over 2010-2100 by an average of $1.3 billion per year (in 2002 U.S. dollars) and that the measurement of climate change effects on land prices (the hedonic approach) is extremely sensitive to seemingly minor choices about control variables, sample, and weighting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v97y2007i1p354-385.html Deschênes, O., Greenstone, M. (2007). The Economic Impacts of Climate Change: Evidence from Agricultural Output and Random Fluctuations in Weather. ''American Economic Review'', 97(1), pp. 354-385.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, following Fisher et al.'s (2012) critique with regard to data coding errors and conceptual oversights in Deschênes and Greenstone (2007),&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v102y2012i7p3749-60.html Fisher, A.C. et al. (2012). The Economic Impacts of Climate Change: Evidence from Agricultural Output and Random Fluctuations in Weather: Comment. ''American Economic Review'', 102(7), pp. 3749-3760.]&lt;/ref&gt; Deschênes and Greenstone subsequently re-estimated climate change to ''decrease'' U.S. agricultural profits by $4.5 billion per year over 2010-2100.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v102y2012i7p3761-73.html Deschênes, O., Greenstone, M. (2012). The Economic Impacts of Climate Change: Evidence from Agricultural Output and Random Fluctuations in Weather: Reply. ''American Economic Review'', 102(7), pp. 3761-3773.]&lt;/ref&gt; In another collaboration, Greenstone and Deschênes study the relationship between climate change and mortality and its mitigation through adaptation, and estimate that under "business-as-usual" scenarios climate change will increase the age-adjusted mortality rate in the U.S. by 3% by the end of the 21st century, though this effect may be strongly mitigated through populations adapting to the expected increase in the frequency of extreme temperature days.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aejapp/v3y2011i4p152-85.html Deschênes, O., Greenstone, M. (2011). Climate Change, Mortality, and Adaptation: Evidence from Annual Fluctuations in Weather in the US. ''American Economic Journal: Applied Economics'', 3(4), pp. 152-185.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental and energy economics===

Together with Hunt Allcott, Greenstone reconsiders the evidence in favour of an [[energy efficiency gap]], i.e. whether consumers and firms fail to invest as much into energy efficiency as the expected increases in terms of utility or profits due to such investments would warrant. Overall, they cannot substantiate claims of a widespread energy efficiency gap, though their differentiation of specific investment inefficiency types leads them to conclude that policies aimed at addressing a supposed energy efficiency gap must be targeted to those consumer subject to investment inefficiencies if they are to be at all effective.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/jecper/v26y2012i1p3-28.html Allcott, H., Greenstone, M. (2012). Is There an Energy Efficiency Gap? ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', 26(1), pp. 3-28.]&lt;/ref&gt;

How much do people value the removal of [[hazardous waste]]? Investigating this question, Greenstone and Justin Gallagher use a [[regression discontinuity design]] to compare the reaction of housing market prices at hazardous waste sites that narrowly qualified to benefit from [[Superfund]] cleanups relative to those who narrowly missed qualifying. They find the reaction to be economically small and statistically insignificant, suggesting that the average local benefits of Superfund cleanups are likely to be much lower than the cleanups' average cost of $43 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/qjecon/v123y2008i3p951-1003..html Greenstone, M., Gallagher, J. (2008). Does Hazardous Waste Matter? Evidence from the Housing Market and the Superfund Program. ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 123(3), pp. 951-1003.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In environmental economics as well as in other areas, Greenstone has strongly advocated for the greater application of (quasi-)experimental methods to identify which policies are effective and efficient in terms of increasing social welfare.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jeeman/v57y2009i1p21-44.html Greenstone, M., Gayer, T. (2009). Quasi-experimental and experimental approaches to environmental economics. ''Journal of Environmental Economics and Management'', 57(1), pp. 21-44.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Miscellany ===

How does the opening of a new manufacturing plant affect the productivity of incumbent manufacturing plants? Studying this question with [[Richard Hornbeck]] and [[Enrico Moretti]], Greenstone finds that 
the TFP of incumbent plants in counties that were selected as the site for the opening of a new plant increase 12% more than in their runner-up competitors, with the agglomeration spillovers being particularly large if the old and new plants are similar. However, they also find that the wage growth in "winning" counties caused by the increased local labour demand tends to exceed productivity growth, thus reducing plant profits.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/jpolec/v118y2010i3p536-598.html Greenstone, M., Hornbeck, R., Moretti, E. (2010). Identifying Agglomeration Spillovers: Evidence from Winners and Losers of Large Plant Openings. ''Journal of Political Economy'', 118(3), pp. 536-598.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Exploiting the 1987 federal permission to [[U.S. state]]s to only raise the [[National Maximum Speed Law|speed limit]] on their rural interstates from 55&amp;nbsp;mph (ca. 90 kmh) to 65&amp;nbsp;mph (ca. 105 kmh), Greenstone and [[Orley Ashenfelter]] compare the time saved due to the increase in speed limit with the increase in fatality rates (an increasy by ca. 35%) to estimate the [[value of statistical life|value of a statistical life]]. They find that approximately 125,000 hours were saved per lost life, suggesting (if hours saved are valued at the average hourly wage) an upper bound of $1.54 million (in 1997 U.S. dollars) as a value of a statistical life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/jpolec/v112y2004is1ps226-s267.html Ashenfelter, O., Greenstone, M. (2004). Using Mandated Speed Limits to Measure the Value of a Statistical Life. ''Journal of Political Economy'', 112(1), pp. 226-267.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, Greenstone, [[Paul Oyer]] and Annette Vissing-Jorgensen use the extension of mandatory disclosure requirements under the 1964 Securities Acts Amendments from listed stock to [[over the counter]] (OTC) stock trades on stock returns. They find that the announcement of compliance with disclosure requirements by those OTC firms most likely to be affected by the change in regulation was accompanied by abnormal excess stock returns of ca. 3.5% in the weeks surrounding the announcement and that expectations regarding the extension of regulations resulted in abnormal excess returns ranging from 11.5 to 22.1% in the period between legislative proposal and enforcement, suggesting large-scale insider trading at OTC firms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/qjecon/v121y2006i2p399-460..html Greenstone, M., Oyer, P., Vissing-Jorgensen, A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3172">The '''National Association of Primary Care''' is a membership association for clinicians and managers in the [[National Health Service]].

Dr Nav Chana is the chair of the association.  It has offices in London.

Until 1998 it was called the National Association of Commissioning GPs and many of its members were involved with [[GP Fundholding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Doctors' lobby group changes name to broaden primary care base|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/home/leaders-signal-merger-of-primary-care-lobby-groups/32298.article|accessdate=25 January 2017|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=22 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is involved in the development of plans associated with the [[Five Year Forward View]] for bringing GP practices together across populations of up to 50,000 patients in what it calls the 'primary care home'. This is similar to the multispeciality community provider model, but on a smaller scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Huge appetite' for primary care at scale, says NHS England chief|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/sectors/primary-care/huge-appetite-for-primary-care-at-scale-says-nhs-england-chief/7014020.article|accessdate=25 January 2017|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been implemented in 15 pilot sites during 2016, covering around 500,000 patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Primary care model for 50,000-patient groups to be extended across England|url=http://www.gponline.com/primary-care-model-50000-patient-groups-extended-across-england/article/1402112|accessdate=25 January 2017|publisher=GP Online|date=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Occupational therapists, mental health therapists, clinical pharmacists and other clinical professionals are given a more prominent role in these organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How occupational therapists help keep older people out of hospital|url=https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/jun/30/occupational-therapists-primary-care-keeping-older-people-out-of-hospital|accessdate=25 January 2017|publisher=Guardian|date=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Nuffield Trust]] produced a preliminary report on it in August 2017, which was quite positive, but found would need time, money and strong working relationships across the NHS and social care to be effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New primary care model needs resources, say experts|url=https://www.onmedica.com/NewsArticle.aspx?id=e9635f31-4faf-4cd1-9c3d-bbcba720aff6|accessdate=8 October 2017|publisher=OnMedica|date=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Simon Stevens (NHS England)|Simon Stevens]] addressed a meeting of the association in October 2016 to explain plans for capital investment in 300 GP practices using the £900 million Estates and Technology Transformation Fund between 2016 and 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS England sets out funding for GP infrastructure, indemnity and mental health|url=http://www.gponline.com/nhs-england-sets-funding-gp-infrastructure-indemnity-mental-health/article/1412780|accessdate=25 January 2017|publisher=GP Online|date=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''night owl''', '''evening person''' or simply '''owl''', is a person who tends to stay up until late at night. In several countries, especially in [[Scandinavia]], early birds are called ''A-people'' and night owls are called ''B-people''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2370239,00.html|title=Late Sleepers in Denmark Rally for Societal Change|last=James|first=Kyle|date=1 March 2007|accessdate=2009-11-01|publisher=Deutsche Welle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6749791.stm|title=Late risers unite in Denmark|last=Morris|first=Chris|date=14 June 2007|accessdate=2009-11-01|publisher=BBC News Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Night owls who are involuntarily unable to fall asleep for several hours after a normal time may have [[Delayed sleep phase disorder|delayed sleep phase syndrome]]. 

The opposite of a night owl is an [[lark (person)|early bird]] – a [[Lark (person)|lark]] as opposed to an owl – which is someone who tends to begin sleeping at a time that is considered early and also wakes early.  Researchers traditionally use the terms ''morningness'' and ''eveningness''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Horne JA, Östberg O |title=A self-assessment questionnaire to determine morningness-eveningness in human circadian rhythms |journal=Int J Chronobiol |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=97–110 |year=1976 |pmid=1027738}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the two [[chronotype]]s or [[diurnality]] and [[nocturnality]] in animal behavior. 

==Etymology==

[[File:Asio otus uszatka1.JPG|thumb|Owls, like this one in Poland, are often nocturnal.]]

The term is derived from the primarily nocturnal habits of the [[owl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/night--owl?s=t|title=Night owl|last=|first=|date=|website=www.dictionary.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most owls sleep during the day and hunt for food at night.

==Characteristics==

Usually, people who are night owls stay awake past midnight, and extreme night owls may stay awake until just before or even after dawn.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Klein, ''Time'' (2008) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Night owls tend to feel most energetic just before they go to sleep at night. 

Some night owls have a preference or habit for staying up late, or stay up to work the [[shift work|night shift]]. Night owls who work the day shift often have difficulties adapting to standard daytime working hours.

Night owls have often been blamed for unpunctuality or attitude problems.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/85817911|title=Insomniac|last=Greene|first=Gayle|date=|publisher=University of California Press|year=2008|isbn=9780520259966|location=Berkeley|pages=345|oclc=85817911}}&lt;/ref&gt; Employers, however, have begun to learn to increase productivity by respecting body clocks through flexible working hours,&lt;ref&gt;Klein, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; while the Danish "B-Society" of night owls&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and the American [[Start School Later movement]] lobby actively for more school and workplace flexibility for the post-agricultural world.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Some research has found that night owls are more intelligent and creative and more likely to get high-paying jobs than larks. A study among 1000 adolescents by the University of Madrid found that owls are better than early birds in intuitive intelligence, [[creative thinking]] and [[Inductive reasoning aptitude|inductive reasoning]]. However, they lag behind larks in academic performance,&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/if-you-want-to-get-ahead-be-a-night-owl-8547115.html IF YOU WANT TO GET AHEAD, BE A NIGHT OWL]" by Roger Dobson; ''THE INDEPENDENT'' March 24, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and they tend to have unhealthier eating habits.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, R. J., Christopher, A. N., Wieth, M. B., &amp; Buchanan, J. (2015). Personality, time-of-day preference, and eating behavior: The mediational role of morning-eveningness. Personality and Individual Differences, 77, 13–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some night owls with great difficulty adopting normal [[sleep]]ing and waking times may have [[Delayed sleep phase disorder|delayed sleep-phase disorder]]. Morning [[light therapy]] may be helpful in shifting sleep rhythms for the night owl.&lt;ref&gt;Laura H. Smith/Charles H. Elliott, ''Seasonal Affective Disorder for Dummies'' (2007) p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factors ==
The tendency to be a night owl exists on a [[spectrum]], with most people being typical, some people having a small or moderate tendency to be a night owl, and a few having an extreme tendency to be a night owl.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roenneberg|first=Till|last2=Merrow|first2=Martha|date=23 May 2016|title=The Circadian Clock and Human Health|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982216303335|journal=Current Biology|volume=26|issue=10|pages=R432–R443|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2016.04.011|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An individual's own tendency can change over time and is influenced by multiple factors, including:

* a genetic predisposition, which can cause the tendency to run in families,
* the person's age, with teenagers and young adults tending to be night owls more than young children or elderly people, and
* the environment the person lives in, especially the patterns of light they are exposed to through seasonal changes as well as through lifestyle (such as spending the day indoors and using electric lights in the evening).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The genetic make-up of the [[Circadian rhythm|circadian timing system]] underpins the difference between early and late chronotypes, or early birds and night owls.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Lee Williams, ''On the Morning'' (2006) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;   While it has been suggested that circadian rhythms may change over time, including dramatic changes that turn a morning lark to a night owl or vice versa,&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Belanger/Kirsten Dalley, ''The Nightmare Encyclopedia'' (2005) p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walker, R. J., Kribs, Z. D., Christopher, A. N., Shewach, O. R., &amp; Wieth, M. B. (2014). Age, the Big Five, and time-of-day preference: A mediational model. Personality and Individual Differences, 56, 170–174.&lt;/ref&gt; evidence for familial patterns of early or late waking would seem to contradict this, and individual changes are likely on a smaller scale.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
A 2007 survey of over 55,000 people found that [[Chronotype|chronotypes]] tend to follow a [[normal distribution]], with extreme morning and evening types on the far ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roenneberg|first=Till|last2=Kuehnle|first2=Tim|last3=Juda|first3=Myriam|last4=Kantermann|first4=Thomas|last5=Allebrandt|first5=Karla|last6=Gordijn|first6=Marijke|last7=Merrow|first7=Martha|date=December 2007|title=Epidemiology of the human circadian clock|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1087079207000895|journal=Sleep Medicine Reviews|volume=11|issue=6|pages=429–438|doi=10.1016/j.smrv.2007.07.005|issn=1087-0792|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career options ==
Night owls tend to thrive in careers that do not require working in the early morning. People who want to work in the evening are often employed at restaurants, hotels, entertainment venues, retail stores, and some [[personal care]] businesses.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2015/article/night-owls-and-early-birds.htm|title=Career Outlook:  Careers for night owls and early birds|last=Torpey|first=Elka|date=October 2015|website=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Night owls who work the night shift may work in [[Emergency service|emergency services]], in transportation, or at round-the-clock facilities, such as hospitals and some manufacturing plants.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Many businesses that operate in the evening or at night need employees at all levels, from entry-level employees to managers to skilled staff, whenever they are open.  For example, most hospitals employ many types of workers around the clock: 

* non-medical staff such as security guards, [[Technology Specialist|IT specialists]], cleaning and maintenance workers, cooks and food service staff, and admissions clerks;
* medical staff such as nurses, [[Paramedic|paramedics]], radiology technicians, [[Pharmacist|pharmacists]], and [[phlebotomists]];
* managers for each of the main hospital wards or activities, including janitorial supervisors and [[Head nurse|head nurses]].

Industries that tend to be less favorable to night owls include farming, construction, and working for [[Public utility|public utilities]].  Many employees in these industries start working before 7:00 a.m.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8298">'''Nikolai Evgenievich Khokhlov''' ([[Cyrillic]]: Николай Евгеньевич Хохлов) (7 June 1922, [[Nizhny Novgorod]] - 17 September 2007 [[San Bernardino, California]]) was a [[KGB]] officer who defected to the [[United States]] in 1954. He testified about KGB activities. The KGB unsuccessfully tried to kill him with poison in 1957.

==Family background==
Khokhlov's parents divorced when he was very young. He was not well-acquainted with his father, who later served as a [[commissar]] in the [[Red Army]]. During the [[Battle for Moscow]], the elder Khokhlov was transferred to a [[penal battalion]] because he had made unfavourable remarks about [[Joseph Stalin]]. Khokhlov's father died in the battalion.

His stepfather, a lawyer, volunteered to defend [[Moscow]] in 1941 and died in action almost immediately. As Khokhlov later put it, "The army needed cannon fodder".&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Nagorski: The Greatest Battle, 2007, pp. 198-199

In October 1941, Khokhlov, then 19 years old, was a member of an [[NKVD]] quartet who were trained to commit a spectacular attack against [[Nazi]] officers during their victory celebration in the occupied [[Moscow]]. The mastermind behind the plan was [[Mikhail Maklyarskiy]], a senior NKVD official. The four young agents would have played a vaudeville group on the celebration. Khokhlov was chosen for his role on his whistling abilities. During the training, he had his first great romance with fellow agent, singer [[Tasya Ignatova]]. After the German retreat from the outskirts of Moscow, the deadly show was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Nagorski: The Greatest Battle, 2007, pp. 196-198&lt;/ref&gt;

Nikolai Khokhlov was a member of a successful military unit that fought behind the enemy lines during [[World War II]]. He was disguised as a Nazi officer after parachuting into German-occupied [[Belarus]]. He played a part in the assassination of [[Wilhelm Kube]], the Nazi [[Gauleiter]] of [[Belarus]]. After the war, Khokhlov became the prototype for the main character in a 1947 Soviet film, [[Secret Agent (1947 film)|''Feat of a Scout'']] ("Подвиг разведчика").

==Assassination mission==
In 1954, Khokhlov was sent by the [[KGB]] to supervise two other men whose task was to kill Georgiy Okolovich, a chairman of the [[National Alliance of Russian Solidarists]]. He decided not to follow the order and discussed the situation with his wife, Yana, who said, "If this man is killed, you will be a murderer. I cannot be the wife of a murderer."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2480635,00.html Times Online]&lt;/ref&gt; Khokhlov went to Okolovich's flat in [[Frankfurt]] and told him: "Georgiy Sergeyevich, I have come to you from Moscow. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has ordered your assassination. The murder is entrusted to my group... I can’t let this murder happen."&lt;ref name="Andrew"&gt;*[[Christopher Andrew (historian)|Christopher Andrew]] and [[Vasili Mitrokhin]], ''The [[Mitrokhin Archive]]: The KGB in Europe and the West'', Gardners Books (2000), {{ISBN|0-14-028487-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In retaliation, his wife was arrested and sentenced to five years of [[Involuntary settlements in the Soviet Union|involuntary settlement]] in the Soviet Union. Khokhlov defected to the United States following his failure to carry out the assassination order.

==Poisoning by thallium==
Khokhlov was treated for [[thallium]] poisoning in Frankfurt in 1957,&lt;ref&gt;[http://2004.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2004/46n/n46n-s10.shtml Meeting with past (Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of a failed assassination attempt by the [[Thirteenth Department]] of the [[KGB]].&lt;ref name="Andrew"/&gt; This case is often claimed to be the first [[radiological poisoning|radiological attack]] by the [[KGB]], especially when comparison with the [[poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko]]&lt;ref name="dissident"&gt;[[Alexander Goldfarb (microbiologist)|Alex Goldfarb]] and Marina Litvinenko. ''[[Death of a dissident|Death of a Dissident: The Poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko and the Return of the KGB]]'',  The Free Press (2007) {{ISBN|1-4165-5165-4}}; Boris Volodarsky. ''[[The KGB's Poison Factory: From Lenin to Litvinenko]]'', Frontline Books (2009) {{ISBN|978-1-84832-542-5}},&lt;/ref&gt; is drawn, although it remains unclear what isotope was used, if any.&lt;ref name=hps&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hps.org/publicinformation/ate/q6833.html |title=Category: Radiation Basics |access-date=2008-04-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019100238/https://hps.org/publicinformation/ate/q6833.html |archive-date=2007-10-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former KGB officer Stanislav Lekarev claimed, however, that Khokhlov was poisoned by radioactive polonium (not thallium), exactly as Litvinenko was.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|zruZjhvJ0VQ|Who Killed Litvinenko? - Russia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Litvinenko's poisoning was also initially mistaken for thallium.

==Life in the United States==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
After graduating with a PhD from [[Duke University]], Khokhlov taught undergraduate and graduate psychology classes at [[California State University, San Bernardino]] from 1968 to 1992. He retired as a professor emeritus in 1993. In 1992, Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] pardoned him.  Khokhlov returned to Moscow for a short stay, for the first time since the 1950s. He later made an e-mail contact with, then eventually met, his son in Russia of whom he had not been previously aware. In the United States, Khokhlov married again. With his second wife Tanja, he had two daughters and a son, Misha, who died several years later due to a kidney failure.

In 2006, Khokhlov compared his poisoning half a century ago to the murder of Litvinenko. "The situation within Russia today is very perilous. There are no more laws, and no more order. Putin brought back many KGB, and there are too many KGB at the top, the old dinosaurs who cannot get rid of old habits", he added.

Nikolai Khokhlov died of a heart attack in San Bernardino, California, in September 2007. He was buried next to the grave of his son.

'''The Nyumbani Children's Home''' was founded by Father Angelo D'Agostino and Sister Mary Owens in 1992 to serve mostly [[Child abandonment|abandoned children]] created by the [[AIDS]] [[pandemic]].&lt;ref name=MakeAMark-OrphanageProfile-2010&gt;{{cite news|title=Nyumbani Orphanage (Karen, Kenya): A "home" for Abandoned Children|url=http://www.makeamark.org/nyumbani.aspx|accessdate=23 September 2016|work=Make A Mark|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104115523/http://www.makeamark.org/nyumbani.aspx|archivedate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, three more programs (Nyumbani Village, Lea Toto and Nyumbani Diagnostic Laboratory) have been added to the organization.

== Background ==
Originally a medical doctor in the US Air Force, D'Agostino joined the [[Jesuits]] early in his career, focused on psychiatry, and held various teaching positions. But it was through his experience working with multiple Jesuit charities that D'Agostino learned of the dire need for specialized facilities for abandoned children in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]. Today over 100 orphans or abandoned children live at Nyumbani Children's Home located in [[Karen, Kenya|Karen]], Nairobi.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1998, the recognition that there was a need to expand the basic initiative of Nyumbani Home to other locales gave birth to the Lea Toto program. This is "a community-based outreach program providing services to HIV+ children and their families in the Kangemi, Waithaka, Kawangware, Riruta, Mutuini, Ruthimitu, [[Kibera]] and [[Kariobangi]] communities of Nairobi, Kenya."&lt;ref name=Nyumbani-LeaToto-2011&gt;{{cite web|title=Lea Toto: The Need|url=http://www.nyumbani.org/lea_need.htm|website=Nyumbani|accessdate=23 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208191530/http://www.nyumbani.org/lea_need.htm|archivedate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nyumbani’s Lea Toto HIV/AIDS program operates eight centers and serves between 2,100 and 3,100 HIV-positive children and up to 15,000 family members every year.

In 2006, Nyumbani Village, which cares for over 1,000 children and 100 elderly grandparents, was established on 1,000 acres in Kitui County, Kenya.

The Nyumbani programs are supported by international boards the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]] and [[Kenya]]. In addition to individual donations and corporate sponsorships, the executive boards around the world raise critical operating funds, provide expertise and much-needed volunteers.

== Nyumbani Village ==
Based on past success, a related effort called '''Nyumbani Village''' was spawned to support both orphans and elders impacted by the AIDS pandemic.&lt;ref name=JNJ-NyumbaniVillage-2016&gt;{{cite news|title=Welcome to Nyumbani: The Village That Gives a Home—and Hope—to Children With HIV|url=http://www.blogjnj.com/2016/09/nyumbani-village-home-for-children-with-hiv/|accessdate=23 September 2016|work=[[Johnson &amp; Johnson]]|date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located on {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} donated by the [[Kitui District]] County Council, Nyumbani Village is conceived to support between 1280-1600 individuals via a self-sustaining agricultural based venture. Shortly after its inauguration, on 20 November 2006, Fr. D'Ag died. But with his organizational skills, this new venture also continued to prosper. In 2016 it had 120 employees tending to 100 elderly grandparents and 1000 children.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Children's Angel|last=Nese|first=Marco|work=Yearbook of the Society of Jesus: 2017|publisher=General Curia, Society of Jesus|year=2016|isbn=|location=Rome|pages=133–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, actress [[Danai Gurira]] presented a video about the village and the work being done in Africa as part of the 2016 [[Global Citizen Festival]] in [[New York City]]&lt;ref name=JNJ-IWasThere-Video-2016&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gurira|first1=Danai|title=I Was There|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZg1I5pCABU|website=[[Johnson &amp; Johnson]]|accessdate=23 September 2016|format=Video|date=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=People-Gurira-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=King|first1=Brittany|title=The Walking Dead's Danai Gurira: 'We Need a Helping Hand' for African Families Living with AIDS|url=http://www.people.com/article/walking-dead-danai-gurira-raising-awareness-aids-africa|accessdate=23 September 2016|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[BBC]] has covered its learning curve in the use of drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-28372121|title=Caring for Kenya's HIV orphans|last=Soy|first=Anne|date=2014-07-21|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pharmaceuticals company [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] is a sponsoring partner via [[Global Citizen Festival|Global Citizen]], in an outreach effort to promote social action and awareness.&lt;ref name=JNJ-Partner-Announcement-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Elker|first1=Jessica|last2=Booth|first2=M|title=Johnson &amp; Johnson Partners with Global Citizen to Improve the Trajectory of Human Health Around the World|url=http://www.jnj.com/news/all/Johnson-Johnson-Partners-with-Global-Citizen-to-Improve-the-Trajectory-of-Human-Health-Around-the-World|accessdate=23 September 2016|work=[[Johnson &amp; Johnson]]|date=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JNJ-TakesAVillage-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sneed|first1=Michael|title=Why It Really Does Take a Village to Make the World a Healthier Place|url=http://www.blogjnj.com/2016/09/global-citizen-festival-and-johnson-johnson/|accessdate=23 September 2016|work=[[Johnson &amp; Johnson]]|date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis==
In 1999 Per Villand was diagnosed with [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]]. At the end of 2005 he was paralysed for 90%: only the eye muscles were not affected. After planning the transition to [[end-of-life care]] in the terminal phase of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, he passed away on his birthday, October 15, 2007.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27557">'''Radiation-induced cognitive decline''' describes the possible correlation between [[radiation therapy]] and [[mild cognitive impairment]]. Radiation therapy is used mainly in the treatment of cancer. Radiation therapy can be used to cure care or shrink tumors that are interfering with quality of life. Sometimes radiation therapy is used alone; other times it is used in conjunction with chemotherapy and surgery. For people with brain tumors, radiation can be an effective treatment because chemotherapy is often less effective due to the blood–brain barrier.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Unfortunately for some patients, as time passes, people who received radiation therapy may begin experiencing deficits in their learning, memory, and spatial information processing abilities. The learning, memory, and spatial information processing abilities are dependent on proper [[hippocampus]] functionality. Therefore, any hippocampus dysfunction will result in deficits in learning, memory, and spatial information processing ability.

The [[hippocampus]] is one of two structures of the [[central nervous system]] where [[neurogenesis]] continues after birth. The other structure that undergoes neurogenesis is the [[olfactory bulb]]. Therefore, it has been proposed that neurogenesis plays some role in the proper functionality of the hippocampus and the olfactory bulb.&lt;ref name=pmid17593874&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1515/REVNEURO.2007.18.2.93 |title=Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis, Synaptic Plasticity and Memory: Facts and Hypotheses |year=2007 |last1=Bruel-Jungerman |first1=Elodie |last2=Rampon |first2=Claire |last3=Laroche |first3=Serge |journal=Reviews in the Neurosciences |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=93–114 |pmid=17593874}}&lt;/ref&gt; To test this proposal, a group of rats with normal hippocampal neurogenesis (control) were subjected to a placement recognition exercise that required proper hippocampus function to complete. Afterwards a second group of rats (experimental) were subjected to the same exercise but in that trial their neurogenesis in the hippocampus was arrested. It was found that the experimental group was not able to distinguish between its familiar and unexplored territory. The experimental group spent more time exploring the familiar territory, while the control group spent more time exploring the new territory. The results indicate that neurogenesis in the hippocampus is important for memory and proper hippocampal functionality.&lt;ref name=pmid12809684&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0306-4522(03)00199-4 |title=Arrested neuronal proliferation and impaired hippocampal function following fractionated brain irradiation in the adult rat |year=2003 |last1=Madsen |first1=T.M |last2=Kristjansen |first2=P.E.G |last3=Bolwig |first3=T.G |last4=Wörtwein |first4=G |journal=Neuroscience |volume=119 |issue=3 |pages=635–42 |pmid=12809684}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, if radiation therapy inhibits neurogenesis in the hippocampus it would lead to the cognitive decline observed in patients who have received this radiation therapy.
	
In animal studies discussed by Monje and Palmer in "Radiation Injury and Neurogenesis", it has been proven that radiation does indeed decrease or arrest neurogenesis altogether in the hippocampus. This decrease in neurogenesis is due to [[apoptosis]] of the neurons which usually occurs after irradiation. However it has not been proven whether the apoptosis is a direct result of the radiation itself or if there are other factors that cause neuronal apoptosis, namely changes in the hippocampus micro-environment or damage to the precursor pool.&lt;ref name=pmid12644738&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Michelle L. |last1=Monje |first2=Theo |last2=Palmer |title=Radiation injury and neurogenesis |journal=Current Opinion in Neurology |pmid=12644738 |year=2003 |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=129–34 |doi=10.1097/00019052-200304000-00002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Determining the exact cause of the cell apoptosis is important because then it may be possible to inhibit the apoptosis and reverse the effects of the arrested neurogenesis.

==Radiation therapy==
Ionizing radiation is classified as a neurotoxicant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/mrdd.10033 |title=Environmental factors associated with a spectrum of neurodevelopmental deficits |year=2002 |last1=Mendola |first1=Pauline |last2=Selevan |first2=Sherry G. |last3=Gutter |first3=Suzanne |last4=Rice |first4=Deborah |journal=Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Research Reviews |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=188–97 |pmid=12216063}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 cohort study concluded that irradiation of the brain with dose levels overlapping those imparted by [[computed tomography]] can, in at least some instances, adversely affect intellectual development.&lt;ref name=pmid16868634&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.328.7430.19 |title=Effect of low doses of ionising radiation in infancy on cognitive function in adulthood: Swedish population based cohort study |year=2004 |last1=Hall |first1=P. |journal=BMJ |volume=328 |issue=7430 |pages=19 |pmid=14703539 |last2=Adami |first2=HO |last3=Trichopoulos |first3=D |last4=Pedersen |first4=NL |last5=Lagiou |first5=P |last6=Ekbom |first6=A |last7=Ingvar |first7=M |last8=Lundell |first8=M |last9=Granath |first9=F |pmc=313898  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16868634 |year=2004 |last1=Asteriadis |first1=I |title=Low radiation doses; are they harmful in infancy? |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=2–4 |journal=Hellenic journal of nuclear medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Radiation therapy]] at doses around "23.4 [[Gray (unit)|Gy]]" was found to cause cognitive decline that was especially apparent in young children who underwent the treatment for cranial tumors, between the ages of 5 to 11. Studies found, for example, that the IQ of 5-year-old children declined each year after treatment by additional several IQ points, thereby the child's IQ decreased and decreased while growing older though may plateau at adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/lateeffects/HealthProfessional/page4|title=Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer |publisher=[[National Cancer Institute]]|date=12 April 2012 |accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radiation of 100 mGy to the head at infancy resulted in the beginning appearance of statistically significant cognitive-deficits in one Swedish/radiation-therapy follow-up study.&lt;ref name=pmid16868634/&gt; Radiation of 1300-1500mGy to the head at childhood was similarly found to be roughly the threshold dose for the beginning increase in statistically significant rates of schizophrenia.&lt;ref name=loganovsky/&gt;   

From soliciting for participants in a study and then examination of the [[Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki#Birth_defect_investigations|prenatally exposed at Hiroshima &amp; Nagasaki]], those who experienced the prompt burst of ionizing radiation at the 8-15 and 16–25 week periods after gestation were to, especially in the closest survivors, have a higher rate of severe mental retardation as well as variation in intelligence quotient (IQ) and school performance. It is uncertain, if there exists a threshold dose, under which one or more of these effects, of prenatal exposure to ionizing radiation, do not exist, though from analysis of the limited data, "0.1" [[Gray (unit)|Gy]] is suggested for both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/095530098141555 |title=Review: Radiation-related brain damage and growth retardation among the prenatally exposed atomic bomb survivors |year=1998 |last1=Otake |first1=M. |journal=International Journal of Radiation Biology |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=159–71 |pmid=9712546 |last2=Schull |first2=WJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=loganovsky&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2481/dsj.BR-04 |title=Do Low Doses of Ionizing Radiation Affect the Human Brain? |year=2009 |last1=Loganovsky |first1=K |journal=Data Science Journal |volume=8 |pages=BR13–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adult humans receiving an acute [[Total body irradiation|whole body]] incapacitating dose (30 Gy) have their performance degraded almost immediately and become ineffective within several hours. A dose of 5.3 Gy to 8.3 Gy is considered lethal within months to [[LD50|half of male adults]] but not immediately incapacitating. Personnel exposed to this amount of radiation have their cognitive performance degraded in two to three hours.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170125171152/https://ke.army.mil/bordeninstitute/published_volumes/nuclearwarfare/chapter1/chapter1.pdf NUCLEAR EVENTS AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES  by the Borden institute.

Chapter 7 BEHAVIORAL AND NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES WITH EXPOSURE TO IONIZING RADIATION ]&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on how physically demanding the tasks they must perform are, and remain in this disabled state at least two days. However, at that point they experience a recovery period and can perform non-demanding tasks for about six days, after which they relapse for about four weeks. At this time they begin exhibiting symptoms of radiation poisoning of sufficient severity to render them totally ineffective. Death follows for about half of males at approximately six weeks after exposure.

[[Nausea]] and [[vomiting]] generally occur within 24–48 hours after exposure to mild (1–2&amp;nbsp;[[Gray (unit)|Gy]]) doses of radiation.

==Acute ablation of precursor cells==
Recent studies have shown that  there is a decrease in neurogenesis in the hippocampus after irradiation therapy. The decrease in neurogenesis is the result of a reduction in the stem cell pool due to apoptosis. However, the question remains whether radiation therapy results in a complete ablation of the stem cell pool in the hippocampus or whether some stem cells survive. Animal studies have been performed by Monje and Palmer to determine if there is an acute ablation of the stem cell pool. In the study, rats were subjected to 10 Gy dosage of radiation. The 10 Gy radiation dosage is comparable to that used in irradiation therapy in humans. One month after the reception of the dosage, living [[precursor cells]] from these rats’ hippocampus were successfully isolated and cultured. Therefore, a complete ablation of the precursor cell pool by irradiation does not occur.&lt;ref name=pmid12644738/&gt;

==Precursor cell integrity==
[[Precursor cells]] may be damaged by radiation. This damage of the cells may prevent the precursor cells from differentiating into neurons and result in decreased neurogenesis. To determine whether the precursor cells are impaired in their ability to differentiate, two cultures were prepared by Fike et al. One of these cultures contained precursor cells from an irradiated rat’s hippocampus and the second culture contained non-irradiated precursor cells from a rat hippocampus. The precursor cells were then observed while they continued to develop. The results indicated that the irradiated culture contained a higher number of differentiated neuron and glial cells in comparison to the control. It was also found that the ratios of [[glial cells]] to neurons in both cultures were similar.&lt;ref name=pmid12161748&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nm749 |title=Irradiation induces neural precursor-cell dysfunction |year=2002 |last1=Monje |first1=Michelle L. |last2=Mizumatsu |first2=Shinichiro |last3=Fike |first3=John R. |last4=Palmer |first4=Theo D. |journal=Nature Medicine |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=955–62 |pmid=12161748}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results suggest that the radiation did not impair the precursor cells ability to differentiate into neurons and therefore neurogenesis is still possible.

==Alterations in hippocampus microenvironment==
The microenvironment is an important component to consider for precursor survival and differentiation. It is the microenvironment that provides the signals to the precursor cells that help it survive, proliferate, and differentiate. To determine if the microenvironment is altered as a result of radiation, an animal study was performed by Fike et al. where highly enriched, BrdU labeled, non-irradiated stem cells from a rat hippocampus were implanted into a hippocampus that was irradiated one month prior. The stem cells were allowed to remain in the live rat for 3–4 weeks. Afterwards, the rat was killed and the stem cells were observed using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. The results show that stem cell survival was similar to that found in a control subject (normal rat hippocampus); however, the number of neurons generated was decreased by 81%. Therefore, alterations of the microenvironment post radiation can lead to a decrease in neurogenesis.&lt;ref name=pmid12161748/&gt;

In addition, studies mentioned by Fike et al. found that there are two main differences between the hippocampus of an irradiated rat and a non-irradiated rat that are part of the microenvironment. There was a significantly larger number of activated microglia cells in the hippocampus of irradiated rats in comparison to non-irradiated rats.&lt;ref name=pmid12874001&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12874001 |year=2003 |last1=Mizumatsu |first1=S |last2=Monje |first2=ML |last3=Morhardt |first3=DR |last4=Rola |first4=R |last5=Palmer |first5=TD |last6=Fike |first6=JR |title=Extreme sensitivity of adult neurogenesis to low doses of X-irradiation |volume=63 |issue=14 |pages=4021–7 |journal=Cancer Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of microglia cells is characteristic of the inflammatory response which is most likely due to radiation exposure. Also the expected clustering of stem cells around the vasculature of the hippocampus was disrupted.&lt;ref name=pmid12161748/&gt; Therefore, focusing on the microglial activation, inflammatory response, and microvasculature may produce a direct link to the decrease in neurogenesis post irradiation.

===Inflammatory response affects neurogenesis===
Radiation therapy usually results in chronic inflammation, and in the brain this inflammatory response comes in the form of activated microglia cells. Once activated, these microglia cells start to release stress hormones and various pro-inflammatory [[cytokines]].&lt;ref name=pmid12874001/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid14615545&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1088417 |title=Inflammatory Blockade Restores Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis |year=2003 |last1=Monje |first1=M. L. |journal=Science |volume=302 |issue=5651 |pages=1760–5 |pmid=14615545 |last2=Toda |first2=H |last3=Palmer |first3=TD|bibcode=2003Sci...302.1760M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of what is released by the activated microglia cells, like the glucocorticoid stress hormone, may result in a decrease in neurogenesis. To investigate this concept, an animal study was performed by Monje et al. in order to determine the specific cytokines or stress hormones that were released by activated microglial cells that decrease neurogenesis in an irradiated hippocampus. In this study, microglia cells were exposed to bacterial [[lipopolysaccharide]] to elicit an inflammatory response, thus activating the microglia cells. These activated microglia were then co-cultured with normal hippocampal neural stem cells. Also, as a control, non-activated microglia cells were co-cultured with normal hippocampal neural stem cells. In comparing the two co-cultures, it was determined that neurogenesis in the activated microglia cell culture was 50% less than in the control. A second study was also performed to ensure that the decrease in neurogenesis was the result of released cytokines and not cell-to-cell contact of microglia and stem cells. In this study, neural stem cells were cultured on preconditioned media from activated microglia cells and a comparison was made with a neural stem cells cultured on plain media. The results of this study indicated that neurogenesis also showed a similar decrease in the preconditioned media culture versus the control.&lt;ref name=pmid14615545/&gt;

When microglia cells are activated, they release the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β, TNF-α, INF-γ, and IL-6. In order to identify the cytokines that decreased neurogenesis, Monje et al. allowed progenitor cells to differentiate while exposed to each cytokine. The results of the study showed that only the recombinant IL-6 and TNF-α exposure significantly reduced neurogenesis. Then the IL-6 was inhibited and neurogenesis was restored. This implicates IL-6 as the main cytokine responsible for the decrease of neurogenesis in the hippocampus.&lt;ref name=pmid14615545/&gt;

===Microvasculature and neurogenesis===
The microvasculature of the subgranular zone, located in dentate gyrus of hippocampus, plays an important role in neurogenesis. As precursor cells develop in the subgranular zone, they form clusters. These clusters usually contain dozens of cells. The clusters are made up of endothelial cells and  neuronal precursor cells that have the ability to differentiate into either neurons or glia cells. With time, these clusters eventually migrate towards microvessels in the subgranular zone. As the clusters get closer to the vessels, some of the precursor cells differentiate in glia cells and eventually the remaining precursor cells will differentiate into neurons. Upon investigation of the close association between the vessels and clusters, it is apparent that the actual migration of the precursor cells to these vessels is not random.&lt;ref name=pmid10975875&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/1096-9861(20001002)425:4&lt;479::AID-CNE2&gt;3.0.CO;2-3 |title=Vascular niche for adult hippocampal neurogenesis |year=2000 |last1=Palmer |first1=Theo D. |last2=Willhoite |first2=Andrew R. |last3=Gage |first3=Fred H. |journal=The Journal of Comparative Neurology |volume=425 |issue=4 |pages=479–94 |pmid=10975875}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since endothelial cells forming the vessel wall do secrete brain-derived neurotrophic factor, it is plausible that the neuronal precursor cells migrate to those regions in order to grow, survive, and differentiate.&lt;ref name=pmid12086642&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(02)00722-5 |title=Coordinated Interaction of Neurogenesis and Angiogenesis in the Adult Songbird Brain |year=2002 |last1=Louissaint Jr. |first1=Abner |last2=Rao |first2=Sudha |last3=Leventhal |first3=Caroline |last4=Goldman |first4=Steven A. |journal=Neuron |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=945–60 |pmid=12086642}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, since the clusters do contain endothelial cells, they might be attracted to the vascular endothelial growth factor that is released in the area of vessels to promote endothelial survival and angiogenesis.&lt;ref name=pmid12086642/&gt; However, as noted previously, clustering along the capillaries in the subgranular zone does decrease when the brain is subject to radiation.&lt;ref name=pmid12161748/&gt; The exact reasoning for this disruption of the close association between cluster and vessels remains unknown.  It is possible that any signaling that would normally attract the clusters to the region, for example the bone-derived growth factor and the vascular endothelial growth factor, may be suppressed.

==Reversal==

===Blocking inflammatory cascade===
Neurogenesis in the hippocampus usually decreases after exposure to radiation and usually leads to a cognitive decline in patients undergoing radiation therapy. As discussed above, the decrease in neurogenesis is heavily influenced by changes in the microenvironment of the hippocampus upon exposure to radiation. Specifically, disruption of the cluster/vessel association in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus and cytokines released by activated microglia as part of the inflammatory response do impair neurogenesis in the irradiated hippocampus. Thus several studies have used this knowledge to reverse the reduction in neurogenesis in the irradiated hippocampus. In one study, indomethacin treatment was given to the irradiated rat during and after irradiation treatment. It was found that the indomethacin treatment caused a 35% decrease in the number of activated microglia per dentate gyrus in comparison to microglia activation in irradiated rats without indomethacin treatment. This decrease in microglia activation reduces the amount of cytokines and stress-hormone release, thus reducing the effect of the inflammatory response. When the number of precursor cells adopting a neuronal fate was quantified, it was determined that the ratio of neurons to glia cells increased. This increase in neurogenesis was only 20-25% of that observed in control animals. However, in this study the inflammatory response was not eliminated entirely, and some cytokines or stress hormones continued to be secreted by the remaining activated microglia cells causing the reduction in neurogenesis.&lt;ref name=pmid14615545/&gt; In a second study, the inflammatory cascade was also blocked at another stage. This study focused mainly on the c-Jun NH2 – terminal kinase pathway which when activated results in the apoptosis of neurons. This pathway was chosen because, upon irradiation, it is the only mitogen-activated protein kinase that is activated. The mitogen-activated protein kinases are important for regulation of migration, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The JNK pathway is activated by cytokines released by activated microglia cells, and blocking this pathway significantly reduces neuronal apoptosis. In the study, the JNK was inhibited using 5 µM SP600125 dosage, and this resulted in a decrease of neural stem cells apoptosis. This decrease in apoptosis results in increased neuronal recovery.&lt;ref name=pmid16491125&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/sj.onc.1209414 |title=Ionizing radiation induces apoptosis and inhibits neuronal differentiation in rat neural stem cells via the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway |year=2006 |last1=Kanzawa |first1=T |last2=Iwado |first2=E |last3=Aoki |first3=H |last4=Iwamaru |first4=A |last5=Hollingsworth |first5=E F |last6=Sawaya |first6=R |last7=Kondo |first7=S |last8=Kondo |first8=Y |journal=Oncogene |volume=25 |issue=26 |pages=3638–48 |pmid=16491125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental enrichment===
In previous work, [[Environmental enrichment (neural)|environmental enrichment]] has been used to determine its effect on brain activity. In these studies, the environmental enrichment has positively impacted the brain functionality in both normal, healthy animals and animals that had suffered severe brain injury. It has already been shown by Elodie Bruel-Jungerman et al. that subjecting animals to learning exercises that are heavily dependent on the hippocampus results in increased neurogenesis.&lt;ref name=pmid17593874/&gt; Therefore, the question of whether environmental enrichment can enhance neurogenesis in an irradiated hippocampus is raised. In a study performed by Fan et al., the effects of environmental enrichment on gerbils were tested. There were four groups of gerbils used for this experiment, where group one consisted on non-irradiated animals that lived in a standard environment, group two were non-irradiated animals that lived in an enriched environment, group three were irradiated animals that lived in a standard environment, and group four were irradiated animals that lived in an enriched environment. After two months of maintaining the gerbils in the required environments, they were killed and hippocampal tissue was removed for analysis. It was found that the number of precursor neurons that were differentiated into neurons from group four (irradiated and enriched environment) was significantly more than group three (irradiated and standard environment). Similarly, the number of neuron precursor cells was more in group two (non-irradiated and enriched environment), in comparison to group one (non-irradiated and standard environment). The results indicate that neurogenesis was increased in the animals that were exposed to the enriched environment, in comparison to animals in the standard environment. This outcome indicates that environmental enrichment can indeed increase neurogenesis and reverse the cognitive decline.&lt;ref name=pmid17241265&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2006.05269.x |title=Environmental enrichment enhances neurogenesis and improves functional outcome after cranial irradiation |year=2007 |last1=Fan |first1=Yang |last2=Liu |first2=Zhengyan |last3=Weinstein |first3=Philip R. |last4=Fike |first4=John R. |last5=Liu |first5=Jialing |journal=European Journal of Neuroscience |volume=25 |pages=38–46 |pmid=17241265 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The college is affiliated with [[Chittagong University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cu.ac.bd/ctguni/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=80&amp;Itemid=191 |title=Affiliated Colleges |website=University of Chittagong |access-date=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students receive their MBBS degree under the [[University of Chittagong]] after completing 5th year course of study by passing the final professional MBBS examination.

This college is directly governed by [[Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council]] (BMDC) – an affiliation of the [[Ministry of health]]. The professional examinations are held under the university and results are given thereby. Internal examinations are also taken on regular intervals namely items, card completions, terms end and regular assessments.

==Academics==
The admission process of undergraduate MBBS course for all government medical colleges in Bangladesh is conducted centrally by the Director of Medical Education under DGHS under the [[Ministry of health]]. The test comprises a written MCQ exam, which is held simultaneously in all government medical colleges on the same day throughout the country. Candidates are selected for admission based on national merit and district, whether they are sons or daughters of freedom fighters, and to fill tribal quotas. For foreign students, admission is through the embassy of Bangladesh in their respective countries. The academic calendar for different years is maintained by respective departments. The admission test consists of the written MCQ exam.

The original scale introduced by Gunnar Borg rated exertion on a scale of 6-20. Borg then constructed a category (C) ratio (R) scale, the Borg CR10 Scale. This is especially used in clinical diagnosis of breathlessness and dyspnea, chest pain, angina and musculo-skeletal pain. The CR-10 scale is best suited when there is an overriding sensation arising either from a specific area of the body, for example, muscle pain, ache or fatigue in the quadriceps or from pulmonary responses.

The Borg scale can be compared to other linear scales such as the [[Likert scale]] or a [[visual analogue scale]]. The sensitivity and reproducibility of the results are broadly very similar, although the Borg may outperform the Likert scale in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Grant | first1 = S. | last2 = Aitchison | first2 = T. | last3 = Henderson | first3 = E. | last4 = Christie | first4 = J. | last5 = Zare | first5 = S. | last6 = McMurray | first6 = J. | last7 = Dargie | first7 = H. | title = A Comparison of the Reproducibility and the Sensitivity to Change of Visual Analogue Scales, Borg Scales, and Likert Scales in Normal Subjects During Submaximal Exercise | doi = 10.1378/chest.116.5.1208 | journal = Chest | volume = 116 | issue = 5 | pages = 1208–1217 | year = 1999 | pmid =  10559077| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Set points on the RPE scale==
The Borg RPE scale is a numerical scale that ranges from 6 to 20,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/measuring/exertion.html|publisher=CDC|title=Measuring Physical Activity Intensity}}&lt;/ref&gt; where 6 means "no exertion at all" and 20 means "maximal exertion." When a measurement is taken, a number is chosen from the following scale by an individual that best describes their level of exertion during physical activity.
*6&amp;nbsp;– No exertion at all
*7&amp;nbsp;– Extremely light
*8
*9&amp;nbsp;– Very light
*10

'''Refugee health care''' refers to the provision of health services to refugees and refugee claimants. As early as 2009, health researchers identified particular medical needs and health vulnerabilities amongst these populations.&lt;ref&gt;Newbold, B. "The Short-term Health of Canada’s New Immigrant Arrivals: Evidence from LSIC." Ethnicity &amp; Health 14.2 (2009): 315-36.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to other immigrants, they report more physical, emotional, and dental problems&lt;ref&gt;Newbold, B., and M. McKeary. "Barriers to Care: The Challenges for Canadian Refugees and Their Health-care Providers." Journal of Refugee Studies 23.3 (2010): 1-23.&lt;/ref&gt; and, compared to those born in Canada, they have higher rates of infections and chronic diseases that are both treatable and preventable.&lt;ref&gt;McNally, M. "Guidelines for Immigrant Health Appendix 16: Dental Disease: Evidence Review for Newly Arriving Immigrants and Refugees." Evidence-based Clinical Guidelines for Immigrants and Refugees. Canadian Medical Association, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, the federal government has been responsible for the provision of health care to refugees since 1957. In the international law context, this responsibility falls under Canada's human rights obligations to recognize the right to health for all, including refugees.

==Right to Health==

===Under International Law===

The concept of a “right to health” has been recognized in a number of international rights instruments to which Canada is a party.&lt;ref&gt;International Human Rights instruments that acknowledge a “right to health” to which Canada is a party include: The 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights: art. 12, the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination: art. 5 (e) (iv), the 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women: arts. 11 (1) (f), 12 and 14 (2) (b), the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child: art. 24, and the 2006 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities: art. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; It was first articulated in the 1946 Constitution of the [[World Health Organization]] as “the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health."&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of the World Health Organization (Official Records of the World Health Organization, no. 2, p. 100) and entered into force on 7 April 1948, art. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Article 25 of the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] also mentions the right to health as part of the [[right to an adequate standard of living]].&lt;ref&gt;Universal Declaration of Human Rights, G.A. res. 217A (III), U.N. Doc A/810 at 71 (1948).&lt;/ref&gt;  Some international human rights instruments acknowledge a right to health by general application and others through the protection of rights of specific groups such as women or children.  In 1966, the right to health was recognized as a human right in article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), which imposes an obligation on state parties to the Covenant to create “conditions which would assure to all medical service and medical attention in the event of sickness”.&lt;ref&gt;International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights GA res. 2200A (XXI), 21 UN GAOR Supp. (No. 16) at 49, UN Doc. A/6316 (1966); 993 UNTS 3; 6 ILM 368 (1967), art. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Canada===

The ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'' does not include any express protection of the right to health. The Canadian government has frequently argued in court that social and economic rights - including the right to health - are merely ‘policy objectives’ that are not subject to judicial intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, B. "Judging Poverty: Using International Human Rights Law to Refine the Scope of Charter Rights." Journal of Law and Social Policy 14 (2000): 139-40.&lt;/ref&gt; The ICESCR Committee has voiced concern over Canada's lack of compliance to these international obligations. It argues that such submissions are incompatible with Canada's obligations to provide remedies to violations of Covenant rights in domestic law.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Concluding Observations on Canada, E/C12/1993 (10 June 1993), para 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Charter'' Cases on the Right to Health====

Right to health claims under the ''Charter'''s section 15 equality provision have had limited success. In ''[[Eldridge v. British Columbia]]'', in the context of the provision of sign language, the Supreme Court found that the government should ensure that disadvantaged members of society have equal access to benefits.  The Court noted that any finding to the contrary would result in a “thin and impoverished view… of equality”.&lt;ref&gt;Eldridge v. British Columbia (Attorney General) [1997] 2 S.C.R. 624, para 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In a later case about the provision of autism services, ''[[Auton v. British Columbia]]'', the Court narrowed the ''Eldridge'' approach by requiring that protected benefits be ones “provided by law”.&lt;ref&gt;Auton (Guardian ad litem of) v. British Columbia (Attorney General), [2004] 3 S.C.R. 657, 2004 SCC 78, para 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though a substantive equality approach to section 15 has had limited success in remedying health and other social and economic rights violations of disadvantaged groups, Colleen Flood, one of Canada's leading health law professors, argues that failed claims can contribute to furthering equality by illuminating a problem and generating political support for its resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Colleen. "Charter Rights and Health Care Funding: A Typology of Canadian Health Rights Litigation." Annals Health L. 19 (2010): 479. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health Coverage for Refugees ==

=== Interim Federal Health Programme (IFHP) ===

In Canada, the provision of basic health care for refugees and refugee claimants is regulated by the Interim Federal Health Programme (IFHP) before they are covered by provincial or territorial health insurance plans. The IFHP was introduced through an Order-in-Council by the federal government in 1957&lt;ref&gt;Order in Council PC 157-11/848, June 20, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been managed by [[Citizenship and Immigration Canada]] since 1995. Prior to June 2012, the IFHP provided refugees and asylum seekers with basic health care coverage as well as supplemental coverage including access to medication, dentistry, and vision care.&lt;ref name="cic.gc.ca"&gt;Government of Canada, Citizenship and Immigration Canada, News Release, 2012: http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/department/media/releases/2012/2012-04-25.asp.&lt;/ref&gt; Those whose application for refugee status were denied retained coverage until they were deported.

==== 2012 Reform ====

The Canadian government introduced a series of changes in April 2012, which came into effect on June 30, 2012. As of June 30, 2012, IFHP divides asylum seekers into three categories with differing levels of health coverage depending upon the person's country of origin. There are now three baskets of services: (1) expanded health care coverage, (2) health care coverage, and (3) public health or public safety health care coverage. If the refugee claimant is from a designated country of origin, they will receive “very limited” health coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Canada, Citizenship and Immigration Canada, IFHP Info Sheet: http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/refugees/outside/ifhp-info-sheet.asp.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the provinces have stepped in to cover services and medication no longer provided under the IFHP.&lt;ref&gt;"Refugee Health-care Cuts by Ottawa before the Courts." CBC News: Politics [Toronto] 30 Jan. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Controversy====

=====Government Rationale=====

In defending the changes, the government explained its rationale as being to ensure equality between the health care received by refugees and that afforded to Canadians such that refugees would not receive superior benefits. Former Citizenship and Immigration Minister [[Jason Kenney]] emphasized the generosity of Canadians and Canada's immigration system, stating that the government did “not want to ask Canadians to pay for benefits for protected persons and refugee claimants that are more generous than what they are entitled to themselves.”&lt;ref name="cic.gc.ca"/&gt; In a related case, [[Nell Toussaint v. Attorney General of Canada]], the Supreme Court cautioned that by extending universal health care regardless of immigration status, Canada “could become a health-care safe haven”.&lt;ref&gt;Supreme Court of Canada, Judgements to be Rendered in Leave Applications, 2012: http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/news/en/item/3956/index.do.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government also made cost and deterrence arguments in favour of reforming the legislation.  These changes were estimated to save 100 million dollars over five years. The government argued that the cuts would deter claimants who are drawn to the country for its health care.&lt;ref name="cic.gc.ca"/&gt;

====Public Criticism====

Critics of the 2012 reforms include the [[Canadian Medical Association Journal]] and the [[Canadian Paediatric Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanbrook, Matthew. "Canada Owes Refugees Adequate Health Coverage." Canadian Medical Association Journal 10 (2014): 1; Samson, Lindy, and Charles Hui. Cuts to Refugee Health Program Put Children and Youth at Risk. Canadian Paediatric Association, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The heads of eight major professional associations including nurses, social workers, and physicians signed a letter opposing the cuts, demanding that pre-2012 refugee health provision be restored.&lt;ref&gt;Padmos, Andrew, Sandy Buchman, Jeff Poston, John Haggie, Robert Sutherland, Fred Phelps, and Lillian Linton. Letter to Hon. Jason Kenney. 18 May 2012. MS. Ottawa, Ontario&lt;/ref&gt; These advocates argue that the differential treatment of refugees and refugee applicants depending on their country of origin is discriminatory. Ontario's Health Minister [[Deb Matthews]] called for the changes to be reversed stating that “this policy change will create a class system for health care in Canada.”&lt;ref&gt;"Kenney Defends Cuts to Extended Health-care Benefits for Refugees." The Globe and Mail [Toronto] 29 June 2012: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/kenney-defends-cuts-to-extended-health-care-benefits-for-refugees/article4382382/.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IFHP Legal Challenge ===

====Constitutional Law Principle: Section 15 Equality Provision====

The [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] does not include any express protection of the right to health, but this right has been protected indirectly by Courts through the use of other provisions, such as the section 15 equality guarantee.&lt;ref name="Cousins, Mel 2009"&gt;Cousins, Mel. "Health Care and Human Rights after Auton and Chaoulli." McGill Law Journal 54.4 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Section 15(1) provides that “every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.”&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to The Canada Act 1982 (U.K.), 1982, c.11, art. 15(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

The current legal test for a section 15 equality analysis comes from Andrews as affirmed in [[R v Kapp]].  It requires that the court satisfy two conditions: (1)  the law creates a distinction based on an analogous or enumerated ground (2) the distinction creates a disadvantage by perpetuating prejudice or stereotyping.&lt;ref&gt;'R v Kapp', 2008 SCC 41, 2 SCR 483, para 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Nell Toussaint v. Attorney General=====

Prior to the 2012 reforms, in [[Nell Toussaint v Attorney General]], Toussaint challenged the constitutionality of the IFHP on the basis of the proposed analogous grounds of disability and citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;'Toussaint v Canada (Attorney General)', 2011 FCA 213, para 79.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court found neither of these grounds to be applicable to the claimant in question, but made a point of leaving open the question as to whether immigration status could be an analogous ground. If found to be an analogous ground, the applicant's exclusion from IFHP coverage could have been in violation of section 15(1) of the Charter.&lt;ref&gt;'Toussaint v Canada (Attorney General)', 2011 FCA 213, para 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian Civil Liberties Association]], in its intervenor factum, drew a comparison between [[immigration status]] and [[non-citizens]].&lt;ref&gt;Nell Toussaint v. Attorney General of Canada, Memorandum of fact and law of the intervenor, the Canadian CIvil Liberties Association, http://ccla.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Factum-Toussaint-v.-Attorney-General-of-Canada-November-2011-.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of cases have recognized that non-citizens, which capture many different types of immigration statuses, constitute an analogous ground under section 15(1). For example, in [[Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia]], the Court held that citizenship is an analogous ground since it was a personal characteristic “typically not within the control of the individual, and in this sense, is immutable.”&lt;ref&gt;'Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia', [1989] 1 SCR 143.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Lavoie v. Canada]], the Court held that “non-citizens suffer from political marginalization, stereotyping and historical disadvantage.”&lt;ref&gt;'Lavoie v. Canada', [2002] 1 S.C.R. 769, 2002 SCC 23&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Current Challenge Before the Courts=====

In December 2013, the Canadian Doctors for Refugee Care (CDRC) and the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers (CARL) brought a challenge to the [[Federal Court of Canada]] claiming that the government's cuts to refugee health care were unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;"Backgrounder: Legal Challenge to Cuts to Refugee Healthcare." Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, CARL proposes that both “country of origin” and “immigration status” are discriminatory grounds under section 15(1) of the Charter.&lt;ref&gt;Legal Challenges to Refugee Health Cuts Begin Today, Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers, 17 December 2013 http://www.carl-acaadr.ca/articles/61&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other Charter Issues====

The right to health has been litigated under Charter provisions outside of section 15.&lt;ref name="Cousins, Mel 2009"/&gt; The current CDRC/CARL challenge to the IFHP reforms is founded on two additional Charter provisions: (1) the right to life and security of the person under section 7; and (2)the right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual treatment under section 12.

== Quality of Healthcare ==

=== Women's Health ===
Recent studies have identified significant gaps in health care coverage for female refugees, particularly in the areas of pregnancy and mental health care. Specifically, barriers to health care access such financial difficulty have been shown to intersect with other post migration difficulties experienced by women with migrant status like downward social mobility, poor access to optimal nutrition, and limited social networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khanlou|first=N.|last2=Haque|first2=N.|last3=Skinner|first3=A.|last4=Mantini|first4=A.|last5=Landy|first5=C.

EBSCO''host'', doi:10.1080/15562948.2013.808390.&lt;/ref&gt;  Disparities have further been identified in the area of perinatal care, where uninsured migrant women are shown to receive less overall coverage than their insured counterparts, in addition to paying for diagnostic, physician, and hospital fees, leading to less than optimal outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson-Mitchell|first=Karline|last2=Rummens|first2=Joanna Anneke|date=2013-05-31|title=Perinatal Outcomes of Uninsured Immigrant, Refugee and Migrant Mothers and Newborns Living in Toronto, Canada|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/10/6/2198|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|language=en|volume=10|issue=6|pages=2198–2213|doi=10.3390/ijerph10062198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental health issues among female Syrian refugees have been examined, specifically instances of maternal depression.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahmed|first=Asma|last2=Bowen|first2=Angela|last3=Feng|first3=Cindy Xin|date=2017-07-24|title=Maternal depression in Syrian refugee women recently moved to Canada: a preliminary study|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-017-1433-2|journal=BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth|volume=17|pages=240|doi=10.1186/s12884-017-1433-2|issn=1471-2393}}&lt;/ref&gt; Causes for these mental health issues are varied and include lack of social support, in addition to cultural and socioeconomic factors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Further, migrant and refugee women are more likely to succumb to postpartum depression due to the additional stressors of the migratory experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O’Mahony|first=Joyce Maureen|last2=Donnelly|first2=Tam Truong|last3=Bouchal|first3=Shelley Raffin|last4=Este|first4=David|date=2013-04-01|title=Cultural Background and Socioeconomic Influence of Immigrant and Refugee Women Coping with Postpartum Depression|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10903-012-9663-x|journal=[[Journal of Immigrant and Minority Health]]|language=en|volume=15|issue=2|pages=300–314|doi=10.1007/s10903-012-9663-x|issn=1557-1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language Barriers ===
Access to health care for refugees and other migrant populations has been constrained by language barriers, among other cultural factors. A 2012 study showed that roughly sixty percent of government-assisted refugees had no English or French language skills, therefore acting as a deterrent to accessing proper health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arya|first=Neil|last2=McMurray|first2=Josephine|last3=Rashid|first3=Meb|date=2012-11-20|title=Enter at your own risk: government changes to comprehensive care for newly arrived Canadian refugees|url=http://www.cmaj.ca/content/184/17/1875|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|language=en|volume=184|issue=17|pages=1875–1876|doi=10.1503/cmaj.120938|issn=0820-3946|pmid=22927516|pmc=3503898}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns over privacy are also significant, as some women have expressed reluctance to using interpreters within the same, small ethnic community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, proper interpreter training may help bridge the gaps between patient and health practitioner, as is the case in British Columbia where the Provincial Health Services Authority trained thirty interpreters in anticipation of the arrival of 3,500 Syrian refugees in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Lake, Stephanie.

{{Seventh-day Adventism}}
'''Ruth Janetta Temple''' (1892–1984) was a leader in providing free and affordable healthcare and education to underserved communities in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. She and her husband, Otis Banks, established the Temple Health Institute in [[Eastside Los Angeles|East Los Angeles]], which became a model for community-based [[health clinic]]s across the country.&lt;ref name=LaTempa&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.libertyhill.org/2011/02/01/uplifting-change-summit|title=Uplifting Change Summit|date=2011-02-01|website=Liberty Hill Foundation|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Dr. Ruth Janetta Temple was born in [[Natchez, Mississippi]],&lt;ref name=Sentinel&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/1667159173|title = Affordable Health Care Realized In The 1900s|last = Carter|first = Brian|date = 19 Feb 2015|work = Los Angeles Sentinel|access-date = 30 June 2016|via =}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1892 to Amy Morton and Richard Jason Temple. Ruth was her parents' second-born child. Her siblings included Walter, Vivian, Richard, Ethel, and Lanier Temple. Two other siblings died at a young age.

Temple's parents stressed the importance of education and [[humanism]]. Her father, a [[Baptist]] minister and graduate of [[Denison University]], especially stressed the importance of looking beyond racial barriers and therefore made his home to be a place where people of all backgrounds could congregate. He even shared his personal collection of books written in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] with [[Judaism|Jewish]], [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] [[theologian]]s who needed them for research. Her father felt that, "People will come into our house. All people, all kinds of people, of all race all creeds, all colors, and all educational backgrounds. Our children will learn love before they learn hate." His perspective on race had a strong impact on Temple's life and made it easier for her to work in integrated spaces in her adult life. Temple's mother shared her husband's community spirit. She frequently invited people who were less fortunate into their home for food and clothing.

Two years after her father died in 1902, Ruth and her family moved to southeast Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="Sentinel" /&gt; Originally Amy Temple had homeschooled her children, but she had to go back to work as a [[Nursing|nurse]] to provide for her family. So Ruth had to act as a mother while she was gone. When Temple was 13, her oldest brother Walter, was experimenting with [[gunpowder]] outside. He put it into a hose and lit it, causing the gunpowder to blow up in his face. Ruth ran over to her brother who was lying on the ground, grabbed his head and turned it to her. Brushed the soot and powder off his face. She realized he hadn't done much damage, except from a singed eyebrow. After this she saw the possibility of helping others and taking pain away, from then on she wanted to be a [[physician]]. In another event Ruth was even more determined to be a physician. One day the Temple's neighbors son, Ernie Fennell, fell into an oil ditch in the area and was carried away for a quarter of a mile. When he was rescued he was covered with [[oil]] and wasn't breathing. Ruth knelt down and gave Ernie [[CPR]]. After a few moments he began coughing and breathing. One day Juliette Estelle Troy an [[African Americans|African American]] [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] witnessed to the Temple family. The Troy family and Temple family became the founding members of the Furlong Track Church, the first African American Seventh-day Adventist church in the West, founded in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;[https://spectrummagazine.org/article/2018/03/02/hidden-figures-black-adventist-women-who-made-difference-part-3 Hidden Figures: Black Adventist Women Who Made A Difference Part 3] Spectrum Magazine Retrieved November 2, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Temple enrolled in the College of Medical Evangelists ([[Loma Linda University]]) in 1913 and became the first [[African American]] woman to graduate from this institution.&lt;ref name="Sentinel" /&gt; Temple's family could not afford to fund her college education, but T.W. Troy, a prominent member of the Los Angeles Forum, a black men's civic organization, arranged for the group to pay Temple's tuition.&lt;ref name="Sentinel" /&gt; Troy continued to sponsor her education until she graduated with a bachelor's degree in medicine in 1918. She then interned in 1921 at the [[Los Angeles City Health Department]], where she specialized in [[obstetrics]] and [[gynecology]].&lt;ref name=Edmonds&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Black Women Oral History Project|last=Hill|first=Ruth Edmonds|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1991|isbn=311097391X|location=|pages=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; After over twenty years of service in the medical profession, Temple was accepted in the Public Health master's program at [[Yale University]] in 1941, and the Los Angeles City Health Department awarded her with a scholarship to support her advanced educational endeavors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moore|first1=Shirley Ann Wilson|title=Temple, Ruth Janetta (1892-1984)|url=http://www.blackpast.org/aaw/temple-ruth-janetta-1892-1984|accessdate=17 June 2015|work=The Black Past}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Upon graduation from Loma Linda, Ruth Temple began working to create public health services to underserved low-income communities in Los Angeles. She opened the first medical clinic in Southeast Los Angeles, a city of 250,000 people.&lt;ref name="Sentinel" /&gt; Funding for the clinic was scarce, so she and her husband Otis Banks turned their newly purchased five-bedroom bungalow into the Temple Health Institute.&lt;ref name="Sentinel" /&gt; The institute was a free medical clinic that discussed common community issues such as [[substance abuse]], [[immunization]], [[nutrition]] and [[sex education]].&lt;ref name="Sentinel" /&gt; Ruth found it important to educate adults and children; she wanted people to be self-sufficient, so that nothing would prevent them from getting the resources they need to maintain a healthy life. 

She developed, within the institute, community-based programs like the Total Health Program, the Health Study Center, and the Health Study Club.&lt;ref name="Edmonds" /&gt; These programs were designed to educate patients and other local residents about the resources available not only in her clinic, but also in the larger community.&lt;ref name="Edmonds" /&gt; These services were offered in schools, PTAs, YWCAs, churches, synagogues, service agencies, private medical practices, study clubs, block-to-block trainings, and local health information centers. Her program gained national attention with acronyms like ABC, which stands for "Acquiring basic health knowledge, Bringing into practice what is learned, and Communicating it to contacts". Even after her retirement in 1962 Temple continued to work in the public health service.

Temple was a member of the [[American Medical Association]], the Women's University Club, the [[California Medical Association]], the California Congress of Parents and Teachers, and [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]].&lt;ref name="Edmonds" /&gt;

==Legacy==

Ruth Janetta Temple died in 1984 at age 91.&lt;ref name="Edmonds" /&gt; A year prior to her death, the East Los Angeles Health Center was renamed the Dr. Ruth Temple Center in her honor.

'''Simultaneous nitrification–denitrification''' (SNdN) is a [[wastewater]] treatment process. [[Microbe|Microbial]] simultaneous [[nitrification]]-[[denitrification]] is the conversion of the [[ammonium ion]] to [[nitrogen]] gas in a single [[bioreactor]].  The process is dependent on floc characteristics, reaction kinetics, mass loading of readily biodegradable [[chemical oxygen demand]], rbCOD, and the dissolved [[oxygen]], DO, concentration&lt;ref name="Tchobanoglous, 2003"&gt;Tchobanoglous, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

== Microbiology ==

The [[oxidation]] of the ammonium to nitrogen gas has been achieved with attached growth and suspended growth wastewater treatment processes.  The most common bacteria responsible for the two step conversion are the [[autotrophic]] organisms, ''Nitrosomonas'' and ''Nitrobacter'', and many different heterotrophs.  The former obtain energy from the oxidation of [[ammonia]], obtain [[carbon]] from [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], and use [[oxygen]] as the [[electron acceptor]].  They are termed autotrophic because of their carbon source and termed aerobes because of their aerobic environment.  The heterotrophic organisms are responsible for denitrification or the reduction of [[nitrate]], NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, to nitrogen gas, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  They use carbon from complex organic compounds, prefer low to zero dissolved oxygen, and use nitrate as the electron acceptor.

== Systems Design ==

The most common design uses two different basins: one catering to the [[autotrophic]] bacteria and the second to the [[heterotrophic]] bacteria.  However, SNdN accommodates to both in one basin with strict control of DO.  This has been done in two common approaches.  One is to develop an oxygen [[Diffusion|gradient]] by adding oxygen in one location in the basin.  Near the O2 injection point, a high DO concentration is maintained allowing for nitrification and oxidation of other [[organic compound]]s.  Oxygen is the electron acceptor and is depleted.  The DO level in localized environments decreases with increasing distance from the injection point.  In these low DO locations, the heterotrophic bacteria complete the nitrogen removal.  The Orbal process is a technology in practice today using this method.  The other method is to produce an oxygen gradient within the bio floc.  The DO concentration remains high in the outside rings of the floc where nitrification occurs but low in the inner rings of the floc where denitrification occurs.  This method is dependent on the floc size and characteristics; however controlling flocs is not well understood and is an active field of study&lt;ref&gt;Nielson, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, SNdN has slower ammonia and nitrate utilization rates as compared to separate basin designs because only a fraction of the total biomass is participating in either the nitrification or the denitrification steps.  The SNdN limitation due to partial active biomass has led to research in novel bacteria and system designs.&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Huang achieved significant ammonia removal in an attached growth process with ciliated columns packed with granular [[sulfur]] where the denitrifying bacteria used the sulfur as the [[electron donor]] and nitrate as the electron acceptor.  Another well established pathway is via autotrophic denitrifying bacteria in the process termed the Anammox process.&lt;ref name="Tchobanoglous, 2003"/&gt; It is typically used for high ammonia strength wastewater.

]]
In modern [[medicine]], a '''surgeon''' is a [[physician]] who performs [[surgery|surgical operations]]. There are also surgeons in [[podiatry]], dentistry and the veterinary fields.

==History==
[[File:Albucasis.gif|thumb|[[Al-Zahrawi]], the [[Islamic Golden Age]] physician widely considered one of the '"[[Father of surgery|Fathers of Modern Surgery]]"]]
The first person to document a surgery was the 6th Century BC Indian physician-surgeon, [[Sushruta]]. He specialised in cosmetic plastic surgery and had documented even an operation of open [[rhinoplasty]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Ira D. Papel, John Frodel, ''Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery''&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] ''Suśruta-saṃhitā'' is one of the most important surviving ancient treatises on medicine and is considered a foundational text of Ayurveda and surgery. The treatise addresses all aspects of general medicine, but the translator G. D. Singhal dubbed Suśruta "the father of surgical intervention" on account of the extraordinarily accurate and detailed accounts of surgery to be found in the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Diagnostic considerations in ancient Indian surgery: (based on Nidāna-Sthāna of Suśruta Saṁhitā)|last = Singhal|first = G. D.|publisher = Singhal Publications|year = 1972|location = Varanasi}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the eventual decline of the Sushruta School of Medicine in India, surgery had been largely ignored until the [[Islamic Golden Age]] surgeon [[Al-Zahrawi]] (936-1013), reestablished surgery as an effective medical practice. He is considered the greatest medieval surgeon to have appeared from the Islamic World, and has been described as the [[father of surgery]].&lt;ref name=Ahmad&gt;{{citation|last=Ahmad|first=Z. ([[St Thomas' Hospital]])|title=Al-Zahrawi - The Father of Surgery|journal=ANZ Journal of Surgery|year=2007|volume=77|issue=Suppl. 1|doi=10.1111/j.1445-2197.2007.04130_8.x|pages=A83}}&lt;/ref&gt; His greatest contribution to medicine is the ''[[Al-Tasrif|Kitab al-Tasrif]]'', a thirty-volume encyclopedia of medical practices.&lt;ref name="al-ZahrāwīStudies1973"&gt;{{cite book|last1=al-Zahrāwī|first1=Abū al-Qāsim Khalaf ibn ʻAbbās|last2=Studies|first2=Gustave E. von Grunebaum Center for Near Eastern|title=Albucasis on surgery and instruments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mjVra87nRScC&amp;pg=PR8|accessdate=16 May 2011|year=1973|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-01532-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
He was the first physician to describe an [[ectopic pregnancy]], and the first physician to identify the hereditary nature of [[hæmophilia]].&lt;ref name="MedievalLife" /&gt; 

His pioneering contributions to the field of surgical procedures and instruments had an enormous impact on surgery but it was not until the eighteenth century that surgery as a distinct medical discipline emerged in England.&lt;ref name="MedievalLife"&gt;{{cite book | title=Handbook to Life in the Medieval World | first1=Madeleine Pelner | last1=Cosman | first2=Linda Gale | last2=Jones | publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]] | year=2008 |series=Handbook to Life Series |volume=2 | isbn=0-8160-4887-8 | pages=528–530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, surgery was mostly associated with barber-surgeons who also used their hair-cutting tools to undertake surgical procedures,{{cn|date=May 2018}} often at the battlefield and also for their employers. With advances in medicine and physiology, the professions of barbers and surgeons diverged; by the 19th century barber-surgeons had virtually disappeared, and surgeons were almost invariably qualified doctors who had specialized in surgery. [[Military surgeon|Surgeon]] continued, however, to be used as the title for military medical officers until the end of the 19th century, and the title of [[Surgeon General]] continues to exist for both senior military medical officers and senior government public health officers.

==Titles in the Commonwealth==
In 1950, the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]] (RCS) in [[London]] began to offer surgeons a formal status via RCS membership. The title ''Mister'' became a badge of honour, and today, in many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth countries]], a qualified doctor who, after at least four years' training, obtains a surgical qualification (formerly [[Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons|Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons]], but now also [[Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons|Member of the Royal College of Surgeons]] or a number of other diplomas) is given the honour of being allowed to revert to calling themselves [[Mr]], [[Miss]], [[Mrs]] or [[Ms.|Ms]] in the course of their professional practice, but this time the meaning is different. It is sometimes assumed that the change of title implies [[Consultant (medicine)|consultant]] status (and some mistakenly think non-surgical consultants are Mr too), but the length of postgraduate medical training outside North America is such that a qualified surgeon may be years away from obtaining such a post: many doctors previously obtained these qualifications in the senior house officer grade, and remained in that grade when they began sub-specialty training. The distinction of Mr (etc.) is also used by surgeons in the [[Republic of Ireland]], some states of [[Australia]], [[Barbados]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], [[Zimbabwe]], and some other Commonwealth countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rcseng.ac.uk/patients/the-surgical-team/qualifications-of-a-surgeon#three |title=Patients: The Surgical Team: Qualifications of a surgeon |publisher=[[Royal College of Surgeons of England]] |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military titles==
In many English-speaking countries the [[Military surgeon|''military'' title of surgeon]] is applied to any medical practitioner, due to the historical evolution of the term. The [[Medical Corps (United States Army)|US Army Medical Corps]] retains various surgeon [[United States military occupation code|MOS]]' in the ranks of [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] pay grades for military personnel dedicated to performing surgery on wounded soldiers.

Some physicians who are [[general practitioner]]s or specialists in [[family medicine]] or [[emergency medicine]] may perform limited ranges of minor, common, or emergency surgery. [[Anesthesia]] often accompanies surgery, and [[anesthesiologist]]s and [[nurse anesthetists]] may oversee this aspect of surgery. [[Surgeon's assistant]], [[Surgical nursing|surgical nurses]], [[surgical technologist]]s are trained professionals who support surgeons.

In the United States, the Department of Labor description of a surgeon is "a physician who treats diseases, injuries, and deformities by invasive, minimally-invasive, or non-invasive surgical methods, such as using instruments, appliances, or by manual manipulation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes291067.htm|title=Occupational Employment Statistic: Occupational Employment and Wages, May 2015: 29-1067 Surgeons|website=www.bls.gov|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trauma Systems Therapy (TST)''' is a [[mental health]] treatment model for children and adolescents who have been exposed to [[psychological trauma|trauma]]&lt;!--intentional link to disambiguation page--&gt;, defined as experiencing, witnessing, or confronting "an event or events that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others".&lt;ref name=DSM4&gt;
{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; TST focuses on the child's emotional and behavioral needs as well as the environments where the child lives (home, school, community). The treatment model includes four components (skill-based [[psychotherapy]], home and community based care, advocacy, and [[psychopharmacology]]) that are fully described in a published manual.&lt;ref name=Saxe2007&gt;

Trauma Systems Therapy treatment is not just for the victims. It also educates the victims significant others in order for them to support the victims in their recovery and help them control their emotions during future stressful events.&lt;ref name=TSTWeb&gt;{{cite web|last=TST Development Team|title=TST Basics|url=http://traumasystemstherapy.wordpress.com/tst-basics/|work=Trauma Systems Therapy: Transforming the lives of traumatized children|accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When referring to TST, therapists are looking at four categories: the reason a child may need TST, the signs and symptoms expressed by the child, the management and treatment methods and the results of children who have gone through TST. A look at what causes emotional trauma, the families involved, and how therapy can heal the child as well as the adult are also important factors.

==Reasons for Treatment==
Traumatic events that affect children are seen in households where sexual, mental, or physical abuse is present. The inability to regulate self-emotions either directly or indirectly is a clinical sign that a traumatic event has affected the child. According to child psychiatrist Dr. Glenn Saxe, “TST is a comprehensive model for treating traumatic stress in children and adolescents that adds to individually based approaches by specifically addressing the child’s social environment and/or systems of care”.&lt;ref name="saxe-blog"/&gt; This may include children or adolescents having social problems in school or in their home secondary to rape, physical abuse, neglect, death of a caregiver and/or any significant life altering emotion trauma. Sexual, physical, or mental traumatic events can affect present, past memory, and the anticipated future. Saxe’s theory in “The March of the Moments: Traumatic Stress in the Past, Present, and Future,” begins with “survival-in-the-moment” which causes severe emotions, unexplained personality changes, erratic behavior due to a sudden trigger that reminds the child of the event.&lt;ref name=Saxe2007/&gt;  Second, “Past memory” refers to “laying down of the present, conscious moments in the brain so that they can be accessible if we need them”.&lt;ref name=Saxe2007/&gt; This causes significant long-term trauma because if a child is not able to understand what has happened to him or her in the past, then he or she will go through life with a band-aid on this wound instead of healing mentally and physically. Finally, “marching into the future” refers to one of the most detrimental causes of traumatic stress, its effect on the child’s ability to think into the future. Saxe states, “If consciousness is about the present, and memory is about the past, then planning and anticipation are about the future”.&lt;ref name=Saxe2007/&gt;{{rp|40}} One’s ability to see into the future is part of the human cognition, when a child starts to “calculate survival-related risk”;&lt;ref name=Saxe2007/&gt;{{rp|40}} this causes significant stress by continuously reliving the trauma. When a child or adolescent plans their future around what might happen, this never allows the cause of the problem to be resolved, insuring they will never mentally or emotional heal. In addition to the black and white causes of Traumatic Stress, there are also secondary causes that are directly related to these events. So TST not only addresses the event at hand but also the associated problems that come along with it.

==Diagnosis/ Signs and Symptoms==
The treatment for TST is based on professional finding. PTSD is an umbrella diagnosis that includes many children and adolescents who show the basic problem of the inability to regulate their emotions.&lt;ref name=Saxe2007/&gt;{{rp|62}} When evaluating a child for TST, therapists look for awareness, affects, and actions when faced with a stressful event or unfamiliar situation.&lt;ref name=Saxe2007/&gt;{{rp|62}} Children who have been exposed to traumatic events show secondary symptoms such as the following: self modulation, self-destructive behavior, disassociation, feeling shameful, sadness, anger, hostility, social withdrawal, poor relationship skills, or changes in personality.&lt;ref name=Saxe2007/&gt;{{rp|63}} In many children, these symptoms can show up long after the event has occurred, during puberty or even the transition into adulthood.

There are three main groups used to categorize a child’s trauma, starting with Awareness (elements of attention, sense of self, orientation);&lt;ref name=Saxe2007/&gt;{{rp|65}} Affect (mood disorders, personality disorders); and Action (conduct disorders, personality, mood disorders, eating disorders, or substance abuse).&lt;ref name=Saxe2007/&gt;{{rp|65}} The disorders listed are usually first seen by family members, teachers, counselors, or other adults in the child’s life. Children who show signs of depression may also be affected by some sort of PTSD and would benefit from TST. Once children are clinically depressed, they tend to show changes in their thinking about themselves, their view of the world and how they see the future.&lt;ref name=Saxe2007/&gt;{{rp|61}} We see the signs and symptom associated with the event spill over into the home life, social life, academics and extracurricular activities. Unfortunately, children haven’t learned coping skills to deal with traumatic events. Instead, they act out or start the downward spiral to self-destruction. Understanding what to look for and recognizing this behavior in a child or adolescent is key to early detection and success.

==Management==
Management of such intense emotional stress has to include the child affected, as well as his or her social surroundings. TST treats the home and proved community based care, provides a service advocacy, helps with emotional regulation skills training and uses psychopharmacology to treat patients.&lt;ref name=saxe-blog&gt;{{cite web|last=Saxe|first=Glenn N.|title=TST Basics|url=http://traumasystemstherapy.wordpress.com/|publisher=Trauma Systems Blog|accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Knowledge of the child’s trauma, what stage he or she is at in the recovery phase, and willingness to seek treatment is all part of the healing process for the child and his or her family.

Therapy starts with the home environment. The caregiver has to understand the core problem by addressing if his or her child is sad a lot, destructive, or maybe the school keeps calling CPS (child protective services).&lt;ref name=Saxe2007/&gt;{{rp|158}} Understanding why the child is acting in such a manner is crucial in the healing process. Treatment for family, teachers and social workers is done so all the adults are on the same page with the problem at hand; they understand the course for treatment and can all be tools for the child to use during TST.  Next, everyone in the child’s life must become a service advocacy, which means holding “Family Collaborative Meetings”.&lt;ref name=Saxe2007/&gt;{{rp|156}} This offers education and information to the adults so they know what to expect from TST. Dedication from the adults to meet at the scheduled times, have adequate transportation to therapy, ability to overcome language barriers, and put their children’s needs before their own are all essential to success. Emotional regulation skills training is very important to therapy. The process starts with assessment, and then going through the course of treatment. Coping skills are stable and healthy ways to overcome stress and manage a child’s emotions and emotional identification, giving the child tools so he or she can better deal with the strategies, and communication about feelings, emotions, fears and concerns.&lt;ref name=Saxe2007/&gt;{{rp|225}} Finally, psychopharmacology is medication used to help a person’s emotional state. To reach the best therapeutic effect for a child, all of these concepts have to be integrated. The medication approach starts with SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors); these help with anxiety, depression and impulsivity.&lt;ref name=Saxe2007/&gt;{{rp|212}} The second-line medications are Benzodiazepines, Tricyclic antidepressants and Antipsychotic medication. These are very strong and are used as a last-ditch effort to prevent a child from having severe emotional problems. Occasionally, sleeping medication is prescribed but all are under careful supervision for harmful side effects. TST is an ongoing process that attempts to heal the child, not band-aid the problem; thus, medication is used sparingly and patients are weaned to lower therapeutic doses over time.&lt;ref name=Saxe2007/&gt;{{rp|214}}

==Results==
TST patients showed a much longer committed enrollment time versus the patient in basic therapy by almost 90%.&lt;ref name=Saxe2012&gt;
{{cite journal|last1=Saxe|first1=Glenn N.|last2=Heidi Ellis|first2=B.|last3=Fogler|first3=Jason|last4=Navalta|first4=Carryl P.|title=Innovations in Practice: Preliminary evidence for effective family engagement in treatment for child traumatic stress-trauma systems therapy approach to preventing dropout|journal=Child and Adolescent Mental Health|year=2012|volume=17|series=1|pages=59|doi=10.1111/j.1475-3588.2011.00626.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key to success is preventing dropout; this is a long process and significant evidence-based treatment needs at least eight sessions.&lt;ref name=Saxe2012/&gt; Children with emotional trauma tend to come from substance abuse families and lower income. This makes it hard for parents to be committed to TST, particularly if they struggle with addiction or abuse themselves. Children have shown significant progress just by the one-on-one attention during TST; a child’s social environment is crucial to his or her success in treatment.  Results vary in different social levels of the country, different families and what each child has experienced and its severity.
