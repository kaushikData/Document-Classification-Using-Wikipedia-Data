According to the [[Book of Mormon]], '''Aaron''' was a [[Lamanite]] [[king]] who lived during the 4th century in the [[Americas]].  He is mentioned in [[Book of Mormon (Mormon's record)|Mormon's record]] as a man who led 44,000 Lamanites to battle against [[Mormon (prophet)|Mormon]]'s [[Nephite]] army of 42,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Mormon|mormon|2|9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mormon's army prevailed in the battle, although ultimately the Nephite armies were conclusively defeated, which marked the end of their civilization.  Mormon described the armies of Aaron as exercising "awful brutality".&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Mormon|mormon|9|17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abdelaziz Ben Tifour''' ({{lang-ar|'''عبدالعزيز بن طيفور'''}}; {{birth date|1927|07|25|df=y}} – {{death date|1970|11|19|df=y}}) was a professional [[France|French]]-[[Algeria]]n [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Midfielder (association football)|midfielder]].

==Life and career==
He was a pioneer of Algerian football playing in Tunisia and France in the 40s and 50s as well as establishing the first Algerian national team with two other [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] activists featuring ten players in France’s provisional World Cup squad on the eve of the finals in Sweden.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} One of those players was Ben Tifour himself, who had played for the [[France national football team|French national team]] on four occasions including one appearance at the 1954 World Cup.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Born in [[Hussein Dey District|Hussein-Dey]]. In the summer of 1948, he moved to Europe to play for French first division club [[OGC Nice]], making his debut in a 1–1 draw with [[Red Star Paris]] and by the time Ben Tifour played at the [[1954 FIFA World Cup]] in Switzerland in a 3–2 win over [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]]; he had already won two league titles and a [[Coupe de France|French Cup]] with [[OGC Nice]]. He moved to [[Troyes AC]] after six seasons with Nice in 1954 and then signed for [[AS Monaco]] in 1956, which would be his last club in Europe. In total, he made 280 appearances in the [[Ligue 1|French top division]], scoring 62 goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{NFT player|id=29306|name=Abdelaziz Ben Tifour|accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to [[Tunis]] in 1958 to form the [[Algeria national football team|FLN Algerian national team]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

When Algeria was granted independence in 1962, the 33-year-old Ben Tifour unlike Mekloufi and [[Ahmed Oudjani]] who moved back to play in Europe, returned to his homeland to take up a player-coach role at [[USM Alger]] leading them to the first Algerian championship in 1963.

Ben Tifour died at the age of only 43 while he was coach at [[JS Kabylie]] during the 1970–1971 season.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

'''Agénor Étienne, comte de Gasparin''' (12 July 1810 - 4 May 1871) was a French [[politician|statesman]] and author. He was also an early [[Parapsychology|psychical researcher]] known for conducting experiments into [[table-tipping]].

==Biography==

He was born at [[Orange, Vaucluse]], the son of [[Adrien de Gasparin]]. In 1836 he entered the service of his father, then [[Minister of the Interior (France)|minister of the interior]], as chief of a department, became master of requests in the Council of State in 1837, and in 1842 was elected to the Chamber of Deputies from [[Bastia]] in [[Corsica]]. He was an advocate of religious liberty, prison reform, abolition of slavery, and the rights of the [[Protestant]] church, of which he was a member. His independence was not relished by the government, and his sympathy for Protestantism was not shared by his constituents. He was thus voted out of office in 1846, and put all of his enthusiasm into his written work.

When the [[French Revolution of 1848|revolution of 1848]] took place, he was asked to declare himself in favor of the new constitution. He refused. His disapproval of the form later given to the government by [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon]] was even stronger, and he permanently moved to [[Switzerland]].

From 1849 until his death, he lived at [[Geneva]]. In the winter, he delivered courses of lectures on economical, historical, and religious subjects, many of which were subsequently published. During the [[Franco-German War]] he addressed an appeal to the French people urging them not to persevere in it. His death was hastened by his exertions in the care of refugees from [[Charles Denis Bourbaki|Bourbaki]]'s army, whom he received into his house.

==Spiritualism==

In 1853, Gasparin with a group of his friends conducted experiments into [[table-tipping]] at his home. The experiments were conducted over a period of five months. He recorded the activity of table movements which he believed were the result of a physical force emanating from the bodies of the sitters. He
proposed a theory of fluidic action (termed "ectenic force"), which he believed could explain the phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Rodger. (2006). ''Psychics, Sensitives and Somnambules: A Biographical Dictionary with Bibliographies''. McFarland &amp; Company. pp. 68-69. {{ISBN|978-0786427703}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Marc Thury (1822-1905) from the [[University of Geneva]] who also attended some of the experiments supported Gasparin's conclusions in a pamphlet in 1855,&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Podmore|Podmore, Frank]]. (1897). [https://archive.org/stream/studiesinpsychic00podm#page/44/mode/2up ''Studies in Psychical Research'']. New York: Putnam. p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; and conducted some of his own experiments in which similar results were obtained.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hereward Carrington|Carrington, Hereward]]. (2007, originally published 1939). ''Laboratory Investigations into Psychic Phenomena''. Whitefish, MT: Kessinger Publishing. p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; The physicist and spiritualist [[William Crookes]] was influenced by Gasparin's experiments.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Crookes|Crookes, William]]. (1874). [https://archive.org/stream/researchesinphe00croo#page/26/mode/2up ''Researches in the Phenomena of Spiritualism'']. London: James Burns. pp. 26-27&lt;/ref&gt; The experiments were also endorsed by [[A. Campbell Holms]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A. Campbell Holms|Holms, A. Campbell]]. (1927). ''The Facts of Psychic Science and Philosophy''. Occult Press. pp. 276-277&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Camille Flammarion]] provided summaries of the work of de Gasparin and Thury.&lt;ref&gt;[[Camille Flammarion|Flammarion, Camille]]. (1907). ''[https://archive.org/stream/mysteriouspsychi002803mbp#page/n281/mode/2up Mysterious Psychic Forces]''. Small, Maynard And Company. pp. 229-288&lt;/ref&gt; Critics like [[Frank Podmore]] argued that the conditions were insufficient to prevent trickery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Podmore|Podmore, Frank]]. (1897). [https://archive.org/stream/studiesinpsychic00podm#page/47/mode/2up ''Studies in Psychical Research'']. New York: Putnam. p. 47 "If neither the feet nor the hands of the sitters could be employed, the knees could apparently have been used without much risk, and Thury clearly could not watch both the upper and under surfaces simultaneously. On the whole, though the experiments were conducted with care and a laudable desire not to exaggerate the importance of the facts observed, the experimenters do not appear to have sufficiently realised the possibilities of fraud; and their results add little evidence for action of a psychic, or, as Thury has preferred to name it, ectenic force."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Chisholm|Chisholm, Hugh]]. (1911). ''The Encyclopaedia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information, Volumes 25-26''. New York. p. 337. "It is doubtful from the description of the experiments whether the precautions taken were sufficient to exclude unconscious muscular action or even deliberate fraud."&lt;/ref&gt;

The table-tipping experiments were heavily criticized by [[Louis Figuier]]. He noted that Gasperin's claim of the movement of tables without material contact was a "physical impossibility" and that he was never able to reproduce the phenomena before the French [[scientific community]]. He stated that "to admit reality of the elevation of a table, without any contact, it would have to be reproduced several times, and at will, in experiences with other observers. This has never arrived; which leads one to conclude that any [[connivance]] slipped into the experiments."&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Figuier|Figuier, Louis]]. (1880). [https://archive.org/stream/b21498180_0002#page/579/mode/2up''Les Mystéres De La Science'']. Paris: Librairie Illustree. p. 579&lt;/ref&gt;

He himself was hit by five bullets, one of which is still embedded in his neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20070821-83752/Noynoy_Aquino_also_rises |title=Noynoy Aquino also rises |publisher=INQUIRER.net |date=August 21, 2007 |first=Dona |last=Pazzibugan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1993 to 1998, he worked for Central Azucarera de Tarlac, the sugar refinery in the Cojuangco-owned [[Hacienda Luisita]]. He was employed as the executive assistant for administration from 1993 to 1996 and subsequently worked as manager for field services from 1996 to 1998.&lt;ref name=whoisnoynoyaquino/&gt;

In 1998, he was elected to the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] as Representative of the 2nd district of [[Tarlac]] province. He was subsequently re-elected to the House in 2001 and 2004.&lt;ref name=r12 /&gt; In 2007, having been barred from running for re-election to the House due to [[term limits]], he was elected to the Senate in the [[14th Congress of the Philippines]].&lt;ref name=r12 /&gt;

==Congressional career==
Aquino is a fourth-generation politician: his great-grandfather, [[Servillano Aquino|Servillano "Mianong" Aquino]], served as a [[delegate]] to the [[Revolutionary Government of the Philippines|Malolos Congress]]; his paternal grandfather, [[Benigno Aquino, Sr.]], served as [[Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines]] from 1943 to 1944; his maternal grandfather, [[Jose Cojuangco]], was also a member of the House of Representatives; and his parents were [[Corazon Aquino]], who served as the 11th President of the Philippines (1986–92), and Senator [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.|Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino, Jr.]] Aquino is a member of the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]],&lt;ref name="marnoy2"&gt;[http://abs-cbnnews.com/nation/09/01/09/noynoy-poised-run-president 'Noynoy' poised to run for president]. ABS-CBN News. Retrieved on January 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; where he held various positions such as Secretary General and Vice President for [[Luzon]].

===House of Representatives (1998–2007)===
Aquino became [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives]] on November 8, 2004, but relinquished the post on February 21, 2006, when Aquino joined his [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] members in calling for the resignation of President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] at the height of the [[Hello Garci scandal]].&lt;ref name=r12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=resumeofsenatoraquino/&gt;

Aquino was also [[Chairman of the Board]] of the Central Luzon Congressional Caucus.&lt;ref name=resumeofsenatoraquino/&gt;

===Senate (2007–10)===
Barred from running for re-election to the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines]], to represent the [[Legislative districts of Tarlac|2nd district of Tarlac]], due to [[term limits]], Aquino was elected to the [[Senate of the Philippines]] in the [[Philippine general election, 2007|2007 Philippine midterm election]] on May 15, 2007, under the banner of the [[Genuine Opposition]] (GO), a coalition comprising a number of parties, including Aquino's own [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]], seeking to curb attempts by President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] to amend the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1986 Philippine Constitution]]. In Aquino's political ads, he was endorsed by his younger sister, TV host [[Kris Aquino]], and his mother, the late former President Corazon Aquino. Although a [[Roman Catholic]], Aquino was endorsed by the [[pentecostal]] [[Jesus Is Lord Church]], one of the largest [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/40912/news/nation/11-days-to-e-day-elections-for-sale |title=11 days to E-Day |publisher=GMANews.TV |date=May 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/40819/news/nation/jil-backs-loren-noynoy-koko-kiko-in-senate-race|title=JIL backs Loren, Noynoy, Koko, Kiko in Senate race |publisher=GMANews.TV |date=May 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=75867 |title=Brother Eddie Villanueva endorses 3 more GO bets |date=May 3, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926224349/http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=75867 |archivedate=September 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With more than {{Nowrap|14.3 million}} votes, Aquino's tally was the sixth highest of the 37 candidates for the 12 vacant seats elected from the nation at large. Aquino assumed his new office on June 30, 2007.&lt;ref name=r12 /&gt;

During the campaign, Aquino reached out to his former enemy, Senator [[Gregorio Honasan]], supporting his application for bail. Aquino told Job Tabada of Cebu Daily News, on March 5, 2007;

{{quote|"I endorse Honasan's request for bail ''para parehas ang laban'' [to even out the playing field]. I was hit by bullets from Honasan's men in the neck and hips but that's past now.

====Senate bills====
{{BLP sources section|date=April 2016}}
The Budget Impoundment and Control Act (SB 3121), wherein "impoundment" refers to the power of the president to refuse the release of funds appropriated by the [[Congress of the Philippines]], is another bill Aquino is proud of;&lt;ref name="lilanoy2"&gt;from an interview with freelance writer Lila Shahani for ''Philippines Graphic'', later posted on the writer's blog as [http://lilashahani.blogspot.com/2010/03/conversation-with-noynoy.html "A Conversation with Noynoy"] (March 2010){{Unreliable source?|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; he regretted,&lt;ref name="lilanoy2"/&gt; however, that such power has been used and abused by President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], a result of which abuse has been the significant emasculation of Congress' ability to check the president's authority. Aquino filed this bill so the president would have to pass through Congress every time the president decides to impound part of the budget.

Another significant Aquino contribution to the Philippines' corruption problem was Senate Bill 2035, which is the ''Preservation of Public Infrastructures'' bill, seeking to raise standards in the construction of all public infrastructures by penalizing contractors of defective infrastructures. The bill also requires the Bureau of Maintenance under the [[Department of Public Works and Highways]] to conduct periodic inspections of public infrastructures.

Aquino also pushed for the passage of the Amending the Government Procurement Act (SB 2160), which applies to all government procurement activities regardless of source of funds whether local or foreign; only treaties or international/executive agreements entered into by the government prior to its enactment shall be exempt from coverage. The bill was filed in light of the [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Department of Justice]] declaration regarding the validity of the controversial [[NBN-ZTE scandal]], wherein its international aspect, as well as the fact that it was an executive agreement, was cited as one reason for its exemption from the procurement process stipulated in Republic Act 9184.

Focusing further on accountability in government appropriations and spending, Aquino filed other reform-oriented bills, among which were [[Philippine National Police]] reform; an increase in penalties for corporations and work establishments not compliant with minimum wage; the banning of reappointment to the [[Judicial and Bar Council]]; the prevention of reappointment and bypassing of the [[Commission on Appointments]]; real property valuation based on international standards; and superior responsibility for senior military officers, who are ultimately responsible for their own subordinates. However, none of these bills were passed into law.

==Post-presidency==
Following the turnover ceremonies to his successor [[Rodrigo Duterte]] at Malacañang, Aquino returned to his parents' residence along Times Street, Quezon City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lopez|first1=Virgil|title=Warm welcome as Aquino returns to Times Street|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/571874/news/nation/warm-welcome-as-aquino-returns-to-times-street|accessdate=February 26, 2017|work=[[GMA News Online]]|date=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since leaving office, Aquino remained silent on the Duterte administration and rarely made public appearances. However, in November 2016, Aquino attended a concert at [[Rizal Park]] and joined protests against the [[burial of Ferdinand Marcos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Calica|first1=Aurea|title=Citizen Noy attends anti-Marcos rally|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/11/07/1641344/citizen-noy-attends-anti-marcos-rally|accessdate=February 26, 2017|work=[[The Philippine Star]]|date=November 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, Aquino commemorated the 31st anniversary of the [[People Power Revolution]] by marching to the [[People Power Monument]] and joining the protests against the [[History of the Philippines (1965–86)|Ferdinand Marcos regime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aquino joins People Power Monument protest, warns of history repeating|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/02/25/17/aquino-joins-people-power-monument-protest-warns-of-history-repeating|accessdate=February 26, 2017|work=[[ABS-CBNnews.com]]|date=February 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tupas|first1=Emmanuel|title=Noy joins EDSA rites, denies LP destab moves|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/02/26/1675893/noy-joins-edsa-rites-denies-lp-destab-moves|accessdate=February 26, 2017|work=[[The Philippine Star]]|date=February 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal charges==

In July 2017, criminal charges were filed against Aquino for usurpation of authority under the [[Revised Penal Code of the Philippines|Revised Penal Code]] and violating anti-graft and corruption laws. Ombudsman [[Conchita Carpio-Morales]] cited the involvement of then suspended [[Philippine National Police]] chief [[Alan Purisima]] in the [[Mamasapano clash|2015 Mamasapano police operation]] against the [[Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters]] and the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] in [[Mamasapano, Maguindanao]], where 44 [[Special Action Force]] members were killed. Under the Revised Penal Code, suspended public officials cannot perform their duties or interfere in government affairs. Aquino's former Deputy [[Presidential Communications Group (Philippines)#Presidential Spokesman|Presidential Spokesperson]] [[Abigail Valte]] said that Aquino plans to file a motion for reconsideration to appeal the charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Santos|first1=Eimor|title=Ex-President Aquino faces criminal raps over Mamasapano encounter, cleared of homicide|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2017/07/14/Noynoy-Aquino-Mamasapano-SAF-44-Ombudsman-criminal-charges-no-homicide.html|accessdate=July 16, 2017|publisher=[[CNN Philippines]]|date=July 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 Aquino was indicted in a $1.35 billion criminal case involving a congressional approval to use state funds on major government projects.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/06/20/asia-pacific/politics-diplomacy-asia-pacific/philippine-ex-leader-aquino-charged-1-35-billion-budget-case/#.W_qFu-uZ1E4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beny Jene Primm''' (May 21, 1928 - Oct 16, 2015), M.D., was a prominent American physician, HIV/AIDS researcher, lecturer and advocate for public health policy reform. 

Primm was born in [[Williamson, West Virginia]] and earned his Bachelor of Science from [[West Virginia State College]] in 1950, before moving to Europe to undertake graduate studies at the [[University of Heidelberg]] in Germany and the [[University of Geneva]] in Switzerland, earning his [[Doctor of Medicine]] from the latter in 1959.&lt;ref name="Dewart"&gt;Dewart p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1963, Primm began working as an anaesthesiologist at [[Harlem Hospital]], and during this time he began to specalise in drug addiction treatment and prevention.&lt;ref name="grimes"&gt;Grimes&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, he co-founded the Addiction Research and Treatment Corporation in New York, which opened six branches as well as a treatment centre in Brooklyn.&lt;ref name="grimes"/&gt; A major project of the A. R. T. C. was to determine the safety and effectiveness of [[methadone]] as a substitute for [[heroin]], to help addicts recover.&lt;ref name="roberts"&gt;Roberts p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; Primm combined this treatment with social and psychiatric services.&lt;ref name="netherland"&gt;Netherland p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 he founded the Urban Resource Institute, an organisation offering career counselling and human resources for drug addicts.&lt;ref name="riccucci"&gt;Riccucci p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; 

Primm was a leading figure in the fight against [[HIV/AIDS in the United States|HIV/AIDS]] during the 80s, and an early proponent of preventative measures such as clean needle programs, personal HIV/AIDS status testing and [[safe sex]].&lt;ref name="chambre"&gt;Chambré p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; From 1987, he served on the Presidential Commission on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic under [[Ronald Reagan]], where he personally added to the commission's 600-point plan of action a recommendation for treatment to be given on demand to intravenous drug users.&lt;ref name="grimes"/&gt;

Primm was later appointed to the National Drug Abuse Advisory Council, and headed the Office of Treatment Improvement, an agency of the government's Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Services Administration.&lt;ref name="iom"&gt;Institute of Medicine pp. 185-6&lt;/ref&gt; He also served on the [[Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS]]. 

Primm was not only an advocate for public health reform but also for civil rights and equality.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;Campbell and Ettorre p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the year before his death, he released his memoir, which he co-authored with John S. Friedman, entitled ''The Healer: A Doctor’s Crusade Against Addiction and AIDS''.&lt;ref name="grimes"/&gt;

He is best known for his qualitative analysis of specialization stratification in the underground economies related to [[computer crime]].

While at [[UCLA]], Abad discovered a method by which collisions in the [[hash function]] used in [[Internet Protocol]] datagrams may be leveraged to enable [[covert]] channel communications.&lt;ref name="hash_coll"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; His discovery was a centerpiece of covert communications methodology and was the primary citation for an [[Association for Computing Machinery]] paper on covert channel detection&lt;ref name="acm1"&gt;{{cite journal |citeseerx=10.1.1.84.6196 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and another on a similar technique using [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] [[timestamp]]s,&lt;ref name="acm2"&gt;{{cite journal |citeseerx=10.1.1.104.2501 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the two most well-cited and widely republished papers on the subject.

In 2005 while working at Cloudmark, Abad spent six months examining the phishing underworld from the inside.&lt;ref name="onlinewsj1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Phisher Tales: How Webs of Scammers Pull Off Internet Fraud |first=Lee |last=Gomes |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=2005-06-20 |url=https://www.wsj.com/public/article/SB111922540322063658-k2iziFe2OaO0z3gRtu_AvHbEtKk_20060620.html |accessdate=2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abad discovered that phishers were using [[IRC]] channels in order to trade personal information.&lt;ref name="infomationweek1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Researcher Describes How The Phishing Economy Works |first=Gregg |last=Keizer |newspaper=[[InformationWeek]] |date=2005-07-29 |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/security/vulnerabilities/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=166403892 |accessdate=2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stalked and collected messages from thirteen chat rooms phishers use.&lt;ref name="infomationweek1"/&gt; Whereas past phishing researchers believed that phishing was coordinated by highly organized criminals, Abad discovered that phishing rings were decentralized.&lt;ref name="infomationweek1"/&gt; Abad published his findings in [[First Monday (journal)|First Monday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=2005 |title=The economy of phishing: A survey of the operations of the phishing market |journal=[[First Monday (journal)|First Monday]] |publisher= |volume=10 |issue=9 |pages= |url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1272/1192 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This paper was the first examination of how the economy of [[phishing]] agents functioned, and highlighted the high degree of specialization within the economy.

As a broadcaster, Patrick was able to get attention through various stunts, such as painting himself blue in support for the [[Houston Oilers]] and wearing a large [[cowboy hat]].&lt;ref name=Jan2007TexasMonthlyArticle/&gt;&lt;ref name="RadioPowerful"/&gt; He became the second most popular TV personality in Houston by 1983,&lt;ref name=Jan2007TexasMonthlyArticle/&gt;&lt;ref name="RadioPowerful"/&gt; as well as one of the most well-known,&lt;ref name="AudienceOfOne"/&gt; though surveys also found that he was one of the most disliked.&lt;ref name="AudienceOfOne"/&gt; Patrick also had excellent public speaking skills, which caused him to be nicknamed "the Silver-tongued Devil."&lt;ref name=Jan2007TexasMonthlyArticle/&gt; Patrick left his job at KHOU in the mid-1980s after failing to reach an agreement with the station's new ownership for a long-term contract.&lt;ref name="AudienceOfOne"/&gt;

According to Patrick, as his surname from birth, ''Goeb'', was not pleasant-sounding or spelled as it sounded, he did not use it from his first day as a radio host.&lt;ref name="TheTruth"/&gt; Instead, he used the [[pseudonym]] ''Dan Scott''.&lt;ref name="TheTruth"/&gt; When Patrick became a television broadcaster in 1977, he changed his air name at the request of the person who hired him in order to avoid confusing Patrick with another anchor at a competitor station with the last name of Scott.&lt;ref name="TheTruth"/&gt; Patrick chose ''Dan Patrick'', with "Patrick" being his [[middle name]] of his wife's brother.&lt;ref name="TheTruth"/&gt; Patrick continued to use this name, and by the time he legally changed his name around 2004, he and his family were known as ''the Patricks''.&lt;ref name="TheTruth"/&gt;

===Sports bar chain and bankruptcy===
In November 1983,&lt;ref name="AudienceOfOne"/&gt; Patrick and several investors opened one of the first sports bars in the U.S., which they named Dan and Nick’s Sportsmarket.&lt;ref name=Jan2007TexasMonthlyArticle/&gt;&lt;ref name="RadioPowerful"/&gt; The bar did well for a time, due to "the strength of Patrick’s personality"&lt;ref name=Jan2007TexasMonthlyArticle/&gt; and an oil boom in Houston at the time, and they eventually took ownership of five sports bars in the city.&lt;ref name=Jan2007TexasMonthlyArticle/&gt;&lt;ref name="RadioPowerful"/&gt; Patrick's mother was the company bookkeeper. Questions later arose during the 2014 lieutenant governor's race about the [[immigration]] status of one of Patrick's employees, Miguel "Mike" Andrade. Patrick and Andrade offered different recollections about Andrade's employment. The matter was raised by one of Patrick's opponents, Jerry Patterson, who questioned Patrick's declared commitment to halt illegal immigration.&lt;ref&gt;"Patrick: No knowledge of worker's status", ''[[Laredo Morning Times]]'', February 20, 2014, p. 8A&lt;/ref&gt;

When the oil boom ended, Houston's economy fell, something which fatally hurt Patrick's sports bar chain.&lt;ref name=Jan2007TexasMonthlyArticle/&gt;&lt;ref name="RadioPowerful"/&gt; In 1986, after the sports bars failed, Patrick filed for [[personal bankruptcy]]. In October 1992, the case was closed, discharging several hundred thousand dollars in remaining debts.&lt;ref name="Dallas News"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20130919-dan-patrick-walked-away-from-large-business-debts.ece|title=Lieutenant governor candidate Dan Patrick knows struggles of going broke|publisher=Dallas News |date=September 19, 2013|accessdate=May 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick, who stated it took him 10 years for him and his family "to regain financial equilibrium," has frequently and openly discussed the ordeal and stated how it shaped him as an individual and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]].&lt;ref name="Dallas News"/&gt;

===Conservative talk radio host===
Soon after his bankruptcy, Patrick "reinvented himself."&lt;ref name="PartyCrasher"/&gt;  He became a [[conservative talk radio]] host in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Dallas News"/&gt; He began by buying a four-hour timeslot at [[AM 700]] [[KSEV]] (then called KTBT) in the summer of 1987.&lt;ref name="AudienceOfOne"/&gt; He originally was a [[sports radio]] host, operating out of his remaining sports bar.&lt;ref name=Jan2007TexasMonthlyArticle/&gt;&lt;ref name="RadioPowerful"/&gt; However, he was able to take over the radio station in 1988, and he switched to politics shortly afterward.&lt;ref name=Jan2007TexasMonthlyArticle/&gt;&lt;ref name="RadioPowerful"&gt;{{cite web | last1=Malewitz | first1=Jim | last2=Walters | first2=Edgar | title=Radio Made Dan Patrick Powerful in Texas.

The program, ''Dan Patrick &amp; Friends'', was broadcast in the Houston [[media market|radio market]] on KSEV and in [[Dallas]] on [[AM 1160]] [[KBDT|KVCE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kvceradio.com/host-bios/dan-patrick/ |title=Dan Patrick host bio |publisher=1160 KVCE AM Radio Dallas |accessdate=November 4, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111111700/http://www.kvceradio.com/host-bios/dan-patrick/ |archive-date= January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ksevradio.com/hosts/dan-patrick |title=Dan Patrick host information page |publisher=KSEV Radio – 700 AM |accessdate=November 4, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924111750/http://ksevradio.com/hosts/dan-patrick |archive-date= September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrick grew successful and influential through his talk radio career.&lt;ref name="PartyCrasher"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dallas News"/&gt; He earned high name recognition.&lt;ref name="PartyCrasher"/&gt; As a talk radio host, Patrick advocated for [[fiscal conservatism]], [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christian]] values [[Christian right|on social issues]], and he became a vocal opponent of [[illegal immigration]].&lt;ref name="PartyCrasher"/&gt; He was also known as a [[populist]].&lt;ref name="RadioPowerful"/&gt; Patrick's talk radio career was instrumental to his political rise, including his election and influence in the State Senate and his eventual election as lieutenant governor.&lt;ref name=Jan2007TexasMonthlyArticle/&gt;&lt;ref name="RadioPowerful"/&gt; One notable decision Patrick made as the owner of a talk radio station was to sign [[Rush Limbaugh]], who was not well known at the time, to be heard on KSEV in 1989, via [[radio syndication]].&lt;ref name="Dallas News"/&gt; Limbaugh's success as a national talk show host helped raise the popularity of Patrick's radio station.&lt;ref name="AudienceOfOne"/&gt;

By February 2006, Patrick already owned one radio station.&lt;ref name="PartyCrasher"/&gt; In 2006, Patrick signed a deal to purchase radio station KMGS AM 1160 in [[Highland Park, Texas|Highland Park]], Texas (now [[KBDT]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kristen |last=Mack |title=Alvarado looks in Dallas for Latino legal support |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/mack/3994763.html |publisher=Houston Chronicle |date=June 23, 2006 |accessdate=November 3, 2012}}{{better source|reason=Source is not clear.

===Other===
Patrick considered running for the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="TheTruth"/&gt; According to Patrick, while he was still considering a congressional run he changed his legal name to his air name of ''Dan Patrick'' as candidates could only list their legal name on the ballot rather than a [[pseudonym]].&lt;ref name="TheTruth"/&gt;

In November 2008, Patrick began work to produce ''The Heart of Texas'', a movie based on a real-life story of two families in [[Simonton, Texas|Simonton]], a small Houston-area city. The movie was released the next year on DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chron.com/life/hoffman/article/Hoffman-State-Sen-Dan-Patrick-Hollywood-is-1762900.php |title=State Sen.

Patrick proposed a [[boycott]] of [[Bill Maher]]'s television show ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' over controversial statements made by the comedian following the [[9/11]] terrorist attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Blogs/News?subject=oid%3A466283 "Beyond City Limits: Dan Patrick, Fairness Isn't Enough for Dan"], ''Austin Chronicle'', April 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick is also frequently at odds with the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' and announced a [[boycott]] of that newspaper in April 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahams, Tom. "Radio talk show host launches boycott against local newspaper", ''ABC-TV 13 Houston'', April 9, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; He owned a blog called ''Chronically Biased '', which criticized the newspaper.&lt;ref name=Jan2007TexasMonthlyArticle/&gt;

==Texas Senate==

===First term===
Patrick was first elected to [[Texas State Senate]]'s [[Texas Senate, District 7|seventh district]] in 2006, winning the [[primary election]] with 68.8% of the vote and the general election with 69.2% of the vote.&lt;ref name=TexasTribuneStats /&gt; His term began on January 9, 2007 with the convening of the [[Eightieth Texas Legislature]].

During his first month as a legislator, Patrick introduced Senate Bill 186.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlodocs/80R/billtext/html/SB00186I.htm |title=80(R) SB 186 – Introduced version – Bill Text |publisher=Capitol.state.tx.us |date=September 1, 2007 |accessdate=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If passed, it would have made abortion in Texas illegal should the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] overturn ''[[Roe v.

===Second term===
[[File:State Sen. Dan Patrick (8428437478).jpg|thumb|Patrick at a 2013 press conference on education]]
In the [[Texas elections, 2010|2010 general election]], Patrick was reelected with 86.4% of the vote.&lt;ref name=TexasTribuneStats /&gt; He also endorsed [[Rick Perry]] for re-election in the [[Texas gubernatorial election, 2010|2010 election]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.star-telegram.com/news/columnists/bud_kennedy/story/1506661.html]{{dead link|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after winning re-election, Patrick announced, and subsequently created, a [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] Caucus in the [[Texas state legislature]], which at its creation had 48 legislative members.&lt;ref&gt;Grissom, Brandi (December 16, 2010) – [http://www.texastribune.org/2010/12/16/sen-dan-patrick-announces-tea-party-caucus/ "Sen.

===2014 campaign===
{{See also|Texas elections, 2014#Lieutenant Governor}}
On June 26, 2013, Patrick announced he would challenge incumbent David Dewhurst in the Republican primary for lieutenant governor in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hamilton |first=Reeve |url=http://www.texastribune.org/2013/06/27/coming-out-swinging-dan-patrick-announces-lt-gov/ |title=Coming Out Swinging, Dan Patrick Announces for Lt.

In his race for lieutenant governor, Patrick was endorsed in July 2013 by [[Mike Huckabee]], the former [[governor of Arkansas]] who ran unsuccessfully for the [[U.S. presidential election, 2008|2008 Republican presidential nomination]]. In 2012, Huckabee had also endorsed David Dewhurst for the U.S. Senate nomination for the seat vacated by [[Kay Bailey Hutchison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.chron.com/texaspolitics/2013/07/patrick-touts-huckabee-endorsement/|title=Patrick touts Huckabee endorsement, July 23, 2013|publisher=blog.chron.com|accessdate=July 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victory went, however, to the Republican [[Ted Cruz]].

At a candidate forum in [[College Station, Texas|College Station]] in January 2014, Patrick said that he and two other challengers to Dewhurst, [[Jerry E. Patterson]] and [[Todd Staples]], could have sought re-election in their current positions as [[Texas General Land Office|Land Commissioner]] and [[Texas Commissioner of Agriculture]], respectively, but were instead "putting our positions on the line because we need new leadership. ... An energetic, passionate conservative to lead the Senate."&lt;ref name=incollegestation&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theeagle.com/news/local/article_eb860364-bdde-543d-9554-7f4622c89351.html|title=Beth Brown, "GOP lieutenant governor candidates reach out to Bryan-College Station voters," January 9, 2013|publisher=''[[Bryan-College Station Eagle]]''|accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the candidate forum, Patrick described education as a key issue in his campaign because of the 25 percent statewide high school drop-out rate, rising to 40 to 50 percent in the inner cities. He stated that "we do not have a future in the state of Texas if we have half of the next adult population – majority being Hispanic – don't have a high school degree."&lt;ref name=incollegestation/&gt; Patrick said that as lieutenant governor, he would work to secure the border with [[Mexico]] and to abolish [[sanctuary cities]] and in-state tuition for illegal immigrants. He also called for lowering [[property tax]]es.&lt;ref name=incollegestation/&gt;

Patrick led the four-candidate field in the primary with 550,769 votes (41.5%). Dewhurst followed with 376,196 (28.3%); Staples, with 235,981 (17.8%), and Patterson, 165,787 (12.5%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/mar04_169_state.htm?x=0&amp;y=218&amp;id=176 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140305180619/https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/mar04_169_state.htm?x=0&amp;y=218&amp;id=176 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 5, 2014 |title=Republican primary election returns, March 4, 2014 |publisher=enr.sos.state.tx.us |accessdate=March 5, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Election watchers did not expect Patrick to get first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Hooks | first1=Christopher | title=The Ascendancy of Dan Patrick | url=https://www.texasobserver.org/ascendancy-dan-patrick/ | date=March 5, 2014 | publisher=[[The Texas Observer]] | accessdate=September 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the runoff election on May 27, Patrick won with 487,829 votes (65.1%), defeating Dewhurst, who had 262,086 votes (34.9%).&lt;ref name="Fernandez2014"&gt;{{cite news | last1=Fernandez | first1=Manny | title=Lieutenant Governor Loses Texas Runoff as Tea Party Holds Sway | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/28/us/politics/tea-party-favorite-beats-lieutenant-governor-in-texas.html | date=May 27, 2014 | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | accessdate=January 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Stutz | first1=Terrence | last2=Garrett | first2=Robert T. | title=Dan Patrick Wins GOP Nomination for Texas Lieutenant Governor | url=https://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-politics/2014/05/27/dan-patrick-wins-gop-nomination-for-texas-lieutenant-governor | date=May 27, 2014 | publisher=''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' | accessdate=January 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick's victory was one of several notable primary victories by [[Tea Party movement]]-aligned Republicans in the election runoff.&lt;ref name="Fernandez2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Grissom | first1=Brandi | title=Tea Party Conservatives Win Top GOP Runoffs | url=https://www.texastribune.org/2014/05/28/tea-party-conservatives-win-top-gop-runoff-contest/ | date=May 28, 2014 | publisher=''[[The Texas Tribune]]'' | accessdate=January 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ross Ramsey of ''[[The Texas Tribune]]'', Patrick did not shift to the political middle as the general election approached, contrary to what political candidates typically do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Ramsey | first1=Ross | title=Analysis: Who’s the Establishment, Anyway? | url=https://www.texastribune.org/2018/01/10/analysis-whos-establishment-anyway/ | date=January 10, 2018 | publisher=''[[The Texas Tribune]]'' | accessdate=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 4, 2014, Patrick won the general election against his state Senate colleague, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Leticia Van de Putte]] of [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], to become the lieutenant governor-elect of Texas.&lt;ref name=geresults/&gt; He was swept into office in a Republican landslide that saw the party retain all statewide elected offices for the fifth consecutive election.

On May 13, 2016, Patrick criticized the [[Obama administration]], after it released a directive stating that all public schools must allow transgender students to use the bathroom and locker facilities that correspond with their identified gender, stating that, on the prospect of the federal government withholding funding for Texas schools for not following the directive, "he can keep his 30 pieces of silver [and that w]e will not yield to blackmail from the president of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Gass | first1=Nick | title=Texas Lt.

Patrick supported and strongly advocated for a [[bathroom bill]] proposed on January 5, 2017 by Senator [[Lois Kolkhorst]] of [[Brenham, Texas|Brenham]].&lt;ref name="ToughFight"/&gt;

Patrick made legislation prohibiting state or local governments from issuing subpoenas on pastors' sermons a priority in the 2017 session.&lt;ref name="SvitekSubpoenas"/&gt; Governor Abbott signed the bill into law on May 21, 2017.&lt;ref name="SvitekSubpoenas"&gt;{{cite web | last1=Svitek | first1=Patrick | title=Abbott Signs Bill Protecting Sermons from Subpoenas | url=https://www.texastribune.org/2017/05/21/abbott-signs-bill-protecting-sermons-subpoenas/ | date=May 21, 2017 | publisher=''[[The Texas Tribune]]'' | accessdate=May 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political positions==

===Abortion===
Patrick opposes [[abortion]] and supported Texas' "Mandatory Ultrasound Bill", a bill signed into law in May 2011 by Governor Perry, which requires women seeking abortion to have a [[Medical ultrasonography|sonogram]] of the [[fetus]] taken at least twenty-four hours before the abortion is performed.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Patrick opposes abortion in cases of incest and rape. In January 2014, when he was asked about exceptions to outlawing abortion, Patrick said, "The only exception would be if the life of the mother was truly in danger…but that is rare."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/local/herman-abortion-exceptionalism-in-the-gop-lite-guv/ndC75/#e5ff2779.3657224.735464|title=Herman: Abortion exceptionalism in the GOP lite guv primary|publisher=Mystatesman.com|accessdate=January 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Patrick supports increasing the number of [[charter schools]] in the state.&lt;ref name=Nov2010PressRelease /&gt;

In February 2011, Patrick, who at the time was vice chairman of the Texas senate's [[Texas Senate#Committee Structure|Committee on Education]], spoke in favor of cutting an unspecified number of non-teaching positions from the state's public school districts, citing positions such as "math department supervisors" or "curriculum experts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.texastribune.org/texas-education/public-education/do-texas-schools-spend-too-much-on-administration/ |title=Do Texas Schools Spend Too Much on Administration? |publisher=The Texas Tribune |date=February 25, 2011 |first=Morgan |last=Smith |accessdate=November 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.senate.state.tx.us/75r/senate/commit/c530/c530_81.htm |title=Committee Information for 81st Session's Senate Committee on Education |publisher=Texas State Senate |accessdate=November 4, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026014521/http://www.senate.state.tx.us/75r/senate/commit/c530/c530_81.htm |archivedate=October 26, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, Patrick cited a statistic later determined to be misleading by PolitiFact.com that Texas's 1,200+ public school districts, considered as a group, are the fifth-largest employer in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2011/mar/11/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-says-texas-school-districts-all-told-a/ |title=Mostly False: Dan Patrick Says Texas school districts are the fifth largest employers in the world. |publisher=PolitiFact.com |accessdate=November 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrick is on record as determined to establish [[creationism]] within the public school curriculum in Texas, despite court rulings that such a policy would violate the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/01/29/creationism_and_texas_once_more_into_the_breach_of_education.html?wpisrc=burger_bar|title=Creationism and Texas: Once more into the breach of education.|work=Slate Magazine|accessdate=January 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fiscal conservatism===
Patrick identifies the experience of his personal bankruptcy as having shaped his conservatism in fiscal policy.&lt;ref name="Dallas News"/&gt; Patrick joined with restaurateur Edd Hendee and [[Paul Bettencourt]], the former Harris County tax assessor-collector and Patrick's successor in the state Senate, both on-air hosts on Patrick's station, to form ''Citizens Lowering Our Unfair Taxes'' (CLOUT), a political organization that was originally formed to push for lower property taxes in Texas.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===Illegal immigration===
Patrick opposes [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigration]]. As a talk radio host, he reserved some of his "most hard-edged oratory for illegal immigrants."&lt;ref name="PartyCrasher"/&gt; Patrick expressed support for [[Arizona SB 1070|Arizona’s SB 1070 immigration enforcement law]], and supports passing a similar law in Texas that would allow local law enforcement to ask lawfully-stopped individuals about their immigration status and would make it a state misdemeanor to be present in Texas as an illegal immigrant.&lt;ref name=Nov2010PressRelease&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senate.state.tx.us/75r/senate/members/dist7/pr10/p110810a.htm |title=Press Release from the Office of State Senator Dan Patrick: Senator Dan Patrick Files Conservative Agenda |publisher=Texas State Senate |date=November 8, 2010 |accessdate=November 4, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112152211/http://www.senate.state.tx.us/75r/senate/members/dist7/pr10/p110810a.htm |archivedate=January 12, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Same-sex marriage and LGBT issues===
On February 26, 2014, following a federal court ruling the Texas ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional, Patrick asserted his position that marriage is a union between one man and one woman. He then further stated his intentions to fight such decisions should he be elected to the Lt. Governor's office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/DanPatrick/status/438782159138979840 |title=Twitter / DanPatrick: I want to re-emphasize my long |publisher=Twitter.com |date=February 26, 2014 |accessdate=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/DanPatrick/status/438761650137493504 |title=Twitter / DanPatrick: As Lieutenant Governor I'll |publisher=Twitter.com |date=February 26, 2014 |accessdate=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hours after the [[2016 Orlando nightclub shooting]], Patrick tweeted a picture of the Bible verse, "Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. Galatians 6:7." An adviser released a statement that the tweet had been pre-scheduled, and the tweet was later deleted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Hamilton | first1=Jessica | title=Texas Lt. Gov.

His word is never wrong ... I took it down to stop the hateful comments and the misinformation being spread of God’s message to all of us- straight or gay."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Patrick | first1=Dan | title=My Facebook Statement Regarding This Morning’s Bible Verse Post | url=http://danpatrick.org/facebook-statement-regarding-mornings-bible-verse-post/ | publisher=''danpatrick.org'' | accessdate=December 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrick encouraged state Senator [[Lois Kolkhorst]] of [[Brenham, Texas|Brenham]] to introduce a [[bathroom bill]] similar to a [[Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act|previous law adopted in 2016]] in [[North Carolina]], and strongly pushed for it at its proposal on January 5, 2017.&lt;ref name="ToughFight"&gt;{{cite web | last1=Svitek | first1=Patrick | title=With Bathroom Bill, Texas Lt.

====Domestic partner benefits====
In November 2012, Patrick asked [[Texas Attorney General|Texas attorney general]] [[Greg Abbott]]'s office to issue an opinion on the constitutionality of government entities providing domestic partner insurance benefits. An [[Texas Proposition 2 (2005)|amendment to the Texas Constitution]] in 2005 limits marriage to heterosexual relationships and prohibits similar, alternative legal arrangements. Patrick did not disclose his own views on [[same-sex marriage]] or [[civil union]]s for same-sex couples. He told the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' that his request was prompted by [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County's]] November 2012 decision and an [[Pflugerville Independent School District|Austin-area public school district's]] October 2012 decision to join other Texas cities and counties in extending benefits to their unmarried employees' heterosexual or homosexual partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Patrick-questions-legality-of-domestic-4004790.php |last=Hassan |first=Anita |date=November 2, 2012 |accessdate=November 4, 2012 |title=Sen. Patrick questions legality of domestic partnership benefits |work=Houston Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statutory rape laws===
Patrick was interviewed extensively on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[20/20 (US television series)|20/20]]'' segment "The Age of Consent: When Young Love Is a Sex Crime," defending his position favoring very tough Texas [[statutory rape]] laws. "While it seems unfair, he was 19, she was 15," says Patrick, "That's the price you pay. Even if you end up getting married."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Stossel |author2=Gena Binkley |author3=Andrew G.

===Confederate monuments===
Patrick is a strong supporter of maintaining [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] monuments on public display, despite opposition from civil rights groups who consider the statues as a defense of the institution of [[slavery]]. As one of six members of the board that oversees the [[Texas State Capitol]] grounds, Patrick described the need: "to learn from history all of our history, including events and times that many would like to forget. ... Our goal should be to have a meaningful dialogue for future generations so those moments in our history are not repeated."&lt;ref&gt;Allie Morris, "Austin has a monumental problem: Confederate icons have backing at the Capitol," ''San Antonio Express-News,''  August 17, 2017, pp. 1, A6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presidential politics===
{{See also|United States presidential election in Texas, 2016}}

{{for|the 2004 film|Deed Poll (film)}}
A '''deed poll''' (plural: '''deeds poll''') is a [[Law|legal]] document binding only to a single person or several persons acting jointly to express an active intention. It is, strictly speaking, not a [[contract]] because it binds only one [[party (law)|party]] and expresses an intention instead of a promise.

==Use for changing name==
{{main|Deed of change of name}}
The most common use is a [[name change]] through a [[deed of change of name]] {{fact|date=July 2014}} (often referred to simply as a ''deed poll''). Deeds poll are used for this purpose in countries including the [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]]. In the UK, a deed poll can also be used to change a child's name, as long as everyone with parental responsibility for the child consents to it and the child does not object to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Changing your name|url=http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/england/relationships_e/relationships_birth_certificates_and_changing_your_name_e/changing_your_name.htm|website=AdviceGuide UK|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The child's parents execute the deed poll on the child's behalf. In some other jurisdictions, a person may simply start using a new name without any formal legal process. The usual requirements are that the new name must be used exclusively and that the change must not be made with intent to [[fraud|defraud]]. In [[Australia]], prior to 1 November 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.justice.tas.gov.au/bdm/changeofname/deed_poll_searches_(pre-2000)|title=Births Deaths and Marriages : Deed poll searches (pre-2000)|website=www.justice.tas.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;, name change was formerly accomplished by deed poll but now is done by completing a Change of Name form.

The UK Government provides a free web-based service to advise individuals on changing name using a deed poll. Several websites have been established that charge for this service, some of which appear to be from government agencies. However, these have no official status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ferguson|first1=Donna|title=Deed poll websites to avoid|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/jun/29/deed-poll-websites-avoid|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=29 June 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
Another common use is to [[Partition (law)|partition]] land into different sections. For example, a piece of land may be partitioned (or carved out) by a deed poll into Section A and the Remaining Portion thereof. This form of deed poll is commonly used in [[Hong Kong]].

A deed poll may also be used (in England and Wales) for clergy of the Church of England to relinquish their [[holy orders]].

==Origin of the term==
The term "deed", also known in this context as a "specialty", is common to signed written undertakings not supported by consideration: the seal (even if not a literal wax seal but only a notional one referred to by the execution formula, "signed, sealed and delivered", or even merely "executed as a deed") is deemed to be the consideration necessary to support the obligation. "Poll" is an [[Archaism|archaic]] legal term referring to documents with straight edges; these distinguished a deed binding only one person from one affecting more than a single person (an "[[indenture]]", so named during the time when such agreements would be written out repeatedly on a single sheet, then the copies separated by being irregularly torn or cut, i.e. "indented", so that each party had a document with corresponding tears, to discourage [[forgery]]).

'''Edward Trusted Bennett''' (July 1, 1831 - November 16, 1908), best known as '''Edward T. Bennett''' was a British [[botanist]] and [[Parapsychology|psychical researcher]].

==Biography==

Bennett was born in [[London]]. His younger brother was the botanist [[Alfred William Bennett]]. As a young man he collected plant specimens in [[Cornwall]] and the [[New Forest]].&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous. (1909).

''Dictionary of British and Irish Botanists and Horticulturists''. Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd. p. 65. {{ISBN|0-85066-843-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett was the last [[Quakers|Quaker]] in Britain to be disowned for holding different theological opinions. In 1873, he was disowned for supporting the heretical views of [[Charles Voysey (theist)|Charles Voysey]].&lt;ref&gt;Helmstadter, Richard J. (1997). ''Freedom and Religion in the Nineteenth Century''. Stanford University Press. p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Thomas C. (2001). ''British Quakerism, 1860-1920: The Transformation of a Religious Community''. Oxford University Press. p. 81. {{ISBN|0-19-827035-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17891">'''Geoffrey of Vinsauf''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1200) is a representative of the early medieval grammarian movement, termed ''preceptive grammar'' by [[James J. Murphy]] for its interest in teaching ''[[ars poetria]]'' (1971, vii ff.).

''Ars poetria'' is a subdivision of the grammatical art (''[[ars grammatica]]'') which synthesizes "rhetorical" and "grammatical" elements. The line of demarcation between these two fields is not firmly established in the [[Middle Ages]]. Gallo explains that "both of these [[liberal arts]] taught composition and taught the student to examine the [[diction]], [[figurative language]], and meters of the curriculum authors who were to serve as models for imitation. However it was [[rhetoric]] and not grammar that was concerned with [[Inventio]]n of subject matter and with [[dispositio]]n or organization of the work" as well as [[Memoria|memory]] and [[Pronuntiatio|delivery]] (72).

Murphy explains that the medieval ''artes poetriae'' are divided into two types. First, there is the short, specialized type of treatise dealing with ''[[Figure of speech|figurae]]'', ''colores'', ''[[Trope (linguistics)#Literary usage|tropi]]'', and other verbal ornaments. They appeared separately all over Europe, usually anonymous, and were incorporated in elementary schooling, as adjuncts to ordinary grammar instruction. The second type of ''ars poetriae'' includes such works as the ''Ars versificatoria'' (c. 1175) of [[Matthew of Vendôme]], the ''Laborintus'' (after 1213, before 1280) of [[Eberhard the German]], the ''Ars versificaria'' (c. 1215) of [[Gervase of Melkley]], the ''Poetria nova'' (1208–1213) and the ''Documentum de modo et arte dictandi et versificandi'' (after 1213) of Geoffrey of Vinsauf, and the ''De arte prosayca, metrica, et rithmica'' (after 1229) of [[John of Garland]] (1971, xxi-xxii). The ''artes poetriae'' constituted poetry as an academic discipline, and promoted its participation in the methods of [[logic]] (Copeland).

==Biography==
We know very little about the life of Geoffrey of Vinsauf. From his ''Poetria nova'' we learn that he was at one time in England before going to Rome during the pontificate of [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]], to whom the ''Poetria nova'' was prepared as a special gift. The traditional account of Geoffrey of Vinsauf provides further details of his biography: he is believed to be born in Normandy, but initially educated at [[St. Frideswide, Oxford]]. He is said to have returned to the Continent for further university study, first in Paris and later in Italy. He incurred the displeasure of Bishop Adam, allegedly after a quarrel in Paris with a certain Robert, once his friend, and was forced to appeal to the mercy of the Archbishop of Canterbury. Later, perhaps through the intercession of that prelate, he journeyed back to England to become tutor at Hampton. At a still later date he is said to have been sent on an embassy to Innocent III, and thus to have developed relations with the Holy See. His designation as "Vinsauf", or "de Vino Salvo", is traceable to a treatise attributed to him on the keeping of the vine and other plants (Murphy 29-30).

==Works and Bibliography==
The ''Poetria nova'' is a 2,000-line poem written around 1210 in Latin [[hexameter]]s and dedicated to [[Pope Innocent III]]. The ''Poetria nova'' aimed to replace the standard text on verse composition, [[Horace]]'s ''[[Ars poetica]]'' called the ''Poetria'' in the [[Middle Ages]], which was widely read and commented upon in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Karsten Friis-Jensen suggests that Geoffrey of Vinsauf's "main incentive for writing independent arts of poetry was probably a wish to systematize the exegetical material which generations of [[Commentary (philology)|commentators]] had collected around Horace's text, in a structure that was in better accordance with traditional didactics in the closely related art of [[rhetoric]]" (364). The medieval teacher intended to reshape the ''[[Ars poetica]]'' into an elementary textbook on composing poetry, "modeled on the [[Cicero|Ciceronian rhetorics]] and their medieval derivatives, such as the ''artes dictandi'' and the treatises on the ''colores rhetorici''" (Camargo 949). The ''Poetria nova'' almost immediately became one of the standard textbooks in England and was incorporated into the curriculum on the Continent very soon thereafter. To its popularity testifies the number of manuscripts (200) in which this work is found and extensive commentary, which takes form of marginal [[Gloss (margin text)|gloss]]es around a text of the ''Poetria nova'' and a text copied separately by itself.

''Documentum de modo et arte dictandi et versificandi'' (Instruction in the Method and Art of Speaking and Versifying) written after 1213 is a prose counterpart of the ''Poetria nova'' which expands on amplification, abbreviation, and verbal ornamentation. It is preserved complete in three manuscripts and nearly complete in another two manuscripts. The thirteenth-century copies explicitly attribute the treatise to "magistri Galfridi" or "magistri Galfridi le Vin est sauf". Two other works are attributed to him: ''Summa de Coloribus Rhetoricis (A Summary of the Colors of Rhetoric)'', a briefer work, primarily on figures of speech, and the "Causa Magistri Gaufredi Vinesauf" ("The Apology of Master Geoffrey of Vinsauf"), a short poem of topical and political interest. He used to be regarded as the author of ''[[Itinerarium Regis Ricardi]]'', a narrative of the [[Third Crusade]], but this is certainly false.

The texts of the ''Poetria nova, Documentum de modo et arte dictandi et versificandi'', and ''Summa de coloribus rhetoricis'' are included in [[Edmond Faral]], ''Les arts poétiques du XIIe et du XIIIe siècle'' (Paris, 1924; reprinted Paris, 1958), pages 197-262, 265-320, and 321-327 respectively. The ''Poetria nova'' has been translated into English three times: by Margaret F. Nims, ''Poetria nova'' (Toronto, 1967), by Ernest Gallo, ''The Poetria nova and its Sources in Early Rhetorical Doctrine'' (The Hague, 1971), and by Jane Baltzell Kopp, ''Poetria nova'', in ''Three Medieval Rhetorical Arts'', ed. James J. Murphy (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1971), pp.&amp;nbsp;32–108. ''Documentum de modo et arte dictandi et versificandi'' is translated by Roger Parr, ''Instruction in the Method and Art of Speaking and Versifying'' (Milwaukee, 1968). In this article, quotations are from Kopp's translation.

==The ''Poetria nova''==
The ''Poetria nova'' is a preceptive treatise, that is, it gives a specific advice to future writers about the composition of poetry. Its handbook genre is reinforced by multiple illustrations of its precepts entirely invented by Geoffrey of Vinsauf, rather than culled from classical authors. The text itself serves as an illustration of techniques it teaches. Thus, the treatment of amplification is amplified, the treatment of abbreviation is abbreviated, [[metaphor]] is discussed in [[figurative language]]. As Woods notes, the applicability of the instructions of ''Poetria nova'' to both verse and prose and the various ways it could be used in the classroom, combined with the range of styles that Geoffrey of Vinsauf used to illustrate techniques, made it the general all-purpose medieval rhetorical treatise ''par excellence'' (1).

A thirteenth century anonymous commentary on the ''Poetria nova'' notes the twofold nature of this book: first, the five parts of the book are the five parts of [[rhetoric]]: [[Inventio]]n, [[dispositio]]n, [[Elocutio|style]], memory, and [[Pronuntiatio|delivery]]; second, the ''Poetria nova'' is itself a rhetorical discourse with the necessary parts: ''[[Exordium (rhetoric)|exordium]]'', ''narratio, divisio, confutatio'', and ''conclusio''. Its author is, consequently, an accomplished theoretician, orator, and "a good teacher" (Woods 668-9).

The ''Poetria nova'' incorporates Ciceronian precept on [[invention]] and arrangement, Horatian doctrine on decorum, and instructions on style including the tropes, [[Figure of speech|figures of words]] and figures of thought derived from the [[Rhetorica ad Herennium|pseudo-Ciceronian ''Rhetorica ad Herennium'']]. Gallo summarizes the major topics of the ''Poetria nova'' as follows (numbers in parentheses refer to line numbers of the original Latin verse) (69):
{|

|-
|I. || Introduction; Divisions of the art of rhetoric (verses 1-86).

[[Figurative language]] is discussed in detail in the ''Poetria nova'', which marks this treatise as grammatical. However, two of the central parts of the ''Poetria nova'' - [[Inventio]]n of subject matter and [[dispositio]]n or organization of the work - belong to the domain of [[rhetoric]]. Likewise, [[Memoria|memory]] and [[Pronuntiatio|delivery]] are traditionally affiliated with [[rhetoric]]. The ''Poetria nova'' thus constitutes an intersection of grammar and [[rhetoric]] in the medieval curriculum.

The ''Poetria nova'' opens with a famous passage about planning a poem and defining the limits of its subject matter. Geoffrey of Vinsauf distinguishes between the natural order and the artificial or artistic order in which the author can narrate the events.Geoffrey of Vinsauf prefers the artificial order and recommends a proverbial opening.

The subject matter can be presented either through a lengthy treatment or a brief recapitulation of the story. Among the methods of amplification are refining or dwelling on a point; [[periphrasis]]; comparison; [[Apostrophe (figure of speech)|apostrophe]]; [[prosopopeia]]; [[digression]]; description; and opposition. Brevity of the narration can be achieved by the following devices: emphasis, articulus, [[absolute ablative]] "without a rower" [i.e. a preposition], skillful indication of one thing among the rest, "chains removed from between clauses" [i.e. omitting conjunctions], the sense of many clauses in one, and omitting repetition of the same word.

Geoffrey of Vinsauf distinguishes between ''ornatus gravis'' ['difficult/serious/dignified ornament'] and ''ornatus levis'' ['easy/pleasant/light ornament']. ''Gravitas'' can be achieved by using the ten tropes listed in the [[Rhetorica ad Herennium|pseudo-Ciceronian ''Rhetorica ad Herennium'']].The chief trope is [[metaphor]]. The ''ornatus levis'' includes the figures of [[dictio]]n and of thought given in the ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]''.These figures are for the most part non-metaphorical.

The doctrine of conversion is a systematic method of varying a given sentence while preserving its meaning to make the sequence of words pleasant. The doctrine of determination consists primarily of creating a long sequence of brief phrases. This is the method and the manner of [[Sidonius Apollinaris|Sidonius]]. The contrary practice is that of [[Seneca the Elder|Seneca]]: to round off the verses with a quick conclusion. Geoffrey of Vinsauf, however, prefers to be "neither as long, nor as short, rather both long and short, being made both out of neither".

The remaining doctrines are treated very briefly. Words should be carefully chosen to keep the balance of meaning and form. The characters' actions and their speeches should be appropriate for their age, and the overall color should be in harmony with the subject. Excessive [[alliteration]], awkward violation of word order, and overly long [[Period (rhetoric)|periods]] are stylistic faults to be avoided. To polish his work an author has to apply "first the mind, second the ear, and third and last, that which should conclude the matter - usage". Only delight fosters memory. In delivery, one must follow the sense imitating in a controlled manner the emotions called for by the subject. Geoffrey of Vinsauf concludes his treatise with the observation that "power comes from speech, since life and death rest in its hands; however, language may perchance be aided, in moderation, by both expression and gesture".

==Influence==
Popularity of Geoffrey of Vinsauf's didactic treatises has raised the question of possible influence on the later English poets such as [[Chaucer|Geoffrey Chaucer]] (ca. 1342-1400), [[Thomas Usk]] (d. 1388), and [[John Gower]] (ca. 1330-1408). [[Chaucer]]'s parody in the ''[[The Nun's Priest's Tale|Nun's Priest's Tale]]'' of Geoffrey of Vinsauf's use of [[Apostrophe (figure of speech)|apostrophe]] seems to ridicule the instruction provided in the ''Poetria nova'', and has therefore been interpreted as Chaucer's contempt for Geoffrey of Vinsauf's doctrine. A more profound examination of Chaucer's principles of composition, however, reveals that the essential scheme of the ''[[The Wife of Bath's Prologue and Tale|Wife of Bath's Prologue]]'' (specifically, lines 193-828) conforms to the doctrine promulgated by Geoffrey of Vinsauf's ''Documentum''. The integration of the ''Poetria nova'' precepts into [[Troilus and Criseyde]] I, 1065-71 reflects Chaucer's interest in rhetorical doctrine in general, and in Geoffrey of Vinsauf's in particular.

The contribution of Geoffrey of Vinsauf to the ''artes poetriae'' is acknowledged by such distinguished rhetoricians, as [[John of Garland]] (ca. 1180 - ca. 1258), a teacher of grammar and literature at the University of Paris, in the ''Parisiana poetria'' (known also as ''De arte prosayca, metrica, et rithmica'', written and revised probably between 1220 and 1235), and Eberhard the German in the ''Laborintus''. Geoffrey of Vinsauf is praised by Gervais of Melkley and [[Desiderius Erasmus]] (1469–1536). Kelly asserts that understanding and appreciation of the writings of the great medieval poets, such as Chaucer, [[Dante]], [[Gottfried von Strassburg]], and [[Chrétien de Troyes]], can only be fully achieved if studied in the light of the instruction contained in treatises like Geoffrey of Vinsauf's ''Poetria nova'' and ''Documentum de modo et arte dictandi et versificandi''.

[[File:Harry-Edwards-healer.jpg|thumb|right|Harry Edwards]]
'''Harry James Edwards''' (29 May 1893 – 7 December 1976) was a self-proclaimed [[Energy medicine|spiritual healer]], teacher and author who had a career of nearly 40 years.

==Early years==
Born in London as one of nine children, Harry Edwards was son of [[Printer (publishing)|printer]] and a dressmaker. In 1905, aged 12, Edwards joined the London Diocese Church Lads Brigade. In 1907 he left school and began a seven-year apprenticeship to a printer. Dissatisfied with that career, he developed political aspirations and joined the local branch of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], for whom he campaigned.&lt;ref name=DR&gt;[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/RedwoodEdwardsSanctuary1.6.05.pdf Redwood, Dawn ‘’ The Harry Edwards Spiritual Healing Sanctuary’’] – brief biography&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
On the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 Edwards enlisted in the [[Royal Sussex Regiment]] and by late 1915 he was in [[Bombay]] en route for [[Tekrit]], where he worked to build the railway track between there and [[Baghdad]]. He was commissioned in the field, and achieved the rank of Captain.&lt;ref name=Biog&gt;[http://forum.sanctuary-burrowslea.org.uk/index.php?showtopic=22 Biography of Harry Edwards]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921 he returned to the UK and married Phyllis. The couple opened a stationer's shop and printing works in [[Balham]], and Edwards tried to launch himself into a political career, standing for [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliamentary]] and [[Local government in England|council]] seats as a Liberal candidate on several occasions, but with no success. By this stage he also had four children to support.&lt;ref name=DR/&gt;

==Spiritual healing==
[[File:Harry Edwards Spiritual Healing Sanctuary, Burrows Lea, Shere (March 2014) (1).JPG|thumb|right|The Harry Edwards Spiritual Healing Sanctuary at [[Shere]], Surrey]]
Edwards became a spiritual healer when he attended a meeting at a [[Spiritualism|spiritualist]] church in 1935 and was told by the [[Mediumship|medium]]s present that he had healing powers. His early attempts at spiritual healing were met with success, and gradually his reputation as a healer spread and his services became more in demand.&lt;ref name=Biog/&gt; During the [[Second World War]] Edwards served in the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]] and continued to run his printing business alongside his now growing practice as a healer. Gradually, as his fame spread, his healing took over from his printing business, which was later to be run by a brother. He moved to [[Stoneleigh, Surrey|Stoneleigh]] in Surrey just after the war, where he used the front room of his house as a healing sanctuary. 

Eventually, because of the increasing number of patients visiting him Edwards outgrew this home, so in 1946 he moved his family and his healing practice to Burrows Lea, a large house with several acres of gardens and woodland in [[Shere]], where he founded the 'Harry Edwards Healing Sanctuary'. As his fame as a healer spread he was receiving 10,000 letters a week asking for help and [[Energy medicine|distance healing]].&lt;ref name=DR/&gt; 

In 1948 Edwards held a healing demonstration in [[Manchester]] which was attended by 6,000 people. In September 1951 during the [[Festival of Britain]] he appeared at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in London, where he demonstrated [[Energy medicine|spiritual healing]] to a packed hall.&lt;ref name=Biog/&gt; In 1955 he founded and was the first President of the National Federation of Spiritual Healers (NFSH).&lt;ref&gt;[http://website.lineone.net/~enlightenment/harry_edwards.htm Harry Edwards Tribute website]&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards visited the island of Cyprus for his initiation into Daskalos' inner circle "The Researchers of Truth". The ceremony happened on April 1, 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Magus of Strovolos|last = Markides|first = Kyriacos C.|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 1985|isbn = 978-0-14-019034-2|location = England|pages = 215}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An 'Archbishops' Commission on Divine Healing' was set up in 1953 to investigate spiritual healing, and Edwards addressed the Commission in 1954, providing it with documentary evidence of a number of cases of successful healing for it to examine. At the same time he held a public demonstration in front of 6,000 people at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] to launch the '10 o'clock Healing Minute'. The Commission's report, published in 1958,&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.lambethpalacelibrary.org.uk:8080/Archives/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqSearch=RefNo=='MSS/2859'&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl The ‘Archbishops’ Commission on Divine Healing’ in the National Church Institutions Database of Manuscripts and Archives]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that neither [[Church of England|the Church]] or the medical profession accepted the claims of spirit healers that they were responsible for successful healings. Despite the fact that Harry Edwards had appeared before the Commission he was never sent a copy of the final report.&lt;ref name=Biog/&gt;

Edwards claimed that several deceased scientists worked through him, including [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Lord Lister]] and [[Louis Pasteur]].  The founder of the [[Aetherius Society]], [[Aetherius Society|George King]] was complimentary of his healing powers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innerpotential.org/pages/article/harryed.html Jason-Lloyd, Len ‘’Insight into Harry Edwards’’] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327215512/http://www.innerpotential.org/pages/article/harryed.html |date=27 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harry Edwards died in December 1976 aged 83.

==Skeptical reception==

A study in the ''[[The BMJ|British Medical Journal]]'' (Rose, 1954) investigated [[Energy medicine|spiritual healing]], [[therapeutic touch]] and [[faith healing]]. In a hundred cases that were investigated, no single case revealed that the healer's intervention alone resulted in any improvement or cure of a measurable organic disability.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Rose. (1954). ''Some Aspects of Paranormal Healing''. ''The British Medical Journal''. Volume 2, No. 4900. pp. 1329–1332.&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards claimed he had cured about a hundred thousand people in Britain but Rose could not verify a single cure by Edwards. Rose visited a healing session held by Edwards and observed that an old lady had claimed to have been cured during the session and had walked without her [[Walking stick|sticks]], but by the time the session was over was walking with two sticks out of the hall.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Thomas Sladek|John Sladek]]. (1974). ''The New Apocrypha: A Guide to Strange Sciences and Occult Beliefs''. Panther. pp. 120–124.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Normans|Norman]] family of '''Beaumont''' was one of the great baronial [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] families, who became rooted in England after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]].

==History==
[[Roger de Beaumont]], Lord (seigneur) of [[Pont-Audemer]], of [[Beaumont-le-Roger]], of [[Brionne]] and of [[Vatteville]], was too old to fight at the [[battle of Hastings|Hastings]] and stayed in [[Normandy]] to govern and protect it while William was away on the invasion. As a reward, he received lands in [[Leicestershire]]. His son [[Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert de Beaumont]], [[counts of Meulan|comte de Meulan]], who commanded the Norman right wing at Hastings, became the first [[Earl of Leicester]]. His brother [[Henry de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Warwick|Henri de Beaumont]] was created [[Earl of Warwick]].

During [[Stephen of England|Stephen]]'s reign, the twins [[Waleran de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Worcester|Galéran]] and [[Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester|Robert]] were powerful allies to the king, and as a reward Galéran (already [[comte de Meulan]]) was made [[Earl of Worcester]].

Counsel from the Beaumonts was important to the [[Duke of Normandy|Dukes of Normandy]], then by the kings of England.

'''Husayn Abd al-Hadi''' (given name also spelled ''Husain'' or ''Hussein''; surname also spelled ''Abdul Hadi'', also named ''Husain Bek'') (died 1835-36) was a sheikh of the Jabal Nablus region, head of the Abd al-Hadi clan of [[Arraba, Jenin|Arraba]] and a deputy of [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. During Ibrahim Pasha's rule, he also served as the governor of [[Sidon Eyalet]].

==Biography==
In the first days of the [[Muhammad Ali dynasty|Egyptian]] conquest of [[Ottoman Syria]], Husayn Abd al-Hadi welcomed the Egyptian commander Ibrahim Pasha after first coordinating a response to the conquest with Emir [[Bashir Shihab II]] of [[Mount Lebanon Emirate|Mount Lebanon]]. He accompanied Ibrahim Pasha in his siege of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], where the Wali of [[Sidon Eyalet]], [[Abdullah Pasha ibn Ali|Abdullah Pasha]] was holding out.&lt;ref&gt;Mishaqah, ed. Thackston, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; Ibrahim viewed the Abd al-Hadi family as a rising star among the rural nobility of [[Jabal Nablus]] and selected Husayn, the head of the clan, to be his deputy in Palestine,&lt;ref name="Doumani46"&gt;Doumani, 1995, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; while Acre was still under siege. Acre capitulated in May 1832. The elevation of a member of the Abd al-Hadi clan came at the expense of the [[Tuqan clan]]'s traditional and influential position in Jabal Nablus.&lt;ref&gt;Rustum, 1938, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Ibrahim Pasha spent most of his time in other parts of Syria and Husayn administered Palestine on his behalf.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1834 [[peasants' revolt in Palestine]], Husayn supported Ibrahim Pasha. The revolt was suppressed by the end of the year and Husayn was rewarded for his loyalty and effective service by being promoted to Mudir of Sidon Eyalet, which included all of Palestine.&lt;ref name="Doumani46"/&gt;{{verify source|date=September 2018}} He may have been assigned the post prior to the revolt, in late 1833.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1834, shortly after the execution of the main rebel leader of the revolt, [[Qasim al-Ahmad]], Husayn purchased both his home and [[Nabulsi soap|soap factory]] in [[Nablus]], where he relocated from his home village of [[Arraba, Jenin|Arraba]].&lt;ref&gt;Doumani, 1995, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; Soap was a major source of revenue in the city and owning factories represented power and wealth. Shaykh Yusef Qadri of [[Ya'bad]] served as Husayn's principal agent in Nablus, helped him acquire numerous prime commercial properties there and partnered with him in many of those investments.&lt;ref name="SoapDoumani"&gt;Doumani, 1995, Chapter: [http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft896nb5pc&amp;chunk.id=ch5&amp;toc.id=&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=eschol;query=Husayn%20Abd%20al-Hadi&amp;anchor.id=d0e11018#X Soap, Class, and State]&lt;/ref&gt;

Husayn served as Mudir of Sidon until his death in 1835 or 1836 (1251 AH). He is buried in the courtyard of the Zaytuna Mosque in [[Acre, Israel|Acre]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharon, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Husayn's sons also owned factories or served various administrative or political offices, including ٍSulayman (who succeeded his father as Wali&lt;ref&gt;Yazbak, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;), Mahmud, Muhammad and Abd ar-Rahman.

'''Jacques-Nicolas Billaud-Varenne''' (23 April 1756{{snd}}3 June 1819), also known as '''Jean Nicolas''', was a French personality of the [[French Revolution|Revolutionary period]]. Though not one of the most well known figures of the French Revolution, Jacques Nicolas Billaud-Varenne was an instrumental figure of the period known as the [[Reign of Terror]]. Billaud-Varenne climbed his way up the ladder of power during the period of The Terror, becoming one of the most militant members of the [[Committee of Public Safety]]. He was recognized and worked with French Revolution figures [[Georges Danton]] and [[Maximilien Robespierre]], and is often considered one of the key architects of the period known as The Terror.  "No, we will not step backward, our zeal will only be smothered in the tomb; either the Revolution will triumph or we will all die."&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Schama|Schama, Simon]]. ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'' (New York: Vintage Books, 1989), 809, 840.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Billaud-Varenne was born in [[La Rochelle]] as the son of a [[lawyer]] to the ''[[parlement]]'' of [[Paris]]. Since both his grandfather and father were lawyers, and he was the first son in his direct family, Varenne was guaranteed a solid education and the same profession. Billaud-Varenne was educated at the College of Oratorians of Niort and took Philosophy at La Rochelle. His education at Niort was particularly important in shaping his character because its methods of teaching were uncommon to the revolution. At Niort, modernity and tolerance were emphasized, as opposed to overbearing and possibly obstructive religious instruction present in most other schools of the time. Billaud-Varenne was also sent to Oratory school at Juilly, where he later became a professor when he felt dissatisfied with practicing law. Here he remained for a short while, until his writing of a comédie strained his relationship with those who ran the school and he was obliged to leave&lt;ref&gt;Levitine, George.  Culture and Revolution: Cultural Ramifications of the French Revolution (College Park, Maryland: Department of Art History, 1989), 70-79.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1785, the Oratorian college where he was Hall [[hall monitor|prefect of studies]]. He then went to Paris, married and bought a position as lawyer in the ''parlement''. In early 1789 he published at [[Amsterdam]] a three-volume work on the ''Despotisme des ministres de la France'' as well as a well received anti-clerical text titled "The Last Blow Against Prejudice and Superstition."&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, 1949, 12&lt;/ref&gt; As events moved closer towards Bastille Day, he adopted with enthusiasm the principles of the Revolution. An example of his beliefs regarding the Church can be found in this text: 

"''However painful an amputation may be, when a member is gangrened it must be sacrificed if we wish to save the body.''"&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, 1949, 12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early activism===
[[File:Jean Nicolas Billaud-Varenne.jpg|thumb|left|Jean Nicolas Billaud-Varenne]]
Joining the [[Jacobin Club]], Billaud-Varenne became, from 1790, one of the most violent anti-[[House of Bourbon|Royalist]] [[orator]]s, closely linked to [[Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois]]. After the [[flight to Varennes]] of [[List of French monarchs|King]] [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], he published a [[pamphlet]], ''L'Acéphocratie'', in which he demanded the establishment of a [[federal republic]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

On 1 July, in another speech at the Jacobin Club, he spoke of a [[republic]], arousing the derision of partisans of the [[constitutional monarchy]].  But when he repeated his demand for a republic a fortnight later, the speech was printed and sent to the Jacobin branch societies throughout France.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

On the night of 10 August 1792 (during [[10 August (French Revolution)|the attack on the Tuileries Palace]]) he met with Danton, Desmoulins, and other members of the Insurrectionary Commune during the critical hours before the overthrow of the monarchy. Later that day, he was elected one of the ''deputy-commissioners'' of the [[Sans-culottes|sections]] who shortly afterwards became the general council of the [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Paris Commune]]. He was accused of having been an accomplice in the [[September Massacres]] in the [[Prison de l'Abbaye|Abbaye prison]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

===Projects in the Convention===
Elected, like [[Maximilien Robespierre]], [[Georges Danton]], and Collot d'Herbois, a deputy of Paris to the [[National Convention]], he spoke in favour of the immediate abolition of the Bourbon monarchy, and the next day demanded that all acts be dated from the ''Year I of the [[First French Republic|French Republic]]'' (a measure adopted a little over a year later in the form of the [[French Revolutionary Calendar]]).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

At the trial of Louis XVI he added new charges to the accusation, proposed to refuse counsel to the king, and voted for death "''within 24 hours''". On 2 June 1793, in the context of [[Jean-Paul Marat]]'s anti-[[Girondist]] instigations, he proposed a decree of accusation against the Girondists; a week later, at the Jacobin Club, he outlined a programme which the Convention was to fulfil soon after: the expulsion of foreigners, the establishment of a [[tax]] on the rich, the deprivation of the rights of citizenship of all "''[[Anti-social behaviour|anti-social]]''" men, the creation of a [[French Revolutionary Army]], the monitoring of all officers and ''ci-devant'' [[French nobility|nobles]] (i.e.: those of aristocratic families who no longer held status after the [[French Revolution from the abolition of feudalism to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy#The abolition of feudalism|abolition of feudalism]]), and the [[death penalty]] for unsuccessful generals fighting in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

===Mission and Reign of Terror===
On 15 July he made a violent speech in the Convention in accusation of the Girondists. Sent in August as [[Representatives on mission|representative on mission]] to the ''[[Département in France|département]]s'' of the [[Nord (département)|Nord]] and of [[Pas-de-Calais]], he showed himself inexorable to all suspects.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

On his return, the calamities of the summer of 1793 and caused the Paris Commune to begin to organize an insurrection - an insurrection that would lead to Billaud-Varenne's ascension to the most powerful body in all of France. When the popular uprising did come on 5 September and the Commune marched on the [[National Convention]], Billaud-Varenne was one of the chief speakers agitating for change in leadership. He called for a new war plan from the Ministry of War and that a new Committee be created to oversee the whole government - thus superseding the existing [[Committee of Public Safety]].&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, 1949, 48&lt;/ref&gt; To mollify the insurrectionists, that night Billaud-Varenne was named President of the [[National Convention]] for a special two week session, followed by him being named to the [[Committee of Public Safety]] the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, 1949, 54&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Collot d'Herbois]], who was named the same day, his addition was seen as a way to co-opt the Paris Commune.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, 1989, 766&lt;/ref&gt; Once added to [[Committee of Public Safety]], he was then played a major role in defending it - calling for unity instead of change - on 25 October when the [[National Convention]] complained about the Committee and then officially sanctioned them. He was included in the [[Reign of Terror]]'s [[Committee of Public Safety]], which had decreed the [[mass arrest]] of all suspects and the establishment of a revolutionary army, caused the extraordinary criminal tribunal to be named officially "''[[Revolutionary Tribunal]]''" (on 29 October 1793), demanded the execution of [[Marie Antoinette]], and then attacked [[Jacques René Hébert]] and Danton. Meanwhile, he published ''Les Éléments du républicanisme'', in which he demanded a [[Redistribution (economics)|division of property]] among the citizens.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Once named to the Committee, Billaud-Varenne became a vocal defender of that body. Based in Paris during much of this year, Billaud-Varenne and [[Barère]] worked to develop the administrative apparatus and consolidate the power of the Committee. To that end, in early December he proposed a radical centralization of authority, a law that became known as the [[Law of 14 Frimaire]]. This law brought surveillance, economic requisition, the dispatch of legislative news, local administrators, and representatives on mission under the control of the Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, 1949, 124-127&lt;/ref&gt;He was also instrumental in defending the Terror: when a measure was passed into law in mid November 1793 allowing the accused the right of defense, Billaud-Varenne uttered his famous words in defense of the Terror:

"''No, we will not step backward, our zeal will only be smothered in the tomb; either the revolution will triumph or we will all die.''" The law enabling right of defense was overturned the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, 1989, 809&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermidor and exile===
As 1794 progressed, [[Robespierre]] began to speak out against over zealous factions: he believed both pro-Terror and indulgent positions were dangerous to the well-being of the Revolution. Robespierre saw danger in members of the Revolution, like Billaud-Varenne, Collot d'Herbois, and [[Marc-Guillaume Alexis Vadier]] who had been too committed to attacks on Church property or had been too vigorous in their pursuit of revolutionary justice (such as Collot at Lyon). The deChristianization program was seen as divisive and unnecessary by some in the Convention. Furthermore, the [[law of 22 Prairial]] had isolated the police wing of the Convention: the [[Committee of General Security]], a body that was extremely anti-clerical, had seen their power severely diminished by the law.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, 1949, 368-369&lt;/ref&gt; The [[law of 22 Prairial]] reduced the right of defense to simply an appearance before court, while greatly expanding the list of crimes punishable by death. This is what led directly to the Great Terror, in which more were killed by the Revolutionary Tribunal in Paris in those seven weeks than in the preceding fourteen months. Though Billaud-Varenne publicly defended it in the Convention, this law was a driving factor in the eventual reprisal against the Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer,1949,366-369&lt;/ref&gt; Serious arguments began to fracture the Committee, with Billaud-Varenne and Collot d'Herbois pitted against [[Robespierre]] and [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]]. On 26 June, they argued over the imposition of a new prosecutor to the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]]. On 29 June, an argument once again broke out between members of the [[Committee of Public Safety]]. Though it could have been about the [[Catherine Théot]] affair or the [[law of 22 Prairial]], it led to Billaud-Varenne branding [[Robespierre]] a dictator and the latter storming out of the Committee headquarters and ceasing to attend meetings.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer,
 1949, 369&lt;/ref&gt; With tensions being heightened and more guillotined every day - the rate of executions per day in Paris rose from five a day in Germinal to twenty-six a day in Messidor - Billaud-Varenne and Collot d'Herbois began to fear for their safety.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, 1989, 837&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the early days of Thermidor, [[Bertrand Barère]] attempted to forge compromise between the splintering Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, 1949, 379&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Robespierre]] was still convinced that the Convention needed further purging, and on 8 Thermidor he rose before that body to give a speech that would spark the [[Thermidorian Reaction]].&lt;ref&gt;Schama,
 1989, 841&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking of "monsters" that threatened the Republic with conspiracy, his speech was pointed enough to serve as a warning while being vague enough to worry many in the body.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, 1989, 842&lt;/ref&gt; When he was asked for the names of those in the conspiracy, [[Robespierre]] declined to provide them, and he was charged with indicting members of the Convention en masse without a hearing.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, 1989, 842&lt;/ref&gt;

That night, [[Robespierre]] retreated to the [[Jacobin Club]], where he gave the same speech to rousing applause. [[Collot d'Herbois]] and [[Billaud-Varenne]], as members who the speech may have been aimed at, attempted to defend themselves but were shouted down and expelled from the club as cries for "la guillotine," rained down upon them.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, 1949, 374&lt;/ref&gt; They returned to the [[Committee of Public Safety]] where they found [[Antoine Saint-Just]], the protege of [[Robespierre]], working on a speech he intended to deliver the next day. As one of the chief messengers of the terror, Collot and Billaud-Varenne both assumed that Saint-Just was writing their denunciation. At this moment the last argument of the Committee erupted, with Collot, Billaud-Varenne, and Barère attacking Saint-Just for "dividing the nation." After sometime, they departed the Committee and organized the last elements of the [[Thermidorian Reaction]].&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, 1949. 374&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, [[9 Thermidor]], Billaud-Varenne would play a critical role in the final stroke against [[Robespierre]] and his allies. As Saint-Just delivered his speech, he was interrupted near the beginning by another conspirator, [[Jean-Lambert Tallien]]. Billaud-Varenne was next to speak, with [[Collot d'Herbois]] controlling the debates from the President's Chair, and in an eloquent planned denunciation directly accused Robespierre of a conspiracy against the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, 1949, 377&lt;/ref&gt; This speech and others were warmly received, and after continued debate arrest warrants were issued for Robespierre, Saint-Just, and their allies. After a brief armed standoff, the conspirators would carry the day, and Robespierre and his allies would be executed the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, 1989, 846&lt;/ref&gt;

However, after 9 Thermidor, Billaud-Varenne was soon enough to find himself in prison. Too closely associated with the excesses of the [[Reign of Terror]], he was shortly attacked himself in the Convention for his ruthlessness, and a commission was appointed to examine his conduct and that of some other members of the former Committee of Public Safety.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Billaud-Varenne was arrested, and as a result of the Jacobin-led insurrection of 12 Germinal of the Year III (1 April 1795), the Convention decreed his immediate [[Penal transportation|deportation]] to [[French Guiana]], along with [[Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois|Collot d'Herbois]] and [[Bertrand Barère de Vieuzac]]. After [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s [[18 Brumaire|18 Brumaire coup]], he refused the [[pardon]] offered by the [[French Consulate]]. In 1816 he left Guiana, went to [[New York City]] for a few months, and finally took refuge in [[Port-au-Prince]] ([[Haiti]]), where he died of [[dysentery]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7297">[[Image:Jessechisholm.jpg|frame|right|Jesse Chisholm]]
'''Jesse Chisholm''' (''circa ''1805 - March 4, 1868) was a mixed-blood [[Cherokee]] fur trader. His name is most famous because of the [[Chisholm Trail|namesake cattle trail]], which he originally scouted and developed to supply his various [[trading post]]s among the Plains Indians in what is now western [[Oklahoma]]. Although Chisholm died before the heyday of the Texas-to-Kansas [[cattle drive]]s, he was nevertheless a participant in several important events in Texas and Oklahoma history.

Chisholm's father Ignatius was of [[Scotland|Scottish]] descent, and his mother Martha (née Rogers) was a [[Cherokee]] from the region of [[Great Hiwassee]]. He moved with his mother to Oklahoma during a period when Cherokees were migrating voluntarily. In 1826, Chisholm became involved in a gold-seeking party, who blazed a trail and explored the region to present day [[Wichita, Kansas]]. In 1830, he helped blaze a trail from [[Fort Gibson]] to [[Fort Towson]]. In 1834, he was a member of the [[Dodge-Leavenworth Expedition]], who made the first contact with the southern plains Indians on behalf of the United States federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/C/CH067.html |title=CHISHOLM, JESSE (ca. 1805-1868) |last=Hoig |first=Stan |date= |website=Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture |publisher=Oklahoma Historical Society |accessdate=August 23, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024044554/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/C/CH067.html |archivedate=October 24, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1836, Chisholm married Eliza Edwards. They resided in the area of her father's trading post on the [[Little River (Canadian River)|Little River]] near its confluence with the [[Canadian River]], where Jesse worked in the Indian trade.

[[Image:Chisholm monument in Bandera, TX Picture 092.jpg|250px|left|thumb|&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;Monument to Jesse Chisholm in [[Bandera, Texas]]&lt;/span&gt;]]

Chisholm was an interpreter and general aid in several treaties between the [[Republic of Texas]] and local Indian tribes, as well as between the United States federal government and various tribes after Texas joined the United States. This diplomatic work spanned 20 years, between 1838 and 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fch32 |title=CHISHOLM, JESSE |last=Richardson |first=T. C. |date= |website=The Handbook of Texas Online |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |accessdate=August 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this period, he also continued in the Indian trade, trading manufactured goods for peltry and for cattle.

During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], he mostly remained neutral. Many residents of [[Indian Territory]] feared they might be massacred, either intentionally or as an accident of war if either side attempted to contend for control of the territory. He led a band of refugees to the western part of the territory. For some time, they suffered privation, as the trade had dried up during the war, as well.

At the end of the war, he settled permanently near present-day Wichita, and recommenced trade into Indian Territory. He built up what had been a military and Indian trail into a road capable of carrying heavy wagons for his goods. This road became known as Chisholm's Trail. Later, when the Texas-to-Kansas cattle drives started, the users of the trail redubbed it the [[Chisholm Trail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rossel |first=John |date=February 1936 |title=The Chisholm Trail |url=http://www.kshs.org/p/kansas-historical-quarterly-the-chisholm-trail/12670 |journal=Kansas Historical Quarterly |publisher=Kansas Historical Society |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=3–14 |doi= |accessdate=August 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died at his last camp near [[Left Hand Spring (Oklahoma)|Left Hand Spring]] due to food poisoning on March 4, 1868, and is buried there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/founder-of-chisholm-trail-dies |title=Founder of Chisholm Trail dies — This Day in History — 3/4/1868 |date= |website=History.com |publisher= |accessdate=August 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chisholm was inducted into the [[Hall of Great Westerners]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;https://nationalcowboymuseum.org/hall-of-great-westerners/&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jesse Chisholm Grave Site|His grave site]] in [[Blaine County, Oklahoma|Blaine County]] is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

{{Adventism}}
Elder '''Jonas Wendell''' (December 25, 1815{{spaced ndash}}August 14, 1873) of [[Edinboro, Pennsylvania]], was a zealous [[Adventism|Adventist]] preacher following in the spirit of [[William Miller (preacher)|William Miller]]. Following the "[[Great Disappointment]]" Wendell experienced periods of weak faith, as did many Adventists.  He eventually recovered his faith after renewing his study of [[Bible chronology]] (historic and prophetic) and began to preach extensively throughout [[Ohio]], Pennsylvania, the Virginias, and [[New England]] By the late 1860s he had been studying the chronology of the Bible, and was encouraged by conclusions showing Christ's return would occur in either 1868 or 1873/4. In 1870 Wendell published his views in the booklet entitled ''The Present Truth, or Meat in Due Season'' concluding that the [[Second Advent]] was sure to occur in 1873. Unknown to him, attendance at one of his presentations restored [[Charles Taze Russell]]'s faith in the Bible as the true word of God, leading to Russell's ministry.

=="A Clergyman in Difficulty"==

In 1871 the Associated Press circulated a story that Wendell had been arrested in Pennsylvania on the charge of "improper intimacy" with a 16-year-old girl.&lt;ref&gt;Utica Daily Observer, May 30, 1871 pg 3&lt;/ref&gt;  No evidence of impropriety was ever produced, and Wendell publicly denied not only the charges, but that he had ever been arrested.&lt;ref&gt;New York Tribune, June 6, 1871 pg 5 col 2: "Sir:  I have just had my attention called to an article, which appeared in 'The Tribune' of May 29, headed "A Clergyman in Difficulty." I pronounce the charge therein made false, and without any foundation in truth. Respectfully yours, J. Wendell. Erie, Penn., June 2, 1871&lt;/ref&gt;

==Obituary==
The magazine ''The World's Crisis'' in the September 10, 1873 issue offered an [[obituary]] written by fellow [[Adventism|Adventist]] and personal friend, [[George Stetson]].  A brief summary appears below:

'''In Memory of Elder Jonas Wendell'''

"He was born December 25, 1815, and fell asleep August 14 1873. Age fifty seven years, seven months, and fourteen days. ...

"He had settled on 1873 as the year in which "the hope of seeing Jesus and being made like him" should be realized by a waiting and expectant church, and set forth the reasons for his hope in a little work entitled, "Present truth," or "Meat in Due Season," ...

"... on Wednesday evening, 13 August, by request, in absence of the pastor, he led the prayer and conference meeting, and much edified all present by his unusual fervency in prayer, exhortation, and singing. "What a friend we have in Jesus" was the last hymn he ever sung with us. On Thursday the 14th, he went to the Sabbath School picnic in most excellent spirits, and seemed to be very happy in the Lord. When time for adjournment arrived, he got out his horse to return home, but seeing a lad in trouble from a fickly horse, he went to his assistance, where he overtaxed his physical strength, and returned to his own buggy quite exhausted. But he got in and took the lines from his niece, to start home, but immediately loosened his hold, dropped them, and fell over backward in his seat, dead. He gave but two slight gasps for breath, and all was over...

"On Saturday, 16 August, at 2 P.M. his funeral was numerously attended at our chapel, when all the clergy of our village came to observe his obsequies, sympathize with his bereaved family, and participate in the services of the occasion... Medical opinion is divided between apoplexy and heart disease as cause of death.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary - ''The World's Crisis'' in the September 10, 1873&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Dennings blogged from January 2001 until February 20, 2010, on her website and also transitioned into [[video blog]]ging on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name="Premiere"/&gt; Dennings stated to ''[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]]'' that [[Judaism]] "is an important part of my history, but, as a whole, religion is not a part of my life." The article went on to say that she considers herself more ethnically and culturally affiliated than religiously so.&lt;ref name="JewishJournal"/&gt;

In December 2008, Dennings told ''[[BlackBook]]'' magazine, "I don't drink and I don't smoke and I don't like being around people who do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Horkins |first=Tony |url=http://www.bbook.com/the-new-regime-kat-dennings/ |title=The New Regime: Kat Dennings |work=[[BlackBook]] |date=December 7, 2008 |accessdate=December 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Dennings practices [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hoffman |first=Claire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/magazine/david-lynch-transcendental-meditation.html?pagewanted=all |title=David Lynch Is Back … as a Guru of Transcendental Meditation |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 22, 2013 |accessdate=February 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
In the [[Book of Mormon]], '''Laman''' and '''Lemuel''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|eɪ|m|ə|n|...|ˈ|l|ɛ|m|j|uː|l}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «lā´mun» and «lĕm´yūl»&lt;/ref&gt; are the two eldest sons&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne?lang=eng |title=Book of Mormon, Introduction to the first book of Nephi}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Lehi (Book of Mormon)|Lehi]] and the older brothers of [[Sam (Book of Mormon)|Sam]], [[Nephi, son of Lehi|Nephi]], [[Jacob (Book of Mormon prophet)|Jacob]], and [[Joseph (Book of Mormon)|Joseph]]. According to the text, they lived around 600 BC. They were notable for their rebellion against Lehi and Nephi, becoming the primary antagonists of the First and Second Books of Nephi. They and their descendants became known as the [[Lamanites]], while the descendants of Nephi and their other brothers became the [[Nephite]]s.

Laman was Lehi's first-born son. He rejected the teachings of his father (in particular Lehi's prophecy of the forthcoming destruction of [[Jerusalem]] in 600 BC). He and Lemuel persecuted and beat their brothers Sam and Nephi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3.28?lang=eng#27 |title=Book of Mormon, 1 Nephi 3:28}}&lt;/ref&gt; who supported Lehi. Because [[God]] chose Nephi to lead Lehi's descendants after his death, Laman maintained that he had been robbed of his [[primogeniture|birthright]], resulting in constant wars between the two peoples for nearly 600 years.

==God intervening==
In the Book of Mormon there are incidences of Laman and Lemuel beating or binding up Nephi. On the first occurrence, when they were beating Nephi and Sam with a rod, it tells how an angel visited the brothers, and the angel rebuked Laman and Lemuel.&lt;ref&gt;http://scriptures.lds.org/en/1_ne/3/28#28&lt;/ref&gt; On other occasions, Laman and Lemuel were chastened by the voice of the Lord, or "shocked" by divine power.

==River of Laman and Valley of Lemuel==
In {{lds|1 Nephi|1_ne|2|2|11}}, Lehi's party makes its way from Jerusalem towards the promised land. Verse 5 says that Lehi  "''came down by the borders near the shore of the [[Red Sea]]; and he traveled in the wilderness in the borders which are nearer the Red Sea.''" The group traveled for three more days after they had reached "the borders near the shore of the Red Sea" before making camp. At this point, they make camp "in a valley by the side of a river of water." Verses 8-10 read:

{{quote|And it came to pass that he called the name of the river, Laman, and it emptied into the Red Sea; and the valley was in the borders near the mouth thereof. And when my father saw that the waters of the river emptied into the fountain of the Red Sea, he spake unto Laman, saying: O that thou mightest be like unto this river, continually running into the fountain of all righteousness! And he also spake unto Lemuel: O that thou mightest be like unto this valley, firm and steadfast, and immovable in keeping the commandments of the Lord!}}

[[Hugh Nibley]], an LDS scholar and apologist, thought this area referred to as "the borders" was by [[Jabal al-Lawz]].&lt;ref name=Nibley1&gt;[[Hugh Nibley|Nibley, Hugh]] &amp; Hummel, Sharman Bookwalter (ed.) ''Nibley's Commentary on the Book of Mormon, Vol. 1'' (2013), ASIN: B00GFY0GUO&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
"Lemuel" (Hebrew:לְמוּאֵל) is the name of a [[Lemuel (Biblical king)|Biblical king]] mentioned in [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 31:1 and 4, but otherwise unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|title=Lemuel|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08771a.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In verse 4, it says, "Give not to kings, O Lemuel, give not wine to kings ..." The discourse, which is an exhortation to [[chastity]] and [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]], appears to end with verse 9, but might continue through the end of the chapter.

Hugh Nibley remarks Lemuel has a "good pure Arabic name, incidentally."&lt;ref name=Nibley1&gt;[[Hugh Nibley|Nibley, Hugh]] &amp; Hummel, Sharman Bookwalter (ed.) ''Nibley's Commentary on the Book of Mormon, Vol. 1'' (2013), ASIN: B00GFY0GUO&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book of Mormon Movie==
In ''[[The Book of Mormon Movie, Vol. 1: The Journey]]'', adapted from First and Second Nephi, Laman was portrayed by Mark Gollaher and Lemuel by Cragun Foulger. The portrayals were highly influenced by [[Arnold Friberg]] paintings of the characters.

The film was widely panned by Mormon&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700003321/Book-of-Mormon-Movie-Volume-1-The-Journey-The.html The Book of Mormon Movie], Deseret News&lt;/ref&gt; and non-Mormon critics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austinchronicle.com/calendar/film/2004-03-05/199711/ The Book of Mormon Movie, Volume 1: The Journey] in the Austin Chronicle&lt;/ref&gt;. The Austin Chronicle wrote of "''sinister siblings Laman and Lemuel (Gollaher, Foulger) running rampant with Stone Age stilettos and waywardness like some Hebraic version of the [[Bowery Boys]]’ [[Leo Gorcey]] and [[Huntz Hall]]''"

'''Mark Andreyevich Natanson''' ({{lang-ru|Марк Андреевич Натансон}}; [[pseudonym|Party name]]: Bobrov) (25 December 1850 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|N.S.]] 6 January 1851) - 29 July 1919) was a Russian-Jewish [[revolutionary]] and one of the founders of the [[Circle of Tchaikovsky]], [[Land and Liberty (Russia)|Land and Liberty]], and the [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]]. In 1917, he was a leader of the [[Left Socialist-Revolutionaries]], supporting the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[October Revolution]]. He was the uncle of [[Alexander Berkman]].

==Biography==
===Early years===

Mark Natanson was born in 1850 in [[Švenčionys]], [[Lithuania]] to a wealthy [[Jewish]] family. He studied in St Petersburg at the Medical and Surgical Academy (1868–71) and at the Institute of Agriculture (1871). During this time, he became involved in radical student politics. He opposed the 'nihilistic' tendency of [[Sergei Nechaev]]. Natanson participated in founding the vand the populist (''Narodnik'') organisation 'Land and Liberty' and helped organise some of the first socialist groups among the small industrial working class in Western Russia.

Natanson also took part in demonstrations, notably the Kazan demonstration in St Petersburg in 1876. After 'Land and Liberty' split, Natanson joined '[[The People's Will]]' (Narodnaya Volya). That group favoured agitation among urban workers and intellectuals over propaganda among the peasants (a tactic adopted by the other offshoot of 'Land and Liberty', the '[[Black Repartition]]' group). Narodnaya Volya also endorsed political terrorism as a tactic and in 1881 assassinated [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Aleksandr II]].

Natanson was not directly involved in any terrorist act, but, in 1877 he was arrested and banished to Siberia until 1889.&lt;ref name=MH&gt;Mandred Hildermeier, ''The Russian Socialist Revolutionary Party Before the First World War.'' New York: St. Martin's Press, 2000; pg. 382.&lt;/ref&gt;

===People's Rights Party===
After his release he returned to European Russia and became active in [[Saratov]], where in 1893 he founded the party [[People's Rights Party]] ''(Partiia Narodnogo Prava).''&lt;ref name=MH /&gt; Historian Shmuel Galai has argued that "for the first time in the annals of Russian parties, it declared organized public opinion to be the main weapon in the struggle against autocracy," in contradistinction to peasant revolt, general strike, or terror.&lt;ref&gt;Shmuel Galai, The Liberation Movement in Russia, 1900-1905. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1973; pg. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

The People's Rights Party proved to be a short-lived venture, as in 1894, Natanson was arrested again and banished to eastern Siberia for ten years.&lt;ref name=MH /&gt; Natanson remained an active revolutionary even in Siberian exile, maintaining the party treasury and coordinating various organisational tasks.&lt;ref name=MH /&gt;

In 1904, after his release, Natanson went into exile in Switzerland and there became involved in the Socialist-Revolutionary Party (PSR), which united a variety of populist and revolutionary organisations.

The tactical position adopted by the PSR represented a compromise between the rural agitation favoured by South Russian and Ukrainian populists, the factory organisation favoured by 'The People's Right' and the terrorist tactic embraced by the remnants of 'The People's Will' and some of the revolutionary groups of Moscow and St Petersburg. During the abortive Russian revolution of 1905–1907, Natanson returned to Russia and served on the central committee of the PSR.

After the revolution was put down, Natanson returned to exile in Switzerland.

===Years of exile===
When the [[First World War]] broke out in 1914, the PSR, like most other European socialist parties, split into those who supported a war of 'national defence' ('Defencists') and those who opposed the war ('Internationalists'). Natanson sided with the '[[Internationalist/Defencist Schism|Internationalists]]' and attended the international socialist peace conferences such as the [[Zimmerwald Conference]] and one at Kienthal in Switzerland, signing the conference's manifestoes on behalf of the SR Internationalists.&lt;ref name=MH /&gt;

Natanson returned to Russia in 1917 where he was active in the administration of the PSR.

===Founder of the Left SRs===
When the [[February Revolution]] occurred in Russia in 1917, Natanson returned to Russia and became one of the most prominent leaders of the left wing of the PSR, which became increasingly disenchanted with the Provisional Government and with [[Alexander Kerensky]]. The left wing SRs eventually broke away from the PSR and formed a separate party, the Party of [[Left Socialist Revolutionaries]]. Natanson and the Left SRs supported the Bolshevik Revolution in October 1917 and briefly entered the Soviet government. However, they rejected the Soviet-German peace [[treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] (later superseded by the [[Versailles treaty]]), which imposed onerous terms on Russia in exchange for a separate peace with Russia.

The Left SRs exited the Soviet government in protest, and some now took up arms against the Bolsheviks. Natanson opposed this course, fearing that a defeat of the Soviet government would spell the end of the revolution and usher in a counter-revolution. He founded the [[Revolutionary Communists|party of Revolutionary Communists]], which supported the Bolsheviks and eventually merged with the [[Communist Party of the USSR]]. Natanson was a member of the Presidium of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee. However, Natanson's opposition to the anti-Bolshevik uprising of the Left SRs did not imply whole-hearted acceptance of the Bolsheviks' policies. In particular, he objected to Lenin's decision to ban all other political parties in the Soviet Union.

===Death and legacy===
In 1919, Natanson once again returned to Switzerland and died there.

'''Mission specialist (MS)''' was a position held by certain [[NASA]] [[astronaut]]s. Mission specialists were generally assigned from the astronaut office pool to a limited field of a specific mission, such as those related to medical or engineering experiments. 

Other functions on board were [[aviator|pilot]], [[flight engineer]] and [[commander|mission commander]]. Some Space Shuttle missions included personnel assigned as [[payload specialist]]s in addition to standard mission specialists. While payload specialists were selected for a single specific mission, mission specialists were selected as astronauts first, and then subsequently assigned missions as NASA's needs dictated.

Mission specialist is abbreviated by NASA as MS.

'''Mitchell Livingston WerBell III''' (1918–1983) was an [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] operative, [[mercenary]], paramilitary trainer, firearms engineer, and arms dealer.

== Early life and OSS service ==
WerBell was born in Philadelphia, the son of a Czarist cavalry officer in the Imperial Army of Russia.  In 1942 WerBell joined the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) and served in China, Burma, and French Indochina.  As a guerrilla operative during World War II, he carried out a secret mission for the OSS under the command of [[Paul Helliwell]] in China with [[E. Howard Hunt]], [[Lucien Conein]], [[John K. Singlaub]] and [[Ray S. Cline|Ray Cline]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Iran-Contra Connection Secret Teams And Covert Operations In The Reagan Era'', P. 64, [[Peter Dale Scott]], South End Pr, 1987, {{ISBN|0-89608-291-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Undercover: Memoirs of an American Secret Agent'', [[E. Howard Hunt]], Berkley Pub. Corp, {{ISBN|978-0-399-11446-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Mintz, Staff Writer, Washington Post, January 14, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = ssa&gt;{{cite book | last = Truby | first = J. David  | title =Silencers, snipers &amp; assassins: an overview of whispering death| publisher = Paladin Press| year =1972 | pages = 108–110| isbn = 978-0-87364-012-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were paid with five-pound sacks of opium.&lt;ref&gt;Wall Street Journal, April 18, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;  Following World War II, WerBell briefly worked as the director of advertising and public relations for Rich's, a department store in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]; he left after a year to open his own PR firm.&lt;ref name=dunkin&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dunkin| first = Tom| title = Cobray: Turning the Tables on Terrorists| journal =Soldier of Fortune| volume =5 | issue =1 | pages=46–50|date =1980-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SIONICS ==
After WerBell closed his PR Firm to design [[suppressor]]s (commonly known as "silencers", a term which is a misnomer&lt;ref name="Guns&amp;Ammo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gunsandammo.com/2011/07/01/suppressors-arent-silencers/ |title=Suppressors Aren't Silencers |publisher=Guns &amp; Ammo}}&lt;/ref&gt;) for firearms, he incorporated [[SIONICS]] to design suppressors for the [[M16 rifle]]. The name was an acronym for "Studies In the Operational Negation of Insurgents and Counter-Subversion".  Through SIONICS he developed a low cost, efficient suppressor for machine guns.

In 1967 he partnered with [[Gordon B. Ingram]], inventor of the [[MAC-10]] submachine gun. They added WerBell's suppressor to Ingram's machinegun and attempted to market it to the U.S. military as "Whispering Death" for use in the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="TT"&gt;{{cite book| last = Long| first = Duncan| title = Terrifying Three: Uzi, Ingram And Intratec Weapons Families| publisher = Paladin Press| year = 1989| pages = 25-31| location = Boulder, Colorado| isbn = 978-0-87364-523-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  WerBell is credited with over 25 different suppressor designs and the "WerBell Relief Valve", a mechanism designed for machinegun suppressors.&lt;ref name=ssa/&gt;  WerBell's modular designs and use of exotic materials such as titanium in sound suppressors influence their design to the present day.&lt;ref name=ssa/&gt;

SIONICS was absorbed by the company MAC ([[Military Armament Corporation]]) and later called [[Cobray]] where WerBell developed a training center for counterterrorism in the 1970s.  The courses lasted 11 weeks and students included members of the military, high-risk executives, CIA agents, and private individuals.&lt;ref name=dunkin/&gt;  WerBell concurrently ran Defense Systems International, an arms brokerage firm.

== Mercenary activities ==
In the 1950s, WerBell served as a security advisor to Dominican dictator [[Rafael Trujillo]] and to the [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista]] regime in Cuba. 
In 1966 WerBell helped plan an invasion of Haiti by Cuban and Haitian exiles against "Papa Doc" [[François Duvalier]] called Project Nassau (but internally referred to as Operation Istanbul). The mission, which (according to [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) and the Special Subcommittee on Investigations of the House Commerce Committee) was financially subsidized, and to be filmed by [[CBS news]], was aborted when the participants were arrested by the FBI. WerBell was released without being charged.&lt;ref&gt;http://tech.mit.edu/archives/VOL_091/TECH_V091_S0103_P006.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 WerBell was approached by the [[Abaco Independence Movement]] (AIM) from the [[Abaco Islands]], a region of the [[Bahamas]], who were worried about the direction the Bahamas were taking and were considering other options, such as independence or remaining a separate Commonwealth nation under the Crown in case of the Bahamas gaining independence (which they did in 1973). AIM was funded by the [[Phoenix Foundation]], a group which aims to help build truly free [[micronation]]s. The AIM collapsed into internal bickering before a coup by Werbell could be carried out.&lt;ref&gt;Naylor, Robin T ''Wages of Crime:Black Markets, Illegal Finance and the Underworld Economy Cornell University Press (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 WerBell was asked to assist with a ''[[coup d'état]]'' against [[Omar Torrijos]] of [[Panama]], according to CIA documents released in 1993. WerBell sought clearance from the CIA which denied getting involved in coups. The plan was not implemented, though Torrijos died in a plane crash five years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Secrets from the C.I.A. Archives.|first= David|last= Corn|work=The Nation|date=November 29, 1993|volume=257|issue=18|page=656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1979 ''20/20'' interview WerBell claimed that [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]] had hired him for $1 million to take care of kidnapping threats against its [[Argentine]] executives during an urban terrorist wave in 1973. Coca-Cola later denied the claim.&lt;ref name = dunkin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Louis (1973) "How Coke Runs a Foreign Empire", ''Business Week'' P.41&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in life WerBell claimed he was a retired Lieutenant General in the [[Royal Free Afghan Army]] or sometimes an Afghan Defense Minister after supplying Afghanistan with large weapons contracts and training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Didion| first = Joan | title =We Tell Ourselves Stories in Order to Live: Collected Nonfiction| publisher = Knopf| year =2006 | pages = 651–652| isbn = 978-0-307-26487-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  WerBell claimed he was given the billet of Major General in the US Army to allow him to travel freely in Southeast Asia during the [[Vietnam War]] to demonstrate and sell his silenced submachineguns and sound suppressors.  This has been confirmed by Major General [[John Singlaub]] and Lt Col. William Mozey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video  | people = Major General John Singlaub, Mitch WerBell, Lt Col. William Mozey  | title = American Mercenaries: The Story of Mitch WerBell  | medium = video  | publisher = Brigade Quartermasters  | location = Powder Springs, Georgia  | date = 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other exploits ===
Other exploits include an alleged, but unsubstantiated, presence at [[Dealey Plaza]] on [[November 22, 1963]] when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated; spearheading the 1965 [[Operation Power Pack|Invasion of the Dominican Republic]]; being tried and acquitted on charges of conspiracy to marijuana smuggling&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmarger.com/articles/werbelldraftingdefense.htm The Law Offices of Edwin Marger - Drug Trial&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; reportedly in association with [[Gerry Patrick Hemming]] and with the acquiescence of [[Lucien Conein]]; and providing physical security services and training for [[Lyndon LaRouche]] security forces.

In 1988, Sheriff [[Sherman Block]] of [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]] announced that ''[[Hustler (magazine)|Hustler]]'' publisher [[Larry Flynt]] wrote WerBell a $1 million check in 1983 to kill [[Hugh Hefner]], [[Bob Guccione]], [[Walter Annenberg]], and [[Frank Sinatra]].&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt; Los Angeles television station [[KNBC]] displayed a photocopy of the check.&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt; WerBell died in Los Angeles a month after receiving the check.&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;{{cite news|title=Alleged Flynt Plot to Have Sinatra, Others Killed Reported|work=Los Angeles Times|date=October 27, 1988|page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sheriff: Flynt offered $1M for slayings|first=Gary |last=Stern|work=USA TODAY|location=McLean, Va.|date=October 27, 1988|page=03.A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death and courtroom poisoning claim ===
In the 1989 [[The Cotton Club (film)|''Cotton Club'']] murder case of [[Roy Radin]], Arthur Michael Pascal, then owner of a [[Beverly Hills]] security firm,&lt;ref name=MC&gt;{{cite news|author=Michael Connelly|title=Slaying Case Takes a New Twist With Security Firm Owner's Arrest Crime: A.

'''Muhammad al-Ashmar''' ({{lang-ar|محمد الأشمر}}) (1892–1960) was a [[Mandatory Syria|Syria]]n rebel commander during the [[Great Syrian Revolt]] and the [[1936-1939 Arab revolt in Palestine]], and a prominent communist figure in post-independence Syria.&lt;ref name="Pierret176"&gt;Pierret, 2013, p.   [https://books.google.com/books?id=1YemPpfsU20C&amp;pg=PA176   176]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Al-Ashmar was born in the [[al-Midan]] quarter of [[Damascus]] in 1892 during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman era]]. He served in the [[Ottoman Army]] during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Atiyeh250"&gt;Atiyeh, 1988, p.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=JXbXRKRY_uAC&amp;pg=PA250  250]&lt;/ref&gt; He spent much of his early life studying [[Islamic theology]]. France gained control of Syria in 1918, establishing a [[French Mandate of Syria|mandate]] over the country in 1920.&lt;ref name="Moubayed367"&gt;Moubayed, 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=sC-xU8QHSooC&amp;pg=PA367 367]&lt;/ref&gt; By then, al-Ashmar became a prominent Muslim ''[[sheikh]]'' based in al-Midan.&lt;ref name="Atiyeh250"/&gt; Al-Ashmar gathered about 40-50 of his men from al-Midan to form part of the civilian volunteer units backing the Syrian forces against the invading [[Army of the Levant|French Army]] at the [[Battle of Maysalun]] on 24 July.&lt;ref&gt;Gelvin, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sami Moubayed, al-Ashmar joined [[Hananu Revolt|Ibrahim Hananu]]'s militia based in the region of [[Aleppo]].&lt;ref name="Moubayed367"/&gt;

Al-Ashmar was arrested in 1922 for his earlier participation in the countrywide rebellions and exiled to the southern [[Hauran]] region. He managed to return to northern Syria to partake in anti-French activities in the [[Syrian Coastal Mountain Range|Syrian Coastal Mountains]]. He was exiled to [[Amman]] in [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]] in 1923.&lt;ref name="Moubayed367"/&gt;

==Role in Great Syrian Revolt==
Al-Ashmar played a leading role as a commander during the [[Great Syrian Revolt]] against French rule between 1925 and 1927.&lt;ref name="Pierret176"/&gt; He was also an early liaison between the main leader of the revolt, [[Sultan Pasha al-Atrash]], and the notables of Damascus. He was a part of the first Damascene delegation to al-Atrash, who was based in the [[Hauran]] region, along with [[Nasib al-Bakri]] and Yahya al-Hayati.&lt;ref&gt;Atiyeh, 1988, p.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=JXbXRKRY_uAC&amp;pg=PA250 260]&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Ashmar and al-Atrash were supporters of the [[Hashemite]]s, who had led the [[Arab Revolt]] in 1916, ruled Syria until 1918, and were the nominal leaders of [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]] and [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]] at the time of the 1925 revolt.&lt;ref name="Atiyeh250"/&gt; Al-Atrash designated al-Ashmar as a field commander of the revolt.&lt;ref name="Moubayed367"/&gt;

On 17 October 1925, al-Ashmar, along with commander [[Hasan al-Kharrat]], led a rebel assault against the French military in Damascus. His forces set government buildings alight and took over the [[Azm Palace]] where the French High-Commissioner, [[Maurice Sarrail]], resided, although he was not present during the assault,&lt;ref name="Moubayed367"/&gt; which left 180 French military personnel dead. Sarrail subsequently ordered a massive aerial bombardment of the city, resulting in the deaths of 1,500 people.&lt;ref name="Provence104"&gt;Provence, 2005, pp.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ej8ZMk1822sC&amp;pg=PA104 104]–105&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, al-Ashmar went into exile in Transjordan to escape an arrest warrant for his alleged responsibility in the killing of five French officers. When the French Mandatory government requested that the British authorities in Transjordan arrest al-Ashmar, the British refused, citing his status as a political refugee.&lt;ref name="Barr164"&gt;Barr, 2012, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Syria after a general amnesty in 1932.&lt;ref name="Moubayed367"/&gt;

==Role in Palestine revolt==
In August 1936, al-Ashmar became the second-in-command to [[Fawzi al-Qawuqji]] of an [[Arab]] volunteer force that arrived in northern [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] to aid local peasant rebels in the [[1936-1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|Palestinian Arab revolt]] against [[Mandatory Palestine|British rule]].&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, ed. Schayegh, 2015, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=mj3LCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA395  395]&lt;/ref&gt; He commanded the Arab volunteer force's Syrian battalion between August and October 1936.&lt;ref name="Thomas381"&gt;Thomas, 2008, p.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=lgZwF1MGUx8C&amp;pg=PA381 381]&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Syria in late 1936 after a truce was reached. His was celebrated by the residents of Damascus when he arrived in the city. The British requested the French to arrest al-Ashmar for his role in the revolt, but they refused, claiming that the arrest of a popular public figure like al-Ashmar would provoke unrest in Syria.&lt;ref name="Barr164"/&gt;

Hostilities resumed in late 1937 after Palestinian Arab objections to the recommendations of the [[Peel Commission]], which called for Palestine's partition into Jewish and Arab states. The newly established, Damascus-based [[Central Committee of National Jihad in Palestine]] of exiled Palestinian figures under [[Hajj Amin al-Husseini]]'s leadership requested that al-Ashmar, along with al-Qawuqji, lead rebel forces in Palestine in November 1937,&lt;ref name="Thomas381"/&gt; but this effort was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Frisch, 2012, p.   [https://books.google.com/books?id=SLdwp_4BZhMC&amp;pg=PA22   22]&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Ashmar still maintained involvement with the revolt from Damascus and issued ''[[fatwa]]s'' sought by Palestinian rebel commanders, often [[Yusuf Abu Durra]] and [[Farhan al-Sa'di]], for the assassination of specific local Palestinian leaders who they suspected of collaborating with the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Kedourie, 2015, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qj6sCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA80  80]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics in Syria==
Upon his return to Syria, al-Ashmar agitated for the establishment of a state governed by [[Islamic law]] and free of Western influence.&lt;ref name="Moubayed367"/&gt; He became a strong supporter of the [[National Bloc (Syria)|National Bloc]] leader [[Abd al-Rahman Shahbandar]].&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 2013, p.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=B9fruGejwmUC&amp;pg=PA265  265]&lt;/ref&gt; He lent his support to [[Shukri al-Quwatli]] in the 1943 presidential elections because of the latter's promise to allow Muslim activist organizations more political freedom in return for al-Ashmar's help in gaining votes from the al-Midan quarter.&lt;ref name="Moubayed367"/&gt; Quwatli won the elections, but abandoned his promises to the Muslim activist groups, angering al-Ashmar and conservative activists throughout the country. They formed movements aimed at removing Quwatli from power and opposing his [[social liberalism]], particularly his permission for cinemas and [[cabaret]]s to open in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Moubayed, 2006, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=sC-xU8QHSooC&amp;pg=PA367 367]-368&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Al-Ashmar became a popular figure in Syria for his participation in the Syrian and Palestinian anti-colonial revolts.&lt;ref name="Pierret176"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 2013, p.   [https://books.google.com/books?id=B9fruGejwmUC&amp;pg=PA262 262]&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 May 1944, he addressed a crowd of hundreds of conservative Syrian Muslims at the [[Tankiz]] Mosque in [[Marjeh Square]], Damascus, strongly condemning the increasing prevalence of unveiled women, cinema and the city's hosting of a charity banquet at the French Officers' Club sponsored by the French-Christian "Drop of Milk" society and the wife of then-education minister, [[Nasuhi al-Bukhari]]. The speech inspired the crowd to demonstrate against the banquet, with the demonstrations descending into riots. Clashes between demonstrators and the police resulted in the deaths of two protesters, including a 12-year-old boy, in the [[al-Salihiyah]] quarter. Al-Ashmar was arrested and sent to the [[Tadmor Prison]] in the [[Syrian Desert|desert]] city of  [[Tadmur|Palmyra]] the following day. The protests subsequently spread to other parts of Damascus, and also [[Aleppo]] and [[Homs]], with participants calling for al-Ashmar's release.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 2013, pp.   [https://books.google.com/books?id=B9fruGejwmUC&amp;pg=PA262 262]-263&lt;/ref&gt; President Quwatli had al-Ashmar released days later in response to the uproar. Months later, al-Ashmar strongly condemned the Quwatli administration's participation in a women's suffrage conference in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]] in December 1944.&lt;ref name="Moubayed368"&gt;Moubayed, 2006, p.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=sC-xU8QHSooC&amp;pg=PA368 368]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Syria's independence in 1946, al-Ashmar became a supporter of the [[Syrian Communist Party]]. His backing was a major factor in the party's good performance in al-Midan during the [[Syrian parliamentary election, 1954|1954 parliamentary elections]].&lt;ref name="Pierret176"/&gt; He headed the communist Syrian Partisans of Peace and was a member of the [[World Peace Council]]. Al-Ashmar was awarded the [[Stalin Peace Prize]] by the [[Soviet Union]] in March 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Ginat, 2010, p.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=rlxqHiFdFjwC&amp;pg=PA152   152]&lt;/ref&gt; He largely retired from politics around this time and died in Damascus in 1960.&lt;ref name="Moubayed368"/&gt;

'''Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu''' (born 13 April 1960&lt;ref&gt;https://www.icao.int/DownloadDocsFix/pres_cv_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;) is the fifth and current President of the Council of the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icao.int/about-icao/Pages/council-president.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Among many notable accomplishments since taking office, he has been recognized most widely for his diplomatic determination and leadership in forging global consensus on the CORSIA MBM, a carbon offsetting scheme, at ICAO’s 39th Assembly in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/03/business/energy-environment/pollution-accord-is-set-for-global-flights-but-tasks-remain.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; and has helped to refocus ICAO on the assistance and capacity-building aspects of its mandate since taking office in 2014, under the No Country Left Behind initiative.

President Aliu previously served as the Representative of Nigeria to ICAO, during which time he was the First Vice-President of the Council and chaired many of the Council’s major committees. Prior to that, he held various positions and responsibilities with Nigeria and African aviation institutions. His significant contributions to air transport development in Africa during his 30-year career in aviation has been recognized by way of an African Airlines Association (AFRAA) Individual Achievement Award (2011)&lt;ref&gt;https://issuu.com/afraa/docs/africawings_issue_16&lt;/ref&gt; and African Aviation Leadership Individual Achievement Award (2010).

==Early life==
Granville Oral Roberts was born on January 24, 1918, in [[Pontotoc County, Oklahoma]], the fifth and youngest child of the Reverend Ellis Melvin Roberts (1881&amp;ndash;1967) and Claudia Priscilla Roberts (née Irwin) (1885&amp;ndash;1974).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Oral Roberts's Mother Dies |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/19/archives/oral-robertss-mother-dies.html |date=1974-04-19 |accessdate=2009-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an interview on ''[[Larry King Live]]'', Roberts was of [[Cherokee]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0201/31/lkl.00.html|title=Interview With Lennox Lewis; Interview With Oral Roberts (transcript)|date=January 31, 2002|work=[[Larry King Live]]|accessdate=December 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Roberts was a card-carrying member of the [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cherokee Community of Central California|url=http://centralca.cherokee.org/|accessdate=May 23, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808004339/http://centralca.cherokee.org/|archivedate=August 8, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts began life in poverty and nearly died of tuberculosis at age 17.&lt;ref name="TulsaToday"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tulsatoday.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1429:oral-roberts-dies&amp;catid=58:local&amp;Itemid=106 |title=Oral Roberts Dies |publisher=''Tulsa Today''|date=December 15, 2009|first=David |last=Arnett |accessdate=December 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After finishing high school, Roberts studied for two years each at [[Oklahoma Baptist University]] and [[Phillips University]].
In 1938, he married a preacher's daughter, Evelyn Lutman Fahnestock.

Roberts became a traveling [[faith healer]] after ending his college studies without a degree. According to a ''[[TIME Magazine]]'' profile of 1972, Roberts originally made a name for himself with a large mobile tent "that sat 3,000 on metal folding chairs".&lt;ref name="Time1972"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,905738-1,00.html|title=Religion: Oral's Progress|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|date=February 7, 1972|accessdate=2007-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ministry and university==
In 1945, Roberts resigned his pastorate in [[Shawnee, Oklahoma]] to hold revivals in the area and attend Oklahoma Baptist. But in the late summer of 1945, while preaching in a North Carolina camp meeting, Roberts was asked by Robert E. "Daddy" Lee of [[Toccoa, Georgia]] to consider becoming pastor of his small, eighty-member church. Roberts suggested they pray about it, and unexpectedly, decided to accept. By the end of the year, Roberts resigned and moved back to Shawnee. Apparently, the [[International Pentecostal Holiness Church|Georgia conference of the International Pentecostal Holiness Church]] frowned on having a minister from outside its conference as pastor. Short though it was, the Toccoa detour had a lasting effect on Roberts and his family. It was there that their daughter Rebecca, then five years old, first met her future husband, Marshall. There were also reportedly two instances of healing, which Roberts would later look back on as his first realization "that I was approaching 'my hour'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrell|first1=David Edwin|title=Oral Roberts: an American Life|date=1985|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=0585104719|page=61|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rtz1InGWAmYC&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;ots=jbrLQ0NDXa&amp;dq=oral%20roberts%20toccoa&amp;pg=PA61#v=onepage&amp;q=oral%20roberts%20toccoa&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1947 was a turning point. Up until that time, Roberts struggled as a part-time preacher in Oklahoma. But at the age of 29, Roberts said, he picked up his Bible and it fell open at the [[Third Epistle of John]] where verse two read: "I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth." The next day, he said, he bought a [[Buick]] and God appeared, directing him to heal the sick.&lt;ref name="guardianobit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/15/oral-roberts-obituary|title=Oral Roberts obituary|last=Christopher|first=Reed|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=December 15, 2009|accessdate=December 21, 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts resigned his pastoral ministry with the [[Pentecostal Holiness Church]] to found [[Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association]] (OREA).&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt; He conducted evangelistic and [[faith healing]] crusades across the United States and around the world, claiming he could raise the dead.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/27/us/oral-roberts-tells-conference-he-has-raised-people-from-the-dead.html "Oral Roberts Tells Conference He Has Raised People From the Dead"], ''[[New York Times]]'', June 27, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"I've Raised People from the Dead, Oral Roberts tells 5,000 in Tulsa," ''[[The Pittsburgh Press]]'', June 26, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1947, he started ''Healing Waters'', a monthly magazine as a means to promote his meetings.&lt;ref&gt;Harrell, Jr., David Edwin (1985). ''Oral Roberts: An American Life''. Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University Press. p. 112. {{ISBN|0-253-15844-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thousands of sick people waited in line to stand before Oral Roberts so he could pray for them. He appeared as a guest speaker for hundreds of national and international meetings and conventions. Through the years, he conducted more than 300 crusades on six continents, and personally laid hands in prayer on more than 2 million people.&lt;ref name="TulsaToday"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://laist.com/2009/12/15/evangelist_dr_oral_roberts_dies_at.php|title=Evangelist Dr. Oral Roberts Dies at 91 in Newport Beach|last=Behrens|first=Zach|publisher=''[[LAist]]''|date=December 15, 2009|accessdate=December 19, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218081733/http://laist.com/2009/12/15/evangelist_dr_oral_roberts_dies_at.php|archivedate=December 18, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pr_121509"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oral Roberts Dies: Funeral Arrangements Pending for Legendary Evangelist |url=http://static.ktul.com/documents/oralroberts.pdf |publisher=[[KTUL-TV]] |date=December 15, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222070102/http://static.ktul.com/documents/oralroberts.pdf |archivedate=December 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also ran direct mail campaigns of [[Seed Faith|seed-faith]], which appealed to poor Americans, often from ethnic minorities. At its peak in the early 1980s, Roberts was the leader of a $120 million-a-year organization employing 2,300 people. This included not only a university but also a medical school and hospital as well as buildings on {{convert|50|acre|m2}} south of [[Tulsa]] valued at $500 million.&lt;ref name="NYT_obit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardianobit"/&gt; Another part of the Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association, the [[Abundant Life Prayer Group]] (ALPG), was founded in 1958.&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt;

[[File:Praying Hands at the main entrance to the campus of Oral Roberts University.jpg|thumb|left|The Praying Hands, on the ORU campus in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]]]

In 1963, he founded [[Oral Roberts University]] (ORU)&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt; in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], stating he was obeying a command from God. The university was chartered during 1963 and received its first students in 1965. Students were required to sign an honor code pledging not to [[alcohol (drug)|drink]], [[tobacco|smoke]], or engage in premarital sexual activities. The [[Prayer Tower]], opened in 1967, is located at the center of the campus.

Roberts was a pioneer [[televangelism|televangelist]], and attracted a vast viewership. He began broadcasting by radio in 1947,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Broadcasters Vote Three to Hall of Fame|url=http://oabok.org/documents/HOF_info_for_website.pdf|publisher=Oklahoma Association of Broadcasters|year=2010|accessdate=June 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HOF"&gt;{{cite news|title=Chancellor Roberts Elected to Hall of Fame|url=http://www.oru.edu/news/oru_news/20091120_chancellor_roberts_elected.php|publisher=[[Oral Roberts University]]|date=November 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began broadcasting his revivals by television in 1954.&lt;ref name="NYT_obit"/&gt; His television ministry continued with ''The Abundant Life'' program reaching 80% of the United States by 1957, and quarterly Prime Time Specials from 1969 through 1980. In 1996, he founded [[Golden Eagle Broadcasting]].&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt;

On March 17, 1968, Roberts and his wife were received as members of the Boston Avenue [[United Methodist Church]] in Tulsa, Oklahoma by Dr. [[Finis Alonzo Crutchfield, Jr.|Finis Crutchfield]], then pastor. The [[United Methodist Church]] offered more leniency in doctrinal and moral issues than the Pentecostal Holiness Church had. This granted Roberts some leeway, as it was expected that the strictness of the Pentecostal tradition may have impeded his rise in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Oral Roberts: An American Life |last=Harrell, Jr. |first=David Edwin |year=1985 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington, Indiana |isbn=0-253-15844-3 |page=298}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Before Roberts' switch to Methodism, Crutchfield arranged a meeting between Roberts and [[William Angie Smith|Bishop William Angie Smith]], at which the Bishop told Roberts, "We need you, but we need the Holy Spirit more than we need you and we've got to have the Holy Spirit in the Methodist Church."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Oral Roberts: An American Life |last=Harrell, Jr. |first=David Edwin |year=1985 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington, Indiana |isbn=0-253-15844-3 |page=294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts became an [[Elder (Methodism)|elder]] in the Oklahoma Conference of the United Methodist Church.

At the time, it was among the largest health facilities of its kind in the world and was intended to merge prayer and medicine in the healing process. The City of Faith operated for only eight years before closing in late 1989, but the importance of treating the [[Holistic health|whole person]]—spirit, mind, and body—was conveyed to many medical professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oral Roberts Dies |url=http://www.alrcnewskitchen.com/eblast/others/091215_orea.pdf |publisher=A.

Roberts' fundraising was controversial.

Roberts maintained his love of finery and one obituary claimed that even when times became economically hard, "he continued to wear his Italian silk suits, diamond rings and gold bracelets—airbrushed out by his staff on publicity pictures".&lt;ref name="guardianobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph_obit"/&gt;

In 1987, ''Time'' stated that he was "re-emphasizing faith healing and [is] reaching for his old-time constituency."&lt;ref name="Time1987"/&gt; However, the income of his organization continued to decrease (from $88 million in 1980 to $55 million in 1986, according to the ''[[Tulsa Tribune]]'') and his largely vacant City of Faith Medical Center continued to lose money.&lt;ref name="Time1987"/&gt;

Harry McNevin said that in 1988 the ORU Board of Regents "rubber-stamped" the "use of millions in endowment money to buy a Beverly Hills property so that Oral Roberts could have a West Coast office and house."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Juozapavicius|first=Justin|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/08/AR2007110801341_pf.html|title=Oral Roberts' Son Accused of Misspending|work=[[The Washington Post]]|agency=Associated Press|date=November 8, 2007|accessdate=2009-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he said a country club membership was purchased for the Roberts' home.

'''Patrick De'mon Peterson Jr.''' (born July 11, 1990) is an [[American football]] [[cornerback]] for the  [[Arizona Cardinals]]  of the [[National Football League]] (NFL). He played college football at [[Louisiana State University]] (LSU), where he won the [[Chuck Bednarik Award]] as the best defensive player in the country, the [[Jim Thorpe Award]] as the best defensive back, and was unanimously recognized as an [[College Football All-America Team|All-American]]. He was selected fifth overall by the Cardinals in the first round of the [[2011 NFL Draft]]. Peterson has been invited to the [[Pro Bowl]] in each of his first seven seasons in the NFL.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/P/PetePa00.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Peterson was born in [[Pompano Beach, Florida]] on July 11, 1990. He attended [[Blanche Ely High School]], where he played [[running back]] and [[defensive back]] for the Blanche Ely Mighty Tigers [[high school football]] team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/highschool/football/broward/fl-patrick-peterson-football-camp-0630-20130629-story.html |title=Former Blanche Ely star Peterson hosts youth camp in Pompano Beach |last=Cabrera |first=Christy |work=Sun-Sentinel.com |access-date=2018-02-18 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his junior campaign, he recorded 11 total touchdowns on offense, while recording seven interceptions and 54 tackles on defense. He also returned three kick-offs for touchdowns and added 10 rushes for 213 yards. As a senior, Peterson compiled 733 yards rushing and 11 touchdowns (9 rushing, one kick return and one punt return). Defensively, he had 21 tackles and five interceptions. Besides numerous All-American team selections, Peterson was named Defensive Player of the Year by ''[[USA Today]]'' and played in the 2008 [[U.S. Army All-American Bowl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.goarmy.com/events/all-american-bowl/all-american-alumni.html |title=U.S. Army All-American Bowl Alumni |website=goarmy.com |access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also on the school's [[track &amp; field]] team, where he ran the [[100 meters]] in 10.92 seconds and the [[200 meters]] in 22.24 seconds. He was also a member of the [[4 x 100 metres relay|4 × 100 m relay]] (41.41 s) squad.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.trackingfootball.com/players/patrick-peterson-5398/ Patrick Peterson | Louisiana State | Cardinals CB/KR]. Trackingfootball.com. Retrieved on November 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recruiting===
A consensus five-star prospect by all major [[Recruiting (college athletics)|recruiting]] services, Peterson was rated as the nation's fifth best overall player by [[Rivals.com]] and No. 8 by ''[[ESPN]]''. Prior to his senior season, he verbally committed to play for the [[University of Miami]], but continued to look at other schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Ely's Johnson: UM's for me |newspaper=South Florida Sun-Sentinel |date=April 5, 2007 |last=Kelly |first=Omar }}&lt;/ref&gt; By November 2007, Peterson had reopened his recruiting process and acknowledged interest in [[University of Georgia|Georgia]], [[University of Southern California|USC]], [[University of Florida|Florida]], and LSU.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://florida.scout.com/2/698515.html |title=Johnson Looking at Four Schools |last=Higdon |first=Jason |date=November 5, 2007 |work=Scout.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later dropped Georgia and USC from his list and added [[Florida State University|Florida State]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/preps/2008-01-04-seniors-colleges_N.htm |title=Seniors set to name college picks at U.S. Army All-American Bowl |date=January 5, 2008 |first=Jim |last=Halley |work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; but eventually announced his decision to attend LSU at the U.S. Army All-American Bowl.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Ely's Johnson selects LSU |newspaper=Miami Herald |date=January 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==College career==
Peterson attended [[Louisiana State University]], where he played for coach [[Les Miles]]'s [[LSU Tigers football]] team from 2008 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/patrick-peterson-1.html |title=Patrick Peterson College Stats |website=College Football at Sports-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freshman year===
One of the most decorated high school players to ever attend LSU, Peterson played 13 games as a [[true freshman]]. On November 8, against SEC West rival Alabama, he had his first collegiate interception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/boxscores/2008-11-08-louisiana-state.html |title=Alabama at Louisiana State Box Score, November 8, 2008 |website=College Football at Sports-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started the final four games of season, including the [[2008 Chick-fil-A Bowl|Chick-fil-A Bowl]] win over [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/boxscores/2008-12-31-georgia-tech.html |title=Chick-fil-A Bowl - LSU at Georgia Tech Box Score, December 31, 2008 |website=College Football at Sports-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peterson finished the season with 41 tackles, one interception, and three pass breakups, while also adding a forced fumble and a quarterback hurry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/patrick-peterson-1/gamelog/2008/ |title=Patrick Peterson 2008 Game Log |website=College Football at Sports-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sophomore year===
In his sophomore season, Peterson emerged as one of the top defensive backs in the [[Southeastern Conference]]. On September 26, against Mississippi State, he had a 37-yard interception return for a touchdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/boxscores/2009-09-26-mississippi-state.html |title=LSU at Mississippi State Box Score, September 26, 2009 |website=College Football at Sports-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a game against standout wide receiver [[A. J. Green]] of [[University of Georgia Bulldogs|Georgia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://jacksonville.com/sports/college/georgia-bulldogs/2010-09-29/story/georgia-receiver-aj-green-says-he-lost-sleep-over |title=Georgia receiver A.J. Green says he lost sleep over suspension |newspaper=The Florida Times-Union |date=September 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peterson was able to hold Green to just four catches.&lt;ref name="lsusports1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Football |url=http://www.lsusports.net/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=5200&amp;ATCLID=1382573 |title=Patrick Peterson Bio – LSUsports.net – The Official Web Site of LSU Tigers Athletics |publisher=LSUsports.net |date= |accessdate=October 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/boxscores/2009-10-03-georgia.html |title=LSU at Georgia Box Score, October 3, 2009 |website=College Football at Sports-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid-season, Peterson tied for fourth in the league with seven passes defended, and was named the SEC's "Most Improved Player" by ESPN's Chris Low.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/sec/post/_/id/4944/a-few-more-midseason-awards-in-the-sec |title=A few more mid-season awards in the SEC |date=October 22, 2009 |work=ESPN |last=Low |first=Chris }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another highly anticipated match-up occurred when Peterson went against [[Julio Jones]] of [[University of Alabama football|Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nola.com/lsu/index.ssf/2009/11/lsu_cornerback_patrick_peterso_1.html |title=LSU cornerback Patrick Peterson will try to stop Alabama's Julio Jones |newspaper=The Times-Picayune |first=James |last=Varney |date=November 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peterson's LSU Tigers were ranked 9th in the country and traveled to face [[Nick Saban]] and the #1 ranked Crimson Tide. The Tigers were down by six points late in the fourth quarter when Peterson stepped in front of a pass from [[Greg McElroy]] to Julio Jones for what seemed like an interception. Multiple [[CBS]] camera angles showed that Peterson was able to get at least one foot in bounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scoresreport.com/2009/11/09/screenshots-of-patrick-pattersons-interception/ |title=Screenshots of Patrick Peterson’s interception |first=John |last=Paulsen |date=November 9, 2009 |work=The Scores Report }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even after review, the SEC officiating crew called the pass incomplete, saying that Peterson was not able to get any foot in bounds. Alabama would go on to kick a field goal on that drive and won 24–15. The missed interception call quickly became infamous and was debated by many media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/boxscores/2009-11-07-alabama.html |title=LSU at Alabama Box Score, November 7, 2009 |website=College Football at Sports-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/andy_staples/11/07/lsu.alabama/index.html |title=LSU loss marred by missed-INT call - Andy Staples - SI.com |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=November 7, 2009 |accessdate=October 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peterson finished 2009 with 52 tackles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/patrick-peterson-1/gamelog/2009/ |title=Patrick Peterson 2009 Game Log |website=College Football at Sports-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 43 solo tackles were second on the team behind linebacker [[Kelvin Sheppard]]. Peterson returned an interception for a touchdown against [[Mississippi State Bulldogs football|Mississippi State]], and he returned a blocked field goal against [[Ole Miss Rebels football|Ole Miss]] for a touchdown. He was also named a 2009 Second-Team All-American by ''[[The Sporting News]]'', a 2009 First-Team All-SEC performer by ESPN, and a 2009 Second-Team All-SEC performer by the AP.&lt;ref name="lsusports1"/&gt;

===Junior year===
Peterson was named to the preseason watch lists for the [[Nagurski Award]], the [[Thorpe Award]], the [[Ronnie Lott Award]], the [[Walter Camp Award]], and the [[Chuck Bednarik Award]]. It was announced during the summer of 2010 that Peterson would begin returning punts and kickoffs due to his size, speed, and athleticism. With this added dimension to his game, and his dominance as a cornerback, Peterson began being mentioned as a [[dark horse]] for the 2010 Heisman Trophy award, presented to the best college football player every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://promo.espn.go.com/espn/contests/nissan/heisman/voteHeisman |title=Heisman Vote 2010 – presented by Nissan |work=ESPN |accessdate=September 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only one defensive player has ever won the Heisman Trophy, [[Charles Woodson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-20106733.html |title=University of Michigan's Charles Woodson named Heisman Trophy winner. (first defensive player to win)(Brief Article) – Jet &amp;#124; HighBeam Research – FREE trial |publisher=Highbeam.com |date=December 29, 1997 |accessdate=October 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peterson began his Heisman campaign against [[University of North Carolina Tar Heels|North Carolina]] in the 2010 Chick-fil-A Kickoff. The Tigers won 30–24 and Peterson was terrific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.neworleans.com/sports/lsu/467939-shepard-peterson-give-lsu-win-over-unc-.html |work=LSU News |title=Shepard, Peterson Give LSU Win Over UNC |date=September 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his debut as a returner, Peterson had a school-record 257 yards returning punts and kickoffs, 244 yards coming in the first half. He returned a punt 87 yards for a touchdown and consistently gave the Tiger's offense good field position. His 257-yard performance ranks second all-time in the SEC behind [[Mississippi State Bulldogs football|Mississippi State's]] Nick Turner and his 266-yard performance.

In week three of the 2010 season, the 2–0 Tigers hosted 1–1 Mississippi State for LSU's first home game of the year.

Peterson entertained the home crowd again in week four against Top-25 foe [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia]]. With the game tied 0–0 early in the first quarter, West Virginia went to attempt a mid-range field goal and Peterson was able to leap from behind the line of scrimmage and block the kick. The Tiger defense forced West Virginia to punt later in the half. Peterson fielded the punt on his own 40-yard line and raced 60-yards up the middle of the field for a touchdown and a 17–0 LSU lead. Peterson struck the Heisman pose in the North end zone of [[Tiger Stadium (LSU)|Tiger Stadium]], drawing a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. Peterson was almost single-handedly responsible for 10 points in the game that ended with LSU winning 20–14.

'''Paul Nabor''' (26 January 1928 – 22 October 2014), born '''Alfonso Palacio''', was a [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]] singer and musician from [[Punta Gorda, Belize|Punta Gorda]], [[Belize]].&lt;ref name="frontline"&gt;{{cite web|title=Priest and Poet: Paul Nabor|url=https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/belize/nabor.html|work=Belize – The Exile's Song|publisher=PBS Frontline|accessdate=1 June 2013|date=January 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040123000856/http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/belize/nabor.html|archivedate=23 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is often credited with popularizing [[Paranda (music)|paranda]], a style of traditional [[Garifuna music]], and is considered to have been one of the most talented musicians of the genre.&lt;ref name=Cayetano&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cayetano|first1=Isani|title=Paranda King Paul Nabor Passes|url=http://edition.channel5belize.com/archives/105391|accessdate=25 October 2014|work=News 5|publisher=Great Belize Television|date=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Nabor was born on 26 January 1928 (some sources say 1930). Although official sources list his place of birth as [[Dangriga|Stann Creek Town]] (now Dangriga), Nabor told ''[[Amandala]]'' in 2009 that he was born in Punta Gorda, where he was a lifelong resident. Nabor began singing professionally at 18.&lt;ref name="amandala"&gt;Ramos, Adele. [http://amandala.com.bz/news/legendary-garifuna-parandero-paul-nabor-passes-86/ "Legendary Garifuna parandero, Paul Nabor, passes at 86"]. ''[[Amandala]]'', 24 October 2014. (accessed 22 May 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

In Belize, Nabor's best known song was "Naguya Nei," which he wrote in memory of his deceased sister. Fluent in [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Garifuna language|Garifuna]], Nabor was a popular entertainer throughout Central America.&lt;ref name="amandala" /&gt;

Nabor performed on [[Andy Palacio]]'s final album, ''Wátina'', released in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bordeauxsalsa.com/index.php?theme=MUSIQUE&amp;album=Watina&amp;artiste=Andy%20Palacio&amp;genre=tropical Andy Palacio: ''Watina'' (2007)] at Bordeaux Salsa.&lt;/ref&gt; Nabor's music is also included on the showcase album ''[[Paranda (album)|Paranda]]'' on [[Stonetree Records]].&lt;ref name="frontline"/&gt; He retired from performing full-time in 2009, but played occasionally until 2013.&lt;ref name="amandala" /&gt;

==Honours==

On a 2004 visit to [[Tegucigalpa]], [[Honduras]], he was declared a distinguished guest of the city. Nabor was visiting Tegucigalpa for the Honduran release of ''Garifuna Soul'', an album by fellow paranda musician, [[Aurelio Martinez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Belizean Parandero Receives Award As Hondurans Get Garifuna Soul|url=http://www.stonetreerecords.com/news/2004_paul_nabor_awarded.php|publisher=Stonetree Records|accessdate=1 June 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717095944/http://www.stonetreerecords.com/news/2004_paul_nabor_awarded.php|archivedate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

On 22 October 2014, Nabor died at Punta Gorda Hospital, following a [[stroke]] the week before.&lt;ref name=Cayetano/&gt; He is buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Punta Gorda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ali|first1=Marion|title=Paul Nabor laid to rest at the Mount Olivet Cemetery in Punta Gorda|url=http://www.reporter.bz/general/paul-nabor-laid-to-rest-at-the-mount-olivet-cemetery-in-punta-gorda/|accessdate=2 November 2014|work=The Reporter|date=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard William Thomas Lees-Jones''' (1891–1978) was a British [[philatelist]] who signed the [[Roll of Distinguished Philatelists]] in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.abps.org.uk/Awards/Roll_of_Distinguished_Philatelists/RDP_Background_20111231_LR.pdf Background notes on The Roll of Distinguished Philatelists September 2011]'', Roll of Distinguished Philatelists Trust, London, 2011.

Lees-Jones was an expert on the stamps of Canada and plated the early issues, particularly the 12½c of 1859. In 1936 he gave to the [[Royal Philatelic Society London]] a collection of Canada 1897-1936 in mint blocks of four with plate numbers. In 1951 he won that society's [[Tilleard Medal]] for his display of Papermakers' Watermarks. That collection was auctioned by HR Harmer Ltd in 1952. His Canadian stamps were shown, ''hors concours'', at the [[London International Stamp Exhibition 1960]]. He was President of the Canadian Philatelic Society.&lt;ref name=abps/&gt;

'''Rudolf Vilem Perina''' ({{lang-cs|Rudolf Vilém Peřina}}) (January 3, 1945 – June 14, 2018) was an American [[diplomat]] who specialized for more than three decades in European [[East-West relations]] during and after the [[Cold War]], and on the [[Dayton Accords]] following the dissolution of the [[Former Republic of Yugoslavia]]. This includes working the [[Moscow Summit (1988)|1988 Moscow summit meeting]] between [[President Reagan]] and [[President of the Soviet Union|President]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], during the former's first visit to the [[USSR]]. He also served as [[ambassador]] to the [[Republic of Moldova]], U.S. Special Negotiator for Eurasian Conflicts in the [[former Soviet Union]] (an ambassador-level position), Deputy Assistant Secretary for European and Canadian Affairs in the [[State Department]], director of European and Soviet Affairs for the [[U.S. National Security Council]], and was on the policy planning staff of the State Department under [[Colin Powell]] before and after the [[invasion of Iraq]].

Following his retirement from the [[foreign service]], Perina served as [[Chargé d’Affaires]] at [[U.S. embassies]] including those in [[Chisinau]], [[Moldova]] (2006), [[Yerevan]], [[Armenia]] (2007), [[Reykjavik]] (2010), [[Prague]] (2013), and [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]] (2015).

==Early life and family==

Perina was born on January 3, 1945 in the [[town]] of [[Tábor]] in what is today the [[Czech Republic]]. His father's family owned a large [[lumbermill]] serving [[Central Europe]]. His mother's family was subject to [[Nazi]] [[reprisal]]s during [[World War II]], including the execution of his grandfather and great uncle on June 10, 1942. The family members were executed in a coordinated [[purge]] of Czech nationalists and [[public figure]]s that culminated in the [[razing]] of the town of [[Lidice]].

Perina and his parents fled [[Czechoslovakia]] following the [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état|1948 Communist takeover of the government]]. Rudolf's mother paid a [[Croat]] border smuggler to transport her son in January 1950 to the border into [[Austria]] and eventually to [[Zurich]] where his father had escaped. The family lived as [[refugee]]s in [[Switzerland]] and [[Morocco]] before [[immigrating]] to the [[United States]] via [[Le Havre, France]] in 1951.

He grew up speaking [[Czech language|Czech]] at home. In 1955, the family moved to [[Cleveland]] and Perina obtained [[US citizenship]] the following year.&lt;ref name=refTrain/&gt;

==Education==
After the family moved to [[Seattle]], Perina attended [[Franklin High School (Seattle)|Franklin High School]] where he made [[valedictorian]] in 1963. He chose the [[University of Chicago]] as it offered him full tuition with a [[stipend]].&lt;ref name=refTrain/&gt; He earned his [[B.A.]] degree in [[history]] there in 1967 and did his graduate studies at [[Columbia University]] where he received his [[M.A.]] and [[Ph.D.]] degrees in [[European history]], with the idea of going into academia.&lt;ref name=Washdip/&gt; While studying in [[New York City|New York]], he was hired by a [[film production]] company to consult and interpret for the filming of a [[documentary]] about the [[Prague Spring|1968 reform movement in Czechoslovakia]] known as the “Prague Spring.” This led to the topic of his Ph.D [[dissertation]]: “Intellectuals and Political Change in Czechoslovakia: A History of Literarni noviny and its Contributors, 1952-1969.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Intellectuals_and_Political_Change_in_Cz.html?id=UZhFswEACAAJ|title=Intellectuals and Political Change in Czechoslovakia: A History of Literární Noviny and Its Contributors, 1952-1969|first=Rudolf Vilem|last=Perina|date=29 June 1980|publisher=University Microfilms|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had also earned a Foreign Area Fellowhip to research his dissertation at the library of [[Radio Free Europe]] for two years.

Perina was at Columbia during the 1968 [[student protest]]s. While supportive of the US [[civil rights movement]] and against the [[Vietnam War]], he maintained a [[moderate]] political position, saying later "I became suspicious of all political extremism and radicalism, whether right-wing or left-wing. It is a position I have held all of my life."&lt;ref name=refTrain/&gt;

==Career==

Returning from Europe to finish his dissertation, Perina found that there were few academic jobs available in the U.S. He saw an ad for the [[foreign service exam]] and encouraged by the example of foreign-born [[Henry Kissinger]], he took it and passed. Delighted to find that it paid better than any academic job, he started in November 1974, his first posting at the U.S. Embassy in [[Ottawa, Canada]] through 1976 during which time both of his daughters were born.

At this post, Perina gave [[Russian people|Russian]] author [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]] his first [[US visa]], whereby he communicated to him in [[German language|German]]. (Already fluent in [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[French language|French]], Perina became fluent in [[Russian language|Russian]] later.) He found that the author of ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]'' and other works "took the process more seriously than almost any other applicant" he had processed up to that time. In reflecting on Solzhenitsyn's conscientiousness later, Perina concluded that "if you spend your life fighting a bureaucracy, your first thought is to not make a mistake in an official document that the bureaucracy can use against you."

At Ottawa, Perina also had responsibilities in the [[Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe| Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)]] whose [[Helsinki Final Act]] was signed by the 35 participating states in the summer of 1975.&lt;ref name=refTrain/&gt;

===Moscow===
He was then posted to [[Moscow]], and was there during the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. Upon witnessing the confrontation with 1st Deputy Foreign Minister [[Georgy Korniyenko]], he said later he was "shown for the first time how unashamedly people can lie in diplomacy." The US response to the invasion was tough, and included suspending exchanges, diplomatic social events, wheat sales, and eventually boycotting the [[Moscow Olympics]], bringing [[Africa]], the [[Middle East]], [[Latin America]], and part of [[Eastern Europe]] along as well. Of the time, Perina has said, "our relations with the Soviets there were very competitive. We were always watching what they did, and they watched us."

Although compared to average Soviet citizen, he lived better, Perina has described that life in the Soviet capital "could be difficult." During the harsh winters, he had to remove his [[car battery]] each night to prevent its freezing. The Perinas also saw firsthand the [[psychological warfare]] the [[KGB]] enacted on US embassy personnel, Perina describing his wife Ethel's coat disappearing for several months then reappearing in their closet.&lt;ref name=refTrain/&gt;

===West Berlin===
He then started to work at the U.S. Mission in [[West Berlin]] in 1981. The US saw [[East Berlin]] differently from the [[GDR]]. Considered a Soviet zone, the Americans maintained another embassy in East Berlin, and the mission in West Berlin avoided dealing with the East Germans by going to the Soviets for things related to them. (The Soviets on the other hand respected the city as part of the GDR and the capital of East Germany.) Perina also described that in Berlin in 1981 it was so easy for the four occupying powers, which included the [[UK]] and [[France]], plus East and West Germany, to [[spy]] on each other being in such close proximities that "the city with more espionage going on per square mile than any other city in Europe." He said that "There was alot of [[eavesdropping]]."

As liaison with the Soviets on Russian matters, Perina said that "Nobody seriously thought there was going to be a World War III or an invasion of Berlin by the Warsaw Pact." The diplomat also never got the sense things were loosening up in the USSR. Although he personally did not know whether the [[Strategic Defense Initiative|Strategic Defense Initiative system (SDIs)]] would even work, he understood that the Soviets were threatened by the possibility: He said, "They realized their strength as a world power came from possession of nuclear weapons, and not from their [[GDP]] or anything else." (There was talk too in Germany about [[NATO]] deployment of immediate range nuclear missiles.)

Perina served as [[interpreter]] between ambassadors [[Arthur Burns]] and [[Peter Abrassimov|Piotr Abrassimov]], then [[Vyacheslav Kochemasov]] during their twice yearly social lunches. There was bureaucratic protocol too that had to be observed whenever the West German president came to Berlin—the US, French, and British embassies had to greet him formally—which Perina described as a "real nuisance." He also witnessed the tensions in [[Poland]]: The country was moving toward [[martial law]], and Perina describes that by the end of his time there, he and his colleagues were witnessing six or seven Polish [[Aircraft hijacking|plane hijacking]] to West Berlin a year. He also saw the rivalry between the two Germanies, but felt the real threat at the time was from [[radical group]]s like the [[Baader-Meinhof gang]].&lt;ref name=refTrain/&gt;

{{quotebox|width=450px|align=right|1=Russia was ... a basketcase. The standard of living had declined even from Soviet times. The Russian people had made enormous sacrifices to get rid of Communism and were really hoping for help and partnership with the West. The NATO expansion made them think that the reverse was happening--that their weakness was being exploited. And Russian nationalists and demagogues came forward to take advantage of this perception.— Rudolf V. Perina&lt;ref name=refTrain/&gt;}}

===Brussels &amp; the 1988 Moscow Summit===
Perina then worked at the U.S. Mission to NATO in [[Brussels]] from 1985, as political officer and deputy US representative to the organization's political committee. The group was handling three simultaneous negotiations, on [[START I#Negotiations|Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START)]], [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty|Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF)]], and SDIs for a number of visits by [[President Reagan]] to the [[North Atlantic Council]], according to Perina, "the most comprehensive arms control discussion between the US and the Soviet Union." The diplomat's impression of NATO was that it was an American-run organization, with the allies all deferring to the US.

From 1987 to 1989, Perina was director for European and Soviet Affairs on the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] staff: prior to his arrival there had been a purge from the [[Iran Contra scandal]]. He was brought in by [[Colin Powell]] who'd been hired by new National Security Council Advisor [[Frank Carlucci]] who ran the department differently, and better, in Perina's opinion. Perina had the Soviet portfolio, which included working on Reagan's [[Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!|"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall" speech]]. Yet even with this, the Czech-American had no suspicion that the empire was on the verge of collapse, saying "it was not even part of any discussion.... We were all watching the top, the Kremlin .... [W]e did not pay enough attention to the internal situation and particularly to the nationality issues." In preparation for the 1988 meeting between the two world leaders, Perina asked the [[CIA]] to make a film for Reagan about the Moscow sites the president would be visiting and organized a lunch for him with Soviet experts in the US: It would be Reagan's first visit to the USSR.

Perina attended the [[Moscow Summit (1988)|1988 Moscow summit meeting]] between Presidents Reagan and [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]], the third of only four total people; he later described the tension between the two principals being rooted in different negotiating styles: The Soviet's being [[deductive]] and the American's [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]]. And although he found the American president very gracious, Perina found the leader of the USSR the more important historical figure "among the most important of our time." He described the former Hollywood actor as having "good instincts" but that he "clearly did not have the grasp of substance that Gorbachev had." Perina believed the summit was significant symbolically, that it influenced Reagan, the Russian people's opinion on Reagan, and changed the dynamics of the US-Russia relationship.

Perina was also in charge of the NSC's Eastern European portfolio and visited [[Romania]] under [[Nikolai Ceausescu]]. He described it as a "desperate place" where there was no heat or electricity, and hardly any food in its stores. He said he could see clearly "the fear everyone so clearly had in their eyes," even those around the Rleader himself. Perina left the NSC in spring 1989 when [[George H. W. Bush|President Bush]] and [[Brent Scowcroft]] instituted a complete shift in personnel for political reasons.&lt;ref name=refTrain/&gt;

===Vienna, Belgrade &amp; the Dayton Accord===
From 1989 to 1992, Perina was deputy chairman of the U.S. Delegation to the [[Vienna]] negotiations on [[Vienna Document|Confidence and Security Building Measures in Europe (CSBM)]], held under auspices of the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe|Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)]].

From 1993 to 1996, he was Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]] with the title of Charge d’Affaires and worked with a downsized staff. The country was under [[UN]] [[Economic sanctions|sanctions]], and extreme [[inflation]] had forced the country to depend on the [[black market]]. Embassy matters were all handled on a [[cash]] basis: Perina describes having tens of thousands of dollars driven in from [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]] in an unguarded car so as not to arouse suspicion from the gangs who then ruled the streets.

Perina worked with [[Richard Holbrooke]] as liaison to [[Serbian President]] [[Slobodan Milosevic]] during the negotiations to end the [[Yugoslav Wars|Yugoslav conflict]]. (Some considered Holbrooke's work to have merited the Nobel Peace Prize later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newsweek.com/holbrooke-trenches-69117|title=World: Holbrooke in the Trenches|date=14 December 2010|last=Moreau|first=Ron}}&lt;/ref&gt;) They had a dozen meetings with the Serbian ruler with others around, then met him one on one because they found him more engaging in that capacity. Perina saw a "genuine lack of compassion that was truly frightening" and said that this feeling extended to his treatment of his countrymen, the Serbs. Perina also participated in the talks held in [[Dayton, Ohio]], to which he credits Milosevic's assent, although mostly for self-serving purposes: The leader thought he would gain respectability in the international community and sanctions would be lifted. Perina also met with [[Ibrahim Rugova]], the elected president of the [[Republic of Kosovo]], whom along with [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]'s [[Kiro Gligorov]] Perina found to be the most impressive leaders in the former Yugoslavia.

{{quotebox|width=450px|align=right|1=Milosevic could agree to the terms of the Dayton Agreement because he was not really a Serb nationalist. He did not care that much about Serbs. He cared about Milosevic. He thought that by helping to conclude an agreement at Dayton his past actions would be forgotten and he would gain legitimacy and respect. But he was wrong. Kosovo was still outstanding, and it would prove to be his downfall.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;— Rudolf V. Perina&lt;ref name=refTrain/&gt;}}

Perina served as Senior Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govexec.com/federal-news/1998/04/comings-and-goings/2731/|last=Friel|first=Brian|title=Comings and Goings|publisher=GovExec.com|date=29 April 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1996-97 the majority of his time was spent helping to execute the Dayton Accords from [[Washington DC]] while [[John Kornblum]] travelled to implement them. This included the outer wall of sanctions that enraged the Serbs and did not satisfy [[Kosovar Albanian]]s (They would form the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]].) As the former USSR was now handled by the Office of [[Newly Independent States|Newly Independent States (NIS)]] and not the European bureau, the other third of Perina's time was spent on helping to expand NATO, which he said he felt [[ambivalence]] towards: The powerful organization did not help integrate the Russians into Europe and damaged the US's relationship to Russia. He has said "I fear the way we handled revanchism made it a self-fulfulling prophecy." He saw and was shocked by [[Sarajevo]] at the end of the war, which described as "miles and miles of just rubble." Perina has said European and Canadian Affairs was one of his least favorite because it was so bureaucratic and based in the US capital.&lt;ref name=refTrain/&gt;

===Moldova ===
Perina was assigned and confirmed ambassadorship to the Republic of Moldova, serving from 1998 to 2001. He studied [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and reviewed his Russian before starting and found the former Soviet republic "a much more pleasant place" than he had imagined: "The people were extremely friendly and hospitable, and the country was a very interesting place to work." His job was to help it develop into a successful, [[autonomous]] nation. It was one of the earliest to [[privatize]] land, helped by a major [[USAID]] project that completed under Perina: The US gave&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.moldova.org/en/petr-lucinschis-meeting-with-rudolf-perina-16814-eng/|title=Petr Lucinschi’s meeting with Rudolf Perina|publisher=Moldova.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; over $50 million in assistance, the third highest amount given to a former Soviet republic, because of its cooperation and its efforts at [[reform]]. Several hundred Moldovans were sent to the US every year on [[exchange program]]s; Perina was also particularly proud of the [[Peace Corps]] contingent he saw there.

Moldava was a main source of the trafficking of women from the former Soviet Union: Many young women were lured into the trade with promises of jobs as [[nannies]] and waitresses in Western Europe, [[the Balkans]] and the [[Middle East]]. The embassy tried to combat this with educational programs and financing a documentary film with victim testimonies that were shown in schools, on billboards and on national TV.

He was in Moldova during the [[Transnistria|Transnistrian conflict]], and though the US was not one of the three official mediators (those being Russia, the [[Ukraine]], and the OSCE), the heads of the OSCE mission were American because the Moldovan government wanted to counterbalance their former rulers. Regardless, Perina met with Moldovan Presidents [[Petru Lucinschi]] then [[Vladimir Voronin]] on policy toward Transnistria, even initiating dialogue with the breakaway eastern region's so-called president, [[Igor Smirnov]].

Perina describes these half dozen talks with Smirnov as disheartening. This is because the disputed region had become a staging area for [[smuggling]] operations that avoided taxes and [[customs duties]]. [[People of Ukraine|Ukrainians]] and Moldavans alike profited off the illegal importation of cigarettes, liquor, and "many other commodities" that hurt the republic in lost [[tax revenue]]. Another problem was the 40,000 tons of aging Soviet [[ammunition]] stored at Cosbasna base in Transnistria: The US was a major contributor of several million dollars to a voluntary OSCE fund to aid in arms withdrawal and though there was a limited destruction of tanks and a half trainload of weapons and ammunition, Russian troops and old but still dangerous armaments were kept in the region for political leverage. The economic conflict of the region was also rooted in a lot of Moldava's industry being located in Transnistria,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/05/05/the-countertraffickers|title=The Countertraffickers: Rescuing the victims of the global sex trade|last=Finnegan|first=William|date=5 May 2008|publisher=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt; planned by [[Stalin]].&lt;ref name=refTrain/&gt;

=== Nagorno-Karabakh &amp; three other former Soviet territories with conflicts===
Perina became the U.S. Special Negotiator for Nagorno-Karabakh and Eurasian Conflicts from 2001, flying out on September 23 when the US airports were reopened after [[9/11]]. The ambassador-level job was Washington D.C.-based but involved a great deal of travel: He was the lead U.S. representative to international efforts to resolve four conflicts in territories of the former Soviet Union: Transnistria, [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict|Nagorno-Karabakh]], [[Abkhaz–Georgian conflict|Abkhazia]], and [[South Ossetia]] ([[Chechnya]] was the fifth former territory that also had strife but Russia did not let outside influence on it).

'''The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict''' had roots in the 1990s war between Armenia and [[Azerbaijan]]: Perina called it a "true indigenous conflict" between the two countries. The OSCE and its specially created [[Minsk Group]] handled the crisis, with many proposals by the latter rejected by both nations, represented by Presidents [[Robert Kocharyan|Kocharyan]] and [[Heydar Aliyev|Aliyev]] respectively, over the years. The first meeting of what came to be known as the [[Prague Process (Armenian–Azerbaijani negotiations)|Prague Process]] took place outside the capital at Stirin Palace in mid-May 2002, a location that Perina helped arranged for. During the US diplomat's tenure through 2004, it remained a stalemated conflict lacking [[peacekeeping]] troops to maintain the separation between the sides with a few soldiers on both sides killed monthly by [[sniper]] fire. Perina
's 2002 idea of a [[referendum]] became the major consideration by 2004: The idea being that residents of Nagorno-Karabakh before hostilities would be able to vote, using lists from the Soviet era. With the intransigence of the two sides, in the end, the conflict was frozen; Perina said of it "the most you can hope for is stabilizing this conflict rather than really resolving it."

{{quotebox|width=450px|align=right|1=Sometimes freezing a conflict under agreed terms can be a way of resolving it, for all practical purposes.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;— Rudolf V. Perina&lt;ref name=refTrain/&gt;}}

The Abkhaz were an ethnic minority who participating in the ethnic cleansing of several hundred thousand Georgians in the 1990s with the help of Russians and Chechens. There were 200,000 refugees that resulted. In Perina's view, "The hatred between [the two groups] was the worst I had ever seen in either the Balkans of the Caucauses" calling it "even greater than that between the Serbs and the Albanians." The negotiating process over '''Abkhazia''' stalled but its very existence reduced pressure on the Georgian side for military action against it.

'''The hostility in South Ossetia''' was a result of the succession by an ethnic group in Georgia that didn't want to be a part of an independent Georgia, didn't accept its [[sovereignty]], and was protected in this by Russia. The disaccord, per Perina, nevertheless the most promising of the conflicts as the "hatred was not as deep." He felt that most of the population would have welcomed a settlement. The EU was interested in aiding but the Russians blocked them.

Perina kept working on the '''Transnistria''' in [[ex-officio]] capacity as the US was not one of the designated mediators. A mandate to resolve this conflict would have institutionalized Russia's presence in Moldava. Deputy Prime Minister of the [[Russian federation]] [[Dmitry Kozak]] attempted to head off the involvement of other countries by arranging for their own settlement for Vladmir Voronin to sign, giving Transnistria de facto veto power over big Moldavan policy decisions. When the Moldavans got wind of the memorandum, 50,000 demonstrated in its capital. There was also Georgia's [[Rose Revolution]], which ousted President Shevardnadze out, and Veronin was successfully talked out of signing.

===Policy planning for the State Department===
From 2004 to 2006, Perina served as deputy director of the State Department's Policy Planning staff. He worked under both Colin Powell then [[Condi Rice]], and the latter focussed only on [[Iraq]] and the Middle East. Perina found it bizarre that within the State Department, there was little debate on the decision to invade the former. (There were also no experts on the Muslim world in the department.) "The tipping point came imperceptibly, and suddenly everyone just assumed we would invade. The Afghanistan invasion ... appeared to have been successful." He witnessed the policy tensions between [[Donald Rumsfeld]] of the [[Defense Department]] and Powell on the issue of responsibility for the administration of Iraq. As no one was prepared to do it, and the Office of Reconstruction and Stabilization was created in the State Department which would have a coordinator and a small staff of about a dozen who would come up with action plans and lists of experts including those outside of government to deal with [[humanitarian assistance]], training police, instituting [[civil authority]], and the like.

Under Powell, Perina went to sub-Saharan Africa with an expert to start policy consultation with the [[African Union]]. He witnessed the rapid radicalization of Muslim communities on the [[Africa|continent]] by means of the [[madrassa]]s staffed by Middle Eastern teachers. The Bush administration faulted the foreign service for this, refusing to see it connected to the invasion of Iraq. Powell, whom Perina called "probably the best Secretary I have worked for" was also the first major leader to name what was happening in [[Darfur]] as [[genocide]], calling for a peacekeeping force but no country was up to it. Perina credits humanitarian organizations for relief supplies and food.

Perina officially retired on April 30, 2006, after 32 years in the foreign service.&lt;ref name=refTrain/&gt;

=== Armenia, Iceland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia ===
In 2007 Perina became the [[Chargé d’Affaires]] at [[U.S. embassies]] for [[Armenia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yandunts.blogspot.com/2007/07/amb-perina-to-become-charge-in-armenia.html|title=Amb.

He was the Scarff [[Visiting Professor]] of [[International Relations]] at [[Lawrence University]]  in [[Appleton, Wisconsin]] in fall 2010&lt;ref name=Washdip/&gt; and was on the Council of Advisors of the [[Wende Museum]], a research institute and [[archive]] of the Cold War located in [[Culver City, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wendemuseum.org/about-us/people|title=People|website=Wende Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

He met his [[wife]], Ethel Ott Hetherington, at the 1968 Columbia student protests, and they married in [[Salzburg]], [[Austria]] on May 26, 1972. Ethel taught at the [[International School of Belgrade]] while he was Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy there in the '90s. He was fluent in four languages: English, Czech, Russian, and French and knew Romanian. They have two daughters, Kaja&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/02/fashion/weddings/kaja-perina-and-nando-pelusi.html|title=Weddings" Kaja Perina and Nando Pelusi|date=2 October 2005|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Alexandra,&lt;ref name=refTrain/&gt; and four grandchildren and lived in the [[Washington D.C.]] area&lt;ref name=Washdip&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washdiplomat.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=12288&amp;Itemid=192|title=Charge d'Affaires Rudolf Perina|first=|last=bwm-admin|website=washdiplomat.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; until his death on June 14, 2018.

'''Samuel Sewall''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|uː|əl}}; March 28, 1652 – January 1, 1730) was a judge, businessman, and printer in the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], best known for his involvement in the [[Salem witch trials]],&lt;ref&gt;Starkey, Marion L. ''The Devil in Massachusetts''  1949  Doubleday Edition pp.261-2&lt;/ref&gt; for which he later apologized, and his essay ''The Selling of Joseph'' (1700), which criticized slavery.&lt;ref name="diaryandlife"&gt;{{cite book | title=The diary and life of Samuel Sewall | publisher=Bedford Books | author=Samuel Sewall; Melvin Yazawa | year=1998 | location=Boston | pages=1 | isbn=978-0-312-13394-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He served for many years as the chief justice of the [[Massachusetts Superior Court of Judicature]], the province's high court.

==Biography==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2015}}
Sewall was born in [[Bishopstoke]], [[Hampshire]], [[England]], on March 28, 1652, the great grandson of [[Henry Sewall|Henry]] and Jane ([[Template:Dummer family|Dummer]]) Sewall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Family of Dummer |last= Dummer|first=Michael |year= June 2005|edition= 7th|chapter=7: Stephen of Horton Heath - the Last Yeoman, and the Last Estate|publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=38|url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His father, son of the mayor of [[Coventry]], had come to the English North American [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in 1635, where he married Sewall's mother, and returned to England in the 1640s.&lt;ref name="Francis"&gt;{{cite book | title=Judge Sewall's Apology: The Salem Witch Trials and the Forming of a Conscience | publisher=Harper Perennial | author=Francis, Richard | year=2006 | location=London/New York | isbn=1-84115-677-9 | pages=3–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[English Restoration|restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] to the English throne, the Sewalls again crossed the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] in 1661, settling in [[Newbury, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis, pp. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt; It is there the young Samuel "Sam" grew up along the Parker River and Plum Island Sound.

[[File:Nehemiah Hobart poem 1712.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Poem by Nehemiah Hobart in Latin, printed by Samuel Sewall, Boston, 1712]]

Like other local boys he attended school at [[James Noyes House|the home]] of [[James Noyes]], whose cousin, Reverend [[Thomas Parker (minister)|Thomas Parker]], was the principal instructor.  From Parker, Sewall acquired a lifelong love of [[poetry|verse]], which he wrote in both [[English language|English]] and [[Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1667 Sewall entered [[Harvard College]], where his classmates included [[Edward Taylor]] and [[Daniel Gookin]], with whom he formed enduring friendships.  Sewall received his first degree, a BA, in 1671, and his MA in 1674.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, pp. 10-13&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1674 he served as librarian of Harvard for nine months, the second person to hold that post.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/librariansofharv00pottrich|title=The librarians of Harvard College 1667-1877|last=Potter|first=Alfred Claghorn|last2=Bolton|first2=Charles Knowles|date=1897|publisher=Cambridge, Mass., Library of Harvard University|others=University of California Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That year he began keeping a journal, which he maintained for most of his life; it is one of the major historical documents of the time.  In 1679 he became a member of the [[Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts|Military Company of Massachusetts]].

Sewall's involvement in the political affairs of the colony began when he became a [[freeman (Colonial)|freeman]] of the colony, giving him the right to vote.  In 1681 he was appointed the official printer of the colony; one of the first works he published was [[John Bunyan]]'s ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]''.  After John Hull died in 1683, Sewall was elected to replace him on the colony's council of assistants, a body that functioned both as the upper house of the legislature and as a court of appeals.  He also became a member of Harvard's Board of Overseers.

Sewall's oral examination for the MA was a public affair and was witnessed by Hannah Hull, daughter of colonial merchant and [[Massachusetts pound|mintmaster]] [[John Hull (merchant)|John Hull]].  She was apparently taken by the young man's charms, and pursued him; they were married in February 1676.  Her father, whose work as mintmaster had made him quite wealthy, gave the couple £500 in colonial currency as a wedding gift.  (Biographer Richard Francis notes that the weight of this amount of [[coin|specie]], {{convert|125|lb|kg}}, may have approximated the bride's weight, giving rise to [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s legend that the gift was her weight in coins.)&lt;ref&gt;Francis, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;  Sewall moved into his in-laws' mansion in Boston, and was soon involved in that family's business and political affairs. He and Hannah would have fourteen children before her death in 1717, although only a few survived to adulthood.

He also entered local politics, and was elevated to the position of assistant magistrate in the judiciary. In 1692 he was one of the nine judges appointed to the court of Oyer and Terminer in [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], charged with trying those from Salem Town and elsewhere who were accused of [[witchcraft]]. His diary recounts many of the more famous episodes of the trials, such as the agonizing death under torture of [[Giles Corey]], and reflects the growing public unease about the guilt of many of the accused.  Sewall's brother Stephen had meanwhile opened up his home to one of the initially afflicted children, [[Betty Parris]], daughter of Salem Village's minister, [[Samuel Parris]], and shortly afterward Betty's "afflictions" appear to have subsided.

Sewall was perhaps most remarkable among the justices involved in the trials in that he later regretted his role, going so far as to call for a public day of prayer, fasting, and reparations. Following the dissolution of the court, the Sewall family was blighted by what Sewall thought to be punishments from God.  In the five years after the Trials, two of Sewall's daughters and Hannah's mother died and Hannah gave birth to a stillborn child.  What convinced Sewall of his need for public repentance was a recitation of Matthew 12:7, "If ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless".&lt;ref&gt;Heather E. Jones, "Salem Witch Trials in History and Literature," Salem Witch Trials: Documentary Archive and Transcription Project, last modified 2001, accessed October 24, 2016, http://salem.lib.virginia.edu/people/sewall.html.&lt;/ref&gt;  Not only had Sewall's home life been shaken, but in the years after the Trials, the people of Massachusetts experienced setbacks and violence, notably the Navigation Acts, the declaration of the New England Dominion, and  King Philip's War.&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy, David S. "Between Hell and Plum Island: Samuel Sewall and the Legacy of the Witches, 1692-97." The New England Quarterly 70, no. 3 (1997): 355-67.&lt;/ref&gt;  He saw this as a sign not that witchcraft did not exist, but that he had ruled on insubstantial evidence.  He records in his diary that on 14 January 1697 he stood up in the meeting house he attended while his minister read out his confession of guilt.

In 1693 Sewall was appointed an associate justice of the [[Massachusetts Superior Court of Judicature|Superior Court of Judicature]], the province's high court, by Governor Sir [[William Phips]]. In 1717, he was appointed its chief justice by Governor [[Samuel Shute]].

Sewall died in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], on January 1, 1730, aged 77, and was interred in the family tomb at Boston's [[Granary Burying Ground]].

Sewall married three times. Hannah Hull, his first wife, died in 1717; two years later, in 1719, Sewall married Abigail (Melyen) Woodmansey Tilley, who died seven months later. In 1722, he married Mary (Shrimpton) Gibbs, who survived him.&lt;ref&gt;LaPlante, pp. 285–87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Graves|first= Eben W.|title= The Descendants of Henry Sewall (1576-1656) of Manchester and Coventry, England, and Newbury and Rowley, Massachusetts|edition=1st|year=2007|publisher=Newbury Street Press|location= Boston, Massachusetts|isbn= 978-0-88082-198-8|pages=89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; His nephew [[Stephen Sewall|Stephen]] also served as a Massachusetts chief justice, as did his great grandson [[Samuel Sewall (congressman)|Samuel]].  His sister Anne Sewall Longfellow (1662&amp;ndash;1706) was the great-great-great-grandmother of the poet [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hwlongfellow.org/pdf/hwl_ancestrychart.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views and writings==
Apart from his involvement in the Salem witch trials, Sewall was somewhat liberal in his views for the time. In ''The Selling of Joseph'' (1700), for instance, he came out strongly against [[slavery]], making him one of the earliest colonial [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]]. ''The Selling of Joseph'' was the earliest-recorded anti-slavery tract published in the future United States. In it, Sewell argued, "Liberty is in real value next unto Life: None ought to part with it themselves, or deprive others of it, but upon the most mature Consideration." He regarded "man-stealing as an atrocious crime which would introduce among the English settlers people who would remain forever restive and alien", but also believed that "There is such a disparity in their Conditions, Colour, Hair, that they can never embody with us, and grow up into orderly Families, to the Peopling of the Land." Although holding such [[Racial segregation|segregationist]] views, he maintained that "These [[Ethiopia]]ns, as black as they are; seeing they are the Sons and Daughters of the First [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]], the Brethren and Sisters of the Last ADAM [meaning [[Jesus Christ]]], and the Offspring of God; They ought to be treated with a Respect agreeable."{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

His essay ''Talitha Cumi'', first published in 1725, refers to the "right of women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=LaPlante|first=Eve|title=Salem Witch Judge: The Life and Repentance of Samuel Sewall|edition=1st|year=2007|publisher=HarperOne|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-078661-8|pages=304–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[periwig]] became fashionable in New England, Sewall condemned the fashion vehemently, in contrast to [[Cotton Mather]], who saw no reason why a Puritan should not wear a wig. Sewall's ''Journal'', kept from 1673 to 1729, describes his life as a Puritan against the changing tide of colonial life, as the devoutly religious community of Massachusetts gradually adopted more secular attitudes and emerged as a liberal, cosmopolitan-minded community.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Early life==
Sanapia was born Mary Poafpybitty in spring 1895 to David Poafpybitty and Chappy Poafpybitty, both [[Comanche]], living near [[Fort Sill, Oklahoma]]. Although it has been written that she was born on May 20, 1895, she was uncertain of her actual birthdate so this date was adopted later on.&lt;ref name="McDaniel"/&gt; She was sixth of eleven children but the first girl to be born in her family. While she was young, her family struggled to make ends meet and lived in poverty, relying on rations from nearby Fort Sill.&lt;ref name="McDaniel"/&gt; She was raised by her maternal grandmother.&lt;ref name="Bataille &amp; Laurie" /&gt;

==Spiritual development==
[[File:Haliaeetus leucocephalus2.jpg|thumb|right|An eagle]]
Although Sanapia did not begin a career as a [[medicine woman]] until her mid-teens, from a very young age she received training from her mother and her maternal uncle, an [[Arapaho]] chief, both of whom were eagle doctors.&lt;ref name="Sonneborn"/&gt; Although her father, David, was a Christian and indifferent to Comanche spiritual practices, he did not interfere with the religious training of his daughter.&lt;ref name="McDaniel"/&gt; She attended [[Cache Creek Mission School]] in southern [[Oklahoma]] from the age of 7 until 14 and during the summer holidays would develop a knowledge of herbal medicines.&lt;ref name="McDaniel"/&gt;

Between the ages of 14 and 17 she received full-time training from her mother, uncle, and paternal grandfather to attain the knowledge, ethics, skills and the supernatural powers (''paha''&lt;ref name="Baer"/&gt;) to become a medicine woman.&lt;ref name="Sonneborn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bataille &amp; Laurie"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Bataille, M. Gretchen M., Laurie, Lisa|title= Native American Women|edition=2, Volume 1, Part 19|date= June 2001|pages= 269–270}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter, attaining supernatural powers, would be achieved by transferring power through the medium of the hands and mouth, using various methods such as hot coals into her hands, two eagle feathers inserted into her mouth and the egg of an eagle into her stomach.&lt;ref name="McDaniel"/&gt; The visionary aspects of the training were achieved through prolonged periods of solitary meditation and spiritual nurturing and intensive reiterating by her mother that evil spirits such as ghosts and demons would harm her, which terrified her.&lt;ref name="Sonneborn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mojo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mojomamma.com/sanapia.html|title=Sanapia|publisher=Mojomamma|accessdate=October 29, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714111225/http://mojomamma.com/sanapia.html|archivedate=July 14, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her uncle named her "Sanapia", which means "Memory Woman".&lt;ref name="Sonneborn"/&gt;

{{quotation|"I was sure scared then...almost got up and ran away. I was only a young girl at the time, you know. But, when I took them coals on my hand, inside and outside my hand I felt a chill, maybe. Oh, it was like chills in my hands. That has the meaning that power was in there... working in my hands. Felt like it would go up my arms even."&lt;ref name="Weigle"/&gt; -Sanapia on having hot coals inserted into hands as part of the training process.}}

==Marriages and breakdown==
After her training was completed, a marriage was arranged for her. It was an unhappy one; however, the couple did have one son.&lt;ref name="McDaniel"/&gt; She left her first husband and married a second time, a marriage which lasted until her husband's death in the 1930s. From her second marriage, Sanapia had a son and daughter. Her second husband died when Sanapia was 35. She was overcome with grief, and she drank heavily, gambled, and was promiscuous.&lt;ref name="McDaniel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mojo"/&gt; Then one day, Sanapia healed{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} the sick child of her sister. This event was a spiritual reawakening, and she took it as a sign to denounce her bad ways and became a serious medicine woman.

==Career as a medicine woman==
[[File:Peyote Cactus.jpg|thumb|right|[[Peyote]], a religious sacrament in the [[Native American Church]]]]
Sanapia remarried around 1945, and after menopause,&lt;ref name="Jestice"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Jestice|first=Phyllis G.|title=Sanapia|encyclopedia=Holy people of the world: a cross-cultural encyclopedia|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2004|volume=3|pages=765|isbn=1-57607-355-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H5cQH17-HnMC&amp;pg=PA765}}&lt;/ref&gt; she began her healing practice. She began to have frequent dreams related to the peyote ritual which she believed was a gift from the Christian God to the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] people.&lt;ref name="McDaniel"/&gt; She healed many people using a medical kit of both botanical and non-botanical medicines, such as [[Achillea ptarmica|sneezeweed]] to treat [[heart palpitation]]s, [[low blood pressure]] and congestion, [[mescal bean]] for ear problems, [[rye grass]] for the treatment of [[cataracts]], [[Juniperus virginiana|red cedar]] to ward off ghosts,  prickly ash to treat fever;  [[Iris (plant)|iris]] for colds, [[Amphiachyris dracunculoides|broomweed]] for dermatological ailments etc.&lt;ref name="McDaniel"/&gt; Her most important medicine was peyote.&lt;ref name="Bataille &amp; Laurie"/&gt; She was only prevailent in using the body parts of dead animals such as beef fat for mouth burns, white otter fur and porcupine quills for children, fossilized bone to treat wounds and infections and even a [[Bible]] to pray for power.&lt;ref name="McDaniel"/&gt;

During her career she was particularly adept as healing facial paralysis, now known as [[Bell's palsy]] which she believed was inflicted upon the victim by an evil ghost.&lt;ref name="Sonneborn"/&gt; Sanapia believed that the ghost throws a feather into the body of the affected patient and unless it is removed the patient will die. However, she did not believe that the ghost physically placed a feather in a body, but rather placed the essence of it within the individual to inflict pain.&lt;ref name="Weigle"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=we2KvdT3zOsC&amp;pg=PA1257&amp;dq=Sanapia&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9Q7LTKqBM8_Gswa_8LmnAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Sanapia&amp;f=false|title=ENCYCLOPEDIA OF Women and Religion IN NORTH AMERICA|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|page=1257|isbn=0-253-91687-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; She would heal the victim by asking them to bathe in a stream, followed by a prayer to the eagle to help heal her patient, and [[smudging]] the patient with [[Juniperus virginiana|cedar]] smoke. She would then chew on milkweed and place in on the part of the body which was affected by the paralysis and would then suck on the affected part of the patient's face with a cow horn to draw out the sickness.&lt;ref name="McDaniel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baer"/&gt; During the healing she was often obtain four or so eagle of crow feathers and fan the patient to ward of evil spirits.&lt;ref name="Baer"/&gt; If the treatment was ineffective, Sanapia would pray apply peyote tea to the patient's face, head, and hands and if the patient needed her deepest powers of healing she would sing a song until she attracted the spririts to help her.&lt;ref name="McDaniel"/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Sanapia was buried in the Comanche Indian cemetery near [[Chandler Creek, Oklahoma]]. Her activities were documented by David E. Jones in ''Sanapia, Comanche Medicine Woman'', from 1967, with Sanapia's permission.&lt;ref name="McDaniel"/&gt; She adopted Jones as her son, otherwise it would be a wrongdoing to pass down information about the traditional healing to an outsider.&lt;ref name="Bison"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HCOiOOjhwAUC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=Sanapia&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=phXLTOujNcjKswb3gZnSDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Sanapia&amp;f=false|author=Bataille, Gretchen M., Sands,  Kathleen M. |title=American Indian women, telling their lives|publisher=Bison Books, University of Nebraska Press|page=|year=1987|isbn=0-8032-6082-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanapia's purpose was for the book to serve as a form of autobiography, to pass the knowledge which she had acquired down to the next generation and to encourage others to follow in her footsteps in being a traditional medicine woman and healer.&lt;ref name="Bison"/&gt; None of her children, however, were interested enough in spiritual healing to follow in her footsteps.&lt;ref name="Sonneborn"/&gt;

'''Terence Henderson Lee''' [[Order of Australia|OAM]] (born 31 August 1940) is a former cricketer who played [[first-class cricket]] for [[New South Wales cricket team|New South Wales]] from 1962 to 1967.&lt;ref name="FC"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/5/5952/First-Class_Matches.html| title = First-class matches played by Terry Lee| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later became prominent in research and development in the Australian wine industry, work for which he was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in 2007.

==Cricket career==
An all-rounder who batted in the middle order and bowled off-spin, Terry Lee played several matches for [[New South Wales cricket team|New South Wales]] Colts between 1959-60 and 1962-63.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/5/5952/Miscellaneous_Matches.html| title = Miscellaneous matches played by Terry Lee | publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Against [[Victoria cricket team|Victoria]] Colts in 1962-63 he scored 137 out of a New South Wales Colts total of 292.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/252/252598.html | title = Victoria Colts v New South Wales Colts 1962-63 | publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first-class debut for New South Wales a few weeks later.&lt;ref name="FC"/&gt;

He played as the professional for [[East Lancashire Cricket Club|East Lancashire]] in the [[Lancashire League (cricket)| Lancashire League]] in 1963. East Lancashire won the championship, Lee scoring 701 runs (more runs than any other professional in the league) at an average of 43.81 and taking 59 wickets at 14.06.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]'' 1964, p. 726.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He played most of the 1963-64 season in the New South Wales team, scoring 253 runs at 25.30&lt;ref name ="Bat"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/5/5952/f_Batting_by_Season.html| title = First-class batting and fielding in each season by Terry Lee | publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and taking 14 wickets at 45.07.&lt;ref name ="Bowl"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/5/5952/f_Bowling_by_Season.html| title = First-class bowling in each season by Terry Lee | publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one stage he was considered a possibility to be selected in the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1964|Australian team to tour England in 1964]].&lt;ref&gt;[[R. S. Whitington]], ''Bradman, Benaud and Goddard's Cinderellas'', Rigby, Adelaide, 1964, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; He played for an Australian XI against the touring South Africans in Melbourne, but with little success.&lt;ref&gt;''Wisden'' 1965, pp. 826-27.&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, for New South Wales against the South Africans, he top scored with 68 in the New South Wales second innings total of 147.&lt;ref&gt;''Wisden'' 1965, pp. 827-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to the Lancashire League in 1964. East Lancashire finished third, Lee scoring 833 runs at 39.66 and taking 63 wickets at 11.53.&lt;ref&gt;''Wisden'' 1965, p. 733.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was less successful in 1964-65 and 1965-66 and played irregularly for New South Wales. He returned to better form in 1966-67, finishing the season with 254 runs at 23.09&lt;ref name ="Bat"/&gt; and 15 wickets at 23.60.&lt;ref name ="Bowl"/&gt; In a low-scoring match against [[Queensland cricket team|Queensland]] in mid-season he scored 45 and 8 not out and took 2 for 26 and 4 for 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/28/28570.html | title = New South Wales v Queensland 1966-67 | publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the next match a week later, he and [[John Gleeson (cricketer)|John Gleeson]] bowled [[South Australia cricket team|South Australia]] out for 87, Lee taking 4 for 28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/28/28578.html| title = New South Wales v South Australia 1966-67 | publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played the first three matches of the 1967-68 [[Sheffield Shield]] season but without success.&lt;ref&gt;''Wisden'' 1969, pp. 881-85.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Fox and the Cat''' ({{lang-it|Il gatto e la volpe}}, the names sequence is reversed as ''gatto'' means "cat" and ''volpe'' means "fox") are a pair of fictional characters who appear in [[Carlo Collodi]]'s book ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'' (''Le avventure di Pinocchio''). Both are depicted as [[Confidence trick|con-men]], who lead Pinocchio astray and unsuccessfully attempt to murder him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberts |first=Hannah |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2503311/Villa-inspired-Pinocchio-goes-sale-9m.html |title=Villa that inspired Pinocchio goes for sale for £9m |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2013-11-12 |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rich |first=Nathaniel |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2011/10/carlo_collodi_s_pinocchio_why_is_the_original_pinocchio_subjecte.html |title=Carlo Collodi's Pinocchio: Why is the original Pinocchio subjected to such sadistic treatment? |publisher=Slate.com |date=2011-10-24 |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair pretend to sport disabilities; the Fox [[lameness]] and the Cat [[blindness]]. The Fox is depicted as the more intelligent of the two, with the Cat usually limiting itself to repeating the Fox's words.

==Role in the book==
[[Pinocchio]] encounters the two after leaving [[Mangiafuoco]]'s theatre with five gold coins, whereupon the Fox claims to know Pinocchio's father [[Mister Geppetto]] and proposes to Pinocchio to visit the Land of [[Barn owl|Barn Owls]] (''Paese dei Barbagianni'') and thence to a 'Field of Miracles' (''Il campo dei Miracoli''), where coins can be grown into a money-producing tree. A white [[Common blackbird|blackbird]] warns Pinocchio against these lies, but is eaten by the Cat. The Fox covered up this action by claiming that the blackbird talks too much. The pair lead Pinocchio to the Red Prawn Inn (''Osteria del Gambero Rosso''), where they eat a large meal and ask to be awoken at midnight.

Two hours before the set time, the pair abandon Pinocchio to pay for the meal with one of his coins and has the innkeeper leave a message for Pinocchio that the Cat's eldest kitten had fallen ill, and that they would meet Pinocchio at the Field of Miracles later. When Pinocchio leaves the inn, the two attack him in disguise of murderers, and in the ensuing struggle, Pinocchio bites off the Cat's paw. The murderers then hang Pinocchio from a tree, which he escapes with the assistance of [[The Fairy with Turquoise Hair]] who enlisted a [[falcon]] to cut him down.

The next day, Pinocchio encounters the pair again unaware that they are the murderers that hung him. When Pinocchio notices the Cat's paw in a sling, the Fox claims that the Cat cut it off to feed a starving [[Gray wolf|wolf]]. They lead Pinocchio to the town of Catchfools (''Acchiappa Citrulli''), where the coins are soon buried. In Pinocchio's absence, the pair dig up the coins and escape. Pinocchio learned of this from a [[parrot]] who mocked him for falling for their tricks.

Near the end of the book, Pinocchio encounters the Fox and the Cat again when looking for a place for Geppetto to recuperate. This time, the pair have become impoverished, whereas the Fox is now truly lame, nearly hairless, and tailless (the Fox had to chop off his own tail to sell for money), and the Cat truly blind. They plead for food or money, but are rebuffed by Pinocchio (having learned of their tricks and presumably realizes that they were the ones who tried to murder him) while stating that it serves them right for their wickedness. He then leaves, all the while saying goodbye to his "false friends."

However, upon hire, Foulfellow and Gideon are concerned with the Coachman's proposition of luring children to Pleasure Island as it is deemed off limits by the authorities. Their worries are confirmed when the Coachman reveals the reason for his plan, along with his face changing to include more sinister features, frightening the two into agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0OQoCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=honest+john+and+gideon+pinocchio&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=T4aUVY0qhrCwAcuGotAO&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=honest%20john%20and%20gideon%20pinocchio&amp;f=false |title=Handsome Heroes and Vile Villains: Masculinity in Disney's Feature Films - Amy M.

Though portrayed as scoundrels, they never go as far as attempting to murder Pinocchio, although Honest John suggests strongly to the Coachman that they will if that's the proposed job. The subplot of the Field of Miracles is absent. The villains' ultimate fate is that they are arrested by the police when they encounter Pinocchio a third time in some way, but the scene in which this occurred ended up being deleted from the final draft of the film. Foulfellow is portrayed as an eccentric ham actor whereas Gideon's mannerisms resemble Harpo Marx of the [[Marx Brothers]] It was up for consideration to use the characters again in the 1947 Disney film ''[[Fun and Fancy Free]]'' as the owners of the Magic Beans [[Mickey Mouse]] acquires in exchange for his cow, but the idea was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;"The story behind Fun and Fancy Free", Disney VHS, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

The duo were set to make an appearance in the 2009 RPG video game ''[[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days]]'' but were cut for space restrictions.

In the Disney book ''Pinocchio's Promise'', Foulfellow and Gideon see Pinocchio walking into town to give a [[cuckoo clock]] to Gepetto's friend Mrs. Ramono whereupon he is diverted to a [[circus]]. Foulfellow attempts to sell the clock elsewhere while Gideon takes Pinocchio to the circus with two expired tickets, but abandons the boy when the latter is scolded by the admission attendant. Pinocchio reports Foulfellow's trickery to the local police. Foulfellow and Gideon are arrested by the police and Pinocchio gives the clock to Mrs. Ramono.

In a Disney book adaption of the tale ''[[The Emperor's New Clothes]]'', the two, posing as tailors, trick the emperor (portrayed in the same book by [[Prince John (Disney)|Prince John]]).

* In the 1960–61 television adaptation by [[Rankin/Bass Productions]], ''[[The New Adventures of Pinocchio (TV series)|The New Adventures of Pinocchio]]'', the Fox and the Cat are named '''Foxy Q. Fibble''' and '''Cool S. Cat'''. These characters are voiced by [[Larry D. Mann]] and [[Paul Kligman]].
* The Fox and the Cat appear in the 1972 miniseries ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1972 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'', portrayed by [[Ciccio Ingrassia]] and [[Franco Franchi]]. They are depicted as humans but with fur, whiskers and pointy ears.

[[Image:Pinochio gatto volpe.jpg|thumb|''Il Gatto e la Volpe'', as portrayed in Giuliano Cenci's ''[[Pinocchio (1972 film)|Pinocchio]]'']]
* In Giuliano Cenci's 1972 adaptation of ''[[Pinocchio (1972 film)|Pinocchio]]'', the Fox and the Cat (voiced by Sergio Tedesco and Manlio De Angelis in the Italian version and by [[Alan Sues]] and [[Don Messick]] in the English dub) follow the characterization shown in the book: the pair pretend to be physically disabled, and tempt Pinocchio to the Field of Miracles. As in the book, the Fox is the more articulate of the two, and the Pair attempt to murder Pinocchio for his coins, though the Cat does not lose his paw as in the book. At the end of the film, the two are impoverished, though the Fox does not lose his tail or any of his fur as in the book.
* The Fox and the Cat are the primary antagonists of another Rankin/Bass adaptation in 1980, ''[[Pinocchio's Christmas]]'', voiced by [[Allen Swift]] (who was impersonating [[Sydney Greenstreet]]) and [[Pat Bright]]. They had previously made "friends" with Pinocchio and taught him many of his bad habits. They do not feign disability and the Cat is female. They try to sell Pinocchio to a [[The Coachman|sleigh driver]] that works for a rich [[duke]] who will give Pinocchio to his children. They aren't seen again after they give Pinocchio to a servant of the Duke.
* In the 1992 [[direct to video]] adaptation entitled ''[[Pinocchio (1992 film)|Pinocchio]]'' from [[GoodTimes Entertainment]], the Fox is replaced with a Wolf, the Cat speaks like a [[beatnik]], and both are voiced by [[Cam Clarke]]. The two of them target Pinocchio's gold coins and have not attempted to kill Pinocchio. At the film's conclusion, the Wolf and the Cat are arrested by a police officer when Pinocchio sees them in a passing paddy wagon. They beg Pinocchio to vouch for them whereupon Pinocchio tells the police officer that they stole his coins. The police officer then drives the paddy wagon away stating that what they did to Pinocchio will be the result of a long prison sentence.
* In [[Steve Barron]]'s 1996 live action film ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'', the Fox and the Cat (portrayed by [[Rob Schneider]] and [[Bebe Neuwirth]]) are named '''Volpe''' ('Fox' in Italian) and '''Felinet''', and are portrayed as human thieves in league with [[Mangiafuoco]] (named Lorenzini in this adaptation). In a reversal of roles, Felinet is female (although this is the case in the book) and takes on the more dominant role while Volpe is a bungling sidekick. They first appear at their first encounter with Pinocchio, from which Geppetto takes Pinocchio away from them while telling Volpe and Felinet that Pinocchio will play with his own sort. Volpe and Felinet later witness Pinocchio causing mischievous havoc in a bakery even when the police arrive. As in the novel, the pair trick Pinocchio into giving up his coins by taking him to the Field of Miracles (depicted near a [[monastery]]), where they steal the money. In conclusion, they are tricked by Pinocchio into drinking cursed water (where Pinocchio claims that the water will enable them to turn white stones into gold) which transforms them into a real fox and cat offscreen. They are shown to have been captured by a farmer and kept as pets where they later witness Pinocchio in town. When Volpe quotes "Don't you just hate that kid," Felinet quotes "Not as much as I hate you."
* The Fox and the Cat were featured in the ''[[Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child]]'' version of Pinocchio where they were referred to as Redd Foxx (voiced by Barry Douglas) and Sporty the Cat (voiced by [[Franklyn Ajaye]]).
* The Fox and the Cat were featured in the 2002 film ''[[Pinocchio (2002 film)|Pinocchio]]'' where they were played by comedy duo [[Fichi d'India]] (Bruno Arena and Max Cavallari) in the Italian version and their English-dubbed voices were provided by [[Cheech Marin]] and [[Eddie Griffin]]. Like some of the animal characters depicted in this film, this version are depicted as humans but sport pointy ears and fangs. They trick Pinocchio into digging his coins in the Meadow of Miracles outside of Grabadimwit. They are not seen again after seizing Pinocchio's coins.
* In ''[[Pinocchio 3000]]'', the characters Cab and Rodo (voiced by Matt Holland and Jack Daniel Wells) are two robots based on the Fox and the Cat. They are owned by Mayor Scamboni's daughter Marlene.
* The Fox and the Cat appear in the 2008 TV film ''[[Pinocchio (2008 film)|Pinocchio]]'', portrayed by [[Toni Bertorelli]] and Francesco Pannofino.
* The Fox and the Cat appear in the 2012 ''[[Pinocchio (2012 film)|Pinocchio]]'' film, voiced by Mariccia Affiato and [[Maurizio Micheli]] in the Italian version and by [[Sonja Ball]] and [[Thor Bishopric]] in the Canadian English dub. In this version, the Fox is female and the Cat is male. In the 2018 American release, they are renamed Trixie the Fox and Leo the Cat, voiced by [[Ambyr Childers]] and [[Jon Heder]].

==Notes==
Often the ''Field of the miracles'' has been mistaken with the poetic phrase ''Square of the miracles'' that is used since the second half of the 20th century to describe the [[Piazza del Duomo, Pisa|Piazza del Duomo]] of [[Pisa]]. The monuments of the famous square had been called ''miracles'' by [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]] in his book ''Forse che sì, forse che no'' (1910). Several famous squares in Italy being called ''campo'' and the story of Pinocchio being widespread in the World, many people, in and outside Italy, tend to confuse the two.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

'''Tsali''' ({{lang-chr|ᏣᎵ}}), originally of Coosawattee Town (''Kusawatiyi''), was a noted leader of the [[Cherokee]] during two different periods of the history of the tribe. As a young man, he followed the [[Chickamauga Cherokee]] war chief, [[Dragging Canoe]], from the time the latter migrated southwest during the [[Cherokee–American wars]]. In 1812 he became known as a prophet, urging the Cherokee to ally with the [[Shawnee]] [[Tecumseh]] in war against the Americans.

Later, during the 1830s roundup of Cherokee for [[Trail of Tears|Indian Removal]], Tsali, his wife and brother, his three sons and their families were taken by surprise and marched at bayonet point toward the Indian Agency on the Hiwasee River. When Tsali's wife paused to care for the needs of her baby, one of the guards whipped her and prodded her with his bayonet, to force her on her way.&lt;ref name= Carter /&gt;{{rp|235}} According to a secondhand account by Wasidana, Tsali's son, the mother and baby were forced onto horseback and, in the process, "she got her foot hung in the stirrup. Then her baby dropped. It went that way, out yonder, and bust the head. And it died right then."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kutsche|first1=Paul|title=The Tsali Legend: Culture Heroes and Historiography|journal=Ethnohistory|date=1963|volume=10|issue=4|page=341|doi=10.2307/480334}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, a surprise attack was made on the soldiers, one guard was killed and the rest wounded or subdued. Tsali and his relatives fled to the mountains and hid out in a cave in the Smoky Mountains. His successful evasion was reported to the other Indians by grapevine and soon the mountain Cherokees by dozens, then by hundreds, joined him in the hideout, living off roots and berries on the border of starvation.

General [[Winfield Scott|Scott]] was baffled by the situation. He had not the troops to track down Indians in that impervious and secret region. Nor was he certain that he wanted to. But if Tsali's freedom went unchallenged, a fateful example would be set for other Cherokees. Scott enlisted the services of William Thomas, a white trader who had lived for twenty years among the North Carolina Indians and had their confidence. Thomas was given a message to the leader of the fugitives. If Tsali and his family would surrender themselves to military justice, the rest of the Cherokees in the mountains could remain free.

He and his brother and sons came down from the mountains and gave themselves up. Tsali's youngest boy Wasidana was spared; the others were executed. According to Wasidana, they were shot by a firing squad of Cherokee prisoners, compelled to the act as a means of impressing on the Indians the hopelessness of their position.

Tsali's martyrdom, however, marked not a hopeless end but a beginning. The three hundred fugitives remaining free became the forebears of some five thousand Cherokees living today in the North Carolina mountains, legatees of the once-proudest Nation in Native American Indian history. And Tsali's story survives close to the scene of its original enactment, in the annual presentation of a Cherokee drama entitled ''[[Unto These Hills]]''.&lt;ref name=Carter&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carter III |first1=Samuel |title=Cherokee sunset : a nation betrayed : a narrative of travail and triumph, persecution and exile |date=1976 |publisher=Doubleday |location=Garden City, N.Y. |isbn=0385067356 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prophet ==
During the turbulent years leading up to the [[War of 1812]] and the [[Creek War]], Tsali first became known as a major figure on the Cherokee national scene. The teachings of [[Tenskwatawa]], known as the "Shawnee Prophet", began to filter down to the Native Americans of the Southeast, where they sparked a traditionalist cultural and religious revival. Tenskwatawa was the brother of the Shawnee leader [[Tecumseh]], who led a pan-Indian resistance against the Americans.

Tenskwatawa's influence inspired what the later anthropologist [[James Mooney]] called the "Cherokee Ghost Dance movement." This revival increased Tecumseh's fame.  He visited the council of the [[Muscogee (Creek)|Upper Muscogee]] and representatives of the other tribes of the Southeast at [[Tuckabatchee]]. He called on them to band together, abandon the ways of acculturation, and take up arms together in a united war against the Americans.

The Cherokee National Council had sent a small delegation led by [[Major Ridge|The Ridge]] to hear Tecumseh. He was generally well received but, when Tecumseh asked the Cherokee delegation when he could speak to their National Council, The Ridge replied that if Tecumseh set one foot inside the [[Cherokee Nation (1794–1907)|Cherokee Nation]] The Ridge would kill him. The chief considered Tecumseh a threat to Cherokee stability, although he had fought alongside many of the Cherokee leaders in the late 1780s during the Cherokee–American wars.

Some weeks after that Council, the [[1812 New Madrid earthquake]] struck, affecting the entire continent of [[North America]], with aftershocks for weeks afterwards. The legend spread that after his rejection by the Cherokee at Tuckabatchee, Tecumseh had promised that when he returned home, he would stomp his foot down on the earth so that the anger of the Great Spirit would come upon the Earth.

In a Council meeting at Ustanali some weeks later, the traditionalist prophet Tsali from the town of Coosawattee came to speak. He was eloquent in favor of alliance with Tecumseh. The Ridge, widely acknowledged as the best orator among the Cherokee Nation, argued against what he had said.  Supporters of Tsali attacked The Ridge, who was saved by the intervention of a friend.

The Ridge's defiance of Tsali caused the prophet to lose face with the Council, which had been at the point of voting nearly unanimously to support Tecumseh's war. Tsali prophesied a great apocalypse for the Cherokee Nation and said the only safe haven would be the [[Smoky Mountains]] of western [[North Carolina]], to which he then departed.

The National Council refused The Ridge efforts to gain support for the Americans in their conflict with the British during the [[War of 1812]]. The Council got involved in the [[Creek War]] only after being recruited by the [[Muscogee (Creek)| Lower Muscogee]].

== Cherokee removal ==
After the 1835 Treaty of New Echota, the federal government began to round up Cherokee in preparation for the [[Cherokee removal|forced removal]] to what was to become [[Indian Territory]]. When the soldiers came into the small group of farmsteads owned by Tsali's extended family in the Snowbird Mountains of western North Carolina, they were attacked, and some of them killed.

Both [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]], [[Principal Chiefs of the Cherokee|Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation]] and [[Yonaguska]], [[Principal Chiefs of the Cherokee|Principal Chief of the Eastern Band of Cherokee]], condemned Tsali's actions. They offered to capture him and his warriors—in the strongest of terms—and offered to help run him and his family down. Yonaguska was given the task, and asked for assistance from his friend Utsala on the Nanthahala River, hoping to gain him permission to stay in the state as compensation for his effort.  The Cherokee captured Tsali and his family, and executed him and two of his sons. The rest of his large family was allowed to remain under the umbrella of the Eastern Band.

==Early life==

Udit Narayan was born in 1955 to [[Nepal]]i father Harekrishna Jha and Indian mother Bhuvaneshwari Jha.&lt;ref name="Outlook_int_2017"/&gt; In 2009, when Udit Narayan was awarded India's civilian honour ''[[Padma Shri]]'', there were reports questioning his Indian citizenship, claiming that he was born in Nepal. However, Udit Narayan himself branded these reports as "completely false", and stated that he was born in the Baisi village of [[Supaul district]] of [[Bihar]] at his maternal grandparents' home.&lt;ref name="IANS_birth"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/music/getting-padma-shri-a-dream-come-true/story-yiohUwVr91LVN8cLJ8GR3H.html |title='Getting Padma Shri a dream come true' |date=28 January 2009 |newspaper=Hindustan Times |quote='They say I was born in Nepal, but that's completely false. I was born in a village called Baisi on the Supaul district of Bihar in 1955 at my maternal grandparents' home,' Udit had said in a recent interview with IANS.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When his acceptance of the ''Padma Shri'' led to his criticism in Nepal, he told the Nepalese daily ''[[Kantipur (daily)|Kantipur]]'' that he was "from Nepal but his mother's home was in Bihar."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/Artistes-have-no-borders-Udit-Narayan-tells-Nepal/articleshow/4037648.cms |title=Artistes have no borders, Udit Narayan tells Nepal |newspaper=The Times of India |date=27 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2017 interview with the Indian magazine ''[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]]'', he clarified that he was born in Baisi, and clarified that his father Harekrishna was a native of [[Bhardaha]], [[Saptari District]], [[Sagarmatha Zone]], [[Nepal]].&lt;ref name="Outlook_int_2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/song-of-life-diary/298795 |title=Song Of Life Diary |author=Udit Narayan |date=8 May 2017 |publisher=Outlook }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2018, Udit Narayan revealed at a ceremony held by the Bihar Jharkhand Association of North America, that he identifies as a [[Bihari people|Bihari]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.patnadaily.com/index.php/news/13809-bihar-jharkhand-association-of-north-america-honors-singer-udit-narayan.html|title=Bihar Jharkhand Association of North America Honors Singer Udit Narayan - PatnaDaily|website=www.patnadaily.com|accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After eight years, Narayan moved to Bombay on a musical scholarship for Nepalese from the Indian Embassy in Nepal to study classical music at Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Narayan started his Bollywood career in 1980 when he was noted by [[music director]] Rajesh Roshan, who asked Narayan to playback sing for the Hindi film ''[[Unees-Bees]]''. Narayan was given the opportunity to sing with the legendary singer [[Mohammed Rafi]]. He sang for Devanand a couplet in Swami Dada.His first duet was in the film Sannata.  Soon after, Narayan sang for a number of other movies, including ''[[Bade Dil Wala]]'' in 1983, where he sang a duet with senior singer [[Lata Mangeshkar]], composed by senior music director R. D. Burman. In the same year, Narayan sang with [[Kishore Kumar]] in the film ''Kehdo Pyar Hai''. Another singer he sang with was [[Suresh Wadkar]] with music composed by [[Bappi Lahiri]].  A significant milestone in his career occurred in 1988 when [[Anand-Milind]] gave him the opportunity to sing all the songs for the successful Bollywood movie ''[[Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak]]'', with [[Alka Yagnik]], which earned him a [[Filmfare Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Filmfare_Awards/1989 |title=IMDB:Filmfare Awards:1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[The Times of India]], Narayan said: "The song I've sung, "Manzilein", is the best song of my career after "Pehla Nasha", which gave me superstardom!".&lt;ref name="ref159"&gt;{{cite web|title='Life Is Beautiful' has soulful rendition of music|url=http://www.mid-day.com/articles/life-is-beautiful-has-soulful-rendition-of-music/15547168|accessdate=24 June 2017|publisher=[[The Times of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Narayan remained prolific through the 2000s, singing popular numbers in films such as ''[[Pukar (2000 film)|Pukar]]'', ''[[Dhadkan]]'', ''[[Lagaan]]'', ''[[Devdas]]'' and ''[[Veer Zaara]]''.

==Other work==

It is written, composed and directed by environmentalist [[Nipesh DHAKA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/printedition/news/2016-05-29/nepali-house-hold-names-go-for-the-guinness-world-records.html|title=Nepali house-hold names go for the Guinness World Records|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Volkert van der Graaf''' (born 9 July 1969) is a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] convicted [[murder]]er who [[Assassination|assassinated]] politician [[Pim Fortuyn]], the leader of the [[Pim Fortuyn List]] (LPF), on 6 May 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/may/06/3 |title=Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn assassinated |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=7 May 2002 |website=theguardian |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred during the political campaign for the [[Dutch general election, 2002|Dutch general elections of 2002]].

The prosecutor's statement said Van der Graaf had said "he saw in Fortuyn an increasing danger to, in particular, vulnerable sections of society."&lt;/ref&gt;

Van der Graaf was arrested shortly after shooting Fortuyn, who died immediately. In court, van der Graaf testified that he had become alarmed that Fortuyn was using Muslims and immigrants as scapegoats in a campaign to seek political power. He thought the politician endangered society with his controversial statements. His trial started on 27 March 2003. He was convicted on 15 April 2003 and sentenced to 18 years in prison. The trial generated large interest from the Dutch public, especially Fortuyn supporters.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Van der Graaf appealed for the reduction of the sentence to 16 years, but on 18 July 2003, the appeals court upheld the previous sentence. He was released on [[parole]] in May 2014 after serving two thirds of his sentence.&lt;ref name="parole"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pim Fortuyn: Politician's Killer Is Freed Early|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1253915/pim-fortuyn-politicians-killer-is-freed-early|accessdate=6 May 2016|work=[[Sky News]]|date=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family life and education==
Van der Graaf was born in [[Middelburg]], in the [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of [[Zeeland]]. By the time he attended university in [[Wageningen]], he had become a [[Veganism|vegan]] and an advocate of [[animal rights]]. At the time of the murder he lived with his girlfriend and their infant daughter in [[Harderwijk]].&lt;ref name="rd-visscher"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.refdag.nl/nieuws/i_volkert_van_der_g_breekt_macht_met_kogels_i_1_372155 | title=Volkert van der G. breekt macht met kogels | date=16 December 2002 |

==Career==
Van der Graaf worked for the environmental organisation [[Vereniging Milieu Offensief]] in Wageningen, which he had co-founded in 1992. His job involved challenging violators of environmental regulations through litigation. He concentrated particularly on contesting practices in [[intensive animal farming]] and [[fur farming]]. He was said to be highly motivated, working more than the four days per week of his contract. He was successful at litigation, winning about three out of every four cases.&lt;ref name="nova-volkert"/&gt;

==Murder of Fortuyn==
{{main|Assassination of Pim Fortuyn}}
On 6 May 2002 [[Pim Fortuyn]] was shot and killed outside a radio studio in [[Hilversum]] at 6:00&amp;nbsp;pm, just after he finished an interview. Interviewer [[Ruud de Wild]] witnessed the murder.

Van der Graaf was arrested near the scene of the crime after a pursuit by witnesses. Details of the suspect were always officially reported as "Volkert van der G.", in accordance with unwritten Dutch [[privacy]] practice, but his full name was readily available on the internet. His home and work addresses were soon circulated on web sites used by Fortuyn's supporters. Angry supporters gathered in several cities, so several people related to Van der Graaf went into hiding. His girlfriend and their daughter left their house on the evening of the murder.

The details of the murder emerged later; the accounts of the investigators and Van der Graaf were consistent. He had planned the attack using information obtained from the Internet; printouts of a map of the scene of the crime and schedules of Fortuyn's appearances were found in his car. In two boxes of [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridges]] found at his home, seven cartridges were missing, the exact number loaded in his gun. The attack has been described as the work of a single person, an amateur shooter who used a relatively simple plan and did not prepare a good escape route.

Van der Graaf purchased his weapons illegally: a semi-automatic [[Star Firestar M43]] pistol in a café in [[Ede, Netherlands|Ede]] and [[9×19mm Parabellum|9mm]] cartridges in [[The Hague]]. After the murder of Fortuyn, the gun was linked to a suspect in the robbery of a jeweller in [[Emmen, Netherlands|Emmen]] through [[DNA]] material found on the weapon.

On the day of the murder, he attended work in the morning, taking with him a backpack containing the gun, a pair of latex gloves, a baseball cap and a pair of dark glasses. At the end of the morning, he said he was taking the afternoon off on account of the beautiful weather. He drove towards [[Hilversum]], knowing that Fortuyn was due to be interviewed in the radio studio of [[NPO 3FM|3FM]] in the [[Media Park (Hilversum)|Media Park]]. During the trip he stopped several times, among other things to purchase a razor to remove his [[Shaving|stubble]], which together with the cap and glasses would disguise his appearance, while the gloves would avoid leaving [[fingerprint]]s. The razor did not work.

He had never visited the Mediapark, relying on a map and a couple of photos to find his way into the park on foot and to the building where Fortuyn's interview was held. Recognising Fortuyn's car in the car park, he hid in some nearby bushes, burying the gun which was in a plastic bag in a shallow trough in case he was discovered. He could hear fragments of Fortuyn's interview from a speaker on the outside of the building. He waited there for about two hours.
 
Fortuyn emerged from the building in the company of several others. Van der Graaf walked towards Fortuyn, passed by him, then turned and opened fire. He said that he aimed for the back to avoid Fortuyn's ducking away or a bullet mistakenly hitting somebody else. He held the gun in both hands, with the plastic bag around it. Less than {{Convert|1.5|m|ft}} from Fortuyn, he hit him in the back and head five times, and fired a sixth shot that missed.

Running away, Van der Graaf was chased by [[Hans Smolders]], Fortuyn's chauffeur. Two employees from a different building joined in. During the chase, Van der Graaf threatened them by raising the gun in his jacket pocket toward them. They ran from the grounds of the Mediapark onto a public road, where Van der Graaf pointed the pistol at arms length at Smolders. He had been reporting their position to the police by [[mobile phone]]. Reaching a gas station, Van der Graaf gave up when police pointed their pistols at him.

== Investigations and trial==

=== Initial investigations and conspiracy theories ===
For several months Van der Graaf refused to make any statement about the murder, on the advice of his lawyers. He was represented by [[Britta Böhler|Böhler]], Koppe and Franken, with Franken leading.

In the months following the murder, many [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] were put forth by supporters of Fortuyn and others. Officials investigating the murder dismissed these popular rumours, declaring that no evidence had been found for the involvement of others. No evidence was found to support rumors that Van der Graaf had committed the earlier murder in 1996 of Chris Van der Werken, an environmental official from [[Nunspeet]], or that he had attended other appearances by Fortuyn.

On 7 July 2006, the national daily newspaper ''[[De Telegraaf]]'' published an article alleging Van der Graaf's connection with the murder of Van der Werken. ''De Telegraaf'' printed extracts of a secret police report on the murder of Van der Werken on its website. [[Quirijn Meijnen]], a Dutch-based media lawyer who represented Van der Graaf, said the accusations were grave and unfounded, and that the publication of extracts of the secret police report infringed Van der Graaf's privacy rights. ''De Telegraaf'' failed to mention that Van der Graaf was never a suspect in the murder case of Van der Werken.

After Van der Graaf's arrest, he was held in strict isolation until 1 June. He could speak only to his lawyers and police and justice officials. He was kept under constant observation by [[video camera]].

A second search of Van der Graaf's home on 24 June found a chemical mixture, [[calcium chlorate]] and sugar, hidden in 35 condoms in his garage. Nearby were flasks of [[Sulfuric acid|sulphuric acid]]. Experts said the substances could be combined to make a [[Incendiary device|fire bomb]] or [[explosive]] material. Van der Graaf later said that he had fabricated the materials around 1990–1992 for experimentation purposes and had forgotten about them.

=== First hearing ===
The first "[[pro forma]]" hearing in his trial started on 9 August, which Van der Graaf watched on television from his cell in the [[Bijlmerbajes]] prison. The prosecution outlined its evidence, which included the finding of DNA matching Fortuyn on Van der Graaf's clothes and gun, matching of the bullets used in the attack with the gun, and eyewitnesses who pursued him continuously from the murder scene to the point of arrest. The defence complained that lack of discretion in reporting by the press and statements by public officials would make it difficult to obtain a fair trial. It requested calling as witnesses several politicians who had made public comments about the murder, including the past and present [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Prime Ministers]] [[Wim Kok]] and [[Jan Peter Balkenende]], as well as various members of Lijst Pim Fortuyn including Herben and Janssen van Raay.

On the morning of 3 September, Van der Graaf's girlfriend was arrested at her workplace in connection with the chemicals found at their former home. Her lawyer and the lawyers of Van der Graaf denounced this as an attempt to pressure Van der Graaf into making a statement. She was released two days later and eventually cleared of any suspicion after Van der Graaf made a statement on her behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/vriendin-van-der-g-niet-langer-verdacht~a624997/ | title=Vriendin Van der G. niet langer verdacht | date=13 November 2002 | publisher=de Volkskrant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second hearing ===
During a second "pro forma" hearing on 4 November, it was decided that the trial would be delayed while Van der Graaf was sent for seven weeks of [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] observation at the [[Pieter Baan Centre]], starting in the first week of January 2003. In a press statement of 23 November, the prosecution (Public Ministry) announced that Van der Graaf had confessed to the murder. He said he planned it for some time and that nobody else was involved in the plans or knew about them. He believed Fortuyn was a steadily increasing danger for vulnerable groups in society. He saw no other possibility than to end the danger by killing Fortuyn.

In response to the confession, Mat Herben said he was still not convinced that Van der Graaf had acted alone. Fortuyn's brother Marten said he was not surprised by the confession but feared that Van der Graaf was setting himself up as "saviour of the fatherland".

The confession has not been made publicly available. Reports have asserted that Van der Graaf said he was "not proud" of the deed. He said if he could consider the decision again, he wouldn't do it. He said that he did not see himself as "the saviour of the Netherlands" or as a [[martyr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4324/Nieuws/article/detail/1784559/2003/03/10/Van-der-G-niet-trots-op-moord.dhtml | title=Van der G. niet trots op moord | date=10 March 2003 | publisher=Trouw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 January 2003, Van der Graaf was moved to the Pieter Baan Centrum (PBC) to begin the seven-week behavioural investigation. Disagreements between the Ministry of Justice and the management of the PBC over the conditions of his supervision delayed it. The Ministry wanted Van der Graaf under video surveillance 24 hours per day and isolated from other patients for his own safety. The PBC believed such cameras would prevent establishing the trust needed for the multi-disciplinary behavioural investigation. It took responsibility to supervise him in a small group so that the investigation could proceed optimally. On 20 January, Van der Graaf said he was suspending his cooperation for the investigation. The Minister of Justice, [[Piet Hein Donner]], resolved the dispute by dropping the demands for video surveillance and isolation.

=== Third hearing ===
On January, 29th, 2003 a third "pro forma" hearing was held in which the dates for the trial were set. Since the subject of the trial was expected to be not so much the question of the guilt of Van der Graaf, but instead the degree of the punishment, the report of the Pieter Baan Centrum was considered highly significant, in case it found that he was of "diminished responsibilities". After the completion of the investigation on 14 March, he was returned to his prison cell in the Bijlmerbajes.

The report from the PBC was complete by about 21 March. It found that Van der Graaf could be held completely accountable for the killing. The report also stated that Van der Graaf has a severe [[personality disorder]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/netherlands/1427685/Fortuyn-killer-gets-18-years.html Fortuyn killer gets 18 years]&lt;/ref&gt; which explains his rigid moral judgements. [[Menno Oosterhoff]], a child psychiatrist from [[Groningen]], publicly suggested that the Pieter Baan Centrum may have overlooked the possibility that Van der Graaf has [[Asperger syndrome]]. Oosterhoff later withdrew his theory. The PBC report stated that nothing could be said about the chance of another similar crime occurring, since the disorder had nothing to do with the murder. Van der Graaf agreed that he was accountable and that he had compulsive urges. The outcome of the investigation ensured that he would receive a prison sentence and not "[[Involuntary commitment|TBS treatment]]".

=== The trial ===

The trial was held in a high-security court in [[Amsterdam]]-Osdorp over three days: 27 March, 31 March and 1 April. About 15 supporters of Fortuyn demonstrated outside the building, with banners such as "for less than 20 years we will smash the place up", "better fortuynist than socialist" and "the leftist church is criminal". The proceedings were followed by about 80 people, including a woman who disturbed the occasion by screaming at Van der Graaf, accusing him of such things as "destroying the whole of the Netherlands". Van der Graaf was counselled by the high-profile German-born attorney, [[Britta Böhler]].

Van der Graaf was charged with the premeditated murder of Fortuyn, two counts of possession of illegal weapons, namely the gun and the explosive mixture at his house, and a charge of threatening the life of Fortuyn's [[chauffeur]] by pointing his gun at him during the chase following the murder.

The prosecutor asked for life imprisonment for the killing, saying that an example must be set for anybody else attempting to frustrate the democratic process through criminal means. He said the crime was serious because of its victim and the consequences, and that to a certain degree it was a "political murder". Van der Graaf had irrevocably damaged the democratic political progress of Fortuyn, and had done it intentionally. For an exceptional crime, he deserved an exceptional punishment.

During the trial, Van der Graaf described his reasons for killing Fortuyn. He had hoped that the leaders of other political parties would criticize Fortuyn, but that it never happened. Fortuyn had the talent to channel criticism so that it never touched him. Van der Graaf said he had spoken to no one about his plan. He finished his planning just the day before the murder. He was wrestling with regret for the killing, finding the killing of somebody morally reprehensible. On 6 May he had felt justified, wanting to fight the danger of what Fortuyn represented, not the man. He did not find it easy to talk about feelings. Asked about the danger of accidentally injuring somebody other than Fortuyn in the attack, he said that he had been confident that that wouldn't happen. The 3FM [[disc jockey]] [[Ruud de Wild]] said that he barely escaped with his life, as he received a bullet in the bag used for a shield.

To the argument that Fortuyn would have been chosen through democratic means, Van der Graaf said that that was also the case for [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. He compared the rise of Fortuyn to the rise of Nazism in the 1930s.&lt;ref name =BBC/&gt; In his final argument, he said that he had acted from his conscience, but that did not justify murder. He said it was absolutely not normal to shoot somebody to death.

Van der Graaf said he murdered Fortuyn to defend Dutch Muslims from [[religious persecution|persecution]]. He wanted to stop Fortuyn from targeting "the weak parts of society to score points" and exploiting Muslims as "scapegoats" in an attempt to seek political power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volkertvandergraaf.net/Volkert/bekentenis.htm Volkert van der G&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/europe/03/27/netherlands.fortuyn.trial/ "Fortuyn killer 'acted for Muslims'"], CNN 27 March 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans-Pritchard, Ambrose and Joan Clements [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/netherlands/1425944/Fortuyn-killed-to-protect-Muslims.html "Fortuyn killed 'to protect Muslims'"], ''Telegraph'' (28 March 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Van der Graaf said that he would not have committed the murder, at least not on that evening, if Fortuyn had been accompanied by security guards. This is relevant for accusations that the government should have provided security. On Tuesday, 15 April 2003, Van der Graaf was convicted and sentenced to 18 years' imprisonment.

=== Appeals ===
The prosecution and the defence both made appeals against the sentence. Prior to the appeal, suggestions in the media that Van der Graaf may have had [[Asperger syndrome]] were rejected by workers at the PBC. They said they had considered and rejected the possibility. A psychiatric report read in court said that Van der Graaf had an [[Obsessive–compulsive personality disorder|obsessive compulsive personality]] but was sane and could be held accountable for his actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/europe/04/22/fortuyn.appeal/index.html "Fortuyn's killer to appeal"], ''CNN'' (22 April 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution argued that the court had not taken account of the political nature of the murder, and asked again for life imprisonment. The defence argued that the sentence didn't take account of the harsh conditions under which Van der Graaf had been held, nor the damage that had been done by unsubstantiated allegations that had appeared in the media (such as the connection with Van der Werken), and requested a reduction in sentence to 16 years. The appeals court accepted some of the arguments from both parties, and on 18 July 2003 reiterated the sentence to 18 years' imprisonment.

== Release ==

Van der Graaf was released on [[parole]] on 2 May 2014, after having served two thirds of his sentence as required by Dutch law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/opinie/we-moeten-volkert-van-der-g-net-zo-behandelen-als-andere-veroordeelden~a3623406/|title='We moeten Volkert van der G. net zo behandelen als andere veroordeelden'|author=Chris Rutenfrans|newspaper=Volkskrant|date=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/02/dutch-politician-pim-fortuyn-killer-eligible-early-parole|title=Dutch politician's killer is eligible for early parole|newspaper=Guardian|date=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conditions of his parole were: weekly reporting to the probation service; a ban on visiting the places of residence of relatives of the victim or the municipal areas of Rotterdam, Hilversum and The Hague; location monitoring with an ankle bracelet with GPS; a ban on contacting the relatives of Fortuyn; a ban on communicating with the media; and compulsory meetings with a psychologist or psychiatrist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten-en-publicaties/mediateksten/2014/03/26/spreektekst-staatssecretaris-teeven-over-voorwaardelijke-invrijheidsstelling-van-der-g.html | title=Spreektekst staatssecretaris Teeven over voorwaardelijke invrijheidstelling Van der G. | date=25 March 2014 | publisher=Dutch Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently settled in [[Apeldoorn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/22747679/__Volkert_weer_in_beeld__.html | title=Volkert na twaalf jaar weer in beeld | author=John van den Heuvel | date=17 June 2014 | publisher=De Telegraaf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, his lawyer Stijn Franken started legal proceedings against the terms of the parole. Van der Graaf was interested in becoming a legal advisor, and the restriction on visiting The Hague was unreasonable when so many legal organisations are based there. He also claimed that the restriction on communicating with the press was a violation of free speech, and that this and other restrictions were unnecessary when experts had found the risk of recidivism to be extremely low. He was partially successful, in that the travel restrictions and the ankle bracelet conditions were removed, but the media ban remained to "prevent unnecessary social unrest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1012/Nederland/article/detail/3689187/2014/07/14/Advocaat-Franken-Van-der-G-krijgt-straf-bovenop-straf.dhtml | title=Advocaat Franken: 'Van der G. krijgt straf bovenop straf' | date=14 July 2014 | publisher=Algemeen Dagblad}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1012/Nederland/article/detail/3705980/2014/07/30/Rechter-heft-beperkingen-Van-der-Graaf-deels-op.dhtml | title=Rechter heft beperkingen Van der Graaf deels op | date=30 July 2014 | publisher=Algemeen Dagblad}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government appealed the judgement, but it was upheld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2014/10/14/volkert-van-der-g-hoeft-geen-enkelband-meer-te-dragen | title=Volkert van der G. hoeft definitief geen enkelband meer om | author=Sam de Voogt | date=14 October 2014 | publisher=NRC Handelsblad}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Van der Graaf faced another court case in which the public prosecutor asked that he be returned to prison for a year for failing to sufficiently answer questions at probation meetings. However, on 6 February 2017 the court found that he had sufficiently met his probation requirements by appearing at the meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://nos.nl/artikel/2156766-volkert-van-der-graaf-niet-terug-naar-gevangenis.html | title=Volkert van der Graaf niet terug naar gevangenis | date=6 February 2017 | publisher=NOS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Van der Graaf again took legal action against the government over the terms of his parole, saying that the parol hearings prevented him from  emigrating. The court ruled in his favour, and an appeal was withdrawn after a new arrangement was made: that Van der Graaf would report by email once every two months, until April 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.ad.nl/binnenland/minister-tevreden-over-deal-met-volkert-van-der-graaf~a6d63c28f/ | title=Minister tevreden over deal met Volkert van der Graaf | date=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wada Ei 1.jpg|thumb|Wada Ei]]
{{nihongo|'''Wada Ei'''|和田 英||1857 - 1929}} was a textile worker and memoirist during the [[Meiji Era]] in Japan, daughter of samurai from Matsushiro, [[Shinano Province]]. She is known for writing a memoir called the "Tomioka Diary" (''Tomioka Nikki'') in which she chronicled her life among the female workers in the [[Tomioka silk mill]].

She was among the daughters of [[samurai]] who were recruited in 1873, the sixth year of the Meiji period, from across the nation for practical training over a period of two to three years in the silk production process. They later became trainers in silk manufacture in their own prefectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Meiji Revisited: The Sites of Victorian Japan |author=Finn, Dallas |publisher=[[Weatherhill]] |year=1995 |ISBN=0-8348-0288-0 |pages=23f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon leaving Tomioka in 1874, the government awarded Wada and her colleagues medals and the special title "Women Spinners' Victory Battalion". She became a trainer at the Saijō Village Silk Reeling Factory (later Rokkōsha mill) in [[Matsushiro]], [[Nagano Prefecture]].

Wada married an army officer, who later died in 1913 from wounds he sustained in the Russo-Japanese war. She began composing the ''Tomioka Nikki'' while living at the Furukawa Mine company house at the [[Ashio Copper Mine]], where her son was a manager. It was published after her death by him, leading some historians to doubt its authenticity.

'''Women in Finland''' enjoy a "high degree of equality" and "traditional courtesy" among men.&lt;ref name=Alho/&gt; In 1906, the women of Finland became the first women in [[Europe]] to be granted the right to vote.&lt;ref name=WBC&gt;[http://www.worldbusinessculture.com/Women-in-Business-in-Finland.html Women in Business in Finland], worldbusinessculture.com&lt;/ref&gt; There are many women in Finland who hold prominent positions in [[Finnish society]], in the [[Education in Finland|academics]], in the field of business,&lt;ref name=WBC/&gt; and in the [[government of Finland]]. An example of powerful women in [[Finnish politics]] is [[Tarja Halonen]], who became the first female president of the country (she was [[Foreign Minister of Finland]] before becoming president).  In religion, where most of the Finnish people are members of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]] (the other major Christian denomination in Finland is the [[Orthodox Church]]), women can be ordained as priests. In terms of finance, Finnish women have been described as "usually independent financially". Married women, by custom, introduces themselves by mentioning their forename first, then their maiden name, and then the surname of their husbands.&lt;ref name=Alho&gt;Alho, Olli.

== Women's suffrage ==
{{Main|Women's suffrage in Finland}}
[[File:Women in Finnish Parliament (1907).jpg|thumb|260px|13 of the total of 19 female MPs, who were the first female MPs in the world, elected in [[Finnish parliamentary election, 1907|Finland's parliamentary elections in 1907]].]]
{{Women in society sidebar}}
The area that in 1809 became Finland was a group of integral provinces of the [[Kingdom of Sweden]] for over 600 years, signifying that also women in Finland were allowed to vote during the Swedish [[Age of Liberty]] (1718–1772), when suffrage was granted to tax-paying female members of [[guild]]s&lt;ref name="Karlsson-Sjögren 1866"&gt;Åsa Karlsson-Sjögren: ''Männen, kvinnorna och rösträtten : medborgarskap och representation 1723–1866'' ("Men, women and the vote: citizenship and representation 1723–1866") (in Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;

The predecessor state of modern [[Finland]], the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]] was part of the Russian Empire from 1809 to 1917 and enjoyed a high degree of [[autonomy]]. In 1863 taxpaying women were granted municipal suffrage in the countryside, and in 1872, the same reform was given to the cities&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/1946097 P. Orman Ray: Woman Suffrage in Foreign Countries. The American Political Science Review. Vol. 12, No. 3 (Aug., 1918), pp. 469-474 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Parliament Act in 1906 established the unicameral [[parliament of Finland]] and both women and men were given the right to vote and stand for election. Thus Finnish women became the first in the world to have unrestricted rights both to vote and to stand for parliament. In elections the next year, 19 female MPs, first ones in the world, were elected and women have continued to play a central role in the nation's politics ever since. [[Miina Sillanpää]], a key figure in the worker's movement, became the first female minister in 1926.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Finland's first female President [[Tarja Halonen]] was voted into office in 2000 and for a second term in 2006. Since the 2011 parliamentary election, women's representation stands at 42,5%. In 2003&amp;nbsp;[[Anneli Jäätteenmäki]] became the first female Prime Minister of Finland, and in 2007 [[Matti Vanhanen's second cabinet]] made history as for the first time there were more women than men in the cabinet of Finland (12 vs. 8).{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

== Women's Rights Movement ==
In 1970 there was a brief but strong women's movement. Rape in marriage was not considered a crime at the time, and victims of domestic violence had nowhere to go when things got really ugly. They also fought for a day-care system that would be open to the public, and for the right for not only paid maternity leave but also paternity leave. Today there is a 263-day parental leave in Finland. and making it illegal to discriminate against women in the workforce. Two feminist groups were created to help the movement: ''The Marxist-Feminists'' and ''the Red Women''. The feminists in Finland were inspired by other European countries such as Sweden and Switzerland. Other important groups for the Finnish women in the 1970s include "Unioni" and "The Feminists"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www15.uta.fi/FAST/FIN/SOCPOL/ia-women.html|title = The Womens' Rights Movement in Finland|date = |accessdate = |website = Fast-Fin-1|publisher = Finnish Institutions Research Paper|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women’s rights ===
Finland became one of the first countries to grant women the right to vote, and still today they are among the top countries for women equality. "Finland was voted second in the Global Gender Gap Index in women’s rights." In 2003 the government of Finland proposed addressing issues with gender inequality. They planned to promote gender equality over the entire public administration, reform the Act on Equality that the men and women in Finland share, promote equal pay for work of equal value, increase the number of women in political and economic roles, assessing gender equality from the male point of view, prevent domestic violence and intimate partner violence, protect victims of trafficking and the possibility of criminalizing buying sex. This act is called the Government Action Plan for Gender Equality and it included more than 100 issues that needed discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.mpsv.cz/files/clanky/16168/Gender_equality_policies__FIN.pdf|title = Gender Equality Policies in Finland|last = |first = |date = |journal = Brochures of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==

=== In History ===
In the late 18th century and early 19th century private schools for girls were established in Finland, among the more known being those of [[Christina Krook]], [[Anna Salmberg]] and [[Sara Wacklin]]. These schools were criticized for its shallow education of accomplishments, which resulted in the decision that girls should be included in the school reform of 1843, and the following year, two Swedish-language state schools for girls was founded in Turku and Helsinki, ''[[Svenska fruntimmersskolan i Åbo]]'' and ''[[Svenska fruntimmersskolan i Helsingfors]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Siegberg, Arthur: Den högre kvinnobildningen i Finland, dess utveckling och mål., W. C. Fabritius &amp; Sonner, Kr.a.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the establishment of a net of girl schools of a similar kind in Finland. At first the schools were reserved for girls from upper-class families. 
 
At this time it was not possible for the girls to pass the baccalaureate and move on to university studies. In 1865 a grammar school made it clear that only girls whose upbringing and manners were impeccable and whose company can’t be considered detrimental to others, and who were from "respectable" families could be in the school.

After the first woman in Finland, [[Maria Tschetschulin]], was accepted as a university student by dispensation in 1870, advanced classes and colleges classes were included in many girl schools to prepare students for university (by means of dispensation), and in 1872, the demand that all students must be members of the Swedish language upper classes was dropped. Women were given the right to teach in grammar schools for girls in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.helsinki.fi/sukupuolentutkimus/aanioikeus/en/articles/path.htm|title = The path of Finnish women towards liberty and education|date = |accessdate = |website = Centenary of Women's full political rights in Finland|publisher = |last = Tuomaala|first = Saara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the dispensation for female university students was dropped and women were accepted at the same terms as men in 1915, girls and boys started to receive the same education in the school system, and the girl schools in Finland started to be changed to same sex education, a development which was completed in the 1970s.

Finland students start their schooling a year after a lot of other countries. In spite of this, Finland is now one of the top-performing countries in mathematical skills, but also one of the few whose boys performed as well as girls. While in most countries the most able girls lag behind the most able boys in mathematics performance, according to the PISA 2012 Results Overview, the OECD gender score difference in mathematics, reading, and science was a result of -6 (boys - girls) in Finland. Additionally, while the highest-performing students of problem solving in the world are largely males, Finland makes an exception where the proportion of top-performing females is about the same as the proportion of top-performing males. This is also true among the Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC) where the top-performers in problem solving are predominantly men, except for in Finland, Australia and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oecd.org/pisa/keyfindings/pisa-2012-results-overview.pdf|title =PISA 2012 Results in Focus|date = |accessdate = |website = OECD Keyfindings Programme for International Student Assessment|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for Finland's educational benefits for students, Finnish schools offer state-funded schooling which makes it easier for women and men to go to work after being on parental leave. Women represent 32% of students studying in mathematics and computer science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.helsinki.fi/sukupuolentutkimus/aanioikeus/en/|title = Centenary of Women's Full Political Rights in Finland|date = |accessdate = |website = Centenary of Women's Full Political Rights in Finland|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women in the Workforce ==
According to the Finnish Labor Force Survey around 32% of the 301,000 people who are self-employed are women. Women first became involved in labor markets through agrarian societies. Even before the public daycare systems, the number of women in the workforce was still very high, over 50%.  The number of workers in the labor force that makes up the females (ages 15–74) is 51%, where men is 49%. 32% of the women are involved in entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Growth Oriented Women Entrepreneurs and Their Businesses|last = Brush|first = C.G.|publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing|year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = 112–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Equality in the workforce ===
Employers who have at least 30 employees must have a gender equality plan that includes a women's and men's pay comparison. The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health and other important labor market organizations set guidelines for gender equality planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.mpsv.cz/files/clanky/16168/Gender_equality_policies__FIN.pdf|title = Gender Equality Policies in Finland|last = |first = |date = |journal = Ministry of Social Affairs and Health|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women in the Military ==
Military service is required for men in Finland, but is voluntary for women. Women who enlist are allowed to train for combat roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.buzzfeed.com/hillaryreinsberg/countries-that-already-allow-women-in-combat#.cp94GQDyWz|title = 13 Countries That Already Allow Women In Combat|date = Jan 2013|accessdate = |website = BuzzFeed|publisher = |last = Reinsberg|first = Hillary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finland is one of 16 other countries in the world that permit women in front-line combat positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/01/25/map-which-countries-allow-women-in-front-line-combat-roles/|title = Map: Which countries allow women in front-line combat roles?|date = Jan 2013|accessdate = |website = The Washington Post|publisher = The Washington Post|last = Fisher|first = Max}}&lt;/ref&gt;
