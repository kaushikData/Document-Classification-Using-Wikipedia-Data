The '''Aggreko Power Station''' was a temporary 20-[[megawatt]] [[fuel oil]]-fired power station which was commissioned in October 2003 after [[Aggreko]], the world's largest [[temporary power generation]] company, won an open bid offered by the [[Ceylon Electricity Board]] to overcome the Sri Lanka energy crisis faced in the 1990s to early 2000s. It was later decommissioned on 31 December 2012. Prior to decommissioning, Aggreko sold electricity to the [[Ceylon Electricity Board]] at a rate of {{Nowrap|[[Sri Lankan Rupee|Rs.]] 26 per [[KWh]]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4449">An '''anticyclonic tornado''' is a [[tornado]] which rotates in a [[clockwise]] direction in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and a [[counterclockwise]] direction in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. The term is a naming convention denoting the anomaly from normal rotation which is [[cyclonic]] in upwards of 98 percent of tornadoes. Many [[Anticyclone|anticyclonic]] tornadoes are smaller and weaker than cyclonic tornadoes, forming from a different process.
[[File:Bigspringanticyclonictornado.jpg|thumb|An anticyclonic tornado near [[Big Spring, Texas]] on May 22, 2016 captured by [[Storm chasing|storm chaser]] Aaron Jayjack.]]

==Formation==
Most strong tornadoes form in the [[inflow (meteorology)|inflow]] and updraft area bordering the [[updraft]]-[[downdraft]] interface (which is also near the [[mesoscale meteorology|mesoscale]] "triple point") zone of [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]]s. The thunderstorm itself is rotating, with a rotating updraft known as a [[mesocyclone]], and then a smaller area of rotation at lower altitude the [[tornadocyclone]] (or [[low-level mesocyclone]]) which produces or enables the smaller rotation that is a tornado. All of these may be quasi-vertically aligned continuing from the ground to the mid-upper levels of the storm. All of these [[cyclone]]s and scaling all the way up to large [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] ([[low-pressure system]]s) and [[tropical cyclone]]s rotate cyclonically. Rotation in these [[synoptic scale]] systems stems partly from the [[Coriolis effect]], but thunderstorms and tornadoes are too small to be significantly affected. The common property here is an area of lower pressure, thus surrounding air flows into the area of less dense air forming [[cyclonic rotation]]. The rotation of the thunderstorm itself is induced mostly by vertical [[wind shear]].

Various processes can produce an anticyclonic tornado. Most often they are [[satellite tornado]]es of larger tornadoes which are directly associated with the tornadocyclone and mesocyclone. Occasionally anticyclonic tornadoes occur as an anticyclonic companion ([[mesoanticyclone]]) to a mesocyclone within a single storm. Anticyclonic tornadoes can occur as the primary tornado with a mesocyclone and under a [[rotating wall cloud]]. Also, anticyclonic supercells (with mesoanticyclone), which usually are storms that split and move to the left of the parent storm motion, though very rarely spawning tornadoes, spawn anticyclonic tornadoes. There is an increased incidence of anticyclonic tornadoes associated with tropical cyclones, and [[mesovortices]] within [[bow echo]]es may spawn anticyclonic tornadoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stull|first=Roland B.|title=Meteorology for Scientists and Engineers|year=2000|publisher=Thomson Learning|isbn=9780534372149|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first anticyclonic tornado associated with a mesoanticyclone was spotted on [[NEXRAD|WSR-88D]] weather radar in Sunnyvale, California May 4, 1998. The tornado was an F-2 on the [[Fujita Scale]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Monteverdi|first=John P.|author2=Blier, Warren|author3= Stumpf, Greg|author4= Pi, Wilfred|author5= Anderson, Karl|title=First WSR-88D Documentation of an Anticyclonic Supercell with Anticyclonic Tornadoes: The Sunnyvale–Los Altos, California, Tornadoes of 4 May 1998|journal=Monthly Weather Review|date=November 2001|volume=129|issue=11|pages=2805–2814|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(2001)129&lt;2805:FWDOAA&gt;2.0.CO;2|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0493%282001%29129%3C2805%3AFWDOAA%3E2.0.CO%3B2|bibcode = 2001MWRv..129.2805M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DBP 1991 1490-R.JPG|thumb|German postage stamp from 1991, commemorating 750 years of the apothecary profession]]
The '''apothecaries' system''' or '''apothecaries' weights and measures''' is a historical system of [[mass]] and [[volume]] units that were used by [[physician]]s and [[apothecary|apothecaries]] for medical recipes, and also sometimes by scientists.&lt;ref name="riemann186"&gt;"Medicinal-Gewicht, Apotheker-Gewicht ist dasjenige Gewicht, nach welchem Aerzte und Apotheker die Quantitäten der Arzneimittel bestimmen.

It is subdivided into 16 (avoirdupois) ounces, or 256 (avoirdupois) drachms. These ounces and drachms are not integer multiples of a grain.&lt;/ref&gt; It divides a pound into 12 ounces, an ounce into 8 [[Dram (unit)|drachms]], and a drachm into 3 [[scruple (unit)|scruples]] or 60 grains.

For a long time, medical recipes were written in [[Latin language|Latin]], often using special symbols to denote weights and measures.

The use of different measure and weight systems depending on the purpose was an almost universal phenomenon in Europe between the decline of the [[Roman Empire]] and [[metrication]].&lt;ref&gt;"An acre is not an acre, nor a bushel a bushel, if you travel but ten miles.

More significantly, it was often based on different weight standards.

The apothecaries' system often used the same ounces as the precious metals system, although even then the number of ounces in a pound could be different. The apothecaries' pound was divided into its own special units, which were inherited (via influential treatises of Greek physicians such as [[Pedanius Dioscorides|Dioscorides]] and [[Galen]], 1st and 2nd century) from the general-purpose weight system of the Romans. Where the apothecaries' weights and the normal commercial weights were different, it was not always clear which of the two systems was used in trade between merchants and apothecaries, or by which system apothecaries weighed medicine when they actually sold it.&lt;ref name=civilwar&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Apothecary's Cabinet |year=2006 |publisher=American Institute of the History of Pharmacy |last=Hasegawa |first=G.R. |title=Preparing and dispensing descriptions during the Civil War Era |url=http://www.pharmacy.wisc.edu/aihp/AC/AC10.pdf |format= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809121753/http://www.pharmacy.wisc.edu/aihp/AC/AC10.pdf |archivedate=August 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dublin&gt;In 1850, an attempt was made in Ireland to solve this problem: "In relation to the weights and measures, a great innovation has been made, which, however, the College feels confident will receive the sanction of the public and the profession.

==English-speaking countries==

{{See also|Imperial units|United States customary units}}
The traditional English apothecaries' system of weights is as shown in the table, the pound, ounce and grain being identical to the [[troy pound]], ounce and grain.
In the United Kingdom, a reform in 1826 made the troy pound the primary weight unit (a role in which it was superseded half a century later by the Avoirdupois pound), but this had no effect on apothecaries' weights. However, the Medicinals Act of 1858 completely abolished the apothecaries' system in favour of the standard Avoirdupois system. The confusing variety of definitions and conversions for pounds and ounces is covered elsewhere in a [[:Template:English pounds|table of pound definitions]]. In the United States, the apothecaries' system remained official until it was abolished in 1971 in favour of the metric system.

From the pound down to the scruple, the English apothecaries' system was a subset of the [[#Roman weight system|Roman weight system]] except that the troy pound and its subdivisions were slightly heavier than the Roman pound and its subdivisions. Similar systems were used all over Europe, but with considerable local variation described below under [[#Variants|Variants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Zupko | first=Ronald Edward | authorlink=Ronald Edward Zupko | location=Maddison | year=1977 | title=British Weights &amp; Measures: A History from Antiquity to the Seventeenth Century |publisher= The University of Wisconsin Press | isbn= 0-299-07340-8 | page=5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pWUgAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English-speaking countries also used a system of units of fluid measure, or in modern terminology [[volume]] units, based on the apothecaries' system. A volume of liquid that was approximately that of an [[apothecaries' ounce]] of water was called a fluid ounce, and was divided into fluid drachms and sometimes also fluid scruples. The analogue of the grain was called a [[minim (unit)|minim]].

The [[imperial unit|imperial]] and [[United States customary units|US]] systems differ in the size of the basic unit (the [[gallon]] or the [[pint]], one gallon being equal to eight pints), and in the number of fluid ounces per pint. Apothecaries' systems for volumes were internationally much less common than those for weights.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. a German handbook of medicine prescription from 1835 when describing the English system mentioned that no such system was in current use in Germany: "Von Maassen ist in Deutschland gegenwärtig [...] fast nur noch das Quart [...] gebräuchlich." {{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rWcOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA99 | last=Phoebus | first=P. | title=Handbuch der Arzneiverordnungslehre | year=1836 | location=Berlin | volume=Vol. I | page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before introduction of the imperial units in the UK, all apothecaries' measures were based on the [[wine gallon]], which survived in the US under the name ''liquid gallon'' or ''wet gallon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Brande | first=W.T. | title=A manual of chemistry | year=1830 | volume=Vol. I | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u79wbv8_TaEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA490 | page=490 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wine gallon was abolished in Britain in 1826, and this system was replaced by a new one based on the newly introduced imperial gallon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Skinner | first=F.G. | location=London | year=1967 | title=Weights and Measures: their ancient origins and their development in Great Britain up to AD&amp;nbsp;1855 | publisher = Her Majesty's Stationery Office | pages=106–109.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the imperial gallon is 20% more than the liquid gallon, the same is true for the imperial pint in relation to the liquid pint. This explains why the number of fluid ounces per gallon had to be adjusted in the new system so that the fluid ounce was not changed too much by the reform. Even so, the modern UK fluid ounce is 4% ''less'' than the US fluid ounce, and the same is true for the smaller units. For some years both systems were used concurrently in the UK.&lt;ref name=medicaltimes&gt;{{cite journal | year=1853 | journal=Medical Times | title=Weights and Measures | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uxsCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA312 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also commonly used, but unofficial divisions of the Apothecaries' system, consisting of:&lt;ref name="Christison1842"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir Robert Christison|title=A dispensatory, or commentary on the pharmacopoeias of Great Britain: comprising the natural history, description, chemistry, pharmacy, actions, uses, and doses of the articles of the materia medica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zpg-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR38&amp;dq=%22dessert+spoon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MirxTvvgL6rRiAKg_IC9Dg&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22dessert%20spoon%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 December 2011|year=1842|publisher=Black|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*table-spoon 1/2 fl oz

In the US, the similar measures in use were once

*Teaspoonful — ƒʒ j (5 mL)(once codified in the U.S.P. IX)


The cited book states, "In almost all cases the modern teacups, tablespoons, dessertspoons, and teaspoons, after careful test by the author, were found to average 25 per cent. greater capacity than the theoretical quantities given above, and thus the use of accurately graduated medicine glasses, which may be had now at a trifling cost, should be insisted upon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Volume 6 |date=|location=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3KVGAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA45|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apothecaries' measures eventually fell out of use in the UK and were officially abolished in 1971. In the US, they are still occasionally used, for example with prescribed medicine being sold in four ounce (℥ iv) bottles.&lt;ref&gt;In 2002, the FDA recalled medicine sold in four ounce bottles because the measuring cup enclosed only had metric units.

The use of Latin ensured that the recipes could be read by an international audience. There was a technical reason why ''3&amp;nbsp;ʒ'' was written ''ʒiij,'' and ''{{frac|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;ʒ'' as ''ʒss'': Writing ''iii'' as ''iij'' would prevent tampering with or misinterpretation of a number after it is written. The letters "ss" are an abbreviation for the Latin "semis" meaning "half", which were sometimes written with a [[Sharp S|ß]]. In Apothecaries' Latin, numbers were generally written in Roman numerals, immediately following the symbol. Since only the units of the apothecaries' system were used in this way, this made it clear that the civil weight system was not meant.&lt;ref name=6000recipes&gt;"As this abbreviation [referring to ''Lb.''] is used to represent both the avoirdupois, and troy or apothecaries' pound, it is necessary to observe, that the ''former'' is indicated when this sign is ''preceded'' by ''Arabic figures''; and the ''latter'', when it is followed by Roman numerals." {{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=A cyclopaedia of six thousand practical receipts | last=Cooley | first=A.J. | year=1850 | title=Weights |page=560 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f38EAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA561 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic form of the apothecaries' system is essentially a subset of the Roman weight system. An apothecaries' pound normally consisted of 12 ounces. (In France this was changed to 16 ounces, and in Spain the customary unit was the ''marco'', a [[mark (mass)|mark]] of 8 ounces.) In the south of Europe and in France, the scruple was generally divided into 24 grains, so that one ounce consisted of 576 grains. Nevertheless, the subdivision of an ounce was somewhat more uniform than that of a pound, and a common feature of all variants is that 12 ounces are roughly 100 drachms (96–128 drachms) and a grain is roughly the weight of a physical grain.

[[Image:Apothecaries weights 1800.png|thumb|300px|Map showing examples of the weight of 1 apothecaries' ounce in grammes around 1800, before metrication and the Prussian weight reform. The dashed lines indicate three different ways to subdivide the ounce.]]
It is most convenient to compare the various local weight standards by the metric weights of their ounces. The actual mass of an ounce varied by ±17% (5&amp;nbsp;g) around the typical value of 30&amp;nbsp;g. The table only shows approximate values for the most important standards; even the same nominal standard could vary slightly between one city and its neighbour. The range from 25&amp;nbsp;g to 31&amp;nbsp;g is filled with numerous variants, especially the Italian range up to 28&amp;nbsp;g. But there is a relatively large gap between the troy ounces of 31&amp;nbsp;g and the Habsburg ounce of 35&amp;nbsp;g. The latter is the product of an 18th-century weight reform.

Even in Turkey a system of weights similar to the European apothecaries' system was used for the same purpose. For medical purposes the tcheky (approx. 320&amp;nbsp;g) was divided in 100 drachms, and the drachm in (16 killos or) 64 grains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Beasley | first=Henry | title=The Druggist's general receipt book | location=London| year=1850 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DHYFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA396 | page=396 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=noback&gt;{{cite book | location=Leipzig | title=Vollständiges Taschenbuch der Münz-, Maass- und Gewichtsverhältnisse | last=Noback | first=C. |author2=Noback, F. | year=1851 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=GIMBAAAAQAAJ Volume 1] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=OYMBAAAAQAAJ Volume 2].&lt;/ref&gt; This is close to the classical Greek weight system, where a ''mina'' (corresponding roughly to a Roman ''libra'') was also divided into 100 drachms.&lt;ref&gt;"The Greek weights, mentioned by Roman authors, are chiefly the ''talent'', divided into 60 ''minæ'', and the ''mina'' into 100 ''drachmæ.''

With the beginning of metrication, some countries standardized their apothecaries' pound to an easily remembered multiple of the French [[gram]]me.&lt;ref&gt;"Bayern [...] hat schon im Jahre 1811 nicht nur sein Civilgewicht in eine sehr zweckmäßige Übereinstimmung mit dem französischen Grammengewicht gebracht, sondern auch sein Medicinalgewicht genau nach dem neu eingeführten Civilgericht reguliert [...], wonach das Medicinalpfund (= 360 Grammes) sich zu dem Civilpfunde (= 560 Grammes) [...] wie 9:14 verhält [...]."

In the [[Romance language|Romance]] speaking part of Europe the scruple was divided in 24&amp;nbsp;grains, in the rest of Europe in 20&amp;nbsp;grains. Notable exceptions were Venice and Sicily, where the scruple was also divided in 20&amp;nbsp;grains.&lt;ref name=phoebus&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rWcOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA94 | pages=94–96 | last=Phoebus | first=P. | title=Handbuch der Arzneiverordnungslehre | year=1836 | location=Berlin | volume=Vol. I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sicilian apothecaries' ounce was divided in 10&amp;nbsp;drachms. Since the scruple was divided in only 20&amp;nbsp;grains, like in the northern countries, an ounce consisted of 600&amp;nbsp;grains. This was not too different from the situation in most of the other mediterranean countries, where an ounce consisted of 576&amp;nbsp;grains.&lt;ref name=phoebus /&gt;

In France, at some stage the apothecaries' pound of 12&amp;nbsp;ounces was replaced by the larger civil pound of 16&amp;nbsp;ounces. The subdivisions of the apothecaries' ounce were the same as in the other Romance countries, however, and were different from the subdivisions of the otherwise identical civil ounce.

{{See also|Ancient Roman units of measurement}}
The basic apothecaries' system consists of the units pound, ounce and scruple from the classical Roman weight system, together with the originally Greek drachm and a new subdivision of the scruple into either 20 ("barley") or 24 ("wheat") grains ({{lang-la|grana}}). In some countries other units of the original system remained in use, for example in Spain the ''obolo'' and ''siliqua''. In some cases the apothecaries' and civil weight systems had the same ounces ("an ounce is an ounce"), but the civil pound consisted of 16 ounces. ''Siliqua'' is Latin for the seed of the [[carob]] tree.

Many attempts were made to reconstruct the exact mass of the Roman pound. One method for doing this consists in weighing old coins; another uses the fact that Roman weight units were derived from Roman units of length similarly to the way the kilogramme was originally derived from the metre, i.e. by weighing a known volume of water. Nowadays the Roman pound is often given as 327.45&amp;nbsp;g, but one should keep in mind that (apart from the other uncertainties that come with such a reconstruction) the Roman weight standard is unlikely to have remained constant to such a precision over the centuries, and that the provinces often had somewhat inexact copies of the standard. The weight and subdivision of the pound in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was reformed by [[Charlemagne]], but in the [[Byzantine Empire]] it remained essentially the same. Since Byzantine coins circulated up to [[Scandinavia]], the old Roman standard continued to be influential through the Middle Ages.

The history of mediaeval medicine started roughly around the year 1000 with the [[Schola Medica Salernitana|school of medicine in Salerno]], which combined elements of Latin, Greek, Arabic and Jewish medicine. [[Galen]] and [[Pedanius Dioscorides|Dioscorides]] (who had used the Graeco-Roman weight system) were among the most important authorities, but also Arabic physicians, whose works were systematically translated into Latin.

According to ''De ponderibus et mensuris'', a famous 13th century text that exists in numerous variations and is often ascribed to [[Dino di Garbo]], the system of weights used in Salerno was different from the systems used in Padua and Bologna. As can be seen from the table, it was also different from the Roman weight system used by Galenus and Dioscorides and from all modern apothecaries' systems: The ounce was divided into 9&amp;nbsp;drachms, rather than 8&amp;nbsp;drachms.

Centuries later, the region around [[Salerno]] was the only exception to the rule that (except for skipping units that had regionally fallen out of use) the apothecaries' ounce was subdivided down to the scruple in exactly the same way as in the Roman system: It divided the ounce into 10&amp;nbsp;drachms.

;Iberian Peninsula
On the [[Iberian Peninsula]], apothecaries' weights in the 19th century were relatively uniform, with 24&amp;nbsp;grains per scruple (576&amp;nbsp;grains per ounce), the standard in Romance countries. The weight of an apothecaries' pound was 345.1&amp;nbsp;g in [[Spain]] and 344.2&amp;nbsp;g in [[Portugal]]. As in Italy, some of the additional subdivisions of the Roman system, such as the ''obolo'', were still in use there. It was standard to use the ''marco'', defined as 8&amp;nbsp;ounces, instead of the pound.&lt;ref name=phoebus /&gt;&lt;ref name=hille&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hille | first=K.C. | title=Medicinal-Gewicht |page=268 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BfI3AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA268 | journal=Magazin für Pharmacie und die dahin einschlagenden Wissenschaften | year=1831 | location=Heidelberg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;France
In 18th century [[France]], there was a national weight standard, the ''marc de Paris'' of 8 ounces. The civil pound of 16 ounces was equivalent to 2 marks, and it was also used as the apothecaries' pound.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner (1967), Page 88, gives the pound as 489.41 gm.&lt;/ref&gt; With 30.6&amp;nbsp;g, the ounces were considerably heavier than other apothecaries' ounces in Romance countries, but otherwise the French system was not remarkable. Its history and connections to the English and Flemish standards are discussed below under [[#Weight standards named after Troyes|Weight standards named after Troyes]].

;Italy
Due in part to the political conditions in what would become a united [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] only in 1861, the variation of apothecaries' systems and standard weights in this region was enormous. (For background information, see [[History of Italy during foreign domination and the unification]].) The ''libbra'' (pound) generally consisted of the standard twelve ounces, however.

The civil weight systems were generally very similar to the apothecaries' system, and since the ''libbra'' (or the ''libbra sottile'', where different systems were in use for light and heavy goods) generally had a suitable weight for an apothecaries' pound it was often used for this purpose. Extreme cases were [[Rome]] and [[Genoa]], where the same system was used for everything, including medicine. On the other hand, there were relatively large differences even between two cities in the same state. E.g. [[Bologna]] (in the [[Papal States]]) had an apothecaries' pound that was less than the local civil pound, and 4% lighter than the pound used in Rome.

The weight of an apothecaries' pound ranged generally between 300&amp;nbsp;g and 320&amp;nbsp;g, slightly less than that of a pound in the Roman Empire. An important exception to this rule is that the [[Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia]] was under rule of the [[Habsburg monarchy]] 1814–1859 and therefore had the extremely large Habsburg apothecaries' pound of 420&amp;nbsp;g. (See below under [[#Habsburg standard|Habsburg standard]].) E.g. in the large city of [[Milan]] the apothecaries' system based on a pound of 326.8&amp;nbsp;g was officially replaced by the metric system as early as 1803, because Milan was part of the Napoleonic [[Italian Republic (Napoleonic)|Italian Republic]]. Since the successor of this little state, the Napoleonic [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]], fell to Habsburg in 1814 (at a time when even in [[France]] the ''système usuel'' had been introduced because the metric system was not accepted by the population), an apothecaries' system was officially introduced again, but now based on the Habsburg apothecaries' pound, which weighed almost 30% more.&lt;ref name=noback /&gt;&lt;ref name=alexander&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LnUAAAAAMAAJ | title=Universal Dictionary of Weights and Measures, Ancient and Modern | last=Alexander | first=J.H. | year=1850 | location=Baltimore }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The apothecaries' pound in [[Venice]] had exactly the same subdivisions as those in the non-Romance countries, but its total weight of 301&amp;nbsp;g was at the bottom of the range. During the Habsburg reign of 1814–1859 an exception was made for Venice; as a result the extreme weights of 301&amp;nbsp;g and 420&amp;nbsp;g coexisted within one state and in immediate proximity. The Venice standard was also used elsewhere, for example in [[Udine]]. In [[Dubrovnik]] (called "Ragusa" until 1909) its use was partially continued for a long time in spite of the official Habsburg weight reform.&lt;ref name=noback /&gt;

The measure and weight systems for the large mainland part of the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] were unified in 1840. The area consisted of the southern half of the [[Italian Peninsula]] and included Naples and Salerno. The subdivision of apothecaries' weight in the unified system was essentially the same as that for gold, silver, coins and silk. It was the most excentric variant in that the ounce was divided in 10&amp;nbsp;drachms, rather than the usual&amp;nbsp;8. The scruple, like in Venice but unlike in the rest of the Romance region, was divided into 20&amp;nbsp;grains. The existence of a unit called ''aureo'', the equivalent of 1{{frac|1|2}} ''dramme'', is interesting because 6 ''aurei'' were 9 ''dramme''. In the original Salerno weight system an ounce was divided into 9 drachms, and so an ''aureo'' would have been ⅙ of an ounce.&lt;ref name=noback /&gt;&lt;ref name=loephoe /&gt;

As early as 1147 in [[Troyes]] in [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] (in the Middle Ages an important trading town) a unit of weight called ''marc de Troyes'' was used.&lt;ref&gt;"Par ailleurs, une unité de poids, le marc de Troyes, apparaît en 1147." {{cite web | url=http://lamop.univ-paris1.fr/baudin/foires/foires.htm | last=Baudin | first=Arnaud | title=Le comté de Champagne et de Brie au Moyen Âge – Les foires de Champagne | publisher=Laboratoire de Médiévistique Occidentale de Paris }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The national [[France|French]] standard until 1799 was based on a famous artefact called the ''[[:fr:Pile de Charlemagne|Pile de Charlemagne]]'', which probably dates back to the second half of the 15th century. It is an elaborate set of nesting weight pieces, with a total metric weight of 12.238&amp;nbsp;''kg''. The set is now shown in the [[Musée des Arts et Métiers]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;A photograph of the ''Pile de Charlemagne'' is shown on the website of the [[Musée des Arts et Métiers]], under the rubric [http://arts-et-metiers.net/musee.php?P=37&amp;id=43&amp;lang=ang School visits / L'aventure du mètre].&lt;/ref&gt; The total nominal value of the set is 50 ''marcs de Troyes'' or ''marcs de Paris'', a mark being 8&amp;nbsp;ounces. The ounce ''poids de marc'' had therefore a metric equivalent of 30.59&amp;nbsp;g.&lt;ref name="maze"&gt;{{cite paper | last=Munro | first=John H. | title=The Maze of Medieval Mint Metrology in Flanders, France and England: Determining the Weight of the Marc de Troyes and the Tower Pound from the Economics of Counterfeiting, 1388-1469 | publisher=Research Papers in Economics | year=1998 | url=http://ideas.repec.org/p/tor/tecipa/munro-98-01.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''poids de marc'' was used as a national French standard for trading, for gold, silver and jewels, and for weighing medicine. It was also used in international communications between scientists. In the time before the [[French Revolution]], the civil pound also played the role of the apothecaries' pound in the French apothecaries' system, which otherwise remained a standard system of the Romance (24 grains per scruple) type.

In [[Bruges]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Antwerpen]] and other [[Flanders|Flemish]] cities, a "troy" unit ("trooisch pond") was also in use as a standard for valuable materials and medicine. As in France, the way in which the Flemish troy ounce was subdivided depended on what was weighed. Unlike the French, the Flemish apothecaries divided the scruple in 20 grains. The Flemish troy pound became the standard for the gold and apothecaries' system in the United Kingdom of the Netherlands; it was also used in this way in [[Lübeck]]. (The London troy pound was referred to as the 'trooisch pond', after metrification.)

The Dutch troy mark consisted &lt;ref&gt;Merchant's Assistant Or Mercantile Instructor (1834)&lt;/ref&gt; of 8 Flemish troy ounces, with each ounce of 20 engels, and each engel divided into 32 assen. The Amsterdam Pound of two marks, used in commerce, weighed 10,280 assen, while the Amsterdam Troy pound weighed 10,240 assen, i.e. exactly two troy marks.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica volume 20, 1823&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A course of lectures on natural philosophy and the mechanical arts - Thomas Young 1807&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1414, six years before the [[Treaty of Troyes]], a statute of [[Henry V of England]] gave directions to the goldsmiths in terms of the [[troy pound]]. (In 1304 it had apparently not yet been introduced, since it did not appear in the statute of weights and measures.) There is evidence from the 15th century that the troy pound was used for weighing metals and spices.&lt;ref name=wms /&gt; After the abolishment of the [[Tower pound]] in 1527 by [[Henry VIII of England]], the troy pound was the official basis for English coin weights. The British apothecaries' system was based on the troy pound until metrication, and it survived in the United States and Australia well into the 20th century.

Since the modern (English, American and Imperial) troy ounces are roughly 1.5% heavier than the late Paris ounce, the exact historical relations between the original ''marc de Troyes'', the French ''poids de marc'', the Flemish trooisch pond and the English troy pound are unclear. It is known, however, that the numerical relation between the English and French troy ounces was ''exactly'' 64:63 in the 14th century.&lt;ref name=wms /&gt;&lt;ref name=troy18&gt;{{cite journal | last=Simpson | first=A.D.C. |author2=Connor, R.D. | title=The mass of the English troy pound in the eighteenth century | journal=Annals of Science | year=2004 | pages=321–349 | doi=10.1080/0003379032000159431 | volume=61 | issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Middle Ages the [[Imperial Free City]] of [[Nuremberg]], an important trading place in the south of Germany, produced large amounts of nesting weight pieces to various European standards.&lt;ref name=wms /&gt; In the 1540s, the first [[pharmacopoeia]] in the modern sense was also printed there. In 1555, a weight standard for the apothecaries' pound of 12 ounces was set in Nuremberg.&lt;ref&gt;"Apothekergewicht: [...] In Nürnberg 1555 geschaffen, in Preußen 1816 durch ein eigenes Apothekergewicht abgelöst." {{cite book | last=Hunnius | first=C. |author2=Ammon, H.P.T. | title=Hunnius pharmazeutisches Wörterbuch | edition=9.

However, some cities kept local copies of the standard.

As of 1800 all German states and cities except [[Lübeck]] (which had the Dutch troy standard) followed the Nuremberg standard. It was also the standard for Denmark, Norway, the Russian Empire and most cantons of Switzerland. Poland and Sweden had their own variants of the standard, which differed from each other by 0.6%.

In 1811, [[Bavaria]] legally defined the apothecaries' pound as 360.00&amp;nbsp;g (an ounce of 30.00&amp;nbsp;g). In 1815, [[Nuremberg]] lost its status as a free city and became part of Bavaria. From now on the Nuremberg apothecaries' pound was no longer the official apothecaries' pound in Nuremberg; but the difference was only 0.6%. In 1836 the Greek apothecaries' pound was officially defined by this standard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year=1842 | author1=Gesellschaft, Deutsche Pharmazeutische | author2=Apotheker, Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Berufsvertretungen Deutscher | author3=Norddeutschland, Apotheker-Verein in | author4=Apotheker-Verein, Allgemeiner Deutscher | title=Königl.

Austria and the states of the [[Habsburg monarchy]] officially had a different standard since 1761, and [[Prussia]], followed by its neighbours [[Anhalt]], [[Lippe]] and [[Mecklenburg]],&lt;ref&gt;To be exact, the states in question were: [[Anhalt-Dessau]], [[Anhalt-Köthen]], [[Lippe-Detmold]], [[Schaumburg-Lippe]], [[Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Mecklenburg-Schwerin]] and [[Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Mecklenburg-Strelitz]].&lt;/ref&gt; would diverge in the opposite direction with a reform in 1816. But in both cases apothecaries continued to use the Nuremberg standard unofficially for a long time after it became illegal.&lt;ref name="trommsdorff"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pp43AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA13#PPA32,M1 | last=Trommsdorff | first=J.B. | title=Systematisches Handbuch der Pharmacie für Aerzte und Apotheker | edition=3rd | location=Erfurt | year=1827 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russia the apothecaries' system survived well into the 20th century. The Soviet Union officially abolished it only in January 1927.&lt;ref name="academic.ru"&gt;{{Cite document | url=http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/enc3p/58050 | title=Аптекарский вес  | publisher=Большой Энциклопедический словарь | accessdate=2010-10-16 | last=ru | postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

===Habsburg standard===
Empress [[Maria Theresia of Austria]] reformed the measures and weights of the [[Habsburg monarchy]] in 1761.&lt;ref name=hille /&gt; The weight of an apothecaries' pound of 12 ounces was increased to a value that was later (after the kilogramme was defined) found to be 420.009&amp;nbsp;g; this was called the ''libra medicinalis major''. It was defined as &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; of the unusually heavy Habsburg civil pound (defined as &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; of the civil pound of [[Cologne]]) and corresponded to a record ounce weight of 35&amp;nbsp;g.

Before the reform, in the north of the empire the Nuremberg standard had been in effect, and in Italy the local standards had been even lighter. It is not surprising that an increase by 17% and more met with some inertia. The 1770 edition of the [[pharmacopoeia]] ''Dispensatorium Austriaco-Viennense'' still used the Nuremberg standard ''libra medicinalis minor'', indicating that even in the Austrian capital [[Vienna]] it took some time for the reform to become effective. In 1774, the ''Pharmacopoea Austriaco-provincialis'' used the new standard, and in 1783 all old apothecaries' weight pieces that were still in use were directed to be destroyed.&lt;ref name="oeaz" /&gt;

Venice was not part of these reforms and kept its standard of approximately 25&amp;nbsp;g per ounce.

When Austria started producing scales and weight pieces to the new standard with an excellent quality/price ratio, these were occasionally used by German apothecaries as well.

At the time of the [[Industrial Revolution]], the fact that each state had its own system of weights and measures became increasingly problematic. Serious work on a "scientific" system was started in France under [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], and completed in 1799 (after the [[French Revolution]]) with its implementation. The French population, however, was initially unhappy with the new system. In 1812, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] reintroduced some of the old measures and weights, but in a modified form that was defined with respect to the metric system. This ''système usuel'' was finally abolished in 1837 and became illegal in 1840.

Due to the large expansion of the [[First French Empire]] under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]], French metrication also affected what would be (parts of) France's neighbour countries after the [[Congress of Vienna]].

The Netherlands were partially metricated when they were French, in the years 1810–1813. With full metrication, effective January 1821, the Netherlands reformed the trooisch pond. The apothecaries' new pound was 375.00&amp;nbsp;g. Apart from rounding issues concerning the subdivisions, this corresponded exactly to the French ''système usuel''. (The reform was not followed in the north German city of Lübeck, which continued to use the trooisch pond.) In Belgium, apothecaries' weight was metricized effective 1856.&lt;ref name=upton&gt;{{cite paper | last=Upton | first=J.K. | year=1878 | url=http://lamar.colostate.edu/~hillger/laws/upton-1878-03-06.html | title=Report on worldwide state of metrication to the US House of Representatives }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1803 and 1815 all German regions west of the [[River Rhine]] were French, organised in the ''[[département]]s'' [[Roer (department)|Roer]], [[Sarre (department)|Sarre]], [[Rhin-et-Moselle]], and [[Mont-Tonnerre]]. As a result of the Congress of Vienna these became part of various German states. A large part of the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]] fell to [[Bavaria]], but having the metric system it was excepted from the Bavarian reform of weights and measures.

In [[Prussia]], a reform in 1816 defined the Prussian civil pound in terms of the Prussian foot and distilled water. It also redefined the apothecaries' pound as 12 ounces, i.e. &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, of the civil pound: 350.78&amp;nbsp;g.&lt;ref name=hille /&gt;&lt;ref name="trommsdorff" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Im Preußischen ist der Unterschied zwischen Civil- und Medicinalgewicht durch eine Verordnung vom 16.

It seems that many apothecaries did not follow this reduction by 2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Archiv und Zeitung des Apotheker-Vereins in Norddeutschland | year=1848 | author=Geffcken | pages=217–226 | title=Bericht über die Lübecker Kreisversammlung des norddeutschen Apotheker-Vereins am 6. August 1848 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kfc3AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA217 }} (The relevant passage is in a quoted summary of an earlier report.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reform in 1856 increased the civil pound from 467.711&amp;nbsp;g to 500.000&amp;nbsp;g (the German civil pound defined by the [[Zollverein]]), as a first step towards [[metrication]]. As a consequence the official apothecaries' pound was now 375.000&amp;nbsp;g, i.e. it was increased by 7%, and it was now very close to the troy standards. §4 of the law that introduced this reform said: "Further, a pharmaceutical weight deviating from the civil weight does not take place." But this paragraph was suspended until further notice.&lt;ref&gt;"§4. Ein von dem Handelsgewichte abweichendes Medizinalgewicht findet ferner nicht statt. [...] §8. [...] Der Zeitpunkt, mit welchem die Vorschrift im §4. in Kraft treten soll, wird durch Königliche Verordnung festgesetzt werden." [https://books.google.com/books?id=gLkNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA113 Gesetz, betreffend die Einführung des allgemeinen Landesgewichts in den Hohenzollernschen Landen. Vom 26. März 1860.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The abolishment of the apothecaries' system meant that doctors' prescriptions had to take place in terms of the current civil weight: grammes and kilograms. This was considered unfeasible by many, and the state received numerous protests and asked for expertises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3wkDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA82 | title=Die Normalgaben der Arzneien nach dem Unzen- und Grammen-Gewicht, zugleich als Repetitorium der Arzneimittellehre, von Dr. F.L.

Britain was initially involved in the development of the metric system, and the US was among the 17 initial signatories of the [[Metre Convention]] in 1875. Yet in spite of enthusiastic support for the new system by intellectuals such as [[Charles Dickens]], these two countries were particularly slow to implement it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dickens | first=Charles | title=At your fingers' ends | year=1863 | journal=All the year round | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RdUNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA233 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To unify all weight systems used by apothecaries, the Irish pharmacopœia of 1850 introduced a new variant of the apothecaries' system which subdivided a new apothecaries' pound of 12 avoirdupois ounces instead of the troy pound.&lt;ref name=dublin /&gt; To allow effective use of the new system, new weight pieces were produced. Since an avoirdupois ounce corresponds to 28.35&amp;nbsp;g, the proposed system was very similar to that in use in Portugal and Spain, and in some locations in Italy. But it would have doubled the value of the avoirdupois drachm (an existing unit, but by then only used for weighing silk).&lt;ref name=6000recipes /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= A manual of chemistry | last=Brande | first=W.T. | year=1830 | edition=3rd | volume=Vol. I | location=London | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u79wbv8_TaEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA489 | page=489 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it conflicted with other non-standard variations that were based on that nearly obsolete unit.&lt;ref name=medicaltimes /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=Medical lexicon – A dictionary of medical science | location=Philadelphia | title=Weight | page=979 | year=1860 | last=Dunglison | first=Robley | authorlink=Robley Dunglison | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zgqN7_Kn3tEC&amp;pg=RA11-PA979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish proposal was not widely adopted, but British legislation, in the form of the Medicinals Act 1858, was more radical: It prescribed the use of the avoirdupois system for the United Kingdom (then including Ireland), with none of the traditional subdivisions. This innovation was first used in the united [[British Pharmacopoeia|British pharmacopœia]] of 1864.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Squire | first=P. | year=1867 | title=A companion to the British pharmacopœia | page=xvi | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pRgDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PP20 | nopp=true }}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice the old apothecaries' system based on the troy pound was still widely used, however, until it was abolished by the Weights and Measures Act of 1976. Since then it can only be used to measure precious metals and stones. (The [[troy pound]] was already declared illegal for most other uses by the Weights and Measures Act of 1878.)

In the US, the metric system replaced the apothecaries' system in the [[United States Pharmacopoeia]] of 1971.

A '''battery electric bus''' is an [[electric bus]] that is driven by an electric motor and obtains energy from on-board [[Electric-vehicle battery|batteries]]. Many [[trolleybus]]es use batteries as an auxiliary or emergency power source.

Battery buses are equipped for charging with fixed [[Bus stop#Pantographs and underbody collectors|pantographs at bus stops]] and in the Depot.&lt;ref&gt;Trolley:Motion, 27.

==Advantages==
Battery electric buses offer zero-emission, quiet operation and better acceleration compared to traditional buses. They also eliminate infrastructure needed for a constant grid connection and allow routes to be modified without infrastructure changes compared to a [[Trolleybus]]. They typically recover braking energy to increase efficiency by a [[regenerative brake]]. With energy consumption of about 1.2 kWh/km, the cost of ownership is lower than diesel buses.&lt;ref name="edda-bus.de"&gt;[http://www.edda-bus.de/de/Praxiseinsatz.html Fraunhofer-Institut für Verkehrs- und Infrastruktursysteme] Praxistest mit einem Fahrzeug zwischen 03.11.2014 bis zum 30.01.2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.china-observer.de/index.php/2014/05/12/china-byd-erhalt-rekordbestellung-uber-2000-e-busse-und-1000-elektroautos/ ''BYD erhält Rekordbestellung über 2000 eBusse und 1000 Elektroautos''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106120054/http://www.china-observer.de/index.php/2014/05/12/china-byd-erhalt-rekordbestellung-uber-2000-e-busse-und-1000-elektroautos/ |date=2016-01-06 }} V. 12. May 2014. Retrieved, 15 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages==
As of 2016 battery buses have less range, higher weight, higher procurement costs. The reduced infrastructure for overhead lines is partially offset by the costs of the infrastructure to recharge the batteries. Battery buses are used almost exclusively in urban areas rather than for long-haul transport. Urban transit features relatively short intervals between charging opportunities. Sufficient recharging can take place within 4 to 5 minutes (250 to 450&amp;nbsp;kW) usually by [[Inductive charging|induction]] or [[Overhead line|catenary]].&lt;ref name="edda-bus.de"/&gt;

The first battery buses were mostly small, mini- or midi- buses. The improvement of battery technology from around 2010 led to the emergence of the battery bus, including heavier units such as twelve-meter standard buses and articulated wagons.

* In 2009, Shanghai catenary bus lines began switching to battery buses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130219194007/http://www.trolleymotion.ch/index.php?id=115&amp;L=0&amp;n_ID=1617 ''Shanghai: Investitionen im Netz bleiben aus'', Meldung auf www.trolleymotion.ch vom 12. November 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In September 2010, Chinese automobile company [[BYD Auto]] began manufacturing the [[BYD K9]].
* In 2011, bus manufacturer Contrac Cobus Industries from Wiesbaden announced the Cobus 2500e.
* In autumn 2012, Czech manufacturer Inmod supplied a [[Lithium iron phosphate battery|LiFePo]]-powered SOR type EBN 8 to [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], Germany. The eight-meter-long vehicle has 22 seats, 35 standing places and a range of 160-170 kilometers a day, up to 220–260&amp;nbsp;km can be extended. The bus is recharged with a quick charger twice a day for one hour. Its maximum speed is 80&amp;nbsp;km/h.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inmod.de/de/technologie/inmod_bus ''Der SOR-Elektrobus'' auf www.inmod.de] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150228104552/http://www.inmod.de/de/technologie/inmod_bus |date=February 28, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Beginning in 2012, the Wiener Linien on bus routes 2A and 3A use electric buses. They are charged to the end user via a pantograph, which is applied to short catenary pieces. These are fed by the tram catenary. The cars have a range of around 150 kilometers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wien.orf.at/news/stories/2549394/ ''Elektrobusse ab 2013 in der City.''] auf wien.orf.at, retrieved, 10 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In May 2013, a battery bus began running between the airport and [[Palexpo]] in [[Geneva|Geneva, Switzerland]]. This bus can be partially charged within 15 seconds. At the end of the line the charging process takes three to four minutes. The project cost five million francs.&lt;ref name="Dossier-presse"&gt;[http://www.tosa2013.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Dossier-de-presse-TOSA-bus-electrique-19-avril1.pdf DOSSIER DE PRESSE AVRIL 2013, TOSA] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150829195144/http://www.tosa2013.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Dossier-de-presse-TOSA-bus-electrique-19-avril1.pdf |date=2015-08-29 }} (PDF; 543&amp;nbsp;kB)&lt;/ref&gt;

With careful design the pressure in the high velocity airstream can be lower than atmospheric pressure. This can cause a net force on the object in the direction normal to the side with lower local pressure. A Bernoulli gripper takes advantage of this by maintaining a positive pressure at the gripper face compared to the ambient pressure, while maintaining an air gap between the gripper and the object being held.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2096">[[Image:Busemann biplane (with pressure plot).png|thumb|350px|Busemann's biplane operating at design point]]
'''Busemann's Biplane''' is a conceptual [[airframe]] design invented by [[Adolf Busemann]] which avoids the formation of N-type [[shock wave]]s and thus does not create a [[sonic boom]].

It consists of two triangular cross-section plates a certain distance apart, with the flat sides parallel to the fluid flow. The spacing between the plates is sufficiently large that the flow does not [[Choked flow|choke]] and supersonic flow is maintained between them.

Usually with supersonic flow a positive pressure shock wave is generated at the front and a negative pressure shock wave at the rear. In Busemann's biplane, the high pressure shock wave is created internally and reflects symmetrically between the two plates. This cancels/fills the expansion fan forming at the rear, leaving no external shock waves to propagate to infinity. The flat upper and lower surfaces generate no shock waves because the flow is parallel.

{{Electromagnetism|cTopic=Electrostatics}}

'''Coulomb's law''', or '''Coulomb's inverse-square law''', is a [[physical law|law]] of [[physics]] for quantifying the amount of force with which stationary [[electric charge|electrically charged]] particles repel or attract each other. In its [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] form, the law is:

:&lt;math&gt;F=k_e\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''k''{{sub|''e''}} is [[Coulomb's constant]] (''k''{{sub|''e''}} ≈ {{val|9e9|u=N m{{sup|2}} C{{sup|−2}}}}), ''q''{{sub|1}} and ''q''{{sub|2}} are the signed magnitudes of the charges, and the scalar ''r'' is the distance between the charges. The force of the interaction between the charges is attractive if the charges have opposite signs (i.e., ''F'' is negative) and repulsive if like-signed (i.e., ''F'' is positive).

The law was first published in 1785 by French physicist [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]] and was essential to the development of the [[classical electromagnetism|theory of electromagnetism]]. Being an [[inverse-square law]], it is analogous to [[Isaac Newton]]'s inverse-square [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of universal gravitation]]. Coulomb's law can be used to derive [[Gauss's law]], and vice versa. The law has been [[tests of electromagnetism|tested extensively]], and all observations have upheld the laws of Newton.

Ancient cultures around the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] knew that certain objects, such as rods of [[amber]], could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. [[Thales of Miletus]] made a series of observations on [[static electricity]] around 600 BC, from which he believed that [[friction]] rendered amber [[magnetic]], in contrast to minerals such as [[magnetite]], which needed no rubbing.&lt;ref name=stewart&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Thales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between [[magnetism]] and [[electricity]]. Electricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] made a careful study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the [[lodestone]] effect from [[static electricity]] produced by rubbing amber.&lt;ref name=stewart/&gt; He coined the [[New Latin]] word ''electricus'' ("of amber" or "like amber", from {{lang|grc|ἤλεκτρον}} [''elektron''], the Greek word for "amber") to refer to the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed.&lt;ref&gt;

Early investigators of the 18th century who suspected that the electrical force diminished with distance as the [[force]] of [[gravity]] did (i.e., as the inverse square of the distance) included [[Daniel Bernoulli]]&lt;ref&gt;

Based on experiments with [[electrically charged]] spheres, [[Joseph Priestley]] of England was among the first to propose that electrical force followed an [[inverse-square law]], similar to [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]]. However, he did not generalize or elaborate on this.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1769, Scottish physicist [[John Robison (physicist)|John Robison]] announced that, according to his measurements, the force of repulsion between two spheres with charges of the same sign varied as {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;−2.06&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;

On [https://books.google.com/books?id=8pRDAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 73], the author states the force between spheres of like charge varies as x&lt;sup&gt;−2.06&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The result of the whole was, that the mutual repulsion of two spheres, electrified positively or negatively, was very nearly in the inverse proportion of the squares of the distances of their centres, or rather in a proportion somewhat greater, approaching to x&lt;sup&gt;−2.06&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;When making experiments with charged spheres of opposite charge the results were similar, as stated on [https://books.google.com/books?id=8pRDAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 73]:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;When the experiments were repeated with balls having opposite electricities, and which therefore attracted each other, the results were not altogether so regular and a few irregularities amounted to {{frac|6}} of the whole; but these anomalies were as often on one side of the medium as on the other. This series of experiments gave a result which deviated as little as the former (or rather less) from the inverse duplicate ratio of the distances; but the deviation was in defect as the other was in excess.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Nonetheless, on [https://books.google.com/books?id=8pRDAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA74#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 74] the author infers that the actual action is related exactly to the inverse duplicate of the distance:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;We therefore think that it may be concluded, that the action between two spheres is exactly in the inverse duplicate ratio of the distance of their centres, and that this difference between the observed attractions and repulsions is owing to some unperceived cause in the form of the experiment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;On [https://books.google.com/books?id=8pRDAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 75], the authour compares the electric and gravitational forces:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore we may conclude, that the law of electric attraction and repulsion is similar to that of gravitation, and that each of those forces diminishes in the same proportion that the square of the distance between the particles increases.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1770s, the dependence of the force between charged bodies upon both distance and charge had already been discovered, but not published, by [[Henry Cavendish]] of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Maxwell |editor-first=James Clerk |title=The Electrical Researches of the Honourable Henry Cavendish... |url=https://archive.org/stream/electricalresear00caveuoft |edition=1st |origyear=1879 |year=1967 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, England |pages=104–113 |chapter=Experiments on Electricity: Experimental determination of the law of electric force. |chapterurl=https://archive.org/stream/electricalresear00caveuoft#page/104/mode/2up}}&lt;br /&gt;On [https://archive.org/stream/electricalresear00caveuoft#page/111/mode/2up pages 111 and 112] the author states:&lt;blockquote&gt;We may therefore conclude that the electric attraction and repulsion must be inversely as some power of the distance between that of the 2 + {{frac|50}} th and that of the 2 − {{frac|50}} th, and there is no reason to think that it differs at all from the inverse duplicate ratio.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, in 1785, the French physicist [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]] published his first three reports of electricity and magnetism where he stated his law. This publication was essential to the development of the [[classical electromagnetism|theory of electromagnetism]].&lt;ref name="1785a"/&gt; He used a [[torsion balance]] to study the repulsion and attraction forces of [[charged particle]]s, and determined that the magnitude of the electric force between two [[point charge]]s is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

The torsion balance consists of a bar suspended from its middle by a thin fiber. The fiber acts as a very weak [[torsion spring]]. In Coulomb's experiment, the torsion balance was an [[Insulator (electricity)|insulating]] rod with a [[metal]]-coated ball attached to one end, suspended by a [[silk]] thread. The ball was charged with a known charge of [[static electricity]], and a second charged ball of the same polarity was brought near it. The two charged balls repelled one another, twisting the fiber through a certain angle, which could be read from a scale on the [[scientific instrument|instrument]]. By knowing how much force it took to twist the fiber through a given angle, Coulomb was able to calculate the force between the balls and derive his inverse-square proportionality law.

== The law ==

Coulomb's law states that:

{{quote|The magnitude of the electrostatic [[force]] of attraction or repulsion  between two point [[electric charge|charges]] is directly proportional to the product  of the magnitudes of charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.&lt;ref name="1785a"&gt;Coulomb (1785a) [https://books.google.com/books?id=by5EAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA569#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Premier mémoire sur l’électricité et le magnétisme,"] ''Histoire de l’Académie Royale des Sciences'', pages 569-577 — Coulomb studied the repulsive force between bodies having electrical charges of the same sign:
{{quote|''Il résulte donc de ces trois essais, que l'action répulsive que les deux balles électrifées de la même nature d'électricité exercent l'une sur l'autre, suit la raison inverse du carré des distances.''

The force is along the straight line joining them. If the two charges have the same sign, the electrostatic force between them is repulsive; if they have different signs, the force between them is attractive.}}

[[Image:Coulombslaw.svg|center|A graphical representation of Coulomb's law]]

Coulomb's law can also be stated as a simple mathematical expression. The [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] and [[Vector space|vector]] forms of the mathematical equation are
:&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf F|=k_e{|q_1q_2|\over r^2}\qquad&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\qquad\mathbf F_1=k_e\frac{q_1q_2}{{|\mathbf r_{21}|}^2} \mathbf{\hat{r}}_{21},\qquad&lt;/math&gt; respectively,

where {{math|''k''{{sub|''e''}}}} is [[Coulomb's constant]] ({{math|''k''{{sub|''e''}}}}  = {{val|8.9875517873681764e9|u=N m{{sup|2}} C{{sup|−2}}}}), {{math|''q''{{sub|1}}}} and {{math|''q''{{sub|2}}}} are the signed magnitudes of the charges, the scalar {{math|''r''}} is the distance between the charges, the vector {{math|'''r'''{{sub|21}} {{=}} '''r'''{{sub|1}} − '''r'''{{sub|2}}}} is the vectorial distance between the charges, and {{math|'''r̂'''{{sub|21}} {{=}} {{sfrac|'''r'''{{sub|21}}|{{!}}'''r'''{{sub|21}}{{!}}}}}} (a unit vector pointing from {{math|''q''{{sub|2}}}} to {{math|''q''{{sub|1}}}}). The vector form of the equation calculates the force {{math|'''F'''{{sub|1}}}} applied on {{math|''q''{{sub|1}}}} by {{math|''q''{{sub|2}}}}. If {{math|'''r'''{{sub|12}}}} is used instead, then the effect on {{math|''q''{{sub|2}}}} can be found. It can be also calculated using [[Newton's third law]]: {{math|'''F'''{{sub|2}} {{=}} −'''F'''{{sub|1}}}}.

=== Units ===
When the [[electromagnetic theory]] is expressed using the [[International System of Units]], force is measured in [[Newton (unit)|newtons]], charge in [[coulomb]]s, and distance in [[metre]]s. Coulomb's constant is given by {{math|''k''{{sub|''e''}} {{=}} {{frac|4π''ε''{{sub|0}}}}}}. The constant {{math|''ε''{{sub|0}}}} is the [[electric constant]] (also known as "the absolute permittivity of free space") in C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; N&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. It should not be confused with {{math|''ε''{{sub|''r''}}}}, which is the dimensionless [[relative permittivity]] of the material in which the charges are immersed, or with their product {{math|''ε''{{sub|''a''}} {{=}} ''ε''{{sub|0}}''ε''{{sub|''r''}} }}, which is called "[[absolute permittivity]] of the material" and is still used in [[electrical engineering]].

The [[SI derived units]] for the electric field are [[volt]]s per meter, newtons per coulomb, or [[tesla (unit)|tesla]] meters per second.

Coulomb's law and [[Coulomb's constant]] can also be interpreted in various terms:
* [[Atomic units]]. In atomic units the force is expressed in [[hartree]]s per [[Bohr radius]], the charge in terms of the [[elementary charge]], and the distances in terms of the ''Bohr radius''.
* [[Electrostatic units]] or [[Gaussian units]]. In electrostatic units and Gaussian units, the unit charge (''esu'' or [[statcoulomb]]) is defined in such a way that the Coulomb constant {{math|''k''}} disappears because it has the value of one and becomes [[dimensionless]].
* [[Lorentz–Heaviside units]] (also called ''rationalized''). In Lorentz–Heaviside units the Coulomb constant is {{math|1=''k''{{sub|e}} = {{sfrac|4π}}}} and becomes [[dimensionless]].

[[Gaussian units]] and [[Lorentz–Heaviside units]], both of which are [[Centimetre–gram–second system of units|CGS unit systems]], are often preferred in the treatment of electromagnetism as they greatly simplify formulas.&lt;ref name="electro"&gt;

=== Electric field===
[[File:Electric field one charge changing.gif|thumb|If two charges have the same sign, the electrostatic force between them is repulsive; if they have different sign, the force between them is attractive.]]

An electric field is a [[vector field]] that associates to each point in space the Coulomb force experienced by a [[Test particle#Test particles in plasma physics or electrodynamics|test charge]]. In the simplest case, the field is considered to be generated solely by a single source [[point charge]]. The strength and direction of the Coulomb force {{math|'''F'''}} on a test charge {{math|''q''{{sub|t}}}} depends on the electric field {{math|'''E'''}} that it finds itself in, such that {{math|'''F''' {{=}} ''q''{{sub|t}}'''E'''}}. If the field is generated by a positive source point charge {{math|''q''}}, the direction of the electric field points along lines directed radially outwards from it, i.e. in the direction that a positive point test charge {{math|''q''{{sub|t}}}} would move if placed in the field. For a negative point source charge, the direction is radially inwards.

The magnitude of the electric field {{math|'''E'''}} can be derived from [[Coulomb's law#The law|Coulomb's law]]. By choosing one of the point charges to be the source, and the other to be the test charge, it follows from Coulomb's law that the magnitude of the [[electric field]] {{math|'''E'''}} created by a single source [[point charge]] {{math|''q''}} at a certain distance from it {{math|''r''}} in vacuum is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;|\boldsymbol{E}|={1\over4\pi\varepsilon_0}{|q|\over r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Coulomb's constant===
{{main article|Coulomb's constant}}

Coulomb's constant is a proportionality factor that appears in Coulomb's law as well as in other electric-related formulas. Denoted {{math|''k''{{sub|''e''}}}}, it is also called the electric force constant or electrostatic constant, hence the subscript {{math|''e''}}.

The exact value of Coulomb's constant is:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
k_e &amp;= \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}=\frac{c_0^2\mu_0}{4\pi}=c_0^2\times 10^{-7}\ \mathrm{H\cdot m}^{-1}\\
 &amp;= 8.987\,551\,787\,368\,176\,4\times 10^9\ \mathrm{N\cdot m^2\cdot C}^{-2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Limitations===

There are three conditions to be fulfilled for the validity of Coulomb's law:
# '''The charges must have a spherically symmetric distribution (e.g. be point charges, or a charged metal sphere).'''
# '''The charges must not overlap (e.g. they must be distinct point charges).'''
# '''The charges must be stationary with respect to each other.'''

The last of these is the most important - it is known as the [[electrostatics#Electrostatic approximation|electrostatic approximation]]. When movement takes place, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]] must be taken into consideration, and a result, an extra factor is introduced, which alters the force produced on the two objects. This extra part of the force is called the [[magnetic]] force, and is described by [[magnetic field]]s. For slow movement, the magnetic force is minimal and Coulomb's law can still be considered approximately correct, but when the charges are moving more quickly in relation to each other, the full [[electrodynamics|electrodynamic]] rules (incorporating the magnetic force) must be considered.

===Quantum field theory origin===
{{unsourced|subsection|date=February 2018}}
[[File:Feynman diagram - Moller scattering 1.svg|thumb|The most basic Feynman diagram for QED interaction between two fermions]]
In simple terms, the [[Coulomb potential]] derives from the [[Quantum Electrodynamics|QED]] Lagrangian as follows. The [[Lagrangian (field theory)#Quantum electrodynamic Lagrangian|Lagrangian]] of quantum electrodynamics is normally written in [[natural units]], but in SI units, it is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{QED} = \bar{\psi} ( i\hbar c \gamma^\mu D_\mu - m c^2) \psi - \frac{1}{4 \hbar c}F_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu}&lt;/math&gt;

where the covariant derivative (in SI units) is:

:&lt;math&gt;{D}_\mu = \partial_\mu + \frac{i g}{\hbar c} A_\mu&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the [[coupling constant#gauge coupling|gauge coupling parameter]]. By putting the covariant derivative into the lagrangian explicitly, the interaction term (the term involving both &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;) is seen to be:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{int} = i g \bar{\psi} \gamma^\mu A_\mu \psi&lt;/math&gt;

The most basic [[Feynman diagram]] for a QED interaction between two [[fermion]]s is the exchange of a single photon, with no loops. Following the [[Feynman rules]], this therefore contributes two QED vertex factors (&lt;math&gt;i g Q \gamma_\mu&lt;/math&gt;) to the potential, where Q is the QED-[[Charge (physics)#abstract definition|charge operator]] (Q gives the charge in terms of the electron charge, and hence is exactly -1 for electrons, etc.). For the photon in the diagram, the Feynman rules demand the contribution of one bosonic massless [[propagator]] (&lt;math&gt;\frac{\hbar c}{k^2}&lt;/math&gt;). Ignoring the momentum on the external legs (the fermions), the potential is therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{r})=\frac{1}{(2\pi)^3} \int e^{(\frac {i\mathbf{k \cdot r}}{\hbar})}
(i Q_1 g^2 \gamma_\mu)(i Q_2 g^2 \gamma_\nu)(\frac{\hbar c}{k^2}) \;d^3k&lt;/math&gt;

which can be more usefully written as

:&lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{r})= \frac{- g^2 \hbar c Q_1 Q_2}{4 \pi} \frac{1}{(2\pi)^3} \int e^{(\frac {i\mathbf{k \cdot r}}{\hbar})}
\frac {4\pi \eta_{\mu\nu} }{k^2} \;d^3k&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt; is the QED-charge on the ith particle. Recognising the integral as just being a [[Fourier transform]] enables the equation to be simplified:

:&lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{r})= \frac{- g^2 \hbar c Q_1 Q_2 }{4 \pi} \frac{1}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

For various reasons, it is more convenient to define the [[fine-structure constant]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{g^2}{4 \pi}&lt;/math&gt;, and then define &lt;math&gt;e = \sqrt{4 \pi \alpha \varepsilon_0 \hbar c }&lt;/math&gt;. Re-arranging these definitions gives:

:&lt;math&gt;g^2 \hbar c = \frac{e^2}{\varepsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt;

It is worth noting that &lt;math&gt;g = e&lt;/math&gt; in natural units (since, in those units, &lt;math&gt;\hbar = 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c = 1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;). Continuing in SI units, the potential is therefore

:&lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{r})= \frac{- e^2 }{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{Q_1 Q_2}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

Defining &lt;math&gt;q_i = e Q_i&lt;/math&gt;, as the macroscopic 'electric charge', makes e the macroscopic 'electric charge' for an electron, and enables the formula to be put into the familiar form of the Coulomb potential:

:&lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf{r})= \frac{-1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{q_1 q_2}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

The force (&lt;math&gt;\frac{dV(\mathbf{r})}{dr}&lt;/math&gt;) is therefore :

:&lt;math&gt;F(\mathbf{r})=\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The derivation makes clear that the force law is only an approximation — it ignores the momentum of the input and output fermion lines, and ignores all quantum corrections (ie. the myriad possible diagrams with internal loops).

The Coulomb potential, and its derivation, can be seen as a special case of the [[Yukawa potential]] (specifically, the case where the exchanged boson - the photon - has no rest mass).

==Scalar form==
[[Image:CoulombsLaw.svg|thumb|right|The absolute value of the force {{math|'''F'''}} between two [[point charge]]s {{math|''q''}} and {{math|''Q''}} relates to the distance between the point charges and to the simple product of their charges. The diagram shows that like charges repel each other, and opposite charges mutually attract.]]

When it is of interest to know the magnitude of the electrostatic force (and not its direction), it may be easiest to consider a scalar version of the law. The [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar form]] of Coulomb's Law relates the magnitude and sign of the electrostatic force {{math|'''F'''}} acting simultaneously on two point charges {{math|''q''{{sub|1}}}} and {{math|''q''{{sub|2}}}} as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;|\boldsymbol{F}|=k_e{|q_1q_2|\over r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''r''}} is the separation distance and {{math|''k''{{sub|''e''}}}} is Coulomb's constant. If the product {{math|''q''{{sub|1}}''q''{{sub|2}}}} is positive, the force between the two charges is repulsive; if the product is negative, the force between them is attractive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/elefor.html#c1 Coulomb's law], Hyperphysics&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vector form==
[[Image:Coulombslaw.svg|thumb|right|350px|A graphical representation of Coulomb's law.|In the image, the vector {{math|'''F'''{{sub|1}}}} is the force experienced by {{math|''q''{{sub|1}}}}, and the vector {{math|'''F'''{{sub|2}}}} is the force experienced by {{math|''q''{{sub|2}}}}. When {{math|''q''{{sub|1}}''q''{{sub|2}} &gt; 0}} the forces are repulsive (as in the image) and when {{math|''q''{{sub|1}}''q''{{sub|2}} &lt; 0}} the forces are attractive (opposite to the image). The magnitude of the forces will always be equal.]]

Coulomb's law states that the electrostatic force {{math|'''F'''{{sub|1}}}} experienced by a charge, {{math|''q''{{sub|1}}}} at position {{math|'''r'''{{sub|1}}}}, in the vicinity of another charge, {{math|''q''{{sub|2}}}} at position {{math|'''r'''{{sub|2}}}}, in a vacuum is equal to:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{F_1}={q_1q_2\over4\pi\varepsilon_0}{(\boldsymbol{r_1-r_2})\over|\boldsymbol{r_1-r_2}|^3}={q_1q_2\over4\pi\varepsilon_0}{\boldsymbol{\hat{r}_{21}}\over |\boldsymbol{r_{21}}|^2},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''r'''{{sub|21}} {{=}} '''r'''{{sub|1}} − '''r'''{{sub|2}}}}, the unit vector {{math|'''r̂'''{{sub|21}} {{=}} {{sfrac|'''r'''{{sub|21}}|{{!}}'''r'''{{sub|21}}{{!}}}}}}, and {{math|''ε''{{sub|0}}}} is the [[electric constant]].

The vector form of Coulomb's law is simply the scalar definition of the law with the direction given by the [[unit vector]], {{math|'''r̂'''{{sub|21}}}}, parallel with the line ''from'' charge {{math|''q''{{sub|2}}}} ''to'' charge {{math|''q''{{sub|1}}}}.&lt;ref name="uTexas"&gt;[http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/em/lectures/node28.html Coulomb's law], University of Texas&lt;/ref&gt; If both charges have the same [[Plus and minus signs|sign]] (like charges) then the [[Scalar multiplication|product]] {{math|''q''{{sub|1}}''q''{{sub|2}}}} is positive and the direction of the force on {{math|''q''{{sub|1}}}} is given by {{math|'''r̂'''{{sub|21}}}}; the charges repel each other. If the charges have opposite signs then the product {{math|''q''{{sub|1}}''q''{{sub|2}}}} is negative and the direction of the force on {{math|''q''{{sub|1}}}} is given by {{math|−'''r̂'''{{sub|21}} {{=}} '''r̂'''{{sub|12}}}}; the charges attract each other.

The electrostatic force {{math|'''F'''{{sub|2}}}} experienced by {{math|''q''{{sub|2}}}}, according to [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's third law]], is {{math|'''F'''{{sub|2}} {{=}} −'''F'''{{sub|1}}}}.

===System of discrete charges===
The [superposition principle|law of superposition] allows Coulomb's law to be extended to include any number of point charges. The force acting on a point charge due to a system of point charges is simply the [[vector addition]] of the individual forces acting alone on that point charge due to each one of the charges. The resulting force vector is parallel to the [[electric field]] vector at that point, with that point charge removed.

The force {{math|'''F'''}} on a small charge {{math|''q''}} at position {{math|'''r'''}}, due to a system of {{math|''N''}} discrete charges in vacuum is:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{F(r)}={q\over4\pi\varepsilon_0}\sum_{i=1}^Nq_i{\boldsymbol{r-r_i}\over|\boldsymbol{r-r_i}|^3}={q\over4\pi\varepsilon_0}\sum_{i=1}^Nq_i{\boldsymbol{\widehat{R_i}}\over|\boldsymbol{R_i}|^2},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''q''{{sub|''i''}}}} and {{math|'''r'''{{sub|''i''}}}} are the magnitude and position respectively of the {{math|''i''}}th charge, {{math|'''R̂'''{{sub|''i''}}}} is a unit vector in the direction of {{math|'''R'''{{sub|''i''}} {{=}} '''r''' − '''r'''{{sub|''i''}}}} (a vector pointing from charges {{math|''q''{{sub|''i''}}}} to {{math|''q''}}).&lt;ref name="uTexas"/&gt;

===Continuous charge distribution===
In this case, the principle of [[linear superposition]] is also used. For a continuous charge distribution, an [[integral]] over the region containing the charge is equivalent to an infinite summation, treating each [[infinitesimal]] element of space as a point charge {{math|''dq''}}. The distribution of charge is usually linear, surface or volumetric.

For a linear charge distribution (a good approximation for charge in a wire) where {{math|''λ''('''r′''')}} gives the charge per unit length at position {{math|'''r′'''}}, and {{math|''dl′''}} is an infinitesimal element of length,

:&lt;math&gt;dq = \lambda(\boldsymbol{r'})dl'&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dev.physicslab.org/Document.aspx?doctype=3&amp;filename=Electrostatics_ContinuousChargedRod.xml Charged rods], PhysicsLab.org&lt;/ref&gt;

For a surface charge distribution (a good approximation for charge on a plate in a parallel plate [[capacitor]]) where {{math|''σ''('''r′''')}} gives the charge per unit area at position {{math|'''r′'''}}, and {{math|''dA′''}} is an infinitesimal element of area,

:&lt;math&gt;dq = \sigma(\boldsymbol{r'})\,dA'.&lt;/math&gt;

For a volume charge distribution (such as charge within a bulk metal) where {{math|''ρ''('''r′''')}} gives the charge per unit volume at position {{math|'''r′'''}}, and {{math|''dV′''}} is an infinitesimal element of volume,

:&lt;math&gt;dq = \rho(\boldsymbol{r'})\,dV'.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="uTexas"/&gt;

The force on a small test charge {{math|''q′''}} at position {{math|'''r'''}} in vacuum is given by the integral over the distribution of charge:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{F} = {q'\over 4\pi\varepsilon_0}\int dq {\boldsymbol{r} - \boldsymbol{r'} \over |\boldsymbol{r} - \boldsymbol{r'}|^3}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Simple experiment to verify Coulomb's law ==

[[File:Verificacion ley coulomb.png|framed|250px|thumb|Experiment to verify Coulomb's law.]]

It is possible to verify Coulomb's law with a simple experiment. Consider two small spheres of mass {{math|''m''}} and same-sign charge {{math|''q''}}, hanging from two ropes of negligible mass of length {{math|''l''}}. The forces acting on each sphere are three: the weight {{math|''mg''}}, the rope tension {{math|''T''}} and the electric force {{math|''F''}}.

In the equilibrium state:
{{NumBlk||
:&lt;math&gt;T \ \sin \theta_1 =F_1 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

and:
{{NumBlk||
:&lt;math&gt;T \ \cos \theta_1 =mg \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

Dividing ({{EquationNote|1}}) by ({{EquationNote|2}}):
{{NumBlk||
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\sin \theta_1}{\cos \theta_1 }=
\frac {F_1}{mg}\Rightarrow F_1= mg \tan \theta_1 &lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

Let {{math|''L''{{sub|1}}}} be the distance between the charged spheres; the repulsion force between them {{math|''F''{{sub|1}}}}, assuming Coulomb's law is correct, is equal to
{{NumBlk||
&lt;math&gt; F_1 = \frac{q^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 L_1^2}&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|Coulomb's law}}}}

so:
{{NumBlk||
&lt;math&gt;\frac{q^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 L_1^2}=mg \tan \theta_1 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

If we now discharge one of the spheres, and we put it in contact with the charged sphere, each one of them acquires a charge {{math|{{sfrac|''q''|2}}}}. In the equilibrium state, the distance between the charges will be {{math|''L''{{sub|2}} &lt; ''L''{{sub|1}}}} and the repulsion force between them will be:
{{NumBlk||
:&lt;math&gt;F_2 = \frac{{(\frac{q}{2})}^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 L_2^2}=\frac{\frac{q^2}{4}}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 L_2^2} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|5}}}}

We know that {{math|''F''{{sub|2}} {{=}} ''mg'' tan ''θ''{{sub|2}}}}. And:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\frac{q^2}{4}}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 L_2^2}=mg \tan \theta_2&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing ({{EquationNote|4}}) by ({{EquationNote|5}}), we get: 
{{NumBlk||
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\left( \cfrac{q^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 L_1^2} \right)}{\left(\cfrac{\frac{q^2}{4}}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 L_2^2}\right)}=
\frac{mg \tan \theta_1}{mg \tan \theta_2}
\Rightarrow 4 {\left ( \frac {L_2}{L_1} \right ) }^2= 
\frac{ \tan \theta_1}{ \tan \theta_2}&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|6}}}}

Measuring the angles {{math|''θ''{{sub|1}}}} and {{math|''θ''{{sub|2}}}} and the distance between the charges {{math|''L''{{sub|1}}}} and {{math|''L''{{sub|2}}}} is sufficient to verify that the equality is true taking into account the experimental error. In practice, angles can be difficult to measure, so if the length of the ropes is sufficiently great, the angles will be small enough to make the following approximation:
{{NumBlk||
:&lt;math&gt;\tan \theta \approx \sin \theta= \frac{\frac{L}{2}}{l}=\frac{L}{2l} \Rightarrow \frac{ \tan \theta_1}{ \tan \theta_2}\approx \frac{\frac{L_1}{2l}}{\frac{L_2}{2l}}&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|7}}}}

Using this approximation, the relationship ({{EquationNote|6}}) becomes the much simpler expression:
{{NumBlk||
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\frac{L_1}{2l}}{\frac{L_2}{2l}}\approx 4 {\left ( \frac {L_2}{L_1} \right ) }^2 \Rightarrow \,\!&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\frac{L_1}{L_2}\approx 4 {\left ( \frac {L_2}{L_1} \right ) }^2 \Rightarrow \frac{L_1}{L_2}\approx\sqrt[3]{4} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|8}}}}

In this way, the verification is limited to measuring the distance between the charges and check that the division approximates the theoretical value.

==Atomic forces==
{{see also|Coulomb explosion}}
Coulomb's law holds even within [[atom]]s, correctly describing the [[force]] between the positively charged [[atomic nucleus]] and each of the negatively charged [[electron]]s. This simple law also correctly accounts for the forces that bind atoms together to form [[molecule]]s and for the forces that bind atoms and molecules together to form solids and liquids. Generally, as the distance between [[ion]]s increases, the force of attraction, and binding energy, approach zero and [[ionic bonding]] is less favorable. As the magnitude of opposing charges increases, energy increases and ionic bonding is more favorable.

The '''''Dos Bocas'' oil fire''' was a 1908 [[blowout (well drilling)|blowout]] and [[oil fire]] that took place in [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz, Mexico]]. The fire started after a blowout occurred, causing [[crude oil]] to make contact with the flames that powered the [[oil derrick]]. The fire continued from 4 July 1908 to 30 August 1908, when the oil deposit was burnt out. For the nearly two months that the fire burned, nearly {{convert|90000|oilbbl}} of oil flowed into the surrounding landscape each day. Ultimately, the ''Dos Bocas'' blowout (named for the two gaping black holes it left it the ground - "two mouths") ended up being one of the largest oil spills in the history of the oil industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = An Environmental History of Latin America|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=p21VdbT7qAMC|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 2007-09-10|isbn = 9780521848534|language = en|first = Shawn William|last = Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two large craters formed in the ground around the oil well were caused by the pressure of the oilfield.

==Design philosophy==
As opposed to developing [[hybrid vehicle]]s like [[Toyota Prius|Prius]], Ford of Europe took a different design philosophy: to create vehicles that are as fuel efficient as possible, without compromising driving experience. The resultant ECOnetic range focuses on improved design and refinement of existing technology, focusing on three main streams of improvement:&lt;ref name=AutoTrade37521/&gt;
*'''Aerodynamics:''' models have a redesigned front bumper skirt, which are more aerodynamic, and reduces drag further through use of a smaller lower grill. The car is then lowered on its suspension to improve angle of address to the air, in the case of the Focus by {{convert|10|mm}} on the front, and {{convert|8|mm}} on the rear. To the side, skirts are introduced together with [[hubcap]]s designed to improve airflow. A new and extended rear spoiler reduces rear drag
*'''Resistance:''' Ford worked with [[Michelin]] to create a thinner tyre with lower rolling resistance. The engine's bearings are replaced with lower-resistance versions
*'''Efficiency:''' engineers re-mapped the 1.6-litre [[Ford Duratorq engine|Duratorq TDCi]] engine, equipped with a coated [[Diesel particulate filter|Diesel Particulate Filter]] (cDPF), and recalibrated the power steering system. The ECOnetic was the first Ford car to use low-friction transmission oil, which is now uniform on all 1.6-litre diesel European-produced Fords. The 2012 Focus version has a six-speed gearbox, with sixth gear an [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]].

==Models==
First announced in late-2007, Ford proposed ECOnetic models in the Fiesta, Focus and [[Ford Mondeo|Mondeo]] ranges. The first cars were available to order from dealers in early 2008, priced at £250 above the "Style" models. Delivered to [[United Kingdom]] from April 2008, the models was in the lowest bracket of [[Vehicle Excise Duty]] and exempt form the [[London Congestion Charge]].&lt;ref name=AutoTrade37521&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.autotrader.co.uk/EDITORIAL/CARS/news/FORD/37521.html| title=New Ford Focus: what is 'Econetic'?| publisher=[[Auto Trader Group|Auto Trader]]| date=8 November 2007| accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second generation Fiesta ECOnetic was launched at the 2008 [[British International Motor Show]]. To encourage drivers to be efficient, a green upwards arrow-shaped indicator light within the dashboard's rev counter signals to the driver when to change up to a higher gear for optimum fuel efficiency and thus economy, later also introduced to the Focus model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.autotrader.co.uk/EDITORIAL/CARS/news/FORD/Ford_Fiesta_ECOnetic_UKs_greenest_car.html| title=Ford Fiesta ECOnetic – UK’s greenest car| publisher=Auto Trader| date=23 July 2008| accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ford_Focus_(third_generation)#ECOnetic|2012 Focus ECOnetic]] model includes: Smart Regenerative Charging to reduce alternator resistance; [[Start-stop system|Auto-Start-Stop]]; electrically operated front grille shutter, to improve high speed aerodynamics.&lt;ref name=ECO&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://www.ford.co.uk/experience-ford/AboutFord/News/VehicleNews/2009/FocusEconeticStart| title=Frugal new Ford Focus ECOnetic uses Auto-Start-Stop to achieve 99g/km CO2 and 74.2mpg| publisher=Ford Motor Company| date=16 September 2009 |accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.autotrader.co.uk/articles/2011/04/cars/ford/focus/ford-focus-econetic-80mpg| title=Ford Focus ECOnetic: 80mpg| publisher=Auto Trader| date=7 April 2011| accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==North America==
It is not presently planned to introduce ECOnetic models to the [[North America]]n market, because, as ''[[Business Week]]'' noted, the company "doesn't believe it could charge enough to make money on an imported ECOnetic" and doesn't think it would sell enough of the model (350,000/year) to justify the $350 million in upgrades required at their Mexico plant to manufacture it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kiley |first=David |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_37/b4099060491065.htm |title=The 65 mpg Ford the U.S. Can't Have |work=[[Bloomberg BusinessWeek]] |date=4 September 2008 |accessdate=2009-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428225335/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_37/b4099060491065.htm |archivedate=28 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4893">'''Electrical network frequency''' ('''ENF''') '''analysis''' is a [[forensic science]] technique for validating [[audio recording]]s by comparing frequency changes in background [[mains hum]] in the recording with long-term high-precision historical records of [[mains frequency]] changes from a database. In effect the mains hum signal is treated as if it were a time-dependent [[digital watermark]] that can help identify when the recording was created, and help detect any edits in the recording.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, A.J: {{cite web|url=http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=14411|title=The electric network frequency (ENF) as an aid to authenticating forensic digital audio recordings – an automated approach}}, Conference paper, AES 33rd International Conference, USA (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grigoras, C. : {{cite web|url=http://www.equinoxjournals.com/IJSLL/article/viewArticle/525|title=Digital audio recording analysis – the electric network frequency criterion}}, International Journal of Speech Language and the Law, vol. 12, no. 1, pp. 63–76 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mateusz Kajstura, Agata Trawinska, Jacek Hebenstreit. {{cite web|url=http://www.fsijournal.org/article/S0379-0738%2804%2900766-2/abstract|title=Application of the Electrical Network Frequency (ENF) Criterion: A case of a digital recording}} Forensic Science International, Volume 155, Issue 2, Pages 165–171 (20 December 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Historical records of mains frequency changes are kept on record, e.g., by police in the German federal state of [[Bavaria]] since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/landeskriminalamt-dem-verbrechen-auf-der-spur-1.1061222-2|title=Dem Verbrechen auf der Spur|language=german|publisher=Süddeutsche Zeitung|date=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology has been hailed as "the most significant development in [[audio forensics]] since [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/06/01/enf_met_police/|title=Met lab claims 'biggest breakthrough since Watergate'|author=Chris Williams|publisher=[[The Register]]|date=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to a paper by Huijbregtse and Geradts, the ENF technique, although powerful, has significant limitations caused by ambiguity based on fixed frequency offsets during recording, and [[self-similarity]] within the mains frequency database, particularly for recordings shorter than 10 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Maarten Huijbregtse, Zeno Geradts. {{cite web|url=http://www.forensic.to/ENF%20processed.pdf|title=Using the ENF criterion for determining the time of recording of short digital audio recordings}} Lecture Notes in Computer Science; Vol. 5718, Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Computational Forensics, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, researchers demonstrated that indoor lights such as fluorescent lights and incandescent bulbs vary their light intensity in accordance with the voltage supplied, which in turn depends on the voltage supply frequency. As a result, the light intensity can carry the frequency fluctuation information to the visual sensor recordings in a similar way as the electromagnetic waves from the power transmission lines carry the ENF information to audio sensing mechanisms. Based on this result, researchers demonstrated that visual track from still video taken in indoor lighting environments also contain ENF traces that can be extracted by estimating the frequency at which ENF will appear in a video as low sampling frequency of video (25–30&amp;nbsp;Hz) cause significant aliasing.&lt;ref&gt;Garg Ravi, Varna Avinash L., Wu Min: {{cite web|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2072303|title="Seeing" ENF: natural time stamp for digital video via optical sensing and signal processing}}, Conference paper, in proceedings of the 19th international ACM Multimedia Conference, USA (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; It was also demonstrated in the same research that the ENF signatures from the visual stream and the ENF signature from the audio stream in a given video should match. As a result, the matching between the two signals can be used to determine if the audio and visual track were recorded together or superimposed later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garg |first=Ravi |title=Research Projects |url=http://www.ece.umd.edu/~ravig/Research.html |work=ece.umd.edu }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use by law enforcement ==
The distinctive electrical hums have been used to provide forensic verification of audio recordings, a process fully automated in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morelle|first1=Rebecca|title=The hum that helps to fight crime|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-20629671|accessdate=27 January 2017|date=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2262">An '''energy park''' is a separate area used and planned for the purpose of [[clean energy]] development, like [[Wind power|wind]] and [[solar energy|solar]] generation facilities.

Energy parks create many other economic development benefits too.  In [[Ohio]], energy parks are creating thousands of [[green job]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://communitycommon.com/view/full_story/6121736/article-Clean-Energy-Park-To-Cost-an-Estimated--11-Billion?instance=home_news_lead |title=Clean Energy Park To Cost an Estimated 11 Billion |publisher=Community Common |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303120153/http://communitycommon.com/view/full_story/6121736/article-Clean-Energy-Park-To-Cost-an-Estimated--11-Billion?instance=home_news_lead |archivedate=2012-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Minnesota, community wind parks are also popular.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juhlwind.com/wind_projects.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717001246/http://www.juhlwind.com/wind_projects.php |date=July 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In England, [[wind park]]s are commonly known as [[wind farm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westmill.coop/westmill_home.asp |title=Westmill Wind Farm |publisher=Westmill.coop |date=2009-07-01 |accessdate=2012-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026125558/http://www.westmill.coop/westmill_home.asp |archivedate=2012-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A more "lightweight" version of an energy park is a wind park or [[solar park]].  These have one type of clean energy generation, rather than two or more technologies, as in an energy park.  

Some energy parks feature additional features beyond clean energy generation.  Additional benefits include: green job creation, [[Smart grid]] connections, as well as new recreational, technology innovation and agricultural opportunities.  The Stamford Energy Park in Vermont is one example of an integrated energy park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southportpower.com/temp/stamfordenergypark.html |title=www.southportpower.com |publisher=www.southportpower.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building industry==
In building construction a framer is a [[carpenter]] who assembles the major structural elements of a wood-framed building called the [[Framing (construction)|framing]]. Framers build walls out of [[Wall stud|studs]], [[sill plate|sill]]s, and [[Post and lintel|headers]]; build floors from [[joist]]s and [[Beam (structure)|beam]]s; and frame roofs using ridge poles and [[rafter]]s. ''Timber framers'' are framers who work in the traditional style of [[timber framing]] with wooden joinery.

[[File:Muffe Eines Steigleitungsrohrs Detail.jpg|thumb|Hammer paint on a piece of pipe]]

'''Hammer paint''' (or hammered paint) is a special [[lacquer]] with a surface that looks like hammered metal when dried. It is also known as hammertone.

==Composition==
The slightly [[iridescent]] areas are caused by the different orientation of very small shiny particles which are [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] in the lacquer. These particles are often made of the mineral [[mica]]. Mica is chemically inactive and very resistant. Alternatively, [[aluminium]] or [[bronze]] powder may be used. To make the "hammered" effect more pronounced, a small percentage of [[silicone oil]] may be added directly before application.

==Purposes==
Hammer paint is often used to beautify technical apparatus and not so commonly as a protective coating. The optical advantage of hammer paint is that surfaces look acceptable even if the underlying surface is not flat and smooth. To get a regular paint to look smooth the surface would have to be prepared first, for example by [[spackling]], [[sanding]], [[Grinding_(abrasive_cutting) | grinding]] or [[polishing]]. With hammer paint, this step can be omitted. Some hammer paints (e.g. by [[Hammerite]]) are formulated to be usable directly on rusted steel without surface preparation other than brushing to remove the loose rust.

Beyond that, the resistance of the mica improves the durability of the paint job. The mica reduces aging by protecting the underlying binders from [[UV radiation]]. The mica also makes hammer paint relatively hard and scratch resistant.

'''Hurricane response''' is the [[disaster response]] after a [[Tropical cyclone|hurricane]].  This response encompasses assessment and repairs to buildings and infrastructure, removal of debris, and providing public health services.  Hurricane responders may be exposed to many hazards such as chemical and biological contaminants, and injuries from work activities.

== Activities ==
[[File:Alaska and California National Guard (29720699137).jpg|thumb|Personnel and equipment from the [[National Guard of the United States]] en route to [[Hurricane Florence]] response efforts in 2018|alt=Photograph of the inside of a cargo jet, containing people in military field uniforms, equipment, and trucks]]
Activities performed by hurricane responders include assessment, restoration, and demolition of buildings; removal of [[debris]] and waste; repairs to land-based and maritime [[infrastructure]]; and providing public health services including [[search and rescue]] operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/hurricane/sheets.html|title=OSHA's Hazard Exposure and Risk Assessment Matrix for Hurricane Response and Recovery Work: List of Activity Sheets|last=|first=|date=2005|website=U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]|language=EN-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maritime response activities include checking for submerged obstructions and updating nautical charts for affected port areas; aerial survey missions to assess damages to affected areas to provide information for emergency responders; identification and survey of vessels or containers that may be leaking hazardous materials; and assessment of environmental impacts of contaminants in coastal and estuarine waters, including the health risk of eating fish and shellfish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/hazards/hurricanes/|title=Hurricanes|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|language=EN-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurricane response requires coordination between federal, tribal, state, local, and private entities.  An [[Incident Command System]] is used in the United States to coordinate activities between entities involved in disaster response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aiha.org/publications-and-resources/HealthandSafetyIssuesinNaturalDisasters/Pages/Before-You-Begin.aspx|title=Before You Begin - The Incident Command System (ICS)|last=|first=|date=|website=American Industrial Hygiene Association|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the [[National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster]], potential response volunteers should affiliate with established organizations and should not self-deploy, so that proper training and support can be provided to mitigate the danger and stress of response work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nvoad.org/howtohelp/volunteer-3/|title=Volunteer|last=|first=|date=|website=[[National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster]]|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health and safety hazards ==

Hurricane responders may be exposed to chemical and biological contaminants.  These include [[sewage]] and stored industrial or household chemicals,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Corpse|human remains]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and [[Indoor mold|mold]] growth encouraged by flooding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aiha.org/publications-and-resources/HealthandSafetyIssuesinNaturalDisasters/Pages/Hazardous-Materials.aspx|title=Hazardous Materials and Conditions|last=|first=|date=|website=American Industrial Hygiene Association|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aiha.org/publications-and-resources/HealthandSafetyIssuesinNaturalDisasters/Pages/Mold-and-Other-Microbial-Growth.aspx|title=Mold and Other Microbial Growth|last=|first=|date=|website=American Industrial Hygiene Association|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Proper [[personal protective equipment]], possibly including [[Respirator|respirators]], can help mitigate these hazards.  In addition, [[Fire ant|fire ants]] are often disturbed during hurricanes and can float along in floodwaters, leading to the hazards of bites and stings.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/emres/pdfs/NIOSH-Emergency-Responder-Key-Messages.pdf|title=Hurricane Key Messages for Employers, Workers and Volunteers|last=|first=|date=2017|website=U.S. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Asbestos]] and [[lead]] may be present in older buildings,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/hurricane/recommendations.html#encounter|title=OSHA's Hazard Exposure and Risk Assessment Matrix for Hurricane Response and Recovery Work: Recommendations for General Hazards Commonly Encountered during Hurricane Response and Recovery Operations|last=|first=|date=2005|website=U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration|language=EN-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[radon]] may be a concern in some areas.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

Common injuries arise from [[Falling (accident)|falls]] from heights, such as from a ladder; trips, slips, and falls from level surfaces; and use of [[Chainsaw|chainsaws]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  There is a danger of [[electrocution]] from flooded areas, including from [[Backfeeding|backfeed]] from portable generators.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aiha.org/publications-and-resources/HealthandSafetyIssuesinNaturalDisasters/Pages/Electrical-Hazards-Floods.aspx|title=Electrical Hazards|last=|first=|date=|website=American Industrial Hygiene Association|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the use of generators, heaters, or stoves can lead to [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] if used indoors or close to an open window or air conditioner.  [[Road traffic safety|Motor vehicle safety]] is important as most responders ride in motor vehicles, or may be required to direct traffic.  Violence and [[looting]] is another hazard.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Injuries may also result from entering buildings with compromised structural integrity, [[Noise-induced hearing loss|noise]], unexpected start-up or release of stored energy by machines or equipment, impact to the eyes or face, [[Manual handling of loads|manual lifting]], [[Animal bite|animal bites]], [[List of poisonous plants|poisonous plants]], and [[sunburn]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Shift work|Long and irregular shifts]] may lead to [[sleep deprivation]] and [[fatigue]], increasing the risk of injuries.  Additionally, [[heat stress]] is a concern as workers are often exposed to hot and humid temperatures, wear protective clothing and equipment, and have physically difficult tasks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Heat stress may increase the risk of other injuries due to sweaty palms, fogged-up safety glasses, mental confusion, and dizziness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Pre-exposure and post-exposure [[Monitoring (medicine)|medical monitoring]] is recommended to establish fitness for and identify adverse effects from response work.  Workers may experience [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|mental stress associated with a traumatic incident]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Description==
The species was originally [[Species description|described]] by [[Ugolino Martelli]] from only a few [[drupe]]s in the collections of the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]]&lt;ref name="Martelli"/&gt;  He was hesitant to describe it as a new species from only that, but the characteristics were so salient he published his description.&lt;ref name="Martelli"/&gt;

The tree is [[dioecious]] (individual plants either have male flowers of female ones),&lt;ref name="Lim"/&gt; with male trees uncommon compared to females.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;  It reaches {{Convert|10-30|m|}} in height, with a grey [[Trunk (botany)|trunk]]&lt;ref name="Rose82"/&gt; of {{Convert|30|cm||abbr=off}} in diameter and supported by [[buttress root]]s.&lt;ref name="Lim"/&gt;  The trunk has white mottling and is generally smooth with occasional warts or small knobs as well as rings of [[leaf scar]]s.&lt;ref name="Stilltoe" /&gt;  Inside the trunk is pithy and lacking [[cambium]].&lt;ref name="Stilltoe" /&gt;  The top of the tree sometimes branches, producing three or four crowns of leaves.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;  Each crown will produce a single cluster of nuts, typically once every other season.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;  Production is affected by the seasonality of local rainfall.&lt;ref name="Bourke"/&gt;

[[Leaf|Leaves]] spiral up the trunk in [[Leaf#Arrangement on the stem|opposite]] pairs.&lt;ref name="Lim"/&gt;&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;  The large leathery leaves are {{Convert|3-4|m|}} long&lt;ref name="French"/&gt; and {{Convert|8-12|cm|}} wide.&lt;ref name="Lim" /&gt;  The apex of the leaf is [[Glossary of botanical terms#attenuate|attenuate]] and doubly-pleated, with [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|prickles]] pointing up at the tip&lt;ref name="Lim" /&gt; and along the [[leaf#margin|margins]] and [[midrib]].&lt;ref name="Rose82"/&gt;  The leaves are dark green on top and dull cyan underneath.&lt;ref name="Stilltoe" /&gt;

The [[inflorescence]] on male trees is a densely-branched [[Spadix (botany)|spadix]] with a dozen long spikes, each containing many [[staminate]] phalanges.&lt;ref name="Lim"/&gt;  In each phalange is a [[column]] 3&amp;nbsp;mm long topped by up to 9 [[subsessile]] [[anther]]s.&lt;ref name="Lim"/&gt;  The male flowers are white,&lt;ref name="French"/&gt; and the whole male flowering organ may be up to {{Convert|2|m|}} long.&lt;ref name="Stilltoe" /&gt;

The [[pollen]] has a [[psilate]] [[exine]] (unornamented outer wall) 0.8&amp;nbsp;μm thick.&lt;ref name="Haberle"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haberle |first1=Simon G. |title=Identification of cultivated ''Pandanus'' and ''Colocasia'' in pollen records and the implications for the study of early agriculture in New Guinea |journal=Vegetation History and Archaeobotany |date=November 1995 |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=195–210 |doi=10.1007/BF00235751 |language=English |issn=1617-6278 |oclc=192800152}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ornamentation is granular between [[echina]]e (short spines).&lt;ref name="Haberle"/&gt;  The [[wikt:ulcerate|ulcerate]] [[Aperture (botany)|aperture]] is 3&amp;nbsp;μm in diameter.&lt;ref name="Haberle"/&gt;  Pollen grains measure an average of 30&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;14.5&amp;nbsp;μm in size.&lt;ref name="Haberle"/&gt;

On female trees, the inflorescence is a single ellipsoid or ovoid [[syncarp]], or fruiting head, with off-white [[bract]]s.&lt;ref name="Lim"/&gt;  Female flowers can produce fruit without pollination,&lt;ref name="Rose82" /&gt; and are typically the only trees cultivated.&lt;ref name="Stilltoe" /&gt;  The tree stops making leaves when new fruit is growing.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;  The syncarp has up to a thousand densely-packed single-celled [[carpel]]s that later turn into drupes.&lt;ref name="Lim"/&gt;&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;

The [[clavate]], [[pentagon]]al drupes measure up to 12&amp;nbsp;cm long and have a sharpened base,&lt;ref name="Martelli"/&gt; but typically are 9×1.5&amp;nbsp;cm,&lt;ref name="Lim"/&gt; and are a pale blue-green color.&lt;ref name="Stilltoe" /&gt;  Each cluster contains about 1000 nuts.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;  The [[endocarp]] is bony and thin,&lt;ref name="Lim"/&gt; 5½&amp;nbsp;cm long, with rounded edges about 1½&amp;nbsp;cm wide.&lt;ref name="Martelli"/&gt;  The seed-bearing [[locule]] is around 4&amp;nbsp;cm long.&lt;ref name="Martelli"/&gt;  The core of the mature head ([[mesocarp]]) has an appearance like [[honeycomb]] and is spongy&lt;ref name="Lim"/&gt; and pink.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;  The top of the mesocarp is fibrous, from 3&amp;nbsp;cm long and up.&lt;ref name="Martelli"/&gt;  Though Martelli did not have a complete syncarp, he knew the cluster of fruit must be large, estimating at least 30&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter.&lt;ref name="Martelli"/&gt;  He was correct, as the fruiting cluster is typically 15 to 30&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;  A mature head and stalk weigh up to 16&amp;nbsp;kg,&lt;ref name="Lim"/&gt; but average 6&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt; 

It most closely resembles ''[[Pandanus utilissimus|P. utilissimus]]'', which is found the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name="Martelli"/&gt;  People also harvest and eat nuts of ''P. antaresensis'', ''P. brosimos'', ''P. dubius'', ''P. iwen'', and ''P. limbatus'', and ''[[Pandanus odoratissima|P. odoratissima]]''&lt;ref name="Bourke"/&gt;

==Cultivars==
There are up to 45 cultivated [[Variety (botany)|varieties]] of karuka,&lt;ref name="Stilltoe" /&gt; many with different kernel shapes.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;  There are likely many more, as some cultivars are known only to a small number of people in a single settlement.&lt;ref name="Stilltoe" /&gt;  'Tabuna' and 'Henga' are some of the most important [[cultivar]]s.&lt;ref name="Rose82"/&gt;  'Tabuna' is popular because it is high-yielding, tastes good, and has no [[taboo]]s on who/what can eat it and how/if it is cooked.&lt;ref name="Rose82"/&gt;  At least two varieties are edible raw.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;

Named varieties include:&lt;ref name="Rose82"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rose |first1=C.

==Ecology==
Karuka produces fruit around February, with an occasional secondary season in July.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;  Typically each branch will only flower every other year.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;  The natural [[pollination syndrome]] is unknown, but the flowers can be [[pollination|pollinated]] by humans.&lt;ref name="Bourke"/&gt;  [[Seed dispersal]] is by humans, [[bird]]s, and other [[animal]]s.&lt;ref name="Bourke"/&gt;  A fallen syncarp will disintegrate completely in about 3 days in the forest.&lt;ref name="Rose82"/&gt;

[[Fungus|Fungal]] [[Pest (organism)|pests]] of karuka include [[leaf spot]], [[diffuse leaf spot]], [[black leaf mould]] (''[[Lembosia pandani]]''), [[sooty mold]] (''[[Meliola juttingii]]''), and fungus on seeds (''[[Macrophoma pandani]]'').&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;  The leaf moulds do not do much damage.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;  The sooty mould seems to grow on insect [[frass]].&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;  The black leaf mold only affects some varieties.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;

The bacteria [[Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum|''Pectobacterium carotovorum'' subsp. ''carotovorum'']] can also cause [[bacterial soft rot]] and necrosis on the leaves, but causes more severe damage to the related species ''[[Pandanus conoideus]]''.&lt;ref name="Tomlinson"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tomlinson |first1=D. L. |title=A Leaf and Fruit Disease of ''Pandanus conoideus'' caused by ''Erwinia carotovora'' subsp. ''carotovora'' in Papua New Guinea |journal=Journal of Phytopathology |date=January 1988 |volume=121 |issue=1 |pages=19–25 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0434.1988.tb00948.x |language=English |issn=0931-1785 |oclc=4660013776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Longhorn grasshopper]]s (Tettigoniidae) are serious insect pests.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;  ''[[Segestes gracilis]]'' and ''[[Segestidea montana]]'' eat the leaves and can sometimes kill trees.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;  Growers will stuff leaves and grass in between the leaves of the crown to keep insects out.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;  An unknown species of black [[Grub (larva)|grub]] will burrow into the cluster and eat the spongy core, causing the nuts to turn black and the whole bunch to fall off the tree.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;  [[Woodboring beetle]]s sometimes attack the prop root of the tree.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;

[[Phalangeriformes|Possums]] also eat the nuts,&lt;ref name="French"/&gt; as do [[rodent]]s such as [[squirrel-toothed rat]]s (''Anisomys imitator''), [[eastern white-eared giant rat]]s (''Hyomys goliath''), [[Rothschild's woolly rat]]s (''Mallomys rothschildi''), and [[giant naked-tailed rat]]s (''Uromys anak'').&lt;ref name="Stilltoe" /&gt;  Growers will put platforms or other obstacles on the trunks of trees to keep the pests out.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stilltoe" /&gt;

Harvested nuts are often beset by [[rat]]s and [[cockroach]]es.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;  Hanging nuts in the smoky areas above fires can prevent this, but after a while the taste of the nuts is affected.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;

==Use by humans==
On New Guinea karuka is cultivated crop,&lt;ref name="Lim"/&gt; and has been used as a major food source since nearly 31,000 years ago in the [[Pleistocene]].&lt;ref name="Denham"/&gt;  In PNG nearly 2 million people (almost half the rural population) live in regions where karuka is commonly eaten.&lt;ref name="Quartermain"/&gt;  There is high demand for it in the [[New Guinea Highlands]]:  Entire households (including [[Domestic pig|pigs]], who are sometimes fed the fruits&lt;ref name="Rose82"/&gt;) will move from the valleys to higher elevations at harvest time,&lt;ref name="Bourke"/&gt; often for several weeks.&lt;ref name="Bourke88"/&gt;  Each household will average 12 to 176 trees.&lt;ref name="Bourke88"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bourke |first1=Richard Michael |title=Taim hangre: variation in subsistence food supply in the Papua New Guinea highlands |date=May 1988 |publisher=Australian National University |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320345192 |oclc=224338489 |accessdate=27 September 2018 |language=English |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trade in karuka is small-scale and not commercial.&lt;ref name="Bourke"/&gt;  Local [[marketplace]]s typically will have 12 to 50 fruits for sale.&lt;ref name="Bourke88"/&gt;  With some coordination between state agencies and private sector, karuka could have export [[market access]].&lt;ref name="Quartermain"/&gt; The crop has a medium potential for large-scale sustainable commercialization in the region, but care must be taken in the sensitive local environments to expanded agriculture.&lt;ref name="Bourke"/&gt;  Diets of tree owners could also be negatively influenced by rapid commercialization.&lt;ref name="Bourke"/&gt;

The [[endosperm]], a white kernel, is eaten raw, [[Roasting|roasted]], [[Smoking (cooking)|smoked]],&lt;ref name="Lim"/&gt; or [[Earth oven|mumued]].&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;  Nuts that aren't immediately eaten are typically [[Food drying|sun-dried]] for storage.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;  The karuka kernels have a sweet, [[coconut]] taste,&lt;ref name="Lim"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stilltoe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zebua"/&gt; or savory and like [[walnut]]s.&lt;ref name="Purwanto"/&gt;  Smoked or cooked karuka is either stored in the [[rafter]]s or sold at local marketplaces.&lt;ref name="Lim"/&gt;  The uncooked clusters can also be stored for months buried in waterlogged earth,&lt;ref name="Lim"/&gt;&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rose82"/&gt; which possibly [[Fermentation in food processing|ferments]] it.&lt;ref name="Stilltoe" /&gt;  It is a regional [[staple food]] and one of the few plants in the area with a high [[protein]] content.&lt;ref name="Lim"/&gt;  The spongy core of the [[multiple fruit]] cluster can also be cooked and eaten after the nuts are removed.&lt;ref name="Lim"/&gt;&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;
[[File:Pandanus julianettii oil.png|thumb|oil extracted from the nuts]]
The high [[fat]] content means the nuts can be processed into an edible yellow [[Vegetable oil|oil]].&lt;ref name="Zebua"/&gt;   Karuka contains 52.39% [[oleic acid]], 44.90% [[palmitic acid]], and 0.19% [[stearic acid]].&lt;ref name="Purwanto"/&gt;  The oil is a good source of [[Vitamin E]] ([[α-tocopherol]] 5.03&amp;nbsp;mg/100&amp;nbsp;g).&lt;ref name="Zebua"/&gt;  The color of the oil is from the [[carotenoid]]s, which are at a concentration of 2.75&amp;nbsp;µg/g.&lt;ref name="Zebua"/&gt;  The [[antioxidant]] activity for the oil is fairly low, and it is higher in [[saturated fat|saturated]] than [[unsaturated fat]]s.&lt;ref name="Zebua"/&gt;

Some subjective reports indicate that children are healthier after karuka season, but there may also be increased incidence of [[tropical ulcer]]s and [[Clostridial necrotizing enteritis|pig-bel]] (''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'').&lt;ref name="Rose82"/&gt;  But the connections, if valid, are unclear.

Trunks and buttress roots are used for building.&lt;ref name="Lim"/&gt;  The sheets of bark are used for house walls.&lt;ref name="Stilltoe" /&gt;  The leaves are used for [[The bush|bush]] [[Shelter (building)|shelters]]&lt;ref name="Lim"/&gt; and [[raincape]]s.&lt;ref name="Stilltoe" /&gt;  The leaves were the preferred building material for housing in Papua New Guinea before  [[Colonialism|colonial]] contact.&lt;ref name="Halvaksz"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Halvaksz |first1=Jamon |title=The Photographic Assemblage: Duration, History and Photography in Papua New Guinea |journal=History and Anthropology |date=December 2010 |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=411–429 |doi=10.1080/02757206.2010.521556 |url=http://content.ebscohost.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;K=55204797&amp;S=R&amp;D=aph&amp;EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7A4zdnyOLCmr1Cep7JSs664S7KWxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMO3X6Yjf6OlT69fnhrnb4osA |accessdate=12 October 2018 |language=English |format=PDF |issn=0275-7206 |oclc=683378311}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The durable white [[spathe]] leaves on male inflorescences are used by the [[Wola people]] to wrap [[pearl]] shells.&lt;ref name="Stilltoe" /&gt;

In [[Upper Karint]] near [[Pingirip]], karukas are planted as boundary lines between garden plots.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt;

==Pandanus languages==
Ritual [[pandanus language]]s are known from multiple areas of Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt;  In the [[Mount Giluwe]] area three separate language groups, [[Kewa language|Kewa]], [[Melpa language|Melpa]], and [[Angal language|Mendi]], use pandanus language,&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt; as does Imbongu,&lt;ref name="Stefaniw"/&gt;, [[Huli language|Huli]],&lt;ref name="Goldman"/&gt; and [[Kalam language|Kalam]].&lt;ref name="Majnep"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Majnep |first1=Ian Saem |last2=Bulmer |first2=Ralph |authorlink2=Ralph Bulmer |others=illustrations by Christopher Healey |pages=53, 150, 152 |title=Birds of my Kalam Country |trans-title=Mn̄mon Yad Kalam Yakt |date=1977 |publisher=Aukland University Press |location=New Zealand |isbn=9780196479538 |language=English |oclc=251862814}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The grammar and vocabulary of pandanus language is based on the mother tongue, but a restricted and consolidated form, especially for names of living organisms.&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt;  The new vocabulary focuses on words involved with trips to harvest karuka nuts, and changes as words become known outside an area.&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt;  The language is spoken to control the magical properties of the higher elevations where the karuka grows, and to placate dangerous [[spirit]]s like ''Kita-Menda'' (also called {{lang|imo|Giluwe yelkepo}}&lt;ref name="Stefaniw"/&gt;), the ritual keeper of the [[Free-ranging dog|wild dogs]].&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt;  All ages and genders are expected to know the ritual language before entering the taboo areas, but outsiders who do not know the language may be allowed to speak Tok Pisin instead.&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt;  The taboo areas are typically marked with signs, usually ''[[Cordyline]]'' or other leaves tied to sticks.&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt;  Pandanus language is not spoken outside the designated areas for fear of mountain spirits hearing it and coming down to investigate.&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt;

As Tok Pisin has become more widely spoken in the area, pandanus languages have been spoken less.&lt;ref name="Stefaniw"/&gt;  Newer generations also seem to be less afraid of the deep forest, and do not see much need for the protective talk.&lt;ref name="Stefaniw"/&gt;  The Kewa and Imbongu pandanus languages are already thought to be dying out.&lt;ref name="Stefaniw"/&gt;

'''Lethal yellowing''' (LY) is a [[phytoplasma]] disease that attacks many species of [[Arecaceae|palms]], including some commercially important species such as the [[coconut]] and [[date palm]]. In the Caribbean it is spread by the [[planthopper]] ''[[Haplaxius crudus]]'' (former name ''Myndus crudus'') which is native to Florida, parts of the Caribbean and Central America.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, S.E., Been, B.O. &amp; McLaughlin, W.A. (2006). Detection and variability of the lethal yellowing group (16Sr IV) phytoplasmas in the Cedusa sp. (Hemiptera: Auchenorrhyncha: Derbidae) in Jamaica. ''Annals of Applied Biology'', 149(1), pp. 53–62&lt;/ref&gt; The only effective cure is prevention, i.e. planting resistant varieties of coconut palm and preventing a park or 'golf course like' environments which attracts the planthopper.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Some cultivars, such as the Jamaica Tall coconut cultivar, nearly died out by lethal yellowing. Heavy turf grasses and similar green ground cover will attract the planthopper to lay its eggs and the nymphs develop at the roots of these grasses. The planthoppers' eggs and nymphs may pose a great threat to coconut growing countries' economies, into which grass seeds for [[golf course]]s and lawns are imported from the Americas.

It is not clearly understood how the disease was spread to [[East Africa]] as the planthopper ''Haplaxius crudus'' is not native in East Africa.
The only explanation is that it was imported with grass seed from Florida that was used to create golf courses and lawns in beach resorts. There is a direct connection between green lawns and the spread of lethal yellowing in Florida. Even so-called 'resistant cultivars' such as the [[Malayan Dwarf]] or the [[Maypan coconut palm|Maypan hybrid]] between that dwarf and the Panama Tall were never claimed to have a 100% immunity. The nymphs of the planthoppers develop on roots of grasses, hence the areas of grass in the vicinity of palm trees is connected with the spread of this phytoplasma disease. The problem arose as a direct result of using coconut and date palms for ornamental and landscaping purposes in lawns, golf courses and gardens together with these [[grasses]]. When these two important food palms were grown in traditional ways (without grasses) in plantations and along the shores, the palm groves were not noticeably affected by lethal yellowing. There is no evidence that disease can be spread when instruments used to cut an infected palm are then used to cut or trim a healthy one. Seed transmission has never been demonstrated, although the phytoplasma can be found in coconut seednuts, but phytosanitary quarantine procedures that prevent movement of coconut seed, seedlings and mature palms out of an LY epidemic area should be applied to grasses and other plants that may be carrying infected vectors.

Beside coconut palm (''Cocus nucifera''), more than 30 palm species have also been reported as susceptible to lethal phytoplasmas around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, F. (1992). Lethal yellowing susceptibility of date palms in Florida. Principes, 36(4), pp. 217–222&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incidents ==

This is not a complete list of all pipeline accidents. '''For natural gas alone''', the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), a United States Department of Transportation agency, has collected data on more than 3,200 accidents deemed serious or significant since 1987.

A "significant incident" results in any of the following consequences:
* fatality or injury requiring in-patient hospitalization
* $50,000 or more in total costs, measured in 1984 dollars
* liquid releases of five or more barrels (42 US gal/barrel)
* releases resulting in an unintentional fire or explosion.

PHMSA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) post incident data and results of investigations into accidents involving pipelines that carry a variety of products, including natural gas, oil, diesel fuel, gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel,  carbon dioxide, and other substances. Occasionally pipelines are repurposed to carry different products.&lt;ref&gt;Data sets of PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents for 1986-2001, 2002-2009, and 2010-2017 can be downloaded from the tab by that name on the PHMSA's Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10. PHMSA Corrective Action Orders are at https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/CAO_opid_0.html. PHMSA Pipeline Failure Investigation Reports are at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/safety-reports/pipeline-failure-investigation-reports. NTSB Pipeline Accident Reports are at https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/pipeline.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt;

* On January 4, 2001, Williams Gas Pipeline - Southcentral ([[Texas Gas Transmission]]) was notified that gas was heard blowing in a field 5 miles west of [[Shelby, Mississippi]]. Natural gas was leaking from an 18-inch diameter pipeline in [[Bolivar County]]. Property damage was confined to company facilities in a crop field where there were no dwellings along the pipeline corridor.  Investigators uncovered the pipe to find a fracture about 30 inches long circumferentially in a wrinkle bend of the pipe, which was manufactured in 1940.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents (1986-2001) link on the Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page at www.phmsa.dot.govdata-and-statisticspipelinepipeline-incident-flagged-files.&lt;/ref&gt;
* On January 4, 2001, a circumferential split in a sharp wrinkle bend caused a leak in a 22-inch diameter natural gas transmission pipeline in [[Harrisonville, Missouri]]. The pipe, owned by Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Company, was manufactured in 1931.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
* On January 15, 2001, at [[Lehi, Utah]], [[Questar Gas Company]] received notification that a Questar line was blowing. A Questar employee arrived on-scene and found that the blowing 20-inch high pressure (300 psi) steel pipeline had been hit by a Caterpillar front end loader at an aboveground span that went about 20 feet across a ravine. Investigation revealed that during the previous night, the front end loader had been stolen from a nearby sand and gravel pit. It is believed that the vandals hotwired the front end loader and used it to pull two trucks from the mud in the hills above the scene of the incident. They then rolled the front end loader down the hill where it struck the pipeline and tore a 9-inch by 3-inch hole in the pipe. The total property damage was $300,838 ($277,838 was the market value of the lost gas, and $23,000 was the cost of the repair).&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
* On January 17 and 18, a series of gas explosion hit downtown [[Hutchinson, Kansas]], resulting in 2 deaths, and 2 buildings being destroyed. Later, it was discovered that gas was leaking from an underground gas storage cavern in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2199&amp;dat=20020221&amp;id=5kYyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FucFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6783,985626|title=Lawrence Journal-World – Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1291&amp;dat=20010121&amp;id=tFFUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jY4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6595,4592237|title=Boca Raton News – Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On March 22, 2001, at [[Eustis, Florida]], a Florida Gas Transmission Company (Enron) pipeline had a fire when venting gas from a 24-inch diameter pipeline ignited during a planned blowdown. The fire was extinguished about 40 minutes after it ignited. Damage from the fire was limited to company equipment, a backhoe, and adjacent power lines. The cause of the gas ignition is not known.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
* On April 1, a Dome Pipeline in North Dakota carrying gasoline ruptured and burst into flames a few miles west of [[Bottineau, North Dakota]]. An estimated {{convert|1.1|e6USgal|m3}} of gasoline burned before the pipeline could be shut down. The company attributed the break to damage by an "outside force", which a Bottineau County Sheriff said appeared to be frost that melted at uneven rates, twisting and breaking the pipeline.&lt;ref name="nwf"&gt;{{cite web |title=Fuel Oil Incident List |url=http://www.nwf.org/News-and-Magazines/Media-Center/News-by-Topic/Global-Warming/2010/~/media/PDFs/Global%20Warming/Reports/Full-Oil-Incident-List.ashx |accessdate=October 30, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803143750/http://www.nwf.org/News-and-Magazines/Media-Center/News-by-Topic/Global-Warming/2010/~/media/PDFs/Global%20Warming/Reports/Full-Oil-Incident-List.ashx |archivedate=August 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On April 14, a 6-inch petroleum productions failed near [[Harwood, North Dakota]], spilling 40 barrels of fuel oil. There were no injuries. The failure was due to an [[Electric resistance welding|ERW]] seam failure, with this particular pipeline having had other ERW seam failures in the past in 1987 and 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NOTICE OF PROPOSED CORRECTWE ACTION ORDER |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/320015015H/320015015H_CAO_06222001.pdf |website=primis.phmsa.dot.gov |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028014558/http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/320015015H/320015015H_CAO_06222001.pdf |archivedate=October 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On April 13, 2001, at [[Glasco, Kansas]], dead vegetation was spotted on a flyover along a natural gas transmission pipeline right-of-way. The vegetation was killed by escaping gas. The cause of the leak was a split in a seam near a girth weld on a 36-inch diameter [[Kinder Morgan]] [[Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America]] line. The pipe was manufactured in 1960.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
* On May 1, a MAPCO 10-inch propane pipeline exploded and burned, in [[Platte County, Missouri]]. 13,500 barrels of propane were burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.propublica.org/pipelines/incidents/270584 |title=May 1, 2001 – ProPublica |publisher= |accessdate=January 15, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714124934/http://projects.propublica.org/pipelines/incidents/270584 |archivedate=July 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=KC&amp;p_theme=kc&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EC04EE4B5FAC828&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Big blast, but no injuries Pipeline explodes in Platte County field |accessdate=July 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2199&amp;dat=20010501&amp;id=UYAyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=n-YFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6661,996898|title=Lawrence Journal-World – Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were no injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.texnews.com/1998/2001/local/oil0526.html |title=Local News – Potosi oil pipeline blaze doused, but dispute smolders |publisher=Texnews.com |date=May 26, 2001 |accessdate=February 14, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028010955/http://www.texnews.com/1998/2001/local/oil0526.html |archivedate=October 28, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On June 13, in [[Pensacola, Florida]], at least ten persons were injured when two [[Gulf South Pipeline]] natural gas lines ruptured and exploded after a parking lot gave way beneath a cement truck at a car dealership. The blast sent chunks of concrete flying across a four-lane road, and several employees and customers at neighboring businesses were evacuated. About 25 cars at the dealership and ten boats at a neighboring business were damaged or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, "No one seriously injured as gas explosion rocks Pensacola," http://jacksonville.com/apnews/stories/061301/D7CJVCJ80.html, accessed 2018.01.14.&lt;/ref&gt; The eight-inch diameter pipeline was installed in 1943.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
*On July 8, 2001, a [[Columbia Gas Transmission]] Corp. pipeline at Corrine, West Virginia, was damaged by cataclysmic flooding of the [[Guyandotte River]], which washed out 200 feet of pipe where it crossed over the river. Due to washed out roads and bridges and dangerous flooding in the area, it took 5 hours for the crew to reach shutoff valves on both sides of the washout.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
* On July 24, a pipeline ruptured and spread burning gasoline near [[Manheim, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hazmat2-9.com/gas.html |title=Gasoline Pipeline Explosion |publisher=Hazmat2-9.com |date=July 24, 2001 |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027233752/http://www.hazmat2-9.com/gas.html |archivedate=October 27, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KLQvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FNsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1336,6127433&amp;dq=mobil+pipeline+leak&amp;hl=en|title=Beaver County Times – Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On August 11, at approximately 5:05&amp;nbsp;a.m. MST, an [[El Paso Natural Gas]] 24-inch gas transmission pipeline failed near [[Williams, Arizona]], resulting in the release of natural gas. The natural gas continued to discharge for about an hour before igniting. [[Stress corrosion cracking]] was determined to be the cause of the failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/portal/site/PHMSA/menuitem.ebdc7a8a7e39f2e55cf2031050248a0c/?vgnextoid=18d135199448d110VgnVCM1000009ed07898RCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=663fc02b8be2d110VgnVCM1000009ed07898RCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=print |title=PHMSA – Southwest – CPF 4-2001-1005-H |publisher=Phmsa.dot.gov |date= |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317112938/http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/portal/site/PHMSA/menuitem.ebdc7a8a7e39f2e55cf2031050248a0c/?vgnextoid=18d135199448d110VgnVCM1000009ed07898RCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=663fc02b8be2d110VgnVCM1000009ed07898RCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=print |archivedate=March 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/420011005H/420011005H.pdf |title=Nov 25, 2003 – RESEARCH AND SPECIAL PROGRAMS ADMINISTRATION |accessdate=November 27, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209173432/https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/420011005H/420011005H.pdf |archivedate=February 9, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An influential 2002 study by Matsuoka ''et al''. has demonstrated that, rather than the multiple independent domestications model, all maize arose from a single domestication in southern Mexico about 9,000 years ago. The study also demonstrated that the oldest surviving maize types are those of the Mexican highlands. Later, maize spread from this region over the Americas along two major paths. This is consistent with a model based on the archaeological record suggesting that maize diversified in the highlands of Mexico before spreading to the lowlands.&lt;ref name="Mat"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Matsuoka |first= Y. |year= 2002 |title= A single domestication for maize shown by multilocus microsatellite genotyping |journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume= 99 |pages= 6080–4 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.052125199 |pmid= 11983901 |last2= Vigouroux |first2= Y. |last3= Goodman |first3= M.

Before domestication, maize plants grew only small, {{convert|25|mm|in|0}} long corn cobs, and only one per plant. In Spielvogel's view, many centuries of artificial selection (rather than the current view that maize was exploited by interplanting with ''[[teosinte]]'') by the indigenous people of the Americas resulted in the development of maize plants capable of growing several cobs per plant, which were usually several centimetres/inches long each.&lt;ref name="Spielvogel2005"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jackson J. |last=Spielvogel|title=Medieval and Early Modern Times: Discovering Our Past|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=UbbIAAAACAAJ}}|date=1 March 2005|publisher=Glencoe/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-07-868876-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Olmec]] and [[Maya peoples|Maya]] cultivated maize in numerous varieties throughout [[Mesoamerica]]; they cooked, ground and processed it through [[nixtamalization]]. It was believed that beginning about 2500 BC, the crop spread through much of the [[Americas]].&lt;ref name="archsouth"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roney|first=John|title=The Beginnings of Maize Agriculture|journal=Archaeology Southwest|volume= 23|issue= 1|date=Winter 2009|page= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research of the 21st century has established even earlier dates. The region developed a trade network based on surplus and varieties of maize crops.

Maize is the most widely grown grain [[crop]] throughout the Americas, with 361 million [[tonne|metric tons]] grown in the United States in 2014 (Production table). Approximately 40% of the crop—130 million tons—is used for corn [[ethanol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/12/business/12corn.html |work= The New York Times |title= US Approves Corn Modified for Ethanol |date= February 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genetically modified maize]] made up 85% of the maize planted in the United States in 2009.&lt;ref name=GMOCompass&gt;[http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/agri_biotechnology/gmo_planting/341.genetically_modified_maize_global_area_under_cultivation.html Genetically modified plants: Global Cultivation Area Maize] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812103002/http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/agri_biotechnology/gmo_planting/341.genetically_modified_maize_global_area_under_cultivation.html |date=August 12, 2010 }} GMO Compass, March 29, 2010, retrieved August 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Sugar-rich varieties called [[sweet corn]] are usually grown for human consumption as kernels, while [[field corn]] varieties are used for animal feed, various corn-based human food uses (including grinding into [[cornmeal]] or [[masa]], pressing into [[corn oil]], and fermentation and distillation into alcoholic beverages like [[bourbon whiskey]]), and as chemical feedstocks.

=== Columbian exchange ===
After the arrival of Europeans in 1492, Spanish settlers consumed maize and explorers and traders [[Columbian Exchange|carried it back to Europe]] and introduced it to other countries. Spanish settlers far preferred wheat bread to maize, [[cassava]], or potatoes. Maize flour could not be substituted for wheat for communion bread, since in [[Christian]] belief only wheat could undergo [[transubstantiation]] and be transformed into the body of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Earle, ''The Body of the Conquistador: Food, Race, and the Colonial Experience in Spanish America, 1492–1700''. New York: Cambridge University Press 2012, pp. 17, 151.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Spaniards worried that by eating indigenous foods, which they did not consider nutritious, they would weaken and risk  turning into Indians. "In the view of Europeans, it was the food they ate, even more than the environment in which they lived, that gave Amerindians and Spaniards both their distinctive physical characteristics and their characteristic personalities."&lt;ref&gt;Earle, ''The Body of the Conquistador'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these worries, Spaniards did consume maize. Archeological evidence from Florida sites indicate they cultivated it as well.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Earle, ''The Body of the Conquistador'', p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maize spread to the rest of the world because of its ability to grow in diverse climates. It was cultivated in [[Spain]] just a few decades after Columbus's voyages and then spread to [[Italy]], West Africa and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

In places outside North America, Australia, and New Zealand, ''corn'' often refers to maize in culinary contexts. The narrower meaning is usually indicated by some additional word, as in ''[[sweet corn]]'', ''sweetcorn'', ''[[corn on the cob]]'', ''[[baby corn]]'', the puffed confection known as ''[[popcorn]]'' and the breakfast cereal known as ''[[corn flakes]]''.

In Southern Africa, maize is commonly called ''mielie'' ([[Afrikaans]]) or ''mealie'' ([[English language|English]]),&lt;ref name=OED_mealie&gt;[http://oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/115421 "mealie"], ''Oxford English Dictionary'', online edition, 2012.

''Maize'' is preferred in formal, scientific, and international usage because it refers specifically to this one grain, unlike ''corn'', which has a complex variety of meanings that vary by context and geographic region.&lt;ref name="Ensminger"&gt;{{cite book | title=Foods and Nutrition Encyclopedia, 2nd ed. | publisher=CRC Press |last=Ensminger |first=Audrey H. | year=1994 | isbn=0-8493-8980-1 | page=[{{google books |plainurl=y |id=XMA9gYIj-C4C|page=479}} 479] | quote=The word "maize" is preferred in international usage because in many countries the term "corn", the name by which the plant is known in the United States, is synonymous with the leading cereal grain; thus, in England "corn" refers to wheat, and in Scotland and Ireland it refers to oats.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Maize'' is used by agricultural bodies and [[research institute]]s such as the [[FAO]] and [[CSIRO]]. National agricultural and industry associations often include the word ''maize'' in their name even in English-speaking countries where the local, informal word is something other than ''maize''; for example, the Maize Association of Australia, the Indian Maize Development Association, the Kenya Maize Consortium and Maize Breeders Network, the National Maize Association of Nigeria, the Zimbabwe Seed Maize Association. However, in commodities trading, ''corn'' consistently refers to maize and not other grains.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Certain varieties of maize have been bred to produce many additional developed ears. These are the source of the "[[baby corn]]" used as a vegetable in [[Asian cuisine]].

The apex of the stem ends in the tassel, an [[inflorescence]] of male flowers. When the tassel is mature and conditions are suitably warm and dry, anthers on the tassel [[dehiscence (botany)|dehisce]] and release pollen. Maize pollen is [[Anemophily|anemophilous]] (dispersed by wind), and because of its large settling velocity, most pollen falls within a few meters of the tassel.

Elongated [[Stigma (botany)|stigmas]], called [[corn silk|silks]], emerge from the whorl of husk leaves at the end of the ear. They are often pale yellow and {{convert|18|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in length, like tufts of hair in appearance. At the end of each is a carpel, which may develop into a "kernel" if fertilized by a pollen grain. The [[pericarp]] of the fruit is fused with the seed coat referred to as "[[caryopsis]]", typical of the [[Poaceae|grasses]], and the entire kernel is often referred to as the "[[seed]]". The cob is close to a [[multiple fruit]] in structure, except that the individual fruits (the kernels) never fuse into a single mass. The grains are about the size of [[pea]]s, and adhere in regular rows around a white, pithy substance, which forms the ear. The maximum size of kernels is reputedly {{convert|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=dD4rAAAAYAAJ}}|title=Races of Maize in Peru|last1=Grobman|first1=Alexander|year=1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ear commonly holds 600 kernels. They are of various colors: blackish, [[blue corn|bluish-gray]], [[purple corn|purple]], green, red, white and yellow. When ground into [[flour]], maize yields more flour with much less [[bran]] than wheat does. It lacks the protein [[gluten]] of wheat and, therefore, makes baked goods with poor rising capability. A [[mutation|genetic variant]] that accumulates more sugar and less [[starch]] in the ear is consumed as a vegetable and is called [[sweet corn]]. Young ears can be consumed raw, with the [[corncob|cob]] and silk, but as the plant matures (usually during the summer months), the cob becomes tougher and the silk dries to inedibility. By the end of the [[growing season]], the kernels dry out and become difficult to chew without cooking them tender first in boiling water.

Immature maize shoots accumulate a powerful antibiotic substance, 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one ([[DIMBOA]]). DIMBOA is a member of a group of [[hydroxamic acid]]s (also known as benzoxazinoids) that serve as a natural defense against a wide range of pests, including insects, [[pathogenic]] fungi and [[bacteria]]. DIMBOA is also found in related grasses, particularly wheat. A maize mutant (bx) lacking DIMBOA is highly susceptible to attack by [[aphid]]s and [[fungi]]. DIMBOA is also responsible for the relative resistance of immature maize to the [[European corn borer]] (family [[Crambidae]]). As maize matures, DIMBOA levels and resistance to the corn borer decline.

Because of its shallow roots, maize is susceptible to droughts, intolerant of nutrient-deficient soils, and prone to be uprooted by severe winds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corn Stalk Lodging |publisher=[[Monsanto Company|Monsanto]] Imagine |date=October 2, 2008 |url=http://www.dekalb.ca/content/pdf/corn_stalk_lodging.pdf |accessdate=February 23, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225054032/http://www.dekalb.ca/content/pdf/corn_stalk_lodging.pdf |archivedate=February 25, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetics ==
[[File:GEM corn.jpg|thumb|right|Exotic varieties of maize are collected to add [[genetic diversity]] when selectively breeding new domestic strains]]
Maize is an annual grass in the family [[Gramineae]], which includes such plants as [[wheat]], [[rye]], [[barley]], [[rice]], [[sorghum]], and [[sugarcane]]. There are two major species of the [[Zea (plant)|Zea]] genus: ''Zea mays'' (maize) and Zea diploperennis, which is a [[Perennial plant|perennial]] type of teosinte. The [[Annual plant|annual]] teosinte variety called ''Zea mays mexicana'' is the closest botanical relative to maize. It still grows in the wild as an annual in Mexico and Guatemala.&lt;ref name=oup&gt;{{Cite web| title = Corn – Oxford Reference| accessdate = 2017-12-04| url = http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199734962.001.0001/acref-9780199734962-e-0218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many forms of maize are used for food, sometimes classified as various subspecies related to the amount of starch each has:
* Flour corn: ''Zea mays ''var.'' amylacea''
* [[Popcorn]]: ''Zea mays ''var.'' everta''
* [[Dent corn]] : ''Zea mays ''var.'' indentata''
* [[Flint corn]]: ''Zea mays ''var.'' indurata''
* [[Sweet corn]]: ''Zea mays ''var.'' saccharata'' and ''Zea mays'' var. ''rugosa''
* [[Waxy corn]]: '' Zea mays ''var.'' ceratina''
* [[Amylomaize]]: '' Zea mays''
* [[Pod corn]]: ''Zea mays ''var.'' tunicata'' Larrañaga ex A. St. Hil.
* Striped maize: ''Zea mays ''var.'' japonica''

This system has been replaced (though not entirely displaced) over the last 60 years by multivariable classifications based on ever more data. [[Agronomics|Agronomic]] data were supplemented by botanical traits for a robust initial classification, then genetic, [[Cell biology|cytological]], protein and DNA evidence was added. Now, the categories are forms (little used), races, racial complexes, and recently branches.

Maize is a [[diploid]] with 20 [[chromosome]]s (n=10). The combined length of the chromosomes is 1500 [[Centimorgan|cM]]. Some of the maize chromosomes have what are known as "chromosomal knobs": highly repetitive [[heterochromatin|heterochromatic]] domains that stain darkly. Individual knobs are [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] among strains of both maize and [[teosinte]].

[[Barbara McClintock]] used these knob markers to validate her [[transposon]] theory of "jumping genes", for which she won the 1983 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]. Maize is still an important [[model organism]] for genetics and [[developmental biology]] today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/19/AR2009111903190.html |title=Scientists have high hopes for corn genome |first=David |last=Brown |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=November 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maize Genetics Cooperation Stock Center, funded by the USDA [[Agricultural Research Service]] and located in the Department of Crop Sciences at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], is a stock center of maize mutants. The total collection has nearly 80,000 samples. The bulk of the collection consists of several hundred named genes, plus additional gene combinations and other heritable variants. There are about 1000 chromosomal aberrations (e.g., translocations and inversions) and stocks with abnormal chromosome numbers (e.g., [[tetraploid]]s). Genetic data describing the maize mutant stocks as well as myriad other data about maize genetics can be accessed at [http://maizegdb.org/ MaizeGDB], the Maize Genetics and Genomics Database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maizegdb.org/|title=Welcome to MaizeGDB|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the US [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF), Department of Agriculture ([[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]]) and the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) formed a consortium to sequence the B73 maize [[genome]]. The resulting DNA sequence data was deposited immediately into [[GenBank]], a public repository for genome-sequence data. Sequences and genome annotations have also been made available throughout the project's lifetime at the project's official site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maizesequence.org/index.html|title=Welcome to MaizeSequence.org|publisher=MaizeSequence.org|accessdate=September 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Breeding ==
[[File:Field, corn, Liechtenstein, Mountains, Alps, Vaduz, sky, clouds, landscape.jpg|thumb|right|Field of maize in [[Liechtenstein]]]]

Maize reproduces sexually each year. This randomly selects half the genes from a given plant to propagate to the next generation, meaning that desirable traits found in the crop (like high yield or good nutrition) can be lost in subsequent generations unless certain techniques are used.

Maize breeding in prehistory resulted in large plants producing large ears. Modern breeding began with individuals who selected highly productive varieties in their fields and then sold seed to other farmers. James L. Reid was one of the earliest and most successful developing Reid's Yellow Dent in the 1860s. These early efforts were based on [[Selection methods in plant breeding based on mode of reproduction|mass selection]]. Later breeding efforts included ear to row selection (C. G. Hopkins c. 1896), hybrids made from selected [[inbred]] lines (G. H. Shull, 1909), and the highly successful double cross hybrids using four inbred lines ([[Donald F. Jones|D. F. Jones]] c. 1918, 1922). University supported breeding programs were especially important in developing and introducing modern hybrids (Ref Jugenheimer Hybrid Maize Breeding and Seed Production pub. 1958). By the 1930s, companies such as [[Pioneer Hi-Bred|Pioneer]] devoted to production of hybrid maize had begun to influence long term development. Internationally important seed banks such as the [[International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center]] (CIMMYT) and the US bank at the Maize Genetics Cooperation Stock Center [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] maintain [[germplasm]] important for future crop development.

Since the 1940s the best strains of maize have been first-generation hybrids made from inbred strains that have been optimized for specific traits, such as yield, nutrition, drought, pest and disease tolerance. Both conventional cross-breeding and genetic modification have succeeded in increasing output and reducing the need for cropland, pesticides, water and fertilizer.&lt;ref name=nyt14 /&gt; There is conflicting evidence to support the hypothesis that maize yield potential has increased over the past few decades. This suggests that changes in yield potential are associated with leaf angle, lodging resistance, tolerance of high plant density, disease/pest tolerance, and other agronomic traits rather than increase of yield potential per individual plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2135/cropsci1999.3961622x | author = Duvick, D.

== Origin ==
{{See also|Teosinte#Origin_of_maize_and_interaction_with_teosintes|l1=Origin of maize and interaction with teosintes}}

Maize is the domesticated variant of [[teosinte]].&lt;ref name="corn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://universe.byu.edu/index.php/2011/09/14/study-of-corn-genetics-has-implications-for-biofuel-research/|title=Corn genetics study|work=U N I V E R S E|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two plants have dissimilar appearance, maize having a single tall stalk with multiple leaves and teosinte being a short, bushy plant. The difference between the two is largely controlled by differences in just two genes.&lt;ref name="corn" /&gt;

Several theories had been proposed about the specific origin of maize in Mesoamerica:&lt;ref name="wilkes"&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=C. Wayne |editor-last=Smith|title=Corn: Origin, History, Technology, and Production|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=eDJ3NjHh8H8C}}|date=8 March 2004|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-471-41184-0|first=Garrison |last=Wilkes |chapter=Chapter 1.1 Corn, strange and marvelous: but is a definitive origin known? |pages=3–63  |editor2-first=Javier |editor2-last=Betrán |editor3-first=E.&amp;nbsp;C.&amp;nbsp;A. |editor3-last=Runge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hyams1990"&gt;{{cite book|first=Edward |last=Hyams|title=The Last of the Incas: The Rise and Fall of an American Empire|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=mlZKAAAAYAAJ}}|year=1990|publisher=Dorset Press|isbn=978-0-88029-595-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# It is a direct [[domestication]] of a [[Mexican people|Mexican]] annual [[teosinte]], ''Zea mays'' ssp. ''parviglumis'', native to the [[Balsas River]] valley in south-eastern [[Mexico]], with up to 12% of its [[genetic material]] obtained from ''Zea mays'' ssp. ''mexicana'' through [[introgression]]. This theory was further confirmed by the 2002 study of Matsuoka et al.&lt;ref name="Mat" /&gt;
# It has been derived from hybridization between a small domesticated maize (a slightly changed form of a wild maize) and a teosinte of section ''Luxuriantes'', either ''Z. luxurians'' or ''[[Zea diploperennis|Z. diploperennis]]''.
# It has undergone two or more domestications either of a wild maize or of a teosinte. (The term "teosinte" describes all [[species]] and subspecies in the genus ''Zea'', excluding ''Zea mays'' ssp. ''mays''.)
# It has evolved from a hybridization of ''Z. diploperennis'' by ''[[Tripsacum dactyloides]]''.
In the late 1930s, Paul Mangelsdorf suggested that domesticated maize was the result of a hybridization event between an unknown wild maize and a species of ''[[Tripsacum]]'', a related genus. This theory about the origin of maize has been refuted by modern [[genetic testing]], which refutes Mangelsdorf's model and the fourth listed above.&lt;ref name="wilkes" /&gt;{{rp|40}}

The teosinte origin theory was proposed by the Russian botanist [[Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov]] in 1931 and the later American [[Nobel Prize]]-winner [[George Beadle]] in 1932.&lt;ref name="wilkes" /&gt;{{rp|10}} It is supported experimentally and by recent studies of the plants' genomes. Teosinte and maize are able to cross-breed and produce fertile offspring. A number of questions remain concerning the species, among them:
# how the immense diversity of the species of sect. ''Zea'' originated,
# how the tiny archaeological specimens of 3500–2700 BC could have been selected from a teosinte, and
# how domestication could have proceeded without leaving remains of teosinte or maize with teosintoid traits earlier than the earliest known until recently, dating from ca. 1100 BC.

The [[domestication]] of maize is of particular interest to researchers—[[archaeologist]]s, [[genetics|geneticists]], [[ethnobotany|ethnobotanists]], geographers, etc. The process is thought by some to have started 7,500 to 12,000 years ago. Research from the 1950s to 1970s originally focused on the hypothesis that maize domestication occurred in the highlands between the states of [[Oaxaca]] and [[Jalisco]], because the oldest archaeological remains of maize known at the time were found there.

=== Connection with 'parviglumis' subspecies ===
[[File:Maize-teosinte.jpg|thumb|[[teosinte]] (top), maize-teosinte hybrid (middle), maize (bottom)]]

Genetic studies, published in 2004 by [[John Doebley]], identified ''Zea mays'' ssp. ''parviglumis'', native to the [[Balsas River]] valley in Mexico's southwestern highlands, and also known as Balsas teosinte, as being the [[crop wild relative]] teosinte genetically most similar to modern maize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Doebley |first=John F. |authorlink=John Doebley |title=The genetics of maize evolution |url=http://teosinte.wisc.edu/pdfs/DoebleyAnnRev2004.pdf |journal=[[Annual Review of Genetics]] |year=2004 |volume=38 |pmid=15568971 |pages=37–59 |doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.38.072902.092425}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was confirmed by further studies, which refined this hypothesis somewhat. Archaeobotanical studies, published in 2009, point to the middle part of the Balsas River valley as the likely location of early domestication; this river is not very long, so these locations are not very distant. Stone milling tools with maize residue have been found in an 8,700 year old layer of deposits in a cave not far from [[Iguala, Guerrero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-03/nsf-wgb032309.php|title="Wild grass became maize crop more than 8,700 years ago", National Science Foundation, News Release at ''Eurekalert'' March 24, 2009|date=March 23, 2009|publisher=|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ranere"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ranere |first1=Anthony J. |first2=Dolores R. |last2=Piperno |first3=Irene |last3=Holst |first4=Ruth |last4=Dickau |first5=José |last5=Iriarte |display-authors=3 |title=The cultural and chronological context of early Holocene maize and squash domestication in the Central Balsas River Valley, Mexico |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/106/13/5014.full.pdf |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |year=2009 |volume=106 |pmid=19307573 |issue=13 |pages=5014–5018 |pmc=2664064 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0812590106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ranere |first1=Anthony J. |first2=Dolores R. |last2=Piperno |first3=Irene |last3=Holst |first4=Ruth |last4=Dickau |first5=José |last5=Iriarte |display-authors=3 |title=Starch grain and phytolith evidence for early ninth millennium B.P. maize from the Central Balsas River Valley, Mexico |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/106/13/5019.full.pdf |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |year=2009 |volume=106 |pmid=19307570 |issue=13 |pages=5019–5024 |pmc=2664021 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0812525106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mayan - Stucco Portrait Head - Walters 20092026 - Three Quarter Right.jpg|thumb|left|Stucco head of the [[Maya maize god]], 550–850 AD.]]

Doebley was part of the team that first published, in 2002, that maize had been domesticated only once, about 9,000 years ago, and then spread throughout the Americas.&lt;ref name="Mat" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Balter, [http://news.sciencemag.org/biology/2009/03/corn-its-not-cocktails ''Corn: It's Not for Cocktails.''] March 23, 2009 news.sciencemag.org&lt;/ref&gt;

A primitive corn was being grown in southern Mexico, Central America, and northern South America 7,000 years ago. Archaeological remains of early maize ears, found at [[Guila Naquitz Cave]] in the [[Oaxaca Valley]], date back roughly 6,250 years; the oldest ears from caves near [[Tehuacán, Puebla|Tehuacan]], Puebla, 5,450 [[Before Present|B.P.]] (Before Present)&lt;ref name="archsouth" /&gt;

Maize pollen dated to 7,300 B.P. from [[San Andrés (Mesoamerican site)|San Andres, Tabasco]], on the Caribbean coast has also been recovered.&lt;ref name="Ranere" /&gt;

As maize was introduced to new cultures, new uses were developed and new varieties selected to better serve in those preparations. Maize was the staple food, or a major staple – along with [[Squash (plant)|squash]], Andean region [[potato]], [[quinoa]], [[bean]]s, and [[amaranth]] – of most [[pre-Columbian]] North American, Mesoamerican, South American, and Caribbean cultures. The Mesoamerican civilization, in particular, was deeply interrelated with maize. Its traditions and rituals involved all aspects of maize cultivation – from the planting to the food preparation. Maize formed the Mesoamerican people's identity.

It is unknown what precipitated its domestication, because the edible portion of the wild variety is too small, and hard to obtain, to be eaten directly, as each kernel is enclosed in a very hard bivalve shell.

In 1939, George Beadle demonstrated that the kernels of teosinte are readily "popped" for human consumption, like modern popcorn.&lt;ref&gt;NORMAN H. HOROWITZ, [http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/beadle-g-w.pdf National Academy of Sciences. GEORGE WELLS BEADLE 1903–1989 (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued it would have taken too many generations of [[selective breeding]] to produce large, compressed ears for efficient cultivation. However, studies of the hybrids readily made by intercrossing teosinte and modern maize suggest this objection is not well founded.

=== Spreading to the north ===
Around 4,500 B.P., maize began to spread to the north; it was first cultivated in what is now the United States at several sites in New Mexico and Arizona, about 4,100 B.P.&lt;ref&gt;Roney, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first millennium AD, maize cultivation spread more widely in the areas north. In particular, the large-scale adoption of maize agriculture and consumption in eastern North America took place about A.D. 900. Native Americans cleared large forest and grassland areas for the new crop.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas E. Emerson, Kristin M. Hedman and Mary L. Simon, [https://www.academia.edu/1332730/  ''Marginal Horticulturalists or Maize Agriculturalists? Archaeobotanical, Paleopathological, and Isotopic Evidence Relating to Langford Tradition Maize Consumption.''] Midcontinental Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 30, No. 1 (SPRING, 2005), pp. 67-118 https://www.jstor.org/stable/20708222&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, research by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] suggested that the rise in maize cultivation 500 to 1,000 years ago in what is now the southeastern United States corresponded with a decline of freshwater [[mussel]]s, which are very sensitive to environmental changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Evan Peacock, Wendell R. Haag &amp; Melvin L. Warren, Jr. |year=2005 |title=Prehistoric decline in freshwater mussels coincident with the advent of maize agriculture |journal=[[Conservation Biology (journal)|Conservation Biology]] |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=547–551 |url=http://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/ja/ja_peacock001.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.00036.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultivation ==

=== Planting ===
[[File:Plàntules moresc 2012.JPG|thumb|Seedlings three weeks after sowing]]
[[File:Corn Zea mays Plant Row 2000px.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Young stalks]]
Because it is cold-intolerant, in the [[Temperate|temperate zones]] maize must be planted in the spring. Its [[root system]] is generally shallow, so the plant is dependent on soil moisture. As a plant that uses [[C4 carbon fixation]], maize is a considerably more water-efficient crop than plants that use [[C3 carbon fixation]] such as [[alfalfa]] and [[soybeans]]. Maize is most sensitive to drought at the time of silk emergence, when the flowers are ready for pollination. In the United States, a good harvest was traditionally predicted if the maize was "knee-high by the [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]]", although modern [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] generally exceed this growth rate. Maize used for [[silage]] is harvested while the plant is green and the fruit immature. Sweet corn is harvested in the "milk stage", after pollination but before starch has formed, between late summer and early to mid-autumn. Field maize is left in the field until very late in the autumn to thoroughly dry the grain, and may, in fact, sometimes not be harvested until winter or even early spring. The importance of sufficient soil moisture is shown in many parts of [[Africa]], where periodic [[drought]] regularly causes maize crop failure and consequent [[famine]]. Although it is grown mainly in wet, hot climates, it has been said to thrive in cold, hot, dry or wet conditions, meaning that it is an extremely versatile crop.&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez-Armesto, Felipe (2011). "The World: A History", p. 470. Penguin Academics, London. {{ISBN|0-205-75930-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maispflanze.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Mature plants showing ears]]
Maize was planted by the [[Native American (Americas)|Native Americans]] in hills, in a complex system known to some as the [[Three Sisters (agriculture)|Three Sisters]]. Maize provided support for [[bean]]s, and the beans provided nitrogen derived from nitrogen-fixing [[rhizobia]] bacteria which live on the roots of beans and other [[legume]]s; and [[Squash (fruit)|squashes]] provided ground cover to stop weeds and inhibit evaporation by providing shade over the soil.&lt;ref name=Mann_2011&gt;{{cite book |title=[[1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus]] |edition=2nd |authorlink=Charles C. Mann |first=Charles C. |last=Mann |chapter=Cotton (or Anchovies) and Maize |pages=225–229 |date=July 2011 |publisher=[[Vintage Books]] |isbn=978-1-4000-3205-1 |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method was replaced by single species hill planting where each hill {{convert|60|–|120|cm|ft|abbr=on}} apart was planted with three or four seeds, a method still used by home gardeners. A later technique was "checked maize", where hills were placed {{convert|40|in|m|abbr=on}} apart in each direction, allowing cultivators to run through the field in two directions. In more arid lands, this was altered and seeds were planted in the bottom of {{convert|10|–|12|cm|in|abbr=on}} deep furrows to collect water. Modern technique plants maize in rows which allows for cultivation while the plant is young, although the hill technique is still used in the maize fields of some Native American reservations. When maize is planted in rows, it also allows for planting of other crops between these rows to make more efficient use of land space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Diderot|first1=Denis|title=Maize|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/did/did2222.0002.667/--maize?rgn=main;view=fulltext;q1=Agriculture|website=The Encyclopedia of Diderot &amp; d'Alembert: Collaborative Translations Project|accessdate=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most regions today, maize grown in residential [[garden]]s is still often planted manually with a [[hoe (tool)|hoe]], whereas maize grown commercially is no longer planted manually but rather is planted with a [[planter (farm implement)|planter]]. In North America, fields are often planted in a two-[[crop rotation]] with a [[Nitrogen fixation|nitrogen-fixing]] crop, often [[alfalfa]] in cooler climates and [[soybean]]s in regions with longer summers. Sometimes a third crop, [[winter wheat]], is added to the rotation.

Many of the maize varieties grown in the United States and Canada are hybrids. Often the varieties have been [[genetically modified]] to tolerate [[glyphosate]] or to provide protection against natural pests. Glyphosate is an herbicide which kills all plants except those with genetic tolerance. This genetic tolerance is very rarely found in nature.

In the midwestern United States, low-till or [[no-till farming]] techniques are usually used. In low-till, fields are covered once, maybe twice, with a tillage implement either ahead of crop planting or after the previous harvest. The fields are planted and [[anhydrous ammonia|fertilized]]. [[Weed]]s are controlled through the use of [[herbicide]]s, and no cultivation tillage is done during the growing season. This technique reduces moisture evaporation from the soil, and thus provides more moisture for the crop.
The technologies mentioned in the previous paragraph enable low-till and no-till farming. Weeds compete with the crop for moisture and nutrients, making them undesirable.

=== Harvesting ===
[[File:YellowCorn.jpg|thumb|right|Mature maize ears]]
[[File:Iowa harvest 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Harvesting maize, [[Jones County, Iowa]]]]

Before the 20th century, all maize harvesting was by [[manual labour]], by [[grazing]], or by some combination of those. Whether the ears were hand-picked and the [[corn stover|stover]] was grazed, or the whole plant was cut, gathered, and [[stook|shocked]], people and [[livestock]] did all the work. Between the 1890s and the 1970s, the technology of maize harvesting expanded greatly. Today, all such technologies, from entirely manual harvesting to entirely mechanized, are still in use to some degree, [[appropriate technology|as appropriate to each farm's needs]], although the thoroughly mechanized versions predominate, as they offer the lowest [[unit cost]]s when scaled to large farm operations. For small farms, their unit cost can be too high, as their higher [[fixed cost]] cannot be [[amortization|amortized]] over as many units.

Before [[World War II]], most maize in North America was harvested by hand. This involved a large numbers of workers and associated social events (husking or shucking [[communal work|bees]]). From the 1890s onward, some machinery became available to partially mechanize the processes, such as one- and two-row mechanical pickers (picking the ear, leaving the [[corn stover|stover]]) and corn binders, which are [[reaper-binder]]s designed specifically for maize (for example, {{YouTube|zA3zbJNvWuo}}). The latter produce [[sheaf (agriculture)|sheaves]] that can be [[stook|shocked]]. By hand or mechanical picker, the entire ear is harvested, which then requires a separate operation of a maize sheller to remove the kernels from the ear. Whole ears of maize were often stored in [[corn crib]]s, and these whole ears are a sufficient form for some livestock feeding use. Today corn cribs with whole ears, and corn binders, are less common because most modern farms harvest the grain from the field with a [[combine harvester|combine]] and store it in [[silo#Bins|bins]]. The combine with a corn head (with points and snap rolls instead of a reel) does not cut the stalk; it simply pulls the stalk down. The stalk continues downward and is crumpled into a mangled pile on the ground, where it usually is left to become [[organic matter]] for the [[soil]]. The ear of maize is too large to pass between slots in a plate as the snap rolls pull the stalk away, leaving only the ear and husk to enter the machinery. The combine separates out the husk and the cob, keeping only the kernels.

When maize is a [[silage]] crop, the entire plant is usually chopped at once with a [[forage harvester]] (chopper) and ensiled in silos or polymer wrappers. Ensiling of sheaves cut by a corn binder was formerly common in some regions but has become uncommon.

[[File:MaizeYield.png|thumb|right|Worldwide maize production]]

For storing grain in bins, the moisture of the grain must be sufficiently low to avoid spoiling. If the moisture content of the harvested grain is too high, [[grain drying|grain dryers]] are used to reduce the moisture content by blowing heated air through the grain. This can require large amounts of energy in the form of combustible gases ([[propane]] or [[natural gas]]) and electricity to power the blowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Van Devender|first=Karl|title=Grain Drying Concepts and Options|publisher=University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture|date=July 2011|url=http://www.uaex.edu/publications/pdf/FSA-1072.pdf|accessdate=December 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==

Maize is widely cultivated throughout the world, and a greater weight of maize is produced each year than any other grain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Grains Council Market Report 28 November 2013|url=http://www.igc.int/downloads/gmrsummary/gmrsumme.pdf|author=[[International Grains Council (international organization)]]|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, total world production was 1.04 billion [[tonne]]s, led by the United States with 35% of the total (table). China produced 21% of the global total.

Maize and [[cornmeal]] (ground dried maize) constitute a [[staple food]] in many regions of the world.

Maize is central to [[Mexican food]]. Virtually every dish in Mexican cuisine uses maize. In the form of grain or cornmeal, maize is the main ingredient of [[Corn tortilla|tortillas]], [[tamale]]s, [[pozole]], [[atole]] and all the dishes based on them, like [[taco]]s, [[quesadilla]]s, [[chilaquiles]], [[enchilada]]s, [[tostada (tortilla)|tostadas]] and many more. In Mexico even a fungus of maize, known as [[huitlacoche]] is considered a delicacy.

Introduced into Africa by the Portuguese in the 16th century, maize has become Africa's most important staple food crop.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/a0154e/A0154E02.HTM The cassava transformation in Africa]". The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).&lt;/ref&gt; Maize meal is made into a thick [[porridge]] in many cultures: from the [[polenta]] of Italy, the ''angu'' of Brazil, the ''[[mămăligă]]'' of [[Romania]], to [[Mush (cornmeal)|cornmeal mush]] in the US (and [[hominy]] [[grits]] in the South) or the food called [[mealie pap]] in South Africa and ''[[sadza]]'', ''[[nshima]]'' and ''[[ugali]]'' in other parts of Africa. Maize meal is also used as a replacement for [[wheat]] flour, to make [[cornbread]] and other baked products. [[Masa]] (cornmeal treated with [[limewater]]) is the main ingredient for [[tortilla]]s, [[atole]] and many other dishes of Central American food.

[[Popcorn]] consists of kernels of certain varieties that explode when heated, forming fluffy pieces that are eaten as a snack. Roasted dried maize ears with semihardened kernels, coated with a seasoning mixture of fried chopped spring onions with salt added to the oil, is a popular [[snack food]] in Vietnam. ''Cancha'', which are roasted maize chulpe kernels, are a very popular snack food in Peru, and also appears in traditional Peruvian ''[[ceviche]]''. An unleavened bread called ''[[makki di roti]]'' is a popular bread eaten in the [[Punjab region]] of India and Pakistan.

''[[Chicha]]'' and ''chicha morada'' (purple chicha) are drinks typically made from particular types of maize. The first one is fermented and alcoholic, the second is a soft drink commonly drunk in Peru.

[[Corn flakes]] are a common [[breakfast cereal]] in North America and the United Kingdom, and found in many other countries all over the world.

Maize can also be prepared as [[hominy]], in which the kernels are soaked with [[lye]] in a process called [[nixtamalization]]; or [[grits]], which are coarsely ground hominy. These are commonly eaten in the [[Southeastern United States]], foods handed down from [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], who called the dish [[sagamite]].

The Brazilian dessert [[canjica (dish)|''canjica'']] is made by boiling maize kernels in sweetened milk.
Maize can also be harvested and consumed in the unripe state, when the kernels are fully grown but still soft. Unripe maize must usually be cooked to become palatable; this may be done by simply boiling or roasting the whole ears and eating the kernels right off the cob. [[Sweet corn]], a genetic variety that is high in sugars and low in starch, is usually consumed in the unripe state. Such [[corn on the cob]] is a common dish in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, [[Cyprus]], some parts of South America, and the Balkans, but virtually unheard of in some European countries. Corn on the cob was hawked on the streets of early 19th-century New York City by poor, barefoot "[[Hot Corn]] Girls", who were thus the precursors of [[hot dog cart]]s, [[churro]] wagons, and fruit stands seen on the streets of big cities today.&lt;ref&gt;Solon Robinson. Hot Corn: Life Scenes in New York Illustrated (Series appearing in 1853 in the NY Tribune, later as a book)&lt;/ref&gt; The cooked, unripe kernels may also be shaved off the cob and served as a [[vegetable]] in side dishes, [[salad]]s, [[garnish (food)|garnishes]], etc. Alternatively, the raw unripe kernels may also be grated off the cobs and processed into a variety of cooked dishes, such as maize [[purée]], [[tamale]]s, ''[[pamonha]]s'', ''[[curau]]'', [[cake]]s, [[ice cream]]s, etc.[[File:Maizes on fire.JPG|upright=0.9|thumb|Maize being thoroughly [[roasting|roasted]] in portable [[brazer]] in [[India]]]]

Maize is a major source of [[starch]]. [[Cornstarch]] (maize flour) is a major ingredient in home cooking and in many industrialized food products. Maize is also a major source of [[cooking oil]] ([[corn oil]]) and of maize gluten. Maize starch can be [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] and enzymatically treated to produce syrups, particularly [[high fructose corn syrup]], a sweetener; and also fermented and distilled to produce [[grain alcohol]]. Grain alcohol from maize is traditionally the source of [[Bourbon whiskey]]. Maize is sometimes used as the starch source for [[beer]].

Within the United States, the usage of maize for human consumption constitutes about 1/40th of the amount grown in the country. In the United States and Canada, maize is mostly grown to feed [[livestock]], as forage, [[silage]] (made by fermentation of chopped green cornstalks), or grain. Maize meal is also a significant ingredient of some commercial animal food products, such as [[dog food]].

Raw, yellow, sweet maize kernels are composed of 76% water, 19% [[carbohydrates]], 3% [[protein]], and 1% [[fat]] (table). In a 100-[[gram]] serving, maize kernels provide 86 [[calories]] and are a good source (10-19% of the [[Daily Value]]) of the [[B vitamins]], [[thiamin]], [[niacin]] (but see [[Maize#Pellagra|Pellagra warning]] below), [[pantothenic acid]] (B5) and [[folate]] (right table for raw, uncooked kernels, [[USDA]] Nutrient Database). In moderate amounts, they also supply [[dietary fiber]] and the [[essential minerals]], [[magnesium]] and [[phosphorus]] whereas other nutrients are in low amounts (table).

Maize has suboptimal amounts of the [[essential amino acid]]s [[tryptophan]] and [[lysine]], which accounts for its lower status as a protein source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/t0395e/T0395E0c.htm|title=Chapter 8: Improvement of maize diets; from corporate document: Maize in human nutrition|publisher=United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization|date=1992|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The indigenous Americans overcame this deficiency with the inclusion of beans in their diet.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

=== Feed and fodder for livestock ===
{{See also|Corn stover#Uses}}
Maize is a major source of both grain [[animal feed|feed]] and [[fodder]] for [[livestock]]. It is fed to the livestock in various ways. When it is used as a grain crop, the dried [[corn kernel|kernels]] are used as feed. They are often kept on the [[corncob|cob]] for storage in a [[corn crib]], or they may be shelled off for storage in a [[grain bin]]. The farm that consumes the feed may produce it, purchase it on the market, or some of both. When the grain is used for feed, the rest of the plant (the [[corn stover]]) can be used later as fodder, [[bedding (animals)|bedding]] (litter), or [[soil conditioner|soil amendment]]. When the whole maize plant (grain plus stalks and leaves) is used for fodder, it is usually [[forage harvester|chopped all at once]] and [[silage|ensilaged]], as digestibility and palatability are higher in the ensilaged form than in the dried form. Maize silage is one of the most valuable forages for ruminants.&lt;ref&gt;Heuzé V., Tran G., Edouard N., Lebas F., 2017. Maize silage. Feedipedia, a programme by INRA, CIRAD, AFZ and FAO. https://www.feedipedia.org/node/13883 Last updated on June 22, 2017, 14:24&lt;/ref&gt; Before the advent of widespread ensilaging, it was traditional to gather the corn into [[stook|shocks]] after harvesting, where it dried further. With or without a subsequent move to the cover of a barn, it was then stored for weeks to several months until fed to the livestock. Today ensilaging can occur not only in [[silo]]es but also in silage wrappers. However, in the tropics maize can be harvested year-round and fed as green forage to the animals.&lt;ref&gt;Heuzé V., Tran G., Edouard N., Lebas F., 2017. Maize green forage.

=== Chemicals ===
Starch from maize can also be made into [[plastics]], [[fabric]]s, [[adhesive]]s, and many other chemical products.

The [[corn steep liquor]], a plentiful watery byproduct of maize [[wet milling]] process, is widely used in the [[biochemistry|biochemical industry]] and research as a culture medium to grow many kinds of [[microorganism]]s.&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Bacteriological Reviews]] |date=December 1948|volume = 12|issue = 4|pages = 297–311|title = Corn steep liquor in microbiology|first1 = R.

Maize cobs are also used as a [[biomass]] fuel source. Maize is relatively cheap and home-heating furnaces have been developed which use maize kernels as a fuel. They feature a large hopper that feeds the uniformly sized maize kernels (or wood pellets or [[cherry]] pits) into the fire.

Maize is increasingly used as a feedstock for the production of [[ethanol fuel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torres|first=Andres F.|last2=Slegers|first2=Petronella M.|last3=Noordam-Boot|first3=Cornelie M.

High fuel prices in mid-2007 led to higher demand for ethanol, which in turn led to higher prices paid to farmers for maize. This led to the 2007 harvest being one of the most profitable maize crops in modern history for farmers. Because of the relationship between fuel and maize, prices paid for the crop now tend to track the price of oil. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

The price of food is affected to a certain degree by the use of maize for biofuel production. The cost of transportation, production, and marketing are a large portion (80%) of the price of food in the United States. Higher energy costs affect these costs, especially transportation. The increase in food prices the consumer has been seeing is mainly due to the higher energy cost. The effect of biofuel production on other food crop prices is indirect. Use of maize for biofuel production increases the demand, and therefore price of maize. This, in turn, results in farm acreage being diverted from other food crops to maize production. This reduces the supply of the other food crops and increases their prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Money/2008/0128/p03s03-usec.html|title=Christian Science Monitor|author=Mark Clayton|date=January 28, 2008|work=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iowarfa.org/food_facts.php |title=Iowa Renewable Fuels Association |publisher= |accessdate=October 6, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011043043/http://www.iowarfa.org/food_facts.php |archivedate=October 11, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Haase anaerobic digester.JPG|left|thumb|Farm-based maize silage digester located near [[Neumünster]] in Germany, 2007. Green inflatable biogas holder is shown on top of the digester]]
Maize is widely used in Germany as a feedstock for [[anaerobic digesters|biogas plants]]. Here the maize is harvested, shredded then placed in [[silage]] clamps from which it is fed into the biogas plants. This process makes use of the whole plant rather than simply using the kernels as in the production of fuel ethanol.

A [[biomass gasification]] power plant in Strem near [[Güssing]], [[Burgenland]], Austria, began in 2005. Research is being done to make [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] out of the biogas by the [[Fischer Tropsch]] method.

Increasingly, ethanol is being used at low concentrations (10% or less) as an additive in [[gasoline]] ([[gasohol]]) for motor fuels to increase the [[octane rating]], lower pollutants, and reduce petroleum use (what is nowadays also known as "[[biofuels]]" and has been generating an intense debate regarding the human beings' necessity of new sources of energy, on the one hand, and the need to maintain, in regions such as Latin America, the food habits and culture which has been the essence of civilizations such as the one originated in Mesoamerica; the entry, January 2008, of maize among the commercial agreements of [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] has increased this debate, considering the bad labor conditions of workers in the fields, and mainly the fact that NAFTA "opened the doors to the import of maize from the United States, where the farmers who grow it receive multimillion dollar subsidies and other government supports. (...) According to OXFAM UK, after NAFTA went into effect, the price of maize in Mexico fell 70% between 1994 and 2001. The number of farm jobs dropped as well: from 8.1 million in 1993 to 6.8 million in 2002. Many of those who found themselves without work were small-scale maize growers.").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.envio.org.ni/articulo/2676|title=Revista Envío – Are Free Trade Agreements Free? Are They Development Strategies?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, introduction in the northern latitudes of the US of [http://www.aces.uiuc.edu/news/stories/news4169.html tropical maize for biofuels], and not for human or animal consumption, may potentially alleviate this.

As a result of the [[Federal government of the United States|US federal government]] announcing its production target of {{convert|35|e9USgal|m3}} of biofuels by 2017, ethanol production will grow to {{convert|7|e9USgal|m3}} by 2010, up from 4.5 billion in 2006, boosting ethanol's share of maize demand in the US from 22.6 percent to 36.1 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.ibisworld.com/pressrelease/pressrelease.aspx?prid=115 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402034432/http://www.ibisworld.com/pressrelease/pressrelease.aspx?prid=115 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-04-02 |title=IBISWorld |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Commodity ===
Maize is bought and sold by investors and price speculators as a tradable commodity using corn [[futures contract]]s. These "futures" are traded on the [[Chicago Board of Trade]] (CBOT) under [[ticker symbol]] '''C'''. They are delivered every year in March, May, July, September, and December.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikinvest:Corn Prices|CBOT Corn Futures Contract Overview via Wikinvest]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ornamental and other uses ===
{{Main|Corn construction}}
Some forms of the plant are occasionally grown for ornamental use in the garden. For this purpose, variegated and colored leaf forms as well as those with colorful ears are used.

Corncobs can be hollowed out and treated to make inexpensive [[smoking pipe (tobacco)|smoking pipes]], first manufactured in the United States in 1869.

[[File:CornKernelBox.jpg|thumb|right|Children playing in a maize kernel box]]
An unusual use for maize is to create a "[[corn maze]]" (or "maize maze") as a tourist attraction. The idea of a maize maze was introduced by the American Maze Company who created a maze in [[Pennsylvania]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanmaze.com/about-the-american-maze/#first About the American Maze], The American Maze Company&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional mazes are most commonly grown using [[taxus|yew]] [[hedge (gardening)|hedges]], but these take several years to mature. The rapid growth of a field of maize allows a maze to be laid out using [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] at the start of a growing season and for the maize to grow tall enough to obstruct a visitor's line of sight by the start of the summer. In Canada and the US, these are popular in many farming communities.

Maize kernels can be used in place of sand in a [[sandpit|sandboxlike]] enclosure for children's play.&lt;ref name=corn_box&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.mazefunpark.com/attractions/details.php?attraction_id=5| title = Maize Quest Fun Park: Corn Box| accessdate = October 8, 2007| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012201617/http://mazefunpark.com/attractions/details.php?attraction_id=5| archivedate = October 12, 2007| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stigmas from female maize flowers, popularly called [[corn silk]], are sold as [[herbalism|herbal supplements]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Maize is used as a [[Bait (luring substance)|fish bait]], called "dough balls". It is particularly popular in Europe for [[coarse fishing]].

Additionally, feed corn is sometimes used by hunters to bait animals such as deer or wild hogs.

In the US since 2009/2010, maize feedstock use for ethanol production has somewhat exceeded direct use for livestock feed; maize use for fuel ethanol was 5,130 million bushels (130 million tonnes) in the 2013/2014 marketing year.&lt;ref&gt;United States Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service. Corn supply, disappearance, and share of total corn used for ethanol. www.ers.usda.gov/datafiles/US_Bioenergy/Feedstocks/table05.xls (Excel file, accessed June 29, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

A fraction of the maize feedstock dry matter used for ethanol production is usefully recovered as DDGS (dried distillers grains with solubles). In the 2010/2011 marketing year, about 29.1 million tonnes of DDGS were fed to US livestock and poultry.&lt;ref name=Hoffman2011&gt;Hoffman, L. and A. Baker. 2011. Estimating the substitution of distillers'grains for corn and soybean meal in the U.S. feed complex. United States Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service. FDS-11-l-01. 62 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Because starch utilization in fermentation for ethanol production leaves other grain constituents more concentrated in the residue, the feed value per kg of DDGS, with regard to ruminant-metabolizable energy and protein, exceeds that of the grain. Feed value for monogastric animals, such as swine and poultry, is somewhat lower than for ruminants.&lt;ref name=Hoffman2011 /&gt;

== Comparison to other staple foods ==

The following table shows the nutrient content of maize and major staple foods in a raw harvested form. Raw forms are not edible and cannot be digested. These must be sprouted, or prepared and cooked for human consumption. In sprouted or cooked form, the relative nutritional and anti-nutritional contents of each of these staples are different from that of raw form of these staples reported in the table below.

{{Main|Pellagra}}
When maize was first introduced into farming systems other than those used by traditional native-American peoples, it was generally welcomed with enthusiasm for its productivity. However, a widespread problem of malnutrition soon arose wherever maize was introduced as a [[staple food]]. This was a mystery, since these types of malnutrition were not normally seen among the indigenous Americans, for whom maize was the principal staple food.&lt;ref name=pellagra_mystery&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eufic.org/web/article.asp?cust=1&amp;lng=en&amp;sid=4&amp;did=16&amp;artid=103 |title=The origins of maize: the puzzle of pellagra |accessdate=September 14, 2006 |work=EUFIC &gt; Nutrition &gt; Understanding Food |date=December 2001 |publisher=The European Food Information Council |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927074332/http://www.eufic.org/web/article.asp?cust=1&amp;lng=en&amp;sid=4&amp;did=16&amp;artid=103 |archivedate=September 27, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was eventually discovered that the indigenous Americans had learned to soak maize in [[alkali]]-water (the process now known as [[nixtamalization]]) —made with ashes and lime ([[calcium oxide]]) since at least 1200–1500 BC by [[Mesoamericans]] and North Americans—which liberates the B-vitamin [[niacin]], the lack of which was the underlying cause of the condition known as [[pellagra]].&lt;ref name="StallerCarrasco2009"&gt;{{cite book|first1=John |last1=Staller|first2=Michael

Maize was introduced into the diet of nonindigenous Americans without the necessary cultural knowledge acquired over thousands of years in the Americas. In the late 19th century, pellagra reached epidemic proportions in parts of the southern US, as medical researchers debated two theories for its origin: the deficiency theory (which was eventually shown to be true) said that pellagra was due to a deficiency of some nutrient, and the germ theory said that pellagra was caused by a germ transmitted by stable flies. A third theory, promoted by the eugenicist [[Charles Davenport]], held that people only contracted pellagra if they were susceptible to it due to certain "constitutional, inheritable" traits of the affected individual.&lt;ref name="Chase1980"&gt;{{cite book|first=Allan |last=Chase|title=The Legacy of Malthus: the social costs of the new scientific racism|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=VDQFAQAAIAAJ}}|date=April 1980|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-00790-3}} [http://crcrth645.wikispaces.umb.edu/pellagra Precis by Jan Coe]&lt;/ref&gt;

Once alkali processing and dietary variety were understood and applied, pellagra disappeared in the developed world. The development of high lysine maize and the promotion of a more balanced diet have also contributed to its demise. Pellagra still exists today in food-poor areas and refugee camps where people survive on donated maize.&lt;ref name="Thompson2016"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Janice J. |last1=Thompson|first2=Melinda|last2= Manore|first3=Linda |last3=Vaughan|title=The Science of Nutrition|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=pbd5CwAAQBAJ|page=292}}|date=15 January 2016|publisher=Pearson Education |isbn=978-0-13-429880-1|chapter=Nutrients involved in energy metabolism |pages=292–321}} Also {{ISBN|978-0-321-64316-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Allergy ===
{{Main|Corn allergy}}
Maize contains [[Lipid transfer proteins|lipid transfer protein]], an indigestible protein that survives cooking. This protein has been linked to a rare and understudied [[allergy]] to maize in humans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://foodallergens.ifr.ac.uk/food.lasso?selected_food=33#summary Corn (maize) Allergy], InformAll Database, October 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The allergic reaction can cause skin rash, swelling or itching of [[mucous membranes]], diarrhea, vomiting, [[asthma]] and, in severe cases, [[anaphylaxis]]. It is unclear how common this allergy is in the general population.

Maize has been an essential crop in the [[Andes]] since the [[pre-Columbian era]]. The [[Moche culture|Moche]] culture from Northern [[Peru]] made ceramics from earth, water, and fire. This pottery was a sacred substance, formed in significant shapes and used to represent important themes. Maize was represented anthropomorphically as well as naturally.&lt;ref&gt;Berrin, Katherine &amp; [[Larco Museum]]. The Spirit of Ancient Peru: Treasures from the Museo Arqueológico Rafael Larco Herrera. New York: Thames and Hudson, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, maize ears along with tobacco leaves are carved into the capitals of columns in the [[United States Capitol]] building. Maize itself is sometimes used for temporary architectural detailing when the intent is to celebrate the fall season, local agricultural productivity and culture. Bundles of dried maize stalks are often displayed often along with pumpkins, gourds and straw in autumnal displays outside homes and businesses. A well-known example of architectural use is the [[Corn Palace]] in Mitchell, South Dakota, which uses cobs and ears of colored maize to implement a mural design that is recycled annually. Another well known example is the [[Field of Corn]] in [[Dublin, Ohio]], where hundreds of concrete ears of corn lay in a grassy field.

A maize stalk with two ripe ears is depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Croatian 1 [[Croatian kuna|lipa]] coin, minted since 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hnb.hr/ Croatian National Bank].

The '''Masaka–Mutukula–Mwanza High Voltage Power Line''' is a proposed [[high voltage]] electricity power line, connecting the high voltage [[Electrical substation|substation]] at [[Masaka]], in [[Masaka District]], in the [[Central Region, Uganda|Central Region]] of  [[Uganda]], to another high voltage substation at [[Mwanza]], in [[Mwanza Region]], in the [[Republic of Tanzania]].&lt;ref name="One"&gt;{{cite web| date=5 January 2018 |format=PDF | accessdate=5 January 2018 |url=https://www.newvision.co.ug/digital_assets/a1cd019e-418b-4297-8260-ba308df58da0/32-ERA-Full-pg.pdf | location=Kampala |  publisher=[[Electricity Regulatory Authority]] (ERA) | author=ERA | title=Regional Power Transmission Projects}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The power line starts at the [[Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited]] (UETCL) 220kV substation in Masaka. The line travels in a general southwesterly direction to [[Mutukula, Uganda|Mutukula]], at the international border with Tanzania. From Mutukula, the power line continues in a general southeasterly direction to [[Bukoba]], on the western shores of [[Lake Victoria]]. From Bukoba, the line loops around the lake, and continues eastwards to end at [[Mwanza]]. The Ugandan portion of the power line measures {{convert|82|km|0}}.&lt;ref name="Two"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.uetcl.com/index.php/site-administrator/projects-at-feasibility-study | title=Projects Under Feasibility Study | accessdate=5 January 2018 | location=Kampala| date=5 January 2018 | publisher=[[Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited]] (UETCL) | author=UETCL}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distance travelled by the power line in Tanzania is approximately {{convert|500|km|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/Tanzania_Distance_Result.asp?fromplace=Mutukula%2C%20Kagera%20Region%2C%20Tanzania&amp;toplace=Mwanza%2C%20Mwanza%20Region%2C%20Tanzania&amp;dt1=ChIJ4VEv6An32RkR9d1qWvXy3OY&amp;dt2=ChIJkfuMScZkzhkRHaUjfwomKXU | title=Distance between Mutukula, Kagera Region, Tanzania and Mwanza, Mwanza Region, Tanzania |accessdate=5 January 2017 |last=Globefeed.com |publisher=Globefeed.com |date=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5281">The '''multivariate ENSO index''', abbreviated as MEI, is a method used to characterize the intensity of an [[El Niño Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO) event. Given that ENSO arises from a complex interaction of a variety of climate systems, MEI is regarded as the most comprehensive index for monitoring ENSO since it combines analysis of multiple meteorological and oceanographic components.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;Mazzarella, A., A. Giuliacci, and N. Scafetta.

== Overview ==

MEI is determined as the first principal component of six different parameters: sea level pressure, zonal and meridional components of the surface wind, sea surface temperature, surface air temperature and cloudiness using data from the [[International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set]] (ICOADS ).&lt;ref name="five"&gt;Wolter, Klaus.

Web. 24 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; MEI is calculated twelve times per year for each “sliding bi-monthly season”, characterized as January–February, February–March, March–April, and so on.&lt;ref name="five" /&gt; Large positive MEI values indicate the occurrence of [[El Niño]] conditions, while large negative MEI values indicate the occurrence of [[La Niña]] conditions.&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;

== Extended MEI ==

While the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) has recorded MEI values from 1950 to the present, various researchers have cited the need for data before 1950 in order to better characterize typical ENSO behavior versus unusual occurrences that may be a result of climate change.&lt;ref name="three" /&gt; According to some sources, it is inadvisable to attempt to calculate MEI before 1950 given that environmental measurements were unreliable during the World Wars and there was a revolution in virtually all meteorological measurement methods on ships during the 1940s.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;Wolter, Klaus, and Michael S. Timlin. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.1477-8696.1998.tb06408.x/abstract "Measuring the Strength of ENSO Events: How Does 1997/98 Rank?"] Weather 53.9 (1998): 315-24.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a module known as “Extended MEI” or “MEI.txt” has been created that estimates MEI values from as far back as 1871.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;Wolter, Klaus, and Michael S. Timlin. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.2336/abstract "El Niño/Southern Oscillation Behaviour since 1871 as Diagnosed in an Extended Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI.ext)."] International Journal of Climatology 31.7 (2011): 1074-87.&lt;/ref&gt; This was accomplished by using reconstructed data on sea level pressure and sea surface temperature, the two components thought to be most influential to determining MEI. Plots comparing MEI and MEI.ext values have shown that data from both methods are highly correlated, supporting the accuracy and effectiveness of MEI.ext.&lt;ref name="three" /&gt;

== Alternate indexes ==

=== Southern Oscillation Index ===

The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) is calculated based on the sea level pressure difference between Tahiti and Darwin, Australia.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; Despite being used frequently in ENSO studies, it is not considered as reliable as MEI given that it only takes into account one environmental variable.

=== Niño 3.4 SST ===

Similar to SOI, Niño 3.4 SST uses one parameter – sea surface temperature – to characterize ENSO. The Niño 3.4 SST region consists of temperature measurements from between 5° N – 5° S and 120° – 170° W.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;Gergis, Joelle L., and Anthony M. Fowler. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.1202/full "Classification of Synchronous Oceanic and Atmospheric El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Events for Palaeoclimate Reconstruction."] International Journal of Climatology 25 (2005): 1541-65&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coupled ENSO Index ===

The Coupled ENSO Index (CEI) uses a combination of both the SOI and Niño 3.4 SST to account for both an atmospheric and oceanic component.&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;

=== Proxy-based ENSO Index ===

Developed by Braganza, et al., 2009, this index uses coral, tree ring and ice core data to characterize ENSO events from 1525 – 1982. The proxy ENSO index covers a wide area across the Pacific, and includes data from the western and central Pacific, New Zealand, and subtropical North America. Although the proxy ENSO index covers a large time scale of over four centuries, it shows high correlation (&gt; 40%) with the SOI, Niño 3.4 SST and CEI, indicating its accuracy and utility.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;Braganza, Karl, Joelle L. Gergis, Scott B. Power, James S. Risbey, and Anthony M. Fowler. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2008JD010896/abstract "A Multiproxy Index of the El Nin ̃o–Southern Oscillation, A.D. 1525– 1982."] Journal of Geophysical Research 114 (2009): 1-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neoprene''' (also '''polychloroprene''' or '''pc-rubber''') is a family of [[synthetic rubber]]s that are produced by polymerization of [[chloroprene]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Werner Obrecht, Jean-Pierre Lambert, Michael Happ, Christiane Oppenheimer-Stix, John Dunn and Ralf Krüger "Rubber, 4. Emulsion Rubbers" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2012, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.  {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.o23_o01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neoprene exhibits good chemical stability and maintains flexibility over a wide temperature range. Neoprene is sold either as solid rubber or in [[latex]] form and is used in a wide variety of applications, such as [[laptop]] sleeves, [[orthopaedic]] braces (wrist, knee, etc.), [[electricity|electrical]] [[electrical insulation|insulation]], liquid and sheet applied elastomeric membranes or flashings, and [[Motor vehicle|automotive]] fan [[belt (mechanical)|belt]]s.&lt;ref name="dpe2003"&gt;{{cite web | title=Technical information — Neoprene | publisher=''Du Pont Performance Elastomers'' |date=October 2003 | url=http://www.dupontelastomers.com/literature/neoprene/585E7A59DA93810F6B1A7900D3712585.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Neoprene is produced by free-radical polymerization of [[chloroprene]]. In commercial production, this polymer is prepared by free radical emulsion polymerization. Polymerization is initiated using [[potassium persulfate]]. Bifunctional nucleophiles, metal oxides (e.g. zinc oxide), and [[thiourea]]s are used to crosslink individual polymer strands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Chloroprene Polymers | author = Furman E.

==History==
Neoprene was invented by [[DuPont]] scientists on April 17, 1930 after Dr [[Elmer Keiser Bolton|Elmer K. Bolton]] of DuPont attended a lecture by [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Fr]] [[Julius Arthur Nieuwland]], a professor of [[chemistry]] at the [[University of Notre Dame]]. Nieuwland's research was focused on [[acetylene]] chemistry and during the course of his work he produced divinyl acetylene, a jelly that firms into an elastic compound similar to rubber when passed over [[sulfur dichloride]]. After DuPont purchased the [[patent]] rights from the university, [[Wallace Carothers]] of DuPont took over commercial development of Nieuwland's discovery in collaboration with Nieuwland himself. [[Arnold M. Collins|Arnold Collins]] at DuPont focused on monovinyl acetylene and allowed it to react with [[hydrogen chloride]] gas, manufacturing [[chloroprene]].&lt;ref&gt;John K. Smith.  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3104528 The Ten-Year Invention: Neoprene and Du Pont Research, 1930–1939]. Technology and Culture 26(1):34-55 January 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

DuPont first marketed the compound in 1931 under the trade name DuPrene,&lt;ref name=DPOverview&gt;{{cite web|title=Neoprene : 1930 - Overview|url=http://www2.dupont.com/Heritage/en_US/1930_dupont/1930_neoprene_overview.html|work=DuPont Heritage|publisher=DuPont|accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its commercial possibilities were limited by the original manufacturing process, which left the product with a foul odor.&lt;ref name="HounshellSmith"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hounshell|first1=David A.|last2=Smith|first2=John Kenly|title=Science and Corporate Strategy : Du Pont R&amp;D, 1902-1980|pages=253–257|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge [Cambridgeshire]|isbn=0-521-32767-9|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new process was developed, which eliminated the odor-causing byproducts and halved production costs, and the company began selling the material to manufacturers of finished end-products.&lt;ref name="HounshellSmith" /&gt; To prevent shoddy manufacturers from harming the product's reputation, the trademark DuPrene was restricted to apply only to the material sold by DuPont.&lt;ref name="HounshellSmith" /&gt; Since the company itself did not manufacture any DuPrene-containing end products, the trademark was dropped in 1937 and replaced with a generic name, neoprene, in an attempt "to signify that the material is an ingredient, not a finished consumer product".&lt;ref name=DPInDepth&gt;{{cite web|title=Neoprene : 1930 - In Depth|url=http://www2.dupont.com/Heritage/en_US/1930_dupont/1930_neoprene_indepth.html|work=DuPont Heritage|publisher=DuPont|accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; DuPont then worked extensively to generate demand for its product, implementing a marketing strategy that included publishing its own technical journal, which extensively publicized neoprene's uses as well as advertising other companies' neoprene-based products.&lt;ref name="HounshellSmith" /&gt; By 1939, sales of neoprene were generating profits over $300,000 for the company ({{Inflation|US|300000|1939|fmt=eq}}).&lt;ref name="HounshellSmith" /&gt;

==Applications==
===General===
Neoprene resists degradation more than [[natural rubber|natural]] or [[synthetic rubber]].  This relative inertness makes it well suited for demanding applications such as [[gasket]]s, [[hose (tubing)|hose]]s, and [[corrosion]]-resistant [[coating]]s.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; It can be used as a base for [[adhesive]]s, noise isolation in power [[transformer]] installations, and as padding in external metal cases to protect the contents while allowing a snug fit. It resists burning better than exclusively [[hydrocarbon]] based rubbers,&lt;ref name="dpe1"&gt;{{cite web | title=Neoprene - polychloroprene | publisher=''DuPont Elastomers'' | url=http://www.dupontelastomers.com/Products/neoprene/neoprene.asp?id=wikineo | accessdate=2008-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in its appearance in weather stripping for [[fire door]]s and in combat related attire such as gloves and face masks. Because of its tolerance of extreme conditions, neoprene is used to line landfills. Neoprene's burn point is around 260&amp;nbsp;°C (500&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msds.dupont.com/msds/pdfs/EN/PEN_09004a35803d9eb8.pdf|title=3E Protect|website=Msds.dupont.com|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In its native state, neoprene is a very pliable rubber-like material with insulating properties similar to rubber or other solid plastics.

Neoprene foam is used in many applications and is produced in either closed-cell or open-cell form. The closed-cell form is [[waterproof]], less compressible and more expensive. The open-cell form can be [[breathable]]. It is manufactured by foaming the plastic with [[nitrogen]] gas, for the insulation properties of the tiny enclosed and separated gas bubbles (nitrogen is used for chemical convenience, not because it is superior to air as an insulator{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}).

===Civil engineering===
Neoprene is used as a load bearing base, usually between two prefabricated reinforced concrete elements or steel plates as well to evenly guide force from one element to another.&lt;ref&gt;Damon Allen.  [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267957641_STIFFNESS_EVALUATION_OF_NEOPRENE_BEARING_PADS_UNDER_LONG-TERM_LOADS Stiffness Evaluation of Neoprene Bearing Pads under Long-Term Loads].  A Dissertation Presented to the Graduate School of The University Of Florida in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy. University Of Florida 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aquatics===
Neoprene is a popular material in making protective clothing for aquatic activities. Foamed neoprene is commonly used to make [[fly fishing]] waders and [[wetsuit]]s, as it provides excellent insulation against cold. The foam is quite buoyant, and divers compensate for this by wearing weights. Thick wet suits made at the extreme end of their cold water protection are usually made of 7&amp;nbsp;mm thick neoprene.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}} Since foam neoprene contains gas pockets, the material compresses under water pressure, getting thinner at greater depths; a 7&amp;nbsp;mm neoprene wet suit offers much less exposure protection under 100 feet of water than at the surface. A recent advance in neoprene for wet suits is the "super-flex" variety, which mixes [[spandex]] into the neoprene for greater flexibility.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}

Neoprene waders are usually about 5&amp;nbsp;mm thick, and in the medium price range as compared to cheaper materials such as [[nylon]] and more expensive waterproof fabrics made with breathable membranes.

Competitive swimming wetsuits are made of the most expanded foam; they have to be very flexible to allow the swimmer unrestricted movement. The downside is that they are quite fragile.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}

===Home accessories===
Recently, neoprene has become a favorite material for lifestyle and other home accessories including [[laptop]] sleeves, [[Tablet computer|tablet]] holders, [[remote control]]s, [[mouse pad]]s, and cycling chamois. In this market, it sometimes competes with [[LRPu]] (low-resilience polyurethane), which is a sturdier (more impact-resistant) but less-used material.

===Music===
[[File:Neoprene pants.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A woman wearing neoprene [[leggings]]]]
The [[Rhodes piano]] used hammer tips made of neoprene in its electric pianos, after changing from felt hammers around 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fenderrhodes.com/service/hammer-tips.html|title=Steve's Corner - Hammer Tips|website=Fenderrhodes.com|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoprene is also used for speaker cones and drum practice pads.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

===Hydroponic gardening===
[[Hydroponics|Hydroponic]] and aerated gardening systems make use of small neoprene inserts to hold plants in place while propagating cuttings or using net cups. Inserts are relatively small, ranging in size from {{convert|1.5|to|5|in|cm|0}}. Neoprene is a good choice for supporting plants because of its flexibility and softness, allowing plants to be held securely in place without the chance of causing damage to the stem. Neoprene root covers also help block out light from entering the rooting chamber of hydroponic systems, allowing for better root growth and to help deter the growth of algae.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}

===Automotive Industry===
In automotive industry, neoprene is often used as a material for car seats or car seat covers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seat Covers Materials |url=https://www.carid.com/coverking/info/materials.html#cr-grade-neoprene |publisher=CARiD.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Due to being wear-resistant and its protective characteristics, many car makers offer neoprene seats as an option for additional seat protection. Such seat covers are also included into vehicle packages for active drivers. Neoprene is based on a rubber layer for seat protection against moisture.

===Other===
Neoprene is used for [[Halloween]] masks and masks used for face protection, for insulating [[CPU socket]]s, to make waterproof automotive seat covers, in liquid and sheet-applied elastomeric roof membranes or flashings, and in a neoprene-[[spandex]] mixture for manufacture of [[wheelchair]] positioning harnesses. Because of its chemical resistance and overall durability, neoprene is sometimes used in the manufacture of dishwashing gloves, especially as an alternative to [[latex]]. In fashion, neoprene has been used by designers such as [[Gareth Pugh]], [[Balenciaga]], [[Rick Owens]], [[Lanvin (clothing)|Lanvin]] and [[Vera Wang]]. This trend, promoted by street style bloggers such as Jim Joquico of Fashion Chameleon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fashionchameleon.ae/2015/12/neoprene-when-fashion-hijacked-chemistry/|title=Neoprene: When fashion hijacked chemistry|work=Fashion Chameleon}}&lt;/ref&gt; gained traction and trickled down to mainstream fashion around 2014.

==Precautions==
Some people are allergic to neoprene while others can get dermatitis from [[thiourea]] residues left from its production. The most common [[Vulcanizing accelerators|accelerator]] in the [[vulcanization]] of polychloroprene is [[ethylene thiourea]] (ETU), which has been classified as [[reprotoxic]]. The European rubber industry project called SafeRubber focused on alternatives to the use of ETU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/96346_en.html|title=A Safer Alternative Replacement for Thiourea Based Accelerators in the Production Process of Chloroprene Rubber|website=cordis.europa.eu|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3986">{{Thermoelectric effect|cTopic=Principles}}
In physics and chemistry, the '''Nernst effect''' (also termed first '''Nernst–Ettingshausen effect''', after [[Walther Nernst]] and [[Albert von Ettingshausen]]) is a [[thermoelectric effect|thermoelectric]] (or thermomagnetic) phenomenon observed when a sample allowing [[electrical conduction]] is subjected to a [[magnetic field]] and a temperature gradient normal (perpendicular) to each other. An [[electric field]] will be induced normal to both.

This effect is quantified by the Nernst coefficient |''N''|, which is defined to be

::&lt;math&gt;|N|=\frac{E_Y/B_Z}{dT/dx}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;E_Y&lt;/math&gt; is the [[y-component]] of the electric field that results from the magnetic field's [[z-component]] &lt;math&gt;B_Z&lt;/math&gt; and the temperature gradient &lt;math&gt;dT/dx&lt;/math&gt;.

The reverse process is known as the [[Ettingshausen effect]] and also as the second Nernst–Ettingshausen effect.

== Physical picture ==

[[electron mobility|Mobile]] energy carriers (for example [[conduction band|conduction-band]] [[electron]]s in a [[semiconductor]]) will move along [[temperature]] gradients due to statistics and the relationship
between temperature and kinetic energy. If there is a [[magnetic field]] transversal to the temperature gradient and the carriers are [[electric charge|electrically charged]], they experience a [[lorentz force|force]] perpendicular to their direction of motion (also the direction of the temperature gradient) and to the magnetic field. Thus, a perpendicular electric field is induced.

== Sample types ==

Semiconductors exhibit the Nernst effect. This has been studied in the 1950s by Krylova, Mochan and many others. In [[metal]]s however, it is almost non-existent. It appears in the [[quantum vortex|vortex phase]]
of type-II [[superconductor]]s due to vortex motion. This has been studied by Huebener et al. High-temperature superconductors exhibit the Nernst effect both in the superconducting and in the [[pseudogap|pseudogap phase]], as was first found by Xu et al. [[heavy fermion|Heavy-Fermion]] superconductors can show a strong Nernst signal which is likely not due to the vortices, as was found by Bel et al.

The '''Olmsted Locks and Dam''' is a [[Lock (water transport)|locks]] and concrete [[dam]] on the [[Ohio River]] at river mile 964.4. The project is intended to reduce tow and barge delays by replacing the existing older, and frequently congested, locks and dams [[Lock and Dam Number 52|Number 52]] and [[Lock and Dam Number 53|Number 53]]. The locks are located about 17 miles upstream from the [[confluence]] of the Ohio and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] rivers at [[Olmsted, Illinois]].

The project is operational while the removal of Locks and Dams 52 and 53 should be completed around 2020. The project is both the largest and the most expensive inland waterway project ever undertaken in the United States.&lt;ref name="corpsofengineers"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lrl.usace.army.mil/Missions/Civil-Works/Navigation/Locks-and-Dams/Olmsted-Locks-and-Dam/|title=Olmsted Locks and Dam|website=Louisville District|publisher=[[United States Army Corps of Engineers]]|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The US Congress, through the Water Resources and Development Act of 1988&lt;ref name="GAP2017"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gao.gov/assets/690/682825.pdf | title=Factors Contributing to Cost Increases and Schedule Delays in the Olmsted Locks and Dam Project | publisher=[[Government Accountability Office]] | date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; first approved a $775 million budget for the project in 1988 (October 1987 Price Levels). The lock chambers, completed in 2002, are  {{convert|110|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|1200|ft|m}} long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Olmsted Locks and Dam - Project Description|url=http://www.lrl.usace.army.mil/Missions/CivilWorks/Navigation/LocksandDams/OlmstedLocksandDam/Project.aspx|publisher=[[United States Army Corps of Engineers]]|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|US Army Corps of Engineers]], the new dam and locks will reduce passage time to under one hour with the new system.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}  Due to queuing at [[Lock and Dam Number 52]] and [[Lock and Dam Number 53]], it can take cargo traffic 15 to 20 hours each to transit the locks the Olmsted complex is intended to replace.&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt;

When initiated the complex was projected to cost $775 million.&lt;ref name="NYT2"/&gt;  As of February 2018, the estimated cost of the project is over $3 billion.&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schneider|first1=Keith|title=On Books Since 1988, Ohio River Dam Project Keeps Rolling Along|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/19/us/19dam.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 18, 2014|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kelley|first1=Tyler J.|title=Choke Point of a Nation: The High Cost of an Aging River Lock|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/23/business/economy/desperately-plugging-holes-in-an-87-year-old-dam.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 23, 2016|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the project was initially scheduled for completion in 1998, by 2016 it was projected to become operational between 2018&lt;ref name="NYT2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Illioisian1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mariano|first1=Nick|title=Years overdue, billions overbudget: Olmsted engineers predict the project will be operational in 2018|url=http://thesouthern.com/news/local/years-overdue-billions-overbudget-olmsted-engineers-predict-the-project-will/article_96e07d92-d9cf-5dc3-af7e-1316b1315bd6.html|website=The Southern Illioisian|accessdate=November 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 2020, Locks and Dams 52 and 53 would be decommissioned.&lt;ref name="WKMS1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schimmel|first1=Becca|title='Sticky Wicket' Clogs Ohio River Traffic|url=http://wkms.org/post/sticky-wicket-clogs-ohio-river-traffic|website=WKMS NPR|date=September 14, 2016|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KFVS1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cavagnaro|first1=Hank|title=Ohio River Locks and Dam 52 reopens|url=http://www.kfvs12.com/story/33087606/ohio-river-locks-and-dam-52-reopens|website=KFVS12.com|accessdate=November 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] (USACE), the Federal agency responsible for maintaining navigation on the USA's rivers, estimates the delay in completing the project results in a yearly loss of about $640 million to $800 million in lost benefits to the nation. While calculating these benefits is complex because of the amount of variables considered, it essentially takes into account the reduced costs industry (or businesses using the river for commerce) would experience if the Olmsted Project was operational versus the current means of transit through the aging and often unreliable Locks and Dams 52 and 53. These benefits further calculate the reduced costs in moving cargo through the river versus the next available cheapest alternative, usually by rail or by truck.&lt;ref name="GAP2017"/&gt;

== In-the-wet construction ==
The Locks and Dams 52 and 53 Replacement Project, better known as the Olmsted Locks and Dam Project makes use of the innovative in-the-wet construction. When a dam is constructed on a small river, engineers usually create a cofferdam (or a enclosure) within a river and drain the water out of it to facilitate construction. However, building this entire project through the use of cofferdams would have been incredibly impeding to river traffic. As the hub of the Inland waterways, the largest transit point in the nation's river system where approximately 90 million tons of goods pass through each year, blocking large parts of the river would have caused major delays to river traffic even more so than evidenced at Locks and Dams 52 and 53.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publications.usace.army.mil/Portals/76/Publications/EngineerManuals/EM_1110-2-2611.pdf?ver=2013-09-04-072936-400|title=Engineering for Prefabricated Construction of Navigation Project|date=1 February 2004|publisher=[[United States Army Corps of Engineers]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Olmsted dam project.jpeg|thumb|412x412px|Site of the Olmsted Project. Notice the on-land casting yard where concrete elements of the dam are built and then transported into the river for placement.]]
Engineers instead chose to construct the dam portion of the project using the in-the-wet technique, where concrete portions of the dam itself, were built offsite at a concrete casting yard, transported into the river for placement, and placed on the bottom of the river, all with minimal disruption to the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Working in the dry: Cofferdams, in-river construction, and the United States Army Corps of Engineers |url=http://www.lrp.usace.army.mil/Portals/72/docs/Library/workinginthedry.pdf |last=O'Bannon|first=Patrick|publisher=[[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] |year=2009 |isbn= |location=Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania |website=Pittsburgh District}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Problems with the project - cost increases ==
This has been perhaps the longest and largest civil works project in the history of the Corps of Engineers. Multiple delays, especially in funding have created a 30 year endeavor that has been inflated from a $700+ million price tag to over $3 billion in early 2018.&lt;ref name="GAP2017"/&gt;

The biggest contributors to these increases have been:
* Delays in funding and lack of availability of appropriations
* Costs increases of materials over time 
* Low initial budget proposal for the project (engineers underestimated the initial costs of the project)
* In-the-wet construction
* Cost-reimbursable contracts (where the Government carries the majority of the risk of development)
* Unforeseen engineering problems 
* Stretching of the budget (the USACE had and has other projects that require funds which were in turn taken away from Olmsted)
* Inflation 
* Changes in design to the project
* Unpredictable river conditions

'''Pneumatic chemistry''' is a term most-closely identified with an area of [[scientific research]] of the seventeenth, eighteenth, and early nineteenth centuries.  Important goals of this work were an understanding of the physical properties of [[gas]]es and how they relate to [[chemical reaction]]s and, ultimately, the composition of [[matter]].

In the eighteenth century, as the field of [[chemistry]] was evolving from [[alchemy]], a field of the [[natural philosophy]] was created around the idea of air as a [[reagent]]. Before this, air was primarily considered a static substance that would not react and simply existed. However, as [[Lavoisier]] and several other pneumatic chemists would insist, the air was indeed dynamic, and would not only be influenced by combusted material, but would also influence the properties of different substances.

The initial concern of pneumatic chemistry was combustion reactions, beginning with [[Stephen Hales]]. These reactions would give off different "airs" as chemists would call them, and these different airs contained more simple substances. Until Lavoisier, these airs were considered separate entities with different properties; Lavoisier was responsible largely for changing the idea of air as being constituted by these different airs that his contemporaries and earlier chemists had discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Transforming Matter|last = Levere|first = Trevor|publisher = The Johns Hopkins University Press|year = 2001|isbn = 0-8018-6610-3|location = Maryland|pages = 62–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This study of gases was brought about by Hales with the invention of the pneumatic trough, an instrument capable of collecting the gas given off by reactions with reproducible results. The term ''gas'' was coined by [[Jan Baptist van Helmont|J. B. van Helmont]], in the early seventeenth century. This term was derived from the Greek word chaos as a result of his inability to collect properly the substances given off by reactions, as he was the first natural philosopher to make an attempt at carefully studying the third type of matter. However, it was not until Lavoisier performed his research in the eighteenth century that the word was used universally by scientists as a replacement for ''airs''.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal

== History ==

=== Eighteenth century ===

The pneumatic trough was integral thereon in work with gases (or, as contemporary chemists called them, airs). Work done by Joseph Black, Joseph Priestley, Herman Boerhaave, and Henry Cavendish revolved largely around the use of the instrument, allowing them to collect airs given off by different chemical reactions and combustion analyses. Their work led to the discovery of many types of airs, such as dephlogisticated air (discovered by Joseph Priestley).

Moreover, the chemistry of airs was not limited to combustion analyses. During the eighteenth century, many chymists used the discovery of airs as a new path for exploring old problems, with one example being the field of medicinal chemistry. One particular Englishman, James Watt, began to take the idea of airs and use them in what was referred to as ''pneumatic therapy'', or the use of airs to make laboratories more workable with fresh airs and also aid patients with different illnesses, with varying degrees of success. Most human experimentation done was performed on the chymists themselves, as they believed that self-experimentation was a necessary part or progressing the field.

== Contributors ==

=== James Watt ===
[[James Watt]]'s research in pneumatic chemistry involved the use of inflammable (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[Dephlogisticated air|dephlogisticated]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) airs to create water.  In 1783, James Watt showed that water was composed of inflammable and dephlogisticated airs, and that the masses of gases before combustion were exactly equal to the mass of water after combustion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=James Watt|last=Carnegie|first=Andrew|publisher=Doubleday, Page and Company|year=1905|isbn=|location=New York|pages=170–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Until this point, water was viewed as a fundamental element rather than a compound.  James Watt also sought to explore the use of different airs in medical treatments as "pneumatic therapy" by collaborating with Dr. [[Thomas Beddoes]] to treat his daughter Jessie Watt using fixed air.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stansfield|first=Dorothy|date=1986|title=Dr Thomas Beddoes and James Watts: Preparatory Work 1794-96 for the Bristol Pneumatic Institute|url=|journal=Medical History|volume=30|pages=283|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Joseph Black ===
[[Joseph Black]] was a chemist that took interest in the pneumatic field after studying under [[William Cullen]]. He was first interested in the topic of magnesia alba, or [[magnesium carbonate]], and limestone, or [[calcium carbonate]], and wrote a dissertation called "De Humore acido a cibis orto, et magnesia alba" on the properties of both.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=West|first=John|date=June 15, 2014|title=Joseph Black, carbon dioxide, latent heat, and the beginnings of the discovery of the respiratory gases|url=https://www.physiology.org/doi/10.1152/ajplung.00020.2014|journal=American Journal of Physiology|volume=306|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His experiments on magnesium carbonate led him to discover that fixed air, or [[carbon dioxide]], was being given off during reactions with various chemicals, including breathing. Despite him never using the pneumatic trough or other instrumentation invented to collect and analyze the airs, his inferences led to more research into fixed air instead of common air, with the trough actually being used.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

After moving on to Glasgow to teach, Black turned his interests to the topic of heat. Through his experiments with ice and water, he made several discoveries about the [[Latent Heat of Fusion|latent heat of fusion]] and the latent heat of freezing water, as well as working extensively with specific heats of a number of liquids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dominiczak|first=Marek|date=November 2011|title=William Cullen and Joesph Black: Chamistry, Medicine, and the Scottish Enlightenment|url=https://search-proquest-com.libproxy.mst.edu/docview/1020570288?pq-origsite=summon&amp;accountid=14594|journal=Clinical Chemistry|volume=57|pages=|via=library.mst.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Joseph Priestley ===
[[Joseph Priestley]], in ''Observations on different kinds of air,'' was one of the first people to describe air as being composed of different states of matter, and not as one element.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McEvoy|first=John|date=March 2015|title=Gases, God and the balance of nature: a commentary on Priestley (1772) 'Observations on different kinds of air'|url=http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/373/2039/20140229|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|volume=373|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Priestley elaborated on the notions of fixed air (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[mephitic air]] and inflammable air to include "inflammable nitrous air," "[[vitriolic acid air]]," "[[alkaline air]]" and "[[Phlogiston theory|dephlogisticated air]]".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Priestley also described the process of [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] in terms of [[phlogiston theory]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Priestley also established a process for treating [[scurvy]] and other ailments using fixed air in his ''Directions for impregnating water with fixed air.'' Priestley's work on pneumatic chemistry had an influence on his natural world views. His belief in an "aerial economy" stemmed from his belief in "dephlogisticated air" being the purest type of air and that phlogiston and combustion were at the heart of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Making Modern Science: A Historical Survey|last=Bowler|first=Peter|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=2005|isbn=0-226-06861-7|location=The University of Chicago|pages=61–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Joseph Priestley chiefly researched with the pneumatic trough, but he was responsible for collecting several new [[Water soluble|water-soluble]] airs. This was achieved primarily by his substitution of mercury for water, and implementing a shelf under the head for increased stability, capitalizing on the idea Cavendish proposed and popularizing the mercury pneumatic trough.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Herman Boerhaave ===
While not credited for direct research into the field of pneumatic chemistry, [[Herman Boerhaave|Boerhaave]] (teacher, researcher, and scholar) did publish the ''Elementa Chimiae'' in 1727. This treatise included support for Hales' work and also elaborated upon the idea of airs. Despite not publishing his own research, this section on airs in the ''Elementa Chimie'' was cited by many other contemporaries and contained much of the current knowledge of the properties of airs.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kirker|first=Milton|date=1955|title=Herman Boerhaave and the Development of Pneumatic Chemistry|jstor=226823|journal=Isis|volume=46|pages=36–49|doi=10.1086/348382}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boerhaave is also credited with adding to the world of chemical thermometry through his work with Daniel Fahrenheit, also discussed in ''Elementa Chimiae.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Powers|first=John C.|date=January 1, 2014|title=Measuring Fire: Herman Boerhaave and the Introduction of Thermometry into Chemistry|url=https://www-jstor-org.libproxy.mst.edu/stable/10.1086/678102?pq-origsite=summon&amp;seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|journal=The University of Chicago Press|volume=29|pages=158–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Henry Cavendish ===
[[Henry Cavendish]], despite not being the first to replace water in the trough with [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], he was among the first to observe that fixed air was insoluble over mercury and therefore could be collected more efficiently using the adapted instrument. He also characterized fixed air (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and inflammable air (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Inflammable air was one of the first gases isolated and discovered using the pneumatic trough. However, he did not exploit his own idea to its limit, and therefore did not use the mercury pneumatic trough to its full extent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Cavendish is credited with nearly correctly analyzing the content of gases in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cavendish|last=Jungnickel|first=Christa|publisher=American Philosophical Society|year=1996|isbn=0-87169-220-1|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cavendish also showed that [[inflammable air]] and [[atmospheric air]] could be combined and heated to produce water in 1784.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Stephen Hales ===
In the eighteenth century, with the rise of combustion analysis in chemistry, [[Stephen Hales]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; invented the pneumatic trough in order to collect gases from the samples of matter he used; while uninterested in the properties of the gases he collected, he wanted to explore how much gas was given off from the materials he burned or let ferment. Hales was successful in preventing the air from losing its "elasticity," i.e. preventing it from experiencing a loss in volume, by bubbling the gas through water, and therefore dissolving the soluble gases.

After the invention of the pneumatic trough, Stephen Hales continued his research into the different airs, and performed many Newtonian analyses of the various properties of them. He published his book ''Vegetable Staticks'' in 1727, which had a profound impact on the field of pneumatic chemistry, as many researchers cited this in their academic papers. In ''Vegetable Staticks'', Hales not only introduced his trough, but also the results he obtained from collected the air, such as the elasticity and composition of airs along with their ability to mix with others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kirker|first=Milton|date=1955|title=Herman Boerhaave and the Development of Pneumatic Chemistry|url=|journal=Isis|volume=46|pages=36–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Instrumentation ==

=== Pneumatic trough ===
Stephen Hales, called the creator of pneumatic chemistry, created the [[pneumatic trough]] in 1727.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transforming Matter|last=Levere|first=Trevor|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-8018-6610-3|location=Maryland|pages=52–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; This instrument was widely used by many chemists to explore the properties of different airs, such as what was called inflammable air (what is modernly called hydrogen). Lavoisier used this in addition to his gasometer to collect gases and analyze them, aiding him in creating his list of simple substances.
[[File:Stephen Hale - pneumatic trough.jpg|thumb|The pneumatic trough, invented by Hales in the 1700s. This was the initial model, used for collection of airs by combustion.]]
The pneumatic trough, while integral throughout the eighteenth century, was modified several times to collect gases more efficiently or just to collect more gas. For example, Cavendish noted that the amount of fixed air that was given off by a reaction was not entirely present above the water; this meant that fixed water was absorbing some of this air, and could not be used quantitatively to collect that particular air. So, he replaced the water in the trough with mercury instead, in which most airs were not soluble. By doing so, he could not only collect all airs given off by a reaction, but he could also determine the solubility of airs in water, beginning a new area of research for pneumatic chemists. While this was the major adaptation of the trough in the eighteenth century, several minor changes were made before and after this substitution of mercury for water, such as adding a shelf to rest the head on while gas collection occurred. This shelf would also allow for less conventional heads to be used, such as Brownrigg's animal bladder.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Gasometer ===
During his chemical revolution, Lavoisier created a new instrument for precisely measuring out gases. He called this instrument the ''gazomèter'' He had two different versions; the one he used in demonstrations to the Academie and to the public, which was a large expensive version meant to make people believe that it had a large precision, and the smaller, more lab practical version with a similar precision. This more practical version was cheaper to construct, allowing more chemists to use Lavoisier's instrument.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A '''potentiometer''' is a three-[[terminal (electronics)|terminal]] [[resistor]] with a sliding or rotating contact that forms an adjustable  [[voltage divider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Authoritative Dictionary of IEEE Standards Terms (IEEE 100) | edition = seventh | publisher = IEEE Press | location = Piscataway, New Jersey | isbn = 0-7381-2601-2 | year = 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If only two terminals are used, one end and the wiper, it acts as a '''''variable resistor''''' or [[#Rheostat|'''''rheostat''''']].

The measuring instrument called a [[Potentiometer (measuring instrument)|potentiometer]] is essentially a [[voltage divider]] used for measuring [[electric potential]] (voltage); the component is an implementation of the same principle, hence its name.

Potentiometers are commonly used to control electrical devices such as volume controls on audio equipment. Potentiometers operated by a mechanism can be used as position [[transducer]]s, for example, in a [[joystick]]. Potentiometers are rarely used to directly control significant power (more than a [[watt]]), since the power dissipated in the potentiometer would be comparable to the power in the controlled load.

==Nomenclature==
There are a number of terms in the electronics industry used to describe certain types of potentiometers:

* '''slide pot''' or '''slider pot''': a potentiometer that is adjusted by sliding the wiper left or right (or up and down, depending on the installation), usually with a finger or thumb
* '''thumb pot''' or '''thumbwheel pot''': a small rotating potentiometer meant to be adjusted infrequently by means of a small thumbwheel
* '''trimpot''' or '''trimmer pot''': a [[Trimmer (electronics)|trimmer]] potentiometer typically meant to be adjusted once or infrequently for "fine-tuning" an electrical signal

== Construction ==
[[File:Potentiometer cutaway drawing.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Drawing of potentiometer with case cut away, showing parts: (''A'') shaft, (''B'') stationary carbon composition resistance element, (''C'') phosphor bronze wiper, (''D'') shaft attached to wiper, (''E, G'') terminals connected to ends of resistance element, (''F'') terminal connected to wiper. A mechanical stop (''H'') prevents rotation past end points.]]
[[File:Single-turn potentiometer with internals exposed, oblique view.jpg|thumb|Single-turn potentiometer with metal casing removed to expose wiper contacts and resistive track]]

Potentiometers consist of a [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|resistive element]], a sliding contact (wiper) that moves along the element, making good electrical contact with one part of it, electrical terminals at each end of the element, a mechanism that moves the wiper from one end to the other, and a housing containing the element and wiper.

See drawing. Many inexpensive potentiometers are constructed with a resistive element ''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;(B)&lt;/span&gt;'' formed into an arc of a circle usually a little less than a full turn and a wiper ''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;(C)&lt;/span&gt;'' sliding on this element when rotated, making electrical contact. The resistive element can be flat or angled.  Each end of the resistive element is connected to a terminal ''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;(E, G)&lt;/span&gt;'' on the case.  The wiper is connected to a third terminal ''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;(F)&lt;/span&gt;'', usually between the other two.  On panel potentiometers, the wiper is usually the center terminal of three. For single-turn potentiometers, this wiper typically travels just under one revolution around the contact. The only point of ingress for contamination is the narrow space between the shaft and the housing it rotates in.

Another type is the linear slider potentiometer, which has a wiper which slides along a linear element instead of rotating. Contamination can potentially enter anywhere along the slot the slider moves in, making effective sealing more difficult and compromising long-term reliability. An advantage of the slider potentiometer is that the slider position gives a visual indication of its setting. While the setting of a rotary potentiometer can be seen by the position of a marking on the knob, an array of sliders can give a visual impression of, for example, the effect of a multi-band [[Equalization (audio)|equalizer]] (hence the term "graphic equalizer").

The resistive element of inexpensive potentiometers is often made of [[graphite]]. Other materials used include resistance wire, carbon particles in plastic, and a ceramic/metal mixture called [[cermet]].
Conductive track potentiometers use conductive polymer resistor pastes that contain hard-wearing resins and polymers, solvents, and lubricant, in addition to the carbon that provides the conductive properties.

[[File:Pre-Set Potentiometer.png|thumb|upright=0.5|Electronic symbol for pre-set potentiometer]]

Multiturn potentiometers are also operated by rotating a shaft, but by several turns rather than less than a full turn. Some multiturn potentiometers have a linear resistive element with a sliding contact moved by a lead screw; others have a [[Helix|helical]] resistive element and a wiper that turns through 10, 20, or more complete revolutions, moving along the helix as it rotates. Multiturn potentiometers, both user-accessible and preset, allow finer adjustments; rotation through the same angle changes the setting by typically a tenth as much as for a simple rotary potentiometer.

A [[string potentiometer]] is a multi-turn potentiometer operated by an attached reel of wire turning against a spring, enabling it to convert linear position to a variable resistance.

User-accessible rotary potentiometers can be fitted with a switch which operates usually at the anti-clockwise extreme of rotation. Before digital electronics became the norm such a component was used to allow radio and television receivers and other equipment to be switched on at minimum volume with an audible click, then the volume increased, by turning a knob. Multiple resistance elements can be ganged together with their sliding contacts on the same shaft, for example, in stereo audio amplifiers for volume control. In other applications, such as domestic light [[dimmer]]s, the normal usage pattern is best satisfied if the potentiometer remains set at its current position, so the switch is operated by a push action, alternately on and off, by axial presses of the knob.

Others are enclosed within the equipment and are intended to be adjusted to calibrate equipment during manufacture or repair, and not otherwise touched. They are usually physically much smaller than user-accessible potentiometers, and may need to be operated by a screwdriver rather than having a knob. They are usually called "preset potentiometers" or "trim[ming] pots". Some presets are accessible by a small screwdriver poked through a hole in the case to allow servicing without dismantling.

=== Resistance–position relationship: "taper" ===
[[File:Pots 10k 100k.jpg|thumbnail|upright|Size scaled 10k and 100k pots that combine traditional mountings and knob shafts with newer and smaller electrical assemblies. Note the "B" designating a linear taper.]]

The relationship between slider position and resistance, known as the "taper" or "law", is controlled by the manufacturer. In principle any relationship is possible, but for most purposes [[linear]] or [[logarithm]]ic (aka "audio taper") potentiometers are sufficient.

A letter code may be used to identify which taper is used, but the letter code definitions are not standardized. Potentiometers made in Asia and the USA are usually marked with an "A" for logarithmic taper or a "B" for linear taper; "C" for the rarely seen reverse logarithmic taper. Others, particularly those from Europe, may be marked with an "A" for linear taper, a "C" or "B" for logarithmic taper, or an "F" for reverse logarithmic taper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Resistor Guide|url=http://www.resistorguide.com/potentiometer/|accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The code used also varies between different manufacturers. When a percentage is referenced with a non-linear taper, it relates to the resistance value at the midpoint of the shaft rotation.  A 10% log taper would therefore measure 10% of the total resistance at the midpoint of the rotation; i.e. 10% log taper on a 10&amp;nbsp;kOhm potentiometer would yield 1&amp;nbsp;kOhm at the midpoint. The higher the percentage, the steeper the log curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Elliot|first=Rod|title=Beginners' Guide to Potentiometers|url=http://sound.whsites.net/pots.htm#markings|publisher=Elliott Sound Products|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Linear taper potentiometer ====
A ''linear taper potentiometer'' (''linear'' describes the electrical characteristic of the device, not the geometry of the resistive element) has a resistive element of constant cross-section, resulting in a device where the resistance between the contact (wiper) and one end terminal is [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the distance between them.  Linear taper potentiometers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peterson|first1=Phillip|title=Linear Type Precision Potentiometer Diagram|url=http://www.betatronix.com/uploads/2010%20SERIES.pdf|website=Precision Sensors|publisher=Betatronix|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; are used when the division ratio of the potentiometer must be proportional to the angle of shaft rotation (or slider position), for example, controls used for adjusting the centering of the display on an analog cathode-ray [[oscilloscope]]. Precision potentiometers have an accurate relationship between resistance and slider position.

==== Logarithmic potentiometer ====
A ''logarithmic taper potentiometer'' is a potentiometer that has a bias built into the resistive element. Basically this means the center position of the potentiometer is not one half of the total value of the potentiometer. The resistive element is designed to follow a logarithmic taper, aka a mathematical exponent or "squared" profile. 
A logarithmic taper potentiometer is constructed with a resistive element that either "tapers" in from one end to the other, or is made from a material whose resistivity varies from one end to the other.  This results in a device where output voltage is a logarithmic function of the slider position.

Most (cheaper) "log" potentiometers are not accurately logarithmic, but use two regions of different resistance (but constant resistivity) to approximate a logarithmic law. The two resistive tracks overlap at approximately 50% of the potentiometer rotation; this gives a stepwise logarithmic taper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Potentiometer taper|url=http://www.resistorguide.com/potentiometer-taper/|publisher=the Resistor Guide|accessdate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A logarithmic potentiometer can also be simulated (not very accurately) with a linear one and an external resistor.  True logarithmic potentiometers are significantly more expensive.

Logarithmic taper potentiometers are often used in connection with audio amplifiers, as human perception of audio volume is [[Weber–Fechner law|logarithmic]].

== Rheostat ==
{{see also|Liquid rheostat}}

[[File:Wheatstone Rheostat 1.png|thumb|[[Charles Wheatstone]]'s 1843 rheostat with a metal and a wooden cylinder]]
[[File:Wheatstone Rheostat 2.png|thumb|Charles Wheatstone's 1843 rheostat with a moving whisker]]

The most common way to vary the resistance in a circuit is to use a '''rheostat'''. The word ''rheostat'' was coined about 1845 by Sir [[Charles Wheatstone]], from the Greek {{lang|grc|ῥέος}} ''rheos'' meaning "stream", and -{{lang|grc|στάτης}} -''states'' (from {{lang|grc|ἱστάναι}} ''histanai'', " to set, to cause to stand") meaning "setter, regulating device",&lt;ref&gt;Brian Bowers (ed.), ''Sir Charles Wheatstone FRS: 1802-1875'', IET, 2001 {{ISBN|0-85296-103-0}} pp.104-105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|stat}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|r(e/os|ῥέος}}, {{LSJ|i(/sthmi|ἱστάναι|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which is a two-terminal variable resistor. The term "rheostat" is becoming obsolete,&lt;ref name="From Rheostat to Potentiometer"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dolan|first1=Alexander|title=Potentiometer History and Terminology|url=http://sensor-journal.com/|website=Sensor Journal|publisher=Journal of Sensor History|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the general term "potentiometer" replacing it.  For low-power applications (less than about 1 watt) a three-terminal potentiometer is often used, with one terminal unconnected or connected to the wiper.

Where the rheostat must be rated for higher power (more than about 1 watt), it may be built with a resistance wire wound around a semicircular insulator,  with the wiper sliding from one turn of the wire to the next. Sometimes a rheostat is made from resistance wire wound on a heat-resisting cylinder, with the slider made from a number of metal fingers that grip lightly onto a small portion of the turns of resistance wire. The "fingers" can be moved along the coil of resistance wire by a sliding knob thus changing the "tapping" point.  Wire-wound rheostats made with ratings up to several thousand watts are used in applications such as DC motor drives, electric welding controls, or in the controls for generators. The rating of the rheostat is given with the full resistance value and the allowable power dissipation is proportional to the fraction of the total device resistance in circuit.

== Digital potentiometer ==
{{main article|Digital potentiometer}}
A digital potentiometer (often called digipot) is an electronic component that mimics the functions of analog potentiometers.  Through digital input signals, the resistance between two terminals can be adjusted, just as in an analog potentiometer. There are two main functional types: volatile, which lose their set position if power is removed, and are usually designed to initialise at the minimum position, and non-volatile, which retain their set position using a storage mechanism similar to [[flash memory]] or [[EEPROM]].

Usage of a digipot is far more complex than that of a simple mechanical potentiometer, and there are many limitations to observe; nevertheless they are widely used, often for factory adjustment and calibration of equipment, especially where the limitations of mechanical potentiometers are problematic. A digipot is generally immune to the effects of moderate long-term mechanical vibration or environmental contamination, to the same extent as other semiconductor devices, and can be secured electronically against unauthorised tampering by protecting the access to its programming inputs by various means.

In equipment which has a [[microprocessor]], [[FPGA]] or other functional logic which can store settings and reload them to the "potentiometer" every time the equipment is powered up, a multiplying [[Digital-to-analog converter|DAC]] can be used in place of a digipot, and this can offer higher setting resolution, less drift with temperature, and more operational flexibility.

== Membrane potentiometers ==
A membrane potentiometer uses a conductive membrane that is deformed by a sliding element to contact a resistor voltage divider. Linearity can range from 0.50% to 5% depending on the material, design and manufacturing process. The repeat accuracy is typically between 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm and 1.0&amp;nbsp;mm with a theoretically infinite resolution.  The service life of these types of potentiometers is typically 1 million to 20 million cycles depending on the materials used during manufacturing and the actuation method; contact and contactless (magnetic) methods are available (to sense position). Many different material variations are available such as [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]], FR4, and Kapton. Membrane potentiometer manufacturers offer linear, rotary, and application-specific variations. The linear versions can range from 9&amp;nbsp;mm to 1000&amp;nbsp;mm in length and the rotary versions range from 0° to multiple full turns, with each having a height of 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm. Membrane potentiometers can be used for position sensing.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.designworldonline.com/articles/5903/260/Membrane-Potentiometers-Simplify-Position-Sensing.aspx Membrane Potentiometer White Paper]&lt;/ref&gt;

For touch-screen devices using resistive technology, a two-dimensional membrane potentiometer provides x and y coordinates. The top layer is thin glass spaced close to a neighboring inner layer. The underside of the top layer has a transparent conductive coating; the surface of the layer beneath it has a transparent resistive coating. A finger or stylus deforms the glass to contact the underlying layer. Edges of the resistive layer have conductive contacts.
Locating the contact point is done by applying a voltage to opposite edges, leaving the other two edges temporarily unconnected. The voltage of the top layer provides one coordinate. Disconnecting those two edges, and applying voltage to the other two, formerly unconnected, provides the other coordinate. Alternating rapidly between pairs of edges provides frequent position updates. An analog-to digital converter provides output data.

Advantages of such sensors are that only five connections to the sensor are needed, and the associated electronics is comparatively simple. Another is that any material that depresses the top layer over a small area works well. A disadvantage is that sufficient force must be applied to make contact. Another is that the sensor requires occasional calibration to match touch location to the underlying display. (Capacitive sensors require no calibration or contact force, only proximity of a finger or other conductive object. However, they are significantly more complex.)

== Applications ==
Potentiometers are rarely used to directly control significant amounts of power (more than a watt or so). Instead they are used to adjust the level of analog signals (for example [[loudness|volume]] controls on [[audio equipment]]), and as control inputs for electronic circuits. For example, a light [[dimmer]] uses a potentiometer to control the switching of a [[TRIAC]] and so indirectly to control the brightness of lamps.

Preset potentiometers are widely used throughout electronics wherever adjustments must be made during manufacturing or servicing.

User-actuated potentiometers are widely used as user controls, and may control a very wide variety of equipment functions. The widespread use of potentiometers in consumer electronics declined in the 1990s, with [[rotary encoder]]s, up/down [[push-button]]s, and other digital controls now more common. However they remain in many applications, such as volume controls and as position sensors.

=== Audio control ===
[[File:Faders.jpg|thumb|right|Linear potentiometers ([[Fade (audio engineering)#Fader|faders]])]]

Low-power potentiometers, both linear and rotary, are used to control audio equipment, changing loudness, frequency attenuation, and other characteristics of audio signals.

The 'log pot' is used as the volume control in [[audio power amplifier]]s, where it is also called an "audio taper pot", because the [[amplitude]] response of the human [[ear]] is approximately logarithmic. It ensures that on a volume control marked 0 to 10, for example, a setting of 5 sounds subjectively half as loud as a setting of 10. There is also an ''anti-log pot'' or ''reverse audio taper'' which is simply the reverse of a logarithmic potentiometer. It is almost always used in a ganged configuration with a logarithmic potentiometer, for instance, in an audio balance control.

Potentiometers used in combination with filter networks act as [[Tone control circuit|tone controls]] or [[Equalization (audio)|equalizers]].

=== Television ===
Potentiometers were formerly used to control picture brightness, contrast, and color response.  A potentiometer was often used to adjust "vertical hold", which affected the synchronization between the receiver's internal sweep circuit (sometimes a [[multivibrator]]) and the received picture signal, along with other things such as audio-video carrier offset, tuning frequency (for push-button sets) and so on.

=== Motion control ===
Potentiometers can be used as position feedback devices in order to create "closed loop" control, such as in a [[servomechanism]]. This method of motion control used in the DC Motor is the simplest method of measuring the angle, speed and displacement.

=== Transducers ===
Potentiometers  are also very widely used as a part of [[displacement (vector)|displacement]] [[transducer]]s because of the simplicity of construction and because they can give a large output signal.

===Computation===
In [[analog computer]]s, high precision potentiometers are used to scale intermediate results by desired constant factors, or to set [[initial condition]]s for a calculation. A motor-driven potentiometer may be used as a [[function generator]], using a non-linear resistance card to supply approximations to trigonometric functions. For example, the shaft rotation might represent an angle, and the voltage division ratio can be made proportional to the cosine of the angle.

== Theory of operation ==
[[File:Potentiometer with load.svg|left|framed|A potentiometer with a resistive load, showing equivalent fixed resistors for clarity.]]

The potentiometer can be used as a [[voltage divider]] to obtain a manually adjustable output voltage at the slider (wiper) from a fixed input voltage applied across the two ends of the potentiometer. This is their most common use.

The voltage across {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be calculated by:
:&lt;math&gt;
V_\mathrm{L} = { R_2 R_\mathrm{L} \over R_1 R_\mathrm{L} + R_2 R_\mathrm{L} + R_1 R_2}\cdot V_s.
&lt;/math&gt;

If {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;}} is large compared to the other resistances (like the input to an [[operational amplifier]]), the output voltage can be approximated by the simpler equation:
:&lt;math&gt;
V_\mathrm{L} = { R_2 \over R_1 + R_2 }\cdot V_s.
&lt;/math&gt;
(dividing throughout by {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;}} and cancelling terms with {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;}} as denominator)

As an example, assume
:&lt;math&gt;
V_\mathrm{S} = 10\ \mathrm{V}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_1 = 1\ \mathrm{k \Omega}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_2 = 2\ \mathrm{k \Omega}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{L} = 100\ \mathrm{k \Omega}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Since the load resistance is large compared to the other resistances, the output voltage {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;}} will be approximately:
:&lt;math&gt;
{2\ \mathrm{k \Omega} \over 1\ \mathrm{k \Omega} + 2\ \mathrm{k \Omega} } \cdot 10\ \mathrm{V} = {2 \over 3} \cdot 10\ \mathrm{V} \approx 6.667\ \mathrm{V}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Due to the load resistance, however, it will actually be slightly lower: {{math|≈ 6.623 ''V''}}.

One of the advantages of the potential divider compared to a variable resistor in series with the source is that, while variable resistors have a maximum resistance where some [[current (electricity)|current]] will always flow, dividers are able to vary the output voltage from maximum ({{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;}}) to [[ground (electricity)|ground]] (zero volts) as the wiper moves from one end of the potentiometer to the other. There is, however, always a small amount of [[contact resistance]].

In addition, the load resistance is often not known and therefore simply placing a variable resistor in series with the load could have a negligible effect or an excessive effect, depending on the load.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12159">A '''radial turbine''' is a [[turbine]] in which the flow of the [[working fluid]] is radial to the shaft. The difference between [[axial turbine|axial]] and radial turbines consists in the way the fluid flows through the components (compressor and turbine). Whereas for an axial turbine the rotor is 'impacted' by the fluid flow, for a radial turbine, the flow is smoothly orientated perpendicular to the rotation axis, and it drives the turbine in the same way water drives a [[watermill]]. The result is less mechanical stress (and less thermal stress, in case of hot working fluids) which enables a radial turbine to be simpler, more robust, and more efficient (in a similar power range) when compared to axial turbines. When it comes to high power ranges (above 5 [[Megawatt|MW]]) the radial turbine is no longer competitive (due to heavy and expensive rotor) and the efficiency becomes similar to that of the axial turbines.

[[File:Radial turbine.jpg|thumb|right|Radial turbine]]

== Advantages and challenges==
Compared to an [[axial flow turbine]], a radial turbine can employ a relatively higher pressure ratio (≈4) per stage with lower flow rates. Thus these machines fall in the lower specific speed and power ranges. For high temperature applications rotor blade cooling in radial stages is not as easy as in axial turbine stages. Variable angle nozzle blades can give higher stage efficiencies in a radial turbine stage even at off-design point operation. In the family of hydro-turbines, Francis turbine is a very well-known IFR turbine which generates much larger power with a relatively large impeller.

==Components of radial turbines==

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The radial and tangential components of the absolute velocity c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are c&lt;sub&gt;r2&lt;/sub&gt; and c&lt;sub&gt;q2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. The relative velocity of the flow and the peripheral speed of the rotor are w&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and u&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; respectively. The air angle at the rotor blade entry is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\,\tan{\beta_2} =\frac{c_{r2}}{(c_{\theta 2}- u_2)}&lt;/math&gt;

==Enthalpy and Entropy diagram==
The stagnation state of the gas at the nozzle entry is represented by point 01. The gas expands adiabatically in the nozzles from a pressure '''p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' to '''p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' with an increase in its velocity from '''c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' to '''c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''. Since this is an energy transformation process, the stagnation enthalpy remains constant but the stagnation pressure decreases (p&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; p&lt;sub&gt;02&lt;/sub&gt;) due to losses.
The energy transfer accompanied by an energy transformation process occurs in the rotor.

==Spouting Velocity==
A reference velocity (c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) known as the isentropic velocity, spouting velocity or stage terminal velocity is defined as that velocity which will be obtained during an isentropic expansion of the gas between the entry and exit pressures of the stage.

:&lt;math&gt;\,C_0 = \sqrt{2C_p\,T_{01}\,(1 - (\frac{p_3}{p_{01}})^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}})}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Steam turbine|total-to-static efficiency]] is based on this value of work.

:&lt;math&gt;\,\eta_ts\, =\,\frac{(h_{01} - h_{03})}{(h_{01} - h_{3ss})}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\, \eta_ts\, = \, \frac{\psi\,u_2^2}{[C_p\,T_{01}(1-(\frac{p_3}{p_{01}})^{\frac{(\gamma - 1)}{\gamma}}]}&lt;/math&gt;

==Degree of Reaction==
The relative pressure or enthalpy drop in the nozzle and rotor blades are determined by the [[degree of reaction]] of the stage. This is defined by

'''&lt;big&gt;R&lt;/big&gt;'''=&lt;math&gt; \frac {\textrm''{static \,\, enthaply \,\, drop\,\, in \,\, rotor}''}{\textrm''{stagnation \,\, enthalpy \,\, drop \,\,in \,\,stage}''}&lt;/math&gt;

The two quantities within the parentheses in the numerator may have the same or opposite signs. This, besides other factors, would also govern the value of reaction. The stage reaction decreases as C&lt;sub&gt;θ2&lt;/sub&gt; increases because this results in a large proportion of the stage enthalpy drop to occur in the nozzle ring.

==Stage losses==
The stage work is less than the isentropic stage enthalpy drop on account of aerodynamic losses in the stage. The actual output at the turbine shaft is equal to the stage work minus the losses due to rotor disc and bearing friction.

*''&lt;u&gt;(a) [[Skin friction#Skin friction|skin friction and separation losses in the scroll and nozzle ring]]&lt;/u&gt;''
*:They depend on the geometry and the coefficient of skin friction of these components.
*''&lt;u&gt;(b) Skin friction and separation losses in the rotor blade channels&lt;/u&gt;''
*:These losses are also governed by the channel geometry, coefficient of skin friction and the ratio of the relative velocities w&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/w&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In the ninety degree IFR turbine stage, the losses occurring in the radial and axial sections of the rotor are sometimes separately considered.
*''&lt;u&gt;(c) Skin friction and separation losses in the [[Turbine|diffuser]]&lt;/u&gt;''
*:These are mainly governed by the geometry of the diffuser and the rate of diffusion.
*''&lt;u&gt;(d) Secondary losses&lt;/u&gt;''
*:These are due to circulatory flows developing into the various flow passages and are principally governed by the aerodynamic loading of the blades. The main parameters governing these losses are b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/d&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, d&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/d&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and hub-tip ratio at the rotor exit.
*''&lt;u&gt;(e) Shock or incidence losses&lt;/u&gt;''
*:At off-design operation, there are additional losses in the nozzle and rotor blade rings on account of incidence at the leading edges of the blades. This loss is conventionally referred to as shock loss though it has nothing to do with the shock waves.
*''&lt;u&gt;(f) Tip clearance loss&lt;/u&gt;''
*:This is due to the flow over the rotor blade tips which does not contribute to the energy transfer.

==Blade to Gas Speed Ratio==
The blade-to-gas speed ratio can be expressed in terms of the isentropic stage terminal velocity c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\,\sigma_s = \frac{u_2}{c_0} = [2 ( 1 + \phi_2 \cot{\beta_2}]^{- 1 \over{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;for β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;
σ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;=0.707

[[File:Variation of stage efficiency of an IFR turbine with blade-to-isentropic gas speed ratio.jpg|thumb|360px|center|&lt;center&gt;'''Variation of stage efficiency of an IFR turbine with blade-to-isentropic gas speed ratio'''&lt;/center&gt;]]

==Outward-flow radial stages==
In outward flow radial turbine stages, the flow of the gas or steam occurs from smaller to larger diameters. The stage consists of a pair of fixed and moving blades. The increasing area of cross-section at larger diameters accommodates the expanding gas.

This configuration did not become popular with the steam and gas turbines. The only one which is employed more commonly is the [[Fredrik Ljungstrom|Ljungstrom double rotation type turbine]]. It consists of rings of cantilever blades projecting from two discs rotating in opposite directions. The relative peripheral velocity of blades in two adjacent rows, with respect to each other, is high. This gives a higher value of enthalpy drop per stage.

== Nikola Tesla's Bladeless Radial Turbine ==
{{main|Tesla turbine}}

In the early 1900s, [[Nikola Tesla]] developed and patented his bladeless [[Tesla turbine]]. One of the difficulties with bladed turbines is the complex and highly precise requirements for balancing and manufacturing the bladed rotor which has to be very well balanced. The blades are subject to [[corrosion]] and [[cavitation]]. Tesla attacked this problem by substituting a series of closely spaced disks for the blades of the rotor. The working fluid flows between the disks and transfers its energy to the rotor by means of the boundary layer effect or adhesion and viscosity rather than by impulse or reaction. Tesla stated his turbine could realize incredibly high efficiencies by steam. There has been no documented evidence of Tesla turbines achieving the efficiencies Tesla claimed. They have been found to have low overall efficiencies in the roll of a turbine or pump.&lt;ref&gt;[http://greenif.com/3020102.pdf Author, Harikishan Gupta E., &amp; Author, Shyam P. Kodali (2013). Design and Operation of Tesla Turbo machine - A state of the art review. International Journal of Advanced Transport Phenomena, 2(1), 2-3.]&lt;/ref&gt; In recent decades there has been further research into bladeless turbine and development of patented designs that work with corrosive/abrasive and hard to pump material such as ethylene glycol, fly ash, blood, rocks, and even live  fish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://greenif.com/3020102.pdf Author, Harikishan Gupta E., &amp; Author, Shyam P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="978">A '''recycling cooperative''' is an industrial [[cooperative]], co-owned and maintained by either workers or consumers, which specializes in the [[recycling]] of various materials. Such cooperatives are either [[non-profit]] or [[not-for-profit]]; a major theoretical benefit of mass co-ownership is that raw recycled materials can become increasingly and equally distributed among the membership population at a low cost, be it for reusage at home or for reusage in the manufacturing of newer goods or versions of goods to be sold to customers at cheaper prices than would be possible with freshly obtained raw materials. A subset is the '''business recycling cooperative''', which, according to the [[Northeast Recycling Council]], is a group of business in a particular region, which separate recyclable waste, usually produced by their own functions, for prearranged collection by a shared hauler.

'''Samuel Wallis''' (23 April 1728 &amp;ndash; 21 January 1795 in [[London]]) was a British naval officer and explorer of the [[Pacific Ocean]].

Wallis was born at Fenteroon Farm, near [[Camelford]], [[Cornwall]]. He served under [[John Byron]], and in 1766 was promoted to captain and was given the command of {{HMS|Dolphin|1751}} as part of an expedition led by [[Philip Carteret]] in the {{HMS|Swallow|1766|2}} with an assignment to circumnavigate the globe.&lt;ref name=Quanchi&gt;Quanchi, ''Historical Dictionary of the Discovery and Exploration of the Pacific Islands'', page 248&lt;/ref&gt; The two ships were parted by a storm shortly after sailing through the [[Strait of Magellan]], Wallis continuing to [[Tahiti]], which he named "King George the Third's Island" in honour of the King (June 1767). Wallis himself was ill and remained in his cabin: lieutenant [[Tobias Furneaux]] was the first to set foot, hoisting a pennant and turning a turf, taking possession in the name of His Majesty. 

''Dolphin'' stayed in [[Matavai Bay]] in Tahiti for over a month.&lt;ref name= Quanchi/&gt; Wallis went on to name or rename five more islands in the [[Society Islands]] and six atolls in the [[Tuamotu Islands]], as well as confirming the locations of [[Rongerik]] and [[Rongelap]] in the [[Marshall Islands]]. He renamed the [[Polynesia]]n island of Uvea as [[Wallis (island)|Wallis]] after himself, before reaching [[Tinian]] in the [[Mariana Islands]].&lt;ref name= Quanchi/&gt; He continued to [[Jakarta|Batavia]], where many of the crew died from [[dysentery]], then via the [[Cape of Good Hope]] to England, arriving in May 1768. 

He was able to pass on useful information to [[James Cook]] who was due to depart shortly for the [[Pacific]], and some of the crew from the ''Dolphin'' sailed with Cook.

In 1780 Wallis was appointed Commissioner of the [[Admiralty]].

== Location ==
The Private Reserve of Natural Heritage (RPPN) of University of Santa Cruz do Sul is located in [[municipality]] of [[Sinimbu]] in [[Rio Grande do Sul]] state, [[Brazil]], distant about 48&amp;nbsp;km north of municipality of [[Santa Cruz do Sul]]. Unfortunately it is the '''only''' RPPN present in the [[Highland (landform)|highlands]] [[Escarpment|scarp]] region in this state,&lt;ref name="multipla"&gt;Sühs, R.B.; Putzke, J. &amp; Budke, J.C. 2010.

Biotemas 23 (3): 93-103.&lt;/ref&gt; although the creation of Preservation Areas in this region in order to protect the last [[primary forest]] fragments of this region had been suggested years ago.&lt;ref&gt;FONTANA, C.S., BENCKE, G.A. &amp; REIS, R.E. 2003. Livro vermelho da fauna ameaçada de extinção do Rio Grande do Sul. EDIPUCRS, Porto Alegre, 632 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Created in 2009 and having an area of 221.39 hectares, the Reserve is within an [[ecotone]] between the [[seasonal]] [[deciduous forest]] and the [[Araucaria moist forest]]. Altitude vary from 150 m eastwards, at the [[Pardinho river]]'s [[Stream bed|riverbed]] and 650 m at hilltops.&lt;ref name="multipla" /&gt; The reserve is within the [[Atlantic Forest]] [[Biome]], having a [[seasonal]] [[deciduous forest]] predominantly [[Secondary forest|secondary]] once the former residents used a good part of the local's natural resources by removing vegetation and livestock practice.&lt;ref name="multipla" /&gt; Less impacted areas were left on hillsides due to its topographic conditions.&lt;ref name="multipla" /&gt;&lt;ref name="multipla2"&gt;Abreu Jr, E.F. &amp; Köhler, A. 2009. Mastofauna de médio e grande porte na RPPN da UNISC, RS, Brasil. Biota Neotropica 9(4): 169-174.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Despite being created only in 2009, research activities began in 2006&lt;ref name="multipla" /&gt; resulting quali-quantitative publications about the local and regional fauna and flora:

'''- Mammalian fauna of medium and large size'''.&lt;ref name="multipla2" /&gt;

'''- Avifauna'''&lt;ref name="multipla3" /&gt;

'''- [[Trees]] '''&lt;ref name="multipla" /&gt;&lt;ref name="acta"&gt;Sühs &amp; Budke (2011). Spatial distribution, association patterns and richness of tree species in a seasonal forest from the Serra Geral formation, southern Brazil. Acta Botanica Brasilica 25(3) 605-617.

== Flora ==
Until 2010, 149 [[native species]] and 11 [[exotic species]] of trees were found in the area and surroundings, where, among the exotic species, five are considered [[invasive species]] and need urgent control measures.&lt;ref name="multipla" /&gt; The arboreal vegetation is characterized by presenting species from the [[seasonal]] [[deciduous forest]] and from the [[Araucaria moist forest]].&lt;ref name="multipla" /&gt; The reserve is home for 12 [[endangered species]] according to the lists of Threatened Species of Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazilian Endangered Species and [[IUCN]] [[Red List]]: ''[[Araucaria angustifolia]]'' (Bertol.) Kuntze, ''[[Gochnatia polymorpha]]'' (Less.) Cabrera, ''[[Maytenus aquifolia]]'' Mart., ''[[Dicksonia sellowiana]]'' Hook, ''[[Albizia edwallii]]'' (Hoehne) Barneby &amp; J.Grimes, ''[[Myrocarpus frondosus]]'' Allemão, ''[[Cedrela fissilis]]'' Vell., ''[[Myrcianthes pungens]]'' (O.Berg) D.Legrand, ''[[Podocarpus lambertii]]'' Klotzsch ex Endl., ''[[Rudgea parquioides]]''(Cham.) Müll.Arg., ''[[Picramnia parvifolia]]'' Engl. and ''[[Picrasma crenata]]'' (Vell.) Engl.&lt;ref name="multipla" /&gt;
In a survey located in a one-hectare plot in a slope in the area, 1,063 individuals belonging to 69 species were found.&lt;ref name="acta" /&gt;

[[File:Vista área rppnunisc.jpg|thumb|Lateral view of the preservation area.]]

== Fauna ==

=== Mammals ===
Until the year 2009, 16 species of wild mammals were registered in the area, which eight are [[endangered]]: ''[[Alouatta guariba clamitans]]'', ''[[Cebus nigritus]]'',  ''[[Eira barbara]]'', ''[[Nasua nasua]]'', ''[[Leopardus wiedii]]'' ''[[Chironectes minimus]]'', ''[[Lontra longicaudis]]'' and ''[[Cuniculus paca]]''.&lt;ref name="multipla2" /&gt; Domestic animals were also found in the area and control suggestions were proposed in order to ensure the survival and  a sobrevivência and viability of local wildlife populations
.&lt;ref name="multipla2" /&gt;

=== Avifauna ===
Were found 169 birds species, being most part forest species and 44 are [[Endemism|endemic]] of [[Atlantic Forest]].&lt;ref name="multipla3" /&gt; Five species are in extinction risk for the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil: ''[[Odontophorus capueira]]'', ''[[Patagioenas cayennensis]]'', ''[[Triclaria malachitacea]]'', ''[[Grallaria varia]]''  and ''[[Amazona pretrei]]'' (the latter is globally threatened), among other rare or "[[near threatened]]" species, as well as species typically found in [[deciduous forest|seasonal forest]]s and in higher parts of the highlands showing that the area is an [[ecotone]] between the seasonal deciduous forest and the Araucaria moist forest.&lt;ref name="multipla3" /&gt;

== Uranium processing plant ==

The plant is located near [[Gore, Oklahoma]], close to the [[Illinois River (Oklahoma)|Illinois River]] and [[Interstate 40]]. The plant started construction in 1968 and began operation in 1970. It converted [[yellowcake uranium]] into [[uranium hexafluoride]]. In 1987 it started converting [[depleted uranium]] [[uranium hexafluoride|hexafluoride]] into depleted [[uranium tetrafluoride]]. The plant ceased operation in 1993.&lt;ref name="SeeKerrMcGee"&gt;See [[Kerr-McGee]] article for citations&lt;/ref&gt;

The plant was operated under [[Kerr-McGee Nuclear Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;Although exact date of KMNC formation is unknown to author, it was at least the early 1970s, and before that would have been simply KMC.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 KMNC split into [[Quivira Mining Corporation]] and Sequoyah Fuels Corporation. The latter was given control of the plant. In 1988 Sequoyah Fuels Corporation was sold to [[General Atomics]].&lt;ref name="SeeKerrMcGee" /&gt;

In 2008 a company named [[International Isotopes]] said it would buy equipment and intellectual property from the Sequoyah Fuels Corp plant. The equipment would be used in a new location. It would be used for converting [[depleted uranium]] hexafluoride to depleted [[uranium tetrafluoride]].&lt;ref name="yurman"/&gt;

== The 1986 Sequoyah Corporation Fuels Release in Oklahoma ==
[[File:UF6 cylinder rupture bw.png|thumb|Photograph of the rupture in the uranium hexafluoride container]]
On January 4, 1986, Sequoyah Fuels Corporation experienced a rupture in an overfilled UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; cylinder that contained an estimated 29 500 pounds of gaseous UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. The incident led to the death of a 26-year-old worker, James Harrison, of African American and Cherokee heritage, and the hospitalization of 37 of the 42 onsite workers. Health care providers examined up to 100 people, many from the community, for health effects, and 21 were hospitalized for short periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Brugge|first = Doug|last2 = deLemos|first2 = Jamie L.|last3 = Bui|first3 = Cat|title = The Sequoyah Corporation Fuels Release and the Church Rock Spill: Unpublicized Nuclear Releases in American Indian Communities|url = http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2006.103044|journal = American Journal of Public Health|volume = 97|issue = 9|pages = 1595–1600|doi = 10.2105/ajph.2006.103044|pmid=17666688|pmc=1963288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, [[Kerr McGee]] sold the facility to [[General Atomics]]. The ''[[American Journal of Public Health]]'' describes the plant as having "never fully recovered" from the accident.&lt;ref name=Brugge&gt;Doug Brugge, et al, "The Sequoyah Corporation Fuels Release and the Church Rock Spill", ''American Journal of Public Health'', September 2007, Vol, 97, No. 9, pp. 1596–1597.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another accident involving the release of UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; occurred in 1992. The plant ceased production operations in 1993 and was decommissioned.&lt;ref name=Brugge /&gt;

==Types==

===Plate-type steam methane reformers===

===Multi-tube steam reformer===

===Membrane reactor===
A membrane reactor is a device where oxygen separation, steam reforming and POX is combined in a single step. In 1997 Argonne National Laboratory and  Amoco published a paper "Ceramic membrane reactor for converting methane to syngas"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233819595_Ceramic_membrane_reactor_for_converting_methane_to_syngas Ceramic membrane reactor for converting methane to syngas]&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in different small scale systems that combined an ATR based oxygen membrane with a water-gas shift reactor and a hydrogen membrane.

===POX reactor===
[[Partial oxidation]] (POX) is a type of [[chemical reaction]]. It occurs when a [[stoichiometry|substoichiometric]] fuel-air mixture is partially [[combustion|combusted]] in a reformer, creating a hydrogen-rich [[syngas]] which can then be put to further use, for example in a [[fuel cell]]. A distinction is made between ''thermal partial oxidation'' (TPOX) and ''catalytic partial oxidation'' (CPOX).

===Steam methane reformers with catalyst beds===

*Microchannel Reformer&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energy.ca.gov/pier/portfolio/Content/06/EISG/Low%20Cost%20Microchannel%20Reformer.htm Low cost microchannel reformer for hydrogen production from natural gas ]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ion transport membrane reforming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/rgd/www/Papers/James2012ITM.pdf Numerical simulation of ion transport membrane reactors: oxygen permeation and transport and fuel conversion]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Centralized hydrogen production==
The [[capital cost]] of [[methane reformer]] plants is prohibitive for small to medium size applications because the technology does not scale down well. Conventional steam reforming plants operate at pressures between 200 and 600 psi with outlet temperatures in the range of 815 to 925 °C. However, analyses have shown that even though it is more costly to construct, a well-designed SMR can produce hydrogen more cost-effectively than an ATR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblymag.com/CDA/Archives/edabe122ce5c9010VgnVCM100000f932a8c0____ AIA: Software Analyzes Cost of Hydrogen Production - Archives - ASSEMBLY&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; To lower the costs both pressure and used temperature are lowered which allows for the use of cheaper materials.

[[File:South-pointing chariot (Science Museum model).jpg|thumb|Exhibit in the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] in London, England. This conjectural model chariot incorporates a [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] gear.]]
{{Chinese|pic=|picsize=|piccap=|t=指南車|s=指南车|p=zhǐ nán chē|j=zi2 naam4 gui1|y=jí nàahm guī}}

The '''south-pointing chariot''' (or '''carriage''') was an ancient Chinese two-wheeled vehicle that carried a movable pointer to indicate the [[south]], no matter how the chariot turned. Usually, the pointer took the form of a [[doll]] or figure with an outstretched arm. The chariot was supposedly used as a [[compass]] for [[navigation]] and may also have had other purposes.

The ancient Chinese invented a mobile-like armored cart used in from the 5th century BC called the [[Dongwu Che]] ({{zh|c=洞屋车}}). It was used for the purpose of protecting warriors on the battlefield. The Chinese war wagon was designed as a kind of mobile protective cart with a shed-like roof. It would serve to be rolled up to city fortifications to provide protection for [[sappers]] digging underneath to weaken a wall's foundation. The early Chinese war wagon became the basis of technologies for the making of ancient Chinese south-pointing chariots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Fighting Techniques of the Oriental World 1200-1860 |last=Haskew |first= Michael E |last2=Jorgensen |first2= Christer |last3=McNab |first3= Chris |last4=Niderost |first4= Eric |publisher=Metro Books |year=2008 |isbn= 978-1905704965 |page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A History of Chinese Science and Technology |last=Lu |first=	Yongxiang |publisher=Springer |year=2014 |isbn=978-3662441626 |volume=3 |publication-date=October 20, 2014 |page=516 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are legends of earlier south-pointing chariots, but the first reliably documented one was created by the Chinese mechanical engineer [[Ma Jun]] (c. 200&amp;ndash;265 CE) of [[Cao Wei]] during the [[Three Kingdoms]]. No ancient chariots still exist, but many extant ancient Chinese texts mention them, saying they were used intermittently until about 1300 CE. Some include information about their inner components and workings.

There were probably several types of south-pointing chariot which worked differently. In most or all of them, the rotating road wheels mechanically operated a [[gear]]ed mechanism to keep the pointer aimed correctly. The mechanism had no magnets and did not automatically detect which direction was south. The pointer was aimed southward by hand at the start of a journey. Subsequently, whenever the chariot turned, the mechanism rotated the pointer relative to the body of the chariot to counteract the turn and keep the pointer aiming in a constant direction, to the south. Thus the mechanism did a kind of directional [[dead reckoning]], which is inherently prone to cumulative errors and uncertainties. Some chariots' mechanisms may have had [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] gears. If so, it was probably the first use of differentials anywhere in the world.

==Historical texts==

===Earliest sources===
[[File:指南車圖 (三才圖會).jpg|thumb|upright|An image of a south-pointing chariot from ''[[Sancai Tuhui]]'' (first published 1609)]]

The south-pointing chariot, a mechanical-geared, wheeled vehicle used to discern the southern cardinal direction (without magnetics), was given a brief description by Ma's contemporary [[Fu Xuan]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 40"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary 3rd century CE source of the ''[[Weilüe]]'', written by the East Han Dynasty politician [[Yuan Huan]] also described the south-pointing chariot of belonging to the Chinese mechanical engineer and politician [[Ma Jun]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 288" /&gt; The [[Jin Dynasty (265&amp;ndash;420)|Jin Dynasty]] (265&amp;ndash;420 CE) era text of the ''Shu Zheng Ji'' (Records of Military Expeditions), written by Guo Yuansheng, recorded that south-pointing chariots were often stored in the northern [[gatehouse]] of the Government Workshops (Shang Fang) of the capital city.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 288" /&gt; However, the later written ''[[Book of Song|Song Shu]]'' (''Book of Song'') (6th century CE) recorded the south-pointing chariot's design and use in further detail, as well as creating the background legend of the device's (supposed) use long before Ma's time, in the [[Western Zhou Dynasty]] (1050&amp;ndash;771 BCE). The book also provided a description of the south-pointing chariot's re-invention and use in times after Ma Jun and the Three Kingdoms. The 6th century CE text, translated by the British scientist and historian [[Joseph Needham]], reads as follows (the south-pointing chariot is referred to as the south-pointing carriage):

{{cquote|The south-pointing carriage was first constructed by the Duke of Zhou (beginning of the 1st millennium [[Before Common Era|BC]]) as a means of conducting homewards certain envoys who had arrived from a great distance beyond the frontiers. The country to be traversed was a boundless plain, in which people lost their bearings as to east and west, so (the Duke) caused this vehicle to be made in order that the ambassadors should be able to distinguish north and south. The ''Gui Gu Zi'' book says that the people of the [[Zheng (state)|State of Zheng]], when collecting jade, always carried with them a 'south-pointer', and by means of this were never in doubt (as to their position). During the [[Qin Dynasty|Qin]] and [[Han Dynasty|Former Han]] dynasties, however, nothing more was heard of the vehicle. In the [[Han Dynasty|Later Han]] period, [[Zhang Heng]] re-invented it, but owing to the confusion and turmoil at the close of the dynasty it was not preserved.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 286"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 286.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{cquote|In the State of Wei, (in the [[Three Kingdoms|San Guo]] period) Gaotong Long and Qin Lang were both famous scholars; they disputed about the south-pointing carriage before the court, saying that there was no such thing, and that the story was nonsense. But during the Qing-long reign period (233&amp;ndash;237 AD) the emperor Ming Di commissioned the scholar Ma Jun to construct one, and he duly succeeded. This again was lost during the troubles attending the establishment of the [[Jin Dynasty (265&amp;ndash;420)|Jin Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 286 287"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 286&amp;ndash;287.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{cquote|Later on, [[Shi Hu]] (emperor of the [[Jie (ethnic group)|Jie]] [[Later Zhao]] Dynasty) had one made by Xie Fei, and again Linghu Sheng made one for Yao Xing (emperor of the [[Later Qin]] dynasty). The latter was obtained by emperor An Di of the Jin in the 13th year of the Yi-xi reign-period (417 AD), and it finally came into the hands of emperor [[Emperor Wu of Liu Song|Wu Di]] of the [[Liu Song Dynasty]] when he took over the administration of [[Chang'an]]. Its appearance and construction was like that of a drum-carriage ([[odometer]]). A wooden figure of a man was placed at the top, with its arm raised and pointing to the south, (and the mechanism was arranged in such a way that) although the carriage turned round and round, the pointer-arm still indicated the south. In State processions, the south-pointing carriage led the way, accompanied by the imperial guard.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 287"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 287.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{cquote|These vehicles, constructed as they had been by barbarian ([[Qiang people|Qiang]]) workmen, did not function particularly well. Though called south-pointing carriages, they very often did not point true, and had to negotiate curves step by step, with the help of someone inside to adjust the machinery. The ingenious man from [[Fanyang]], Zi [[Zu Chongzhi]] frequently said, therefore, that a new (and properly automatic) south-pointing carriage ought to be constructed. So towards the close of the Sheng-Ming reign period (477&amp;ndash;479 AD) the emperor [[Emperor Shun of Liu Song|Shun Di]], during the premiership of the Prince of Qi, commissioned (Zi Zu Chongzhi) to make one, and when it was completed it was tested by Wang Seng-qian, military governor of Tanyang, and Liu Hsiu, president of the Board of Censors. The workmanship was excellent, and although the carriage was twisted and turned in a hundred directions, the hand never failed to point to the south. Under the Jin, moreover, there had also been a south-pointing ship.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 287"/&gt;}}

The last sentence of the passage is of great interest for navigation at sea, since the magnetic [[compass]] used for seafaring navigation was not used until the time of [[Shen Kuo]] (1031&amp;ndash;1095). Although the ''Song Shu'' text describes earlier precedents of the south-pointing chariot before the time of Ma Jun, this is not entirely credible, as there are no pre-Han or Han Dynasty era texts that describe the device.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 287 288"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 287&amp;ndash;288.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the first known source to describe stories of its legendary use during the Zhou period was the ''Gu Jin Zhu'' book of [[Cui Bao]] (c. 300 CE), written soon after the Three Kingdoms era.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 288"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 288&lt;/ref&gt; Cui Bao also wrote that the intricate details of construction for the device were once written in the ''Shang Fang Gu Shi'' (''Traditions of the Imperial Workshops''), but the book was lost by his time.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 288"/&gt;

[[File:The Chinese-children instruction vehicle of Expo 2005 Aichi Japan.jpg|Children's instructive toy chariot in Chinese display at [[Expo 2005]] in Japan|thumb]]

===Japan===
The invention of the south-pointing chariot also made its way to [[Japan]] by the 7th century. The ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' (The Chronicles of Japan) of 720 CE described the earlier Chinese [[Buddhist]] [[monk]]s [[Zhi Yu]] and [[Zhi You]] constructing several south-pointing Chariots for [[Emperor Tenji]] of Japan in 658 CE.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 289"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 289.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed up by several more chariot devices built in 666 CE as well.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 289"/&gt;

===''Song Shi''===

The south-pointing chariot was also combined with the earlier Han Dynasty era invention of the [[odometer]] (also [[Greco-Roman]]), a mechanical device used to measure distance traveled, and found in all modern [[automobile]]s. It was mentioned in the [[Song Dynasty]] (960&amp;ndash;1279 CE) historical text of the ''Song Shi'' (compiled in 1345) that the engineers [[Yan Su]] (in 1027 CE) and [[Wu Deren]] (in 1107 CE) both created south-pointing chariots, which it details as follows.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 291"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 291.&lt;/ref&gt; (In Needham's translation, inches and feet (ft) are used as units of distance. 1 inch is 25.4 millimetres. 1&amp;nbsp;ft is 12 inches or 304.8&amp;nbsp;mm.)

{{cquote|In the 5th year of the Tian-Sheng reign period of the [[Emperor Renzong of Song|emperor Renzong]] (1027 AD), Yan Su, a Divisional Director in the Ministry of Works, made a south-pointing carriage. He memorialised the throne, saying, [after the usual historical introduction]: 'Throughout the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms|Five Dynasties]] and until the reigning dynasty there has been, so far as I know, no one who has been able to construct such a vehicle. But now I have invented a design myself and have succeeded in completing it'.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 291"/&gt;}}

{{cquote|'The method involves using a carriage with a single pole (for two horses). Above the outside framework of the body of the carriage let there be a cover in two stories. Set a wooden image of a ''xian'' (immortal) at the top, stretching out its arm to indicate the south. Use 9 wheels, great and small, with a total of 120 teeth, i.e. 2 foot-wheels (i.e. road-wheels, on which the carriage runs) 6 ft. high and 18 ft. in circumference, attached to the foot wheels, 2 vertical subordinate wheels, 2.4 ft. in diameter and 7.2 ft. in circumference, each with 24 teeth, the teeth being at intervals of 3 inches apart.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 291"/&gt;}}

{{cquote|'...Then below the crossbar at the end of the pole, two small vertical wheels 3 inches in diameter and pierced by an iron axle, to the left 1 small horizontal wheel, 1.2 feet in diameter, with 12 teeth, to the right 1 small horizontal wheel, 1.2 ft. in diameter, with 12 teeth, in the middle 1 large horizontal wheel, of diameter 4.8 ft. and circumference 14.4 ft., with 48 teeth, the teeth at intervals of 3 inches apart; in the middle a vertical shaft piercing the center (of the large horizontal wheel) 8 ft. high and 3 inches in diameter; at the top carrying the wooden figure of the ''xian'''.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 291"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

{{cquote|'When the carriage moves (southward) let the wooden figure point south. When it runs (and goes) eastwards, the (back end of the) pole is pushed to the right; the subordinate wheel attached to the right road-wheel will turn forward 12 teeth, drawing with it the right small horizontal wheel one revolution (and so) pushing the central large horizontal wheel to revolve a quarter turn to the left. When it has turned around 12 teeth, the carriage moves eastwards, and the wooden figure stands crosswise and points south. If (instead) it turns (and goes) westwards, the (back end of the) pole is pushed to the left; the subordinate wheel attached to the left road-wheel will turn forward with the road-wheel 12 teeth, drawing with it the left small horizontal wheel one revolution, and pushing the central large horizontal wheel to revolve a quarter turn to the right. When it has turned round 12 teeth, the carriage moves due west, but still the wooden figure stands crosswise and points south. If one wishes to travel northwards, the turning round, whether by east or west, is done in the same way'.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 291 292"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 291&amp;ndash;292.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After this initial description of Yan Su's device, the text continues to describe the work of Wu Deren, who crafted a wheeled device that would combine the odometer and south-pointing chariot:

{{cquote|It was ordered that the method should be handed down to the (appropriate) officials so that the machine might be made. In the first year of the Da-Guan reign period (1107 AD), the Chamberlain Wu Deren presented specifications of the south-pointing carriage and the carriage with the li-recording drum (odometer). The two vehicles were made, and were first used that year at the great ceremony of the ancestral sacrifice.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 292"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 292.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{cquote|The body of the south-pointing carriage was 11.15 ft. (long), 9.5 ft. wide, and 10.9 ft. deep. The carriage wheels were 5.7 ft. in diameter, the [[carriage pole]] 10.5 ft. long, and the carriage body in two stories, upper and lower. In the middle was placed a partition. Above there stood a figure of a ''xian'' holding a rod, on the left and right were tortoises and cranes, one each on either side, and four figures of boys each holding a tassel. In the upper story there were at the four corners [[trip-mechanism]]s, and also 13 horizontal wheels, each 1.85 ft. in diameter, 5.55 ft. in circumference, with 32 teeth at intervals of 1.8 inches apart. A central shaft, mounted on the partition, pierced downwards.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 292"/&gt;}}

{{cquote|In the lower story were 13 wheels. In the middle was the largest horizontal wheel, 3.8 ft. in diameter, 11.4 ft. in circumference, and having 100 teeth at intervals of 2.1 inches apart. (On vertical axles) reaching to the top (of the compartment) left and right, were two small horizontal wheels which could rise and fall, having an iron weight (attached to) each. Each of these was 1.1 ft. in diameter and 3.3 ft. in circumference, with 17 teeth, at intervals of 1.9 inches apart. Again, to left and right, were attached wheels, one on each side, in diameter 1.55 ft., in circumference 4.65 ft., and having 24 teeth, at intervals of 2.1 inches.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 292"/&gt;}}

{{cquote|Left and right, too, were double gear-wheels (lit. tier-wheels), a pair on either side.

== Chariots with differential gears ==

===Background and explanation===
[[File:Transmission diagram.JPG|thumb|An illustration of a differential between the drive shaft (at bottom right) and driving wheels of an automobile]]

There is a widely believed hypothesis that most, if not all, south-pointing chariots worked by means of [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] gears.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} A differential is an assembly of gears, nowadays used in almost all automobiles except some electric and hybrid-electric ones, which has three shafts linking it to the external world. They are conveniently labelled A, B, and C. The gears cause the rotation speed of Shaft A to be proportional to the ''sum'' of the rotation speeds of Shafts B and C. There are no other limitations on the rotation speeds of the shafts.

In an automobile, Shaft A is connected to the engine (through the transmission), and Shafts B and C are connected to two road wheels, one on each side of the vehicle. When the vehicle turns, the wheel going around the outside of the turning curve has to roll further and rotate faster than the wheel on the inside. The differential permits this to happen while both wheels are being driven by the engine. If the sum of the speeds of the wheels is constant, the speed of the engine does not change.

In a south-pointing chariot, according to the hypothesis, Shaft B was connected to one road wheel and Shaft C was connected ''through a direction-reversing gear'' to the other road wheel. This made Shaft A rotate at a speed that was proportional to the ''difference'' between the rotation speeds of the two wheels. The pointing doll was connected (possibly through intermediate gears) to Shaft A. When the chariot moved in a straight line, the two wheels turned at equal speeds, and the doll did not rotate. When the chariot turned, the wheels rotated at different speeds (for the same reason as in an automobile), so the differential caused the doll to rotate, compensating for the turning of the chariot.

The hypothesis that there were south-pointing chariots with differential gears originated in the 20th century. People who were familiar with modern (e.g. automotive) uses of differentials interpreted some of the ancient Chinese descriptions in ways that agreed with their own ideas. Essentially, they re-invented the south-pointing chariot, as it had previously been re-invented several times in antiquity. Working chariots that use differentials have been constructed in recent decades. Whether any such chariots existed previously is not known with certainty.

Although the [[Antikythera mechanism#Investigations and reconstructions|Antikythera mechanism]] is believed to have used differential gears, the first true differential gear definitely known to have been used was by Joseph Williamson in 1720.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 298"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 298.&lt;/ref&gt; He used a differential for correcting the [[equation of time]] for a [[clock]] that displayed both [[Local mean time|mean]] and [[solar time]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 298" /&gt;

=== Geometrical properties ===
If the south-pointing chariot were built perfectly accurately, using a differential gear, and if it travelled on an Earth that was perfectly smooth, it would have interesting properties. It would be a mechanical compass that transports a direction, given by the pointer, along the path it travels. Mathematically the device performs [[parallel transport]] along the path it travels.

The chariot can be used to detect straight lines or [[geodesics]]. A path on a surface the chariot travels along is a geodesic if and only if the pointer does not rotate with respect to the base of the chariot.

Because of the [[curvature]] of the Earth's surface (due to it being curved around as a globe), the chariot would generally not continue to point due south as it moves. For example, if the chariot moves along a geodesic (as approximated by any [[great circle]]) the pointer should instead stay at a fixed angle to the path. Also, if two chariots travel by different routes between the same starting and finishing points, their pointers, which were aimed in the same direction at the start, usually do not point in the same direction at the finish. Likewise, if a chariot goes around a closed loop, starting and finishing at the same point on the Earth's surface, its pointer generally does not aim in the same direction at the finish as it did at the start. The difference is the [[holonomy]] of the path, and is proportional to the enclosed area. If the journeys are short compared with the radius of the Earth, these discrepancies are small and may have no practical importance. Nevertheless, they show that this type of chariot, based on differential gears, would be an imperfect compass even if constructed exactly and used in ideal conditions.

=== Lack of precision, and implications ===
Real machines are never built perfectly accurately. Simple geometry shows that if the chariot's mechanism is based on a differential gear and if, for example, the width of the track of the chariot (the separation between its wheels) is three metres, and if the wheels are intended to be identical but actually differ in diameter by one part in a thousand, then if the chariot travels one kilometre in a straight line, the "south-pointing" figure will rotate nearly twenty degrees. If it initially points exactly to the south, at the end of the one-kilometre trip it will point almost to the [[Cardinal direction|south-southeast]] or [[Boxing the compass|south-southwest]], depending on which wheel is the larger. If the chariot travels nine kilometres, the figure will end up pointing almost due north. Obviously, this would make it useless as a south-pointing compass. To be a useful navigational tool, the figure would have to rotate no more than a couple of degrees over a journey of a hundred kilometres, but this would require the chariot's wheels to be equal in diameter to within one part in a million. Even if the process of manufacturing the wheels were capable of this precision (which would not be possible with ancient Chinese methods), it is doubtful that the equality of the wheels could be maintained for long as they are subjected to the wear and tear of travelling across open country. Irregularity of the ground would add further errors to the device's functioning.

Considerable scepticism is therefore warranted as to whether this type of south-pointing chariot, using a differential gear for the whole time, was used in practice to navigate over long distances. Conceivably, the south-pointing doll was fixed to the body of the chariot while it was travelling in straight lines, and coupled to the differential only when the chariot was turning. The charioteer could have operated a control to do this just before and after making each turn, or maybe shouted commands to someone inside the chariot who connected and disconnected the doll and the differential. This could have been done without stopping the chariot. If turns were brief and rare, this would have greatly reduced the pointing errors, since they would have accumulated only during the short periods when the doll and differential were connected. However, it raises the problem of how the chariot could have been kept travelling in straight lines with sufficient accuracy without using the pointing doll.

If the real purposes of the chariot and the accounts of it were amusement and impressing visiting foreigners, rather than actual long-distance navigation, then its inaccuracy might not have been important.  Considering that a large mechanical wagon or chariot would be obligated to travel on roads, the destination in question would typically not be in an unknown direction.   The fact that the sources cited above mention that the chariot was placed at the front of processions, its high level of mechanical complexity and fragility, and that it was 'reinvented' several times contribute to the conclusion that it was not used for navigation, as a truly practical and useful navigational tool would not be forgotten or left unused.

== Chariots without differential gears ==

Although the hypothesis that the south-pointing chariot used differential gears has gained wide acceptance, it should be recognized that functional south-pointing chariots without differential gears are possible. The ancient descriptions are often unclear, but they suggest that the Chinese implemented several different designs, at least some of which did not include differentials.

=== Mechanical designs ===

Some of the ancient descriptions suggest that some south-pointing chariots could move in only three ways: straight ahead, or turning left or right with a fixed radius of curvature. A third wheel might have been used to fix the turning radius. If the chariot was turning, the pointing doll was connected by gears to one or other of the two main road wheels (e.g. whichever was on the outside of the curve around which the chariot was moving) so the doll rotated at a fixed speed, relative to the rate of the chariot's movement, to compensate for the predetermined rate of turn. The doll turned in opposite directions depending on which road wheel was connected to it, so its rotation compensated for the chariot turning left or right. This design would have been simpler than using a differential gear.

The chariots of Yan Su and Wu Deren appear to have used this type of mechanism. (See descriptions quoted from the ''Song Shi'', above.) Apart from the presence of components in Wu Deren's vehicle to make it function as an [[odometer]], there were only minor differences between them. In each chariot, the two main road wheels were attached to vertical gear wheels. A large horizontal gear wheel was linked (possibly via intermediate gearing) to the pointing doll, and was positioned so a diameter almost spanned the space between the uppermost points of the vertical gear wheels. When the chariot was moving straight ahead, there was no connection between these gears, but when the chariot turned, a small gear wheel was lowered into contact with the horizontal gear and one of the vertical gears, thus linking the doll to one of the road wheels. Two small gear wheels were available, one to connect the horizontal gear to each of the vertical ones. Of course, they were not used simultaneously. The small gear wheels were raised and lowered by an arrangement of weights, pulleys and cords which were attached to the pole to which the horses that pulled the chariot were harnessed. When the horses moved to one side or the other, in order to turn the chariot, the pole moved and the cords lowered the appropriate small gear wheel into its working position. When the horses returned to walking straight ahead, the small gear wheel was raised out of contact with the main horizontal and vertical gears. Thus the system functioned automatically. The mirror-symmetry of the vertical gears being linked by the small gears to the horizontal gear at diametrically opposite points caused the horizontal gear to rotate in opposite directions depending on which road wheel was linked to it, thus rotating the pointing doll in opposite directions when the chariot turned left and right.

The description does not mention a third road wheel to fix the turning radius, but it is possible that such a wheel was present. No gears would have been attached to it, so perhaps the author of the description did not mention it because he did not realize that it was an important part of the mechanism. Putting such a wheel on the chariot and making it function properly would not have been difficult. It might have been attached to the pole to which the horses were harnessed. Stops would have been provided to limit the motions of the pole to left and right.

If a third road wheel was included, this type of south-pointing chariot could have worked quite accurately as a compass when used for short journeys under good conditions, but if used for long journeys it would have been subject to cumulative errors, like chariots using the differential mechanism.

If in fact there was no third road wheel, the chariot might have functioned as a compass if turns were always made so that one of the two wheels was stationary and only the other rotated, with the pointing doll connected to it by gears. The charioteer could have kept the stationary wheel from turning by controlling the horses appropriately. (A [[brake]] would have helped, but there is no mention of one in the description.) The radius of the curve around which the rotating wheel moved would have equalled the track-width of the chariot, and the gears turning the doll would have been chosen accordingly. This design would have worked as a compass for short journeys, but would have suffered from cumulative errors if used for long ones. Also, the chariot would have been slow and awkward to turn. This might not have mattered if turns were rarely executed.

The ''Song Shi'' description of the gears in Yan Su's chariot, and the numbers of teeth on them, suggests that it worked this way, without a third road wheel. The gear ratios would have been correct if the pointing doll was attached directly to the large horizontal gear wheel, and the track-width of the chariot equalled the diameter of the road wheels. Wu Deren's chariot also appears to have been designed to work this way. The width of the chariot, and therefore presumably the track-width, was greater than the diameter of the wheels. The gear ratios were appropriate for these dimensions.

The charioteer would have had to use great skill to ensure that the radius of each turn of the chariot was correct to make one of the wheels exactly stop rotating. Unless he did this correctly, the pointing doll would not have kept aiming to the south. He would have been able to adjust the direction in which it aimed by making turns that were more or less sharp. This would sometimes have given him opportunities to use the chariot dishonestly. If it was being demonstrated to spectators, for example, and was being driven around in front of them, making many turns, the charioteer, who would have known which way was south, would have been able to make the chariot ''appear to'' work extremely accurately as a compass for long periods. The spectators could have been shown the machinery, and would have seen that the charioteer could not manipulate the doll. They would presumably have been impressed by the apparent accuracy of the mechanism. It is possible that this type of chariot was sometimes constructed with the prime purpose of fraudulently impressing spectators. Possibly, people who built these chariots deceived their own employers with them, which could have gained them fame and fortune provided nobody tried using the chariots for real navigation.

Other mechanical designs for the south-pointing chariot are also possible, including ones that employ a device that is used today, the [[gyrocompass]]. However, there is no indication that the ancient Chinese knew of these.

=== Non-mechanical possibilities ===

Some south-pointing chariots may not have been purely mechanical devices. Someone riding inside the chariot may have used some non-mechanical method of determining the compass directions, and turned the doll on top of the chariot accordingly. There are several methods that could have been used, for example:

* By using a [[Compass#Magnetic compass|magnetic compass]]. The Chinese were using this for navigation by the 11th century CE, when south-pointing chariots were still being made and used.
* By using astronomical observations of the Sun and/or stars, e.g. the [[Pole Star]]. [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese astronomical knowledge]] was extensive.
* By using local knowledge. The person in the chariot may have known the area or had a map or description of it.
* By observing the polarization of light from the sky. Vikings used [[birefringent]] crystals of [[Iceland spar]] to navigate across the Atlantic Ocean by this method at about the same time.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Iceland spar is found in China, as well as in Iceland and some other places. Insects such as bees can respond to sky polarization and use it to find their way home. Whether the Chinese used it is hypothetical, but it is certainly possible.
* By observing light that had been refracted by the Earth's atmosphere. This is one of the techniques that were used by Polynesian navigators to steer ships among Pacific islands. When the surface of the Earth, ocean or ground, is colder than the air above it, a dense layer of air is formed near the surface, which refracts light downward. The result is that light can go around the curvature of the Earth, allowing things to be seen at much greater distances than simple geometry would predict. The images are very distorted, but they can be recognized by skilled navigators. Certain other Polynesian techniques can also be used on land and may have been employed by the Chinese.

Unlike mechanisms that rely on the rotation of road wheels, most of these methods can be used at sea. This may account for the mention (see "Earliest sources" above) that a marine version of the south-pointing chariot existed.

These methods can work accurately over long distances, unlike the mechanical designs for the chariot.

==Necessity of non-mechanical orientation==
[[File:South-pointing chariot, China Court, Ibn Battuta Mall, Dubai.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A wooden two-wheeled cart supporting a series of wooden peg gears and a metal statue pointing with one outstretched hand.|South-pointing chariot replica at the [[Ibn Battuta Mall]], Dubai]]

Some non-mechanical method of finding the south must have been used when a mechanical south-pointing chariot was [[wiktionary:initialize|initialized]], aiming its pointer to the south at the start of a journey. Any of the methods mentioned above in "Non-mechanical possibilities" could have been used.

If any south-pointing chariot was really used for long-distance navigation, it must have relied (after initialization) on a non-mechanical direction-finding method. It might have been operated non-mechanically by someone riding in it, as outlined above. Alternatively, if it had a mechanical mechanism, it must have been frequently re-initialized non-mechanically to eliminate accumulated errors and uncertainties.

The only chariots that might not have needed non-mechanical methods of finding the south would have been those that were never used for long-distance navigation. If some chariots were used only for amusement or fraud, they could have worked purely mechanically. Even initialization could have been avoided by simply declaring some arbitrary direction to be "south".

== Where they can be seen ==
While none of the historic south-pointing chariots remain, full sized replicas can be found.

The History Museum in [[Beijing]], [[China]], holds a replica based on the mechanism of Yen Su (1027).
The [[National Palace Museum]] in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]], holds a replica based on the Lanchester mechanism of 1932.

Referred to as the "southern pointing man", two replicas can also be seen (and physically experimented with) at the Ontario Science Centre in Toronto, Canada.

'''Southwest Windpower (SWWP)''' is a [[wind turbine]] manufacturer established in 1987 based in [[Flagstaff, Arizona]], [[United States]]. The company specializes in small, reliable battery charging wind generators that complement photovoltaics (solar energy or PV) in supplying energy to rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greeneconomyinitiative.com/news/215/ARTICLE/1583/2009-07-09.html Southwest Windpower]&lt;/ref&gt;

Southwest Windpower closed for business in the first quarter of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irecusa.org/2013/05/what-happened-to-southwest-wind-power/ What Happened to Southwest Wind Power?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining Skystream assets were acquired by Xzeres wind in July 2013.  Xzeres CEO Frank Greco had been the CEO of Southwest Windpower.&lt;ref&gt;

==Certifications==

In 2000, SWWP became the first wind turbine manufacturer to receive [[Underwriters Laboratories]] (UL) and [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) certification, for its AIR series wind turbines. Southwest Windpower’s latest turbine, the [[Skystream]] 3.7, has a rotor diameter of about {{convert|12|ft|m}} and can generate up to half an average U.S. home's energy in optimal winds. It is the first residential-scale wind generator designed specifically for the grid-connected home or small business. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Skystream is the first device to be spun out of the U.S. Department of Energy's Wind Energy Program. That program includes the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] Wind Technology Center in Boulder CO. Andrew Kruse estimates that one Skystream will produce about 100 [[megawatt hour|MWh]] of energy over its 20-year design life. At a typical total installed cost of $15,000, that gives an average energy cost of 9 cents per kilowatthour.&lt;ref name="ieee_jones"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 the company received a Statement of Compliance from [[Germanischer Lloyd]] which confirms that Skystream 3.7 meets the requirements of the IEC Standard 61400-2:2006, Edition 2, "Design requirements for Small wind turbines," which addresses safety philosophy, quality assurance and engineering integrity of the turbine.&lt;ref name="gl"&gt;{{cite web

{{Tropicalcyclone}}

A '''storm surge''', '''storm flood''' or '''storm tide''' is a [[coastal flood]] or [[tsunami]]-like phenomenon of rising water commonly associated with [[low pressure area|low pressure]] weather systems (such as [[tropical cyclone]]s and strong [[extratropical cyclone]]s), the severity of which is affected by the shallowness and orientation of the water body relative to storm path, as well as the timing of [[tide]]s. Most casualties during tropical cyclones occur as the result of storm surges. It is a measure of the rise of water beyond what would be expected by the normal movement related to tides.

The two main [[meteorology|meteorological]] factors contributing to a storm surge are a long [[Fetch (geography)|fetch]] of winds spiraling inward toward the storm, and a low-pressure-induced dome of water drawn up under and trailing the storm's center.

The low-lying coast of the Bay of Bengal is particularly vulnerable to surges caused by tropical cyclones.&lt;ref name="NASA" /&gt; The deadliest storm surge in the twenty-first century was caused by the [[Cyclone Nargis]], which killed more than 138,000 people in [[Myanmar]] in May 2008.

The [[Galveston Hurricane of 1900]], a [[Category 4 hurricane|Category&amp;nbsp;4 hurricane]] that struck [[Galveston, Texas]], drove a devastating surge ashore; between 6,000 and 12,000&amp;nbsp;lives were lost, making it the deadliest [[natural disaster]] ever to strike the United States.&lt;ref name="Herbert 1983" /&gt;

The highest storm tide noted in historical accounts was produced by the 1899 [[Cyclone Mahina]], estimated at almost 44&amp;nbsp;ft (13&amp;nbsp;metres) at [[Bathurst Bay]], [[Australia]], but research published in 2000 concluded that the majority of this likely was wave run-up because of the steep coastal topography.&lt;ref name="Nott and Hayne" /&gt; In the United States, one of the greatest recorded storm surges was generated by [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, which produced a maximum storm surge of more than 25&amp;nbsp;ft (8&amp;nbsp;metres) in southern [[Mississippi]], with a storm surge height of 27.8&amp;nbsp;ft (8.5&amp;nbsp;m)  in [[Pass Christian, Mississippi|Pass Christian]].&lt;ref name="FEMA1"&gt;{{cite web|author=FEMA|publisher=Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)|date=2006-05-30|accessdate=2008-08-11|title=Hurricane Katrina Flood Recovery (Mississippi)|url=http://www.fema.gov/hazard/flood/recoverydata/katrina/katrina_ms_methods.shtm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917203942/http://www.fema.gov/hazard/flood/recoverydata/katrina/katrina_ms_methods.shtm|archivedate=2008-09-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KatrinaTCR" /&gt; Another record storm surge occurred in this same area from [[Hurricane Camille]] in 1969, with a storm tide of 24.6&amp;nbsp;ft (7.5&amp;nbsp;m), also at Pass Christian.&lt;ref name="Simpson, 1969" /&gt;  A storm surge of 14&amp;nbsp;ft (4.2&amp;nbsp;m) occurred in [[New York City]] during [[Hurricane Sandy]] in October 2012.

==Mechanics==
At least five processes can be involved in altering [[tide]] levels during storms: 
* The atmospheric pressure effect
* The direct wind effect
* The effect of the Earth's rotation
* The effect of waves near the shore
* The rainfall effect.&lt;ref name="Har63" /&gt;

The pressure effects of a tropical cyclone will cause the water level in the open ocean to rise in regions of low [[atmospheric pressure]] and fall in regions of high atmospheric pressure. The rising water level will counteract the low atmospheric pressure such that the total pressure at some plane beneath the water surface remains constant. This effect is estimated at a {{convert|10|mm|in|abbr=on}} increase in sea level for every [[millibar]] (hPa) drop in atmospheric pressure.&lt;ref name="Har63" /&gt;

Strong surface winds cause surface currents at a 45° angle to the wind direction, by an effect known as the [[Ekman Spiral]]. Wind stresses cause a phenomenon referred to as "wind set-up", which is the tendency for water levels to increase at the downwind shore and to decrease at the upwind shore. Intuitively, this is caused by the storm blowing the water toward one side of the basin in the direction of its winds. Because the Ekman Spiral effects spread vertically through the water, the effect is proportional to depth. The pressure effect and the wind set-up on an open coast will be driven into bays in the same way as the astronomical tide.&lt;ref name="Har63" /&gt;

The Earth's rotation causes the [[Coriolis effect]], which bends currents to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. When this bend brings the currents into more perpendicular contact with the shore, it can amplify the surge, and when it bends the current away from the shore it has the effect of lessening the surge.&lt;ref name="Har63" /&gt;

The effect of waves, while directly powered by the wind, is distinct from a storm's wind-powered currents. Powerful wind whips up large, strong waves in the direction of its movement.&lt;ref name="Har63" /&gt; Although these surface waves are responsible for very little water transport in open water, they may be responsible for significant transport near the shore. When waves are breaking on a line more or less parallel to the beach, they carry considerable water shoreward. As they break, the water particles moving toward the shore have considerable momentum and may run up a sloping beach to an elevation above the mean water line, which may exceed twice the wave height before breaking.&lt;ref name="Granthem 1953" /&gt;

The rainfall effect is experienced predominantly in [[Estuary|estuaries]]. Hurricanes may dump as much as {{convert|12|in|abbr=on}} of rainfall in 24&amp;nbsp;hours over large areas and higher rainfall densities in localized areas. As a result, [[surface runoff]] can quickly flood Streams and rivers. This can increase the water level near the head of tidal estuaries as storm-driven waters surging in from the ocean meet rainfall flowing downstream into the estuary.&lt;ref name="Har63" /&gt;

===Other processes===
In addition to the above processes, surge and wave heights on shore are also affected by the flow of water over the underlying topography, i.e. the configuration and bathymetry of the ocean bottom and affected coastal area. A narrow [[Continental shelf|shelf]], for example, or one that has a steep drop from the shoreline and subsequently produces deep water in proximity to the shoreline, tends to produce a lower surge but a higher and more powerful wave. This situation is well exemplified by the southeast coast of [[Florida]]. The edge of the Floridian Plateau, where the water depths reach {{convert|91|m|ft}}, lies just {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}} offshore of [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]]; just {{convert|7000|m|ft|abbr=on}} offshore, the depth increases to over {{convert|180|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Lane 1980" /&gt; The {{convert|180|m|ft|abbr=on}} depth contour followed southward from [[Palm Beach County]] lies more than {{convert|30000|m|ft|abbr=on}} to the east of the [[Florida Keys]].

Conversely, coastlines along North America such as those along the [[Gulf of Mexico]] coast from Texas to Florida, and [[Asia]] such as the Bay of Bengal, have long, gently sloping shelves and shallow water depths. On the Gulf side of Florida, the edge of the Floridian Plateau lies more than {{convert|160|km|mi}} offshore of Marco Island in [[Collier County]]. [[Florida Bay]], lying between the Florida Keys and the mainland, is also very shallow; depths typically vary between {{convert|0.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Lane 1981" /&gt; These areas are subject to higher storm surges with smaller waves. This difference is because in deeper water, a surge can be dispersed down and away from the hurricane. However, upon entering a shallow, gently sloping [[Continental shelf|shelf]], the surge cannot be disperse, but is driven ashore by the wind stresses of the hurricane. Topography of the land surface is another important element in storm surge extent. Areas where the land lies less than a few meters above sea level are at particular risk from storm surge inundation.&lt;ref name="Har63" /&gt;

For a given topography and bathymetry the surge height is not solely affected by peak wind speed; the size of the storm also affects the peak surge. With any storm, the area of piled up water can flow out of the storm perimeter, and this escape mechanism is reduced in proportion to the surge force (for the same peak wind speed) when the storm covers more area (storm perimeter length per area is inversely proportional to a circular storm's diameter).&lt;ref&gt;Irish, Jennifer L., Donald T. Resio, and Jay J. Ratcliff. “The Influence of Storm Size on Hurricane Surge.” Journal of Physical Oceanography 38, no. 9 (September 1, 2008): 2003–13. {{doi|10.1175/2008JPO3727.1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extratropical storms===
Similar to tropical cyclones, extra-tropical storms cause an offshore rise of water. However, unlike most tropical cyclone storm surges, extra-tropical storms can cause higher water levels across a large area for longer periods of time, depending on the system.

In North America, extra-tropical storm surges may occur on the Pacific and Alaska coasts, and north of 31°N on the Atlantic Coast. Coasts with sea ice may experience an "ice tsunami" causing significant damage inland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meyer|first1=Robinson|title=The ‘Ice Tsunami’ That Buried a Whole Herd of Weird Arctic Mammals|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/01/the-ice-tsunami-that-entombed-the-arctics-weirdest-mammal/550808/|accessdate=19 January 2018|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Extra-tropical storm surges may be possible further south for the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf coast]] mostly during the wintertime, when extra-tropical cyclones affect the coast, such as in the [[1993 Storm of the Century]]&lt;ref name="superstorm-march-1993"&gt;{{cite web | title = Superstorm of March 1993 | author = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] | url = https://www.weather.gov/media/publications/assessments/Superstorm_March-93.pdf | accessdate=January 31, 2018 | year=1994 | publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131201527/https://www.weather.gov/media/publications/assessments/Superstorm_March-93.pdf | archivedate=January 31, 2018 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

November 9–13, 2009, marked a significant extratropical storm surge event on the United States east coast when the remnants of [[Hurricane Ida (2009)|Hurricane Ida]] developed into a [[Nor'easter]] off the southeast U.S. coast. During the event, winds from the east were present along the northern periphery of the low pressure center for a number of days, forcing water into locations such as [[Chesapeake Bay]]. Water levels rose significantly and remained as high as {{convert|8|ft}} above normal in numerous locations throughout the Chesapeake for a number of days as water was continually built-up inside the estuary from the onshore winds and freshwater rains flowing into the bay. In many locations, water levels were shy of records by only {{convert|0.1|ft|cm|0}}.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Measuring surge==
Surge can be measured directly at coastal tidal stations as the difference between the forecast tide and the observed rise of water.&lt;ref name="VIMS" /&gt; Another method of measuring surge is by the deployment of pressure transducers along the coastline just ahead of an approaching tropical cyclone. This was first tested for [[Hurricane Rita]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="USGS" /&gt; These types of sensors can be placed in locations that will be submerged and can accurately measure the height of water above them.&lt;ref name="HOBO" /&gt;

After surge from a cyclone has receded, teams of surveyors map high-water marks (HWM) on land, in a rigorous and detailed process that includes photographs and written descriptions of the marks. HWMs denote the location and elevation of flood waters from a storm event. When HWMs are analyzed, if the various components of the water height can be broken out so that the portion attributable to surge can be identified, then that mark can be classified as storm surge. Otherwise, it is classified as storm tide. HWMs on land are referenced to a vertical datum (a reference coordinate system). During evaluation, HWMs are divided into four categories based on the confidence in the mark; only HWMs evaluated as "excellent" are used by [[National Hurricane Center]] in post-storm analysis of the surge.&lt;ref name="Katrina-surge" /&gt;

Two different measures are used for storm tide and storm surge measurements. Storm tide is measured using a [[Geodesy|geodetic]] vertical datum ([[National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929|NGVD 29]] or [[NAVD 88]]). Since storm surge is defined as the rise of water beyond what would be expected by the normal movement caused by tides, storm surge is measured using tidal predictions, with the assumption that the tide prediction is well-known and only slowly varying in the region subject to the surge. Since tides are a localized phenomenon, storm surge can only be measured in relationship to a nearby tidal station. Tidal bench mark information at a station provides a translation from the geodetic vertical datum to [[Mean sea level|mean sea level (MSL)]] at that location, then subtracting the tidal prediction yields a surge height above the normal water height.&lt;ref name="VIMS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Katrina-surge" /&gt;

==SLOSH==
[[Image:Sloshrun.gif|thumb|right|Example of a SLOSH run]]
{{Main|Sea, Lake, and Overland Surge from Hurricanes}}
{{See also|Tropical cyclone forecasting}}
The National Hurricane Center forecasts storm surge using the SLOSH model, which is an abbreviation for Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes. The model is accurate to within 20&amp;nbsp;percent.&lt;ref name="NHC_SLOSH_model" /&gt; SLOSH inputs include the central pressure of a tropical cyclone, storm size, the cyclone's forward motion, its track, and maximum sustained winds. Local topography, bay and river orientation, depth of the sea bottom, astronomical tides, as well as other physical features, are taken into account in a predefined grid referred to as a SLOSH basin. Overlapping SLOSH basins are defined for the southern and eastern coastline of the continental U.S.&lt;ref name="SLOSH_map" /&gt; Some storm simulations use more than one SLOSH basin; for instance, Hurricane Katrina SLOSH model runs used both the [[Lake Ponchartrain]] / [[New Orleans]] basin, and the [[Mississippi Sound]] basin, for the northern Gulf of Mexico landfall. The final output from the model run will display the maximum envelope of water, or MEOW, that occurred at each location.

To allow for track or forecast uncertainties, usually several model runs with varying input parameters are generated to create a map of MOMs, or Maximum of Maximums.&lt;ref name="PC Weather Products" /&gt; For hurricane evacuation studies, a family of storms with representative tracks for the region, and varying intensity, eye diameter, and speed, are modeled to produce worst-case water heights for any tropical cyclone occurrence. The results of these studies are typically generated from several thousand SLOSH runs. These studies have been completed by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]], under contract to the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]], for several states and are available on their Hurricane Evacuation Studies (HES) website.&lt;ref name="HESHOME" /&gt; They include coastal county maps, shaded to identify the minimum category of hurricane that will result in flooding, in each area of the county.&lt;ref name="HES_Jackson" /&gt;

==Mitigation==
Although meteorological surveys alert about hurricanes or severe storms, in the areas where the risk of coastal flooding is particularly high, there are specific storm surge warnings. These have been implemented, for instance, in the [[Netherlands]],&lt;ref name="Rijkswaterstaat" /&gt; [[Spain]],&lt;ref name="Forcast system" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gobierno" /&gt; the United States,&lt;ref name="Stevens Institute" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Franklin" /&gt; and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="Environment Agency" /&gt;

A prophylactic method introduced after the [[North Sea Flood of 1953]] is the construction of dams and storm-surge barriers ([[flood barrier]]s). They are open and allow free passage, but close when the land is under threat of a storm surge. Major storm surge barriers are the [[Oosterscheldekering]] and [[Maeslantkering]] in the Netherlands, which are part of the [[Delta Works]] project; the [[Thames Barrier]] protecting [[London]]; and the [[Saint Petersburg Dam]] in [[Russia]].

Another modern development (in use in the Netherlands) is the creation of housing communities at the edges of wetlands with floating structures, restrained in position by vertical pylons.&lt;ref name="San Francisco Chronicle" /&gt; Such wetlands can then be used to accommodate runoff and surges without causing damage to the structures while also protecting conventional structures at somewhat higher low-lying elevations, provided that dikes prevent major surge intrusion.

For mainland areas, storm surge is more of a threat when the storm strikes land from seaward, rather than approaching from landward.&lt;ref name="fl100527" /&gt;&lt;!--a bit hard wording this generically. Cross-state storms are not unheard of in Florida!---&gt;

==Reverse storm surge==
Water can also be sucked away from shore prior to a storm surge. This was the case on the western Florida coast in 2017, just before [[Hurricane Irma]] made landfall, uncovering land usually underwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/10/us/shorelines-drained-hurricane-irma-storm-surge/index.html|title=Shorelines drained in eerie effect of Hurricane Irma|last=CNN|first=Ray Sanchez|website=CNN|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon is known as a '''reverse storm surge''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/weather/hurricane/article172746766.html|title=Irma’s powerful winds cause eerie retreat of ocean waters, stranding manatees and boats|work=Miami Herald|first=Linda|last=Robertson|date=11 September 2017|accessdate=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a '''negative storm surge'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/learning/learn-about-the-weather/weather-phenomena/storm-surge|title=Storm Surge|work=Met Office|accessdate=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tight gas''' is [[natural gas]] produced from reservoir rocks with such low permeability that massive [[hydraulic fracturing]] is necessary to produce the well at economic rates. Tight gas reservoirs are generally defined as having less than 0.1 milli[[darcy (unit)|darcy]] (mD) matrix [[permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] and less than ten percent matrix porosity.&lt;ref&gt;Ben E. Law and Charles W. Spencer, 1993, "Gas in tight reservoirs-an emerging major source of energy," ''in'' David G. Howell (ed.), ''The Future of Energy Gasses'', US Geological Survey, Professional Paper 1570, p.233-252.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ali Sharif, [http://www.dmp.wa.gov.au/documents/Tight-gas__Resources_in_Western_Australia.pdf Tight gas resources in Western Australia], Western Australia Department of Mines and Petroleum, Sept. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Although shales have low permeability and low effective porosity, [[shale gas]] is usually considered separate from tight gas, which is contained most commonly in sandstone, but sometimes in limestone. Tight gas is considered an unconventional source of natural gas.

Rock with permeabilities as little as one [[nanodarcy]], [[reservoir simulation|reservoir stimulation]] may be economically productive with optimized spacing and completion of staged fractures to maximize yield with respect to cost.&lt;ref name="netl"&gt;{{cite web

[[Image:True vertical depth.jpg|thumb|250 px|right|(a) is an imaginary line representing the true vertical depth, while line (b) is the [[borehole]] itself, and its length is called the measured depth.]]

'''True vertical depth'''[http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=true%20vertical%20depth] is the measurement of a straight line [[perpendicular]]ly downwards from a [[horizontal plane]].

In the [[petroleum industry]], true vertical depth, abbreviated as TVD, is the measurement from the surface to the bottom of the [[borehole]] (or anywhere along its length) in a straight perpendicular line represented by line (a) in the image.

Line (b) is the actual borehole and its length would be considered the '''[[measured depth]]''' [http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=measured%20depth] in [[oil industry|oilfield]] terminology. The TVD is ''always'' equal to or less than (≤) the ''measured depth''. If you imagine line (b) were a piece of string and pull it straight down, you would see that it would be longer than line (a). This example [[oilwell]] would be considered a [[directional well]] because it deviates from a straight vertical line.

A '''vertical wind tunnel''' (VWT) is a [[wind tunnel]] which moves air up in a vertical column.  Unlike standard wind tunnels which have test sections that are oriented horizontally, as experienced in [[level flight]], a vertical orientation enables gravity to be countered by drag instead of lift, as experienced in an aircraft [[spin (aerodynamics)|spin]] or by a [[skydiver]] at [[terminal velocity]].

Although vertical wind tunnels have been built for aerodynamic research, the most high-profile are those used as recreational wind tunnels, frequently advertised as indoor skydiving or [[bodyflight]],  which have also become a popular training tool for skydivers.

==Recreational vertical wind tunnels==
A recreational wind tunnel enables human beings to experience the sensation of flight without planes or parachutes, through the force of wind being generated vertically. Air moves upwards at approximately 195&amp;nbsp;km/h (120&amp;nbsp;mph or 55 [[Metre per second|m/s]]), the [[terminal velocity]] of a falling human body belly-downwards. A vertical wind tunnel is frequently called 'indoor skydiving' due to the popularity of vertical wind tunnels among skydivers, who report that the sensation is extremely similar to skydiving.{{Clarify|date=September 2018}}  The human body 'floats' in midair in a vertical wind tunnel, replicating the physics of 'body flight' or '[[bodyflight]]' experienced during [[freefall]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.discovery.com/adventure/extreme-sports/what-is-indoor-skydiving-2.htm , Discovery News Blog Post about Indoor Skydiving]&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The first human to fly in a vertical wind tunnel was Jack Tiffany in 1964 at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] located in Greene and Montgomery County, Ohio.

In 1982 Jean St-Germain, an inventor from Drummondville, Quebec, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ha |first=Tu Thanh|date=23 September 2016|title=Jean St-Germain, Quebec’s eccentric inventor of diverse devices |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/obituary-jean-st-germain-quebecs-eccentric-inventor-of-diversedevices/article32040314/| work=The Globe and Mail |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; sold a vertical wind tunnel concept to both Les Thompson and Marvin Kratter, both of whom went on to build their own wind tunnels. Soon after, St Germain sold the franchising rights to Kratter for $1.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indoorskydivingsource.com/articles/a-complete-history-of-the-vertical-wind-tunnel/, A Complete History of the Vertical Wind Tunnel]&lt;/ref&gt; Originally known as the "Aérodium", it was patented as the "Levitationarium" by Jean St. Germain in the USA in 1984 and 1994 under Patent Nos. 4,457,509 and 5,318,481, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite patent

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Germain then helped build two wind tunnels in America. The first vertical wind tunnel, built solely for a commercial use, opened in the summer of 1982 in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]].  Later that same year, a second wind tunnel opened in [[Pigeon Forge]], [[Tennessee]].  Both facilities opened and operated under the name of Flyaway Indoor Skydiving. In 2005 the 15-year Flyaway Manager Keith Fields purchased the Las Vegas facility and later renamed it "Vegas Indoor Skydiving".

The first reference, in print, to a Vertical Wind Tunnel specifically for parachuting was published in [http://kidbots.com/WEBADD/INVENTIONS/ETERNITY_MACHINE.html CANPARA] (the Canadian Sport Parachuting Magazine) in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kidbots.com/WEBADD/INVENTIONS/ETERNITY_MACHINE.html CANPARA Journal from Self-published source]&lt;/ref&gt;

A milestone in vertical wind tunnel history was 'Wind Machine' at the [[2006 Winter Olympics Closing Ceremony|closing ceremonies]] of the [[2006 Winter Olympics|2006 Torino Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref name="Olympic Wind Machine 2006 Closing Ceremonies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodyflight.net/2006_torinno_olympics_.html|title=Olympic Wind Machine 2006 Closing Ceremonies|work=Bodyflight Network Vertical Wind Tunnels|accessdate=2 August 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825050634/http://www.bodyflight.net/2006_torinno_olympics_.html|archivedate=25 August 2006|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a custom-built unit by [[Aerodium Latvia|Aerodium]] (Latvia/Canada) for the closing ceremony.  Many people had never seen a vertical wind tunnel before, and were fascinated by the flying humans with no wires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/WINTER-OLYMPICS-TURIN-2006-ON-TO-BEIJING-2522429.php, Picture of flying snowboarder]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aerodium-technologies.com/en/shows-old/gallery/shows/shows/ Picture gallery on Aerodium website]&lt;/ref&gt;

A vertical wind tunnel performance in [[Moscow]]'s [[Red Square]] was shown in 2009 during the presentation of logotype of [[2014 Winter Olympics|Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.livejournal.com/869305.html Wind Tunnel at the Red Square in LiveJournal]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, a vertical wind tunnel was shown at the Latvian exhibition of Expo 2010 in Shanghai, China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archdaily.com/48851/latvia-pavilion-for-shanghai-world-expo-2010/ Description of the Latvia pavilion for Shanghai World Expo 2010 in Archdaily]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types===

Outdoor vertical wind tunnels can either be portable or stationary. Portable vertical wind tunnels are often used in movies and demonstrations, and are often rented for large events such as conventions and state fairs.  Portable units offer a dramatic effect for the flying person and the spectators, because there are no walls around the flight area.  These vertical wind tunnels allow people to fly with a full or partial outdoor/sky view.  Outdoor vertical wind tunnels may also have walls or netting around the wind column, to keep beginner tunnel flyers from falling out of the tunnel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://extremesports.about.com/od/skydiving/g/Definition-Of-Vertical-Wind-Tunnel.htm About.com description]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stationary indoor vertical wind tunnels include recirculating and non-recirculating types.  Non-recirculating vertical wind tunnels usually suck air through inlets near the bottom of the building, through the bodyflight area, and exhaust through the top of the building.  Recirculating wind tunnels form an aerodynamic loop with turning vanes, similar to a scientific [[wind tunnel]], but using a vertical loop with a bodyflight chamber within a vertical part of the loop. Recirculating wind tunnels are usually built in climates that are too cold for non-recirculating wind tunnels. The airflow of an indoor vertical wind tunnel is usually smoother and more controlled than that of an outdoor unit. Indoor tunnels are more temperature-controllable, so they are operated year-round even in cold climates.

Various propellers and fan types can be used as the mechanism to move air through a vertical wind tunnel. Motors can either be diesel-powered or electric-powered, and typically provide a vertical column of air between 6 and 16&amp;nbsp;feet wide.  A control unit allows for air speed adjustment by a controller in constant view of the flyers.  Wind speed can be adjusted at many vertical wind tunnels, usually between 130 and 300&amp;nbsp;km/h (80 and 185&amp;nbsp;mph, or 35 and 80 [[Metre per second|m/s]]), to accommodate the abilities of an individual and to compensate for variable body drag during advanced acrobatics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140228112028/http://www.eng.fiu.edu/mme/robotics/EML4905SeniorDesignProject/SampleSeniorDesignProjects/2011Fall/2011fall-T6-VerticalWindTunnel.pdf University Of Florida, THESIS, VERTICAL WIND TUNNEL (VWT) Final Report, November 16, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety and market appeal===
Indoor skydiving also appeals to the [[mass market]] audience that are [[Acrophobia|afraid of heights]], since in a vertical wind tunnel, one only floats a few meters above trampoline-type netting. Indoor vertical wind tunnels contain the person within a chamber through the use of walls. While wind tunnel flying is considered a low impact activity, it does exert some strain on the flier's back, neck, and shoulders.  Therefore, people with shoulder dislocations or back/neck problems should check with a doctor first.  While actual skydiving out of an aircraft is subject to age limitations which vary from country to country, and even from state to state in the US, bodyflying has no set lower or upper limits. Children can fly provided that they are happy and are not being pressed to participate, and they have parental/guardian signed consent.

=== Competitions ===
A number of competitions based on indoor skydiving have emerged, such as the FAI [[World Cup of Indoor Skydiving]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/singaporean-crowned-junior-freestyle-champion-at-indoor/3209096.html|title=Singaporean crowned junior freestyle champion at indoor skydiving World Cup|newspaper=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=2017-02-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Windoor [[Wind Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Skydivers compete in Wind Games 2017|date=2017-02-03|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38863714|language=en-GB|accessdate=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/sport/spore-teen-kyra-poh-wins-junior-freestyle-gold-in-at-indoor-skydiving-world-cup-in-poland|title=Singapore teen Kyra Poh wins junior freestyle gold at Indoor Skydiving World Cup|last=Wong|first=Jonathan|date=2016-10-16|newspaper=The Straits Times|access-date=2017-02-06|work=|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wetting''' is the ability of a [[liquid]] to maintain contact with a [[solid]] [[surface science|surface]], resulting from [[intermolecular]] interactions when the two are brought together. The degree of wetting (wettability) is determined by a force balance between [[adhesion|adhesive]] and [[cohesion (chemistry)|cohesive]] [[force]]s. Wetting deals with the three phases of materials: gas, liquid, and solid. It is now a center of attention in nanotechnology and nanoscience studies due to the advent of many nanomaterials in the past two decades (e.g. [[graphene]],&lt;ref&gt;J Rafiee, X Mi, H Gullapalli, AV Thomas, F Yavari, Y Shi, PM Ajayan, NA Koratkar, Wetting transparency of graphene, Nature Materials 11 (3), 217-222.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carbon nano tube|carbon nanotube]], boron nitride [[nanomesh]]&lt;ref&gt;SFL Mertens, A Hemmi, S Muff, O Gröning, S De Feyter, J Osterwalder, T Greber, Switching stiction and adhesion of a liquid on a solid, Nature 534, 2016, 676–679.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Wetting is important in the [[Chemical bond|bonding]] or [[adhesion|adherence]] of two materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dvsODgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=Wetting+is+important+in+the+bonding+of+two+materials#v=onepage&amp;q=Wetting%20is%20important%20in%20the%20bonding%20of%20two%20materials&amp;f=false|title=Bio-aggregates Based Building Materials: State-of-the-Art Report of the RILEM Technical Committee 236-BBM|last=Amziane|first=Sofiane|last2=Collet|first2=Florence|date=2017-03-05|publisher=Springer|isbn=9789402410310|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wetting and the surface forces that control wetting are also responsible for other related effects, including [[capillary action|capillary]] effects.

There are two types of wetting: non-reactive wetting and active wetting.&lt;ref&gt;Dezellus, O. and N. Eustathopoulos (2010). "Fundamental issues of reactive wetting by liquid metals." Journal of Materials Science 45(16): 4256-4264.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2013/CP/c3cp51848e#!divAbstract Han Hu, Hai-Feng Ji, and Ying Sun, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 15, (2013) 16557]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==
[[Adhesive]] forces between a [[liquid]] and [[solid]] cause a liquid drop to spread across the surface. [[Cohesion (chemistry)|Cohesive]] forces within the liquid cause the drop to ball up and avoid contact with the surface.

[[File:Surface tension.svg|thumb|350px|Figure 2: Wetting of different fluids: ''A'' shows a [[fluid]] with very little wetting, while ''C'' shows a fluid with more wetting. ''A'' has a large contact angle, and ''C'' has a small contact angle.]]

The [[contact angle]] (θ), as seen in Figure 1, is the angle at which the liquid–vapor interface meets the solid-liquid interface. The contact angle is determined by the balance between adhesive and cohesive forces. As the tendency of a drop to spread out over a flat, solid surface increases, the contact angle decreases. Thus, the contact angle provides an inverse measure of wettability.&lt;ref name="sharfin"&gt;{{cite journal|first = E.|last = Sharfrin|title = Constitutive relations in the wetting of low energy surfaces and the theory of the retraction method of preparing monolayers|journal = The Journal of Physical Chemistry|volume = 64|issue= 5|pages = 519–524|year = 1960|doi = 10.1021/j100834a002|last2 = Zisman|first2 = William A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contact angle less than 90° (low contact angle) usually indicates that wetting of the surface is very favorable, and the fluid will spread over a large area of the surface. Contact angles greater than 90° (high contact angle) generally means that wetting of the surface is unfavorable, so the fluid will minimize contact with the surface and form a compact liquid droplet.
 
For water, a wettable surface may also be termed [[hydrophilic]] and a nonwettable surface [[hydrophobic]]. Superhydrophobic surfaces have contact angles greater than 150°, showing almost no contact between the liquid drop and the surface. This is sometimes referred to as the "[[Lotus effect]]". The table describes varying contact angles and their corresponding solid/liquid and liquid/liquid interactions.&lt;ref name="Eustat"&gt;{{cite book|first = N.| last = Eustathopoulos |author2=Nicholas, M.G. |author3=Drevet B.|title = Wettability at high temperatures|publisher = Pergamon|location = Oxford, UK|year = 1999|isbn = 978-0-08-042146-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; For nonwater liquids, the term lyophilic is used for low contact angle conditions and lyophobic is used when higher contact angles result. Similarly, the terms omniphobic and omniphilic apply to both polar and apolar liquids.

==High-energy vs. low-energy surfaces==

Liquids can interact with two main types of solid surfaces. Traditionally, solid surfaces have been divided into high-[[energy]] solids and low-energy types. The relative energy of a solid has to do with the bulk nature of the solid itself. Solids such as metals, [[glass]]es, and [[ceramic]]s are known as 'hard solids' because the [[chemical bond]]s that hold them together (e.g., covalent, ionic, or metallic) are very strong. Thus, it takes a large input of energy to break these solids (alternatively large amount of energy is required to cut the bulk and make two separate surfaces so high surface energy), so they are termed “high energy”. Most molecular liquids achieve complete wetting with high-energy surfaces.

The other type of solids is weak molecular crystals (e.g., fluorocarbons, hydrocarbons, etc.) where the molecules are held together essentially by physical forces (e.g., van der Waals and hydrogen bonds). Since these solids are held together by weak forces, a very low input of energy is required to break them, thus they are termed “low energy”. Depending on the type of liquid chosen, low-energy surfaces can permit either complete or partial wetting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = M.E| last = Schrader|author2=Loeb, G.I. |title = Modern Approaches to Wettability. Theory and Applications| publisher = Plenum Press|location = New York|year = 1992|isbn = 978-0-306-43985-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="de Gennes"&gt;{{cite journal|first = P.G.|last = de Gennes|title = Wetting: statics and dynamics| journal = Reviews of Modern Physics| volume = 57|issue= 3|pages = 827–863|year = 1985|doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.57.827|bibcode=1985RvMP...57..827D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dynamic surfaces have been reported that undergo changes in [[surface energy]] upon the application of an appropriate stimuli.  For example, a surface presenting photon-driven molecular motors was shown to undergo changes in water contact angle when switched between bistable conformations of differing surface energies.&lt;ref&gt;"Control of Surface Wettability Using Tripodal Light-activated Molecular Motors" Journal of the American Chemical Society, 3 February 2014 {{DOI|10.1021/ja412110t}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low-energy surfaces primarily interact with liquids through dispersion ([[Van der Waals force|van der Waals]]) forces. [[William Zisman]] produced several key findings:&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;

Zisman observed that cos θ increases linearly as the [[surface tension]] (γ&lt;sub&gt;LV&lt;/sub&gt;) of the liquid decreased. Thus, he was able to establish a [[linear function]] between cos θ and the surface tension (γ&lt;sub&gt;LV&lt;/sub&gt;) for various [[organic compound|organic]] liquids.

A surface is more wettable when γ&lt;sub&gt;LV&lt;/sub&gt; and θ is low. Zisman termed the intercept of these lines when cos θ = 1, as the [[critical surface tension]] (γ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) of that surface. This critical surface tension is an important parameter because it is a characteristic of only the solid.

Knowing the critical surface tension of a solid, it is possible to predict the wettability of the surface.&lt;ref name="sharfin"/&gt; 
The wettability of a surface is determined by the outermost chemical groups of the solid.
Differences in wettability between surfaces that are similar in structure are due to differences in the packing of the atoms. For instance, if a surface has branched chains, it will have poorer packing than a surface with straight chains. 
Lower critical surface tension means a less wettable material surface.

==Ideal solid surfaces==
An [[ideal surface]] is flat, rigid, perfectly smooth, and chemically homogeneous, and has zero [[Contact_angle#Contact_Angle_Hysteresis | contact angle hysteresis]]. Zero [[hysteresis]] implies the advancing and receding contact angles are equal. In other words, only one thermodynamically stable contact angle exists. When a drop of liquid is placed on such a surface, the characteristic contact angle is formed as depicted in Fig. 1. Furthermore, on an ideal surface, the drop will return to its original shape if it is disturbed.&lt;ref name="Eustat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;Johnson, Rulon E. (1993) in ''Wettability'' Ed. Berg, John. C. New York, NY: Marcel Dekker, Inc. {{ISBN|0-8247-9046-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following derivations apply only to ideal solid surfaces; they are only valid for the state in which the interfaces are not moving and the phase boundary line exists in equilibrium.

===Minimization of energy, three phases===
[[File:3PhaseCoexistence.svg|thumb|right|Figure 3: Coexistence of three fluid phases in mutual contact; here, α, β, and θ each indicate both a phase and its contact angle.]]
[[File:NeumannTriangle.svg|thumb|Figure 4: Neumann's triangle relating the surface energies and contact angles of three fluid phases coexisting in static equilibrium, as depicted in Figure&amp;nbsp;3]]

Figure 3 shows the line of contact where three phases meet. In [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]], the net [[force]] per unit length acting along the boundary line between the three phases must be zero. The components of net force in the direction along each of the interfaces are given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \gamma_{\alpha\theta}                        + \gamma_{\theta\beta}\cos\left(\theta\right) + \gamma_{\alpha\beta}\cos\left(\alpha\right) &amp;= 0 \\
  \gamma_{\alpha\theta}\cos\left(\theta\right) + \gamma_{\theta\beta}                        + \gamma_{\alpha\beta}\cos\left(\beta\right)  &amp;= 0 \\
  \gamma_{\alpha\theta}\cos\left(\alpha\right) + \gamma_{\theta\beta}\cos\left(\beta\right)  + \gamma_{\alpha\beta}                        &amp;= 0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where α, β, and θ are the angles shown and γ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; is the surface energy between the two indicated phases. These relations can also be expressed by an analog to a triangle known as Neumann’s triangle, shown in Figure 4. Neumann’s triangle is consistent with the geometrical restriction that &lt;math&gt;\alpha + \beta + \theta = 2\pi&lt;/math&gt;, and applying the law of sines and law of cosines to it produce relations that describe how the interfacial angles depend on the ratios of surface energies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = J.S.| last = Rowlinson|author2=Widom, B. |title = Molecular Theory of Capillarity|publisher = Clarendon Press|location = Oxford, UK|year = 1982|isbn = 978-0-19-855642-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because these three surface energies form the sides of a [[triangle]], they are constrained by the triangle inequalities, γ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; γ&lt;sub&gt;jk&lt;/sub&gt; + γ&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt; meaning that not one of the surface tensions can exceed the sum of the other two. If three fluids with surface energies that do not follow these inequalities are brought into contact, no equilibrium configuration consistent with Figure 3 will exist.

====Simplification to planar geometry, Young's relation====
If the β phase is replaced by a flat rigid surface, as shown in Figure 5, then β = π, and the second net force equation simplifies to the Young equation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = T.|last = Young|title = An Essay on the Cohesion of Fluids|journal = [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond.]]|volume = 95|pages = 65–87|year = 1805|doi = 10.1098/rstl.1805.0005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Contact angle.svg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 5: Contact angle of a liquid droplet wetted to a rigid solid surface]]

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{SG} = \gamma_{SL} + \gamma_{LG}\cos\left(\theta\right)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = T. S. Chow|title = Wetting of rough surfaces|year = 1998|journal = [[Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter]]|volume = 10|issue = 27|pages = L445–L451|doi = 10.1088/0953-8984/10/27/001|bibcode = 1998JPCM...10L.445C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

which relates the surface tensions between the three phases: [[solid]], [[liquid]] and [[gas]]. Subsequently, this predicts the contact angle of a liquid [[droplet]] on a solid surface from knowledge of the three surface energies involved. This equation also applies if the "gas" phase is another liquid, [[immiscible]] with the droplet of the first "liquid" phase.

====Non-ideal smooth surfaces and the Young contact angle====
The Young equation assumes a perfectly flat and rigid surface often referred to as an [[ideal surface]]. In many cases, surfaces are far from this ideal situation, and two are considered here: the case of rough surfaces &lt;!-- (see Non-ideal rough solid surfaces) --&gt; and the case of smooth surfaces that are still real (finitely rigid). Even in a perfectly smooth surface, a drop will assume a wide spectrum of contact angles ranging from the so-called advancing contact angle, &lt;math&gt;\theta_\mathrm{A}&lt;/math&gt;, to the so-called receding contact angle, &lt;math&gt;\theta_\mathrm{R}&lt;/math&gt;. The equilibrium contact angle (&lt;math&gt;\theta_\mathrm{c}&lt;/math&gt;) can be calculated from &lt;math&gt;\theta_\mathrm{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta_\mathrm{R}&lt;/math&gt; as was shown by Tadmor&lt;ref name="Tadm"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Line energy and the relation between advancing, receding and Young contact angles|doi=10.1021/la049410h|year=2004|last1=Tadmor|first1=Rafael|journal=Langmuir|volume=20|pmid=15323516|issue=18|pages=7659–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; as,

:&lt;math&gt;\theta_\mathrm{c} = \arccos\left(
  \frac{r_\mathrm{A}\cos\left(\theta_\mathrm{A}\right) + r_\mathrm{R}\cos\left(\theta_\mathrm{R}\right)}
       {r_\mathrm{A} + r_\mathrm{R}}
\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;
  r_\mathrm{A} = \left(
    \frac{\sin^3\left(\theta_\mathrm{A}\right)}{2 - 3\cos\left(\theta_\mathrm{A}\right) + \cos^3\left(\theta_\mathrm{A}\right)}
  \right)^\frac{1}{3}
~;~~
  r_\mathrm{R} = \left(
    \frac{\sin^3\left(\theta_\mathrm{R}\right)}{2 - 3\cos\left(\theta_\mathrm{R}\right) + \cos^3\left(\theta_\mathrm{R}\right)}
  \right)^\frac{1}{3}
&lt;/math&gt;

====The Young–Dupré equation and spreading coefficient====
The Young–Dupré equation (Thomas Young 1805; Anthanase Dupré and Paul Dupré 1869) dictates that neither γ&lt;sub&gt;SG&lt;/sub&gt; nor γ&lt;sub&gt;SL&lt;/sub&gt; can be larger than the sum of the other two surface energies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Young-Dupre Revisited|journal = Langmuir|date = 2002-05-01|pages = 3585–3589|volume = 11|issue = 9|doi = 10.1021/la00009a049|language = EN|first = Malcolm E.|last = Schrader}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Théorie mécanique de la chaleur|url = https://archive.org/details/thoriemcaniqued00duprgoog|publisher = Gauthier-Villars|date = 1869-01-01|language = French|first = Paul Dupré|last = Athanase M. Dupré}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consequence of this restriction is the prediction of complete wetting when γ&lt;sub&gt;SG&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; γ&lt;sub&gt;SL&lt;/sub&gt; + γ&lt;sub&gt;LG&lt;/sub&gt; and zero wetting when γ&lt;sub&gt;SL&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; γ&lt;sub&gt;SG&lt;/sub&gt; + γ&lt;sub&gt;LG&lt;/sub&gt;. The lack of a solution to the Young–Dupré equation is an indicator that there is no equilibrium configuration with a contact angle between 0 and 180° for those situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Contact Angle Spreading Coefficient|first=Carl|last=Clegg|url=http://www.ramehart.com/newsletters/2016-01_news.htm|work=www.ramehart.com|publisher=ramé-hart|date=2016|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A useful parameter for gauging wetting is the ''spreading parameter S'',
:&lt;math&gt;S = \gamma_{SG} - \left(\gamma_{SL} + \gamma_{LG}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

When ''S'' &gt; 0, the liquid wets the surface completely (complete wetting). When ''S'' &lt; 0, partial wetting occurs.

Combining the spreading parameter definition with the Young relation yields the Young–Dupré equation:
:&lt;math&gt;S = \gamma_{LG}\left(\cos\left(\theta\right) - 1\right)&lt;/math&gt;

which only has physical solutions for θ when S &lt; 0.

==Non-ideal rough solid surfaces==

[[File:Cahysteresis(crop).jpg|thumb|left|Figure 6: Schematic of advancing and receding contact angles]]

Unlike ideal surfaces, real surfaces do not have perfect smoothness, rigidity, or chemical homogeneity. Such deviations from ideality result in phenomenon called [[Contact_angle#Contact_Angle_Hysteresis|contact-angle hysteresis]], which is defined as the difference between the advancing (θ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) and receding (θ&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;) contact angles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Robert J. Good|title = Contact angle, wetting, and adhesion: a critical review|year = 1992|journal = J. Adhesion Sci. Technol.|volume = 6|issue = 12|pages = 1269–1302|doi = 10.1163/156856192X00629}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;\text{H} = \,\theta_{a} - \,\theta_{r}&lt;/math&gt;

When the contact angle is between the advancing and receding cases, the contact line is considered to be pinned and hysteretic behaviour can be observed, namely [[Contact_angle#Contact_Angle_Hysteresis| contact angle hysteresis]]. When these values are exceeded, the displacement of the contact line, such as the one in Figure 3, will take place by either expansion or retraction of the droplet &lt;ref name="CAH"&gt; {{cite journal|last1= Shi| first1= Z. | last2=et al. | title= Dynamic contact angle hysteresis in liquid bridges.| journal= Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects  | year=2018 | volume=555  | pages= 365–371|url= https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092777571830606X| doi=10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.07.004| arxiv= 1712.04703 }} &lt;/ref&gt;. Figure 6 depicts the advancing and receding contact angles. The advancing contact angle is the maximum stable angle, whereas the receding contact angle is the minimum stable angle. Contact-angle hysteresis occurs because many different thermodynamically stable contact angles are found on a nonideal solid. These varying thermodynamically stable contact angles are known as metastable states.&lt;ref name = "Johnson"/&gt;

Such motion of a phase boundary, involving advancing and receding contact angles, is known as dynamic wetting. The difference between dynamic and static wetting angles is proportional to the [[Capillary number]], '''&lt;math&gt;Ca&lt;/math&gt;''', When a contact line advances, covering more of the surface with liquid, the contact angle is increased and generally is related to the velocity of the contact line.&lt;ref name="CAH" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = P. G.|last = De Gennes|title = Soft Interfaces|year = 1994|publisher = Cambridge University Press|location = Cambridge, UK|isbn = 978-0-521-56417-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the velocity of a contact line is increased without bound, the contact angle increases, and as it approaches 180°, the gas phase will become entrained in a thin layer between the liquid and solid. This is a kinetic nonequilibrium effect which results from the contact line moving at such a high speed that complete wetting cannot occur.

A well-known departure from ideal conditions is when the surface of interest has a rough texture. The rough texture of a surface can fall into one of two categories: homogeneous or heterogeneous. A homogeneous wetting regime is where the liquid fills in the roughness grooves of a surface. A heterogeneous wetting regime, though,  is where the surface is a composite of two types of patches. An important example of such a composite surface is one composed of patches of both air and solid. Such surfaces have varied effects on the contact angles of wetting liquids. Cassie–Baxter and Wenzel are the two main models that attempt to describe the wetting of textured surfaces. However, these equations only apply when the drop size is sufficiently large compared with the surface roughness scale.&lt;ref name = "abraham"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Abraham Marmur|title = Wetting of Hydrophobic Rough Surfaces: To be heterogeneous or not to be| year = 2003|journal = Langmuir|volume = 19|pages = 8343–8348|doi = 10.1021/la0344682|issue = 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the droplet size is comparable to that of the underlying pillars, the effect of line tension should be considered. .&lt;ref&gt;Xuemei Chen, Ruiyuan Ma, Jintao Li,  Chonglei Hao, Wei Guo, B.L.Luk, Shuaicheng Li, Shuhuai Yao, Zuankai Wang.

===Wenzel's model===
[[File:Wenzel.png|thumb|right|Figure 7: Wenzel model]]
The [[Wenzel model]] (Robert N. Wenzel 1936) describes the homogeneous wetting regime, as seen in Figure 7, and is defined by the following equation for the contact angle on a rough surface:&lt;ref name = "abraham"/&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;\cos\,\left(\theta^*\right) = r \cos\,\left(\theta\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta^*&lt;/math&gt; is the apparent contact angle which corresponds to the stable equilibrium state (i.e. minimum free energy state for the system). The [[roughness ratio]], r, is a measure of how surface roughness affects a homogeneous surface. The roughness ratio is defined as the ratio of true area of the solid surface to the apparent area.

θ is the [[Young contact angle]] as defined for an ideal surface. Although Wenzel's equation demonstrates the contact angle of a rough surface is different from the [[intrinsic]] contact angle, it does not describe contact angle [[Hysteresis#Contact angle hysteresis|hysteresis]].&lt;ref name="marmur"&gt;Marmur, Abraham (1992) in ''Modern Approach to Wettability: Theory and Applications'' Schrader, Malcolm E. and Loeb, George New York: Plenum Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cassie–Baxter model===
[[File:Cassie-Baxter.png|thumb|left|Figure 8: Cassie–Baxter model]]

When dealing with a heterogeneous surface, the Wenzel model is not sufficient. A more complex model is needed to measure how the apparent contact angle changes when various materials are involved. This heterogeneous surface, like that seen in Figure 8, is explained using the Cassie–Baxter equation ([[Cassie's law]]):&lt;ref name="abraham"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\cos\,\left(\theta^*\right) = r_f\,f \,\cos\,\left(\theta_\text{Y}\right) + f - 1&lt;/math&gt;

Here the ''r&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the roughness ratio of the wet surface area and ''f'' is the fraction of solid surface area wet by the liquid. It is important to realize that when ''f'' = 1 and ''r&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; = r'', the Cassie–Baxter equations becomes the Wenzel equation. On the other hand, when there are many different fractions of surface roughness, each fraction of the total surface area is denoted by &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt;.

A summation of all ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' equals 1 or the total surface. Cassie–Baxter can also be recast in the following equation:&lt;ref name=Whyman&gt;{{cite journal|first = G.|last = Whyman| title = The rigirious derivation of Young, Cassie–Baxter and Wenzel equations and the analysis of the contact angle hysteresis phenomenon| journal = Chemical Physics Letters| volume = 450| pages = 355–359|year = 2008|doi = 10.1016/j.cplett.2007.11.033|last2 = Bormashenko|first2 = Edward|last3 = Stein|first3 = Tamir|bibcode = 2008CPL...450..355W|issue = 4–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma\cos\,\left(\theta^*\right) = \sum_{n=1}^N f_i\left(\gamma_\text{i,sv} - \gamma_\text{i,sl}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Here γ is the Cassie–Baxter surface tension between liquid and vapor, the γ&lt;sub&gt;i,sv&lt;/sub&gt; is the solid vapor surface tension of every component and γ&lt;sub&gt;i,sl&lt;/sub&gt; is the solid liquid surface tension of every component. A case that is worth mentioning is when the liquid drop is placed on the substrate and creates small air pockets underneath it. This case for a two-component system is denoted by:&lt;ref name="Whyman"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma\cos\,\left(\theta^*\right) = f_1\left(\gamma_\text{1,sv} - \gamma_\text{1,sl}\right) - \left(1 - f_1\right)\gamma&lt;/math&gt;

Here the key difference to notice is that there is no surface tension between the solid and the vapor for the second surface tension component. This is because of the assumption that the surface of air that is exposed is under the droplet and is the only other substrate in the system. Subsequently, the equation is then expressed as (1 – ''f''). Therefore, the Cassie equation can be easily derived from the Cassie–Baxter equation. Experimental results regarding the surface properties of Wenzel versus Cassie–Baxter systems showed the effect of pinning for a Young angle of 180 to 90°, a region classified under the Cassie–Baxter model. This liquid/air composite system is largely hydrophobic. After that point, a sharp transition to the Wenzel regime was found where the drop wets the surface, but no further than edges of the drop.

====Precursor film====

With the advent of high resolution imaging, researchers have started to obtain experimental data which have led them to question the assumptions of the Cassie–Baxter equation when calculating the apparent contact angle. These groups believe the apparent contact angle is largely dependent on the triple line. The triple line, which is in contact with the heterogeneous surface, cannot rest on the heterogeneous surface like the rest of the drop. In theory, it should follow the surface imperfection. This bending in triple line is unfavorable and is not seen in real-world situations. A theory that preserves the Cassie–Baxter equation while at the same time explaining the presence of minimized energy state of the triple line hinges on the idea of a precursor film. This film of submicrometer thickness advances ahead of the motion of the droplet and is found around the triple line. Furthermore, this precursor film allows the triple line to bend and take different conformations that were originally considered unfavorable. This precursor fluid has been observed using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) in surfaces with pores formed in the bulk. With the introduction of the precursor film concept, the triple line can follow energetically feasible conformations and thereby correctly explaining the Cassie–Baxter model.&lt;ref name=Bormashenko&gt;{{cite journal|first = E.|last = Bormashenko| title = Why does the Cassie–Baxter equation apply?| journal = Colloids and Surface A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects| volume = 324| pages = 47–50|year = 2008|doi = 10.1016/j.colsurfa.2008.13.025|doi-broken-date = 2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Petal lotus.JPG|thumb|350px|right|Figure 9: "Petal effect" vs. "lotus effect"]]
The intrinsic hydrophobicity of a surface can be enhanced by being textured with different length scales of roughness. The red rose takes advantage of this by using a hierarchy of micro- and nanostructures on each petal to provide sufficient roughness for superhydrophobicity. More specifically, each rose petal has a collection of micropapillae on the surface and each papilla, in turn, has many nanofolds. The term “petal effect” describes the fact that a water droplet on the surface of a rose petal is spherical in shape, but cannot roll off even if the petal is turned upside down. The water drops maintain their spherical shape due to the superhydrophobicity of the petal (contact angle of about 152.4°), but do not roll off because the petal surface has a high adhesive force with water.

When comparing the "petal effect" to the "lotus effect", it is important to note some striking differences. The surface structure of the lotus leaf and the rose petal, as seen in Figure 9, can be used to explain the two different effects. The lotus petal has a randomly rough surface and low contact angle hysteresis, which means the water droplet is not able to wet the microstructure spaces between the spikes. This allows air to remain inside the texture, causing a heterogeneous surface composed of both air and solid. As a result, the adhesive force between the water and the solid surface is extremely low, allowing the water to roll off easily (i.e. "self-cleaning" phenomenon).

The rose petal's micro- and nanostructures are larger in scale than those of the lotus leaf, which allows the liquid film to impregnate the texture. However, as seen in Figure 9, the liquid can enter the larger-scale grooves, but it cannot enter into the smaller grooves. This is known as the Cassie impregnating wetting regime. Since the liquid can wet the larger-scale grooves, the adhesive force between the water and solid is very high. This explains why the water droplet will not fall off even if the petal is tilted at an angle or turned upside down. This effect will fail if the droplet has a volume larger than 10 µl because the balance between weight and surface tension is surpassed.&lt;ref&gt;I.

===Cassie–Baxter to Wenzel transition===
[[File:Cassie transition.png|thumb|right|Figure 10: Mushroom state]]
In the [[Cassie's law|Cassie–Baxter model]], the drop sits on top of the textured surface with trapped air underneath. During the [[wetting transition]] from the Cassie state to the Wenzel state, the air pockets are no longer thermodynamically stable and liquid begins to nucleate from the middle of the drop, creating a "mushroom state" as seen in Figure 10.&lt;ref name=Ishino&gt;{{Cite journal|first = C.|last = Ishino|title = Wetting transitions on textured hydrophilic surfaces|journal = European Physical Journal|volume = 25|pages = 415–424|year = 2008|doi = 10.1140/epje/i2007-10308-y|pmid = 18431542|last2 = Okumura|first2 = K|issue = 4|bibcode = 2008EPJE...25..415I }}&lt;/ref&gt; The penetration condition is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\cos\,\left(\theta_\text{C}\right)= \frac{\phi - 1}{r - \phi}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:* ''θ&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the critical contact angle
:* ''Φ'' is the fraction of solid/liquid interface where drop is in contact with surface
:* ''r'' is solid roughness (for flat surface, r = 1)

[[File:Wenzel film.png|thumb|left|Figure 11: Penetration front spreads beyond drop]]

The penetration front propagates to minimize the surface energy until it reaches the edges of the drop, thus arriving at the Wenzel state. Since the solid can be considered an absorptive material due to its surface roughness, this phenomenon of spreading and imbibition is called hemiwicking. The contact angles at which spreading/imbibition occurs are between 0 and π/2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = D.|last = Quere |title = Wetting of Textured Surfaces|journal = Colloids and Surfaces|pages = 41–46|year = 2008|doi=10.1016/S0927-7757(02)00061-4|volume =206|issue =1–3|url=http://www.pmmh.espci.fr/~jbico/bico02b.pdf|last2 = Thiele|first2 = Uwe|last3 = Quéré|first3 = David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wenzel model is valid between θ&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; and π/2. If the contact angle is less than Θ&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;, the penetration front spreads beyond the drop and a liquid film forms over the surface. Figure 11 depicts the transition from the Wenzel state to the surface film state. The film smoothes the surface roughness and the Wenzel model no longer applies. In this state, the equilibrium condition and Young's relation yields:
:&lt;math&gt;\cos\,\left(\theta^*\right) = \phi\cos\,\left(\theta_C\right) + \left(1 - \phi\right)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Ishino"/&gt;

By fine-tuning the surface roughness, it is possible to achieve a transition between both superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic regions. Generally, the rougher the surface, the more hydrophobic it is.

==Spreading dynamics==

If a drop is placed on a smooth, horizontal surface, it is generally not in the equilibrium state. Hence, it spreads until an equilibrium contact radius is reached (partial wetting). While taking into account capillary, gravitational, and viscous contributions, the drop radius as a function of time can be expressed as&lt;ref&gt;Härth M., Schubert D.W., ''Simple Approach for Spreading Dynamics of Polymeric Fluids'', Macromol.

For the complete wetting situation, the drop radius at any time during the spreading process is given by

: &lt;math&gt;r(t) = \left[
    \left(\gamma_{LG} \frac{96\lambda V^4}{\pi^2 \eta} \left(t + t_0\right)\right)^\frac{1}{2} + 
    \left(\frac{\lambda(t + t_0)}{\eta}\right)^\frac{2}{3} \frac{24\rho g V^\frac{3}{8}}{7 \cdot 96^\frac{1}{3} \pi^\frac{4}{3} \gamma_{LG}^\frac{1}{3}}
  \right]^\frac{1}{6}
&lt;/math&gt;

where
:*''γ''&lt;sub&gt;LG&lt;/sub&gt; is [[surface tension]] of the fluid
:*''V'' is drop volume
:*''η'' is [[viscosity]] of the fluid
:*''ρ'' is [[density]] of the fluid
:*''g'' is [[gravitational constant]]
:*''λ'' is shape factor, 37.1{{nbsp}}m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
:*''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is experimental delay time
:*''r''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is drop radius in equilibrium

==Modifying wetting properties==
===Surfactants===
Many technological processes require control of liquid spreading over solid surfaces. When a drop is placed on a surface, it can completely wet, partially wet, or not wet the surface. By reducing the surface tension with [[surfactants]], a nonwetting material can be made to become partially or completely wetting. The excess free energy (σ) of a drop on a solid surface is:&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \gamma S + PV + \pi\,R^2 \left(\gamma_\text{SL} - \gamma_\text{SV}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:* ''γ'' is the liquid–vapor interfacial tension
:* γ&lt;sub&gt;SL&lt;/sub&gt; is the solid–liquid interfacial tension
:* γ&lt;sub&gt;SV&lt;/sub&gt; is the solid–vapor interfacial tension
:* ''S'' is the area of liquid–vapor interface
:* ''P'' is the excess pressure inside liquid
:* ''R'' is the radius of droplet base

Based on this equation, the excess free energy is minimized when γ decreases, γ&lt;sub&gt;SL&lt;/sub&gt; decreases, or γ&lt;sub&gt;SV&lt;/sub&gt; increases. Surfactants are absorbed onto the liquid–vapor, solid–liquid, and solid–vapor interfaces, which modify the wetting behavior of hydrophobic materials to reduce the free energy. When surfactants are absorbed onto a hydrophobic surface, the polar head groups face into the solution with the tail pointing outward. In more hydrophobic surfaces, surfactants may form a bilayer on the solid, causing it to become more hydrophilic. The dynamic drop radius can be characterized as the drop begins to spread. Thus, the contact angle changes based on the following equation:&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite journal|first1 = K. S.|last1 = Lee|title = Kinetics of wetting and spreading by aqueous surfactant solutions|year = 2008|journal = Advances in Colloid and Interface Science|pages = 54–65|doi = 10.1016/j.cis.2008.08.005|volume = 144|pmid = 18834966|last2 = Ivanova|first2 = N.|last3 = Starov|first3 = V. M.|last4 = Hilal|first4 = N.|last5 = Dutschk|first5 = V.|issue = 1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos\,\left(\theta(t)\right) = \cos\,\left(\theta_0\right) + \left(\cos\,\left(\theta_\infty\right) - \cos\,\left(\theta_0\right)\right)\left(1 - \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{t}{\tau}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:* ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is initial contact angle
:* ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; is final contact angle
:* ''τ'' is the surfactant transfer time scale

As the surfactants are absorbed, the solid–vapor surface tension increases and the edges of the drop become hydrophilic. As a result, the drop spreads.
