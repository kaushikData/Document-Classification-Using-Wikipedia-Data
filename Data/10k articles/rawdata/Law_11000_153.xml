==Birthplace==
According to government records, Fujimori was born on 28 July 1938, in [[Miraflores District, Lima|Miraflores]], a district of [[Lima]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Champion|first=Margaret Y.|title=Peru and the Peruvians in the Twentieth Century: Politics and Prospects |year= 2006|publisher=Vantage Press|location=New York|page=476|isbn=0-533-15159-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents, Naoichi Fujimori (original surname ''Minami'', adopted by a childless relative; 1897–1971) and Mutsue Inomoto Fujimori (1913–2009), were natives of [[Kumamoto, Kumamoto|Kumamoto]], Japan, who migrated to Peru in 1934.&lt;ref name= "McClintockVallas50"&gt;{{Cite book |last=McClintock |first=Cynthia |author2=Fabián Vallas |title=The United States and Peru |year=2002 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=New York |page=50 |isbn=0-415-93463-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=González Manrique |first= Luis Esteban|title=La encrucijada peruana: de Alan García a Fujimori|year=1993|publisher=Fundación CEDEAL|location= Madrid |page= 467|isbn=84-87258-38-7|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1997, the news magazine ''[[Caretas]]'' alleged that Fujimori had actually been born in Japan, in his father's hometown of [[Kawachi, Kumamoto|Kawachi]], [[Kumamoto Prefecture]].&lt;ref name="Caretas"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Valenzuela|first=Cecilia|title=Buscando La Cuna De Fujimori|url=http://www.caretas.com.pe/1475/fujimori/fujimori.htm |work=[[Caretas]]|year=1997|issue=1475|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Peru's constitution requires the president to have been born in Peru, this would have made Fujimori ineligible to be president.&lt;ref name="McClintockVallas50"/&gt; The magazine, which had been sued for libel by [[Vladimiro Montesinos]] seven years earlier,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Dartnell|first=Michael York|title=Insurgency Online: Web Activism and Global Conflict|year=2006|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|location=Toronto|page=77|isbn=0-8020-8747-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that Fujimori's birth and baptismal certificates might have been altered.&lt;ref name="Caretas"/&gt; ''Caretas'' also alleged that Fujimori's mother declared having two children when she entered Peru;&lt;ref name="Caretas"/&gt; Fujimori is the second of four children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last= |first= |title=Fujimori's documents raise fresh controversy |url=http://www.expressindia.com/ie/daily/19970727/20850523.html |work=[[Associated Press]] |date=27 July 1997 |accessdate=7 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108231520/http://www.expressindia.com/ie/daily/19970727/20850523.html |archivedate=8 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Caretas''{{'}} contentions were hotly contested in the Peruvian media; the magazine ''Sí'', for instance, described the allegations as "pathetic" and "a dark page for [Peruvian] journalism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Waisbord|first=Silvio Ricardo|title=Watchdog Journalism in South America|year=2000|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|location=New York|page=83|isbn=0-231-11975-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latin American scholars [[Cynthia McClintock]] and Fabián Vallas note that the issue appeared to have died down among Peruvians after the Japanese government announced in 2000 that "Fujimori's parents had registered his birth in the Japanese consulate in Lima".&lt;ref name="McClintockVallas50"/&gt;

==Early years==
Fujimori obtained his early education at the Colegio Nuestra Señora de la Merced&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Prieto Celi|first=Federico|title=Rescate en Lima|year=1997|publisher=Realidades S.A|location=Lima|isbn=|oclc=37997948|page=32|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; and La Rectora.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Jochamowitz|first=Luis|title=Ciudadano Fujimori: la construcción de un político|year = 1994 |edition=2nd|publisher=PEISA|location=Lima|isbn=|oclc=31847656|page=87|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fujimori's parents were Buddhists, but he was baptised and raised as a Roman Catholic. While he spoke mainly Japanese at home, Fujimori also learned to become a proficient Spanish speaker during his years at school.&lt;ref&gt;H.W. Wilson Company (1996), p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, Fujimori graduated from La gran unidad escolar Alfonso Ugarte in Lima.&lt;ref&gt;Jochamowitz, p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt;

He went on to undergraduate studies at the [[La Molina National Agrarian University|Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina]] in 1957, graduating in 1961 first in his class as an [[Agricultural engineering|agricultural engineer]]. The following year he lectured on [[mathematics]] at the university. In 1964 he went to study [[physics]] at the [[University of Strasbourg]] in France. On a Ford scholarship, Fujimori also attended the [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.rochester.edu/undergraduate/sums/aftermath/famouspeople.html Famous people major in Mathematics], University of Rochester website. Retrieved on 30 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; in the United States, where he obtained his master's degree in mathematics in 1969. 

In 1974, he married [[Susana Higuchi]], also Japanese-Peruvian. They had four children, including a daughter, [[Keiko Fujimori|Keiko]], and a son, [[Kenji Fujimori|Kenji]], who would later follow their father into politics. 

In recognition of his academic achievements, the sciences faculty of the Universidad Nacional Agraria offered Fujimori the [[Dean (education)|deanship]] and in 1984 appointed him to the [[Rector (academia)|rector]]ship of the university, which he held until 1989. In 1987, Fujimori also became president of the National Commission of Peruvian University Rectors (Asamblea Nacional de Rectores), a position which he has held twice. He also hosted a TV show called ''"Concertando"'' from 1988 to 1989, on Peru's state-owned network, [[TV Perú|Channel 7]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alberto-Fujimori|title=Alberto Fujimori|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|date=27 December 2017|accessdate=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fujimori won the 1990 presidential election as a [[dark horse]] candidate under the banner of  [[Cambio 90]] ("cambio" means "change") beating world-renowned writer [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] in a surprising upset. He capitalized on profound disenchantment with outgoing president [[Alan García]] and the [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance]] party (APRA).

During the campaign, Fujimori was nicknamed ''El Chino'', which roughly translates to "[[Chinaman (term)|Chinaman]]"; it is common for people of any East Asian descent to be called ''chino'' in Peru, as elsewhere in Latin America, both derogatively and affectionately. Although he is of Japanese heritage, Fujimori has suggested that he was always gladdened by the term, which he perceived as a term of affection.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Fujimori, in Ellen Perry's ''The Fall of Fujimori''&lt;/ref&gt; With his election victory, he became just the second person of [[East Asia]]n descent to become [[head of government]] of a Latin American nation, after [[Fulgencio Batista]] of Cuba and the third of East Asian descent to govern a South American state, after [[Arthur Chung]] of [[Guyana]] and [[Henk Chin A Sen]] of [[Suriname]] (each of whom had served as [[head of state]], rather than head of government).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mMY4-ffumwUC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;lpg=PA213&amp;dq=fujimori+%22Arthur+Chung%22+%22Henk+Chin+A+Sen+%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BY2VdGPRv6&amp;sig=6t6zbibMxRX2jS8ZcFnov9Bzr0E&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjmvc2EhqvYAhUI9IMKHSbLDLsQ6AEIOzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=fujimori%20%22Arthur%20Chung%22%20%22Henk%20Chin%20A%20Sen%20%22&amp;f=false|title=The Affinity of the Eye: Writing Nikkei in Peru|author=Ignacio López-Calvo|date=2013|accessdate=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First term==

===Fujishock===
During his first term in office, Fujimori enacted wide-ranging neoliberal reforms, known as Fujishock. During the presidency of [[Alan García]], the economy had entered a period of [[hyperinflation]] and the political system was in crisis due to the country's internal conflict, leaving Peru in "economic and political chaos".&lt;ref name=lp&gt;Benson, Sara and Hellander, Paul and Wlodarski, Rafael. ''[[Lonely Planet]]: Peru''. 2007, pages 37–8.&lt;/ref&gt; It was Fujimori's stated objective to pacify the nation and restore economic balance. This program bore little resemblance to his campaign platform and was in fact more drastic than anything Vargas Llosa had proposed.&lt;ref name=gouge3&gt;Gouge, Thomas. ''Exodus from Capitalism: The End of Inflation and Debt''. 2003, page 363.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the ''Fujishock'' succeeded in restoring Peru to the global economy, though not without immediate social cost.&lt;ref name=manz&gt;Manzetti, Luigi. ''Privatization South American Style''. 1999, page 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fujimori's initiative relaxed [[private sector]] [[price controls]], drastically reduced government [[subsidies]] and government employment, eliminated all [[exchange controls]], and also reduced restrictions on investment, imports, and [[capital (economics)|capital]].&lt;ref name=manz /&gt; [[Tariff]]s were radically simplified, the [[minimum wage]] was immediately quadrupled, and the government established a $400 million poverty relief fund.&lt;ref name=manz /&gt; The latter seemed to anticipate the economic agony to come: the price of electricity quintupled, water prices rose eightfold, and gasoline [[price]]s 3,000%.&lt;ref name=gouge3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=manz /&gt;

However, many do not attribute the Fujishock to Fujimori. In the 1980s, the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] created a plan for South American economies called the [[Washington Consensus]]. The document, written by [[John Williamson (economist)|John Williamson]] in 1990, consists of ten measures that would lead to a healthy economic policy. Under pressure from the [[International Monetary Fund]]  (IMF), the Peruvian government was to follow the guidelines set by the international finance community. The ten points were:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iie.com/publications/papers/williamson0904-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

# Fiscal discipline
# Reordering of public expenditure
# Tax reform (Broadening)
# Liberalization of interest rates
# Competitive exchange rate
# Trade liberalization
# Liberalization of foreign direct investment
# Privatization
# Deregulation of barrier entry and exit, safety regulations, and governed prices
# Property rights for the informal sector

The IMF was content with Peru's measures, and guaranteed loan funding for Peru.&lt;ref name=gouge&gt;Gouge, Thomas. ''Exodus from Capitalism: The End of Inflation and Debt''. 2003, page 364.&lt;/ref&gt; Inflation rapidly began to fall and foreign investment capital flooded in.&lt;ref name=gouge /&gt; The [[privatization]] campaign involved selling off of hundreds of state-owned enterprises, and replacing the country's troubled currency, the [[Peruvian inti|inti]], with the [[Peruvian nuevo sol|Nuevo Sol]].&lt;ref name=lp /&gt; The ''Fujishock'' restored [[macroeconomic]] stability to the economy and triggered a considerable long-term economic upturn in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name=cs&gt;Carol Stokes, Susan. ''Public Support for Market Reforms in New Democracies''. 2001, page 163.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the Peruvian economy grew at a rate of 13%, faster than any other economy in the world.&lt;ref name=cs /&gt;

===Constitutional crisis===
{{Main|1992 Peruvian constitutional crisis}}

During Fujimori's first term in office, APRA and Vargas Llosa's party, the [[Democratic Front (Peru)|FREDEMO]], remained in control of both chambers of Congress, the [[Congress of the Republic of Peru|Chamber of Deputies]] and the [[Congress of the Republic of Peru|Senate]], hampering the enactment of economic reform. Fujimori also had difficulty combatting the [[Maoism|Maoist]] [[Shining Path]] ({{lang-es|Sendero Luminoso}}) guerrilla organization due largely to what he perceived as intransigence and obstructionism in Congress. By March 1992, Congress met with the approval of only 17% of the electorate, according to one poll; the president's approval rate stood at 42%, in the same poll.&lt;ref name=smith234&gt;Smith, Peter H. ''Latin America in Comparative Perspective: New Approaches to Methods and Analysis''. 1995, page 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the [[1992 Peruvian constitutional crisis|political deadlock]], Fujimori, with the support of the military, on 5 April 1992, carried out a [[self-coup|presidential coup]].&lt;ref&gt;

The coup was welcomed by the public, according to numerous polls.&lt;ref name=smith236&gt;Smith, Peter H. ''Latin America in Comparative Perspective: New Approaches to Methods and Analysis''. 1995, page 236.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only was the coup itself marked by favorable public opinion in several independent polls, but also public approval of the Fujimori administration jumped significantly in the wake of the coup.&lt;ref name=smith236 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Levitt&gt;

Fujimori's coup was immediately met with near-unanimous condemnation from the international community.&lt;ref name=smith236 /&gt; The [[Organization of American States]] denounced the coup and demanded a return to "[[representative democracy]]",&lt;ref name= smith238&gt;Smith, Peter H.

{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations between the OAS, the government, and opposition groups led Albert Fujimori initially to propose a referendum to ratify the auto-coup, but the OAS rejected this. Fujimori then proposed scheduling elections for a Democratic Constituent Congress (CCD), which would draft a new constitution to be ratified by a national referendum. Despite a lack of consensus among political forces in Peru regarding this proposal, an ''ad hoc'' OAS meeting of ministers nevertheless endorsed this scenario in mid-May. Elections for the CCD were held 22 November 1992.&lt;ref name=Levitt /&gt;

Various states individually condemned the coup. [[Venezuela]] broke off diplomatic relations, and [[Argentina]] withdrew its ambassador. [[Chile]] joined [[Argentina]] in requesting Peru's suspension from the [[Organization of American States]]. International lenders delayed planned or projected loans, and the United States, Germany and Spain suspended all non-humanitarian aid to Peru. The coup appeared to threaten the reinsertion strategy for economic recovery, and complicated the process of clearing Peru's arrears with the [[International Monetary Fund]].

Peruvian–U.S. relations earlier in Fujimori's presidency had been dominated by questions of [[coca eradication]] and Fujimori's initial reluctance to sign an accord to increase his military's eradication efforts in the lowlands. Fujimori's ''autogolpe'' became a major obstacle to relations, as the United States immediately suspended all military and economic aid, with exceptions for counter-narcotic and humanitarian funds.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks after the self-coup, however, the [[George H. W. Bush|George H.W.

===Post-coup period===
With FREDEMO dissolved and APRA leader [[Alan García]] exiled to [[Colombia]], Fujimori sought to legitimize his position. He called elections for a [[Democratic Constitutional Congress]], to serve as a legislature and a [[constituent assembly]]. The [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance|APRA]] and [[Popular Action (Peru)|Popular Action]] attempted a boycott of this election, but the Popular Christian Party (PPC, not to be confused with PCP, Partido Comunista del Peru) and many left-leaning parties participated in this election. Fujimori supporters won a majority of the seats in this body, and drafted a [[Constitution of Peru|new constitution]] in 1993. In a [[Peruvian constitutional referendum, 1993|referendum]], the coup and the Constitution of 1993 were approved by a narrow margin of less than five percent.&lt;ref name=DD&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=pe011993 Peru, 31 October 1993: Constitution] Direct Democracy {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the year, on 13 November, General [[Jaime Salinas]] led a failed military coup. Salinas asserted that his intentions were to turn Fujimori over to be tried for violating the Peruvian constitution.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1994, Fujimori separated from his wife [[Susana Higuchi]] in a noisy, public divorce. He formally stripped her of the title [[First Lady]] in August 1994, appointing their eldest daughter First Lady in her stead. Higuchi publicly denounced Fujimori as a "tyrant" and claimed that his administration was corrupt. They formally divorced in 1995.

In Fujimori's first term of office, over 3,000 Peruvians were killed in political murders.&lt;ref name="FTWD2" /&gt;{{context needed|Those may be refering to the terrorist killed.}}

==Second term==
The 1993 Constitution allowed Fujimori to run for a second term, and in April 1995, at the height of his popularity, Fujimori easily won reelection with almost two-thirds of the vote. His major opponent, former [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]], won only 22 percent of the vote. Fujimori's supporters won comfortable majorities in the legislature. One of the first acts of the new congress was to declare an amnesty for all members of the [[Peruvian military]] or [[Law enforcement in Peru|police]] accused or convicted of human rights abuses between 1980 and 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lum.cultura.pe/cdi/documento/fujimori-signs-amnesty-law-fujimori-firma-ley-de-amnist%C3%ADa|title=Fujimori signs amnesty law|publisher=Peruvian Ministry of Culture|accessdate=2017-12-27|author=National Security Archive|date=15 June 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During his second term, Fujimori along with [[President of Ecuador|Ecuadorian President]] [[Sixto Durán Ballén]], signed a peace agreement with [[Ecuador]] over a [[History of the Ecuadorian–Peruvian territorial dispute|border dispute]] that had simmered for more than a century. The treaty allowed the two countries to obtain international funds for developing the border region. Fujimori also settled some issues with Chile, Peru's southern neighbor, which had been unresolved since the 1929 [[Treaty of Lima (1929)|Treaty of Lima]].&lt;ref&gt;Dominguez, Jorge ''et al.'' (2003) ''Boundary Disputes in Latin America'' [[United States Institute of Peace]], Washington, D.C., [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?u=1&amp;num=33&amp;seq=3&amp;view=image&amp;size=100&amp;id=mdp.39015052976985 page 33], {{OCLC|53067610}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1995 election was the turning point in Fujimori's career. Peruvians began to be more concerned about freedom of speech and the press. However, before he was sworn in for a second term, Fujimori stripped two universities of their autonomy and reshuffled the national electoral board. This led his opponents to call him "Chinochet," a reference to his previous nickname and to [[Chile]]an ruler [[Augusto Pinochet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The World Today Series: Latin America 2010 |last=Buckman |first=Robert T. |year=2010 |publisher=Stryker-Post Publications |location=[[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia]] |isbn=978-1-935264-12-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modleing his rule after Pinochet Fujimori reportedly enjoyed this nickname.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=May 2, 2014 |title=Periodista peruano: A Fujimori le gustaba que lo llamaran "Chinochet" |url=https://www.cooperativa.cl/noticias/mundo/peru/alberto-fujimori/periodista-peruano-a-fujimori-le-gustaba-que-lo-llamaran-chinochet/2014-05-02/192054.html |work=[[Radio Cooperativa|Cooperativa]]|language=Spanish |location= |access-date=November 30, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to a poll by the Peruvian Research and Marketing Company conducted in 1997, 40.6% of Lima residents considered President Fujimori an authoritarian.&lt;ref&gt;Cathleen Caron, [http://www.wcl.american.edu/hrbrief/06/1peru.cfm Judiciary Firmly Under Control in Fujimori's Peru] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207051241/http://www.wcl.american.edu/hrbrief/06/1peru.cfm |date=7 February 2012 }}, ''[[Human Rights Brief]]'', Volume 6 Issue 1 (1999). p.9 ''et. seq.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Atwood, 'Democratic Dictators: Authoritarian Politics in Peru from Leguia to Fujimori,' ''[[SAIS Review]]'', vol. 21, no. 2 (2001), p. 167.{{ doi|10.1353/sais.2001.0030}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Weyland, 'Neopopulism and Neoliberalism in Latin America: Unexpected Affinities,' ''[[Studies in Comparative International Development]]'', vol. 31, no. 3 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the fate of democracy under Fujimori, Peruvians were becoming increasingly interested in the myriad allegations of criminality that involved Fujimori and his chief of the [[National Intelligence Service (Peru)|National Intelligence Service (SIN)]], [[Vladimiro Montesinos]]. Using SIN, Fujimori gained control of the majority of the armed forces, with ''[[Financial Times]]'' stating that "[i]n no other country in Latin America did a president have so much control over the armed forces".&lt;ref name="FTWD2"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Financial Times]] World Desk Reference|last1=Heritage|first1=Andrew|date=December 2002|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=|isbn=9780789488053|location=|pages=462-465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 report by Health Minister {{Interlanguage link multi|Fernando Carbone|es|3=Fernando Carbone Campoverde}} later suggested that Fujimori was involved in the [[Compulsory sterilization#Peru|forced sterilizations]] of up to 300,000 indigenous women between 1996 and 2000, as part of a population control program.&lt;ref name="Sterilization" /&gt; A 2004 [[World Bank]] publication said that in this period Montesinos' abuse of the power Fujimori granted him "led to a steady and systematic undermining of the rule of law".&lt;ref&gt;"State Society Interactions as Sources of Persistence and Change in Inequality" in ''Inequality in Latin America: Breaking With History?''

==Third term==
{{BLP sources section|date=July 2013}}
{{Main|Peruvian national election, 2000}}

The 1993 constitution limited a presidency to two terms. Shortly after Fujimori began his second term, his supporters in Congress passed a law of "authentic interpretation" which effectively allowed him to run for another term in 2000. A 1998 effort to repeal this law by referendum failed.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1999, Fujimori announced that he would run for a third term. Peruvian electoral bodies, which were politically sympathetic to Fujimori, accepted his argument that the two-term restriction did not apply to him, as it was enacted while he was already in office.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Krauss, [https://www.nytimes.com/library/world/americas/122899peru-fujimori.html Peru's Chief to Seek 3rd Term, Capping a Long Legal Battle], 'New York Times'', 28 December 1999. Retrieved 26 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Exit polls showed Fujimori fell short of the 50% required to avoid an electoral runoff, but the first official results showed him with 49.6% of the vote, just short of outright victory. Eventually, Fujimori was credited with 49.89%—20,000 votes short of avoiding a runoff. Despite reports of numerous irregularities, the international observers recognized an adjusted victory of Fujimori. His primary opponent, [[Alejandro Toledo]], called for his supporters to spoil their ballots in the runoff by writing "No to fraud!" on them (voting is mandatory in Peru). International observers pulled out of the country after Fujimori refused to delay the runoff.

In the runoff, Fujimori won with 51.1% of the total votes. While votes for Toledo declined from 37.0% of the total votes cast in the first round to 17.7% of the votes in the second round, invalid votes jumped from 8.1% of the total votes cast in the first round to 31.1% of total votes in the second round.&lt;ref name=N1&gt;{{cite book

Although Fujimori won the runoff with only a bare majority, rumors of irregularities led most of the international community to shun his third swearing-in on 28 July. For the next seven weeks, there were daily demonstrations in front of the presidential palace. As a conciliatory gesture, Fujimori appointed former opposition candidate [[Federico Salas]] as prime minister. However, opposition parties in Parliament refused to support this move, and Toledo campaigned vigorously to have the election annulled. At this point, a corruption scandal involving [[Vladimiro Montesinos]] broke out, and exploded into full force on the evening of 14 September 2000, when the cable television station [[Canal N]] broadcast footage of Montesinos apparently bribing opposition congressman Alberto Kouri for defecting to Fujimori's ''Perú 2000'' party. The video was presented by [[Fernando Olivera]], leader of the FIM (Independent Moralizing Front), who purchased it from one of Montesinos's closest allies{{who|date=June 2016}} (nicknamed by the Peruvian press ''El Patriota'').

Fujimori's support virtually collapsed, and a few days later he announced in a nationwide address that he would shut down the SIN and call new elections, in which he would not be a candidate. On 10 November, Fujimori won approval from Congress to hold elections on 8 April 2001. On 13 November, Fujimori left Peru for a visit to [[Brunei]] to attend the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] forum. On 16 November, [[Valentín Paniagua]] took over as president of Congress after the pro-Fujimori leadership lost a vote of confidence. On 17 November, Fujimori traveled from Brunei to Tokyo, where he submitted his presidential [[resignation]] via fax. Congress refused to accept his resignation, instead voting 62–9 to remove Fujimori from office on the grounds that he was "permanently morally disabled."

On 19 November, government ministers presented their resignations en bloc. Because Fujimori's first vice president, [[Francisco Tudela]], had broken with Fujimori and resigned a few days earlier, his successor Ricardo Márquez came to claim the presidency. Congress, however, refused to recognize him, as he was an ardent Fujimori loyalist; Márquez resigned two days later. Paniagua was next in line, and became interim president to oversee the April elections.

==Terrorism==

{{Main|Internal conflict in Peru}}
{{See also|Tarata bombing|Japanese embassy hostage crisis}}
When Fujimori came to power, much of Peru was dominated by the [[Maoism|Maoist]] insurgent group Sendero Luminoso ("[[Shining Path]]"), and the [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] group [[Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]] (MRTA). In 1989, 25% of Peru's district and provincial councils opted not to hold elections, owing to a persistent campaign of assassination, over the course of which over 100 officials had been killed by the Shining Path in that year alone. That same year, more than one-third of Peru's courts lacked a justice of the peace, because of Shining Path intimidation. Union leaders and military officials were also assassinated throughout the 1980s.&lt;ref name= "Freeman"&gt;Freeman, Michael. ''Freedom Or Security: The Consequences for Democracies Using Emergency Powers''. 2003, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zonas donde se ha registrado actividad de Sendero Luminoso.png|thumb|right|200px|Areas where Shining Path was active in Peru.]]

By the early 1990s, some parts of the country were under the control of the insurgents, in territories known as "zonas liberadas" ("liberated zones"), where inhabitants lived under the rule of these groups and paid them taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Michael. ''Freedom Or Security: The Consequences for Democracies Using Emergency Powers''. 2003, page 148.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Shining Path arrived in Lima, it organized "paros armados" ("armed strikes"), which were enforced by killings and other forms of violence. The leadership of the Shining Path was largely university students and teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Michael. ''Freedom Or Security: The Consequences for Democracies Using Emergency Powers''. 2003, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Two previous governments, those of [[Fernando Belaúnde Terry]] and [[Alan García]], at first neglected the threat posed by the Shining Path, then launched an unsuccessful military campaign to eradicate it, undermining public faith in the state and precipitating an exodus of elites.&lt;ref&gt;"By the time Fujimori was elected you had a population in the cities, and particularly in [[Lima]], that was living in fear."

By 1992, Shining Path guerrilla attacks had claimed an estimated 20,000 lives over preceding 12 years. On 16 July 1992 the [[Tarata bombing|Tarata Bombing]], in which several car bombs exploded in Lima's wealthiest district, killed over 40 people; the bombings were characterized by one commentator as an "offensive to challenge President Albert Fujimori."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/18/world/car-bomb-blasts-in-peru-kill-18-and-hurt-140-in-wealthy-sector.html Car-Bomb Blasts in Peru Kill 18 And Hurt 140 in Wealthy Sector] 18 July 1992&lt;/ref&gt; The bombing at Tarata was followed up with a "weeklong wave of car bombings ... Bombs hit banks, hotels, schools, restaurants, police stations and shops ... [G]uerrillas bombed two rail bridges from the [[Andes]], cutting off some of Peru's largest copper mines from coastal ports."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/23/world/peruvian-guerrillas-test-government-with-bombs.html Peruvian Guerrillas Test Government With Bombs] 23 July 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Fujimori has been credited by many Peruvians with ending the fifteen-year reign of terror of the Shining Path. As part of his anti-insurgency efforts, Fujimori granted the military broad powers to arrest suspected insurgents and try them in secret military courts with few legal rights. This measure has often been criticized for compromising the fundamental democratic and human right to an open trial wherein the accused faces the accuser. Fujimori contended that these measures were both justified and also necessary. Members of the judiciary were too afraid to charge the alleged insurgents, and judges and prosecutors had very legitimate fears of reprisals against them or their families.&lt;ref&gt;Fujimori advances this argument in [[Ellen Perry]]'s documentary film, ''[[The Fall of Fujimori]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Fujimori's government armed rural Peruvians, organizing them into groups known as "[[Ronda Campesina|rondas campesinas]]" ("peasant patrols").

Insurgent activity was in decline by the end of 1992,&lt;ref&gt;Stern, Steve J. ''Shining and Other Paths: War and Society in Peru, 1980–1995''. 1998, page 307.&lt;/ref&gt; and Fujimori took credit for this abatement, claiming that his campaign had largely eliminated the insurgent threat. After the 1992 auto-coup, the intelligence work of the [[DIRCOTE|DINCOTE]] (National Counter-Terrorism Directorate) led to the capture of the leaders from MRTA and the Shining Path, including notorious Shining Path leader [[Abimael Guzmán]]. Guzmán's capture was a political coup for Fujimori, who used it to great effect in the press; in an interview with documentarian [[Ellen Perry]], Fujimori even notes that he specially ordered Guzmán's prison jumpsuit to be white with black stripes, to enhance the image of his capture in the media.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Perry's ''The Fall of Fujimori''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics charge that to achieve the defeat of the Shining Path, the Peruvian military engaged in widespread [[human rights]] abuses, and that the majority of the victims were poor highland countryside inhabitants caught in a crossfire between the military and insurgents. The final report of the Peruvian [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Peru)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]], published on 28 August 2003, brought out that Peruvian armed forces were also guilty of destroying villages and murdering countryside inhabitants whom they suspected of supporting insurgents. The majority of the atrocities committed between 1980 and 1995, however, were indeed the work of the Shining Path.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The [[Japanese embassy hostage crisis]] began on 17 December 1996, when fourteen [[Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement|MRTA]] militants seized the residence of the Japanese ambassador in Lima during a party, taking hostage some four hundred diplomats, government officials, and other dignitaries. The action was partly in protest of prison conditions in Peru. During the four-month standoff, the ''Emerretistas'' gradually freed all but 72 of their hostages. The government rejected the militants' demand to release imprisoned MRTA members and secretly prepared an elaborate plan to storm the residence, while stalling by negotiating with the hostage-takers.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, Paul. ''The Lima Embassy Siege and Latin American Terrorism''. 2006, page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 April 1997, a team of military [[commando]]s, codenamed "[[Chavín de Huantar (military)|Chavín de Huantar]]", raided the building. One hostage, two military commandos, and all 14 MRTA insurgents were killed in the operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livinginperu.com/blogs/features/234 Japanese embassy hostage crisis in Peru started 10 years ago] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106011927/http://www.livinginperu.com/blogs/features/234 |date=6 January 2007 }} 18 December 2006.

==Accusations of human rights abuses==
{{See also|Barrios Altos massacre|La Cantuta massacre|Operation Chavín de Huántar}}
Several organizations criticized Fujimori's methods against the [[Shining Path]] and the [[Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement|MRTA]]. [[Amnesty International]] said "the widespread and systematic nature of human rights violations committed during the government of former head of state Albert Fujimori (1990–2000) in Peru constitute crimes against humanity under international law."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kintera.org/site/c.luLVJ8MRKrH/b.1419663/k.BE3C/Home.htm Bring Former President Fujimori to Justice], Amnesty International. Retrieved 26 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Fujimori's alleged association with [[death squad]]s is currently{{when|date=October 2018}} being studied by the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]], after the court accepted the case of "Cantuta vs Perú".{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The 1991 [[Barrios Altos massacre]] by members of the death squad ''[[Grupo Colina]]'', made up solely of members of the [[Military of Peru|Peruvian armed forces]], was one of the crimes that Peru cited in its request to Japan for his extradition in 2003.

From 1996 to 2000, the Fujimori government oversaw a massive forced sterilization campaign known as Voluntary Surgical Contraception. [[United Nations|The United Nations]] and other international aid agencies supported this campaign. USAID provided funding and training until it was exposed by objections by churches and human rights groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insightnewstv.com/d68/ Insight News TV | Peru: Fujimori's Forced Sterilization Campaign&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106001745/http://www.insightnewstv.com/d68/ |date=6 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nippon Foundation]], headed by [[Ayako Sono]], a Japanese novelist and personal friend of Fujimori, supported as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=20466 Catholic World News Enough Evidence to Extradite? 27 September 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://zenit.org/article-2233?l=english Peru Plans a Hot Line to Battle Forced-Sterilizations] The {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118210937/http://zenit.org/article-2233?l=english |date=18 January 2009 }} ZENET LIMA, Peru, 2 September 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Over 215,000  people, mostly women, entirely [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]], were forced or threatened into sterilization during these years, most of them without a proper anaesthetist.&lt;ref name="Sterilization" /&gt;

The success of the military operation in the [[Japanese embassy hostage crisis]] was tainted by subsequent allegations that at least three and possibly eight of the insurgents were summarily executed by the commandos after surrendering. In 2002, the case was taken up by public prosecutors, but the [[Peruvian Supreme Court]] ruled that the military tribunals had jurisdiction. A military court later absolved them of guilt, and the "[[Chavín de Huantar]]" soldiers led the 2004 military parade. In response, in 2003 MRTA family members lodged a complaint with the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] (IACHR) accusing the Peruvian state of human rights violations, namely that the MRTA insurgents had been denied the "right to life, the right to judicial guarantees and the right to judicial protection". The IACHR accepted the case and is currently{{when|date=June 2016}} studying it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cidh.org/annualrep/2004eng/Peru.136.03.eng.htm Report Nº 13/04, Petition 136/03, Admissibility, Eduardo Nicolas Cruz Sanchez et al., Peru, 27 February 2004], on the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] (IACHR) site.

==Resignation, arrest, and trial==
{{Main|Alberto Fujimori's arrest and trial}}Alberto Fujimori left Peru in November 2000 to attend a regional summit in Brunei.  He then traveled on to Japan.  Once there, he announced plans to remain in the country and faxed his resignation letter to Congress.

After Congress rejected Fujimori's faxed resignation, they relieved Fujimori of his duties as president and banned him from Peruvian politics for a decade. He remained in self-imposed [[exile]] in Japan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestatesmanonline.com/pages/columns_details.php?aid=38&amp;cid=81 Fate of indemnity clauses: Let the public decide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928071802/http://www.thestatesmanonline.com/pages/columns_details.php?aid=38&amp;cid=81 |date=28 September 2007 }} 12 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; where he resided with his friend, the famous Catholic novelist [[Ayako Sono]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1044927.stm BBC News Fujimori's uncertain status 28 November 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; Several senior Japanese politicians have supported Fujimori,&lt;ref name= "Pilli"&gt;David Pilling, [http://news.ft.com/cms/s/679d77be-a210-11d9-8483-00000e2511c8.html Peru tiring of bid to secure Fujimori return], ''Financial Times'', 31 March 2005.

[[Alejandro Toledo]], who assumed the Peruvian presidency in 2001, spearheaded the criminal case against Fujimori. He arranged meetings with the Supreme Court, tax authorities, and other powers in Peru to "coordinate the joint efforts to bring the criminal Fujimori from Japan." His vehemence in this matter at times compromised Peruvian law: forcing the judiciary and legislative system to keep guilty sentences without hearing Fujimori's defense; not providing Fujimori with representation when Fujimori was tried ''in absentia''; and expelling pro-Fujimori congressmen from the parliament without proof of the accusations against those congressmen. These expulsions were later reversed by the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.rpp.com.pe/portada/politica/24922_1.php Valle Riestra: Pedido de extradición de Fujimori será rechazado por Chile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051124032807/http://www.rpp.com.pe/portada/politica/24922_1.php |date=24 November 2005 }} RPP Noticias, 16 November 2005.

The Peruvian Congress authorized charges against Fujimori in August 2001. Fujimori was alleged to be a co-author, along with Vladimiro Montesinos, of the death-squad killings at [[Barrios Altos massacre|Barrios Altos]] in 1991 and [[La Cantuta massacre|La Cantuta]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;McClintock, Cynthia and Vallas, Fabian. ''The United States and Peru: Cooperation at a Cost''. 2003, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; At the behest of Peruvian authorities, [[Interpol]] issued an arrest order for Fujimori on charges that included murder, kidnapping, and [[crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]]. 

Meanwhile, the Peruvian government found that Japan was not amenable to the extradition of Fujimori; a protracted diplomatic debate ensued, when Japan showed itself unwilling to accede to the extradition request. Fujimori had been granted Japanese citizenship after his arrival in the country, and the Japanese government maintained that Japanese citizens would not be extradited.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/perus-fujimori-enters-election/|title=Peru's Fujimori Enters Election|last=|first=|date=October 6, 2005|work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2003, Congressman Dora Dávila, joined by Minister of Health Luis Soari, denounced Fujimori and several of his ministers for crimes against humanity, for allegedly having overseen [[forced sterilization]]s during his regime. In November, Congress approved an investigation of Fujimori's involvement in the airdrop of [[AK-47|Kalashnikov]] rifles into the [[Colombia]]n jungle in 1999 and 2000 for guerrillas of the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC). Fujimori maintained he had no knowledge of the arms-trading, and blamed Montesinos. By approving the charges, Congress lifted the immunity granted to Fujimori as a former president, so that he could be criminally charged and prosecuted.

Congress also voted to support charges against Fujimori for the detention and disappearance of 67 students from the central Andean city of [[Huancayo]] and the disappearance of several residents from the northern coastal town of [[Chimbote]] during the 1990s. It also approved charges that Fujimori mismanaged millions of dollars from Japanese charities, suggesting that the millions of dollars in his bank account were far too much to have been accumulated legally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3710848.stm New Evidence in Fujimori Scandal]. ''BBC'', 2 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2004, the Special Prosecutor established to investigate Fujimori released a report alleging that the Fujimori administration had obtained US$2 billion though graft.&lt;ref name="Forero"&gt;Forero, Juan.

Fujimori dismissed the judicial proceedings underway against him as "politically motivated", citing Toledo's involvement. Fujimori established a new political party in Peru, ''[[Sí Cumple]]'', working from Japan. He hoped to participate in the [[Peruvian general election, 2006|2006 presidential elections]], but in February 2004, the Constitutional Court dismissed this possibility, because the ex-president was specifically barred by Congress from holding any office for ten years. Fujimori saw the decision as unconstitutional, as did his supporters such as ex-congressmembers [[Luz Salgado]], [[Marta Chávez]] and [[Fernán Altuve]], who argued it was a "political" maneuver and that the only body with the authority to determine the matter was the [[National Jury of Elections|Jurado Nacional de Elecciones]] (JNE). [[Valentín Paniagua]] disagreed, suggesting that the Constitutional Court finding was binding and that "no further debate is possible".&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.terra.com.pe/noticias/nacional/18/18990.html No hay nada más que discutir sobre candidatura de Fujimori], ''Noticias'' on terra.com.peru, 27 February 2006 credited to ''Andina''.

By March 2005, it appeared that Peru had all but abandoned its efforts to extradite Fujimori from Japan. In September of that year, Fujimori obtained a new Peruvian passport in Tokyo and announced his intention to run in the [[Peruvian general election, 2006|Peruvian national election, 2006]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  He arrived in Chile in November 2005, but hours after his arrival there he was arrested.

==Legacy==

=== Economic achievements ===
Fujimori is credited by many Peruvians for bringing stability to the country after the violence and hyperinflation of the García years. While it is generally agreed that the "Fujishock" brought short/middle-term macroeconomic stability, the long-term social impact of Fujimori's free market economic policies is still hotly debated.

Neoliberal reforms under Fujimori took place in three distinct phases: an initial "orthodox" phase (1990–92) in which technocrats dominated the reform agenda; a "pragmatic" phase (1993–98) that saw the growing influence of business elites over government priorities; and a final "watered-down" phase (1999–2000) dominated by a clique of personal loyalists and their [[Clientelism|clientelist]] policies that aimed to secure Fujimori a third term as president. Business was a big winner of the reforms, with its influence increasing significantly within both the state and society.&lt;ref name = "Arce 2005"&gt;{{cite book |last= Arce |first= Moisés |year= 2005 |title= Market Reform in Society: Post-Crisis Politics and Economic Change in Authoritarian Peru |location= University Park, PA |publisher= [[Penn State University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-271-02542-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

High growth during Fujimori's first term petered out during his second term.

Peru was reintegrated into the global economic system, and began to attract [[Mineral industry of Peru|foreign investment]]. The sell-off of state-owned enterprises led to improvements in some service industries, notably local telephony, mobile telephony and Internet. For example, before privatization, a consumer or business had to wait up to 10 years to get a local telephone line installed by the state-run telephone company, at a cost of $607 for a residential line.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.up.edu.pe/ciup/AER/textos/Fernandez-Baca.ppt Las Privatizaciones y la Pobreza en el Perú: Resultados y Desafios] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721214646/http://www.up.edu.pe/ciup/AER/textos/Fernandez-Baca.ppt |date=21 July 2006 }} ([[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] presentation), unsigned, undated, on the site of El Área de Economía de la Regulación, Centro de Investigación de la Universidad del Pacífico (CIUP).

By the end of the decade, Peru's international currency reserves were built up from nearly zero at the end of García's term to almost US$10 billion. Fujimori also left a smaller state bureaucracy and reduced government expenses (in contrast to the historical pattern of bureaucratic expansion), a technically minded (but widely perceived as politicized) administration of public entities like [[SUNAT]] (the tax collection agency), a large number of new schools, not only in Lima but in Peru's small towns, more roads and highways, and new and upgraded communications infrastructure.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} These improvements led to a revival in tourism, agroexport, industries and fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www2.congreso.gob.pe/Sicr/Prensa/heraldo.nsf/0/bc520537f55e0ec805256f3a006beff6?OpenDocument Primer reporte-resumen ...

===Criticism===
Detractors have observed that Fujimori was able to encourage large-scale mining projects with foreign corporations and push through mining-friendly legislation laws because the post auto-coup political picture greatly facilitated the process.

Some analysts state that some of the GDP growth during the Fujimori years reflects a greater rate of extraction of non-renewable resources by transnational companies; these companies were attracted by Fujimori by means of near-zero royalties, and, by the same fact, little of the extracted wealth has stayed in the country.&lt;ref&gt;"Chile, Peru – How much do mining companies contribute?

Fujimori's privatization program also remains shrouded in controversy. A congressional investigation in 2002, led by socialist opposition congressman [[Javier Díez Canseco|Javier Diez Canseco]], stated that of the USD $9 billion raised through the privatizations of hundreds of state-owned enterprises, only a small fraction of this income ever benefited the Peruvian people.

According to a more recent [[University of Lima|Universidad de Lima]] survey, Fujimori still retains public support, ranking fifth in personal popularity among other political figures.

The Lima-based newspaper ''Perú 21'' ran an editorial noting that even though the [[University of Lima|Universidad de Lima]] poll results indicate that four out of every five interviewees believe that Fujimori is guilty of some of the charges against him, he still enjoys at least 30% of popular support and enough approval to restart a political career.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7794">The '''Asylum and Immigration Tribunal''' ('''AIT''') was a [[tribunal]] constituted in the [[United Kingdom]] with [[jurisdiction]] to hear [[appeal]]s from many [[immigration]] and [[Right of asylum|asylum]] decisions. It was created on 4 April 2005, replacing the former [[Immigration Appellate Authority]] (IAA), and fell under the administration of the [[Tribunals Service]].

On 15 February 2010, the Tribunal was abolished and its functions transferred to the new Asylum and Immigration Chamber of the [[First-tier Tribunal]] created by the [[Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribunals.gov.uk/ImmigrationAsylum/ Tribunals Service]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Special Immigration Appeals Commission]] (SIAC) has been set up to hear appeals against removal of potential deportees in high security cases.  The information given to appellants and their representatives is limited as compared to other removal hearings.

==History==

===Origins===
The system of appeals to [[adjudicator]]s (who were appointed by the [[Home Secretary|Secretary of State]]) with the right of subsequent appeal to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal (IAT) (whose members were appointed by the [[Lord Chancellor]]) was first created by the [[Immigration Appeals Act 1969]] (1969 c.21).

===The IAA===
The predecessor of the AIT, the Immigration Appellate Authority (IAA), was an independent judicial body in the [[United Kingdom]] constituted under the [[Immigration Act 1971]]. It consisted of two tiers:Immigration Adjudicators and the Immigration Appeal Tribunal (IAT).

Immigration Adjudicators considered appeals against decisions made by Immigration Officers, [[entry clearance]] officers and the [[Home Secretary]], with permanent centres in [[Islington]] in inner London, [[Hatton Cross]], [[Birmingham]], [[Leeds]], [[Manchester]] and [[Glasgow]].

The IAT dealt with applications for [[leave to appeal]] and appeals against decisions made by the Immigration Adjudicators, the main hearing centre was in Bream's Buildings, just off [[Chancery Lane]], in Central London.

===The creation of the AIT===
The [[Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004]] abolished the two tier structure and created a single tier tribunal. All former adjudicators and members of the IAA became members of the new AIT. At this point, the Home Office Adjudicators became known as Immigration Judges, although many of these are not officially qualified as judges, the former 'regional adjudicators became Senior Immigration Judges, who are mostly involved in reconsideration applications for previously dismissed appeals.

==Procedure==
At hearings, asylum seekers and would-be immigrants are usually, but not invariably, represented by legal representatives including [[barrister]]s, [[advocate]]s, [[solicitor]]s, and those registered with the Office of the Immigration Service Commissioner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.immigrationsolicitorhelp.co.uk/ Immigration Solicitor] Service Commissioner Procedure&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UK government]] is usually represented by Home Office Presenting Officers ("HOPOs"); specially trained [[Civil Servant]]s. For some significant cases, the Home Office instructs a barrister from [[Treasury Solicitor's Department|TSol]] to conduct the case.

Procedure is governed by the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 (SI 2005/230).

==Further Appeals==
Ordinarily, there is no right to [[appeal]] a decision of the AIT.

The AIT makes most initial decisions through a single immigration judge.  Such decisions can be "reconsidered".  An order for reconsideration is sought by making a written request to the [[High Court of England and Wales|High Court]] in England and [[Wales]] or the [[Court of Session]] ([[Outer House]]) in [[Scotland]].  For an indefinite period requests for reconsideration orders will be considered initially by Immigration judges of the AIT ("the filter"); should the request be refused a party can opt into the High Court or Court of Session.

Either of the parties (the Home Secretary or the Appellant) can apply for reconsideration, within strict time limits (for example, 5 days from receipt of the decision if the Appellant is in the UK). Such an application must be made in writing. A Senior Immigration Judge considers whether or not the grounds for reconsideration are "arguable". The only matters which can be considered are errors of law. A party cannot say that he seeks a re-hearing of the facts or that the factual conclusions reached by the Immigration Judge are wrong. He can only seek reconsideration if the Immigration Judge has misdirected himself in law, failed to consider relevant material, considered irrelevant material, or erred in his fact-finding to the extent that the findings are irrational and therefore amount to an error of law.

If permission is refused on the papers, the party may renew his application for an order for reconsideration to the High Court or Court of Session. Again, the time limits are short. If the High Court or Court of Sessions agree that the AIT has made a mistake in not considering the application for reconsideration, he may order the AIT to reconsider.

A successful application comes before the AIT for reconsideration. Most of these cases are heard at the old IAT, at Field House, Bream's Buildings, just off Chancery Lane in central London. Some are heard elsewhere. The initial hearing is a first-stage reconsideration, usually called an "error of law hearing" by lawyers and Immigration Judges. The panel of Immigration Judges (usually one legally-qualified Senior Immigration Judge and one or two lay members) determine whether a material error of law was made in the determination (judgment). If they conclude that no error was made, that is the end of the matter in front of the AIT. If they conclude that there was a material error of law, they may either reconsider the case in full or in part themselves, or (more usually) order that it be re-heard at a later date. They may set out that all the case be re-considered, or only part of it, depending on the exact circumstances. The second-stage reconsideration may be heard by three Immigration Judges, or by a single Immigration Judge.

After a re-hearing, or if the AIT which hears a case for the first time has a 3 or more members, the decision may only be challenged by an appeal to the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] (Civil Division) in England and Wales, or the [[Court of Session]] (Inner House) in Scotland.  Permission is required for such an appeal either from the Tribunal itself or the relevant court.

A '''blockade''' is an effort to cut off [[Contraband|supplies]], [[Materiel|war material]] or [[communication]]s from a particular area by force, either in part or totally. A blockade should not be confused with an [[embargo]] or [[International sanctions|sanctions]], which are legal barriers to trade. It is also distinct from a [[siege]] in that a blockade is usually directed at an entire country or region, rather than a fortress or city. While most blockades historically took place at sea, blockade is still used on land to prevent someone coming into a certain area.

A blockading power can seek to cut off all maritime transport from and to the blockaded country; although stopping all land transport to and from an area may also be considered a blockade. Blockades restrict the trading rights of neutrals, who must submit for inspection for contraband, which the blockading power may define narrowly or broadly, sometimes including food and medicine. In the 20th century [[air power]] has also been used to enhance the effectiveness of the blockade by halting air traffic within the blockaded airspace.

Close patrol of hostile ports, in order to prevent naval forces from putting to sea, is also referred to as a blockade. When coastal cities or fortresses were besieged from the landward side, the besiegers would often blockade the seaward side as well. Most recently, blockades have sometimes included cutting off electronic communications by [[radio jamming|jamming radio]] signals and severing [[Submarine communications cable|undersea cables]].

==History==
Although primitive naval blockades had been in use for millennia, the first successful attempts at establishing a full naval blockade were made by [[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] [[Edward Hawke, 1st Baron Hawke|Edward Hawke]] during the [[Seven Years' War]] (1754-1763).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0203029496|title=Seapower and Naval Warfare, 1650-1830|author=Richard Harding|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the British naval victory at [[Battle of Quiberon Bay|Quiberon Bay]], which ended any immediate threat of a major invasion of the [[British Isles]],&lt;ref&gt;Anderson p.381-83&lt;/ref&gt; the British implemented a tight economic blockade on the French coast. This began to starve French ports of commerce, further weakening France's economy. Hawke took command of the blockading fleet off [[Brest, France|Brest]] and extended the blockade of the French coast from [[Dunkirk]] to [[Marseilles]].&lt;ref&gt;Corbett p.86&lt;/ref&gt; The British were able to take advantage of the Navy's position to develop plans for amphibious landings on the coast. However, these plans were eventually abandoned, due to the formidable logistical challenge this would have posed.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett p.93-94&lt;/ref&gt;

The strategic importance of the blockade was cemented during the [[French Revolutionary War|Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic War]]s, during which successful blockades on [[France]] were imposed by the [[Royal Navy]], leading to major economic disruptions.  The [[Union blockade]] of southern ports was a major factor in the [[American Civil War]], as was the failure of the [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)|U-boat blockade in World War I]] and again in World War II.

[[Julian Corbett]] and [[Admiral Mahan]] emphasized that naval operations were chiefly to be won by [[decisive battle]]s and blockade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/85c80b3a-5665-42cd-9b1e-72c40d6d3153/NWC-1005-NAVAL-CLASSICAL-THINKERS-AND-OPERATIONAL-.aspx |title=Naval Classical Thinkers and Operational Art |year=2009 |first1=Dr. Milan |last1=Vego |publisher=[[Naval War College]] |page=4 |accessdate=December 12, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131144505/https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/85c80b3a-5665-42cd-9b1e-72c40d6d3153/NWC-1005-NAVAL-CLASSICAL-THINKERS-AND-OPERATIONAL-.aspx |archivedate=31 January 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of blockade==
[[File:Uboatsafterthewar.jpg|thumb|left|In World War II, [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[U-boat]]s attempted to stop ships carrying food, supplies and matériel from reaching the United Kingdom, an example of a ''distant blockade''.]]

===Close, distant, and loose blockades===
A ''close'' blockade entails placing warships within sight of the blockaded coast or port, to ensure the immediate interception of any ship entering or leaving. It is both the most effective and the most difficult form of blockade to implement. Difficulties arise because the blockading ships must remain continuously at sea, exposed to storms and hardship, usually far from any support, and vulnerable to sudden attack from the blockaded side, whose ships may stay safe in harbor until they choose to come out.

In a ''distant'' blockade, the blockaders stay well away from the blockaded coast and try to intercept any ships going in or out. This may require more ships on station, but they can usually operate closer to their bases, and are at much less risk from enemy raids. This was almost impossible prior to the 16th century due to the nature of the ships used.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Michael A., ''Command at Sea: Naval Command and Control since the Sixteenth Century'', Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 2005, p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''loose'' blockade is a close blockade where the blockading ships are withdrawn out of sight from the coast (behind the horizon) but no farther. The object of loose blockade is to lure the enemy into venturing out but to stay close enough to strike.

British [[admiral]] [[Horatio Nelson]] applied a loose blockade at [[Cádiz]] in 1805. The Franco-Spanish fleet under [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] then came out, resulting in the [[Battle of Trafalgar]].&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Clark G. 1998. "Navies in History", p. 98. {{ISBN|1-55750-715-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pacific blockade===
Until 1827, blockades, as part of [[economic warfare]], were always a part of a war. This changed when France, [[Russia]] and Britain came to the aid of the [[First Hellenic Republic|Greek rebels against Turkey]]. They blockaded the Turkish-occupied coast, which led to the [[battle of Navarino]]. War was never declared, however, so it is considered the first ''pacific'' — i.e. peaceful — blockade.&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheim, L. &amp; Roxburgh, Ronald. 2005. "International Law: A Treatise", p. 53. {{ISBN|1-58477-609-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The first truly [[pacific blockade]], involving no shooting at all, was the British blockade of the [[Republic of New Granada]] in 1837, established to compel New Granada to release an imprisoned British consul.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica]], 11th edition. 1911. "Pacific Blockade", vol. 20, p. 433-434.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
[[File:President Kennedy with advisors after EXCOMM meeting, 29 October 1962 crop.jpg|thumb|right|[[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]] and his advisors discuss the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. Part of the US response to [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] missiles being placed in [[Cuba]] was a naval blockade of the island.]]

Since 1945, the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] determines the legal status of blockades and by [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter|article 42]] of the [[United Nations Charter|UN Charter]], the Council can also apply blockades.&lt;ref&gt;D'Amato, Anthony A. 1995. "International Law and Political Reality: Collected Papers", p. 138. {{ISBN|90-411-0036-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The UN Charter allows for the right of self-defense but requires that this must be immediately reported to the Security Council to ensure the maintenance of international peace.

According to the not ratified document [[San Remo Manual]] on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea, 12 June 1994,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/560?OpenDocument San Remo Manual on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea, 12 June 1994]. ICRC.org&lt;/ref&gt; a blockade is a legal method of warfare at sea but is governed by rules. The manual describes what can never be contraband. The blockading nation is free to select anything else as contraband in a list, which it must publish.

The blockading nation typically establishes a blockaded area of water, but any ship can be inspected as soon as it is established that it is attempting to break the blockade. This inspection can occur inside the blockaded area or in international waters, but never inside the territorial waters of a [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral nation]]. A neutral ship must obey a request to stop for inspection from the blockading nation. If the situation so demands, the blockading nation can request that the ship divert to a known place or harbour for inspection. If the ship does not stop, then the ship is subject to capture. If people aboard the ship resist capture, they can be lawfully attacked.

===Act of war===
{{Main|Casus belli}}

Whether or not a blockade was seen as lawful depended on the laws of the nations whose trade was influenced by the blockade. The [[Brazil]]ian blockade of [[Río de la Plata]] in 1826 during the [[Cisplatine War]], for instance, was considered lawful according to British law but unlawful according to French and American law. The latter two countries announced they would actively defend their ships against Brazilian blockaders, while Britain was forced to steer for a peaceful solution between Brazil and [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;Sondhaus, Lawrence. 2004. "Navies in Modern World History", p. 98. {{ISBN|1-86189-202-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil disobedience ===

[[File:Embracing the base, Greenham Common December 1982 - geograph.org.uk - 759090.jpg|thumb|120px|left|30,000 at [[Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp|Greenham Common]].]]There are a number of protest actions with the specific aim of cutting off material, people or communications from a particular area by [[non-violence]], either in part or totally. The effectiveness of such blockades rely on the principles of [[nonviolent resistance]] especially the participation of people and [[Lock-on (protest tactic)|lock-on]] techniques.

A [[Sitdown strike|sit-down strike]] is a form of civil disobedience in which an organized group of workers, usually employed at a factory or other centralized location, take possession of the workplace by "sitting down" at their stations, effectively preventing their employers from replacing them with strikebreakers. A non-violent picket is another example; it also illustrates the specificity of the blockade, non-violent pickets may demand the blocking of some traffic while allowing other traffic; e.g. workers but not the customers, or customers but not workers.

The [[Mau movement]] was a non-violent movement for [[Samoa]]n independence from colonial rule during the early 1900s. Amongst other actions, participants formed their own "police force", [[Picketing (protest)|picketing]] stores in Apia to prevent the payment of customs to the authorities.
Some other examples are the perimeter blockade by [[human chain]] at [[Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp]], the [[Franklin Dam controversy#Blockade|blockade of the Franklin River dam site]], and the [[Keystone Pipeline#Protests and postponements|Keystone Pipeline]].

== Blockade planning ==
[[File:Blockade connecticut plan civil war cartoon.jpg|thumb|right|400px|A Northern cartoonist ridicules the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]'s initial attempts to blockade ports of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] in the [[American Civil War]]]]

Blockades depend on four general factors:

* The '''value''' of the item being blockaded must warrant the need to blockade. For example, during the 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], the items to be blockaded (or "[[quarantine]]d" to use the more neutral term selected by President [[John F. Kennedy]]) were [[Medium-range ballistic missile]]s, capable of delivering [[nuclear weapon]]ry, bound for Cuba. Their value was high, as a military threat against the United States. 
* The '''strength''' of the blockading force must be equal to or greater in strength than the opposition. The blockade is only successful if the 'thing' in question is prevented from reaching its receiver. For example, the overwhelming power of the [[Royal Navy]] allowed a successful [[blockade of Germany]].
* In the case of land blockades, choosing '''suitable terrain'''. Knowing where the force will be travelling will help the blockader choose where to blockade: for example, forcing a garrison between a high mountain pass in order to bottleneck the opposing force.
* A blockade tends to be a long [[Military campaign|campaign]] requiring a '''long-term commitment''' by the blockading power. The [[Atlantic U-boat Campaign (World War I)]] and [[Battle of the Atlantic]] were essentially about German blockades, and lasted nearly as long as their respective wars.  The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], however, made only sporadic efforts at blockade during the [[Pacific war]], preferring to seek victory by [[fleet action]].

==Blockade running==
{{main|Blockade runner}}
Blockade running is the practice of delivering cargo (food, for example) to a blockaded area. It has mainly been done by ships (called [[blockade runner]]s) across ports under naval blockade. Blockade runners were typically the fastest ships available and often lightly armed and armored.

However, it is now also been done by aircraft, forming [[airbridge (logistics)|airbridges]], such as over the [[Berlin blockade]] after [[World War II]].

The '''Bodleian Library''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɒ|d|l|i|ə|n|,_|b|ɒ|d|ˈ|l|iː|ə|n}}) is the main [[research library]] of the [[University of Oxford]], and is one of the oldest libraries in Europe. With over 12 million items,&lt;ref name=Size/&gt; it is the second-largest library in Britain after the [[British Library]]. Under the ''[[Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003]]'' it is one of six [[legal deposit]] libraries for works published in the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.llgc.org.uk/aldl/|title=Agency for the Legal Deposit Libraries|work=llgc.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and under Irish Law it is entitled to request a copy of each book published in the Republic of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;S198(5) Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Known to Oxford scholars as "Bodley" or "the Bod", it operates principally as a [[reference library]] and, in general, documents may not be removed from the reading rooms.

In 2000, a number of libraries within the University of Oxford were brought together for administrative purposes under the aegis of what was initially known as Oxford University Library Services (OULS), and since 2010 as the [[Bodleian Libraries]], of which the Bodleian Library is the largest component.

All [[colleges of the University of Oxford]] have their own libraries, which in a number of cases were established well before the foundation of the Bodleian, and all of which remain entirely independent of the Bodleian. They do, however, participate in OLIS ([[Oxford Libraries Information System]]), the Bodleian Libraries' online [[union catalog]]ue. Much of the library's archives were digitized and put online for public access in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Jones, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/08/bodleian-library-oxford-archive-online-illumination-for-all-democratic Oxford’s online Bodleian archive: illumination for all], The Guardian, 8 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sites and regulations==
The Bodleian Library occupies a group of five buildings near [[Broad Street, Oxford|Broad Street]]: the 15th-century [[Duke Humfrey's Library]], the 17th-century Schools Quadrangle, the 18th-century [[Clarendon Building]] and [[Radcliffe Camera]], and the 20th and 21st-century [[Weston Library]]. Since the 19th century a number of underground stores have been built, while the principal off-site storage area is located at [[South Marston]] on the edge of [[Swindon]].

===Admission===
Before being granted access to the library, new readers are required to agree to a formal declaration. This declaration was traditionally an oral oath, but is now usually made by signing a letter to a similar effect. Ceremonies in which readers recite the declaration are still performed for those who wish to take them; these occur primarily at the start of the University's [[Michaelmas term]]. External readers (those not attached to the University) are still required to recite the declaration orally prior to admission. The Bodleian Admissions Office has amassed a large collection of translations of the declaration — covering over one hundred different languages as of spring 2017&lt;ref name=Twitter&gt;{{Cite tweet |user=bodleianlibs |author=Bodleian Libraries |number=852527378215694336 |date = 13 Apr 2017 |title=We have translated the Bodleian oath into more than one hundred languages. Readers make the pledge in their mother tongue.}}&lt;/ref&gt; — allowing those who are not native English speakers to recite it in their first language. The English text of the declaration is as follows:

:I hereby undertake not to remove from the Library, nor to mark, deface, or injure in any way, any volume, document or other object belonging to it or in its custody; not to bring into the Library, or kindle therein, any fire or flame, and not to smoke in the Library; and I promise to obey all rules of the Library.

This is a translation of the traditional Latin oath (the original version of which did not forbid tobacco smoking, though libraries were then unheated because fires were so hazardous):

:''Do fidem me nullum librum vel instrumentum aliamve quam rem ad bibliothecam pertinentem, vel ibi custodiae causa depositam, aut e bibliotheca sublaturum esse, aut foedaturum deformaturum aliove quo modo laesurum; item neque ignem nec flammam in bibliothecam inlaturum vel in ea accensurum, neque fumo nicotiano aliove quovis ibi usurum; item promitto me omnes leges ad bibliothecam Bodleianam attinentes semper observaturum esse.''&lt;ref name="oath"&gt;Latin oath:- ''Do fidem me nullum librum vel instrumentum aliamve quam rem ad bibliothecam pertinentem, vel ibi custodiae causa depositam, aut e bibliotheca sublaturum esse, aut foedaturum deformaturum aliove quo modo laesurum; item neque ignem nec flammam in bibliothecam inlaturum vel in ea accensurum, neque fumo nicotiano aliove quovis ibi usurum; item promitto me omnes leges ad bibliothecam Bodleianam attinentes semper observaturum esse. (Leges bibliothecae bodleianae alta voce praelegendae custodis iussu)''. One early reader bequeathed a fur coat to the library to help future readers.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===14th and 15th centuries===
[[File:The old Divinity Schools and Duke Humphrey’s Library at Oxford.jpg|right|thumb|The library in 1566, drawn by John Bereblock and given to Queen Elizabeth I as part of a book when she first visited Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clapinson|first1=Mary|title=A Brief History of the Bodleian Library.|date=2015|publisher=University of Oxford|location=Oxford, London|isbn=9781851242733|page=6|chapter=The Early Years}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Whilst the Bodleian Library, in its current incarnation, has a continuous history dating back to 1602, its roots date back even further. The first purpose-built library known to have existed in Oxford was founded in the fourteenth century under the will of [[Thomas Cobham]], [[Bishop of Worcester]] (d. 1327). This small collection of [[chained library|chained books]] was situated above the north side of the [[University Church of St Mary the Virgin]] on the High Street.&lt;ref&gt;Philip, Ian (1983) ''The Bodleian Library in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries''. Oxford: Clarendon Press {{ISBN|0-19-822484-2}}; p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bodleian Library''.

A suitable room was finally built above the [[Divinity School, Oxford|Divinity School]], and completed in 1488. This room continues to be known as [[Duke Humfrey's Library]].&lt;ref name="Jarrold 1976"&gt;''The Bodleian Library'' 1976. See also Bodleian history page at https://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/bodley/about-us/history&lt;/ref&gt; After 1488, the university stopped spending money on the library's upkeep and acquisitions, and manuscripts began to go unreturned to the library.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clapinson|first1=Mary|title=A Brief History of the Bodleian Library.|date=2015|publisher=University of Oxford|location=Oxford, London|isbn=9781851242733|pages=5-7|chapter=The Early Years}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sir Thomas Bodley and the re-founding of the University Library===
The late sixteenth century saw the library go through a period of decline: the library’s furniture was sold, and only three of the original books belonging to Duke Humphrey remained in the collection.&lt;ref name="Jarrold 1976"/&gt;  During the reign of [[Edward VI]], there was a purge of "superstitious" (Catholic-related) manuscripts.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"/&gt; It was not until 1598 that the library began to thrive once more,&lt;ref&gt;Philip, Ian (1983); p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Thomas Bodley]] (a former fellow of [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]], who had recently married a wealthy widow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clapinson|first1=Mary|title=A Brief History of the Bodleian Library.|date=2015|publisher=University of Oxford|location=Oxford, London|isbn=9781851242733|pages=1-4|chapter=The Early Years}}&lt;/ref&gt;) wrote to the Vice Chancellor of the University offering to support the development of the library: "where there hath bin hertofore a publike library in Oxford: which you know is apparent by the rome it self remayning, and by your statute records I will take the charge and cost upon me, to reduce it again to his former use."&lt;ref&gt;Philip, Ian (1983); p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  Six of the Oxford University dons were tasked with helping Bodley in refitting the library in March 1658.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=BEDDARD|first1=R A|title=The Official Inauguration of the Bodleian Library on 8 November 1602|journal=[[Bibliographical Society|The Library]]|date=1 September 2002|volume=3|issue=3|pages=255–283|doi=10.1093/library/3.3.255}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke Humfrey’s Library was refitted, and Bodley donated a number of his own books to furnish it. The library was formally re-opened on 8 November 1602 under the name “Bodleian Library” (officially Bodley's Library).&lt;ref name="Jarrold 1976"/&gt;  There were around two thousand books in the library at this time, with an ornate Benefactor's Register displayed prominently, to encourage donations.  Early benefactors were motivated by the recent memory of the [[Reformation]] to donate books in the hopes that they would be kept safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clapinson|first1=Mary|title=A Brief History of the Bodleian Library.|date=2015|publisher=University of Oxford|location=Oxford, London|isbn=9781851242733|pages=9-11|chapter=The Early Years}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bodley’s collecting interests were varied; according to the library's historian Ian Philip, as early as June 1603 he was attempting to source manuscripts from Turkey, and it was during “the same year that the first Chinese book was acquired.”,&lt;ref&gt;Philip, Ian (1983); p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; despite no-one at Oxford being able to understand them at that time.&lt;ref name="autogenerated14"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clapinson|first1=Mary|title=A Brief History of the Bodleian Library.|date=2015|publisher=University of Oxford|location=Oxford, London|isbn=9781851242733|page=14|chapter=The Early Years}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1605, [[Francis Bacon]] gave the library a copy of [[The Advancement of Learning]] and described the Bodleian as "an Ark to save learning from deluge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Novum organum (New Instrument)|url=https://genius.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/exhibits/browse/novum-organum-new-instrument/|website=Marks of Genius|publisher=Bodleian Library|accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At this time, there were few books written in English held in the library, partially because academic work was not done in English.&lt;ref name="autogenerated14"/&gt;  [[Thomas James]] suggested that Bodley should ask the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers' Company]] to provide a copy of all books printed to the Bodleian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clapinson|first1=Mary|title=A Brief History of the Bodleian Library.|date=2015|publisher=University of Oxford|location=Oxford, London|isbn=9781851242733|page=15|chapter=The Early Years}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1610 Bodley made an agreement with the company to put a copy of every book registered with them in the library.&lt;ref name=Jackson1969&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=Sidney L.|title=Bodley and the Bodleian: Collections, Use and Administration|journal=[[The Library Quarterly|The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy]]|date=1 January 1969|volume=39|issue=3|pages=253–270|jstor=4305998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bodleian collection grew so fast that the building was expanded between 1610–1612, (known as the Arts End)&lt;ref name=Jackson1969/&gt; and again in 1634–1637. When [[John Selden]] died in 1654, he left the Bodleian his large collection of books and manuscripts. The later addition to Duke Humfrey’s Library continues to be known as the "Selden End".

By 1620, 16,000 items were in the Bodleian's collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=D.

===Schools Quadrangle and Tower of the Five Orders===
By the time of Bodley’s death in 1613, his planned further expansion to the library was just starting.&lt;ref name="library-history"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Bodleian|url=http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/about/history|website=Bodleian Libraries|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Schools Quadrangle (sometimes referred to as the "Old Schools Quadrangle", or the "Old Library") was built between 1613 and 1619 by adding three wings to the Proscholium and Arts End. Its tower forms the main entrance to the library, and is known as the '''Tower of the Five Orders'''. The Tower is so named because it is ornamented, in ascending order, with the columns of each of the five orders of [[classical architecture]]: [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]], [[Doric order|Doric]], [[Ionic order|Ionic]], [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] and [[Composite order|Composite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cole|first1=Catherine|title=The Building of the Tower of Five Orders in the Schools' Quadrangle at Oxford|url=http://oxoniensia.org/volumes/1968/cole.pdf|publisher=Oxoniensia|date=1968|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three wings of the quadrangle have three floors: rooms on the ground and upper floors of the quadrangle (excluding [[Duke Humfrey’s Library]], above the [[Divinity School, Oxford|Divinity School]]) were originally used as lecture space and an art gallery. The lecture rooms are still indicated by the inscriptions over the doors (see illustration). As the library’s collections expanded, these rooms were gradually taken over, the University lectures and examinations were moved into the newly created University Schools building.&lt;ref name="library-history"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Bodleian|url=http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/about/history|website=Bodleian Libraries|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The art collection was transferred to the [[Ashmolean]]. One of the schools was used to host exhibitions of the library’s treasures, now moved to the renovated Weston Library, whilst the others are used as offices and meeting rooms for the library administrators, a readers' common room, and a small gift shop.

===Later 17th and 18th centuries===
[[File:Architectural Study (Old Schools Hall, Oxford) LACMA M.2008.40.905.jpg|thumb|left|The Tower of the Five Orders photographed by [[Henry Fox Talbot]], c. 1843/46]]
The agreement with the Stationers' Company meant that the growth of stock was constant and there were also a number of large bequests and acquisitions for other reasons. Until the establishment of the British Museum in 1753 the Bodleian was effectively the national library of England. By then the Bodleian, [[Cambridge University Library]] and the Royal Library were the most extensive book collections in England and Wales.

The astronomer [[Thomas Hornsby]] observed the [[transit of Venus]] from the Tower of the Five Orders in 1769.&lt;ref&gt;University of Oxford: Museum of the History of Science, [http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/venus/html/exhibition/oxford-observations.htm “The most noble problem in nature: the transit of Venus in the eighteenth century”] online catalogue of an exhibition held in 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

A large collection of medieval Italian manuscripts was bought from Matteo Luigi Canonici in 1817.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/weston/finding-resources/guides/medieval |title=Weston Library &amp;#124; Classical &amp; Medieval MSS |publisher=Bodleian.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1829, the library bought the collection of Rabbi [[David Oppenheim (rabbi)|David Oppenheim]], adding to its Hebrew collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/weston/finding-resources/guides/hebrew |title=Weston Library &amp;#124; Hebraica, Judaica &amp; Semitics |publisher=Bodleian.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radcliffe Camera===
By the late 18th century, further growth of the library demanded more expansion space. In 1860, the library was allowed to take over the adjacent building, known as the [[Radcliffe Camera]]. In 1861, the library’s medical and scientific collections were transferred to the [[Radcliffe Science Library]], which had been built farther north next to the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History|University Museum]].

===Clarendon Building===
The [[Clarendon Building]] was designed by [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]] and was built between 1711 and 1715, originally to house the printing presses of the [[Oxford University Press]]. It was vacated by the Press in the early nineteenth century, and used by the university for administrative purposes. In 1975 it was handed over to the Bodleian Library, and now provides office and meeting space for senior members of staff.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, S.

===Twentieth century and after===
In 1907 the then head librarian, Nicholson, had begun a project to revise the catalogue of printed books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clapinson|first1=Mary|title=A Brief History of the Bodleian Library.|date=2015|publisher=University of Oxford|location=Oxford, London|isbn=9781851242733|page=126|chapter=A new century and a New Bodleian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1909, the Prime Minister of Nepal, [[Chandra Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana|Chandra Shum Shere]], donated a large collection of Sanskrit literature to the library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/weston/finding-resources/guides/southasia |title=Weston Library &amp;#124; South &amp; Inner Asia |publisher=Bodleian.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, the [[Copyright Act 1911|Copyright Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/1-2/46/contents |title=Copyright Act 1911 |publisher=legislation.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; (now superseded by the [[Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003]]) continued the Stationers' agreement by making the Bodleian one of the six (at that time) libraries covering [[legal deposit]] in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] where a copy of each book copyrighted must be deposited.

Between 1909 and 1912, an underground bookstack was constructed beneath the [[Radcliffe Camera]] and [[Radcliffe Square]].&lt;ref name="exhibition-proposals"&gt;Oxford University Library Services: “A university library for the 21st century: an exhibition of proposals by the oxford university library services (OULS)”, (University of Oxford, 2005)

The New Bodleian was designed by architect [[Sir Giles Gilbert Scott]]. Construction was completed in 1940. The building was of an innovative [[ziggurat]] design, with 60% of the bookstack below ground level.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=A university library for the twenty-first century: a report to Congregation by the Curators of the University Libraries|journal=Oxford University Gazette |publisher=University of Oxford |date= 22 September 2005 |volume=4743 |url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/gazette/2005-6/supps/1_4743.htm |accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craster, H.

In November 2015 its collections topped 12 million items with the acquisition of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley's]] "POETICAL ESSAY on the EXISTING STATE OF THINGS". Thought lost from shortly after its publication in 1811 until a copy was rediscovered in a private collection in 2006, the Bodleian has digitised the 20-page pamphlet for online access.

==Copying and preservation of material==
[[File:Bibliotheksstempel Bodleiana.jpg|right|thumb|[[Bookplate|Ex libris]] stamp of Bodleian Library, circa. 1830.]]
The library operates a strict policy on copying of material. Until fairly recently, personal photocopying of library material was not permitted, as there was concern that copying and excessive handling would result in damage. However individuals may now copy most material produced after 1900, and a staff-mediated service is provided for certain types of material dated between 1801 and 1900. Handheld scanners and digital cameras are also permitted for use on most post-1900 publications and digital cameras may also be used, with permission, with older material.&lt;ref&gt;See Bodleian Library photocopying regulations: https://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/using/copy/copying, accessed 2 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The Library will supply digital scans of most pre-1801 material. [[Microform]] copies have been made of many of the most fragile items in the library's collection, and these are substituted for the originals whenever possible. The library has a close relationship with the '''Oxford Digital Library''', which is in the process of digitising some of the many rare and unusual items in the University's collection.

The first librarian, [[Thomas James]], was selected by Bodley in 1599, and the university confirmed James in his post in 1602.&lt;ref name=Victoria&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=H.

[[Sarah Thomas (librarian)|Sarah Thomas]], who served from 2007 to 2013, was the first woman to hold the position, and the second Librarian (after her predecessor, [[Reginald Carr (librarian)|Reginald Carr]]) also to be Director of Oxford University Library Services (now Bodleian Libraries). Thomas, an American, was also the first foreign librarian to run the Bodleian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/a-doublefirst-at-the-bodleian-library-as-us-woman-takes-over-437195.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923185408/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/a-doublefirst-at-the-bodleian-library-as-us-woman-takes-over-437195.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=23 September 2008|title=A double-first at the Bodleian library as US woman takes over|last=Garner|first=Richard|date=21 February 2007|accessdate=5 January 2010|work=[[The Independent]]|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her successor from January 2014 is Richard Ovenden, who was Deputy Librarian under Thomas.

==In popular culture==
;Novels
The Bodleian is used as background scenery in [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] ''[[Gaudy Night]]'', features in [[Michael White (author)|Michael White]]'s ''Equinox'', and is one of the libraries consulted by Christine Greenaway (one of Bodley's librarians) in [[Colin Dexter]]'s [[Inspector Morse]] novel ''The Wench is Dead''. The denouement of [[Michael Innes]]'s ''Operation Pax'' (1951) is set in an imaginary version of the underground bookstack, reached at night by sliding down the 'Mendip cleft', a chute concealed in [[Radcliffe Square]].

Since [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] had studied philology at Oxford and eventually became a professor, he was very familiar with the [[Red Book of Hergest]] which is kept at the Bodleian on behalf of [[Jesus College, Oxford|Jesus College]]. Tolkien later created his own fictional ''[[Red Book of Westmarch]]'' telling the story of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Many of Tolkien's manuscripts are now at the library.

Historian and novelist [[Deborah Harkness]], set much of the early part of her 2011 novel, ''A Discovery of Witches'', in the Bodleian, particularly the Selden End. The novel also features one of the library's Ashmolean manuscripts (Ashmole 782) as a central element of the book.

Medieval historian [[Dominic Selwood]] set part of his 2013 crypto-thriller ''[[The Sword of Moses (novel)|The Sword of Moses]]'' in Duke Humfrey's library, and the novel hinges on the library's copy of a magical medieval Hebrew manuscript known as '[[The Sword of Moses]]'.

;Location filming
The Library's fine architecture has made it a favourite location for filmmakers, representing either Oxford University or other locations. It can be seen in the opening scene of ''[[The Golden Compass (film)|The Golden Compass]]'', ''[[Brideshead Revisited (TV serial)|Brideshead Revisited]]'' (1981 TV serial), ''[[Another Country (film)|Another Country]]'' (1984), ''[[The Madness of King George III]]'' (1994), and the first two ''[[Harry Potter]]'' films, in which the Divinity School doubles as the [[Hogwarts]] hospital wing and Duke Humfrey's Library as the Hogwarts library.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard, Bill, ''The Oxford of Inspector Morse'' Location Guides, Oxford (2004) p. 203 {{ISBN|0-9547671-1-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The New World (2005 film)|The New World]]'' (2005), the library edifice is portrayed as the entrance to the Royal Court of the English monarchy. The Bodleian also featured in the Inspector Morse televised spin off ''[[Lewis (TV series)|Lewis]]'', in the episode "And the Moonbeams Kiss the Sea", where a murder takes place in the basement. It also featured in the episode "Fugue" of the Inspector Morse televised spin off ''[[Endeavour (TV series)|Endeavour]]'' as the answer to an anagrammatic clue left by a serial killer for the young Morse.

;Quotation
The first few words of the Latin version of the reader's promise noted above (''Do fidem me nullum librum vel'') can be found on the linguist's hat in the 1996 miniseries ''[[Gulliver's Travels (TV miniseries)|Gulliver's Travels]]''.&lt;ref name="oath"/&gt; It is also quoted in an inscription in the [[Phillips Exeter Academy Library]].

The '''day-night average sound level''' (Ldn or DNL) is the average noise level over a 24-hour period. The noise between the hours of 10pm and 7am is artificially increased by 10 [[Decibel|dB]]. This noise is weighted to take into account the decrease in community background noise of 10&amp;nbsp;dB during this period. There is a similar metric called Day-Evening-Night average sound level (DENL) commonly used in Europe or Community Noise Exposure Level (CNEL) used in California legislation, that is the DNL with the addition of an evening period from 7 PM to 10 PM when noises are boosted 5 dB to account for the approximate decrease in background community noise by 5 dB during this period. 

In the US, The [[Federal Aviation Administration]] has established this measure as a community [[noise measurement|noise exposure metric]] to aid airport noise analyses under [[Federal Aviation Regulation]] Part 150&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.faa.gov/airports/environmental/airport_noise/ Airport Noise Compatibility Planning (14 CFR Part 150)].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1399">'''Decree Law 25418''' is a highly controversial [[Peru]]vian law decreed in April 1992 by then-[[President of Peru|President]] [[Alberto Fujimori]]. The decree essentially provided the legal trappings for the [[1992 Peruvian constitutional crisis|coup d'état]] of April 5, 1992.

The decree renamed the [[government of Peru|government]], dissolved the [[Congress of Peru|Congress]], gave the [[Executive Branch]] all legislative powers, suspended much of the [[Constitution of Peru|Constitution]], and gave the president the power to enact various reforms, such as the "application of drastic punishments" towards [[terrorism|terrorists]] and the "moralization" of the [[Judicial System of Peru|Judicial Branch]].

Although Decree Law 25418 was patently unconstitutional, its last article read "the articles of the Political Constitution and the legal norms that oppose this Decree Law are suspended," giving the decree theoretical supremacy over the Constitution. The Peruvian Congress rejected this claim and swore [[Máximo San Román]], Fujimori's Vice President, into the presidency, but San Roman did not gain control over the state apparatus and was never the de facto president.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9510">{{Social teachings of the popes}}
The '''Decree Against Communism''' was a 1949 Catholic Church document issued by the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office]], and approved by [[Pope Pius XII]], which declared Catholics who professed [[Communism|Communist]] doctrine to be [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] as [[apostasy|apostates]] from the Christian faith.

==Background==
Opposition to [[Socialism]] and [[Communism]] in [[Catholic social teaching]] had already been expressed in the teachings of popes since the [[encyclical]]s ''[[Nostis et nobiscum]]'' (1849), ''[[Quanta cura]]'' (1864), and ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' (1891).

In the earlier social encyclicals the criticism of Communism described it as a system violating human rights: e.g., the right to own property. After revolutions in Russia, China, and Mexico had been followed by religious persecution, a new theme of criticism was added, beginning with ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'' (1931) by  [[Pope Pius XI]].  This encyclical objected to Communism's professed opposition to religion, and its threat to the freedom and the very existence of the Church.&lt;ref name=trec/&gt; In 1937, Pius XI rejected atheistic communism in an [[encyclical]] entitled [[Divini Redemptoris]] as "a system full of errors and sophisms", with a "pseudo-ideal of justice, equality, and fraternity" and "a certain false mysticism",&lt;ref name=trec/&gt; and contrasted it with a humane society (''civitas humana'').

After the [[Italian general election, 1948|Italian parliamentary election of April 1948]], in which the Communist-Socialist coalition won 31% of the vote, the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|Holy Office]] began to study the issue of Communism in order to give guidance to Catholic lay people and clergy with questions about support for Communist parties.&lt;ref name=kent&gt;{{cite book

An additional impulse for Vatican action against Communism arose in [[Czechoslovakia]], where the Communist government, installed by a ''[[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état|coup d'état]]'' in February 1948, undertook a campaign to take control of the Catholic Church by several means. Among other measures, it created an organization of priests favorable to the regime, took control of church finances, and demanded that pastoral letters to the faithful or the clergy be approved by government ministries.&lt;ref name=kent/&gt;&lt;ref name=kaplan&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 15, 1948, ''[[L’Osservatore Romano]]'' published a decree which excommunicated those who propagate "the materialistic and anti-Christian teachings of Communism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The document, however, did not mention the [[Italian Communist Party]], which had changed its statutes in 1946, removing an explicit profession of [[Marxism-Leninism]], and opening to participation by citizens, "independent of race, religious faith or philosophical convictions".&lt;ref name=trec/&gt;

In the spring of 1949, pressure on the Church in Czechoslovakia was increasing, and, according to [[Pope Paul VI|Fr. Giovanni Battista Montini]], then papal Secretary of State, Pope Pius XII had come to feel that there would be no effective diplomatic opposition from the West. Thus the Church had to use what means it had to confront Communism, not only in the immediate situation, but for a long-term opposition.&lt;ref name=kent/&gt;

==Form of the document==
The document, as published in the ''[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]]'', bears the date July 1, 1949 and the heading ''Decretum'' (Decree), and is presented in the form of a ''dubium'': that is, in question-and-answer format. It presents four questions, together with the Holy Office's replies: (1) Is it licit to join or show favor to Communist parties? (2) Is it licit to publish, distribute, or read publications that support Communist doctrine or activity, or to write for them? (3) May Christians who knowingly and freely commit the acts in parts 1 and 2 be given the [[sacrament]]s? (4) Do Christians who profess, defend or promote materialistic Communist doctrine incur the penalty of excommunication as apostates from the Christian faith, with the penalty reserved so that it may only be lifted by the Holy See?

The answers in the decree were negative to the first three questions and affirmative to the fourth.

==Publication and reception==
After the document was approved by Pius XII on June 30, the text of the document was delivered to printers to prepare its release. Shortly thereafter it was leaked to the press, and so appeared in public early, with no advance notice to the clergy and no commentary to explain the document.&lt;ref name=kent/&gt;

The decree was published in the Vatican newspaper [[L'Osservatore Romano]] on July 16, 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A commentary followed on July 27, 1949, explaining reasons for its condemnation of Communist activity and doctrine. It also made clear the scope of the excommunication stated in the decree: it did not apply to all people who voted for Communists or supported the party, but only to people who held the materialistic and atheistic doctrines of Communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|title=The Decree of the Holy Office Against Communism: Some Implications
|accessdate=August 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Decree met with some surprising public support despite the disorder around its publication: from Protestant countries there was favorable commentary which recognized the decree as a response to Communist pressure on the Church in Eastern Europe. The United States urged the Patriarch of Constantinople [[Athenagoras I of Constantinople|Athenagoras]], who supported the decree, to issue a similar document for the Orthodox world.&lt;ref name=kent/&gt;

Response from pro-Communist newspapers in Italy was sharply critical, but the Soviet press was silent.  Italian Communist Party General Secretary [[Palmiro Togliatti]] was restrained in his criticism, inasmuch as many party supporters were practicing Catholics.&lt;ref name=kent/&gt;

==Repercussions==
In the wake of the Decree Pope Pius XII encouraged efforts to develop Catholic social teaching and thus counteract the appeal of Communist social doctrine.  The Decree marked the beginning of a long institutional conflict between Catholicism and Communism.&lt;ref name=kent/&gt; The Holy Office issued later documents condemning Communism:
* Excommunication of Bishop Dechet, February 18, 1950,&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1950, 195&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Uncertain Tax Position''' refers to the uncertainties involving tax items claimed or intended to be claimed on an income tax return with a taxing authority. Companies will often take less than certain positions regarding the amount of tax expense they have to pay and/or the amount of tax benefit they are receiving. These uncertain tax positions may be the result of unclear tax law or uncertainties regarding their own circumstances.

Because of the difference in treating the uncertainties, the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] {FASB) issued in 2006 Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” to standardize the accounting for uncertain tax positions (now covered in FASB ASC 740).

{{Environmental law}}
'''Earth jurisprudence''' is a philosophy of [[law]] and [[human]] [[Government|governance]] that is based on the idea that humans are only one part of a wider community of beings and that the welfare of each member of that community is dependent on the welfare of the [[Earth]] as a whole.&lt;ref name="center"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Law center's first case: Saving the planet |url=http://www.mywire.com/pubs/MiamiHerald/2006/05/14/1557834?extID=10051 |journal=[[Miami Herald]] |date=May 14, 2006 |quote=Earth Jurisprudence is premised on the concept that Law and governance is meant to protect the well-being of the planet and all components of the Earth |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922014545/http://www.mywire.com/pubs/MiamiHerald/2006/05/14/1557834?extID=10051 |archivedate=September 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discovering the meaning of Earth jurisprudence|publisher= Legalbrief |url=http://www.legalbrief.co.za/article.php?story=2002082769459999|date= August 27, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It states that [[Society|human societies]] will only be viable and flourish if they regulate themselves as part of this wider Earth community and do so in a way that is consistent with the fundamental laws or principles that govern how the [[universe]] functions, which is the ‘Great Jurisprudence’.

Earth jurisprudence can be differentiated from the Great jurisprudence, but can also be understood as being embedded within it. Earth jurisprudence can be seen as a special case of the Great Jurisprudence, applying universal principles to the governmental, societal and biological processes of Earth.

Earth jurisprudence seeks to expand our understanding of the relevance of governance beyond humanity to the whole Earth community, it is Earth-centric rather than [[anthropocentric]]. It is concerned with the maintenance and regulation of relations between all members of the Earth community, not just between human beings. Earth jurisprudence is intended to provide a philosophical basis for the development and implementation of human governance systems, which may include [[ethics]], [[law]]s, institutions, policies and practices. It also places an emphasis on the internalisation of these insights and on personal practice, in living in accordance with Earth jurisprudence as a way of life.

Earth jurisprudence should reflect a particular human community's understanding of how to regulate itself as part of the Earth community and should express the qualities of the Great jurisprudence of which it forms part. The specific applications of Earth jurisprudence will vary from society to society, while sharing common elements. These elements include:

*a recognition that any Earth jurisprudence exists within a wider context that shapes it and influences how it functions;
*a recognition that the universe is the source of the fundamental ‘Earth rights’ of all members of the Earth community, rather than some part of the human governance system and accordingly these rights cannot be validly circumscribed or abrogated by human jurisprudence;
*a means of recognising the roles and ‘rights’ of non-human members of the Earth community and of restraining humans from unjustifiably preventing them fulfilling those roles; 
*a concern for reciprocity and the maintenance of a dynamic equilibrium between all the members of the Earth community determined by what is best for the system as a whole (Earth justice); and
*an approach to condoning or disapproving human conduct on the basis of whether or not the conduct strengthens or weakens the bonds that constitute the Earth community.

== History ==
The need for a new jurisprudence was first identified by [[Thomas Berry]] who identified the destructive [[anthropocentrism]] on which existing legal and political structures are based as a major impediment to the necessary transition to an ecological age in which humans would seek a new intimacy with the integral functioning of the natural world.

The feasibility of developing this jurisprudence (by then provisionally referred to as ‘Earth jurisprudence’) was discussed at meeting attended by Berry in April 2001, organised by the Gaia Foundation in London at the Airlie Conference Center outside [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. A group of people involved in the law and with indigenous peoples came together from South Africa, Britain, Colombia, Canada and the United States. (See 'Thomas Berry and an Earth Jurisprudence: An Exploratory Essay', by Mike Bell, ''The Trumpeter'', Vol. 19, no. 1 (2003)).  

The first detailed exploration of Earth jurisprudence in print and the introduction of the term ‘Great Jurisprudence’ occurred with the first publication of [[Wild Law (book)|''Wild Law'']] by [[Cormac Cullinan]], launched at the World Summit for Sustainable Development in [[Cape Town]] 2002.

2004 workshop
 
April 2004, first UK workshop held to discuss and develop the principles of Earth jurisprudence, titled [https://web.archive.org/web/20071007023233/http://www.peoplesearthdecade.org/events/calendar.php?event_id=285 'Wild Law Wilderness Workshop: A Walking Workshop on Earth Jurisprudence'].  Donald Reid (former chairman of UKELA, the UK Environmental Law Association) and Cormac Cullinan (author of [[Wild Law (book)|''Wild Law'']]) lead the workshop in the Knoydart Peninsula (one of the last true wilderness areas in the Scotland).

The feasibility of developing a new form of [[jurisprudence]] was discussed at a conference in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] attended by Thomas Berry in April 2001, organised by the Gaia Foundation. A group of people involved with law and indigenous peoples attended from South Africa, Britain, Colombia, Canada and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Thomas Berry and an Earth Jurisprudence: An Exploratory Essay|url=http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.php/trumpet/article/viewFile/106/110|author=Mike Bell|publisher=The Trumpeter|volume=19|issue= 1|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the first Center for Earth Jurisprudence established in Florida. The mission of the Centre, which is co-sponsored by Barry and St. Thomas Universities, Florida, is to re-envision law and governance in ways that support the well being of the Earth community as a whole. This involves fostering mutually enhancing relationships among humans and nature and recognition of the rights of nature.&lt;ref name="center"/&gt;

Earth jurisprudence UK conference held in November 2006, 'A Walk on the Wild Side: Changing Environmental Law'. Based on the book ''Wild Law'' by Cormac Cullinan.  Held at the University of Brighton and organised jointly by UKELA and ELF. Chaired by John Elkington (of SustainAbility and the ELF Advisory Council) with guest speakers, Cormac Cullinan, [[Norman Baker]] MP (former [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] Environment Spokesman), [[Satish Kumar]] (Resurgence) and Begonia Filgueira (Gaia Law Ltd).

EARTH JURISPRUDENCE IN AUSTRALIA

Australia has a very active Earth jurisprudence and 'wild law' movement.  The first wild law conference in Australia was held in Adelaide, South Australia in 2009 and a second conference was held in Wollongong, New South Wales, in 2010.  A third Wild Law conference was organised in 2011 in Brisbane, Queensland and at that time a core group of Earth jurisprudence advocates formed the Australian Earth Laws Alliance (www.earthlaws.org.au).  The Australian Earth Laws Alliance is the leading organisation in Australia promoting Earth laws and wild law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4119">[[File:Souscription de Clotaire II.jpg|thumb|Chlothar II's signature, from a document of 625]]
The '''Edict of [[Paris]]''' of [[Chlothar II]], the [[Merovingian]] [[king of the Franks]], promulgated 18 October 614 (or perhaps 615), is one of the most important royal instruments of the Merovingian period in Frankish history and a hallmark in the history of the development of the Frankish monarchy. It is the last of the Merovingian ''[[Capitulary|capitularia]]'', a series of legal ordinances governing church and realm. 

The Edict was decreed hard on the heels of the canons promulgated at the Fifth Synod of Paris, to which it should be compared.  Chlothar had recently assumed the full kingship of the Franks, in 613, when he deposed his cousin [[Sigebert II]], king of [[Austrasia]], and his [[regent]], his great-grandmother [[Brunhilda of Austrasia|Brunhilda]]. The Edict has been commonly seen as a series of concessions to the Austrasian nobility, which had sided with him against Brunhilda. In ''Der Staat des hohen Mittelalters'', Heinrich Mitteis compared the Edict to the English [[Magna Carta]]. More popular now is the belief that it was primarily aimed at correcting abuses which had entered the judicial system during the civil wars which had dominated the kingdom since the beginning of the feud of Brunhilda with Chlothar's mother, [[Fredegund]] (568). It cannot be known how much of the Edict's language and ideas stem from the king and his officers and courtiers and how much from the nobles. Some of its clauses were designed to amend decisions of the prelates at the synod that had just finished sitting. The bishops insisted upon freedom in the choice of bishops, but Chlothar  modified the council's decisions by insisting that only the bishops he wanted, or those sent from amongst suitable priests at court, should be ordained. 

The Edict throughout attempts to establish order by standardising orderly appointments to offices, both ecclesiastic and secular, and by asserting the responsibilities of all&amp;mdash;the magnates, bishops, and the king&amp;mdash;to secure the happiness and peace of the realm: the ''felicitas regni'' and ''pax et disciplina in regno''. Among the true concessions granted by the Edict were the ban on Jews in royal offices,&lt;ref&gt;The Synod had enacted that all Jews holding military or civil positions must accept baptism, together with their families.&lt;/ref&gt; leaving all such appointments to the Frankish nobility, the granting of the right to bishops of deposing poor judges (if the king was unable at the time), and certain tax cuts and exemptions. Despite the exclusion of Jews from high office, their right to bring legal actions against Christians was preserved. Similarly, the right of a woman not to be married against her will was affirmed. 

The most famous of the twenty seven clauses of the Edict is almost certainly number twelve, in which Chlothar says in part that ''nullus iudex de aliis provinciis aut regionibus in alia loca ordinetur'', meaning that judges should be appointed only within their own regions. It has been interpreted as a concession, granting the magnates more control over appointments and the king less ability to influence, and conversely as a piece of anti-corruption legislation, intended to ease the penalisation of corrupt officers.

The Edict of Paris remained in force during the reign of his successor, [[Dagobert I|Dagobert]].

The '''Emergency Price Control Act of 1942''' is a [[United States Statutes at Large|United States statute]] imposing an [[Economic interventionism|economic intervention]] as restrictive measures to control [[Inflation|inflationary spiraling]] and [[Elasticity (economics)|pricing elasticity]] of [[Good (economics)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] while providing [[economic efficiency]] to support the United States national defense and security. The [[Act of Congress]] established the [[Office of Price Administration]] (OPA) as a federal independent agency being officially created by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on April 11, 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=16099 |title=Franklin D.

The H.R. 5990 [[Bill (law)|legislation]] was passed by the 77th U.S. Congressional session and enacted into law by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on January 30, 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=16192 |title=Franklin D. Roosevelt: "Statement on Signing the Emergency Price Control Act.," January 30, 1942 |author1=Peters, Gerhard |author2=Woolley, John T |work=The American Presidency Project |publisher=University of California - Santa Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions of the Act==
The Emergency Price Control Act was penned as three titles specifying rulings for [[price controls]] regarding [[Agricultural economics|agricultural commodities]], [[goods and services]], and [[real property]]. The Act provided authority for enforcement, investigative reporting, and reviews of [[Price fixing|price stabilization]] schedules by the Office of Price Administration. The law specified a time limit whereas orders, price schedules, regulations, and requirements by the Act were to terminate by June 30, 1943.

== Impact ==
The Emergency Price Control Act engendered significant controversy regarding delegation of Congressional power, executive wartime authority, and Congressional control of federal jurisdiction. Much of this stemmed from the Act's creation of the [[Emergency Court of Appeals]], an [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III]] court which had all "the powers of a district court with respect to the jurisdiction conferred on it," except it lacked the ability to issue temporary restraining orders or interlocutory decrees that would stay the effectiveness of any order, regulation, or price schedule issued by the Price Administrator of the Act. The Emergency Court had exclusive [[jurisdiction]] to hear complaints relating to actions of the Administrator ''except'' those relating to enjoining violations of the act/securing orders of compliance, treble damage actions, and criminal prosecutions for willful violations. For these, the Emergency Court shared jurisdiction with state courts. If anyone disagreed with an action taken by the Administrator (such as a price set), she would file a protest with the Administrator and if that was denied, she had thirty days to file a complaint with the Emergency Court. She could not file in any other district court, and the Emergency Court decisions were appealleable directly to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]].

Two important cases--''Lockerty v. Phillips'', 319 U.S. 182 (1943), and ''[[Yakus v. United States]]'', 321 U.S. 414 (1944)--continue to inform understandings of the relationship between [[United States Congress|Congress]] and the [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal judiciary system]].&lt;ref&gt;''See Richard H. Fallon, Jr. et al., Hart and Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal System'' 342-345 (7th ed. 2015). &lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Impact on the Understanding of Federal Courts ===
Federal Courts is the study of the relationship between [[State court (United States)|state courts]], [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal courts]], and the other [[Federal government of the United States|branches of government]]. The Emergency Price Control Act and the associated Emergency Court of Appeals raised several questions about the relationship between Congress and the Federal Judiciary: (1) Can Congress "[[Jurisdiction stripping|carve up]]" federal jurisdiction in this way? (2) If yes, is the creation of the Emergency Court--with all its limits--constitutional? To both questions, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] answered yes, though its understanding of the relationship between the legislative and judicial branches may have been informed by the exigencies of war.&lt;ref&gt;''See United States v. Mendoza-Lopez'', 481 U.S. 828, 839 n. 15 (1987) (distinguishing ''Yakus'' in part on the basis that it was during wartime, and holding that outside wartime, an enforcement court could not predicate a finding of a criminal violation on an administrative proceeding lacking due process).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Can Congress "Carve Up" Federal Jurisdiction? ====
In ''Lockerty v. Phillips'', 319 U.S. 182 (1943), several wholesale meat sellers sued to prevent the US Attorney from prosecuting them if they violated the price regulations. Among many arguments, one was that Congress lacked the authority to "carve up" jurisdiction in this form. Pursuant to the Act, the district court dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction. The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, writing that "[t]he Congressional power to ordain and establish inferior courts includes the power of investing them with jurisdiction either limited, concurrent, or exclusive, and of withholding jurisdiction from them in exact degrees and character which to Congress may seem proper for the public good." That is, what Congress can give--federal courts--Congress can take away, and therefore, limit as well, even if it was by issue.

Plaintiffs also argued that the Emergency Court was inadequate to protect their constitutional rights because the Emergency Court could not issue [[Interlocutory injunction|interlocutory relief]]. However, the Court declined to discuss whether the Emergency Court served as an adequate constitutional rights protector, noting that the Act had a [[severability]] clause that, in the event of the interlocutory relief section being found unconstitutional, other provisions would take effect, thus saving the Act.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;For a discussion on the clarity and forethought that went into authoring the Emergency Price Control Act, ''see generally'' Joseph W. Aldin, ''The Constitutionality of the 1942 Price Control Act'', 30 Cal. L. Rev. 648 (1942), http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3658&amp;context=californialawreview&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Is the Emergency Court of Appeals, With its Restrictions, Constitutional? ====
To understand this question, it is necessary to understand a bit about Article III. Article III does not ''require'' Congress to create lower federal courts, but when Congress does--as they did in the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]], establishing the federal court system we know today--they are subject to limitations emanating from Article III and other constitutional provisions. For example, Congress cannot prohibit all African Americans from bringing a lawsuit, as this would independently violate [[Equal Protection Clause|Equal Protection]] under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]]. In addition, Congress potential could not, for example, allow discrimination cases to only be filed in-person in the District Court of Puerto Rico, as this might substantially burden the ability of citizens to assert their constitutional rights. 

Plaintiffs in ''Lockerty'' also argued that the Emergency Court was inadequate to protect their constitutional rights because the Emergency Court could not issue interlocutory relief. However, the Court declined to discuss whether the Emergency Court served as an adequate constitutional rights protector, noting that the Act had a severability clause that, in the event of the interlocutory relief section being found unconstitutional, other provisions would take effect, thus saving the Act.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The Court did discuss the constitutionality of the Emergency Court's limits in ''[[Yakus v. United States]]'', 321 U.S. 414 (1944). While in ''Lockerty'' the Emergency Price Control Act was attacked ''offensively'', in ''Yakus'', the plaintiff--also a meat producer--had already been found to violate the Act. He was prosecuted under the Act with the potential for a criminal action. Yakus sought to raise the same issues as the plaintiffs in ''Lockerty'' (non-delegation--discussed below--due process (the inadequacy of the Emergency Court), and that the price was set too low), but does so by way of defenses for his action. 

The ''Yakus'' Court treated as the central issue to the case whether the Emergency Court review procedure "[[Due Process Clause|affords to those affected a reasonable opportunity to be heard and present evidence]]." Writing for the Court, [[Harlan F. Stone|Chief Justice Stone]] found that the Act did, and that there was "no denial of due process" in the statutory provisions that denied the ability of the Emergency Court to grant, among other things, temporary stays or injunctions. This was especially so because the alternatives (wartime inflation or requiring individuals to comply with a price regulation while its validity was still being determined), "Congress could constitutionally make the choice in favor of the protection of the public interest from the dangers of inflation." 

=== Impact on Administrative Law ===
''Yakus'' also questioned the constitutionality of the Emergency Price Control Act with respect to the [[nondelegation doctrine]], which governs when Congress can assign work to non-legislative bodies, such as the executive or judicial branches, and which work and to whom such work can be assigned. The resulting holding--which many believed to be in error--would alter American administrative jurisprudence for almost fifty years. 

The holding in ''Yakus''  was a major development of American nondelegation law. Chief Justice Stone argued that an administrative agency could self-correct a problem of delegation if it limited its own power:&lt;blockquote&gt;The standards prescribed by the present Act, with the aid of the "statement of the considerations" required to be made by the Administrator, are sufficiently definite and precise to enable Congress, the courts and the public to ascertain whether the administrator, in fixing the designated prices, has conformed to those standards . . . Hence we are unable to find in them an unauthorized delegation of legislative power. 321 U.S. at 426.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Thus, ''Yakus'' held that an administrative agency could "save" an otherwise ''unconstitutional'' delegation of power through a narrowing construction constraining that agency's own discretion. This would become a key principle in American constitutional law and would be followed by lower courts in striking down challenges to laws based on the [[nondelegation doctrine]] for the next fifty years. The ''Yakus'' principle was logically flawed however: how could an administrative agency ''itself'' cure a problem of delegation? The problem of delegation is one of excessive legislative power transferred to the executive branch--the delegation problem happens at the time of the passage of the statute. The act of an executive agency limiting that power is too late and does not correct the problem (it really only limits the problem). Allowing the agency to correct a delegation problem is liking locking the barn doors after all the horses have already escaped.

The Supreme Court came to this conclusion in ''[[Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, Inc.]]''. In so doing, [[Antonin Scalia|Justice Scalia]] denied that the Supreme Court had ever adopted such a stance on constitutional law: "We have never suggested that an agency can cure an unlawful delegation of legislative power by adopting in its discretion a limiting construction of the statute."

'''Extrajudicial punishment''' is [[punishment]] for an alleged crime or offense carried out without [[legal process]] or supervision from a [[court]] or [[tribunal]] through a [[legal proceeding]]. Such actions are carried out by state actors.

==Politically motivated==
Extrajudicial punishment is often a feature of [[political repression|politically repressive]] regimes, but even self-proclaimed or internationally recognized [[democracies]] have been known to use extrajudicial punishment under certain circumstances.

Although the legal use of [[capital punishment]] is generally decreasing around the world, individuals or groups deemed threatening&amp;mdash;or even simply "undesirable"&amp;mdash;to a government may nevertheless be targeted for punishment by a regime or its representatives. Such actions typically happen quickly, with security forces acting on a covert basis, performed in such a way as to avoid a massive public outcry and/or international criticism that would reflect badly on the state.  Sometimes, the killers are agents outside the government.  Criminal organizations, such as [[La Cosa Nostra]], have reportedly been employed for such a purpose.

Another possibility is for uniformed security forces to punish a victim, but under circumstances that make it appear as [[self-defense]] or suicide.  The former can be accomplished by planting recently fired weapons near the body, the latter by fabricating evidence suggesting suicide.  In such cases, it can be difficult to prove that the perpetrators acted wrongly. Because of the dangers inherent in armed confrontation, even police or soldiers who might strongly prefer to take an enemy alive may still kill to protect themselves or civilians, and potentially cross the line into [[extrajudicial murder]].

A [[forced disappearance]] (or enforced disappearance) occurs when a person is secretly abducted or imprisoned by a [[State (polity)|state]] or [[political organization]] or by a third party with the authorization, support, or acquiescence of a state or political organization, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the person's fate and whereabouts, with the intent of placing the victim outside the protection of the law.&lt;ref name="HenckaertsDoswald-Beck2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jean-Marie Henckaerts|author2=Louise Doswald-Beck|author3=[[International Committee of the Red Cross]] |title=Customary International Humanitarian Law: Rules|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ny1Dv3VNPYC&amp;pg=PA342|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-80899-6|page=342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extrajudicial punishment may be planned and carried out by a particular branch of a state, without informing other branches, or even without having been ordered to commit such acts. Other branches sometimes tacitly approve of the punishment after the fact.  They can also genuinely disagree with it, depending on the circumstances, especially when complex intragovernmental or internal policy struggles also exist within a state's policymaking apparatus.

In times of [[war]], [[natural disaster]], [[societal collapse]], or in the absence of an established system of [[criminal justice]], there may be increased incidences of extrajudicial punishment. In such circumstances, police or military personnel may be unofficially authorised to punish severely individuals involved in [[looting]], [[rioting]] and other violent acts, especially if caught ''[[in flagrante delicto]]''.  This position is sometimes itself corrupted, resulting in the death of merely ''inconvenient'' persons, that is, relative innocents who are just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

==Around the world==

===Previously===
The [[NKVD troika]]  and [[Special Council of the NKVD]]  are examples from the [[history of the Soviet Union]], where extrajudicial punishment "[[by administrative means]]" was part of the state policy. Other [[Soviet Bloc]] [[secret police]] organizations like the [[East German]] [[Stasi]], [[Romania]]n [[Securitate]] have also used it from time to time.

Most [[Latin America]]n [[dictatorship]]s have regularly instituted extrajudicial killings of their enemies; for one of the better-known examples, see ''[[Operation Condor]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3821/is_200610/ai_n17195860 | work=Journal of Third World Studies | title=Predatory States. Operation Condor and Covert War in Latin America/When States Kill. Latin America, the U.S., and Technologies of Terror | year=2006 | first=Ruth | last=Stanley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some{{citation needed|date=August 2009}} consider the killing of [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] [[Fred Hampton]] to have been an extrajudicial killing ordered by the [[United States government]]. Also, the US has been accused of exercising a covert prison system set up by the [[CIA]] in several countries, especially [[Egypt]], to evade US [[jurisdiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/01/AR2005110101644.html | work=The Washington Post | title=CIA Holds Terror Suspects in Secret Prisons | first=Dana | last=Priest | date=2005-11-02 | accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deaths of the leaders of the [[leftist]] [[urban guerrilla]] group, the [[Red Army Faction]], [[Ulrike Meinhof]], [[Andreas Baader]], [[Gudrun Ensslin]] and [[Jan-Carl Raspe]] in [[West Germany]] are regarded as extrajudicial killings by some of those in the German [[Far-left politics|radical left]] movements, a theory partly based on the testimony of [[Irmgard Möller]].

During the [[apartheid]] years [[South Africa|South Africa's]] security forces were also accused of using extrajudicial means to deal with their political opponents.{{citation needed|date=August 2009}} After his release, [[Nelson Mandela]] would refer to these acts as proof of a [[Third Force (South Africa)|Third Force]]. This was denied vehemently by the administration of [[F.W. de Klerk]]. Later the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission]], led by Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]] would find that both military and police agencies such as the [[Civil Cooperation Bureau]] and [[Vlakplaas|C10]] based at [[Vlakplaas]] were guilty of gross [[human rights violations]]. This led the [[International Criminal Court]] to declare apartheid a [[crime against humanity]].

===Currently===

In [[People's Republic of China|Mainland China]], a system of administrative detentions called [[Re-education through labor]] (''láodòng jiàoyǎng'' 劳动教养, abbreviated '''''láojiào''''' 劳教) is used to detain persons for minor crimes such as petty [[theft]], [[prostitution]], and trafficking [[illegal drug]]s for periods of up to four years. Re-education through labor sentences are given by police, rather than through the judicial system.

For many years, the [[Jamaican Constabulary Force]] has been noted for its [[extrajudicial]] killings.&lt;ref name=amnesty&gt;{{cite news

It has been discussed that the [[political abuse of psychiatry|use of psychiatric treatments to reduce unwanted behaviors]] can be seen as extrajudical punishments, due to many side-effects associated to these treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaapa.de/zwang2/halmi_english.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412101709/http://www.iaapa.de/zwang2/halmi_english.htm|title=Coercive psychiatry a torture system|archivedate=12 April 2010|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US has been known to employ extrajudicial tactics including [[Extraordinary Rendition]], the term "torture by proxy" is used by some critics to describe situations in which the [[CIA]]&lt;ref name="NYT-17-Feb-2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CIA-Background-Memo"&gt;"[https://www.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/082409/olcremand/2004olc97.pdf Background Paper on CIA's Combined Use of Interrogation Techniques]". 30 December 2004.

It has been claimed that torture has been employed with the knowledge or acquiescence of US agencies (a transfer of anyone to anywhere for the purpose of torture is a violation of US law), although [[Condoleezza Rice]] (then the [[United States Secretary of State]]) stated that:&lt;ref name=rice1&gt;{{cite web|title=Remarks of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice Upon Her Departure for Europe, 5 Dec 2005|url=http://2001-2009.state.gov/secretary/rm/2005/57602.htm|publisher=U.S. State Department|accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;the United States has not transported anyone, and will not transport anyone, to a country when we believe he will be tortured. Where appropriate, the United States seeks assurances that transferred persons will not be tortured.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The CIA has been accused of operating secret detention and interrogation centres known as [[black site]]s. These are allegedly located in countries other than the US, thus evading US laws as they are outside US jurisdiction.

An alleged code red case in the [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]] was the central theme in the award-winning [[Hollywood]] movie ''[[A Few Good Men]]'' starring [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Jack Nicholson]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1521">'''Francesco D'Andrea''' (1625–1698) was an [[Italy|Italian]] jurist and [[natural philosophy|natural philosopher]].

Born to a [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] family in [[Naples]], he worked as an [[advocate]] after obtaining his [[doctorate]] in law in 1641.  He was active in philosophical circles, including in the [[Accademia degli Investiganti]], which sought to promote modern natural philosophy and the thought of [[Descartes]]. In 1688, he was named a judge on the [[Vicaria]] tribunal, and later served as a legal advisor to the Neapolitan crown.

D'Andrea's legal writings focused on issues of [[constitutional law]] in the context of the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. He is best remembered for the ''Avvertimenti ai nipoti'' (1696), a collection of philosophical and practical advice for lawyers, and for the ''Apologia in difesa degli atomisti'' (1685), an influential [[Apologetics|apology]] of [[atomism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1762">'''Freedom of testation''' is the power of a person to make a [[will and testament]] specifying whatever heirs they please. It is historically associated with English [[common law]], and contrasted with [[forced heirship]], where part or all of the estate is automatically inherited by the [[next of kin]]. Opponents of absolute freedom of testation have pointed to the possibility of a widow or orphan being left destitute while property of a spouse or parent is bequeathed to others. Some opponents of [[inheritance tax]] have characterized it as an abrogation of freedom of testation.

==History==
After the [[Norman conquest of England]], the [[History of the Church of England#Medieval consolidation|Christian church]] succeeded in allowing a person to leave part of his property to the church to use them as funds for its activities.

In [[law of the Republic of Ireland]], the Succession Act 1965 reduces freedom of testation by guaranteeing provision for the spouse and children of the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1965/act/27/enacted/en/print#partix|title=Succession Act, 1965|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/DebatesWebPack.nsf/takes/seanad2005051700008#N14|title=Registration of Wills.|last=Callely|first=Ivor|date=17 May 2005|work=Seanad Éireann debates|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hermann Scheer 02.jpg|thumb|[[Hermann Scheer]] (2008), who together with [[Hans-Josef Fell]], helped develop the original EEG legislation in 1999&lt;ref name="bensmann-2010"/&gt;{{rp|4}}]]

The '''Renewable Energy Sources Act'''{{nnbsp}}{{efn|This is the official translation.  The act is also referred to as the '''Renewable Energy Act''' and the '''Renewable Energies Act'''.}} or '''EEG''' ({{lang-de|Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz}}) is a series of [[Germany|German]] laws that originally provided a [[feed-in tariff]] (FIT) scheme to encourage the generation of renewable electricity. The {{nowrap|EEG 2014}}&lt;ref name="eeg-2014"/&gt; specified the transition to an [[auction]] system for most technologies which has been finished with the current version EEG 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Presentation on the [http://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/EN/Downloads/eeg-novelle-2017-praesentation.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=2 2017 revision of the Renewable Energy Sources Act]&lt;/ref&gt;

The EEG first came into force on 1{{nbsp}}April 2000 and has been modified several times since. The original legislation guaranteed a grid connection, preferential dispatch, and a government-set feed-in tariff for 20{{nbsp}}years, dependant on the technology and size of project. The scheme was funded by a surcharge on electricity consumers, with electricity-intensive manufacturers and the railways later being required to contribute as little as 0.05{{nbsp}}¢/kWh. For 2017, the unabated EEG surcharge is {{val|6.88|u=¢|up=kWh}}.&lt;ref name="egenter-and-wettengel-2016"/&gt; In a study in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ovoenergy.com/guides/energy-guides/average-electricity-prices-kwh.html|publisher=OVO Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt; the average retail price of electricity in Germany, among the highest in the world, stood at around {{val|35|u=¢|up=kWh}}.

The EEG was preceded by the Electricity Feed-in Act (1991) which entered into force on 1{{nbsp}}January 1991. This law initiated the first [[Sustainable energy|green electricity]] feed-in tariff scheme in the world.&lt;ref name="luedeke-freund-and-opel-2014"/&gt;{{rp|439}} The original EEG is credited with a rapid uptake of [[wind power]] and [[photovoltaics]] (PV) and is regarded nationally and internationally as an innovative and successful [[energy policy]] measure.&lt;ref name="bensmann-2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jacobsson-and-lauber-2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="couture-etal-2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bruns-etal-2010"/&gt; The act also covers [[biomass]] (including [[cogeneration]]), [[hydroelectricity]], and [[geothermal energy]].

A significant revision to the EEG came into effect on 1{{nbsp}}August 2014. The prescribed feed-in tariffs will soon be gone for most technologies. Specific deployment corridors now stipulate the extent to which renewable electricity is to be expanded in the future and the funding rates will no longer be set by the government, but will be determined by [[auction]].&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015b"/&gt;{{rp|7}} Plant operators will market their production directly and will receive a market premium to make up the difference between the their bid price and the average monthly spot market price for electricity. The EEG surcharge remains in place to cover this shortfall. This new system is being rolled out in stages, starting with ground-mounted photovoltaics. More legislative revisions were scheduled for introduction on 1{{nbsp}}January 2017.{{Update inline|date=April 2018}}

The current EEG has been criticized for setting the deployment corridors (see [[#table-expansion-corridors|table]]) too low to meet Germany's long-term climate protection goals, particularly given the likely electrification of the transport sector. The government target for the share of renewables in power generation is at least 80% by 2050.&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015a"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

== Background ==
{{see also|Feed-in tariffs in Germany|Renewable energy in Germany}}
[[File:Energymix Germany.svg|thumb|400px|Development of the electricity mix in Germany 1990–2015 showing the growth in renewables&lt;ref name="ag-energiebilanzen-2015"/&gt;]]

The pioneer EEG (spanning 2001–2014) and its predecessor the Electricity Feed-in Act (1991) (spanning 1991–2001) class as [[feed-in tariff]] (FIT) schemes, a policy mechanism designed to accelerate the uptake of renewable energy technologies. The scheme offers long-term contracts to renewable energy producers, based on the cost of generation of the particular technology in question. In addition, a grid connection and preferential dispatch are also guaranteed. The tariffs (''Einspeisevergütungen'') themselves are funded by a levy or surcharge (''EEG-Umlage'') on electricity consumers, with electricity-intensive manufacturers being largely exempted. The EEG surcharge is based on the difference between the specified feed-in tariffs paid under the EEG and the sale of the renewable energy at the [[European Energy Exchange|EEX]] energy exchange by the grid operators (also known as [[transmission system operator]]s or TSO). {{as of|2016}}, the TSOs comprise [[50Hertz Transmission]], [[Amprion]], [[TenneT|Tennet TSO]], and [[:de:TransnetBW|TransnetBW]].

Amendments to the original EEG added the concept of a market premium in 2012. And the use of deployment corridors and [[auctions]] to set the levels of uptake and remuneration, respectively, in 2014.

The EEG has generally been regarded as a success. The EEG (2000) led to the particularly rapid uptake of two renewable energy technologies: [[wind power]] and [[photovoltaics]].&lt;ref name="jacobsson-and-lauber-2006"/&gt; The high growth of photovoltaics in Germany is set against its relatively poor solar resource.&lt;ref name="nrel-2008"/&gt; As the US NREL observed:

{{quote|Countries such as Germany, in particular, have demonstrated that FITs can be used as a powerful policy tool to drive renewable energy deployment and help meet combined energy security and emissions reductions objectives.|[[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]], 2010&lt;ref name="couture-etal-2010"/&gt;{{rp|v}}}}

The share of electricity from renewable energy sources has risen dramatically since the introduction of the EEG in 2000. The average annual growth rate is around 9{{nbsp}}billion kWh and almost all of this increase is due to electricity generation that qualifies for EEG payments.&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015c"/&gt;{{rp|26}} The EEG is also responsible for 88.3 Mt [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{CO2}}eq]] of avoided emissions in 2014, thus making a significant contribution to Germany's [[Climate change mitigation|climate protection]] targets.&lt;ref name="german-environment-agency-2015"/&gt;{{rp|2}} The following table summarizes the remarkable uptake of renewables and in particular photovoltaics:

Under the legislation, hydropower includes "wave, tidal, salinity gradient and marine current energy".&lt;ref name="eeg-2014"/&gt;{{rp|§{{nnbsp}}5(14)}} The use of [[biomass]] for electricity generation has also grown as a result of the EEG. Biomass includes: "[[biogas]], biomethane, [[landfill gas]] and sewage treatment gas and from the biologically degradable part of waste from households and industry".&lt;ref name="eeg-2014"/&gt;{{rp|§{{nnbsp}}5(14)}} [[Firedamp|Mine gas]] is in a separate category.

Germany's national energy policy is set out in the government's ''Energy Concept'' released on 28{{nbsp}}September 2010.&lt;ref name="bmu-2011"/&gt; On 6{{nbsp}}June 2011, following [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]], the government removed the use of nuclear power as a bridging technology and reintroduced a [[nuclear power phase-out#Germany|nuclear phase-out]].&lt;ref name="bmu-2011"/&gt; Boosting renewable electricity generation is an essential part of national policy (see [[#table-share-renewable-energy-gross-final-electricity|table]]).

The EEG is also a key element in the implementation of [[Renewable Energy Directive|EU Directive 2009/28/EC]] on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources.&lt;ref name="2009-28-ec"/&gt; This directive requires Germany to produce 18% of its gross final energy consumption (including heat and transport) from renewable energy sources by 2020.&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015c"/&gt;{{rp|6}} In this endeavour, the EEG is complemented by the Renewable Energies Heat Act (''Erneuerbare-Energien-Wärmegesetz'' or ''EEWärmeG'').&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015c"/&gt;{{rp|6}} A chart overviewing German energy [[legislation]] in 2016 is available.&lt;ref name="bmwi-2016b"/&gt;

== Legislation ==
The first discussions on feed-in tariffs in the German parliament began in the 1980s. The [[:de:Solarenergie-Förderverein Deutschland|Association for the Promotion of Solar Power]] (SFV), [[Eurosolar]], and the [[:de:Bundesverband deutscher Wasserkraftwerke|Federal Association of German Hydroelectric Power Plants]] (BDW) floated early concepts for a FIT scheme. The [[Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy|Economics Ministry]] and the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]]/[[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|CSU]] and [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] parties opposed non-market measures and argued for voluntary renewables quotas instead. In the late 1980s, CDU/CSU and [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green]] politicians drafted a feed-in tariff bill and sought parliamentary and external support. The newly formed [[Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety|Environment Ministry]] backed the proposal. The incumbent electricity producers did not devote much effort to counter the bill because they believed its effects would be minimal and their lobby effort was preoccupied with the takeover of the East German electricity system following [[German reunification]] in 1989. The bill became the Electricity Feed-in Act (1991).&lt;ref name="gruendinger-2016-ch6"/&gt;{{rp|227–228}}

Prior to the Electricity Feed-in Act, operators of small power plants could only obtain access to the grid at the behest of the grid owners and were sometimes refused entirely. Remuneration was based on the averted costs faced by the energy utilities, yielding low rates and unattractive investment conditions.&lt;ref name="gruendinger-2016-ch6"/&gt;{{rp|226}} Government support for renewable electricity before the act was primarily through [[Research and development|R&amp;D]] programs administered by the [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|Federal Ministry for Research and Technology]] (BMFT).&lt;ref name="held-etal-2010"/&gt;{{rp|3}}

=== Electricity Feed-in Act (1991) ===

Germany first began promoting renewable electricity using feed-in tariffs with the Electricity Feed-in Act (''Stromeinspeisungsgesetz'' or ''StrEG''). The long title is the law on feeding electricity from renewable energy sources into the public grid.&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015c"/&gt; The law entered into force on 1{{nbsp}}January 1991.&lt;ref name="kuehn-1999"/&gt;{{rp|4}} This legislation was the first [[Sustainable energy|green electricity]] feed-in tariff scheme in the world.&lt;ref name="luedeke-freund-and-opel-2014"/&gt;{{rp|439}} The law obliged grid companies to connect all renewable power plants, to grant them priority dispatch, and pay them a guaranteed feed-in tariff over 20{{nbsp}}years.&lt;ref name="gruendinger-2016-ch6"/&gt;{{rp|226}}

While the Electricity Feed-in Act did much to promote wind power, the installed capacity of photovoltaic installations remained low (see [[#table-electricity-generation|table]]).&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015c"/&gt;{{rp|10}}&lt;ref name="kuehn-1999"/&gt; The remuneration for photovoltaics was simply too little in most settings. Low-interest loans were then offered under additional government programs.&lt;ref name="gruendinger-2016-ch6"/&gt;{{rp|226}}

Beginning in 1998, the Electricity Feed-in Act was challenged under European Union [[subsidy|anti-subsidy]] rules by [[PreussenElektra]] (an [[E.ON]] predecessor). The [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ) found that the arrangements did not constitute [[state aid]]. The court concluded:

{{quote|Statutory provisions of a Member State which, first, require private electricity supply undertakings to purchase electricity produced in their area of supply from renewable energy sources at minimum prices higher than the real economic value of that type of electricity, and, second, distribute the financial burden resulting from that obligation between those electricity supply undertakings and upstream private electricity network operators do not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 92(1) of the EC Treaty.|[[European Court of Justice]], Luxembourg, 13{{nbsp}}March 2001&lt;ref name="preussenelektra-case-2001"/&gt;{{rp|29–30}}}}

The Electricity Feed-in Act suffered from structural flaws. First, the coupling of feed-in tariffs to the electricity price proved too volatile to ensure investment security. Second, the distribution of burdens was uneven, with grid operators in high-wind regions having to pay out more.&lt;ref name="gruendinger-2016-ch6"/&gt;{{rp|229}} In light of this latter concern, the act was amended in 1998 to introduce, among other things, a double 5% cap on feed-in purchases.&lt;ref name="kuehn-1999"/&gt;{{rp|5}} This ceiling slowed uptake in some regions.

The Electricity Feed-in Act was enacted by a [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]]/[[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|CSU]]/[[Social Democratic Party of Germany|FDP]] coalition [[List of Federal Republic of Germany governments#12th Bundestag|government]].

=== Renewable Energy Sources Act (2000) ===

The Electricity Feed-in Act was replaced by the Renewable Energy Sources Act (2000), also known as the EEG (2000), and came into force on 1{{nbsp}}April 2000. The legislation is available in English.&lt;ref name="bmu-2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eeg-2000-in-solar-energy-2001"/&gt; The long title is an act on granting priority to renewable energy sources. The three principles of the act are:

* '''Investment protection through guaranteed feed-in tariffs and connection requirement'''. Every kilowatt-hour generated from a renewable electricity facility receives a confirmed technology-specific feed-in tariff for 20{{nbsp}}years. Grid operators are required to preferentially dispatch this electricity over electricity from conventional sources like nuclear power, coal, and gas. As a result, [[small and medium enterprises]] were given new access to the electricity system, along with energy cooperatives (''Genossenschaft''), farmers, and households.
* '''No charge to German public finances'''. The remuneration payments are not considered [[subsidy|public subsidies]] since they are not derived from taxation but rather through an EEG surcharge on electricity consumers. In 2015, the aggregate EEG surcharge totalled €21.8{{nbsp}}billion and the EEG surcharge itself was 6.17{{nbsp}}¢/kWh.&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015c"/&gt;{{rp|29}} The EEG surcharge can be substantially reduced for electricity-intensive industries under the 'special equalization scheme' (''Besonderen Ausgleichsregelung'') (introduced in a 2003 amendment).&lt;ref name="german-energy-blog-1"/&gt;
* '''Innovation by decreasing feed-in-tariffs'''. The [[Feed-in tariffs in Germany|feed-in tariffs]] decrease at regular intervals to exert a downwards cost pressure on plant operators and technology manufacturers. This decrease, known as a 'degression', applies to new installations. It is expected that technologies become more cost efficient with time and the legislation captures this view:

{{quote|The compensation rates ... have been determined by means of scientific studies, subject to the provision that the rates identified should make it possible for an installation – when managed efficiently – to be operated cost-effectively, based on the use of [[state-of-the-art]] technology and depending on the renewable energy sources naturally available in a given geographical environment.|Renewable Energy Sources Act (2000)&lt;ref name="bmu-2000"/&gt;{{rp|16}}}}

Unlike the preceding Electricity Feed-in Act, feed-in tariffs were now specified in absolute terms and no longer tied to the prevailing electricity price. The tariffs also differentiated between scale (larger plants received less) and electricity yield (wind turbines in low-wind areas received more). The new tariffs were based on cost-recovery plus profit and increased substantially. For instance, photovoltaic remuneration rose from 8.5{{nbsp}}¢/kWh to a maximum of 51{{nbsp}}¢/kWh. [[Offshore wind power|Offshore wind]], [[geothermal energy]], and [[Coalbed methane|mine gas]] were included for the first time. The concept of an annual reduction or 'degression' was introduced, with annual degression rates varying between 1% for biomass and 5% for photovoltaics. Photovoltaics installations were capped at 350{{nbsp}}MW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;{{efn|MW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; refers to peak megawatts, the output from a photovoltaic installation under standard test conditions.  See [[nominal power (photovoltaic)]].}} to control costs (later raised to 1000{{nbsp}}MW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; in 2002 and removed in 2004).&lt;ref name="gruendinger-2016-ch6"/&gt;{{rp|230–231}}

The new act introduced a nationwide compensation scheme with the aim of spreading the remuneration burden on grid operators across all electricity utilities. This included a new EEG surcharge (''EEG-Umlage'') to fund the feed-in remunerations. The previous double-5% cap was duly removed.&lt;ref name="gruendinger-2016-ch6"/&gt;{{rp|231}}

The new act also introduced the [[:de:100.000-Dächer-Programm|100,000 roofs program]] (''100.000-Dächer-Programm''). This ran until 2003 and offered low-interest loans for photovoltaic installations below 300{{nbsp}}MW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. It proved highly successful in combination with the FIT scheme and led to a rapid increase in photovoltaic capacity.&lt;ref name="gruendinger-2016-ch6"/&gt;{{rp|231}}

The first EEG amendment, effective from 16{{nbsp}}July 2003, introduced the 'special equalisation scheme' (''Besondere Ausgleichsregelung''), designed to unburden electricity-intensive industries from the rising EEG surcharge. To be eligible, companies had to fulfil the following criteria: electricity consumption of more than 100{{nbsp}}GWh/a, electricity expenses of more than 20% of gross value added, and a considerable impairment of competitiveness. Exempted firms pay only 0.05{{nbsp}}¢/kWh. As a result, non-privileged consumers faced a higher EEG surcharge. Arbitration on eligibility was by the [[Federal Office of Economics and Export Control]] (''Bundesamt für Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle'').&lt;ref name="gruendinger-2016-ch6"/&gt;{{rp|241–242}}

The EEG was built on experience gained under the Electricity Feed-in Act. Without the prior act, the EEG would not have been as sophisticated or as far reaching. Notwithstanding, the [[Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy|Economics Ministry]] remained hostile to the concept of feed-in tariffs and refused to help with legal drafting.&lt;ref name="gruendinger-2016-ch6"/&gt;{{rp|240}}

An [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]/[[Alliance '90/The Greens|Greens]] coalition [[List of Federal Republic of Germany governments#14th Bundestag|government]], elected in 1998, paved the way for the reform of the Electricity Feed-in Act to give the EEG (2000).

=== PV Interim Act (2003) ===

The PV Interim Act (2003) raised photovoltaic tariffs from 1{{nbsp}}January 2004 and in particular for small rooftop installations, to compensate for the ending of low-interest loans under the expiring 100,000 roofs program. The limit on free-standing photovoltaic systems exceeding 100{{nbsp}}kW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and the 1000{{nbsp}}MW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; cap on photovoltaic installations in total were both removed.&lt;ref name="gruendinger-2016-ch6"/&gt;{{rp|243–244}}

=== Renewable Energy Sources Act (2004) ===

An amended version of the EEG came into force on 1{{nbsp}}August 2004. While the basic framework remained unchanged, this act introduced a substantially modified and differentiated tariff structure, to better match the economic viabilities of the technologies concerned. Tariffs for biomass, photovoltaics, and geothermal energy were increased. Detailed measures were introduced to deal with market complexities, windfall profits, and the incentives for innovation and cost reduction. Eligible projects may no longer degrade ecologically sensitive areas. Exemptions for industry from the EEG surcharge under the special equalization scheme were extended considerably. The minimum electricity consumption requirement was reduced to 10{{nbsp}}GWh/a, the share of electricity costs relative to gross value added was reduced to 15%, and the impairment of competitiveness criteria was removed altogether. [[Rail transport|Railways]] were now automatically exempt, being regarded as an environmentally friendly form of transport.&lt;ref name="gruendinger-2016-ch6"/&gt;{{rp|245–247}}

Renewable targets were now defined in the act for the first time: 12.5% for the share of renewable energy in gross final electricity consumption by 2010 and at least 20% by 2020.&lt;ref name="gruendinger-2016-ch6"/&gt;{{rp|245}}

Thus the EEG (2004) resulted in significantly better conditions for photovoltaics, biomass (including small farm systems and new technologies), offshore wind, and geothermal energy, while onshore wind and small hydroelectric plant largely retained their former standing. The new special equalization scheme lead to wider benefits for industry. Only about 40 companies complied under the previous rules, mostly from the chemical, steel, and metals industries. That number climbed to between 120 and 350 with the new rules.&lt;ref name="gruendinger-2016-ch6"/&gt;{{rp|250}}

The [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme]] (EU{{nbsp}}ETS) entered into effect on 1{{nbsp}}January 2005. Many industry lobbyists argued that the emissions trading transcended the need for a renewable electricity feed-in tariff scheme and that the EEG should therefore be scrapped.&lt;ref name="gruendinger-2016-ch6"/&gt;{{rp|250}} In December 2005 the [[European Commission]] released a report preferring feed-in tariffs for national renewable electricity support.&lt;ref name="european-commission-2005"/&gt;

The 2004 legislation was overseen by an [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]/[[Alliance '90/The Greens|Greens]] coalition [[List of Federal Republic of Germany governments#15th Bundestag|government]].

=== Renewable Energy Sources Act (2009) ===

The 2009 amendments were undertaken alongside a boom in renewable electricity uptake. In 2009, renewables accounted for 16.3% of total electricity generation, up from 9.3% in 2004.&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015c"/&gt;{{rp|10}} Over the same period, the EEG surcharge climbed from 0.54{{nbsp}}¢/kWh to 1.32{{nbsp}}¢/kWh.&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015c"/&gt;{{rp|29}} For further context, the [[European Union climate and energy package]], approved on 17{{nbsp}}December 2008, contained a year 2020 national target for Germany of 18% renewable energy in its total energy consumption.

The 2009 amendments yielded improvements for the entire range of renewables, increased the renewables target considerably, introduced new sustainability criteria for bioenergy, and extended industry privileges.&lt;ref name="gruendinger-2016-ch6"/&gt;{{rp|221}} Flexible degression rates were also introduced, which can now be adjusted without reference to the [[Bundestag]].&lt;ref name="klein-etal-2010"/&gt;{{rp|23}} The legislation came into force on 1{{nbsp}}January 2009.

More specifically, the photovoltaic tariffs were reduced somewhat, but not enough to affect uptake. The degression for PV was tightened from 5% to 8–10%, depending on the size of installation. A new 'self-consumption incentive' granted a fixed tariff of 25.01{{nbsp}}¢/kWh for electricity consumed by a PV operator within their own house. A 'flexible degression cap' was introduced, under which the degression rate could be adjusted to keep the uptake of photovoltaics within a specified corridor. The support for onshore wind improved. The initial tariff was raised, the repowering (when old turbines are replaced by new) bonus (''Repoweringbonus'') was increased, and an additional system service bonus was granted for specified technical contributions (''Systemdienstleistungen'' or ''SDL''), including the ability to maintain voltage if the transmission grid fails. The tariff for offshore wind was raised substantially. An additional 'early starter bonus' was offered for offshore wind farms entering operation before 2015. In parallel to the EEG, a separate loan program of €5 billion was established, to be administered by the state-owned [[KfW]] bank, with the goal of reaching 25{{nbsp}}GW installed capacity for wind by 2030. Support of biomass was also increased, with special bonuses for a number of different biomass types. Biomass must also comply with specified ecological requirements to be eligible, these requirements being contained in a separate 'sustainability ordinance' (''Nachhaltigkeitsverordnung'' or ''BioSt-NachV''). The hydroelectricity tariffs were raised considerably and particularly for micro and small power plants. The tariffs for geothermal energy were raised considerably too, as was the cogeneration bonus. An additional 'early starter bonus' was introduced for geothermal projects put into operation before 2016. A 'green power privilege' (''Grünstromprivileg'') was introduced, which exempted electricity suppliers with a minimum quota of renewables from the EEG surcharge under certain circumstances. New measures allowed grid operators to temporarily limit wind turbine output in times of network congestion, with compensation payable to the plant owner for lost remuneration.&lt;ref name="gruendinger-2016-ch6"/&gt;{{rp|264–266}}

The renewable targets in the new law were increased to at least 35% (previously 20%) of total electricity production by 2020, 50% by 2030, 65% by 2040, and 80% by 2050.

The 2009 legislation was overseen by a [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]]/[[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|CSU]]/[[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] [[grand coalition]] [[List of Federal Republic of Germany governments#16th Bundestag|government]].

The government launched its national ''Energy Concept'' in September 2010.&lt;ref name="bmwi-and-bmu-2010"/&gt; This represents a significant milestone in the development of energy policy in Germany. On 6{{nbsp}}June 2011, following [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]], the government removed the use of nuclear power as a bridging technology as part of their policy.&lt;ref name="bmu-2011"/&gt;

=== PV Act (2010) ===

It was becoming clear that action on the photovoltaic remuneration was necessary. The growth in photovoltaics had exceeded all expectations. In 2009 alone, {{val|10600}}{{nbsp}}MW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; of capacity was installed. As a result, the support costs had skyrocketed.&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015c"/&gt;{{rp|12}}

The government responded with the PV Act (2010) which entered into force retrospectively with effect from 1{{nbsp}}July 2010. The legislation introduced a dramatic reduction in photovoltaic tariffs, cutting these between 8 and 13% depending on the installation type, followed by a second cut of 3%. The deployment corridor was doubled to between 2500 and 3500{{nbsp}}MW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, along with tighter growth-dependant degression rates of 1–12%, in addition to the ordinary degression of 9%. The self-consumption incentive was significantly raised to around 8{{nbsp}}¢/kWh and eligibility extended to systems up to 500{{nbsp}}kW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. The feed-in rate itself was dependent on the system size and the proportion of demand that was consumed on-site. Free-standing systems were excluded from using agricultural land.&lt;ref name="gruendinger-2016-ch6"/&gt;{{rp|281–282}}

=== PV Interim Act (2011) ===

The PV Interim Act (2011) introduced the possibility of further downward adjustments for the photovoltaic tariffs during the year. If the installed capacity during the first months of the year exceeded the equivalent of 3,500 MW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; per year, feed-in tarifffs would be lowered by 1{{nbsp}}July 2011 for rooftop systems and 1{{nbsp}}September 2011 for free-standing systems. It also modified the flexible cap to better control the growth of photovoltaics.&lt;ref name="gruendinger-2016-ch6"/&gt;{{rp|291}}

In application of the EEG (2009) version in force at the time,&lt;ref&gt;Renewable Energy Sources Act 2009, as amended in 12 April 2011, §20 (4). [https://www.clearingstelle-eeg-kwkg.de/files/EEG_2009_juris_Stand_110501.pdf pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; no further adjustment to the feed-in tariffs occurred in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grau|first=Thilo|date=2014|title=Responsive feed-in tariff adjustment to dynamic technology development|url=https://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeeeneeco/v_3a44_3ay_3a2014_3ai_3ac_3ap_3a36-46.htm|journal=Energy Economics|volume=44|issue=C|pages=36–46|issn=0140-9883}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is explained because the installed capacity between 28 February 2011 and 1 June 2011 was less than 875 MW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; (which multiplied by 4, is below the 3,500 MWp threshold).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Sachgebiete/Energie/Unternehmen_Institutionen/ErneuerbareEnergien/Photovoltaik/ArchivDatenMeldgn/DegressionsVergSaetzeJuliSept2011_pdf.html|title=Degression rate and feed-in tariffs for July and September 2011|last=|first=Bundesnetzagentur|date=|website=www.bundesnetzagentur.de|language=de|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renewable Energy Sources Act (2012) ===

The act was again modified and came into force on 1{{nbsp}}January 2012. The new EEG sought to advance the dynamic expansion of renewable electricity generation, control the rising costs associated with the scheme, and enhance market and grid integration, while adhering to the principles of a feed-in system. The revised system includes a market premium scheme, the market premium was intended to prepare renewables for the market and to eventually lower their dependence on explicit policy measures.&lt;ref name="german-energy-blog-1"/&gt;

The rising shares of [[Variable renewable energy|variable renewable generation]] had led to concerns about the ability of the electricity system to cope. The new act included measures for the grid integration of photovoltaic systems. Grid operators could now limit the feed-in of photovoltaics in times of grid overload, with the plant operators receiving compensation for their loss of revenue. A new ordinance required the retrofitting of photovoltaic systems to avoid the 50.2{{nbsp}}Hz problem – the risk of widespread blackouts as PV systems simultaneously tripped in the face of frequencies above 50.2{{nbsp}}Hz.&lt;ref name="german-energy-blog-4"/&gt; Free-standing photovoltaic systems on nature conservation areas were excluded from remuneration. The tariff structure for onshore wind was basically maintained, but the degression was tightened from 1% to 1.5% to incentivize efficiency improvements. The system services bonus for onshore wind was extended and the repowering bonus was improved. Offshore wind gained through improved early starter provisions. The start of the degression was postponed until 2018, but increased from 5% to 7%. Starter tariffs were increased but now last 8 rather than 12{{nbsp}}years. Biomass tariffs were lowered by 10–15% on average, particularly for small systems. The biomass tariff system itself was greatly simplified, with now four size categories and two fuel categories. The degression for biomass was increased from 1% to 2%. The tariffs for hydroelectricity were simplified, the funding period now uniformly 20{{nbsp}}years, and the degression rate set at 1%. The tariffs for geothermal energy were raised and the start of the degression postponed until 2018, albeit at an increased rate. Electricity storage facilities were fully exempted from grid charges and are to be supported by a special research program.&lt;ref name="gruendinger-2016-ch6"/&gt;{{rp|292–294}}

Industry privileges under the special equalisation scheme were extended to include more companies and the tariff reductions further improved. The eligibility requirements were lowered from 10{{nbsp}}GWh/a to 1{{nbsp}}GWh/a and the electricity expenses threshold in terms of gross value added lowered from 15% to 14%. As a result, the number of exempt firms rose from 734 in 2012 to about 2057 in 2013. The exempted electricity load rose from 84.7{{nbsp}}TWh to 97{{nbsp}}TWh, a relatively modest increase due to the smaller sizes of the newly exempted firms.&lt;ref name="gruendinger-2016-ch6"/&gt;{{rp|294}}

Industrial self-consumption, previously exempted from the EEG surcharge, was now subject to the surcharge if the public grid was used, except in special circumstances. This measure was aimed at preventing abuse through contracting.&lt;ref name="gruendinger-2016-ch6"/&gt;{{rp|294}}

The introduction of an optional market premium was designed to support demand-oriented electricity generation. The market premium is the difference between the EEG tariff and the average spot market price. An additional management premium reimbursed administration costs and mitigated against market risks. For large biogas plants over 750{{nbsp}}kW, the use of direct marketing was made compulsory from 2014 onwards. An additional flexibility premium was introduced for gas storage at biogas facilities. The details of the market premium were to be provided in a following governmental directive, following parliamentary approval.&lt;ref name="gruendinger-2016-ch6"/&gt;{{rp|294}}

The green power privilege was also modified. Energy suppliers whose portfolio comprised more than 50% EEG-funded renewables had their surcharge reduced by 2{{nbsp}}¢/kWh, previously they had been fully exempt. In addition, a minimum share of 20% of fluctuating sources, namely wind and PV, was required.&lt;ref name="gruendinger-2016-ch6"/&gt;{{rp|294–295}}

The renewables targets remained unchanged and are identical to those specified in the 2010 ''Energy Concept''.&lt;ref name="bmu-2011"/&gt;

In 2013, after numerous complaints, the [[European Commission]] opened an in-depth [[state aid]] investigation into the EEG surcharge exemptions for energy-intensive companies and into the green power privilege.&lt;ref name="german-energy-blog-6"/&gt; The Commission nonetheless accepted that the underlying feed-in tariff and market premium schemes were compliment. On 10{{nbsp}}May 2016 the [[General Court (European Union)|EU General Court]] sided with the Commission and determined that the EEG (2012) involved state aid as indicated.&lt;ref name="eeg-2012-case-2016"/&gt; (The next EEG (2014) was specifically designed to resolve these difficulties.)&lt;ref name="german-energy-blog-12"/&gt;

The 2012 legislation was overseen by a [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]]/[[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|CSU]]/[[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] coalition [[List of Federal Republic of Germany governments#17th Bundestag|government]].

=== PV Act (2013) ===

Despite the cutbacks in photovoltaic support, photovoltaic installations continued to boom. In December 2011 alone, 3000{{nbsp}}MW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; were added in an effort to beat the tariff reductions beginning in 2012.&lt;ref name="gruendinger-2016-ch6"/&gt;{{rp|306}} Moreover, the EEG surcharge had grown to 3.53{{nbsp}}¢/kWh for 2011, with the largest component being photovoltaic remuneration.&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015c"/&gt;{{rp|29}} The EEG surcharge was projected to grow considerably, despite the falling tariff structure. For the first time, cost control became the "determining factor" in the political debate over the EEG.&lt;ref name="gruendinger-2016-ch6"/&gt;{{rp|307}}

This was despite the fact that the [[merit order]] effect had been depressing electricity [[Spot market|spot prices]]. The merit order effect occurs when preferentially dispatched wind and photovoltaic generation displaces more expensive [[fossil fuel]] generation from the margin – often gas-fired [[combined cycle]] plant – thereby driving down the cleared price. This effect is more pronounced for photovoltaics because their midday peak correlates with the maximum generation requirement on the system. The merit order effect also lowers the revenues for conventional power plants and makes them less economically viable. A 2007 study finds that "in the case of the year 2006, the volume of the merit order effect exceeds the volume of the net support payments for renewable electricity generation which have to be paid by consumers".&lt;ref name="sensfuss-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|i}} A 2013 study estimates the merit order effect of both wind and photovoltaic electricity generation for the years 2008–2012: the combined merit order effect of wind and photovoltaics ranges from 0.5{{nbsp}}¢/kWh in 2010 to more than 1.1{{nbsp}}¢/kWh in 2012.&lt;ref name="cludius-etal-2013"/&gt;{{rp|3}}

The PV Act (2013) came into force retrospectively on 1{{nbsp}}April 2012. The tariff cuts were up to 30%, with the tariff cuts scheduled in the EEG (2012) for 1{{nbsp}}July 2012 advanced and tightened from their original 15%. The system size categories were changed, now up to 10, 40, 1000, and {{val|10000}}{{nbsp}}kW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. A new category of 10–40{{nbsp}}kW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; was introduced, while free-standing systems were limited to 10{{nbsp}}MW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. The regular standard degression was set to 1% per month, equal to 11.4% per year, and replacing the previous six-monthly adjustment. The flexible cap for the deployment corridor remained unchanged at 2500 to 3500{{nbsp}}MW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; per year. If new additions exceed this corridor, the degression rises by 1.0% up to 2.8%. A hard cap on the total photovoltaic capacity was introduced, set at 52{{nbsp}}GW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. The self-consumption privilege was removed for new installations, as grid parity was already met: the feed-in tariff for roof systems at 19.5{{nbsp}}¢/kWh was now lower than the average electricity price for households at 23{{nbsp}}¢/kWh. Changes to the market integration model reduced the eligibility for remuneration of systems between 10 and 1000{{nbsp}}kW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; to 90% of their electricity production from 2014 onwards. The residual electricity could either be self-consumed or sold on the electricity market.&lt;ref name="gruendinger-2016-ch6"/&gt;{{rp|309}}

=== Renewable Energy Sources Act (2014) ===

The EEG (2014) is sometimes known as the EEG{{nbsp}}2.0 due to its marked departure from earlier legislation.&lt;ref name="german-energy-blog-1"/&gt; This revision took effect from 1{{nbsp}}August 2014. The act is available in English.&lt;ref name="eeg-2014"/&gt; The act requires operators of new plant to market their electricity themselves. In turn they receive a market premium from the grid operator to compensate for the difference between the fixed EEG payment and the average [[Spot market|spot price]] for electricity.&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015c"/&gt;{{rp|28}} The act also paved the way for a switch from specified feed-in tariffs to a system of tendering.&lt;ref name="appunn-2014"/&gt;

The purpose of the EEG (2014) is stated in the legislation:

{{quote|The purpose of this Act is to enable the energy supply to develop in a sustainable manner in particular in the interest of mitigating climate change and protecting the environment, to reduce the costs to the economy not  least  by including long-term external effects, to conserve fossil energy resources and to promote the further development of technologies to generate electricity from renewable energy sources.|§{{nnbsp}}1(1){{nbsp}}Renewable Energy Sources Act (2014)&lt;ref name="eeg-2014"/&gt;{{rp|6}}}}

The EEG (2014) also contains statutory targets for the share of renewable energy in gross final electricity consumption (the targets are additional to those set out in the government's 2010 ''Energy Concept'' statement&lt;ref name="bmu-2011"/&gt;):

==== Details ====
The level of remuneration is still prescribed under the EEG until 2017. However the way that new installations receive their remuneration has changed. Most plant operators must now directly market their output, for which they get an additional market premium payment instead of an explicit feed-in tariff. This premium is the difference between the average monthly wholesale price at the [[European Energy Exchange|EEX]] energy exchange and the fixed remuneration stated in the EEG. Installations under 100{{nbsp}}kW are exempt from these provisions and existing installations will continue to operate under the rules under which they were established. From 2014–2017 onwards, defined remuneration rates will be replaced by competitive bidding, also known as auctions or tenders. Those investors offering the lowest prices will then receive support.&lt;ref name="appunn-2014"/&gt; The new act does not specify the auction model in detail, but potential designs were piloted in 2015 using ground-mounted photovoltaic systems.&lt;ref name="amelang-and-appunn-2016b"/&gt;

The flexible cap mechanism for expansion corridors was replaced with set annual targets for the addition of wind, photovoltaic, and biogas capacity. The government hopes these new corridors will lead to a better coordination between renewables and the use and expansion of the [[Electric power transmission|transmission network]], as well as improving planning security for conventional generators.&lt;ref name="appunn-2014"/&gt;

The target corridor for photovoltaics is set at 2.4 to 2.6{{nbsp}}GW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; per year and the hard cap of 52{{nbsp}}GW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; (introduced in 2013) remains in place. Photovoltaic installations beyond this upper bound will not receive funding under the EEG. The remuneration for photovolatic installations is reduced 0.50 percent every month, unless the installed capacity in the preceding months is below or above the installed capacity target.&lt;ref name="eeg-2014" /&gt; The degression rate can increase or decrease according to the deviation from the 2,500 MW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; goal during the twelve months prior to the beginning of each quarter.&lt;ref name="eeg-2014" /&gt; The corresponding degression rate is then used during the three months of the quarter, in the following way:&lt;ref name="eeg-2014" /&gt;

* If installed capacity exceeds the target by more than 4,900 MW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, feed-in tariff decreases 2.80 percent
** by more than 3,900 MW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, 2.50 percent,
** by more than 2,900 MW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, 2.20 percent,
** by more than 1,900 MW&lt;sub&gt;p,&lt;/sub&gt; 1.80 percent,
** by more than 900 MW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, 1.40 percent,
** by up to 900 MW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, 1.00 percent.
* If installed capacity falls between 2,400 and 2,600 MW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, the feed-in tariff decreases 0.50 percent.
* If installed capacity is below the target by less than 900 MW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, feed-in tariff decreases 0.25 percent
** by more than 900 MW&lt;sub&gt;p,&lt;/sub&gt; the feed-in tariff remains the same,
** by more than 1,400 MW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, to zero; the feed-in tariff may rise on a one-off basis by 1.50 percent on the first calendar day of the respective quarter.

Onshore wind retained its annual target of 2.4 to 2.6{{nbsp}}GW. However the target now excludes repowering, effectively extending the growth cap. The management premium and the bonus paid to wind farms providing stabilizing features (''Systemdienstleistungen'') are now being phased out. From 2016 onwards, the onshore wind tariff is reduced quarterly, depending on whether new capacity tracks the prescribed target. For offshore wind, the new act defines a target of 6.5{{nbsp}}GW by 2020 and 15{{nbsp}}GW by 2030. Offshore wind farms that entered service before 2020 can choose between a fixed payment for 8 years or a reduced payment for 12 years. After this period, the basic reward is reduced still further, depending on the distance from shore and the depth of the sea. The biomass target is set at 0.1{{nbsp}}GW per year. Only biogas plants that use biowaste and liquid manure will receive more than the standard remuneration, depending on their capacity. Tariffs are to be reduced by 0.5% on a three-monthly basis for new installations.&lt;ref name="appunn-2014" /&gt;

On 16{{nbsp}}April 2014 the European Commission found that EEG (2014) support for 20 offshore wind farms totalling almost 7{{nbsp}}GW was not [[state aid]].&lt;ref name="german-energy-blog-11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="european-commission-press-release-2015"/&gt; On 23{{nbsp}}July 2014 the [[European Commission]] approved the EEG (2014), having assessed it to be in line with EU rules on state aid.&lt;ref name="european-commission-press-release-2014b"/&gt; Indeed, the EEG (2014) was the first revision of the Renewable Energy Sources Act to be "materially shaped by the Commission's view on state aid".&lt;ref name="german-energy-blog-12"/&gt;

In July 2015 the [[Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy|Economics and Energy Ministry]] (BMWi) released a design document covering renewables auctions.&lt;ref name="klessmann-etal-2015"/&gt; In early 2016 the BMWi reported that the ground-mounted photovoltaics tender pilot, comprising three auction in 2015, was successful. The BMWi also stated that the competition was high and that prices fell from round to round. It added that small bidders were able to win tenders. These results will be used to develop auctions for other renewable electricity generation technologies.&lt;ref name="amelang-and-appunn-2016b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bmwi-2016a"/&gt;

The sixth and last round of PV auctions under this particular legislation produced 27{{nbsp}}successful bids totaling {{val|163|u=MW}}. The average successful price was {{val|6.9|ul=¢|up=kWh}} and the lowest awarded price was {{val|6.26|ul=¢|up=kWh}}. These figures confirm a falling trend from auction to auction.&lt;ref name="clew-2016c"/&gt;&lt;ref name="federal-network-agency-2016"/&gt;

The 2014 legislation was overseen by a [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]]/[[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|CSU]]/[[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] [[grand coalition]] [[List of Federal Republic of Germany governments#18th Bundestag|government]].

=== Renewable Energy Sources Act (2017) ===

The government began again to update of the EEG, first dubbed the EEG (2016), now the EEG (2017). The revised act is slated to take effect from 1{{nbsp}}January 2017.&lt;ref name="amelang-and-appunn-2016a"/&gt;

The following explains some of the process prior to the final legislation. On 8{{nbsp}}December 2015 the government released its proposals for reform.&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015d"/&gt; On 8{{nbsp}}June 2016 the [[Cabinet of Germany|Federal Cabinet]] (''Bundeskabinett'') cleared the draft EEG (2016) bill.&lt;ref name="german-energy-blog-13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eeg-draft-bill-2016"/&gt; That bill will now go to the [[Bundestag]] and [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] for consideration.&lt;ref name="bmwi-2016c"/&gt;

The reform is being driven by three guiding principles, namely the need:&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015d"/&gt;{{rp|1–2}}

* "to keep within agreed deployment corridors for the development of renewable energy"
* "to keep to a minimum the overall cost arising from the Renewable Energy Sources Act"
* "to use auctions to create a level playing field for all of the players involved"

The government believes that the new auction system will control costs. The new system also accords with the desire of the European Commission for renewables support to be market-based.&lt;ref name="european-commission-press-release-2014a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="european-commission-2014"/&gt; With regard to wind energy, the new rules are intended to encourage installations in sites with strong winds and across Germany. To this end, a suite of complex calculations (''Referenzertragsmodell'') are being developed to ensure that bids are comparable and payments are fair.&lt;ref name="appunn-2016"/&gt;

The proposed EEG (2016) is a continuation of the EEG (2014). It replaces prescribed feed-in tariffs with an auction system for the majority of renewable technologies. It repeats the deployment corridors specified in the EEG (2014) to control the uptake of renewable electricity over the next decade and to ensure that future renewable energy targets are honored. This corridor will be maintained by auctioning only a defined capacity each year. Only those renewables projects that bid successfully will receive EEG support for the electricity they supply over the following 20{{nbsp}}years. Each technology – photovoltaics, onshore wind, offshore wind, and biomass – will get an auction design tailored to its needs. Small renewables installations of under 750{{nbsp}}kW capacity or under 150{{nbsp}}kW for biomass will not be required to tender and will continue to receive conventional feed-in tariffs. Bidders from other European countries will be able to compete in the auctions for up to 5% of the annual capacity, under certain conditions.&lt;ref name="bmwi-press-release-2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="german-danish-agreement-2016"/&gt; The new auction system should cover more than 80% of the new renewable electricity capacity.&lt;ref name="appunn-2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="amelang-2016"/&gt;

As indicated above, the auction system was piloted in 2015 for ground-mounted photovoltaic facilities. As a result of this trial, the [[Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy|Economics and Energy Ministry]] (BMWi) abandoned '[[Multiunit auction#Uniform price auction|uniform pricing]]' in favor of '[[Multiunit auction#Pay-as-bid auction|pay-as-bid]]'. The [[German Federal Network Agency|Federal Network Agency]] (''Bundesnetzagentur'') will call for tenders for renewable projects and set the capacity to correspond to the trajectory needed for a 40–45% share in 2025. Starting in 2017, there will be between three and four auctions per year for photovoltaics and onshore wind. Participants will submit single sealed bids and will have to provide a substantial security deposit to ensure [[Good faith (law)|good faith]]. Bids are tied to projects and locations and cannot normally be transferred. The lowest bids will win until the capacity under auction is met. A ceiling price is to be notified in advance. Successful projects will receive the funding rate with which they won for a period of 20{{nbsp}}years. Special rules apply for citizen energy projects: small projects are exempt from the auction system altogether and larger projects will receive the highest offer accepted in their round rather than their own possibly lower bid.&lt;ref name="appunn-2016"/&gt;

Onshore wind investors will also have to get prior approval for their projects under the Federal Immission Control Act (''Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetzes'' or ''BlmSchG''), the federal law regulating the harmful effects of air pollution, noise, vibration and similar phenomena. Citizens cooperatives (''Genossenschaft'') participating in wind energy tenders have special dispensations. Wind energy auctions will be held more often in the beginning, with three in 2017 and four in 2018, in order to quickly establish a price level. The annual capacity for onshore wind farms will be set at 2.8{{nbsp}}GW per year for 2017 to 2019 and at 2.9{{nbsp}}GW thereafter. In order to better synchronise the development of the grid with renewables growth, the addition of onshore wind will be restricted to specified 'grid congestion zones' where high inputs of renewable electricity cannot be accepted because of network congestion. These areas are to be identified by the [[German Federal Network Agency|Federal Network Agency]]. The new rules on funding offshore wind farms will apply to those projects that commence operation in 2021 or later. From 2025, the government will specify the sites for future wind farms and investors will then compete for the right to build at those locations. This centralised (Danish) model is designed to ensure competition and to make project approvals, site planning, and network connections more cost effective and better integrated. Between 2021 and 2024 a transitional auction model will be used and wind farms that have been planned and approved but not built will compete in two rounds of tenders for a restricted amount of capacity. Offshore wind will remain capped at 15{{nbsp}}GW by 2030 and the capacity auctioned each year will be consistent with this target. In 2021, only wind farms in the Baltic Sea will be considered, due to a shortage of network connections at the North Sea. Biomass projects will also participate in the new auction system. Biomass capacity is to be expanded by 150{{nbsp}}MW annually in the next three years and by 200{{nbsp}}MW annually for the following three years. Installations with a capacity greater than 150{{nbsp}}kW will also be able to tender. Biomass facilities will only receive remuneration for half their runtime in order to incentivize their use during times of high electricity prices. Hydroelectricity, geothermal, and mine, landfill, and sewage gas are excluded from the auction system because of the prospect of insufficient competition.&lt;ref name="appunn-2016"/&gt;

On 20{{nbsp}}December 2016, the European Commission found that the EEG amendments are in line with EU rules governing state aid, thereby allowing the planned introduction on 1{{nbsp}}January 2017 to be honored.&lt;ref name="clew-2016d"/&gt;&lt;ref name="european-commission-press-release-2016"/&gt;

This round of legislation is being overseen by a [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]]/[[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|CSU]]/[[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] [[grand coalition]] [[List of Federal Republic of Germany governments#18th Bundestag|government]].

==== Reactions ====
In January 2016, in response to the official proposals, [[Greenpeace|Greenpeace Germany]] cautioned that a complete overhaul of the successful EEG would endanger climate protection targets. The [[:de:Bundesverband Windenergie|German Wind Energy Association]] (BWE) and others are calling for a 2.5{{nbsp}}GW net capacity addition for onshore wind energy per annum that is not dependent on the increase of offshore wind. They also say that the 40–45% renewables target by 2025 should not be treated as a fixed ceiling. The [[VDMA|German Engineering Federation]] (VDMA) said that "the EEG amendment gives rise to growing uncertainty in the industry" and that "it is however not right to regulate the expansion of renewable energy production by controlling the tendering volume for onshore wind energy and inflexibly clinging on to a 45% target in the electricity sector".&lt;ref name="diethelm-2016"/&gt;{{rp|at=for{{nbsp}}quotes}}&lt;ref name="amelang-and-appunn-2016a"/&gt;

Estimates for 2012 suggest that almost half the renewable energy capacity in Germany is owned by citizens through energy cooperatives (''Genossenschaft'') and private installations.&lt;ref name="amelang-2016"/&gt; Critics worry that the new rules will preclude citizen participation, despite the special provisions for cooperatives and individuals. Preparing tenders is expensive (costing perhaps €50,000–100,000) and that expenditure is sunk if the bid fails.&lt;ref name="amelang-2016"/&gt; In January 2016 [[Greenpeace Energy]] said that renewables auctions would make the [[Energiewende in Germany|''Energiewende'']] less fair and that citizen cooperatives and small investors would be at a disadvantage. [[Germanwatch]], [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF-Germany]], and [[Deutsche Umwelthilfe]] (DUH), three German [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]], said the proposed reforms do not properly account for small, citizen-owned renewables projects.&lt;ref name="amelang-and-appunn-2016a"/&gt; Citizen participation is seen as a key reason for the widespread public acceptance of renewable technologies in Germany. That support may lag if the EEG reforms favor large companies over cooperatives and individuals.&lt;ref name="amelang-2016"/&gt;

==== Political positions ahead of 2017 elections ====
{{Main|German federal election, 2017}}

In November 2016, the CDU revealed that it is considering scrapping the EEG, although it remains undecided as to whether it will make this an election issue for 2017.&lt;ref name="clew-2016b"/&gt;

== EEG surcharge ==
The EEG surcharge and the aggregate EEG surcharge have both risen steadily since 2000. The technologies that make up the largest share of the 2015 EEG surcharge are: photovoltaics at 43%, biomass at 25%, and onshore wind energy at 19%. Three percent is retained for past and future forecast errors and thereby provides a liquidity reserve.&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015c"/&gt;{{rp|30}}

== Politics ==
The development of the EEG has been the subject of [[political science]] analysis. A 2006 study finds that "the regulatory framework is formed in a 'battle over institutions' where the German parliament, informed and supported by an advocacy coalition of growing strength, backed support policies for renewables sourced electricity against often reluctant governments and the opposition from nuclear and coal interests".&lt;ref name="jacobsson-and-lauber-2006"/&gt;{{rp|256}}

A 2016 thesis finds that two broad coalition of actors faced each other off over the development of the EEG legislation: an 'economic coalition' that opposed support for renewables and sought to protect nuclear power and fossil fuel interests and an 'environmental coalition' that took the opposite stance. The economic coalition wanted unassisted market competition to prevail and preferred large-scale facilities. The environmental coalition comprised environmental organizations, the renewables industry, farmers, the metal workers unions ([[IG Bergbau, Chemie, Energie|IG{{nbsp}}BCE]] and [[IG Metall]]), a German engineering association ([[VDMA]]), partly the [[:de:Zentralverband des Deutschen Handwerks|German Confederation of Skilled Crafts]] (ZDH), and some industrial corporations with renewables interests. When the EEG was proposed in the late-1990s, the incumbent energy companies markedly underestimated the technological potential of renewables, believing them to be suitable only for niche roles. They were not alone, almost all politicians and scientists of the time did so too.&lt;ref name="pieprzyk-and-hilje-2009"/&gt;{{rp|13}} The opposition to the EEG was therefore muted. Concurrent lobbying over the [[Nuclear power phase-out#Germany|nuclear phase-out]] (''Atomausstieg'') also diverted industry attention away from the EEG negotiations. Notwithstanding, the success of the EEG can be traced a small dedicated group of parliamentarians who forged an alliance between various business groups, unions, environmental [[NGO]]s, and other idealistic interest groups. Yet despite expectations, renewable generation came to account for 27.4% of gross electricity consumption in 2014&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015a"/&gt;{{rp|4}} and seriously threatened the business model of the incumbents. As history shows, the environmental coalition prevailed till 2014 at least, underpinning the development of the EEG legislation, the nuclear phase-out, and the German ''[[Energiewende]]'' more generally.&lt;ref name="gruendinger-2016-ch6"/&gt;

== Effectiveness ==
Between 2015 and 2017, the fixed [[feed-in tariff]] scheme, introduced in 1991, is being phased out for around 80% of installations in favor of an [[auction]] system. This change is defined under the EEG (2014) and subsequent legislation.

=== Feed-in tariff scheme (pre-2015–2017) ===

Various studies have found that a fixed feed-in tariff scheme provides financial certainty and is more cost effective and less bureaucratic than other forms of support, including investment or production tax credits, quota-based renewable portfolio standards (RPS), and auction mechanisms.&lt;ref name="butler-and-neuhoff-2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jacobs-2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="weiss-2014"/&gt; In 2008 the [[European Commission]] concluded that (although in 2014 it reversed its position to favor market-based instruments&lt;ref name="european-commission-press-release-2014a"/&gt;):

{{quote|Well-adapted feed-in tariff regimes are generally the most efficient and effective support schemes for promoting renewable electricity.|[[European Commission]], 23{{nbsp}}January 2008&lt;ref name="european-commission-2008"/&gt;{{rp|3}}}}

When the avoided [[external cost]]s are compared to the compensation that renewable energy operators were paid for electricity from renewable energy, a 2003 study finds that the reduced environmental impacts and related economic benefits far outweigh the additional costs required to compensate the producers of electricity from renewable sources.&lt;ref name="krewitt-and-nitsch-2003"/&gt; Accounting for the external costs of fossil fuel use and thus "level[ing] the playing field" had been one of the key purposes when constructing the original EEG.&lt;ref name="jacobsson-and-lauber-2006"/&gt; A feed-in tariff scheme generates more competition, more jobs, and more rapid deployment for manufacturing and does not require the picking of technological winners, such as between [[wind power]] and [[photovoltaics]].&lt;ref name="butler-and-neuhoff-2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="european-commission-2008"/&gt; Denmark and Germany have been at the forefront of FIT scheme development.&lt;ref name="lipp-2007"/&gt;

A 2008 economics study by [[Rheinisch-Westfälisches Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung|RWI Essen]] was hugely critical of the high levels of feed-in support afforded photovoltaics. The study argues that the 2005 [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme]] (EU ETS) was sufficient to drive the transition towards a [[low-carbon economy]], that the EEG does nothing intrinsic to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, and that the electricity produced represents one of the most expensive greenhouse gas [[Marginal abatement cost|abatement]] options on offer.&lt;ref name="frondel-etal-2008a"/&gt;{{rp|4–5,{{nnbsp}}10}}&lt;ref name="frondel-etal-2008b"/&gt;

=== Auction system (post-2015–2017) ===

In June 2016 economist [[Claudia Kemfert]] from [[German Institute for Economic Research|DIW Berlin]] contended that the new auction system, introduced with the EEG (2014) and being refined under the proposed EEG (2016), will not reduce costs, but will rather undermine planning security and increase the risk premium applied by investors. In addition, the auction system will lead to deployment corridors being missed as companies holding tenders delay construction for whatever reason.&lt;ref name="amelang-2016"/&gt;

=== General ===

The positive impact on the environment ''globally'' is less clear. [[Hans-Werner Sinn]], a German economist and chair of the [[Ifo Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung]] argues that Germany's renewable energy support reduces world market prices for fossil energy. Thus, countries like China or the US have an incentive to produce more, and the net effect on the climate is zero. This effect is known as the [[green paradox]].&lt;ref name="sinn-2007"/&gt;

== Outlook ==
=== Grid reinforcement ===

One challenge that lies ahead is integrating the electricity generated by decentralized renewable energy into the existing electricity grid structure. The grid was built to suit the centralized energy system of the then four main energy companies, namely, [[E.ON]], [[EnBW]], [[RWE]], and [[Vattenfall]].{{efn|{{as of|September 2016}}, these companies are joined by Innogy (RWE's green subsidiary) and [[Uniper]] (conventional generation split from E.ON).}}

The need for grid reinforcement from north to south is commonly recognized. In response, the four [[Transmission system operator|TSOs]] proposed 92 expansion projects covering 7300{{nbsp}}km of lines, but not all will be required or approved.&lt;ref name="appunn-2015"/&gt; In 2015 the [[German Federal Network Agency|Federal Network Agency]] (''Bundesnetzagentur'') released its report on grid expansion plans covering the next decade.{{efn|Onshore Electricity Grid Development Plan 2015/2025 (NEP 2015/2025) and the Offshore Electricity Grid Development Plan 2015/2025 (Offshore NEP 2015/2025).}}&lt;ref name="federal-network-agency-2015"/&gt; Rapid development of the grid is being driven by the uptake of renewables and the phase-out of nuclear power.

But not all experts agree that a substantial build-out of the grid is necessary. [[Claudia Kemfert]] believes the large amount of coal-fired generation on the system is part of the problem. Kemfert said "our studies and models show that grid extension does no harm, but it's not strictly necessary {{nowrap|...}} decentralised, intelligent grids with demand management and, in the medium term, storage, would be much more important."&lt;ref name="amelang-2016"/&gt;{{rp|at=for{{nbsp}}quote}}&lt;ref name="kemfert-etal-2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kemfert-etal-2016a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kemfert-etal-2016b"/&gt; Analysis for [[Greenpeace|Greenpeace Germany]] in 2016 also suggests that it is inflexible coal and nuclear plants that are clogging the grid and driving up wholesale electricity prices.&lt;ref name="amelang-2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deppe-burghardt-2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="huneke-and-lenck-2016"/&gt;

=== Deployment corridors ===

The EEG (2014) specifies technology-specific deployment corridors (see [[#table-expansion-corridors|table]]) which will be tracked by the new auction system. Environmental NGOs and renewable energy advocates argue that these corridors are insufficient to meet Germany's climate protection goals. [[Greenpeace|Greenpeace Germany]] observes "to reduce renewables to 45% in 2025 means expanding the fossil [fuel] share to 55%, with the aim of mitigating the impact on large utilities".&lt;ref name="amelang-2016"/&gt; Patrick Graichen from the Berlin energy [[Think tank|policy institute]] [[Agora Energiewende]] agrees that the deployment corridors are set too low to reach renewables targets beyond 2025.&lt;ref name="amelang-2016"/&gt;

A 2016 report by [[Volker Quaschning]] of [[Hochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft Berlin|HTW Berlin]] concludes that Germany will need to accelerate its renewables uptake by a factor of four or five to reach the lower 2015 [[Paris Agreement]] global warming target of 1.5{{nnbsp}}°C. Moreover, this target will require the energy sector to be [[Low-carbon power|carbon free]] by 2040. Give the likely electrification of the transport and heating sectors, the deployment corridors laid out in the EEG (2014) are wholly inadequate. Onshore wind generation should instead grow by 6.3{{nbsp}}GW net per year (2.8{{nbsp}}GW is specified) and photovoltaics by 15{{nbsp}}GW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; (2.5{{nbsp}}GW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is specified).&lt;ref name="amelang-2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="quaschning-2016"/&gt;

=== Economic aspects ===

A 2011 paper from [[German Institute for Economic Research|DIW Berlin]] modeled the deployment of various renewable energy technologies until 2030 and quantified the associated economic effects. The uptake of renewable energy simultaneously creates business opportunities and imposes social costs for promotion. The study reveals that the continued expansion of renewable energy in Germany should benefit both economic growth and employment in the mid-term.&lt;ref name="blazejczak-etal-2011"/&gt;

The Berlin energy [[think tank|policy institute]] Agora Energiewende predicts that the [[#EEG surcharge|EEG surcharge]] will peak around 2023 and then decline. The reasons being that expensive projects committed at the beginning of the EEG in 2000 will begin to expire after their 20{{nbsp}}years of support, that new projects are now much cheaper, and that the trend of reducing generation cost will continue.&lt;ref name="amelang-2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oeko-institut-2016"/&gt;

=== Energy sector transformation ===

In November 2016, [[:de:Agora Energiewende|Agora Energiewende]] reported on the new {{nowrap|EEG (2017)}} and several other related new laws. It concludes that this new legislation will bring "fundamental changes" for large sections of the energy industry, but have limited impact on the economy and on consumers.&lt;ref name="clew-2016a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="argyropoulos-etal-2016"/&gt;

{{Conflict of laws}}

The '''Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition''', or '''Hague Trust Convention''' is a [[multilateralism|multilateral]] [[treaty]] developed by the [[Hague Conference on Private International Law]] on the Law Applicable to '''[[Trusts]]'''. It concluded on 1 July 1985, entered into force 1 January 1992, and is as of September 2017 ratified by 14 countries. The Convention uses a [[harmonisation of law|harmonised]] definition of a trust, which are the subject of the convention and sets Conflict rules for resolving problems in the [[choice of law|choice]] of the applicable law. The key provisions of the Convention are:
* each party recognises the existence and validity of [[trust law|trusts]].  However, the Convention only relates to trusts with a written trust instrument.  It would not apply trusts which arise (usually in [[common law]] jurisdictions) without a written trust instrument.
* the Convention sets out the characteristics of trusts under the convention (even jurisdictions with considerable legal history relating to trusts find this difficult)
* the Convention sets out clear rules for determining the [[choice of law|governing law]] of trusts with a cross border element.

==Background==
Many [[Jurisdiction (area)|states]] do not have a developed law of trusts, or the principles differ significantly between states. It was therefore necessary for the Hague Convention to define a trust to indicate the range of legal transactions regulated by the Convention and, perhaps more significantly, the range of applications not regulated. The definition offered in Article 2 is:
:...the legal relationship created, ''[[inter vivos]]'' or on death, by a person, the [[settlor]], when assets have been placed under the control of a [[trustee]] for the benefit of a [[beneficiary (trust)|beneficiary]] or for a specified purpose.
:A trust has the following characteristics:
::(a) the assets constitute a separate fund and are not a part of the trustee's own estate;
::(b) title to the trust assets stands in the name of the trustee or in the name of another person on behalf of the trustee;
::(c) the trustee has the power and the duty, in respect of which he is accountable, to manage, employ or dispose of the assets in accordance with the terms of the trust and the special duties imposed upon him by law. The reservation by the settlor of certain rights and powers, and the fact that the trustee may himself have rights as a beneficiary, are not necessarily inconsistent with the existence of a trust.

Article 3 provides that the Convention only applies to [[express trust]]s created voluntarily and evidenced in writing. It will therefore not cover oral trusts, [[resulting trust]]s, [[constructive trust]]s, statutory trusts or trusts created by judicial order. But signatory states are free to apply the Convention to any form of trust. There are [[incidental question]] problems if the trust is testamentary and, under Article 4, if it is alleged that the [[testator]] lacked [[capacity (law)|capacity]], or that the will is formally or substantively invalid, or that it had been revoked, these issues must be determined first under the ''[[lex fori]]'' Conflict rules on [[characterisation (conflict)|characterisation]] and choice of law before the Convention rules can apply. This will include, for example, a detailed consideration of any marriage settlement or applicable law containing [[community property]] provisions which might prevent the testator alienating property from a spouse or [[child]] of the family (see [[succession (conflict)]]). Obviously, if the will purporting to create the trust is held invalid, there are no trusts to adjudicate upon.

==The applicable law==
Article 6 allows the settlor to select the applicable law in the ''inter vivos'' or testamentary document. Under normal circumstances, the settlor will be acting on professional advice and will make an express selection or it will be implied from the facts of the case. But, under Actable 6(2), if the settlor selects a law with no relevant provisions or the provisions in the municipal law selected would be inappropriate, or there is no selection, Article 7 applies to select the law which is most closely connected with the transaction. This is judged by reference to four alternative [[connecting factors]] which are to be considered as at the time the putative trust is created:
# the place where the trust is to be administered;
# the place where the assets are to be found (for immovables, there is no problem{{spaced ndash}}the ''[[lex situs]]'' is easily identified; for movables, the most common form is [[Chose (English law)|choses in action]] such as [[share (finance)|shares]] and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], and their location does not change ([[bearer bond]]s and other instruments where title is determined by mere possession are relatively uncommon), but for tangible assets, this will usually be the place where the assets are located at the time of the hearing given that this represents the place where any [[Court order|Court Order]] would have to be enforced: see [[property (conflict)]]);
# the place where the trustee is resident or conducts his or her business;
# the place where the purpose or object of the trust is to be fulfilled.
Despite the identification of these four factors, the court must actually perform a rounded evaluation of all the circumstances. Thus, it would be relevant to consider the distribution of the assets if in separate states, the purpose of the trust (which might be the [[evasion (law)|evasion]] of [[taxation]] or other provisions in some of the states where the assets are located), the ''[[lex domicilii]]'' or ''[[lex patriae]]'' of the settlor and the beneficiaries (particularly if the legal transaction is a marriage settlement or testamentary), the legal form of the document, and the law of the place where the document was executed (this latter factor may either be accidental and so of marginal value, or contrived to take advantage of a favourable law and so highly significant).
===The scope of the applicable law===
Under Article 8, the  law specified by Article 6 or 7 shall govern the validity of the trust, its construction, its effects, and the administration of the trust. In particular that law shall govern:
:(a) the appointment, resignation and removal of trustees, the capacity to act as a trustee, and the devolution of the office of trustee;
:(b) the rights and duties of trustees among themselves;
:(c) the right of trustees to delegate in whole or in part the discharge of their duties or the exercise of their powers;
:(d) the power of trustees to administer or to dispose of trust assets , to create security interests in the trust assets, or to acquire new assets;
:(e) the powers of investment of trustees;
:(f) restrictions upon the duration of the trust, and upon the power to accumulate the income of the trust;
:(g) the relationships between the trustees and the beneficiaries including the personal liability of the trustees to the beneficiaries;
:(h) the variation of termination of the trust (because variation is expressly within the scope of the Applicable Law, this may be a significant factor in any issue of ''[[forum non conveniens]]'' raised if an application to vary is made to a forum other than a forum of the Applicable Law);
:(i) the distribution of the trust assets;
:(j) the duty of trustees to account for their administration.
===Severance===
Articles 9 and 10 allow the Applicable Law by which the validity of the trust has been established, to sever aspects of the trust and its administration so that separate laws shall apply to each component. In fact, the settlor may expressly select an Applicable Law for each component and the forum court should respect his or her wishes. But, in general terms, it is desirable that a single law should be applied to the administration and the fact that there may be assets located in separate states should not, ''[[wikt:per se|per se]]'', justify severing the trust. The relevant ''[[lex situs]]'' can be applied to micromanage the asset(s) by the trustee(s) without having to apply the ''situs'' law to the administration of the trust in that state. Equally, this is not an argument for a judicial approach which favours the law of the place of administration as the Applicable Law. Although the administration must comply with the municipal laws for general purposes, the duty to honour the intentions of the settlor may make the law of the place where the most significant part of that intention is to be realised the most significant single law.
===Recognition===
Under Article 11, a trust complying with the Applicable Law shall be recognised as a trust which implies, as a minimum, that the trust property constitutes a separate fund, that the trustee may sue and be sued in his capacity as trustee, and that he or she may appear or act in this capacity before a [[Civil law notary|notary]] or any person acting in an official capacity. In so far as the law applicable to the trust requires or provides, this recognition implies in particular:
:(a) that personal creditors of the trustee shall have no recourse against the trust assets;
:(b) that the trust assets shall not form part of the trustee's estate upon his [[insolvency]] or [[bankruptcy]];
:(c) that the trust assets shall not form part of the matrimonial property of the trustee or his spouse nor part of the trustee's estate upon his death;
:(d) that the trust assets may be recovered when the trustee, in breach of trust, has mingled trust assets with his own property or has alienated trust assets.
However, the rights and obligations of any third party holder of the assets shall remain subject to the law determined by the choice of law rules of the ''lex fori''. Thus, although the Convention makes provision for the trustee(s) and any third parties, it fails to address the position of the beneficiaries who, for example, might wish to pursue assets intermixed with the trustee's personal property through actions for tracing. One of the problems that beneficiaries might encounter is addressed in Article 12 which considers the problem where the ''situs'' law does not have a title registration system which reflects ownership registration in a representative capacity. While recognising that the Convention cannot require states to modify their existing registers, it provides that the trustee shall be entitled, in so far as this is not prohibited by or inconsistent with the law of the State where registration is sought, to do so in his capacity as trustee or in such other way that the existence of the trust is disclosed. This implicitly recognises the desirability of all registration systems distinguishing between beneficial and representative titles.

This general difficulty of municipal laws failure to support trusts is addressed in Article 13, which considers the situation of those who wish to create a trust but can only do so by invoking laws entirely outside their own state. As an application of [[comity]], no forum state is bound to recognise a trust the significant elements of which, except for the choice of the applicable law, the place of administration and the [[habitual residence]] of the trustee, are more closely connected with States which do not have the institution of the trust or the category of trust involved. But, because this could be interpreted as an invitation not to validate otherwise perfectly appropriate financial arrangements for deserving beneficiaries, Article 14 provides that the Convention shall not prevent the application of rules of law more favourable to the recognition of trusts. This reflects the positive rules of [[public policy (law)|public policy]] which require that the validity of a transaction (whether commercial or not) be upheld if at all possible where this will give effect to the reasonable expectations of the parties. The only exceptions shall be where this will produce consequences offending against the mandatory policies of the forum court in which case Article 18 empowers the court to deny the Applicable Law, even if it has been expressly selected by the settlor. But Article 15(2) nevertheless requires the forum court to consider adopting an approach that will preserve the overall validity of the trust insofar as that generality does not offend against the mandatory policy.

The '''Harrison Narcotics Tax Act''' (Ch. 1, {{USStat|38|785}}) was a [[United States federal law]] that regulated and taxed the production, importation, and distribution of [[opiates]] and [[coca]] products. The act was proposed by [[United States Representative|Representative]] [[Francis Burton Harrison]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] and was approved on December 17, 1914.&lt;ref&gt;

"An Act To provide for the registration of, with collectors of internal revenue, and to impose a special tax on all persons who produce, import, manufacture, compound, deal in, dispense, sell, distribute, or give away [[opium]] or [[coca]] leaves, their salts, derivatives, or preparations, and for other purposes." The courts interpreted this to mean that physicians could prescribe narcotics to patients in the course of normal treatment, but not for the treatment of addiction.

The Harrison Anti-Narcotic [[legislation]] consisted of three [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]] bills imposing restrictions on the availability and consumption of the [[psychoactive drug]] [[opium]]. U.S. House bills {{USBill|63|H.R.|1966}} and {{USBill|63|H.R.|1967}} passed conjointly with House bill {{USBill|63|H.R.|6282}} or the Opium and Coca Leaves Trade Restrictions Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legisworks.org/congress/63/publaw-46.pdf |title=Opium Importation Amendment - P.L. 63-46 |work=38 Stat. 275 |series={{USBill|63|H.R.|1966}} |publisher=Legis★Works}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legisworks.org/congress/63/publaw-47.pdf |title=Opium Manufacture Restrictions - P.L. 63-47 |work=38 Stat. 277 |series={{USBill|63|H.R.|1967}} |publisher=Legis★Works}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although technically illegal for purposes of distribution and use, the distribution, sale and use of [[cocaine]] was still legal for registered companies and individuals.

== History ==

=== International background ===
Following the [[Spanish–American War]] the U.S. acquired the [[Philippines]] from Spain. At that time, opium addiction constituted a significant problem in the civilian population of the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Escohotado |first=Antônio |title=Historia General de las Drogas |trans-title=General History of Drugs |edition=&lt;!--Alianza--&gt;Alliance |year=1998 |pages=610–611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Henry Brent]] was an American Episcopal bishop who served as Missionary Bishop of the Philippines beginning in 1901. He convened a Commission of Inquiry, known as the [[Brent Commission]], for the purpose of examining alternatives to a licensing system for opium addicts. The Commission recommended that narcotics should be subject to international control. The recommendations of the Brent Commission were endorsed by the [[United States Department of State]] and in 1906 President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] called for an international conference, the [[International Opium Commission]], which was held in Shanghai in February 1909. A second conference was held at [[The Hague]] in May 1911, and out of it came the first international drug control treaty, the [[International Opium Convention]] of 1912.

=== Domestic Background ===
In the 1800s opiates and cocaine were mostly unregulated drugs. In the 1890s the [[Sears &amp; Roebuck]] catalogue, which was distributed to millions of Americans homes, offered a syringe and a small amount of cocaine for $1.50.&lt;ref name="white" /&gt;  On the other hand, as early as 1880 some states and localities had already passed laws against smoking opium, at least in public.&lt;ref&gt;See for example this [http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=LAH18790118.2.11&amp;srpos=3&amp;e=--1866---1900--en--20-LAH%2cLASTAR-1-byDA-txt-txIN-smoking+opium-------1 article] in the Los Angeles Herald, mentioning the city law against opium smoking. LAH. ''Local Brevities''. 19 January 1879 p3&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century, cocaine began to be linked to crime. In 1900, the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' published an editorial stating, "Negroes in the South are reported as being addicted to a new form of vice – that of 'cocaine sniffing' or the 'coke habit.'"  Some newspapers later claimed cocaine use caused blacks to rape white women and was improving their pistol marksmanship.&lt;ref&gt;Meantioned in an 8 February 1914, New York New York Times article titled "Negro Cocaine 'Fiends' Are a New Menace." by Edward Huntington Williams, M.D [http://lh.journals.yorku.ca/index.php/lh/article/download/5410/4605]&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese immigrants were blamed for importing the opium-smoking habit to the U.S. The 1903 blue-ribbon citizens' panel, the Committee on the Acquirement of the Drug Habit, concluded, "If the Chinaman cannot get along without his dope we can get along without him."

[[Theodore Roosevelt]] appointed Dr. [[Hamilton Wright]] as the first Opium Commissioner of the United States in 1908. In 1909, Wright attended the International Opium Commission in Shanghai as the American delegate. He was accompanied by Charles Henry Brent, the Episcopal Bishop. On March 12, 1911, Dr. Wright was quoted as follows in an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'': "Of all the nations of the world, the United States consumes most habit-forming drugs per capita. Opium, the most pernicious drug known to humanity, is surrounded, in this country, with far fewer safeguards than any other nation in Europe fences it with."&lt;ref name="hamilton" /&gt; Wright further claimed that "it has been authoritatively stated that cocaine is often the direct incentive to the crime of rape by the negroes of the South and other sections of the country," though he failed to mention specifically ''which'' authorities had stated that, and did not provide any evidence for his claim.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Hamilton. ''Report of the International Opium Commission, Shanghai, China, February 1 to February 26, 1909''. Rep. Shanghai: North-China Daily News &amp; Herald, 1909. Archive.org, 17 Mar. 2010. Web. 17 Aug. 2014. &lt;https://archive.org/details/cu31924032583225&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Wright also stated that "one of the most unfortunate phases of smoking opium in this country is the large number of women who have become involved and were living as common-law wives or cohabitating with Chinese in the Chinatowns of our various cities".&lt;ref name="Cora"&gt;

Several authors have argued that the debate was merely to regulate trade and collect a tax. However, the committee report&lt;ref name="com"&gt;Committee on Finance (Ways and Means Committee, Senate Reports, vol. 1, of the 63rd Congress, 2nd session on Senate Bill 6552, report #258, pp. 3-4)&lt;/ref&gt; prior to the debate on the house floor and the debate itself, discussed the rise of opiate use in the United States.  Harrison stated that "The purpose of this Bill can hardly be said to raise revenue, because it prohibits the importation of something upon which we have hitherto collected revenue." Later Harrison stated, "We are not attempting to collect revenue, but regulate commerce."   House representative [[Thomas Sisson]] stated, "The purpose of this bill—and we are all in sympathy with it—is to prevent the use of opium in the United States, destructive as it is to human happiness and human life."&lt;ref name="rat"&gt;

Before the Act was passed, on February 8, 1914, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an article entitled "Negro Cocaine 'Fiends' Are New Southern Menace: Murder and Insanity Increasing Among Lower-Class Blacks" by Edward Huntington Williams, which reported that Southern sheriffs had increased the caliber of their weapons from .32 to .38 to bring down Negroes under the effect of cocaine.&lt;ref name="white" /&gt;&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

Despite the extreme racialization of the issue that took place in the buildup to the Act's passage, the contemporary research on the subject indicated that black Americans were in fact using cocaine and opium at much ''lower'' rates than white Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Helmer, John, and Thomas Vietorisz. ''[https://libcom.org/library/2-blacks-cocaine-opium-1905-1920 Drug Use, the Labor Market and Class Conflict]''. Washington: Drug Abuse Council, 1974. Libcom.org. Web. 17 Aug. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effect ===

Enforcement began in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;[http://enforcement.lawin.org/drug-enforcement-administration Drug Enforcement Administration | Enforcement | Encyclopedia of Law].&lt;/ref&gt;

The act appears to be concerned about the marketing of opiates. However a clause applying to doctors allowed distribution "in the course of his professional practice only." This clause was interpreted after 1917 to mean that a doctor could not prescribe opiates to an addict, since addiction was not considered a disease. A number of doctors were arrested and some were imprisoned. The medical profession quickly learned not to supply opiates to addicts. In ''United States v. Doremus'', 249 U.S. 86 (1919), the Supreme Court ruled that the Harrison Act was constitutional, and in ''[[Webb v. United States]]'', 249 U.S. 96, 99 (1919) that physicians could not prescribe narcotics solely for maintenance.&lt;ref name="kand" /&gt;

The impact of diminished supply was obvious by mid-1915. A 1918 commission called for sterner law enforcement, while newspapers published sensational articles about addiction-related crime waves.&lt;ref&gt;Albert F. Nathan. "Drug Fiends Make 'Crime Wave.'" ''Los Angeles Times'' (1886–1922). Los Angeles, Calif.: Nov 30, 1919. p. II1 (2 pages)&lt;/ref&gt; Congress responded by tightening up the Harrison Act—the importation of [[heroin]] for any purpose was banned in 1924.

After other complementary laws (for example implementing the Uniform State Narcotic Act in 1932), and other actions by the government the number of addicts of opium started to decrease fast from 1925 to a level that in 1945 that was about one tenth of the level in 1914.{{citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The use of the term '[[narcotic]]s' in the title of the act to describe not just opiates but also [[cocaine]]—which is a central nervous system stimulant, not a narcotic—initiated a precedent of frequent legislative and judicial misclassification of various substances as 'narcotics'. Today, law enforcement agencies, popular media, the [[United Nations]], other nations and even some medical practitioners can be observed applying the term very broadly and often pejoratively in reference to a wide range of illicit substances, regardless of the more precise definition existing in medical contexts. For this reason, however, 'narcotic' has come to mean any illegally used drug, but it is useful as a shorthand for referring to a controlled drug in a context where its legal status is more important than its physiological effects.

The remaining effect of this act, which has largely been superseded by the [[Controlled Substances Act of 1970]], is the warning "*Warning: May be habit forming" on labels, package inserts, and other places where ingredients are listed in the case of many [[opioids]], [[barbiturates]], medicinal formulations of [[cocaine]], and [[chloral hydrate]].

The act also marks the beginning of the creation of the modern, criminal drug addict and the American [[black market]] for drugs. Within five years the Rainey Committee, a Special Committee on Investigation appointed by [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] [[William Gibbs McAdoo]] and led by Congressman T. Rainey, reported in June, 1919&lt;ref name=pharmaceutical53&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/pharmaceuticaler53newyuoft |title=The Pharmaceutical era, vol 53 |publisher=Archive.org |date=2001-03-10 |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; that drugs were being smuggled into the country by sea, and across the Mexican and Canadian borders by nationally established organisations&lt;ref&gt;[http://adh.2.forumer.com/a/america-in-the-19th-century_post470.html The Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs] Edward M. Brecher and the Editors of ''Consumer Reports'' Magazine, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; and that the United States consumed 470,000 pounds of opium annually, compared to 17,000 pounds in both France and Germany.&lt;ref name=pharmaceutical53 /&gt; The Monthly Summary of Foreign Commerce of the United States recorded that in the 7 months to January 1920, 528,635 pounds of opium was imported, compared to 74,650 pounds in the same period in 1919.&lt;ref name=pharmaceutical53 /&gt;

== Challenge ==
The Act's applicability in prosecuting [[physician|doctors]] who prescribe narcotics to [[Substance dependence|addicts]] was successfully challenged in ''[[Linder v. United States]]'' in 1925, as [[Justice McReynolds]] ruled that the federal government has no power to regulate medical practice.

'''''Hendren et al. v. Campbell et al.''''' was a 1977 ruling by an [[Indiana]] state [[trial court|superior court]] that the [[Young earth|young-earth]] [[creationism|creationist]] textbook could not be used in Indiana [[Public education#United States public schools|public schools]].  Jon Hendren, a ninth-grade student in the [[West Clark Community Schools]], sued when the district picked ''Biology: A Search For Order In Complexity'', published by the [[Creation Research Society]] and promoted through the [[Institute for Creation Research]], as the sole biology textbook.

==Decision==
The ruling declared: "The question is whether a text obviously designed to present only the view of [[Genesis creation myth|Biblical Creationism]] in a favorable light is constitutionally acceptable in the public schools of Indiana. Two hundred years of constitutional government demand that the answer be no." ''Campbell'' was a forerunner to the federal decisions in ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' and ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]''. In ''Aguillard'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] &amp;ndash; using logic similar to that in ''Campbell'' &amp;ndash; ruled that [[creation science]] was religiously motivated and could not be taught in public schools.&lt;ref name="TOpage"&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/hendren/hendren_v_campbell.html ''Hendren v.

Islam is totally opposed to monasticism and celibacy.&lt;ref name="marriage1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.al-islam.org/islamic-marriage-syed-athar-husain-sh-rizvi/importance-marriage-islam | title=Importance of Marriage in Islam | publisher=al-islam.org | accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marriage is an act of [http://quran.al-islam.org Islam] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2002.02.0006%3Asura%3D4%3Averse%3D4|title=Surah 4:4|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;and is strongly recommended;&lt;ref name="marriage1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="onislam.net"&gt;http://www.onislam.net/english/ask-about-islam/ethics-and-values/muslim-character/166329-marriage-is-the-prophets-sunnah.html&lt;/ref&gt; the age of marriage being whenever the individuals feel ready, financially and emotionally.&lt;ref name="onislam.net"/&gt; [[Polygny in Islam|Polygyny is permitted in Islam]] under some conditions, but [[polyandry]] is forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arabnews.com/saudiarabia/article308231.ece |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311202547/http://arabnews.com/saudiarabia/article308231.ece |archivedate=2011-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of marriage==

===Nikāḥ===
[[Image:Signing the Nikah.jpg|thumb|A Muslim bride signing the '''nikkah nama''' or marriage certificate]]
{{Main article|Nikah}}
''nikāḥ'' (Arabic: نكاح, literally, "to collect and bind together")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nikah.com/marriage/definition_nikah.asp Nikah.com Information: Definition of Nikah (Islamic marriage)]&lt;/ref&gt; is the first&amp;mdash;and most common&amp;mdash;form of marriage for [[Muslim]]s. It is described in the Qur'an in Surah 4:4.&lt;ref name="Q44"&gt;{{cite quran|4|4|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regulations:
*While intended to be a permanent state, it can be terminated by the husband engaging in the ''[[Divorce (Islamic)|Talaq]]'' process or the wife seeking a ''[[Khula]]''.
*The couple inherit from each other.
*A legal [[contract]] is signed when entering the marriage. However it is not a requirement that the contract be in writing, it may be oral especially amongst illiterates; and if an agreed end-date is specified in the nikāḥ contract:
**In [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] jurisprudence, the contract is invalid.
**In [[Shia Islam|Shia]] jurisprudence, the contract defines a temporary marriage, ''nikāḥ mut'ah''.
{{quote|Ibn Abbas narrated that prophet said, "fornicatoresses are those who marry without proof." (Tirmidhi vol. 2 book 6 no.1103)}}
Requirement of witnesses:
*two (2) witnesses from both sides&lt;ref&gt;[http://al-islam.org/organizations/aalimnetwork/msg00200.html Witnesses for Marriage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051110182956/http://al-islam.org/organizations/aalimnetwork/msg00200.html |date=2005-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Permission from [[Wali (Islamic legal guardian)|Wali]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.central-mosque.com/fiqh/nikwhwali.htm Nikah without Parents' Knowledge?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708133650/http://www.central-mosque.com/fiqh/nikwhwali.htm |date=2011-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Sunni: Compulsory ([[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Hanbali]]) ''or'' Strongly recommended ([[Hanafi]])
*Shia: Depending on the scholar, it is either obligatory or obligatory based on precaution.

===Nikāḥ mut‘ah===
{{Main article|Nikah mut‘ah}}
''nikāḥ mut‘ah'' (Arabic: نكاح متعة, temporary marriage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/mutah/en/chap2.php |website=Answering-Ansar.org |title=Mut'ah, a comprehensive guide |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224032516/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/mutah/en/chap2.php |archivedate=2008-02-24 |date=2008-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, There is controversy on the Islamic legality of this type of marriage, since Sunnis believe it was abrogated by Muhammad or Umar.&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Bukhara&lt;/ref&gt;while Shias do not hold this. According to Shia Hadith: Ali (r) said ‘Had Umar not banned Mut’ah then the only person to fornicate would have been a disgraceful person, since Mut’ah is easy, and one can attain the objective, there would have then been no need to indulge in haraam acts. It is clear that if Mut’ah’s abrogation was Sahih then Jabir would not have opposed Omar, and that if Islamic prophet outlawed it, the Companions would not have practiced it during the reign of Abu Bakr. Someone asked Abdullah bin Umar (about Mut’ah) saying: ‘Your father prohibited it. (Ibn Umar replied): ‘Is the order of the Messenger of Allah, more deserving to be followed, or the order of my father?’ [http://www.shiapen.com/comprehensive/mutah/umar-banned-mutah.html].

''However, similar to normal marriages that are common among Sunnis and Shi'ias, the woman still is given her ''[[mahr]]'',and the woman must still observe the ''[[iddah]]'', a period of time where the woman cannot remarry. This is to ensure that there is no pregnancy from the ex-husband and thus clarifies paternal lineage.''

Quran 4:24 (Pickthall)- And all married women (are forbidden unto you) save those (captives) whom your right hands possess. It is a decree of Allah for you. Lawful unto you are all beyond those mentioned, so that ye seek them with your wealth in honest wedlock, not debauchery. And those of whom ye seek content (by marrying them), give unto them their portions as a duty. And there is no sin for you in what ye do by mutual agreement after the duty (hath been done). Lo! Allah is ever Knower, Wise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irebd.com/quran/english/surah-4/verse-24/ Quran Surah An-Nisaa ( Verse 24 )]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nikāḥ misyar===
{{Main article|Nikah Misyar}}
nikāḥ Misyaar is a nikāḥ in Sunni's carried out via the normal contractual procedure, with the specificity that the husband and wife give up several rights by their own free will, such as living together, equal division of nights between wives in cases of [[polygamy]], the wife's rights to housing, and maintenance money (''"[[nafaqa]]"''), and the husband's right of homekeeping, and access etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503544160 |first=Yusuf |last=Al-Qaradawi |title=Misyar marriage |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104035953/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503544160 |archivedate=2011-01-04 |date=2011-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between this and Mut'ah is that Mut'ah has the condition of a definite time period. Allowing both husband and wife aware of a separation date, prior to a marriage contract. Sunnah Scholars have said it is permissible to marry a Woman with the intention of getting divorced, If the Wife is not informed or expecting a divorce during a marriage contract. [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misyar_marriage]

===Nikah Istibdaa===
It is a marriage ( نکاح استبضاع) in which a husband would send his wife to another person, usually of noble lineage, to have sexual relations with him. The husband would refrain from sexual relations with his wife until she became pregnant by the other man. Afterwards, the man would claim paternity of the conceived child. This was done to get a child of noble breed. It was eradicated by Islam.&lt;ref&gt; Sahih Bukhari 5127 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Nikāḥ Shighār===
It is marriage (نکاح شغار) in which two men would exchange their daughters, sisters or other close  women for marriage without paying [[Mahr]]. It was prohibited by [[Muhammad]]. &lt;ref&gt; sahih Bukhari 6960 &lt;/ref&gt;
=== Nikāḥ ijtimaa===
{{main article|Nikah Ijtimah}}
This is polyandrous marriage, in which up to ten men would have sexual relations with the same woman at around the same time. When she bore a child she would call all the men and attribute paternity of the child to a man of her choosing. This practice was eradicated by Islam.

===Interfaith marriage===
{{Main article|Interfaith marriage in Islam}}

Muslim males may marry a non-Muslim female, specifically, one from the "[[People of the Book]]", which includes [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]]. Conversion is optional for the woman,  but she is nonetheless charged with having a proper understanding of her respective faith as well as engaging in its true and thorough practise. Muslim women have generally forbidden from marrying non-Muslims by some interpretations. But today, more and more scholars have been questioning this ages-long assumption.

==Restrictions on marriage==

===Polygyny===
{{Main article|Polygyny in Islam}}
[[Muslim]] men are allowed to practise [[polygyny]], that is, they can have more than one wife at the same time, up to a total of four, per [[Sura]] 4 Verse 3. A man does not need approval of his first wife for a second marriage as there is no evidence in the Qur'an or hadith to suggest this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamicislamic.com/marriage_old_divorce.htm#18._SECOND_MARRIAGE_WITHOUT_FIRST_WIFE_CONSENT_ Section 30] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509101836/http://www.islamicislamic.com/marriage_old_divorce.htm |date=2015-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://islamqa.info/en/61 Validity of second marriage without consent of first]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/index.php?page=showfatwa&amp;Option=FatwaId&amp;Id=82068 IslamWeb Fatwa Q&amp;A]&lt;/ref&gt; The only requirement is to create fairness among his wives and to never hurt one wife to please another as this would be unjust. If this requirement cannot be fulfilled, then he can only marry one woman.

[[Polyandry]], the practice of a woman having more than one husband, by contrast, is not permitted. One of the main reasons for this would be the potential questioning of paternal lineage. The Quran states: (30:21): “And among His signs is that He has created for you, from your selves, mates, that you may incline towards them and find rest in them, and He has engendered love and tenderness between you. Surely in this are signs for people who reflect.”

===Permissible age===
''[[Sahih Muslim]]'' permits marriage once a person reaches sexual maturity (i.e.: menstruation, voice changing, wet dreams)  (''[[baligh]]'').{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Sexual maturity in Sharia law is typically understood to mean puberty.&lt;ref&gt;Islam and the Everyday World: Public Policy Dilemmas{{snd}} Page 102, Sohrab Behdad, Farhad Nomani, Farhad Nomani{{snd}} 2006&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, intercourse is forbidden until they are able to physically bear it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamicislamic.com/marriage_old_divorce.htm#4._MARRIAGE_AGE_ Requirement for Marriage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509101836/http://www.islamicislamic.com/marriage_old_divorce.htm |date=2015-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other religions===
{{Main article|Interfaith marriage in Islam}}
Traditionally, Muslim jurists hold that Muslim women may only enter into marriage with Muslim men. The Qur'an explicitly allows Muslim men to marry chaste women of the [[People of the Book]], a term which includes [[Jew]]s and [[Christian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|5|5|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="interfaith"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scholarofthehouse.com/oninma.html |title=On Christian Men marrying Muslim Women |accessdate=2008-01-20 |last=El Fadl |first=Abou |year=2006 |work=Scholar of the House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arranged and forced marriages===
An [[Arranged marriage|engagement may be arranged]] between families for their children, but Islamic requirements for a legal marriage include the requirement that both parties, bride, groom and guardian for the bride (''[[wali]]''), give their legal consent. A marriage without the consent of the bride or [[forced marriage|performed under coercion]] is illegal according to the majority of scholars.

If a girl has not attained the age of puberty, the vast majority of scholars hold that she cannot be married; and many stipulate that it must be in her best interest in order to be considered a valid marriage. There is some dispute as to whether or not an under-age bride can leave her family's custody and be transferred to her husband's custody, if she has not yet reached puberty. Some evidence supporting both sides can be seen in the following narrations from Muhammad:

Sahih Bukhari Volume 7, Book 62, Number 65 Narrated 'Aisha: that the Prophet married her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old. Hisham said: I have been informed that 'Aisha remained with the Prophet for nine years (i.e. till his death).

Sahih Bukhari 7.18 Narrated 'Ursa: The Prophet asked Abu Bakr for 'Aisha's hand in marriage. Abu Bakr said "But I am your brother." The Prophet said, "You are my brother in Allah's religion and His Book, but she (Aisha) is lawful for me to marry."

however; evidence from other Islamic sources seems to suggest that this is not something allowed for all Muslims; rather specifically for Muhammad. The evidence for this view is as follows:

Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet said: "A non-virgin woman may not be married without her command, and a virgin may not be married without her permission; and it is permission enough for her to remain silent (because of her natural shyness)." [Al-Bukhari:6455, Muslim &amp; Others]

It is reported in a hadith that A'ishah related that she once asked the Prophet: "In the case of a young girl whose parents marry her off, should her permission be sought or not?" He replied: "Yes, she must give her permission." She then said: "But a virgin would be shy, O Messenger of Allaah!" He replied: "Her silence is [considered as] her permission." [Al-Bukhari, Muslim, &amp; Others]

It appears that the permission of an under-age bride is indeed necessary for her marriage to be considered valid;the above narrations seem to clearly make the approval of the bride a condition for a valid marriage contract.

===Adulterers===
Islam does not give [[Adultery|adulterous]] men the right to marry a [[Chastity|chaste]] woman and nor may an adulterous woman marry a chaste man, except if the matter has not gone to court and the two purify themselves of this sin by sincere repentance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|24|3|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|2|221|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Javed Ahmed Ghamidi]], [[Mizan]], Chapter:The Social Law of Islam, [[Al-Mawrid]]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Women of purity are for men of purity, and men of purity are for women of purity|{{cite quran|24|26|style=ref}}}}

===Other===
A woman or man may propose marriage directly or through an intermediary ([[Matchmaking|matchmaker]]).

Recognition or celebration of same-sex marriage is completely unjustified in the view of Islamic law. [[Homosexuality and Islam|Islam forbids homosexuality]] in Qur'anic injunctions and Islamic tradition.

A marriage is registered by the ''[[Qadi]]'' who performs the short ceremony.

Unlike the [[wedding ring]] in Western societies, there is no visible sign worn to show a woman or a man is married. However, some Muslims have found the wedding ring to be a non-religious tradition and have used a ring.

===Mahr===
{{Main article|Mahr}}
Mahr is a mandatory gift given by the groom to the bride. Unlike a [[bride price]], however, it is given directly to the bride and not to her father.  Although the gift is often money, it can be anything agreed upon by bride and groom such as a house or viable business that is put in her name and can be run and owned entirely by her if she chooses.

===Islamic marriage contract===
{{Main article|Islamic marriage contract}}
The purpose, rules, and regulations of the [[Islamic marriage contract]]. A Muslim marriage is not a ''sacrament'', but a simple, legal agreement in which either partner is free to include conditions. These conditions are stipulated in a written contract. Violating any of the conditions stipulated in this contract is legal grounds for a partner seeking divorce. The first part of the Nikah, ''marriage ceremony'' is the signing of the marriage contract itself.

Various traditions may differ in how Nikah is performed because different groups accept different texts as authoritative. Therefore, Sunnis will likely accept the [[hadith]] of [[Muhammad al-Bukhari]], while Shia will have their own collections, for example [[Kitab al-Kafi|Furu al-Kafi]], thus producing different procedures. This contract requires the consent of both parties. There is a tradition, outside of the religion, in some Muslim countries to pre-arrange a marriage for young children. However, the marriage still requires consent for the wedding to legally take place.

Divorce is not forbidden as a last resort, however the dissolution of the contract [[Divorce (Islamic)|Talaq]], is often described as the most disliked of permissible things in Islam and should be used as a last resort.

==Walima==
{{main article|Walima}}
The [[Walima]] is a dinner given by the groom's side of the family to celebrate the welcoming of the bride to the family. It is a strong [[sunnah]] (the repetition of an action of Muhammad) and it is recommended to be held the earliest possible day after the Nikah.

==Behavior within marriage==

===Spousal rights and obligations===
{{Main article|Rights and obligations of spouses in Islam}}
Islam advocates a role-based relationship between husband and wife.

[[`Abd Allah ibn `Umar]] narrated:
{{quote|The Prophet said, "All of you are guardians and are responsible for your wards. The ruler is a guardian and the man is a guardian of his family; the lady is a guardian and is responsible for her husband's house and his offspring; and so all of you are guardians and are responsible for your wards."|Sahih al-Bukhari: Volume 7, Book 62, Number 128}}

It puts the main responsibility of earning over the husband. Both are obliged to fulfill the other's sexual needs. Both are obliged to treat each other with kindness.

====Separate accommodation for wife====
The wife has the right to live in separate accommodation with her husband and children, if she does not like to share it with anyone like her in-law or relatives. This is the view of most of the Hanafi, Shaafa’i and Hanbali fuqaha. She also has the right to refuse to live with her husband's father, mother and siblings.

Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar: That he heard Allah's Apostle saying, "Everyone of you is a guardian and is responsible for his charge; the ruler is a guardian and is responsible for his subjects; the man is a guardian in his family and responsible for his charges; a woman is a guardian of her husband's house and responsible for her charges; and the servant is a guardian of his master's property and is responsible for his charge." I definitely heard the above from the Prophet and think that the Prophet also said, "A man is a guardian of his father's property and responsible for his charges; so everyone of you is a guardian and responsible for his charges."[Sahih Bukhari]

This indicates that a wife is responsible for the house of her husband. Also that a man should be the guardian of his family, i.e.,&amp;nbsp;after his marriage he moves out of his father's house, and runs his own family affairs and is guardian of his family. In joint family, typically the head is either the father of the husband, or mother of the husband. This also indicates that a husband should look after his parent's house, as "a man is a guardian of his father's property". So the wife should not object to her husband when he is looking after affairs of his parents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://learndeen.com/jm/blog/85-razi-blog/183-rights-of-spouses-and-issues-in-joint-family-system.html Rights of Spouses and issues with joint family]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sexuality====
{{Main article|Islamic sexual jurisprudence}}
Sexuality in Islam is largely described by the Qur'an, Islamic tradition, and religious leaders both past and present as being confined to marital relationships between men and women. While most traditions discourage celibacy, all encourage strict chastity and modesty with regards to any relationships across gender lines, holding forth that intimacy as perceived within Islam (encompassing a swath of life more broad than strictly sex) is to be reserved for marriage.

[[Abd Allah ibn Mas'ud]] narrated:
{{quote|We were with the Prophet while we were young and had no wealth whatever. So Allah's Apostle said, "O young people! Whoever among you can marry, should marry, because it helps him lower his gaze and guard his modesty (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;his private parts from committing illegal sexual intercourse etc.), and whoever is not able to marry, should fast, as fasting diminishes his sexual desire."|Volume 7, Book 62, Number 4:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/062.sbt.html Wedlock, Marriage (Nikaah)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614011220/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/062.sbt.html#007.062.086 |date=2007-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While adulterous relationships are strictly forbidden, permissible sexual relationships within marriage are described in Islamic sources as great wells of love and closeness for the couple involved. Sexual relationship between married couples are even source of rewards from [[God]] as doing the opposite; i.e.,&amp;nbsp;satisfying sexual needs through illicit means has punishment. Specific occasions (most notably daytime [[Fasting#Islam|fasting]] (see [[sawm]]) and [[menstruation]]) are times forbidden for intercourse, though not for other ways of touching and being close to one another. [[Islamic views on anal sex|Anal sex]] with one's wife is also strictly prohibited.

Islam has an open and playful approach to sex&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/10031095/Sex-What-Muslim-women-really-want-in-the-bedroom.html], Article titled “Sex: What Muslim women really want in the bedroom”, by Shelina Janmohamed, The Telegraph, May 2, 2013, accessed on 23 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "100 facts" &gt;[http://facts.randomhistory.com/islam-facts.html ], 100 Interesting Facts About …&lt;/ref&gt; so long as it is within marriage, free of lewdness, fornication and adultery.

===Gender roles===
The Qur'an asserts that there are innate differences between women and men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quran.com/3/36 "And the male is not like the female."]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Islam places different rights over the husband and wife.

Some similar rights which both the husband and wife owe to each other are:
* The right to enjoy each other.
* The right to inherit from each other.
* The right of confirmation of the lineage of their children.

Some rights which the husband owes to his wife are:
* The dower (Mahr)
* Support
* Kind and proper treatment&lt;ref name="al-islam.org"&gt;{{cite web |title=Part 2: The Duties of Men |url=https://www.al-islam.org/principles-marriage-family-ethics-ayatullah-ibrahim-amini/part-2-duties-men}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Marital relations
* Not to be beaten on face
* Privacy
* Justice between multiple wives
* To be taught her religion
* Defense of her honor&lt;ref name="al-islam.org"/&gt;

Some rights which the wife owes to her husband are:

* Being head of the household
* To be obeyed in all that is not disobedience to Allah
* Marital relations
* That she not allow anyone in the house of whom he disapproves
* That she not leave the house without his permission
* That she protect his property
* To be thanked for his efforts
* That she can only undertake a voluntary fast with his permission

These are some of the rights which spouses owe one another.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamswomen.com/marriage/fiqh_of_marriage_8.php Rights of spouses]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamicislamic.com/marriage_old_divorce.htm#15.

The Guacharacans and later the citizens of San Vicente would plant [[Cactus|cacti]] that were the first markers of the exact site were "La Avanzadora" is buried. A monument, constructed and declared the District Patriotic Sanctuary in 1975, and then the Regional Patriotic Sanctuary in 1994, designates the final resting place of her remains. The monument, Juana La Avanzadora, was erected in her honor on Bolívar avenue in [[Maturín]]. On October 23, 2001 the symbolic remains of Juana Ramírez were inducted into the [[National Pantheon of Venezuela]], the last resting place of heroes of the War for Independence and important figures in Venezuelan society.

In 2015 she became the first black woman to be posthumously laid to rest in [[Venezuela]]'s [[National Mausoleum of Heroes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boothroyd |first=Rachael |url=http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/11617 |title=First Black Woman Independence Fighter is Honoured in Venezuela’s National Mausoleum |publisher=venezuelanalysis.com |date=October 23, 2015 |accessdate=2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2047">{{See also|Judicial Review}}

As early as 1936, the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Philippine Supreme Court]] had unequivocally asserted its constitutional authority to engage in judicial review. This power was affirmed in the Supreme Court decision in [http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1936/jul1936/gr_l-45081_1936.html ''Angara v. Electoral Commission''], [[Case citation#The Philippines|63 Phil. 139 (1936)]]. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court would, in the next several decades, often decline to exercise judicial review by invoking the [[political question]] doctrine. In 1987, the constitutional convention formed to draft a new charter decided to provide for a definition of "judicial power" as a means of inhibiting the Supreme Court from frequently resorting to the political question doctrine. Hence, Section 1, Article VIII of the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Constitution]] states in part that:''Judicial power includes the duty of courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, and to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the government.''

'''Howard Keith Henson''' (born 1942) is an American [[electrical engineer]] and writer on [[space engineering]], [[space law]] ([[Moon treaty]]), [[memetics]], [[cryonics]], [[evolutionary psychology]] and physical limitations of [[Transhumanism]].

In 1975, he and his then-wife [[Carolyn Meinel]] founded the [[L5 Society]], which promoted [[space colonization]] and which was eventually folded into the [[National Space Society]]. More recently, Henson's outspoken criticism of the [[Church of Scientology]] and subsequent criminal proceedings have gained him headlines.

==Early influences==
Keith Henson was raised as an "[[army brat]]" attending seven schools before 7th grade. His father, Lt. Col. Howard W. Henson (1909–2001), was a decorated ([[Bronze Star]], [[Legion of Merit]]) [[United States Army|US Army]] officer who spent much of his career in Army Intelligence. The science-fiction author [[Robert A. Heinlein]] played a major role in influencing his early life.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. U. Sirius]] [http://www.10zenmonkeys.com/2007/02/05/a-reprint-of-an-interview-with-keith-henson-by-ru-sirius-2/]&lt;/ref&gt; Henson graduated from [[Prescott High School (Arizona)|Prescott High School]] shortly after his father retired, before attending the [[University of Arizona]] and receiving a degree in [[Electrical Engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. G. Michaud, ''Reaching for the High Frontier,'' [http://www.nss.org/resources/library/spacemovement/chapter05.htm#desert Out of the desert], Praeger Publishers, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ed Regis (author)|Ed Regis]], ''Great mambo chicken and the transhuman condition, science slightly over the edge'', Westview Press, 1991, p. 47, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

==University==
During much of this period, Henson worked at a [[geophysics]] company, mostly running induced polarization surveys in the western US and [[Peru]].  Henson also programmed geophysical type cases and wrote data reduction programs for the company.&lt;ref&gt;"Theoretical Induced Polarization and Resistivity Response for the Dual Frequency System Collinear Dipole-dipole Array: Volume 1 &amp; 2. By Chris S Ludwig, H Keith Henson, Heinrichs Geoexploration Company Published by Heinrichs Geoexploration Co., 1967"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Druid prank ===
Henson was known at the University of Arizona as one of the founders of the [[Druid]] Student Center, where a campus humor newspaper, ''The Frumious Bandersnatch''&lt;ref&gt;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sixties-l/ywHcCUkdNsg&lt;/ref&gt; was published in the late 1960s. He later cited an incident that occurred in his student days as a good example of [[memetics|memetic replication]]. When asked to fill in a form that required him to disclose his religious affiliations he wrote ''Druid''. His prank was soon noticed by other students and before long almost 20% of the student body had registered themselves as Reform Druids, Orthodox Druids, Members of the Church of the ''n''th Druid, Zen Druids, Latter-Day Druids and so on. The university was forced to remove the religious affiliation question, breaking the chain of replication and variation.&lt;ref&gt;Nadin, Mihai. ''The Civilization of Illiteracy'', p. 407. DUP, 1997. {{ISBN|3-931828-38-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analog engineering==
After graduation, Henson went to work for [[Burr-Brown]] Research, now merged into [[Texas Instruments]], in [[Tucson, Arizona]].  While there, he worked on extremely low distortion quadrature oscillators and non-linear function modules (multipliers, vector adders and root-mean-square). His first patent was a design for a 4-quadrant log-antilog multiplier. He claims to have been fired (not from Burr-Brown) in 1972 for refusing to certify an electronic module for a [[nuclear power]] plant that failed to meet a required [[MTBF]] specification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terasemjournals.org/GN0202/henson6.html The JOURNAL of GEOETHICAL NANOTECHNOLOGY] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080125005112/http://www.terasemjournals.org/GN0202/henson6.html |date=January 25, 2008 }}, Terasem Journals Volume 2, Issue 2, 1st Quarter, 2007, Bio of Keith Henson&lt;/ref&gt; Henson then set up his own company, Analog Precision Inc., producing specialized computer interface equipment and related industrial control devices.&lt;ref name="nss.org"&gt;http://www.nss.org/resources/library/spacemovement/chapter05.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Declaration of H. Keith Henson, HILARY DEZOTELL, KEN HODEN, and BRUCE WAGONER, Plaintiff/Respondent, vs KEITH HENSON,
Defendant/Appellant, Appellate No. 00338, Case No. HEC009673 Riverside Superior Court Appeals Division, Riverside, California, January 21, 2003 copy at [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.religion.scientology/msg/7458b9baed7b5404?hl=en&amp;&amp;q=grassroots+public+policy+matters], see Attachment A, Background and timelines for H. Keith Henson.&lt;/ref&gt;

Henson married his first wife, [[Carolyn Meinel]], in 1967&lt;ref&gt;http://verbosity.wiw.org/issue6/meinel.html Interview with [[Carolyn Meinel]]&lt;/ref&gt; and they divorced in 1981.&lt;ref name="nss.org"/&gt;

==L5 Society==
In 1974, Henson's occasional [[rock climbing]] partner, [[physicist]] Dr. Dan Jones,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmt.edu/mainpage/giving/danjones.html Giving to New Mexico Tech] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080125014510/http://www.nmt.edu/mainpage/giving/danjones.html |date=January 25, 2008 }}, [[New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology]], retrieved 10-27-07.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced him to the [[space colonization]] work of Dr. [[Gerard K. O'Neill]] of [[Princeton University]].  To promote these ideas, Henson and Meinel founded the [[L5 Society]] in 1975.&lt;ref name="mambo"&gt;Regis, Ed. ''The Great Mambo Chicken and the Transhuman Condition: Science Slightly Over the Edge''. Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley Publishing Company. {{ISBN|0-201-56751-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark, Hans. ''The Space Station: A Personal Journey'', p. 54. Duke University Press, 1987. {{ISBN|0-8223-0727-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henson co-wrote papers for three Space Manufacturing conferences at Princeton.  The 1977 and 1979 papers were co-authored with [[Eric Drexler]].  Patents were issued on both subjects—vapor phase fabrication and space radiators.&lt;ref&gt;Henson, H.K., and K.E. Drexler. (1988) "Heterodensity heat transfer apparatus and method" U.S. Patent Office: #4,759,404 Henson, H.K., and K.E. Drexler. (1984) "Method for processing and fabricating metals in space" U.S. Patent Office: #4,480,677&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Henson testified before the [[United States Congress]] when the L5 Society successfully opposed the [[Moon Treaty]].  The society was represented by [[Leigh Ratiner]] (later a figure in the [[Inslaw]] proceedings).  The experience eventually became an article, ''Star Laws'', jointly written by Henson and Arel Lucas and published in ''[[Reason Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name="sci.space.policy post"&gt;[http://groups.google.ca/group/sci.space.policy/msg/3654d08deee4f4f0?hl=en&amp; sci.space.policy post]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Timothy Leary]] was influenced by Henson's work-and credited him in publications where he referred to Space Migration and Life Extension.

==Cryonics==
In 1985, having been convinced by [[Eric Drexler]] that [[nanotechnology]] provided a route to make it work, Henson, his wife, and their two-year-old daughter signed up with [[Alcor Life Extension Foundation|Alcor]] for [[cryonic suspension]]. Henson's daughter was the youngest member ever signed up to Alcor.&lt;ref name="regis104"&gt;{{cite book |title= Great Mambo Chicken and the Transhuman Condition: Science Slightly Over The Edge|last= Regis|first= Ed|authorlink=Ed Regis (author) |year= 1991|publisher= Westview Press|location= |isbn= 0-201-56751-2|page= |pages= 104–105|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Dora Kent]] problems,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alcor.org/Library/html/dorakent.html Dora Kent: Questions and Answers], Alcor Life Extension Foundation, ''Excerpted from Cryonics, March 1988''&lt;/ref&gt; Henson became increasingly active with Alcor.  After Alcor had to freeze their chief surgeon, he learned enough surgery to put several cryonics patients on [[cardiac bypass]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cryonet.org/cgi-bin/dsp.cgi?msg=1621 "Cryonics 'wet work'"], message posted by Keith Henson on the newsgroup sci.cryonics, 1993-15-Jan.&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote a column for Alcor's magazine, ''Cryonics'', for a few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henson persuaded [[Timothy Leary]] to become an Alcor Member-although Leary eventually dropped his membership.

In that same year, Henson moved to [[Silicon Valley]], consulting for a number of firms, and eventually debugging garbage collection software for the last stage of [[Project Xanadu]].  He was still working for the company that bought the Xanadu license when Scientology lawyer [[Helena Kobrin]] [[Scientology versus the Internet|tried to destroy]] the news group [[alt.religion.scientology]].&lt;ref name="Net.Wars"&gt;{{cite book | last = Grossman | first = Wendy | title = Net.Wars | origyear = 1997 | url = http://www.nyupress.org/netwars/ | accessdate = June 11, 2006 | publisher = New York University Press | location = New York | isbn = 0-8147-3103-1 | pages = 77–78 | chapter = Copyright Terrorists | chapterurl = http://www.nyupress.org/netwars/textonly/pages/chapter06/ch06_.html |date=October 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later e-mailed legal warnings to participants who had quoted as few as six lines of Scientology texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | first = Alan | last = Prendergast | title = Stalking the Net | url = http://www.westword.com/1995-10-04/news/stalking-the-net/full | work = [[Westword]] | publisher = Village Voice Media | date = October 4, 1995 | accessdate = March 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memetics==
Henson's wife, Arel Lucas, was credited by [[Douglas Hofstadter]] in ''[[Metamagical Themas]]'' for suggesting the study of [[memes]] be called [[memetics]]. Henson wrote two articles on memes in 1987, one published in ''[[Analog (magazine)|Analog]].'' The other, ''Memes, MetaMemes and Politics,'' circulated on the internet before being printed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,990753,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Dawkins]], who originated the concept of [[meme]]s, approvingly cites in the second edition of his book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' Henson's coining of the [[neologism]] ''memeoids'' to refer to "victims who have been taken over by a meme to the extent that their own survival becomes inconsequential."&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard. ''The Selfish Gene,'' p.330. Oxford University Press, 1989. {{ISBN|0-19-286092-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientology==
Henson has become one of the focal points of the ongoing struggle between the [[Church of Scientology]] and its critics, often referred to as [[Scientology versus the Internet]].  Henson entered the Scientology conflict when it was at its most heated, in the mid-1990s. In 1996, many of [[Scientology beliefs and practices|Scientology's secret writings]] were released onto the Internet, and the Church of Scientology embarked on a massive worldwide campaign to keep them from being spread to the general public. Henson examined these writings, entitled ''New Era Dianetics'' (NOTS), and from his examination of these secret documents, claimed that Scientology was committing [[Quackery|medical fraud]].&lt;ref name="UnfairGame"/&gt; The NOTS documents, he said, contained detailed instructions for the treatment of physical ailments and illnesses through the use of Scientology practices. A [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision in 1971 had declared that Scientology's writings were meant for "purely spiritual" purposes, and all Scientology books published since then have included disclaimers stating that Scientology's [[E-meter]] device "does nothing" and does not cure any physical ailments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

  |date=July 30, 1971
  |url=http://www.lermanet.com/exit/emetercases.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NOTS procedures, Henson claimed, were a violation of this decision. To prove his claim, Henson posted two pages from the NOTS documents onto the [[Usenet]] newsgroup ''alt.religion.scientology''.&lt;ref name="UnfairGame"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Slips"&gt;{{cite web | first = Judy | last = Bryan | title = Scientology Slips Through the Net| url = https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/1998/05/12355 | publisher = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | date = May 18, 1998| accessdate = September 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of Scientology immediately initiated legal action, but Henson did not retract his claims. He was served with a lawsuit by the church's legal arm, the [[Religious Technology Center]], (RTC). Henson defended himself. After a lengthy court battle involving massive amounts of paperwork, Henson was found guilty of [[copyright infringement]]. He was ordered to pay $75,000 in fines.&lt;ref name="UnfairGame"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Slips"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AtHome"&gt;{{cite web | first = Lucy| last = Morgan| title = At home: Critics public and private keep pressure on Scientology| url = http://www.sptimes.com/News/32999/Worldandnation/At_home__Critics_publ.html| publisher = [[St. Petersburg Times]] | date = March 29, 1999| accessdate = September 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henson declared bankruptcy in response to the judgment. Henson began protesting Scientology regularly, standing outside Scientology's [[Gold Base]], with a picket sign. The organization sought to obtain a restraining order, which failed.&lt;ref name="UnfairGame"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AtHome"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JudgeOKs"&gt;{{cite web| first = Susan| last = Thurston| title = Judge OKs picketing of church| url = http://www.press-enterprise.com/newsarchive/1998/02/21/888047199.html| publisher = [[The Press-Enterprise]]| date = February 21, 1998| accessdate = September 8, 2007| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928021518/http://www.press-enterprise.com/newsarchive/1998/02/21/888047199.html| archivedate = September 28, 2007| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this conflict, Henson was charged with three [[misdemeanor]]s under California Law: making criminal threats ([http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cacodes/pen/422.html California Penal Code section 422]), attempting to make criminal threats ([http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cacodes/pen/654-678.html California Penal Code section 422, charged pursuant to Penal Code 664, the "general attempt" statute]), and [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cacodes/pen/422.6-422.95.html threatening to interfere with freedom to enjoy a constitutional privilege].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Conviction of Scientology Critic Raises Free Speech Issue | url = http://w2.eff.org/effector/HTML/effect14.13.html#II | publisher = [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] | date = June 22, 2001| accessdate = December 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheriff's Detective Tony Greer, [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]] lead investigator, said: "In reviewing all of the Internet postings I did not see any direct threat of violence towards the church or any personnel of the church."&lt;ref name="UnfairGame"/&gt;

The jury verdict of the trial resulted in Henson being convicted of one of the three charges: "interfering with a religion." This [[misdemeanor]] charge carried a prison term of six months. On the other two charges, the jury did not agree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://75.28.114.12/OpenAccess/CRIMINAL/criminalcasereport.asp?defendantcount=1&amp;courtcode=C&amp;casenumber=HEM014371&amp;defnbr=547981&amp;defseq=1&amp;otnmseq=0&amp;defendantcount=1&amp;dsn=&amp;casedefendants=ON&amp;statussummary=ON&amp;charges=ON&amp;probation=ON&amp;relatedcases=ON&amp;alldisposedcases=ON&amp;actions=ON&amp;fineinfo=ON&amp;Submit=Format+the+Report Riverside County Superior Court Case Report]&lt;/ref&gt; Ken Hoden, the general manager of [[Golden Era Productions]] (the Church of Scientology's film production facility), claimed that Scientology's allegations against Henson had nothing to do with Scientology's [[Fair Game (Scientology)|Fair Game]] policy, and that no such policy existed.&lt;ref name="UnfairGame"&gt;{{cite news | author = Gale Holland | title = Unfair Game: Scientologists Get Their Man | url = http://www.laweekly.com/news/news/unfair-game/4713/ | publisher = [[LA Weekly]] | date = June 20, 2001 | accessdate = February 9, 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070210190653/http://www.laweekly.com/news/news/unfair-game/4713/ | archivedate = February 10, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henson stated his belief that if he went to prison, his life would be placed in jeopardy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://groups.google.com/group/alt.religion.scientology/msg/6618b1c3c0cce8c0?dmode=source&amp;hl=en Google Groups Archive] of posting of Henson's fax where he stated "I am all too aware that going back to the US puts my life in danger."&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than serve his sentence, Henson chose to enter Canada and apply for [[refugee|political asylum]]. Henson lived quietly in Brantford for three years while he awaited the decision. His request was ultimately denied and, in 2005, he was ordered to present himself for deportation and transfer to US authorities. Instead, Henson fled to the United States and later presented himself to the Canadian consulate in Detroit. He then settled in Prescott, Arizona where he remained for two years until his arrest in 2007 by Arizona authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Susan | last = Gamble | title = Man critical of Scientology, who fled Brantford in 2005, is arrested in United States | url = http://www.brantfordexpositor.ca/webapp/sitepages/content.asp?contentid=393597&amp;catname=Local%20News&amp;classif=News%20-%20Local | publisher = [[Brantford Expositor]] | date = February 7, 2007 | accessdate = February 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], as well as Henson's supporters on the [[USENET]] newsgroup ''alt.religion.scientology'', say that his trial was biased, unfair and a mockery of justice.&lt;ref name="eff"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2008/12/keith-henson-appeal-time-undo-injustice | title=Keith Henson Appeal: Time to Undo an Injustice | publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation | work=www.eff.org | date=December 24, 2008 | accessdate=November 3, 2011 | author=Cohn, Cindy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henson was prohibited by the trial judge, for example, from arguing that copying documents for the purpose of criticism is [[fair use]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eff.org/effector/HTML/effect14.13.html#II https://www.eff.org/effector/HTML/effect14.13.html#II]&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Henson's location as of February 3, 2007 was the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070223055726/http://www.co.yavapai.az.us/SOContent.aspx?id=19280 Yavapai Detention Center] in [[Prescott, Arizona]], awaiting possible extradition to [[Riverside County, California]].

The paper was presented by proxy on February 28, 2007.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070402181346/http://www.congrex.nl/06a12/]

The extradition hearing for Henson was postponed to May 8, 2007, at the request of Henson's attorney and the County attorney.&lt;ref&gt;[http://71.216.160.127/csp/pcc/csp4.csp?HENSON,HOWARD_KEITH&amp;DKT=2007020065J&amp;REP=7366&amp;TOT=55 Prescott Justice Court, Criminal Docket, Case 2007020065J]&lt;/ref&gt; At his release from jail, Henson was handed paper work from Riverside County, including a warrant from September 15, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www3.sympatico.ca/jdorsay/henson |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070808021307/http://www3.sympatico.ca/jdorsay/henson |archivedate=August 8, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the May 8, 2007 hearing, Henson was presented with an arrest warrant, and returned to jail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.10zenmonkeys.com/2007/05/09/keith-henson-back-in-jail-space-elevator-will-have-to-wait/ Keith Henson Back in Jail – Space Elevator Will Have To Wait – 10 Zen Monkeys&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Palo Alto Daily News|url=http://www.paloaltodailynews.com/article/2007-5-20-pa-keith-henson|title=Former resident faces extradition over Scientology clash|accessdate=May 29, 2007|date=May 20, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070524050439/http://www.paloaltodailynews.com/article/2007-5-20-pa-keith-henson &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = May 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Henson was jailed in Riverside, California for "using threats of force to interfere with another's exercise of civil rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Mike | last = Zapler | title = In jail for protesting Scientology, man seeks pardon | url = http://www.mercurynews.com/crime/ci_6327289 | work = [[San Jose Mercury News]] | publisher =  | date = July 8, 2007 | accessdate = August 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released in early September 2007.

==Energy systems==
From 2007 on, Henson worked independently and with others on the problems of global energy supply and affordable cost, particularly on ''power satellites'' for [[space-based solar power]].  There he was particularly concerned with launch cost, system mass, waste heat, heat radiators, and economics.

The power satellite work was reported in a series of articles starting with two posted on [[The Oil Drum]] 
[http://www.theoildrum.com/node/5485], [http://www.theoildrum.com/node/7898] and three presented at IEEE SusTech conferences for Sustainable Technology.  Henson also was involved in producing videos about beamed energy propulsion [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEkZkINrJaA] and thermal power satellites [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-Lrj35HcbQ], the latter of which won an award in international competition. (See Online Journal of Space Communication, Issue No. 18 under '''Works''', below.)

A shorter version was shown at the [[White House]] in the last days of the [[Obama Administration]] by Lt. Col Peter Garretson and Dr. Paul Jaffe as part of the D3 government-wide contest. See [http://www.maxwell.af.mil/News/Photos/igphoto/2001486838/] and  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrcoD_vHzxU].

Additionally, he worked over a year for Ed Kelly on [[StratoSolar]] [http://www.theoildrum.com/node/8323] when it seemed possible that ''high altitude lighter-than-air'' StratoSolar could beat the projected cost of power satellites.  (It may not, but the estimated cost of StratoSolar power with storage puts a ceiling on what electricity from space can be sold for.)

Henson visited [[Reaction Engines]] in the UK twice, in 2012 on the way back from a power satellite presentation in Germany ("Economic feedback for low-cost solar energy from space") and in 2016 when he gave a two-hour presentation to the engineering department of [[REL]] [https://htyp.org/File:REL2.pdf].  The latter, plus other, later discussions set the rate of expansion for producing Skylon rocket planes used in the ''power satellite'' business cases.

In early 2015 Henson created the Google group '''Power Satellite Economics''' where various concerned citizens and experts from many fields discuss the complexities and benefits of ''power satellites'' and related work [https://groups.google.com/d/forum/power-satellite-economics].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15366">'''Martial law in Poland''' ({{lang-pl|Stan wojenny w Polsce}}) refers to the period of time from December 13, 1981 to July 22, 1983, when the [[authoritarian]] [[communist government]] of the [[Polish People's Republic]] drastically restricted normal life by introducing [[martial law]] in an attempt to crush political opposition. Thousands of opposition activists were [[Internment|jailed]] without charge and as many as 91 killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6175517.stm Poland marks communist crackdown], [[BBC News]], 13 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Although martial law was lifted in 1983, many of the [[political prisoner]]s were not released until a general [[amnesty]] in 1986.

==Declaration==
[[File:Stan wojenny obwieszczenie.jpg|right|thumb|150px|The proclamation of martial law by the State Council]]
{{listen | filename =| title = Declaration of Martial Law | description = Jaruzelski declaring martial law}}
Led by [[General of the Army]] [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] and the [[Military Council of National Salvation]] (''Wojskowa Rada Ocalenia Narodowego'', WRON) usurped for itself powers reserved for wartime, hence the name. The plan was presented to the government of the [[Soviet Union]] before the declaration in March 1981.

Appearing on Polish television at 6:00 AM on December 13, 1981, General Jaruzelski said:&lt;ref&gt;The original is available at [http://www.konflikty.pl/a,395,Czasy_najnowsze,Przemowienie_gen._Jaruzelskiego.html Konflikty.pl] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112060937/http://www.konflikty.pl/a,395,Czasy_najnowsze,Przemowienie_gen._Jaruzelskiego.html |date=2012-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Today I address myself to you as a soldier and as the head of the Polish government. I address you concerning extraordinarily important questions. Our homeland is at the edge of an abyss. The achievements of many generations and the Polish home that has been built up from the dust are about to turn into ruins. State structures are ceasing to function. Each day delivers new blows to the waning economy./.../&lt;br&gt;The atmosphere of conflicts, misunderstanding, hatred causes moral degradation, surpasses the limits of toleration. Strikes, the readiness to strike, actions of protest have become a norm of life. Even school youth are being drawn into this. Yesterday evening, many public buildings remained seized. The cries are voiced to physical reprisals with the 'reds', with people who have different opinions. &lt;br&gt;The cases of terror, threats and moral vendetta, of even direct violence are on the rise. A wave of impudent crimes, robberies and burglaries is running across the country. The underground business sharks' fortunes, already reaching millions, are growing. Chaos and demoralization have reached the magnitude of a catastrophe. People have reached the limit of psychological toleration. Many people are struck by despair. Not only days, but hours as well are bringing forth the all-national disaster./.../&lt;br&gt;Citizens!&lt;br&gt;The load of responsibility that falls on me on this dramatic moment in the Polish history is huge. It is my duty to take this responsibility - concerning the future of Poland, that my generation fought for on all the fronts of the war and for which they sacrificed the best years of their life. I declare, that today the Military Council of National Salvation has been formed. In accordance with the Constitution, the State Council has imposed martial law all over the country. I wish that everyone understood the motives of our actions. A military coup, military dictatorship is not our goal./.../&lt;br&gt; In longer perspective, none of Poland's problems can be solved with the use of violence. The Military Council of National Salvation does not replace constitutional organs of power. Its only purpose is to keep the legal balance of the country, to create guarantees that give a chance to restore order and discipline. This is the ultimate way to bring the country out of the crisis, to save the country from collapse./.../&lt;br&gt;I appeal to all the citizens. A time of heavy trials has arrived. And we have to stand those in order to prove that we are worthy of Poland.&lt;br&gt;Before all the Polish people and the whole world I would like to repeat the immortal words: &lt;br&gt;
::'''''[[Poland Is Not Yet Lost|Poland has not yet perished, so long as we still live]]!'''''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Martial law==
[[File:T-55A Martial law Poland.jpg|thumb|250px|A column of [[T-55]] tanks enters the town of [[Zbąszynek]] while moving east towards the city of [[Poznań]], December 13, 1981]]
[[File:Telegr.jpg|thumb|250px|A censored telegram, 1982]]

General Jaruzelski had ordered the Polish General Staff to update plans for nationwide martial law on October 22, 1980.&lt;ref&gt;''From Solidarity to Martial Law: The Polish Crisis of 1980-1981 : A Documentary History'' by Andrzej Paczkowski, Malcolm Byrne. Central European University Press, Budapest 2007. p. xxxiii&lt;/ref&gt;
After the introduction of martial law, pro-[[democracy]] movements such as [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] and other smaller organisations were banned, and their leaders, including [[Lech Wałęsa]], jailed overnight. In the morning, thousands of soldiers in military vehicles appeared on the streets of every major city. A [[curfew]] was imposed, the national borders sealed, airports closed, and road access to main cities restricted. Telephone lines were disconnected, mail subject to renewed [[postal censorship]], all independent official organizations were criminalized, and classes in schools and universities suspended.

During the initial imposition of martial law, several dozen people were killed. Official reports during the crackdown claimed about a dozen fatalities, while a [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland|parliamentary]] commission in the years 1989-1991 arrived at a figure of over 90.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wyborcza.pl/1,77062,3787704.html Ofiary stanu wojennego i lat następnych do 1989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108144638/http://wyborcza.pl/1,77062,3787704.html |date=2014-01-08 }} by Piotr Lipiński&lt;/ref&gt; In the deadliest incident, nine coal miners were killed by [[ZOMO]] paramilitary police during the [[strike-breaking]] at the [[Pacification of Wujek]] on December 16, 1981. Others were also killed and wounded during a massive second wave of demonstrations on [[August 31, 1982 demonstrations in Poland|August 31, 1982]].

The government imposed a six-day work week while the mass media, public services, healthcare services, power stations, coal mines, sea ports, railway stations, and most key factories were placed under military management, with employees having to follow military orders or face a [[court martial]]. As part of the crackdown, media and educational institutions underwent "verification", a process that tested each employee's attitude towards the regime and to the Solidarity movement; as a result, thousands of journalists, teachers and professors were banned from their professions. [[Military court]]s were established to bypass the normal court system, to imprison those spreading "false information".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/special_report/1999/09/99/iron_curtain/timelines/poland_81.stm 1981: Martial law], [[BBC]]&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to crush resistance, civilian phone lines were routinely tapped and monitored by government agents.

At the invitation of Jaruzelski, a delegation of the ruling [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party]] visited Poland between December 27 and 29. The Hungarians shared with their Polish colleagues their experiences on crushing the [[1956 Hungarian revolution|'counterrevolution' of 1956]]. Earlier in the autumn of 1981, Polish television had broadcast a special film on the 1956 events in Hungary, showing scenes of rebels hanging security officers etc.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wI9TUaZZeAMC&amp;pg=PA499&amp;dq=jaruzelski+1981+martial+law&amp;ei=OpQbS9y8CJX0ygSkv5i7CQ#v=onepage&amp;q=jaruzelski%201981%20martial%20law&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of martial law was enthusiastically supported by some figures on the radical right like [[Jędrzej Giertych]],&lt;ref&gt;Polish Western affairs
, Volumes 31-32. Instytut Zachodni, 1990. [https://books.google.com/books?id=PepBAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22jedrzej+giertych%22&amp;dq=%22jedrzej+giertych%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=H625Td2YBoyeOo-RoKwP&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwCThk p. 165]&lt;/ref&gt; who believed Solidarity to be a disguised communist movement dominated by Jewish [[Trotskyite]]s.

==Economic crisis==
[[File:Kartka P3 11-83.jpeg|thumb|Food, alcohol, and cigarettes [[rationing]] card]]

Even after martial law was lifted, a number of restrictions remained in place for several years that drastically reduced the [[civil liberties]] of the citizenry. It also led to severe economic consequences. The ruling [[military dictatorship]] instituted major price rises (dubbed "economic reforms"), which resulted in a fall in real wages of 20% or more. The resulting [[economic crisis]] led to the [[rationing]] of most products and materials, including basic foodstuffs.

As a consequence of economic hardship and political repression, an exodus of Poles saw 700,000 emigrate to the West between 1981 and 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nypuJ8BARiMC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=poland+economy+1980s&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iR_fCDeyE6&amp;sig=q2hNTHlJPvd7MOfHIhY-lEKmJsc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lLEbS6OKG8z_4Abzt4TnAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=poland%20economy%201980s&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; 
A number of international flights were even hijacked in attempts to flee the country and its economic problems. Between December 1980 and October 1983, 11 Polish flights were hijacked to [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantic-times.com/archive_detail.php?recordID=673 A Symbol Of Allied Solidarity Will Disappear. Berlin - The Atlantic Times] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707184128/http://www.atlantic-times.com/archive_detail.php?recordID=673 |date=2011-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time, a group calling themselves the "Polish Revolutionary Home Army" seized the Polish Embassy in [[Bern]], [[Switzerland]] on 6 September 1982, taking several diplomats as hostages. However this turned out to be an apparent provocation by the communist Polish secret services aiming to discredit the Solidarity movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.start.umd.edu/start/data/tops/terrorist_organization_profile.asp?id=4206 Terrorist Organization Profile: Polish Revolutionary Home Army]&lt;/ref&gt;

==International response==
{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}

After the "Wujek" Coal Mine incident in Katowice on December 23, 1981, the [[United States]] imposed [[economic sanctions]] against the [[People's Republic of Poland]]. In 1982 the United States suspended [[most favored nation]] trade status until 1987 and vetoed Poland's application for membership in the [[International Monetary Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/poland/92.htm Poland - The United States]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

===Ruling of unconstitutionality===
After the [[fall of Communism in Poland]] in 1989, members of a parliamentary commission determined that martial law had been imposed in clear violation of the country's [[constitution]] which had authorized the executive to declare martial law only between parliamentary sessions (at other times the decision was to be taken by the [[Sejm]]). However, the Sejm had been in session at the time when martial law was instituted. In 1992 the Sejm declared the 1981 imposition of martial law to be unlawful and unconstitutional.

===Soviet intervention debate===
{{further|Soviet reaction to the Polish Crisis of 1980-1981}}
[[File:20061213 inscenizacja stan wojenny czterech.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Historical reenactment|Reenactment]] of the Martial law in Poland]]
The instigators of the martial law, such as [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], argue that the army crackdown rescued Poland from a possibly disastrous [[military intervention]] of the [[Soviet Union]], [[East Germany]], and other [[Warsaw Pact]] countries (similar to the earlier interventions in [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungary in 1956]] and [[Prague Spring|Czechoslovakia in 1968]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronews.net/2008/10/02/jaruzelski-says-martial-law-saved-poland/ Jaruzelski says martial law saved Poland], [[Euronews]], 02/10/08&lt;/ref&gt; Public figures who supported the introduction of martial law (including some of the right-wing figures like [[Jędrzej Giertych]]) would also refer to that threat.

In 2009, archive documents hinted that in a conversation Jaruzelski had with [[Viktor Kulikov]], a Soviet military leader, Jaruzelski himself begged for Soviet intervention as his domestic control was deteriorating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newpolandexpress.pl/npe_news_story-1531-jaruzelski_invited_soviet_invasion.php Newpolandexpress.pl] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009161848/http://www.newpolandexpress.pl/npe_news_story-1531-jaruzelski_invited_soviet_invasion.php |date=2011-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/Interview_Polands_Jaruzelski_Again_Denies_Seeking_Soviet_Intervention_Against_Solidarity/1902431.html Rferl.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Jaruzelski responded by claiming the document was 'just another falsification'.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

'''Militarism''' is the belief or the desire of a government or a people that a state should maintain a strong [[military]] capability and to use it aggressively to expand national interests and/or values.&lt;ref&gt;New Oxford American Dictionary (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; It may also imply the glorification of the military and of the ideals of a professional military class and the "predominance of the [[armed forces]] in the administration or policy of the state"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/militaristic|title=Militaristic - definition of militaristic by The Free Dictionary|work=TheFreeDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also: [[stratocracy]] and [[military junta]]).

Militarism has been a significant element of the [[imperialism|imperialist]] or [[expansionism|expansionist]] ideologies of several nations throughout history. Prominent examples include the Ancient [[Assyria]]n Empire, the Greek city state of [[Sparta]], the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Aztec]] nation, the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]]/[[House of Lorraine|Habsburg-Lorraine]] Monarchies, the [[Ottoman Empire]], the [[Empire of Japan]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Italian Empire]] during the rule of [[Benito Mussolini]], the [[German Empire]], the [[British Empire]], and the [[First French Empire]] under [[Napoleon]].

Although Bismarck was a civilian politician and not a military officer, he wore a military uniform as part of the Prussian militarist culture of the time. From a painting by [[Carl Steffeck]]]]
The roots of German militarism can be found in 19th-century [[Prussia]] and the subsequent unification of [[German Empire|Germany]] under Prussian leadership. After [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] conquered Prussia in 1806, one of the conditions of peace was that Prussia should reduce its army to no more than 42,000 men. In order that the country should not again be so easily conquered, the [[King of Prussia]] enrolled the permitted number of men for one year, then dismissed that group, and enrolled another of the same size, and so on. Thus, in the course of ten years, he was able to gather an army of 420,000 men who had at least one year of military training. The officers of the army were drawn almost entirely from among the land-owning [[nobility]]. The result was that there was gradually built up a large class of professional officers on the one hand, and a much larger class, the rank and file of the army, on the other. These enlisted men had become conditioned to obey implicitly all the commands of the officers, creating a [[Social class|class]]-based culture of [[deference]].

This system led to several consequences. Since the officer class also furnished most of the officials for the civil administration of the country, the interests of the army came to be considered as identical to the interests of the country as a whole. A second result was that the governing class desired to continue a system which gave them so much power over the common people, contributing to the continuing influence of the [[Junker]] noble classes.

Militarism in Germany continued after World War I and the fall of the German monarchy. During the period of the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919–1933), the [[Kapp Putsch]], an attempted [[coup d'état]] against the republican government, was launched by disaffected members of the armed forces. After this event, some of the more radical militarists and nationalists were submerged in grief and despair into the [[NSDAP]], while more moderate elements of militarism declined. The [[Third Reich]] was a strongly militarist state; after its fall in 1945, militarism in German culture was dramatically reduced as a backlash against the Nazi period.

The [[Federal Republic of Germany]] today maintains a [[Bundeswehr|large, modern military]] and has one of the [[list of countries by military expenditures#List|highest defence budgets]] in the world, although the defence budget accounts for less than 1.5 percent of Germany's GDP, is lower than e.g. that of France or Great Britain, and does not meet the 2 percent goal,
like most other [[NATO]] members.

===India===
[[File:NCCparade, India223.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Military parade in India]]
The rise of militarism in India dates back to the [[British Raj]] with the establishment of several [[Indian independence movement]] organizations such as the [[Indian National Army]] led by [[Subhas Chandra Bose]]. The Indian National Army (INA) played a crucial role in pressuring the British Raj after it occupied the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] with the help of [[Imperial Japan]], but the movement lost momentum due to lack of support by the [[Indian National Congress]], the [[Battle of Imphal]], and Bose's sudden death.

After India gained independence in 1947, [[India–Pakistan relations|tensions with neighboring Pakistan]] over the [[Kashmir dispute]] and other issues led the Indian government to emphasize military preparedness (see also the [[political integration of India]]).  After the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962, India dramatically expanded its military prowess which helped India emerge victorious during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]].&lt;ref&gt;Srinath Raghavan, ''1971: A Global History of the Creation of Bangladesh'' (Harvard Univ. Press, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; India became the second Asian country in the world to possess [[nuclear weapons]], culminating in the tests of 1998.&lt;ref&gt;George Perkovich, ''India's Nuclear Bomb'' (Univ. of California Press, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kashmiri insurgency]] and recent events including the [[Kargil War|Kargil War against Pakistan]], assured that the Indian government remained committed to military expansion.

In recent years the government has increased the military expenditure across all branches and embarked on a rapid modernization programme.

===Israel===
Israel's many [[Arab–Israeli conflict]]s since the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|Declaration of the Establishment of the State]] have led to a prominence of security and defense in politics and [[civil society]], resulting in many of Israel's former high-ranking military leaders becoming top politicians. (partial list: [[Yitzhak Rabin]], [[Ariel Sharon]], [[Ezer Weizman]], [[Ehud Barak]],  [[Shaul Mofaz]], [[Moshe Dayan]], [[Yitzhak Mordechai]], and [[Amram Mitzna]]).

===Japan===
{{Main article|Japanese militarism}}
[[File:Recruitment poster for the Tank School of the Imperial Japanese Army.jpg|thumb|1939 Recruitment poster for the Tank School of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]]]
In parallel with 20th-century German militarism, Japanese militarism began with a series of events by which the military gained prominence in dictating Japan's affairs. This was evident in 15th-century Japan's ''Sengoku'' period or ''Age of Warring States'', where powerful [[samurai]] warlords (''[[daimyō]]s'') played a significant role in Japanese politics. Japan's militarism is deeply rooted in the ancient samurai tradition, centuries before Japan's modernization. Even though a militarist philosophy was intrinsic to the shogunates, a [[Japanese nationalism|nationalist]] style of militarism developed after the [[Meiji Restoration]], which restored the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] to power and began the [[Empire of Japan]].  It is exemplified by the 1882 [[Imperial Rescript to Soldiers and Sailors]], which called for all members of the armed forces to have an absolute personal loyalty to the Emperor.

In the 20th century (approximately in the 1920s), two factors contributed both to the power of the military and chaos within its ranks. One was the [[Cabinet of Japan|Cabinet]] Law, which required the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (IJA) and [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) to nominate servinet could be formed. This essentially gave the military veto power over the formation of any Cabinet in the ostensibly parliamentary country. Another factor was ''[[gekokujō]]'', or institutionalized [[insubordination|disobedience]] by junior officers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft0w1003k0&amp;doc.view=content&amp;chunk.id=d0e489&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;anchor.id=0&amp;brand=eschol "Strengths and Weaknesses in the Decision-Making Process"] Craig AM ''in'' Vogel, EM (ed.), Modern Japanese Organization and Decision-Making,  University of California Press,  1987.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was not uncommon for radical junior officers to press their goals, to the extent of assassinating their seniors. In 1936, this phenomenon resulted in the [[February 26 Incident]], in which junior officers attempted a [[coup d'état]] and killed leading members of the Japanese government. The rebellion enraged Emperor [[Hirohito]] and he ordered its suppression, which was successfully carried out by loyal members of the military.

In the 1930s, the [[Great Depression]] wrecked Japan's economy and gave radical elements within the Japanese military the chance to realize their ambitions of conquering all of Asia. In 1931, the [[Kwantung Army]] (a Japanese military force stationed in [[Manchuria]]) staged the [[Mukden Incident]], which sparked the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Invasion of Manchuria]] and its transformation into the Japanese puppet state of [[Manchukuo]]. Six years later, the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] outside [[Beijing|Peking]] sparked the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937–1945). Japanese troops streamed into [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|China]], conquering Peking, [[Battle of Shanghai|Shanghai]], and the national capital of [[Battle of Nanking|Nanking]]; the last conquest was followed by the [[Nanking Massacre]]. In 1940, Japan entered into an [[Tripartite Pact|alliance]] with [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Fascist Italy]], two similarly militaristic states in Europe, and advanced out of China and into Southeast Asia. This brought about the intervention of the United States, which embargoed all [[petroleum]] to Japan. The embargo eventually precipitated the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the entry of the U.S. into World War II.

In 1945, Japan surrendered to the United States, beginning the [[Occupation of Japan]] and the purging of all militarist influences from Japanese society and politics. In 1947, the new [[Constitution of Japan]] supplanted the [[Meiji Constitution]] as the fundamental law of the country, replacing the rule of the Emperor with parliamentary government. With this event, the Empire of Japan officially came to an end and the modern [[State of Japan]] was founded.

===North Korea===
{{main article|Songun}}
[[File:Propaganda of North Korea (6073871366).jpg|thumb|left|North Korean propaganda mural]]
'''''Sŏn'gun''''' (often transliterated "'''songun'''"), [[North Korea]]'s "Military First" policy, regards military power as the highest priority of the country. This has escalated so much in the [[DPRK]] that one in five people serves in the armed forces, and the military has become one of the [[List of countries by number of military and paramilitary personnel|largest in the world]].

''Songun'' elevates the Korean People's Armed Forces within North Korea as an organization and as a state function, granting it the primary position in the [[Government of North Korea|North Korean government]] and society. The principle guides [[Politics of North Korea|domestic policy]] and [[Foreign relations of North Korea|international interactions]].&lt;ref name="Vorontsov"&gt;

It provides the framework of the government, designating the military as the "supreme repository of power". It also facilitates the militarization of non-military sectors by emphasizing the unity of the military and the people by spreading military culture among the masses.&lt;ref&gt;New Challenges of North Korean Foreign Policy By K. Park&lt;/ref&gt; The North Korean government grants the [[Korean People's Army]] as the highest priority in the economy and in resource-allocation, and positions it as the model for society to emulate.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 
''Songun'' is also the [[ideology|ideological]] concept behind a shift in policies (since the death of [[Kim Il-sung]] in 1994) which emphasize the people's military over all other aspects of state and the interests of the military comes first before the masses (workers).

===Philippines===
{{main article|Military history of the Philippines}}
[[File:Malolos Filipino Army.jpg|thumb|250px|the Philippine Army in [[Malolos]] Bulacan ca.1899]]
In the Pre-Colonial era, the [[Filipino people]] had their own forces, divided between the islands which each had its own ruler. They were called ''Sandig'' ([[wikt:guard|Guards]]), ''Kawal'' ([[Knights]]), and  ''Tanod''. They also served as the police and watchers on the land, coastlines and seas.  In 1521, The Visayan King of Mactan ''[[Lapu-Lapu]]'' of [[Cebu]], organized the first recorded military action against the Spanish colonizers, in the [[Battle of Mactan]].

In the 19th century during the [[Philippine Revolution]], [[Andrés Bonifacio]] founded the [[Katipunan]], a revolutionary organization against Spain at the [[Cry of Pugad Lawin]]. Some notable battles were the Siege of [[Baler]], The [[Battle of Imus]], Battle of Kawit, Battle of Nueva Ecija, the victorious [[Battle of Alapan]] and the famous [[Twin Battles of Binakayan and Dalahican]]. During [[Declaration of Philippine Independence|Independence]], the President General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] established the ''[[Magdalo (Katipunan faction)|Magdalo]]'', a faction separate from ''[[Katipunan]]'', and he declared the Revolutionary Government in the constitution of the [[First Philippine Republic]].

And during the [[Filipino-American War]], the [[General]] [[Antonio Luna]] as a High-Ranking General, He Ordered a [[Conscription]] to all Citizens, a mandatory form of National Services (at any War's) for the increase the density and the manpower of the [[Philippine Army]].

During World War II, the Philippines was one of the participants, as a member of Allied Forces, the Philippines with the U.S. Forces fought the Imperial Japanese Army, (1942–1945) the notable battles is the victorious [[Battle of Manila (1945)|Battle of Manila]], which also called "The Liberation".

During the 1970s the President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] declared P.D.1081 or [[martial law]], which also made the Philippines a [[garrison]] state. By the [[Philippine Constabulary]] (PC) and [[Integrated National Police]] (INP), The High-School or Secondary and College Education have a compulsory Curriculum concerning the Military, and nationalism which is the "Citizens Military Training" (CMT) And  "Reserve Officers Training Corps" (ROTC).
But in 1986, when the constitution changed, this form of National Service Training Program became non-compulsory but still part of the Basic Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/philamer/bbm8816.0001.001/*|title=Militarism in the Philippines:|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===

Militarism has a long history in [[Turkey]].

The [[Ottoman Empire]] lasted for centuries and always relied on its military might, but militarism was not a part of everyday life. Militarism was only introduced into daily life with the advent of modern institutions, particularly schools, which became part of the state apparatus when the Ottoman Empire was succeeded by a new nation state – the Republic of Turkey – in 1923. The founders of the republic were determined to break with the past and modernise the country. There was, however, an inherent contradiction in that their modernist vision was limited by their military roots. The leading reformers were all military men and, in keeping with the military tradition, all believed in the authority and the sacredness of the state. The public also believed in the military. It was the military, after all, who led the nation through the [[Turkish War of Independence|War of Liberation]] (1919–1923) and saved the motherland. The [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt|2016 attempted coup]] highlights the military influences within the country.

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries political and military leaders reformed the US federal government to establish a stronger central government than had ever previously existed for the purpose of enabling the nation [[American imperialism|to pursue an imperial policy]] in the Pacific and in the Caribbean and [[economic militarism]] to support the development of the new industrial economy. This reform was the result of a conflict between Neo-Hamiltonian Republicans and [[Jeffersonian political philosophy|Jeffersonian]]-[[Jacksonian democracy|Jacksonian]] Democrats over the proper administration of the state and direction of its foreign policy. The conflict pitted proponents of professionalism, based on business management principles, against those favoring more local control in the hands of laymen and political appointees. The outcome of this struggle, including a more professional federal civil service and a strengthened presidency and executive branch, made a more expansionist foreign policy possible.&lt;ref&gt;Fareed Zakaria, ''From Wealth to Power: The Unusual Origins of America's World Role'' (Princeton Univ. Press, 1998), chap.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of the [[American Civil War]] the national army fell into disrepair. Reforms based on various European states including Britain, Germany, and Switzerland were made so that it would become responsive to control from the central government, prepared for future conflicts, and develop refined command and support structures; these reforms led to the development of professional military thinkers and cadre.

During this time the ideas of [[Social Darwinism]] helped propel [[Overseas expansion of the United States|American overseas expansion]] in the Pacific and Caribbean.&lt;ref name="Hofstadter1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Hofstadter|title=Social Darwinism in American Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ty8aEmWc_ekC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Spanish-American%20War%22&amp;f=false|year=1992|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=978-0-8070-5503-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tucker2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Spencer Tucker|title=The Encyclopedia of the Spanish-American and Philippine-American Wars: A Political, Social, and Military History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8V3vZxOmHssC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22social%20Darwinism%22&amp;f=false|year=2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-951-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This required modifications for a more efficient central government due to the added administration requirements (see above).

The enlargement of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] for the [[Spanish–American War]] was considered essential to the occupation and control of the new territories acquired from Spain in its defeat ([[Guam]], the [[Philippines]], [[Puerto Rico]], and [[Cuba]]). The previous limit by legislation of 24,000 men was expanded to 60,000 regulars in the new army bill on 2 February 1901, with allowance at that time for expansion to 80,000 regulars by presidential discretion at times of national emergency.

U.S. forces were again enlarged immensely for World War I. Officers such as [[George S. Patton]] were permanent captains at the start of the war and received temporary promotions to colonel.

Between the first and second world wars, the [[US Marine Corps]] engaged in questionable activities in the [[Banana Wars]] in Latin America. Retired Major General [[Smedley Butler]], who was at the time of his death the most decorated Marine, spoke strongly against what he considered to be trends toward fascism and militarism.  Butler briefed Congress on what he described as a [[Business Plot]] for a military coup, for which he had been suggested as leader; the matter was partially corroborated, but the real threat has been disputed. The Latin American expeditions ended with [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[Good Neighbor policy]] of 1934.

[[File:President Barack Obama speaking on the military intervention in Libya at the National Defense University 9.jpg|thumb|250px|Former President [[Barack Obama]] speaking on the military intervention in Libya at the National Defense University.]]

After World War II, there were major cutbacks, such that units responding early in the Korean War under [[United Nations]] authority (e.g., [[Task Force Smith]]) were unprepared, resulting in catastrophic performance.  It should be noted that when [[Harry S. Truman]] fired [[Douglas MacArthur]], the tradition of civilian control held and MacArthur left without any hint of military coup.

The [[Cold War]] resulted in serious permanent military buildups. [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], a retired top military commander elected as a civilian President, warned, as he was leaving office, of the development of a [[military-industrial complex]].&lt;ref&gt;Audra J. Wolfe, ''Competing with the Soviets: Science, Technology, and the State in Cold War America'' (Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 2013), chap.2.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Cold War, there emerged many civilian academics and industrial researchers, such as [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[Herman Kahn]], who had significant input into the use of military force.  The complexities of nuclear strategy and the debates surrounding them helped produce a new group of 'defense intellectuals' and think tanks, such as the [[RAND Corporation|Rand Corporation]] (where Kahn, among others, worked).&lt;ref&gt;Fred Kaplan, ''The Wizards of Armageddon'' (1983, reissued 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that the United States has shifted to a state of neomilitarism since the end of the Vietnam War. This form of militarism is distinguished by the reliance on a relatively small number of volunteer fighters; heavy reliance on complex technologies; and the rationalization and expansion of government advertising and recruitment programs designed to promote military service.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alasdair Roberts (academic)|Roberts, Alasdair]].

The direct [[military budget of the United States]] for 2008 was $740,800,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/financial/fy2008/08stmt.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chavez Vive Militar.jpg|250px|thumbnail|left|Members of the [[Venezuelan armed forces]] carrying [[Chávez eyes]] flags saying, "Chávez lives, the fight continues".]]
Much of the modern political movement behind the [[Fifth Republic of Venezuela]], ruled by the Bolivarian government established by [[Hugo Chávez]], was built on the following of Bolívar and such militaristic ideals.&lt;ref name="REVspec"/&gt; Chávez often used [[Bolivarian propaganda]] to glorify the military, with Manuel Anselmi explaining in ''Chávez's Children: Ideology, Education, and Society in Latin America'', that "To get an idea of the importance of Bolivarian propaganda as a source of alternative political education one can use the testimony of Hugo Chávez himself". Chávez explained how he had "read the classics of socialism and of military theory and study the possible role of the army in a democratic popular revolt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anselmi|first=Manuel|title=Chávez's children : ideology, education, and society in Latin America|date=2013|isbn=978-0739165256|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 following the election of Hugo Chávez into the presidency, author [[Carlos Alberto Montaner]] described Chávez "as the new Venezuelan caudillo who would reformulate Venezuelan politics at his will".&lt;ref name="BLOCKcom"/&gt;

As Chávez took power of Venezuela, his influencer, left-wing Argentine sociologist [[Norberto Ceresole]], helped Chávez establish the Bolivarian movement in the shadow of Simón Bolívar's following, with Ceresole stating that:&lt;ref name="REVspec"/&gt;

{{quote|text=All of these elements ... a military leader becoming a strong man or national head, the absence of effective, intermediary civilian institutions, the presence of an important group of "apostles" that intervene with generosity and magnanimity between the strong man and the masses ... comprise a model of change — in truth, a revolutionary model — that is absolutely new, although in line with clear historical traditions.}}

[[File:Nicolas Maduro military.jpg|250px|thumb|right|President [[Nicolás Maduro]] among troops during a May 2016 exercise.]]
According to the [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]], under the Chávez presidency between 2004 and 2008, Venezuela moved from 55th place in arms importing to 18th, acquiring nearly $2 billion worth of weaponry from [[Russia]]. Domingo Alberto Rangel, founder of the [[Marxist]] Venezuelan political [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Venezuela)|Revolutionary Left Movement]], explained that Chávez's description of a movement being "Bolivarian" and "socialist" was contradictory, saying this "is tolerated and continues because the regime is both military and militaristic. ... Those who monopolize the decision in this regime are military men".&lt;ref name="REVspec"/&gt;

Chávez's handpicked successor, [[Nicolás Maduro]], relied on the military to maintain power when he was elected into office, with Luis Manuel Esculpi, a Venezuelan security analyst, stating that "The army is Maduro's only source of authority."&lt;ref name="WSJpadrino"/&gt; Maduro grew more reliant on the military through his presidency, showing that Maduro was losing power as described by [[Amherst College]] professor, Javier Corrales.&lt;ref name="DWpadrino"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Usi|first1=Eva|title=Vladimir Padrino: el hombre fuerte de Venezuela|url=http://www.dw.com/es/vladimir-padrino-el-hombre-fuerte-de-venezuela/a-19401032|accessdate=25 July 2016|agency=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corrales explains that "From 2003 until Chavez died in 2013, the civilian wing was strong, so he did not have to fall back on the military. As civilians withdrew their support, Maduro was forced to resort to military force."&lt;ref name="DWpadrino"/&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' states that Maduro no longer had the oil revenue to buy loyalty for protection, instead relying on favorable exchange rates, as well as the smuggling of food and drugs, which "also generate revenue" for troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taub|first1=Amanda|last2=Fisher|first2=Max|title=In Venezuela’s Chaos, Elites Play a High-Stakes Game for Survival|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/06/world/americas/venezuela-unrest-protests.html?_r=2|accessdate=23 May 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it should be noted that Venezuela denies the aggressive use of its army , as PSUV and the Bolivarian ideology claim to be anti-imperialist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2418">The '''Ministry of Justice''' ([[Quebec French|French]]: '''Ministère de la Justice''') is responsible for the administration of courts and prosecutors in [[Quebec]], [[Canada]]. The Minister is automatically the [[Attorney General]], and Registrar of Quebec.

The Ministry of Justice was created by the Department of Justice Act, which came into effect on June 4, 1965, making Quebec the first Canadian province to have a department of justice. The first Minister appointed under the new Act was [[Claude Wagner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rappel historique|url=http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/francais/ministere/histori.htm|website=www.justice.gouv.qc.ca|publisher=Ministry of Justice|accessdate=20 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231812/http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/francais/ministere/histori.htm|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 1965, the senior justice official in the province was the Attorney General. This role was created in 1867 replacing the role of [[Attorney General]] of [[Canada East]] and before 1841 the [[Attorney General]] of [[Lower Canada]].

In 1975, a working paper, ''La Justice Contemporaine'', proposed a comprehensive vision of the justice system in Quebec, and recommended unification of the provincial trial courts  The [[Court of Quebec]] was not established until 1988, after the merging of Provincial Court, the Court of the Sessions of the Peace and the Youth Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Peter H.|title=Canada's Trial Courts: Two Tiers Or One?|date=2007|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=9780802093233|page=125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sv_dIhD8Qr4C&amp;pg=PA125|accessdate=20 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|FullName=[[MouthShut.com]] and [[Faisal Farooqui]] , v. Union of India and Ors.
|Decided=24 March 2015
|Arguedat= New Delhi, India
}}

{{Italic title}}'''''MouthShut.com v. Union of India''''' was a case- a writ petition in the Supreme Court of India filed by the consumer review social media company [[Mouthshut.com]] to protect freedom of speech and expression on Internet. It argued against Sec. 66A and prayed for modifications or nullification of IT Rules and Section 79 of the Information Technology Act of India. The Supreme Court, in a historic judgement on March 24, 2015, ruled in favor of the petitioner(s) and repealed Sec. 66A, declaring it as unconstitutional and ordered reading down of various other sections of the IT Act, including section 79 and the IT Rules. As a result, Internet users are free to post anything online and publishers cannot be forced to take down content without a court order. This applies to all user-generated content online&lt;ref&gt;http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/FileServer/2015-03-24_1427183283.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The lawsuit and its proceedings were monitored by online Intermediaries, ISPs, telecom service providers and social media companies in India as well as overseas. According to the Center for Communication Governance, "this is one of the case under which India’s Supreme Court will define contours of free speech online."

The case was clubbed along with a petition filed by [[Shreya Singhal]] a law student, challenging India's IT Act's section 66A.
Because the hearing for all the petitions challenging the IT Act were clubbed together by a Supreme Court order, the matter is sometimes also referred as Shreya Singhal case.&lt;ref&gt;https://ccgnludelhi.wordpress.com/2015/01/09/notes-of-proceedings-i-shreya-singhal-v-union-of-india-w-p-crl-no-1672012/&lt;/ref&gt; Before the verdict, CNN reported that "...Mouthshut.com has taken its case to the country's Supreme Court to protect what it says are the rights of Indian citizens and consumers enshrined by the Indian constitution." &lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2015/02/16/asia/india-internet-freedom/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
MouthShut.com approached India's highest court- the Supreme Court of India arguing about the draconian effect of Sec. 66A. It also prayed that India's Information Technology Rules 2011 be nullified or modified. These petitions were filed in April 2013. Writ petition was filed by MouthShut.com under Article 32 of the Constitution as the IT Rules were violative of Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India.

Mouthshut.com contended that people who post reviews on the website are denied their fundamental right to freedom of expression due to the provisions of Sec. 66A. Besides, it said that the IT Rules pose a significant burden forcing them to screen content and exercise on-line censorship. While a private party may allege that certain content is defamatory or infringes copyright, such determinations are usually made by judges and involve factual inquiry and careful balancing of competing interests and factors, which the petitioners are not equipped to make. The petitioners receive notices and phone calls from cyber cells and police stations asking them to delete content and provide information of users, which makes the running of their business difficult.&lt;ref&gt;http://sflc.in/mouthshut-com-india-pvt-ltd-v-uoi-w-p-c-no-217-of-2013/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writ petition==
On 29 April 2013, it was argued by Senior Counsel Mr. Harish Salve for the petitioner. Upon accepting the petition, Supreme Court Justice TS Thakur and Justice Sudhansho Mukhopadhya ordered the petition requires simultaneous hearing along with '' 'Shreya Singhal versus Union of India' ''.&lt;ref&gt;http://courtnic.nic.in/supremecourt/temp/217201332942013p.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, many other civil liberty organizations, NGOs, individuals and the [[Internet and Mobile Association of India]] filed their own petitions that have been tagged along with the main petitions.

==MouthShut legal team==
Mouthshut.com's lead legal and general counsel is ''Mishi Chaudhary'' and her team at SFLC. They also received legal advice from and were represented by a battery of lawyers and senior counsels which included Adv. Harish Salve. Sr Counsel and Adv. Shyam Divan, Sr. Counsel. The Advocate on Record was Bina Madhavan of Lawyers Knit and Company. A two judge bench of the Hon'ble [[Supreme Court of India]] comprising Justice J. Chelameshwar and Justice Rohinton F. Nariman heard the matter of the various clubbed petitions and delivered the final verdict on March 24, 2015.

==Various other petition==
* PUCL vs. Union of India [W.P.(Crl) No. 199 of 2013]
* Shreya Singhal vs. Union of India (WP (Cr) 167/2012)
* Common Cause vs. Union of India [W.P.(C) No. 21 of 2013]

{{Nanjing Massacre}}

The '''Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal''' was established in 1946 by the [[government]] of [[Chiang Kai-shek]] to judge four [[Japanese Imperial Army]] officers accused of crimes committed during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. It was one of thirteen tribunals established by the Nationalist government.

The accused were Lieutenant General [[Hisao Tani]], company commander Captain Gunkichi Tanaka and Second Lieutenants [[Toshiaki Mukai]] and [[Tsuyoshi Noda]], made famous by the [[contest to kill 100 people using a sword]].

General [[Yasuji Okamura]] was convicted of war crimes in July 1948 by the Tribunal, but was immediately protected by the personal order of Nationalist leader [[Chiang Kai-shek]],&lt;ref&gt;

[[Herbert Bix]], ''[[Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan]]'', 2000, p.594.

&lt;/ref&gt; who retained him as a military adviser for the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT).&lt;ref&gt;

Budge, [http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/index.htm] Pacific War Online Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
While he was questioned by the investigators, he however testified about the [[Nanking massacre]]:&lt;ref name=Fujiwara&gt;{{cite book
 | title = The Nanking Atrocity 1937-1938 : Complicating the Picture
 | first = Bob Wakabayashi | last = Akira Fujiwara
 | publisher = Berghan Books
 | year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; "I surmised the following based on what I heard from Staff Officer Miyazaki, CCAA Special Service Department Chief Harada and Hangzhou Special Service Department Chief Hagiwara a day or two after I arrived in Shanghai. First, it is true that tens of thousands of acts of violence, such as looting and rape, took place against civilians during the assault on Nanking. Second, front-line troops indulged in the evil practice of executing POWs on the pretext of (lacking) rations." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

As [[Iwane Matsui]] had been judged by the [[Tokyo tribunal]]; Prince [[Prince Kan'in|Kotohito Kan'in]], [[Kesago Nakajima]] and [[Heisuke Yanagawa]] had been dead since 1945; [[Isamu Cho]] had committed suicide and [[Prince Asaka]] had been granted immunity by General [[Douglas MacArthur]] as a member of the imperial family, [[Hisao Tani]] was the only officer prosecuted for the [[Nanking massacre]]. He was found guilty on 6 February 1947 and [[Execution by firing squad|executed by a firing squad]] on 26 April. All the accused were sentenced to death in 1947.

According to the verdict of the Tribunal for Tani, on 10 March 1947, there were "more than 190,000 civilians and Chinese soldiers killed by machine gun whose corpses were burned to destroy proof. Besides, we count more than 150,000 victims of barbarous acts buried by the charity organizations. We thus have a total of more than 300,000 victims." &lt;ref&gt;

Tokushi Kasahara, [http://www.ihtp.cnrs.fr/sites/ihtp/IMG/pdf_interventionsnankin-francais.pdf ''Le massacre de Nankin et les mécanismes de sa négation par la classe politique dirigeante''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527174922/http://www.ihtp.cnrs.fr/sites/ihtp/IMG/pdf_interventionsnankin-francais.pdf |date=2013-05-27 }}.

&lt;/ref&gt; This estimate was made from burial records and eyewitness accounts.

The death toll of 300,000 is the official estimate engraved on the stone wall at the entrance of the [[Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall|Memorial Hall for Compatriot Victims of the Japanese Military's Nanjing Massacre]] in Nanjing.

The uniform '''net capital rule''' is a rule created by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] ("SEC") in 1975 to regulate directly the ability of [[broker-dealer]]s to meet their financial obligations to customers and other creditors.&lt;ref&gt;See Section 2 below.&lt;/ref&gt; Broker-dealers are companies that trade securities for customers (i.e., brokers) and for their own accounts (i.e., dealers).&lt;ref&gt;See Section 2.1 below.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule requires those firms to value their securities at [[Mark-to-market accounting|market prices]] and to apply to those values a [[Haircut (finance)|haircut]] (i.e., a discount) based on each security's risk characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/archive/1998/gg98153.pdf General Accounting Office (“GAO”) Report, “Risk-Based Capital, Regulatory and Industry Approaches to Capital and Risk,” GAO/GGD-98-153], July 1998 ("GAO Risk-Based Capital Report") at 132, fn. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The haircut values of securities are used to compute the liquidation value of a broker-dealer's assets to determine whether the broker-dealer holds enough liquid assets to pay all its non-subordinated liabilities and to still retain a "cushion" of required liquid assets (i.e., the "net capital" requirement) to ensure payment of all obligations owed to customers if there is a delay in liquidating the assets.&lt;ref&gt;See Section 3.1 below&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 28, 2004, the SEC voted unanimously to permit the largest broker-dealers (i.e., those with "tentative net capital" of more than $5 billion) to apply for exemptions from this established "haircut" method.&lt;ref&gt;See Section 5 below and, for details of the SEC action, [http://www.gao.gov/decisions/majrule/d04896r.pdf GAO, Major Rule Report: Alternative Net Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers That Are Part of Consolidated Supervised Entities] (B-294184), June 25, 2004. ("GAO Major Rule Report")&lt;/ref&gt; Upon receiving SEC approval, those firms were permitted to use mathematical models to compute the haircuts on their securities based on international standards used by commercial banks.&lt;ref&gt;See Section 5 below.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, many commentators on the [[financial crisis of 2007-2009]] have identified the 2004 rule change as an important cause of the crisis on the basis it permitted certain large investment banks (i.e., [[Bear Stearns]], [[Goldman Sachs]], [[Lehman Brothers]], [[Merrill Lynch]], and [[Morgan Stanley]]) to increase dramatically their [[Leverage (finance)|leverage]] (i.e., the ratio of their debt or assets to their equity).&lt;ref&gt;See Section 1.1 below.&lt;/ref&gt; Financial reports filed by those companies show an increase in their leverage ratios from 2004 through 2007 (and into 2008), but financial reports filed by the same companies before 2004 show higher reported leverage ratios for four of the five firms in years before 2004.&lt;ref&gt;See Section 1.1 and 7.2 below.  The leverage ratios for the five companies (A) from 1993 to 2002 are found in note 95 below and (B) from 2003 to 2007 in note 93 below.  Notes 95-97 below contain information on the fiscal quarter end leverage reported by these firms in various Form 10-Q Reports for fiscal quarters in the 1990s and after 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2004 rule change remains in effect.  The companies that received SEC approval to use its haircut computation method continue to use that method, subject to modifications that became effective January 1, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;See Section 1.3 below.  As explained there, (1) the assets of Lehman Brothers Inc were acquired by [[Barclays Capital]], and the SEC granted Barclays approval, with restrictions, to continue using the new method for the operation of that business and (2) the Bear Stearns [[broker-dealer]] authorized to use the new method continued to use that method as part of JP Morgan Chase.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The net capital rule and the financial crisis of 2007-2009==

===2008 explanation===

Beginning in 2008, many observers remarked that the 2004 change to the SEC's net capital rule permitted investment banks to increase their leverage and this played a central role in the [[financial crisis of 2007-2009]].

This position appears to have been first described by Lee A. Pickard, Director of the SEC's Division of Market Regulation (the former name of the current Division of Trading and Markets) at the time the SEC's uniform net capital rule was adopted in 1975.  In an August 8, 2008, commentary, Mr. Pickard wrote that before the 2004 rule change, broker-dealers were limited in the amount of debt they could incur, to a ratio of about 12 times their net capital, but that they operated at significantly lower ratios.  He concluded that, if they had been subject to the net capital rule as it existed before the 2004 rule change, broker-dealers would not have been able to incur their high debt levels without first having increased their capital bases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanbanker.com/more-viewpoints.html?dprtmnt=natiglob%20-%2065k%20-  Lee A. Pickard, “Viewpoint:  SEC’s Old Capital Approach Was Tried--And True”], ''[[American Banker]]'', August 8, 2008, at page 10 (Before the rule change "the broker-dealer was limited in the amount of debt it could incur, to about 12 times its net capital, though for various reason broker-dealers operated at significantly lower ratios...If, however, Bear Stearns and other large broker-dealers had been subject to the typical haircuts on their securities positions, an aggregate indebtedness restriction, and other provisions for determining required net capital under the traditional standards, they would not have been able to incur their high debt leverage without substantially increasing their capital base.").&lt;/ref&gt; In what became a widely cited September 18, 2008, ''[[New York Sun]]'' article (the "2008 NY Sun Article"), Mr. Pickard was quoted as stating the SEC's 2004 rule change was the primary reason large losses were incurred at investment banks.&lt;ref name="NYSun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/business/ex-sec-official-blames-agency-for-blow-up/86130/|title=Ex-SEC Official Blames Agency for Blow-Up of Broker-Dealers|last=Satow|first=Julie|date=September 18, 2008|accessdate=4 January 2010}} (quoting Mr. Pickard as stating "The SEC modification in 2004 is the primary reason for all of the losses that have occurred."  Separately, the article states "the SEC, under its new Consolidated Supervised Entities program, allowed the broker dealers to increase their debt-to-net-capital ratios, sometimes, as in the case of Merrill Lynch, to as high as 40-to-1.").  A later report stated Mr. Pickard "estimated that prior to the 2004 program most firms never exceeded an 8-to-1 debt-to-net capital ratio" [https://www.propublica.org/article/flawed-sec-program-failed-to-rein-in-investment-banks-101 Ben Protess, “’Flawed’ SEC Program Failed to Rein in Investment Banks”], ProPublica, October 1, 2008.  As late as February 18, 2009, Mr. Pickard was still being quoted as recalling "banks rarely exceeded gross leverage over about 6% on his own watch at the SEC in the late 1970s.  In the following decades, leverage generally ranged around 12%, comfortably beneath the rule's 15% ceiling."  Vanessa Drucker, [http://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2009/02/the_sec_killed_wall_street_on.html “The SEC Killed Wall Street On April 28, 2004”], Real Clear Markets, February 18, 2009.  Compare these statements with the pre-2004 leverage information described below in Section 4.1 (for broker-dealers) and 7.2 (for holding companies).&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most influential review of the 2004 rule change was an October 3, 2008, front page ''[[New York Times]]'' article titled "Agency's '04 Rule Let Banks Pile Up New Debt" (the "2008 NY Times Article").  That article explained the net capital rule applied to the "brokerage units" of investment banks and stated the 2004 rule change created "an exemption" from an old rule that limited the amount of debt they could take on.  According to the article, the rule change unshackled "billions of dollars held in reserve against losses" and led to investment banks dramatically increasing their leverage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/business/03sec.html Stephen Labaton, “Agency’s ’04 Rule Let Banks Pile Up New Debt”], ''[[New York Times]]'', October 3, 2008, page A1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2008 and early 2009, prominent scholars such as [[Alan Blinder]], [[John Coffee]], [[Niall Ferguson]], and [[Joseph Stiglitz]] explained (1) the old net capital rule limited investment bank leverage (defined as the ratio of debt to equity) to 12 (or 15) to 1 and (2) following the 2004 rule change, which relaxed or eliminated this restriction, investment bank leverage increased dramatically to 30 and even 40 to 1 or more.  The investment bank leverage cited by these scholars was the leverage reported by the [[Consolidated Supervised Entity]] Holding Companies in their financial reports filed with the SEC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2008/12/banks200812 Niall Ferguson,“Wall Street Lays Another Egg”], ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', December 2008, at page 4.  ("It was not unusual for investment banks' balance sheets to be as much as 20 or 30 time larger than their capital, thanks in large part to a 2004 rule change by the Securities and Exchange Commission that exempted the five largest of those banks from the regulation that had capped their debt-to-capital ratio at 12 to 1.")  [http://www.law.com/jsp/PubArticle.jsp?id=1202426495544 John C. Coffee, “Analyzing the Credit Crisis:  Was the SEC Missing in Action?”] ("Was the SEC Missing in Action?"), ''[[New York Law Journal]]'', (December 5, 2008)  ("For most broker-dealers this 15 to 1 debt to net capital ratio was the operative limit within which they needed to remain by a comfortable margin"... [after the rule change] "The result was predictable:  all five of these major investment banks increased their debt-to-equity leverage ratios significantly in the period following their entry into the CSE program.") [http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/2009/01/stiglitz200901 Joseph E. Stiglitz, “Capitalist Fools”], ''Vanity Fair'', January 2009, at page 3.  ("There were other important steps down the deregulatory path.  One was the decision in April 2004 by the Securities and Exchange Commission, at a meeting attended by virtually no one and largely overlooked at the time, to allow big investment banks to increase their debt-to-capital ratio (from 12:1 to 30:1, or higher) so that they could buy more mortgage-backed securities, inflating the housing bubble in the process.")  [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/business/economy/25view.html Alan S. Blinder, “Six Errors on the Path to the Financial Crisis”], ''[[New York Times]]'', January 25, 2009, page BU7.  ("The second error came in 2004, when the S.E.C. let securities firms raise their leverage sharply.  Before then, leverage of 12 to 1 was typical; afterward, it shot up to more like 33 to 1.  What were the S.E.C. and the heads of firms thinking?  Remember, under 33-to-1 leverage, a mere 3 percent decline in asset values wipes out a company.  Had leverage stayed at 12 to 1, these firms wouldn't have grown as big or been as fragile.")&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel Gross]] wrote in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine: "Going public allowed investment banks to get bigger, which then gave them the heft to mold the regulatory system to their liking. Perhaps the most disastrous decision of the past decade was the Securities and Exchange Commission's 2004 rule change allowing investment banks to increase the amount of debt they could take on their books—a move made at the request of the Gang of Five's CEOs." He was referring to the net capital rule change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2242964/ The Gang of Five and How They Nearly Ruined Us - ''Slate''-January 29,2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

===SEC response===

In connection with an investigation into the SEC's role in the collapse of Bear Stearns, in late September, 2008, the SEC's Division of Trading and Markets responded to an early formulation of this position by maintaining (1) it confuses leverage at the Bear Stearns holding company, which was never regulated by the net capital rule, with leverage at the broker-dealer subsidiaries covered by the net capital rule, and (2) before and after the 2004 rule change the broker-dealers covered by the 2004 rule change were subject to a net capital requirement equal to 2% of customer receivables not a 12 to 1 leverage test.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sec-oig.gov/Reports/AuditsInspections/2008/446-a.pdf U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Office of Inspector General, Office of Audits (“SEC OIG”), “SEC’s Oversight of Bear Stearns and Related Entities: The Consolidated Supervised Entity Program,” Report No. 446-A], September 25, 2008 ("OIG Bear Stearns CSE Report"), at page 87 of the full Report.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an April 9, 2009, speech ("2009 Sirri Speech") Erik Sirri, then Director of the SEC's Division of Trading and Markets, expanded on this explanation by stating (1) the 2004 rule change did not affect the "basic" net capital rule that had a leverage limit (albeit one that excluded much broker-dealer debt), (2) an "alternative" net capital rule established in 1975 that did not contain a direct leverage limit applied to the broker-dealer subsidiaries of the five largest investment banks (and other large broker-dealers), and (3) neither form of the net capital rule was designed (nor operated) to constrain leverage at the investment bank holding company level, where leverage and, more important, risk was concentrated in business units other than broker-dealer subsidiaries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2009/spch040909ers.htm April 9, 2009, speech], Erik Sirri, Director of the SEC's Division of Trading and Markets (the "2009 Sirri Speech").  In the speech Director Sirri notes four "fatal flaws" in the belief that the 2004 rule change was a "major contributor to the current crisis":  (1) the rule change "did not undo any leverage restriction"; (2) the "'12-to-1' restriction" was not affected by the rule change and, in any case, the CSE Brokers "had been using a different financial ratio since the late 1970s"; (3) broker-dealers subject to the "'12-to-1' restriction" were required to give an "early warning" if their "aggregate indebtedness" exceeded 12 times their net capital, but "aggregate indebtedness" excluded "substantial portions of the balance sheets" of broker-dealers, because much of their indebtedness arose from "securities financing transactions", such as repurchase transactions, not included in "aggregate indebtedness", so that even the "'12-to 1' restriction" was "not an absolute constraint on leverage"; and (4) the net capital rule never constrained leverage at the investment bank holding company level, and "many of the investment banks' activities--including those with the highest level of inherent risk-- such as OTC derivatives dealing and the originating and warehousing of real estate and corporate loans occurred outside the US broker-dealer subsidiary."  Finally, Mr. Sirri noted "leverage restrictions can provide false comfort" because "The degree of risk arising from leverage is dependent on the type of assets and liabilities making up the balance sheet."

Along with identifying the "early warning" requirement under the "aggregate indebtedness" ratio test as the probable source for the otherwise mysterious misconception that the CSE Brokers had been subject to a "12-to-1" leverage limit before 2004, Mr. Sirri's speech emphasized that the CSE Brokers were subject to an "early warning" requirement to notify the SEC if their "tentative net capital" fell below $5 billion and that this requirement "was designed to ensure that the use of models to compute haircuts would not substantially change the amount of capital maintained by the broker-dealers."  Mr. Sirri also stated the "capital levels in the broker-dealer subsidiaries remained relatively stable after they began operating under the 2004 amendments, and, in some cases, increased significantly."

The importance of the $5 billion tentative net capital "early warning" trigger was emphasized repeatedly at the April 28, 2004, Open Meeting at which the SEC voted to adopt the 2004 rule change.  In the [http://www.connectlive.com/events/secopenmeetings/2004index.html Windows Player audio tape of the hearing] the rule change is item 3 on the agenda of the 2 hour meeting.  Starting 1:20 into the audio, Annette Nazareth, Director Market Regulation, and Michael Macchiaroli, Assistant Director, explain that without the $5 billion early warning requirement the reduction in haircuts could be more than 50%, but that after giving effect to the early warning requirement the haircuts would, in effect, be limited to about 20-30% less than before.  1:50 into the audio they explain that the $5 billion early warning was also what the broker-dealers themselves thought their customers would expect.  The eventual CSE Brokers were described as not wanting a rule in which minimum net capital levels would be below that amount, because of the effect it could have on the confidence of their customers.  The SEC release adopting the rule change explained the $5 billion "early warning" requirement was not included in the October 2003 proposed rule change, but was added "based on staff's experience and the current levels of net capital maintained by the broker-dealers most likely to apply to use the alternative method of computing net capital."  69 Federal Register 34431 (June 21, 2004).

Media reports of the April 28, 2004, Open Meeting have noted the moment 1:44 into the Windows Player version where Commissioner Goldschmid points out that, because the rule change will affect only the largest broker-dealers, "if anything goes wrong, its going to be an awfully big mess" followed by what the 2008 NY Times Article described as "nervous laughter." See Kevin Drawbaugh, [http://securities.stanford.edu/news-archive/2004/20040428_Headline08_Drawbaugh.htm “US SEC Clears New Net-Capital Rules for Brokerages”], Reuters, April 28, 2004  ("SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins said monitoring the sophisticated models used by the brokerages under the CSE rules -- and stepping in where net capital falls too low -- 'is going to present a real management challenge' for the SEC.  Since the new CSE rules will apply to the largest brokerages without bank affiliates, SEC Commissioner Harvey Goldschmid said, 'If anything goes wrong, it's going to be an awfully big mess.'").  2008 NY Times Article (""We've said these are the big guys,' Mr. Goldschmid said, provoking nervous laughter, 'but that means if anything goes wrong, it's going to be an awfully big mess.").  Moments later, after Director Nazareth answers the question introduced by that comment, just short of 1:45 into the audio, Professor Goldschmid responds "No, I think you have been very good at thinking this through carefully and working it through with skill."  At the beginning of his questioning (1:41 into the audio) Professor Goldschmid had commented on how he and staff had "talked a lot on this", and later (at 1:47) he remarks on the "well more than 400 page" briefing book prepared by staff concerning the proposed rule change.  At 1:48 he concludes his remarks by stating "Congratulations, I think you're in very good shape."  At the end of the tape the five Commissioners unanimously approve the rule change.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a July 2009 report, the Government Accountability Office ("GAO") reported that SEC staff had stated to the GAO that (1) CSE Brokers did not take on larger proprietary positions after applying reduced haircuts to those positions under the 2004 rule change and (2) leverage at those CSE Brokers was driven by customer margin loans, repurchase agreements, and stock lending, which were marked daily and secured by collateral that exposed the CSE Brokers to little if any risk.  The report also stated officials at a former CSE Holding Company told the GAO they did not join the CSE program to increase leverage.  The GAO confirmed that leverage at the CSE Holding Companies had been higher at the end of 1998 than at the end of 2006 just before the financial crisis began.  The GAO report includes a comment letter from the SEC that reaffirms points raised in the 2009 Sirri Speech and states that commentators have "mischaracterized" the 2004 rule change as having allowed CSE Brokers to increase their leverage or as having been a major contributor to the financial crisis.  The letter states that the CSE Broker "tentative net capital" levels "remained relatively stable after they began operating under the 2004 amendments, and, in some cases, increased significantly."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09739.pdf GAO, “Financial Markets Regulation:  Financial Crisis Highlights Need to Improve Oversight of Leverage at Financial Institutions and across System”, GAO-09-739], July 2009 ("GAO 2009 Financial Crisis Report") at 38 to 42 (for SEC staff statements reported by the GAO and for GAO findings) and at 117 to 120 (for the SEC letter to the GAO).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status of 2004 rule change===

It has been widely noted that all five of the investment bank holding companies affected by the 2004 rule change no longer exist as independent companies or have converted into bank holding companies.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.law.com/jsp/PubArticle.jsp?id=1202426495544 Was the SEC Missing in Action?] ("the United States, as of the beginning of 2008, had five major investment banks that were not owned by a larger commercial bank: Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns. By the late Fall of 2008, all of these investment banks had either failed or abandoned their status as independent investment banks. Two (Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch) had been forced at the brink of insolvency to merge with larger commercial banks in transactions orchestrated by banking regulators. One -- Lehman Brothers -- had filed for bankruptcy, and the two remaining investment banks -- Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley -- had converted into bank holding companies under pressure from the Federal Reserve Bank, thus moving from SEC to Federal Reserve supervision.  Each of these firms had survived prior recessions, market panics, and repeated turmoil and had long histories extending back as far as the pre-Civil War era.  If their uniform collapse was not enough to suggest the possibility of regulatory failure, one additional common fact unites them: each of these five firms voluntarily entered into the SEC's Consolidated Supervised Entity ("CSE") program, which was established by the SEC in 2004 for only the largest investment banks.  Indeed, these five investment banks were the only free-standing investment banks permitted by the SEC to enter the CSE program.")&lt;/ref&gt; Less noted is that the five broker-dealers originally owned by those investment bank holding companies continue to compute their compliance with the SEC's net capital rule using the alternative net capital computation method established by the 2004 rule change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09499t.pdf GAO, "Financial Regulation:  Review of Regulators’ Oversight of Risk Management Systems at a Limited Number of Large, Complex Financial Institutions"], Statement of Orice M.

GAO 2009 Financial Crisis Report at 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her [[prepared testimony]] for a January 14, 2010, hearing before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission ("FCIC"), SEC Chair Mary Schapiro stated SEC staff had informed CSE Brokers in December 2009 that "they will require that these broker-dealers take standardized net capital charges on less liquid mortgage and other asset-backed securities positions rather than using financial models to calculate net capital requirements."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/2010/ts011410mls.htm Chairman Mary L. Schapiro, “Testimony Concerning the State of the Financial Crisis”], Before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, January 14, 2010.  Chairman Schapiro's prepared testimony also explained the SEC staff was requiring all broker-dealers with "significant proprietary positions" to provide more detailed breakdown of their holdings to better monitor illiquid positions, was requiring CSE Brokers to report more details of balance sheet composition to "monitor for the build-up of positions in particular assets classes", and "may recommend additional regulatory capital charges to address liquidity risk."  More generally, she stated that in November 2009 the SEC established "a task force led by its newly-established Division of Risk, Strategy, and Financial Innovation that will review key aspects of the agency's financial regulation of broker-dealers to determine how such regulation can be strengthened."&lt;/ref&gt; In her prepared testimony for an April 20, 2010, hearing before the House Financial Services Committee, Chairman Schapiro repeated this explanation and added that the new requirements took effect January 1, 2010.  She also stated the SEC was reviewing whether the "alternative net capital computation" system established by the 2004 rule change "should be substantially modified" and more generally whether minimum net capital requirements should be increased for all broker-dealers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.house.gov/apps/list/hearing/financialsvcs_dem/schapiro_4.20.10.pdf Testimony Concerning the Lehman Brothers Examiner’s Report by Chairman Mary L. Schapiro, U.S. Securities Exchange Commission”] Before the House Financial Services Commission, April 20, 2010.  At 3 she explains the alternative net capital (ANC) computation program.  At 11 she describes the changes to the ANC computation and the review of possible further changes to the ANC computation and to the overall net capital rule.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background to and adoption of net capital rule==

The SEC's "Uniform Net Capital Rule" (the "Basic Method") was adopted in 1975 following a financial market and broker record-keeping crisis during the period from 1967-1970.  In the same 1975 release that adopted the Basic Method, the SEC established the "Alternative Net Capital Requirement for Certain Brokers and Dealers" (the "Alternative Method").&lt;ref&gt;Jerry W. Markham and Thomas Lee Hazen, ''Broker-Dealer Operations Under Securities and Commodities Law'', (West Group, 2002, supplemented through Supplement 8, October 2008) Volume 23 Securities Law Series ("Markham/ Hazen BD Law") at pages 4-4.1 to 4-17.  The 1967-70 crisis had led to the creation of the [[Securities Investor Protection Corporation]] ("SIPC") after [[New York Stock Exchange]] ("NYSE") member firms contributed $140 million to a trust fund to compensate customers of failed fellow members of the NYSE.  See SEC Release 34-9891, 38 Federal Register 56 (January 3, 1973).  While the SEC had required capital tests for broker-dealers since the 1930s, it had permitted "self-regulatory" exchanges such as the NYSE to impose and supervise specific standards before the 1967-70 crisis.  That crisis had led to legislation requiring the SEC to "establish minimum financial responsibility requirements for all brokers and dealers."  [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/glj72&amp;div=7&amp;id=&amp;page= Steven L. Molinari and Nelson S. Kibler, "Broker-Dealers’ Financial Responsibility under the Uniform Net Capital Rule--A Case for Liquidity"], 72 Georgetown Law Journal 1 (1983) ("Molinari/Kibler Financial Responsibility"), at 9-18 (quoted statutory language at 15).&lt;/ref&gt; The SEC had maintained a net capital rule since 1944, but had exempted broker-dealers subject to "more comprehensive" capital requirements imposed by identified exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  The 1975 uniform net capital rule continued many features of the existing SEC net capital rule, but adopted other (more stringent) requirements of the NYSE net capital rule.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Wolfson and Egon Guttman, "The Net Capital Rule for Brokers and Dealers", 24 Stanford Law Review 603 (1971–1972) for the history and content of the SEC and NYSE net capital rules.  This article especially notes the importance of prohibiting repayment of subordinated debt if it would cause the broker-dealer to violate the net capital rule (or to violate a lower "early warning" requirement) and the need for the SEC to impose a "uniform rule" so that NYSE and other exchanges could not interpret their rule more liberally than the SEC would consider necessary to protect customers.  At 605 to 606 the article explains Section 8(b) of the original Securities Exchange Act of 1934 authorized the SEC to limit to no more than 20 to 1 the aggregate indebtedness to net capital of broker-dealer members of national securities exchanges.  At 606 the article explains that in 1938 Congress added Section 15(c)(3) to the Exchange Act to authorize SEC net capital and other financial responsibility rules for "over-the-counter" brokers and dealers.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rule applies to broker-dealers, not their parent holding companies===

Both the Basic Method and the Alternative Method applied to [[broker-dealer]]s.  At no time did the SEC impose a net capital requirement on the holding company parent of a broker-dealer.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.gao.gov/archive/1998/gg98153.pdf General Accounting Office (“GAO”) Report, “Risk-Based Capital, Regulatory and Industry Approaches to Capital and Risk,” GAO/GGD-98-153], July 1998 ("GAO Risk-Based Capital Report"), at pages 54-55 and 130-131 ("The net capital rule applies only to the registered broker-dealer and does not apply to the broker-dealer's holding company or unregulated subsidiaries or affiliates"), and [http://www.gao.gov/archive/2000/gg00003.pdf GAO Report, “Long-Term Capital Management: Regulators Need to Focus Greater Attention on Systemic Risk,” GAO/GGD-00-3], October 1999 ("GAO LTCM Report"), at 24-25, for discussions of the SEC's lack of authority over affiliates of broker-dealers before the repeal of the [[Glass–Steagall Act]].

In practice, brokers are typically also dealers, so the term broker-dealer is ubiquitous.  Norman S. Poser and James A. Fanto, ''Broker-Dealer Law and Regulation'', (Aspen Publishers 4th Edition, through 2008 Supplement) ("Poser/Fanto BD Regulation") at § 1.01, page 1-7.&lt;/ref&gt; The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 had given the SEC authority to regulate the financial condition of broker-dealers to provide customers some assurance that their broker could meet its obligations to them.&lt;ref&gt;GAO Risk-Based Capital Report at 53-54.  Markham/Hazen BD Law at page 4-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Holding companies that owned broker-dealers were treated like other "unregulated" companies to which parties extend credit based on their own judgments without the assurance provided by regulatory oversight of a company's financial condition.  In practice, the "independent check" on such financial condition became the [[rating agencies]].  In order to conduct their dealer and other credit sensitive activities, the large investment bank holding companies managed their leverage and overall financial condition to achieve at least the "A" credit rating considered necessary for such activities.&lt;ref&gt;See the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of the [[Form 10-K]] Reports filed by the CSE Holding Companies referenced in notes 93 and 95 below.

==Goals and tests of net capital rule==

===Self liquidation principle===

The SEC has stated the net capital rule is intended to require "every broker-dealer to maintain at all times specified minimum levels of liquid assets, or net capital, sufficient to enable a firm that falls below its minimum requirement to liquidate in an orderly fashion."&lt;ref&gt;Markham/Hazen BD Law at page 4-5, fn. 2.  See also [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/busl47&amp;div=37&amp;id=&amp;page= Michael P. Jamroz, "The Net Capital Rule"], 47 Business Lawyer 863 (May 1992) ("Jamroz Net Capital"), at 867 ("Because the Commission designed the Net Capital Rule to provide a fund from which liquidation expenses may be paid, the Rule, unlike GAAP, assumes the firm will liquidate.")&lt;/ref&gt; The Basic Method tries to reach this goal by measuring such "liquid assets" of the broker-dealer against most of its unsecured indebtedness.  The "liquid assets" serve as the "cushion" to cover full repayment of that unsecured debt.  The Alternative Method instead measures the "liquid assets" against obligations owed by customers to the broker-dealer.  The "liquid assets" serve as the "cushion" for the broker-dealer's recovery of the full amounts owed to it by customers.

Although the Basic and Alternative Methods end with these different tests, both begin by requiring a broker-dealer to compute its "net capital."  To do so, the broker-dealer first computes its equity under [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]] ("GAAP") by marking to market securities and other assets and then reduces that computation by the amount of "illiquid assets" it holds.  The broker-dealer adds to this total the amount of any "qualifying subordinated debt" it owes.  This preliminary amount is the broker-dealer's "tentative net capital."  After so computing "tentative net capital" the broker-dealer adjust that amount by making further reductions in the value of its securities based on percentage reductions ("haircuts") in their market value.  The amount of the "haircut" applied to a security depends upon its perceived "risk characteristics."   A stock portfolio, for example, would have a haircut of 15%, while a 30-year U.S. treasury bond, because it is less risky, would have a 6% haircut.&lt;ref&gt;GAO Risk-Based Capital Report at 132 to 133.  Poser/Fanto BD Regulation at pages 12-4 to 12-12 ; Nelson S. Kibler and Steven L. Molinari, "The SEC's Recent Revisions to its Uniform Net Capital Rule and Customer Protection Rule", 10 Securities Regulation Law Journal 141 (1982) ("Kibler/Molinari Recent Revisions") at 143-144.  "Illiquid assets" include fixtures, unsecured receivables, and non-marketable securities.  "Haircuts" are applied to securities based on their perceived liquidity and price volatility.  The example of the different haircut percentages for stocks and long term treasury bonds under the Alternative Method is mentioned in the 2008 NY Sun Article.  While the "haircuts" were generally the same for the Basic and Alternative Methods, an important distinction was that the Alternative Method required a 3% haircut in the value of customer receivables rather than the 1% imposed by the Basic Method.  See GAO Risk-Based Capital Report at 148-153 for sample calculations, including (at 151) the 3% haircut for customer receivables.  The 2004 rule amendment created a different calculation of tentative net capital for broker-dealers subject to its exemption by permitting "balance sheet value" of "derivative instruments" and of securities without a "ready market" if the SEC had approved the use of mathematical models to determine deductions from net capital for those securities.  SEC Release 34-49830, 69 Federal Register at 34432 and 34462&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, a calculation of "net capital" greater than zero would mean the "liquid assets" owned by a broker-dealer could be sold to repay all its obligations, even those not then due, other than any qualifying subordinated debt that the net capital rule treated as equity.&lt;ref&gt;In practice, the "haircuts" proved inadequate to deal with sharp interest rate movements in the late 1970s.  By 1980 the SEC issued revisions to the "haircuts" to account for this experience.  SEC Release No. 34-17209, 45 Federal Register 69911, at 69912 (October 22, 1980) ("The data show that the month-end to month-end price movements in most debt securities in the months of January 1977, October 1979, January 1980 and February 1980 were greater than the existing haircuts for the securities.")  That SEC Release has been cited as an early use of [[value at risk]] methodology to assess market value volatility.  [http://129.3.20.41/eps/mhet/papers/0207/0207001.pdf Glyn A. Holton, “History of Value-at-Risk:  1922-1998”], Working Paper, July 25, 2002, at page 9 ("In 1980, extraordinary volatility in interest rates prompted the SEC to update the haircut percentages to reflect the increased risk.  This time, the SEC based percentages on a statistical analysis of historical security returns.  The goal was to establish haircuts sufficient to cover, with 95% confidence, the losses that might be incurred during the time it would take to liquidate a troubled securities firm--a period the SEC assumed to be 30 days.  Although it was presented in the archaic terminology of 'haircuts', the SEC's new system was a rudimentary VaR measure.")  VaR methodology was a key component of the Basel Standards used in the 2004 net capital rule change as described in Section 5.1 below.  Subordinated debt that meets SEC requirements to constitute equity is generally limited to 70% of the total equity under a "debt to equity" test.  Poser/Fanto BD Regulation at §12.02[A], page 12-11.  GAO Risk-Based Capital Report at page 136, fn. 18, and page 151.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, both the Basic and Alternative Method imposed a second step under which broker-dealers were required to compute a "cushion of liquid assets in excess of liabilities to cover potential market, credit, and other risks if they should be required to liquidate."  This cushion could also be used to pay continuing operating costs while the broker-dealer liquidated, an issue particularly important for small broker-dealers with small absolute dollar amounts of required net capital.&lt;ref&gt;GAO Risk-Based Capital Report at 131.  Molinari/Kibler Financial Responsibility at 22 ("it is critical for broker-dealers to have both working capital and a cushion to allow for certain market and credit risks.").  For the significance of the net capital "cushion" in paying continuing operating costs of a liquidating broker, see Jamroz Net Capital at 865-6 (in describing the staffing of a liquidation, it states "The salaries of these employees, as well as the costs associated with maintaining the premises and shipping and transferring the securities, are paid from the broker-dealer's remaining capital") and SEC Release No. 34-31511, 57 Federal Register 56973, at 56975 (December 2, 1992) ("During a self liquidation, the expenses of a firm continue while its revenues drop significantly, often to zero.")&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the required net capital amount is a "cushion" or "buffer" to cover a broker-dealer's continuing operating costs as it liquidates and any exceptional losses in selling assets already discounted in computing net capital, the required level of net capital is measured against a much more limited amount of liabilities or assets than described (or assumed) by the commentators in Section 1.1 above.  The "second step" in both the Basic Method and the Alternative Method makes this measurement.&lt;ref&gt;Jamroz Net Capital at 866 ("Although the Rule's minimum requirements serve as a benchmark against which a base amount of required capital can be determined, the clause defining net capital has the most impact in achieving the purpose of the Rule.")&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic Method as partial unsecured debt limit===
For this second step, the Basic Method adopted the traditional liability coverage test that had long been imposed by the [[New York Stock Exchange]] ("NYSE") and other "self regulatory" exchanges on their members and by the SEC on broker-dealers that were not members of such an exchange.&lt;ref&gt;See Markham/Hazen BD Law at page 4-16 for the Basic Method's "continuation" of the "aggregate indebtedness" test.  In its adopting release the SEC stated: "The rule, as adopted, continues the basic net capital concept under which the industry has operated for many years" SEC Release 34-11497, 40 Federal Register 29795, at 29796 (July 16, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; Using that approach, the SEC required that a broker-dealer subject to the Basic Method maintain "net capital" equal to at least 6-2/3% of its "aggregate indebtedness."  This is commonly referred to as a 15 to 1 leverage limit, because it meant "aggregate indebtedness" could not be more than 15 times the amount of "net capital."&lt;ref&gt;Markham/Hazen BD Law at page 4-16.  See Poser/Fanto BD Regulation at pages 12-12 to 12-17 for a detailed description of the Basic Method, including minimum dollar requirements up to $250,000 and the 8 to 1 "leverage limit" for the first year of a broker-dealer's operation.  For a more basic explanation see GAO Risk-Based Capital Report at 133 to 134.&lt;/ref&gt; "Aggregate indebtedness", however, excluded "adequately secured debt", subordinated debt and other specified liabilities, so that even the Basic Method did not limit to 15 to 1 a broker-dealer's overall leverage computed from a GAAP financial statement.&lt;ref&gt;Jamroz Net Capital at 866 ("Generally, because aggregate indebtedness includes most of the unsecured borrowings of the broker-dealer, the aggregate indebtedness test limits the firm's leverage.") .  Poser/Fanto BD Regulation at page 12-16.  To the extent a broker-dealer funds its ownership of securities through secured borrowings, such as repurchase agreements, this means the "capital charge" (beyond "haircuts") for such borrowings, and therefore the "leverage constraint" beyond "haircuts", is the "margin" (i.e., excess collateral) received by the lender.  For a description of the use of [[securities lending]] by a broker-dealer to finance securities and how this operates under the net capital rule, see [http://www.sipc.org/pdf/SIPC_dt.PDF SIPC/Deloitte and Touche, “Study of the Failure of MJK Clearing, the Securities Lending Business and the Related Ramifications on the Securities Investor Protection Corporation”], (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, broker-dealers are heavily financed through repurchase agreements and other forms of secured borrowing.  Their leverage computed from a GAAP balance sheet would, therefore, usually be higher (possibly much higher) than the ratio of their "aggregate indebtedness" to "net capital", which is the "leverage" ratio tested by the Basic Method.&lt;ref&gt;For the significance of secured debt through repurchase agreements, see [http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt0812e.pdf?noframes=1 Peter Hoerdahl and Michael King, “Developments in Repo Markets During the Financial Turmoil”], Bank for International Settlements ''Quarterly Review'' (December 2008) at 39 ("top US investment banks funded roughly half of their assets using repo markets").  Page 48 of the [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/806085/000110465907010272/a07-4192_110k.htm Lehman Brothers Holdings 2006 Form 10-K] contains the following typical description of investment bank funding of "liquid assets":  "Liquid assets (i.e., assets for which a reliable secured funding market exists across all market environments including government bonds, U.S. agency securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities and high quality equity securities) are primarily funded on a secured basis."  As an example of the difference between GAAP based leverage (which is the statistic addressed by the scholars cited in Section 1.1 above) and "leverage" under the Basic Method, see the FOCUS Reports filed by Seattle-Northwest Securities Corporation ("SNW"), a small broker-dealer that used the Basic Method for FOCUS Reports filed before 2009.  While broker-dealer net capital compliance reports (contained within a [https://www.sec.gov/about/forms/formx-17a-5_2f.pdf Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single Report (“FOCUS”) Form X-17A-5]) are not generally available on the internet, the Seattle-Northwest website contains an [http://www.seattlenorthwest.com/default.aspx?page=snw_financials SNW Financial Statements page] that has links to that broker-dealer's recent FOCUS Reports.  In its [http://www.seattlenorthwest.com/content/pdf/focus2ndqtr07.pdf June 30, 2007, FOCUS Report], SNW's GAAP liabilities were $275,609,044, as shown on page 8, line 26, of the Report.  Its GAAP equity was $10,576,988, as shown on page 8, line 30, of the Report.  This yields a GAAP leverage ratio (computed in the manner applied to CSE Holding Companies by the scholars referenced in Section 1.1 above) of 26 to 1.  The "leverage" ratio under the Basic Method, however, is less than 1 to 1 (0.59 to 1) as shown on page 20, line 20, because "Aggregate Indebtedness" is only $2,829,783, as shown above item 1230 on line 26 of page 8, and "Net Capital" is $4,769,005, as shown on page 19, line 10, of the Report.  Only slightly more than 1% of the GAAP liabilities of this broker-dealer qualified as "Aggregate Indebtedness" under the Basic Method.  Later FOCUS Reports for SNW available on the SNW Financial Statements webpage referenced above show a much smaller balance sheet with GAAP leverage of less than 10 to 1.  Those same reports, however, show "leverage" under the Basic Method of less than 1 to 1, as in the case of the June 30, 2007, report.  Seattle-Northwest's [http://www.seattlenorthwest.com/content/pdf/focus1stqtr07.pdf March 31, 2007, FOCUS Report] shows less than one-half of 1% of its GAAP liabilities constituted Aggregate Indebtedness ($1,327,727 of Aggregate Indebtedness out of $305,607,345 of GAAP liabilities).  The Report shows a GAAP leverage ratio of 27 to 1 ($305,607,345 of liabilities to $11,285,875 of equity) but a ratio of Aggregate Indebtedness ($1,327,727) to Net Capital ($6,663,364) of 1 to 5 (i.e., 0.199 to 1).  These FOCUS Reports demonstrate the great difference between GAAP leverage and the "leverage" tested under the Basic Method (even accounting for subordinated debt being treated as equity under the Basic Method).  Yet, all of the scholars cited in Section 1.1 above referenced post 2004 leverage computations based on GAAP liabilities as if that were the limit imposed by the Basic Method (which itself was not the method that applied to any CSE Broker, let alone the CSE Holding Companies discussed by those scholars).&lt;/ref&gt; This exclusion of secured debt from the "aggregate indebtedness" test is broader than, but similar to, the rating agency approach to excluding certain secured debt in computing net leverage described in Section 2.1 above.

===Alternative Method as customer receivable limit===
The Alternative Method was optional for broker-dealers that computed "aggregate debit items" owed by customers in accordance with the "customer reserve formula" established by the SEC's 1972 segregation rules for customer assets.  Under its second step, a broker-dealer using the Alternative Method was required to maintain "net capital" equal to at least 4% of "aggregate debit items" owed by customers to the broker-dealer.&lt;ref&gt;Molinari/Kibler Financial Responsibility at 16-18.  Markham/Hazen BD Law at pages 4-17 to 4-18.  Poser/Fanto BD Regulation at pages 12-17 to 12-20.  While not the traditional "leverage test" based on indebtedness, this "leverage test" based on assets is similar to a bank asset leverage test and had been used by the NYSE in the 1930s.  Markham/Hazen BD Law at page 4-7, fn. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach assumed receipts from amounts owed by customers would be used, along with the net capital cushion consisting of "liquid assets", to satisfy the broker-dealer's obligations to its customers, and to meet any administrative costs, in a liquidation of the broker-dealer's business.  The net capital in the form of "liquid assets" of the broker-dealer, however, was not required to be separately escrowed for the exclusive benefit of customers.&lt;ref&gt;Molinari/Kibler Financial Responsibility at 16-17 (describing assumption) and at 21 (describing the lack of escrow).  While the broker-dealer's required net capital was not escrowed for the benefit of customers over other creditors, customer assets were required to be segregated from the broker-dealer's assets and special reserve account (the SEC Rule 15c3-3(e)(1) "Special Reserve Bank Account for the Exclusive Benefit of Customers") was required to hold net cash balances owed by the broker-dealer to customers.  Markham/Hazen BD Law at page 4-18.  GAO Risk-Based Capital Report at 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alternative Method did not directly regulate the overall leverage of a broker-dealer.  As the SEC explained in adopting the net capital rule, the Alternative Method "indicates to other creditors with whom the broker or dealer may deal what portion of its liquid assets in excess of that required to protect customers is available to meet other commitments of the broker or dealer."&lt;ref&gt;SEC Release 34-11497, 40 Federal Register 29795, at 29798 (July 16, 1975).  See also Molinari/Kibler Financial Responsibility at 26 and GAO Risk-Based Capital Report at 134 to 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 the net capital required under the Alternative Method was reduced to 2% of customer indebtedness.  This meant customer receivables could not exceed 50 times the broker-dealers net capital.&lt;ref&gt;Molinari/Kibler Financial Responsibility at page 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Neither at 2% nor at 4% required net capital did the resulting implicit 25 to 1 or 50 to 1 leverage limit on assets apply to a broker-dealer's overall assets.  The 2% or 4% capital requirement was solely for customer assets (i.e., amounts owed by customers to the broker-dealer).&lt;ref&gt;GAO Risk-Based Capital Report at 135 ("The alternative method ties required net capital to customer-related assets (receivables) rather than all liabilities like the basic method.")  Molinari/Kibler Financial Responsibility at 26, fn. 154 ("while the alternative requires a broker-dealer to maintain specified levels of net capital in relation to aggregate debit items under the customer protection rules, it places no restriction on the liabilities a broker-dealer can incur.").  Because the Alternative Method measures the required level of net capital solely against customer assets, when [[Drexel Burnham Lambert|Drexel Burnham]]'s broker-dealer shed most of its customer business the unit's required net capital became very low, although its "proprietary" (or dealer) account held a large amount of securities.  To address this issue, the SEC restricted the ability of the owner to extract capital from a broker-dealer using the Alternative Method if the net capital would thereby be reduced to less than 25% of the "haircuts" on the securities held in the proprietary account of the broker-dealer.  Jamroz Net Capital at 895.  Of course, if a broker-dealer's liabilities outside its customer business exceeded the value of its assets in that business (after "haircuts") that would reduce the broker-dealer's overall "net capital" and indirectly limits its customer business (i.e., the amount of "aggregate debit items" it could support).  FOCUS Reports are described in note 38 above.  The [http://corp.bankofamerica.com/publicpdf/equities/NYSE_FOCUS_063007.pdf June 2007 FOCUS Report filed by Bank of America Securities LLC] provides an example of how net capital rule compliance under the Alternative Method is computed.  Bank of America Securities did not become a CSE Broker, so its computation of compliance is under the Alternative Method without the 2004 rule change affecting CSE Brokers.  As in the case of two Seattle-Northwest FOCUS Reports cited in note 38 above, this Report shows GAAP leverage higher than 15 to 1.  GAAP leverage would be 64 to 1 (i.e., $261,672,884,443/ $4,071,281,721=64.27 to 1).  Treating subordinated debt as equity (which would be the more appropriate comparison to holding company leverage cited in Section 1.1 above) leverage would still be over 20 to 1 (i.e. $253,364,884,440/$12,379,281,721=20.47 to 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early warning requirements===
The 2009 Sirri Speech noted that the "early warning requirements" under the net capital rule were the "effective limits" for the CSE Brokers.  Aside from the $5 billion tentative net capital reporting requirement established for CSE Brokers in the 2004 rule change, the SEC required before and after 2004 "early warning" notice to the SEC if a broker-dealer's net capital fell below a specified level higher than the required minimum that would trigger a broker-dealer liquidation.  Upon providing such notice, a broker-dealer would become subject to closer supervision and would be prohibited from making capital distributions.  Such distributions are also prohibited if they would trigger an early warning requirement.&lt;ref&gt;2009 Sirri Speech.  GAO Risk-Based Capital Report at 135-136 for how early warning requirements serve as the effective limits for broker-dealers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each broker-dealer was required to issue an "early warning" if its net capital dropped to less than 120% of the broker-dealer's absolute dollar minimum requirement.  For broker-dealers using the Basic Method an "early warning" was required if their "aggregate indebtedness" became more than 12 times the amount of their "net capital."  The 2009 Sirri Speech suggests this is the likely source for the widely stated proposition that broker-dealers were subject to a 12 to 1 leverage limit.  For broker-dealers using the Alternative Method, such as all the CSE Brokers, there was an "early warning" requirement if their "aggregate debit items" became more than 20 times the amount of their net capital (i.e., if net capital did not at least equal 5% of aggregate debit items).&lt;ref&gt;2009 Sirri Speech.  GAO Risk-Based Capital Report at 59-60 for a description of the early warning requirement under the Alternative Method and at 135-137 for a full description of the early warning requirements.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-1975 experience under net capital rule==
The uniform net capital rule was introduced in 1975 at a time of great change in the brokerage industry.  The contemporaneous elimination of fixed commissions is often cited as reducing broker profitability and leading to a greater emphasis on "proprietary trading" and other "principal transactions."&lt;ref&gt;Poser/Fanto BD Regulation at § 1.02, page 1-10 ("The Securities Act Amendments of 1975 forced the stock exchanges to abandon their traditional practice of fixing the commission rates that brokers charged customers.  The immediate effect of unfixing commissions was to introduce price competition into the brokerage business and to reduce drastically the level of commissions paid to brokerage firms by institutional investors.  Among other things, the unfixing of rates caused many firms to search for other sources of profits...it led broker-dealers to engage in more principal transactions, including proprietary trading, risk arbitrage, making 'bridge loans' ...engaging in principal transactions demanded more capital than did the industry's traditional brokerage business, and this development favored large, well capitalized firms.")  [http://www.sechistorical.org/museum/galleries/rev/rev02c.php SEC Historical Society, “In the Midst of Revolution:  The SEC 1973-1981, Ending Fixed Commission Rates.”] provides a general discussion of the change.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broker-dealer leverage increased after SEC enacted uniform net capital rule===
Following enactment of the SEC's uniform net capital rule in 1975 reported overall leverage at broker-dealers increased.  In a 1980 Release proposing changes in the "haircuts" used for net capital computations, the SEC noted aggregate broker-dealer leverage had increased from 7.44 and 7.45 to 1 debt to equity ratios in 1974 and 1975 to a ratio of 17.95 to 1 in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;In proposing in 1980 revisions to the Alternative Requirement, the SEC cited financial information for NYSE member firms showing the overall average leverage ratio of such broker-dealers computed as total liabilities to equity capital rose from 7.61 to 1 in 1972 to 17.95 to 1 in 1979.  The annual ratios were:  1972: 7.61 to 1; 1973: 7.18 to 1; 1974: 7.44 to 1; 1975: 7.45 to 1; 1976: 11.13 to 1; 1977: 12.74 to 1; 1978: 14.73 to 1; and 1979: 17.95 to 1.  SEC Release No. 34-17208 ("SEC Release 34-17208"), 45 Federal Register 69915, at 69916 (October 22, 1980).  Molinari/Kibler Financial Responsibility, at 26, fn. 157, cites a Lipper study that "industry leverage increased from 17 to 1 in September 1982 to 19 to 1 in September 1983."  These data indicate broker-dealer leverage (measured as GAAP total liabilities to equity) increased after the introduction of the uniform net capital rule, although it is unclear from this data whether broker-dealer leverage ratios were unusually low in the period from 1972 through 1975.  This is entirely possible given the background of the broker-dealer crisis of 1967-1970 that led to the uniform rule and the financial market conditions in the early 1970s.  Molinari/Kibler Financial Responsibility at 10 states that in 1970 overall leverage of all broker-dealers was 10-1, but that leverage was "much higher" at larger NYSE firms.  Since the 1980 Release shows a significant decrease in the amount of subordinated debt as a percentage of total liabilities of broker-dealers, qualifying subordinated debt serving as net capital did not replace equity to mitigate the increase in leverage.  The Release shows (45 Federal Register at 69916) aggregate subordinated debt of $909 million out of $17.46 billion in total liabilities in 1974 versus $1.04 billion out of $71 billion in 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[GAO]] found that by 1991 the average leverage ratio for thirteen large broker-dealers it studied was 27 to 1.  The average among nine was even higher.&lt;ref&gt;In 1992 the GAO stated "The use of leverage has increased in the securities industry as firms rely more on liabilities than equity capital to fund their activities.  A common measurement of leverage is the ratio of total liabilities to total equity.  According to SEC annual reports, this ratio increased for all registered broker-dealers from about 13 to 1 in 1980 to about 18 to 1 in 1990."  GAO Financial Activities Report at 40-41.  The report studied in particular thirteen firms and found (at 41) that as of the second quarter of 1991: "The average total liabilities to total equity ratio among these thirteen broker-dealers was 27 to 1."  Even the 27 to 1 leverage ratio is misleading, because the Report notes (also at 41) only nine of the thirteen firms studied had leverage higher than the overall average of "about 18 to 1."  This means the average leverage of those nine firms must have been significantly higher than 27 to 1, particularly if the average was an unweighted arithmetic average of the leverage ratios of the thirteen firms.  The thirteen firms studied included the ten largest broker-dealers.  [http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~usclrev/724.html Thomas W. Joo, “Who Watches the Watchers?  The Securities Investor Protection Act, Investor Confidence, and the Subsidization of Failure,”] 72 Southern California Law Review 1071 (1999) at 1092, fn. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Large broker-dealers use Alternative Method===
The same 1980 SEC Release noted a clear distinction in the application of the net capital rule.  Most broker-dealers used the Basic Method.  Large broker-dealers, which increasingly held the great majority of customer balances, used the Alternative Method.&lt;ref&gt;SEC  Release 34-17208 "Most broker-dealers utilize the basic method for complying with the net capital rule...all ten National Full Line firms elected the alternative capital approach" and while "only 44 of the 2,066 broker-dealers that conducted a public business as of December 31, 1979 and were not members of the NYSE used the alternative method" those "44 firms were, on average, substantially larger than the 2,022 firms using the basic method."  45 Federal Register at 69917.  These data are discussed in Markham/Hazen BD Law at page 4-19, which adds that by 1985 "approximately 90 percent of all customer funds in securities held by broker-dealers were covered by the alternate net capital method.  Still about two-thirds of all broker-dealers used the basic capital method; they were mostly small firms."  [https://books.google.com/books?id=0R0WudQp0bcC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=30%25+haircut+equities+basic+method+net+capital+rule&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dTT72_Yhwx&amp;sig=ljcHZhyBx95bwvhcyEZ1GSdrnRc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=NlNATerVJIH68AbJ6oH8Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false John O. Matthews, ''Struggle and survival on Wall Street: the economics of competition among securities firms''] (New York City: Oxford University Press, 1994) ("Struggle and Survival") at 58 ("As of December 31, 1982, about 320 broker-dealers, including nearly all of the 25 largest firms, used the ACM.")  GAO Risk-Based Capital Report at 134.  ("most commonly used by large broker-dealers because it can result in a lower net capital requirement than under the basic method").&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting this division, all of the large broker-dealers owned by investment bank holding companies that would become CSE Brokers after the 2004 rule change described below used the Alternative Method.&lt;ref&gt;As cited in Section 1.3 above, the SEC has stated Bear Stearns and the other CSE Brokers used the Alternative Method.  This is confirmed by the descriptions of "Regulatory Requirements" contained in the [[Form 10-K]] Reports filed by the CSE Holding Companies before and after the 2004 net capital rule change.  Links to the pre and post-2004 Form 10-K Reports for each of the five CSE Holding Companies supervised by the SEC are available at these links for [https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0000777001&amp;type=10-k&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=exclude&amp;count=40 Bear Stearns], [https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0000886982&amp;type=10-k&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=exclude&amp;count=40 Goldman Sachs], [https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0000806085&amp;type=10-k&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=exclude&amp;count=40 Lehman Brothers], [https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0000065100&amp;type=10-k&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=exclude&amp;count=40 Merrill Lynch], and [https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0000895421&amp;type=10-k&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=exclude&amp;count=40 Morgan Stanley]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two recognized obstacles to adopting the Alternative Method.  First, the $250,000 absolute minimum net capital requirement under the Alternative Method can be lower under the Basic Method if a broker-dealer limits its customer activities.  This keeps many small broker-dealers from adopting the Alternative Method.&lt;ref&gt;Markham/Hazen BD Law § 4:5, especially at page 4-62, with fn. 15 describing cases of broker-dealers receiving SEC permission to return to the Basic Method from the Alternative Method because the Basic Methods lower minimum dollar net capital requirement became their effective requirement.  Poser/Fanto BD Regulation at page 12-19 ("a broker-dealer that chooses to have its ratio requirement calculated under the alternative standard cannot take advantage of the lower minimum dollar requirement for an introducing firm or for a firm that does not hold customer's funds or securities.")&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, to adopt the Alternative Method a broker-dealer must compute the "aggregate debit balances" owed by customers under the "customer reserve formula" specified by SEC Rule 15c3-3.  Many small broker-dealers prefer to comply with one of the three exemptions from the Rule 15c3-3 requirements rather than create the operational capabilities to "fully compute" compliance with the customer reserve formula.  These exemptions impose strict limits on a broker-dealers ability to handle customer funds and securities.&lt;ref&gt;Markham/Hazen BD Law § 4:5 at page 4-60 ("The computation of aggregate debit items must be conducted on a weekly basis", but explaining in footnote 5 that "A broker-dealer using the alternative method must remain in compliance between computation periods" under the NYSE rules).  Poser/Fanto BD Regulation at page 12-17 (describing the formula minimum as "2 percent of the aggregate debit items computed in accord with" the Rule 15c3-3 reserve formula).  [http://www.deloitte.com/dtt/cda/doc/content/us_fsi_sec_reg_update_Mar2005.pdf Deloitte, "Broker-Dealer Customer Protection Compliance"], March, 2005 ("Deloitte Compliance Report") ("By changing to the fully computing methodology for customer protection, minimum net capital required would be computed as the greater of 2% of aggregate debit items as derived from the Customer Reserve Formula or $250,000 (the Alternative Method).  Not only would the broker-dealer no longer have to consider whether its liabilities need to be classified as Aggregate Indebtedness or not but for a firm with significant liabilities, the minimum net capital requirement may decrease dramatically.")&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither consideration applied to the CSE Brokers.  They held net capital in the billions, not hundreds of thousands, of dollars.  They conducted customer brokerage activities that required full computation of the customer reserve formula under Rule 15c3-3.  They used the Alternative Method and had done so for many years before the adoption of the CSE Program.  This reduced their net capital requirement.&lt;ref&gt;GAO Risk-Based Capital Report at 134 and (for the lower net capital requirement under the Alternative Method) Deloitte Compliance Report .  GAO Risk-Based Capital Report at 59 for net capital levels over $1 billion among the large broker-dealers.  2009 Sirri Speech at page 4 ("the CSE broker-dealers...had been using a different financial ratio since the late 1970s", where that different ratio is the Alternative Method).  SEC Release 34-17208, at 45 Federal Register 69917, stated all ten "National Full Line firms" used the Alternative Method at the end of 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

==2004 change to net capital rule==

In 2004 the SEC amended the net capital rule to permit broker-dealers with at least $5 billion in "tentative net capital" to apply for an "exemption" from the established method for computing "haircuts" and to compute their net capital by using historic data based mathematical models and scenario testing authorized for commercial banks by the "Basel Standards."&lt;ref&gt;For the use of the term "exemption" see OIG CSE Report at v ("A broker-dealer becomes a CSE by applying to the Commission for an exemption from computing capital using the Commission's standard net capital rule") and 2 (which explains "By obtaining an exemption from the standard net capital rule, the CSE firms' broker-dealers are permitted to compute net capital using an alternative method" that, in footnote 23, is described as "based on mathematical models and scenario testing.")  [https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-49830.pdf SEC Release 34-49830, 69 Federal Register 34428 (June 21, 2004)] ("SEC Release 34-49830") at 34428 ("a broker-dealer that maintains certain minimum levels of tentative net capital and net capital may apply to the Commission for a conditional exemption from the application of the standard net capital calculation" and "Under the alternative method, firms with strong internal risk management practice may utilize mathematical modeling methods already used to manage their own business risk, including value-at-risk ("VaR") models and scenario analysis, for regulatory purposes.")&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Barry Ritholtz]], this rule was known as the Bear Stearns exemption.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Ritholtz, ''Bailout Nation'' (Hoboken, N.J., John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 2009) ("Bailout Nation") at 144 ("At the time [i.e., 2004], it was (ironically) called 'the Bear Stearns rule.'")&lt;/ref&gt; This "exemption" from the traditional method for computing "haircuts" ultimately covered Bear Stearns, the four larger investment bank firms (i.e., Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs), and two commercial bank firms (i.e., Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase).&lt;ref&gt;See Section 5.2 below.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested [[Henry Paulson]], the then chief executive officer of [[Goldman Sachs]], "led" in "the lobbying charge" for the rule change permitting these "exemptions."&lt;ref&gt;2008 NY Times Article ("The five investment banks led the charge, including Goldman Sachs, which was headed by Henry M. Paulson Jr.  Two years later he left to become Treasury Secretary.").  Bailout Nation at 144 ("the five biggest investment banks—Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, and Morgan Stanley—got their wish.  Led by Goldman Sachs CEO Hank Paulson—the future Treasury Secretary/bailout king—the SEC acquiesced to grant them (and only them) a special exemption.")  [[Roger Lowenstein]], ''The End of Wall Street'' (Penguin 2010) at 62 ("the investment banks, led by Goldman and its then-CEO, Hank Paulson, pleaded for a new regime to govern capital requirements.")  The 2008 NY Times Article does not assert that Paulson played any role in leading "the charge", only that he was CEO of Goldman Sachs at the time of the 2004 rule change.  ''Bailout Nation'' does not cite any source for its statement Paulson "led."  The paragraph in which Lowenstein makes the statement about Paulson is referenced by a citation to Mr. Lowenstein's earlier book about the 1998 LTCM crisis, because the paragraph mentions LTCM.  That book does not deal with the 2004 rule change.  The SEC's website contains the comment letters received for SEC Release No. 34-48690, which proposed the 2004 rule change.  It contains the [https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/s72103/s72103-11.pdf comment letter filed for Goldman Sachs by David Viniar], then Chief Financial Officer, which lists Mark Holloway and Jay Ryan as the other Goldman contacts for the matter.  The same webpage containing [https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/s72103.shtml comments on SEC Release 34-48690] contains file memoranda from three different SEC staff members documenting meetings held by the SEC with industry members.  The highest level meeting is documented by the [https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/s72103/s72103-17.pdf March 10, 2004, Memorandum from Annette L. Nazareth, Director Division of Market Regulation], covering a January 15, 2004, meeting she, SEC Chairman Donaldson, and Patrick Von Bargen held with Philip Purcell, CEO of Morgan Stanley, and Stephen Crawford, the CFO.  A [https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/s72103/s72103-1.pdf December 19, 2003, Memorandum from Matthew J. Eichner, Assistant Director, Division of Market Regulation] covers a meeting that day attended by Mr. Eichner and several other Division staff members below the Director level and numerous Merrill Lynch personnel, not including its then CEO Stan O'Neil.  A [https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/s72103/s72103-2.pdf January 6, 2004, Memorandum from Bonnie Gauch] records a December 18, 2004, meeting among SEC staff and numerous industry firms including Goldman Sachs, which was represented by Mark Holloway and Steve Kessler.&lt;/ref&gt;

The SEC expected this change to significantly increase the amount of net capital computed by those broker-dealers.  This would permit the parent holding companies of the broker-dealers to redeploy the resulting "excess" net capital in other lines of business.  To lessen this effect, the SEC adopted a new $500 million minimum net capital (and $1 billion "tentative net capital") requirement for such brokers and, more important, required each to provide the SEC an "early warning" if its "tentative net capital" fell below $5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;GAO Consolidated Supervision Report at 25, particularly footnote 35.  SEC Release 34-49830, 69 Federal Register at 34431.&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, their minimum net capital requirement was only $250,000 with an early warning requirement of $300,000, although the relevant minimums for such large broker-dealers were the much larger amounts resulting from the requirement to maintain net capital of 2% of aggregate debit items with an early warning requirement at 5% of aggregate debit balances.&lt;ref&gt;Deloitte Compliance Report.  GAO Risk-Based Capital Report at 135-136&lt;/ref&gt;  The SEC also permitted CSE Brokers to calculate "tentative net capital" by including "assets for which there is no ready market" to the extent the SEC approved the CSE Broker's use of mathematical models to determine haircuts for those positions.&lt;ref&gt;SEC Release 34-49830, 69 Federal Register at 34432 and 34462.  As noted in Section 1.3 above, the SEC has stated such model based haircuts will no longer be permitted for some "less liquid" securities.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Issues addressed by rule change===
The 2004 change to the net capital rule responded to two issues.  First, the European Union ("EU") had adopted in 2002 a Financial Conglomerate Directive that would become effective on January 1, 2005, after being enacted into law by member states in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;GAO Consolidated Supervision Report at 15.  [http://www.freshfields.com/publications/pdfs/sectors/7336.pdf Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, “Financial Conglomerates: the new EU requirements”] (January 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; This Directive required supplemental supervision for unregulated financial (i.e., bank, insurance, or securities) holding companies that controlled regulated entities (such as a broker-dealer).  If the relevant holding company was not located in an EU country, an EU member country could exempt the non-EU holding company from the supplemental supervision if it determined the holding company's home country provided "equivalent" supervision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/np/leg/sem/2004/cdmfl/eng/gruson.pdf Michael Gruson, “Supervision of Financial Conglomerates in the European Union”] (June 23, 2004) ("Gruson")&lt;/ref&gt;

The second issue was whether and how to apply to broker-dealers capital standards based on those applicable internationally to competitors of US broker-dealers.  Those standards (the "Basel Standards") had been established by the [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]] and had been the subject of a "concept release" issued by the SEC in 1997 concerning their application to the net capital rule.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/rules/concept/34-39456.txt SEC Release No. 34-39456] (December 17, 1997)  For a general description of the SEC's lengthy involvement with the Basel Standards, see GAO Risk-Based Capital Report and [http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d0561.pdf GAO Report, “Financial Regulation: Industry Changes Prompt Need to Reconsider U.S. Regulatory Structure,” GAO-05-61], October 2004, at 102-103.  For broker-dealers the most significant, and most controversial, element of the Basel Standards is the [http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs24.htm “market risk” standard] promulgated in 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States there was no consolidated supervision for investment bank holding companies, only SEC supervision of their regulated broker-dealer subsidiaries and other regulated entities such as investment advisors.  The [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]], which had eliminated the vestiges of the [[Glass–Steagall Act]] separating commercial and investment banking, had established an optional system for investment bank firms to register with the SEC as "Supervised Investment Bank Holding Companies."&lt;ref&gt;See Section 2.1 above and Gruson at 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial bank holding companies had long been subject to consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve as "bank holding companies."&lt;ref&gt;GAO Consolidated Supervision Report at 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

To address the approaching European consolidated supervision deadline, the SEC issued two proposals in 2003, which were enacted in 2004 as final rules.  One (the "SIBHC Program") established rules under which a company that owned a broker-dealer, but not a bank, could register with the SEC as an investment bank holding company.  The second (the "CSE Program") established a new alternative net capital computation method for a qualifying broker-dealer (a "CSE Broker") if its holding company (a "CSE Holding Company") elected to become a "Consolidated Supervised Entity."&lt;ref&gt;See GAO Consolidated Supervision Report at 13-14 and Gruson at 32-35.  For the 2003 proposals, see [https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/34-48690.htm SEC Release 34-48690] (the "CSE proposal") and [https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/34-48694.htm SEC Release 34-48694] (the "SIBHC proposal").  For the final 2004 rules see SEC Release 34-49830 (the "CSE rule") and [https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-49831.htm SEC Release 34-49831] (the "SIBHC rule").  To qualify for the CSE Program a broker-dealer needed to show it had "tentative net capital" (i.e., GAAP shareholders' equity capital plus subordinated debt, minus "illiquid assets" such as fixtures, but not minus illiquid securities) of at least $5 billion.  The alternative net capital computation method is specified in [http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/34ActRls/rule15c3-1e.html Appendix E to SEC Rule 15c3-1 (17 CFR 240.15c3-1e)].  Because the SIBHC Program was only available to investment bank holding companies that did not own any type of bank, the CSE Holding Companies that were not bank holding companies were ineligible for this program because of their ownership of "specialty banks" such as industrial loan companies.  Lazard Ltd. was the only investment bank that became a "supervised investment bank holding company" under the SIBHC Program. [https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/2008/ts050708ers.htm Erik Sirri, “Testimony Concerning Turmoil in the Credit Markets: Examining the Regulation of Investment Banks by the Securities and Exchange Commission”], Testimony Before the Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance and Investment, United States Senate, May 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The SEC estimated it would cost each CSE Holding Company approximately $8 million per year to establish a European sub-holding company for its EU operations if "equivalent" consolidated supervision were not established in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;GAO Major Rule Report.  SEC Release 34-49830,  69 Federal Register at 34456.  Bank holding companies such as Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase were already subject to such consolidated supervision, so this was not an issue for them.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Delayed use of rule change by CSE Brokers===
Ultimately, five investment bank holding companies (The Bear Stearns Companies Inc., The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Inc. and Morgan Stanley) entered the CSE Program.  The SEC was thereby authorized to review the capital structure and risk management procedures of those holding companies.  The holding companies were not eligible to enter the SIBHC Program because each owned a bank, although not the type of bank that would cause the holding company to be supervised by the Federal Reserve as a bank holding company.  In addition two bank holding companies (Citigroup Inc. and JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co.) entered the CSE Program.&lt;ref&gt;GAO Consolidated Supervision Report at 12 and (for the bank ownership issue) at 13.  As noted on 12, the OTS did supervise Merrill Lynch on a consolidated basis.  [http://fcic.gov/hearings/pdfs/2010-0505-Sirri.pdf Erik R.

Their consolidated supervision continued to be conducted by the Federal Reserve.&lt;/ref&gt;

A broker-dealer subsidiary of Merrill Lynch was the first to begin computing its net capital using the new method, beginning January 1, 2005.  A Goldman Sachs broker-dealer subsidiary began using the new method after March 23, but before May 27, 2005.  Broker-dealer subsidiaries of Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and Morgan Stanley all began using the new method on December 1, 2005, the first day of the 2006 fiscal year for each of those CSE Holding Companies.&lt;ref&gt;The SEC orders authorizing individual firms to use the new method and their dates of issuance are in note 70 above.

The [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886982/000095012305008131/e10350e10vq.htm Goldman Sachs May 27, 2005, Form 10-Q Report] shows (at 33) its CSE Broker (Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. (GS&amp;Co.)) reporting its net capital compliance for the first time based on the alternative method, including the requirement to report to the SEC if its tentative net capital fell below $5 billion.  Its earlier [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886982/000095012305004104/e07342e10vq.htm February 25, 2005 Form 10-Q Report] had not included (at 32) a discussion of that requirement, which was only imposed by the 2004 rule change.  The [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/777001/000116923206000651/d66710_10-k.htm Bear Stearns 2005 Form 10-K Report] states (at 17) that "effective December 1, 2005", its CSE Broker (Bear Stearns &amp; Co., Inc.) would begin using the alternative method for computing market and credit risk.

The [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895421/000119312506028736/d10k.htm Morgan Stanley 2005 Form 10-K Report] states (at 11) that "effective December 1, 2005", its CSE Broker (Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. (MS&amp;Co.)) would begin using the new method to calculate net capital charges for market and credit risk.  Broker-dealers must be in compliance with the net capital rule every day (Makrham/Hazen BD Law § 4:5 at page 4-60) and must notify the SEC if they breach any of the SEC Rule 17a-11 "early warning" triggers.  Markham/Hazen BD Law § 4:39.  Before it began computing its net capital in accordance with the new method, each CSE Broker had a daily requirement to determine whether under the "standard" method of haircuts its net capital was at least 5% of aggregate customer debits, the "early warning" trigger for the Alternative Method.  Ibid at page 4-178.  Because of this on-going significance of net capital rule compliance, until the CSE Brokers began using the new method for computing compliance their operational activities would still be dictated by the old method.  This means any effect the rule change had on leverage levels at the CSE Holding Companies through releases of capital from CSE Brokers would not have begun until long after April 2004 and, in the case of Bear Stearns, Lehman, and Morgan Stanley, not until the beginning of their 2006 fiscal years.  By its terms the 2004 rule change became effective on August 20, 2004, 60 days after its publication in the Federal Register.  SEC Release 34-49830, 69 Federal Register at 34428.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible effects of use of rule change===
By permitting CSE Brokers to compute their net capital using Basel Standards, the SEC stated it had expected roughly a 40% reduction in the amount of "haircuts" imposed in computing a CSE Broker's "net capital" before giving effect to the $5 billion "tentative net capital" early warning requirement added in the final rule.&lt;ref&gt;SEC Release 34-49830 at 69 Federal Register 34455.  GAO Consolidated Supervision Report at 24 to 25, particularly fn. 35 and the text it supports.&lt;/ref&gt;  The SEC also noted, however, it was unclear whether this would lead to any reduction in actual capital levels at broker-dealers, because broker-dealers typically maintain net capital in excess of required levels.&lt;ref&gt;SEC Release 34-49830 at 69 Federal Register 34455.  For the excess capital levels of broker-dealers see also note 75 below.&lt;/ref&gt; In part this is because broker-dealers using the Alternative Method are required to report when net capital falls below 5% of "aggregate customer debit balances."  At that level, a broker-dealer is prohibited from distributing excess capital to its owner.&lt;ref&gt;GAO Risk-Based Capital Report at 59 to 60.  Molinari/Kibler Financial Responsibility at 17, fn. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; As a 1998 [[GAO]] Report noted, however, the excess net capital in large broker-dealers greatly exceeds even that "early warning" requirement and is best explained by the requirements imposed by counterparties in order to transact business with the broker-dealer.&lt;ref&gt;GAO Risk-Based Capital Report at 58 and 136 (market participants "told us that the largest broker-dealers typically hold $1 billion or more in excess of their required capital levels because, among other reasons, their counterparties require it for conducting business with them.").  That Report shows (at 59) required net capital levels at the five large broker-dealers studied ranging from $73 million to $433 million and actual net capital levels from  $1.047 billion to $2.249 billion.  The three firms with required net capital of $400-433 million all had actual net capital of at least $1.77 billion.  The two firms with less than that amount of net capital had required net capital levels of $125 million and $73 million with actual net capital of over $1 billion each.  The GAO Financial Activities Report found (at 53) that as of June 1991 the thirteen broker-dealers in its study (which, as cited in note 48 above, included the 10 largest) held net capital ranging from highs of 12 or more times the required minimum to lows of roughly 4-5 times.  More recent data from Form 10-K Reports for Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers show reported required and actual net capital levels at their CSE Broker subsidiaries (i.e., Bear Stearns &amp; Co. Inc. and Lehman Brother Inc) as follows: 2002:  Bear $50 million required/$1.46 billion actual, Lehman $128 million required/$1.485 billion actual;  2003:  Bear $40 million required/$2.04 billion actual, Lehman $180 million required/$2.033 billion actual;  2004:  Bear $80 million required/$1.8 billion actual, Lehman $200 million required/$2.4 billion actual;  2005:  Bear $90 million required/$1.27 billion actual, Lehman $300 million required/$2.1 billion actual;  2006:  Bear $550 million required/$4.03 billion actual, Lehman $500 million required/$4.7 billion actual;  2007:  Bear $550 million required/$3.6 billion actual, Lehman $ 600 million required/$ 2.7 billion actual.  The information is in the [https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0000777001&amp;type=10-k&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=exclude&amp;count=40 Bear Stearns Form 10-K reports] and [https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0000806085&amp;type=10-k&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=exclude&amp;count=40 Lehman Form 10-K Reports] for 2002 through 2007.  In each case the information is available by searching "Regulatory Requirements" or "net capital" in the Form 10-K Reports.  In the case of Bear, exhibit 13 to each 10-K (the Annual Report) contains the information.  For Lehman Exhibit 13 is only used for 2002 and 2003.  In later years the information is in the full 10-K file.&lt;/ref&gt; This had long been true for broker-dealers.  A 1987 paper published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that at year end 1986 sixteen diversified broker-dealers reported average net capital 7.3 times larger than required net capital ($408 million average reported level and $65 million average required level).  The same paper stated "Market pressures, rather than regulations, determine how much excess net capital securities firms need to compete."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/quarterly_review/1987v12/v12n3article1.pdf Gary Haberman, “Capital Requirements of Commercial and Investment Banks:  Contrasts in Regulation”], ''Federal Reserve Bank of New York—Quarterly Review'', Autumn/1987, at 6.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=0R0WudQp0bcC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;dq=net+capital+during+1987+market+crash+matthews+struggle+survival+wall+street&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dTT77U3ozw&amp;sig=j5j3JWsuxEMT-YYjT4bhELu49rk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JyhHTbS1LYKs8AaXvMXNAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Struggle and Survival at 63] charts excess net capital levels from 1976 to 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, to protect against significant reductions in CSE Broker net capital, the SEC imposed the additional "early warning" requirement that required a CSE Broker to notify the SEC if its "tentative net capital" dropped below $5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;GAO 2009 Financial Crisis Report at 38-39.  SEC Release 34-49830, 69 Federal Register at 34431, and other sources cited in notes 24 and 25 above.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the 2004 change to the Alternative Method raised the possibility increased net capital computations based on the same assets (and additional "less liquid" securities) would weaken customer protections in a CSE Broker liquidation.  It also raised the possibility capital would be withdrawn from CSE Brokers and used in the non-broker/dealer business of CSE Holding Companies.&lt;ref&gt;SEC Release 34-49830, 69 Federal Register at 34455 ("We estimated that a broker-dealer could reallocate capital to fund business activities for which the rate of return would be approximately 20 basis points (0.2%) higher").  The change could also lead to a decline in the quality of assets not shown on a GAAP financial statement.  See, however, notes 79 and 80 below on this issue.  See note 16 above for the importance of the $5 billion tentative net capital "early warning" trigger in preventing significant reductions in CSE Broker net capital.&lt;/ref&gt; It did not change the test against which net capital was measured.  That test had never directly limited overall leverage of either a broker-dealer or its parent holding company.

==The collapses of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers==

===Bear Stearns===
Bear Stearns was the first CSE Holding Company to collapse.  It was "saved" through an "arranged" merger with JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. ("JP Morgan") announced on March 17, 2008, in connection with which the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ("FRBNY") made a $29 billion loan to a [[special purpose entity]] (Maiden Lane LLC) that took ownership of various assets of Bear Stearns with a quoted market value of $30 billion as of March 14, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.policyarchive.org/handle/10207/bitstreams/20013_Previous_Version_2008-03-26.pdf CRS Report for Congress, “Bear Stearns: Crisis and ‘Rescue’ for a Major Provider of Mortgage-Related Products”], RL34420 (Updated March 26, 2008).  [http://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2008/gei080403.html Timothy F. Geithner, “Testimony before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs”] (April 3, 2008) (the "Geithner Testimony").  While many have assumed these were "toxic assets", the Geithner Testimony asserted the FRBNY selected the assets, that all securities included were investment grade rated, and that individual loans (i.e., "whole loans") included were all "performing."  The FRBNY maintains a [http://www.ny.frb.org/markets/maidenlane.html#maidenlane webpage describing the Maiden Lane LLC transaction] ("Maiden Lane Webpage").  The Maiden Lane Webpage describes the original Bear Stearns portfolio acquired by Maiden Lane LLC on June 26, 2008, after "due diligence" was conducted on the assets by advisors to the FRBNY.  According to the Maiden Lane Webpage, all of the assets had been held by the Bear Stearns Mortgage Desk and a bit more than one third of the fair value of the assets was from Agency MBS.  The Maiden Lane Webpage shows reporting of the fair value of the Maiden Lane LLC assets, which is determined quarterly and reported weekly on [http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/ Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.4.1.]("H.4.1").  According to the Quarterly Summary of Assets and Outstanding Loan Balance contained at the end of the Maiden Lane Webpage, (1) the initial principal amount of the NYFRB loan was $28.820 billion of principal and interest owed to the NYFRB and (2) as of September 30, 2010, the principal and accrued interest owed to the NYFRB was $28.206 billion and the fair value of the Maiden Lane assets was $29.021 billion.&lt;/ref&gt;

The broker-dealer operations of Bear Stearns were absorbed by JP Morgan.  The reported net capital position of the Bear Stearns CSE Broker (Bear Stearns &amp; Co. Inc) was adequate and, it appears, would have been adequate under the pre-2004 "haircuts" as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sec-oig.gov/Reports/AuditsInspections/2008/446-b.pdf SEC OIG, “SEC’s Oversight of Bear Stearns and Related Entities:  Broker Dealer Risk Assessment Program,” Report No. 446-B] (September 25, 2008).  At 10 this Report states the Bear Stearns liquidity crisis occurred at the holding company level.  Some or all of the securities funded by the FRBNY described in the Geithner Testimony may have been booked at the Bear Stearns CSE Broker as part of its proprietary trading book.  Because the Geithner Testimony indicates the securities included in the portfolio were all investment grade rated, it appears they would have been subject to "haircuts" of between 2% and 9% (depending upon maturity) as investment grade rated debt securities under the pre-2004 traditional haircuts (see 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F)(1) for eligible investment grade debt securities).  Some or all of the Agency MBS included in the portfolio may have been subject to the government agency haircuts under the traditional haircut rules in 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(A)(1), which range from 0% to 6%.  These securities haircuts can be found on pages 316-317 (for government and agency securities) and 318-320 (for investment grade rated debt securities) of [http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2009/aprqtr/pdf/17cfr240.15c3-1.pdf the 4-1-09 published version of Title 17, chapter II, of the Code of Federal Regulations].  As cited in note 75 above, the last public report of the required year-end net capital of Bear's CSE Broker was $550 million as of November 30, 2007.  [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/777001/000091412108000345/be12550652-10q.txt The Bear Stearns Form 10-Q Report for the period ending February 29, 2008], shows the same $550 million required net capital.  The SEC [https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-48.htm] estimated the CSE Broker's required net capital was $560 million as of March 14, 2008, and that the CSE Broker had excess net capital of more than $2 billion.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lehman Brothers===
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc entered bankruptcy on September 15, 2008.  Its CSE Broker (Lehman Brothers Inc ("LBI")) was not included in the bankruptcy filing and continued to operate until its customer accounts and other assets were acquired by Barclays Capital Inc.  As a condition to that acquisition the [[Securities Investor Protection Corporation]] ("SIPC") commenced a liquidation of LBI on September 19, 2008, in order to complete the transfer of LBI customer accounts and resolve disputes about the status of accounts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finra.org/Newsroom/NewsReleases/2008/P116998 [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] ("FINRA") News Release, "FINRA Advises Customers on How to Safeguard Their Brokerage Accounts,"], September 15, 2008 ("While Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws this morning, the firm's U.S. regulated broker-dealer, Lehman Brothers, Inc., is still solvent and functioning.

Although there has been controversy about two overnight loans to LBI guaranteed by the FRBNY, it appears those loans funded intraday or overnight exposures of LBI to its customers in connection with settlements of customer transactions and that the collateral supporting those loans (i.e., customer settlement payments) repaid the loans on the day they were made or the following day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/16/business/16sorkin.html Andrew Ross Sorkin, “How the Fed Reached Out to Lehman”], [[New York Times]], December 16, 2008, at page B1 ("Mr. Paulson said Lehman had lacked the collateral for the government to backstop a deal between Lehman and Barclays.

==Capital withdrawals from CSE Brokers and leverage at CSE Holding Companies==
While the CSE Brokers of Bear and Lehman may have remained solvent and liquid after the 2004 net capital rule change, it has been suggested the change had the effect of permitting a large expansion of the non-broker/dealer operations of Bear, Lehman, and the other CSE Holding Companies because they were able to extract excess net capital from their broker-dealers and use that capital to acquire dangerously large exposures to "risky assets."&lt;ref&gt;2008 NY Times Article ("The exemption would unshackle billions of dollars held in reserve as a cushion against losses on their investments. Those funds could then flow up to the parent company, enabling it to invest in the fast-growing but opaque world of mortgage-backed securities; [[credit derivative]]s, a form of insurance for bond holders; and other exotic instruments.").&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limited evidence of capital withdrawals from CSE Brokers===
There does not appear to be any publicly available study comparing capital levels at CSE Brokers before and after they began using the net capital computation method permitted by the 2004 rule change. As described in Section 1.2 above, the SEC has stated "tentative net capital" levels at the CSE Brokers remained stable, or in some cases increased, after the 2004 rule change.&lt;ref&gt;See the 2009 Sirri Speech and the GAO 2009 Financial Crisis Report at 118-119 for how tentative net capital is computed and the assertion tentative net capital at CSE Brokers was not dramatically decreased after the computation method permitted by the 2004 rule change was used by those CSE Brokers.  See Sections 1.3, 3.1, and 5.3 above for how tentative net capital is generally computed and how the 2004 rule change permitted "less liquid" assets to be valued.&lt;/ref&gt; CSE Brokers, however, could be permitted to include in net capital computations some "less liquid" securities that were excluded before the 2004 rule change.&lt;ref&gt;As noted in Section 5 above, this depended upon the SEC approving the CSE Broker's models for applying haircuts to those securities.&lt;/ref&gt;

The only CSE Holding Company that provided separate financial information for its CSE Broker, through consolidating financial statements, in its Form 10-K Report filings was Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc, because that CSE Broker (LBI) had sold subordinated debt in a public offering.  Those filings show LBI's reported shareholders' equity increased after it became a CSE Broker.&lt;ref&gt;As explained in Section 5.2 above, LBI became a CSE Broker effective December 1, 2005.  Lehman's last Form 10-K filed before it became a CSE Holding Company was for November 30, 2005.  That report showed LBI's shareholders' equity as $3.788 billion.  For the first two years in which Lehman was a CSE Holding Company the November 30 LBI reported shareholders' equity was $4 billion (2006) and $4.446 billion (2007).  For the three fiscal year-end periods before November 30, 2005, LBI's shareholders' equity was reported as $3.281 billion at year-end 2004, $3.306 billion at year-end 2003, and $3.152 billion at year-end 2002.  The Lehman Form 10-Ks for these years can be found at the link provided in note 75 above.  The LBI reported shareholders' equity can be found by searching "consolidating balance sheet" in the 10-Ks for the years from 2003 through 2007.  The 2003 10-K shows LBI's shareholders' equity for fiscal year-end 2003 and 2002.  For years before 2002, the LBI reported shareholders' equity can be found in [https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0000728586&amp;type=10-k&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=exclude&amp;count=40 LBI’s Form 10-Ks] filed for its subordinated debt.  Broker-dealers are required to file Form X-17A-5 FOCUS Report (i.e., Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single Report) forms with the SEC showing their computation of net capital and compliance with the net capital rule, as referenced in note 38 above.  These filings are only available in paper form from the SEC for the Bear, Merrill, and Morgan Stanley CSE Brokers.  [http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/34ActRls/rule17a-5.html 17 CFR 240.17a-5(e)(3)] provides that the financial information in Part II or Part IIA of such reports is publicly available.

Those statements show 2004 fiscal year-end GAAP total partners' capital of $4.211 billion, before Goldmans Sachs &amp; Co. became a CSE Broker, growing to $6.248 billion by fiscal year-end 2007.&lt;ref&gt;The fiscal year-end capital for 2005 was $4.536 billion and for 2006 was $4.686 billion.  [http://www2.goldmansachs.com/our-firm/investors/financials/archived/subsidiary-financial-info/index.html  Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. financial reports from 2004 through 2008].  These reports show large subordinated debt for Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. as does the Bank of America Securities LLC FOCUS Report referenced in note 43 above.  Qualifying subordinated debt is overall an important component of broker-dealer net capital.  Aside from showing increases in its equity capital after the 2004 rule change, Goldman Sachs &amp; Co also shows an increase in subordinated debt from $12 billion at year-end 2004 to $18.25 billion at year-end 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Merrill Lynch reported in its Form 10-K Report for 2005 that, in 2005, it made two withdrawals of capital from its CSE Broker in the total amount of $2.5 billion.  In the same Form 10-K Report Merrill Lynch stated that the 2004 rule change was intended to "reduce regulatory capital costs" and that its CSE Broker subsidiary expected to make further reductions in its excess net capital.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/65100/000095012306002318/x16704e10vk.htm Merrill Lynch 2005 Form 10-K Report] ("2005 Merrill 10-K").  On page 123 of this 2005 Merrill 10-K, Merrill Lynch stated "The Rule amendments are intended to reduce regulatory capital costs for broker-dealers by allowing very highly capitalized firms that have comprehensive internal controls and risk management practices in place to use their mathematical risk models to calculate certain regulatory capital deductions. As a result, beginning as of January 3, 2005, MLPF&amp;S computed certain net capital deductions under the SEC Rule amendments."  In the same 2005 Merrill 10-K, at page 124, Merrill stated its CSE Broker (i.e., MLPF&amp;S) "has reduced and expects to reduce further, subject to regulatory approval, its excess net capital so as to realize the benefits of the Rule amendments.  On March 31, 2005, MLPF&amp;S, with the approval of the SEC and The New York Stock Exchange, Inc. ("NYSE"), made a payment of $2.0 billion to its parent company, ML &amp; Co., consisting of a $1.2 billion dividend and a subordinated debt repayment of $800 million. In addition, on December 6, 2005, after receiving the required approvals, MLPF&amp;S paid a $500 million dividend to ML &amp; Co."&lt;/ref&gt; In that 2005 Form 10-K Report Merrill Lynch also reported that its consolidated year-end shareholders' equity for 2004 was $31.4 billion and for 2005 was $35.6 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Page 40 of 2005 Merrill 10-K.  The dividend payment and subordinated debt repayment would not affect the consolidated shareholders' equity of Merrill Lynch.&lt;/ref&gt;

The other three CSE Brokers that reported net capital levels (i.e., Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and Morgan Stanley)&lt;ref&gt;Goldman Sachs stated the net capital position of its CSE Broker in 2003 and 2004 Form 10-K and Form 10-Q Reports and reinstated that reporting beginning with its 2008 Form 10-K.  From the second fiscal quarter of 2005, when Goldman began reporting under the new methodology, through its 2008 Form 10-Q Reports, Goldman only reported that its CSE Broker's net capital and tentative net capital positions were in excess of required and "early warning" levels.  Examples of reporting of actual net capital levels and actual requirements can be found on page 97 in note 14 of [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886982/000095012304002239/y94357exv13w2.htm Goldman’s 2003 annual report], on page 133 in note 14 of [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886982/000095012305001271/e05053e10vk.htm Goldman’s 2004 Form 10-K Report], and on page 200 in note 17 of [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886982/000095012309001278/y74032e10vk.htm Goldman’s 2008 Form 10-K Report].

By searching "net capital" the Goldman reporting of net capital levels and requirements can be found.&lt;/ref&gt; all reported significant increases in net capital in their CSE Holding Companies' Form 10-Q Reports for the first reporting period for which they used the new computation method (i.e., the first fiscal quarter of 2006), which would be consistent with reduced haircuts under that method.  Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers reported subsequent decreases that could be consistent with capital withdrawals.  In earlier periods, however, broker-dealers that later became CSE Brokers also reported fluctuations in net capital levels with periods of significant decreases.  None of these three CSE Holding Companies, nor Merrill Lynch after 2005, reported capital withdrawals from CSE Brokers in their Form 10-Q or 10-K Reports.&lt;ref&gt;In it Form 10-Q Report for the first quarter of 2006 (when it first computed net capital using the new method) Bear Stearns reported $5.1 billion in net capital for its CSE Broker while reporting $1.27 at year-end 2005 in its 2005 Form 10-K Report and $2.23 billion in the preceding fiscal quarter in its Form 10-Q Report for August 31, 2005.  In its Form 10-Q Report for the second quarter of 2006, Lehman Brothers reported $5.6 billion in net capital for its CSE Broker after reporting $2.1 billion at year-end 2005 in its 2005 Form 10-K Report and $2.5 billion in its Form 10-Q Report for the fiscal quarter ending May 31, 2005.  For the first fiscal quarter of 2006 Lehman only reported net capital as being in excess of the required amount.  At the lowest reported later levels of net capital for those CSE Brokers, Bear Stearns reported net capital of $3.17 billion for the second fiscal quarter of 2007 and Lehman reported net capital of $2.7 billion for year-end 2007.  For Bear that represented a 38% reduction, and for Lehman more than a 50% reduction.  In its 1999 Form 10-K Report, Bear Stearns reported $2.30 billion in net capital for what later became its CSE Broker.  In its 2002 Form 10-K Bear reported $1.46 billion, a decline of $840 million or 36.5%.  From 1999 to 2000 there was a $760 million (33%) decline and from 2000 to 2001 a $520 million (34%) increase.  In its 2000 Form 10-K Report Lehman Brothers reported $1.984 billion in net capital for what later became its CSE Broker and in its 2002 Form 10-K it reported $1.485 billion, a decline of $499 million or more than 25%.

===CSE Holding Company leverage increased after 2004, but was higher in 1990s===
Studies of [[Form 10-K]] and [[Form 10-Q]] Report filings by CSE Holding Companies have shown their overall reported year-end leverage increased during the period from 2003 through 2007&lt;ref&gt;See "Leverage Ratios of Investment Banks Increased Significantly 2003-2007", Source data for the graph in [[Leverage (finance)]].  Leverage is there computed as debt to equity.  As shown there, the leverage ratios are for (A) Bear Stearns:  2003:  27.4 to 1; 2004:  27.5 to 1; 2005:  26.1 to 1; 2006:  27.9 to 1; and 2007:  32.5 to 1; (B) Goldman Sachs:  2003:  17.7 to 1; 2004:  20.2 to 1; 2005:  24.2 to 1; 2006:  22.4 to 1; and 2007:  25.2 to 1;  (C) Lehman Brothers:  2003:  22.7 to 1; 2004:  22.9 to 1; 2005:  23.4 to 1; 2006:  25.2 to 1; and 2007: 29.7 to 1; (D) Merrill Lynch:  2003:  15.6 to 1; 2004:  19.0 to 1; 2005:  18.1 to 1; 2006:  20.6 to 1; and 2007:  30.9 to 1; and (E) Morgan Stanley:  2003:  23.2 to 1; 2004:  25.5 to 1; 2005:  29.8 to 1; 2006:  30.7 to 1; and 2007:  32.4 to 1.  These ratios can be derived (and the underlying computations of assets, debt, and equity confirmed) from the "Selected Financial Data" section of the 2007 Form 10-K Reports for [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886982/000095012308000857/y46519e10vk.htm Goldman Sachs], [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/806085/000110465908005476/a08-3530_110k.htm Lehman Brothers], [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/65100/000095012308002050/y46644e10vk.htm Merrill Lynch], and [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895421/000119312508013719/d10k.htm Morgan Stanley].  The Bear Stearns "Financial Highlights" section of the [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/777001/000091412108000077/be11750956-ex13.txt Bear Stearns 2007 Form 10-K Report] contains a discrepancy (explained in footnote (1) to the Financial Highlights) in showing the effect of a 2006 accounting change that lowered its reported assets (through netting) in the three years 2003-2005 without reducing equity, so that the leverage ratios it shows are 2003: 27 to 1; 2004: 27 to 1; and 2005: 25.6 to 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and their overall reported fiscal quarter leverage increased from August 2006 through February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;OIG Bear Stearns CSE Report at page 120 of the full report.  Leverage is there computed as assets to equity, so is 1 numeral higher than debt to equity. (i.e., assets equal debt plus equity, so a 15 to 1 debt to equity ratio equals a 16 to 1 asset to equity ratio).&lt;/ref&gt; Form 10-K Report filings for the same firms reporting fiscal year-end balance sheet information for the period from 1993 through 2002 show reported fiscal year-end leverage ratios in one or more years before 2000 for 4 of the 5 firms higher than their reported year-end leverage for any year from 2004 through 2007.  Only Morgan Stanley had higher reported fiscal year-end leverage in 2007 than in any previous year since 1993.&lt;ref&gt;For Bear the "Selected Financial Data" in Exhibit 13 of  [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/777001/0000909518-97-000558.txt the 1997 10-K] shows leverage over the preceding 5 year period as:  1993:  31.3 to 1; 1994:  28.1 to 1; 1995:  28.8 to 1; 1996:  30.8 to 1; and 1997:  32.5 to 1, and of [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/777001/000091412103000238/be10k-nov02_ex13.txt the 2002 10-K] shows leverage as:  1998:  35.0 to 1; 1999:  30.1 to 1; 2000:  28.8 to 1; 2001:  32.0 to 1; and 2002:  28.0 to 1.

Goldman Sachs only became a corporation in 1999.  Financial information to 1995 is available in Goldman's 1999 Form 10-K.  Leverage before 1999 is computed as debt to partners' equity rather than shareholders' equity.  For Goldman the "Selected Financial Data" in Item 6 of [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886982/0000950123-00-001143-d1.html#007 the 1999 10-K] shows leverage as:  1995:  19.3 to 1; 1996:  27.5 to 1; and 1997:  28.1 to 1 and in Exhibit 13.4 of [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886982/000095012303002099/y83718exv13w4.htm the 2002 10-K] shows leverage as:  1998: 31.6 to 1; 1999:  23.5 to 1; 2000:  16.2 to 1; 2001:  16.1 to 1; and 2002:  17.7 to 1.  The leverage reported for 1998 and 1999 was higher in the 1999 10-K, but the debt and asset figures were adjusted in the 2002 10-K.  Leverage is here calculated as debt (i.e., total liabilities) to equity (i.e. shareholders' equity).  To find this leverage ratio, search for "Selected Financial Data" in each linked Form 10-K or exhibit to that Form.  Only Goldman reports total liabilities separately in its Selected Financial Data.  For the other CSE Holding Companies total liabilities have been computed as total assets minus    shareholders'equity.
As described in Section 2.1 (note 29) above, the Form 10-K Reports for all five CSE Holding Companies describe, in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section, their approaches to leverage and highlight an adjusted asset to tangible net worth ratio that a rating agency used.  As an example of a CSE Holding Company's approach to leverage beyond the discussions in note 29 above, see page 56 of the Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Inc Form 10-K Report for 2007 ("As leverage ratios are not risk sensitive, we do not rely on them to measure capital adequacy.  When we assess our capital adequacy, we consider more sophisticated measures that capture the risk profiles of the assets, the impact of hedging, off-balance sheet exposures, operational risk, regulatory capital requirements and other considerations.")  In its response to the OIG Bear Stearns CSE Report (at page 93 of the full Report) the SEC Division of Trading and Markets argued a GAAP balance sheet leverage ratio is "a crude measure, and implicitly assumes that every dollar of balance sheet involves the same risk, whether due to a treasury bond or an emerging market equity."  For an earlier discussion of the limitations of balance sheet leverage ratios and the importance of assessing "economic capital" see Sherman J. Maisel, ''Risk and Capital Adequacy in Commercial Banks'', (University of Chicago Press 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; The year-end debt to equity ratios of 38.2 to 1 for Lehman in 1993, 34.2 to 1 for Merrill in 1997, and of 35 to 1 for Bear and 31.6 to 1 for Goldman in 1998 were all reached before the 2004 rule change.  Even Morgan Stanley, which reported lower leverage after its 1997 merger with [[Dean Witter Reynolds]], reported before the merger a 1996 fiscal year-end debt to equity leverage of 29.1 to 1.&lt;ref&gt;Exhibit 13.2 to the [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789625/0000950123-97-001728.txt Morgan Stanley Group Inc 1996 Form 10-K Report] shows total assets of $196,446 million to stockholders' equity of $6,538 for an asset to equity leverage ratio of 30.1 to 1.  This yields a debt (i.e assets minus equity) to equity ratio of 29.1 to 1.  The same Exhibit 13.2 shows more than a doubling of assets in less than three years from $97,242 million on January 31, 1994, to $196,446 million on November 30, 1996, while stockholders' equity increased less than 50% from $4,555 million to $6,538 million in the same period.  This caused an increase in debt to equity leverage from 20.8 to 1 to the 29.1 to 1 ratio.&lt;/ref&gt;

The higher leverage reported by the four firms in the 1990s was not an anomaly of their reported year-end leverage ratios.  Form 10-Q Reports filed by three of those four CSE Holding Companies show an even more marked difference between fiscal quarter end debt to equity ratios reported in the 1990s and the ratios reported after 2004.

On page 25, Figure 3.10 graphs leverage ratios reported by investment banks quarterly in Form 10-Q Reports and annually in Form 10-K Reports, showing the same quarterly spikes as in the data in notes 97-99 above.  On pages 10-11 the authors identify the five CSE Holding Companies as the banks for which they examined data and the different time periods used for each bank, which explains differences from the data in notes 97-99 above.  It is also not clear whether Citigroup may have been included in the Figure 3.10 data, as noted on page 11 of the Staff Report.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact the investment banks that later became CSE Holding Companies had leverage levels well above 15 to 1 in the 1990s was noted before 2008.  The President's Working Group on Financial Markets pointed out in its April 1999 report on hedge funds and the collapse of [[Long-Term Capital Management]] (LTCM) that those five largest investment banks averaged 27 to 1 leverage at year-end 1998 after absorbing the LTCM portfolio.  At a more popular level, that finding was noted by [[Frank Partnoy]] in his 2004 book  ''Infectious greed:  how deceit and risk corrupted the financial markets.'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/reports/hedgfund.pdf “Hedge funds, Leverage, and the Lessons of Long-Term Capital Management”, Report of the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, April 1999] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831071357/http://treas.gov/press/releases/reports/hedgfund.pdf |date=2009-08-31 }}, at 29 ("At year-end 1998, the five largest commercial bank holding companies had an average leverage ratio of nearly 14-to-1, while the five largest investment banks' average ratio was 27-to-1.")  Frank Partnoy, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TiDeKjFFWHkC&amp;pg=PA262&amp;lpg=PA262&amp;dq=partnoy+infectious+greed+investment+banks+looked+just+like+LTCM+debt-to-equity+ratio+27-to-1&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LDDASwoolq&amp;sig=-PZsioWYpiF0V1TajQ5WIO-3emY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FeltSrwQgd2UB7b3_LUC&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1  ''Infectious greed:  how deceit and risk corrupted the financial markets'' (New York City: Henry Holt and Company, 2003 (First Owl books ed. 2004)) at 262] ("In many ways the top investment banks looked just like LTCM.  They had an average debt-to-equity ratio of 27-to-1—exactly the same as LTCM's").  Page 29 of the PWG Report cited by Professor Partnoy for this information presents a slightly higher 28-to-1 leverage ratio for LTCM at the end of 1997 and does not present a year-end 1998 leverage ratio (which would have been after the "rescue" of LTCM).  As Professor Partnoy noted, as he continued on page 262, the investment bank leverage ratio "did not include off-balance-sheet debt associated with derivatives—recall that swaps were not recorded as assets or liabilities—or additional borrowings that occurred within a quarter, before financial reports were due."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the GAO provided leverage statistics for the four largest investment banks in its LTCM report showing Goldman Sachs and Merrill both exceeding the LTCM leverage ratio (at 34-to-1 and 30-to-1, respectively), Lehman equaling LTCM's 28-to-1 leverage, and Morgan Stanley trailing at 22-to-1.&lt;ref&gt;GAO LTCM Report at 7.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 GAO report repeated those findings and charted leverage from 1998 to 2007 for four of the CSE Holding Company to show three of those firms had higher leverage at the end of fiscal year 1998 than "at fiscal year-end 2006 before the crisis began."&lt;ref&gt;GAO 2009 Financial Crisis Report at 40 to 41.  The report also states the leverage ratio for Bear Stearns is not provided "but its ratio also was above 28 to 1 in 1998."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Net capital rule in financial crisis explanations since 2008==

Since 2008, the conclusion that the 2004 rule change permitted dramatically increased leverage at CSE Holding Companies has become firmly embedded in the vast literature commenting on the financial crisis of 2007-2009 and in testimony before Congress.  In ''This Time is Different'' Professors Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff characterize the 2004 rule change as the SEC's decision  "to allow investment banks to triple their leverage ratios."&lt;ref&gt;Carmen M.
Reinhardt and Kenneth S. Rogoff, ''This Time is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly'' (Princeton University Press 2009) at 214.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Too Big to Save'' Robert Pozen writes "the fundamental problem" for the CSE Holding Companies "resulted primarily from the SEC's decision to permit them to more than double their leverage ratio, combined with the SEC's ineffective efforts to implement the consolidated supervision" of the CSE Holding Companies.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Pozen, ''Too Big to Save:  how to fix the U.S. financial system'' (Hoboken, N.J., John Wiley &amp;Sons, Inc., 2010) at 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Jane D'Arista testified to the House Financial Services Committee in October, 2009, that the 2004 rule change constituted a "relaxation of the leverage limit for investment banks from $12 to $30 per $1 of capital." &lt;ref&gt;[http://financialservices.house.gov/media/file/hearings/111/darista.pdf “Statement of Jane D’Arista, representing [[Americans for Financial Reform]], before the Committee on Financial Services Hearing on Systemic Regulation, Prudential Matters, Resolution Authority and Securitization, October 29, 2009"] at 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue entered military theory when Gautam Mukunda and Major General William J. Troy wrote, in the US Army War College Quarterly, that the 2004 rule change allowed investment banks "to increase their leverage to as high as 40 to 1" when previously "the SEC had limited investment banks to a leverage ratio of 12 to 1."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/09summer/mukunda%20and%20troy.pdf Gautam Mukunda and William J. Troy, “Caught in the Net:  Lessons from the Financial Crisis for a Networked Future”], ''Parameters'', US Army War College Quarterly, Volume XXXIX, Nr. 2 (Summer 2009) at 68 (in this narration, leverage is the analogue to specialization in military units and each represents a "bet" that one has correctly predicted the future, with the potential for increased rewards bringing the potential for disastrous losses).&lt;/ref&gt;

In reviewing similar statements made by former SEC chief economist Susan Woodward and, as cited in Section 1.1, Professors Alan Blinder, John Coffee, and Joseph Stiglitz, Professor [[Andrew Lo]] and Mark Mueller note 1999 and 2009 GAO reports documented investment bank leverage ratios had been higher before 2000 than after the 2004 rule change and that "these leverage numbers were in the public domain and easily available through company annual reports and quarterly SEC filings."  Lo and Mueller cite this as an example of how "sophisticated and informed individuals can be so easily misled on a relatively simple and empirically verifiable issue", which "underscores the need for careful deliberation and analysis, particularly during periods of extreme distress when the sense of urgency may cause us to draw inferences too quickly and inaccurately."  They describe how mental errors that contributed to the financial crisis and that now contribute to mistaken understandings of that crisis flow from "mental models of reality that are not complete or entirely accurate" but that lead us to accept, without critical review, information that "confirms our preconceptions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/alo/www/Papers/physics8.pdf Andrew W. Lo and Mark T. Mueller, “WARNING:  Physics Envy May Be Hazardous To Your Wealth”] (Working Paper draft dated March 19, 2010) ("Physics Envy") at 53-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lo and Mueller note the New York Times has not corrected the 2008 NY Times Article.&lt;ref&gt;Physics Envy at 57.&lt;/ref&gt; At least two of the scholars mentioned in Section 1.2 have (by implication) corrected their 2008 statements that before 2004 investment bank leverage was limited to 12 to 1.  In the July–August 2009 issue of the Harvard Business Review, Niall Ferguson noted information that from 1993 to 2002 Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, and Morgan Stanley reported average leverage ratios of 26 to 1 (with Bear Stearns having an average ratio of 32 to 1 during those years).&lt;ref&gt;Niall Ferguson, [http://www.exed.hbs.edu/assets/finance-descent.pdf “Descent of Finance”], Harvard Business Review, (July–August 2009) at 48 (page 3 of the linked version).  The stated 2006 leverage figure equals the average asset to equity leverage ratio (unweighted by assets size) of the 4 investment banks reported in their 2007 Form 10-K Reports for their 2007 fiscal year-ends, not for 2006.  The cited average leverage ratio from 1993 to 2002 equals the average (unweighted by asset size) of the annual asset to equity ratios for the four identified firms for that period (with the Goldman data starting in 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2010 book, ''Freefall'', Joseph Stiglitz noted that in 2002 leverage at the large investment banks was as high as 29 to 1.  He also directed readers to the 2009 Sirri Speech and the 2008 NY Sun Article for different views on the role of the 2004 rule change in investment bank difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph E. Stiglitz, ''Freefall:  America, free markets, and the sinking of the world economy'' (WW. Norton, New York, 2010) at 163 "By 2002, big investment banks had a leverage ratio as high as 29 to 1...by doing nothing [the SEC] was arguing for the virtues of self regulation... Then, in a controversial decision in April, 2004, it seems to have given them even more latitude, as some investment banks increased their leverage to 40 to 1."  In the note supporting this passage (note 33) Professor Stiglitz cites the 2008 ''New York Sun'' article and, "for the contrary position", the 2009 Sirri Speech.  Professor Stiglitz characterizes the argument as Lee Pickard and others putting "the 2004 change in the 1975 rule at the center of the failure" and the SEC arguing "the new rule 'strengthened oversight'", which latter position Professor Stiglitz finds "unpersuasive" "given the problems in so many of the investment banks."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Net capital rule in Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission report==

The ''Financial Inquiry Crisis Report'' ("FCIC Report") issued by the FCIC on January 27, 2011, presented the FCIC majority's view of the effect of the 2004 net capital rule change on leverage by stating:  "Leverage at the investment banks increased from 2004 to 2007, growth that some critics have blamed on the SEC's change in the net capital rules...In fact, leverage had been higher at the five investment banks in the late 1990s, then dropped before increasing over the life of the CSE program—a history that suggests that the program was not solely responsible for the changes."
&lt;ref&gt;[http://c0182732.cdn1.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/fcic_final_report_full.pdf “The Financial Inquiry Crisis Report,” Final Report of the National Commission on the Causes of the Financial and Economic Crisis in the United States, submitted by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission pursuant to Public Law 111-21] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130170912/http://c0182732.cdn1.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/fcic_final_report_full.pdf |date=2011-01-30 }}, January 2011 ("FCIC Report") at 153-154.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, while the FCIC Report identified leverage, especially leverage at investment banks, as an important feature of the financial crisis,&lt;ref&gt;FCIC Report at xix.&lt;/ref&gt; it did not identify the 2004 net capital rule change as creating or permitting that leverage.  The FCIC Report also noted the 18-month delay before all the CSE Holding Companies qualified for the CSE Program.&lt;ref&gt;FCIC Report at 152.&lt;/ref&gt; While the FCIC Report did not draw any conclusion from this delay beyond including it in a general critique of the SEC's execution of the CSE Program, as described in Section 5.2 above the delay eliminates the 2004 rule change from playing a role in any increase in CSE Holding Company leverage in 2004.  Because they all only entered the CSE Program at the beginning of their 2006 fiscal years, the delay eliminates the 2004 rule change from playing a role in any 2005 leverage increases reported by Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, or Morgan Stanley.

The FCIC Report was highly critical of the SEC's implementation of the CSE Program, rejected former SEC Chairman [[Christopher Cox]]'s assertion that the program was "fatally flawed" by being voluntary, and specifically concluded that the SEC failed to exercise the powers it had under the CSE Program to restrict the "risky activities" of CSE Holding Companies and to "require them to hold adequate capital and liquidity for their activities."&lt;ref&gt;FCIC Report at 152-155.&lt;/ref&gt; The SEC did not have those powers before 2004 and only gained them through the CSE Program.&lt;ref&gt;FCIC Report at 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

The persistent confusion about the application of the net capital rule to CSE Holding Companies, however, resurfaced in the FCIC Report.  After explaining the net capital rule applied to broker-dealers, not their parent holding companies, the FCIC Report misquoted the 2009 Sirri Speech as stating "investment bank net capital was stable, or in some cases increased, after the rule change."&lt;ref&gt;FCIC Report at 154.  The actual quote from the 2009 Sirri Speech referred to the "levels of capital in the broker-dealer subsidiaries."  He was not referring to net capital, and he was not referring to "investment banks" but to their broker-dealer subsidiaries.&lt;/ref&gt; As a more serious indication of continuing misunderstanding of the 2004 rule change, on the day the FCIC issued its report (January 27, 2011) economist [[Robert Hall (economist)|Robert Hall]] addressed an MIT symposium on economics and finance.  In describing the background to the financial crisis he stated:  "I think that the one most important failure of regulation is easy to identify.  In 2004 the SEC removed its capital requirements on investment banks... So the reason that Lehman was able to do what it did, which proved so destructive, was that it had no limits on the amount of leverage it could adopt."&lt;ref&gt;[http://amps-web.amps.ms.mit.edu/public/150th/jan27/150econFinance-part2.html “MIT 150 Symposia:  Economics and Finance: From Theory to Practice to Policy”] (Professor Hall's remarks begin 36:15 into the video.  The quoted statement begins 43: 44 into the video.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The word '''prothonotary''' is recorded in English since 1447, as "principal clerk of a court," from L.L. ''prothonotarius'' (c. 400), from Greek ''protonotarios'' "first scribe," originally the chief of the college of recorders of the court of the [[Byzantine Empire]], from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''{{lang|grc|πρῶτος}}'' ''protos'' "first" + [[Latin]] ''[[notarius]]'' ("notary"); the -h- appeared in Medieval Latin. The title was awarded to certain high-ranking [[Solicitor|notaries]].

== Byzantine usage ==
The office of '''''prōtonotarios''''' ({{lang-el|πρωτονοτάριος}}), also ''[[proedros]]'' or ''[[primikerios|primikērios]]'' of the ''notarioi'', existed in mid-Byzantine (7th through 10th centuries) administration as head of the colleges of the ''notarioi'' in various administrative departments. There were ''prōtonotarioi'' of the imperial ''notarioi'' (secretaries of the court), of the various ''sekreta'' or ''logothesia'' (government ministries), as well as for each ''[[Theme (Byzantine district)|thema]]'' or province.&lt;ref name="ODB"&gt;* {{cite book | editor-last=Kazhdan | editor-first=Alexander | editor-link=Alexander Kazhdan |year=1991 | title=[[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] | publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-504652-6 | page=1746 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter appeared in the early 9th century and functioned as the chief civil officials of the province, directly below the governing general (''[[strategos|stratēgos]]''). They were responsible chiefly for administrative and fiscal affairs (characteristically, they belonged to the financial ministry of the ''Sakellion''), and were also responsible for the provisioning of the thematic armies. The office vanished after the 11th and 12th centuries, along with the ''themata'' and the ''logothesia'', although there are traces of a single ''prōtonotarios'' functioning as the emperor's chief secretary until the [[Palaiologan period]].&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt;

==Catholic Church usage==
{{main|Protonotary apostolic}}

In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], '''protonotaries apostolic''' ([[Latin]] ''protonotarii apostolicii'') are [[prelate]]s in the [[Roman Curia]] who perform certain duties with regard to papal documents. Also, after examining the candidates, they name annually a fixed number of doctors of theology and [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]]. Historically, the college of protonotaries developed out of the seven regional notaries of Roman antiquity, and are therefore called protonotaries ''de numero'' (of the number).  They are also called "participating" protonotaries, because they shared in the revenues as officials of the Roman [[Apostolic Chancery|Chancery]].

These high papal officials are the highest class of [[Monsignor]], are often raised directly to the [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinalate]], and hold distinctive privileges in address and attire. Current practice is based on [[Pope Paul VI]]'s two [[motu proprio]]s, ''[[Pontificalis Domus]]'' of March 28, 1968 and ''Pontificalia Insignia'' of June 21, 1968.  They are addressed formally as "most reverend monsignor," and they wear the [[mantelletta]], the purple [[choir cassock]], the biretta with red tuft, and [[rochet]] for liturgical services, the black [[cassock]] with red piping and purple sash at other times, and may add the purple [[ferraiuolo]] to the black cassock for formal ceremonies of a non-liturgical nature, e.g., a graduation.

There are also honorary protonotaries, referred to as supernumerary (or 'beyond the number'), on whom the pope has conferred this title and its special privileges. This title is purely honorary and is not attached to any duties in the Curia. This is the type of protonotary found outside of Rome, and is the highest grade of monsignor found in most dioceses. Priests so honored are addressed as "reverend monsignor", wear the purple choir cassock (with surplice) for liturgical services, the black cassock with red piping and purple sash at other times, may add the purple ferraiuolo to this for formal non-liturgical ceremonies, and may put the letters "P.A." after their names, but use none of the other accoutrements mentioned above.

==Secular judiciary==
The term '''prothonotary''' is the title of the chief [[court clerk]] in several [[common law (legal system)|common law]] jurisdictions.

===Australia===
The chief clerks of the supreme courts of the [[Australia]]n states of [[Supreme Court of New South Wales|New South Wales]] and [[Supreme Court of Victoria|Victoria]] are titled "prothonotary".

The prothonotary of the Victorian Supreme Court has responsibility for all administrative tasks of the trial division registry. Under the Supreme Court Act 1986 (Vic), and the accompanying rules, the prothonotary also has some quasi-judicial powers including taxation of costs, conducting mediations, prosecuting contempt and administering bail.

Much of the work of the prothonotary is delegated to specifically appointed deputy prothonotaries who, under the Supreme Court Act (s108), have the same powers and authority as the prothonotary.

===Canada===

====Federal Court====
In the [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court]] in [[Canada]], the prothonotary is not a clerk, but instead is a judicial officer appointed under the [http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/F-7/index.html Federal Courts Act] and exercises many of the powers and functions of a Federal Court judge. The prothonotary's authority includes mediation, case management, practice motions (including those that may result in a final disposition of the case, regardless of the amount in issue), as well as trials of actions in which up to $50,000 is claimed (see Rules 50, 382, and 383 to 387 of the [http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/F-7/SOR-98-106/index.html Federal Courts Rules]). The current members of the court are found at [http://cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca/portal/page/portal/fc_cf_en/Bio Prothonotaries].

====Provincial courts====
In the provincial courts of [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Prince Edward Island]], the prothonotary is the chief court clerk. In [[Quebec]], prothonotary ({{lang-fr|protonotaire}}) is the term formerly used to identify the official now referred to as the clerk of the [[Superior Court of Quebec]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/francais/publications/generale/termes/greffier.htm|title=Termes juridiques - greffier|date=October 2, 2007|publisher=Ministère de la Justice du Québec|language=fr|accessdate=November 15, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303172233/http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/francais/publications/generale/termes/greffier.htm|archivedate=March 3, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Britain===
The chief clerk of the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|Court of King's Bench]] and the [[Court of Common Pleas  (England)|Court of Common Pleas]] was known as the Prothonotary. His deputy was the Second Prothonotary or Secondary. The positions were well paid and could be purchased. The posts, which had largely become sinecures, were abolished in 1837 and replaced by that of Master. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/SydLawRw/1959/5.pdf|title=THE OFFICE OF PROTHONOTARY |accessdate= 25 March 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt; The prothonotary and his deputy were the principal officers on the civil side of the palatine [[Court of Pleas of the County Palatine of Durham and Sadberge]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Frederick Archbold]].

=== India ===
The chief clerk and head of the administrative division of the [[Bombay High Court]] is known as the Prothonotary and Senior Master.

===United States===
While the term was once commonly used in the United States, only the courts of [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Delaware]] still term their chief clerks "prothonotaries."

====Pennsylvania====
The [[Judiciary of Pennsylvania|Unified Judicial System of Pennsylvania]] titles several of its court administrators prothonotaries. The [[Supreme Court of Pennsylvania]] maintains two deputy prothonotaries, one in [[Philadelphia]] and the other in [[Pittsburgh]], supplementing the role of the prothonotary in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]]. The [[Superior Court of Pennsylvania]]'s chief administrative officer is also titled a prothonotary and also maintains offices in Harrisburg, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Superior Court Prothonotary's Addresses|url=http://www.pacourts.us/courts/superior-court/prothonotarys-addresses|website=Unified Judicial System of Pennsylvania|publisher=Unified Judicial System of Pennsylvania|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pennsylvania courts of common pleas|Pennsylvania Courts of Common Pleas]] also title their chief clerks prothonotaries, except for the District of [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware County]], which has a clerk of courts instead of a prothonotary under the terms of its special Home Rule Charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Delaware County Office of Judicial Support|url=http://www.co.delaware.pa.us/ojs/|publisher=Delaware County, Pennsylvania|accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania]] and the minor courts (the magisterial district courts, the Philadelphia Municipal Court, and the Pittsburgh Municipal Courts) do not have prothonotaries; their administrators are titled a "Chief Clerk" and "administrators," respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commonwealth Court Chief Clerk's Address|url=http://www.pacourts.us/courts/commonwealth-court/chief-clerks-address|website=Unified Judicial System of Pennsylvania|publisher=Unified Judicial System of Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=District Court Administrators|url=http://www.pacourts.us/courts/courts-of-common-pleas/district-court-administrators|website=Unified Judicial System of Pennsylvania|publisher=Unified Judicial System of Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] was introduced to a prothonotary during a campaign stop in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] in 1948. It is rumored that Truman's first reaction upon hearing the term "prothonotary" was to say "What the hell is a prothonotary?"&lt;ref&gt;The story about [[Harry S Truman]] is repeated in:

A '''Red Mass''' is a [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] celebrated annually in the [[Catholic Church]] for all members of the legal profession, regardless of religious affiliation: [[judge]]s, [[lawyer]]s, [[law school]] [[professor]]s, [[law student]]s, and [[government official]]s, marking the opening of the judicial year. Through prayerful petition and thanksgiving the Red Mass requests guidance from the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]] for all who seek [[justice]], and offers the legal community an opportunity to reflect on what Catholics believe is the [[God in Christianity|God]]-given power and responsibility of all in the [[legal profession]].

Originating in Europe during the [[High Middle Ages]], the Red Mass is so-called from the red [[vestments]] traditionally worn in symbolism of the tongues of fire (the Holy Spirit) that descended on the [[Apostles]] at [[Pentecost]] ({{bibleverse||Acts|2:1-4|63}}). Its name also exemplifies the scarlet robes worn by royal judges that attended the Mass centuries ago.&lt;ref name="jcs"&gt;[http://www.johncarrollsociety.org/jcs-membership/the-red-mass/index.aspx "The Red Mass", The John Carroll Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407060333/http://www.johncarrollsociety.org/jcs-membership/the-red-mass/index.aspx |date=2013-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries with a [[Protestant]] tradition, such as [[England and Wales]] and [[Australia]], a similar church services is held to mark the start of the [[legal year]], with judges customarily wearing their ceremonial regalia.

==History==
The first recorded Red Mass was celebrated in the Cathedral of [[Paris]] in 1245. In certain localities of France, the Red Mass was celebrated in honor of [[Ivo of Kermartin|Saint Ives]], the Patron Saint of Lawyers.&lt;ref name=tbclg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbclg.org/history.html|title="The Origin and History of the Red Mass", Tampa Bay Catholic Lawyers Guild|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there, it spread to most [[Europe]]an countries. The tradition began in [[England]] around 1310, during the reign of [[Edward II of England|Edward II]]. It was attended at the opening of each term of Court by all members of the Bench and Bar. Today the Red Mass is celebrated annually at [[Westminster Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=jcs/&gt;

In the United States, the first Red Mass was held in 1877 at [[Saints Peter and Paul Church, Detroit, Michigan|Saints Peter and Paul Church]] Detroit, Michigan by Detroit College, as the [[University of Detroit Mercy]] was known at the time.  UDM School of Law resumed the tradition beginning in 1912 and continues to hold it annually.  In New York City, a Red Mass was first held in 1928 at the [[St. Andrew's Church (New York City)|Church of St. Andrew]], near the courthouses of [[Foley Square]], celebrated by Cardinal [[Patrick Joseph Hayes]], who strongly advocated and buttressed the legal community's part in evangelization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://redmass.com/redmass.html History of the Red Mass] Thomas More Society of South Florida&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianethicstoday.com/Issue/039/The%20Red%20Mass%20By%20John%20M.%20Swomley_039_26_.htm John M. Swomley, Professor Emeritus of Social Ethics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015023635/http://www.christianethicstoday.com/Issue/039/The%20Red%20Mass%20By%20John%20M.%20Swomley_039_26_.htm |date=October 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Canada]], the Red Mass was first celebrated in [[Québec City]] in 1896, in [[Toronto]] in 1924 and in [[Montréal]] in 1944.  Its sponsorship was assumed by the Guild of Our Lady of Good Counsel in 1931 and by The Thomas More Lawyers' Guild of Toronto since 1968.  It was re-instituted in [[Sydney, Australia]] in 1931.

==Red Mass today==
The main difference between the Red Mass and a traditional Mass is that the focus of prayer and blessings concentrate on the leadership roles of those present. The gifts of the Holy Spirit: wisdom, understanding, counsel and fortitude, are customarily invoked upon those in attendance.&lt;ref name=clgb/&gt;

===Ireland===
In [[Ireland]], the Votive Mass of the Holy Spirit (the Red Mass) is held annually on the first Monday of October, which is the first day of the [[Michaelmas]] Law Term. The ceremony is held at St. Michan's Roman Catholic church, which is the parish church of the [[Four Courts]]. It is attended by the Irish judiciary, barristers and solicitors, as well as representatives of the diplomatic corps, [[Gardaí]], the [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]], [[England|English]] and [[Scotland|Scottish]] judiciary. The judiciary do not wear their judicial robes, although formal morning dress is worn. Journalist [[Dearbhail McDonald]] has described it as "a grave, necessary reminder of the awesome powers and responsibilities of all those who dispense justice, including judges, lawyers, government and [[gardaí]]." A parallel ceremony is held at [[St. Michan's Church, Dublin|St. Michan's Church of Ireland (Anglican Protestant)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/comment/prayer-for-reformed-judicial-appointment-process-has-fallen-on-deaf-political-ears-30643908.html |first=Dearbhail |last=McDonald |date=October 7, 2014 |title=Prayer for reformed judicial appointment process has fallen on deaf political ears |publisher=[[Irish Independent]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===
In the [[Philippines]], [[De La Salle University]], [[Xavier University – Ateneo de Cagayan]], and [[List of Jesuit educational institutions in the Philippines|other Jesuit schools]], and [[Holy Angel University]] annually celebrate the Red Mass, which they call "Mass of the Holy Spirit." The [[University of Santo Tomas]],  the [[Colegio de San Juan de Letran]] (Dominicans), and the [[San Beda University]] (Benedictines)  also celebrate the Red Mass, known as ''Misa de Apertura'', that is followed by the ''Discurso de Apertura'' to formally open the academic year.

===Scotland===
In [[Scotland]], a Red Mass is held annually each autumn in [[St. Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh (Roman Catholic)|St. Mary's Cathedral]] in [[Edinburgh]] to mark the beginning of the Scottish Judicial year. It is attended by Catholic judges of the [[High Court of Justiciary]], sheriffs, advocates, solicitors and law students all dressed in their robes of office. The robes of the [[Senator of the College of Justice|Lords Commissioner of Justiciary]] are red faced with white.

One of the better-known Red Masses is the one celebrated each fall at the [[Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] on the Sunday before the first Monday in October (the Supreme Court convenes on the first Monday in October). It is sponsored by the [[John Carroll Society]] and attended by some [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States|justices]], members of [[United States Congress|Congress]], the diplomatic corps, the [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]] and other government departments and sometimes the [[President of the United States]]. Each year, at the Brunch following the Red Mass, the Society confers its Pro Bono Legal Service Awards to thank lawyers and law firms that have provided outstanding service.&lt;ref name=jcs/&gt;

Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], who is [[Judaism|Jewish]], used to attend the Red Mass with her Christian colleagues but no longer does so due to her objection to the use of images of aborted fetuses during a homily opposing abortion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1934924,00.html 'A Tale of Two Priests' (print edition); 'Priests Spar Over What It Means to Be Catholic' (online)], November 16, 2009, ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', p. 36. Accessed December 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Red Mass in the United States was celebrated at [[Saints Peter and Paul Church (Detroit)]] in 1877, under the auspices of what is now the [[University of Detroit Mercy]]. The tradition was resumed in 1912, and has been held annually since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalnews.com/detroit/1367769|title=UDM Law holds Centennial Red Mass &gt; Detroit Legal News|website=www.legalnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Red Mass is the oldest continuously held in the United States.

It continued as an annual event there under the auspices of the law school of the Catholic University of America. It was held in January to coincide with the opening of Congress. In 1953 it was moved to St. Matthew's Cathedral, but continued to be help at the beginning of the year until 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chasingchurches.com/2018/09/29/red-mass-in-washington/|title=Red Mass in Washington|last=Bains|first=David|date=September 29, 2018|website=Chasing Churches|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Controversy over the constitutionality of the Red Mass and attendance by American officials has been dramatized in such shows as ''[[The West Wing]]'' ("[[The West Wing (season 4)#ep69|The Red Mass]]") and ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' (by [[John Munch]], a character known for his obsession with [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]], in "[[Law &amp; Order (season 9)#ep195|Sideshow]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Sideshow|episodelink=Law &amp; Order (season 9)#ep195|series=Law &amp; Order|serieslink=Law &amp; Order|network=|date=February 17, 1999|season=9|number=14|minutes=24:38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ryot''' (alternatives:  '''raiyat''', '''rait''' or '''ravat''') was a general economic term used throughout India for peasant cultivators but with variations in different provinces. While [[zamindar]]s were landlords, raiyats were tenants and cultivators, and served as hired labour.&lt;ref name="Ram1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ram|first=Bindeshwar|title=Land and society in India: agrarian relations in colonial North Bihar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2b_j0mNe2FwC&amp;pg=PA76|accessdate=22 January 2011|year=1997|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn=978-81-250-0643-5|pages=76–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A raiyat was defined as someone who has acquired a right to hold land for the purpose of cultivating it, whether alone or by members of his family, hired servants, or partners.  It also referred to succession rights.&lt;ref name="Cranenburgh1894"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cranenburgh|first=D. E.|title=Unrepealed Acts of the Governor-General in Council, [India].|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1FESAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA221|accessdate=22 January 2011|year=1894|pages=221–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Ryot originates from the [[Standard Hindi|Hindi]] word ''ra`īyat'' and the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''ra`īyah'', translated as "flock" or "peasants", in turn originating from the word ''ra`ā'', meaning "pasture".&lt;ref name="thefreedictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/ryot|title=Ryot|publisher=[[TheFreeDictionary.com]]|accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classifications==
Under the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] system of land control there were two types of raiyats: khudkasta and paikasta.  The khudkasta raiyats were permanent resident cultivators of the village. Their rights in land were heritable according to [[Muslim]] and [[Hindu]] laws of succession.  The other type of raiyats was called paikasta. They did not cultivate land on a permanent basis in any particular mauza (lowest revenue plus village settlement unit), but instead moved from mauza to mauza and engaged themselves for a crop season.  In terms of revenue, the paikasta raiyats were generally paid a much lower rate of rent than the khudkashta raiyats. The dividend to the khudkasta, who thus became an [[absentee landlord|absentee owner]], came from hard bargaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Islam |first=Sirajul |year=2012 |chapter=Raiyat |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Raiyat |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pahikasht raiyats were a subgroup of peasants who cultivated the land away from the area where they resided.&lt;ref&gt;Ram, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Another subgroup included under-raiyats who was entitled to various rights of occupancy and transferable interests. An under-raiyat it was referred to as a ''korfa'', though an under-raiyat paying rent in kind was referred too as a ''bargait''.&lt;ref name="LandRecords1896"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bengal (India).

In March 1859, during the British rule, thousands of ryots in Bengal refused to grow Indigo.

The [[Bengal Tenancy Act of 1885]] was developed to regulate the rent of under-raiyats.&lt;ref name="Jha2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jha|first=Usha|title=Land, labour, and power: agrarian crisis and the state in Bihar (1937–52)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lHAMkZGI_OoC&amp;pg=PA152|accessdate=22 January 2011|year=2003|publisher=Aakar Books|isbn=978-81-87879-07-7|pages=151–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the causes of the Bengal Tenancy Act of 1885 was the Bihar Rent Committee report of 1879 which sought rights for the raiyat to resist illegal restraint and illegal enhancement, and allowing him to prove and maintain his occupancy rights.&lt;ref name="Buckland1901"&gt;{{cite book|last=Buckland|first=C.

==Ryotwari system==
{{main|Ryotwari}}
There were two economic systems prevalent in India during the British rule: the [[ryotwari]] system and the [[mahalwari]] system. The ryotwari system was known as "severality villages and was based on the system of peasant proprietorship.&lt;ref name="Madan1990"&gt;{{cite book|last=Madan|first=G. R.|title=India's developing villages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FQbujJdepwkC&amp;pg=PA15|accessdate=23 January 2011|year=1990|publisher=Allied Publishers|isbn=978-81-7023-281-0|pages=15–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ryotwari (or ryotwary) tenure related to land revenue imposed on an individual or community owning an estate, and occupying a position analogous to that of a landlord.  The assessment is known as zamindari.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Ryot |volume=23 |page=952 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The land revenue is imposed on individuals who are the actual occupants, and this assessment is known as ryotwari. Under zamindari tenure, the land is held as independent property; while under ryotwari tenure it is held of the crown in a right of occupancy, which is under British rule both heritable and transferable by the ryots. The former system prevails in northern and central India, and the latter in Bombay, Madras, Assam and Burma.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The Ryot's association was formed by N. G. Ranga.

{{Politics of Serbia}}
A referendum on a proposed draft of the new [[Constitution of Serbia|Serbian constitution]] was held on October 28 and 29 October 2006 and resulted in the draft constitution being approved by the Serbian electorate.&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6097344.stm |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=30 October 2006 |accessdate=2006-10-30 |title=Serbia backs draft constitution}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution is Serbia's first as an independent state since the [[Kingdom of Serbia]]'s 1903 constitution. Over 6.6 million people were entitled to vote in the national referendum.

==Background==
The previous Constitution of Serbia was adopted in 1990, when [[Slobodan Milošević]] was [[President of Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.arhiva.srbija.gov.rs/cms/view.php?id=1011 |title=Constitution |publisher=Serbian Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was [[5th October Overthrow|ousted]] on October 5, 2000, one of pre-election promises of the new [[Democratic Opposition of Serbia]] coalition government was to adopt a new constitution. That did not occur, however, as the coalition soon fell apart following disputes between the [[President of Yugoslavia]], [[Vojislav Koštunica]], and the [[Prime Minister of Serbia]], [[Zoran Đinđić]], which ended with Koštunica's [[Democratic Party of Serbia]] leaving the [[government of Serbia]], dominated by Đinđić's [[Democratic Party (Serbia)|Democratic Party]].

The 1990 constitution contained several [[anachronism]]s, such as a provision for "social property", which was neither privately nor state owned. Also, it significantly reduced the level of [[autonomy]] of Serbia's two provinces ([[Vojvodina]] and [[Kosovo]]), which had been introduced in the [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]]ist constitution of 1974. It required a two-thirds majority in [[Parliament of Serbia|parliament]] and a [[qualified majority]] of 50% of the electorate to be changed. Koštunica advocated that the change of constitution be in accordance with the constitution of 1990, while many other parties suggested the provisions for constitutional change be ignored, advocating elections for a Constitutional parliament.

Following [[Assassination of Zoran Đinđić|Đinđić's assassination]] in March 2003, [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2003|general election]] was held in December 2003, which resulted in Koštunica becoming Prime Minister. At the same time, the [[Serbian Radical Party]] experienced a revival and became the single largest party in parliament, but it was excluded from government. The adoption of a new constitution was again delayed due to various compromises and a reluctance to tackle the problem.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The issue was revisited in 2005, when the teams selected by [[President of Serbia|President]] [[Boris Tadić]] and the [[government of Serbia|Government]] presented their drafts of the constitution to the public. In June 2006 Serbia became an independent state when [[Montenegro]] decided to put an end to the [[Serbia and Montenegro|State Union of Serbia and Montenegro]] at a [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|referendum]], making a new constitution urgent. The [[Constitutional status of Kosovo|Kosovo status talks]] also necessitated the quick adoption of a new constitution which would affirm Serbian desires to keep the province under its sovereignty, in accordance with international law and [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|Resolution #1244]].

On October 1, 2006, followed by short negotiations among the largest parliamentary parties, the Parliament of Serbia unanimously adopted the draft of the new Constitution, with 242 MPs voting in favour. The other eight were not present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2006&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=01&amp;nav_id=37065&amp;fs=1|publisher=[[B92]]|date=1 October 2006|title=Parliament adopts Constitution proposal|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929111612/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2006&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=01&amp;nav_id=37065&amp;fs=1|archivedate=29 September 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The draft was the result of a compromise among the key political parties. Some considered the way in which it had been drawn up to be reasonably untransparent, and the result of political horse-trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://reliefweb.int/report/serbia/serbs-race-adopt-new-constitution|title=Serbs race to adopt new constitution|last=|first=|date=October 2006|website=reliefweb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://extwprlegs1.fao.org/docs/pdf/srb129685.pdf|title=Serbia's Constitution of 2006|last=constituteproject.org|first=|date=October 2013|website=Legal Office FAOLEX|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[preamble]], a statement that "Kosovo is an autonomous province of Serbia with significant autonomy" was included. It was decided that the constitutional referendum was to be held on October 28 and October 29.

All major political parties supported the draft and began a public [[Political campaign|campaign]] for the referendum. The only  political bloc that campaigned against the draft and advocated public [[boycott]] was a group of [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[social-democrat]] parties ([[Čedomir Jovanović]]'s [[Liberal Democratic Party (Serbia 2005)|Liberal Democratic Party]], [[Nenad Čanak]]'s [[League of Vojvodina Social Democrats]],  [[Žarko Korać]]'s [[Social Democratic Union (Serbia)|Social Democratic Union]], [[Nataša Mićić]]'s [[Civic Alliance of Serbia]]) and  a number of [[NGO]]s. They objected to the lack of public discussion, argued that the claims to Kosovo in the preamble were a populist attempt to encourage the voters. Some were also dissatisfied with the level of autonomy given to [[Vojvodina]].&lt;ref name="IWPR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iwpr.net/?p=brn&amp;s=f&amp;o=324813&amp;apc_state=henh|publisher=[[Institute for War and Peace Reporting|IWPR]] |date=18 October 2006|title=Serbia's New Constitution Gets Off to Rocky Start}}&lt;/ref&gt; (On the [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2007|2007 election]], those parties formed the coalition and entered the Parliament with about 5.3% support).

== The constitution ==
In the first article, Serbia is defined as a "state of the Serb people and all its citizens", and in the [[preamble]] [[Kosovo]] is defined as an "integral part" of [[Serbia]] with "fundamental autonomy". Also, it defines Serbia as an independent state for the first time since 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061027/ap_on_re_eu/serbia_referendum |title=Serbia votes in referendum on Kosovo |author=Katarina Kratovac |publisher=[[Yahoo! News]] |date=27 October 2006 |accessdate=2006-10-30}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it makes [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] the only alphabet for official use, while making provisions for minority languages to be used at the local level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/info/dokumenti/index.php?nav_id=213697|title=Šta donosi predlog novog ustava Srbije|date=30 September 2006|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences between the new constitution and that adopted in 1990 include the following:
*Only private, corporate and public property is acknowledged; ''social assets'' ceased to exist and were transferred to private.
*Foreign citizens can become owners of properties.
*For the first time constitution mentions "European values and standards".
*Full independence  is granted to the [[National Bank of Serbia]].
*Vojvodina is granted economic autonomy.
*Serbia has an official anthem, [[Bože pravde]].
*Rights of consumers, mothers, children, minorities are specially protected.
*Every citizen has the right to get information of public importance.
*Marriage is defined as the "union of a man and a woman".

==Controversy==
While it was more or less universally accepted that the new constitution draft was a significant improvement over the 1990 constitution, the main objections of the public were directed at the untransparent way in which the draft was drawn up and approved by parliament. Even President Tadić acknowledged that "...I sense a certain uneasiness that we did not have a full public discussion about the constitution, due to the speed and pace at which it was seems to be adopted".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2006&amp;mm=09&amp;dd=29&amp;nav_category=11&amp;nav_id=213590|publisher=[[B92]] |date=9 September 2006|title=Reakcije na predlog ustava|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[international law]] experts and independent analysts pointed out that the new article 16, which states that all international treaties must comply with the provisions of the constitution, sets up an inherent conflict, and can present an obstacle to the country's accession to [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="IWPR"/&gt;

Another obstacle was how to ensure the constitutional limit of 50% of registered voters. Republic Election Commission (RIK) placed the total number of electors at 6,639,385—that excluded Kosovo [[Albanians]], who have been boycotting all Serbian elections and censuses since 1990. Critics pointed that it's hypocritical to exclude Albanian voters from the balloting about the document which states that Kosovo is part of Serbia. Political analyst and president of [[Transparency Serbia]] Vladimir Goati said that  "It is pointless to state that they are not on the voter list, because they are boycotting all Serbian elections. If you recognize someone as a citizen of your country, then you cannot take away his or her right to boycott.";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2006&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=09&amp;nav_id=37227&amp;fs=1|title=Serbia sending the wrong message|publisher=B92|date=October 9, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929124240/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2006&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=09&amp;nav_id=37227&amp;fs=1|archivedate=September 29, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the practice of excluding Kosovo Albanians has been adopted in several elections before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/nations-transit/2005/kosovo|title=Kosovo|last=|first=|date=2005|website=Freedom House|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, opponents of the constitution like Serbia's Liberal Party&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/clinging-to-kosovo-serbia-passes-new-constitution-a-445401.html|title=Serbia Passes New Constitution|last=|first=|date=October 2006|website=Spiegel Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that the decision of the Republic Election Commission that potential extra amount of ballots will be ignored was unlawful and outrageous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2006&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=27&amp;nav_id=37612|publisher=[[B92]]|date=October 27, 2006|title=Extra ballots won’t pose problem|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929122840/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2006&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=27&amp;nav_id=37612|archivedate=September 29, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
[[File:Referendum Serbia 2006.jpg|thumb|200px|Referendum outcome]]According to preliminary counts published by the Republic Election Commission, 51.46% of the electorate (95.9% of those voting) supported the constitution, with 50% support needed for it to come into effect. The [[voter turnout]] amounted to 53.66%. The turnout of registered voters in Kosovo reached 90.1%,&lt;ref name="B92a"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2006&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=30&amp;nav_id=37645 |title=Voters confirm new Constitution |publisher=B92 |date=30 October 2006 |accessdate=2006-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929120427/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2006&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=30&amp;nav_id=37645 |archivedate=29 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albanians in Southern Serbia]] (Kosovo and Metohia) who constitute the majority of population in these areas ignored the referendum.&lt;ref name="BBC1"/&gt; The turnout in Vojvodina was also low (45.9%),&lt;ref name="B92a"/&gt; as several regional parties and NGOs called for a boycott, stating that the degree of the province's autonomy was insufficient.

Opponents of the referendum point to the fact that the timing of the turnout was peculiar: after the first day of voting, the turnout was only 18.03%, and on Sunday morning it started rising slowly, reaching 46% at 5PM.{{Verify source|date=July 2007}}. Then, in the last three hours of voting, the turnout rose to around 53%. The Speaker of the Vojvodina provincial assembly, [[Bojan Kostreš]], accused the authorities of "forcing the new constitution". "The final voting hours were very strange, with a sudden, steep rise in turnout", he said.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/worldlatest/story/0,,-6179477,00.html |title=Serb Vote Reasserts Claim Over Kosovo|publisher=[[The Guardian|Guardian]]|date=30 October 2006 |accessdate=2006-10-30 | location=London}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several political analysts pointed out that similar scenarios have happened before; analyst [[Đorđe Vukadinović]] stated that "...the turnout of three to five percent per hour has been reached on several occasions in the past ten years.",&lt;ref name="Poligraf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/info/emisije/poligraf.php?yyyy=2006&amp;mm=10&amp;nav_id=217894|title=Postreferendumske poruke i pouke|publisher=B92|date=31 October 2006|language=Serbian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070325144657/http://www.b92.net/info/emisije/poligraf.php?yyyy=2006&amp;mm=10&amp;nav_id=217894|archivedate=25 March 2007|df=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while many commentators also pointed out that non-stop public messages on TV urging people to vote, the appearance of [[Serbian Patriarch Pavle]] voting on a TV broadcast, and an increase in awareness about the problems that would occur if the referendum failed, may also have played the role in increasing turnout.

The final results of the referendum were declared by the Republic Election Commission on 2 November 2006: voter turnout amounted to 3,645,517, or 54.91% of the electorate (totally 6,639,385 citizens), of which 25,866 votes were declared invalid and thus the final valid figure of 3,619,221 votes published. The new constitution was supported by 3,521,724 voters, or 53.04% of the electorate and 96.60% of those voting; 97,497 voters (1.47% of those registered and 2.67% of those voting) were against the new constitution; 25,866 votes were invalid.&lt;ref name="RTSa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rts.rs/jedna_vest.asp?IDNews=165906|title=Proglašeni konačni rezultati, za ustav glasalo 53,04 odsto|publisher=[[Radio Television of Serbia|RTS]]|accessdate=2006-11-02|language=Serbian}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
The referendum and the text of the new Serbian Constitution have been sharply criticized by [[International Crisis Group]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/AMMF-6VCJFG?OpenDocument Serbia’s new constitution: "Democracy going backwards"], ReliefWeb.com, 8 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the drawbacks, the [[European Union]] and [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] endorsed the proposed changes. Cristina Gallach, spokeswoman of  EU High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy [[Javier Solana]], stated that "[The EU] positively assesses the fact that Serbia is changing the Constitution from the time of [[Slobodan Milošević]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.rs/Bilteni/Engleski/b021006_e.html#N4|title=Gallach: Eu Positively Assesses Adoption of New Serbian Constitution|publisher=Serbian Ministry of Foreign affairs bulletin|date=October 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''single-subject rule''' is a rule in the [[constitutional law]] of some jurisdictions that stipulates that some or all types of [[legislation]] may deal with only one main issue. One purpose is to avoid complexity in laws, to avoid any hidden consequences that legislators or voters may miss when reading the proposed law.  Another is to prevent legislators attaching an unpopular provision ("[[rider (politics)|rider]]") to an unrelated popular one, whether in the hope of sneaking the unpopular one through, or in the hope of causing the popular one to be rejected (a type of [[wrecking amendment]]).

==Scope of a bill==
In [[English law]], the [[long title]] of a [[Bill (law)|bill]] or [[act of parliament]] states its purpose; this may enumerate multiple purposes, or end with a vague formula like "and for other purposes". A proposed amendment to a bill may be rejected if it is outside the scope defined in its long title; alternatively, the title may be amended to increase its scope.  An [[omnibus bill]] covers a number of diverse or unrelated topics.

==Australia==
[[Section 55 of the Constitution of Australia]] provides a single-subject rule for taxation legislation: "Laws imposing taxation shall deal only with the imposition of taxation, and any provision therein dealing with any other matter shall be of no effect". The same section also requires laws imposing taxation to "deal with one subject of taxation only" (except those relating to customs and excise).&lt;ref&gt;[[Constitution of Australia]], [http://www6.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s55.html section 55]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ireland==
The 1937 [[Constitution of Ireland]] states that "A Bill containing a proposal or proposals for the [[Amendments to the Constitution of Ireland|amendment of this Constitution]] shall not contain any other proposal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#article46_4|title=Constitution of Ireland|date=October 2015|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|pages=Article 46.5|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in contrast to the 1922 [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]], which could be [[Implied repeal|implicitly amended]].&lt;ref name="FordeLeonard2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Forde|first1=Michael|last2=Leonard|first2=David|title=Constitutional Law of Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YVsQAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA316|accessdate=3 June 2016|year=2013|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781847667380|pages=316, fn.72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Switzerland==
In [[Swiss law]], the "principle of the unity of the subject matter" ({{lang-de|Grundsatz der Einheit der Materie}}, {{lang-fr|principe de l'unité de la matière}}) applies to [[federal popular initiative]]s and to parliamentary legislation that is [[Referendums by country#Switzerland|subject to a referendum]]. It has been derived by the [[Swiss Federal Supreme Court]] from the provision in article 34, section 2 of the [[Swiss Federal Constitution]] which guarantees "the freedom of the citizen to form an opinion and to give genuine expression to his or her will" in the exercise of political rights. The Court has outlined the principle as follows:

:"The principle of the unity of the subject matter requires that the subject of a referendum may, in principle, have only one topic area as its subject, that is, that two or several substantive questions or subject matters may not be joined into one referendum proposition in such a way that the voters face a dilemma and do not have a free choice between the several parts. If an item of legislation addresses several substantive questions or subject matters, the unity of the subject matter is only preserved if the several parts have a material intrinsic connection with each other, are materially related to each other and are aimed at the same goal; this material connection may not be merely artificial, subjective or political in nature. (...) Because the concept of the unity of the subject matter is a relative one, and because the weight given to the several parts of a legislative proposition and their relationship to each other is principally a political question, the authorities enjoy wide discretion in the shaping of referendum propositions."&lt;ref&gt; [[Swiss Federal Supreme Court]], judgment [http://jumpcgi.bger.ch/cgi-bin/JumpCGI?id=12.09.2006_1P.223/2006 1P.223/2006] of 12 September 2006, section 2; author's translation of the German original.&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
The single subject rule exists in 41 [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]] in the [[United States of America]].  

For example, the [[constitution of Minnesota]], Article IV, Section 17, requires that "No law shall embrace more than one subject, which shall be expressed in its title." Conversely, neither the [[U.S. Congress]] nor the [[U.S. Constitution]] has such a rule so riders which are completely unrelated to the main [[bill (law)|bill]] are commonplace. These [[Amend (motion)|amendments]] are often put into bills at the last minute, so that any [[United States House of Representatives|representative]] who may read the legislation before actually voting on it will not have a chance to catch it. An effort is underway, however, to add a [[single subject amendment]] to the U.S. Constitution to apply a single subject rule to the Congress.&lt;ref name=article&gt;{{cite web| url=http://articlevcaucus.com/uncategorized/july-newsletter/| title=July Newsletter| publisher=Article V News| accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been charged that single-subject rules have been misused as a political or judicial measure to slow or nullify ballot initiatives.  An example of accusation of misuse of this law occurred in [[Colorado]] when a former governor made a statement against a single-subject ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_3929774 |title=Court bars immigration vote |publisher=The Denver Post |date=June 13, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616115209/http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_3929774 |archivedate=June 16, 2006 |accessdate=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule can also result in overly narrow questions, that result in no substantial effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/default.aspx?tabid=16542 |title=Single Subject Rules |date=May 8, 2009 |publisher=[[National Conference of State Legislatures]] |accessdate=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case law===
*In July 2006, the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia Supreme Court]] ruled that a November 2004 [[constitutional amendment|amendment]] to the [[constitution of Georgia (U.S. state)|constitution of Georgia]] against [[same-sex marriage]] would be allowed to stand, despite also banning recognition of same-sex marriages done in other states, and banning [[civil union]]s. Additionally, voters in the [[referendum]] were told of only the same-sex marriage question, while the [[ballot]] failed to mention the other two issues, preventing voters from giving fully [[informed consent]]. A judge had previously ruled that voters had the right to decide the issue of civil unions separately, thus putting the two issues as one violated Georgia's single-subject rule.

The '''Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects''', also known as the '''Space Liability Convention''', is a [[treaty]] from 1972 that expands on the [[legal liability|liability]] rules created in the [[Outer Space Treaty]] of 1967. In 1978, the crash of the [[nuclear-power]]ed Soviet [[satellite]] [[Kosmos 954]] in Canadian territory led to the only claim filed under the Convention.&lt;ref name="Energy_Resources_for_Space_Missions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacesafetymagazine.com/2014/01/16/energy-resources-space-missions/ |title=Energy Resources for Space Missions |publisher=Space Safety Magazine |accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Status==
The Liability Convention was concluded and opened for signature on 29 March 1972.&lt;ref&gt;https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%20961/volume-961-I-13810-English.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It entered into force on 1 September 1972.&lt;ref&gt;https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%20961/volume-961-I-13810-English.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1 January 2013, 89 States have ratified the Liability Convention, 22 have signed but not ratified and three international [[intergovernmental organizations]] (the [[European Space Agency]], the [[European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites]], and the [[European Telecommunications Satellite Organization]]) have declared their acceptance of the rights and obligations provided for in the Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/SpaceLaw/liability.html |title=Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects |publisher=United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key provisions==
States (countries) bear international responsibility for all space objects that are launched within their territory. This means that regardless of who launches the space object, if it was launched from State A's territory, or from State A's facility, or if State A caused the launch to happen, then State A is fully liable for damages that result from that space object.

===Joint launches===
If two states work together to launch a space object, then both of those states are jointly and severally liable for the damage that object causes. This means that the injured party can sue either of the two states for the full amount of damage.

===Claims between states only===
Claims under the Liability Convention must be brought by the state against a state. The Convention was created to supplement existing and future national laws providing compensation to parties injured by space activities. Whereas under most national legal systems an individual or a corporation may bring a lawsuit against another individual or another corporation, under the Liability Convention claims must be brought on the state level only. This means that if an individual is injured by a space object and wishes to seek compensation under the Liability Convention, the individual must arrange for his or her country to make a claim against the country that launched the space object that caused the damage.

'''''Torcaso v. Watkins''''', 367 U.S. 488 (1961), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the court reaffirmed that the [[United States Constitution]] prohibits States and the Federal Government from [[Religious qualifications for public office in the United States|requiring any kind of religious test for public office]], in the specific case, as a [[notary public]].

==Background==
In the early 1960s, the [[Governor of Maryland]] appointed Roy Torcaso (November 13, 1910 – June 9, 2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Adam Bernstein|title=Roy Torcaso, 96; Defeated Md. in 1961 Religious Freedom Case|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/20/AR2007062002276.html|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 21, 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[notary public]]. At the time, the [[Constitution of Maryland]] required "a declaration of belief in the existence of God" in order for a person to hold "any office of profit or trust in this State".&lt;ref&gt;[[Constitution of Maryland]], Article 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Torcaso, an [[atheism|atheist]], refused to make such a statement, and his appointment was consequently revoked. Torcaso, believing his constitutional rights to freedom of religious expression had been infringed, filed suit in a [[Maryland]] [[Circuit Court]], only to be rebuffed. The Circuit Court rejected his claim, and the [[Maryland Court of Appeals]] held that the requirement in the Maryland Constitution for a declaration of belief in God as a qualification for office was self-executing&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution=Self-executing|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Self-Executing|editor=Jeffrey Lehman|editor2=Shirelle Phelps|title=West's Encyclopedia of American Law|edition=2nd|location=Detroit, Mich.|publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|Thomson/Gale]]|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7876-6367-4}} (reproduced on [[TheFreeDictionary.com]]).&lt;/ref&gt; and did not require any implementing legislation to be enacted by the state legislature.

The Court of Appeals justified its decision thus:

{{quote|The petitioner is not compelled to believe or disbelieve, under threat of punishment or other compulsion. True, unless he makes the declaration of belief, he cannot hold public office in Maryland, but he is not compelled to hold office.}}

Torcaso took the matter to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]], where it was heard on April 24, 1961.

==The Court's decision==
The Court unanimously found that Maryland's requirement for a person holding public office to state a belief in God violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] Amendments to the [[United States Constitution]].

The Court had previously established in ''[[Everson v. Board of Education]]'' (1947):

{{quote|The "establishment of religion" clause of the First Amendment means at least this: Neither a state nor the Federal Government can set up a church. Neither can pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another. Neither can force nor influence a person to go to or to remain away from church against his will or force him to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion.}}

Writing for the Court, Justice [[Hugo Black]] recalled ''Everson v. Board of Education'', and explicitly linked ''Torcaso v. Watkins'' to its conclusions:

{{quote|There is, and can be, no dispute about the purpose or effect of the Maryland Declaration of Rights requirement before us — it sets up a religious test which was designed to and, if valid, does bar every person who refuses to declare a belief in God from holding a public "office of profit or trust" in Maryland.
...
We repeat and again reaffirm that neither a State nor the Federal Government can constitutionally force a person "to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion." Neither can constitutionally pass laws or impose requirements which aid all religions as against non-believers, and neither can aid those religions based on a belief in the existence of God as against those religions founded on different beliefs.}}

Rebuffing the judgment of the Maryland Court of Appeals, Justice Black added: "The fact, however, that a person is not compelled to hold public office cannot possibly be an excuse for barring him from office by state-imposed criteria forbidden by the Constitution."

The Court did not base its holding on the [[no religious test clause]] of [[Article VI of the United States Constitution|Article VI]]. In Footnote 1 of the opinion Justice Black wrote:

{{quote|Appellant also claimed that the State's test oath requirement violates the provision of Art. VI of the Federal Constitution that "no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States." Because we are reversing the judgment on other grounds, we find it unnecessary to consider appellant's contention that this provision applies to state as well as federal offices.}}

==Secular humanism as religion==

It has occasionally been argued that in ''Torcaso v. Watkins'' the Supreme Court "found" [[secular humanism]] to be a religion. This assertion is based on a reference, by Justice Black in footnote number 11 of the Court's finding, to court cases where organized groups of self-identified humanists, or ethicists, meeting on a regular basis to share and celebrate their beliefs, have been granted religious-based tax exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Torcaso v. Watkins, Footnote 11|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/367/488/case.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Justice Black's use of the term "secular humanism" in his footnote has been seized upon by some religious groups, such as those supporting causes such as teaching [[creationism]] in schools, as a "finding" that any secular or non-observable evolution-based activity is, in fact, religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Matt Cherry|author2=Molleen Matsumura|title=10 Myths About Secular Humanism|url=http://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php?section=library&amp;page=cherry1_18_1&amp;back=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.secularhumanism.org%2Flib%2Flist.php%3Fpublication%3Dfi%26vol%3D18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819025423/http://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php?section=library&amp;page=cherry1_18_1&amp;back=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.secularhumanism.org%2Flib%2Flist.php%3Fpublication%3Dfi%26vol%3D18|archivedate=19 August 2012|magazine=[[Free Inquiry]]|date=Winter 1997–1998|volume=18|issue=1}}; {{citation|title=Is "Secular Humanism" a "Religion"?|url=http://vftonline.org/Patriarchy/definitions/humanism_religion.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521123706/http://vftonline.org/Patriarchy/definitions/humanism_religion.htm|archivedate=May 21, 2013|publisher=Vine &amp; Fig Tree|accessdate=August 2, 2013}}.

The '''Spanish–Portuguese treaty''' of 1750 or '''Treaty of Madrid''' was a document signed in the [[Madrid|Spanish capital]] by [[Ferdinand VI of Spain]] and [[John V of Portugal]] on 13 January 1750, to end armed conflict over a border dispute between the [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese empire]]s in [[South America]] in the vicinity of the [[Uruguay River]], an area known as the [[Banda Oriental]] (now comprising parts of [[Uruguay]], [[Argentina]] and the state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], [[Brazil]]). The treaty established borders between the Spanish and Portuguese empires, ceding much of what is today's country of Brazil to the Portuguese.

==Background==
:''See also [[Spanish–Portuguese War (1735–37)]]''

*Political: Treaties of Tordesillas and Zaragoza
Earlier treaties such as the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] and the [[Treaty of Zaragoza]] authored by both countries, and as mediated by [[Pope Alexander VI]], stipulated that the Portuguese empire in South America could extend no farther west than 370 leagues west of [[Cape Verde Islands]] (called the [[Tordesillas meridian]], approx. the [[46th meridian west|46th meridian]]). Had these treaties remained unchanged, the Spanish would have held both what is today the city of [[São Paulo]] and all land to the west and south. Thus, Brazil would be only a fraction of its present-day size.

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

*Territorial: discovery of gold in Mato Grosso in 1695; Portuguese gains in the lower Amazon
Starting in the 17th century, Portuguese explorers, traders, and missionaries from the state of Maranhao in the north, and gold-seekers and slave-hunters, the famous ''bandeirantes'' of São Paulo, in the south, had penetrated far to the west and far to the south of the old imaginary treaty-line.
**New [[captaincies of Brazil|captaincies]] (administrative divisions) created by the Portuguese beyond Brazil's previously-established boundaries: Minas Gerais, Goias, Mato Grosso, Santa Catarina

*To strike a balance between the boundary claims of Spain and Portugal by allotting the greater part of the Amazon basin to the latter country and that of the Rio de la Plata to the former 
*To secure the undisputed sovereignty of the gold and diamond districts of Goias and Mato Grosso for the Portuguese Crown
*To secure Brazil's frontier by the retention of the Rio Grande do Sul and the acquisition of the Spanish Jesuit missions ("Seven Peoples") on the left bank of the river Uruguay
*To secure the western frontier of Brazil and river communication with Maranhao-Para by ensuring that navigation on the rivers Tocantins, Tapajos and Madeira remain in Portuguese hands

===Spain===
*To stop the westward advance of the Portuguese, who had already encroached on much of what was theoretically Spanish territory even though it consisted mostly of virgin jungle
*To transfer to Spain the Portuguese colony of Sacramento, which had functioned as a backdoor for the illegal Anglo-Portuguese trade with the Viceroyalty of Peru and which rendered the Spanish city of [[Buenos Aires]] dangerously exposed to foreign invasion
*To undermine the Anglo-Portuguese alliance, and thus eventually to facilitate a union between the two Iberian powers in South America against English aggression and ambition

==Cartographic issues==
*1722 map of French cartographer Guillaume de Lisle
*1749 map of Alexandre de Gusmão: Mappa das Cortes, or Mapa de las Cortes

==International context==
*Philippines &amp; Moluccas under Spanish sovereignty

==Structure of the Treaty==
The original was in both Portuguese and Spanish. The treaty consists of a lengthy preamble, and 26 articles.

==Terms of the Treaty==
The Treaty of Madrid was based on the principles of ''[[Uti possidetis|Uti possidetis, ita possideatis]]'' from [[Roman law]] (who owns by fact owns by right) and “natural boundaries”, stating respectively in the preamble: “each party must stay with what it now holds” and “the boundaries of the two Domains... are the sources and courses of the most notable rivers and mountains”, and thereby authorizing the Portuguese to retain the lands they had occupied at the expense of the Empire of Spain. The treaty also stipulated that Spain would receive the [[Sacramento Colony]] and Portugal the [[Misiones Orientales]]. These were seven independent [[Jesuit Reductions|Jesuit missions]] of the upper [[Uruguay River]].
*Treaty of Torsedillas specifically abrogated
*Definition of the boundary
The treaty sensibly sought to follow geographic features in fixing the boundary: it moved westward from a point on the Atlantic coast south of Rio Grande do Sul, then northward irregularly following parts of the Uruguay, Iguaçu, Paraná, Paraguay, Guapore, Madeira, and Javari Rivers, and north of the Amazon, ran from the middle Negro to the watershed between the Amazon and Orinoco basins and along the Guiana watershed to the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bethell, ed.|first=Leslie|title=Colonial Brazil|year=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521349253|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Savelle|first=Max|title=Empires to Nations: Expansion in America, 1713-1824|year=1974|publisher=Univ Of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0816607815|pages=132–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Mapping
Soon after signing it, two commissions for demarcation were created. The Northern, chaired by the State Governor of Grão-Pará and Maranhão, in the South headed on the Portuguese side by the Governor of Rio de Janeiro.

==Aftermath==
The Treaty of Madrid was significant because it substantially defined the modern boundaries of [[Brazil]]. However, the resistance of the Jesuits to surrendering their missions and the refusal of the Guarani to be forcibly relocated led to the nullification of the treaty by the subsequent [[Treaty of El Pardo (1761)|Treaty of El Pardo]], signed by both countries in 1761. The opposition by the Guarani led to the [[Guarani War]] of 1756. The terms of the Treaty of Madrid, with a few exceptions, were re-established in the [[First Treaty of San Ildefonso]] in 1777, and that treaty was again negated in 1801.

'''Tristar &amp; Red Sector Incorporated''' ('''TRSI''') is a [[demogroup]] which formed in 1990. It came about from the longest-running cooperation in scene history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=50792 Information on the cooperation]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RSI''' existed from 1985, before being joined by the "T" later on. Evolving from the [[Commodore 64]] to the [[Amiga]] and later to [[Personal computer|PC]] and various [[game console]] platforms - like the [[PlayStation]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[Nintendo]] - and set-ups like Arduino, Android or Blu-ray, '''TRSI''' released a number of digital productions, dedicated to experimenting in phreaking or network alteration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abebooks.de/9781155346267/Demo-Groups-Exceptions-Castor-Cracking-1155346262/plp renown]&lt;/ref&gt; Its members were spread around the world and still contribute to computer scene art and code after more than 27 years of history.

==History==

===1985 to 1987===
Red Sector Incorporated (RSI) was founded with a focus on the [[Commodore 64]] as a group for [[Software cracking|cracks]], fixes, [[Cheating (video games)#Trainers|trainers]], packs, [[Demo (computer programming)|intros]] and [[Demo (computer programming)|demos]]. The founders were three suppliers from [[Canada]]: Bill Best, Greg and Kangol Kid. After the initial formation in the spring of 1985, The Skeleton and Baudsurfer set up RSI's first domain, "The Pirates Ship" [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] the following summer, which eventually became the "Dawn of Eternity" BBS.

At the end of the year, Irata&lt;ref&gt;[http://noname.c64.org/csdb/scener/?id=4380 Irata]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; Mister Zeropage were asked to join the group and set up a European section in [[Germany]], with Irata being the group's main trader, followed by additional importers in the [[United States]]. Slogans at the time included "No risk, no fun - Red Sector Number One" &amp; "Red Sector - The Leading Force".&lt;ref&gt;[http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ql69172U-og/0.jpg Logo of The Leading Force]&lt;/ref&gt; The Light Circle was a basis for several future European members of RSI, a coalition of Radwar Enterprises, Cracking Force Berlin &amp; Flash Cracking Formation.

Red Sector Incorporated first released on the [[Amiga 1000]] in 1986. During the summer, RSI decided to concentrate on the [[Amiga]] and formed an Amiga division.

In the beginning of 1987, Red Sector's [[Commodore 64]] section became dormant, to bundle forces on the Amiga. At this time, RSI's first Amiga demo was coded by HQC and released to the Scene. It was followed by the second, "Twilight with Music" by [[Karsten Obarski]]. At the end of the year, a short-term cooperation was formed with Ghenna of Defjam, marking the first group cooperation on the Amiga.

===1988 to 1989===
By now, all active members had moved to the [[Amiga]]. A fast stream of imports from the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] continued to be processed in [[Europe]]. Among a wave of police raids, Irata &amp; Mister Zeropage got busted and [https://web.archive.org/web/20120323074206/http://www.cracktros.com/screens/r/RedSector_tr02.png RSI] fell asleep for a period of time.
A slow restart by Irata, Onyx &amp; SLL began the recovery of Red Sector Incorporated in the second half of this year, while Onyx came to know TCC Design. For the first time, RSI met Tristar members to party together. RSI and Defjam restarted releasing together. Later on, Irata became the main leader of the group. Slogan at the time: "RSI - The Voice of the Underground".
In 1989, Red Sector Incorporated recruited The Clumsy Creepers as their [[Demo (computer programming)|demo]] division on Amiga. The filemagazine "News on Tour" got its first issue in August, written by RSI.
In September, the [http://www.classicamiga.com/images/stories/jreviews/demoscene/R/RSI-MegaDemoI-1_001.png "Red Sector Mega Demo"] was published for ECS, a [http://www.mindcandydvd.com/2/frames?p=demos milestone in scene demo history] and an instant classic, manufactured as a two 3½&amp;nbsp;inch disc production, winning the "Tristar Party" demo competition. It later had been voted one of the best ten Amiga demos ever. Among others: Coding by TCC Design, Doctor Beat, Delta. Music by Romeo Knight, SCS, Mark 2 &amp; Bit Arts. Graphics by Scum, Dark, Doctor C, Rat Sign, Delta.
The demo division also released [http://www.classicamiga.com/images/stories/jreviews/software/R/rsi%20demo%20maker%20(1991)(red%20sector)_001.png "The Red Sector Demomaker"] on the Amiga, which was distributed by [[Data Becker]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8165">'''Uninsured employer''' in the United States is a term to identify an employer of workers under circumstances where there is no form of insurance in place to provide certain benefits to those workers.  More specifically, it is a term used in [[Workers' compensation|workers’ compensation]] law to identify an employer who does not have some form of worker’s compensation [[insurance]] or [[self-insurance]] coverage in effect at the time of, or during the time of, a claimed injury.

All States require that employers provide injury benefits coverage to their employees. These benefits are called workers’ compensation insurance coverage.  This kind of coverage is to be distinguished from [[Legal liability|liability]] coverage, which covers the premises and the owner/occupier of the space from claims made by non-employees for injuries on the premises. It is also to be distinguished from [[health insurance]], which covers only medical bills for non-work incurred conditions.

Protection can be accomplished through a traditional insurance policy for workers’ compensation coverage. Coverage can also be accomplished by way of compliance with various State self-insurance laws (usually reserved for larger employers) requiring substantial [[Surety bond|bonding]] and self-funding.  For example, public agencies are usually permissibly self-insured.

When the employer has no specific insurance, or arrangement for the provision of workers’ compensation benefits to injured employees, the employer is then referred to as an uninsured employer.

==Criminal law as per state ==
This status is highly negative one in most States and often deemed a crime under State law. When there are no funds available to cover the benefits, and resulting bills for such benefits, the State usually steps in and provides the funding; hence the State’s interest in making the failure to have coverage both legally and financially painful. Most often this involves complete repayment to the State, fines, penalties, business closure, and the loss of legal defenses.  The seriousness of the status by the uninsured employer is often underestimated due to unfamiliarity with the system and the belief that, like automobile uninsured motorist law, a quick settlement can be made by the uninsured for a modest amount to end the process.  This is contrary to State law and recent studies in California have shown that for 2009 average claim cost is upwards of $60,000 and continually rising.

==State-based uninsured employers fund==
Most often US states set aside fund to pay claims to injured workers under certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://dwd.wisconsin.gov/wc/insurance/uef_info_doc.htm | title = Worker's Compensation: Uninsured Employers Fund | publisher = Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below are some examples:

===California Uninsured Employers Fund===
Two special funds pay claims to injured workers under certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dir.ca.gov/dwc/claims.html | title = Division of Workers' Compensation - Uninsured Employers Benefits Trust Fund (UEBTF) &amp; Subsequent Injuries Benefits Trust Fund (SIBTF) | publisher = California Department of Industrial Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Claims are paid from the Uninsured Employers Benefits Trust Fund (UEBTF) when illegally uninsured employers fail to pay workers' compensation benefits awarded to their injured employees by the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board. The UEBTF is funded by a small tax on every Workers' Compensation policy that is written, and the UEBTF typically places liens on assets of the uninsured employers until the debt is repaid.  To do so, a Special Notice of Lawsuit must be properly served upon the uninsured employer to give the UEBTF legal jurisdiction for the recovery.
* The Subsequent Injuries Benefits Trust Fund (SIBTF) is a source of additional compensation to injured workers who already had a disability or impairment at the time of injury. For benefits to be paid from the SIBTF, the combined effect of the injury and the previous disability or impairment must result in a permanent disability of at least 70 percent. The fund enables employers to hire disabled workers without fear of being held liable for the effects of previous disabilities or impairments. SIBTF benefit checks are issued to injured workers by the SIBTF Claims Unit after benefits are awarded by the Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board.

===New York Uninsured Employers Fund===
* If an employee is hurt when there is no workers' compensation policy in effect and that employee chooses to file a workers' compensation claim, the employer will be liable for the actual cost of medical care and compensation payments, in addition to penalties. If a corporation has failed to secure workers' compensation coverage, the president, secretary and treasurer of a corporation are personally liable for the medical care, compensation payments, penalties and possible criminal prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wcb.ny.gov/content/main/Employers/UEF.jsp | title = Workers' Compensation Coverage: Uninsured Employers Fund | publisher = New York State Workers' Compensation Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New York State Workers' Compensation Board's Bureau of Compliance oversees uninsured claims. The Uninsured Employers Fund (UEF) is the funding mechanism for compensation and medical payments to injured employees whose employer was not properly insured at the time of the accident.

==Risks to an uninsured employer==
The risks to an uninsured employer are many, and can threaten the continued existence and viability of the firm. These risks include:

# Possibility of business closure
# Large fines imposed by the California Labor Commissioner ($2,000-$10,000 per Employee)
# Presumption of negligence
# Exposure to [[civil suit]]s by injured workers
# [[Criminal conviction]] and personal fines
# Imposition of a 10% surcharge in addition to the disability claim, plus attorney fees for the worker

==Dealing with problems==
While an uninsured employer does face a real problem, such as a prospective fine, prosecution, or employee injury, or is actually sued, there are steps the employer can take to minimize the consequences. Several established law firms can represent the employer in all administrative hearings and appeals, and advise the employer how to proceed. The goal for the uninsured employer is not only to achieve resolution to the immediate problem, but also to protect the assets of the firm, and to reach an accommodation with the regulatory agencies that enables the company to go forward in compliance with the law. The Uninsured Employer Benefit Trust Fund in CA does not have funding or staff to mitigate the value of an uninsured claim.  UEBTF merely pays the claim and all costs as claimed by the Applicant/Plaintiff, and assesses the cost against the uninsured employer.  If legal counsel is retained by the uninsured employer, there is at least opportunity to mitigate the value/reimbursement to UEBTF. Additionally, legal counsel can sometimes mitigate the administrative penalties, and negotiate repayment plans that allow the business to continue.

Kononov was convicted for his role in three deaths in Mazie Bati, a Latvian village where local inhabitants had denounced alleged partisans who were then killed by German troops. A short time later Kononov led a unit, posing as German [[Wehrmacht]] personnel, into the village and killed nine civilians, including three women, one in the late stages of pregnancy who was burned alive. A Latvian court declared the killing of the three women a war crime.
{{TOC limit}}

== Mazie Bati ==
On 29 February 1944, Latvian villagers from Mazie Bati (Malye Baty) allowed 12 men from the Soviet reconnaissance-sabotage group to stay in their barns. The next day, at six in the morning, the Germans, who Kononov suspected the villagers of aiding, burned and machine-gunned the barns. All 12 partisans, including the leader Major Chugunov, his wife Antonina and their 7-month-old son, were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Interview with Kononov's lawyer, Mikhail Ioffe, and others |series=Россия всегда с тобой |network=[[Voice of Russia]] |airdate=12 December 2007 |transcripturl=http://www.ruvr.ru/main.php?lng=rus&amp;q=54337&amp;cid=28&amp;p=19 December 2007 |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |script-title=ru:Европейский суд принял жалобу латвийского партизана Василия Кононова |url=http://www.newsru.com/world/21dec2007/kononov.html |work= |publisher=News.ru |language=Russian |date=21 December 2007 |accessdate=16 April 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 May 1944, a detachment of the Soviet First Latvian Partisan Battalion led by Kononov staged a "counter operation" against the village of Mazie Bati. In this operation, nine villagers were accused of being the "German auxiliaries" (the Latvian armed resistance against the Soviet occupation of Latvia sided with the German invaders in 1941) responsible for the prior incident. Kononov's men were sent to capture the villagers pursuant to an ad-hoc Military Tribunal verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Between Stalin and Hitler: Race War and Class War on the Dvina, 1940-46 |last=Swain |first=Geoffrey |year=2004 |publisher=RoutledgeCruzon |location=London &amp; New York |isbn=0-415-33193-5 |oclc=54826052 |pages=140, 247–8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kfd_4o7gOZ8C&amp;hl=en |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Перов |first=Олег |script-title=ru:Последний бой ветерана Кононова |url=http://www.echr.ru/news/msg.asp?id_msg=1279 |date=11 January 2008 |work=Вечерняя Москва | publisher=www.echr.ru |language=Russian |accessdate=16 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kononov and his men conducted the operation wearing German [[Wehrmacht]] uniforms so as not to arouse the suspicion of the villagers. Nine villagers were killed, including three women, one in the late stages of pregnancy who was burned alive. Buildings were burned as well.&lt;ref name="CKL"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/26015/ "ECHR favors Latvia in final Kononov ruling"], Baltic Times. Oskars Magone. 17 May 2010. Retrieved 18 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==War crime prosecution==

===Original conviction and dismissal===
In July 1998, original proceedings against Kononov were commenced by the Latvian Principal Public Prosecutor's Office, whereby in August 1998 he was formally charged and ultimately indicted in December 1998.&lt;ref name=CKL /&gt; Kononov pleaded not guilty at the trial which began in January 1999. Ample evidence of guilt was found by the court where Kononov was in violation of the [[Charter of the International Military Tribunal]] ("IMT") Nuremberg, the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907#Hague Convention of 1907|Hague Convention]] (IV) 1907 and the [[Geneva Convention (IV)]] 1949.&lt;ref name=CKL /&gt; He was found guilty and sentenced to six years imprisonment.&lt;ref name=CKL /&gt;

On 25 April 2000, the Criminal Affairs Division in Latvia overturned his conviction on the grounds that it was not clearly established whether Kononov was operating on occupied territory and whether he and his men could be considered combatants, as well as whether the villagers could be considered prisoners of war based on their armament by the Germans.&lt;ref name=CKL /&gt; On 27 June 2000, the Supreme Court of Latvia dismissed the prosecutor's appeal, ultimately setting Kononov free.&lt;ref name=CKL /&gt;

===Second investigation and conviction===
On 17 May 2001, Kononov was once again charged by the prosecutor's office following a new investigation. The deaths of six men were deemed justifiable, but the deaths of the three women were deemed an act of banditry, in violation of the law, but ultimately barred by statute of limitations.&lt;ref name=CKL /&gt; The prosecution appealed and on 30 April 2004, the decision of the lower court was overturned and Kononov was found guilty of war crimes, and subsequently jailed.&lt;ref name=CKL /&gt; On 28 September 2004, the Supreme Court upheld the verdict of the court in dismissing Kononov's appeal.&lt;ref name=CKL /&gt;

====Appeal to ECHR====
On 19 June 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |script-title=ru:Латвия расстанется с миллионами евро: И отдаст их российскому пенсионеру |last=Звегинцев |first=Валентин |work=[[Moskovskij Komsomolets]] |date=27 June 2008 |url=http://mk.ru/blogs/MK/2008/06/27/society/359665/20/ |language=Russian |accessdate=24 July 2008 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kononov's lawyer Mikhail Ioffe, announced that the [[European Court of Human Rights]] had overturned the Latvian court ruling. He also said that Kononov was seeking {{€|5,187,000}} in compensation for the two and a half years his client spent in a Latvian prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |script-title=ru:Европейский суд по правам человека удовлетворил иск ветерана войны к Латвии |publisher=[[Interfax]]|date=26 June 2008 |language=Russian |url=http://www.interfax.ru/society/news.asp?id=18972 |accessdate=16 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Biķernieks |first=Aivis |title=Kononova advokāts: bijušais partizāns Eiropas Cilvēktiesību tiesā uzvarējis Latviju |work=Neatkarīgā Rīta Avīze |date=26 June 2008 |url=http://www.nra.lv/zinas/3231-kononova-advokats-bijusais-partizans-eiropas-cilvektiesibu-tiesa-uzvarejis-latviju.htm |language=Latvian |accessdate=24 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A press release published by the ECHR on 24 July 2008 revealed the Court's decision, establishing, by four votes to three, that the Kononov's case presented a violation of Article 7 (no retrospective punishment) of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. Kononov was awarded {{€|30,000}} in respect of non-pecuniary damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Chamber Judgment: Kononov v. Latvia |publisher=[[European Court of Human Rights]] |date=24 July 2008 |url=http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=838484&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 |accessdate=16 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 October 2008, the government of Latvia decided to appeal the 24 July judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pārsūdzēs ECT spriedumu Kononova lietā |work=[[Diena]] |location=Riga |date=14 October 2008 |accessdate=15 October 2008 |language=Latvian |url=http://www.diena.lv/lat/politics/politika/parsudzes-ect-spriedumu-kononova-lieta }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 February 2009, the case Kononov v. Latvia was referred to the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Cases Accepted for Referral to the Grand Chamber |publisher=[[European Court of Human Rights]] |date=2 February 2009 |url=http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=846915&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 |accessdate=16 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009, Lithuania has joined Latvia using its right to participate in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |script-title=ru:Литва получила статус "третьей стороны" по делу Кононова |work=Gazeta.ru |date=6 May 2009 |url=http://www.gazeta.ru/news/lenta/2009/05/06/n_1359046.shtml |language=Russian |accessdate=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Final ruling=====
In May 2010, the Grand Chamber ruled, by 14 votes to 3, that the case presented no violation of Article 7 ECHR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |title=Grand Chamber judgment in case ''Kononov v. Latvia''|url=http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=867803&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 |date=17 May 2010 |work=| publisher=European Court of Human Rights |accessdate=17 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Hague Regulations of 1907, the court determined Kononov could be punished for failing to meet the  regulation criteria, specifically, wearing German Wehrmacht uniforms while carrying out the crimes. The court determined the execution of the villagers was in violation of established international law at the time, as Kononov was only entitled to arrest them, and his conviction was not barred by statute of limitations.&lt;ref name=CKL /&gt;

====Support from Russia====
At various times throughout the period of his prosecution for alleged war crimes, Kononov has received official support from the [[Government of Russia]]. In April 2000, immediately before judgement was to be handed down in his appeal with the [[Supreme Court of Latvia]], he was offered citizenship of the Russian Federation by President [[Vladimir Putin]]. Kononov accepted the offer, which entailed giving up his previously-held Latvian citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |script-title=ru:Партизан Кононов отказался от гражданства Латвии |url=http://www.lenta.ru/world/2000/05/25/kononov/ |language=Russian |publisher=[[Lenta.Ru]] |date=25 May 2000 |accessdate=16 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228223645/http://lenta.ru/world/2000/05/25/kononov/ |archivedate=28 February 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the event of his 80th birthday in 2003, Kononov received personal greetings from the Russian President, delivered at a ceremony held in the Russian Embassy in Riga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |script-title=ru:Василия Кононова ждут в российском посольстве на торжественную церемонию |url=http://www.1tv.ru/news/n49985 |publisher=[[Channel One (Russia)|Первый канал]] |language=Russian |date=3 January 2003 |accessdate=16 April 2009 }} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the hearings of his case at the ECHR, Russia acted as a third party,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Russian MFA Information and Press Department Commentary on ECHR Ruling in Favor of Vasiliy Kononov in WWII Veteran's Case vs. Latvia |publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation]] |date=25 July 2008 |url=http://www.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/e78a48070f128a7b43256999005bcbb3/f1b3183690db0fefc32574910049538b?OpenDocument |accessdate=16 April 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; and on occasion publicly urged the Court to prioritise Kononov's case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=European court urged to give Soviet veteran priority |url=http://www.russiatoday.com/Top_News/2007-03-21/European_court_urged_to_give_Soviet_veteran_priority.html |publisher=[[Russia Today]] |date=21 March 2007 |accessdate=16 April 2009 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sergey Mironov]], [[speaker (politics)|speaker]] of the [[Federation Council of Russia]], expressed hopes that President [[Dmitry Medvedev]]'s [[Historical Truth Commission]] would also become involved in the Kononov case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |script-title=ru:Кремлевская комиссия займется делом Кононова |url=http://rus.delfi.lv/archive/article.php?id=24659049 |language=Russian |publisher=[[Delfi (web portal)|DELFI.lv]] |date=20 May 2009 |accessdate=24 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Impact on Nuremberg legacy====
Kononov's defence team, along with Russia's representative to the ECHR, Deputy Justice Minister [[Georgi Matyushkin]], warned the ruling poses grave dangers to the legal legacy of the [[Nuremberg tribunals]] from World War II.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.ruvr.ru/2010/05/17/7994664.html "Strasbourg sides with Nazis"], [[Voice of Russia]]. 17 May 2010. Retrieved 18 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Matyushkin stated "there are signs of attempts to revise the results of the Nuremberg processes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=15132916&amp;PageNum=0 "Strasbourg court verdict to Soviet WWII veteran arouses regret in Russia"]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ITAR-TASS. 17 May 2010. Retrieved 18 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[William Schabas]], Latvia's counsel at the ECtHR trial, on the contrary, considers that the dissenting minority held Nuremberg judgment to be contrary to the Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://humanrightsdoctorate.blogspot.com/2010/05/kononov-war-crimes-judgment-issued-by.html Kononov War Crimes Judgment Issued by European Court of Human Rights Grand Chamber]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Skepticism====
Kononov's former superior officer, later academician and Soviet functionary, [[Vilis Samsons]], has questioned some of the First Latvian Partisan Battalion's wartime reports upon which the accusations against Kononov are based, alleging the description of the Mazie Bati operation was rife with factual errors and imprecisions.&lt;ref&gt;V. Samsons to H. Strods 20 July 2005, in: {{cite book |title=PSRS kaujinieki Latvijā (1941–1945) |last=Strods |first=Heinrihs |year=2007 |volume=2 |location=Riga |publisher=LU žurnāla "Latvijas Vēsture" fonds |language=Latvian |isbn=9984-643-80-8 |oclc=167627319 |page=355 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Kononov died in Latvia on 31 March 2011 at the age of 88. In a telegram to Kononov's family, [[Russian President]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] stated: "Vasily Kononov selflessly fought the Nazi invaders throughout the years of the Great Patriotic War. He remained loyal to the common bonds forged in battle and defended the truth about the events of those years throughout his entire life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://eng.kremlin.ru/news/1996#sel=3:1,4:25|title=Condolences to family of Great Patriotic War veteran Vasily Kononov|date=1 April 2011|publisher=[[Presidential Press and Information Office]]|accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2009}}
In recognition of his wartime service, the [[Soviet Union]] awarded Kononov various honours, including:
* the [[Order of Lenin]];
* the [[Order of the Patriotic War]], first class;
