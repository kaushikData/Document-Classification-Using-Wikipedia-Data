The officers planned to remove the secular government of [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] with an Islamic government led [[Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad|Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed]]. Sheikh Mujib and most of his family members were killed in the coup.&lt;ref name="sza"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Liton|first1=Shakhawat|title=Shame darker than the night|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/shame-darker-the-night-1270021|website=thedailystar.net|publisher=The Daily Star|accessdate=10 August 2017|language=en|date=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/august-15-special-coverage/aug-15-world-media-1269661|title=Aug 15 in world media|date=2009-11-19|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-08-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Sheikh Mujibur Rahman declared Bangladesh's independence in 26 March 1971 from Pakistan.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theindependentbd.com/arcprint/details/55894/2016-08-15|title=Tragedy of 15 August 1975|last=Independent|first=The|work=Tragedy of 15 August 1975 {{!}} theindependentbd.com|access-date=2017-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bangladesh fought a 9-month liberation war that ended with the surrender of Pakistani forces in Bangladesh to an allied force of Bangladeshi and Indian Armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangladesh|title=Bangladesh - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bangladesh Awami League in 1973 won by a landslide in the first parliamentary election of Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; On 7 June 1975, [[Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League]] was formed which made Bangladesh a one party state with the passing of the fourth amendment to the constitution; and Sheikh Mujibur was made the President of the one party state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangladesh_Krishak_Sramik_Awami_League|title=Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Major [[Shariful Haque Dalim]] and his wife had gotten into a scuffle with the sons of [[Gazi Golam Mostafa]], at a function in [[Dhaka Ladies Club|Dhaka Ladies club]]. In retaliation, some officers and soldiers of the Lancer unit and 2 Field Artillery Regiment of Bangladesh Army attacked the residence of Golam Mostofa. Golam Mostofa was a leader of [[Bangladesh Awami League]], the ruling party of Bangladesh. Major Dalim, Major [[S.H.M.B Noor Chowdhury]] and others officers were charged with breech of discipline. Major Dalim had sought help from President Sheikh Mujib but was refused. Major [[Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan]] resigned from the army over the incident. Major Dalim and Major Noor were among the officers who lost their commissions over the charges of indiscipline.&lt;ref name="scds"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sarkar|first1=Ashutosh|title=Shahriar's confession|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/august-15-special-coverage/shahriars-confession-1269637|accessdate=10 August 2017|work=The Daily Star|date=19 November 2009|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, Major [[Syed Faruque Rahman]], had become dissatisfied with Bangladesh Awami League government. He would often discuss his dissatisfaction with Major General [[Ziaur Rahman]] who was the Deputy Chief of Army Staff.

'''Algerian Braille''' was a [[braille alphabet]] used to write the [[Arabic language]] in [[Algeria]]. It is apparently obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070605022316/http://www.sagma.ma/oapam-casa/arbraille.html Code braille arabe] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Algerian Braille, the braille letters are assigned in numeric order to the [[Arabic alphabet]]; standard [[Arabic Braille]] on the other hand uses a completely different assignment, following [[Unified international braille|international norms]] based on the order of the French alphabet. For example, the fifth braille letter, {{bc|e}}, is used in Algerian Braille for ج ''j'', the fifth letter of the Algerian/Arabic alphabet.  In most braille alphabets today, {{bc|e}} is used for ''e'', the fifth letter of the French/Latin alphabet, or for a letter that sounds like ''e'', no matter where it occurs in those alphabets.

Algerian-type remapping was common in early braille adaptations, but was largely abandoned in favor of mutually understandable standards beginning with the unification French, English, German, and Egyptian Braille on the original French order in 1878.&lt;ref name=Unesco&gt;{{cite web|title=World Braille Usage|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0008/000872/087242eb.pdf|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anti-Armenian sentiment''', also known as '''anti-Armenianism''' and '''Armenophobia''', is a diverse spectrum of negative feelings, dislikes, fears, aversion, derision and/or prejudice towards [[Armenians]], [[Armenia]], and [[Culture of Armenia|Armenian culture]]. Modern anti-Armenianism is usually expressed by opposition to the actions or existence of Armenia, aggressive [[Armenian Genocide denial|denial of the Armenian Genocide]] or belief in an Armenian [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] to fabricate history and manipulate public and political opinion for political gain.&lt;ref&gt;Black Garden, by Thomas De Waal (Aug 25, 2004), page 42&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Morgenthau336.jpg|thumb|300px|Of this photo, the United States ambassador wrote, "Scenes like this were common throughout the Armenian provinces, in the spring and summer months of 1915. Death in its several forms—massacre, [[starvation]], [[Fatigue (medical)|exhaustion]]—destroyed the larger part of the [[refugee]]s. The Turkish policy was that of [[genocide|extermination]] under the guise of [[deportation]]."]]

===Armenian Genocide and its denial===
Although it was possible for Armenians to achieve status and wealth in the [[Ottoman Empire]], as a community they were never accorded more than "second-class citizen" status and were regarded as fundamentally alien to the Muslim character of Ottoman society.&lt;ref&gt;Communal Violence: The Armenians and the Copts as Case Studies, by Margaret J. Wyszomirsky, World Politics, Vol. 27, No. 3 (Apr., 1975), p. 438&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, revolts among the Armenian subjects of the Ottoman Empire lead to [[Abdul Hamid II|Sultan Abdül Hamid]]'s decision to massacre tens of thousands of Armenians in the [[Hamidian massacres]].&lt;ref name = "Hamidia"&gt;[http://www.armenian-genocide.org/hamidian.html Hamidian Massacres], Armenian Genocide.&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]], the Ottoman government massacred between 1 and 1.5 million Armenians in the [[Armenian Genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;Levon Marashlian.

In the late 19th century and early 20th century anti-Armenian sentiment was prevalent in both socialist and nationalist Georgian circles. The economic dominance of [[Armenians in Tbilisi]] fueled verbal attacks on Armenians. ''[[Droeba]]'', an influential journal, described Armenians as people who "strip our streets and fatten their pockets" and "but the last piece of property from our indebted peasant families." Both [[Ilia Chavchavadze]] and [[Akaki Tsereteli]], two major literary figures, attacked Armenians for their perceived mercantilism. Tsereteli portrayed Armenians as a flea sucking Georgian blood in one fable. Chavchavadze denounced Armenians for "eating the bread baked by someone else or drinking that which is creating by another's sweat." Chavchavadze's newspaper, ''Iveria'', depicted Armenians as "sly moneylenders and unscrupulous traders," according to [[Stephen F. Jones]]. The [[Social Democratic Party of Georgia]] (Georgian Mensheviks) attacked the bourgeoisie and imperialism to liberate Georgia from both Russian imperialism and perceived Armenian economic exploitation. During the existence of the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] (1918–21), the independent Georgian government saw Armenians as a potential "[[fifth column]]" for their supposed loyalty to the [[First Republic of Armenia]] and subject to manipulation by foreign powers. The [[Georgian–Armenian War]] of December 1918 increased anti-Armenian sentiments in Georgia. In post-Soviet Georgia, first president [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]], an outspoken nationalist, viewed Armenians, along with other ethnic minorities, as "guests" or "aliens" who threaten Georgia's territorial integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Stephen F. |authorlink1=Stephen F.

There has been historic prejudice against Armenians in the United States throughout various times, at least beginning from the early 1900s.

In early 1900s Armenians were among the group of minorities who were barred from loaning money, land, and equipment particularly because of their race. They were referred to as "lower class Jews". Moreover, among other minorities Armenians lived on one side of Van Ness Blvd. while the residents of white origin lived on the other side. A deed from one home stated, "Neither said premises nor any part thereof shall be used in any matter whatsoever or occupied by any Negro, Chinese, Japanese, Hindu, Armenian, Asiatic or native of the Turkish Empire."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kvpr.org/post/diversity-fresno-how-racial-covenants-once-ruled-prestigious-neighborhoods|title=Diversity In Fresno: How Racial Covenants Once Ruled Prestigious Neighborhoods|author=Diana Aguilera|publisher=|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 24, 1998 during a campus exhibit organized by the [[Armenian Students' Association]] at UC Berkeley,  [[Hamid Algar]], a Professor of Islamic &amp; Persian Studies, reportedly approached a group of organizers and shouted, “It was not a genocide but I wish it was—you lying pigs!” The students also claimed that Algar also spit at them. Following the incident members of the Armenian Students' Association filed a report with campus police calling for an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asbarez.com/35569/berkeley-professor-spits-at-armenian-student/|title=Berkeley Professor Spits at Armenian Student|work=Asbarez.com|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a five-month investigation the Chancellor's office issued an apology, though no hate charges were filed as incident did not create a "hostile environment." &lt;ref name=asbarez&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asbarez.com/39065/uc-berkeley-senate-calls-on-prof-to-apologize/.|title=UC Berkeley Senate Calls On Prof. to Apologize|work=Asbarez.com|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 10, 1999 the Associated Students of University of California (ASUC) passed a resolution titled,  "A Bill Against Hate Speech and in Support of Reprimand for Prof. Algar," condemning the incident and calling for Chancellor to review the University decision not to file charges.&lt;ref name=asbarez /&gt;

In April 2007, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' Managing Editor [[Douglas Frantz]] blocked a story on the [[Armenian Genocide]] written by Mark Arax, allegedly citing the fact Arax was of Armenian descent and therefore had a biased opinion on the subject. Arax, who has published similar articles before,&lt;ref name="Roderick"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laobserved.com/archive/2007/04/armenian_genocide_dispute.php|title=Armenian genocide dispute erupts at LAT|work=LA Observed|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; has lodged a discrimination complaint and threatened a federal lawsuit. Frantz, who did not cite any specific factual errors in the article, is accused of having a bias obtained while being stationed in [[Istanbul]], Turkey. [[Harut Sassounian]], an Armenian community leader, accused Frantz of having expressed support for [[denial of the Armenian Genocide]] and has stated he personally believed that Armenians rebelled against the Ottoman Empire, an argument commonly used to justify the killings.&lt;ref name="Roderick"/&gt; Frantz resigned from the paper not long afterward, possibly due to the mounting requests for his dismissal from the Armenian community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anca.org/press_releases/press_releases.php?prid=1220|title=Genocide Controversy Leads L.A.

In March 2012 three of five Glendale Police Department's officers of  Armenian origin filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court against Glendale Police Department claiming racial discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/03/3-armenian-police-claim-discrimination-by-glendale-department-.html|title=3 Armenian police claim discrimination by Glendale department|publisher=|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 surgeon's assistant Ani Chopourian, a graduate of UCLA and Yale, was awarded $168 million in punitive damages for racial and gender discrimination by her co-workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/LegalCenter/168-million-awarded-woman-harassed-raunchy-cardiac-surgery/story?id=15835342|title=$168 Million Awarded to Woman Harassed in 'Raunchy' Cardiac Surgery Unit - ABC News|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juryverdictalert.com/jury-verdicts/item/employment/chopourian-v-catholic-healthcare-west|title=$167 million record verdict for wrongful termination of surgical aide at Catholic hospital.

Another incident that received less coverage was a series of [[hate mail]] campaigns directed at [[Paul Krekorian]], a city council candidate for [[California]]n [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Primary, making racist remarks and accusations that the Armenian community was engaging in [[voter fraud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anca.org/press_releases/press_releases.php?prid=959|title=Armenian Community Condemns Anti-Armenian Attacks During California Democratic Primary Election

On April 21, 2016 students at Clark Magnet High School, which currently has 60% Armenian student body,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www2.ed.gov/programs/nclbbrs/2006/profiles/clark-magnet.pdf |title=Clark Magnet High School |website=www2.ed.gov |accessdate=October 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote an open letter accusing the school administrators of cultural insensitivity. In the letter students explained that as a day of remembrance students wore black T-shirts. Because of Clark's collar dress code policy school staff browsed through classrooms and gave detention slips to students who wore black T-shirts. They also accused one of the teachers of shaming their actions, who "according to more than fifty Clarkies, one of the faculty members called the students' patriotic actions a "disgrace to America" and stated that she considers them to be "disrespectful to other Americans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@anonymous917/an-open-letter-from-clark-magnet-students-to-faculty-and-administration-39eac8b40288#.vkcv8vy0y|title=An Open Letter from Clark Magnet Students to Faculty and Administration|author=Clark Magnet Students|work=Medium|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[List of 2 Broke Girls episodes#Season 3 .282013.E2.80.9314.29|4th episode of Season 3]] of the [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[2 Broke Girls]]'' (aired on October 14, 2013) "when a new cappuccino maker is brought into the cupcake store by a co-worker, he says he bought it for a cheap price from a person who stole it but sells it at a profit, adding 'it's the Armenian way.' When the character is pressed that he is not Armenian, he says 'I know. But, it's the Armenian way.'" This scene was characterized as "racist" by ''[[Asbarez]]'' Editor Ara Khachatourian, who criticized CBS for promotion of racial stereotypes in their shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Khachatourian|first=Ara|title=CBS Network's Streak of Racism Continues|url=http://asbarez.com/115142/cbs-network%E2%80%99s-streak-of-racism-continues/|work=[[Asbarez]]|date=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the January 9, 2018 episode of the [[Comedy Central]] late-night program ''[[The Daily Show]]'' [[Trevor Noah]] stated: "This is, like, really funny. Only Donald Trump could defend himself and, in the same sentence, completely undermine his whole point.

In a joint press release the Armenian Bar Association and the Armenian Rights Watch Committee (ARWC) compared "Filthy Armenians" to racial epithets as "Dirty Jew" and "Lazy Nigger", which although "may have been intended to coax a laugh from the audience by ridiculing President Trump's self-proclaimed genius and tolerance," constitutes "affront and slander."

{{Wiktionary|beauf}}
'''''Beauf''''' [pronounced /bof/] is a [[French language|French]] term describing a man perceived as vulgar, unintelligent, arrogant, uncaring, misogynistic and [[chauvinist]]ic, without any taste for etiquette or good manners. A "beauf" will typically be prompt to jump to conclusions and have strong views on complex social issues, based on an insufficient analysis of the facts, but presented as being plain common sense.

French [[cartoonist]] [[Cabu]] was responsible for popularising the term, which is an abbreviation of "beau-frère" ([[brother-in-law]]) by creating a cartoon character of that name in [[Charlie Hebdo]] in the mid-1970s.  Singer [[Renaud Séchan|Renaud]] also released a song titled "Mon Beauf"  in 1981.  Cabu updated the character later in ''[[Le Canard Enchainé]]'' under the title "Les nouveaux beaufs".  The new version is a more urban and trendy version, with a ponytail instead of a bushy moustache. Nouveaux beaufs drive four-by-fours/[[SUV]]s, and are fans of [[plastic surgery]].

'''''Better Together: Restoring the American Community''''' is both a book and website published as an initiative of the Saguaro Seminar conducted at [[Harvard University]]'s [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]]. The initiative is aimed at facilitating rapid and extensive [[community development]], particularly within the United States and uses a book with the same title by [[Robert Putnam]] and [[Lewis M. Feldstein]] as its primary reference text.

==Saguaro Seminar==
The '''Saguaro Seminar''' is a long-term research project aimed at significantly increasing Americans' connectedness to one another and to community institutions. Professor Putnam, also the author of national best seller ''[[Bowling Alone]]'', leads the effort joined by Feldstein, other scholars, civic leaders, business people and politicians. The project's agenda includes building a knowledge base for understanding what creates and sustains civic trust, community participation and the bonds between people and their institutions. The seminar focuses on building [[social capital]] by conducting surveys and presenting initiatives for public engagement through the book and website.

The seminar's report, titled ''Better Together'' and issued in December 2000, called for a "nationwide campaign to redirect a downward spiral of civic apathy." The report warned that "[[social capital]]" in the US was dwindling to a critically low level and something needed to be done quickly to avoid civic catastrophe. The report further outlined a "framework for sustained, broad-based social change to restore America’s civic virtue" which culminated in both the book ''Better Together'' ({{ISBN|0-7432-3546-0}}) and the website BetterTogether.org.

'''Burmese Malays''' ({{lang-ms|Melayu Myanmar}}, [[Jawi alphabet|Jawi]]: ملايو ميانمار, {{lang-my|ပသျှူးလူမျိုး}}, ''Pashu''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesundaily.my/node/170244 Malays of Myanmar]&lt;/ref&gt;), primarily live in [[Tanintharyi Region]] in the southern part of Myanmar. 

The southernmost islands of the [[Mergui Archipelago]] (also Myeik Archipelago) is home to the [[Moken people]], a nomadic ethnic minority related to the Malays. There are also some dispersed Malay and Malay related Muslims from the northernmost states of Malaysia and Southern Thailand. Some of the Moken and the Muslims in these southernmost islands speak a dialect of [[Malay language|Malay]]. The Malays are believed to be of [[Kedahan Malay people|Kedahan Malay]] descent, although the ''[[Hikayat Merong Mahawangsa]]'' makes no mention whatsoever of the Mergui Archipelago.

In 1865, an Arab-Malay group led by Nayuda Ahmed, traveling and collecting sea products around Mergui Archipelago settled down in Victoria Point Bay, which is now located in modern-day [[Kawthaung]]. The Burmese Malays mainly live in [[Bokpyin Township]] and a few islands in the southern part of the Mergui Archipelago.

The Malay influence is clearly visible in the names of certain settlements near [[Kawthaung]] - the words ''Kampong'', ''Ulu'', ''Telok'', ''Tengah'' and ''Pulau'' (Malay words for village, remote, bay, central and island respectively) appear in a handful of settlement names. 

==Language, culture and religion==

The Malays living in Southern Burma are related to the [[Kedahan Malay]] and maintain strong kinship, cultural and economic links to the northwest coast of Peninsular Malaysia and Southern Thailand till today. They speak [[Burmese language|Burmese]] and [[Kedah Malay|Kedah-Perlis dialect]]. Due to the prevalence of Islamic religious schooling among the community, many of these Malays can also read the [[Jawi script]] which was the old Arabic-derived script used in the Malay Peninsula.

Most Malays are adherents of the [[Shafi'i]] ''[[madhab]]'' of Sunni Islam. Due to their historical presence and geographic location, some may have been assimilated into the dominant Mon and Bamar identities who practice Buddhism. The Mokens, although related to the Malays, have their own  [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] languages and a separate cultural, societal and religious identity.

The '''Citadel of Rada'a''' ({{lang-ar|قلعة رداع}}) is a historic castle in [[Yemen]], located in the center of [[Rada'a District]]. The citadel sits at the highest point of the district, and consisted the original part of the city of Rada'a.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12169">The term '''Consumer revolution''' refers to the period from approximately 1600 to 1750 in [[England]] in which there was a marked increase in the consumption and variety of "luxury" goods and products by individuals from different economic and social backgrounds. The consumer revolution marked a departure from the traditional mode of life that was dominated by frugality and scarcity to one of increasingly mass consumption in society.&lt;ref&gt;Fairchilds, Cissie.  “Review: Consumption in Early Modern Europe. A Review Article”. ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'', Vol. 35, No. 4. (Oct., 1993), pp. 851.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Consumerism]] has weak links with the [[Western world]], but is in fact an international phenomenon. People purchasing [[good (economics)|good]]s and consuming materials in excess of their basic needs is as old as the first [[civilization]]s (e.g. [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Babylon]] and [[Ancient Rome]]).

[[File:The Fable of the Bees (1705).jpg|left|thumb|[[Bernard Mandeville]]'s work ''[[The Fable of the Bees]]'', which justified conspicuous consumption.]]
The consumer society emerged in the late seventeenth century and intensified throughout the eighteenth century. Change was propelled by the growing middle-class who embraced new ideas about luxury consumption and the growing importance of fashion as an arbiter for purchasing rather than necessity. This revolution encompassed the growth in construction of vast country estates specifically designed to cater for comfort and the increased availability of luxury goods aimed at a growing market. This included [[sugar]], [[tobacco]], [[tea]] and [[coffee]]; these were increasingly grown on vast slave plantations in Caribbean colonies as demand steadily rose. In particular, sugar consumption in [[Great Britain|Britain]] during the course of the 18th century increased by a factor of 20.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.recercat.net/bitstream/handle/2072/41988/1163.pdf?sequence=1&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the expansion of trade and markets also contributed to the burgeoning consumer revolution, by increasing the variety of goods that could be made available to affluent society.

This pattern was particularly visible in [[London]] where the gentry and prosperous merchants took up residence and created a culture of luxury and consumption that was slowly extended across the socio-economic divide. Marketplaces expanded as shopping centres, such as the New Exchange, opened in 1609 by [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]] in the [[Strand, London|Strand]]. Shops started to become important as places for Londoners to meet and socialise and became popular destinations alongside the theatre. [[English Restoration|Restoration]] London also saw the growth of luxury buildings as advertisements for social position with speculative architects like [[Nicholas Barbon]] and [[Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex|Lionel Cranfield]].

There was growth in industries like glass making and silk manufacturing, and much pamphleteering of the time was devoted to justifying private vice for luxury goods for the greater public good. This then scandalous line of thought caused great controversy with the publication of [[Bernard Mandeville]]'s influential work ''[[The Fable of the Bees]]'' in 1714, in which he argued that a country's prosperity ultimately lay in the self-interest of the consumer.&lt;ref&gt;Peck, Linda, "Consuming Splendor: Society and Culture in Seventeenth-Century England", Cambridge Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Horse Frightened by a Lion by Josiah Wedgwood.jpg|thumb|right|Wedgwood pottery, featuring ''Horse Frightened by a Lion'' motif from [[George Stubbs]], 1780.]]
These trends were vastly accelerated in the 18th century, as rising prosperity and [[social mobility]] increased the number of people with disposable income for consumption. Important shifts included the marketing of goods for individuals as opposed to items for the household, and the new status of goods as [[status symbol]]s, related to changes in fashion and desired for aesthetic appeal, as opposed to just their utility.

The [[pottery]] inventor and [[entrepreneur]], [[Josiah Wedgwood]], noticed the way aristocratic fashions, themselves subject to periodic changes in direction, slowly filtered down through society. He pioneered the use of marketing techniques to influence and manipulate the direction of the prevailing tastes and preferences to cause his goods to be accepted among the aristocracy; it was only a matter of time before his goods were being rapidly bought up by the middle classes as well. His example was followed by other producers of a wide range of products and the spread and importance of consumption fashions became steadily more important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quarc.de/fileadmin/downloads/Coming%20to%20live%20in%20a%20consumer%20society%20%28chapter%202%29.pdf|title=Coming to live in a consumer society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Semi-Luxury and Imitation==

Popular culture drew aesthetic techniques, design, and technology from the goods England gathered from trade in Asia and the Mediterranean.  With the increased demand for Asian ceramics, European markets had difficulty supplying buyers so inventors started imitating Chinese porcelain. Porcelain remained popular for tableware and pottery, but the style, shape and decoration of the porcelain changed to fit more Western tastes, painting flowers and English scenes rather than Chinese ones.&lt;ref&gt;Berg, Maxine, "From imitation to invention: creating commodities in eighteenth-century Britain," Economic History Review, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Imitation goods were also used to disguise social class. Middle-class consumers could not afford the same exotic luxury goods brought back from overseas trade that the elite class used to distinguish their elevated rank. Markets and shops whose target buyers were middle-class consumers began creating "semi-luxury" goods that imitated actual luxury goods. These goods were part of a movement to create a "counterfeit culture" that gave middle-class consumers an opportunity to emulate the wealth and luxurious life that the elite class lived without paying as much. Household decorations, kitchenware, clothes, and transportation vehicles were all objects that could be used to crossover into "polite society."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Ross J. "'The mystical character of commodities:' ''Post-Medieval Archaeology'' Vol. 42, No. 1 (2008) pp. 144-156.&lt;/ref&gt;

England was concerned with the quantity products exported out of England in comparison to the countries they traded with. England did not want to be overcome economically by countries in Asia because they did not export as much so merchants, artisans, and shopkeepers started creating their own goods to compete with the Asian market.&lt;ref&gt;McCants, Anne C."Exotic Goods, Popular Consumption, and the Standard of Living: Thinking about Globalization in the Early Modern World," ''Journal of World History'' Vol. 18, No. 4 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;To avoid entirely copying Asian goods, English inventors imitated goods from other countries that also traded with Asia such as France, Holland, Switzerland, and Spain. The goal was not to mimic the exact product, but instead use the techniques that proved successful in other European imitations to create a superior product.&lt;ref&gt;Berg, Maxine, "From imitation to invention: creating commodities in eighteenth-century Britain," Economic History Review, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Imitation and semi-luxury goods were also popular because they showed the modernization of English production and manufacturing processes. Large-scale production required standardization, advanced mechanical replication, and an organized system of assembly. Substitutes for the indigenous materials used to create the original products were seen as a show of enlightened and advanced thinking. The imitation and innovation of semi-luxury goods was a testament to the potential the English had to impact the global economy, to be France, China and India in national exports.&lt;ref&gt;Berg, Maxine, "In Pursuit of Luxury: Global History and British Consumer Goods in the Eighteenth Century," Oxford University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Domestic violence in Chile''' (locally referred to as ''violencia intrafamiliar'') is a prevalent problem.&lt;ref name=ceballo&gt;Ceballo, R., Ramirez, C., Castillo, M., Caballero, G. A. and Lozoff, B. (2004), "Domestic Violence and Women's Mental Health in Chile". ''Psychology of Women Quarterly'', 28: 298–308. doi: 10.1111/j.1471-6402.2004.00147.x&lt;/ref&gt; [[Domestic violence]] describes violence by an intimate partner or other family members, regardless of the place the violence occurs.&lt;ref name=khan&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Khan, M.|date=2000|title=Domestic violence against women and girls|publisher=Unicef. Innocenti Research Centre|url=https://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/digest6e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extent ==
Violence against women is prevalent across all classes of [[Chile]]an society.&lt;ref name=culliton/&gt; As of the early 1990s, it was reported that domestic violence affects about fifty percent of the women in Chile.&lt;ref name=culliton&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Culliton|first1=K. M.|date=January 1994|title=Legal remedies for domestic violence in Chile &amp; the US--Cultural relativism, myths &amp; realities|journal=Case Western Reserve Journal of International Law|url=https://works.bepress.com/katherine_culliton/7/}}&lt;/ref&gt; All socioeconomic classes are affected by domestic violence, with some groups having higher rates of domestic violence than others. Consistent with these findings, a 2003 Chilean national survey indicated that 25–30% of [[Femicide|female homicides]] occur at home.&lt;ref name=aron&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Arón, A. M.|author2=Lorion, R. P.|date=2003|title=A case report of a community-based response to domestic violence in Chile|journal=[[American Journal of Community Psychology]]|volume=31|issue=6|pages=561-579|doi=10.1002/jcop.10069|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/15206629/31/6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2004 Chilean [[National Women's Service]] (SERNAM) study reported that 50 percent of married women had suffered spousal abuse, 34 percent reported having suffered [[physical abuse|physical violence]], and 16 percent reported [[psychological abuse]] (2007). Between January and November 2005, 76,000 cases of family violence were reported to the [[Carabineros de Chile|police]]; 67,913 were reported by women, 6,404 by men, and approximately 1,000 by children.&lt;ref name=rights&gt;Report on Human Rights Practices 2006: Chile. United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (March 6, 2007). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.&lt;/ref&gt;  Women are clearly the most likely to become victims of domestic violence, but other members of the household are also at risk for victimization.

==Nature of domestic violence==
Domestic violence can be physical, psychological, emotional, verbal, or [[Sexual abuse|sexual]].  Men or women may be the offender, but research indicates that women suffer disproportionately from abuse by their male partners.&lt;ref name=frost&gt;Frost, M. (1999), Health visitors’ perceptions of domestic violence: the private nature of the problem. Journal of Advanced Nursing, 30: 589–596. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2648.1999.01128.x&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout history, women have been viewed by society as subordinate to men, leaving them susceptible to abuse by their male partners.  Additionally, the home has been viewed as an essentially private institution, impeding [[Law of Chile|lawmakers]] from moving forward with policies against domestic violence.  With many choosing to look the other way when they learn of domestic violence, this problem persists and can be difficult to address.  It is a common idea that outsiders, specifically lawmakers, should not interfere with such private matters as violence in the home.  Growth of the [[Women in Chile|women's movement]] in Chile, as elsewhere, has helped raise awareness and created concern at an international level.&lt;ref name=frost/&gt;

==Contributing factors==

===Economic factors===
Among the contributing factors to domestic violence are household factors, community and societal factors, and individual factors.  Household factors include size, density and violence history.  Community and societal factors include [[Media violence research|media violence]], poverty level, crime rate, and environmental conditions.  Lastly, individual factors are [[Education in Chile|educational]] level, gender, age, and employment status.&lt;ref name=fruhling&gt;Fruhling, H. H., Tulchin, J. S., &amp; Golding , H. (2003). Crime and violence in Latin America: Citizen security, democracy and the state. Woodrow Wilson Center Press Series Crime and Violence in Latin America .&lt;/ref&gt; A 1999 study conducted by psychologists found that violence is a learned behavior and is passed down through generations.  Exposure to violence in early childhood increases the risk for an individual to become violent in their own home.&lt;ref name=walker&gt;Walker, L. E. (1999). Psychology and domestic violence around the world. American Psychologist, 54, 21-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, 44% of the Chilean population was living in poverty, and studies have shown that low socioeconomic status and stressful life events are positively correlated with domestic violence.  Additionally, a 2003 study found that poverty, and escalation of negative life events that typically accompany poverty, increase Chilean women’s vulnerability to domestic abuse.&lt;ref name=ceballo/&gt; So, while domestic violence occurs in all classes, it is more prevalent among poor households.  In Chile, it has been found that families who experience domestic violence are usually isolated and lack supportive ties among the communities in which they live.&lt;ref name=aron/&gt;

The geographic concentration of poverty in Chile, with regard to the socioeconomic opportunities and risk behaviors of marginalized families living in disadvantaged neighborhoods, has been linked to higher rates of domestic violence.&lt;ref name=kim&gt;Kim, H., Grogan-Kaylor, A., Han, Y., Maurizi, L., &amp; Delva, J. (2012). The Association of Neighborhood Characteristics and Domestic Violence in Santiago, Chile. Journal of Urban Health, 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt; In other parts of the world, there is some recent evidence to support reduced violence in cases where women own assets.  Owning land or a house signifies a woman's option to exit a violent relationship and deters marital violence.&lt;ref name=panda&gt;Panda, P., &amp; Agarwal, B. (2005). Marital violence, human development and women’s property status in India. World Development, 33(5), 823-850.&lt;/ref&gt; In Chile, married women and men have equal rights to their assets upon divorce or if a spouse dies.&lt;ref name=worldbank&gt;"Women, business, and the law: creating economic opportunity for women". The World Bank. 2011. Retrieved 18 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In rural Chile, inheritance is the principle way in which land is acquired by both men and women, whether the land has titles or not. Sometimes women cannot claim their inheritance to land without titles because the cost of legal documents is too high.&lt;ref name=worldbank/&gt; The same effects on domestic violence have not been seen by female employment alone, since owning a home or land offers an immediate escape option.  Land ownership can be empowering for women, a factor that, on its own, has been shown to reduce domestic violence.&lt;ref name=panda/&gt; As these factors [[Intersectionality|intersect]], the risk for women is compounded and they become more susceptible to domestic violence.

===Cultural factors===
Until 1989, the Civil Code of Chile legally sanctioned husbands’ ownership and authority over their wives,&lt;ref name=ceballo/&gt;  giving men power over their female partners and leading to abuse within the home.  This power dynamic created by cultural beliefs can be seen around the world and is not isolated to Chile.  The belief that [[Women in Chile|Chilean women]] are more tolerant of male violence than other women has hindered [[Politics of Chile|policymakers]] from moving forward against domestic violence.&lt;ref name=culliton/&gt;   This belief leaves Chilean women unprotected and trapped within abusive homes.  Because events occurring in the home have been viewed as private family matters, historically, domestic violence has been socially and culturally accepted in Chilean society.&lt;ref name=aron/&gt; 

The secrecy that has protected these offenders is exemplified by research results from 2004 that reported that 30% of women from the [[Santiago Metropolitan Region|Region de la Metropolitana]] and 21% of women from the [[Araucanía Region|Region de la Araucania]] had not told anyone about their experiences with domestic abuse.&lt;ref name=ceballo/&gt;  The combination of these beliefs has allowed [[Culture of Chile|Chilean society]] to turn a blind eye to the domestic violence problem that plagues their communities.  These myths are slowly coming to light as attitudes change and a movement against domestic violence has begun among [[Women in Chile|Chilean women]].&lt;ref name=culliton/&gt;

==Economic impacts==
Domestic violence impacts the [[Economy of Chile|Chilean economy]] directly and indirectly.  Chile has low levels of female labor force participation.  A 2011 study found that while about 75% of U.S. women are engaged in paid employment, 43% of women in Chile are engaged in paid employment.&lt;ref name=torche&gt;Torche, F.(2010). Educational Assortative Mating and Economic Inequality: A Comparative Analysis of Three Latin American Countries. Demography 47(2), 481-502. Population Association of America. Retrieved April 13, 2013, from Project MUSE database.&lt;/ref&gt;  More sick days are taken by battered partners, decreased household productivity, and increased healthcare costs.  Increased healthcare costs are attributed to emergency room visits, mental health services, medication, and physical therapy (2011) .&lt;ref name=community&gt;Community costs of domestic violence. (2011, July 19). Retrieved from http://www.stopvaw.org/community_costs_of_domestic_violence&lt;/ref&gt;  Criminal justice and social services costs increase with high rates of domestic violence, but studies have found that programs aimed at intervening in or preventing domestic violence are highly cost-effective.&lt;ref name=day&gt;Day, McKenna, and Bowlus, The Economic Costs of Violence against Women, 14, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct impacts===
The economy of Chile is impacted by domestic violence in several ways.  These costs include increased expenditures on [[Healthcare in Chile|medical]] treatment, police services, criminal justice system, and social services.&lt;ref name=khan/&gt;  Injury from abuse leads to more emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref name=khan/&gt;  More time is spent by law enforcement responding to domestic violence calls, and criminal justice system costs are increased due to domestic violence court cases, which can lead, in turn, to [[Prisons in Chile|prison]] costs.&lt;ref name=khan/&gt;

===Indirect impacts===
With increased domestic violence rates, earnings are lower, productivity at work decreases, and labor market participation declines.&lt;ref name=khan/&gt;   A 1999 study conducted in Santiago, Chile, found that abused women were less likely to work outside the home.&lt;ref name=morrison&gt;Morrison, A. R., &amp; Orlando, M. B. (1999). Social and [[Economy of Chile|economic costs]] of domestic violence: Chile and [[Nicaragua]]. Too close to home: domestic violence in the Americas .&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study based in [[Santiago]], conducted in 2000, estimated that women who did not suffer physical violence earned an average of US$385 per month while women who faced physical violence at home earned only US$150 per month.&lt;ref name=khan/&gt;  This study displays the severe economic effects of domestic violence in the home.

==Policy responses==
===Background===
The [[Politics of Chile|Chilean legal system]] has traditionally been very weak on family violence, due to structural problems, resulting from the failure to label domestic violence as a crime and the failure to prosecute domestic violence under general assault statutes.&lt;ref name=culliton/&gt;  A study conducted in 1990 in Chile showed that 83.3% of battered women’s injuries were classified as ‘light injuries’ and were only punishable as a misdemeanor.  Acts of violence that would otherwise be severe crimes under the law, when occurring within the home were passed as ‘light injuries’ and minimal punishment was pursued.&lt;ref name=culliton/&gt; 

===Chilean National Ministry for Women (SERNAM)===
The [[National Women's Service|Chilean National Ministry for Women]] (SERNAM, Servicio Nacional de la Mujer) addresses the Chilean legal systems’ treatment of domestic violence cases.&lt;ref name=culliton/&gt;  SERNAM is responsible for developing preventative and remedial programs.  They have opened offices across the country, providing legal and therapeutic assistance for victims of domestic violence.&lt;ref name=aron/&gt;

In 1997 SERNAM issued a detailed set of policy proposals to assure rural women equality of opportunity, a product of consultative process.&lt;ref name=deere&gt;Empowering Women: Land and Property Rights in Latin America. By Carmen Diana Deere and Magdalena Leon. Pittsburgh: The University of Pittsburgh Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Michelle Bachelet was the first female president of Chile, leading the country between 2006 and 2010. During her presidency, Bachelet increased the budget of the National Women's Service (SERNAM) and helped the institution gain funding from the United Nations Development Fund for Women.&lt;ref name=haas&gt;Haas, Liesl (2010). Feminist Policymaking in Chile. University Park, Pennsylvania: The Pennsylvania State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2006, there were 29 government and private centers to attend to victims of intrafamily violence. During 2006, the SERNAM partnered with NGOs to conduct courses on the legal, medical, and psychological aspects of domestic violence for police officers and judicial and municipal authorities.&lt;ref name=rights/&gt;  This intensive training program by SERNAM has increasingly allowed many Chilean police to provide effective assistance in domestic violence cases.&lt;ref name=culliton/&gt; SERNAM has been active in advancing the domestic violence legislation (see below).

===Domestic violence law of 1994===
The Intrafamily Violence Law passed in 1994 was the first political measure to address violence in the home, but because the law would not pass without being accepted by both sides, the law was weak in the way it addressed victim protection and punishment for abusers.&lt;ref name="haas"/&gt; The law was later reformed in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cepal.org/oig/doc/Chi200520066ModificaLeyVIF1994.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical personnel===
Another barrier is posed by the Chilean medical personnel, which has been criticized for continuing to mistreat victims of domestic violence and to minimize injuries, even though today  they are required by law to report known cases of physical assault to the criminal justice system.&lt;ref name=culliton/&gt;

[[Image:Florentine Codex IX Aztec Warriors.jpg|thumb|An Eagle warrior (left) depicted holding a [[macuahuitl]] in the [[Florentine Codex]]]]
'''Eagle warriors''' or '''eagle knights''' ([[Classical Nahuatl]]: ''cuāuhtli'' {{IPA-nah|ˈkʷaːwtɬi|}} (singular)&lt;ref name="dic" /&gt; or  ''cuāuhmeh'' {{IPA-nah|ˈkʷaːwmeʔ|}} ([[plural]])&lt;ref name="dic"&gt;''Nahuatl Dictionary.'' (1997). Wired Humanities Project. University of Oregon. Retrieved September 5, 2012, from [http://whp.uoregon.edu/dictionaries/nahuatl/index.lasso link]&lt;/ref&gt;) were a special class of [[infantry]] [[soldier]] in the [[Aztec warfare|Aztec army]], one of the two leading military [[special forces]] orders in [[Aztec]] society. They were a type of Aztec warrior called a ''cuāuhocēlōtl'' {{IPA-nah|kʷaːwoˈseːloːt͡ɬ|}}.&lt;ref name="Sanchez" /&gt; The word ''cuāuhocēlōtl'' derives from the eagle warrior ''cuāuhtli'' and the [[jaguar warrior]] ''ocēlōtl'' {{IPA-nah|oˈseːloːt͡ɬ|}}.&lt;ref name="Sanchez"&gt;Sánchez-Murillo, R. (2012). La palabra universal. ''Ricardo Sánchez-Murillo.'' Retrieved September 5, 2012, from [http://ricardosm.com/2012/03/21/la-palabra-del-universo/ link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029184954/http://ricardosm.com/2012/03/21/la-palabra-del-universo/ |date=2013-10-29 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; These military orders were made up of the bravest soldiers of noble birth and those who had taken the greatest number of prisoners in battle. Of all of the Aztec warriors, they were the most feared. Eagle warriors, along with the [[jaguar warrior]]s, were the only such classes which did not restrict access solely to the nobility, as commoners or, in [[Nahuatl]], "''mācēhualli''" {{IPA-nah|maːseːwalːi||-|macehualli.ogg}} were occasionally admitted for special merit. The eagles were soldiers of the Sun, for the eagle was the symbol of the Sun. Eagle warriors dressed like eagles, adorning themselves with eagle feathers, and wearing headgear with an eagle head on it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancient-origins.net/history/infamous-eagle-warriors-elite-infantrymen-aztec-empire-005994&lt;/ref&gt;

The life of Aztec warriors was one of constant battle, as the primary purpose for this continual warfare was to take prisoners to be sacrificed to their gods. As the Aztec Empire expanded, however, the expansion of the empire in size and power became increasingly important.

In current culture, the eagle warrior is a representation of the [[Aztec]] culture, and therefore the [[Mexican people|Mexican]] tradition. Some companies use the eagle warrior as a symbol that denotes strength, aggressiveness, competitiveness, and remembrance of the ancient cultures of [[Mexico]]. [[AeroMexico]]'s logo, for instance, shows a ''cuāuhtli''.

==Education==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
All Aztec boys, both free commoners and nobility, learned about weaponry and warfare as part of their basic education. Until the age of fourteen, the education of children was in the hands of their parents, but was supervised by the authorities of their ''[[calpulli]]''. Periodically, they attended their local temples, which tested their progress. However, only the best students could progress to become eagle warriors, as they are considered as one of the nobility in Aztec society. The empire was split in pieces: kings (thought to be gods), nobles, generals, priests, peasants, and finally slaves. Pre-Columbian Aztec society was a highly complex and stratified society that developed among the Aztecs of central Mexico in the centuries prior to the Spanish conquest of Mexico, and which was built on the cultural foundations of the larger region of Mesoamerica. Politically, the society was based around the independent city-state, called an ''altepetl'', composed of smaller divisions (''calpulli''), which were again usually composed of one or more extended kinship groups. Socially, the society depended on a rather strict division between nobles and free commoners, both of which were themselves divided into elaborate hierarchies of social status, responsibilities, and power. Economically the society was dependent on agriculture, and also to a large extent on warfare. Other economically important factors were commerce, long distance and local, and a high degree of trade specialisation.

==Rite of passage==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
At the age of 17, young Aztec men became warriors and entered formal military training. The recruits were expected to be brave and noble. Those who were of noble lineage also received training in religion, politics, or history by the priests. To achieve adult status, a young man had to capture his first [[Prisoner of war|prisoner]].

Aztec warriors could move up in ranking by capturing enemies. After having done 20 or more great deeds (such as capturing foes to be used as sacrifices), they were eligible to become either a jaguar or eagle warrior.

==Weaponry and battledress==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
The warriors used a number of weapons, including an ''[[atlatl]]'', [[spear]]s and [[dagger]]s. The Aztec blades ([[macuahuitl]]) were made by setting [[obsidian]] within wood. Firestones were flung at enemies using slings made of wool.  Most Aztec weapons were intended to stun and capture opponents rather than to kill them.

The uniforms of eagle warriors signified both courage on the battlefield and physical strength. The [[Aztecs]] wore a lightweight close-fitting [[breastplate]] which suited the [[Mesoamerica]]n climate.  Their shields were brightly coloured and decorated with feathers. A warrior's legs would be covered with leather strips, an archaic version of [[greave]]s or [[shin guards]].  As headgear, eagle warriors wore the heads of eagles, including an open beak, and used eagle feathers as adornments.

Their slings were likely made from [[maguey]] fiber, either a type of [[ixtle]] from one of the agave type maguey plants such as [[henequen]] (''Agave fourdes'').

==Eagle warriors in society==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
Eagle and [[jaguar warriors]] were two of the only types of warriors who were recognised as having a full-time professional capacity. Thanks to their elite training and education, they were leaders and commanders both on and off the battlefield. On reaching this rank they were peers of nobles and other elite members of Aztec society, therefore the warrior's path was a way to raise one's social status in Aztec culture guaranteeing many of the same privileges as nobles. The graduate warrior was allowed to drink ''[[pulque]]'', keep [[concubine]]s, and dine at the royal palace. At a civic level, They would also become full-time warriors working for the city-state to protect merchants and policing the city itself. Accordingly, they were the civil or police force of Aztec society. As well, Jaguar warriors would also be used in gladiatorial sacrifices. Due to these corps, the Aztecs were able to defeat the Spanish in [[La Noche Triste]].

==Eagle Warrior Temple==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
[[File:Zona arqueológica de Cuauhtinchán, templo Cuauhcalli ('Casa del sol' o 'Casa de las águilas'), interior.JPG|thumb|200x200px|The entrance into the inner chamber of the Eagle Warriors Temple in Malinalco]]
The Eagle Warrior Temple is located in Malinalco. The temple sits upon a hill and is completely carved out of bedrock. The temple is a circular structure with an entrance containing 13 steps, and includes two jaguar sculptures. The entrance to the temple was a carved open mouth of an Aztec earth monster.

The temple has a long extended bench that covers half of its inner chamber. There are carved sculptures on the bench of eagles and a jaguar. In the center of the inner chamber there is a giant carved eagle on the floor. Some believe the centre eagle would be used as an altar or throne. Surrounding buildings around Malinalco contained several murals depicting the life of a warrior. In additions there were murals of dancing eagles and jaguars within structures in Malinalco.

The {{lang|eu|'''Euskal Oiloa'''|italic=no}}, {{lang-es|'''Gallina Vasca'''|italic=no}}, is a [[list of chicken breeds|breed]] of domestic [[chicken]] from the [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] in north-eastern Spain and south-western France. It is the traditional rural chicken of the area, a rustic dual-purpose breed of Atlantic type, and differs from Mediterranean Spanish breeds such as the [[Castellana Negra]] and the [[Minorca (chicken)|Minorca]] in several respects: it has yellow legs and feet, red earlobes, and lays brown eggs.{{r|guia}}

==History==

The Euskal Oiloa is the traditional chicken of the Basque rural economy. It was distributed throughout the historical territories of [[Álava|Araba]], [[Bizkaia]] and [[Gipuzkoa]], and gave both meat and brown eggs. In the twentieth century it was at first not threatened by imported commercial hybrid layer chickens and the spread of [[battery farming|highly intensive chicken farming]] methods, as breeds such as the [[Leghorn (chicken)|Leghorn]] laid white eggs, while Basque consumers preferred brown. Later, when brown-egg commercial hybrids appeared, they began to displace the traditional breed in many households.

Selective breeding of the Euskal Oiloa was begun in 1975 as part of the conservation programme for indigenous chicken breeds of the [[Instituto Nacional de Investigación y Tecnología Agraria y Alimentaria]], the national public agrarian research institute.{{r|inia}} The decision to seek official breed status for these birds was taken at that time.{{r|orozco}} A [[breed association]], the Asociación de Criadores de Razas Aviares Vascas or EOALAK, was founded in 2006.{{r|eoalak}}

The breed standard of the Euskal Oiloa was officially approved on 15 March 2001.{{r|boletin}} It is included in the official list of indigenous Spanish breeds in the [[royal decree]] of 26 December 2008, which established the national livestock breed conservation programme, where it is listed among the indigenous breeds at risk of extinction.{{r|decreto}} At the end of 2013 a population of 10,872 birds was reported, all from the País Vasco.{{r|mapa}}

== Characteristics ==

The Euskal Oiloa is a medium-heavy breed: cocks weigh about {{nobreak|3.6 kg}}, hens about {{nobreak|2.5 kg}}.{{r|guia}} The [[comb (anatomy)|comb]] is single, with five to seven well-defined points. The comb, face, [[wattle (anatomy)|wattles]] and earlobes are red; the earlobes are narrow and pointed. The beak is curved in the cock, less so in the hen. The legs, feet and skin are yellow.{{r|boletin}}

Five colour varieties are recognized: Beltza (black), Gorria (red), Lepasoila ([[naked-necked]], red-brown), Marraduna (golden cuckoo) and Zilarra (black-tailed white). The Lepasoila, like other naked-necked chickens, has red skin on the neck.{{r|boletin|slow}}

==Use==

Euskal Oiloa hens lay 209–220 brown eggs{{r|slow}} weighing about {{nobreak|60 g}} per year.{{r|boletin}} Much of the meat production is in the form of [[capon]]s; chemical castration is not used. In 2008 the Euskal Oiloa was added to the [[Slow Food]] [[Ark of Taste]].{{r|eoalak|slow}}

[[Image:Felucca R02.jpg|thumb|right|Felucca on the Nile at [[Luxor]]]]
A '''felucca''' ({{lang-ar|فلوكة}}, possibly originally from Greek ''ἐφόλκιον'' (Epholkion)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=El Houssi|first1=Abdelmajid|last2=Foscari|first2=Ca’|title=Retour sur l’étymologie de felouque|date=|page=20|url=http://www.selefa.asso.fr/files_pdf/AcBul09T05.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a traditional wooden sailing [[boat]] used in protected waters of the [[Red Sea]] and eastern [[Mediterranean]], in [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]] (particularly along the [[Nile]]), including [[Malta]] and [[Tunisia]], and also in [[Iraq]]. Its [[rigging|rig]] consists of one or two [[lateen]] [[sail]]s.

They are usually able to board ten passengers and the crew consists of two or three people. 

==Egypt==
Despite the availability of [[motorboat]]s and [[ferry|ferries]], feluccas are still in active use as a means of transport in Nile-adjacent cities like [[Aswan]] or [[Luxor]]. They are especially popular among tourists who can enjoy a quieter and calmer mood than motorboats have to offer.

A large fleet of lateen-rigged feluccas thronged [[San Francisco|San Francisco's]] docks before and after the construction of the state-owned [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco, California|Fisherman's Wharf]] in 1884.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Light, small, and maneuverable, the feluccas were the mainstay of the fishing fleet of [[San Francisco Bay]]. [[John Muir]] said of them, "These workhorses featured a mast that angled, or raked, forward sharply, and a large triangular sail hanging down from a long, two-piece yard".

{{Libertarianism sidebar |Concepts}}

'''Free-market environmentalism''' argues that the [[free market]], [[property rights]], and [[tort|tort law]] provide the best means of preserving the [[Natural environment|environment]], internalizing pollution costs, and [[conservation movement|conserving]] resources.

Free-market environmentalists therefore argue that the best way to protect the environment is to clarify and protect property rights. This allows parties to negotiate improvements in environmental quality.  It also allows them to use torts to stop environmental harm.  If affected parties can compel polluters to compensate them they will reduce or eliminate the [[externality]]. Market proponents advocate changes to the legal system that empower affected parties to obtain such compensation. They further claim that governments have limited affected parties' ability to do so by complicating the tort system to benefit producers over others.

==Tenets==
While environmental problems may be viewed as [[market failure]]s, free market environmentalists argue that environmental problems arise because:

# The state encodes, provides and enforces laws which override or obscure property rights and thus fail to protect them adequately.
# Given the technological and legal context in which people operate, transaction costs are too high to allow parties to negotiate to a solution better for the environment.
# Laws governing class or individual tort claims provide polluters with immunity from tort claims, or interfere with those claims in such a way as to make it difficult to legally sustain them.

Though many environmentalists blame markets for many of today's environmental problems, free-market environmentalists blame many of these problems on distortions of the market and the lack of markets. Government actions are blamed for a number of environmental detriments. 
*[[Tragedy of the Commons]] is seen as a fundamental problem for the environment. When land is held in common, anybody may use it. Since resources are consumable, this creates the incentive for entrepreneurs to use common resources before somebody else does. Many environmental resources are held by the government or in common, such as air, water, forests. The problem with regulation is that it puts property into a political commons, where individuals try to appropriate public resources for their own gain, a phenomenon called [[rent-seeking]]. 
*Tenure - Renters do not benefit from value accrued during their tenure and thus face an incentive to extract as much value as possible without conservation. 
*Political Allocation - Political information does not have the incentives that markets do to seek superior information (profit and loss). Though many participants provide input to governments, they can only make one decision. This means that governments create rules that are not well crafted for local situations. The government's strategy is that of anticipation, to hide from danger through regulations. A healthier society would use resilience, facing and overcoming risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stroup|authorlink1=Chemophobia and Activist Environmental Antidotes|editor1-last=Block|editor1-first=Walter|title=Economics and the Environment|date=1990|publisher=the Fraser Institute|location=Canada|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Perverse Subsidies - Governments offer [[cross subsidization|cross subsidies]] that distort [[price system]]s.  This means that underconsumers and overconsumers are paying the same rates, so the underconsumer is overpaying and the overconsumer is underpaying. The incentive leads to more overconsumers and fewer underconsumers.
*Increased Transaction Costs - Governments may create rules that make it difficult to transfer rights in ways that benefit the environment.  For example, in the US West, many states have laws over water rights that make it difficult for environmental groups to purchase in-stream flows from farmers.

==Market tools==
Markets are not perfect, and free-market environmentalists assert that market-based solutions will have their mistakes. Through strong feedback mechanisms such as risk, profit and loss, market-driven have strong incentives to learn from mistakes.

*Individual choice - Consumers have the incentive to maximize their satisfaction and try to find low cost, high value options. Markets allocate resources to the highest bidder. Producers make purchases on behalf of the consumer. Due to many actors in the market, there is no one-size-fits-all solution and entrepreneurs will seek to fulfill many values of society, including conservation. 
*[[Entrepreneurship]] - Entrepreneurs seek value, problem-solve, and coordinate resources. 
*Price system -  When resources become scarce, prices rise. Rising prices incentivize entrepreneurs to find substitutions for these resources. These resources are often conserved. E.g. as prices for coal rise, consumers will use less and higher prices will drive substitution for different energy sources. 
*[[Property rights]] - Owners face a strong incentive to take care of and protect their property. They must decide how much to use today and how much to use tomorrow. Everybody is trying to grow value. Corporate value and share price is based on their anticipated future profits. Owners with the possibility of transferring their property, either to an heir or through sale want their property to grow in value. Property rights encourage conservation and defend resources against depletion, since there is a strong incentive to maximize the value of the resource for the future. 
*[[Common law]] - In order to have working property rights, you need a good system to defend them. When rights are weak, people will violate them. By creating a strong system, where common resources can be [[homestead principle|homesteaded]], transferred, and defended against harm, resources can be protected, managed, allocated with the results that aggregate and balance humanity's needs and wants.

The market is a non-political allocation device. Many environmentalists proposals call to return resources from markets to become political problems.

==Issues==

===Coasian bargaining===

Some [[economists]] argue that, if industries internalized the costs of negative externalities, they would face an incentive to reduce them, perhaps even becoming enthusiastic about taking advantage of opportunities to improve profitability through lower costs.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, T L &amp; Leal, D R (2001) ''Free-market environmentalism'', 2nd ed&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, economists claim this would lead to the optimal balance between the marginal benefits of pursuing an activity and the marginal cost of its environmental consequences. One well-known means of internalizing a negative consequence is to establish a [[property right]] over some phenomenon formerly in the public domain.

The [[Coase theorem]] is one extreme version of this logic.  If property rights are well defined and if there are no transaction costs, then market participants can negotiate to a solution that internalizes the externality.  Moreover, this solution will not depend on who is allocated the property right.  For example, a paper mill and a resort might be on the same lake.  Suppose the benefits to the resort of a clean lake outweigh the benefits to the mill of being able to pollute.  If the mill has the right to pollute, the resort will pay it not to.  If the resort has the right to a pollution-free lake, it will keep that right, as the mill will be unable to compensate it for its pollution.  However, critics have charged that the "theorem" attributed to Coase is of extremely limited practicability because of its assumptions, including no transaction costs, and is ill-suited to real world externalities which have high bargaining costs due to many factors.&lt;ref name="Mamlyuk"&gt;{{Cite journal|ssrn=1679245|author=Mamlyuk, Boris|title=Analyzing the Polluter Pays Principle Through Law and Economics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, free-market environmentalists argue that transaction costs "count" as real costs.  If the cost of re-allocating property rights exceeds the benefits of doing so, then it is actually optimal to stay in the status quo.  This means the initial allocation of property rights is not neutral and also that it has important implications for efficiency.  Nevertheless, given the existing property rights regime, costly changes to it are not necessarily efficient, even if in hindsight an alternative regime would have been better.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Terry L., and Peter J. Hill. "Privatizing the commons: An improvement?." ''Southern Economic Journal'' (1983): 438-450.&lt;/ref&gt;  But if there are opportunities for property rights to evolve, entrepreneurs can find them to create new wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Demsetz, Harold.  "Toward a Theory of Property Rights."  ''American Economic Review'' 57.2 (1967): 347-359.

Anderson, Terry L., and Peter J. Hill. "The evolution of property rights: a study of the American West." ''The Journal of Law &amp; Economics'' 18.1 (1975): 163-179.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geolibertarianism===

Libertarian [[Georgism|Georgists]] (or [[Geolibertarianism|Geolibertarians]]) maintain a strong essential commitment to free markets but reject the Coasian solution in favor of [[land value tax]]ation, wherein the [[economic rent]] of land is collected by the community and either equally distributed to adult residents in the form of universal [[basic income]], called the ''[[Citizen's Dividend]]'', or used to fund necessary functions of a [[minarchism|minimal government]]. Under the LVT system, only landholders are taxed and on the basis of the market value of [[land (economics)|the earth]] in its unimproved state, that is to say, apart from the value of any structures or products of human labor. Geolibertarians regard the LVT as just compensation for a legal [[land registration|land title]] granting exclusive access to that which logically precedes and generates [[capitalism|private capital]], whose [[price elasticity of supply|supply is inelastic]], which properly belongs to all, and to which all have an equal right because it is vital to human existence and economic activity—the ground itself—and thus consider land [[value capture]] both morally imperative and a natural source of revenue.

Taxation of land values has been advocated by many classical economists and theorists of [[classical liberalism]], but this approach was popularized as the ''[[Single Tax]]'' by [[political economy|political economist]] and public intellectual [[Henry George]] in the late 19th century. Geolibertarians generally also support [[Pigouvian tax]]es on pollution and fees as compensation for natural resource extraction, [[negative externalities]] which adversely affect land values in particular.  Many argue the monopolization of land promotes idle [[speculation|land speculation]], [[real estate bubble]]s, [[urban sprawl]] and artificially severe [[wealth inequality]], while violating the [[Lockean proviso]] and denying others rightful access to the earth.&lt;ref name="Estlund2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Estlund|title=The Oxford Handbook of Political Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xb3qUZ3ME7gC|date=19 July 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-537669-2|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anarcho-capitalism===

[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbardian]] [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] also reject the proposed Coasian solution as making invalid assumptions about the purely subjective notion of costs being measurable in monetary terms, and also of making unexamined and invalid value judgments (i.e., ethical judgments). ([https://web.archive.org/web/20110911075448/http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj2n1/cj2n1-2.pdf] &lt;small&gt;PDF&lt;/small&gt;) The Rothbardians' solution is to recognize individuals' [[John Locke|Lockean]] property rights, of which the Rothbardians maintain that ''Wertfreiheit'' (i.e., value-free) economic analysis demonstrates that this arrangement necessarily maximizes social utility. ([https://www.mises.org/rothbard/toward.pdf] &lt;small&gt;PDF&lt;/small&gt;)

Murray Rothbard himself believed the term "free-market environmentalism" to be oxymoronic. On his view the unimproved natural environment, undeveloped and unowned, can in no sense be considered property until it is transformed via [[homesteading principle|Lockean homesteading]]. Unlike geolibertarians and many classical liberals, however, Rothbard emphatically rejected [[Lockean proviso|Locke's proviso]] as inconsistent with his theory of property acquisition. Against environmentalism Rothbard said: "The problem is that environmentalists are not interested in efficiency or preserving private property....The environmentalists are acolytes and prisoners of a monstrous literally anti-human philosophy. They despise and condemn the human race, which by its very nature and in contrast to other creatures, changes and transforms the environment instead of being passively subjected to it....I have come to the conclusion that a 'free-market environmentalist' is an oxymoron. Scratch one and you get...an environmentalist."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unz.org/Pub/RothbardRockwellReport-1990sep-00005&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Markets and ecosystems as spontaneous orders ===
Recent arguments in the academic literature have used [[Friedrich Hayek]]'s concept of a [[spontaneous order]] to defend a broadly [[non-interventionist]] [[environmental policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Ecosystems as Spontaneous Orders|ssrn = 2501745|date = 2014-09-24|location = Rochester, NY|first = Andy|last = Lamey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayek originally used the concept of a spontaneous order to argue against government intervention in the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hayek, The Use of Knowledge in Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the market, ecosystems contain complex [[information network|networks of information]], involve an ongoing dynamic process, contain orders within orders, and the entire system operates without being directed by a conscious mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Ecosystems as Spontaneous Orders|ssrn = 2501745|date = 2014-09-24|location = Rochester, NY|first = Andy|last = Lamey|pages = 6–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On this analysis, species takes the place of price as a visible element of the system formed by a complex set of largely unknowable elements. Human ignorance about the countless interactions between the organisms of an ecosystem limits our ability to manipulate nature.  Since humans rely on the ecosystem to sustain themselves, it is argued that we have an obligation to not disrupt such systems. This analysis of ecosystems as spontaneous orders does not rely on markets qualifying as spontaneous orders. As such, one need not endorse Hayek's analysis of markets to endorse ecosystems as spontaneous orders.

===Others===

Proponents of free-market environmentalism use the example of the recent destruction of the once prosperous [[Grand Banks]] fishery off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].  Once one of the world's most abundant fisheries, it has been almost completely depleted of fish. Those primarily responsible were large "factory-fishing" enterprises driven by the imperative to realize profits in a competitive global market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emagazine.com/view/?507 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511101006/http://www.emagazine.com/view/?507 |archivedate=2009-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is contended that if the fishery had been owned by a single entity, the owner would have had an interest in keeping a renewable supply of fish to maintain profits over the long term.  The owner would thus have charged high fees to fish in the area, sharply reducing how many fish were caught.  The owner also would have closely enforced rules on not catching young fish. Instead commercial ships from around the world raced to get the fish out of the water before competitors could, including catching fish that had not yet reproduced.

Another example is in the 19th century early gold miners in California developed a trade in rights to draw from water courses based on the doctrine of [[prior appropriation]]. This was curtailed in 1902 by the [[Newlands Reclamation Act]] which introduced subsidies for [[irrigation]] projects. This had the effect of sending a signal to [[farmers]] that water was inexpensive and abundant, leading to uneconomic use of a scarce resource. Increasing difficulties in meeting demand for water in the western [[United States]] have been blamed on the continuing establishment of governmental control and a return to tradable property rights has been proposed.

==Etymology and history==
The word ''gaijin'' can be traced in writing to the 13th-century ''[[Heike Monogatari]]'':

{{quote|{{lang|ja|'''外人'''もなき所に兵具をとゝのへ}}&lt;ref name="takagi"&gt;{{cite book |last=高木  |first=市之助 |author2=小沢正夫 |author3=渥美かをる |author4=金田一春彦 |script-title=ja:日本古典文学大系: 平家物語  |publisher=岩波書店  |year=1959 |isbn=4-00-060032-X |language=Japanese |page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;Assembling arms where there are no '''gaijin'''&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The 13th-century pronunciation of the characters {{lang|ja|外人}} is debated; it may have been ''kotobito'' ({{lang|ja|ことびと}}), ''udokihito'' ({{lang|ja|うどきひと}}) or ''gwaijin'' ({{lang|ja|ぐゎいじん}}). The spelling ''gaijin'' is used here for continuity.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Here, ''gaijin'' refers to outsiders&lt;ref&gt;A. Matsumura (ed.), ''[[Daijirin]]'' (大辞林), (p. 397, 9th ed., vol. 1). (1989). Tokyo: [[Sanseido]]. "がいじん【外人】②　そのことに関係のない人。第三者。「外人もなき所に兵具をととのへ／平家一」"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Matsumura (ed.), ''[[Daijisen]]'' (大辞泉), (p. 437, 1st ed., vol. 1). (1998). Tokyo: [[Shogakukan]].

{{quote|{{lang|ja|源平両家の童形たちのおのおのござ候ふに、かやうの'''外人'''は然るべからず候}}&lt;br&gt;A '''gaijin''' doesn't belong here, where children from the Genji and Heike families are playing.}}

Here, ''gaijin'' also means an outsider or unfamiliar person.&lt;ref&gt;M. Yamaguchi et al. (eds.), [[Shinkango jiten]] (新漢語辞典), (p. 282, 2nd ed., vol. 1). (2000). Tokyo: [[Iwanami Shoten Publishing]]. "【外人】②　局外者。他人。「源平両家の童形たちのおのおのござ候ふに、かやうの外人は然るべからず候」"&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''gaikokujin'' ({{lang|ja|外国人}}) is composed of ''[[wiktionary:外国|gaikoku]]'' (foreign country) and ''[[wiktionary:人|jin]]'' (person). The [[Meiji government]] (1868–1912) introduced and popularized the term, which came to replace ''ijin'', ''ikokujin'' and ''ihōjin''. As the [[Empire of Japan]] extended [[Korea under Japanese rule|to Korea]] and [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|to Taiwan]], the term ''[[wiktionary:内国人|naikokujin]]'' ("inside country people") came to refer to nationals of other imperial territories.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}  While other terms fell out of use after [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], ''gaikokujin'' remained the official term for non-Japanese people.  Some hold that the modern ''gaijin'' is a contraction of ''gaikokujin''.&lt;ref name=Gottlieb/&gt;

At a deeper level, though, it is the connotation of exclusion and oddity that irks, particularly when the term is combined with the adjective hen na to mean 'peculiar foreigner,' a term once often heard on Japanese television shows. The term gaijin itself is included these days by most broadcasters on their list of terms best avoided."&lt;/ref&gt;

It forms the title of such novels as Marc Olden's ''Gaijin'' (New York: Arbor House, 1986), James Melville's ''Go gently, gaijin'' (New York : St. Martin's Press, 1986), James Kirkup's ''Gaijin on the Ginza'' (London: Chester Springs, 1991) and James Clavell's [[Gai-Jin (novel)|''Gai-Jin'' (New York: Delacorte Press, 1993)]], as well as a song by [[Nick Lowe]]. It is the title of feature films such as Tizuka Yamazaki's ''[[Gaijin – Os Caminhos da Liberdade]]'' (1980) and ''[[Gaijin – Ama-me Como Sou]]'' (2005), as well as animation shorts such as Fumi Inoue's ''Gaijin'' (2003).

The '''gem scam''' is a [[confidence trick]] performed in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]] as well as other cities in the country. It is one of the most pervasive scams in Thailand. Most of the shops are gold or jewelry shops. The [[mark (victim)|mark]]s tend to be [[tourists]] from outside Thailand.  It has been alleged that this scam has been operating for the past 20 years, sometimes in the same premises. It has been suggested that individuals in the [[Royal Thai Police]] and even politicians protect this scam. The scam was demonstrated on an episode of the [[BBC]] series ''[[The Real Hustle]]'' and in a [[Scam City]] episode in Bangkok.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scam City episode in Bangkok|url=http://www.travelandescape.ca/2012/08/behind-the-scenes-in-bangkok-with-scam-city/|publisher=travelandescape.ca|accessdate=17 January 2013|author=Travel and Escape staff|date=6 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==The scam==
A network of [[tout]]s and [[confidence trick|con men]] present the mark with an opportunity to profit from buying discount gems from a jewelry shop. The mark is convinced that he can buy gems at duty-free price and bring them overseas for a threefold or more profit. Through a network of helpers, each of whom tells the mark bits of information, the mark is guided to the jewelry shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Malaysians falling prey to Bangkok gems scam |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2010/1/2/nation/20100102151817&amp;sec=nation |publisher=TheStar.com |accessdate=25 July 2012 |date=2 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011053545/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2010%2F1%2F2%2Fnation%2F20100102151817&amp;sec=nation |archivedate=11 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

#A tout will be on the lookout at popular tourist spots like the [[Grand Palace, Bangkok|Grand Palace]], [[Wat Pho]], [[Khaosan Road]], [[Siam Square]], or other temples or tourist attractions in Bangkok. (Also, the scam may often be initiated by a [[tuk-tuk]] driver.) The tout will be dressed as a student or gentleman and will approach the mark to tell him the place he is about to visit is closed today because of some made-up [[public holiday|holiday]]. The tout, taking advantage of the Thai people's reputation for friendliness, may strike up a conversation, asking where the mark is from, and if this is his first time in Bangkok. The tout will also tell the mark that a certain [[tuk-tuk]] waiting nearby is cheap or even free because it has been sponsored by the tourism ministry and can bring him to other temples elsewhere to visit. Sometimes this gentleman finds out which country the mark is from and informs the con man at the next layer about it.&lt;ref name="Stock"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bangkok Gem Scam|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/holidaytypeshub/article-588986/The-Bangkok-Gem-Scam.html|publisher=TheDailyMail.uk|accessdate=25 July 2012|author=Jon Stock|date=9 Dec 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#If the mark gets on the tuk-tuk, the driver will bring him to a secluded temple in the city, drop him off, and wait for him to return.
#When the mark walks into the temple, there will be a gentleman praying inside. That person will tell him about a scheme by the government&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=21 Most Common Scams in Thailand|url=http://travelscams.org/asia/common-tourist-scams-thailand/|website=TravelScams|accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allows people to buy jewelry [[duty-free]] and make a profit when the gems are shipped to their home country, adding that today is the last day of this scheme.
# The tuk-tuk may take the mark to another temple, where another person (sometimes a Thai, sometimes a Westerner) tells the same story, building up the mark's confidence through a seemingly "independent" verification. If the mark is interested, the person will tell the tuk-tuk driver to take him to the jewelry store.
#At the shop the mark will be pressured to buy jewelry.  If the mark purchases the jewelry, the gem will be packaged and shipped directly to the mark's address in his home country so that he will not have a chance to get the gem appraised or return it for a refund.  In the purchase process the mark may be told to go to a nearby gold shop to purchase gold to be exchanged for the gem - this [[money laundering]] ensures that any stop-payment on the part of the mark will not affect the gem store's profits.
#The mark returns to his home country, only to find the jewelry to be worth far less than he paid for it.&lt;ref name=Stock /&gt;

Other scams include fake Thai [[Mikimoto Kōkichi|Mikimoto]] certificates. Once in a store, a variety of selling tactics are employed, including [[bait and switch]], and "educating" gemstone novices about "fake gems" which are in fact real, and selling them "real gems" which are in fact fake.

[[Image:LocationLebanon.svg|right|200px|thumb|Lebanon]]

'''Greeks in Lebanon''' (οι Έλληνες στο Λίβανο) had presence in present day [[Lebanon]] that dated to ancient times, and the [[Phoenicians]] and [[Greeks]] (both maritime peoples) shared close ties. The Greek alphabet, for example, is derived from the Phoenician one. The Greek presence is attested by several place names, and the close ties between Greeks and the Lebanese [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch|Greek Orthodox]] and [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholic]] communities.

==History==
[[Image:Ancient colonies.PNG|right|200px|thumb|Map of Phoenician and Greek colonies at about 550 B.C.]]
In ancient times Lebanon was the site of several Greek colonies. Following Christianization Greek culture remained a strong influence, waning as the centuries passed, though not disappearing. The city of [[Amioun]] (possibly from the Semitic word for Greeks, ''[[Name of Greece|Yunan]]''), capital of the [[Koura District]] (in turn from the Greek ''χωριά'', "villages") in the north of the country is a living testament of that. Following the [[2006 Lebanon War|2006 invasion of Lebanon by Israel]] most Greeks have fled the country, although there remains a Greek community in [[Beirut]] ([[Greater Beirut]])&lt;ref name=gmfa&gt;Hellenic Republic: Ministry of Foreign Affairs: [http://www.mfa.gr/www.mfa.gr/en-US/Policy/Geographic+Regions/Mediterranean+-+Middle+East/Bilateral+Relations/Lebanon/ Lebanon]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the aforementioned Koura District.

==Greek Muslims in Lebanon==
{{see also|Greek Muslims|Cretan Turks}}
There are about 7,000 Greeks living in [[Tripoli, Lebanon]] and in [[El Mina, Lebanon]].&lt;ref name="gsels"&gt;[http://webs.uvigo.es/ssl/actas2002/05/08.%20Roula%20Tsokalidou.pdf Greek-Speaking Enclaves of Lebanon and Syria] by Roula Tsokalidou. Proceedings ''II Simposio Internacional Bilingüismo''. Retrieved 4 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of them are Muslims of [[Cretan]] origin and some of them are of [[Greek Muslim]] origin. Records suggest that the community left Crete between 1866 and 1897, on the outbreak of the last Cretan uprising against the Ottoman Empire, which ended the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War of 1897]].&lt;ref name="gsels" /&gt; Many Greek Muslims of Lebanon somewhat managed to preserve their identity and language. Until the [[Lebanese Civil War]], their community was close-knit and entirely [[endogamy|endogamous]]. However many of them left Lebanon during the 15 years of the war.&lt;ref name="gsels" /&gt; By 1988, many Greek Muslims from both [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]] had reported being subject to discrimination by the Greek embassy because of their religious affiliation. The community members would be regarded with indifference and even hostility, and would be denied visas and opportunities to improve their Greek through trips to Greece.&lt;ref name="gsels" /&gt;

The '''Herrett Center for Arts and Science''', located on the main campus of the [[College of Southern Idaho]] in [[Twin Falls, ID|Twin Falls]], [[Idaho]], USA, is a [[museum]] of [[anthropology]], [[natural history]], [[astronomy]], and [[art]].  The museum's collections primarily comprise anthropological artifacts and [[natural history]] specimens from the [[Americas]], as well as works of local artists.  The Center also houses the Faulkner [[Planetarium]], the Centennial [[Public observatory|Observatory]], a museum store, and a 2900 square foot (269 square meter) multi-purpose '''event space.'''

==Museum Galleries==
The museum exhibits a variety of anthropological artifacts, ethnographic items, and natural history specimens, primarily from the Americas.  Notable among them is the Simon [[Clovis culture|Clovis]] cache of over thirty stone [[Hand axe|bifaces]] found in Idaho in 1961,&lt;ref&gt;Robert D. Lassen, ''Dissertation, Texas A &amp; M University'', December, 2005, "[http://repository.tamu.edu/bitstream/handle/1969.1/3276/etd-tamu-2005C-ANTH-Lassen.pdf A Comparison of Clovis Caches]", accessed 16 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and a replica of the [[Huntington Canyon Mammoth]], a nearly-complete Columbian [[mammoth]] skeleton unearthed in [[Utah]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;David D. Gillette and David B. Madsen, ''Journal of Paleontology'', July, 1993, "[http://jpaleontol.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/67/4/669 The Columbian mammoth, Mammuthus columbi, from the Wasatch Mountains of central Utah]", accessed 16 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  The Jean B. King Gallery of Art offers several exhibits per year, including annual student and faculty exhibits.

==Planetarium==
The Faulkner Planetarium opened in November, 1995, as the largest planetarium theater in Idaho, seating 151 under a 50' (15.2 m) dome (seven seats were later removed).  When first opened the theater featured one of the first [[Evans &amp; Sutherland]] [[Digistar II]] digital graphics projectors, 49 random access [[slide projector]]s, three [[video projector]]s, and an 11,500 W sound system. An upgrade to an Evans &amp; Sutherland Digistar 5 [[fulldome|fulldome video system]], [[LED]] cove lighting, a [[Dolby 5.1]] surround sound system and an AstroFX theater control system took place in the fall of 2013. Programs are offered for school groups and the public throughout the year.

==Observatory==
The Centennial Observatory opened in May, 2004, featuring the largest fully [[handicapped-accessible|wheelchair-accessible]] public [[telescope]] in the world at the time (since superseded).  It houses a 24" (0.6 m) [[Ritchey–Chrétien telescope|Ritchey-Chrétien]] f/8 computer-controlled, [[Equatorial mount|equatorial fork-mounted]] telescope under a 20' (6 m) dome, as well as a number of smaller portable telescopes.  Viewing opportunities are offered throughout the year to both the public and school groups.

==Event Space: Rick Allen Room==
This 50 x 58 foot multi-purpose room, with a view of the eastern part of the CSI campus, has a 25 x 45 foot patio on its South side for outdoor receptions or entertainment, and courtyard for events on the lawn.  The maximum capacity of this room is 240 chairs arranged auditorium style or 176 chairs arranged for dining at twenty two 5-foot round tables. There is full A/V capabilities with 2 ceiling projectors, wall slides, microphones, etc.  The space can also accommodate 144 with a classroom-style layout. A kitchenette is equipped with counter top, sink, refrigerator, microwave, and ice maker.

==History==
The museum began in the 1950s from the avocations of Norman Herrett (1904-1979), owner/operator of a Twin Falls, Idaho jewelry store.  Herrett's astronomical interests led him to construct a small building behind the store with an observatory on the roof and a home-built planetarium on the ground floor.  He also built a room adjoining the store to exhibit the anthropological artifacts he collected on trips through the Americas, and later, the works of local artists.  The Herrett Arts and Science Center, as it was known, featured an eclectic blend of exhibit styles, including a number of interactive displays with motorized action.  The planetarium featured a variety of purpose-built projectors and special effects, and the observatory housed a 12.5" [[Newtonian telescope|Newtonian]] and 10" [[Maksutov telescope]].  Local students were trained to present programs for school groups in the planetarium and museum.  In 1972, Herrett forged an agreement with the fledgling College of Southern Idaho to transfer his collections to the College in exchange for the construction of a building on the campus to house them.  The Herrett Center museum opened on the CSI campus in 1980, shortly after Herrett's death.  The facility featured anthropology galleries and an art gallery.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Anderson, "[http://herrett.csi.edu/research/norman.asp Norman Herrett's Astronomy Legacy]" accessed 16 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Expansions in 1995 and 2003-4 included additional gallery space, the Faulkner Planetarium, new artifact storage space, the Rick Allen multi-purpose room, and the Centennial Observatory.

The '''National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies''' ({{lang-fr|Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques}}), abbreviated '''INSEE''' ({{IPA-fr|inse}}), is the national statistics bureau of [[France]]. It collects and publishes information about the [[Economy of France|French economy]] and [[Demographics of France|people]] and carries out the periodic national census. Headquartered in [[Paris]], it is the French branch of [[Eurostat]]. The INSEE was created in 1946 as a successor to the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]]'s National Statistics Service (SNS). It works in close cooperation with the [[Institut national d'études démographiques]] (INED).

== Purpose ==
INSEE is responsible for the production and analysis of official statistics in France. Its best known responsibilities include:

* Organising and publishing the national census.
* Producing various [[Index (economics)|indices]] – which are widely recognised as being of excellent quality –  including an inflation index used for determining the rates of rents and the costs associated with construction.
* Eurostat uses INSEE statistics in combination with those of other national statistical agencies to compile comparable statistics for the [[European Union]] as a whole. It is also widely recognized as representing France on international questions of statistics.

== Organisation ==
The INSEE is the responsibility of [[Minister of the Economy, Finance and Industry (France)|MINEFI]], the French Ministry of Finance. The current director is Jean-Luc Tavernier. However, Eurostat considers INSEE as an independent body, although its independence is not written in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://acdc2007.free.fr/eurosta7.pdf ACDC2007.free.fr], Eurostat report&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teaching and research ===
Research and teaching for the INSEE is undertaken by GENES or Group of the National Schools of the Economy and Statistics (French:  ''Groupe des Écoles Nationales d'Économie et Statistique'') which includes:

* ENSAE (''École nationale de la statistique et de l'administration économique''), a ''[[grande école]]'' which trains INSEE administrators and engineers specialized in statistics, the economy, and finance. 
* ENSAI, (''École nationale de la statistique et de l'analyse de l'information''), an engineering school.

== Codes and numbering system ==
{{main|INSEE code}}

INSEE gives numerical indexing codes (French: ''les Codes INSEE'') to various entities in France:

* '''INSEE codes''' (known as '''COG''') are given to various administrative units, notably the French [[Commune in France|commune]]s (they do not coincide with [[postal code|postcodes]]). The 'complete' code has 8 digits and 3 spaces within, but there is a popular 'simplified' code with 5 digits and no space within:
** 2 digits (''[[département]]'') and 3 digits (commune) for the 96 ''départements'' of [[Metropolitan France]]. 
** 3 digits (''département'' or collectivity) and 2 digits (commune) for the [[Overseas departments]], [[Territorial collectivity|Overseas Territorial Collectivities]] and [[Overseas Countries and Territories]]. ''See also: [[:fr:Code INSEE#Code communal]].''
* '''INSEE numbers''' (13 digits + a two-digit key) are [[national identification number]]s given to people. The format is as follows: ''syymmlllllooo kk'', where
** ''s'' is 1 for a male, 2 for a female for a permanent number; it is 7 for a male, 8 for a female for a temporary number,
** ''yy'' are the last two digits of the year of birth,
** ''mm'' is the month of birth or a number above 20 if the birthdate is unknown
** ''lllll'' is the COG for the location of birth,
** ''ooo'' is an order number to distinguish people being born at the same place in the same year and month.
** 'kk' is the "control key", equal to 97-(the rest of the number [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 97).&lt;br&gt;There are exceptions for people in particular situations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsi.cnrs.fr/conduite-projet/phasedeveloppement/technique/etude-detaillee/modele-de-donnees/regles-numero-INSEE.pdf DSI.CNRS.fr]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[SIREN code]]s are given to businesses and [[nonprofit|nonprofit associations]], [[SIRET code]]s to their establishments and facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sirene.tm.fr SIRENE.tm.fr] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524161137/http://www.sirene.tm.fr/ |date=24 May 2009 }}, SIRENE database&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Statistics in France before INSEE ===
INSEE was preceded by several related statistical agencies in France. In 1833, the Statistics Bureau (French: ''Bureau de la statistique'') was created by [[Adolphe Thiers]]. In 1840 it was renamed ''SGF'' or ''General Statistics of France''.&lt;ref&gt;[[French language|French]]: '''''S'''tatistique '''G'''énérale de la '''F'''rance''&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the direction of Lucien March, the SGF expanded its activities. It began an investigation of consumption habits in 1907, following with periodic investigations on retail prices in 1911.

In 1920 [[Alfred Sauvy]] introduced competitive entrance exams for SGF recruitment. However, it was [[René Carmille]], a pioneer of the use of the [[calculator]]s, who laid the foundations of the modern organization. In 1940, the Demographic Service (''Service de la démographie'') was created under the Ministry of Finance in order to replace the military recruitment office prohibited by the [[Armistice with France (Second Compiègne)|June 1940 Armistice]] with [[Nazi Germany]]. In order to better conceal its undertakings, the Demographic Service absorbed the SGF on 11 October 1941. The new organization was called the ''SNS'' or ''National Statistics Service''.&lt;ref&gt;[[French language|French]]: '''''S'''ervice '''N'''ational des '''S'''tatistiques''&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this reorganization, six new offices were created in the [[Vichy France|Northern (occupied) zone]] whose regional structure is maintained today in INSEE.

René Carmille created an Applied Sciences School (predecessor of the current [[Ecole Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Administration Economique|ENSAE]]) to specially train members for the SNS.

Carmille worked for Vichy France but he was actually a double agent for the French underground. From his position in the SNS he sabotaged the Nazi census of France, which saved untold numbers of Jewish people from death camps. He also used his department to help mobilize French resistance in Algeria. He was caught by the Nazis and sent to [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] where he died in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;IBM and the Holocaust, Edwin Black, 2001, Crown , p 320-332,&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Creation of INSEE ===
The SNS was finally transformed into INSEE by the law of 27 April 1946, ''The National Institute of Statistics and Economic Surveys for the metropolis and overseas France'' (''L'Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques pour la métropole et la France d'outre-mer'').

=== List of directors ===
This is a list of directors of INSEE since its founding:

*1946–1961: Francis-Louis Closon 
*1961–1967: Claude Gruson 
*1967–1974: Jean Ripert 
*1974–1987: [[Edmond Malinvaud]] 
*1987–1992: Jean-Claude Milleron 
*1992–2003: Paul Champsaur 
*2003–2007: Jean-Michel Charpin 
*2007–2012: Jean-Philippe Cotis 
*2012–{{0}}{{0}}{{0}}{{0}}: Jean-Luc Tavernier

'''Kolam''' is a form of drawing that is drawn by using [[rice]] flour, chalk, chalk powder or rock powder, often using naturally or synthetically colored powders, in Sri Lanka, the [[India]]n states of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Karnataka]], [[Telangana]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Kerala]] and some parts of [[Goa]], [[Maharashtra]] as well as [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Thailand]] and a few other Asian countries. A Kolam is a geometrical line drawing composed of curved loops, drawn around a grid pattern of dots. In [[South India]] and Sri Lanka, it is widely practised by female [[Hindu]] family members in front of their houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmi.ac.in/gift/Kolam.htm|title=KOLAM|author=Dr.Gift Siromoney|date= |work= |publisher=Chennai Mathematical Institute|accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kolams are regionally known by different names in India, ''Raangolee'' in Maharashtra, '' Aripan '' in [[Mithila (India)|Mithila]], ''Hase'' and ''Raongoli'' in Kannada in Karnataka, ''Muggulu'' in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auroville.org/environment/villages/vill_kolam.htm|title=Kolams|author=|date=|work=|publisher=Auroville|accessdate=12 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230060541/http://www.auroville.org/environment/villages/vill_kolam.htm|archivedate=30 December 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More complex Kolams are drawn and colors are often added during holiday occasions and special events.

==History==
[[File:White stones.JPG|thumb|200px|White stones used to make one type of Kolam flour]]
Kolams are thought to bring prosperity to homes. Every morning in [[Tamil Nadu]], millions of women draw kolams on the ground with white rice flour. Through the day, the drawings get walked on, washed out in the rain, or blown around in the wind; new ones are made the next day. Every morning before sunrise, the floor of the house, or where ever the Kolam may be drawn, is cleaned with water and the muddy floor swept well to create an even surface. The kolams are generally drawn while the surface is still damp so the design will hold better. Even powdered white stone (வெங்கசங்கள் பொடி / மொக்குமாவு) can be used for creating Kolam. Occasionally, [[cow dung]] is also used to wax the floors. In some cultures, cow dung is believed to have antiseptic properties and hence provides a literal threshold of protection for the home. It also provides contrast with the white powder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indian-heritage.org/alangaram/kolams/kolams.htm |title=Traditional customs and practices - Kolams|author= |date= |work= |publisher=Indian Heritage|accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decoration is not the main purpose of a Kolam. In olden days, kolams were drawn in coarse rice flour, so the [[ants]] would not have to walk too far or too long for a meal. The rice powder also invites birds and other small creatures to eat it, thus welcoming other beings into one's home and everyday life: a daily tribute to harmonious co-existence. It is a sign of invitation to welcome all into the home, not the least of whom is [[Lakshmi]], the Goddess of prosperity and wealth. The patterns range between geometric and mathematical line drawings around a matrix of dots to free form art work and closed shapes. [[Folklore]] has evolved to mandate that the lines must be completed so as to symbolically prevent evil spirits from entering the inside of the shapes, and thus are they prevented from entering the inside of the home.

[[Image:Kolam Indigo Dyed Cloth.jpg|thumb|200px|3x3 symmetry 9 goddesses swastika Kolam with a single cycle by Nagata S, each of which corresponds to one of the nine Devi (Goddesses) of the Vedic system]]
It used to be a matter of pride to be able to draw large complicated patterns without lifting the hand off the floor or standing up in between. The month of ''Margazhi'' was eagerly awaited by young women, who would then showcase their skills by covering the entire width of the road with one big kolam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Kolam’ draws huge crowd|url=http://www.hindu.com/2010/01/07/stories/2010010750830200.htm|accessdate=|newspaper=The Hindu|date=7 January 2010|location=Trichy, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the kolam patterns, many designs are derived from magical motifs and abstract designs blended with philosophic and religious motifs which have been mingled together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmi.ac.in/gift/Kolam/kola_pattern.htm|title=Kolam-South Indian kolam patterns |author=Dr.Gift Siromoney|date= |work= |publisher=Chennai Mathematical Institute|accessdate=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motifs may include fish, birds, and other animal images to symbolise the unity of man and beast. The sun, moon and other zodiac symbols were also used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pongal festival - Kolam design ideas|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/pongal-festival-kolam-design-ideas/1/168475.html|accessdate=|newspaper=India Today|date=12 January 2012|location=India}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Downward pointing triangle represented woman; an upward pointing triangle represented man. A circle represented nature while a square represented culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://devdutt.com/articles/indian-mythology/between-the-rangoli-lines.html|title=Between the Rangoli lines|last=|first=|date=29 Nov 2009|website=Devdutt Pattanaik|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lotus represented the womb. A pentagram represented Venus and the five elements.

The ritual kolam patterns created for special occasions such as weddings often stretch all the way down the street. Many of these created patterns have been passed on from generation to generation, from mothers to daughters.

Seasonal messages like welcome (நல்வரவு) can also be used in Kolam. Volunteering to draw the kolam at the temple is sometimes done when a devotee's wishes are fulfilled. The art of Kolam designs has found its way into the future through social networking sites like Facebook. Many Kolam artists have big fan followings online and are playing a role in making the Kolam art form a key part of South India's contemporary art scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://devdutt.com/articles/indian-mythology/between-the-rangoli-lines.html|title=Between the Rangoli lines|last=|first=|date=29 Nov 2009|website=Devdutt Pattanaik|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
For special occasions [[limestone]] and red [[brick]] powder to contrast are also used. Though kolams &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gamadia|first1=Roweena|title=Rangoli Kolam- Designs and Samples of Rangoli Kolam|url=http://www.rangolidesigns.net/2014/07/rangoli-kolam-designs.html|website=Rangoli Design|accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; are usually done with dry rice flour, for longevity, dilute rice paste or even paints are also used. Modern interpretations have accommodated chalk, and more recently [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] stickers.

Though not as flamboyant as its other Indian contemporary, [[Rangoli]], which is extremely colourful, a South Indian Kolam is all about symmetry, precision, and complexity.&lt;ref name="American"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/the-kolam-tradition|title=The Kolam tradition|author=Marcia Ascher|date=January 2002|work= |publisher=American Scientist|accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to their complexity, trying to figure out how, exactly, these designs were drawn can be a challenge that some viewers find enjoyable.

==Patterns==
* a pattern in which a stroke (Neli, Kambi, Sikku in [[Tamil language|Tamil]]) runs once around each dot (Pulli), and goes to the beginning point (endless/cycle), as a mostly geometrical figure. The stroke called as Neli from a snaky line. The stroke has Knot (Sikku) structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scipress.org/journals/forma/pdf/2201/22010031.pdf|title=Fundamental Study on Design System of Kolam Pattern|author=K.Yanagisawa, S.Nagata|year=2007|work=Forma Journal|publisher=SciPress|accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a pattern using only part of the dot grid. If that is the case, the same pattern or a different pattern fills/uses up the remaining dot grids. Most of the times, these patterns together end up becoming a complex pattern.
* a pattern in which a stroke runs around each dot not completely, but open.
* a pattern in which strokes (Kodu/Kotto) are connected between the dots. Sometimes it represents kinds of objects, flowers, or animals etc.
* a pattern in which dots are set in a radial arrangement, called Lotus.
* a pattern which is drawn in a freestyle and mostly colourized.

==Research==
* The mathematical properties of Kolam are being used in the computer science field.&lt;ref name="American"/&gt; Kolam patterns are studied and algorithms are developed for regenerating kolam designs with different patterns has been done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scipress.org/journals/forma/pdf/2201/22010055.pdf|title=Extended Pasting Scheme for Kolam Pattern Generation|author=T.Robinson|year=2007|work=Forma Journal|publisher=SciPress|accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* As Kolams have a strong relationship with contemporary art and art history, they are used in the artwork and media field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northampton.edu/Northampton-NOW/The-Mystery-of-Kolam.htm|title=The Mystery of Kolam|author=Adam Atkinson|date=September 2011|work=|publisher=Northampton Community College|accessdate=25 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013012043/http://www.northampton.edu/Northampton-NOW/The-Mystery-of-Kolam.htm|archivedate=13 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Kolams are also used to simplify the representation of complex protein structures for easy understanding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/leonardo/v046/46.1.balaji.html Protein Kolam]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Konkani Muslims''' (also known as Kokani Muslims) are a sub-ethnic group of the [[Konkani people|Konkani (Kokani) people]] living in the [[Konkan]] region of western India, who practise [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bombay Islam: the religious economy of the West Indian Ocean, 1840–1915  |first=Nile |last=Green  |publisher=Cambridge University Press  |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims from the districts of Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri, Raigad, Mumbai city and suburb, and Thane are generally regarded as Konkani Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ikokani.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=57&amp;Itemid=68&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
The Konkani Muslim community forms a part of the larger Konkani speaking demographic and are predominantly located in the [[Konkan division]] of the Indian state of [[Maharashtra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The People Of Bombay 1850-1914 (An approach paper)  |first=Cynthia  |last1=Deshmukh  |journal=Proceedings of the Indian History Congress  |volume=40  |year=1979  |pages=836–840  |jstor=44142034}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the administrative districts of [[Mumbai]], [[Mumbai Suburban]], [[Palghar district|Palghar]], [[Thane district|Thane]], [[Raigad district|Raigad]], [[Ratnagiri district|Ratnagiri]] and [[Sindhudurg district|Sindhudurg]].

There is a diaspora Konkani Muslim community based in Persian Gulf states,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kokancouncil.org/category/kokani-oraganizations/  |title=Kokani Organisations  |access-date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Impact of migration to the middle east on Ratnagiri  |first1=Sudha  |last1=Gogate  |editor1-first=M.

== History ==
Since antiquity, the Konkan coast has had mercantile relations with major ports on the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. Konkani Muslims can trace their ancestry to Arab traders who visited the coast in the medieval era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ikokani.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=57&amp;Itemid=68|title=History|last1=Dr [[Omar Khalidi]]|website=www.ikonkani.com|publisher=i-konkani|access-date=19 April 2015}}  [http://www.ikokani.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=57&amp;Itemid=68]&lt;/ref&gt; Ancestry formed the basis for social stratification: direct descendants of Arab traders formed an elite class over those who had indirect descent through intermarriages with local converts to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/Thane/Religion.html  |title=Thane District Gazetteer, Government of Maharashtra  |access-date=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://raigad.gov.in/DG/1964/people_muslims.html  |title=Colaba District Gazetteer, Government of Maharashtra  |access-date=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ratnagiri.nic.in/gazetter/gom/people_muslims.html  |title=Ratnagiri District Gazetteer, Government of Maharashtra  |access-date=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religion ==
Konkani Muslims follow the [[Shafi'i]] school of [[Sunni]] Islamic law. This is in contrast to the rest of North India and Deccan regions whose Sunni Muslims adhere to the [[Hanafi]] school.&lt;ref name="jnu_phd"&gt;{{cite thesis  |type=Ph.D. |first=Md.

== Language ==
Konkani Muslims speak a variety of dialects of [[Marathi language|Marathi]] collectively called [[Maharashtrian Konkani]].&lt;ref name="jnu_phd"/&gt; Some of the dialects include Parabhi, Kunbi, Karadhi, Sangameshwari and Bankoti. These form a gradual linguistic continuum between standard Marathi in regions around Mumbai and [[Konkani language]] in regions around Goa.

In addition, the Muslims from south Sindhudurg, near [[Malvan]], and the former princely state of [[Sawantwadi State|Sawantwadi]] speak the [[Malvani Konkani]] dialect of the Konkani language.

==Cuisine ==
The cuisine of Konkani Muslims is non-vegetarian, mostly seafood. Its staple food is rice and bread made of rice (preferred at dinners) with fish and lentils or vegetables. It is mainly influenced by [[Maharashtrian cuisine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mid-day.com/articles/mumbai-food-konkani-muslim-pop-up-seafood-coconut-weekend/17983168  |title=Mumbai Food: Konkani-Muslim pop-up celebrates all things seafood and coconut  |website= www.mid-day.com  |publisher=[[Mid-Day]]  |date=2017-02-10  |access-date=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The southern portion of Konkan region has [[Malvani cuisine]] which overlaps with Maharashtrian and [[Goan cuisine|Goan]] cuisines.

'''Koy Sanjaq Surat''' (Arabic: سورث كوي سنجق) is a modern Eastern [[Syriac language|Syriac]]-[[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] language. Speakers of the language call it simply ''Surat'', or 'Syriac'. It is spoken in the town of [[Koi Sanjaq|Koy Sanjaq]] in the [[Erbil Governorate]]. The speakers of Koy Sanjaq Surat have traditionally been [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and thus the language has generally been considered a dialect of [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]]. The ''Madnhâyâ'' version of the [[Syriac alphabet]] is used in writing, but most written material is in the [[Syriac language]] used in worship.

==Origins==
Koy Sanjaq Surat seems to be related to [[Senaya language|Senaya]], which is spoken by Assyrians who originally lived east of Koy Sanjaq, in the city of [[Sanandaj]] in [[Iran]]. Not enough is known about the language to make any definite comment, but it seems that Koy Sanjaq Surat may have developed as the language of Assyrian settlers from Sanandaj.

==Influences==
The dialect also has much more [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] influences then other dialects of Syriac. It does not appear to be intelligible with [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]], which is spoken by co-ethnics further north, or with the Jewish Neo-Aramaic language of [[Lishanid Noshan]], which was traditionally spoken by the Jews of Koy Sanjaq.

{{Feudal status}}

The '''landed gentry''', or simply the gentry, is a largely historical [[Social structure of the United Kingdom#History|British social class]] consisting in theory of landowners who could live entirely from rental income, or at least had a country estate. It was distinct from, and socially "below", [[British nobility|the aristocracy or peerage]], although in fact some of the landed gentry were wealthier than some peers, and many gentry were related to peers. They often worked as administrators of their own lands, while others became public, political, religious, and armed forces figures. The decline of this privileged class largely stemmed from the [[Great Depression of British Agriculture|1870s agricultural depression]]; however, there are still a large number of hereditary gentry in the UK to this day, many of whom transferred their landlord style management skills after the agricultural depression into the business of land agency, the act of buying and selling land.

The designation "landed gentry" originally referred exclusively to members of the [[upper class]] who were [[Landlord#History|landlords]] and also commoners in the British sense – that is, they did not hold [[peerage]]s – but usage became more fluid over time. Similar or analogous social systems of landed gentry also sprang up in  countries that maintained a colonial system; the term is employed in many British colonies such as the [[Colony of Virginia]] and some parts of India.  By the late 19th century, the term was also applied to peers such as the [[Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster|Duke of Westminster]] who lived on landed estates. The book series ''[[Burke's Landed Gentry]]'' recorded the members of this class. Successful [[Bourgeoisie|burghers]] often used their accumulated wealth to buy country estates, with the aim of establishing themselves as landed gentry.

==Groupings==
The term ''[[gentry]]'', some of whom were landed, included four separate groups in England:&lt;ref&gt;Canon, John, The Oxford Companion to British History, p. 405 under the heading "Gentry" (Oxford University Press, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Baronet]]s: a hereditary title, originally created in the 14th century and revived by King James in 1611, giving the holder the right to be addressed as ''Sir''.
# [[Knight]]s: originally a military rank, this status was increasingly awarded to civilians as a reward for service to the Crown. Holders have the right to be addressed as ''Sir'', as are baronets, but unlike baronet, the title of knight is not hereditary.
# [[Esquire]]s: originally men aspiring to knighthood, were the principal attendants on a knight. After the [[Middle Ages]] the title of Esquire (Esq.) became an honour that could be conferred by the Crown, and by custom the holders of certain offices (such as [[barrister]]s, [[Lord Mayor|lord mayor/mayor]], [[Justice of the Peace|justices of the peace]], and higher officer ranks in the armed services) were deemed to be Esquires. (see [[Squires|Squire]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heal|first1=Felicity|title=The Gentry in England and Wales, 1500-1700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4_FyR7sXCFcC&amp;pg=PA230&amp;lpg=PA230&amp;dq=gentry+in+england+and+wales+felicity+heal+mayor&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qCG_2Htjw5&amp;sig=gsC2roqC1EQT8-M9kRQd9GuiS0Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIp_zJpPvLAhVCqqYKHZ3kAokQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=gentry%20in%20england%20and%20wales%20felicity%20heal%20mayor&amp;f=false|publisher=Stanford University Press, 1994 (Page 230)|accessdate=7  April 2016|quote=(By the late 17th century)....a number of local squires were added to the governing bodies, even appointed as mayors...}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Gentleman|Gentlemen]]: possessors of a social status recognised as a separate title by the Statute of Additions of 1413. Generally men of high birth or rank, good social standing, and wealth, who did not need to work for a living, were considered gentlemen.

All of the first group, and very many of the last three, were "armigerous", having obtained the right to carry a [[coats of arms]]. In many Continental societies, this was exclusively the right of the nobility, and at least the upper clergy. In France this was originally true but many of the landed gentry, burghers and wealthy merchants were allowed to register coats of arms and become "armigerous".

==Origin of the term==
The term ''landed gentry'', although originally used to mean [[nobility]], came to be used of the lesser nobility in England around 1540. Once identical, eventually these terms{{clarify|date=July 2012}} became complementary, in the sense that their definitions began to fill in parts of what the other lacked. The historical term [[gentry]] by itself, so [[Peter Coss]] argues, is a construct that historians have applied loosely to rather different societies. Any particular model may not fit a specific society, yet a single definition nevertheless remains desirable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/402 Michael Hicks, review of The Origins of the English Gentry, (review no. 402)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://assets.cambridge.org/97805210/21005/frontmatter/9780521021005_frontmatter.pdf Cambridge University Press 0521021006 - The Origins of the English Gentry Peter Coss]&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''landed gentry'' referred in particular to the untitled members of the [[land tenure|landowning]] [[upper class]]. The most stable and respected form of wealth has historically been land, and great prestige and political qualifications were (and to a lesser extent still are) attached to land ownership.

==Development==
The primary meaning of "landed gentry" encompasses those members of the land owning classes who are not members of the [[peerage]]. It was an informal designation: one belonged to the landed gentry if other members of that class accepted one as such. A newly rich man who wished his family to join the gentry (and they nearly all did so wish), was expected not only to buy a [[English country house|country house]] and estate, but also to sever all financial ties with the business which had made him wealthy in order to cleanse his family of the "taint of trade". However, during the 19th century, as the new rich of the [[Industrial Revolution]] became more and more numerous and politically powerful, this expectation was gradually relaxed. From the late 16th-century, the gentry emerged as the class most closely involved in politics, the military and law. It provided the bulk of [[Members of Parliament]], with many gentry families maintaining political control in a certain locality over several generations (see [[List of political families in the United Kingdom]]). Owning land was a prerequisite for [[suffrage]] (the civil right to vote) in [[United Kingdom constituencies#County constituencies and borough constituencies|county constituencies]] until the [[Reform Act 1832]]; until then, [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was largely in the hands of the landowning class.

Members of the landed gentry were [[upper class]] (not [[middle class]]); this was a highly prestigious status. Particular prestige was attached to those who inherited landed estates over a number of generations. These are often described as being from "old" families. Titles are often considered central to the upper class, but this is certainly not universally the case. For example, both Captain [[Mark Phillips]] and Vice Admiral Sir [[Timothy Laurence]], the first and second husbands of HRH The [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]], lacked any rank of peerage, yet could scarcely be considered anything other than upper class.

The agricultural sector's middle class, on the other hand, comprise the larger [[tenant farmer]]s, who rent land from the landowners, and [[yeoman]] farmers, who were defined as "a person qualified by possessing free land of forty [[£sd|shillings]] annual [feudal] value, and who can serve on juries and vote for a [[Knight of the Shire]]. He is sometimes described as a small landowner, a farmer of the middle classes."&lt;ref&gt;See ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary'', edited by H.W. &amp; F.G.Fowler, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1972 reprint, p.&amp;nbsp;1516; note the definition does not apply to 1972, but to an earlier time.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Wagner|Anthony Richard Wagner]] of the [[Richmond Herald]] wrote that "a Yeoman would not normally have less than 100 acres" (40 hectares) and in social status is one step down from the gentry, but above, say, a [[husbandman]].&lt;ref&gt;''English Genealogy'', Oxford, 1965, pps: 125–30.&lt;/ref&gt; So while yeoman farmers owned enough land to support a comfortable lifestyle, they nevertheless farmed it themselves and were excluded from the "landed gentry" because they worked for a living, and were thus "in trade" as it was termed. Apart from a few "honourable" professions connected with the governing elite (the [[clergy]] of the [[State religion|established church]], the officer corps of the [[British Armed Forces]], the diplomatic and [[civil service]]s, the [[barrister|bar]] or the [[judiciary]]), such occupation was considered demeaning by the upper classes, particularly by the 19th century, when the earlier mercantile endeavours of younger sons were increasingly discontinued. Younger sons, who could not expect to inherit the family estate, were instead urged into professions of state service. It became a pattern in many families that while the eldest son would inherit the estate and enter politics, the second son would join the army, the third son go into law, and the fourth son join the church.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Wallis and Cliff Webb, ''The education and training of gentry sons in early modern England'' http://www.lse.ac.uk/economicHistory/pdf/Wallis/GentrySons.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gentry and nobility==
Persons who are closely related to peers are also more correctly described as gentry than as nobility, since the latter term, in the modern British Isles, is synonymous with "[[peerage|peer]]". However, this popular usage of 'nobility' omits the distinction between titled and untitled nobility. The titled nobility in Britain are the peers of the realm, whereas the untitled nobility comprise those here described as gentry.&lt;ref name = "Untitled nobility"&gt;{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=o8ZPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA13&amp;dq=gentry,+untitled+nobility&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dJCGT9z_HsPR0QX6j7mqBw&amp;ved=0CGMQ6AEwBzgy#v=onepage&amp;q=gentry%2C%20untitled%20nobility&amp;f=false | contribution = Esquire | title = Penny cyclopedia | publisher = Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge | volume = 9–10 | page = 13 | accessdate = 12 March 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lawrence"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=k04RAQAAIAAJ |last=Larence |first=Sir James Henry |title=The nobility of the British Gentry or the political ranks and dignities of the British Empire compared with those on the continent |edition=2nd |location=London |publisher=T.Hookham -- Simpkin and Marshall |year=1827 |origyear=first published 1824 |accessdate=2013-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Cannadine]] wrote that the gentry's lack of titles "did not matter, for it was obvious to contemporaries that the landed gentry were all for practical purposes the equivalent of continental nobles, with their hereditary estates, their leisured lifestyle, their social pre-eminence, and their armorial bearings".&lt;ref name="cannadine1999"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Decline and Fall of the British Aristocracy | publisher=Vintage Books | author=Cannadine, David | year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; British armigerous families who hold no title of nobility are represented, together with those who hold titles through the [[College of Arms]], by the Commission and Association for Armigerous Families of Great Britain at [[CILANE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vCtf9TdBOy8C&amp;pg=PA5&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | publisher = Google | title = Books | place = UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Burke's Landed Gentry'' and ''Burke's Peerage''==
In the 18th and 19th centuries, the names and families of those with titles (specifically [[Peerage|peers]] and [[baronet]]s, less often including those with the non-hereditary title of [[knight]]) were often listed in books or manuals known as "Peerages", "Baronetages", or combinations of these categories, such as the "Peerage, Baronetage, Knightage, and Companionage". As well as listing genealogical information, these books often also included details of the right of a given family to a [[coat of arms]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} They were comparable to the [[Almanach de Gotha]] in continental Europe.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Novelist [[Jane Austen]], whose family were not quite members of the landed gentry class,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YDmqXWsQygYC&amp;lpg=PA128&amp;dq=jane%20austen%20landed%20gentry&amp;pg=PA128#v=onepage&amp;q=jane%20austen%20landed%20gentry&amp;f=false|title=The Cambridge Companion to Jane Austen|last=Copeland|first=Edward|last2=McMaster|first2=Juliet|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521763080|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; summarised the appeal of these works, particularly for those included in them:

{{quote|Sir Walter Elliot, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man who, for his own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage; there he found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a distressed one; there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect, by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest [[letters patent|patents]]; there any unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century; and there, if every other leaf were powerless, he could read his own history with an interest which never failed.|sign=Jane Austen|source=[[Persuasion (novel)|''Persuasion'']], chapter 1, page 1}}

Equally wryly, [[Oscar Wilde]] referred to the Peerage as "the best thing in fiction the English have ever done".&lt;ref&gt;''[[A Woman of No Importance]]'', Lord Illingworth to his son Gerald Arbuthnot{{full citation needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1830s, one peerage publisher, [[John Burke (genealogist)|John Burke]], expanded his market and his readership by publishing a similar volume for people without titles, which was called ''A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Commoners of Great Britain and Ireland, enjoying territorial possessions or high official rank'', popularly known as ''Burke's Commoners. Burke's Commoners'' was published in four volumes from 1833 to 1838.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFlHAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PR3&amp;dq=burke's+commoners+first+edition&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiC8P3V-IXYAhUMxoMKHYSNAXYQ6AEIPDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=burke's%20commoners%20first%20edition&amp;f=false|title=Index to the Pedigree in Burke's Commoners: Originally Prepared by George Ormerod in 1840|last=Ormerod|first=George|date=1907|publisher=Provost of Queen's College|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ukga.org/cgi-bin/search.cgi?action=loadDB&amp;DB=33|title=Burke's Peerage and Landed Gentry Database Search|website=ukga.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Trotter.blg.1898.jpg|thumb|200px|Typical entry in ''Burke's Landed Gentry'' (from Volume 2 of the 1898 edition).]]
Subsequent editions were re-titled ''A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry; or, Commons of Great Britain and Ireland'' or ''Burke's Landed Gentry.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Burke's Landed Gentry'' continued to appear at regular intervals throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, driven, in the 19th century, principally by the energy and readable style of the founder's son and successor as editor, Sir John Bernard Burke (who generally favoured the romantic and picturesque in genealogy over the mundane, or strictly correct).

A review of the 1952 edition in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' noted:

{{quote|Landed Gentry used to limit itself to owners of domains that could properly be called "stately" (i.e. more than 500 acres or 200 hectares). Now it has lowered the property qualification to {{convert|200|acre|km2}} for all British families whose pedigrees have been "notable" for three generations.

Even so, almost half of the 5,000 families listed in the new volume are in there because their forefathers were: they themselves have no land left. Their estates are mere street addresses, like that of the Molineux-Montgomeries, formerly of Garboldisham Old Hall, now of No. 14 Malton Avenue, Haworth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Foreign News: Twentieth Century Squires|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,815693,00.html|accessdate=14 January 2013|newspaper=Time|date=10 December 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The last three-volume edition of ''Burke's Landed Gentry'' was published between 1965 and 1972. A new series, under new owners, was begun in 2001 on a regional plan, starting with ''Burke's Landed Gentry; The Kingdom in Scotland''. However, these volumes no longer limit themselves to people with any connection, ancestral or otherwise, with land, and they contain much less information, particularly on family history, than the 19th and 20th century editions.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The popularity of ''Burke's Landed Gentry'' gave currency to the expression ''Landed Gentry'' as a description of the untitled upper classes in England (although the book also included families in Wales, Scotland and Ireland, where, however, social structures were rather different). An alternate name was employed by the publishers of a similar, though less genealogical, series, known as ''[[Walford's County Families]]'', wherein the term ''county family'' referred more or less to the same people Burke covered by the term, ''landed gentry''. They were also known as the [[upper ten thousand]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Families were arranged in alphabetical order by surname, and each family article was headed with the surname and the name of their [[landed property]], e.g. "Capron of [[Southwick, Northamptonshire|Southwick]] Hall". There was then a paragraph on the owner of the property, with his [[coat of arms]] illustrated, and all his children and remoter male-line descendants also listed, each with full names and details of birth, marriage, death, and any matters tending to enhance their social prestige, such as [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|school]] and [[university]] education, military rank and regiment, [[Church of England]] cures held, and other honours and socially approved involvements. Cross references were included to other families in ''Burke's Landed Gentry'' or in ''[[Burke's Peerage and Baronetage]]'': thus encouraging browsing through connections. Professional details were not usually mentioned unless they conferred some social status, such as those of civil service and colonial officials, judges and barristers.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

After the section dealing with the current owner of the property, there usually appeared a section entitled ''Lineage'' which listed, not only ancestors of the owner, but (so far as known) every male-line descendant of those ancestors, thus including many people in the ranks of the "Landed Gentry" families who had never owned an acre in their lives but who might share in the status of their eponymous kin as connected, however remotely to the ''landed gentry'' or to a ''county family''.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Contemporary status==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}
The [[Great Depression of British Agriculture]] at the end of the 19th century, together with the introduction in the 20th century of increasingly heavy levels of taxation on inherited wealth, put an end to agricultural land as the primary source of wealth for the upper classes. Many estates were sold or broken up, and this trend was accelerated by the introduction of protection for agricultural tenancies, encouraging outright sales, from the mid-20th century.

So devastating was this for the ranks formerly identified as being of the landed gentry that ''Burke's Landed Gentry'' began, in the 20th century, to include families historically in this category who had ceased to own their ancestral lands. The focus of those who remained in this class shifted from the lands or estates themselves, to the [[stately home]] or "[[family seat]]" which was in many cases retained without the surrounding lands. Many of these buildings were purchased for the nation and preserved as monuments to the lifestyles of their former owners (who sometimes remained in part of the house as lessees or tenants) by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty]]. The National Trust, which had originally concentrated on open landscapes rather than buildings, accelerated its country house acquisition programme during and after the [[World War II|Second World War]], partly because of the widespread [[Destruction of country houses in 20th-century Britain|destruction of country houses in the 20th century]] by owners who could no longer afford to maintain them. Those who retained their property usually had to supplement their incomes from sources other than the land, sometimes by opening their properties to the public.

In the 21st century, the term "landed gentry" is still used, as the landowning class still exists, but it increasingly refers more to historic than to current landed wealth or property in a family. Moreover, the deference which was once automatically given to members of this class by most British people has almost completely dissipated as its wealth, political power and social influence have declined, and other social figures such as [[celebrity|celebrities]] have grown to take their place in the public's interest.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6727">The '''list of periods and events in climate history''' includes some notable climate events known to [[paleoclimatology]].  Knowledge of precise climatic events decreases as the record goes further back in time. The [[timeline of glaciation]] covers [[ice age]]s specifically, which tend to have their own names for phases, often with different names used for different parts of the world. The names for earlier periods and events come from [[geology]] and [[paleontology]]. The [[marine isotope stage]]s (MIS) are often used to express dating within the [[Quaternary]].

==Start to Quaternary period==

[[Image:Phanerozoic Climate Change.png|thumb|450px|500 million years of climate change]]
[[Image:Vostok Petit data.svg|thumb|450px|Ice core data for the past 400,000 years, with the present at right. Note length of glacial cycles averages ~100,000 years. Blue curve is temperature, green curve is CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and red curve is windblown glacial dust (loess).]] 
Scale: Millions of years [[before present]], earlier dates approximate.

* Before 1,000 Mya [[Faint young Sun paradox]] 
* 2,400 Mya [[Great Oxygenation Event]] probably leads to [[Huronian glaciation]] perhaps covering the whole globe 
* 650–600 Mya Later Neoproterozoic [[Snowball Earth]] or [[Marinoan glaciation]], precursor to the [[Cambrian Explosion]]
* 517 Mya [[End-Botomian mass extinction]]; like the next two, little understood
* 502 Mya [[Dresbachian]] extinction event 
* {{Period start|Ordovician}} Mya [[Cambrian–Ordovician extinction event]] 
* 450–440 Mya [[Ordovician–Silurian extinction event]], in two bursts, after cooling perhaps caused by [[tectonic plate]] movement
* 450 Mya [[Andean-Saharan glaciation]]
* 360-260 Mya [[Karoo Ice Age]]
* 305 Mya cooler climate causes [[Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]]
* {{Period start|Triassic}} Mya [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]] 
* 199.6 Mya [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event]], causes as yet unclear
* 66 Mya, perhaps 30,000 years of volcanic activity form the [[Deccan Traps]] in India, Or a large meteor impact.
* {{Period start|Paleogene}} Mya [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary]] and [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]], extinction of [[dinosaurs]] 
* 55.8 Mya [[Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum]] 
* 53.7 Mya [[Eocene Thermal Maximum 2]] 
* 49 Mya [[Azolla event]] may have ended a long warm period
* 5.3–2.6 Mya [[Pliocene climate]] became cooler and drier, and seasonal, similar to modern climates.
* 2.5 Mya to present [[Quaternary glaciation]], with permanent ice on the [[polar regions]], many named stages in different parts of the world

==Pleistocene==
All dates are approximate. "(B-S)" means this is one of the periods from the [[Blytt-Sernander]] sequence, originally based on studies of Danish [[peat bog]]s.

* 120,000–90,000 '''BP''' [[Abbassia Pluvial]] wet in North Africa
* 110,000–10,000 BP [[Last glacial period]], not to be confused with the Last Glacial Maximum or Late Glacial Maximum below
** 50,000–30,000 BP [[Mousterian Pluvial]] wet in North Africa
** 26,500–19,000–20,000 BP [[Last Glacial Maximum]], what is often meant in popular usage by "Last Ice Age"
** 16,000–13,000 '''BC''' [[Oldest Dryas]] cold, begins slowly and ends sharply (B-S) 
** 12,700 BC [[Antarctic Cold Reversal]] warmer Antarctic, sea levels rise
** 12,400 BC [[Bølling oscillation]] warm and wet in the North Atlantic, begins the [[Bølling-Allerød]] period (B-S)
** 12,400–11,500 BC (much discussed) [[Older Dryas]] cold, interrupts warm period for some centuries (B-S)
** 12,000–11,000 BC [[Allerød oscillation]] warm &amp; moist (B-S)
** 11,400–9,500 BC [[Huelmo/Mascardi Cold Reversal]] cold in [[Southern Hemisphere]]  
** 11,000-8,000 BC [[Late Glacial Maximum]], or Tardiglacial (definitions vary)
** 10,800–9,500 BC [[Younger Dryas]] sudden cold and dry period in [[Northern Hemisphere]] (B-S)

==Holocene==
All dates are BC (BCE) and approximate. "(B-S)" means this is one of the periods from the [[Blytt-Sernander]] sequence, originally based on studies of Danish [[peat bog]]s.

* From 10,000 BC [[Holocene glacial retreat]], the present [[Holocene]] or [[Postglacial]] period begins  
* 9,400 BC [[Pre-Boreal]] sharp rise in temperature over 50 years (B-S), precedes Boreal
* 8,500 – 6,900 BC [[Boreal (period)|Boreal]] (B-S), rising sea levels, forest replaces tundra in northern Europe
* 7,500 – 3,900 BC [[Neolithic Subpluvial]] in North Africa, wet 
* 7,000 – 3,000 BC [[Holocene climatic optimum]], or [[Atlantic (period)|Atlantic]] in northern Europe (B-S)  
* 6,200 BC [[8.2 kiloyear event]] cold
* 5,000–4,100 BC [[Older Peron]] warm and wet, global sea levels were 2.5 to 4 meters (8 to 13 feet) higher than the twentieth-century average
* 3,900 BC [[5.9 kiloyear event]] dry and cold, ends Neolithic Subpluvial in North Africa, expands [[Sahara]] Desert
* 3,000 BC - 0 [[Neopluvial]] in North America
* 3,200–2,900 BC [[Piora Oscillation]], cold, perhaps not global. Wetter in Europe, drier elsewhere, linked to the [[domestication of the horse]] in Central Asia.
* 2,200 BC  [[4.2 kiloyear event]] dry, lasted most of the [[22nd century BC]], linked to the end of the [[Old Kingdom]] in Egypt, and the [[Akkadian Empire]] in Mesopotamia, various archaeological cultures in Persia and China 
* 1800-1500 BC [[Middle Bronze Age Cold Epoch]], a period of unusually cold climate in the North Atlantic region
* Bond Event 2 – possibly triggering the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]]
* 900 – 300 BC [[Iron Age Cold Epoch]] cold in North Atlantic
* 250 BC – 400 AD [[Roman Warm Period]]

===Common Era/AD=== 
* 250 BC–400 AD [[Roman Warm Period]]
* [[Climate changes of 535-536]] (535–536 AD), sudden cooling and failure of harvests, perhaps caused by volcanic dust

** 1656–1715 [[Maunder Minimum]] low sunspot activity
** 1790–1830 [[Dalton Minimum]] low sunspot activity, cold
** [[Year Without a Summer]] (1816), caused by volcanic dust
* 1850–present [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850]], [[instrumental temperature record]]
* Present and recent past [[global warming]], perhaps to be named the [[Anthropocene]] period

'''Malays in Egypt''' make up a part of the [[overseas Malays|overseas Malay]] population. [[Malaysian language|Malay speakers]] who came to [[Egypt]] are mainly from [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]]. In 1927, they started a newspaper, ''Seruan Azhar''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Indonesian and Malay Students in Cairo in the 1920s|journal=Indonesia|volume=9|date=April 1970|pages=73&amp;ndash;87|last=Roff|first=William R.|jstor=3350623|doi=10.2307/3350623|publisher=Southeast Asia Program Publications at Cornell University|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Malians in France''' consist of migrants from [[Mali]] and their descendants living and working in France. They are one of the [[diaspora]]s from [[Black Africa]] in France.

==History==
The first Malian immigrants came to France in the 1960s. At first, there were male workers from rural regions who came to find long-term employment in France. Then, in the 1970s, there were [[family reunification]]s, in which the wives and children of previous male immigrants came to live in France as well.&lt;ref name="grotius1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grotius.fr/migrations-et-liens-au-«-pays-d’origine-»-l’exemple-des-maliens-en-france/|title=Migration and links to the "country of origin": the example of Malians in France|publisher=Grotius.fr|language=fr|accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Most Malians in France are rural migrants who came from the [[Senegal River]] valley,&lt;ref name="grotius1"/&gt; and from the region of [[Kayes Region|Kayes]]&lt;ref name="lemonde1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2013/01/18/qui-sont-les-maliens-de-france_1818961_3224.html |title=Qui sont les Maliens de France ? |publisher=Lemonde.fr |date=2013-01-18 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the extreme south of [[Mali]], a very poor and arid region, at the frontier with [[Senegal]] and [[Mauritania]].

The first major study of the '''[[music]] of [[Bashkortostan]]''' appeared in 1897, when ethnographer [[Rybakov S.G.]] wrote ''Music and Songs of the Ural's Muslims and Studies of Their Way of Life''. Later, [[Lebedinskiy L.N.]] collected numerous folk songs in Bashkortostan beginning in 1930. The 1968 foundation of the [[Ufa State Institute of Arts]] sponsored research in the field.

The [[quray]] is the most important instrument in the Bashkir ensemble; it is made from a special reed found only in the [[Ural Mountains]].

The [[National Symphonic Orchestra of the Bashkortostan Republic]] was founded in 1992 under the leadership of [[Tahir Kamalov]].  It emerged as one of the major symphonies in late 20th century [[Russia]].

[[G. Gaskarav]], the first artistic leader of folk theatrical [[choreography]] of the Bashkir, founded a professional folk dance ensemble in 1939.  This band has travelled across much of the world.

Quray, the symbol of [[Bashkir people|Bashkir]] music is used in modern popular music too. [[Zahir Bayiq]] played some Enigma and own melodies (''Quray-Dance'' CD).

'''Nabagopal Mitra''' ({{lang-bn|নবগোপাল মিত্র}}) (1840–1894) was an Indian [[playwright]], [[poet]], [[essayist]], [[Patriotism|patriot]] and one of the founding fathers of [[Hindu nationalism]]. He founded the Hindu Mela (which was inaugurated by [[Rajnarayan Basu]] ) the pioneer institution behind the genesis of [[Hindu nationalism]]. Mitra also founded National Press,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Notes on the Bengal Renaissance|first=Amit |last=Sen|publisher=Peoples Publishing House|year=2014|url=https://archive.org/details/notesonthebengal035527mbp}}&lt;/ref&gt; National Paper, National Society, National School, National Theatre, National Store,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The centenary year of the war-cry: Vande Mataram|last=Saroj Kumar Mitra|publisher=Organiser|url=http://www.organiser.org/dynamic/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=92&amp;page=5}}{{deadlink|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; National Gymnasium and National Circus, earning him the sobriquet 'National Mitra'.

== Early life and influences ==
Nabagopal Mitra was born into a [[Bengali Hindu]] [[Kayastha]] family residing at Shankar Ghosh Lane, near Cornwallis Street in [[Kolkata]]. The year of birth is disputed. While most historians agree that he was born in 1840, in some sources his year of birth is recorded as 1841. From his early days he was very close to the [[Tagore family]]. [[Satyendranath Tagore]] and [[Ganendranath Tagore]] were his classmates at the [[Hindu School]]. Gradually he became a  close associate of [[Debendranath Tagore|Maharshi Debendranath Tagore]], the leader of the [[Adi Brahmo Samaj]] and [[Tattwabodhini Sabha]]. Maharshi Debendranath was conservative in outlook in comparison to [[Keshab Chandra Sen]]'s ultra-reformist stand. While Keshab Sen's philosophy was rooted in universalism, Maharshi Debedranath believed in reforms from a nationalist perspective. Nabagopal Mitra was heavily influenced by Maharshi Debendranath's thinking.

== Career ==

Nabagopal Mitra contended unity to be the fundamental criterion of [[nationalism]] and maintained that for the Hindus the basis of national unity has been the [[Hinduism|Hindu religion]]. He also attempted a definition of the Hindu nation. According to him, "Hindu nationality .. is not confined to Bengal. It embraces all of Hindu names and Hindu faiths throughout the length and breadth of Hindustan; neither geographical position nor the language is counted as a disability. Hindus are destined to be a religious nation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saha|first=Panchanan|title=Hindu-Muslim relations in a new perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=imxuAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA131|year=2007|publisher=Biswabiksha|isbn=978-81-901959-5-9|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National Paper ===

In 1867, Nabagopal Mitra started an English weekly called ''National Paper''. It was financed by [[Debendranath Tagore|Maharshi Debendranath Tagore]],.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guha-Thakurta|first=P.|title=The Bengali Drama: Its Origin and Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PnIh1m-gHf8C&amp;pg=PA145|year=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-24504-3|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even being the chief editor, Mitra purposefully never used grammatically correct [[English language|English]] in his columns. If somebody pointed out any grammatical error, he used to justify it by explaining that as English was not his [[mother tongue]], there is no harm if his article had any grammatical mistakes. According to him, it would be enough for someone if he is able to express himself in English, even though it may not be grammatically correct. Mitra's disdain and contempt for the language of the oppressors, essentially a trait inherited from his mentor [[Debendranath Tagore|Maharshi Debendranath Tagore]], had to reflect in the media, and that remained a key deciding factor in the choice of the language when then weekly was launched.

===Hindu Mela===

{{Main|Hindu Mela}}

In 1867, the National Paper published the ''Prospectus of a Society for the Promotion of National Feeling among the Educated Natives of Bengal'' by [[Rajnarayan Basu]]. Inspired by this booklet Nabagopal Mitra founded the Hindu Mela and the National Society in 1867. The mela was first known as the Jatiya Mela.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Datta|first=Amaresh|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: Devraj to Jyoti|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zB4n3MVozbUC&amp;pg=PA1578|year=1988|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-260-1194-0|page=1578}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He requested [[Jyotirindranath Tagore]] to recite poems he composed at the Hindu Mela.

Young [[Swami Vivekananda|Narendranath]] used to visit the Hindu Mela.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Swami Vivekananda: Patriot-Prophet|last=Dr. Bhupendranath Datta|publisher=Nababharat Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Gymnasium===

At the [[Hindu Mela]], Nabagopal Mitra laid much emphasis on gymnastics, wrestling and other traditional sports. In 1868, he opened a [[gym|gymnastic school]] at his own residence, which he named ''National Gymnasium''. It became very popular and within a few years the school produced a number of physical education teachers. In the early 1870s the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal [[George Campbell (1824–1892)|George Campbell]] formulated a new educational policy. According to this new system, European style [[gym]]nasiums were set up in the government schools and colleges. The gymnasium of the [[Presidency University, Kolkata|Hindu College]] was equipped with [[parallel bars]], [[horizontal bar]], [[trapeze]] etc. The eldest son-in-law of Nabagopal Mitra was the instructor. Mitra, realising the usefulness and necessity of the European equipments, attempted to assimilate them within the Indian tradition. So, at the ''National Gymnasium'', while the emphasis was more on physical exercises, [[Pehlwani|wrestling]], [[sword fighting]] and stick wielding, gradually modern equipments like bars and [[trapeze]] were introduced. Mitra even employed a [[United Kingdom|British]] trainer to train the Bengali Hindu pupils in European style gymnastics.

Apart from the physical training, the institution was also instrumental in imparting the first lessons of nationalism to the future leaders of India. The foremost amongst them were [[Bipin Chandra Pal]], Sundari Mohan Das and Raj Chandra Chaudhuri. [[Swami Vivekananda]] too, in his early life had joined the National Gymnasium. Once a [[United Kingdom|British]] sailor was hit by the toppled pole of trapeze at the gym and became unconscious. Many of the onlookers fled but young [[Swami Vivekananda|Narendranath]] and his friends took courage and nursed the sailor for a few days until he was revived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chattopadhyaya|first=Rajagopal|title=Swami Vivekananda in India: A Corrective Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EtcoeaQIQdAC&amp;pg=PA22|year=1999|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=978-81-208-1586-5|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National School===

In 1872, Mitra founded the National School in the premises of the Calcutta Training Academy at 13, Cornwallis Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ghatak|first=Kamal Kumar|title=Hindu Revivalism in Bengal: Rammohan to Ramakrishna|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=okgqAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA39|year=1991|publisher=Minerva Associates (Publications)|isbn=978-81-85195-35-3|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institution was set up for the cultivation arts, music and physical training. The courses at the National School were overtly technical including drawing, modelling, geometrical drawing, architectural drawing, engineering and surveying. Shyamacharan Srimani became the chief teacher of the arts curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Chatterjee|first=Partha|title=Texts of Power: Emerging Disciplines in Colonial Bengal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WIa-A2bM3n0C&amp;pg=PA66|year=1995|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-2687-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kalidas Pal, the founder of India's first art journal 'Shilpa Puspanjali' too joined the National School as a faculty.{{afnp|Chatterjee|1995|page=76}}

===National Theatre===

{{Main|Dramatic Performances Act}}

Nabagopal Mitra was instrumental behind the formation of National Theatre in 1872. The name National Theatre was first suggested by Mitra. On 7 December 1873 the group staged their maiden play [[Nildarpan]]. The staging was hailed as 'an event of national importance' by Mitra in the National Paper.

===National Circus===

Mitra had utilized his entire assets for the establishment of the pioneering national institutions. Finally he mortgaged his residence in order to raise money for the National Circus, the pioneer institution that spread the culture of acrobatics, gymnastics and physical culture in India and acted as the precursor to the highly renowned and successful Great Bengal Circus founded by [[Priyanath Bose]]. [[Ram Chandra Chatterjee]], the pioneer balloonist and parachutist began his career as an acrobat at the National Circus.

Mitra founded the National Circus in June, 1881 at 10-2, Cornwallis Street.

'''Nepalese Muslims''' ({{lang-ne|नेपाली मुसलमान}}; ''Nepali Musalman'') are people residing in [[Nepal]] who follow the religion of [[Islam]]. Their ancestors arrived in Nepal from different parts of [[South Asia]], [[Central Asia]] and [[Tibet]] during different epochs, and have since lived amidst the numerically dominant Hindus and Buddhists. About 97% of the Muslim community live in the [[Terai]] region, while the other 3% are found mainly in the city of [[Kathmandu]] and the western hills. The community numbers 971,056, about 4.4% of the total population of [[Nepal]]. Districts with large Muslim population include [[Sarlahi District|Sarlahi]] (9.9%), [[Rautahat District|Rautahat]] (17.2%), [[Bara District|Bara]] (11.9%), and [[Parsa District|Parsa]] (17.3%) in the central Terai bordering the state of [[Bihar]], [[Kapilvastu District|Kapilbastu]] (16.8%) and [[Banke District|Banke]] (16%) in the western Terai and [[Siraha District|Siraha]] (7%) and [[Sunsari District|Sunsari]] (10%) and [[Saptari District|Saptari]] (10%) eastern Terai.&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding Nepal : Muslims in a plural society'' by Mollica Dastider {{ISBN|978-81-241-1271-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims have lived in Nepal for long period of time and have shared common historical experiences with the [[Hindu]] majority, and as such have developed a stronger identification with the Nepali state. However, the Terai Muslims, on the other hand, like other Terai communities, also continue to have strong ties across the border and receive cultural sustenance from the larger Muslim population of [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Bihar]]. Nepali historians believe that the first Muslims settled in Kathmandu during King [[Ratna Malla]]'s reign in the late 15th century. Kashmiri traders were probably the first Muslims to arrive, followed by Afghans, Persians and even Arabian. The  Bajar in Indra Chok gets its name from the Iraqi merchants. 

The [[Chaubisi Rajya|Chaubise]] [[raja]]s of west Nepal also employed Afghan and Indian Muslims to train Nepali soldiers to use firearms and ammunition. Ratna Malla's envoy to Lhasa invited Kashmiri Muslims to Kathmandu in an attempt to profit from the rugs, carpets, shawls and woollen goods they traded between Kashmir, Ladakh and Lhasa. The first batch of Muslims came with a Kashmiri saint who built the first mosque, Kashmiri Taquia, in 1524, writes Shamima Siddika in her book Muslims of Nepal. 

Influenced by the system of Mughal courts in Delhi, the Mallas also invited Indian Muslims to work as courtiers and counsellors-leading to rivalry with Newar nobles of the Malla courts. While the Muslim courtiers did not last long and returned to India, other Muslims stayed on. The Mallas also got Indian Muslims from the Mughal Empire to join their courts as musicians and specialists on perfumes and ornaments. Historian Baburam Acharya believes they were also there to protect King Ratna Malla from rebellious relatives and senior court officials. 

Following Nepal's unification, King Prithvi Narayan Shah also encouraged Muslim traders to settle down with their families. Besides trade, the Muslims from Afghanistan and India were experts in manufacturing guns, cartridges and canons, while others were useful in international diplomacy because of their knowledge of Persian and Arabic. 

Many Muslims, especially Kashmiri traders, are said to have fled to India during the economic blockade that Prithvi Narayan Shah imposed on the Valley. Fearing persecution from a Hindu king due to their religion and their ties with the Mallas, the traders left despite assurances that they would come to no harm. By 1774, only a handful of Kashmiri merchants remained. Even so, Kashmiri traders proved to be a great help during the unification process. Historians say that [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] employed them as spies and informants as they had personal contacts with the Malla rulers. After his victory, he gave them permission to build a mosque, now near Tri-Chandra Campus (Nepali Jame Masjid, Ghantaghar). 

During [[Jang Bahadur Rana]]'s regime, a large number of Muslims migrated to the tarai from India fleeing persecution by the British army during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Sepoy Mutiny in 1857]]. These refugees settled in the tarai, selling leather goods or working as agricultural labourers. A senior courtier to Delhi Emperor [[Bahadur Shah Zafar]] also fled to Kathmandu. Later, he renovated the Jama Masjid and was buried there. During the Sepoy Mutiny, [[Begum Hazrat Mahal]], wife of Nawab [[Wajid Ali Shah]] of Lucknow also escaped to Kathmandu via Nepalganj and was allowed by Jang Bahadur to take refuge in Nepal. She settled down at the Thapathali Durbar, and later died in Kathmandu and was also buried at the Nepali mosque.

== Classification ==

The history of the Muslim community in Nepal is in fact the history of three distinct groups, the '''Tibetans''', '''Kashmiris''' and the [[Madhesi people|Madhesi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.himalmag.com/component/content/article/3033-How-the-cresent-fares-in-Nepal.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320064521/http://www.himalmag.com/component/content/article/3033-How-the-cresent-fares-in-Nepal.html |archivedate=2012-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kashmiri Muslims ===

According to the Vamshavalis, [[Kashmiri Muslims]] arrived in Kathmandu during the reign of King Rama Malla (1484-1520 AD). They built a mosque, the Kashmiri Takia, and engaged in different occupations such as scribes to correspond with the [[Sultanate of Delhi|Delhi Sultanate]], and as scent manufacturers, musicians and bangle suppliers. Some were admitted as courtiers to the Malla durbar, and many traded with [[Tibet]]. The descendants of these migrants live in Kathmandu, numbering about two thousand. They tend to be well-educated and speak a mixture of [[Nepali language|Nepali]] and [[Urdu]] at home rather than Kashmiri. Many Kashmiri Muslims of Kathmandu are also fluent in [[Newari language|Newari]]. While many work as petty businessmen, some have joined government service or entered politics. {{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The Kashmiri merchants who first arrived in the 1970s set up curio shops in Kathmandu´s tourist quarters. There has been a spurt in arrivals from [[Srinagar]] since the political turmoil in [[Jammu and Kashmir]] escalated in 1990. Many shopkeepers arrived with their stocks of handicrafts, rugs and furs. These recent arrivals have little or no interaction with the older Muslim residents, and most do not even know that there is an old Kashmiri Muslim stock in Kathmandu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.himalmag.com/component/content/article/3033-How-the-cresent-fares-in-Nepal.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320064521/http://www.himalmag.com/component/content/article/3033-How-the-cresent-fares-in-Nepal.html |archivedate=2012-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tibetan Muslims ===

Muslim migrants of [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] origin include both [[Ladakh]]is and those from [[Tibet]] proper. The latter arrived mostly after the Chinese Communist takeover in 1959, and in their language and dress these Tibetan Muslims are indistinguishable from their Tibetan Buddhist counterparts. Today, many are engaged in the trade of Chinese consumer durables and selling curios. On the whole, this groups tends to be more affluent than the other Muslim communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.himalmag.com/component/content/article/3033-How-the-cresent-fares-in-Nepal.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320064521/http://www.himalmag.com/component/content/article/3033-How-the-cresent-fares-in-Nepal.html |archivedate=2012-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of the [[Tibetan Muslims]] is that of a unique community, that has blended different cultural strains to forge a distinct identity, that has been kept alive even in the face of adversity. According to the community,s traditions, Islam arrived almost a thousand years ago in Tibet, a region that has always been synonymous with a monolithic Buddhist culture. Sometime in the 12th century, it is believed, a group of Muslim traders from Kashmir and Ladakh came to Tibet as merchants. Many of these traders settled in Tibet and married Tibetan women, who later converted to the religion of their husbands. Author Thomas Arnold, in his book, The Preaching of Islam says that gradually, marriages and social interactions led to an increase in the Tibetan Muslim population until a sizable community came up around Lhasa, Tibet’s capital.&lt;ref&gt;''The Preaching of Islam by Sir Thomas W. Arnold'' {{ISBN|978-81-7151-259-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Muslim society in the Terai region is organized along the principles of caste, but differs in many respects from the [[caste]] system found among the Madhesi [[Hindus]]. Although Muslim groupings are [[endogamy|endogamous]], and there are elements of hierarchy, there is no religious and ideological principles providing foundation for the concept of caste. For example, there is no question of ritual pollution by touch or restriction on interdinning. But each grouping does maintain a separate and distinct identity, especially with regards intermarriage. Below is a brief description of the larger groupings:&lt;ref&gt;Caste Hierarchy and Interethnic Stratification in the Muslim Society of Nepal by Shanker Thapa Tribhuvan University Journal Volume XVIII, June 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Madhesi Muslims ===
{{see|Madhesi people}}
While the smaller groups provide diversity, the largest community of Islam adherents, more than 74 percent—of the Muslims are found in the [[Madhesh]] region, a narrow [[Terai]] plain lying between the lower hills of the [[Himalaya]] and the border with [[India]]. Concentrated in the Madhesh districts of Banke, Kapilvastu, Rupandehi, Parsa, Bara and Rauthat, some of the [[Madhesi people|Madhesi]] Muslims were present here at the time of Nepal´s unification while others migrated from India, [[Pakistanis in Nepal|Pakistan]], Afghanistan, Turkey, Arabia, Tibet, Egypt, Persia from the 19th century onwards as wage labourers. While most are small-time proprietor farmers, a substantial number still work as tenants and agricultural labourers. At home they do speak [[Urdu]], but also [[Awadhi language|Awadhi]], [[Bhojpuri language|Bhojpuri]] and [[Maithili language|Maithili &amp; Nepali]] depending on whether they are of the Western or Central or Eastern [[Madhesh]].&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding Nepal : Muslims in a plural society'' by Mollica Dastider {{ISBN|978-81-241-1271-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Muslim society in the Madhesh (Terai) region is organized along the principles of caste, but differs in many respects from the [[caste]] system found among the Madhesi [[Hindus|Nepali Hindus]]. Although Muslim groupings are [[endogamy|endogamous]], and there are elements of hierarchy, there are no religious and ideological principles providing a foundation for the concept of caste. For example, there is no question of ritual pollution by touch or restriction on interdining. But each grouping does maintain a separate and distinct identity, especially with regard to intermarriage. Below is a brief description of the larger groupings:&lt;ref&gt;Caste Hierarchy and Interethnic Stratification in the Muslim Society of Nepal by Shanker Thapa, Tribhuvan University Journal Volume XVIII, June 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of Madhesh-based Muslim communities reside in the Kathmandu valley and are the leaders of a revival and reform of Islam informed by global Islamist discourses and enabled and promoted by petrodollars and new technologies of communication linking them with Muslims communities around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sijapati|first1=Megan Adamson|title=Islamic Revival in Nepal: Religion and a New Nation|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=London and New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement has both religious and political dimensions (though the two intertwine significantly in Islam), each represented by distinct organizations with their internal hierarchies and rules for membership. They provide scholarships for Muslim youth, support for mosques and madrases, and religious trainings. These organizations have centers in the Terai as well, but the national centers are in the Kathmandu valley. Their ideological influences range from the Muslim Brotherhood, to Salafism, to the Jamaat-e Islami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sijapati|first1=Megan Adamson|title=Mawdudi’s Islamic Revivalist Ideology and the Islami Sangh Nepal|journal=Studies in Nepali History and Society|date=June 2012|volume=17|issue=No. 1|pages=41–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Northern Italy''' ({{lang-it|'''Italia settentrionale'''}} or just {{lang|it|'''Nord'''}}) is a geographical [[region]] in the northern part of [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Castagnoli|first=Adriana|title=Culture politiche e territorio in Italia: 1945-2000|year=2004|publisher=Angeli|location=Milano|isbn=978-8846452337|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-administrative, it consists of eight administrative [[Regions of Italy|Regions]] in northern Italy: [[Aosta Valley]], [[Piedmont]], [[Liguria]], [[Lombardy]], [[Emilia-Romagna]], [[Veneto]], [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] and [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]].&lt;ref name="Mangiameli"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mangiameli|first=Stelio|title=Il regionalismo italiano tra tradizioni unitarie e processi di federalismo|year=2012|publisher=Giuffrè|location=Milano|isbn=978-8814174131}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, its population was 27,801,460. [[Rhaeto-Romance]] and [[Gallo-Italic languages]] are spoken in the region, as opposed to the [[Italo-Dalmatian languages]] spoken in the rest of Italy.

For statistic purposes, the [[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica]] (ISTAT) uses the terms [[Northwest Italy]] and [[Northeast Italy]] for two of Italy's five statistical regions in its reporting. These same subdivisions are used to demarcate first-level [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics]] (NUTS) regions ("NUTS 1 regions") within the [[European Union]], and the Italian constituencies for the [[European Parliament]].

== Name ==

[[File:Flag_of_Padania.svg|thumb|Flag of [[Padania]] proposed by [[Lega Nord]]]][[File:Flag_of_Northern_Italy.png|thumb|Proposed politically neutral flag for Northern Italy]]Northern Italy was called by different terms in different periods of History. During ancient times the terms Cisalpine Gaul, Gallia Citerior or Gallia Togata were used to define that part of [[Italy]] inhabited by [[Celts]] ([[Gauls]]) during the 4th and 3rd centuries BC. Conquered by the [[Roman Republic]] in the 220s BC, it was a [[Roman province]] from c. 81 BC until 42 BC, when it was merged into Roman Italy. Until that time, it was considered part of [[Gaul]], precisely that part of Gaul on the "hither side of the [[Alps]]" (from the perspective of the Romans), as opposed to [[Gallia Narbonensis|Transalpine Gaul]] ("on the far side of the Alps").

After the fall of the Roman Empire and the settlement of the [[Lombards]] the name Langobardia Maior was used, in the [[Early Middle Ages]], to define the domains of the [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Lombard Kingdom]] in Northern Italy. The Lombard territories beyond were called Langobardia Minor, consisting of the Duchies of [[Duchy of Spoleto|Spoleto]] and [[Duchy of Benevento|Benevento]].
During the [[Late Middle Ages]], after the fall of the northern part of the Lombard Kingdom to [[Charlemagne]], the term Longobardia was used to mean Northern Italy within the medieval [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]]. As the area became partitioned in regional states the term Lombardy subsequentially shifted to indicate only the area of the Duchies of [[Duchy of Milan|Milan]], [[Duchy of Mantua|Mantua]], [[Duchy of Parma|Parma]] and [[Duchy of Modena and Reggio|Modena]] and later only to the area around [[Lombardy|Milan]].

In [[Modern history|late modern period]] the term High Italy (Alta Italia) was widely used, for example by the [[National Liberation Committee for Northern Italy|Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale Alta Italia]] during the [[second World War]]. Starting from the 1960s the term [[Padania]] was sometimes used as geographic synonym of [[Po Valley]]. The term was appeared sparingly until the early 1990s, when [[Lega Nord]], a federalist and, at times, separatist political party in Italy, proposed "Padania" as a possible name for an independent state in Northern Italy. Since then, it has carried strong political connotations.

==History==

===Antiquity and Early Middle Ages===
[[File:Gallia_Cisalpina-fr.svg|thumb|Ancient peoples of Northern Italy, with [[Celtic peoples]] shown in blue.]]
In pre-Roman centuries it was inhabited by different peoples among whom the [[Ligures]], the ancient [[Adriatic Veneti|Veneti]], who prospered through their trade in amber and breeding of horses, the [[Etruscans]], who colonized Northern Italy from [[Tuscany]], founded the city of [[Bologna]] and spread the use of writing; later, starting from the 5th century BC, the area was invaded by [[Celts|Celtic – Gallic tribes]]. These people founded several cities like [[Turin]] and [[Milan]] and extended their rule from the Alps to the Adriatic Sea.
Their development was halted by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman expansion]] in the Po Valley from the 3rd century BC onwards. After centuries of struggle, in 194 BC the entire area of what is now Northern Italy became a Roman province with the name of [[Gallia Cisalpina]] ("Gaul on the inner side (with respect to Rome) of the Alps").
The Roman culture and language overwhelmed the former civilization in the following years, and Northern Italy became one of the most developed and rich areas of the western half of the empire with the construction of a wide array of roads and the development of agriculture and trade. [[File:Longobardi.jpg|thumb|left|Migration of the [[Lombards]] towards Northern Italy]]In late antiquity the strategic role of Northern Italy was emphasized by the moving of the capital of the Western Empire from Rome to [[Mediolanum]] in 286 and later to [[Ravenna]] from 402 until the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|empire collapsed in 476]].

After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire|Western Empire]], Northern Italy suffered heavily from destruction brought about by [[Migration Period|migration from Germanic peoples]] and from the [[Gothic War (535–554)|Gothic War]]. In the 570s the Germanic [[Lombards]], or Longobardi, entered Northern Italy from [[Friuli]] and founded a [[Lombard Kingdom|long-lasting reign]] (with its capital in [[Pavia]]) that gave the medieval name to the whole Northern Italy and the current name to the Lombardy region. 
After the initial struggles, relationships between the Lombard people and the Latin-speaking people improved. In the end, the Lombard language and culture assimilated with the Latin culture, leaving evidence in many names, the legal code and laws, and other things. The end of Lombard rule came in 774, when the [[Franks|Frankish]] king [[Charlemagne]] [[Siege of Pavia (773–74)|conquered Pavia]], deposed [[Desiderius]], the last Lombard king, and annexed the Lombard Kingdom to his empire changing the name in [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]]. The former [[Lombard Duchies|Lombard dukes]] were mostly replaced by Frankish counts, prince-bishops or marquises.

===High Middle Age and Renaissance===
[[File:Member Cities of the Lombard Leagues.png|thumb|Member cities of the first and second Lombard League.]]
In the 10th century Northern Italy was formally under the rule of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] but was in fact divided in a multiplicity of small, autonomous city-states, the [[medieval communes]] and [[maritime republic]]. The 11th century marked a significant boom in Northern Italy's economy, due to improved trading and agricultural innovations, culture flourished as well with many universities founded, among them the [[University of Bologna]], the oldest university in Europe. 
The increasing richness of the city-states made them able to defy the traditional feudal supreme power, represented by the German emperors and their local vassals. This process led to the creation of different [[Lombard League]]s formed by allied cities of Lombardy that defeated the Hohenstaufen Emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa|Frederick I]], at [[Battle of Legnano|Legnano]], and his grandson [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], at [[Battle of Parma|Parma]], and becoming virtually independent from the German emperors. 
The Leagues failed to develop from an alliance to a lasting confederation and subsequently, among the various local city-states, a process of consolidation took place; most of them became lordships ruled by powerful families like the [[Della scala|Della Scala]] of [[Verona]] or the [[House of Visconti|Visconti]] of [[Milan]], and conquered neighboring cities threatening to unify Northern Italy under a single state. [[File:Italy_1494_shepherd_detail.jpg|thumb|left|Northern Italy after the Peace of Lodi]]In the end a balance of power was reached in 1454 with the [[Peace of Lodi]] and Northern Italy ended up divided between a small number of regional states, the most powerful were the Duchies of [[Duchy of Savoy|Savoy]], [[Duchy of Milan|Milan]], [[Duchy of Mantua|Mantua]], [[Duchy of Ferrara|Ferrara]] and the Republics of [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], which had begun to extend its influence in the mainland from the 14th century onwards.

In the 15th century Northern Italy became one of the centres of the [[Renaissance]] whose culture and works of art were highly regarded. The enterprising class of the communes extended its trade and banking activities well into northern Europe and "[[Lombard banking|Lombards]]", the term that designated the merchants or bankers coming from northern Italy, were present in all of Europe.
The [[Italian Wars]] between 1494 and 1559 ended the North Italian Renaissance and brought the region to be fought between [[House of Valois|France]] and the Spanish and Austrian [[House of Hapsburg]]. After the war Northern Italy became under direct or indirect control of [[Spanish Empire|Spain]].
At the same time [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] control of the eastern Mediterranean and the [[Age of Discovery|discoveries of sea routes]] to Asia around Africa and of the Americas led to the decline of the Venetian Republic.
Pestilences, like that of [[Great Plague of Milan|1628/1630]], and the generally declining conditions of Italy's economy in the 17th and 18th centuries halted the further development of Northern Italy. The only state that managed to thrive in this period was the Duchy of Savoy that thanks to military and diplomatic victories in 1720 became the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and increased Turin's importance as a European capital.


===Modern history===
[[File:Iron_Crown.JPG|thumb|The [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]], used by Napoleon to symbolize authority over Northern Italy]]
After the [[French Revolution]] in the late 18th century Northern Italy was conquered by the French armies, many client republics were created by [[Napoleon]] and in 1805 a new [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]], made of all of Northern Italy but [[Piedmont]] that was annexed to [[First French Empire|France]], was established with Milan as capital and Napoleon as head of state.
In the [[congress of Vienna]], the Kingdom of Sardinia was restored, and furthermore enlarged by annexing the Republic of Genoa to strengthen it as a barrier against France. The rest of Northern Italy was under [[Austrian Empire|Austrian rule]], either direct like in the [[Lombardo-Venetian Kingdom]] or indirect like in the Duchies of [[Duchy of Parma|Parma]] and [[Duchy of Modena and Reggio|Modena]]. [[Papal Legations|Bologna and Romagna]] were given to the [[Papal State]].
The Austrian imperial government was unpopular because of their anti-liberal politics and Northern Italy became the intellectual centre leading the [[Risorgimento|Italian unification process]]. Piedmont and the Kingdom of Sardinia, in particular, was the state that launched Italy's unification in 1859–1861. After [[Second Italian War of Independence|defeating the Austrians in 1859]] and annexing Northern Italy the new state proceeded to launch a campaign to [[Spedizione dei Mille|conquer Southern and Central Italy]] and Turin briefly became the capital of the [[Kingdom of Italy|whole of Italy]].[[File:Partigiani_sfilano_su_automezzi_a_Bologna.jpg|thumb|left|Anti-Fascist Partisans in the streets of Bologna after the general insurrection of April 1945]]

After Italian unification the capital was moved from Turin to [[Rome]] and the administrative and institutional importance of Northern Italy was deeply reduced. However, from the late 19th century and especially with the [[Economic miracle|economic boom of the 1950s–1960s]], Northern Italy and especially the cities of Turin, Genoa and Milan was the most important region in the [[Second Industrial Revolution|Italian industrialization]] and sharpened its status of richest and most industrialized part of Italy.
Between 1943 and 1945, during the [[Second World War]], Northern Italy was part of the [[Fascism|Fascist]] [[Italian Social Republic]] and the main theatre of the [[Italian resistance movement|anti-fascist partisan activity]]. Between April 19, 1945, and April 25, the cities of Northern Italy began an [[Liberation Day (Italy)|insurrection]] against fascist and nazist forces that lead to the liberation of Northern Italy by Allied forces. 
[[Economy of Italy|Economic differences]] between Northern Italy and the rest of the country, as well as the short history of Italy as a single nation, led in the 1990s to the emergence of [[Padanian nationalism]], as [[Lega Nord]] promoted either [[secession]] or larger [[autonomy]] for Padania, the name chosen to represent Northern Italy.


==Geography==
[[File:Val_Maira.png|thumb|The Alps in [[Val Maira]], [[Province of Cuneo]]]]
Northern Italy is made of the basin of the [[Po (river)|River Po]], which comprises the whole of the broad plain extending from the foot of the [[Apennines]] to that of the [[Alps]], together with the valleys and slopes on both sides of it, the [[Venetian Plain]] and the [[Ligurian Sea|Ligurian]] coast.
Northern Italy has the Alps as northern and western boundary and the Apennine Mountains as the southern one. In between the two mountain ranges lies a large plain made of the Venetian Plain and the [[Po Valley|valley of the Po]], the largest river in Italy, which flows 652&amp;nbsp;km eastward from the [[Cottian Alps]] to the [[Adriatic Sea]] and receives all the waters that flow from the Apennines northwards, and all those that descend from the Alps towards the south. The Po Valley is the largest plain in Italy and held the vast majority of North Italian population.
[[File:Bassa_Bolognese_-_Sant'Agata_Bolognese,_Bologna,_Italia_-_18_Giugno_2015.jpg|thumb|left|Farming landscape in the Po Plain at [[Sant'Agata Bolognese]]]]
The Alps are home to some worldwide-known mountains like the [[Matterhorn]] (Cervino), [[Monte Rosa]], [[Gran Paradiso]] in the eastern Alps, and [[Bernina Range|Bernina]], [[Stelvio Pass|Stelvio]] and [[Dolomites]] along the eastern side of the Alps. The highest peak in Europe is [[Mont Blanc]], at 4,810 meters above sea level, located at the border with [[France]].

With the exception of Liguria all of Northern Italy lies in the drainage basin of the Adriatic Sea (with rivers Po, [[Piave (river)|Piave]], [[Adige]], [[Brenta (river)|Brenta]], [[Tagliamento]], [[Reno (river)|Reno]]) though the waters from some border municipalities ([[Livigno]] in Lombardy, [[Innichen]] and [[Sexten]] in Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol) drain into the [[Black Sea]] through the basin of the [[Danube]], and the waters from the [[Lago di Lei]] in Lombardy drain into the [[North Sea]] through the basin of the [[Rhine]].

On the foothills of the Alps there are a number of subalpine moraine-dammed lakes, the largest of which is [[Lake Garda|Garda]]. Other well known of these subalpine lakes are [[Lake Maggiore]], whose most northerly section is part of [[Switzerland]], [[Lake Como|Como]], [[Lake Orta|Orta]], [[Lake Lugano|Lugano]], [[Lake Iseo|Iseo]], [[Lake Idro|Idro]].

===Climate===
[[File:Lago_di_Orta.jpg|thumb|Alpine lakes like [[Lake Orta]] are characterized by warmer [[microclimate|microclimates]] than the surrounding areas]]
The climate of Northern Italy is mainly [[humid subtropical]] ([[Köppen]] Cfa), especially in the plains. Winter in Northern Italy is normally long, rainy and rather cold. In addition, there is a high seasonal temperature variation between Summer and Winter. In the hills and mountains, the climate is [[humid continental]] ([[Köppen]] Dfb). In the valleys it is relatively mild, while it can be severely cold above 1,500 mt, with copious snowfalls. The coastal areas of Liguria generally fit the [[Mediterranean climate]] profile. In the Alpine foothills, characterised by an [[Oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen]] Cfb), numerous lakes exercise a mitigating influence, allowing the cultivation of typically Mediterranean crops (olives, [[citrus fruit]]).

A peculiarity of the regional climate is the thick [[fog]] that covers the plains between October and February, especially in the central Po Plain. The east coast, from [[Romagna]] to [[Trieste]] is occasionally affected by the cold [[bora (wind)|bora]] winds in winter and spring.
[[File:Nebbia_sul_fiume_Secchia_a_Campogalliano.jpg|thumb|left|Fog on the [[Secchia]] River near [[Modena]]. Fog is a common occurrence in the Po Plain]]
The coldest month is January: the [[Po valley]]'s mean temperature is between −1–1&amp;nbsp;°C. Winter morning lows can occasionally reach −30 to −20&amp;nbsp;°C in the Alps and −14 to −8&amp;nbsp;°C in the Po valley. Summer is usually more stable with July temperatures are 22–24&amp;nbsp;°C north of river Po, like in [[Milan]] or [[Venice]], and south of river Po can reach 24–25&amp;nbsp;°C like in [[Bologna]].

while the number of days with lows below 0&amp;nbsp;°C is usually from 60 to 90 a year, with peaks of 100–110 days in the mainly rural zones.&lt;ref&gt;http://sbegotti.altervista.org/immagini/Album/Galaverna301205/Galaverna301205.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the colder winters, the [[Venice Lagoon]] may freeze, and in the coldest ones even enough to walk on the ice sheet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.libreriasolaris.com/Venicepast/veniceonice.html |title=Venice on ice |publisher=Libreriasolaris.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011008090844/http://www.libreriasolaris.com/Venicepast/veniceonice.html |archivedate=2001-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Precipitation evenly distributed during the year, although the summer is usually slightly wetter. is more intense in the [[Prealpine]] zone, up to 1,500 to 2,000&amp;nbsp;mm annually, but is abundant also in the plains and Alpine zones, with an average of 600 to 850&amp;nbsp;mm annually. The total annual rainfall is on average 827&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regional Statistical Yearbook: average rainfall, yearly and ten-year average, Lombardy and its provinces.|url=http://www.asr-lombardia.it/ASR/lombardia-e-province/ambiente-e-territorio/clima-e-inquinamento/tavole/100157/|publisher=Regione Lombardia|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regione Lombardia. Retrieved 21 July 2015.
Snow is quite common between early December and early March in cities like Turin, Milan and Bologna, but sometime it appears in late November or late March and even April. Both the Alps and the Apennine can see up to 500–1,000&amp;nbsp;cm of snow in a year at 2,000 m; on the [[List of mountains of the Alps above 3000 m|highest peaks of the Alps]], snow may fall even during mid summer, and [[glaciers]] are present.

===Pollution===
Because of high industrialization and the lack of wind due to being closed between mountain ranges air pollution remains a severe problem in Northern Italy. Even if smog levels have decreased dramatically since the 1970s and 1980s, in 2005 a team of researchers at the [[Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute]] reported that Northern Italy was one of Europe's most polluted areas in terms of  [[smog]] and [[air pollution]] due to its climatic and geographic conditions, which cause the stagnation of  pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/view.php?id=15900 Natural Hazards] NASA.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
{{See also|Economy of Italy#North–South divide}}
Northern Italy is the most developed and productive area of the country, with one of the highest [[gross domestic product|GDPs per capita]] in [[Europe]]. It was the first part of Italy to become industrialised in the last half of the 19th century; the so-called ''industrial triangle'' was formed by the manufacturing centres of [[Milan]] and [[Turin]], as well as the seaport of [[Genoa]]. Since then, the industrial core of the area has shifted eastward; the current industrial triangle consists of [[Lombardy]], [[Veneto]], and [[Emilia-Romagna]]. A similar shift happened for GDP per capita, and the eastern regions (including Lombardy) have since become wealthier than [[Piedmont]] and [[Liguria]]. With a 2008 nominal GDP estimated at €772,676 million, Northern Italy accounts for 54.8% of the [[Economy of Italy|Italian economy]], despite having just 45.8% of the population.&lt;ref name="Mangiameli"/&gt;

[[File:Project Griffin.gif|right|220px|UK Project Griffin]]
'''Project Griffin''' was originally introduced by the [[City of London Police]] and [[Metropolitan Police]] in April 2004 to help "London's [[Financial services|financial sector]] better protect itself against terrorist threats".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gutcher |first=Lianne |url=http://www.sundayherald.com/business/businessnews/display.var.1874423.0.scottish_firms_get_message_on_counterterrorism.php |title=Scottish firms get message on counter-terrorism |publisher=Sundayherald.com |date= |accessdate=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since 
spread to businesses and security services as a way to get educated about [[counter-terrorism]] and crime prevention, be the 'eyes and ears' for the police and be prepared for major emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/nolpda/ifs_news/hi/newsid_4641000/4641550.stm |title=Police offer anti-terror training |publisher=BBC News |date=24 January 2006 |accessdate=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the program is to bring together the police, [[London Fire Brigade|fire brigade]], [[London Ambulance Service|ambulance services]], private security industry and other government agencies in deterring, disrupting and support operations targeting terrorist and [[Extremism|extremist]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cityoflondon.police.uk/CityPolice/CT/ProjectGriffin/ |title=Project Griffin |publisher=Cityoflondon.police.uk |date=29 April 2009 |accessdate=29 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021095211/http://www.cityoflondon.police.uk/CityPolice/CT/ProjectGriffin/ |archivedate=21 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, the program has spread across the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Singapore, South Africa and the United States.&lt;ref name=SFS&gt;[http://skillsforsecurity.org.uk/downloads/conference06/Don%20Randall%20-%20Project%20Griffin.pdf Private &amp; Public Sector Security Harmonisation]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A complementary program called ''''Project Argus'''' is also deployed across the United Kingdom. Project Argus focuses on "preventing, handling and recovering from a terrorist attack."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hai-resilience.co.uk/news.html |title=Press Release – 3rd November 2007 |publisher=Hai-resilience.co.uk |date=3 November 2007 |accessdate=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It takes participants through simulated but realistic terrorist attack for participants to learn what would likely happen in an attack, what are the priorities during an attack and to
have the necessary plans in place before an attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nactso.gov.uk/argus.php |title=Project ARGUS : Protecting Against Terrorist Attack |publisher=Nactso.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=29 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090526053549/http://www.nactso.gov.uk/argus.php |archivedate=26 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
There are 3 components to this program: Awareness Day, Bridge Call and Response.

=== Awareness Day ===
This is a one-day seminar where police members will attend to teach course participants various skills. Depending on [[jurisdiction]], these may include: [[explosives]], threats identification, [[crime scene]] preservation, [[bomb threat]] management, [[CBRN]] management, [[conflict resolution]], [[reconnaissance]], cordon management, crime reduction strategy and legal matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmp.police.uk/mainsite/pages/projectgriffin.htm |title=Campaigns and Initiatives:Project Griffin |publisher=Gmp.police.uk |date= |accessdate=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grampian.police.uk/Pdf/Prospectus.pdf Grampian Project Griffin]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staffordshire.police.uk/advice_zone/counter_terrorism/project_griffin/about_griffin |title=Staffordshire About Project Griffin |publisher=Staffordshire.police.uk |accessdate=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants who finish the entire course will be presented with a certificate and their name entered into a register in case for a deployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbp.police.uk/press_release/articles/2008%5CJanuary%5C29%5C1.htm |title=Counter-terrorism conference taking place in the Capital |publisher=Lbp.police.uk |date=29 January 2008 |accessdate=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bridge Call ===
Every week (or regular interval as determined by the police force), a [[conference call]] is placed for all participants to obtain any terrorism issues, crime or security issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nottsprepared.gov.uk/np_home/np-project-griffin-argus.htm Nottingham Project Griffin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202172542/http://www.nottsprepared.gov.uk/np_home/np-project-griffin-argus.htm |date=2 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, these information are [[police intelligence]] information for registered participants only.

=== Response ===
In the event of a major emergency or disaster, trained members will be deployed to support the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nottinghamshire.police.uk/newsandevents/news/2008/january/28/take_part_in_project_griffin/ |title=Take part in Project Griffin |publisher=Nottinghamshire.police.uk |date=22 September 2008 |accessdate=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They will be responsible for securing the cordon line and assist in evacuation if necessary. The response phrase differs from each jurisdiction as [[Legal liability|liability]], health and insurance coverage differ.&lt;ref name="SFS"/&gt;

==International Adoption==

===Australia===
[[Victoria Police]] Counter-Terrorism and Emergency Management Division adopted the project model to train [[security officers]] in threat identification and increase awareness in terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.busrisks.com.au/news.php?n=19 |title=Counter-Terrorism Training for Victoria |publisher=Busrisks.com.au |date=1 August 2007 |accessdate=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be called upon for emergency response in an event of a major incident such as a terrorist attack. These security officers will be responsible for [[access control]] and manning the police [[cordon sanitaire|cordon]] lines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.qut.edu.au/ljj/editions/v8n2/pdf/2_Legal_powers_private_security_personnel_SARRE.pdf The Legal Powers of Private Security Personnel: Some Policy Considerations and Legislative Options]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In February 2009, [[Vancouver Police Department]] adopted the project from the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vancouver.ca/police/Whatsnew/2009/ProjectGriffin.pdf Project Griffin Vancouver]&lt;/ref&gt; While similar in structure and function, the primary objective for the VPD is [[crime prevention]] and crime reduction instead of counter-terrorism. Private security firms, [[Vancouver Police Department#Community Policing Centres|Community Policing Centre volunteers]] and other [[Criminal record#Canada|security screened]] groups will participate on this project to receive the latest crime information and to assist police in an event of a major disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genesiscommunitypatrol.blogspot.com/2009/02/project-griffin.html |title=Genesis Community Patrol Project Griffin |publisher=Genesiscommunitypatrol.blogspot.com |date=27 February 2009 |accessdate=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singapore===

Termed 'Project Guardian', private security guards are trained and volunteer their service in case of a major emergency when terrorist targets are likely to occur, such as Exercise Heartbeat. [[Singapore Police Force]] disseminates information to registered volunteers on any safety and security development around the country. In an event of a street fight, they will assist police in [[crowd control]], traffic diversion, [[emergency evacuation|evacuation]] and cordon control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spf.gov.sg/cterror/pg_index.htm |title=Project Guardian |publisher=Spf.gov.sg |date= |accessdate=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
[[South African Police Service]] launched a pilot project in South Africa in 2007 to train private security in crowd control, securing crime scenes, reporting suspect vehicles, participate in weekly police briefings. Project participants will respond in an event of a major disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!--byline1--&gt;Rowan Philp: London &lt;!--byline0--&gt; |url=http://www.griffithsonline.co.za/mediadetail.php?id=20 |title=Security guards to partner police |publisher=Griffithsonline.co.za |accessdate=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other jurisdictions, these security guards will also participate in a non-emergency situation. For example, they form part of the security plan for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!--byline1--&gt;Borrie La Grange&lt;!--byline0--&gt; |url=http://www.thetimes.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=560416 |title=Police boss wants to press gang rent-a-cops |publisher=Thetimes.co.za |date=10 September 2007 |accessdate=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

[[New York City Police Department]] launched the program called 'NYPD SHIELD'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=German |first=Mike |url=http://www.securitymanagement.com/article/fighting-terrorism-u-k?page=0%2C3 |title=Fighting Terrorism in the U.K |publisher=Securitymanagement.com |date= |accessdate=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shield "is an umbrella program for a series of current and future Police Department initiatives that pertain to private sector security and counterterrorism. This is a public private partnership based on information sharing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypdshield.org/public/about.nypd |title=About the Shield program |publisher=Nypdshield.org |date= |accessdate=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program, unlike other jurisdictions, only pertains to information sharing and not the physical intervention in other programs. It was thought information sharing between police and businesses will educate business signs to look for and their potential for being targeted while serving as NYPD's 'eyes and ears'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypdshield.org/public/nexus.nypd |title=Operation Nexus |publisher=Nypdshield.org |date= |accessdate=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brownsea Island Scout Camp Church.JPG|thumb|Scouting and Guiding flags in St Marys Church, [[Brownsea Island Scout camp|Brownsea Island]]]]

'''Religion in Scouting''' and [[Girl Guide and Girl Scout|Guiding]] is an aspect of the [[Scout method]] that has been practiced differently and given different interpretations over the years.

In contrast to the [[Christian]]-only [[Boys' Brigade]], which started two decades earlier, [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]] founded the Scout movement as a youth organization (with boys as 'Scouts' and girls as 'Guides'), which was independent of any single [[faith]] or religion, yet still held that [[spirituality]] and a belief in a [[god|higher power]] were key to the [[Child development|development]] of young people.

Scouting organizations are free to interpret the method as laid down by the founder. As the modern world has become more [[secular]] and as many societies have become more religiously [[Multiculturalism|diverse]], this has caused misunderstandings and controversies in some of the national member organizations.

== Views of religion's place in Scouting ==

===Founder's views===

When creating the Scouting method, Baden-Powell was adamant that there was a place for God within it.

In [[Scouting for Boys]], Baden-Powell wrote specifically about Christianity, since he was writing for youth groups in the [[United Kingdom]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We aim for the practice of Christianity in their everyday life and dealings, and not merely the profession of theology on Sundays…&lt;ref name='Scouting for Boys'&gt;Scouting for Boys, Baden-Powell, [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Indeed, the [[Scout Promise]] as originally written by Baden-Powell states that Scout does their "duty to God".

However, the founder's position moved shortly after the Scout movement began to grow rapidly around the world, and his writings and speeches allowed for all religions. He did continue to emphasise that God was a part of a Scout's life, without dictating a particular faith:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When asked where religion came into Scouting and Guiding, Baden-Powell replied, It does not come in at all. It is already there. It is a fundamental factor underlying Scouting and Guiding.&lt;ref name = 'faqs'&gt;[http://www.faqs.org/faqs/scouting/rec.scouting.issues/section-11.html Baden-Powell's position on God and Religion], [http://www.faqs.org FAQs.org].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Though we hold no brief for any one form of belief over another, we see a way to helping all by carrying the same principle into practice as is now being employed in other branches of education…&lt;ref name='inquiry'&gt;[http://www.inquiry.net/ideals/b-p/religion.htm Baden-Powell on Religion] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115192441/http://www.inquiry.net/ideals/b-p/religion.htm |date=15 November 2006 }}, [http://www.inquiry.net/ Inquiry.net] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205052734/http://www.inquiry.net/ |date=5 December 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Take a negative instance. A Mahommedan Guider comes to England and addresses a lot of Girl Guides on religion, in the course of which she quotes Mahomet as the one divine teacher. This in spite of the fact that her audience are believers in Christ. How would you regard her action? As tactless, as insulting, as fanatical? At any rate it wouldn't be exactly polite or in accordance with our laws of courtesy. Yet I have known Christian Guiders as well as Scouters do exactly the same thing with Jews or Hindoos or people of other beliefs present, and these on their part have sat under it, too polite to raise objections but none the less made uncomfortable by it. Once, at a mixed gathering at a 'Scout's Own' a speaker carefully avoided much reference to Christ and was accused by some there of 'denying Him'. His defence was that he was rather following Christ in that he was showing Christian deference to the feelings of others who, equally with himself, were sons of one Father, under whatever form they rendered homage to God.&lt;ref name = 'guiding'&gt;[http://guidinguk.freeservers.com/B-P.html Guiding UK - miscellaneous - B.P.'s writings]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Baden-Powell's gravestone bears no cross or other religious symbol. Rather, in addition to the Boy Scout and Girl Guide Badges, it bears a circle with a dot in the centre, the [[trail sign]] for "Going home" / "I have gone home": &amp;nbsp; [[File:WikiProject Scouting going home symbol.svg|20px|I have gone home]].&lt;ref name='B-P`s Grave'&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pinetreeweb.com/bp-pix25.htm |title=B-P's Grave in Kenya |access-date=7 December 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061214110937/http://www.pinetreeweb.com/bp-pix25.htm |archive-date=14 December 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current interpretations===

Religion and spirituality is still a key part of the Scouting method. The two major world organizations have slightly different interpretations.

The [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]] (WOSM) states the following in its ''Fundamental Principles'':
:Under the title "Duty to God", the first of the above-mentioned principles of the Scout Movement is defined as "adherence to spiritual principles, loyalty to the religion that expresses them and acceptance of the duties resulting therefrom". Note that, by contrast to the title, the body of the text omits the word "God" to make clear that the clause also covers non-monotheistic religions, such as Hinduism, and those that do not recognize a personal God, such as Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scoutdocs.ca/Documents/Fundamental_Principles.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts]] (WAGGGS) stated the following in the 21st World Conference in 1972:
:The essence of Duty to God is the acknowledgement of the necessity for a search for a faith in God, in a Supreme Being, and the acknowledgment of a force higher than man of the highest Spiritual Principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| year =2000| url =http://www.wagggsworld.org/en/grab/16/1/1ExpSpirIntroduction.pdf| title =Exploring Spirituality - Resource Material for Girl Guides and Girl Scouts| format =PDF| work =| publisher =World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts| accessdate =2006-12-02| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060923073937/http://www.wagggsworld.org/en/grab/16/1/1ExpSpirIntroduction.pdf| archivedate =23 September 2006| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National organizations may further define it. For instance, the current Religious Policy of [[The Scout Association]] of the United Kingdom states that:&lt;br /&gt;
:*"make every effort to progress in the understanding and observance of the Promise to do their best to do their duty to God or to uphold Scouting’s values as appropriate
::*explore their faiths, beliefs and attitudes
::*consider belonging to some religious body;
::*carry into daily practice what they profess."&lt;ref name='por_religion'&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2014 | url = https://members.scouts.org.uk/documents/DocumentUpload/May2015/POR_May%202015_chapter2.pdf | title = The Religious Policy | work = Policy, Organization and Rules | publisher = The Scout Association | accessdate = 2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Scout/Guide groups are supported by local religious bodies, including Christian, Islamic, Jewish and Sikh communities. These local groups often have a more strict interpretation on the original writings of Baden-Powell concerning religion. However, since they often belong to national organizations that are not of a specific religion, there are usually groups in the neighbourhood that have a less strict interpretation.

Additionally, some national organizations are aimed at the adherents of a specific religion, but there usually are other Scouting/Guiding organizations within that country that are more open or have a more neutral point of view concerning religion.

The Scout Promise is easily adapted to accommodate these, and other, faiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| year =2006| url =http://scoutbase.org.uk/library/hqdocs/facts/pdfs/fs322016.pdf| title =The Promise| format =PDF| work =| publisher =The Scout Association| accessdate =2006-12-02| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20120716201239/http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/hqdocs/facts/pdfs/fs322016.pdf| archive-date =16 July 2012| dead-url =yes| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in its section on the [[Girl Scouts of the USA#Girl Scout Promise and Law|Girl Scout Promise and Law]], the website of the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] (GSUSA) includes a note that:
:The word "God" [in the Promise] can be interpreted in a number of ways, depending on one's spiritual beliefs. When reciting the Girl Scout Promise, it is okay to replace the word "God" with whatever word your spiritual beliefs dictate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2006 | url = http://www.girlscouts.org/program/gs_central/promise_law/| title = Girl Scout Promise and Law| format = | work = | publisher = Girl Scouts of the USA| accessdate = 2006-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership requirements==
"Duty to God" is a principle of worldwide Scouting and WOSM requires its member National Scout Organizations to reference "duty to God" in their Scout Promises (see [[Scout Promise#World Organization of the Scout Movement requirements|WOSM Scout Promise requirements]]). Scouting associations apply this principle to their membership policies in different ways. There are Scouting associations in some countries, such as France and Denmark, that are segregated on the basis of religious belief.

=== Boy Scouts of America ===
{{Main article|Boy Scouts of America membership controversies}}
[[File:Scout Sunday service Philadelphia 1949.png|thumb]]
The [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA) in the [[United States]] has taken a hard-line position in the past, excluding [[Atheism|atheists]] and [[Agnosticism|agnostics]].&lt;ref name="duty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsalegal.org/dutytogo-155.htm|work=BSA Legal Issues|title=Duty to God|publisher=Boy Scouts of America|accessdate=2006-12-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827022542/http://www.bsalegal.org/dutytogo-155.htm|archivedate=27 August 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BSA has come under strong criticism over the past years due to [[Boy Scouts of America membership controversies|their religious policy and stance against agnostics and atheists]]:&lt;br /&gt;
:"Declaration of Religious Principle.  The Boy Scouts of America maintains that no member can grow into the best kind of citizen without recognizing an obligation to God. In the first part of the Scout Oath or Promise the member declares, ‘On my honor I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country and to obey the Scout Law.’ The recognition of God as the ruling and leading power in the universe and the grateful acknowledgment of his favors and blessings are necessary to the best type of citizenship and are wholesome precepts in the education of the growing members."&lt;ref name="duty"/&gt;

The Boy Scouts of America has accepted [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] members and units since 1920, and also accepts members of various [[Pantheism|pantheistic]] faiths.  Many Buddhists do not believe in a [[Supreme Being|supreme being]] or [[creator deity]], but because these beliefs are still religious and spiritual in nature, they are deemed acceptable by the BSA since their leaders subscribe to the BSA Declaration of Religious Principle.

In March of 2016, the BSA signed a new Memorandum of Understanding with the Unitarian Universalist Association after many years of separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.uua.org/children/scouting/memorandum-understanding|title=Memorandum of Understanding|date=2016-03-14|work=UUA.org|access-date=2018-01-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MOU gives any Unitarian Universalist congregation the absolute authority over all phases of the program that affect the spiritual welfare of those who participate. The MOU specifically mentions Humanism and Earth-centered traditions as being acceptable faiths in Scouting programs chartered by Unitarian Universalist congregations. Since Humanist teachings specifically emphasize reliance on critical thinking and evidence over dogma and superstition, this MOU allows for atheist and agnostic members to join the BSA through Scout units chartered by Unitarian Universalist congregations. As part of the agreement in the MOU, the religious emblems developed by the Unitarian Universalist Association have been reinstated as of May, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.uua.org/children/scouting|title=Religious Recognition Awards for Unitarian Universalist Scouts|date=2015-01-22|work=UUA.org|access-date=2018-01-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scouts Canada ===
[[Scouts Canada]] states that all Scouts have what's called a "Duty to God", defined as "The responsibility to adhere to spiritual principles, and thus to the religion that expresses them, and to accept the duties therefrom".&lt;ref name="scdutytogod"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.scouts.ca/dnn/AboutUs/OurMissionPrinciplesandPractices/tabid/55/Default.aspx | title = Scouts Canada Mission Statement | publisher = Scouts Canada | accessdate = 2010-01-04 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091027190657/http://www.scouts.ca/dnn/AboutUs/OurMissionPrinciplesandPractices/tabid/55/Default.aspx | archivedate = 27 October 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the Scout promises for each age group include references to God such as the Beaver promise: "I promise to love God and help take care of the world." and the Scout/Venturer promise "...

===Girl Guides of Canada===
Girl Guides of Canada suggested a new version of their Promise that uses "my beliefs" instead of a direct references to God in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://terahertzatheist.ca/2009/05/14/girl-guides-make-progress/ | title = Girl guides make progress | publisher = Terahertz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Promise was approved in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://thestar.blogs.com/royals/2012/07/australian-girl-guides-drop-queen-and-god-from-pledge.html | title = Australian Girl Guides drop Queen and God from pledge |publisher=Toronto Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scouts Australia ===
In Australia, Scouting makes no effort to find out if potential child members are atheists or agnostics. One version of the Australian Scout promise contains "duty to my god" as opposed to "duty to God" used by many other countries, allowing each member to make an individual personal interpretation.

===Girl Guides Australia===
In 2012, the promise was reworded to have to "develop my beliefs" instead of a direct reference to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-07-05/girl-guides-drop-queen-god-from-promise/4113022 | title = Girl Guides drop Queen, God from promise | publisher = ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Scout Association in the United Kingdom ===
The Scout Association of the United Kingdom allows members of any religion, or no religion at all. Leaders, like all members, are not expected to be a member of any particular faith nor hold any religious belief of their own. They are, however, expected to abide by the Association's religious policy which promotes mutual acceptance of beliefs within the Movement such as by encouraging young Scouts to explore their own beliefs as well as making general provisions and considerations for members, such as giving them advice and guidance and allowing for the observance of religious practices within the Group. Previous to January 2014 it was necessary for all members of the Association to hold a faith, however this is no longer the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=POR Chapter 2|url=https://members.scouts.org.uk/documents/DocumentUpload/May2015/POR_May%202015_chapter2.pdf|website=Policy, Organisation and Rules|publisher=The Scout Association|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scouts of religions other than Christianity can choose from a selection of alternatively worded promises. Scouts of no religion can choose to make a promise that replaces "duty to God" with "to uphold our Scout values" followed by "to do my duty to the Queen".&lt;ref name="Alternative Scout Promise"&gt;{{cite web|title=The additional alternative Scout Promise FAQs|url=http://members.scouts.org.uk/fundamentals/?pageid=3385|work=The Scout Association FAQs|publisher=The Scout Association|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any member making their Promise can choose which version of the Promise they wish to do.

The change in policy followed a consultation conducted in 2012 to gauge support among members for an alternate atheist Scout promise, removing the invocation of a deity. At the same time, the Guide Association, the parallel movement which began two years later, is to launch a consultation about its very similar promise, with views sought on all parts of the wording from early January. TSA UK chief commissioner Wayne Bulpitt said religion would remain "a key element" even if a new variant of the promise was approved. Julie Bentley, chief executive of the Guide Association, said its consultation would begin on 3 January.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/dec/04/scouts-guides-consider-atheist-oaths Scouts and guides consider adopting atheist oaths]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1 September 2013 Girl Guiding UK introduced a new promise, in which members promise ‘to be true to myself and develop my beliefs’ replacing ‘to love my God’ &lt;ref name="Girl Guide UK New Promise"&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcoming more members with our new Promise|url=http://www.girlguiding.org.uk/news/welcoming_more_members_with_ou.aspx|work=Girl Guide UK Press release|publisher=Girl Guides UK|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-aligned Scouting organizations===
Approaches toward religion vary considerably in [[Non-aligned Scouting and Scout-like organizations|Scouting organizations not aligned with WOSM and WAGGGS]]. For example, the website of [[Camp Fire (organization)|Camp Fire]] states "We are inclusive, welcoming children, youth and adults regardless of race, religion, socioeconomic status, disability, sexual orientation or other aspect of diversity".&lt;ref name="cfusa_inclusive"&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| year =2005| url =http://www.campfire.org/all_about_us/core_values.asp| title =Core Values| format =| work =All About Us| publisher =Camp Fire USA| accessdate =2006-12-05| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070203134649/http://www.campfire.org/all_about_us/core_values.asp| archivedate =3 February 2007| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the [[American Heritage Girls]] are explicitly Christian and require all adult leaders to adhere to a specific [[creed|Statement of Faith]].&lt;ref name="ahg_sof"&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| year =2004| url =http://www.ahgonline.org/ahg/about/sof.php| title =Statement of Faith| format =| work =About Us| publisher =American Heritage Girls| accessdate =2006-12-05| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20061206100648/http://www.ahgonline.org/ahg/about/sof.php| archivedate =6 December 2006| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the AHG was founded by parents who did not agree with the Girl Scouts' decision to allow other words to be substituted for "God" in the Promise (see above) and the GSUSA's [[Girl Scouts of the USA#No official stand on sexuality issues|official lack of membership policies based on sexual preference]].&lt;ref name="ahg_ap"&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| year =2006| url =http://www.ppinw.org/pages.php?p=news&amp;id=6| title =Some Unhappy with Girl Scouts Form New Group| format =| work =| publisher =Associated Press| accessdate =2006-12-05| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20041021192840/http://www.ppinw.org/pages.php?p=news&amp;id=6| archivedate =21 October 2004| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scout groups handle religious practices in different ways.

Some Scouting organizations have many obligatorily religious merit badges&lt;ref name="badges vie chretienne FSE"&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| year =| url =http://www.scouts-europe.org/grandir/eclaireurs/4-progression/badges/badges-vie-chretienne.shtml| title =badges vie chretienne| work =| publisher =Guides et Scouts d’Europe| accessdate =2006-12-08| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070928092319/http://www.scouts-europe.org/grandir/eclaireurs/4-progression/badges/badges-vie-chretienne.shtml| archivedate =28 September 2007| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a way of fulfilling a requirement for a rank and others have a single voluntary religious merit badge or none at all.&lt;ref name="scouts insignes NL"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://www.scouting.nl/static/algemeen/insignes/scouts.html | title = insignes voor de Scouts | work = | publisher = Scouting Nederland | accessdate = 2006-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scouting organizations may recognise religious programs run by other organizations, like the [[religious emblems programs]] in the United States and Canada.

===Austria===
In [[Austria]], [[Pfadfinder und Pfadfinderinnen Österreichs]] is a member of both WOSM and WAGGGS.
The association is open to members without prejudice to birth, nationality, religion or belief. Both Promise and Law contain references to god.

There are [[chaplain]]s on national level for [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] and for [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] groups and members, as well as a commissioner for spirituality on national level. There can be chaplains on council- and group-level. Some groups are attached to religious communities or [[parish]]es; but even these are open to members of all denominations or religions.

There are religious merit badges. Requirements for awards include religion and spirituality.

===Belgium===
In Belgium, The association [http://www.lesscouts.be "Les Scouts"] offers a neutral Promise text,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| year =2014| url =http://www.lesscouts.be/animer/nos-principes-fondamentaux/la-promesse-et-la-loi-scoutes/| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20120417213934/http://www.lesscouts.be/animer/nos-principes-fondamentaux/la-promesse-et-la-loi-scoutes/| dead-url =yes| archive-date =2012-04-17| title =la Promesse et la Loi scoutes| format =| work =| publisher =Les Scouts - Fédération des scouts Baden-Powell de Belgique| accessdate =2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; with no mention to God. [[FOS Open Scouting]] replaced "duty to God" with "loyal to a higher ideal" in their promise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |url=http://www.fos.be/html/fos/download/Wet-en-Belofte.pdf |title=Wet en Belofte |format=PDF |work= |publisher=FOS Open Scouting |accessdate=2006-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021170214/http://www.fos.be/html/fos/download/Wet-en-Belofte.pdf |archivedate=21 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://www.sgp.be SGP] association (Scouts et Guides Pluralistes) offer that same text as an alternative to "God" or "my religion".

===Ireland===
[[Scouting Ireland]] is a member of WOSM. The association is open to members without prejudice to birth, nationality, sexual orientation, religion or belief. The Law contains no reference to God and members are offered three alternative variants of the promise, one which refers to God a second requiring that the member do their best to further their understanding and acceptance of a Spiritual Reality, and a third to uphold Scout Principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=[[scouts.ie]] |title=Promise &amp; Law |url=https://www.scouts.ie/Scouter/The-Scout-Method/Promise-Law/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jordan===
In [[Jordan]] the units are affiliated with the [[International Union of Muslim Scouts]].

===Malaysia===
In [[Malaysia]] Girl Guides working on their Bintang Anugerah Ketua Pesuruhjaya (Head Commissioner Award) must complete a requirement about their faith.

===Slovenia===
In [[Slovenia]], [[Zveza tabornikov Slovenije]] is a member of WOSM. The guiding principles include plurality, openness to members without prejudice to birth, nationality, religion or belief; provided the member abides by the principles of pacifism, personal freedom, high moral and ethical principles and principles of the international Scouting movement. In the promise the reference to God is replaced with "acceptance and development of Spiritual reality". No religious merit badges are in use.

A separate organization, [[Združenje slovenskih katoliških skavtinj in skavtov]] actively practices the Roman Catholic religion in its ranks. This organization is a member of WAGGGS. By agreement, the two organizations have a common highest level body and reciprocally provide to their members the benefits of membership in the two international organizations.

===United Kingdom ===

====The Scout Association====
All members of The Scout Association are encouraged to:&lt;ref name='por_religion'/&gt;
*make every effort to progress in the understanding and observance of the Promise to do their best to do their duty to God or to uphold Scouting’s values as appropriate
*explore their faiths, beliefs and attitudes
*consider belonging to some religious body;
*carry into daily practice what they profess.

If a Scout Group, Explorer Scout Unit or Scout Network is composed of members of several denominations or religions, the young people should be encouraged to attend services of their own form of religion.

In October 2012 an eleven-year-old atheist boy was denied entry to the Scouts in Somerset, England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2012 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/9617456/Schoolboy-banned-from-Scouts-for-being-an-atheist.html | title = Schoolboy 'banned from Scouts for being an atheist' | work = | publisher = The Telegraph Newspaper | accessdate = 2012-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1 January 2014, an alternative promise is available for those of no faith.&lt;ref name="Alternative Scout Promise" /&gt;

There are 2 activity badges relating to faith,  one for exploring the members own faith (my faith) and another for learning about several other faiths (world faiths) however both of these badges are optional.&lt;ref name="world-UK"&gt;{{cite web|title=World Faiths Activity Badge (cub)|url=https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/4332/world-faiths-activity-badge/?cat=12,67,776&amp;moduleID=10|publisher=Scouting Association|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="myfaith-uk"&gt;{{cite web|title=My Faith Activity Badge (cub)|url=World Faiths Activity Badge|publisher=Scouting Association|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=My Faith Activity Badge (Scout)|url=https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/4381/my-faith-activity-badge/?cat=7,64,779&amp;moduleID=10|publisher=Scouting Association|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Faiths Activity Badge (Scout)|url=https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/4381/my-faith-activity-badge/?cat=7,64,779&amp;moduleID=10|publisher=Scouting Association|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States of America ===
The Boy Scouts of America (BSA) celebrates [[Scout Sunday]] and [[Scout Sabbath]] in February,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://www.scouting.org/nav/enter.jsp?s=xx&amp;c=ds&amp;terms=sabbath&amp;x=32&amp;y=13 | title = A Scout is Reverent| format = | work = | publisher = BSA| accessdate = 2006-12-06}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Girl Scouts of the USA (GSUSA) celebrates similar holidays, known as Girl Scout Sabbath, Girl Scout Shabbat, and Girl Scout Sunday, in March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= |url=http://www.girlscouts.org/program/gs_central/gs_days/ |title=Girl Scout Days |format= |work= |publisher=GSUSA |accessdate=2006-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208064000/http://www.girlscouts.org/program/gs_central/gs_days/ |archivedate=8 December 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) includes Scouting as an official part of its religious program for boys and young men.  The LDS Church was the first institutional sponsor of the BSA in the USA, and currently sponsors more BSA units than any other organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://www.lds.org/pa/display/0,17884,5169-1,00.html | title = History of Scouting in the Church| work = | publisher = The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints| accessdate = 2009-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 9, 2018, the BSA announced that the LDS Church had decided to cease chartering BSA troops after January 1, 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first =| authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = https://scoutingwire.org/partnership-church-jesus-christ-latter-day-saints/ | title = Our Partnership with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints | work = | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = 2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Boy Scouts of America requires all Scouts to believe in a God or comparable higher power, but currently admits Scouts who are non-theistic [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], [[Jainism|Jains]], and [[Hindus]] from non-theistic sectarian groups.  The religious awards of all three faiths are recognized by The Boy Scouts of America.  The Girl Scouts of the USA does not have any requirement of faith or belief, and admits girls of any or no religious belief or doctrine, regardless of the presence or absence of belief in a God or comparable higher power.

Both organizations require their members to recite a pledge that includes a reference to God; the BSA pledge requires a commitment to do their "duty to God", while the GSUSA pledge asks girls "to serve God".  However, while GSUSA allows the elimination or substitution of "God" with an alternate word that represents a Scout's beliefs, BSA does not.

==== Boy Scouts of America ====
In Cub Scouting, each rank must complete a requirement about their faith. Additionally, members of the BSA's Scouting programs are eligible to work on their faith's [[Religious emblems programs (Boy Scouts of America)|religious emblem]].

=====Unitarian Universalist Association controversy=====
{{further|Unitarian Universalist Association}}
Currently, the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) has been the only religious emblems program, Religion in Life, to lose its BSA recognition. In 1992, the UUA stated its opposition to the BSA's policies on [[Boy Scouts of America membership controversies#Position on homosexuals|homosexuals]], [[Boy Scouts of America membership controversies#Position on atheists and agnostics|atheists, and agnostics]]; and in 1993, the UUA updated the Religion in Life program to include criticism of the BSA policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.uua.org/news/scouts/faith.html |title=The Boy Scouts, a Battle and the Meaning of Faith |accessdate=2007-05-09 |author=Gustav Niebuhr |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=1999-05-22 |work= |publisher=New York Times |pages= |language= |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212065426/http://archive.uua.org/news/scouts/faith.html |archivedate=12 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the BSA withdrew recognition of the Religion in Life program, stating that such information was incompatible with BSA programs. The UUA removed the material from their curriculum and the BSA renewed their recognition of the program. When the BSA found that the UUA was issuing supplemental material with the Religion in Life workbooks that included statements critical of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or personal religious viewpoint, the BSA's recognition was again withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Isaacson |first=Eric Alan |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |month= |title=Traditional Values, or a New Tradition of Prejudice?

On March 24, 2016, the Boy Souts of America and the Unitarian Universalist Association signed an historic Memorandum of Understanding to provide guidance to UU congregations who wish to sponsor Boy Scout troops. This move towards re-establishing organizational ties is due to the BSA’s recent policy changes making scouting more inclusive to gay scouts and gay scout leaders.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uua.org/pressroom/press-releases/uua-latest-religious-group-renew-ties-boy-scouts&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.uua.org/re/children/scouting&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sweden ===
In 1970, the Swedish [[Scout Promise]] was changed by [[Svenska Scoutförbundet]] from ''"I promise to do my best in performing my duty to God and the motherland, helping others, and following the [[Scout Law]]."'' to ''"I promise to do my best in following the Scout Law.''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scouterna.se/other-languages/en/about-scouting-in-sweden/the-scout-method-and-the-scout-law/|title=The Scout Method and the Scout Law {{!}} Scouterna|website=www.scouterna.se|language=sv-SE|access-date=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International religious bodies in Scouting and Guiding ==
A number of religions and denominations have formed international organizations within Scouting and Guiding that should further the spiritual development of their adherents. Most of these organizations employ two types of membership: individual and organizational.

The religious organizations include:
* [[International Union of Muslim Scouts]] (IUMS)
* [[International Catholic Conference of Scouting]] [http://www.cics.org (ICCS)]
* [[International Catholic Conference of Guiding]] (ICCG)
* [[World Buddhist Scout Council]] (WBSC)
* [[International Forum of Jewish Scouts]] [http://www.jewishscoutsforum.org (IFJS)]
* [[International Link of Orthodox Christian Scouts]] [http://www.desmos.info (DESMOS)]
* [[Council of Protestants in Guiding and Scouting]] (CPGS)
* ''Won''-Buddhism Scouts
* Sikh Scouts

ICCS, DESMOS, IUMS, WBSB, IFJS, CPGS enjoy consultative status with the [[World Scout Committee]], ICCG and CPGS with WAGGGS.

A number of non-religious associations, mainly from [[French language|French]] speaking countries, formed in 1996 the [[Union Internationale des Associations Scoutes-Guides Pluralistes/Laïques]] (UIPL; International Union of pluralist/secular Scout and Guide associations).

The Friends Committee on Scouting is a religious body of the [[Religious Society of Friends]] and serves Boy Scouts of America, Girl Scouts of the USA, Scouts Canada, [[Girl Guides of Canada]] and [[Camp Fire (organization)|Camp Fire]].

'''Richard Newsham''' (died 1743) was an [[England|English]] inventor. He took out 2 patents for fire engines in 1721 and 1725 (Royal Patent Office 1721 patent #439 and 1725 patent #479) and soon dominated the fire engine market in England.&lt;ref name="DaMu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dartmouthmuseum.org/collections/picture-archive/c/c0811.html|title=Town Fire Engine - Newsham Engine - Built 1734 - Bought 1872 - Used until 1906 - Dartmouth|publisher=[[Dartmouth Museum]]|accessdate=31 May 2012|quote=Richard Newsham of London, in 1725 patented "a new water engine for quenching and extinguishing fires".

The '''Rywin affair''' ({{lang-pl|afera Rywina}} was a [[political corruption|corruption]] scandal in [[Poland]], which began in late 2002 while the post communist government of the [[Democratic Left Alliance|SLD]] (Democratic Left Alliance) was in power. It is named after the prominent Polish film producer [[Lew Rywin]], who was a key figure.&lt;ref name="wbj1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbj.pl/?command=article&amp;id=21605&amp;|title=Rywin and Michnik go face to face in real-life courtroom drama|date=10 March 2004|publisher=Warsaw Business Journal|accessdate=2009-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chain of events ==
On 22 July 2002, Lew Rywin called in at the office of [[Adam Michnik]], editor of Poland's largest daily newspaper, ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]''. Rywin offered to arrange, in exchange for a bribe of 17.5 million [[USD]], a change in a draft law aimed at limiting the print media's influence on radio and television, which would have been in Michnik's favour – as the original draft would have prevented the paper's publishing house, [[Agora SA|Agora S.A.]] from taking over the private TV station [[Polsat]] or the second channel of Poland's public TV broadcaster [[Telewizja Polska|TVP]]. Rywin said he was acting on behalf of what he called a "group in power" which wanted to remain anonymous but possibly included then prime minister [[Leszek Miller]] of the post-communist [[Alliance of the Democratic Left|SLD]].

Michnik secretly recorded the conversation and started investigations to establish the identity of the "group in power". He also arranged a meeting between Miller, Rywin, and himself in Miller's office. When Miller denied any involvement in the deal Rywin had put forward, according to the other persons present, Rywin lost his composure and even spoke of committing suicide. Rywin himself later claimed to have been under the influence of alcohol.

Only after the ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]''{{'}} alleged investigations had remained inconclusive, on 27 December 2002 – half a year after the incident, which cast some doubts on the real role of the newspaper in the affair – the paper printed the partial record of Michnik's conversation with Rywin, thus starting the actual scandal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://serwisy.gazeta.pl/kraj/1,42985,1237212.html "Ustawa za łapówkę czyli przychodzi Rywin do Michnika"]&lt;/ref&gt; However other papers had reported parts of the story earlier (e.g. weekly magazine ''Wprost''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wprost.pl/ar/?O=13896 "Z życia koalicji"]&lt;/ref&gt;)

In January 2003, the Polish parliament ([[Sejm]]) created a special committee to conduct an investigation into the circumstances of the affair.

A separate penal prosecution resulted in Rywin being sentenced to two years in prison and a 100,000 [[Polish złoty|PLN]] fine on 26 April for 2004 fraud, as the court concluded that the "group in power" did not exist and Rywin had been acting on his own initiative. On 10 December 2004, the Warsaw court of appeals repealed this sentence, sentencing Rywin to a reduced term of two years for "paid protection" on behalf of a still anonymous group.

==Contradictory conclusions==
In the meantime, the protracted hearings of the Sejm's special committee continued. On April 5, 2004 the Sejm committee officially finished proceedings. With a majority vote supported by the [[Democratic Left Alliance|SLD]] and [[Samoobrona]] deputies to the committee, it adopted without prior discussion a final report which came to the same conclusion as the penal court - according to which Rywin had been acting completely on his own.&lt;ref name="wbj2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbj.pl/article-21998-rywin-commission-rywin-is-guilty-the-people-holding-power-are-innocent.html|title=Rywin Commission: Rywin is guilty, the people holding power are innocent|date=6 April 2004|publisher=Warsaw Business Journal|accessdate=2009-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the dissenting minority, including committee chairman [[Tomasz Nalecz|Tomasz Nałęcz]], refused to back the report and began to compile minority reports. The Sejm then had to decide whether to accept the committee's official final report or one of the various minority reports as the outcome of the investigation. On September 24, 2004, the Sejm unexpectedly voted to accept the minority report&lt;ref&gt;[http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/DetailsServlet?id=WMP20040410711 Internetowy System Aktów Prawnych]. Isap.sejm.gov.pl. Retrieved on 2013-09-07.&lt;/ref&gt; that most radically departed from the majority report and named the following persons as the masterminds behind Rywin's mission:
*prime minister [[Leszek Miller]] (stepped down in May 2004)
*Aleksandra Jakubowska, deputy minister of culture in Miller's government, who was also in charge of the amendment of the law that would possibly have benefited [[Agora SA|Agora S.A.]]
*Włodzimierz Czarzasty, another high-ranking [[Democratic Left Alliance|SLD]] media policy-maker 
*Robert Kwiatkowski, head of the Polish national public TV broadcaster [[Telewizja Polska|TVP]], the second channel of which was discussed to be privatized and a possible target for an [[Agora SA|Agora S.A.]] takeover
*Lech Nikolski, Miller's Chief of Cabinet, later in charge of the Polish EU membership referendum as minister without portfolio.

==Long-term impact on political culture==
The long-term impact of the affair on Poland's political culture has yet to be fully assessed. Certainly, it has once more reinforced {{Fact|date=April 2009}} the Polish population's already deeply rooted traditional suspicion of the state and politicians. Well-known former dissident [[Adam Michnik]]'s reputation has been damaged as he was suspected to be more deeply entangled in the scandal, although in what way remains unclear. His friendly relations with members of the former communist political establishment were exposed. This increased the numbers of Poles who are convinced that politicians and opinion-leaders are involved with the large-scale shadow economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/63436/1/EastEuropeanPolitics-Accepted%20Manuscript.pdf|title=Shadow Economy|accessdate=July 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While people were certainly satisfied when high-ranking politicians were supposedly revealed as masterminds, this has also disenchanted even more people away from politics: On the one hand, the supposed delinquents deny all accusations and cannot be held accountable; on the other hand, it was quite obvious that the Sejm's acceptance of the minority report, which claimed the involvement of high-ranking politicians, had itself been due to some clever tactics of the interested opposition factions and a certain inattentiveness of the [[Democratic Left Alliance|SLD]]. This created the impression that the opposition was not really interested in neutrally establishing the truth, either, but rather playing a power game of its own.  {{Fact|date=April 2009}}

The one person who seems to have benefited the most from the affair was [[Jan Rokita]], the representative of the largest opposition party [[Civic Platform|Civic Platform (''Platforma Obywatelska'')]] at the time and a member of the investigative committee, the hearings of which were broadcast live on TV. With his aggressive style of interrogation he made a name for himself as a tough investigator, thus establishing himself as the opposition's most important figure within a few months and at the time came to be considered as the most likely aspirant to the post of prime minister after a probable SLD election defeat in 2005. {{Fact|date=April 2009}}

Apart from that, the right-wing party [[Law and Justice|Law and Justice (''Prawo i Sprawiedliwość'')]], whose defining themes are the fight against crime and corruption, had benefited from the affair, which contributed to raising its public profile. It was the party's deputy [[Zbigniew Ziobro]] who had authored the radical minority report the Sejm had passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warsawvoice.pl/view/5770/|title=  President to Face the Music?  |date= 2 June 2004|publisher=The Warsaw Voice|accessdate=2009-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 2004, however, the Rywin affair had already being overshadowed by another scandal, which could have even more far-reaching effects: The so-called [[Orlen affair]] (''afera Orlenu'', ''Orlengate'') surrounding the privatization of the largely state-owned oil giant [[PKN Orlen]].

Against the background of these affairs, right-wing politicians, in particular from the [[Law and Justice]] party, began calling for an end to the post-1989 [[Poland|Third Republic]], which they consider inherently weak, morally corrupt and controlled by cliques. Law and Justice presidential candidate [[Lech Kaczyński]] and eventual winner called a "moral revolution", it should be completely replaced with a Fourth Republic, a "strong and moral state".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-warsaw.pl/new/index.php?dzial=aktualnosci&amp;ak_id=438&amp;kat=1 Warsaw – The Official Website of the Capital of Poland]. E-warsaw.pl. Retrieved on 2013-09-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fallout from the Rywin affair contributed to the SLD's massive defeat at the [[Polish parliamentary election, 2005|2005 parliamentary election]].  The SLD has never really recovered, and lost all of its remaining seats in 2015.

The general objectives of '''strategic urban planning''' (SUP) include clarifying which [[city]] model is desired and working towards that goal, coordinating public and private efforts, channelling energy, adapting to new circumstances and improving the living conditions of the citizens affected.

Strategic planning is a technique that has been applied to many facets of human activity; we have only to mention [[Sun Tzu]], Arthur Thomson or [[Henry Mintzberg]]; however, the application of strategic planning to urban contexts, or cities, regions and other [[metropolitan areas]] is a relatively recent development whose beginnings were eminently practical and artistical: a mixture of thought, techniques and art or expertise.

Fifteen years of practice proved to be enough time for the technique to spread and for the first “Meeting of American and European cities for the Exchange of Experiences in Strategic Planning” to be organized. Institutions sponsoring the meeting, held in [[Barcelona]] in 1993, included the [[Inter-American Development Bank]], the [[European Community]] Commission and the Iberoamerican Cooperation Institute. The cities of [[Amsterdam]], [[Lisbon]], [[Lille]], Barcelona, [[Toronto]] and [[Santiago de Chile]] participated, among others.

At that meeting it was demonstrated, along with other relevant aspects, that if cooperative processes are used in large cities in order to carry out strategic planning processes, and if a reasonable degree of comprehension is reached between the administration, businesses and an ample representation of social agents, organizational synergies will develop that will eventually improve resource management and citizens’ quality of life.

== History==
Strategic Urban Planning processes (SUP), also known as Urban Renewal Projects, began to appear at the end of the 20th century. The city of [[San Francisco]] (U.S.A.) carried out its process between 1982 and 1984. The main motivation behind starting strategic urban planning processes was the attempt to adequately react to problematic situations (mainly economic crisis or standstill). At the beginning of the 21st century, this kind of organization is not reactive but proactive. In the case of [[Spain]], crisis situations are not the main causes of these processes, rather they are motivated by the search for an improved level of public-private cooperation, the wish to coordinate activity, continued improvements, the wish to launch revitalization processes and even to follow others . The initial determination needed to launch this type of processes varies by region; in Spain, most processes are fronted by public entities, approximately 50%, while a significant percentage has mixed public-private leadership.

== Description of SUP processes==
An SUP process, according to Borja and Castells is:

''The definition of a city project that unifies diagnoses, specifies public and private actions and establishes a coherent mobilization framework for the cooperation of urban social actors. A participative process is a priority when defining contents, as this process will be the basis for the viability of the objectives and actions proposed. The result of the Strategic plan should not necessarily be the creation of regulations or a government program (although its adoption by the State and Local Government should mean the instigation of regulations, investment, administrative measures, policy initiatives, etc) but rather a policy contract between public institutions and civil society. For this reason, the process following the approval of the plan and the monitoring and implementation of measures or actions is just as or more important than the process of elaboration and consensual approval.''

SUP is now considered a type of [[Governance]].

== Basic Stages of an SUP process==
* Using the work of the Technical Secretary as a starting point, work groups debate and approve a diagnosis of the city that includes its localisation. The document must be approved by the Executive Committee, by the General Council or a full meeting of the Corporation as the case may be.
* Based on the diagnosis, and keeping in mind its antecedents and conclusions, strengths and weaknesses, the next step is the creation of scenarios and, based on the use of imagination and rigour, the development of prospective tasks related to the creation of future alternatives so that the Executive Committee can select a model or vision for the city. Their choice will be the basis for the generation of related key topics and/or directions for general actions to be taken.
* Once the work teams have been reorganized, mainly made up of key decision-makers and implementers, each key topic and line of action will be dealt with separately, designing a detailed list of necessary and/or advisable projects. Once the results have been consolidated, a prioritised list of projects will be made available from which a selection will be made. The next step is the elaboration of an action plan that includes the agents involved, timing and resources. The people involved in the structure of the process, at least theoretically, are capable of carrying it out; for an example, please consult the document from the General Council of SUP of Valencia [http://www.ceyd.org/acercade/plan/default.htm].
* Once all of the previously mentioned documents have been approved, the next step is implementation - carrying out the project itself. This stage is decisive; at this point plans are usually given a structure in which the organization is even more explicitly clarified.

== Implementation of SUP processes==
The social and economic importance of these processes is quite relevant as they affect millions of people [https://web.archive.org/web/20050101023909/http://www.cideu.org/site/] . In Spain, [http://www.ebropolis.es/web/index.asp] there are nearly one hundred localities that use this methodology, affecting a total population of nearly 15 million people.

== Critical Comments on SUP processes==
Sectors in the area of civic participation, as well as planning professionals and political activists have all expressed criticism of SUP processes.

However, SUP processes include aspects that favour selective participation, territorial organization and coordination/cooperation between public and private sectors. On the other hand, Strategic Urban Planning processes seem to be independent of political ideologies (for example, the SUP processes in Barcelona [http://www.bcn2000.es/en/default_en.aspx], Bilbao [http://www.bm30.es/] and Valencia [http://www.ceyd.org/acercade/plan/default.htm] are carried out with mixed Government teams including the following Spanish political formations: PSC-PSOE  [http://www.socialistes.cat/home/], PNV [http://www.eaj-pnv.eu/] and PP [http://www.pp.es/] respectively) and can produce a notable degree of stability in the majority behind the project.

== Theoretical Development==
Knowledge relating to strategic urban planning processes is evolving in two complementary directions that can be denominated, borrowing concepts from programming, as Bottom-Up and Top-down.

=== Bottom-Up===
There are clear differences between what could be called the traditional approach to Strategic planning and the emerging approach (Fernández Güell. Strategic planning of cities).
* Before Product predominance, now Process predominance
* Before Sector specific, now Integrated
* Before Normative, now Strategic
* Before Goal-oriented, now Cost-benefit oriented
* Before Urban-offer oriented, now Urban-demand oriented
* Before Subject to administrative limitations, now Supersedes administrative limitations and enters in Metropolitan areas
* Before Open participation, now Focused Participation

Of course, in 2006 there was a clear evolution that attempted to adapt to changes, political sensitivities and even trends. In any case, this is a line of thought and action that takes full advantage of the experience of projects that have already been implemented.

=== Top-Down===
Given that:
* The influence of each agent in the global process under consideration for implementation is yet to be determined;
* There are no generally accepted criteria when creating instruments for measuring progress or regression on the path toward achieving main goals;
* Cooperation processes among different agents within the city to carry out strategic planning are usually undertaken using a “framework” organisational structure which highlights differences;
* Both politics and outside events affect a large city;

this line of research seeks to further the design of a model that will determine the factors related to the success of strategic planning processes in large cities and metropolitan areas [https://web.archive.org/web/20090727100029/http://alarcos.inf-cr.uclm.es/per/fruiz/audes5/index.htm] [[:es:Aglomeraciones urbanas en la Unión Europea]] [[:es:Area Metropolitana]] [[:es:Área metropolitana de Valencia]].

Within this branch of research, which seeks a more general theory, two recent Doctoral Theses mentioned in the bibliography can be consulted for further information.

It should be pointed out that a theory explaining Strategic Urban Planning in Metropolitan Areas and/or Regions would involve furthering the consolidation of Social Design [[:es:Diseño Social]] as a scientific study.

A '''teeth cleaning twig''' or '''datun''' is a tool made from a twig from a tree. It can help to prevent [[tooth decay]] and [[gum disease]].

==History==
Chew sticks are twigs or roots of certain plants that are chewed until one end is frayed. This end used to brush against the teeth,&lt;ref name="origins"&gt;{{cite book|last=Panati|first=Charles|title=Extraordinary Origins of Everyday Things|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U662rR2VInQC&amp;pg=PA208|year=2013|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-227708-4|pages=208–209}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the other end can be used as a [[toothpick]].&lt;ref name="dentalb"/&gt; Most commonly plants are used that have a high content of [[Tannin|tannins]] ([[astringent]] and antibacterial) or other compounds that benefit the health of gums and teeth.&lt;ref name="wolf"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://we.riseup.net/assets/287592/primitive+toothcare.pdf|title=Primitive Toothcare: a DIY Guide to Uncivilized Oral Hygiene|last=Wolf, PhD|first=Rowan Walking|first3=|publisher=Yggdrasil Distro|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest chew sticks have been dated to Babylonia in 3500 BC&lt;ref name="dentalb"/&gt; and an Egyptian tomb from 3000 BC;&lt;ref name="origins"/&gt; they are mentioned in Chinese records dating from 1600 BC&lt;ref name="dentalb"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yu|first=Hai-Yang|last2=Qian|first2=Lin-Mao|last3=Zheng|first3=Jing|title=Dental Biotribology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tsSqVeaHUv0C&amp;pg=PA19|year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4614-4550-0|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Tipitaka]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://suttacentral.net/an5.208 Dantakaṭṭha sutta (AN 5.208)] Mahāsaṅgīti Tipiṭaka Buddhavasse 2500&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Pali Canon|Buddhist Canon]], purported to be giving account of events which took place in the north-western India around the 5th century BC.

In Africa, chew sticks are made from the tree ''[[Salvadora persica]]'', also known as the "toothbrush tree".

In Islam, this tree is traditionally used to create a chew stick called [[miswak]], as frequently advocated for in the ''[[hadith]]'' (written traditions relating to the life of [[Muhammad]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/search/miswak|title=Search Results - miswak (page 1) -  Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|work=sunnah.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional [[Sikh]]s still use datun today as it is written in their scriptures:

{{quotation|ਦਾਤਨ ਕਰੇ ਨਿਤ ਨੀਤ ਨਾ ਦੁਖ ਪਾਵੈ ਲਾਲ ਜੀ ॥ (੨੩)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;("Dear/beloved, natural twig brush everyday and pains you shall never get.

Teeth  cleaning twigs can be obtained from a variety of tree species. Although many trees are used in the production of teeth cleaning twigs, some trees are better suited to clean and protect the teeth, due to the chemical composition of the plant parts. The tree species are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.batplants.co.uk/neemtree.htm |title=Neem tree as teeth cleaning twig |publisher=Batplants.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturaltoothbrush.com/ |title=Natural twigs used as teeth cleaning twigs |publisher=Naturaltoothbrush.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neem-products.com/neem-twig.html |title=Neem tree as teeth cleaning twig 2 |publisher=Neem-products.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturallygreen.co.uk/natural-toothbrush-twig-natural-p-122.html |title=Natural toothbrush twigs |publisher=Naturallygreen.co.uk |date=2007-09-15 |accessdate=2011-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/dental-care/news/article.cfm?c_id=1500935&amp;objectid=10446594 |title=Natural toothbrush overview |publisher=Nzherald.co.nz |date=2007-06-19 |accessdate=2011-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payer.de/quellenkunde/quellen122.htm|title=Xuanzang (玄奘) &lt;603 - 664&gt;: Buddhist records of the Western world (大唐西域記), book VIII/IX.|website=www.payer.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carrying==
Many companies produce special cases for carrying, storing and protecting chew sticks, known popularly as "miswak holders".

==Advantages and disadvantages==
When compared to toothbrushes, teeth cleaning twigs have several advantages:
* More ecological in its life-cycle
* Lower cost (0-16% of the cost of a toothbrush&lt;ref name="NZH"/&gt;)
* Independence from external supplier if made at home from privately owned trees
* Low maintenance, with some twigs needing moistening with water if they become dry, to ensure the end is soft. The end may be cut afresh to ensure hygiene, and should not be stored near a sink. The twig is replaced every few weeks to maintain proper hygiene.
* No need for toothpaste

On the other hand, different species of trees have various levels of hardness just as synthetic toothbrushes would, so careful selection of the right hardness is required before use. Excessive scrubbing too can also bring the risk of gum damage.&lt;ref name="NZH"/&gt;

'''Tehmina Durrani''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|تہمینہ درانی}}}}; born 18 February 1953) is a [[Pakistan]]i author, artist, and activist on [[Women's rights|women's]] and [[Children's rights|children]]'s [[Human rights|rights]]. Her first book, "My Feudal Lord" (1991), shocked the conservative Pakistani society because of the sensational exposure of her politically famous but abusive husband, Mustafa Khar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newsweekpakistan.com/evolution-of-an-icon/|title=Evolution of an Icon|date=2013-07-05|work=Newsweek Pakistan|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her three-year tenure of service alongside [[Abdul Sattar Edhi|Abdul Satar Edhi]] was transformational and life changing. It also resulted in her authoring his (narrated) autobiography, "A Mirror to the Blind" (1996). The influence of Edhi spurred her into social work and inspired her to establish the 'Tehmina Durrani Foundation', with a mission to further Edhi's way of "humanitarianism", and his vision of Pakistan as a Social Welfare State.&lt;ref name="Mission and Vision – TDF"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tehminadurranifoundation.org/mission-and-vision/|title=Mission and Vision – TDF|last=|first=|date=|website=www.tehminadurranifoundation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, she is married to politician [[Shahbaz Sharif]].

== Life ==
Tehmina Durrani, born and raised in Karachi, Pakistan, is the daughter of a former Governor of State Bank of Pakistan and Managing Director of Pakistan International Airlines, [[Shahkur Ullah Durrani]]. Tehmina Durrani's paternal grandfather was Major Muhammad Zaman Durrani&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tehminadurranifoundation.org/happy-things-in-sorrow-times/|title=Happy Things in Sorrow Times – TDF|website=www.tehminadurranifoundation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Tehmina's mother, Samina Durrani, is the daughter of Nawab Sir [[Liaqat Hayat Khan]], the prime minister of the former princely state of Patiala. Sir Liaqat Hyat Khan's brother, Sir [[Sikandar Hayat Khan (Punjabi politician)|Sikandar Hayat Khan]], was a pre-1947 Punjab Premier, a statesman and leader. 

At seventeen, she married Anees Khan, and they had one daughter together. Durrani and Khan divorced in 1976. Durrani later married [[Ghulam Mustafa Khar]], a former [[Chief Minister of Punjab, Pakistan|Chief Minister]] and [[Governor of Punjab, Pakistan|Governor of Punjab]]. Khar had been married five times. Durrani and Khar had four children. After being abused by Khar for several years, she ended her marriage of fourteen years&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/society-the-arts/story/19910630-tehmina-durrani-if-he-can-treat-his-own-women-this-way-how-will-he-treat-the-nation-814486-1991-06-30|title=Tehmina Durrani: If he can treat his own women this way, how will he treat the nation?|website=India Today|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; in divorce.

In 1991, Durrani wrote an autobiography titled ''My Feudal Lord'' alleging abuse by Khar.&lt;ref name="The Evil That Men Do"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,170879,00.html|title=The Evil That Men Do |first=HANNAH |last=BLOCH  |date=20 August 2001 |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; She argued in the book that the real power of feudal landlords, like Khar, is derived from the distorted version of [[Islam]] that is supported by the silence of women and of society as a whole.&lt;ref name="Tehmina Durrani"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sawnet.org/books/authors.php?Durrani+Tehmina|title=Tehmina Durrani|publisher=sawnet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a reaction to her expository book, her family on both the paternal and maternal sides disowned her and her five children for thirteen years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tehminadurranifoundation.org/profile-of-the-founder-of-tdf/|title=Founder TDF – TDF|website=www.tehminadurranifoundation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years after leaving her second husband, Khar, one prominent event was her hunger strike in 1993 against government corruption, and the newly coined term, 'accountability', came into being. After seven days she was admitted to hospital and it was only when the prime minister of Pakistan, Moin Quraishi, visited her to break her fast did she do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tehminadurrani.com/jehad.html|title=Tehmina Durrani|website=tehminadurrani.com|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Years with Abdul Sattar Edhi ====

After many years of political exposure through her ex-husband, Mustafa Khar, who was a political leader, and in her struggle against corruption, she realized that the answers she was seeking would not come through politicians. In her search for someone who was in touch with the problems of the common man, and who had found a solution, she found Pakistan's most celebrated humanitarian, Abdul Sattar Edhi.

She moved in with the Edhi family and spent three years serving at Edhi Homes in Mithadar, Sorab Goth, and Kharadar, Karachi. She became his apprentice, and also got his permission to author his autobiography. These years shadowing Edhi sahab were a thesis for the dissertation of the book. These years were perhaps her most transformational as they laid the seeds for her further work as well as her spiritual quest for truth. "While I tied coffins to abandoned babies, stepped over corpses, and drove with him in a ‘peoples’ ambulance, I recorded the thoughts, inspirations, motives, observations, views and works of Pakistan's most revered and renowned social reformer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tehminadurranifoundation.org/profile-of-the-founder-of-tdf/|title=Founder TDF – TDF|website=www.tehminadurranifoundation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, '''‘''A Mirror to the Blind’''''', Mr. Edhi's official ‘narrated’ autobiography, was endorsed and published by the Edhi Foundation. 

In 2003, Durrani married thrice-elected Chief Minister of Punjab, [[Mian Shahbaz Sharif]]. They were married in a private ceremony in [[Dubai]], United Arab Emirates. Durrani resides in Lahore with her husband, who is a part of the politically prominent [[Sharif family]], and the brother of [[Nawaz Sharif]], the Ex- [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1067028|title=Features: Shahbaz wedding: political fallout |date=11 February 2005 |last=Haider |first=M. |access-date=8 October 2015 |newspaper=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.arabnews.com/?page=4&amp;section=0&amp;article=58668&amp;d=8&amp;m=2&amp;y=2005|title=Shahbaz Sharif Marries Tehmina |newspaper=[[Arab News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_24-2-2005_pg1_5 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050517191744/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_24-2-2005_pg1_5 |archive-date=17 May 2005 |title=Shahbaz confirms marriage to Tehmina |date=24 February 2005 |publisher=[[Daily Times (Pakistan)]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''My Feudal Lord'' rights dispute ==
In June 1991, ''My Feudal Lord'' was released by [[Vanguard Books]], a company owned by the journalists [[Najam Sethi]] and [[Jugnu Mohsin]]. Durrani denied she signed a contract vesting complete foreign rights with Mohsin rather than with herself and her estate.&lt;ref name=I&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-5001473.html |title=My feudal lords Amnesty honoured him with its Journalism Under Threat award, but in Pakistan Najam Sethi is still persecuted |author=Peter Popham |date=20 July 1999 |work=The Independent |publisher= {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dispute was settled in 1992.

On 19 May 1999, Durrani accused Sethi of stealing her book profits. She said, "[his actions were] an even bigger case of hypocrisy than my experience with the feudal system." At the time, Sethi was being detained without charge by [[Intelligence Bureau (Pakistan)]] for his comments to a [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] news team about government corruption. Durrani sued Sethi for mental torture, and he countersued for defamation. A review of the book contracts by the [[England|English]] newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'' described Sethi as acting in good faith and described him and Mohsin as "the injured party".&lt;ref name=I /&gt;

== Activist - Acid attacks on women ==
Since 2005, Durrani has supported the social rehabilitation of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pakistantimes.net/2005/02/07/top10.htm |title=Punjab's ex-CM Shahbaz Sharif confirms Marriage with Tehmina Durrani |publisher=[[Daily Times (Pakistan)]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903203917/http://pakistantimes.net/2005/02/07/top10.htm |archivedate=3 September 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Durrani cared for [[Fakhra Younus]], a former wife of Bilal Khar, the son of Khar from his third marriage. Younus had been attacked with acid, allegedly by her husband. Durrani's arrangements to take Younus abroad captured media attention. Younus was denied a passport to leave Pakistan but under public pressure was later allowed to leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa33/006/2002/en/|title=Amnesty International Document – Pakistan: Insufficient protection of women|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durrani engaged the Italian cosmetics firm Sant' Angelica and the government of Italy to treat Younus.&lt;ref name="The Evil That Men Do"/&gt; Smile Again, an Italian NGO head by Clarice Felli entered [[Pakistan]] to assist in the care of mutilated women.

== Tehmina Durrani Foundation ==
Founded in 2015, Tehmina Durrani Foundation (www.tehminadurranifoundation.org) officially launched it's activities in January, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newsweekpakistan.com/tehmina-durrani-launches-social-welfare-movement/|title=Tehmina Durrani Launches Social Welfare Movement|date=2017-01-10|work=Newsweek Pakistan|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tehmina Durrani explains, "We are picking the mission of Edhi, where he left. His duty was to serve the humanity without distinction of caste and creed – and so is ours.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1307673|title=Tehmina Durrani Foundation – ‘extension of Edhi model’|last=Reporter|first=The Newspaper's Staff|date=2017-01-11|work=DAWN.COM|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Establishing Pakistan as a Social Welfare State.
# Teaching the Edhi ideology of humanitarianism, tolerance, and service to others less privileged. 
# Women's empowerment through economic independence. 
# Protection and rehabilitation of the children of war.

== Author - Selected works==
===''My Feudal Lord'' (1991)===
Her most famous book, which was an overnight best seller and sensation in Pakistan as well as around the world. It is based on her life. Tehmina Durrani was born into one of Pakistan's most aristocratic families. Her parents married her to Anees Khan when she was seventeen and they had a daughter together. While married, she met Mutafa Khar, an eminent Pakistani politician, who along with Bhutto founded the PPP political party. Tehmina and Khar got married after she divorced, but their honeymoon period turned bitter very quickly. The intense and grotesque abuse is described vividly in her book with gory details. She was brave enough to expose her then famous husband publicly in an extremely conservative Pakistani Muslim society. She paid a heavy price for it because she was shunned by society and her own parents disowned her. Her rebellious nature also cost her losing all financial support from her ex-husband, as well as the custody of her children. It did make her search for answers for the position of women within Islam and made her stand up for women's rights. 

As no publisher was willing to take the liability of such a controversial book, she initially printed it herself, and after it became a hot selling book, it was published by Vanguard books. ''My Feudal Lord'' has been translated into 40 languages and has received many awards.&lt;ref name="The Evil That Men Do" /&gt;

===''A Mirror to the Blind'' (1996)===

Durrani's second book, ''A Mirror to the Blind'', is the biography of [[Abdul Sattar Edhi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lifelong mission of mercy|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1269692|publisher=dawn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was Pakistan's highly decorated social worker. Over a three-year period, Durrani lived in Edhi's home and accompanied him on his visits. The book was published in 1996 by the National Bureau of Publications with the [[Edhi Foundation]]. It is the official document [[Abdul Sattar Edhi]]'s life and message.&lt;ref name="Tehmina Durrani"/&gt;

===''Blasphemy'' (1998)===
Her third book, ''Blasphemy'' (1998), was successful but also controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tehmina Durrani: 'My family disowned me for 13 years' |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/512049/my-family-disowned-me-for-13-years/ |newspaper=[[Express Tribune]] |accessdate=11 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the novel she describes the secret lives of the Muslim clergy and spiritual leaders or ''pirs''. Durrani said that the story is factual, with some names and events altered to protect the identity of the women who are at the center of the story. The book also delves into a critical approach to the tradition and practice of [[Nikah Halala]]. She describes several cases resulting in the humiliation and torture of Muslim women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hvk.org/articles/1198/0036.html |title=Blasphemy |publisher=hvk.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505060802/http://www.hvk.org/articles/1198/0036.html |archivedate=5 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also made it into Pakistan's best-seller list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expressindia.com/news/ie/daily/19981023/29650064.html |title=Of pir power and peccadilloes: Blasphemy exposes the rot within |publisher=[[Express India]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115120822/http://www.expressindia.com/news/ie/daily/19981023/29650064.html |archivedate=15 January 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Happy Things in Sorrow Times'' (2013)===

Durrani's fourth book "Happy Things in Sorrow Times" (2013) is a novel based on the childhood and youth of an Afghan girl Rabia. The novel was published by Pakistani Publishing group Ferozsons. In contrast to Blasphemy that is based on the issue of domestic violence, Hypocrisy of religious figures in rural Sindh (Pakistan), and distortion of Islamic values, this novel explores the dynamics of Afghan politics in the pre/post 9/11. The setting of the novel is Afghanistan and Pakistan. However, the protagonist of the novel is an Afghan girl. The novel critiques interventions of Russia and America in Afghanistan. This is the first novel where Durrani uses her artwork as well.

== Artist ==
Tehmina Durrani is also a painter. She says she found another way of expressing and conveying her feelings through art, in addition to writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tehminadurrani.com/artist.html|title=Tehmina Durrani|website=tehminadurrani.com|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her first exhibit, ''Catharsis'', was held in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tehminadurrani.com/catharsis.html|title=Tehmina Durrani|website=www.tehminadurrani.com|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of those paintings became the cover of her third book ''Blasphemy''.

Tehmina Durrani's next exhibit, ''A Love Affair'', took place in 2016. She will be intertwining her writing and painting in her coffee table book by the same name, ''A Love Affair'', with a print version of these paintings along with poems and songs that inspired her paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tehminadurranifoundation.org/profile-of-the-founder-of-tdf/|title=Founder TDF – TDF|website=www.tehminadurranifoundation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tutong language''', also known as ''Tutong 2'', is a language spoken by approximately 17,000 people in [[Brunei]]. It is the main language of the Tutong people, the majority ethnic group in the [[Tutong District]] of Brunei.

== Classification ==
Tutong is an [[Austronesian language]] and belongs to the Rejang-Baram group of languages spoken in Brunei as well as [[Kalimantan]], Indonesia, and [[Sarawak]], Malaysia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Whiter the Indigenous Languages of Brunei Darussalam?|journal=Oceanic Linguistics|volume=34|doi=10.2307/3623110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tutong is related to the [[Belait language|Belait]] language and roughly 54% of the words come from a common root.&lt;ref&gt;Nothofer, Bernd. 1991 . The languages of Brunei Darussalam. In H. Steinhauer (ed.) ''Papers in Austronesian Linguistics''. Pacific Linguistics A-81:1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language use ==
Today, many speakers of Tutong are shifting away from the traditional language and [[Code-mixing|code-mix]] or [[Code-switching|code-shift]] with Brunei Malay, Standard Malay and English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clynes|first=Adrian|title=Dominant Language Transfer in Minority Language Documentation Projects: Some Examples from Brunei|journal=Language Documentation and Conservation|volume=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language has been given a vitality rating of 2.5 based on a scale of 0-6 that uses the measures of the rate of transmission to future generations, the level of official support, and the geographical concentration of speakers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Endangered Languages in Borneo: A Survey among the Iban and Murut (Lun Bawang) in Temburong, Brunei|journal=Oceanic Linguistics|volume=49|doi=10.1353/ol.0.0063}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means it is considered [[Endangered language|endangered]].

Nonetheless, there is interest in [[Language revitalization|revitalizing]] the language. Since 2012, a module has been taught in Tutong at Universiti Brunei Darussalam (UBD).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Strategies for revitalizing endangered Borneo languages: A comparison between Negara Brunei Darussalam and Sarawak, Malaysia.|journal=Southeast Asia: A Multidisciplinary Journal|volume=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the ''Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka'' (Brunei's Language Agency) published a Tutong-Malay, Malay-Tutong dictionary in 1991 and a word list of several Brunei languages in 2011.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5311">A '''white backlash''' is an actual or hypothetical negative response of [[white people]] to racial progress. It is typically discussed in [[the United States]] in regard to advancement of [[African American]]s in American society,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hughey |first=Matthew W. |date=2014-03-18 |title=White backlash in the ‘post-racial’ United States |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01419870.2014.886710 |journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=721–730 |doi=10.1080/01419870.2014.886710}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it has been discussed in the context of other countries, including the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rhodes |first=James |date=2010-02-09 |title=White Backlash, ‘Unfairness’ and Justifications of British National Party (BNP) Support |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1468796809353392 |journal=Ethnicities |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=77–99 |doi=10.1177/1468796809353392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History in the United States==
One early example of a white backlash occurred when [[Hiram Rhodes Revels]] was elected to the [[United States Senate]] in 1870, becoming the first African-American to be so elected. The resulting backlash derailed the then-ongoing post-Civil War [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], which had attempted to build an interracial democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnn.com/2016/11/11/us/obama-trump-white-backlash/index.html |title=This is what 'whitelash' looks like |last=CNN |first=John Blake, |date=2016-11-11 |website=CNN |access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the earliest high-profile examples of a white backlash in the United States was in 1964, after the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. Many Democrats in Congress, as well as President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] himself, feared that such a backlash could develop in response to the legislation, and [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] popularized the "white backlash" phrase and concept to warn of this possibility.&lt;ref name=atlantic&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/01/trump-massive-resistance-history-mlk/550544/ |title=Five Decades of White Backlash |last=II |first=Vann R. Newkirk |date=2018-01-15 |website=The Atlantic |language=en-US |access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The backlash that they warned about did ensue, and was based on the argument that whites' immigrant descendants did not receive the benefits that were given to African Americans in the Civil Rights Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/08/23/analysis-of-the-white-backlash.html |title=Analysis of the ‘White Backlash’ |last=Miller |first=William Lee |date=1964-08-23 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2018-02-16 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; After signing the Civil Rights Act, Johnson grew concerned that the white backlash would cost him the [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964 general election]] later that year. Specifically, Johnson feared that his opponent, [[Barry Goldwater]], would harness the backlash by highlighting the black riots engulfing the country at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2001/spring/lbj-and-white-backlash-1.html |title=LBJ Fights the White Backlash |date=Spring 2001 |website=Prologue Magazine|language=en |access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant white backlash also resulted from the election of [[Barack Obama]] as the first black [[President of the United States]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Smith |first=Terry|date=2015 |title=White Backlash in a Brown Country |url=https://scholar.valpo.edu/vulr/vol50/iss1/4/ |journal=Valparaiso University Law Review |language=en |volume=50 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the term is often used to refer specifically to the backlash triggered by Obama's election.&lt;ref name=atlantic/&gt; The election of [[Donald Trump]] as president in 2016 is often cited by critics as another example of white backlash.&lt;ref name=atlantic/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/08/us/trump-affirmative-action-president/index.html |title=How Trump became 'the white affirmative action president' |last=CNN |first=Story by John Blake, CNN Video by Tawanda Scott Sambou, |date=2018-01-08 |website=CNN |access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[CNN]] contributor [[Van Jones]] coined the term "whitelash" (a [[portmanteau]] of "white" and "backlash") to describe one of the reasons he thought that Trump won the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2016/11/11/us/obama-trump-white-backlash/index.html |title=This is what 'whitelash' looks like |last=CNN |first=John Blake, |date=2016-11-11 |work=CNN |access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Women have made major contributions to climate change research and policy and to broader analysis of global environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sachs|first1=Carolyn|title=Women Working In The Environment: Resourceful Natures.|date=2014|publisher=Taylor and Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They include many women scientists as well as policy makers and activists. Women researchers have made significant contributions to major scientific assessments such as those of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] and the [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]] and are reasonably well represented on key global change committees of the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU) and US National Academy of Sciences.  Women have played important leadership roles in international climate policy. [[File:Mary Robinson World Economic Forum 2013 crop.jpg|thumb|Mary Robinson]] For example, [[Christiana Figueres]] leads the international climate negotiations as the Executive Secretary of the [[UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) and former Irish President [[Mary Robinson]] is the UN Special Envoy on Climate Change.[[File:Christiana Figueres in London - 2018 (39536174340) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Christiana Figueres]] Susan Solomon chaired the climate science working group 1 of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] Fourth Assessment in 2007.

==Underrepresentation of women in science==
{{Main|Women in STEM fields}}

Women are generally underrepresented in science and have faced many barriers to their success and recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rossi|first1=AS|title=Women in Science: Why So Few? Social and psychological influences restrict women's choice and pursuit of careers in science|journal=Science|date=1962|volume=148|pages=1196–1202|doi=10.1126/science.148.3674.1196|pmid=17748114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eccles|first1=Jacquelynne S|title=Where Are All the Women? Gender Differences in Participation in Physical Science and Engineering.|date=2007|publisher=American Psychological Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the scientific revolution in the 17th century European women became involved in observational science, including astronomy, natural history and weather observations although many universities would not admit women until the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herzenberg|first1=Caroline L|title=Women Scientists from Antiquity to the Present|date=1986|publisher=Locust Hill Press|isbn=0-933951-01-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=National Academy of Sciences|title=Beyond Bias and Barriers: Fulfilling the Potential of Women in Academic Science and Engineering.|date=2006|publisher=National Academies Press|location=Washington DC|isbn=0-309-10320-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schiebinger|first1=Londa|title=he Mind Has No Sex? Women in the Origins of Modern Science|date=1989|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0-674-57625-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watts|first1=Ruth|title=Women in Science: A social and cultural history|date=2013|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest report from the US National Science Foundation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=National Science Foundation|first1=National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics|title=Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering: 2015|date=2015|publisher=National Science Foundation|location=Arlington Virginia|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2015/nsf15311/start.cfm|accessdate=April 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that while women are now earning half of the undergraduate degrees in science and engineering, most of these are in the biosciences (especially pre-med) compared to physics, computer sciences and engineering (20%). In terms of doctorates, women are also only 20% of the engineering and physics PhDs. Although the proportion of women full professors in the US has doubled since 1993 women occupy less than 1/4 of senior faculty positions in science and engineering and women earn less than men at the same level.

It has been noted that women of color, indigenous women and women from the global south are even more likely to be overlooked, to be poorly represented in the academy and leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ong|first1=Maria|last2=Wright|first2=C|last3=Espinosa|first3=LL|last4=Orfield|first4=G|title=Inside the double bind: A synthesis of empirical research on undergraduate and graduate women of color in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|journal=Harvard Educational Review|date=2011|volume=81|issue=2|pages=172–209|doi=10.17763/haer.81.2.t022245n7x4752v2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is associated with a legacy of discrimination, lack of educational opportunities, language barriers, and a lack of effort to identify and cite them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=National Science Foundation|first1=National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics|title=Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering: 2015|date=2015|publisher=National Science Foundation|location=Arlington Virginia|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2015/nsf15311/start.cfm|accessdate=April 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harding|first1=Sandra|title=The 'racial' economy of science; Toward a Democratic Future|date=1993|publisher=Indiana University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women in climate change disciplines==
Women are underrepresented in key disciplines for the study of climate change.  For example, women are a minority in the earth sciences where surveys reveal that less than 20% of meteorologists and geoscientists are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=UCAR|title=Women in Meteorology: How long a minority?|url=https://www.ucar.edu/communications/quarterly/fall03/wmo.html|website=UCAR communications|publisher=UCAR|accessdate=Apr 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A recent analysis of US atmospheric science doctoral programs reveals that women were 17% of tenure track and tenured faculty, with even smaller proportions at higher rank,  and 53% of departments had two or fewer women faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MacPhee|first1=David|last2=Canetto|first2=Silvia Sara|title=Women in Academic Atmospheric Sciences|journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society|date=2015|volume=96|pages=59–67|doi=10.1175/bams-d-12-00215.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women are slightly better represented in the ecological sciences.  One study reports that women are 55% of graduate students in ecology but only 1/3 of tenured faculty are women and that 3/4 of the articles in the flagship international journal - Ecology - are written by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martin|first1=Laura Jane|title=Where are the women in ecology|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|date=2012|volume=10|pages=177–178|doi=10.1890/12.wb.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women received proportionally less research funding and were less likely to be cited by their colleagues. Women members of the Ecological Society of America increased from 23% in 1992 to 37% in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beck|first1=Christopher|last2=Boersma|first2=Kate|last3=Tysor|first3=C Susannah|last4=Middendorf|first4=George|title=Diversity at 100: women and underrepresented minorities in the ESA|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|date=2014|volume=12|pages=434–436|doi=10.1890/14.WB.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] publishes data on women in science worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=UNESCO|title=Gender and Science|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/priority-areas/gender-and-science/|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall women are better represented as a share of total scientific researchers in Latin America, Oceania and Europe (30%+) and least in Asia (19%).

==Arguments for women in science and climate change==
It is argued that when women are overlooked as scholars and decision makers the world fails to take advantage of its full human capacity, which is needed for issues as urgent as climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wyer|first1=Mary|last2=Barbercheck|first2=M|last3=Cookmeyer|first3=D|last4=Ozturk|first4=H|last5=Wayne|first5=M|title=Women, science, and technology: A reader in feminist science studies.|date=2013|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women may also take more collaborative approaches, especially in negotiations, and may pay more attention to disadvantaged groups and to the natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blanchard|first1=Eric M|title= Gender, international relations, and the development of feminist security theory|journal=Signs|date= |doi=10.1086/368328|citeseerx=10.1.1.474.9430}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Porter|first1=Elisabeth|title=Peacebuilding: Women in international perspective|date=2007|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender has become an issue because of women's essential roles in managing resources such as water, forests and energy and as women lead fights for environmental protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buckingham-Hatfield|first1=Susan|title=Gender and Environment|date=2005|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rocheleau|first1=Dianne|last2=Thomas-Slayter|first2=Barbara|last3=Wangari|first3=Esther|title=Feminist political ecology: Global issues and local experience|date=2013|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A general concern has been expressed about the need to highlight the work of women and to include more women in major committees in order to provide gender balance, social justice, and inspiration to young women to enter careers in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buck|first1=Holly|last2=Gammon|first2=Andrea R|last3=Preston|first3=Christopher J|title=Gender and Geoengineering|journal=Hypatia|date=2014|volume=29|issue=3|pages=651–669|doi=10.1111/hypa.12083}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pearson|first1=Willie|last2=Frehill|first2=Lisa|last3=Didion|first3=Catherine|title=Blueprint for the Future:: Framing the Issues of Women in Science in a Global Context: Summary of a Workshop|date=2012|publisher=National Academies Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This reflects more general arguments about the barriers to women's advancement and the need for women to 'Lean in' to leadership positions (e.g. [http://leanin.org/ Lean In]).  
[[File:Susan Solomon-Desk With Globe.jpg|thumb|Susan Solomon]]

==Women and international climate policy==
The outcome document of the Rio+20 Conference on Sustainable Development - the Future we Want - recognized the need to remove barriers to the full and equal participation of women in decision making and management and the need to increase women in leadership positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=UN|title=The Future we Want - Outcome document|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/futurewewant.html|publisher=UN|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report prepared by UN Women, the Mary Robinson Foundation - Climate Justice, the Global Gender and Climate Alliance and the UNFCCC recognizes the structural inequalities that impede the representation of women in climate science, negotiations and policies and recommends greater gender balance in the UNFCCC and national delegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=UN Women and Mary Robinson Foundation - Climate Justice|title=The Full View: Advancing the goal of gender balance in multilateral and intergovernmental processes|date=May 2013|publisher=UN Women}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report argues that the 'challenges of climate change cannot be solved without empowering women' and that women have been marginalized in international negotiations. It reports data that show weak representation of women in the institutions of the UNFCCC including the Adaptation Committee (25%), the GEF Council (19%) and the Expert Group (15%) and that overall women constitute less than 20% of delegation heads and less than 30% of delegation members at UNFCCC conferences.

== The Manthropocene ==

A call for international science to pay greater attention to the inclusion of women scholars was made by [[Kate Raworth]] [http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/17/never-mind-the-anthropocene-beware-the-manthropocene/ on Twitter] and then in her article "Must the Anthropocene be the Manthropocene?"&lt;ref name="raworth-2014"&gt;{{cite news| issn = 0261-3077| first = Kate| last = Raworth| title = Must the Anthropocene be a Manthropocene?| work = The Guardian| location = London, UK| access-date = 2016-10-08| date = 20 October 2014| url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/20/anthropocene-working-group-science-gender-bias}}&lt;/ref&gt; She pointed out that the working group of 36 scientists and scholars who convened in Berlin in 2014 to begin assessing evidence humanity was entering a new epoch, the [[Anthropocene]], was composed almost entirely of men.  She stated: "Leading scientists may have the intellect to recognize that our planetary era is dominated by human activity, but they still seem oblivious to the fact that their own intellectual deliberations are bizarrely dominated by white northern male voices".

==Women working in climate change==
There are a variety of ways to identify women who have made major contributions to climate change.  The first is the list of authors of the high level international assessments for the UN and other organizations such as the [http://www.ippc.ch Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change], and the [[UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC). The second is to examine women who have been invited to join the editorial boards of climate change refereed journals. A third is to look at the membership of the global change committees of the [http://www.icsu.org/ International Council for Science (ICSU)]. And a fourth is to recognize women that are members of their National Academy of Sciences who work on climate change. Many of them are IPCC or other report authors, and also members of ICSU committees, members of their National Academy and other marks of accomplishment.

'''Zhmaryānī''' also known as '''Gumoriani''' ({{lang-ps|ژمرياني}}), also called '''Jamaryani''', '''Gumoriani''', '''Zimaryani''', '''Zimri''' or '''Mizri''', is a [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] tribe in [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.khyber.org/tribes/web/ppl/7/4/be3103051ca457413c19174ad47.shtml Zmaryani ژمرياني.] Khyber.ORG.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Zhmaryani lineages live in [[Afghanistan]]. They are [[Kasi (Pashtun tribe)|Kasi]] Pashtuns.

The name ''Zimri'' or ''Zmarai'' means "fierce tiger" in the Pashto language. The history shows that one day at the place located in Musakhail city between the Sherani and Isot, the father of Zhmaryani had a fight with tigers in the mountains. After being victorious, the father of Musakhail gave him the honour ''Zmarai'' (lion), which means "lion" in Pashto. Zimri, Mizri, the same nation&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; named changed due to the languages of different areas.

Rough estimates show their population to be more than 90,000–100,000.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Location==
They live in the [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] provinces of Pakistan. In Balochistan, the name ''Zhmaryani'' is common, but in the areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the name ''Gumoriani'' or ''Gumaryani'' is used. Some of them live in [[Sibi]] and they call themselves ''Mizri''. These migrations have occurred primarily due to tribal conflicts and financial instability in the region. They are living in the mountainous range associated with [[Hazrat Suleman]]. They live between [[Shirani (Pashtun tribe)|Sherani]] and [[Isot]] tribes. The mountains on which they live are very fertile. These valleys are thought to be one of the most beautiful places in Balochistan Province. The Zhmaryani country is drained by small hills torrents: the Ramak and Guzai.

Zhmaryani are respectable and educated nation in Afghanistan as well as in Pakistan. Due to some clashes, Zhmaryani migrated from Musakhail to other cities of Pakistan like Loralai, and other countries of the world. Some of the Zhmaryani migrated from Musakhail to the Luni area in the way of Khulo.

In [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan]] they are living in the famous village of [[Pirpiai]], also known as Little England due to its high literacy rate, [[Pashtun Ghari]] and  [[Mohib Banda]] in Nowshera. The founding father of Pirpiai was the son of Daulat Khan. Daulat Khan was a commander and confidant of [[Nadir Shah Afshar]], the ruler of Iran. Nadir Shah awarded the area to Daulat Khan, his confidant. Daulat Khan belonged to the Zhmaryani tribe.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}
