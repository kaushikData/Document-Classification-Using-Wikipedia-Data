The '''Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research''' (German: ''Alfred-Wegener-Institut, Helmholtz-Zentrum für Polar- und Meeresforschung'') is located in [[Bremerhaven]], Germany, and a member of the [[Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres]]. It conducts research in the [[Arctic]], in the [[Antarctic]] and in the high and mid latitude oceans. Additional research topics are: [[North Sea]] research, marine biological monitoring and technical marine developments. The institute was founded in 1980 and is named after [[meteorologist]], [[climatologist]] and geologist [[Alfred Wegener]].

==  Research ==
The institute has three major departments: 
*Climate System Department, which studies oceans, [[ice]] and [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] as physical and chemical systems.
*Biosciences Department, which studies the biological processes in marine and coastal ecosystems.
*Geoscientific Department, which studies climate development, especially as revealed by sediments.

== Facilities ==
The institute is distributed over several sites within [[North Germany]] and the '''Otto Schmidt Laboratory for Polar and Marine Research''' (OSL) at the [[Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute]] (AARI) in [[Saint Petersburg]] as Russian-German cooperation in the field of Arctic research, named after the polar explorer [[Otto Schmidt]].

===Bremerhaven===
[[Image:Alfred-Wegener-Institut.jpg|thumb|Building '''D''' resembles the [[stern]] of a ship.]]
The headquarters was founded by [[Gotthilf Hempel]]. Nowadays, the AWI has several buildings within the city of [[Bremerhaven]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Address and route planner|url=http://www.awi.de/en/institute/sites/bremerhaven/address_and_route_planner_bremerhaven/|publisher=Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar- and Marine Research, Bremerhaven|accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Steidle awi hg.jpg|thumb|Building '''E'''. The ''Harbour Tower'' on the right is directly in front of the ''Weser Tower''.]]
* '''Building D''' is located next to the old port (German: ''[[:de:Alter Hafen (Bremerhaven)|Alter Hafen]]''). The dark [[Clinker brick|clink-brick building]] was designed by [[Oswald Mathias Ungers]] in 1985 who won the [[List of architecture prizes|architecture-award]] ''[[:de:Großer BDA-Preis|BDA-prize]]'' for the building. It hosts the AWI library, the main lecture hall and various laboratories and offices.
* The '''main building E''' is next to the [[Lock (water transport)|lock]] ''[[:de:Doppelschleuse (Bremerhaven)|Doppelschleuse]]''. Main characteristics are the chequered tiles and the fact that there are three office towers. The building was designed by [[:de:Otto Steidle|Otto Steidle]] and constructed in 2004 as an extension of the '''complex A,B,C'''.
* '''House F''' is close to the [[Weser]] ferry at the [[Geeste (river)|Geeste]] [[estuary]]. The housing association StäWoG (German: ''Städtische Wohnungsgesellschaft'') renovated the building of the former nautical college (German: ''Hochschule für Seefahrt'') in 1999. For this reason, there is a  [[planetarium]] which is nowadays used by the Bremerhaven's friends of the stars.
* The small '''Bathymetry Building''' is located close to the [[Bremerhaven Radar Tower|radar tower]].
* The '''Nordsee Villa''' formerly belonged to the [[fast-food]] restaurant chain [[Nordsee]] and hosts a few offices of AWI. Nowadays it is a [[:de:Haus der Technik (Essen)|Haus der Technik]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kikker|first=Ursel|title=szmtag Haus der Technik eröffnet Zweigstelle|url=http://www.nordsee-zeitung.de/region/bremerhaven_artikel,-Haus-der-Technik-eroeffnet-Zweigstelle-_arid,758998.html|publisher=Nordsee Zeitung|accessdate=18 September 2012|language=German|date=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and part of the oldest German institute for technical further education with close cooperation to [[RWTH Aachen]] and other universities.
* The '''Harbour Warehouse''' (German: ''Hafenlager'') is located within the [[Lloyd Werft]], see Lloyd Werft Map.

===Potsdam===
The '''Forschungstelle Potsdam''' is situated on the [[Telegrafenberg]] next to [[Potsdam]]. It belongs to AWI since 1992. The research focuses on the [[atmospheric physics]] and [[atmospheric chemistry]] of the atmosphere on the one hand and [[periglacial]] research on the other hand.

===Sylt===
The '''Wadden Sea Station Sylt''' is located on the North German island [[Sylt]].
It was founded in 1924 as an [[oyster]] laboratory to study the decline of oyster stocks and in order to study how they could be cultivated. In 1937, the name changed from ''oyster laboratory'' to ''Wadden Sea station''. The station grew, and in 1949 the station was shifted from the northernmost edge of the island to the current location, next to the harbor of [[List, Schleswig-Holstein|List]]. In 1998 the station became part of '''AWI'''. Nowadays, there are about 30 scientists and technicians. Two guest houses allow to perform workshops and [[video conference]]s are possible with the AWI headquarters.

The research focuses on coast ecology and coast geology. In the 1930 there have been oyster reefs below the [[mussel]] banks at the water level. Below these, there have been [[sabellaria]] reefs which have been destroyed by fishery. Nowadays there are only the mussel banks left.

===Helgoland===
The '''Biologische Anstalt Helgoland''' is situated at {{coord|54.177821|7.891402|type:edu_region:DE|name=Alfred Wegener Institute, Biologische Anstalt Helgoland}} on the island [[Heligoland]] (German: ''Helgoland''). The station exists since 1892. Scientists study the ecology of the [[North Sea]] in this research station.

Since 1962, at [[Heligoland]] [[roadstead]] {{coord|54|11|2|N|7|54|0|E|type:landmark_region:DE|name=Helgoland Reede Phytoplankton Probe}}, [[phytoplankton]] and water samples are taken every weekday morning, 
the [[turbidity]] is measured (e.g. using a [[Secchi disk]]) and other parameters are recorded. The [[North Sea]] warmed by 1.65&amp;nbsp;°C since the start of the time series.

==Stations==
The institute maintains several research stations around the Arctic Ocean and on the [[Antarctic]] continent.&lt;ref name=RefAwiStations&gt;{{cite web|title=Stations in the Arctic and in the Antarctic|url=http://www.awi.de/en/infrastructure/stations/|publisher=Alfred Wegener Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neumayer Station===
The '''[[Neumayer-Station III]]''' located at {{coord|70|40|08|S|8|16|02|W|type:edu_region:AQ|name=Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar- and Marine Research, Neumayer Station III}}, about 5&amp;nbsp;km away from the previous station, ''Neumayer II'' which is now abandoned and covered by a thick ice cover. The new station ([http://www.awi.de/NM_WebCam/ Webcam]) is a futuristic-looking combined platform above the snow surface offering space for research, operations and living since 2009. The station stands on 16 hydraulic posts which are used to adjust the building to the growing snow cover. Below the station [[:de:PistenBully|PistenBully]]s and other equipment are stored an underground garage.
In summer, the station can host up to 40 people. The station contains several laboratories, has a weather balloon launching facility and a hospital with telemedical equipment.

===Dallmann Laboratory===
In cooperation with the [[Instituto Antártico Argentino]] (IAA), in 1994 the AWI opened a research station on [[King George Island (South Shetland Islands)|King George Island]] at {{coord|62|14.00|S|58|40.00|W|type:edu_region:AQ|name=Dallmann Laboratory, Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar- and Marine Research}}. The station is named after [[Eduard Dallmann]], a German [[whaler]], trader and Polar explorer living next to [[Bremen]].

===Koldewey Station===
The '''Koldewey Station''' at {{coord|78|55|24|N|11|55|15|E|type:edu_region:AQ|name=Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar- and Marine Research, Koldewey Station}} is named after the German polar explorer [[Carl Koldewey]] and part of the French-German Arctic Research ''AWIPEV'' Arctic in [[Ny-Ålesund]] on [[Svalbard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mengedoht|first=Dirk|title=AWIPEV Arctic Research Base|url=http://www.awi.de/en/infrastructure/stations/awipev_arctic_research_base/|publisher=Alfred-Wegener-Institute for Polar- and Marine Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kohnen Station===
The '''Kohnen Station''' was established in 2001 as logistical base for [[ice core]] drilling in [[Dronning Maud Land]], [[Antarctica]] at {{coord|75|0||S|0|4||E|type:edu_region:AQ|name=Kohnen Station, Alfred-Wegener-Institute for Polar- and Marine Research, Germany}}

===Samoylov Station===
The '''Samoylov Station''' at {{coord|72|22|6|N|126|28|29|E|type:edu_region:RU|name=Samoylov Station, Lena Delta Reserve}} lays within the [[Lena Delta]] close to the [[Laptev Sea]]. The station was set up as a logistic base for [[permafrost]] studies by the ''Lena Delta Reserve'' (LDR) and the AWI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Langer|first=Moritz|title=Samoylov Station|url=http://www.awi.de/en/infrastructure/stations/samoylov_station/|publisher=Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar- and Marine Research|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ships==
Altogether there are six ships that belong to AWI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ships and boats |url=http://www.awi.de/en/infrastructure/ships/ |work=Official Website |publisher=Alfred-Wegener-Institute for Polar- and Marine Research |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011084615/http://www.awi.de/en/infrastructure/ships/ |archivedate=11 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===RV ''Polarstern''===
{{main article|RV Polarstern}}
The AWI flagship is Germany's research icebreaker [[RV Polarstern|RV ''Polarstern'']]. The ship was commissioned in 1982. The double-hulled icebreaker is operational up to temperatures as low as −50&amp;nbsp;°C (−58&amp;nbsp;°F). Polarstern can break through [[sea ice]] of 1.5 m thickness at a speed of 5 knots, thicker ice must be broken by ramming. A possible but not probable follow-up flagship might be the [[Aurora Borealis (icebreaker)|research icebreaker ''Aurora Borealis'']].

===RV ''Heincke''===
The vessel RV ''Heincke'' is a multifunctional and low-noise ship for research in ice-free waters, named after German [[zoology|zoologist]] and [[Ichthyology|ichthyologist]] [[Friedrich Heincke]] . With a length of 54.6 [[m]], a width of 12.5 [[m]] and a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] 4.16 [[m]], the ship is categorized as "medium research vessel" within the German research fleet. 
The ship was put into operation in 1990, its building costs have been around 16 Millionen [[Euro]].
On the vessel, up to 12 scientists and 8 crew members can work for up to 30 passage days. This corresponds to an operating range of roughly 7500 nautical miles. The [[shipowner]] is Briese Schiffahrts GmbH &amp; Co. KG from [[Leer]], a city in [[East Frisia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bgr.de/fs_sonne/forschung/schiffe.html|title=Forschungsschiffe|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607234107/http://www.bgr.de/fs_sonne/forschung/schiffe.html|archivedate=7 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===RV ''Uthörn''===
[[File:BrnBld UtoernSketch.svg|thumb|Silhouette of RV ''Uthörn'', the [[length overall]] is 30.5 [[m]], it has 2.5 [[m]] [[Draft (hull)|draft]] and a width of 8.5 [[m]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Details of the research cutter "RV Uthörn" (in German)|url=http://www.laeisz.de/print/flotte/forschung/uthoern.html|publisher=Reederei F.

The research [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] RV ''Uthörn'' is named after the small island [[Uthörn]] next to [[Sylt]] in the [[North Sea]]. The vessel is regularly on research tours in [[German Bight]], but is also used to supply the AWI branch ''[[Alfred Wegener Institute|Biologische Anstalt Helgoland]]'' mentioned above. Two scientists and 4 crew members can live and work on board for up to 180 days, but the vessel mainly used for day trips.&lt;ref name=AwiUthoernPlan&gt;{{cite web|title=Schiffseinsatzplan RV ''Uthörn''|url=http://www.bsh.de/de/Meeresnutzung/Wissenschaft/Forschungsschiffe/Schiffseinsatzplaene2012/uthoern.jsp|publisher=[[Bundesamt für Seeschifffahrt und Hydrographie]]|accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another operation purpose are short term cruises of a few hours for up to 25 students to demonstrate [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] and biological sampling methods.

Being commissioned in 1982 RV ''Uthörn'' replaced a vessel with the same name which was built in 1947 and had a length of 24 [[m]]. The current vessel is powered by two [[V12 engine|V12]]
[[Four-stroke engine|four-stroke]] [[Diesel engine]]s manufactured by the company [[MWM GmbH]] from [[Mannheim]]. Each engine delivers up to 231 [[kW]] to a [[controllable-pitch propeller]]; the maximal speed is around 10 [[Knot (unit)|kn]].
On the working [[deck (ship)|deck]], there is a [[dry lab]] and a laboratory for wet work like sorting fish. The ship is equipped with standard sampling devices: You may find on board a [[demersal]] [[trawl]], a [[Van Veen Grab Sampler]], [[Niskin bottle]]s, and even deprecated [[reversing thermometer]]s for teaching purposes.

===''Mya'', ''Aade'' and ''Diker''===
The research [[catamaran]] ''Mya'' is specially designed for research in the intertidal zone, it can fall dry at low tide. The main research area is the [[Wadden Sea]]. Last but not least, there are two small motor boats, ''Aade'' and ''Diker'' for sampling and diving operations around [[Heligoland]].

==Aircraft==

===Past aircraft===
[[File:Polar 5.jpg|thumb|''Polar 5'' in June 2008]]
The Alfred Wegener Institute operated five airplanes under the name of ''Polar'', those being:&lt;ref name=former&gt;[http://www.awi.de/de/infrastruktur/fluggeraete/forschungsflugzeuge/ehemalige_flugzeuge/ Ehemalige Flugzeuge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411211551/http://www.awi.de/de/infrastruktur/fluggeraete/forschungsflugzeuge/ehemalige_flugzeuge/ |date=11 April 2013 }} {{de icon}} Alfred Wegener Institute –  Former airplanes, accessed: 18 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Polar 1'', a [[Dornier 128]] commissioned in 1983, now in possession of the ''[[TU Braunschweig]]''
* ''Polar 2'', a Dornier 228 commissioned in 1983, still in service with the AWI
* ''Polar 3'', like ''Polar 2'' commissioned in 1983, shot down possibly by [[SA-2 Guideline]] missile on 24 February 1985 over [[Western Sahara]]
* ''Polar 4'', a Dorniers 228 commissioned in 1985, severely damaged at a landing at the British [[Rothera Research Station]] in 2005, now on display at the Institute

===Current fleet===
AWI currently uses two [[Basler BT-67]]. These planes are 20 m long, 5.2 m high and have a wingspan of 29 m. The empty weight is 7680&amp;nbsp;kg, with ski landing gear it weighs 8340&amp;nbsp;kg.
The minimal cruising speed is 156&amp;nbsp;km/h, the maximum is SFA{{what|date=October 2018}}. Without payload, the flying range is around 3900&amp;nbsp;km. The planes are maintained by the company [[Kenn Borek Air]] located in [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta]], Canada.

====Polar 5====
The plane hull was built in 1942 but completely refurbished after the AWI acquired the plane in 2007. Since then it "has supplied a large volume of valuable data" said Prof. [[:de:Heinrich Miller|Heinrich Miller]], the former director of the AWI.

====Polar 6====
This plane with the call sign C-FHGF was acquired by AWI in 2011. The [[BMBF]], the German Federal Minister of Education and Research funded the purchase and equipping of the plane with a total of 9.78 million euros.&lt;ref name=AwiPolar6PressRelease&gt;{{cite web|last=Mehrtens|first=Folke|title=New aircraft for research – Polar 6 ready for first assignment in Antarctica|url=http://www.awi.de/en/news/press_releases/detail/item/new_aircraft_for_research_polar_6_ready_for_first_assignment_in_antarctica/?tx_list_pi1%5Bmode%5B=6&amp;cHash=cb193189f239122eebf7fe69ed998c59|publisher=Alfred-Wegener-Institut für Polar- und Meeresforschung|accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:D-CICE.jpg|thumb|Ski-equipped Polar 4]]
* In January 2005, Polar 4 was severely damaged during a rough landing at the British over-wintering station Rothera on the Antarctic Peninsula. As it was impossible to repair the plane, the aircraft had to be decommissioned. Since then, scientific and logistical tasks of polar flights have been performed by ''Polar 2''.

===Polar 3 incident===
On 24 February 1985, the ''[[Polar 3]]'', a research airplane of the institute of the type [[Dornier 228]], was shot down by guerrillas of the [[Polisario Front]] over [[West Sahara]]. All three crew members died. ''Polar 3'', together with unharmed ''Polar 2'', was on its way back from [[Antarctica]] and had taken off in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]], to reach [[Arrecife]], Canary Islands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19850224-0 Aviation safety network – Report on Polar 3] accessed: 18 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''biosafety cabinet''' ('''BSC''')—also called a '''biological safety cabinet''' or '''microbiological safety cabinet'''—is an enclosed, ventilated [[laboratory]] workspace for safely working with materials contaminated with (or potentially contaminated with) [[pathogen]]s requiring a defined [[biosafety level]]. Several different types of BSC exist, differentiated by the degree of [[biocontainment]] required. BSCs first became commercially available in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Wedum, A.G. (1969), "The Detrick experience as a guide to the probable efficacy of P4 microbiological containment facilities for studies on microbial recombinant DNA molecules"; ''[[J Am Biol Safety Assoc]]'';1:7-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purposes ==
The primary purpose of a BSC is to serve as a means to protect the laboratory worker and the surrounding environment from pathogens. All exhaust air is [[HEPA]]-filtered as it exits the biosafety cabinet, removing harmful [[bacterium|bacteria]] and [[virus]]es.&lt;ref name="IAState2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ehs.iastate.edu/cms/default.asp?action=article&amp;ID=40|title=Biosafety Cabinets|author=Iowa State University|year=2005|accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to a [[laminar flow cabinet|laminar flow]] clean bench, which blows unfiltered exhaust air towards the user and is not safe for work with pathogenic agents.&lt;ref name="CDC2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|last2=U.S. National Institutes of Health|title=Primary Containment for Biohazards: Selection, Installation and Use of Biological Safety Cabinets|publisher=U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|year=2000|url=https://www.cdc.gov/od/ohs/pdffiles/BSC-3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}}&lt;ref name="UPenn2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ehrs.upenn.edu/programs/bio/biologicalsafetycabinets/cleanbenches.html|title=Clean Benches vs. Biosafety Cabinets|author=University of Pennsylvania|date=November 6, 2009|accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither are most BSCs safe for use as [[fume hood]]s.&lt;ref name="IAState2005"/&gt; Likewise, a fume hood fails to provide the environmental protection that HEPA filtration in a BSC would provide.&lt;ref name="Baker2010"/&gt; However, most classes of BSCs have a secondary purpose to maintain the sterility of materials inside (the "product").

== Classes ==
The [[U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) classifies BSCs into three classes.&lt;ref name="CDC2000"/&gt;{{rp|6}} These classes and the types of BSCs within them are distinguished in two ways: the level of personnel and environmental protection provided and the level of product protection provided.

===Class I===
[[File:ETA483024ABD.jpg|thumb|BSC Class I]]
Class I cabinets provide personnel and environmental protection but no product protection. In fact, the inward flow of air can contribute to contamination of samples.&lt;ref name="DePalmaafASFDASFDQWREASDFASFDASF,KZXV XZV ZXV/AFA;'A;LWE0IRWEQ'JK2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labmanager.com/articles.asp?ID=371|title=Product Focus: Biological Safety Cabinets|last1=DePalma|first1=Angelo|date=October 7, 2009|work=Lab Manager|accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inward airflow is maintained at a minimum velocity of 75&amp;nbsp;ft/min(0.38 m/s). These BSCs are commonly used to enclose specific equipment (''e.g.'' centrifuges) or procedures (''e.g.'' aerating cultures) that potentially generate aerosols. BSCs of this class are either ducted (connected to the building exhaust system) or unducted (recirculating filtered exhaust back into the laboratory).&lt;ref name="CDC2000"/&gt;{{rp|6}}

===Class II===
[[Image:Laminar flow hood 2.jpg|thumb|right|A Class II biosafety cabinet used for handling ''[[Leishmania]]''.]]
Class II cabinets provide both kinds of protection (of the samples and of the environment) since makeup air is also HEPA-filtered. There are five types: Type A1 (formerly A), Type A2 (formerly A/B3), Type B1, Type B2 and Type C1. Each type's requirements are defined by [[NSF International]] Standard 49,&lt;ref name="CDC2000"/&gt;{{rp|31}} which in 2002 reclassified A/B3 cabinets (classified under the latter type if connected to an exhaust duct) as Type A2,&lt;ref name="Baker2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bakerco.com/intro-to-biological-safety-cabinets.html|title=Introduction to Biological Safety Cabinets|last1=The Baker Company|year=2010|accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and added the Type C1 in the 2016 standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.labconco.com/news/update-to-nsf-ansi-standard-49|title=3 Takeaways from the 2016 NSF/ANSI Standard 49 update - Labconco|website=www.labconco.com|access-date=2017-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 90% of all biosafety cabinets installed are Type A2 cabinets.&lt;ref name="DePalmaafASFDASFDQWREASDFASFDASF,KZXV XZV ZXV/AFA;'A;LWE0IRWEQ'JK2009" /&gt;

Principles of operation use motor driven blowers (fans) mounted in the cabinet to draw directional mass airflow around a user and into the air grille - protecting the operator.  The air is then drawn underneath the work surface and back up to the top of the cabinet where it passes through the HEPA filters. A column of HEPA filtered, sterile air is also blown downward, over products and processes to prevent contamination. Air is also exhausted through a HEPA filter, and depending on the Type of Class II BSC, the air is either recirculated back into the laboratory or pulled by an exhaust fan, through ductwork where it is expelled from the building. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.labconco.com/bscno-brainer|title=Biosafety Cabinet No-Brainer - Labconco|website=www.labconco.com|access-date=2017-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The Type A1 cabinet, formerly known as Type A, has a minimum inflow velocity of 75&amp;nbsp;ft/min. The downflow air, considered contaminated, splits just above the work surface (the BSCs smoke split) and mixes with the inflow. This air is drawn, through ductwork, up the back of the cabinet where it is then blown into a positive pressure, contaminated plenum. Here, the air is either recirculated, through a HEPA filter, back down over the work zone, or exhausted out of the cabinet (also through a HEPA filter). Sizing of HEPA filters and an internal damper are used to balance these air volumes. This type is not safe for work with hazardous chemicals even when exhausted with a "thimble" or canopy to avoid disturbing internal air flow.&lt;ref name="CDC2000"/&gt;{{rp|8–9}}

The Type A2 cabinet, formerly designated A/B3, has a minimum inflow velocity of 100&amp;nbsp;ft/min. A negative air pressure plenum surrounds all contaminated positive pressure plenums. In other respects, the specifications are identical to those of a Type A1 cabinet.&lt;ref name="CDC2000"/&gt;{{rp|9–11}}&lt;ref name="Baker2010"/&gt;

Type B1 and B2 cabinets have a minimum inflow velocity of 100&amp;nbsp;ft/min, and these cabinets must be hard-ducted to an exhaust system rather than exhausted through a thimble connection. Their exhaust systems must also be dedicated (one BSC per duct run, per blower). In contrast to the type A1 and A2 cabinets, Type B BSCs use single pass airflow (air that does not mix and recirculate) in order to also control hazardous chemical vapors. Type B1 cabinets split the airflow so that the air behind the smoke-split is directed to the exhaust system, while air between the operator and the smoke-split mixes with inflow air and is recirculated as downflow. Since exhaust air is drawn from the rear grille, the CDC advises that work with hazardous chemistry be conducted in the rear of the cabinet.&lt;ref name="CDC2000"/&gt;{{rp|10}} This is complicated, since the smoke split (demarking the "rear of the cabinet") is an invisible line that extends the width of the cabinet (approximately 10-14 inches from the front grille) and drifts as the internal HEPA filters load with particulate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Type B2 cabinet (also known as a Total Exhaust BSC) is expensive to operate because no air is recirculated within.&lt;ref name="CDC2000" /&gt; Therefore, this type is mainly found in such applications as [[toxicology]] laboratories, where the ability to safely use hazardous chemistry is important.&lt;ref name="Baker2010" /&gt; Additionally, there is the risk that contaminated air would flow into the laboratory if the exhaust system for a Type B1 or B2 cabinet were to fail. To mitigate this risk, cabinets of these types generally monitor the exhaust flow, shutting off the supply blower and sounding an alarm if the exhaust flow is insufficient.&lt;ref name="CDC2000" /&gt;{{rp|10–11}}

The Type C1 BSC was borne out of necessity to control infectious material, chemical hazards, reduce operating costs and add flexibility in modern laboratories. The Type C1 moves air by mixing inflow air with the air in the columns of downflow air marked for recirculation. Air above a clearly delineated section of the work surface is drawn by a second internal fan where it is exhausted through a HEPA filter. The C1 differs from a Type A in that it can use this single pass airflow, and when installed in a ducted operating mode, can protect from hazardous chemistry, like the Type Bs. The C1 also differs from the Type B BSCs in several ways; (1) it does not require a hard connected, dedicated exhaust system and blower to operate, (2) pending a risk assessment, the BSC can run for an extended duration to increase operator protection during a remote exhaust system failure, and (3) Type C1 BSCs can run without being connected to an exhaust system at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.labconco.com/bscno-brainer/safety|title=Biosafety Cabinet Gaps In Safety - Labconco|website=www.labconco.com|access-date=2017-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Class II cabinets are the commonly used cabinets in clinical and research laboratories.

===Class III===
[[File:BSC with microscope.jpg|thumb|A researcher observing a specimen through the built-in microscope in a Class III biosafety cabinet]]
[[File:NIAID Integrated Research Facility - Class III Biosafety Cabinet.jpg|thumb|[[Bioaerosol|Aerosol]] control platform inside a Class III Biosafety Cabinet]]

The Class III cabinet, generally only installed in maximum containment laboratories, is specifically designed for work with [[BSL-4]] pathogenic agents, providing maximum protection. The enclosure is gas-tight, and all materials enter and leave through a dunk tank or double-door [[autoclave]]. Gloves attached to the front prevent direct contact with hazardous materials (Class III cabinets are sometimes called [[glove box]]). These custom-built cabinets often attach into a line, and the lab equipment installed inside is usually custom-built as well.&lt;ref name="CDC2000"/&gt;{{rp|12–13}}

== Ergonomics ==
Biosafety cabinets are used on a daily basis for hours. Besides protection of user and sample material, the human design factors (ergonomics) of the work become more and more important. This includes reduction of the noise level (for a more convenient working atmosphere), a height adjustable stand or stool (for optimized sitting position), panorama side windows (more light within cabinet), 10°angled front sash (enables better sitting position) as well as strong light sources (better view within cabinet) to improve the working conditions.

== Ultraviolet lamps ==

The CDC does not recommend the installation of UV lamps in BSCs.&lt;ref name="CDC2000"/&gt;{{rp|12–13}} The [[American Biological Safety Association]] supports this position, citing the safety risk to personnel, shallow penetration, reduced effectiveness in high [[relative humidity]], and the frequent need to clean and replace the bulb.&lt;ref name="ABSA2000"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ehs.umass.edu/ABSA%20UV%20light%20paper.pdf|title=Position Paper on the Use of Ultraviolet Lights in Biological Safety Cabinets|last1=American Biological Safety Association|date=December 2000|accessdate=April 26, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011231306/http://www.ehs.umass.edu/ABSA%20UV%20light%20paper.pdf|archivedate=October 11, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; UV lamps should not be used as a primary source of surface decontamination within a BSC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/bmbl.pdf|title=Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these assertions have been formally disputed in at least one peer-reviewed article which points out that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meechan|first=Paul|author2=Christina Wilson|title=Use of Ultraviolet Lights in Biological Safety Cabinets: A Contrarian View|journal=Applied Biosafety|year=2006|volume=11|issue=4|pages=222–227}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*There is no cited basis for the need to remove dust and dirt from bulbs
*Properly functioning biosafety cabinets have very clean air so dust is less likely to build up
*Laboratories are generally air-conditioned which eliminates the concern over humidity inhibition of UV effectiveness
*With proper use UV exposure risk to users is very low
*UV disinfection is effective for germicide and virucide as well as inhibiting DNA contamination from [[PCR]]
*UV disinfection has the advantage of not leaving residues like physical disinfectants
*The relative safety and risks of UV versus other disinfection techniques (which also entail risks) should be considered

== Maintenance and service ==
Cabinets need to be maintained on a regular schedule. During this certification check, the airflow and the filter capacities are verified. The filters have a limited lifespan - determined by the air quality within the laboratory space and the amount of particles and aerosols generated inside the BSC' work zone. As these filters load, the internal fan is required to do more work to push/pull the same volume of air through them. Newer cabinets measure the air flow constantly and self compensate fan performance to ensure constant volumes of air moving through the filters and the cabinet. If the flow drops below desired performance an audio and visual alarm will alert the operator. Changing the filter should be limited to trained persons as the filter is potentially contaminated. This can be done either after the cabinet has been decontaminated using a gaseous procedure (using Formaldehyde, Chlorine Dioxide or Vaporized Hydrogen Peroxide) or a "bag-in/bag-out" procedure.

When an UV light is used, this lamp should be checked and changed as well. UV lights decrease in power over time, resulting in diminished disinfection of the working area.

== Work practices ==
As with work on open bench tops, work performed within a BSC must be performed carefully and safely. To avoid contamination and the risk of personnel exposure, the CDC advises investigators to follow best practices to reduce and control splatter and aerosol generation, such as keeping clean materials at least {{convert|12|in|cm}} from aerosol-generating activities and arranging the work flow "from clean to contaminated".&lt;ref name="CDC2000"/&gt;{{rp|22}} In particular, open flames, not necessary within the clean environment of a Class II or III BSC, cause disruption of the airflow inside.&lt;ref name="CDC2000"/&gt;{{rp|22}} Once work inside a BSC has been completed, it is necessary to decontaminate the surfaces of the BSC as with other lab equipment and materials.&lt;ref name="CDC2000"/&gt;{{rp|24}}

When a BSC is serviced or relocated, including replacement of HEPA filters, it must be gas decontaminated. Gas decontamination involves filling the BSC with a poisonous gas, most commonly [[formaldehyde]] gas.&lt;ref name="CDC2000"/&gt;{{rp|25}}

'''Botany Bay''', an open [[ocean]]ic [[Headlands and bays|embayment]],&lt;ref name="roy"/&gt; is located in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], {{convert|13|km|0|abbr=on}} south of the [[Sydney central business district]]. Its source is the [[confluence]] of the [[Georges River]] at [[Taren Point, New South Wales|Taren Point]] and the [[Cooks River]] at [[Kyeemagh, New South Wales|Kyeemagh]], which flows {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} to the east before meeting its [[river mouth|mouth]] at the [[Tasman Sea]], midpoint between [[La Perouse, New South Wales|La Perouse]] and [[Kurnell, New South Wales|Kurnell]].

The total catchment area of the bay is approximately {{convert|55|km2|abbr=on}}.  Despite its relative shallowness, the bay serves as greater metropolitan Sydney's main [[cargo]] [[port|seaport]], located at [[Port Botany (seaport)|Port Botany]], with [[Port operator|facilities managed]] by [[Port Authority of New South Wales|Sydney Ports Corporation]]. Two runways of [[Sydney Airport]] extend into the bay. [[Botany Bay National Park]] is located on the northern and southern headlands of the bay. The area surrounding the bay is generally managed by [[Roads and Maritime Services]].

The land adjacent to Botany Bay was settled for many thousands of years by the [[Tharawal people|Tharawal]] and [[Eora]] [[Indigenous peoples of Australia|Aboriginal]] peoples and their associated clans. On 29 April 1770, Botany Bay was the site of [[James Cook]]'s first landing of [[HMS Endeavour|HMS ''Endeavour'']] on the land mass of Australia, after his extensive navigation of [[New Zealand]]. Later the British planned Botany Bay as the site for a [[penal colony]]. Out of these plans came the first [[History of Australia (1788–1850)|European habitation of Australia]] at [[Sydney Cove]]. Although the penal settlement was almost immediately shifted to Sydney Cove, for some time in Britain [[penal transportation|transportation]] to "Botany Bay" was a [[metonym]] for transportation to any of the Australian penal settlements.

However, in the journal prepared later from his log, Cook wrote instead: (sic) "The great quantity of plants [[Joseph Banks|Mr. Banks]] and [[Daniel Solander|Dr. Solander]] found in this place occasioned my giving it the name of &lt;s&gt;Botanist&lt;/s&gt; Botany Bay"&lt;!--Note, the strikethrough is in the Cook's original, reflecting a change of mind sometime after leaving the Bay in 1770--&gt;.&lt;ref name="Botany"/&gt;

Eighteen years later, in 1788, Governor [[Arthur Phillip]] sailed the armed tender [[HMS Supply (1759)|HMS ''Supply'']] into the bay on 18 January. Two days later the remaining ships of the [[First Fleet]] arrived to found the planned [[penal colony]].  However, the land was quickly ruled unsuitable for settlement as there was insufficient fresh water; Phillip also believed the swampy foreshores would render any colony unhealthy. Phillip decided instead to move to the excellent natural harbour of [[Port Jackson]] to the north.&lt;ref&gt;Governor Phillip to Lord Sydney, 15 May 1788, cited in Britten (ed.) 1978, pp. 121–123&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of 24 January the [[France|French]] exploratory expedition of [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse]] was seen outside Botany Bay. On 26&amp;nbsp;January, the ''Supply'' left the bay to move up to Port Jackson and anchor in [[Sydney Cove]]. On the afternoon of 26 January, the remaining ships of First Fleet arrived at Sydney Cove.

In 1789, Captain [[John Hunter (Royal Navy officer)|John Hunter]] surveyed Botany Bay after returning from the Cape of Good Hope, trading for grain. The good supply of [[fresh water]] in the area led to the expansion of its population in the 19th century.

[[Sydney Airport]], Australia's busiest airport, sits on northwestern side of Botany Bay. Land was reclaimed from the bay to extend its first north-south runway and build a second one parallel to it.

The first container terminal at Port Botany, to the east of the airport, was completed during the 1970s, and is the largest [[container terminal]] in Sydney. A second container terminal was completed during the 1980s and bulk liquid storage facilities are located on the northern and southern edge of the bay. A third container terminal was completed in 2011. 

The land around the headlands of the bay is protected by the [[National Parks and Wildlife Service (New South Wales)|National Parks and Wildlife Service]] as Kamay Botany Bay National Park. On the northern side of the mouth of the bay is the historic site of La Perouse, and to the south is Kurnell. Despite its relative isolation, the southern shore of the bay is dominated by an unusual mixture of pristine national park and heavy industrial use that includes [[Kurnell Desalination Plant]], the [[Kurnell Refinery|Caltex Oil Refinery]], sewer treatment, and historical [[sand mining]] facilities.&lt;ref name=scma&gt;{{cite web |title=Kurnell Peninsula: a guide to the plants, animals, ecology and landscapes |accessdate=7 January 2013 |url=http://sydney.cma.nsw.gov.au/index.php?option=com_remository&amp;Itemid=51&amp;func=download&amp;id=549&amp;chk=5115e53218b24f9cc44e7a81fdff0449&amp;no_html=1 |publisher=Sydney Metropolitan Catchment Management Authority |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the southern side of the bay, a section of water has been fenced off under the authority of the National Parks and Wildlife Service at [[Towra Point Nature Reserve|Towra Point]] for environmental conservation purposes.

The western shores of the bay feature many popular swimming beaches including [[Lady Robinsons Beach]] and is highly urbanised.

==Marine life==
Botany Bay has a diverse [[marine life|marine population]], and the area around its entrance is a popular area for [[scuba diving]]. In recent times,{{when|date=January 2013}} the Botany Bay Watch Project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.botanybaywatch.com.au/ |publisher=Botanybaywatch.com.au |title=Botany Bay Watch Project |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718193604/http://www.botanybaywatch.com.au/ |archivedate=18 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has begun with volunteers assisting to monitor and protect the Bay Catchment and its unique marine life.

The world's largest population of [[weedy sea dragon]] ever surveyed is found at the 'Steps' dive site, on the Kurnell side of the Botany Bay National Park. Weedy sea dragons are just one of hundreds of territorial marine creatures found within Botany Bay.  The [[Eastern blue groper|eastern]] [[Blue groper|blue]] [[grouper]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.botanybaywatch.com.au/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Marine.BlueGroper |title=Marine Blue Groper |publisher=Botanybaywatch.com.au |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719121344/http://www.botanybaywatch.com.au/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Marine.BlueGroper |archivedate=19 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the state fish of New South Wales; and are commonly found following divers along the shore line of Botany Bay.

A '''Christian name''', sometimes referred to as a '''baptismal name''', is a [[religious name|religious]] [[personal name]] historically given on the occasion of a Christian [[baptism]], though now most often assigned by parents at birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=christian name | website=Dictionary.com Unabridged | accessdate=August 7, 2017 | url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/christian-name}}&lt;/ref&gt; In English-speaking cultures, a person's Christian name is commonly their first name and is typically the name by which they are primarily known.

Traditionally, a Christian name was given on the occasion of Christian [[baptism]], with the ubiquity of [[infant baptism]] in medieval [[Christendom]]. In [[Elizabethan England]], as suggested by [[William Camden|Camden]], the term ''Christian name'' was not necessarily related to baptism, used merely in the sense of "given name": Christian names were imposed for the distinction of persons, surnames for the difference of families.&lt;ref name="Thurston1913"&gt;{{Catholic Encyclopedia|last=Thurston|first=Herbert|inline=1|wstitle=Christian Names}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more modern times, the terms have been used interchangeably with [[given name]], [[first name]] and [[forename]] in traditionally Christian countries, and are still common in day-to-day use.

Strictly speaking, the Christian name is not merely the forename distinctive of the individual member of a family, but the name given to the person (generally a child) at his or her christening or baptism. In pre-[[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] England, the laity was taught to administer baptism in case of necessity with the words: "I christen thee in the name of the Father" etc. To "christen" in this context is therefore to "baptise", and "Christian name" means "baptismal name".&lt;ref name="Thurston1913"/&gt;

==Origin==
In view of the [[Hebrew name|Hebrew practice]] of giving a name to the male child at the time of his [[circumcision]] on the eighth day after birth ([[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 1:59), it has been maintained that the custom of conferring a name upon the newly baptised was of [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostolic]] origin. For instance, the apostle of the [[Gentile]]s was called Saul before his conversion and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] afterwards. But modern scholars{{who|date=October 2015}} have rejected this contention, since the baptism of St. Paul is recorded in [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 9:18, but the name Paul does not occur before Acts 13:9 while Saul is found several times in the interval. There is no more reason to connect the name Paul with the Apostle's baptism than there is to account in the same way for the giving of the name [[Saint Peter|Cephas]] or [[Saint Peter|Peter]], which is due to another cause{{which|date=October 2015}}. In the inscriptions of the catacombs and in early Christian literature, the names of Christians in the first three centuries did not distinctively differ from the names of the pagans around them. A reference to the [[Pauline epistles|Epistles of St. Paul]] indicates that the names of pre-Christian gods and goddesses were used by his converts after their conversion as before. Hermes occurs in [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 16:14, with a number of other purely pagan names, [[Epaphroditus]] in [[Epistle to the Philippians|Phil.]] 4:18, [[Phoebe (biblical figure)|Phoebe]], the deaconess, in Romans 16:1.&lt;ref name="Thurston1913"/&gt;

Similar names are found in the Christian inscriptions of the earlier period and in the signatories appended to such councils as [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]] or [[Synod of Ancyra|Ancyra]],&lt;ref&gt;see Turner, "Eccl. Occident. Mon. Juris", I, 36-90; II, 50-53&lt;/ref&gt; or again in the lists of [[Christian martyrs|martyrs]]. At a later date the names are of a most miscellaneous character. The following classification is one that has been worked out by J. Bass Mullinger founded on Martigny.&lt;ref name="Thurston1913"/&gt;

===Names without Christian origin and significance===
This category may be divided as follows:&lt;ref name="Thurston1913"/&gt;

* derived unchanged or but slightly modified from pagan mythology, e.g., Mercurius, Bacchus, Apollos (I Corinthians 16:12), Hermogenes (Romans 16:4), etc.
* from religious rites or omens, e.g., Augustus, Auspicius, Augurius, Optatus;
* from numbers, e.g., Primus, Primigenius, Secundinus, Quartus, Octavia, etc.
* from colours, e.g., Albanus, Candidus, Rufus, etc.
* from animals and birds, e.g., Agnes, Asellus, Columbia, Leo, Taurus, Ursula, etc.
* from agriculture, e.g., Agricia, Armentarius, Palmatinus, Stereorius, etc.
* from flowers, e.g., Balsamia, Flosculus, Narcissus, Rosula;
* from jewels, e.g., Chrysanthus, Margarites, Smaragdus;
* from military life or the sea, e.g., Emerentiana, Navigia, Pelagia, Seutarius, Thalassus;
* from countries, cities, rivers etc.; Afra, Cydnus, Galla, Jordanis, Macedonius, Maurus, Sabina, Sebastianus, etc.
* from the months e.g., Aprilis, Januaria, Junia, etc.
* from personal qualities, etc., e.g., Aristo, Hilarius, Modestus, Pudens, etc.;
* from servile condition, e.g., Servus, Servilianus, Vernacla;
* names of historical celebrity, e.g., Caesarius, Cornelia, Pompeius, Ptolemaeus, Vergilius

===Names with Christian origin and significance===
These include the following:&lt;ref name="Thurston1913"/&gt;

* apparently suggested by Christian dogmas, e.g. Anastasia, Athanasia, Christophorus, Redemptus, Restitutus, etc.
* from festivals or rites, e.g., Epiphanius, Eulogia, Natalis, Pascasia, Sabbatius and the frequently recurring Martyrius;
* from Christian virtues, e.g., Agape, Elpis, Fides, Irene, with such derivatives as Adelphius, Agapetus, Caritosa, etc.
* pious sentiment, e.g., Adeodata, Ambrosius, Benedictus, Deogratias, etc., and possibly such names as Gaudentianus, Hilarius, Sozomen, Victorianus, Vincentius

Though the recurrence of such names as Agnes, Balbina, Cornelius, Felicitas, Irenaeus, Justinus, etc. may be due to veneration for the martyrs who first used these names, the names of the [[New Testament]] are rarely found while those of the [[Old Testament]] are more common. Susanna, Daniel, Moyses, Tobias, occur frequently, but towards the end of the 4th century the name of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Blessed Lady]] becomes as familiar as those of the Apostles. Paulus may be an intentional reference to St. Paul, and Johannes, Andreas, and Petrus with derivatives such as Petronia, Petrius, Petronilla, etc. may also refer to the Apostles. The name of Mary occurs occasionally in the catacomb inscriptions towards the end of the 4th century, for example, in the form ''LIVIA MARIA IN PACE'',&lt;ref name="Thurston1913"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Rossi, "Rom. Sot.", I, 143&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a martyr Maria assigned to the date AD 256.&lt;ref name="Thurston1913"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Rossi, "Rom. Sot." III, 200 sqq. and compare other instances of the name, De Rossi, "Insc. Christ. I, 331; II, 160 and 173&lt;/ref&gt;

==Change of name at baptism==
In the Acts of St. Balsamus, who died AD 331, there is an early example of the connection between baptism and the giving of a name. "By my paternal name", this martyr is said to have declared, "I am called Balsamus, but by the spiritual name which I received in baptism, I am known as Peter." The assumption of a new name was fairly common amongst Christians. [[Eusebius]] the historian took the name Pamphili from [[Pamphilus of Caesarea|Pamphilus]], the martyr whom he especially venerated. Earlier still [[St. Cyprian]] chose to be called Cyprianus Caecilius out of gratitude to the Caecilius to whom he owed his conversion. [[Pope Dionysius of Alexandria|St. Dionysius of Alexandria]] (c. 260) declared, "I am of opinion that there were many of the same name as the [[John the Apostle|Apostle John]], who on account of their love for him, and because they admired and emulated him, and desired to be loved by the Lord as he was, took to themselves the same name, just as many of the children of the faithful are called Paul or Peter."&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, "Hist. Eccl.", VII, xxv&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thurston1913"/&gt;

The assumption of any such new name would take place formally at baptism, in which the [[catechumen]], then probably as now, had to be addressed by some distinctive appellation, and the imposition of a new name at baptism had become general. Every child had necessarily to receive some name or other, and when baptism followed soon after birth this allowed public recognition of the choice made.&lt;ref name="Thurston1913"/&gt;

In the thirtieth of the supposed ''Arabian Canons of Nicaea'': "Of giving only names of Christians in baptism"; but the sermons of [[St. John Chrysostom]] assume in many different places that the conferring of a name, presumably at baptism, ought to be regulated by some idea of Christian edification, and he implies that such had been the practice of earlier generations. For example, he says: "When it comes to giving the infant a name, caring not to call it after the saints, as the ancients at first did, people light lamps and give them names and so name the child after the one which continues burning the longest, from thence conjecturing that he will live a long time" (Hom. in Cor., xii, 13).&lt;ref name="Thurston1913"/&gt;

Similarly he commends the practice of the parents of [[Antioch]] in calling their children after the martyr Meletius ([[Patrologia Graeca|P.G.]] 50, 515) and urges his hearers not to give their children the first name that occurs, nor to seek to gratify fathers or grandfathers or other family connections by giving their names, but rather to choose the names of holy men conspicuous for virtue and for their courage before God (P.G. 53, 179). There are other historic examples of such a change of name in adult converts.&lt;ref name="Thurston1913"/&gt;

Socrates (Hist. Eccl., VII, xxi) wrote of Athenais who married the Emperor [[Theodosius II|Theodosius the Younger]], and who previously to marriage was baptized (AD 421) receiving the name Eudoxia.&lt;ref name="Thurston1913"/&gt;

[[Bede]] wrote that King [[Cædwalla of Wessex|Caedwalla]] went to Rome and was baptized by the [[Pope Sergius I|Pope Sergius]] who gave him the name of Peter. Dying soon afterwards he was buried in Rome and his epitaph beginning ''Hic depositus est Caedwalla qui est Petrus'' was pointed out (Bede, "Hist. Eccl.", V, vii).&lt;ref name="Thurston1913"/&gt;

Later [[Guthrum]] the Danish leader in England after his long contest with [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]] was eventually defeated, and consenting to accept Christianity was baptized in 878, taking the name Æthelstan.&lt;ref name="Thurston1913"/&gt;

==Practice regarding names==
Various Fathers and spiritual writers and synodal decrees have exhorted Christians to give no names to their children in baptism but those of canonized saints or of the angels of God, but at no point in the history of the Church were these injunctions strictly attended to.&lt;ref name="Thurston1913"/&gt;

They were not observed during the early or the later [[Middle Ages]]. In extensive lists of medieval names, such as those found in the indexes of legal proceedings which have been edited in modern times, while ordinary names without religious associations, such as William, Robert, Roger, Geoffrey, Hugh, etc. are common (William about the year 1200 was by far the most common Christian name in England), there are also a number of exceptional names which have apparently no religious associations at all. These include Ademar, Ailma, Ailward, Albreza, Alditha, Almaury, Ascelina, Avice, Aystorius (these come from the lists of those cured at the shrine of [[Thomas Becket|St. Thomas of Canterbury]]). A rubric in the official "[[Rituale Romanum]]" mandates that the priest ought to see that names of deities or of godless pagans are not given in baptism (''curet ne obscoena, fabulosa aut ridicula vel inanium deorum vel impiorum ethnicorum hominum nomina imponantur'').&lt;ref name="Thurston1913"/&gt;

A pronouncement from Bourges (1666) addressing parents and godparents urges: "Let them give to boys the names of male saints and to girls those of women saints as right order requires, and let them avoid the names of festivals like Easter (''Pâques''), Christmas (''Noël''), All Saints (''Toussaint'') and others that are sometimes chosen." Despite such injunctions "Toussaint" has become a common French Christian name and "Noël" has also found popularity abroad. The addition of Marie, especially in the form Jean-Marie, for girls, and of Joseph for boys is common in present-day France.&lt;ref name="Thurston1913"/&gt;

In Spain and Italy Marian festivals have also created names for girls: ''Concepción'', of which the diminutive is ''Concha'', as well as ''Asunción, Encarnación, Mercedes, Dolores'' etc. in Spanish, and in Italian ''Assunta, Annunziata, Concetta'', etc.
The name Mary has not always been a favourite for girls. In England in the 12th century, Mary as a Christian name was rare. The name George, often given in recognition of the [[Saint George]] the [[patron saint]] of England, was not common in the 13th and 14th centuries, though it grew in popularity after the [[Protestant Reformation]].&lt;ref name="Thurston1913"/&gt;

In the registers of [[Oxford University]] from 1560 to 1621, the more common names used by the students in order of popularity were: John, 3826; Thomas, 2777; William, 2546; Richard, 1691; Robert, 1222; Edward, 957; Henry, 908; George, 647; Francis, 447; James, 424; Nicholas, 326; Edmund, 298.&lt;ref name="Thurston1913"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see Oxford Hist. Soc. Transactions, XIV&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy and Spain it has always been common practice to call a child after the saint upon whose feast he is born.&lt;ref name="Thurston1913"/&gt;

==Confirmation names==
The practice of adopting a new name was not limited to baptism. Many medieval examples show that any notable change of condition, especially in the spiritual order, was often accompanied by the reception of a new name. In the 8th century, the two Englishmen Winfrith and Willibald going on different occasions to Rome received from the Pope, along with a new commission to preach, the names respectively of Boniface and Clement. [[Emma of Normandy]] when she married [[Æthelred the Unready|King Ethelred]] in 1002 took the name Ælfgifu; while the reception of a new, [[monastic name]] upon entering a religious order remains almost universal.&lt;ref name="Thurston1913"/&gt;

At confirmation, in which the interposition of a godfather emphasizes the resemblance with baptism, it has been customary to take a new name, but usually, use is made of it is infrequent. In the case of [[Henry III of France|Henry III]], King of France, godson of the English [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] had been christened Edouard Alexandre in 1551, the same French prince at confirmation received the name of Henri, and subsequently reigned under this name.&lt;ref name="Thurston1913"/&gt;

In England after the Reformation, the practice of adopting a new name at confirmation was still used, as Sir [[Edward Coke]] wrote that a man might validly buy land by his ''confirmation name'', and he recalled the case of a Sir [[Francis Gawdy|Francis Gawdye]], late [[Chief Justice of the Common Pleas]], whose name of baptism was Thomas and his name of confirmation Francis.&lt;ref name="Thurston1913"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Co. Litt. 3a&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18474">'''Cognitive ecology''' is the study of cognitive phenomena within social and natural contexts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hutchins|first=Edwin|date=2010-10-01|title=Cognitive Ecology|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2010.01089.x/abstract|journal=Topics in Cognitive Science|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|pages=705–715|doi=10.1111/j.1756-8765.2010.01089.x|issn=1756-8765}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an integrative perspective drawing from aspects of [[ecological psychology]], [[cognitive science]], [[evolutionary ecology]] and [[anthropology]]. Notions of domain-specific [[Modularity of mind|modules in the brain]] and the cognitive biases they create are central to understanding the [[Enactivism|enacted]] nature of cognition within a cognitive ecological framework. This means that cognitive mechanisms not only shape the characteristics of thought, but they dictate the success of [[Dual inheritance theory|culturally transmitted ideas]]. Because [[Dual inheritance theory|culturally transmitted]] concepts can often inform ecological decision-making behaviors, group-level trends in cognition (i.e., culturally salient concepts) are hypothesized to address ecologically relevant challenges.&lt;ref name="botero"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Botero|first1=Carlos A.|last2=Gardner|first2=Beth|last3=Kirby|first3=Kathryn R.|last4=Bulbulia|first4=Joseph|last5=Gavin|first5=Michael C.|last6=Gray|first6=Russell D.|title=The ecology of religious beliefs|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=25 November 2014|volume=111|issue=47|pages=16784–16789|doi=10.1073/pnas.1408701111|pmc=4250141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical basis ==
Cognitive ecology explores the interactive relationship between organism-environment interactions and its impact on cognitive phenomena.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Human cognition in this framework is multimodal and viewed similarly to [[Enactivism|enactivist]] perspectives on cognitive processing. For cultural concepts, this emphasizes cognitive distribution across an ecosystem, which is predicated on models of the [[extended mind thesis]].

=== Ecological psychology ===
While the multi-faceted nature of cognitive ecology is a consequence of its interdisciplinary history, it primarily derives from early work in ecological psychology. Paradigm shifts from behaviorist orientations of psychology to cognition, or the "cognitive revolution",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=George A|title=The cognitive revolution: a historical perspective|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=March 2003|volume=7|issue=3|pages=141–144|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00029-9|pmid=12639696}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="neisser"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neisser|first1=Ulric|title=Cognitive psychology.|date=1967|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=New York|isbn=978-0131396678}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave rise to the ecological psychology approach, which distanced itself from mainstream [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivist]] views by breaking down the common mind-environment dichotomy of psychological theory.&lt;ref name=":heft"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heft|first1=Harry|title=An ecological approach to psychology.|journal=Review of General Psychology|date=2013|volume=17|issue=2|pages=162–167|doi=10.1037/a0032928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One particularly influential progenitor of this work was ecological psychologist [[James J. Gibson|James Gibson]], whose legacy is marked by his ideas on ecological and social [[affordance]]s. These are the opportunistic features of environmental objects that can be exploited for human use, and are therefore particularly perceptible (e.g., a knob affords twisting, an agreeable social cue affords a warm reaction).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chemero|first1=Anthony|title=An outline of a theory of affordances|journal=Ecological Psychology|date=2003|volume=15|issue=2|pages=181–195|doi=10.1207/s15326969eco1502_5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson argued further that organisms cannot be disentangled from their environments, and that their cognitive constraints were consequences of a limited set of environmental invariants which shaped them over evolutionary time.&lt;ref name=":heft" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibson|first1=James J.|title=The ecological approach to visual perception|date=1986|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York|isbn=0898599598|edition=[Nachdr.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; An illustrative example for Gibson is the human capacity for three-dimensional visual perception, which he argues is a cognitive concept resulting from the way that people interact with their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibson|first1=James|title=The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception|date=1979|isbn=978-1848725782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another foreshadowed element of cognitive ecological theory comes from ecological anthropologist [[Gregory Bateson]], who considered the notion of informational feedback loops between mind and environment, particularly their role in generating meaning and awareness of one's surroundings. In an essay, he speculates on how an observer might best delineate the "self" of a blind man. In his treatment, he questions whether one may arbitrarily choose to carve out the man's informational processing loop at his brain or his hands or his walking stick without offering an incomplete view of his cognitive process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bateson|first1=Gregory|title=Steps to an ecology of mind|date=2000|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago [u.a.]|isbn=0-226-03905-6|edition=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discussion of concept remains influential in modern cognitive ecological considerations of the densely interconnected elements of ecology that play relevant roles in cognition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Enactivism ===
An enactive perspective of cognition is fundamental to a cognitive ecological view.&lt;ref name=":enactive"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Palacios|first1=AG|last2=Bozinovic|first2=F|title=An "enactive" approach to integrative and comparative biology: thoughts on the table.|journal=Biological research|date=2003|volume=36|issue=1|pages=101–5|pmid=12795209|doi=10.4067/s0716-97602003000100008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than a passive interpretation of internally represented information, cognition is considered to be an active process involving the transformation of information into meaningful relationships between the organism and its environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Noë|first1=Alva|title=Action in perception|date=2004|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0262140888|edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; For humans then, a perceived environment is only constructed insofar as cognitive constraints will allow. In other words, they "enact a world" by building perspectives out of ecological information, using their evolved cognitive equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stewart|first1=edited by John|last2=Gapenne,|first2=Olivier|last3=Paolo|first3=Ezequiel A. Di|title=Enaction Toward a New Paradigm for Cognitive Science.|date=2014|publisher=Bradford Books|isbn=978-0262526012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extended cognition ==
Cognitive ecology borrows ideas from views of [[extended cognition]], as articulated by Chalmers and Clark (1998). They argue that humans cognitively utilize elements of their environment to aid the cognitive process and further entangle the mind-environment relationship as a result. They illustrate their claim with a hypothetical example of two people who achieve the same navigational success through a museum by different means; a person with Alzheimer's may use a notebook with written directions, while another may use her memory. The primary difference between the two people is that the former outsourced his memory to readily available external representations of information about the museum, whereas the latter relied on internal representations. A variant of this concept they also consider is socially extended cognition, which is a similar outsourcing of cognitive representations into other peoples' minds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clark|first1=A.|last2=Chalmers|first2=D.|title=The Extended Mind|journal=Analysis|date=1 January 1998|volume=58|issue=1|pages=7–19|doi=10.1093/analys/58.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas elaborate a cognitive interpretation of broader anthropological notions maintaining that humans are a species deeply entangled in social and material elements of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hodder|first1=Ian|title=Entangled. ; An Archaeology of the Relationships Between Humans and Things.|date=2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Incorporated|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-470-67212-9|edition=first publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distributed cognition ===
[[Distributed cognition]] is an important model of the extended mind thesis for cognitive ecological theory put forth by Edwin Hutchins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hutchins|first1=Edwin|title=Distributed cognition|journal=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cogwild"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hutchins|first1=Edwin|title=Cognition in the wild|date=1996|publisher=The MIT Press (A Bradford Book)|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780262581462|edition=8. pr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conceptualizes human groups as active networks with cognitive properties of their own, much like neural networks themselves yield emergent cognitive properties. For a social group, cognitive properties are disseminated into an individual's surrounding network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heylighen|first1=Heath|author2=Van Overwalle|title=The Emergence of Distributed Cognition: a conceptual framework|journal=Proceedings of Collective Intentionality IV|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cognitive properties of a group, Hutchins notes, is completely distinct from a given those of an individual.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Distributed cognition is fundamentally contingent on and emergent from trending ideas among a collection of brains and artefacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rogers|first1=Ellis|title=Distributed Cognition: an alternative framework for analysing and explaining collaborative working|journal=Journal of Information Technology|date=1994|volume=9|issue=2|pages=119–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is conceptually similar to models of collective cognition in other social animal groups, which use [[Agent-based model|agent based models]] to understanding insect swarming, fish schooling, bird flocking and baboon pack behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strandburg-Peshkin|first1=A.|last2=Farine|first2=D. R.|last3=Couzin|first3=I. D.|last4=Crofoot|first4=M. C.|title=Shared decision-making drives collective movement in wild baboons|journal=Science|date=18 June 2015|volume=348|issue=6241|pages=1358–1361|doi=10.1126/science.aaa5099|pmid=26089514|pmc=4801504}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="couzin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Couzin|first1=Iain D.|title=Collective cognition in animal groups|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=January 2009|volume=13|issue=1|pages=36–43|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2008.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Couzin|first1=Iain|title=Collective minds|journal=Nature|date=15 February 2007|volume=445|issue=7129|pages=715–715|doi=10.1038/445715a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collective cognition in social animal groups is adaptive because the group can amplify its overall responsiveness to ecological cues.&lt;ref name="couzin" /&gt; Likewise, the computational power of a human group can be more effective than that of even its best individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clément|first1=Romain J. G.|last2=Krause|first2=Stefan|last3=von Engelhardt|first3=Nikolaus|last4=Faria|first4=Jolyon J.|last5=Krause|first5=Jens|last6=Kurvers|first6=Ralf H. J. M.|last7=de Polavieja|first7=GonzaloÂ G.|title=Collective Cognition in Humans: Groups Outperform Their Best Members in a Sentence Reconstruction Task|journal=PLoS ONE|date=17 October 2013|volume=8|issue=10|pages=e77943|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0077943|pmid=24147101|pmc=3798465}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is echoed by anthropologists noting the [[collective intentionality]] of cultural institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tomasello|first1=Michael|last2=Melis|first2=Alicia P.|last3=Tennie|first3=Claudio|last4=Wyman|first4=Emily|last5=Herrmann|first5=Esther|title=Two Key Steps in the Evolution of Human Cooperation|journal=Current Anthropology|date=December 2012|volume=53|issue=6|pages=673–692|doi=10.1086/668207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Existing models of cultural learning dynamics seem to articulate the mechanisms by which information is acquired by and distributed within groups. In particular, [[cultural evolution]] theorists assert that individual learning is required for tracking environmental dynamics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henrich|first1=Joseph|last2=McElreath|first2=Richard|title=The evolution of cultural evolution|journal=Evolutionary Anthropology: Issues, News, and Reviews|date=19 May 2003|volume=12|issue=3|pages=123–135|doi=10.1002/evan.10110}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this information is retained in culture by social learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyd|first1=R.|last2=Richerson|first2=P. J.|last3=Henrich|first3=J.|title=The cultural niche: Why social learning is essential for human adaptation|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=20 June 2011|volume=108|issue=Supplement_2|pages=10918–10925|doi=10.1073/pnas.1100290108|pmid=21690340|pmc=3131818}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Hutchins, this theoretical similarity is not a coincidence. After describing distributed cognitive networks and their relationships with ecological dynamics as "cognitive ecosystems", he defines culture as a "shorthand way of referring to a complex cognitive ecosystem."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Applications to cultural concepts ==

=== Religious beliefs ===
{{main|Cognitive ecology of religion}}
Religious behaviors typically exist in the form of ritual and correspond to religious god concepts.&lt;ref name="pursosis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Purzycki &amp; Sosis|editor1-last=Ulrich|editor1-first=Frey|title=Essential Building Blocks of Human Nature|date=2011|chapter=Our Gods: Variation in Supernatural Minds}}&lt;/ref&gt; These behaviors are phenotypic outcomes of god concepts that are ultimately subject to natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Codding|first1=Brian F.|last2=Bird|first2=Douglas W.|title=Behavioral ecology and the future of archaeological science|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=April 2015|volume=56|pages=9–20|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2015.02.027}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cronk|first1=Lee|title=Human Behavioral Ecology|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|date=1991|volume=20|issue=1|pages=25–53|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.20.1.25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cognitive ecology of religion|Cognitive ecologists who study religion]] predict that god concepts across cultures can be linked to [[Coordination game|coordination solutions]] for local socioecological challenges, such as large-scale cooperation, intragroup cohesion and commitment, and resource management.&lt;ref name="botero"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advances in Religion, Cognitive Science and Experimental Philosophy|last=Purzycki|first=|last2=McNamara|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=An Ecological Theory of Gods' Minds}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an omniscient and morally punitive "Big God" may be adaptive for large-scale populations by motivating prosocial behavior,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Norenzayan|first1=Ara|last2=Shariff|first2=Azim F.|last3=Gervais|first3=Will M.|last4=Willard|first4=Aiyana K.|last5=McNamara|first5=Rita A.|last6=Slingerland|first6=Edward|last7=Henrich|first7=Joseph|title=The cultural evolution of prosocial religions|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=2 December 2014|volume=39|doi=10.1017/S0140525X14001356}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas gods associated with small-scale societies are often concerned about the stability of local resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin Grant|title=The Evolution of Gods' Minds in the Tyva Republic|journal=Current Anthropology|date=13 April 2016|pages=S000–S000|doi=10.1086/685729|volume=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic exchange ===
Social contracts and their associated fairness norms are thought by many economists to be contingent on means of production. A hunter-gatherer society, for instance, may operate at an equilibrium where each person contributes to the best of his or her ability and receives according to need. But if this society were to shift toward larger-scale agricultural practices, this equilibrium would be destabilized by increases in free riding and general temptations to profit by defecting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Binmore|first1=Ken|title=Economic man – or straw man?|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=22 December 2005|volume=28|issue=06|doi=10.1017/S0140525X05230145}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been supported empirically in cross-cultural studies using [[Experimental economics|experimental economic]] game data, which showed a wide range of variance in fairness expectations between populations based on culturally-specific exchange concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henrich|first1=Boyd|author2=Bowles|author3=Camerer|author4=Fehr|author5=Gintis|author6=McElreath|author7=Aivard|author8=Barr|author9=Ensminger|author10=Henrich|author11=Hill|author12=Gil-White|author13=Gurven|author14=Marlowe|author15=Patton|author16=Tracer|title="Economic man" in cross-cultural perspective: Behavioral experiments in 15 small-scale societies|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=2005|volume=28|doi=10.1017/s0140525x05000142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gachter|first1=S.|last2=Herrmann|first2=B.|last3=Thoni|first3=C.|title=Culture and cooperation|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=2 August 2010|volume=365|issue=1553|pages=2651–2661|doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This shift in fairness expectations has also been implicated in archaeological data. In particular, the relaxed sharing norms hypothesized to be built upon periods of successful maize exploitation in the pre-Hispanic Pueblo Southwest seemed to be eroded by decreases in agricultural success. In other words, when crops began to fail and supply became low, cultural exchange norms became more stringent, kin-based and based on [[Reciprocal altruism|reciprocity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bocinsky|first1=R. K.|last2=Rush|first2=J.|last3=Kintigh|first3=K. W.|last4=Kohler|first4=T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1975">The '''Effort Sharing Regulation''' is a policy framework, part of the [[European Union climate and energy package]].

It sets binding national [[greenhouse gas]] targets for each of the 28 Member States of the [[European Union]], collectively amounting to a 30% cut in emissions by 2030 (from a 2005 baseline).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Factsheet on the Commission's proposal on binding greenhouse gas emission reductions for Member States (2021-2030) | publisher=[[European Commission]] | url =http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-16-2499_en.htm | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its predecessor, the Effort Sharing Decision, covered the years up to 2020. which collectively amount to a 10% cut in emissions between 2005-2020. These cuts come from areas including transport, buildings and heat, and agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=The Effort Sharing Decision | publisher=European Commission | url =http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/effort/index_en.htm | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the companion policy to the [[European Union Emissions Trading System]], which covers emission cuts in power and industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=The Effort Sharing Dinosaur | publisher=Sandbag | url =https://sandbag.org.uk/blog/2016/may/27/effort-sharing-dinosaur/ | date=2016-05-26 | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==

As the starting level of the reduction is actually too high, in the end a reduction of only 25.5 % will be achieved, not the desired and declared 30 %. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Looking for a perfect fit | publisher=Sandbag | url =https://sandbag.org.uk/2017/11/16/lookingforaperfectfit_esr/ | date=2017-11-16 | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article includes a '''chart representing production, consumption, exports and imports of [[electricity]] by country'''. 

== Methodology ==
Below the numbers there is specified which position a country holds by the corresponding parameter. Dependent territories, not fully recognized countries and supranational entities are not ranked. By default countries are ranked by their total electricity production.

All data is taken from [[CIA World Factbook]]. Note that data related to one parameter may be more up to date than data related to some other.

[[Djibouti]] had no proven reserves of [[oil]] or [[natural gas]], or refining capacity, Djibouti has no known reserves of [[coal]]. The country's  is supplied primarily by thermal plants (about 120 MW) and some imported hydro energy from [[Ethiopia]]. However, the supplemental supply of power from Ethiopia does not always satisfy Djibouti’s demand for power.&lt;ref&gt;DJIBOUTI
POWER AFRICA FACT SHEET [https://www.usaid.gov/powerafrica/djibouti]&lt;/ref&gt; Based on 2013 data, Djibouti’s national electrification rate reached 50%, (14% in rural areas, 61% in urban areas).

==Electricity==
The peak annual demand in 2014 was about 90 MW but is expected that it will grow to about 300 MW by around 2020. Electricity supply services are provided through the vertically integrated utility Electricité de Djibouti (EDD). A small amount of additional energy is generated by a solar plant (300 kW capacity). Djibouti has wind and geothermal generation potential and is actively studying these options. 

==Petroleum==
All petroleum products are imported. In 2002, imports of refined petroleum products totaled {{convert|11410|oilbbl/d}}, with consumption placed at {{convert|11400|oilbbl/d}}. There were no natural gas imports for that year. The port in Djibouti's capital city is an important oil shipment and storage site.

[[File:Portage Park Chicago flagstone steps.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Portage Park (Chicago)|Portage Park]] in [[Chicago]] is known for its flagstone decorations.]]

'''Flagstone''' ('''flag''') is a generic flat [[Rock (geology)|stone]], usually used for [[Sidewalk|paving]] slabs or walkways, patios, fences and roofing. It may be used for memorials, [[headstone]]s, [[facade]]s and other construction. The name derives from [[Middle English]] ''flagge'' meaning turf, perhaps from [[Old Norse]] ''flaga'' meaning slab or chip.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/flag%5B5%5D Etymology of Flag]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Westray House.jpg|thumb|left|House on [[Westray]], [[Orkney]], with flagstone roof]]
Flagstone is a [[sedimentary rock]] that is split into layers along [[Bed (geology)|bedding planes]]. Flagstone is usually a form of a [[sandstone]] composed of [[feldspar]] and [[quartz]] and is [[arenaceous]] in grain size (0.16&amp;nbsp;mm – 2&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter). The material that binds flagstone is usually composed of [[silica]], [[calcite]], or [[iron oxide]].  The rock color usually comes from these cementing materials.  Typical flagstone colors are red, blue, and [[Buff (color)|buff]], though exotic colors exist.

Flagstone is [[Quarry|quarried]] in places with bedded sedimentary rocks with [[Fissility (geology)|fissile]] bedding planes. Examples include [[Arizona flagstone]] and [[Pennsylvania Bluestone]].

[[File:Parement de lauze Lannion Bretagne.JPG|thumb|upright|Lauze stone in [[Lannion]] ([[Brittany]])]]
Around the thirteenth century, the ceilings, walls and floors in European architecture became more ornate. Anglo-Saxons in particular used flagstones as flooring materials in the interior rooms of [[castle]]s and other structures.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Henry Smith (1910). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=f_g4AAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=flagstone%20in%20european%20architecture&amp;pg=PA154#v=onepage&amp;q=flagstone%20in%20european%20architecture&amp;f=false A history of science, Volume 9]'', p. 154. Harper Brothers, New York and London.&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[Lindisfarne Castle]] in [[England]] and [[Muchalls Castle]] (14th century) in [[Scotland]] are among many examples of buildings with surviving flagstone floors.

Flagstone shingles are a traditional roofing material, a type of [[roof shingle]] commonly used in the [[Alps]], where they are laid dry, often held in place with pegs or hooks. In the [[Aosta Valley]], Italy, stone shingles are mandatory to cover buildings in historical areas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6246">The '''growing season''' is the part of the year during which local weather conditions (i.e. rainfall and temperature) permit normal [[plant morphology#Growth|plant growth]]. While each [[plant]] or [[crop]] has a specific growing season that depends on its genetic [[adaptation]], growing seasons can generally be grouped into macro-environmental classes.

==Geography==
Geographic conditions have major impacts on the growing season for any given area. The elevation, or the height above sea level, and temperature of a region are two of the main factors that affect the growing season. Generally speaking, the distance a location is from the equator can be a strong indicator as to what the growing season will look like, however in a high elevation area, regardless of proximity to the equator, a shorter growing season will generally be experienced.
Proximity to the ocean also can create less extreme conditions, especially in terms of temperature, which has the potential to extend the growing season further in either direction.
In hotter climates, particularly in deserts, despite the geographic barrier of limited water sources, people have been able to extend their growing season in these regions by way of diverting water from other areas and using it in their agriculture. The ability to use these irrigation methods, despite geographic challenges, has made it possible to enjoy almost a year-round growing season.

==Season extension==
In [[agriculture]], [[season extension]] is anything that allows a [[crop]] to be cultivated beyond its normal outdoor growing season. Examples include [[greenhouse]]s, [[polytunnel]]s, [[row cover]], and [[cloche (agriculture)|cloche]]s.

== Locations ==

=== North America ===
In the United States and Canada, the growing season usually refers to the time between two dates: the last frost in the spring and the first hard frost in the fall. Specifically, it is defined as the period of time between the average last date at which the overnight low temperature drops below {{convert|32|°F|°C|order=flip}} in the spring and the average date at which the overnight low first drops down below {{convert|32|°F|°C|order=flip}} in the fall. These average last and first frost dates have reportedly been occurring earlier and later, respectively, at a steady rate, as observed over the last 30 years. As a result, the overall observed length of the growing season in the United States has increased by about two weeks in the last 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|title=Length of Growing Season|journal=Climate Change Indicators in the United States, Third Edition|date=2014|pages=80–81|url=http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/indicators|accessdate=2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the cooler areas of North America, specifically the northern regions of the United States and Canada, the growing season is observed to be between April or May and goes through October.  A longer season starts as early as February or March along the lower East Coast from northern [[Florida]] to [[South Carolina]], along the Gulf coast in south [[Texas]] and southern [[Louisiana]], and along the West Coast from coastal [[Oregon]] southward and can continue all the way through November or December. The longest growing season is found in central and south Florida where many tropical fruits are grown year round. These rough timetables vary significantly for areas that are at higher elevations or close to the ocean.

Because several crops grown in the United States require a long period of growth, growing [[season extension]] practices are commonly used as well. These include various row-covering techniques, such as using [[cold frame]]s and garden fabric over crops. Greenhouses are also a common practice to extend the season, particularly in elevated regions that only enjoy 90-day growing seasons.

===Europe===
In much of Europe, the growing season is defined as the average number of days a year with a 24-hour average temperature of at least 5&amp;nbsp;°C (6&amp;nbsp;°C is sometimes used). This is typically from April until October or November, although this varies considerably with [[latitude]] and altitude. The growing season is almost year-round in most of Portugal and Spain, and may be only from June to September in northern [[Finland]] and the higher [[Alps]]. Proximity to the [[Gulf Stream]] and other maritime mediations of temperature extremes can extend the season.

In the United Kingdom, the growing season is defined as starting when the temperature on five consecutive days exceeds 5&amp;nbsp;°C, and ends after five consecutive days of temperatures below 5&amp;nbsp;°C. The 1961 to 1990 average season length was {{Convert|252|days|months}}.

===Tropics and deserts===
In some warm climates, such as the subtropical [[savanna]] and [[Sonoran Desert]]s or in the drier [[Mediterranean climate]]s, the growing season is limited by the availability of water, with little growth in the dry season. Unlike in cooler climates where snow or soil freezing is a generally insurmountable obstacle to plant growth, it is often possible to greatly extend the growing season in hot climates by [[irrigation]] using water from cooler and/or wetter regions. This can in fact go so far as to allow year-round growth in areas that without irrigation could only support [[xerophytic]] plants.
Also in these tropical regions; the growing season can be interrupted by periods of heavy rainfall, called the rainy season. For example, in Colombia, where coffee is grown and can be harvested year-round, they don’t see a rainy season. However, in Indonesia, another large coffee-producing area, they experience this rainy season and the growth of the coffee beans is interrupted.&lt;ref name="National Geographic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/encyclopedia/growing-season/?ar_a=1|title=Growing season|website=National Geographic|accessdate=2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The High Alps have [[tundra climate|tundra]] or [[Ice cap climate|ice cap]]  climate rather than the  [[Alpine climate]] eponymous of the Alpine region at 1,800-2,500 m, above the tree-line but still amenable to transhumance economy. 

[[Exploration of the High Alps]] began in the 18th century, with [[Horace-Bénédict de Saussure]]. The first ascent of the highest peak of the alps, [[Mont Blanc]], dates to 1786.

All important [[List of mountain passes in Switzerland|mountain passes in Switzerland]] are below 2,500 m (with [[Nufenen Pass]] as high as 2,478 m) but there are a few minor foot passes above 3,000 m:   [[Schöllijoch]] at 3,343 m, [[Theodul Pass]] at 3,301 m, [[Zwischbergen Pass]] at 3,268 m, and others. Of historical interest is the [[Schnidejoch]] at 2,756 m which appears to have served as a pass since [[prehistoric Switzerland|prehistoric times]]. In other Alpine countries there are higher road passes, such as the [[Col de l'Iseran]] (the highest paved road in Europe) in France and the [[Stelvio Pass]] in Italy.

The alpine [[snow line|line of perpetual snow]] is not fixed. The occurrence of favorable meteorological conditions during several successive seasons can increase the extent of the snowfields and lower the limit of seemingly permanent snow, while the opposite may cause the limit to rise higher on the flanks of the mountains.  In some parts of the Alps the limit is about 2,400 m   elevation, while in others it cannot be placed much below 2,900 m. As very little snow remains on rocks angled more than 60°, this is soon removed by the wind, some steep masses of rock remain bare even near the summits of the highest peaks, but as almost every spot offering the least hold for vegetation is covered with snow, few flowering plants are seen above 3,350 m.

The climate of the glacial region has often been compared to that of the [[polar region]]s, but they are very different. Here, intense solar radiation by day, which raises the surface when dry to a temperature approaching 27°C, alternates with severe frost by night. There, the Sun, which never sets is only able to send feeble rays that maintain a low temperature, rarely rising more than a few degrees above the freezing point. Hence the upper region of the Alps sustains a far more varied and brilliant vegetation.

[[File:Detailed Power usage.png|thumb|200px|right|Example of detailed power finger prints]]

A '''home energy monitor''' provides feedback on electrical energy use.  Devices may also display cost of energy used, and estimates of greenhouse gas emissions.  Various studies have shown a reduction in home energy use of 4-15% through use of home energy display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report| url = http://www.idc.com/EI/getdoc.jsp?containerId=EI211079 |
title = In-Home Display Units: An Evolving Market, Part 1 | author = Jan Borstein, Karen Blackmore | date = March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electricity use may be measured with an [[Current clamp|inductive clamp]] placed around the electric main, via the [[electric meter]] (either through an optical port, or by sensing the meters actions), by communicating with a smart meter, or by direct connection to the electrical system. The display portion may be remote from the measurement, communicating with the sensor using a cable, network, [[power line communication]]s, or using radio. Online displays are also available which allow the user to use an internet connected display to show near real-time consumption.

A means to [[energy conservation|reduce household energy consumption]] is to provide real-time feedback to homeowners so they can change their energy use. In 2010, UK based Current Cost announced a partnership with [[Google PowerMeter]], a former online tool that connected to Current Cost devices, enabling users to receive real-time energy information on their customised Google homepage, wherever they were. Real-time data on how much energy is being consumed in the home was sent directly to the Google PowerMeter. The free software tool then visualised the information for users to view on their own iGoogle homepage, a personal web portal which enabled individuals to create and access a wide range of customisable information, web feeds and Google Gadgets.
'''Note''' Google Power Meter is now defunct.

A study using the PowerCost Monitor deployed in 500 Ontario homes by ''[[Hydro One]]'' showed an average 6.5% drop in total electricity use when compared with a similarly sized control group. ''Hydro One'' subsequently offered free power monitors to 30,000 customers based on the success of the pilot.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energetics.com/madri/pdfs/ChartwellHydroOneMonitoringProgram.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Blue Line Innovations also indicates 100,000 units in the market today.

Another study carried out in the city of Sabadell (Spain) in 2009 using the efergy e2 in 29 households during a six-month period came to 11.8% on a weekly comparison between the first and last weeks of the campaign. On a monthly basis, the savings were 14.3%. Expected annual CO2 savings for all households is estimated to be 4.1 tonnes; projected CO2 emissions savings for 2020 are 180.6 tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.managenergy.net/resources/1416&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009 the government of the state of [[Queensland]], [[Australia]] began offering wireless energy monitors as part of its ClimateSmart Home Service program.  By August 2009, almost 100,000 homes had signed up for the service, by August 2010 that number had risen to 200,000 homes.&lt;ref&gt;http://statements.cabinet.qld.gov.au/MMS/StatementDisplaySingle.aspx?id=65667 and http://statements.cabinet.qld.gov.au/MMS/StatementDisplaySingle.aspx?id=70926&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the program more than 335,000 households across Queensland had received the service with the Elite energy monitoring device supplied by Efergy Technologies.

In mid-2013 the government of the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]] enabled Zigbee-based In-Home Displays to be connected to Victorian Smart Meter &lt;ref&gt;http://www.switchon.vic.gov.au/how-can-i-take-charge-of-my-power-bill/energy-saver-incentive/in-home-&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ice''' is [[water]] [[freezing|frozen]] into a [[solid]] state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ice|title=Definition of ICE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/ice|title=the definition of ice|website=www.dictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the presence of [[Impurity|impurities]] such as particles of soil or bubbles of air&lt;!--was: air inclusions--&gt;, it can appear transparent or a more or less [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] bluish-white color.

In the [[Solar System]], ice is abundant and occurs naturally from as close to the Sun as [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] to as far away as the [[Oort cloud]] objects. Beyond the Solar System, it occurs as [[interstellar ice]]. It is abundant on [[Earth]]'s surface{{spaced ndash}}particularly [[Polar ice cap|in the polar regions]] and above the [[snow line]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.jhuapl.edu/techdigest/TD/td2602/Prockter.pdf |title=Ice in the Solar System |author=Prockter, Louise M. |journal=Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest |volume=26 |issue=2 |year=2005 |page=175 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319063545/http://www.jhuapl.edu/techdigest/TD/td2602/Prockter.pdf |archivedate=19 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{spaced ndash}}and, as a common form of [[precipitation]] and [[Deposition (phase transition)|deposition]], plays a key role in Earth's [[water cycle]] and [[climate]]. It falls as snowflakes and hail or occurs as frost, icicles or [[ice spike]]s.

Ice [[molecule]]s can exhibit eighteen or more different [[Phase (matter)|phase]]s ([[Sphere packing|packing geometries]]) that depend on temperature and pressure. When water is cooled rapidly (quenching), up to three different types of [[amorphous ice]] can form depending on the history of its pressure and temperature. When cooled slowly correlated proton tunneling occurs below {{cvt|20|K|C|0}} giving rise to [[macroscopic quantum phenomena]]. Virtually all the ice on Earth's surface and in its atmosphere is of a [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]] [[Crystal structure|crystalline structure]] denoted as [[Ice Ih|ice I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;]] (spoken as "ice one h") with minute traces of cubic ice denoted as [[Ice Ic|ice I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;]]. The most common [[phase transition]] to ice I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; occurs when liquid water is cooled below {{val|0|ul=°C}} ({{val|273.15|ul=K}}, {{val|32|ul=°F}}) at [[standard atmospheric pressure]]. It may also be [[Deposition (phase transition)|deposited]] directly by [[water vapor]], as happens in the formation of frost. The transition from ice to water is melting and from ice directly to water vapor is [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]].

Ice is used in a variety of ways, including cooling, [[winter sport]]s and [[ice sculpture]].

As a naturally occurring crystalline inorganic solid with an ordered structure, ice fits the properties of a [[mineral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WFefWAq1Sh0C&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=ice+mineral+as+has+crystalline+structure&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiC5dPJ1u7TAhUV52MKHQGjA_sQ6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=ice%20mineral%20as%20has%20crystalline%20structure&amp;f=false|title=Methane Gas Hydrate|last=Demirbas|first=Ayhan|date=2010-02-28|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781848828728|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It possesses a regular [[crystalline]] structure based on the [[molecule]] of water, which consists of a single [[oxygen]] atom [[covalently]] bonded to two [[hydrogen atom]]s, or H–O–H. However, many of the physical properties of water and ice are controlled by the formation of [[hydrogen bond]]s between adjacent oxygen and hydrogen atoms; while it is a weak bond, it is nonetheless critical in controlling the structure of both water and ice.

An unusual property of ice frozen at atmospheric pressure is that the solid is approximately 8.3% less dense than liquid water (which is equivalent to volumetric expansion of 9%). The [[density]] of ice is 0.9167&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Properties of Ice and Supercooled Water |first=Allan H. |last=Harvey |editor1= Haynes, William M. |editor2 = Lide, David R. |editor3=Bruno, Thomas J. |title = CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics |edition = 97th |location = Boca Raton, FL |publisher = CRC Press |year = 2017 |isbn = 978-1-4987-5429-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;–0.9168&lt;ref name=Voitkovskii/&gt;&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 0&amp;nbsp;°C and standard atmospheric pressure (101,325 Pa), whereas water has a density of 0.9998&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;–0.999863&lt;ref name=Voitkovskii/&gt; g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at the same temperature and pressure. Liquid water is densest, essentially 1.00&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, at 4&amp;nbsp;°C and becomes less dense as the water molecules begin to form the [[Hexagonal (crystal system)|hexagonal]] [[crystal]]s&lt;ref&gt;The word ''crystal'' derives from Greek word for frost.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[ice crystals|ice]] as the freezing point is reached. This is due to hydrogen bonding dominating the intermolecular forces, which results in a packing of molecules less compact in the solid. Density of ice increases slightly with decreasing temperature and has a value of 0.9340 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at −180&amp;nbsp;°C (93 K).&lt;ref&gt;{{RubberBible86th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When water freezes, it increases in volume (about 9% for fresh water).&lt;ref&gt;Sreepat, Jain. ''Fundamentals of Physical Geology''. New Delhi: Springer, India, Private, 2014. 135. Print. {{ISBN|978-81-322-1538-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of expansion during freezing can be dramatic, and ice expansion is a basic cause of [[freeze-thaw]] weathering of rock in nature and damage to building foundations and roadways from [[frost heaving]]. It is also a common cause of the flooding of houses when water pipes burst due to the pressure of expanding water when it freezes.

The result of this process is that ice (in its most common form) floats on liquid water, which is an important feature in Earth's [[biosphere]]. It has been argued that without this property, natural bodies of water would freeze, in some cases permanently, from the bottom up,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/1998/05/01/water-water|title=Water, Water|author=Tyson, Neil deGrasse|publisher=haydenplanetarium.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726095920/http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/1998/05/01/water-water|archivedate=26 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a loss of bottom-dependent animal and plant life in fresh and sea water. Sufficiently thin [[ice sheet]]s allow light to pass through while protecting the underside from short-term weather extremes such as [[wind chill]]. This creates a sheltered environment for bacterial and algal colonies. When sea water freezes, the ice is riddled with brine-filled channels which sustain [[Sympagic ecology|sympagic organisms]] such as bacteria, algae, copepods and annelids, which in turn provide food for animals such as krill and specialised fish like the [[bald notothen]], fed upon in turn by larger animals such as [[emperor penguins]] and [[minke whales]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acecrc.sipex.aq/access/page/?page=d664da82-b244-102a-8ea7-0019b9ea7c60 Sea Ice Ecology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321204557/http://www.acecrc.sipex.aq/access/page/?page=d664da82-b244-102a-8ea7-0019b9ea7c60 |date=21 March 2012 }}. Acecrc.sipex.aq. Retrieved 30 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

When ice melts, it absorbs as much [[Heat|energy]] as it would take to heat an equivalent mass of water by 80&amp;nbsp;°C. During the melting process, the temperature remains constant at 0&amp;nbsp;°C. While melting, any energy added breaks the hydrogen bonds between ice (water) molecules. Energy becomes available to increase the thermal energy (temperature) only after enough hydrogen bonds are broken that the ice can be considered liquid water. The amount of energy consumed in breaking hydrogen bonds in the transition from ice to water is known as the ''[[heat of fusion]]''.

As with water, ice absorbs light at the red end of the spectrum preferentially as the result of an overtone of an oxygen–hydrogen (O–H) bond stretch. Compared with water, this absorption is shifted toward slightly lower energies. Thus, ice appears blue, with a slightly greener tint than liquid water. Since absorption is cumulative, the color effect intensifies with increasing thickness or if internal reflections cause the light to take a longer path through the ice.&lt;ref name=color&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lynch, David K.  |author2=Livingston, William Charles |title=Color and light in nature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Abp5FdhskAC&amp;pg=PA161|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-77504-5|pages=161–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other colors can appear in the presence of light absorbing impurities, where the impurity is dictating the color rather than the ice itself. For instance, [[iceberg]]s containing impurities (e.g., sediments, algae, air bubbles) can appear brown, grey or green.&lt;ref name=color/&gt;

Most liquids under increased pressure freeze at ''higher'' temperatures because the pressure helps to hold the molecules together. However, the strong hydrogen bonds in water make it different: For some pressures higher than {{convert|1|atm|MPa|abbr=on}}, water freezes at a temperature ''below'' 0&amp;nbsp;°C, as shown in the phase diagram below.

As well as crystalline forms, solid water can exist in amorphous states as [[amorphous ice]] (ASW) of varying densities. Water in the [[interstellar medium]] is dominated by amorphous ice, making it likely the most common form of water in the universe. Low-density ASW (LDA), also known as hyperquenched glassy water, may be responsible for [[noctilucent clouds]] on Earth and is usually formed by [[vapor deposition|deposition]] of water vapor in cold or vacuum conditions. High-density ASW (HDA) is formed by compression of ordinary ice I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; or LDA at GPa pressures. Very-high-density ASW (VHDA) is HDA slightly warmed to 160K under 1–2 GPa pressures.

In outer space, hexagonal crystalline ice (the predominant form found on Earth) is extremely rare. Amorphous ice is more common; however, hexagonal crystalline ice can be formed by volcanic action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/09/science/09ice.html|title=Astronomers Contemplate Icy Volcanoes in Far Places|author=Chang, Kenneth|work=The New York Times|date=9 December 2004|accessdate=30 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509123243/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/09/science/09ice.html|archivedate=9 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[Amorphous ice]]
| [[Amorphous]] ice is an ice lacking crystal structure. Amorphous ice exists in three forms: low-density (LDA) formed at atmospheric pressure, or below, high density (HDA) and very high density amorphous ice (VHDA), forming at higher pressures. LDA forms by extremely quick cooling of liquid water ("hyperquenched glassy water", HGW), by depositing water vapour on very cold substrates ("amorphous solid water", ASW) or by heating high density forms of ice at ambient pressure ("LDA").

===Friction properties===
[[File:Frozen Wappinger Creek.JPG|thumb|Frozen waterfall in southeast [[New York (state)|New York]]]]

The low coefficient of friction ("slipperiness") of ice has been attributed to the pressure of an object coming into contact with the ice, melting a thin layer of the ice and allowing the object to glide across the surface.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, the blade of an ice skate, upon exerting pressure on the ice, would melt a thin layer, providing lubrication between the ice and the blade. This explanation, called "pressure melting", originated in the 19th century. It, however, did not account for skating on ice temperatures lower than {{convert|−4|C|F K|0}}, which is often skated upon.

A second theory describing the coefficient of friction of ice suggested that ice molecules at the interface cannot properly bond with the molecules of the mass of ice beneath (and thus are free to move like molecules of liquid water). These molecules remain in a semi-liquid state, providing lubrication regardless of pressure against the ice exerted by any object. However, the significance of this hypothesis is disputed by experiments showing a high [[coefficient of friction]] for ice using [[atomic force microscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kenneth |last=Chang |title=Explaining Ice: The Answers Are Slippery |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=21 February 2006 |accessdate=8 April 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/21/science/21ice.html?pagewanted=all |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211055112/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/21/science/21ice.html?pagewanted=all |archivedate=11 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third theory is "friction heating", which suggests that friction of the material is the cause of the ice layer melting. However, this theory does not sufficiently explain why ice is slippery when standing still even at below-zero temperatures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://lptms.u-psud.fr/membres/trizac/Ens/L3FIP/Ice.pdf |title=Why is ice slippery? |first=Robert |last=Rosenberg |journal=[[Physics Today]] |pages=50–54 |date=December 2005 |accessdate=15 February 2009 |doi=10.1063/1.2169444 |bibcode=2005PhT....58l..50R |volume=58 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223210434/http://lptms.u-psud.fr/membres/trizac/Ens/L3FIP/Ice.pdf |archivedate=23 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Applies to the whole paragraph--&gt;

A comprehensive theory of ice friction takes into account all the above-mentioned friction mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Makkonen2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Makkonen|first1=Lasse|last2=Tikanmäki|first2=Maria|title=Modeling the friction of ice|journal=Cold Regions Science and Technology|date=June 2014|volume=102|pages=84–93|doi=10.1016/j.coldregions.2014.03.002|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165232X14000561|accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model allows quantitative estimation of the friction coefficient of ice against various materials as a function of temperature and sliding speed. In typical conditions related to winter sports and tires of a vehicle on ice, melting of a thin ice layer due to the frictional heating is the primary reason for the slipperiness.

Sea ice can be forced together by currents and winds to form [[Pressure ridge (ice)|pressure ridges]] up to {{convert|12|m}} tall. Navigation through areas of sea ice occurs in openings called "[[polynya]]s" or "[[Lead (sea ice)|leads]]" or requires the use of a special ship called an "[[icebreaker]]".

===On land and structures===
[[File:Icy Japanese Maple branch, Boxborough, Massachusetts, 2008.jpg|thumb|Ice on deciduous tree after [[freezing rain]]]]
Ice on land ranges from the largest type called an "[[ice sheet]]" to smaller [[ice cap]]s and [[ice field]]s to glaciers and [[ice stream]]s to the [[snow line]] and [[snow field]]s.

[[Aufeis]] is layered ice that forms in Arctic and subarctic stream valleys. Ice, frozen in the stream bed, blocks normal groundwater discharge, and causes the local water table to rise, resulting in water discharge on top of the frozen layer. This water then freezes, causing the water table to rise further and repeat the cycle. The result is a stratified ice deposit, often several meters thick.

[[Freezing rain]] is a type of winter storm called an [[ice storm]] where rain falls and then freezes producing a [[glaze ice|glaze]] of ice. Ice can also form icicles, similar to [[stalactite]]s in appearance, or [[stalagmite]]-like forms as water drips and re-freezes.

The term "ice dam" has three meanings (others discussed below). On structures, an [[Ice dam (roof)|ice dam]] is the buildup of ice on a sloped roof which stops melt water from draining properly and can cause damage from water leaks in buildings.

===On rivers and streams===
[[File:Frozen rivulet in Pennsylvania.JPG|thumb|A small frozen [[rivulet]]]]
Ice which forms on moving water tends to be less uniform and stable than ice which forms on calm water. [[Ice jam]]s (sometimes called "ice dams"), when broken chunks of ice pile up, are the greatest ice hazard on rivers. Ice jams can cause flooding, damage structures in or near the river, and damage vessels on the river. Ice jams can cause some [[hydropower]] industrial facilities to completely shut down. An ice dam is a blockage from the movement of a glacier which may produce a [[proglacial lake]]. Heavy ice flows in rivers can also damage vessels and require the use of an icebreaker to keep navigation possible.

[[Ice disc]]s are circular formations of ice surrounded by water in a river.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pS4ET4D4iKYC&amp;pg=PP140&amp;dq=Ice+discs+are+circular+formations+of+ice+surrounded+by+water+in+a+river&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwix64K6lLXVAhWoxVQKHSS0AFAQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Ice%20discs%20are%20circular%20formations%20of%20ice%20surrounded%20by%20water%20in%20a%20river&amp;f=false|title=Crop Circles Revealed|last=Moore|first=Judith|last2=Lamb|first2=Barbara|date=2001-10-15|publisher=Light Technology Publishing|isbn=9781622335619|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pancake ice]] is a formation of ice generally created in areas with less calm conditions.

===On lakes{{anchor|Ice_on_lakes}}===
Ice forms on calm water from the shores, a thin layer spreading across the surface, and then downward. Ice on lakes is generally four types: Primary, secondary, superimposed and agglomerate.&lt;ref&gt;Petrenko, Victor F. and Whitworth, Robert W. (1999) ''Physics of ice''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 27–29, {{ISBN|0191581348}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eranti, E. and Lee, George C. (1986) ''Cold region structural engineering''. New York: McGraw-Hill, p. 51, {{ISBN|0070370346}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Primary ice forms first. Secondary ice forms below the primary ice in a direction parallel to the direction of the heat flow. Superimposed ice forms on top of the ice surface from rain or water which seeps up through cracks in the ice which often settles when loaded with snow.

[[Shelf ice]] occurs when floating pieces of ice are driven by the wind piling up on the windward shore.

[[Candle ice]] is a form of [[rotten ice]] that develops in columns perpendicular to the surface of a lake.

===In the air===

[[File:Ice formation on vehicle windshield.JPG|thumb|Ice formation on vehicle windshield]]

====Rime ice====
Rime is a type of ice formed on cold objects when drops of water crystallize on them. This can be observed in [[fog]]gy weather, when the temperature drops during the night. [[Soft rime]] contains a high proportion of trapped air, making it appear white rather than transparent, and giving it a density about one quarter of that of pure ice. [[Hard rime]] is comparatively dense.

====Ice pellets====
{{Main|Ice pellets}}
[[File:Sleet on the ground.jpg|thumb|right|An accumulation of ice pellets]]
[[Ice pellets]] are a form of precipitation consisting of small, [[translucent]] balls of ice. This form of precipitation is also referred to as "sleet" by the United States [[National Weather Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?word=sleet|title=Sleet (glossary entry)|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service|accessdate=20 March 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218030309/http://www.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?word=sleet|archivedate=18 February 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In [[Commonwealth English]] "sleet" refers to [[Rain and snow mixed|a mixture of rain and snow]]). Ice pellets are usually smaller than hailstones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?word=hail|title=Hail (glossary entry)|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service|accessdate=20 March 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127004804/http://www.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?word=hail|archivedate=27 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They often bounce when they hit the ground, and generally do not freeze into a solid mass unless mixed with [[freezing rain]]. The [[METAR]] code for ice pellets is ''PL''.&lt;ref name="METAR"/&gt;

Ice pellets form when a layer of above-freezing air is located between {{convert|1500|and|3000|m|ft}} above the ground, with sub-freezing air both above and below it. This causes the partial or complete melting of any snowflakes falling through the warm layer. As they fall back into the sub-freezing layer closer to the surface, they re-freeze into ice pellets. However, if the sub-freezing layer beneath the warm layer is too small, the precipitation will not have time to re-freeze, and freezing rain will be the result at the surface. A temperature profile showing a warm layer above the ground is most likely to be found in advance of a [[warm front]] during the cold season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Weatherquestions.com|url=http://www.weatherquestions.com/What_causes_ice_pellets.htm|title=What causes ice pellets (sleet)?|accessdate=8 December 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071130071143/http://www.weatherquestions.com/What_causes_ice_pellets.htm|archivedate=30 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but can occasionally be found behind a passing [[cold front]].

====Hail====
{{Main|Hail}}
[[File:Granizo.jpg|right|thumb|A large hailstone, about {{convert|6|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter]]
Like other precipitation, hail forms in storm [[cloud]]s when [[supercooled]] water droplets freeze on contact with [[condensation nuclei]], such as [[dust]] or [[dirt]]. The storm's [[updraft]] blows the hailstones to the upper part of the cloud. The updraft dissipates and the hailstones fall down, back into the updraft, and are lifted up again. Hail has a diameter of {{convert|5|mm|in}} or more.&lt;ref name="gloss"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=hail1|title=Hail|year=2009|accessdate=15 July 2009|author=Glossary of Meteorology|publisher=American Meteorological Society|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725142407/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=hail1|archivedate=25 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within [[METAR]] code, GR is used to indicate larger hail, of a diameter of at least {{convert|6.4|mm|in}} and GS for smaller.&lt;ref name="METAR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alaska.faa.gov/fai/afss/metar+taf/sametara.htm|title=SA-METAR|author=Alaska Air Flight Service Station|publisher=[[Federal Aviation Administration]] via the Internet Wayback Machine|accessdate=29 August 2009|date=10 April 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501074014/http://www.alaska.faa.gov/fai/afss/metar%20taf/sametara.htm|archivedate=1 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stones just larger than [[golf#Golf balls|golf ball]]-sized are one of the most frequently reported hail sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/publications/jewell/hailslsc.pdf|title=P9.5 Evaluation of an Alberta Hail Growth Model Using Severe Hail Proximity Soundings in the United States|author1=Jewell, Ryan|author2=Brimelow, Julian|date=17 August 2004|accessdate=15 July 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507044027/http://www.spc.noaa.gov/publications/jewell/hailslsc.pdf|archivedate=7 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hailstones can grow to {{convert|15|cm|in|0}} and weigh more than {{convert|0.5|kg|lb|1}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photolib.noaa.gov/htmls/nssl0001.htm|title=Aggregate hailstone|author=National Severe Storms Laboratory|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=23 April 2007|accessdate=15 July 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810182627/http://www.photolib.noaa.gov/htmls/nssl0001.htm|archivedate=10 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In large hailstones, [[latent heat]] released by further freezing may melt the outer shell of the hailstone.

Accordingly, hail is actually less common in the tropics despite a much higher frequency of thunderstorms than in the mid-latitudes because the [[atmosphere]] over the tropics tends to be warmer over a much greater depth. Hail in the tropics occurs mainly at higher elevations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UbtG3vFfNtoC&amp;pg=PA41|title=Climate, change and risk|author1=Downing, Thomas E. |author2=Olsthoorn, Alexander A. |author3=Tol, Richard S.

====Snow====
{{Main|Snowflake}}
[[File:SnowflakesWilsonBentley.jpg|thumb|[[Snowflake]]s by [[Wilson Bentley]], 1902.]]
Snow crystals form when tiny [[supercool]]ed cloud droplets (about 10 [[μm]] in diameter) [[freezing|freeze]]. These droplets are able to remain liquid at temperatures lower than {{convert|-18|C|K F}}, because to freeze, a few molecules in the droplet need to get together by chance to form an arrangement similar to that in an ice lattice; then the droplet freezes around this "nucleus." Experiments show that this "homogeneous" nucleation of cloud droplets only occurs at temperatures lower than {{convert|-35|C|K F}}.&lt;ref name=Mason&gt;{{cite book|author = Mason, Basil John| publisher= Clarendon Press| isbn= 0-19-851603-7|year = 1971|title = Physics of Clouds}}&lt;/ref&gt; In warmer clouds an aerosol particle or "ice nucleus" must be present in (or in contact with) the droplet to act as a nucleus.

====Diamond dust====

{{Main|Diamond dust}}
So-called "diamond dust", also known as ice needles or ice crystals, forms at temperatures approaching {{convert|-40|C|F}} due to air with slightly higher moisture from aloft mixing with colder, surface-based air.&lt;ref name="glossdia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=diamond+dust&amp;submit=Search|title=Diamond Dust|author=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000|publisher=American Meteorological Society|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403084329/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=diamond+dust&amp;submit=Search|archivedate=3 April 2009|deadurl=yes|accessdate=21 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The METAR identifier for diamond dust within international hourly weather reports is ''IC''.&lt;ref name="METAR" /&gt;

==Ablation==
{{main|Ablation}}
Ablation of ice refers to both its [[melting]] and its [[dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]].

In fresh ambient melting describes a [[phase transition]] from solid to liquid.

To melt ice means breaking the [[hydrogen bonds]] between the water molecules. The ordering of the molecules in the solid breaks down to a less ordered state and the solid melts to become a liquid. This is achieved by increasing the internal energy of the ice beyond the [[melting point]]. When ice melts it absorbs as much energy as would be required to heat an equivalent amount of water by 80&amp;nbsp;°C. While melting, the temperature of the ice surface remains constant at 0&amp;nbsp;°C. The velocity of the melting process depends on the efficiency of the energy exchange process. An ice surface in [[fresh water]] melts solely by [[free convection]] with a velocity that depends linearly on the water temperature, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;, when ''T''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; is less than 3.98&amp;nbsp;°C, and superlinearly when ''T''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to or greater than 3.98&amp;nbsp;°C, with the rate being proportional to (T&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;3.98&amp;nbsp;°C)&lt;sup&gt;''α''&lt;/sup&gt;, with ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|5|3}} for ''T''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; much greater than 8&amp;nbsp;°C, and α&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|4|3}} for inbetween temperatures ''T''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keitzl|first1=Thomas|last2=Mellado|first2=Juan Pedro|last3=Notz|first3=Dirk|title=Impact of Thermally Driven Turbulence on the Bottom Melting of Ice|journal=J. Phys. Oceanogr.|volume=46 |issue=4|pages=1171–1187|doi=10.1175/JPO-D-15-0126.1|accessdate=|year=2016|bibcode=2016JPO....46.1171K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In salty ambient conditions, dissolution rather than melting often causes the ablation of ice. For example, the temperature of the [[Arctic Ocean]] is generally below the melting point of ablating sea ice. The phase transition from solid to liquid is achieved by mixing [[salt]] and water molecules, similar to the dissolution of [[sugar]] in water, even though the water temperature is far below the melting point of the sugar. Hence dissolution is rate limited by salt transport whereas melting can occur at much higher rates that are characteristic for [[heat transport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woods|first1=Andrew W.|title=Melting and dissolving|journal=J. Fluid Mech.|volume=239|pages=429–448|doi=10.1017/S0022112092004476|accessdate=|year=1992|bibcode=1992JFM...239..429W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in human activities==
Humans have used ice for cooling and food preservation for centuries, relying on harvesting natural ice in various forms and then transitioning to the mechanical production of the material. Ice also presents a challenge to transportation in various forms and a setting for winter sports.

===Cooling===
Ice has long been valued as a means of cooling. In 400 BC Iran, [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] engineers had already mastered the technique of storing ice in the middle of summer in the desert. The ice was brought in during the winters from nearby mountains in bulk amounts, and stored in specially designed, naturally cooled ''refrigerators'', called [[yakhchal]] (meaning ''ice storage''). This was a large underground space (up to 5000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) that had thick walls (at least two meters at the base) made of a special mortar called ''[[sarooj]]'', composed of sand, clay, egg whites, lime, goat hair, and ash in specific proportions, and which was known to be resistant to heat transfer. This mixture was thought to be completely water impenetrable. The space often had access to a [[qanat]], and often contained a system of [[windcatcher]]s which could easily bring temperatures inside the space down to frigid levels on summer days. The ice was used to chill treats for royalty.

====Harvesting====
{{Main|Ice cutting}}
[[File:Ice Harvesting on Lake St Clair Michigan circa 1905--photograph courtesy Detroit Publishing Company.jpg|thumb|Harvesting ice on [[Lake St. Clair]] in [[Michigan]], c. 1905]]
There were thriving industries in 16th/17th century England whereby low-lying areas along the [[Thames Estuary]] were flooded during the winter, and ice harvested in carts and stored inter-seasonally in insulated wooden houses as a provision to an icehouse often located in large country houses, and widely used to keep fish fresh when caught in distant waters. This was allegedly copied by an Englishman who had seen the same activity in China. Ice was imported into England from Norway on a considerable scale as early as 1823.&lt;ref name=cne&gt;{{Cite Collier's|wstitle=Ice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the first cargo of ice was sent from New York City to [[Charleston, South Carolina]] in 1799,&lt;ref name=cne/&gt; and by the first half of the 19th century, ice harvesting had become big business. [[Frederic Tudor]], who became known as the "Ice King", worked on developing better insulation products for the long distance shipment of ice, especially to the tropics; this became known as the [[ice trade]].

[[Trieste]] sent ice to [[Egypt]], [[Corfu]], and [[Zante]]; Switzerland sent it to France; and Germany sometimes was supplied from [[Bavaria]]n lakes.&lt;ref name=cne/&gt; The [[Hungarian Parliament]] building used ice harvested in the winter from [[Lake Balaton]] for air conditioning.

[[Ice house (building)|Ice house]]s were used to store ice formed in the winter, to make ice available all year long, and early [[refrigerator]]s were known as [[icebox]]es, because they had a block of ice in them. In many cities, it was not unusual to have a regular ice [[Delivery (commerce)|delivery]] service during the summer. The advent of artificial refrigeration technology has since made delivery of ice obsolete.

Ice is still harvested for [[List of ice and snow sculpture events|ice and snow sculpture events]]. For example, a [[swing saw]] is used to get ice for the [[Harbin International Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival]] each year from the frozen surface of the [[Songhua River]].&lt;ref name="coldestcity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/travel/ice-is-money-in-chinas-coldest-city-20081113-62yj.html|title=Ice is money in China's coldest city|date=13 November 2008|publisher=AFP via The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=26 December 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002152548/http://www.smh.com.au/travel/ice-is-money-in-chinas-coldest-city-20081113-62yj.html|archivedate=2 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stand-alone icemaker units that make ice cubes are often called ice machines.

===Transportation===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
Ice can present challenges to safe transportation on land, sea and in the air.

====Land travel====
[[File:Södertäljevägen vinter 2013a 01.jpg|thumb|Road ice decreases tire traction, thereby affecting driving safety.]]
Ice forming on [[road]]s is a dangerous winter hazard. [[Black ice]] is very difficult to see, because it lacks the expected frosty surface. Whenever there is freezing rain or snow which occurs at a temperature near the melting point, it is common for ice to build up on the [[window]]s of vehicles. Driving safely requires the removal of the ice build-up. [[Ice scraper]]s are tools designed to break the ice free and clear the windows, though removing the ice can be a long and laborious process.

Far enough below the freezing point, a thin layer of ice crystals can form on the inside surface of windows. This usually happens when a vehicle has been left alone after being driven for a while, but can happen while driving, if the outside temperature is low enough. Moisture from the driver's breath is the source of water for the crystals. It is troublesome to remove this form of ice, so people often open their windows slightly when the vehicle is parked in order to let the moisture dissipate, and it is now common for cars to have rear-window [[defroster]]s to solve the problem. A similar problem can happen in homes, which is one reason why many colder regions require [[Insulated glazing|double-pane windows]] for insulation.

When the outdoor temperature stays below freezing for extended periods, very thick layers of ice can form on [[lake]]s and other bodies of water, although places with flowing water require much colder temperatures. The ice can become thick enough to drive onto with [[automobile]]s and [[truck]]s. Doing this safely requires a thickness of at least 30&amp;nbsp;cm (one foot).

====Water-borne travel====
[[File:Frozen Lake Huron- icebreakers and commercial vessels.jpg|thumb|Channel through ice for ship traffic on [[Lake Huron]] with [[ice breaker]]s in background]]
For ships, ice presents two distinct hazards. Spray and freezing rain can produce an ice build-up on the superstructure of a vessel sufficient to make it unstable, and to require it to be hacked off or melted with steam hoses. And icebergs&amp;nbsp;– large masses of ice floating in water (typically created when [[glacier]]s reach the sea)&amp;nbsp;– can be dangerous if struck by a ship when underway. Icebergs have been responsible for the sinking of many ships, the most famous being the [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']]. For [[harbor]]s near the [[geographical pole|pole]]s, being ice-free is an important advantage. Ideally, all year long. Examples are [[Murmansk]] (Russia), [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]] (Russia, formerly Finland) and [[Vardø (town)|Vardø]] (Norway). Harbors which are not ice-free are opened up using [[icebreaker]]s.

====Air travel====
[[File:Some Ice on the boots (1527659244).jpg|thumb|Rime ice on the leading edge of an aircraft wing, partially released by the [[Ice protection system|black pneumatic boot]].]]
For aircraft, ice can cause a number of dangers. As an aircraft climbs, it passes through air layers of different temperature and humidity, some of which may be conducive to ice formation. If ice forms on the wings or control surfaces, this may adversely affect the flying qualities of the aircraft. During the [[Transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown|first non-stop flight across the Atlantic]], the British aviators Captain [[John Alcock (RAF officer)|John Alcock]] and Lieutenant [[Arthur Whitten Brown]] encountered such icing conditions&amp;nbsp;– Brown left the cockpit and climbed onto the wing several times to remove ice which was covering the engine air intakes of the [[Vickers Vimy]] aircraft they were flying.

One vulnerability effected by icing that is associated with reciprocating internal combustion engines is the [[carburetor]]. As air is sucked through the carburetor into the engine, the local air pressure is lowered, which causes [[adiabatic]] cooling. Thus, in humid near-freezing conditions, the carburetor will be colder, and tend to ice up. This will block the supply of air to the engine, and cause it to fail. For this reason, aircraft reciprocating engines with carburetors are provided with [[Carburetor heat|carburetor air intake heaters]]. The increasing use of [[fuel injection]]—which does not require carburetors—has made "carb icing" less of an issue for reciprocating engines.

Jet engines do not experience carb icing, but recent evidence indicates that they can be slowed, stopped, or damaged by internal icing in certain types of atmospheric conditions much more easily than previously believed. In most cases, the engines can be quickly restarted and flights are not endangered, but research continues to determine the exact conditions which produce this type of icing, and find the best methods to prevent, or reverse it, in flight.

===Recreation and sports===
{{Main|Ice sports}}
[[File:SCENEONICE.jpg|thumb|''Skating fun'' by 17th century Dutch painter [[Hendrick Avercamp]]]]

Ice also plays a central role in winter recreation and in many sports such as [[ice skating]], [[tour skating]], [[ice hockey]], [[bandy]], [[ice fishing]], [[ice climbing]], [[curling]], [[broomball]] and sled racing on [[bobsled]], [[luge]] and [[Skeleton (sport)|skeleton]]. Many of the different sports played on ice get international attention every four years during the [[Winter Olympic Games]].

A sort of sailboat on blades gives rise to [[ice yachting]]. Another sport is [[ice racing]], where drivers must speed on lake ice, while also controlling the skid of their vehicle (similar in some ways to [[dirt track racing]]). The sport has even been modified for [[ice rink]]s.

===Other uses===
*[[Ice cube|Ice cubes]] or [[crushed ice]] can be used to cool drinks. As the ice melts, it absorbs heat and keeps the drink near {{convert|0|C}}.
* Ice can be used to reduce swelling (by decreasing blood flow) and pain by pressing it against an area of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The U.S. Navy Seal Guide to Fitness and Nutrition | first1=Patricia A. | last1=Deuster | first2=Anita | last2=Singh | first3=Pierre A. | last3=Pelletier | publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc. | year=2007 | isbn=1-60239-030-4 | page=117 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3P038jE18BwC&amp;pg=PT117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:USNS Southern Cross at the ice pier in 1983.jpg|thumb|Ice pier during 1983 cargo operations. [[McMurdo Station]], Antarctica]]
* Engineers used the substantial strength of pack ice when they constructed Antarctica's first floating [[ice pier]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/pastIssues/2005-2006/2006_01_08.pdf#page=3 "Unique ice pier provides harbor for ships,"] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110223145229/http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/pastIssues/2005-2006/2006_01_08.pdf |date=23 February 2011 }} Antarctic Sun. 8 January 2006; McMurdo Station, Antarctica.&lt;/ref&gt; Such ice piers are used during cargo operations to load and offload ships. Fleet operations personnel make the floating pier during the winter. They build upon naturally occurring frozen seawater in [[McMurdo Sound]] until the dock reaches a depth of about {{convert|22|ft|m}}. Ice piers have a lifespan of three to five years.
* Structures and ice sculptures are built out of large chunks of ice or by spraying water&lt;ref name="Makkonen, L. 1994"&gt;Makkonen, L. (1994) "Ice and Construction". E &amp; FN Spon, London. {{ISBN|0-203-62726-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The structures are mostly ornamental (as in the case with [[Ice palace|ice castle]]s), and not practical for long-term habitation. [[Ice hotel]]s exist on a seasonal basis in a few cold areas. [[Igloo]]s are another example of a temporary structure, made primarily from snow.
* In cold climates, roads are regularly prepared on iced-over lakes and archipelago areas. Temporarily, even a railroad has been built on ice.&lt;ref name="Makkonen, L. 1994"/&gt;
* During World War II, [[Project Habbakuk]] was an Allied programme which investigated the use of [[pykrete]] (wood fibers mixed with ice) as a possible material for warships, especially aircraft carriers, due to the ease with which a vessel immune to torpedoes, and a large deck, could be constructed by ice. A small-scale prototype was built,&lt;ref&gt;Gold, L.W. (1993). "The Canadian Habbakuk Project: a Project of the National Research Council of Canada". International Glaciological Society. {{ISBN|0946417164}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but the need for such a vessel in the war was removed prior to building it in full-scale.
* Ice has even been used as the material for a variety of musical instruments, for example by percussionist [[Terje Isungset]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/cj63 | title=Terje Isungset Iceman Is Review | publisher=BBC Music | author=Talkington, Fiona | date=3 May 2005 | accessdate=24 May 2011 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924045635/http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/cj63 | archivedate=24 September 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ice is used to cool and preserve food in [[icebox]]es.
* Ice can be used as part of an [[Ice storage air conditioning|air conditioning system]], using battery- or [[solar power|solar-powered]] fans to blow hot air over the ice. This is especially useful during [[heat wave]]s when power is out and standard (electrically powered) air conditioners do not work.

=="Ice" of other materials==
{{main|Volatiles}}
The solid phases of several other volatile substances are also referred to as ''ices''; generally a volatile is classed as an ice if its melting point lies above or around 100 K. The best known example is [[dry ice]], the solid form of [[carbon dioxide]].

A "magnetic analogue" of ice is also realized in some insulating magnetic materials in which the magnetic moments mimic the position of protons in water ice and obey energetic constraints similar to the Bernal-Fowler [[ice rules]] arising from the [[geometrical frustration]] of the proton configuration in water ice. These materials are called [[spin ice]].

'''Impurities''' are [[chemical substance]]s inside a confined amount of [[liquid]], [[gas]], or [[solid]], which differ from the [[chemical composition]] of the material or compound.

Impurities are either naturally occurring or added during [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] of a chemical or commercial product. During production, impurities may be purposely, accidentally, inevitably, or incidentally added into the substance.

The levels of impurities in a material are generally defined in relative terms.  [[standardization|Standards]] have been established by various organizations that attempt to define the permitted levels of various impurities in a manufactured product.  Strictly speaking, then a material's level of purity can only be stated as being more or less pure than some other material.

==Destructive impurities== 

Impurities can be destructive when they obstruct the working nature of the material. Examples include [[wiktionary:ash|ash]] and [[debris]] in [[metals]] and leaf pieces in blank white papers. The removal of impurities is usually done chemically. For example, in the manufacturing of [[iron]], calcium carbonate is added to the [[blast furnace]] to remove [[silicon dioxide]] from the [[iron ore]]. [[Zone refining]] is an economically important method for the purification of semiconductors.

However, some kinds of impurities can be removed by physical means. A mixture of water and [[salt]] can be separated by [[distillation]], with water as the distillate and salt as the solid [[residue (chemistry)|residue]]. Impurities are usually physically removed from liquids and gases. Removal of sand particles from metal ore is one example with solids.

No matter what method is used, it is usually impossible to separate an impurity completely from a material. The reason that it is impossible to remove impurities completely is of thermodynamic nature and is predicted by the second law of thermodynamics. Removing impurities completely means reducing the [[entropy]] of the system to zero. This would require an infinite amount of work and energy as predicted by the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. What technicians can do is to increase the purity of a material to as near 100% as possible or economically feasible.

==Impurities and nucleation==
When an impure liquid is cooled to its [[melting point]] the liquid, undergoing a [[phase transition]], [[crystal]]lizes around the impurities and becomes a crystalline solid. If there are no impurities then the liquid is said to be pure and can be [[supercooled]] below its melting point without becoming a solid. This occurs because the liquid has nothing to condense around so the solid cannot form a natural crystalline solid. The solid is eventually formed when [[dynamic arrest]] or [[glass transition]] occurs, but it forms into an [[amorphous solid]]&amp;nbsp;– a [[glass]], instead, as there is no [[long-range order]] in the structure.

Impurities play an important role in the nucleation of other phase transitions.   For example, the presence of foreign elements may have important effects on the mechanical and magnetic properties of metal alloys.  Iron atoms in copper cause the renowned [[Kondo effect]] where the conduction electron spins form a magnetic bound state with the impurity atom.    Magnetic impurities in [[superconductors]] can serve as generation sites for [[vortex]] defects.   Point defects can nucleate reversed domains in [[ferromagnet]]s and dramatically affect their [[coercivity]].  In general impurities are able to serve as initiation points for [[phase transition]]s because the energetic cost of creating a finite-size [[Domain wall (magnetism)|domain]] of a new phase is lower at a point defect. In order for the nucleus of a new phase to be stable, it must reach a critical size. This threshold size is often lower at an impurity site.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10502">The '''International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT)''' is an [[intergovernmental organization]] responsible for the management and conservation of tuna and tuna-like species in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and adjacent seas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICCAT|url=https://www.iccat.int/en/|website=The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was established in 1969, at a conference in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], and operates in [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The organisation has been strongly criticised by scientists for its repeated failure to conserve the [[sustainability]] of the tuna [[fishery]] by consistently supporting over-fishing – an internal review branded ICCAT's policies on the eastern Atlantic bluefin tuna fishery a "travesty of fisheries management", and an "international disgrace".&lt;ref name="ngo.grida"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ngo.grida.no/wwfneap/Publication/Submissions/OSPAR2008/WWF_MASH08_BFT_Annex3.pdf|title=Why are urgent, radical measures necessary to ensure the survival of Mediterranean and East Atlantic bluefin tuna?|author=WWF|date=2009-10-29|accessdate=2009-11-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605183020/http://www.ngo.grida.no/wwfneap/Publication/Submissions/OSPAR2008/WWF_MASH08_BFT_Annex3.pdf|archivedate=2011-06-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Conservation movement|Conservationists]] often refer to ICCAT as "The International Conspiracy to Catch All Tuna".&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;''BBC news'', [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7040011.stm Last rites for a marine marvel?]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in recent years the organization seems to be turning around. For the most iconic species within its management, the Eastern Bluefin Tuna, a very strict recovery plan was adopted. It is too early to judge its final outcome, but initial indications are encouraging. In general, ICCAT contracting parties seem to have agreed to steer the organization into a direction of relying on sound science, insisting on compliance and following a good governance model.

==Species under management==
Tuna and tuna-like fishes are highly [[Fish migration|migratory]], and [[Fish stock|stocks]] cross numerous [[territorial waters|international boundaries]]. ICCAT is involved in management of 30 species, including the [[Bluefin tuna|Atlantic bluefin]] (''Thunnus thynnus thynnus''), [[yellowfin tuna|yellowfin]] (''T. albacares''), [[albacore]] (''T. alalunga'') and [[bigeye tuna]] (''T. obesus''); from the billfishes, [[swordfish]] (''Xiphias gladius''), [[white marlin]] (''Tetrapturus albidus''), [[Atlantic blue marlin|blue marlin]] (''Makaira nigricans''), [[sailfish]] (''Istiophorus albicans''); mackerels such as spotted [[Spanish mackerel]] (''Scomberomorus maculatus'') and [[king mackerel]] (''S. cavalla''); and, small tunas like [[skipjack tuna]] (''Katsuwonus pelamis'').

==Work carried out by the ICCAT==
Scientists participating in ICCAT carry out studies on [[biometry]], [[ecology|fisheries ecology]], and [[oceanography]], focusing on the effects of fishing on tuna stock abundance. They also collect and analyse fisheries statistics which are relative to conditions the management of resources. ICCAT is also involved in work on data for other fish species that are caught during tuna fishing ("[[bycatch]]" - principally sharks) in the Atlantic and surrounding area, and which are not investigated by another international fishery organization.

Based on scientific and other information, such as fishery statistics and stock assessments provided by members, each year the Commission decides on conservation and management measures aimed at maintaining target stocks at levels that permit the maximum sustainable catch for food and other purposes.

==Criticism==
ICCAT is widely criticised by environmental bodies for having short-term policies that favour fisherman over the long-term conservation of the species. &lt;ref&gt; Clover, Charles. 2004. [[The End of the Line: How Overfishing Is Changing the World and What We Eat]]. Ebury Press, London. {{ISBN|0-09-189780-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/may/11/fishing.food|title=How the world's oceans are running out of fish|first=Alex|last=Renton|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|date=2008-05-11|accessdate=2008-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, ICCAT ignored the advice of their scientists that quotas should not exceed 15,000 tonnes per year – which had been determined as the maximum sustainable yield – and instead set quotas at 22,000 tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7746965.stm|title=EU condemned on tuna 'mockery'|first=Richard|last=Black| publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=2009-10-29|accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; An independent review of ICCAT, commissioned by the organisation themselves, concluded that their policies on the eastern Atlantic bluefin tuna fishery are a "travesty of fisheries management", and an "international disgrace".&lt;ref name="ngo.grida" /&gt; Dr Sergi Tudela, head of [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] Mediterranean's fisheries programme, said "Today's outcome is a recipe for economic as well as biological bankruptcy with the European Union squarely to blame. ICCAT's string of successive failures leaves us little option now but to seek effective remedies through trade measures and extending the boycott of retailers, restaurants, chefs and consumers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.panda.org/who_we_are/wwf_offices/poland/?151021/Tuna-commission-comes-up-with-quota-disgrace-not-a-decisionquot|last=WWF|title=Tuna commission comes up with "a disgrace, not a decision"|publisher=[[World Wide Fund for Nature]]|date=2008-11-24|accessdate=2009-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, ICCAT's scientific advisors announced that a total ban on international trade in Atlantic tuna was justified, based on the decline in the tuna fishery population to less than 15% of its original size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8331113.stm|title=Tuna ban "justified" by science|first=Richard|last=Black| publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=2009-10-29|accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later in the same month, ICCAT recommended catch quotas of 13,500 tonnes per year.  This was met by sharp criticisms from environmental organisations, and prompted calls for alternative methods to regulate Atlantic tuna fisheries, such as protection under [[CITES]]. Susan Lieberman, Director of International Policy for the [[Pew Environment Group]] said &lt;blockquote&gt;Since its inception, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas has been driven by short-term commercial fishing interests, not the conservation ethic implied by its name....ICCAT's actions and inactions highlight the need to take these issues to CITES—the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. The ICCAT fisheries managers have shown scant interest in the long-term preservation of the key resources they are supposed to manage. It is now time to turn to other bodies to seek the needed protections that ICCAT has failed to provide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2009/1115-hance_iccat.html|title=ICCAT fails to protect Atlantic Tuna - again|first=Jeremy|last=Hance|date=2009-11-15|accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The US [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) released a statement with strongly worded criticism, saying that the new agreement was "a marked improvement over the current rules, but it is insufficient to guarantee the long-term viability of either the fish or the fishery".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2009/20091116_iccat.html|title=NOAA Issues Statement on ICCAT Annual Meeting|author=NOAA|date=2009-11-16|accessdate=2009-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent Developments==
In recent years ICCAT adopted a draconic recovery plan for Eastern Bluefin Tuna, which led to the reduction of the total allowable catches from 27,500 in 2007 to 13,400 tons in 2014.

Apart from reduced total allowable catches, the recovery plan also introduced strict monitoring, reporting and control measures Over the years the plan seemed to produce results and recently earlier critics have welcome the plan and the action undertaken by ICCAT.

In November 2012 Susan Lieberman, international policy director of Pew Environment Group stated that "It is encouraging that ICCAT listened to the recommendations of its own scientists and agreed to keep catch limits for bluefin tuna within their advice. This decision will give this depleted species a fighting chance to continue on the path to recovery after decades of overfishing and mismanagement".
&lt;ref name="pew"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/about/news-room/press-releases/2012/11/19/iccat-follows-scientific-advice-on-atlantic-bluefin-tuna-makes-some-progress-on-sharks-efforts-to-combat-illegal-fishing|title=ICCAT follows scientific advice on atlantic bluefin tuna|author=Pew Environment Group|date=2012-11-19|accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013 Dr Sergi Tudela, Head of Fisheries at WWF Mediterranean said: “WWF congratulates ICCAT member countries for sticking to science again this year regarding bluefin tuna quotas in the East Atlantic and Mediterranean. This is a good sign for the credibility of ICCAT. However, failure to address countries’ failure to comply with rules remains an issue of grave concern”.

The '''''International Journal of Speleology'''''  is since 1978 the official [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]] of the ''Union Internationale de Spéléologie''. Since 1981 it has been published by the [[Società Speleologica Italiana]].

The ''International Journal of Speleology'' is divided into four sections: Botany-Microbiology, Zoology, Geology-Geomorphology, and Abstract-News. The first issue was edited by G. Claus (US), subsequently two other editors were added: R. Husson (France) and G Nicholas (USA). The first two volumes were published by the J. Kramer Verlag ([[Germany]]), followed by Swets &amp; Zeitlinger N.V. (The [[Netherlands]]).

In 1972 R. Husson became [[editor in chief]] and nine volumes were issued in the period 1964 to 1977 until the cost of printing requested a radical change. In 1978 the journal became the official journal of the [[Union Internationale de Spéléologie]] and it was published in [[Italy]] where the cost of printing was lower.

In 1981 V. Sbordoni (Italy) became editor in chief. In the meantime the Società Speleologica Italiana acquired the property of the journal which was printed with a contribution of the Italian Ministry for Culture and Environment, the [[Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche]], and the [[University of Trieste]].

In the second half of the 1990s the Museo di Speleologia "V. Rivera" also contributed to the financial support of the journal. The issues of the journal were alternatively dedicated to biospeleology and physical speleology until 1998 when the journal was split into two different series: "A" for Biospeleology (which ceased publication in 2003) and "B" for Physical Speleology.

In addition to the regular issues of the journal, in 1996 a "Manual for Karst water analysis" by W.E. Krawczyk was printed.

== Etymology ==

The Sanskrit word "''Manasarovar''" (मानसरोवर) is a combination of two Sanskrit words; "''Mánas''" (मानस) meaning "''mind (in its widest sense as applied to all the mental powers), intellect, intelligence, understanding, perception, sense, conscience''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://faculty.washington.edu/prem/mw/m.html |title= Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary |last= Williams |first= Monier |website= faculty.washington.edu |quote= mánas n. mind (in its widest sense as applied to all the mental powers), intellect, intelligence, understanding, perception, sense, conscience, will RV. &amp;c. &amp;c.

== Geography ==
[[File:Mansarovar map.jpg|thumb|Map of the region]]
Lake Manasarovar lies at {{convert|4,590|m|abbr=on}} above mean sea level, a relatively high elevation for a large freshwater lake on the mostly saline lake-studded [[Tibetan Plateau]].

Lake Manasa sarovar is relatively round in shape with the circumference of {{convert|88|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}. Its depth reaches a maximum depth of {{convert|90|m|ft|abbr=on}}{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} and its surface area is {{convert|320|km2|1|abbr=on}}. It is connected to nearby [[Lake Rakshastal]] by the natural [[Ganga Chhu]] channel. Lake Manasarovar is near the source of the [[Sutlej]], which is the easternmost large tributary of the [[Indus River|Sindhu]]. Nearby are the sources of the [[Brahmaputra River]], the [[Indus River]], and the [[Ghaghara]], an important tributary of the [[Ganges]].

Lake Manasarovar overflows into Lake Rakshastal which is a salt-water [[endorheic basin|endorheic lake]]. These lakes used to be part of the Sutlej basin and were separated due to tectonic activity.

=== In Hinduism ===
According to [[Hinduism]], the lake was first created in the mind of the Lord Brahma after which it manifested on Earth.&lt;ref name="Charles Allen 1999 p. 10"&gt;Charles Allen. (1999). ''The Search for [[Shangri-la]]: A Journey into Tibetan History'', p. 10. Little, Brown and Company. Reprint: Abacus, London. 2000. {{ISBN|0-349-11142-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Hinduism, Lake Manasarovar is a personification of purity, and one who drinks water from the lake will go to the abode of [[Shiva]] after death. He is believed to be cleansed of all his sins committed over even a hundred lifetimes.&lt;ref name="In Search of Myths &amp; Heroes" /&gt;

Like [[Mount Kailash]], Lake Manasarovar is a place of pilgrimage, attracting religious people from [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Tibet]] and neighboring countries. Bathing in Manasarovar and drinking its water is believed by Hindus to cleanse all sins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kailash-yatra.org/about-mansarovar-lake.html#main_articles_sec|title=About Holy Manasarovar Lake – Kailash Yatra|last=Kailash Yatra|website=www.kailash-yatra.org|access-date=2016-04-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502155525/http://www.kailash-yatra.org/about-mansarovar-lake.html#main_articles_sec|archivedate=2016-05-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pilgrimage]] tours are organized regularly, especially from India, the most famous of which is the yearly "Kailash Manas Sarovar Yatra". Pilgrims come to take ceremonial baths in the waters of the lake.

Lake Manasarovar has long been viewed by the pilgrims as being nearby to the sources of four great rivers of Asia, namely the [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra,]] [[Ghaghara]], Sindhu and [[Sutlej]], thus it is an axial point which has been thronged to by pilgrims for thousands of years. The region was closed to pilgrims from the outside following the [[Battle of Chamdo]]; no foreigners were allowed between 1951 and 1980. After the 1980s it has again become a part of the Indian pilgrim trail.&lt;ref name="In Search of Myths &amp; Heroes"&gt;In Search of Myths &amp; Heroes By Michael Wood&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Hinduism, the lake was first created in the mind of [[Brahma]] after which it manifested on Earth.&lt;ref name="Charles Allen 1999 p. 10" /&gt; Hence it is called "Manasa sarovaram", which is a combination of the [[Sanskrit]] words for "mind" and "lake". The lake is also supposed to be the summer abode of the [[Hamsa (bird)|hamsa]]. Considered to be sacred, the hamsa is an important element in the symbology of the subcontinent, representing wisdom and beauty.&lt;ref&gt;Eckard Schleberger, Die Indische Götterwelt.'' Eugen Diederich Verlag. 1997 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hindu theology, there are five sacred lakes; collectively called ''Panch-Sarovar''; Mansarovar, [[Siddhpur|Bindu Sarovar]], [[Narayan Sarovar]], [[Pampa Sarovar]] and [[Pushkar Lake|Pushkar Sarovar]].&lt;ref name=w /&gt; They are also mentioned in [[Shrimad Bhagavata Purana]].&lt;ref name=b&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://kutchguide.blogspot.com/2011/03/narayan-sarovar-temple-in-kutch-city.html |title=Narayan Sarovar Temple in Kutch ~ KACHCHH GUIDE |publisher=Kutchguide.blogspot.com |date=2010-12-19 |accessdate=2015-07-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723073313/http://kutchguide.blogspot.com/2011/03/narayan-sarovar-temple-in-kutch-city.html |archivedate=2015-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gujaratguideonline.com/Kutch-Places.html |title=Kutch Visiting Places and Tourist Attraction : Kutch Guide – Gujarat |publisher=Gujaratguideonline.com |accessdate=2015-07-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924024153/http://www.gujaratguideonline.com/Kutch-Places.html |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="w"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nxtnsT8CdZ4C&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=narayan+sarovar&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jZa1TbzPDsrKrAe0j-3IDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=narayan%20sarovar&amp;f=false] Encyclopaedia of tourism resources in India, Volume 2 By Manohar Sajnani&lt;/ref&gt;

The People belong to this region is called [[Manasarovar]]iya.Most of Them follow Hindu Religion are belong to [[Koli people|Koli]] tribe called [[Manasarovar|Manasarovariya Patel]] or [[Mandhatri|Mandhata Patel]] claimed  that  their tribe belong to ancient King [[Mandhatri|Mandhata]] of [[Ikshvaku dynasty|suryavansha of Ikshvaku dynasty]] and There is mountain named after his name called [[Gurla Mandhata]] is the highest peak of the [[Nalakankar Himal]] for glorify his achievement.

=== In the Bon religion ===
The [[Bon]] religion is also associated with the holy place of [[Zhang Zhung Meri]] sacred deity. When [[Tonpa Shenrab Miwoche|Tonpa Shenrab]], the founder of the Bon religion, visited Tibet for the first time – from [[Tagzig Olmo Lung Ring|Tagzig Wolmo Lungring]] – he washed in the lake.

=== In Buddhism ===
[[Buddhism|Buddhists]] associate the lake with the legendary lake [[Anavatapta]] ([[Sanskrit]]; [[Pali]] ''Anotatta'') where [[Maya (mother of the Buddha)|Maya]] is believed to have conceived [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. The lake has a few [[vihara|monasteries]] on its shores, the most notable of which is the ancient [[Chiu Monastery]] built on a steep hill, looking as if it has been carved right out of the rock.

The lake is very popular in Buddhist literature and associated with many teachings and stories. Buddha, it is reported, stayed and meditated near this lake on several occasions. Lake Manasarovar is also the subject of the meditative Tibetan tradition, "The Jewel of Tibet". A modern narration and description of the meditation was made popular by [[Robert Thurman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soundstrue.com/shop/420.productdetails?couponCode=NOVAA The Jewel Tree of Tibet – Robert Thurman]. Soundstrue.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Jainism ===

In [[Jainism]], Lake Manasarovar is associated with the first [[Tirthankara]], [[Rishabha]]. As per Jain scriptures, the first Tirthankar, Bhagwan Rushabhdev, had attained [[nirvana]] on the Ashtapad Mountain. The son of Bhagwan Rishabhdev, [[Bharata Chakravartin|Chakravati Bharat]], had built a palace adorned with gems on the Ashtapad Mountain located in the serene [[Himalayas]].There are many stories related to Ashtapad Maha Tirth like Kumar and Sagar's sons, Tapas Kher Parna, Ravan and Mandodri Bhakti, among many others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4458">The '''Leaf Angle Distribution''' (or LAD) of a plant canopy refers to the mathematical description of the angular [[Orientation (geometry)|orientation]] of the [[Leaf|leaves]] in the [[vegetation]]. Specifically, if each leaf is conceptually represented by a small flat plate, its orientation can be described with the [[zenith]] and the [[azimuth]] angles of the [[surface normal]] to that plate. If the leaf has a complex structure and is not flat, it may be necessary to approximate the actual leaf by a set of small plates, in which case there may be a number of leaf normals and associated angles. The LAD describes the statistical distribution of these angles.

==Examples of Leaf Angle Distributions==

Different plant canopies exhibit different LADs: For instance, grasses and willows have their leaves largely hanging vertically (such plants are said to have an erectophile LAD), while oaks tend to maintain their leaves more or less horizontally (these species are known as having a planophile LAD). In some tree species, leaves near the top of the [[Canopy (forest)|canopy]] follow an erectophile LAD while those at the bottom of the canopy are more planophile. This may be interpreted as a strategy by that plant species to maximize exposure to light, an important constraint to growth and development. Yet other species (notably [[sunflower]]) are capable of reorienting their leaves throughout the day to optimize exposure to the Sun: this is known as [[heliotropism]].

==Importance of LAD==

The LAD of a plant canopy has a significant impact on the [[Reflection (physics)|reflectance]], [[transmittance]] and [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of solar light in the vegetation layer, and thus also on its growth and development. LAD can also serve as a quantitative index to monitor the state of the plants, as [[wilting]] usually results in more erectophile LADs. [[Scientific modelling|Models]] of [[radiation]] transfer need to take this distribution into account to predict, for instance, the [[albedo]] or the productivity of the canopy.

==Measuring LAD==

Accurately measuring the statistical properties of leaf angle distributions is not a trivial matter, especially for small leaves. [[Clinometer]]s can be used but may be rather bulky or inconvenient. Most leaves are quite light and tend to move with the slightest [[Wind|breeze]] or air [[turbulence]]. Nevertheless, when these environmental conditions are suitable or can be controlled, it is possible to acquire data on leaf orientation.

This may be done, for instance, with a Spatial Coordinate Apparatus, which is an articulated mechanical device capable or recording the position in three-dimensional space of three separate points forming a small triangle. The orientation of the triangle is computed from these coordinates.

Yet another approach is to use a [[3D_scanner|laser scanner]]: this instrument can record the angular and distance coordinates of the intersection of a laser beam with objects within its range. The LAD of canopy leaves can be derived from such measurements.

Extensive data sets of LAD have been recorded, especially during intensive field campaigns, such as the First ISLSCP Field Experiment (FIFE) or the SAFARI 2000 field campaign. See the external links below for getting access to these data.

==LAD functions==

In general, LAD are modelled with one- or two-parameters functions including ellipsoidal, rotated-ellipsoidal and Beta functions. Comparison between different LAD functions with in-situ measurements show that, two-parameter functions (especially Beta function) may perform better than one-parameter functions.

Usually, only the remnants of tropical cyclones affect California. Since 1900, only two tropical storms have hit California, one by direct landfall from offshore, another after making landfall in [[Mexico]].&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

Since 1850, only seven  tropical cyclones have brought gale-force winds to the [[Southwestern United States]]. They are: The [[1858 San Diego hurricane]] that was reconstructed as just missing landfall in 1858, the [[1939 California tropical storm|1939 Long Beach tropical storm]] that made landfall near [[San Pedro Bay (California)|San Pedro]] in 1939, the remnants of [[1963 Pacific hurricane season#Tropical_Storm_Jennifer-Katherine|Tropical Storm Jennifer-Katherine]] in 1963, the remnants of [[1965 Pacific hurricane season#Hurricane_Emily|Hurricane Emily]] in 1965, the remnants of [[Hurricane Joanne (1972)|Hurricane Joanne]] in 1972, the remnants of [[Hurricane Kathleen (1976)|Hurricane Kathleen]] in 1976, and [[Hurricane Nora (1997)|Hurricane Nora]] in 1997, after it was downgraded to a tropical storm.

In most cases, rainfall is the only effect that these cyclones have on California. Sometimes, the rainfall is severe enough to cause flooding and damage. For example, floods from Hurricane Kathleen devastated [[Ocotillo, California]] and killed several people.

==Explanation for rarity==

There are two reasons why tropical cyclones rarely strike California at tropical storm intensity or higher: [[sea surface temperatures]], and the usual [[Tropical cyclone#Steering winds|upper level steering winds]] in the eastern Pacific, with sea surface temperatures being more important.

Tropical cyclones usually require very warm water to depth, generally above 26.5&amp;nbsp;°C (80&amp;nbsp;°F) extending to a depth of 50&amp;nbsp;meters (160&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref name=A16&gt;{{cite web | title=Subject: A16) Why do tropical cyclones require 80 °F (26.5 °C) ocean temperatures to form ? | work= Tropical Cyclone FAQ| url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A16.html | accessdate=2007-12-25| author=[[Christopher Landsea]]|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the waters off California are cold even in summer. They rarely rise above 24&amp;nbsp;°C (75&amp;nbsp;°F) in near-shore southern California,&lt;ref name=G8&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/G8.html|title=Subject: G8) Why do hurricanes hit the East coast of the U.S., but never the West coast?|work=Tropical Cyclone FAQ|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|author=[[Christopher Landsea]]|accessdate=2007-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and usually remain below 17&amp;nbsp;°C (63&amp;nbsp;°F) along most of the rest of the coast and outer coastal waters, although [[El Niño]] events may warm the waters somewhat. This is due primarily to the extensive [[upwelling]] of colder sub-surface waters caused by the prevailing northwesterly winds acting through the [[Ekman spiral|Ekman Effect]]. The winds drive surface water to the right of the wind flow, that is offshore, which draws water up from below to replace it. The upwelling further cools the already cool [[California Current]] which runs north to south along coastal California and even much of coastal [[Baja California]]. This is the same mechanism which produces coastal California's characteristic fog.

The second reason is the general path of tropical cyclones in the eastern Pacific. They generally move north-westward or westward due to steering by the prevailing upper level winds, which takes them far out to sea and away from land.&lt;ref name=G8/&gt;

These factors make eastern Pacific landfalls improbable north of about central Baja California. In those instances when upper level steering winds do allow a more northerly path, much cooler sea surface temperatures quickly weaken tropical cyclones that approach California, although torrential rainfall can still occur. For example, the September 24-hour rainfall record for [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] is held by the [[1939 Long Beach Tropical Storm]], as of January 2007.&lt;ref name="history of sig events p14"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/sgx/document/weatherhistory.pdf#page=14|title=A History of Significant Weather Events in Southern California|date=February 2010|publisher=National Weather Service Forecast Office San Diego|format=PDF|page=14|accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of tropical cyclones==
Hurricanes that affect California are mainly the remnants of hurricanes or tropical storms. In the twentieth century, only four eastern Pacific tropical cyclones have brought tropical storm-force winds to the [[Continental United States]]: the [[1939 Long Beach Tropical Storm]], [[Hurricane Joanne (1972)|Tropical Storm Joanne]] in 1972, [[Hurricane Kathleen (1976)|Tropical Storm Kathleen]] in 1976, and [[Hurricane Nora (1997)|Tropical Storm Nora]] in 1997.&lt;ref name="sandiegohurricane"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/Landsea/chenowethlandsea.pdf|title=The San Diego Hurricane of October 2, 1858|author=[[Christopher Landsea]] &amp; Michael Chenoweth|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|work=[[Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society]]|pages=1689|date=November 2004|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*September 3–4, 2017: Moisture from [[Tropical Storm Lidia (2017)|Tropical Storm Lidia]]'s remnant low brought flash flooding and thunderstorms to Southern California.

*October 12, 2018: The remnants of [[Hurricane Sergio (2018)|Hurricane Sergio]] spawned numerous thunderstorms in Southern California, as well as triggering a high surf advisory along the coast.

==Climatological statistics==
Most tropical cyclones impacting California do so in the month of September. September 1939 was "unprecedented" in having four tropical cyclones impact the state.&lt;ref name="history of sig events p13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/sgx/document/weatherhistory.pdf#page=14|title=A History of Significant Weather Events in Southern California|format=PDF|pages=13–14|publisher=National Weather Service Forecast Office San Diego|accessdate=16 January 2016|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern repeats==
While rare, tropical cyclones do affect California, occasionally very seriously as far as rainfall is concerned.

===Damage===
[[Image:CaliforniaTropicalCycloneBreakpoints.png|thumb|350px|right|Map of warning breakpoints]]

A modern repeat of the 1858 storm is estimated to cause damages of hundreds of millions of dollars.&lt;ref name="sandiegohurricane"/&gt; A repeat of the 1939 tropical storm would cause around 200&amp;nbsp;million dollars in damage.&lt;ref name="sandiegohurricane"/&gt; The most serious damage would be due to rains rather than winds or storm surge, although distant hurricanes may still create heavy surf,&lt;ref name="nhclinda1997"/&gt; possibly injuring or killing people. Nora caused millions in damage and skirted extreme southeastern California.

===Preparedness===
When [[Hurricane Linda (1997)|Hurricane Linda]] was forecast to make landfall, statements about its possible impact were issued by the [[Oxnard, California]] office of the [[National Weather Service]]. They stressed the uncertainty of a forecast that far in the future.

When Nora was threatening, "unprecedented coordination" was required between the NHC and several other agencies. The coordination was "smooth and effective".&lt;ref name="nhcnora1997"/&gt; However, no inland tropical storm warnings were issued for any area in the United States as Nora was approaching from the south.&lt;ref name="nhcnora1997"/&gt;

There are seven Pacific Coast breakpoints in the United States. They are, from north to south, [[Piedras Blancas Light Station|Point Piedras Blancas]], [[Point Sal State Beach|Point Sal]], [[Point Conception]], [[Point Mugu, California|Point Mugu]], the mouth of the [[San Gabriel River (California)|San Gabriel River]], San Mateo Point, and the mouth of the [[Tijuana River]] (although places outside this area can be selected if conditions warrant).&lt;ref name="nhccaliforniabreakpointslocations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/breakpoints_list.shtml? |publisher=National Hurricane Center |title=Hurricane and Tropical Storm Watch/Warning Breakpoints |accessdate=2012-07-22 |date=2012-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708223310/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/breakpoints_list.shtml |archivedate=July  8, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Should there be the threat of landfall, [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|warnings or watches]] would be issued for those sections of the coast. It is highly unlikely that any tropical cyclone will threaten areas farther north, due to the stronger influence of the [[California Current]].

This is a listing of minor planets orbiting the Sun by their approximate distance from the [[Sun]] in March 2018 (as opposed to those with the greatest calculated [[aphelion]] in their orbit). In March 2018 several new [[Trans-Neptunian object]]s (TNOs) with a current heliocentric distance greater than 50 AU were announced by [[Scott S. Sheppard]], [[Chad Trujillo]], and [[David J. Tholen]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/astrokiwi/status/973329908297543681 MPECs 2018-E75 to E78 and MPECs 2018-E83 to E90. Planetary astronomer Michele Bannister]&lt;/ref&gt;

Trans-Neptunian objects are typically announced publicly months or years after their discovery, so as to make sure the orbit is correct before announcing it. Due to their greater distance from the Sun and slow movement across the sky, trans-Neptunian objects with [[observation arc]]s less than several years often have poorly constrained orbits. Particularly distant asteroids discovered in 2018 may only be announced in 2020 or later.

'''LituanicaSAT-1''' is one of the two first [[Lithuania]]n satellites. It was launched along with [[Cygnus 2|the second Cygnus spacecraft]] and 28 [[Flock-1]] [[CubeSat]]s aboard an [[Antares (rocket)|Antares 120]] carrier rocket flying from [[Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport Launch Pad 0|Pad 0B]] at the [[Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport]] on [[Wallops Island]] to the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/cubesat_deployment/#.U1612EKSzSw|title=It’s a March of the CubeSats as Space Station Deployment Continues|first=Kristine|last=Rainey|date=22 July 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch was scheduled to occur in December 2013, but later was rescheduled to 9 January 2014.

The mission is considered a complete success by its team of engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsat-uk.org/tag/lituanicasat-1/|title=LituanicaSat-1 - AMSAT-UK|website=amsat-uk.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dk3wn.info/p/?p=44461|title=LituanicaSat transponder test was a full success|website=DK3WN SatBlog}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission ended upon the reentry and disintegration of the satellite on July 28, 2014.

==Description==
The satellite conforms to standard 1U size [[cubesat]] form factor as to the latest cubesat design specifications. The satellite does not have any active systems except the antenna deployment mechanism that is engaged 30 minutes after deployment sequence. Both attitude and thermal control sub-systems are implemented passively for simplicity and safety. The total mass of the body including the equipment within it is 1,090&amp;nbsp;g.

==Subsystems==
===Attitude determination and control===
LituanicaSAT-1 uses passive magnetic attitude control system consisting of permanent magnets that create a control torque and soft magnets that provide dampening torque using [[hysteresis]] effect. Following attitude sensors are implemented for attitude determination:

* PS-MPU-6000A MEMS [[motion sensor]]
* PS-MPU-9150A MEMS motion sensor
* L3GD20 MEMS three-axis digital output gyroscope
* HMC5883L three-axis digital magnetometer

===Command and data management===
There are two on board computers in LituanicaSAT-1 due to redundancy requirements: the flight computer based on [[ARM Cortex-M4F]] microcontroller and secondary (back-up) computer based on an [[Atmel]] [[ATMega2560]] microcontroller. The flight computer is the central control unit of the satellite responsible for maintaining the normal operating mode of the satellite, monitoring and control of energy resources, control of attitude determination sub-system and performance of telecommands received from the satellite ground station in [[Vilnius University]], [[Lithuania]]. Secondary flight computer is based on [[Arduino]]. It ensures limited but safe functionality of the satellite in case of the main CPU failure and will also take and record the first pictures made from space, as well as control the radio beacon of the satellite.

===Payload===
&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:LituanicaSAT-1 FM repeater board.jpg|thumbnail]] --&gt;
The main payload is [[amateur radio]] FM mode V/U voice repeater.  It operates on 145.950&amp;nbsp;MHz uplink (PL 67&amp;nbsp;Hz CTCSS) and 435.180&amp;nbsp;MHz downlink. The FM repeater subsystem identifies itself with callsign LY5N. The first filter of repeaters receiver is 15&amp;nbsp;kHz wide, second is 12&amp;nbsp;kHz. The transmit filter is set to +/- 5&amp;nbsp;kHz, and bandwidth to 10&amp;nbsp;kHz, but this width depends highly on the incoming signal width, for example if the uplink signal is 15&amp;nbsp;kHz wide, it will be cut down with 12&amp;nbsp;kHz filter. The repeater payload was engineered and developed by [[Žilvinas Atkočiūnas]] and [[Žilvinas Batisa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ly3h.epalete.com/?p=303|title=LituanicaSat-1 repeater rev.2 – LY3H|website=ly3h.epalete.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to temperature changes, the downlink frequency may be shifted down by 5&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dk3wn.info/p/?cat=157|title=LituanicaSat – DK3WN SatBlog|website=www.dk3wn.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power supply subsystem===
The power supply sub-system includes a GomSpace Nanopower P31u power board with a lithium-ion battery and solar cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kosmonautai.lt/en/satellite/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704072231/http://www.kosmonautai.lt/en/satellite/ |archivedate=4 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Communications subsystem===
Comm subsystem consists of [[AX.25]] transceiver and corresponding antennas. [[He-100 COTS]] transceiver is used for establishing and maintaining radio communication with the ground station. The key technical specifications of the radio transceiver are as follows:

* Operating frequencies: TX: 437&amp;nbsp;MHz / RX: 144&amp;nbsp;MHz
* Sensitivity: -104.7 dBm @ BER 10-3
* Transmit power: 100&amp;nbsp;mW – 2 W
* Receive power: &lt; 200&amp;nbsp;mW
* Data transfer rate: 9600 bit/s
* Data protocol: AX.25
* Operating temperature: from -30 to +70&amp;nbsp;°C

===Antennas===
There are 4 monopole antennas on LS-1: three UHF antennas and one VHF antenna. Each antenna is made of approx. 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm thick and 5&amp;nbsp;mm wide spring steel measurement tape. In deployed configuration, all UHF antennas are pointed towards the Z+ body axis direction and VHF antenna is pointed toward –Z body axis.

==Mission control==
The satellite is commanded from [[Vilnius University]] [[amateur radio station]], LY1BWB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rk.projektas.vu.lt|title=VU radijo klubas LY1BWB - kolektyvinio radijo mėgėjų tobulėjimo tinklaraštis|website=www.rk.projektas.vu.lt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ground control software is written in [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]] and has a web interface, served by [[Yaws]]. The source code of the software is partly available for public use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/kape1395/ls1mcs|title=ls1mcs: LituanicaSat-1 MCS|first=Karolis|last=Petrauskas|date=29 August 2014|publisher=|via=GitHub}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communication is done using custom protocol, which is built on top of reduced set of [[AX.25]] and handles [[full-duplex]] data transfer, when required. Recent versions of ground control software support direct upload of binary [[telemetry]] files, which were collected and sent to ground control by amateur radio operators worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kosmonautai.lt/en/data-submission/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530204210/http://www.kosmonautai.lt/en/data-submission/ |archivedate=30 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==OSCAR status==
On June 8, 2014, [[AMSAT|AMSAT-NA]] [[OSCAR]] number administrator Bill Tynan, W3XO, stated that "LituanicaSAT-1 has met all of the requirements for an OSCAR number" and assigned the designation of LO-78 (LituanicaSAT-OSCAR 78) to the satellite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amsat.org/?p=2794|title=OSCAR Number for LituanicaSAT-1 – AMSAT-NA|website=Amsat.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team of engineers subsequently announced that it will try to keep the onboard FM repeater operative for the rest of the mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://amsat-uk.org/2014/06/06/lituanicasat-1-fm-transponder-active/|title=LituanicaSAT-1 FM Transponder Active|date=6 June 2014|website=Amsat-uk.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6356">'''The Lower Mainland Ecoregion''' is the biogeoclimatic region that surrounds [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], comprising the eastern edge of the [[Georgia Depression]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=BC Ministry of Environment|url=http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/ecology/ecoregions/humidtemp.html#georgia|title=Georgia Depression Ecoprovince|work=Ecoregions of British Columbia|accessdate=June 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and extending from  [[Powell River, British Columbia]] on the [[Sunshine Coast, British Columbia|Sunshine Coast]] to [[Hope, British Columbia|Hope]] at the eastern end of the [[Fraser Valley]]. It thus corresponds, for the most part, with the popular usage of the term "[[Lower Mainland]]." The Lower Mainland Ecoregion is a part of the Pacific Maritime Ecozone.&lt;ref&gt;Environment Canada. [http://ecozones.ca/english/zone/PacificMaritime/ecoregions.html Pacific Maritime Ecozone]. Ecological Framework of Canada. Retrieved on: 2011-07-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecoregion is bounded by the [[Coast Mountains|Coast]] and [[Cascade Range|Cascade Mountains]] and traversed by the [[Fraser River]]. It has a unique [[climate]], [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]], [[geology]] and [[land use]].  The following description is adapted from Environment Canada's ''Ecological Framework of Canada.''&lt;ref name = EC196&gt;Environment Canada. [http://ecozones.ca/english/region/196.html Ecoregions of Canada - Lower Mainland]. Ecological Framework of Canada. Retrieved on: 2011-07-09&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The ecoregion extends west from the [[Skagit Range]] of the Cascade Mountains at Chilliwack to the Fraser river delta at [[Richmond, BC|Richmond]] and north to include a portion of the Georgia Lowland along the Sunshine Coast.&lt;ref name = EC196/&gt;

===Climate===
The mean annual temperature in the Lower Mainland is 9°C with a summer mean of 15 °C and a winter mean of 3.5 °C. Annual precipitation ranges from an annual mean of 850 mm in the west end to 2000 mm in the eastern end of the Fraser Valley and at higher elevations. Maximum precipitation occurs as rain in winter. Less than ten percent falls as snow at sea level but the amount of snowfall increases significantly with elevation.&lt;ref name = EC196/&gt;

===Flora and fauna===
Forests of [[Coast Douglas-fir]], with an understory of [[salal]], [[Oregon-grape]] and [[moss]], are typical of the mature native vegetation found throughout the ecoregion. Mixed stands of Coast Douglas-fir and [[Western Hemlock]] are common, with some [[dogwood]] and [[arbutus]] occurring on drier sites. [[Alnus rubra|Red alder]] is a common pioneer species where sites have been disturbed. Wet sites support Coast Douglas-fir, Western Hemlock, and [[Thuja plicata|Western Redcedar]]. Wildlife includes [[black-tailed deer]], [[coyote]], [[raccoon]], [[shorebirds]], and [[waterfowl]].&lt;ref name = EC196/&gt;

===Geology===
The ecoregion is underlain by unconsolidated [[glaciofluvial]] deposits, silty [[alluvium]], silty and clayey marine [[sediments]] and glacial till. Bedrock outcrops of [[Mesozoic]] and [[Palaeozoic]] origin form rolling hills up to about 310 metres above sea level. The Fraser River dominates this lowland. Gleysols, Mesisols, and Humisols are the dominant wetland soils in the region, while Eutric and Dystric Brunisols and some [[Podzols]] have developed on sandy to loamy outwash and glacial till in the uplands.&lt;ref name = EC196/&gt;

===Land use===
The region includes a mix of [[Urban planning|urban settlement]] and [[Agriculture|agricultural]] land, comprising both the largest population centre  and some of the most fertile farmland in British Columbia. Intensive agriculture occurs on the rich bottomland of the Fraser Valley where it competes with urban development. [[Forestry]] takes place on the slopes of the mountains. Coastal salt marshes provide important wildlife habitat in the Fraser delta and [[Boundary Bay]]. There are about 870 square kilometres of productive farmland in the ecoregion.&lt;ref name = EC196/&gt; 

There is rapid urban and suburban growth in the Vancouver area and communities in the Fraser Valley and Sunshine Coast. The main population centre in this ecoregion is [[Metro Vancouver|Greater Vancouver]].  Other centres include North Vancouver ([[North Vancouver (city)|city]] and [[North Vancouver (district municipality)|district]]), [[Chilliwack, British Columbia|Chilliwack]], [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]], and [[Mission, British Columbia|Mission]].&lt;ref name = EC196/&gt; 

====Profile of land use====
Agricultural land area remained relatively stable between 1971 and 2006, declining by less than 3%. While the number of cattle declined by 12% during this period, poultry inventories increased significantly, rising by 129%. The region accounted for 13% of Canada’s poultry production in 2006. &lt;ref name = profile&gt;Statistics Canada [http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/16-002-x/2009004/article/11031-eng.htm Ecoregion profile: Lower Mainland of British Columbia]. Retrieved on: 2011-07-09.&lt;/ref&gt; The ecoregion's population increased 102% between 1971 and 2006 as compared to Canada's population growth of 47%. With 473 persons per square kilometre in 2006, the ecoregion was Canada’s most densely populated. The population of the ecoregion in 2006 was approximately 2.4 million people, which represents 7.6% of Canada’s population.&lt;ref name = profile/&gt;

[[File:macquarie.png|250px|thumb|right|Macquarie Fault Zone (yellow line) with [[earthquake]] [[epicenter]]s (white circles)]]
The '''Macquarie Fault Zone''' is a major right lateral-moving [[transform fault]] along the seafloor of the south [[Pacific Ocean]] which runs from [[New Zealand]] southwestward to the [[Macquarie Triple Junction]].  It is also the [[tectonic]] plate boundary between the [[Indo-Australian Plate]] to the northwest and the [[Pacific Plate]] to the southeast.

The Macquarie Fault Zone includes a component of convergence which increases as it approaches the South Island of New Zealand.  Many researchers conclude that the fault zone here is an incipient [[subduction zone]], with oblique motion corresponding to the transition from lateral (strike-slip) motion.  In the area known as the [[Puysegur Trench]], the Indo-Australian Plate appears to be starting to sink beneath the Pacific Plate, the reverse of what is occurring off of New Zealand's North Island (see [[Kermadec-Tonga Subduction Zone]]).

A major geographic feature which runs along the Macquarie Fault Zone is known as the Macquarie Ridge.  This ridge represents both the different relative heights of the abutting plates as well as the component of compression between the plates.  The namesake [[Macquarie Island]], named after [[Lachlan Macquarie]] lies atop a segment of the Macquarie Ridge.

The Macquarie Fault Zone merges into the [[Alpine Fault]] which cuts across the [[continental crust]] of New Zealand's South Island.

This is studied under the specialized scientific subjects of [[plasma physics]], [[space physics]] and [[aeronomy]].

==History==
{{main|Magnetosphere chronology}}
Study of Earth's magnetosphere began in 1600, when [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] discovered that the magnetic field on the surface of Earth resembled that on a [[terrella]], a small, magnetized sphere. In the 1940s, [[Walter M. Elsasser]] proposed the model of [[dynamo theory]], which attributes [[Earth's magnetic field]] to the motion of  Earth's [[iron]] [[outer core]]. Through the use of [[magnetometer]]s, scientists were able to study the variations in Earth's magnetic field as functions of both time and latitude and longitude. 

Beginning in the late 1940s, rockets were used to study [[cosmic rays]]. In 1958, [[Explorer 1]], the first of the Explorer series of space missions, was launched to study the intensity of cosmic rays above the atmosphere and measure the fluctuations in this activity. This mission observed the existence of the [[Van Allen radiation belt]] (located in the inner region of Earth's magnetosphere), with the follow up [[Explorer 3]] later that year definitively proving its existence. Also during 1958, [[Eugene Parker]] proposed the idea of the [[solar wind]], with the term 'magnetosphere' being proposed by [[Thomas Gold]] in 1959 to explain how the solar wind interacted with the Earth's magnetic field. The later mission of Explorer 12 in 1961 led by the Cahill and Amazeen observation in 1963 of a sudden decrease in magnetic field strength near the noon-time meridian, later was named the [[magnetopause]]. By 1983, the [[International Cometary Explorer]] observed the magnetotail, or the distant magnetic field.&lt;ref name="Van Allen"/&gt;

==Structure and behavior==
Magnetospheres are dependent on several variables: the type of astronomical object, the nature of sources of plasma and momentum, the [[frequency|period]] of the object's spin, the nature of the axis about which the object spins, the axis of the magnetic dipole, and the magnitude and direction of the flow of [[solar wind]].

The planetary distance where the magnetosphere can withstand the solar wind pressure is called the Chapman–Ferraro distance. This is usefully modeled by the formula wherein &lt;math&gt;R_P&lt;/math&gt; represents the radius of the planet, &lt;math&gt;B_{\it surf}&lt;/math&gt; represents the magnetic field on the surface of the planet at the equator, and &lt;math&gt;V_{SW}&lt;/math&gt; represents the velocity of the solar wind:

:&lt;math&gt;R_{CF}=R_{P} \left( \frac{B_{\it surf}^2}{\mu_{0} \rho V_{SW}^2} \right) ^{\frac{1}{6}}&lt;/math&gt;

A magnetosphere is classified as "intrinsic" when &lt;math&gt;R_{CF} \gg R_{P}&lt;/math&gt;, or when the primary opposition to the flow of solar wind is the magnetic field of the object. [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], Earth, [[Jupiter]], [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]], for example,  exhibit intrinsic magnetospheres. A magnetosphere is classified as "induced" when &lt;math&gt;R_{CF} \ll R_P&lt;/math&gt;, or when the solar wind is not opposed by the object's magnetic field. In this case, the solar wind interacts with the atmosphere or ionosphere of the planet (or surface of the planet, if the planet has no atmosphere). [[Venus]] has an induced magnetic field, which means that because Venus appears to have no [[Dynamo theory|internal dynamo effect]], the only magnetic field present is that formed by the solar wind's wrapping around the physical obstacle of Venus (see also [[Atmosphere of Venus#Induced magnetosphere|Venus' induced magnetosphere]]). When &lt;math&gt;R_{CF} \approx R_P&lt;/math&gt;, the planet itself and its magnetic field both contribute. It is possible that [[Mars]] is of this type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blanc|first1=M.|last2=Kallenbach|first2=R.|last3=Erkaev|first3=N.V.|title=Solar System Magnetospheres|journal=Space Science Reviews|volume=116|date=2005|issue=116|pages=227–298|doi=10.1007/s11214-005-1958-y|bibcode=2005SSRv..116..227B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For stars, this is usually the boundary between the [[stellar wind]] and [[interstellar medium]]; for planets, the speed of the solar wind there decreases as it approaches the magnetopause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sparavigna|first1=A.C.|last2=Marazzato|first2=R.|title=Observing stellar bow shocks|date=10 May 2010|url=https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1005/1005.1527.pdf|format=PDF|bibcode=2010arXiv1005.1527S|arxiv=1005.1527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetosheath===
{{main|Magnetosheath}}
The magnetosheath is the region of the magnetosphere between the bow shock and the magnetopause. It is formed mainly from shocked solar wind, though it contains a small amount of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] from the magnetosphere.&lt;ref name=cluster&gt;{{Cite book|editor1-last=Paschmann|editor1-first=G.|editor2-last=Schwartz|editor2-first=S.J.|editor3-last=Escoubet|editor3-first=C.P.|editor4-last=Haaland|editor4-first=S.|title=Outer Magnetospheric Boundaries: Cluster Results|journal=Space Science Reviews|date=2005|volume=118|issue=1–4|isbn=978-1-4020-3488-6|doi=10.1007/1-4020-4582-4 |url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/1250411/files/978-1-4020-4582-0_BookTOC.pdf|series=Space Sciences Series of ISSI}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an area exhibiting high particle [[energy flux]], where the direction and magnitude of the magnetic field varies erratically. This is caused by the collection of solar wind gas that has effectively undergone [[thermalization]]. It acts as a cushion that transmits the pressure from the flow of the solar wind and the barrier of the magnetic field from the object.&lt;ref name="Van Allen"/&gt;

===Magnetopause===
{{main|Magnetopause}}
The magnetopause is the area of the magnetosphere wherein the pressure from the planetary magnetic field is balanced with the pressure from the solar wind.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; It is the convergence of the shocked solar wind from the magnetosheath with the magnetic field of the object and plasma from the magnetosphere. Because both sides of this convergence contain magnetized plasma, the interactions between them are complex. The structure of the magnetopause depends upon the [[Mach number]] and [[Beta (plasma physics)|beta]] of the plasma, as well as the magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Russell|first=C.T.|title=The Magnetopause|journal=Physics of Magnetic Flux Ropes|date=1990|pages=439–453|url=http://www-ssc.igpp.ucla.edu/ssc/tutorial/magnetopause.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magnetopause changes size and shape as the pressure from the solar wind fluctuates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Magnetopause|url=http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/wmpause.html|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetotail===
Opposite the compressed magnetic field is the magnetotail, where the magnetosphere extends far beyond the astronomical object. It contains two lobes, referred to as the northern and southern tail lobes. Magnetic field lines in the northern tail lobe point towards the object while those in the southern tail lobe point away. The tail lobes are almost empty, with few charged particles opposing the flow of the solar wind. The two lobes are separated by a plasma sheet, an area where the magnetic field is weaker, and the density of charged particles is higher.&lt;ref name="tail"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tail of the Magnetosphere|url=http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/wtail.html|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over Earth's [[equator]], the magnetic field lines become almost horizontal, then return to reconnect at high latitudes. However, at high altitudes, the magnetic field is significantly distorted by the solar wind and its solar magnetic field. On the dayside of Earth, the magnetic field is significantly compressed by the solar wind to a distance of approximately {{convert|65,000|km|sp=us}}. Earth's bow shock is about {{convert|17|km|sp=us}} thick&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cluster reveals Earth's bow shock is remarkably thin|url=http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=49637|newspaper=[[European Space Agency]]|date=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and located about {{convert|90,000|km|sp=us}} from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cluster reveals the reformation of Earth's bow shock|url=http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=40994|newspaper=European Space Agency|date=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magnetopause exists at a distance of several hundred kilometers above Earth's surface. Earth's magnetopause has been compared to a [[sieve]] because it allows solar wind particles to enter. [[Kelvin–Helmholtz instability|Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities]] occur when large swirls of plasma travel along the edge of the magnetosphere at a different velocity from the magnetosphere, causing the plasma to slip past. This results in [[magnetic reconnection]], and as the magnetic field lines break and reconnect, solar wind particles are able to enter the magnetosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cluster observes a 'porous' magnetopause|url=http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=50977|newspaper=European Space Agency|date=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Earth's nightside, the magnetic field extends in the magnetotail, which lengthwise exceeds {{convert|6,300,000|km|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; Earth's magnetotail is the primary source of the [[Aurora (astronomy)|polar aurora]].&lt;ref name=tail/&gt; Also, NASA scientists have suggested that Earth's magnetotail might cause "dust storms" on the Moon by creating a potential difference between the day side and the night side.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/topics/moonmars/features/magnetotail_080416.html NASA, ''The Moon and the Magnetotail''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6065">[[Methanogens]] are a group of [[microorganisms]] that can produce [[methane]] as a byproduct of their metabolism.They hold an important place in the digestive system of [[ruminants]]. The [[digestive tract]] of ruminants contain four major parts, they are [[abomasum]], [[rumen]], [[omasum]] and [[Reticulum (anatomy)|reticulum]].The food with saliva is first passed to the rumen for breaking them into smaller particles and then it moves to the reticulum where the food is broken into further smaller particles and the indigestable particles are sent back for [[rechewing]] and then to rumen. &amp;nbsp;The majority of the [[anaerobic microbe]]s assisting the cellulose breakdown occupy the rumen. They initiate the fermentation process.The animal observes the fatty acids, vitamins and nutrient content on passing the partially digested food from rumen to omasum which, decreases the pH level and thus initiates the release of enzymes for further break down the food which is later passed to the abomasumthat absorbs remaining nutrients before excretion.This process takes about 9–12 hours.

Some of the microbes in ruminant digestive system are:

'''Methanol''', also known as '''methyl alcohol''' among others, is a [[chemical compound|chemical]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] [[carbon|C]][[hydrogen|H]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[[oxygen|O]][[hydrogen|H]] (a [[methyl group]] linked to a [[hydroxyl group]], often [[abbreviated]] MeOH). Methanol acquired the name '''wood alcohol''' because it was once produced chiefly by the [[destructive distillation]] of [[wood]].  Today, methanol is mainly produced industrially by [[hydrogenation]] of [[carbon monoxide]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

Methanol is the simplest [[alcohol]], consisting of a [[methyl group]] linked to a [[hydroxyl]] group. It is a light, [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]], colorless, [[flammable]] liquid with a distinctive odor similar to that of [[ethanol]] (drinking alcohol).&lt;ref name=ershdb&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Methanol is however far more toxic than ethanol. At room temperature, it is a [[Polar solvent|polar liquid]]. With more than 20 million tons produced annually, it is used as a precursor to other [[commodity chemicals]], including [[formaldehyde]], [[acetic acid]], [[methyl tert-butyl ether]], as well as a host of more specialized chemicals.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

==Occurrence==
Small amounts of methanol are found in normal, healthy human individuals, concluded by one study which found a mean of 4.5&amp;nbsp;[[parts per million|ppm]] in the exhaled breath of subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Turner C|title=A longitudinal study of methanol in the exhaled breath of 30 healthy volunteers using selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry, SIFT-MS|journal=Physiological Measurement|volume=27|issue=7|pages=637–48|pmid=16705261|year=2006|doi=10.1088/0967-3334/27/7/007|bibcode=2006PhyM...27..637T}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mean endogenous methanol in humans of 0.45 g/d may be metabolized from [[pectin]] found in fruit; one kilogram of apple produces up to 1.4 g methanol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Lindinger W|title=Endogenous production of methanol after the consumption of fruit|journal=Alcoholism, Clinical and Experimental Research|volume=21|issue=5|pages=939–43|pmid=9267548|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methanol is produced naturally in the [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] [[metabolism]] of many varieties of bacteria and is commonly present in small amounts in the environment. As a result, the atmosphere contains a small amount of methanol vapor. Atmospheric methanol is [[oxidized]] by air in sunlight to carbon dioxide and water over the course of days.

===Interstellar medium===
Methanol is also found in abundant quantities in star-forming regions of space and is used in astronomy as a marker for such regions. It is detected through its spectral emission lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Why_astronomers_hate_the_lawn-mowing_Roomba_999.html |title= Why astronomers hate the lawn-mowing Roomba |publisher= Space Daily |date= 17 April 2015 |author= Brooks Hays }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, astronomers using the [[MERLIN]] array of radio telescopes at [[Jodrell Bank|Jodrell Bank Observatory]] discovered a large cloud of methanol in space, 288 million miles (463 million km) across.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/news/2006/cloud/ | publisher = [[Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics]] | title = Upgraded MERLIN spies cloud of alcohol spanning 288 billion miles | date = 19 April 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110720152236/http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/news/2006/cloud/ | archivedate = 20 July 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher = BBC News | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4878048.stm | title = Merlin sees vast alcohol stream | author = Amos, Jonathan | date = 5 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, astronomers detected methyl alcohol in a planet-forming disc around the young star [[TW Hydrae]] using [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array|ALMA]] radio telescope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Detection of Methyl Alcohol in a Planet-forming Disc|url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1619/|accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toxicity==
{{Main|Methanol toxicity}}
{{see also|List of methanol poisoning incidents}}
Methanol has low acute toxicity in humans but is dangerous because, together with ethanol, it is occasionally ingested in large volumes. As little as {{convert|10|mL|USoz|abbr=on}} of pure methanol can cause permanent blindness by destruction of the [[optic nerve]].  {{convert|30|mL|USoz|abbr=on}} is potentially fatal.&lt;ref name="Vale"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vale A |title=Methanol |journal=Medicine |volume=35 |issue=12 |pages=633–4 |year=2007|doi=10.1016/j.mpmed.2007.09.014|pmid=26594941 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The median lethal dose is {{convert|100|mL|USoz|abbr=on}} (i.e. 1–2&amp;nbsp;mL/kg body weight of pure methanol&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Methanol Poisoning Overview|url=http://www.antizol.com/mpoisono.htm|publisher=Antizol|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005043548/http://www.antizol.com/mpoisono.htm|archivedate=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The [[reference dose]] for methanol is 2&amp;nbsp;mg/kg in a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/iris/subst/0305.htm|title=Integrated Risk Information System|publisher=US EPA, ORD, NCEA, IRISD}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/iris/iris_documents/documents/toxreviews/0305tr.pdf |title= Toxicological Review of Methanol (Noncancer) (CAS No. 67-56-1) In Support of Summary Information on the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) |id= EPA/635/R-11/001Fa |publisher= [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] |date= September 2013 |accessdate= 4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toxic effects begin hours after ingestion, and antidotes can often prevent permanent damage.&lt;ref name="Vale"/&gt; Because of its similarities in both appearance and odor to [[ethanol]] (the alcohol in beverages), it is difficult to differentiate between the two (such is also the case with [[denatured alcohol]], adulterated liquors or very low quality alcoholic beverages). However, cases exist of methanol resistance, such as that of [[Michael Malloy|Mike Malloy]] who was the victim of a failed murder attempt by methanol in the early 1930s.&lt;ref name="Blum2011"&gt;{{cite book|first=Deborah |last=Blum|title=The Poisoner's Handbook: Murder and the Birth of Forensic Medicine in Jazz Age New York|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=AkGDmAEACAAJ|page=231}}|date=January 2011|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-311882-4|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methanol is [[toxic]] by two mechanisms. First, methanol can be fatal due to its [[CNS depressant]] properties in the same manner as [[ethanol poisoning]]. Second, in a process of [[toxication]], it is [[metabolism|metabolized]] to formic acid (which is present as the formate ion) via [[formaldehyde]] in a process initiated by the [[enzyme]] [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] in the [[liver]].&lt;ref name="Schep"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schep LJ, Slaughter RJ, Vale JA, Beasley DM |title=A seaman with blindness and confusion |journal=[[BMJ]]|volume=339 |pages=b3929 |date=2009|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/339/sep30_1/b3929|doi=10.1136/bmj.b3929|pmid=19793790}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methanol is converted to formaldehyde via alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and formaldehyde is converted to formic acid (formate) via [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]] (ALDH).  The conversion to formate via ALDH proceeds completely, with no detectable formaldehyde remaining.&lt;ref name=noCHOH&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=McMartin KE, Martin-Amat G, Noker PE, Tephly TR |title=Lack of a role for formaldehyde in methanol poisoning in the monkey |journal=Biochem.

&lt;!-- Epidemiology, prognosis, and history --&gt;
[[Outbreak]]s of methanol poisoning have occurred due to contamination of [[Ethanol|drinking alcohol]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=EM2016/&gt; --&gt; This is more common in the [[developing world]].&lt;ref name=EM2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beauchamp|first1=GA|last2=Valento|first2=M|title=Toxic Alcohol Ingestion: Prompt Recognition And Management In The Emergency Department|journal=Emergency Medicine Practice|date=September 2016|volume=18|issue=9|pages=1–20|pmid=27538060}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 more than 1700 cases occurred in the United States.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Fer2016/&gt; --&gt; Those affected are often adult men.&lt;ref name=Fer2016&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ferri|first1=Fred F.|title=Ferri's Clinical Advisor 2017: 5 Books in 1|date=2016|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9780323448383|page=794|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=rRhCDAAAQBAJ|page=794}}|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outcomes may be good with early treatment.&lt;ref name=Kr2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kruse|first1=JA|title=Methanol and ethylene glycol intoxication|journal=Critical Care Clinics|date=October 2012|volume=28|issue=4|pages=661–711|pmid=22998995|doi=10.1016/j.ccc.2012.07.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toxicity to methanol was described as early as 1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clary|first1=John J.|title=The Toxicology of Methanol|date=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118353103|page=3.4.1|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=xSs8oDQV4uYC&amp;|page=44}}|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its toxic properties, methanol is frequently used as a denaturant additive for ethanol manufactured for industrial uses. This addition of methanol exempts industrial ethanol (commonly known as "[[denatured alcohol]]" or "methylated spirit") from liquor [[Excise tax in the United States|excise taxation]] in the US and some other countries.

==Applications==
===Heavy chemicals: formaldehyde, acetic acid, methyl tert-butylether===
Methanol is primarily converted to [[formaldehyde]], which is widely used in many areas, especially polymers. The conversion entails oxidation:
:2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH  +  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   →   2 CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
[[Acetic acid]] can be produced from methanol.

Methanol and [[isobutene]] are combined to give [[methyl tert-butyl ether]] (MTBE). MTBE is a major octane booster in gasoline.

===Methanol to hydrocarbons, olefins, gasoline===
Condensation of methanol to produce [[hydrocarbon]]s and even [[aromatic hydrocarbon|aromatic]] systems is the basis of several technologies related to [[gas to liquids]]. These include methanol-to-hydrocarbons (MTH), methanol to gasoline (MTG), and methanol to olefins (MTO), and methanol to propylene (MTP).  These conversions are catalyzed by [[zeolite]]s as [[heterogeneous catalyst]]s. The MTG process was once commercialized at [[Motunui]] in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Olsbye, U.; Svelle, S.; Bjorgen, M.; Beato, P.; Janssens, T. V.

===Gasoline additive===
The [[European Fuel Quality Directive]] allows up to 3% methanol with an equal amount of cosolvent to be blended with gasoline sold in Europe. [[China]] uses more than one billion gallons of methanol per year as a transportation fuel in low level blends for conventional vehicles and high level blends in vehicles designed for methanol fuels.

===Other chemicals===
Methanol is the precursor to most simple [[methylamine]]s, methyl halides, methyl ethers.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2005|publisher=Wiley-VCH|location=Weinheim|doi=10.1002/14356007.a16_465|authors=E.

===Niche and potential uses===
====Energy carrier====
Methanol is a promising [[energy carrier]] because, as a liquid, it is easier to store than hydrogen and natural gas.  Its [[energy density]] is however low reflecting the fact that it represents partially combusted methane.  Its energy density is 15.6 [[joule|MJ]]/[[liter|L]], whereas ethanol's is 24 and gasoline's is 33 MJ/L.

Further advantages for methanol is its ready biodegradability and low toxicity. It does not persist in either aerobic (oxygen-present) or anaerobic (oxygen-absent) environments. The half-life for methanol in groundwater is just one to seven days, while many common gasoline components have half-lives in the hundreds of days (such as [[benzene]] at 10–730 days). Since methanol is [[miscibility|miscible]] with water and biodegradable, it is unlikely to accumulate in groundwater, surface water, air or soil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.methanol.org/Environment/Resources/Environment/MP-Methanol-Fate.aspx Evaluation of the Fate and Transport of Methanol in the Environment] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160516022250/http://www.methanol.org/Environment/Resources/Environment/MP-Methanol-Fate.aspx |date=16 May 2016 }}, Malcolm Pirnie, Inc., January 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fuel for vehicles====
{{Main|Methanol fuel|methanol economy}}
Methanol is occasionally used to fuel [[internal combustion engine]]s. It burns forming carbon dioxide and water:
: 2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
One problem with high concentrations of methanol in fuel is that alcohols [[corrosion|corrode]] some metals, particularly [[aluminium]]. Methanol fuel has been proposed for ground transportation. The chief advantage of a methanol economy is that it could be adapted to gasoline internal combustion engines with minimum modification to the engines and to the infrastructure that delivers and stores liquid fuel.  Its energy density is however only half that of gasoline, meaning that twice the volume of methanol would be required.

====Other applications====
Methanol is a traditional denaturant for ethanol, the product being known as "[[denatured alcohol]]" or "methylated spirit". This was commonly used during the [[Prohibition]] to discourage consumption of [[Moonshine|bootleg]]ged liquor, and ended up causing several deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blum |first=Deborah |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2245188/ |title=The little-told story of how the U.S. government poisoned alcohol during Prohibition|website= Slate Magazine |date=19 February 2010 |accessdate=10 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methanol is used as a [[solvent]] and as an [[antifreeze (coolant)|antifreeze]] in [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] and [[windshield washer fluid]].  Methanol was used as an automobile coolant antifreeze in the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ie50257a020| title = Methanol Antifreeze and Methanol Poisoning| journal = Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry| volume = 23| issue = 5| page = 551| year = 1931| last1 = Yant | first1 = W. P.| last2 = Schrenk | first2 = H. H.| last3 = Sayers | first3 = R. R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of May 2018, methanol was banned in the EU for use in windscreen washing or defrosting due to its risk of human consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32018R0589|title=EUR-Lex - 32018R0589 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment plants]], a small amount of methanol is added to [[wastewater]] to provide a carbon food source for the [[denitrifying bacteria]], which convert [[nitrate]]s to [[nitrogen]] gas and reduce the nitrification of sensitive [[aquifer]]s.

Methanol is used as a destaining agent in [[polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis]].

[[Direct-methanol fuel cell]]s are unique in their low temperature, atmospheric pressure operation, allowing them to be miniaturized to an unprecedented degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kamitani | first1 = A. | last2 = Morishita | first2 = S. | last3 = Kotaki | first3 = H. | last4 = Arscott | first4 = S. | title = Miniaturized microDMFC using silicon microsystems techniques: Performances at low fuel flow rates | doi = 10.1088/0960-1317/18/12/125019 | journal = Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering | volume = 18 | issue = 12 | page = 125019 | year = 2008 | pmid = | pmc = | bibcode = 2008JMiMi..18l5019K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kamitani | first1 = A. | last2 = Morishita | first2 = S. | last3 = Kotaki | first3 = H. | last4 = Arscott | first4 = S. | title = Microfabricated microfluidic fuel cells | doi = 10.1016/j.snb.2009.11.014 | journal = Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical | volume = 154 | issue = 2 | page = 174 | year = 2011 | pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This, combined with the relatively easy and safe storage and handling of methanol, may open the possibility of fuel cell-powered [[consumer electronics]], such as laptop computers and mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compukiss.com/populartopics/tech_gadgetshtm/article887.htm|title=Methanol Laptop Fuel|author=Berger, Sandy |publisher=Compu·Kiss|date=30 September 2006|accessdate=22 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methanol is also a widely used fuel in camping and boating stoves. Methanol burns well in an unpressurized burner, so alcohol stoves are often very simple, sometimes little more than a cup to hold fuel. This lack of complexity makes them a favorite of hikers who spend extended time in the wilderness.  Similarly, the alcohol can be gelled to reduce risk of leaking or spilling, as with the brand "[[Sterno]]".

Methanol is mixed with water and injected into high performance diesel and gasoline engines for an increase of power and a decrease in intake air temperature in a process known as [[Water injection (engines)|water methanol injection]].

==Production==

===From synthesis gas===
Carbon monoxide and hydrogen react over a catalyst to produce methanol. Today, the most widely used catalyst is a mixture of copper and [[zinc oxide]]s, [[catalyst support|supported]] on alumina, as first used by [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] in 1966. At 5–10 MPa (50–100&amp;nbsp;atm) and {{convert|250|C}}, the reaction is characterized by high selectivity (&gt;99.8%):

:CO + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH

The production of synthesis gas from methane produces three [[Mole (unit)|mole]]s of hydrogen for every mole of carbon monoxide, whereas the synthesis consumes only two moles of hydrogen gas per mole of carbon monoxide. One way of dealing with the excess hydrogen is to inject [[carbon dioxide]] into the methanol synthesis reactor, where it, too, reacts to form methanol according to the equation:

:CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   →   CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

In terms of mechanism, the process occurs via initial conversion of CO into CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is then [[hydrogenation|hydrogenated]]:&lt;ref&gt;Olaf Deutschmann, Helmut Knözinger, Karl Kochloefl, Thomas Turek "Heterogeneous Catalysis and Solid Catalysts, 3. Industrial Applications" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'' 2012, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.o05_o03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
where the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O byproduct is recycled via the [[water gas shift reaction|water-gas shift reaction]]
:CO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,
This gives an overall reaction, which is the same as listed above.
:CO + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH

===Biosynthesis===
The catalytic conversion of methane to methanol is effected by enzymes including [[methane monooxygenase]]s.  These enzymes are mixed-function oxygenases, i.e. oxygenation is coupled with production of water:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mechanistic Studies on the Hydroxylation of Methane by Methane Monooxygenase|authors=Mu-Hyun Baik, Martin Newcomb, Richard A. Friesner, Stephen J. Lippard|journal=Chem. Rev.|year=2003|volume=103|issue=6|pages=2385–2420|doi=10.1021/cr950244f|pmid=12797835}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  NADPH  +  H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  →  CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  +  NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

==Quality specifications and analysis==
Methanol is available commercially in various purity grades.  Commercial methanol is generally classified according to ASTM purity grades A and AA. Methanol for chemical use normally corresponds to Grade AA. In addition to water, typical impurities include acetone and ethanol (which are very difficult to separate by distillation). UV-vis spectroscopy is a convenient method for detecting aromatic impurities. Water content can be determined by the [[Karl-Fischer titration]].

==History==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Methyl group]] --&gt;
In their [[embalming]] process, the [[ancient Egyptians]] used a mixture of substances, including methanol, which they obtained from the [[pyrolysis]] of wood. Pure methanol, however, was first isolated in 1661 by [[Robert Boyle]], when he produced it via the distillation of [[buxus]] (boxwood).&lt;ref&gt;Boyle discusses the distillation of liquids from the wood of the box shrub in:  Robert Boyle, ''The Sceptical Chymist'' (London, England:  J. Cadwell, 1661), [https://archive.org/stream/scepticalchymis00BoylA#page/192/mode/2up/ pp. 192–195].&lt;/ref&gt; It later became known as "pyroxylic spirit". In 1834, the French chemists [[Jean-Baptiste Dumas]] and [[Eugene Peligot]] determined its elemental composition.&lt;ref name=Dumas&gt;A report on methanol to the French Academy of Sciences by J. Dumas and E. Péligot began during the Academy's meeting of 27 October 1834 and finished during the meeting of 3 November 1834.  See:  ''Procès-verbaux des séances de l'Académie'', '''10''' :  600–601.  Available on:  [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k33037/f606.image Gallica].  The complete report appears in:  J.

They also introduced the word "methylène" to organic chemistry, forming it from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''methy'' = "alcoholic liquid" + ''hȳlē'' = "woodland, forest", with a Greek language error: ''xylon'' = "wood as a material" would have been more suitable. "Methylène" designated a [[Radical theory|"radical"]] that was about 14% hydrogen by weight and contained one carbon atom. This would be CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but at the time carbon was thought to have an [[atomic weight]] only six times that of hydrogen, so they gave the formula as CH.&lt;ref name=Dumas/&gt; They then called wood alcohol (l'esprit de bois) "bihydrate de méthylène" (bihydrate because they thought the formula was C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = (CH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The term "methyl" was derived in about 1840 by [[back-formation]] from "methylene", and was then applied to describe "methyl alcohol". This was shortened to "methanol" in 1892 by the [[IUPAC nomenclature|International Conference on Chemical Nomenclature]].&lt;ref&gt;For a report on the International Conference on Chemical Nomenclature that was held in April 1892 in Geneva, Switzerland, see:
*  {{cite journal|doi=10.1038/046056c0|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=LHkCAAAAIAAJ|page=5}}|title=The International Conference on Chemical Nomenclature|journal=Nature|volume=46|issue=1177|pages=56–9|last=Armstrong|first= Henry E|year=1892|bibcode=1892Natur..46...56A}}
*  Armstrong's report is reprinted with the resolutions in English in: {{cite journal|author= Armstrong, Henry |year=1892|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=RogMAQAAIAAJ|page=398}}|title=The International Conference on Chemical Nomenclature|journal=The Journal of Analytical and Applied Chemistry|volume=6|issue=1177|pages=390–400|quote=p. 398: 15. The alcohols and the phenols will be called after the name of the hydrocarbon from which they are derived, terminated with the suffix ''ol'' (ex. pentanol, pentenol, etc.). |bibcode=1892Natur..46...56A|doi=10.1038/046056c0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[suffix (linguistics)|suffix]] [[-yl]] used in [[organic chemistry]] to form names of [[carbon]] groups, was extracted from the word "methyl".

In 1923, the German chemists [[Alwin Mittasch]] and Mathias Pier, working for [[BASF|Badische-Anilin &amp; Soda-Fabrik]] (BASF), developed a means to convert [[syngas|synthesis gas]] (a mixture of [[carbon monoxide]], [[carbon dioxide]], and [[hydrogen]]) into methanol. US patent 1,569,775 ({{patent|US|1569775}}) was applied for on 4 Sep 1924 and issued on 12 January 1926; the process used a [[chromium]] and [[manganese oxide]] [[catalyst]] with extremely vigorous conditions: pressures ranging from 50 to 220 [[atmosphere (unit)|atm]], and temperatures up to 450&amp;nbsp;°C. Modern methanol production has been made more efficient through use of catalysts (commonly copper) capable of operating at lower pressures. The modern low pressure methanol (LPM) process was developed by [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] in the late 1960s {{patent|US|3326956}} with the technology now owned by [[Johnson Matthey]], which is a leading licensor of methanol technology.

During [[World War II]], methanol was used as a fuel in several German military rocket designs, under the name M-Stoff, and in a roughly 50/50 mixture with [[hydrazine]], known as [[C-Stoff]].

The use of methanol as a motor fuel received attention during the [[1970s energy crisis|oil crises of the 1970s]]. By the mid-1990s, over 20,000 methanol "[[flexible fuel vehicle]]s" capable of operating on methanol or gasoline were introduced in the U.S. In addition, low levels of methanol were blended in gasoline fuels sold in Europe during much of the 1980s and early-1990s. Automakers stopped building methanol FFVs by the late-1990s, switching their attention to ethanol-fueled vehicles. While the methanol FFV program was a technical success, rising methanol pricing in the mid- to late-1990s during a period of slumping gasoline pump prices diminished interest in methanol fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Halderman, James D. |author2=Martin, Tony |title=Hybrid and alternative fuel vehicles|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=LqgeAQAAIAAJ}}|year=2009|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-504414-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s, a process was developed by [[Mobil]] for [[Methanol to gasoline|producing gasoline]] fuel from methanol.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Between the 1960s and 1980s methanol emerged as a precursor to the feedstock chemicals [[acetic acid]] and [[acetic anhydride]].  These processes include the [[Monsanto acetic acid synthesis]], [[Cativa process]], and [[Monsanto process#Tennessee Eastman acetic anhydride process|Tennessee Eastman acetic anhydride process]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38147">The '''Official Women's Squash World Ranking''' is the official world ranking for women's [[Squash (sport)|squash]]. The ranking is to rate the performance level of female professional squash player. It is also a merit-based method used for determining entry and seeding in women's squash tournaments. The rankings are produced monthly.&lt;ref name="rank&amp;divisor"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://psaworldtour.com/squash/guides/20161005113420_PSATourRuleBook20162017.pdf |title=PSA Tour Rule Book |publisher=PSA |page=41 |accessdate=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current world number one is [[Nour El Sherbini]] of Egypt, who replaced [[Laura Massaro]] in May 2016.

==PSA Ranking Policy==
Players competing in PSA tournaments earn ranking points according to how far they get in the draw. The points available depend on the prize money and the draw size. The monthly rankings (issued on the 1st of the month) are used in selecting entries to tournaments and in determining the seeds.

The total number of points a player earns in a year (52 weeks) is divided by the number of tournaments played (a minimum of eight are required) to give a ranking average. Where a player has played more than 8 tournaments the best scores may be selected (i.e., the lowest are not included).

For example, a player who has competed in 13 events will have selected her best 10 scores, which will be accumulated and divided by 10.

Players competing in [[Professional Squash Association|PSA World Tour]] Events earn ranking points according to the prize money, classification of the event, and the final position in the draw the player reaches.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7992">An '''Olszewski tube''' is a pipe designed to bring oxygen-poor water from the bottom of a lake to the top. This tube was first proposed by a Polish [[limnologist]] named Olszewski in 1961 and helps combat the negative effects of [[eutrophication]], high nutrient content, in lakes. The basic concept behind the Olszewski tube is the reduction of nutrient concentration and [[destratification]]; the more specific goal is [[hypolimnetic withdrawal]].&lt;ref name=Butusov&gt;Butusov, Mikhail, and Arne Jernelöv. Phosphorus: An Element That Could Have Been Called Lucifer. New York: Springer, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eutrophication ==
When nutrients build up in a lake, eutrophication occurs, and this generally occurs in the top layer of a lake. The nutrients come both naturally and artificially and usually contain [[phosphates]]. The artificial nutrients can come from sewage and fertilizers, from [[agricultural runoff]]. [[Phosphorus]] from the phosphates causes algae to grow rapidly and spread throughout the top layer of the lake. [[Algal blooms]] have negative effects on both the [[aesthetics]] and the [[ecology]] of the lake. Aesthetically, the lake is not pleasing because it is covered with algae. Ecologically, eutrophication causes organisms in the lake to die because the algae deplete the [[dissolved oxygen]] in the lake.&lt;ref name=Cooke&gt;Cooke, G. Dennis. Restoration and Management of Lakes and Reservoirs. Boca Raton, FL: CRC, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
[[File:Olszewski_Tube.svg|thumb|alt=Schematized cutaway view (elevation) of a lake, once without (upper illustration) and once with (below) Olszewski tube, to illustrate the functional principle of the Olszewski tube: The upper picture shows on the basis of the schematically outlined water flow that the main flow leads from the inflow to the outflow, only little mixing takes place with the deeper layers of water and thus mainly water near the surface flows off the lake. The lower picture shows the same lake, but with a outlet barrier and an installed Olszewski tube, the upper end of which passes through the barrier into the outlet and the lower end of which is at the lowest point of the lake. The outlined water flow illustrates that the inflowing water is now forced to advance into deeper layers of water and thus deep water is transported into the lower end of the Olszewski tube. This deep water is directed through the Olszewski pipe into the outlet.|Working principle of an Olszewski tube (below)]]

At the most simple level, the Olszewski tube is a pipe that spans from the bottom, [[hypolimnetic]] layer of the lake to the outlet. The outlet part of the pipe is installed under lake level in order for the device to act as a [[siphon]]. Once warm water flows in the lake at the surface, it forces the cold [[Anoxic waters|anoxic water]] of the hypolimnetic layer through and up the tube. This oxygen-poor water is then brought to the top of the lake where the eutrophication occurs. This eventually helps the lake as a whole because the bottom of the lake will have more dissolved oxygen and the top of the lake will have less eutrophication.&lt;ref name=Welch&gt;Welch, E. B., and T. Lindell. Ecological Effects of Waste Water. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1980. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementations ==
The first implementation of the Olszewski tube was attempted at [[Lake Kortowo]] in [[Poland]] and this led to [[oligotrophication]], reduction of nutrient cycling. This tube has shown the most promise in a 3.9 meter deep eutrophic lake in [[Switzerland]] because the phosphorus and [[nitrogen]] levels in the summer drastically decreased, oxygen levels increased, and the amount of [[cyanobacteria]] decreased from 152 grams per square meter to 41 grams per square meter. It has also been reported by a scientist named Bjork that there have been successes with the Olszewski tube in European lakes. Other limnologists like Pechlaner and Gachter have reported successes in small lakes where the total phosphorus decreased, [[Transparency and translucency|transparency]] of water increased, and less algae was present.&lt;ref name=Lake&gt;Lake Restoration, Protection, and Management: Proceedings of the Second Annual Conference, North American Lake Management Society, October 26–29, 1982, Vancouver, British Columbia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sullivan&gt;O'Sullivan, P. E., and Colin S. Reynolds. The Lakes Handbook. N.p.: n.p., 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Complications ==
Some complications that can arise with the use of an Olszewski tube include disruption of the [[thermocline]] and excessive water loss. The thermocline separates the upper layer of water that is mixed temperatures with the deeper, cooler water. If the thermocline is disrupted, it could alter the ecology of the lake, potentially making it uninhabitable. Another complication is that the installation must be a long-term process. Short-term uses of Olszewski tubes have largely failed because it takes some time for the anoxic condition of the hypolimnetic layer to increase in dissolved oxygen. Also, it must be a slow process in order to avoid disrupting the thermocline in a lake. If the Olszewski tube is operated slowly enough, the rate of water going in and going out will be fairly constant causing the thermocline to stay intact.&lt;ref name=Butusov /&gt;

== Cost ==
One advantage to hypolimnetic withdrawal is that it is relatively inexpensive to install an Olszewski tube or any similar device. Along with low initial cost, it also has a relatively low annual maintenance cost. The following are four systems installed in the United States (2002), their area in [[hectares]], the rate of flow in cube-meters per minute, and their initial installation costs in US dollars:&lt;ref name=Cooke /&gt;

$282,000

== Other Techniques ==
Aside from using an Olszewski tube and hypolimnetic withdrawal, there are other techniques implemented to achieve the same goals as an Olszewski tube. These include increasing dissolved oxygen, reducing nutrient concentration, and lessening the amount of algae and unwanted [[biomass]] in lakes.
* [[Sediment oxidation]] is the artificial [[oxidation]] of the top 15 to 20 centimeters of anaerobic lake sediment. This technique reduces internal nutrient release through a series of [[chemical reactions]] starting with [[iron(III) chloride]]. After these reactions, the concentrations of phosphorus and [[ammonium]] (another nutrient found in lakes) decrease and the demand for oxygen gas in reduced as well. This technique is still not fully developed yet but can mirror the effects of the Olszewski tube.
* [[Biological control]] methods are the most promising techniques because they do the least harm to the ecosystem. These methods introduce a particular species (e.g. fish, bacteria, etc.) into a lake as a solution to a current problem. The introduction of a certain type of bacteria can help decrease nutrients. In turn the algae will not spread and the oxygen in the lake will stay in high dissolved concentrations. 
* [[Hypolimnetic aeration]] is another technique in which oxygen is added to the lake. This helps increase the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the lake as well as bring down the levels of phosphorus. While the results of this technique are similar to those of the Olszewski tube, hypolimnetic aeration differs in that it uses [[compressed air]] to move the water rather than a [[siphoning effect]].&lt;ref name=Lake /&gt;

[[File:A Day of Night-Shining Clouds.png|thumb|250px|Image of polar mesospheric clouds taken on 10 July 2007 by OMI]]
The '''ozone monitoring instrument''' ('''OMI''') is a visual and ultraviolet spectrometer aboard the [[NASA]] [[Aura (satellite)|Aura]] spacecraft. OMI can distinguish between aerosol types, such as smoke, dust, and [[sulfate]]s, and can measure cloud pressure and coverage, which provide data to derive [[tropospheric ozone]]. OMI follows in the heritage of [[Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer|TOMS]], SBUV, GOME, [[SCIAMACHY]], and [[GOMOS]]. It is a wide-field-imaging spectrometer with a 114° across-track viewing angle range that provides a 2600&amp;nbsp;km wide swath, enabling measurements with a daily global coverage. OMI is continuing the TOMS record for total ozone and other atmospheric parameters related to ozone chemistry and climate.

The OMI project is a cooperation between the [[Netherlands Agency for Aerospace Programmes]] (NIVR), the [[Finnish Meteorological Institute]] (FMI) and the National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA).

The OMI project was carried out under the direction of the NIVR and financed by the Ministries of Economic Affairs, Transport and Public Works and the Ministry of Education and Science. The instrument was built by Dutch Space in co-operation with [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research]] Science and Industry and [[Netherlands Institute for Space Research]]. The Finnish industry supplied the electronics. The scientific part of the OMI project is managed by [[Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute|KNMI]] (principal investigator Prof. Dr. P. F. Levelt), in close co-operation with NASA and the Finnish Meteorological Institute.

A '''polynya''' {{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|l|ɪ|n|j|ə}} is an area of open water surrounded by [[sea ice]].&lt;ref&gt;W.J. Stringer and J.E. Groves. 1991. [http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic44-S-164.pdf ''Extent of Polynyas in the Bering and Chukchi Seas'']&lt;/ref&gt; It is now used as geographical term for an area of unfrozen sea within the ice pack. It is a [[loanword]] from {{lang-ru|полынья}} (polynya) {{IPA-ru|pəɫɨˈnʲja}}, which refers to a natural ice hole, and was adopted in the 19th century by polar explorers to describe navigable portions of the sea.&lt;ref&gt;Sherard Osborn, Peter Wells and A. Petermann. 1866. ''Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society of Australia'', Vol 12 no 2 1867–1868 pp 92–113 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1799584 On the Exploration of the North Polar Region]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/polynya?show=0&amp;t=1283765336 polynya], Merriam Webster Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; In past decades, for example, some polynyas, such as the [[Weddell Polynya]], have lasted over multiple winters (1974–1976).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca/ANTARCTIC/weddell_polynya.html Weddell Polynya], NASA, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation ==
Polynyas are formed through two main processes:

* '''Sensible heat polynya''': this is thermodynamically driven, and typically occurs when warm water [[upwelling]] keeps the surface water temperature at or above the [[freezing point]]. This reduces ice production and may stop it altogether.
* '''Latent heat polynya''': is formed through the action of [[katabatic wind]] or [[ocean current]]s which act to drive ice away from a fixed boundary, such as a [[coastline]], [[fast ice]], or an [[ice bridge]]. The polynya forms initially by the first year [[pack ice]] being driven away from the coast, which leaves an area of open water within which new ice is formed. This new ice is then also herded downwind toward the first year pack ice. When it reaches the pack ice the new ice is consolidated onto the pack ice. This process continues over time, thus naming the latent heat polynyas as a major source of sea ice production in the Antarctic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skogseth|first=R.|last2=Haugan|first2=P. M.|last3=Haarpaintner|first3=J.|date=2004-10-01|title=Ice and brine production in Storfjorden from four winters of satellite and in situ observations and modeling|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2004JC002384/abstract|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans|language=en|volume=109|issue=C10|pages=C10008|doi=10.1029/2004jc002384|issn=2156-2202|bibcode=2004JGRC..10910008S}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latent heat polynya is the open water region between the coast and the ice pack.

Latent heat polynyas are regions of high ice production and therefore are possible sites of dense water production in both [[polar region]]s. The high ice production rates within these polynyas leads to a large amount of brine rejection into the surface waters. This salty water then sinks. It is an open question as to whether the polynyas of the [[Arctic]] can produce enough dense water to form a major portion of the dense water required to drive the [[thermohaline circulation]].

== Ecology ==

Some polynyas, such as the [[North Water Polynya]] between [[Canada]] and [[Greenland]] occur seasonally at the same time and place each year. Because animals can adapt their life strategies to this regularity, these types of polynyas are of special ecological research significance. In winter, [[marine mammal]]s such as [[walrus]]es, [[narwhal]]s and [[Beluga (whale)|belugas]] that do not migrate south, remain there. In spring, the thin or absent ice cover allows light in, through the surface layer as soon as the winter night ends, which triggers the early blooming of [[microalgae]] that are at the basis of the marine food chain. So, polynyas are suspected to be places where intense and early production of the [[Zooplankton|planktonic herbivore]]s ensure the transfer of solar energy ([[food chain]]) fixed by planktonic microalgae to [[Arctic cod]], [[Pinniped|seals]], [[whale]]s, and [[polar bear]]s. Polar bears are known to be able to swim as far as 65 kilometres across open waters of a polynya.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2008 [http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=36084 ''Polar Bear: Ursus maritimus'', Globaltwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224205716/http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=36084 |date=2008-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of polynyas in [[McMurdo Sound]] in the [[Antarctic]] provides an ice-free area where penguins can feed, thus they are important for the survival of the [[Cape Royds]] penguin colony.&lt;ref&gt;

== Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) ==
Antarctic Bottom Water is the dense water with high salinity that exists in the abyssal layer of the [[Southern Ocean]] and it plays a major role in the global overturning circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Gregory C.|date=2008-05-01|title=Quantifying Antarctic Bottom Water and North Atlantic Deep Water volumes|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2007JC004477/abstract|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans|language=en|volume=113|issue=C5|pages=C05027|doi=10.1029/2007jc004477|issn=2156-2202|bibcode=2008JGRC..113.5027J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coastal Polynyas (Latent heat polynyas) are a source of AABW as brine rejection during the formation of sea ice at these polynyas increase the salinity of the sea water which then sinks down to the ocean bottom as AABW.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tamura|first=Takeshi|last2=Ohshima|first2=Kay I.|last3=Nihashi|first3=Sohey|date=2008-04-01|title=Mapping of sea ice production for Antarctic coastal polynyas|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2007GL032903/abstract|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|language=en|volume=35|issue=7|pages=L07606|doi=10.1029/2007gl032903|issn=1944-8007|bibcode=2008GeoRL..35.7606T}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ohshima|first=Kay I.|last2=Fukamachi|first2=Yasushi|last3=Williams|first3=Guy D.|last4=Nihashi|first4=Sohey|last5=Roquet|first5=Fabien|last6=Kitade|first6=Yujiro|last7=Tamura|first7=Takeshi|last8=Hirano|first8=Daisuke|last9=Herraiz-Borreguero|first9=Laura|title=Antarctic Bottom Water production by intense sea-ice formation in the Cape Darnley polynya|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ngeo1738|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=6|issue=3|pages=235–240|doi=10.1038/ngeo1738|bibcode=2013NatGe...6..235O}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antarctic polynyas form when ice masses diverge from the coast and move away in the direction of the wind; creating an exposed area of sea water which subsequently freezes over, with brine rejection, to form another mass of ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ohshima|first=Kay I.|last2=Fukamachi|first2=Yasushi|last3=Williams|first3=Guy D.|last4=Nihashi|first4=Sohey|last5=Roquet|first5=Fabien|last6=Kitade|first6=Yujiro|last7=Tamura|first7=Takeshi|last8=Hirano|first8=Daisuke|last9=Herraiz-Borreguero|first9=Laura|title=Antarctic Bottom Water production by intense sea-ice formation in the Cape Darnley polynya|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ngeo1738|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=6|issue=3|pages=235–240|doi=10.1038/ngeo1738|bibcode=2013NatGe...6..235O}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arctic navigation==
{{further|Arctic sea ice decline}}
When submarines of the U.S. Navy made expeditions to the [[North Pole]] in the 1950s and 60s, there was a significant concern about surfacing through the thick [[pack ice]] of the Arctic Ocean. In 1962, both the [[USS Skate (SSN-578)|USS ''Skate'']] and [[USS Seadragon (SSN-584)|USS ''Seadragon'']] surfaced within the same, large polynya near the [[North Pole]], for the first polar rendezvous of the [[U.S. Atlantic Fleet]] and the [[U.S. Pacific Fleet]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yoEb9xtLv00C ''Tales of a Cold War Submariner''] by Dan Summitt, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Seven Wonders of Canada''' was a 2007 competition sponsored by [[CBC Television]]'s ''[[CBC News: The National|The National]]'' and [[CBC Radio One]]'s ''[[Sounds Like Canada]]''. They sought to determine Canada's "seven wonders" by receiving nominations from viewers, and then from on-line voting of the short list. After the vote, a panel of judges, [[Ra McGuire]], Roy MacGregor and Roberta L. Jamieson, picked the winners based on geographic and poetic criteria. Their seven picks were revealed on ''[[CBC News: The National|The National]]'' on June 7, 2007. The Seven Wonders as chosen by Canada were the Sleeping Giant, Niagara Falls, the Bay of Fundy, Nahanni National Park Reserve, the Northern Lights, the Rockies, and the Cabot Trail.

The genus ''[[Drosera]]'' was divided in 1994 by Seine &amp; Barthlott into three [[subgenus|subgenera]] and 11 [[section (botany)|sections]] on the basis of [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] characteristics.

Discovery and description of new species has been occurring since the 10th century, and as recently as the 1940s barely more than 80 species were known. In recent years, Australian [[Allen Lowrie]] has done extensive work in the genus, particularly in describing numerous new species from [[Australia]]. His classification of the genus was replaced by Jan Schlauer's work in 1996, although the correct classification is still disputed.

'''Teak'''  (''Tectona grandis'') is a [[tropics|tropical]] [[hardwood]] tree species placed in the [[flowering plant]] family [[Lamiaceae]]. ''Tectona grandis'' is a large, [[deciduous]] tree that occurs in mixed hardwood forests. It has small, fragrant white flowers and large papery leaves that are often hairy on the lower surface. It is sometimes known as the "Burmese teak". Teak wood has a leather-like smell when it is freshly milled. It is particularly valued for its durability and water resistance, and is used for boat building, exterior construction, veneer, furniture, carving, turnings, and other small wood projects.&lt;ref name=GRIN&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/genus.pl?11908 | title = GRIN Taxonomy for Plants - ''Tectona'' | publisher = [[United States Department of Agriculture]]|date=5 October 2007|accessdate=22 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tectona grandis'' is native to [[South Asia|south]] and [[Southeast Asia|southeast]] [[Asia]], mainly [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Thailand]], [[Myanmar]] and [[Bangladesh]] but is naturalised and cultivated in many countries in [[Africa]] and the [[Caribbean]]. [[Myanmar]]'s teak forests account for nearly half of the world's naturally occurring teak.&lt;ref name="Burmese Teak: Turning a new leaf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastbysoutheast.com/burmese-teak-turning-a-new-leaf/|title=Burmese Teak: Turning a new leaf|author=William Feinberg|publisher=East By South East|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Molecular studies show that there are two centres of genetic origin of teak; one in India and the other in Myanmar and Laos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verhaegen|first1=D.|first2=Inza Jesus|last2=Fofana|first3=Zénor A|last3=Logossa|first4=Daniel|last4=Ofori|title=What is the genetic origin of teak (Tectona grandis L.) introduced in Africa and in Indonesia?|journal=Tree Genetics &amp; Genomes|volume=6|issue=5|pages=717–733|year=2010|doi=10.1007/s11295-010-0286-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Canadian Journal of Forest Research|year=2015|volume=45|issue=3|pages=297–306|title=AFLP markers for analysis of genetic diversity and structure of teak (Tectona grandis) in India|first1=Vivek|last1=Vaishnaw|first2=Naseer|last2=Mohammad|first3=Syed Arif|last3=Wali|first4=Randhir|last4=Kumar|first5=Shashi Bhushan|last5=Tripathi|first6=Madan Singh|last6=Negi|first7=Shamim Akhtar|last7=Ansari|doi=10.1139/cjfr-2014-0279}}&lt;/ref&gt; "CP teak" ("Central Province" teak) is a description of teak from the central states of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/ac773e/ac773e09.htm|title=Trade and Marketing|work=Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Nagpur teak" is another regional Indian teak. It produces small, white flowers arranged in dense clusters (panicles) at the end of the branches. Flowers contain both types of reproductive organs (perfect flowers).

The word teak comes from  [[Tamil language|Tamil]] ''tekku'' (தேக்கு), [[Malayalam]] ''thekku''  (തേക്ക്), [[Kannada language|Kannada]] ''tega'' (ತೇಗ) via the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''teca''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=teak|title=teak - Origin and meaning of teak by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plant is known in Sinhala as Thekka (තේක්ක) among the Sri Lankan people and ''Segun'' (সেগুন) in [[Bangladesh]] and [[West Bengal]].

== Description ==
Teak is a large, long, [[deciduous]] tree up to {{convert|40|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} tall with gray to grayish brown branches. These are mostly known for their finest quality wood. Leaves are [[leaf shape|ovate-elliptic]] to ovate, {{convert|15|-|45|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|8|-|23|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide, and are held on robust [[petiole (botany)|petioles]] which are {{convert|2|-|4|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long. [[Leaf margin]]s are entire.&lt;ref name="FOC"&gt;[http://efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&amp;taxon_id=200019434 ''Tectona grandis'']. ''Flora of China'' 17: 16.

Fragrant white flowers are borne on {{convert|25|-|40|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|30|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} wide [[panicle]]s from June to August. The [[corolla (botany)|corolla]] tube is 2.5–3&amp;nbsp;mm long with 2&amp;nbsp;mm wide obtuse lobes. ''Tectona grandis'' sets fruit from September to December; fruits are globose and 1.2-1.8&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter.&lt;ref name="FOC" /&gt; Flowers are weakly [[protandrous]] in that the [[anther]]s precede the [[stigma (botany)|stigma]] in maturity and pollen is shed within a few hours of the flower opening.&lt;ref name="Tangmitcharoen and Owens"&gt;Tangmitcharoen, S. and J.

== Botanical history ==
''Tectona grandis'' was first formally described by [[Carl Linnaeus the Younger]] in his 1782 work ''[[Supplementum Plantarum]]''.&lt;ref name=IPNI&gt;{{IPNI|id=864923-1|accessdate=17 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, [[Harold Norman Moldenke]] published new descriptions of four [[form (botany)|forms]] of this species in the journal ''[[Phytologia]]''. Moldenke described each form as varying slightly from the [[biological type|type specimen]]: ''T.&amp;nbsp;grandis'' f. ''canescens'' is distinguished from the type material by being densely [[wikt:canescent|canescent]], or covered in hairs, on the underside of the leaf, ''T.&amp;nbsp;grandis'' f. ''pilosula'' is distinct from the type material in the varying morphology of the leaf veins, ''T.&amp;nbsp;grandis'' f. ''punctata'' is only hairy on the larger veins on the underside of the leaf, and ''T.&amp;nbsp;grandis'' f. ''tomentella'' is noted for its dense yellowish [[wikt:tomentose|tomentose]] hairs on the lower surface of the leaf.&lt;ref name="Moldenke"&gt;Moldenke, H. N. 1975. [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/13038500 Notes on new and noteworthy plants. LXXVII.] ''Phytologia'', 31: 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution and habitat ==
''Tectona grandis'' is one of three species in the genus ''Tectona''. The other two species, ''[[Tectona hamiltoniana|T.&amp;nbsp;hamiltoniana]]'' and ''[[Tectona philippinensis|T.&amp;nbsp;philippinensis]]'', are [[endemism|endemics]] with relatively small native distributions in [[Myanmar]] and the [[Philippines]], respectively.&lt;ref name=Tewari&gt;Tewari, D. N. 1992. ''A monograph on teak (''Tectona grandis'' Linn.f.).'' International Book Distributors.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tectona&amp;nbsp;grandis'' is native to India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Myanmar, northern Thailand, and northwestern Laos.&lt;ref name="FOC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tangmitcharoen and Owens" /&gt;

''Tectona grandis'' is found in a variety of habitats and climatic conditions from arid areas with only 500&amp;nbsp;mm of rain per year to very moist forests with up to 5,000&amp;nbsp;mm of rain per year. Typically, though, the annual rainfall in areas where teak grows averages 1,250-1,650&amp;nbsp;mm with a 3-5 month dry season.&lt;ref name="Kaosa-ard"&gt;Kaosa-ard, A. 1981. Teak its natural distribution and related factors. ''Nat. His. Bull. Siam. Soc.'', 29: 55-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultivation ==
Teak's natural [[Vegetable oil|oil]]s make it useful in exposed locations, and make the timber termite and pest resistant.  Teak is durable even when not treated with oil or varnish. Timber cut from old teak trees was once believed to be more durable and harder than plantation grown teak. Studies have shown that plantation teak performs on par with old-growth teak in erosion rate, dimensional stability, warping, and surface checking, but is more susceptible to color change from UV exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url= http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/pdf2001/willi01d.pdf|last1= Williams|first1=R. Sam|last2=Miller|first2=Regis|year=2001|title=Characteristics of Ten Tropical Hardwoods from Certified Forests in Bolivia |journal=Wood and Fiber Science |volume=33|issue=4|pages=618–626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of commercially harvested teak is grown on teak plantations found in [[Indonesia]] and controlled by [[Perum Perhutani]] (a state owned forest enterprise) that manages the country's forests. The primary use of teak harvested in Indonesia is in the production of outdoor teak furniture for export. [[Nilambur]] in [[Kerala]], [[India]], is also a major producer of teak of fine quality, holds the world's oldest teak plantation.&lt;ref name="Teak Museum: Nalimbur"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kfri.org/html/k1000mus.htm |title=Teak Museum: Nilambur |author=KRFI.org |publisher=Web Archive |accessdate=20 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928001233/http://www.kfri.org/html/k1000mus.htm |archivedate=28 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teak consumption raises a number of environmental concerns, such as the disappearance of rare old-growth teak. However, its popularity has led to growth in sustainable plantation teak production throughout the seasonally dry tropics in [[forestry]] [[plantation]]s. The [[Forest Stewardship Council]] offers certification of sustainably grown and harvested teak products. Propagation of teak via tissue culture for plantation purposes is commercially viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timberplus.co.uk/teak/|title=Teak - TimberPlus Blog|date=7 July 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teak plantations were widely established in [[Equatorial Africa]] during the [[Colonial era]]. These timber resources, as well as the oil reserves, are at the heart of the current (2014) [[South Sudan#Economy|South Sudan]]ese conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africanarguments.org/2013/03/14/is-all-well-in-the-teak-forests-of-south-sudan-by-aly-verjee/|title=Is all well in the teak forests of South Sudan? – By Aly Verjee|date=14 March 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elmawood.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816023149/http://elmawood.com/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-08-16|title=Elma Wood|website=elmawood.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the world's teak is exported by [[Indonesia]] and [[Myanmar]]. There is also a rapidly growing plantation grown market in Central America ([[Costa Rica]]) and [[South America]]. With a depletion of remaining natural hectares of teak forests, a growth in plantations in Latin America is expected to rise.&lt;ref name="Investing in Teak: The Market"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.catf.lu/investing-in-catf/the-market/|title=Investing in Teak: The Market|author=Central American Timber Fund |publisher=Central American Timber Fund|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Hyblaea puera]]'', commonly known as the teak defoliator, is a [[moth]] native to southeast [[Asia]]. It is a teak pest whose [[caterpillar]] feeds on teak and other species of trees common in the region of southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;

== Uses ==
Teak's high oil content, high tensile strength and tight grain make it particularly suitable where weather resistance is desired. It is used in the manufacture of outdoor [[teak furniture|furniture]] and boat [[deck (ship)|deck]]s.  It is also used for [[cutting board]]s, indoor [[flooring]], [[countertop]]s and as a [[Wood veneer|veneer]] for indoor furnishings. Although easily worked, it can cause severe blunting on edged tools because of the presence of silica in the wood.  Over time teak can weather to a silvery-grey finish, especially when exposed to sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.williamsskiandpatio.com/page.cfm/patiocareguide.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222144154/http://www.williamsskiandpatio.com/page.cfm/patiocareguide.html |archivedate=22 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teak is used extensively in India to make doors and window frames, furniture, and columns and beams in old type houses. It is resistant to termite attacks and damage caused by other insects. Mature teak fetches a very good price. It is grown extensively by forest departments of different states in forest areas.

Leaves of the teak wood tree are used in making Pellakai gatti ([[jackfruit]] dumpling), where [[Batter (cooking)|batter]] is poured into a teak leaf and is steamed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teakhardwoods.com/teak|title=Teak: A Dwindling Natural Resource - Teak Hardwoods|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of usage is found in the coastal district of [[Udupi]] in the [[Tulunadu]] region in South [[India]]. The leaves are also used in [[gudeg]], a dish of young jackfruit made in [[Central Java]], [[Indonesia]], and give the dish its dark brown color.

Teak is used as a food plant by the [[larva]]e of [[moth]]s of the genus ''[[Endoclita]]'' including ''E. aroura'', ''E. chalybeatus'', ''E. damor'', ''E. gmelina'', ''E. malabaricus'', ''E. sericeus'' and ''E. signifer'' and other [[Lepidoptera]] including [[Turnip Moth]].

=== Boatbuilding ===
[[File:Teak Tree.JPG|thumb|Teak tree in [[Panchkhal]] valley in [[Nepal]]]]

Teak has been used as a boatbuilding material for over 2000 years (it was found in an archaeological dig in [[Berenice Panchrysos]], a port on the [[Indo-Roman trade relations|Indian Roman trade]]).&lt;ref&gt;Steven E. Sidebotham, Berenike and the Ancient Maritime Spice Route, Univ. of California Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to relatively high strength, teak is also highly resistant to rot,&lt;ref name="rot-citation"&gt;{{cite book|title=Yachting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0_xGugJddRQC&amp;pg=PA46|date=February 2004|pages=46–|issn=0043-9940}}&lt;/ref&gt; fungi and mildew. In addition, teak has a relatively low shrinkage ratio,&lt;ref name="Understanding Wood: A Craftsman’S Guide To Wood Technology - Chapter 6 pg.118"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5HBH2ibu-ZwC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=teak+shrinkage+ratio&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cnOLbIuiDf&amp;sig=geUOITwDDZVzsFOZUYjsWk1n4TU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=teak%20shrinkage%20ratio&amp;f=false|title= Understanding Wood: A Craftsman’S Guide To Wood Technology – Chapter 6 pg.118 |author=R. Bruce Hoadley|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes it excellent for applications where it undergoes periodic changes in moisture. Teak has the unusual properties of being both an excellent structural timber for framing, planking, etc., while at the same time being easily worked, unlike some other similar woods such as [[purpleheart]],&lt;ref name="Tangerman1973"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elmer John Tangerman|title=The Big Book of Whittling and Woodcarving|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9TbjAPdGoP0C&amp;pg=PA180|year=1973|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=978-0-486-26171-3|pages=180–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finished to a high degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=MotorBoating|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aFKnZv1sgrwC&amp;pg=PA38|date=April 1912|pages=38–|issn=1531-2623}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, it is also prized for the trim work on boat interiors. Due to the oily nature of the wood, care must be taken to properly prepare the wood before gluing.&lt;ref name="Magazines1985"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hearst Magazines|title=Popular Mechanics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YOQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA125|date=March 1985|publisher=Hearst Magazines|pages=125–|issn=0032-4558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When used on boats, teak is also very flexible in the finishes that may be applied. One option is to use no finish at all, in which case the wood will naturally weather to a pleasing silver-grey.&lt;ref name="Teak-wearing" /&gt; The wood may also be oiled with a finishing agent such as [[linseed oil|linseed]] or [[tung oil|tung]] oil.&lt;ref name="Spectre1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter H. Spectre|title=Painting &amp; Varnishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=39_3NAZduxAC&amp;pg=PA15|year=1995|publisher=WoodenBoat Books|isbn=978-0-937822-33-3|pages=15–}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in a pleasant, somewhat dull finish.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Finally, teak may also be varnished for a deep, lustrous glow.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Teak is also used extensively in boat [[Deck (ship)|decks]], as it is extremely durable and requires very little maintenance.  The teak tends to wear in to the softer 'summer' growth bands first, forming a natural 'non-slip' surface.&lt;ref name="Teak-wearing"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Woodenboat|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mmVWAAAAMAAJ|year=2001|publisher=J. J. Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any sanding is therefore only damaging. Use of modern cleaning compounds, oils or preservatives will shorten the life of the teak, as it contains natural teak-oil a very small distance below the white surface. Wooden boat experts will only wash the teak with salt water, and re-[[caulk]] when needed. This cleans the deck, and prevents it from drying out and the wood shrinking. The salt helps it absorb and retain moisture, and prevents any mildew and algal growth. Over-maintenance, such as cleaning teak with harsh chemicals, can shorten its usable lifespan as decking.&lt;ref name="rot-citation" /&gt;

== Alternatives to teak ==
Due to the increasing cost of teak, various alternatives have been employed. These include [[purpleheart]], [[iroko]], and [[Dicorynia guianensis|angelique]].

==Propagation==
[[File:Tree in new leaves (Tectona grandis) I IMG 8133.jpg|thumb|Tree in new leaves in [[Kolkata]], [[West Bengal]], [[India]].]]
Teak is propagated mainly from seeds. Germination of the seeds involves pretreatment to remove dormancy arising from the thick pericarp. Pretreatment involves alternate wetting and drying of the seed. The seeds are soaked in water for 12 hours and then spread to dry in the sun for 12 hours. This is repeated for 10–14 days and then the seeds are sown in shallow germination beds of coarse peat covered by sand. The seeds then germinate after 15 to 30 days.&lt;ref&gt;Kadambi, K. (1972). Silviculture and management of Teak. Bulletin 24 School of Forestry, Stephen F. Austin State University Nacogdoches, Texas&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Robertson (2002) Growing Teak in the Top End of the NT. Agnote. No. G26 [http://www.nt.gov.au/d/Content/File/p/General/812.pdf PDF] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226073253/http://www.nt.gov.au/d/Content/File/p/General/812.pdf |date=26 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clonal propagation of teak has been successfully done through grafting, rooted stem cuttings and micro propagation. While bud grafting on to seedling root stock has been the method used for establishing clonal seed orchards that enables assemblage of clones of the superior trees to encourage crossing, rooted stem cuttings and micro propagated plants are being increasingly used around the world for raising clonal plantations.&lt;ref name="Clonal Propagation of Teak (Tectona grandis linn.f."&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lap-publishing.com/catalog/details//store/gb/book/978-3-659-17205-2/clonal-propagation-of-teak-tectona-grandis-linn-f|title=Clonal Propagation of Teak (Tectona grandis linn.f.|author=Azamal Husen|publisher=LAP Lambert Academic Publishing|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== World's largest living teak tree ==

[[Ministry of Environmental Conservation and Forestry (Myanmar)]] found out two world biggest living teak on 28 August 2017 in [[Homalin Township]], [[Sagaing Region]], [[Myanmar]]. The biggest one, named Homemalynn 1, is {{Convert|27.5|ft|m}} in girth and {{convert|110|ft|m}} tall. The second biggest one, named Homemalynn 2, is {{Convert|27|ft|m}} in girth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/news/sagaing-region-may-be-home-worlds-largest-teak-tree.html|title=Sagaing Region may be home to world’s largest teak tree|author=Khin Su Wai|work=[[The Myanmar Times]]|date=5 September 2017|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, the world's biggest recorded teak tree was located within the [[Parambikulam Wildlife Sanctuary]] in the [[Palakkad District]] of [[Kerala]] in India, named [[Kannimara]]. The tree is approximately {{Convert|47.5|m|ft}} tall.

In 2017, a tree was discovered in the Ottakallan area of Thundathil range of Malayattoor Forest Division in Kerala with a girth of {{Convert|7.65|m|ft}} and height of {{Convert|40|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/2012/sep/17/mother-of-all-teak-trees-near-malayattoor--407052.html|title=Mother of all Teak trees near Malayattoor|work=The New Indian Express|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A teak tree in Kappayam, Edamalayar, Kerala which used to considered as the biggest, has a diameter of only 7.23 meters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==TEAKNET==
The International Teak Information Network (Teaknet) supported by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Regional office for Asia-Pacific, Bangkok, currently has its offices at the Kerala Forest Research Institute, Peechi, Thrissur, Kerala State in India. Teaknet is an international network of institutions and individuals interested in teak. Teaknet addresses the interests of all the categories of stakeholders related to teak, whether they are growers, traders, researchers or other groups with a profound interest or concerned with teak. From time to time, the organisation formulates action plans focusing on the short term and long term needs of the global teak sector. The TEAKNET website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teaknet.org|title=TEAKNET - Online Teak Resources and News - International Teak Information Network|website=www.teaknet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides information to  all those concerned with research, conservation, growing, management and utilisation of teak.

A '''tundra orbit''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Тундра) is a [[highly elliptical orbit|highly elliptical]] [[geosynchronous orbit]] with a high [[inclination]] (usually near 63.4°) and an [[orbital period]] of one [[sidereal day]].  A [[satellite]] placed in this orbit spends most of its time over a chosen area of the [[Earth]], a phenomenon known as [[Apsis|apogee dwell]]. The [[ground track]] of a satellite in a Tundra orbit is a closed figure-eight with a smaller loop over either the northern or southern hemisphere.  Tundra orbits have moderate [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]], typically between 0.2 and 0.3.  These orbits are conceptually similar to [[Molniya orbit]]s, which have the same inclination but half the period.&lt;ref name="fortescue"&gt;{{cite book

Until 2016, [[Sirius Satellite Radio]], now part of [[Sirius XM Holdings]], operated a [[satellite constellation|constellation]] of three satellites in Tundra orbits for [[satellite radio]].&lt;ref name="Sirius Launch"&gt;{{cite web

Two spacecraft in Tundra orbits are able to provide continuous coverage over an area.&lt;ref name="fortescue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jenkin"/&gt;

Tundra and Molniya orbits are used to provide high-[[latitude]] users with higher [[elevation (astronomy)|elevation]] angles than a geostationary orbit.  These orbits remain over their desired high-latitude regions for long periods of time due to their slow movement at apogee.&lt;ref name="fortescue"/&gt;  Neither the Tundra nor Molniya orbit is geostationary because that is possible only over the equator, so both orbits are elliptical to reduce the time that the satellite is away from its service area. An [[argument of perigee]] of 270° places apogee at the northernmost point of the orbit. An argument of perigee of 90° would likewise serve the high southern latitudes. An argument of perigee of 0° or 180° would cause the satellite to dwell over the equator, but there would be little point to this as this could be better done with a conventional [[geostationary orbit]].

The Tundra and Molniya orbits use a {{math|sin&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; {{radical|4/5}} ≈ 63.4°}} inclination to null the [[orbital perturbation analysis (spacecraft)|secular perturbation]] of the argument of perigee caused by the Earth's equatorial bulge. With any inclination other than 63.4° or its supplement, 116.6°, the argument of perigee would change steadily over time, and apogee would occur either before or after the highest latitude is reached.&lt;ref name="fortescue"/&gt;

'''The Western Front Association''' (WFA) was inaugurated on 11 November 1980, in order to further interest in [[World War I|The Great War]] of 1914-1918. The WFA aims to perpetuate the memory, courage and comradeship of all those who fought on all sides and who served their countries during The Great War. The Western Front Association does not seek to justify or glorify war. It is not a re-enactment society, nor is it commercially motivated. It is entirely non-political. The object of the Association is to educate the public in the history of The Great War with particular reference to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].

The WFA was established by military historian John Giles, who enlisted the help of [[John Terraine]], who had co-written the landmark television series [[The Great War (documentary)|The Great War]], which was first broadcast in 1964. Giles was driven to form The Western Front Association as a result of the creation of such groups as 'The Gallipoli Association' which had been established in 1969, and - in the early 1970s - the 'Waterloo Association' which had been set up to save the old battlefield. It was in this context, over the following years, that John Giles developed the idea for an association on the First World War with its emphasis on the Western Front. It would be, John Giles was clear,  "The Western Front" and not, in his words about "Salonica or Naval battles" - the definitive article 'The' was also stipulated. And thus in November 1980 The Western Front Association was established.

Since its foundation the WFA has grown over the years to in excess of 6,000 members worldwide. There are around 60 branches in the UK, Europe, USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

The WFA is a UK registered charity, numbered 298365.

==Web site==
The website of the Western Front Association contains articles on The Great War. One of the sections of the website is a "For Schools" section which has educational resources for teachers and students.

==Branches==
With nearly sixty branches worldwide, including fifty in the UK and Ireland, the association has a representation in most counties in the UK and in most of 'main combatant' countries which took part in the Great War. Membership of the WFA is not a requisite to attend branch meetings, which are open to the public. There are no formal charges for attending these meetings, but a donation on the door is usually requested, this is typically between £3 and £5. Most branches hold an event at least once a month, so there are between 500 and 600 meetings up and down the UK every year in which an aspect of the Great War is discussed. The number of branches being formed is increasing.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Publications==
The WFA publishes its journal, "Stand To!" three times a year. This contains articles on the subject of The Great War. There is also a house magazine for members, the "Bulletin", which is also published three times each year. An electronic newsletter is also available to which members and non-members can subscribe.

==Video resources==
The Western Front Association holds conferences in various venues with typically four or five speakers addressing a range of subjects. These conferences are often filmed and these videos have been made freely available to the public via the Association's web site and via YouTube.

==Annual Service of Remembrance==
The WFA organises each year the Remembrance ceremony held at the [[The Cenotaph, Whitehall|Cenotaph]] in Whitehall, London on 11 November (except when the 11th falls on Remembrance Sunday). The 2014 ceremony was attended by the Prime Minister, David Cameron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.centenarynews.com/article?id=3068 |title=Prime Minister joins WFA in Armistice Day remembrance at the Cenotaph, London  |publisher =[[Centenary News]] |accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Butte de Warlencourt==
[[File:Butte de Warlencourt, Memorial.jpg|thumb|Memorial on the Butte de Warlencourt]]
The Western Front Association owned a small but historically important part of the "old front line" on the Somme, the [[Attacks on the Butte de Warlencourt|Butte de Warlencourt]].

A memorial detailing the fighting that took place in the area was dedicated in a ceremony on the Butte on 30 June 1990. The ceremony involved the then President of the WFA, well known historian and author John Terraine.

==First World War records saved==

===Medal index cards===
The Medal Index Cards were saved from destruction in 2005. Medal Index Cards (MICs) are the original method of recording medal entitlement for soldiers who served in the Great War.Each soldier who served in an active theatre of operations was awarded a medal.

The Medal Index Cards were stored at the Ministry of Defence record centre in Hayes until 2005. Due to the need to make space, the MoD sold the Hayes site for redevelopment; the MoD (which owned the cards) proposed the cards would be destroyed. No museum or archive was prepared to take them on, so the Western Front Association came forward and agreed to save these records.

Since obtaining these cards, the WFA has been storing them. Many WFA members have requested copies of these, often placing the card in a frame alongside the medals.

===Pension index cards and ledgers===

In November 2012, the WFA announced that it has secured over six million Pension Index Cards and Ledgers from the UK's Ministry of Defence, which would otherwise have been destroyed. These are an extremely valuable primary source for family and military historians as they provide information on men (and some women) who served in the Great War and who subsequently applied for a pension. This significantly adds to the data that is available, particularly for those individuals who survived the Great War.

==Sound archives at the Imperial War Museum==

The Imperial War Museum's sound archive holds over 33,000 recordings relating to conflict since 1914. This consists of the largest oral history collection of its type in the world, with contributions from both service personnel and non-combatants as well as significant holdings of speeches, sound effects, broadcasts, poetry and music.  The Western Front Association funded digitisation of the majority of IWM's First World War sound recordings, thereby widening public access to this important historical resource.

==Tours==
The WFA organises tours of the Battlefields for its members three times a year. Many of the WFA's branches organise similar tours at a local level.

The '''Yellowstone Caldera''' is a [[volcano|volcanic]] [[caldera]] and [[supervolcano]] in [[Yellowstone National Park]] in the [[Western United States]], sometimes referred to as the '''Yellowstone Supervolcano'''. The caldera and most of the park are located in the northwest corner of [[Wyoming]].  The major features of the caldera measure about 34 by 45 miles (55 by 72&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref&gt;as determined by [[geology|geological]] field work conducted by Bob Christiansen of the [[United States Geological Survey]] in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Editors: do not add discovered by satellite; see talk page --&gt;

The caldera formed during the last of three supereruptions over the past 2.1 million years: the Huckleberry Ridge eruption 2.1 million years ago (which created the [[Island Park Caldera]] and the [[Huckleberry Ridge Tuff]]); the Mesa Falls eruption 1.3 million years ago (which created the [[Henry's Fork Caldera]] and the [[Mesa Falls Tuff]]); and the Lava Creek eruption approximately 630,000 years ago (which created the Yellowstone Caldera and the [[Lava Creek Tuff]]).&lt;ref&gt;Naomi E Matthews et al., 2015, "Age of the Lava Creek supereruption and magma chamber assembly at Yellowstone based on 40Ar/39Ar and U-Pb dating of sanidine and zircon crystals" [[doi:10.1002/2015GC005881|DOI: 10.1002/2015GC005881]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Volcanism at Yellowstone==
[[Image:Yellowstone Caldera map2.JPG|thumb|300px|Yellowstone sits on top of four overlapping calderas. (US NPS)]]
Volcanism at Yellowstone is relatively recent, with calderas that were created during large eruptions that took place 2.1 million, 1.3 million, and 630,000 years ago. The calderas lie over a [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] where light and hot [[magma]] (molten rock) from the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] rises toward the surface. While the [[Yellowstone hotspot]] is now under the [[Yellowstone Plateau]], it did help to create the eastern [[Snake River Plain]] (to the west of Yellowstone) through a series of huge [[volcanic eruption]]s. The hotspot appears to move across terrain in the east-northeast direction, but in fact the hotspot is much deeper than terrain and remains stationary while the [[North American Plate]] moves west-southwest over it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Yellowstone Caldera, Wyoming—USGS| work = Cascade Volcano Observatory| publisher = [[United States Geological Survey]]| date = January 22, 2003| url = http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/Yellowstone/description_yellowstone.html | accessdate = December 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Over the past 18 million years or so, this hotspot has generated a succession of violent eruptions and less violent [[flood basalt|floods of basaltic lava]]. Together these eruptions have helped create the eastern part of the [[Snake River Plain]] from a once-mountainous region. At least a dozen of these eruptions were so massive that they are classified as [[Supervolcano|supereruptions]]. Volcanic eruptions sometimes empty their stores of magma so swiftly that the overlying land collapses into the emptied [[magma chamber]], forming a geographic depression called a caldera.

The oldest identified caldera remnant straddles the border near [[McDermitt, Nevada–Oregon]], although there are [[Pyroclastic rock|volcaniclastic]] piles and [[Fault (geology)#Ring fault|arcuate faults]] that define caldera complexes more than {{Convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter in the [[Carmacks Group]] of southwest-central [[Yukon]], Canada, which are interpreted to have been formed 70&amp;nbsp;million years ago by the Yellowstone hotspot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1996)024&lt;0997:YIYTLC&gt;2.3.CO;2|title=Yellowstone in Yukon: The Late Cretaceous Carmacks Group|author1=Johnston, Stephen T. |author2=Wynne, P.

One such caldera, the [[Bruneau-Jarbidge caldera]] in southern [[Idaho]], was formed between 10 and 12 million years ago, and the event dropped ash to a depth of one foot (30&amp;nbsp;cm) {{convert|1000|mi|km}} away in northeastern [[Nebraska]] and killed  large herds of [[rhinoceros]], camel, and other animals at [[Ashfall Fossil Beds]] State Historical Park.  The [[United States Geological Survey]] ("USGS") estimates there are one or two major caldera-forming eruptions and 100 or so lava extruding eruptions per million years, and "several to many" steam eruptions per century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/yellowstone/yellowstone_hazard_42.html Yellowstone Volcanic Hazards, USGS]. Volcanoes.usgs.gov (March 1, 2012). Retrieved on December 31, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The loosely defined term "[[supervolcano]]" has been used to describe volcanic fields that produce exceptionally large volcanic eruptions. Thus defined, the Yellowstone Supervolcano is the volcanic field which produced the latest three supereruptions from the Yellowstone hotspot; it also produced one additional smaller eruption, thereby creating the West Thumb of Yellowstone Lake&lt;ref&gt;West Thumb Lake is not to be confused with West Thumb Geyser Basin. The caldera created West Thumb Lake, and the underlying [[Yellowstone hotspot]] keeps West Thumb Geyser Basin active. See [http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/geology/publications/bul/1347/sec3.htm Fig. 22] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610222507/http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/geology/publications/bul/1347/sec3.htm |date=June 10, 2013 }}.  See also [[:File:Yellowstone Caldera map2.JPG]].&lt;/ref&gt; 174,000 years ago. The three supereruptions occurred 2.1 million, 1.3 million, and approximately 630,000 years ago, forming the [[Island Park Caldera]], the [[Henry's Fork Caldera]], and Yellowstone calderas, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Newhall, Christopher G.; Dzurisin, Daniel (1988) [https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/b1855 Historical Unrest at Large Calderas of the World]: U.S. Geological Survey Bulletin 1855&lt;/ref&gt; The Island Park Caldera supereruption (2.1 million years ago), which produced the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff, was the largest, and produced 2,500 times as much ash as the [[1980 Mount St. Helens eruption]]. The next biggest supereruption formed the Yellowstone Caldera (~ 630,000 years ago) and produced the Lava Creek Tuff. The Henry's Fork Caldera (1.2 million years ago) produced the smaller Mesa Falls Tuff, but is the only caldera from the Snake River Plain-Yellowstone hotspot that is plainly visible today.&lt;ref&gt;This qualitative statement is easily verified by reviewing the Yellowstone area in Google Earth&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-explosive eruptions of [[lava]] and less-violent explosive eruptions have occurred in and near the Yellowstone caldera since the last supereruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Origin and evolution of silicic magmatism at Yellowstone |url=http://pages.uoregon.edu/bindeman/Bindemanetal2008.pdf |work=University of Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Secrets of supervolcanoes|url=http://pages.uoregon.edu/bindeman/Supervolcanoes.pdf|work=University of Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent lava flow occurred about 70,000 years ago, while a violent eruption excavated the West Thumb of Lake Yellowstone around 150,000 years ago. Smaller steam explosions occur as well: an explosion 13,800 years ago left a {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} diameter [[volcanic crater|crater]] at Mary Bay on the edge of [[Yellowstone Lake]] (located in the center of the caldera).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Introduction to hydrothermal (steam) explosions in Yellowstone| work = Yellowstone National Park| publisher = Yellowstone Net| url = http://www.yellowstone.net/hydrothermal.htm| accessdate = December 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USGSFS3024"/&gt; Currently, volcanic activity is exhibited via numerous [[geothermal areas of Yellowstone|geothermal vents]] scattered throughout the region, including the famous [[Old Faithful Geyser]], plus recorded ground-swelling indicating ongoing inflation of the underlying magma chamber.

The volcanic eruptions, as well as the continuing geothermal activity, are a result of a great cove of magma located below the caldera's surface. The magma in this cove contains gases that are kept dissolved by the immense pressure under which the magma is contained. If the pressure is released to a sufficient degree by some geological shift, then some of the gases bubble out and cause the magma to expand. This can cause a [[chain reaction]]. If the expansion results in further relief of pressure, for example, by blowing crust material off the top of the chamber, the result is a very large gas explosion.

According to analysis of earthquake data in 2013, the magma chamber is {{convert|80|km|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} wide. It also has {{convert|4000|km3|abbr=on}} underground volume, of which 6–8% is filled with molten rock. This is about 2.5 times bigger than scientists had previously imagined it to be; however, scientists believe that the proportion of molten rock in the chamber is much too low to allow another supereruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature.2013.14036|title=Large magma reservoir gets bigger|year=2013|last1=Witze|first1=Alexandra|journal=Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/observatories/yvo/yvo_news_archive.html|title=USGS: Volcano Hazards Program – Yellowstone Volcano Observatory Featured Articles Archive|accessdate=April 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yellowstone hotspot origin==
{{Main|Yellowstone hotspot}}

The source of the Yellowstone hotspot is controversial. Some geoscientists hypothesize that the Yellowstone hotspot is the effect of an interaction between local conditions in the [[lithosphere]] and upper [[mantle convection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Foulger|first=Gillian|authorlink=Gillian Foulger|title=Yellowstone|url=http://www.mantleplumes.org/Yellowstone.html|date=February 8, 2006|publisher = MantlePlumes.org|accessdate=February 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Christiansen |first=Robert L. |first2=G.R. |last2=Foulger |first3=John R. |last3=Evans |title=Upper-mantle origin of the Yellowstone hotspot |journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin |volume=114 |issue=10 |pages=1245–1256 |year=2002 |doi=10.1130/0016-7606(2002)114&lt;1245:UMOOTY&gt;2.0.CO;2 |bibcode=2002GSAB..114.1245C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others suggest an origin in the deep mantle ([[mantle plume]]).&lt;ref&gt;See list of off-line references in [http://www.mantleplumes.org/CRB.html mantleplumes.org/CRB.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the controversy is the relatively sudden appearance of the hotspot in the geologic record. Additionally, the [[Columbia River Basalt Group|Columbia Basalt flows]] appeared at the same approximate time in the same place, causing speculation about their common origin.  As the Yellowstone hotspot traveled to the east and north, the Columbia disturbance moved northward and eventually subsided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Ivanov|first= Alexei V.|title= The Columbia River Flood Basalts: Consequence of subduction-related processes|url=http://www.mantleplumes.org/Yellowstone.html|date=February 7, 2007|publisher=MantlePlumes.org|accessdate= December 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternate theory to the [[Mantle plume|mantle plume model]] was proposed in 2018. It is suggested that the volcanism may be caused by upwellings from the [[Mantle (geology)#Structure|lower mantle]] resulting from water-rich fragments of the Farallon plate descending from the Cascadia subduction region, sheared off at a subducted spreading rift.&lt;ref name=zhou&gt;{{cite|title=Anomalous mantle transition zone beneath the Yellowstone hotspot track| author-last=Zhou| author-first=Ying| journal=Nature| volume=11| pages=449-453| date=2018| doi=10.1038/s41561-018-0126-4| url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-018-0126-4| access-date=July 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earthquakes===
[[File:Yellowstone_earthquakes_history.svg| thumb| Number of earthquakes in [[Yellowstone National Park]] region (1973–2014) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quake.utah.edu/EQCENTER/LISTINGS/OTHER/yellowregion.htm|title=Yellowstone National Park Earthquake listings|accessdate=April 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Volcanic and tectonic actions in the region cause between 1,000 and 2,000 measurable [[earthquake]]s annually. Most are relatively minor, measuring a magnitude of 3 or weaker. Occasionally, numerous earthquakes are detected in a relatively short period of time, an event known as an [[earthquake swarm]]. In 1985, more than 3,000 earthquakes were measured over a period of several months. More than 70 smaller swarms were detected between 1983 and 2008. The USGS states these swarms are likely caused by slips on pre-existing faults rather than by movements of magma or [[hydrothermal]] fluids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/yvo/publications/2004/apr04swarm.php|title=Yellowstone Earthquake Swarms|publisher=[[Yellowstone Volcano Observatory]]|accessdate=January 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="volcanoes.usgs.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/activity/archiveupdate.php?noticeid=5199|title=January 2010 Yellowstone Seismicity Summary|accessdate=February 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, continuing into January 2009, more than 500 quakes were detected under the northwest end of [[Yellowstone Lake]] over a seven-day span, with the largest registering a magnitude of 3.9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/yvo/activity/archive/2009.php|title=Archive of Yellowstone Updates for 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seis.utah.edu/helicorder/heli/yellowstone/Uuss.LKWY_SHZ_US.2008123100.gif|title=UUSS Webicorder (Seismogram) at Lake for December 31, 2008|accessdate=January 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another swarm started in January 2010, after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|Haiti earthquake]] and before the [[2010 Chile earthquake|Chile earthquake]]. With 1,620 small earthquakes between January 17, 2010, and February 1, 2010, this swarm was the second-largest ever recorded in the Yellowstone Caldera.

The Yellowstone Volcano Observatory issued a statement on its website stating,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Although fascinating, the new findings do not imply increased geologic hazards at Yellowstone, and certainly do not increase the chances of a 'supereruption' in the near future. Contrary to some media reports, Yellowstone is not 'overdue' for a supereruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date= December 19, 2013 |title= Monitoring Upgrades Result in New Insight Into Yellowstone's Magma System |url=http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/observatories/yvo/yvo_news_archive.html |location= |publisher=[[Yellowstone Volcano Observatory]] (USGS) |accessdate=January 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Other media reports were more hyperbolic in their coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Burnett |first=Jim |date=January 1, 2014 |title= Reactions To Yellowstone Supervolcano Study Ranged From Hysteria To Ho-Hum |url=http://www.nationalparkstraveler.com/2014/01/reactions-yellowstone-supervolcano-study-ranged-hysteria-ho-hum24449 |website=National Parks Traveller |accessdate=January 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in ''GSA Today'', the monthly news and science magazine of the [[Geological Society of America]], identified three fault zones on which future eruptions are most likely to be centered.&lt;ref name=NG&gt;{{cite web| title=Yellowstone Supervolcano Discovery—Where Will It Erupt? | author=Richard A. Lovett| publisher=National Geographic| url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/09/120920-yellowstone-supervolcano-prediction-volcanoes-science-environment/|  date=September 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of those areas are associated with lava flows aged 174,000–70,000 years, and the third is a focus of present-day seismicity.&lt;ref name=NG /&gt;

In 2017, [[NASA]] conducted a study to determine the feasibility of preventing the volcano from erupting. The results suggested that cooling the magma chamber by 35 percent would be enough to forestall such an incident. NASA proposed introducing water at high pressure 10 kilometers underground. The circulating water would release heat at the surface, possibly in a way that could be used as a [[Geothermal power|power source]]. If enacted, the plan would cost about $3.46 billion. Nevertheless, according to Brian Wilson of the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], a completed project might trigger, instead of prevent, an eruption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20170817-nasas-ambitious-plan-to-save-earth-from-a-supervolcano Nasa's ambitious plan to save earth from a supervolcano]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/rockyplanet/2017/08/31/2250904/ No, NASA Isn’t Going to Drill to Stop Yellowstone from Erupting]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrothermal explosions===

{{details|Hydrothermal explosion}}

Studies and analysis may indicate that the greater hazard comes from hydrothermal activity which occurs independently of volcanic activity. Over 20 large craters have been produced in the past 14,000 years, resulting in such features as Mary Bay, [[Turbid Lake]], and Indian Pond which was created in an eruption about 1300 BC.

In a 2003 report, USGS researchers proposed that an earthquake may have displaced more than {{convert|77|Mcuft|m3}} (576,000,000 US gallons) of water in Yellowstone Lake, creating colossal waves that unsealed a capped geothermal system and led to the hydrothermal explosion that formed Mary Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Frequently asked questions about recent findings at Yellowstone Lake| work = Yellowstone Volcano Observatory| publisher = [[United States Geological Survey]]| date = September 11, 2008| url = http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/yvo/publications/2003/LakeQA.php| accessdate = December 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Tsunami linked to Yellowstone crater| publisher = [[USA Today]]| date = January 14, 2008| url = https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2008-01-14-tsunami-yellowstone_N.htm| accessdate = December 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further research shows that very distant earthquakes reach and have effects upon the activities at Yellowstone, such as the 1992 7.3 magnitude [[1992 Landers earthquake|Landers earthquake]] in [[California]]’s [[Mojave Desert]] that triggered a swarm of quakes from more than {{convert|800|mi|km}} away, and the 2002 7.9 magnitude [[2002 Denali earthquake|Denali fault earthquake]] {{convert|2000|mi|km}} away in [[Alaska]] that altered the activity of many geysers and hot springs for several months afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Quake in Alaska Changed Yellowstone Geysers| publisher = [[University of Utah]]| date = May 27, 2004| url = http://unews.utah.edu/p/?r=030306-10| accessdate = December 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the United States Geological Survey announced plans to map the subterranean systems responsible for feeding the area's hydrothermal activity. According to the researchers, these maps could help predict when another supereruption occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=We're About to Find Out What's Rumbling Below The Yellowstone Supervolcano|url=http://www.sciencealert.com/we-re-about-to-find-out-what-s-rumbling-below-the-yellowstone-supervolcano|website=Science Alert|accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
