'''100 Pine Center''' is a [[Office#Grading|class-A office building]] at the northwest corner of Pine Street and Front Street in [[Financial District (San Francisco)|San Francisco's Financial District]].&lt;ref name=unico/&gt; The building is {{convert|145|m|abbr=on}} with 33 floors, and {{convert|402500|sqft|m2|-3|abbr=on}} of rentable office space, a 150-car garage including 30 valet parking spaces.&lt;ref name=unico&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicoprop.com/properties/100_pine.html |publisher=Unico |title=100 Pine |accessdate=December 1, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020154936/http://www.unicoprop.com/properties/100_pine.html |archivedate=October 20, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=walton&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waltonst.com/Our%20Funds/Fund%20I/100%20Pine%20Street.aspx |title=100 Pine Street |publisher=Walton St. Capital |accessdate=December 1, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113135609/http://www.waltonst.com/Our%20Funds/Fund%20I/100%20Pine%20Street.aspx |archivedate=January 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Completed in 1972 as headquarters of the Continental Insurance Company, the building is among the earlier of San Francisco's modern skyscrapers.

As of 2016, it is tied with [[45 Fremont Center]] as the twenty-sixth tallest building in San Francisco. It was certified as being operated and maintained as a green building under the US Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design for Existing Buildings (LEED EB 2.0) standards in July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Green Building Council LEED Project List|url=http://www.usgbc.org/LEED/Project/CertifiedProjectList.aspx|access-date=2008-08-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081103030148/http://www.usgbc.org/LEED/Project/CertifiedProjectList.aspx|archive-date=2008-11-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="949">Agnesium is a [[neologism]] coined to describe a powerful, efficient and effective organization as an entity.&lt;ref&gt;Introducing Organizational Behaviour and Management
 By David Knights, Hugh Willmott&lt;/ref&gt; Agnesium is a combination of [https://translate.google.ch/?oe=UTF-8&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;client=tw-ob#la/en/Agnes Agnes] (Latin for powerful, efficient and effective) and the suffix -ium &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/-ium -ium]&lt;/ref&gt; (indicating a biological structure).

The basic principle of Agnesium is that for complex structures/organizations there are many interdependencies between the members that are not known, understood or leveraged. By recognizing, understanding and leveraging these hidden interdependencies an organization can be proactive, adaptive and exploitive.

==History==
''Al Eqtisadiah'' was first launched as an economic daily in 1962.&lt;ref name=cable2009&gt;{{cite web|title=Ideological and ownership trends in the Saudi Media|url=http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=09RIYADH651|work=Wikileaks|accessdate=1 May 2012|date=11 May 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116083750/http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=09RIYADH651|archive-date=16 January 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founders of the paper were [[Hisham Hafiz]] and his brother Mohammad Hafiz.&lt;ref name=hisham&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography |url=http://www.hishamalihafiz.com/bio.htm |work=Hisham Ali Hafiz |accessdate=22 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722005217/http://www.hishamalihafiz.com/bio.htm |archivedate=22 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, it began to be published by Saudi Research and Publishing Company, a subsidiary of [[Saudi Research and Marketing Group]], on 12 January 1992.&lt;ref name=sprcpub/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Al Eqtisadiah website|url=http://www.numumultimedia.com/portfolio/al-eqtisadiah-website/|work=Numu Multimedia|accessdate=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paper has a [[Gulf of Basra|Gulf]] edition.&lt;ref name=prn/&gt;

==Target audience==
''Al Eqtisadiah'' is often called "The Financial Times of Saudi Arabia".&lt;ref name=bsc&gt;{{cite web|title=Best Saudi company work for|url=http://www.bestsaudicompany.com/portal/content/about-list|work=BSC|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, its target population is primarily businesspeople&lt;ref name=mme&gt;{{cite web|title=Saudi Arabia|url=http://mediame.com/country/saudi_arabia/al_eqtisadiah|work=Media ME|accessdate=1 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116111434/http://mediame.com/country/saudi_arabia/al_eqtisadiah|archive-date=16 November 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as academics, and senior government employees in the Kingdom and [[Gulf Cooperation Council|the GCC]].&lt;ref name=sprcpub&gt;{{cite web|title=Publications |url=http://www.srpc.com/en/publications |work=Saudi Research and Publishing Company |accessdate=1 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430170624/http://www.srpc.com/en/publications |archivedate=30 April 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Al Eqtisadiah'' is reported to rapidly secure a loyal readership of Saudi executives and government officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trade promotion and advertising in Saudi Arabia|url=http://www.globaltrade.net/f/business/text/Saudi-Arabia/Selling-Distribution-Networks-Trade-Promotion-and-Advertising-in-Saudi-Arabia.html|work=Global Trade|accessdate=17 May 2012|date=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper is also read by educated Saudi women and female students.&lt;ref name=prn&gt;{{cite news|title=Arabic Language Edition of BusinessWeek Launched|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/arabic-language-edition-of-businessweek-launched-55605287.html|accessdate=7 June 2015|work=PR Newswire|location=New York, Beirut}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership==
''Al Eqtisadiah'' is one of the daily newspapers published by [http://www.srpc.com Saudi Research and Publishing Company (SRPC)], one of the Saudi Research and Marketing Group (SRMG) companies.&lt;ref name=sprcpub/&gt;&lt;ref name=mme/&gt; The other daily newspapers published by SRPC are ''[[Arab News]]'' and ''[[Al-Sharq al-Awsat|Al Sharq Al Awsat]]''. The chairman of SRMG is [[Turki bin Salman Al Saud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Saudi Research and Marketing Group appoints new chairman|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2013/02/10/265556.html|accessdate=12 February 2013|work=Al Arabiya|date=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
''Al Eqtisadiah'' is the only specialized business and financial newspaper in the Kingdom.&lt;ref name=adnative&gt;{{cite web|title=Al Eqtisadiah |url=http://www.adnative.net/uk/represented-media/factsheet/?PARAM1=SJ1ID1&amp;title=Al-Eqtisadiah |work=Adnative |accessdate=29 May 2012 |year=2011 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper provides both news coverage and research, analysis and commentary on economic and business-related events at domestic, regional and international levels. It also provides the translated articles and news from major international business publications, including the ''[[Financial Times]]'', ''[[the Harvard Business Review]]'', ''[[INSEAD]]'', and ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|Frankfurter]]'' regarding major economic events and developments.&lt;ref name=sprcpub/&gt;

The newspaper closely deals with consumer affairs as well as financial trends within [[Middle East|the region]] and abroad.&lt;ref name=prn/&gt; It offers its readers opinions about their financial initiatives and investments. It monitors the developments throughout [[Saudi Arabia|the Kingdom]] by focusing on social and economic trends and uncovering important issues that have impact on communities as well as the country’s economy as a whole. Additionally, daily in-depth articles published provide an analysis of how developments may affect the Saudi economy.&lt;ref name=bsc/&gt;

Although ''Al Eqtisadiah'' was founded as a financial daily paper, it is equally known for its political content, often printing editorials and opinion harshly critical of the US on a number of fronts.&lt;ref name=cable2009/&gt; On the other hand, during the term of its former chief editor Abdul Wahab Al Faiz, ''Al Eqtisadiah'' a few years before 2009 appeared to return to its original finance-focus, gradually moving away from political opinion and focusing on themes of interest to the region's business elite.&lt;ref name=cable2009/&gt;

However, ''Al Eqtisadiah'' seems to return to the pre-Al Faiz period, since editor-in-chief Salman Al Dossari published an article challenging the [[Russia]]'s stance over Syrian government on 24 March 2012. Specifically, Al Dossari harshly criticized Russia, especially [[Sergey Lavrov]], for supporting [[Bashar Assad]] and argued that the same tactics used by Russia to oppress Muslim majority in [[Chechnya]] and the [[Caucasus]] have been used by Assad to oppress Sunni majority in [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=H.

The paper also contains a section on [[environmental issues]] which is published weekly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Najib Saab |title=The Environment in Arab Media |url=http://www.afedonline.org/afedreport/english/book14.pdf |work=Arab Forum for Environment and Development |accessdate=7 October 2014 |format=Report |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010170621/http://www.afedonline.org/afedreport/english/book14.pdf |archivedate=10 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alexander Ariipaea Salmon.jpg|thumb|200px|Alexander Salmon, Jr., c. 1885.]]
'''Alexander Ari{{okina}}ipaea Vehiaitipare Salmon Jr.''' (1855–1914) was the English-Jewish-Tahitian co-owner of the Maison Brander plantations on [[Tahiti]] and ''de facto'' ruler of [[Easter Island]] from 1878 till its cession to [[Chile]] in 1888.

==Family==
Salmon's father, [[Alexander Salmon]] (Solomon, 1822–1866), was an English Jewish merchant. While secretary to [[Pomare IV|Pōmare IV]] of Tahiti, he fell in love with her twenty-year-old adoptive sister Oehau. For three days the queen cancelled the law forbidding a Tahitian to marry a foreigner, gave Princess Oehau the title ''[[Aliʻi|ari'i]]'' Taimai, and they married.

Their daughter, Salmon's sister, [[Queen Marau|Johanna Marau Ta'aroa]] (1846–1934),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guide2womenleaders.com/womeninpower/Womeninpower1870.htm Women Leaders]&lt;/ref&gt; married her uncle, the future King [[Pōmare V]], and was ''de facto'' ruler as Queen Marau (1877–1880) until he abdicated to the French colonial government. Another daughter married the Scottish merchant [[John Brander (merchant)|John Brander]].

Their son, Alexander Jr, known as "Pa'ea" (Mangarevan for 'hobble'), inherited his father's business interests and became co-owner with Brander of the ''Maison Brander'' [[copra]] and [[coconut oil]] plantations in Tahiti, the [[Marquesas]], and the [[Cook Islands|Cooks]].

==Easter Island==
The ''Maison Brander'' owned a large sheep ranch on Easter Island for exporting wool. The ranch was managed by the power-hungry convicted murderer [[Jean-Baptiste Dutrou-Bornier]], who had acquired additional land and appointed his [[Rapanui]] wife "Queen". This was the low point in the island's history; by 1872 its resident population had been reduced to 111.

In 1871 Alexander Jr had picked up rudimentary [[Rapanui language|Rapanui]] from his hundreds of indentured Easter Island labourers at the [[Mahina, French Polynesia|Mahina]] coconut plantation on Tahiti. In 1877 Queen Pōmare IV died, and Alexander's sister became regent. John Brander also died that year, and Dutrou-Bornier was assassinated. Alexander set off for Easter Island to manage the sheep station in around October 1878 with twenty Tahitian workers and an unknown number of Rapanui whose indentures had expired and ran the island for a decade. He introduced the [[coconut]], the first sizeable tree on the island since its deforestation two centuries earlier, apart from some fruit trees at the [[Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary|SSCC]] Catholic mission and Dutrou-Bornier's estate.

Salmon returned to Tahiti in 1883–1884 for business. Upon his return to Easter Island he bought up all remaining land apart from the SSCC mission at [[Hanga Roa]]. As owner of nearly all the island and sole source of employment, Salmon was ''de facto'' ruler.

As he was not a religious man, and a Jew, the priests did not like him, especially [[Hippolyte Roussel]], who had been forced to leave the island in 1871 due to conflict with Dutrou-Bornier but who visited again in 1879. Bishop [[Florentin-Étienne Jaussen|Jaussen]] in Tahiti appointed a Rapanui, [[Atamu te Kena]], "king" to protect church interests from the ''Maison Brander'', but Salmon ignored him and he never had any influence. However, Salmon was an honest man and sincerely interested in the welfare of the people, and the population started to recover. This was the era of the strong Tahitian influence on the Rapanui language and culture.

In addition to wool exports, Salmon developed a tourist industry. He encouraged the manufacture of Rapanui artworks, including imitation ''[[rongorongo]]'' inscriptions, and helped sell them to passing ships for good prices as cultural artefacts, though he never claimed they were genuine. The artisans knew currency exchange rates and could deal with Europeans and Americans on their own terms.

Salmon served as the principal informant for the British and [[:de:SMS Hyäne|German archaeological expeditions]] to the island in 1882 and for the Americans in 1886, as guide, translator, and hotelier.

Cooke, surgeon of the [[USS Mohican (1883)|USS ''Mohican'']], which dropped anchor in December 1886, said,&lt;ref&gt;Fischer pp 131–132&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Mr Salmon, who is guide, philosopher, and friend to these people, unites in his person (and being a giant in stature, he can well contain them) the duties of referee, arbiter, judge. They entertain the greatest respect for him; evince the utmost affection; look up to him as their master; go to him with all their troubles; refer to him all their disputes and grievances. His word is law, and his decisions final and undisputed.}}

The information Salmon provided, despite its often poor quality, is still among the most important of Easter Island's early historical period. He also sent three genuine ''rongorongo'' tablets to his niece's husband, Heinrich August Schlubach, the German consul of [[Valparaíso]], which are now kept in Vienna and Berlin.

[[File:Prince Kuhio with Alexander Ariipaea Salmon (PP-97-1-048).jpg|thumb|Salmon with Hawaiian [[Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole|Prince Kūhiō]] in 1907]]
Salmon sold the Brander Easter Island holdings to the Chilean government on 2 January 1888 and signed as a witness to the cession of the island. He returned to Tahiti in December of that year. He left for the remote [[Tuamotus|Tuamotu Islands]] after being arrested and put in prison for assault and battery. He collected the oral histories of the people of the Tuamotus. He moved to San Francisco in later life and was involved in a scheme to marry ex-Queen [[Liliuokalani]] of Hawaii, who he claimed he had been engaged to from birth. The plot was merely a heist to take Liliuokalani's money to pay his debt.
He died in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/na101/home/literatum/publisher/tandf/journals/content/cjph20/2005/cjph20.v040.i02/00223340500176574/production/images/medium/cjph_a_10043846_o_art001.gif Tandfonline]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1520">The '''American Specialty Toy Retailing Association''', or ''ASTRA'', is an [[organization]]  of [[manufacturers]], manufacturers representatives, [[distributor]]s and [[retail]]ers of [[specialty toys]] (as compared to [[mass market]] product).

The American Specialty Toy Retailing Association (ASTRA) is a non-profit association that provides leadership and resources to grow the specialty toy industry.  It is the largest association serving the specialty toy industry. ASTRA members build their businesses around specialty toys, which generally are designed with a focus on what the [[child]] can do, rather than what the toy can do.

==Neighborhood Toy Store Day==
In 2010, ASTRA established Neighborhood [[Toy stores|Toy Store]] Day, to be observed on the second Saturday of each November.&lt;ref&gt;Yahoo Finance: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shop-local-support-community-neighborhood-143000077.htm Shop Local, Support The Community This "Neighborhood Toy Store Day]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Oklahoman [http://newsok.com/oklahoma-city-area-stores-plan-events-for-neighborhood-toy-store-day-on-nov.-9/article/3899269 Oklahoma City-area stores plan events for Neighborhood Toy Store Day]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Metro Parent: [http://www.metroparent.com/Metro-Parent/November-2011/Neighborhood-Toy-Store-Day-in-Southeast-Michigan Neighborhood Toy Store Day]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Taechaubol spent his high school years in [[Sydney, Australia]], where he attended [[Newington College]] (1987–1992).&lt;ref&gt;Newington College Register of Past Students 1863-1998 (Syd, 1999) pp 193&lt;/ref&gt;  He has a degree in Civil Engineering from the [[University of New South Wales]] (1998) and an MBA from [[Chulalongkorn University]] (2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theworldfolio.com/news/bee-taechaubol-local-entrepreneur-thailand-n2226/2226/|title=Thai entrepreneur Bee Taechaubol brings investment to local SMEs|author=The Worldfolio|work=theworldfolio.com|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="goal.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/1717/editorial/2015/05/04/11355622/from-dishwasher-to-billionaire-mr-bee-only-had-eyes-for-ac|title=From dishwasher to billionaire: Mr Bee only had eyes for AC Milan|work=Goal.com|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business interests==
Thai Prime Company Limited is a South-East Asian based Private Equity group, founded by Taechaubol. Thai Prime has interests in a number of sectors, including financial services, construction, property, technology, parking, traffic infrastructure, sports and payment gateways. These interests are primarily South-East Asian centric, but extend across Asia, China and into Australia.&lt;ref name="financeasia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financeasia.com/News/395061,thai-sibling-rivalry-generates-deals.aspx|title=Thai sibling rivalry generates deals|work=FinanceAsia|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thai Prime operates by acquiring, holding and developing assets over the longer-term. Current holdings include K-Tech Construction Public Company Limited, Electronics Industry Public Company Limited, Country Group Development Public Company Limited, Smart Traffic Company Limited and Asia Park Company Limited. Thai Prime is also acquiring a land bank in Central Bangkok that will soon be under development across a number of real estate segments.&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"/&gt;

==Football==
In 2014, Taechaubol acquired the exclusive rights as sole organizer across Asia for the Global Legends Series, a four-game series bringing together legendary football players from around the world.  These players play against each other in a Legends vs. Legends four-match series in different cities across the world. Players include [[Fabio Cannavaro]], [[Michael Owen]], [[Luis Figo]], [[Cafu]] and [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] amongst others.
The Global Legends Series inaugural match took place on 5 December 2014 in [[Bangkok, Thailand]]. Launched with a ceremony to honour his Majesty King Bhumibhol Adulyadej’s 87th birthday, the event was broadcast across the globe to more than 200 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/sports/Legends-of-the-game-set-to-kick-off-in-Thailand-30246381.html|title=Legends of the game set to kick off in Thailand|date=28 October 2014|work=The Nation|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Castle Clinton''' or '''Fort Clinton''', previously known as '''Castle Garden''', is a circular [[sandstone]] [[fort]] now located in [[Battery Park]], in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. It is perhaps best remembered as [[History of immigration to the United States|America's first immigration station]] (predating [[Ellis Island]]), where more than 8 million people arrived in the United States from 1855 to 1890. Over its active life, it has also functioned as a [[beer garden]], [[exhibition hall]], [[theater]], and [[public aquarium]], and currently is a [[U.S. National Monument|national monument]].

==Historic use==
Castle Clinton stands approximately two blocks west of where [[Fort Amsterdam]] was built in 1626, when New York City was known by the Dutch name [[New Amsterdam]]. Construction began in 1808 and was completed in 1811.  The fort, known as West Battery (sometimes Southwest Battery), was designed by architects [[John McComb, Jr.]] and [[Jonathan Williams (engineer)|Jonathan Williams]].  It was built on a small [[artificial island]] just off shore.

West Battery was intended to complement the three-tiered [[Castle Williams]] on [[Governors Island]], which was East Battery, to defend New York City from [[United Kingdom|British]] forces in the tensions that marked the run-up to the [[War of 1812]], but it never saw action in that or any war. Subsequent [[Land reclamation|landfill]] expanded Battery Park, and the fort was incorporated into the mainland of Manhattan Island.

Castle Clinton National Monument was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on October 15, 1966.

==19th century==

[[File:Castle Garden aerial view ca1880.jpg|thumb|Aerial view illustration of Manhattan, showing Castle Garden at its tip, ca. 1880]]
[[File:Battery Park 002.jpg|thumb|The [[New York City Aquarium]] was once housed at Castle Garden (image before 1923)]]
West Battery was renamed Castle Clinton in 1815, its current official name, in honor of [[Mayor of New York City|New York City Mayor]] [[DeWitt Clinton]] (who eventually became [[Governor of New York]]).

The [[United States Army]] stopped using the fort in 1821, and it was leased to New York City as a place of public entertainment. It opened as Castle Garden on July 3, 1824, a name by which it was popularly known for most of its existence, even to the present time. It served in turn as a [[promenade]], [[beer garden]]/[[restaurant]], [[exhibition hall]], [[opera house]], and [[theater (structure)|theater]]. Designed as an open-air structure, it was eventually roofed over to accommodate these uses.

In 1850, the castle was the site of two concerts given for charity by Swedish [[soprano]] [[Jenny Lind]] to initiate her American tour. A year later, European dancing star [[Lola Montez]] performed her notorious "tarantula dance" in Castle Garden. In 1853–54, [[Louis-Antoine Jullien]], the eccentric French conductor and composer of light music, gave dozens of very successful concerts mixing classical and light music. The [[Max Maretzek Italian Opera Company]] notably staged the New York premieres of [[Gaetano Donizetti]]'s ''[[Marino Faliero (opera)|Marino Faliero]]'' on June 17, 1851, and [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Luisa Miller]]'' on July 20, 1854, at Castle Garden.&lt;ref&gt;Brodsky Lawrence pg. 314&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Whitney Martin pg. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immigration holding center==
In the first half of the 19th century, most immigrants arriving in New York City landed at docks on the east side of the tip of Manhattan, around [[South Street Seaport|South Street]]. On August 1, 1855, Castle Clinton became the Emigrant Landing Depot, functioning as the [[New York (state)|New York]] State immigrant processing center (the nation's first such entity). It was operated by the state until April 18, 1890,&lt;ref&gt;[http://genealogy.about.com/od/ports/p/castle_garden.htm About.com, "Castle Garden – America's First Official Immigration Center"]&lt;/ref&gt; when the [[U. S. government]] assumed control of immigration processing, soon moving the center to the larger, more isolated [[Ellis Island]] facility on January 2, 1892. The new facility was needed because immigrants were known to carry diseases, which led to epidemics of [[Cholera outbreaks and pandemics|cholera]] and [[smallpox]].

After many unnecessary deaths, and scandals over immigration workers cheating and stealing from immigrants, the immigration center was moved to Ellis Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transforming America: Perspectives on U.S. Immigration|last=LeMay|first=Michael|publisher=ABC-CLIO, LLC|year=2013|isbn=978-0-313-39643-4|location=Santa Barbara, California|pages=204–206|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Castle Clinton's immigrant passenger records were destroyed in a fire that consumed the first structures on Ellis Island on June 15, 1897,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1897/06/15/archives/fire-on-ellis-island-it-broke-out-shortly-after-midnight-in-the.html|title=FIRE ON ELLIS ISLAND; It Broke Out Shortly After Midnight in the Furnace of the Main Building.

Called ''{{lang|de|Kesselgarten}}'' by Yiddish-speaking Eastern European Jews, a ''{{lang|de|Kesselgarten}}'' became a generic term for any situation that was noisy, confusing or chaotic, or where a "[[wikt:babel|babel]]" of languages was spoken (a reference to the multitude of languages heard spoken by the immigrants from many countries at the site).{{citation needed|date=August 2016|reason=Beyond Castle Garden?}} Prominent persons associated with the administration of the immigrant station included [[Gulian Crommelin Verplanck]], [[Friedrich Kapp]], and [[John Alexander Kennedy]].

==20th century to present==
From 1896 to 1941, Castle Garden was the site of the [[New York City Aquarium]]. For many years, it was the city's most popular attraction, drawing hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.  The structure was extensively altered and roofed over to a height of several stories, though the original masonry fort remained.

In 1941, [[Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority]] Commissioner [[Robert Moses]] wanted to tear the structure down completely, claiming that this was necessary to build the [[Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1941/02/08/archives/battery-aquarium-to-be-demolished-doomed-by-brooklyn-tunnel-it-will.html|title=BATTERY AQUARIUM TO BE DEMOLISHED; Doomed by Brooklyn Tunnel, It Will Be Replaced by a Modern One in Bronx COST PUT AT $2,000,000 Modern Exhibition Technique to Be Utilized to Mirror Nature, Osborn Says|date=February 8, 1941|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 21, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; To expedite construction of the tunnel, the city closed the New York Aquarium and moved its fish to other aquariums in September 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1941/09/23/archives/fish-to-leave-old-home-aquarium-to-start-dispersing-thousands-of.html|title=FISH TO LEAVE OLD HOME; Aquarium to Start Dispersing Thousands of Specimens|date=September 23, 1941|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 21, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moses advocated for the demolition of Castle Clinton,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1942/06/26/archives/aquarium-doomed-by-estimate-board-moses-scoffs-at-proposal-to.html|title=AQUARIUM DOOMED BY ESTIMATE BOARD; Moses Scoffs at Proposal to Restore Old Fort, Saying It 'Never Fired a Shot' MANY PLEAD FOR SAVING IT But the Vote Is 11 to 5 for Demolition to Make Way for Battery Tunnel|date=June 26, 1942|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 22, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; but preservationists who opposed Moses's proposed action asked federal judge to grant an injunction to prevent demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1942/08/20/archives/injunction-sought-to-save-aquarium-suit-today-will-ask-court-to.html|title=INJUNCTION SOUGHT TO SAVE AQUARIUM; Suit Today Will Ask Court to Restrain Moses From Razing Fort Clinton|date=August 20, 1942|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 22, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Moses initially got the injunction dismissed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1943/04/25/archives/moses-wins-fight-to-raze-aquarium-court-of-appeals-has-denied.html|title=MOSES WINS FIGHT TO RAZE AQUARIUM; Court of Appeals Has Denied Injunction Sought by Civic Groups Opposing Him ACTION WAS BEGUN IN 1941 Contest Was Marked by Fierce Exchange Between Park Chief and Pierce T.

However, the aquarium was closed and not replaced until Moses opened a new facility on [[Coney Island]] in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Author: [[Caro, Robert A.]], ''[[The Power Broker]]: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York''.

Although Castle Garden had been designated a national monument, the city still owned the property. In July 1947, the [[New York City Board of Estimate]] voted to demolish Castle Garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1947/07/25/archives/city-votes-death-of-old-aquarium-5year-controversy-is-ended-as.html|title=CITY VOTES DEATH OF OLD AQUARIUM; 5-Year Controversy Is Ended as Board of Estimate Allots $50,000 for Demolition MOSES SCORES A VICTORY Final Blow to Memorial Plan Results From Lack of U.S. Funds for Restoration CITY VOTES DEATH OF OLD AQUARIUM|last=Crowelx|first=Paul|date=1947-07-25|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Board delayed the demolition for another year to allow the federal government to review the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1947/08/28/archives/city-to-give-government-chance-to-prevent-aquarium-demolition-board.html|title=City to Give Government Chance To Prevent Aquarium Demolition; Board of Estimate Agrees to Delay Razing of Castle Clinton to Permit Congress to Vote Funds for Restoration|date=1947-08-28|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1948, the Board voted to demolish the castle for the sixth time in as many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1948/05/28/archives/estimate-board-votes-to-complete-demolition-of-old-aquarium-here.html|title=Estimate Board Votes to Complete Demolition of Old Aquarium Here; DEMOLITION VOTED FOR OLD AQUARIUM|date=1948-05-28|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; After another year of discussion, the [[New York State Assembly]] reversed its decision to allow the castle to be demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1949/03/16/archives/restoration-voted-for-castle-clinton-assembly-committee-clears-bill.html|title=RESTORATION VOTED FOR CASTLE CLINTON; Assembly Committee Clears Bill Making Possible a U.

It is currently administered by the [[National Park Service]] and is a departure point for visitors to the [[Statue of Liberty]] and Ellis Island.  It appears today much as it did in its earliest days; it has a museum and is again called Castle Clinton.{{clear left}}

A '''chief learning officer''' ('''CLO''') is the highest-ranking [[corporate officer]] in charge of learning management. CLOs may be experts in corporate or personal training, with degrees in education, instructional design, business or similar fields.

Qualified CLOs should be able to drive the corporate strategy and align the development of people with the business goals of the organization. A full complement of skills, including business analytics, technology, learning theory, performance consulting and scientific inquiry, are important for success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bersin.com/blog/post.aspx?id=de0e7229-d688-4746-8736-5817482885c8 Bersin by Deloitte: Today's World-Class Chief Learning Officer]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The CLO may report directly to the [[CEO]], but may also report to the Head of [[Human Relations|HR]] or Chief Talent Officer.

==Background==
In the 1990s, [[Jack Welch]], then CEO of [[GE]], made Steve Kerr his CLO, making GE the first company to have such an officer.&lt;ref&gt;"Steve Kerr and His Years with Jack Welch at GE", ''Journal of Management Inquiry'', December 2002, 11: 343-350&lt;/ref&gt; Kerr also became the CLO and Managing Director for [[Goldman Sachs]]

=== Promotion ===
In 2012, Emma Cunis, executive director of the [[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants]] spoke at a CLO summit held in [[Mumbai]]. Cunis was part of a panel that discussed the cost of not investing in executive [[Training and development|learning and development]]. She quoted former General Electric CEO Jack Welch to make her case: "The Jack Welch of the future cannot be like me. I spent my entire career in the United States. The next head of General Electric will be someone who spent time in Bombay, in Hong Kong, in Buenos Aires…. We have to send our best and brightest overseas and make sure they have the training that will allow them to be global leaders who will make GE flourish in the future."&lt;ref&gt;[http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/india/article.cfm?articleid=4716 Wharton University: "India Learns the Value of the Chief Learning Officer"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Learning techniques==
There are four types of learning techniques that may be employed by CLOs (Elkeles &amp; Phillips, 2007):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jack, Tamar|first1=Phillips, Elkeles|title=The Chief Learning Officer|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vb8JBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=ko&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Coaching
: Coaching refers to the training and development process wherein the CLO will support and train an individual or team in achieving a specific skill, competence, or goal. The individual or team receiving the coaching may be referred to as the coachee(s) (Flaherty, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flaherty|first1=James|title=Coaching: Evoking Excellence in Others|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Nfv94keo5cC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22James+Flaherty%22&amp;hl=ko&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ObVSVNGaF83xavS5gvAM&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|website=Google e-book|publisher=Elsevier Inc|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:The higher value for a CLO, relative to coaching, is to create a culture of coaching. All managers should become proficient coaches, and data on personal performance and contribution should be available to them. The more informed they are, the better coaches they can be.
; Engagement
: Engagement refers to the process of being psychologically invested in the learning process. It is often seen as an indicator of success in learning and the CLO will often attempt to maximize engagement of students and measure engagement during a variety of different learning tasks in order to rate their effectiveness (Christenson et.al., 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Christenson, Wylie, Reschly|first1=Sandra, Cathy, Amy|title=Handbook of Research on Student Engagement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7LSxRvDF-RgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=ko&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media.|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Many CHROs have found the engagement surveys to be less than useful, because: they capture only a point in time, you tend to only find out what's wrong, the cycle time from survey to action is often long enough to make taking action irrelevant. 
; Mentoring
: Mentoring refers to a personal development relationship in which one more experienced individual will assist a less experienced learning in acquiring a new skill, ability, or competency. This process involves communication and is relationship based. It may be said to include formal transfers of knowledge, social capital, and psychological support (Clutterbuck &amp; Garvey, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clutterbuck, Garvey|first1=David, Bob|title=Mentoring in Action: A Practical Guide for Managers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9IO4CgMVREC&amp;pgis=1&amp;redir_esc=y|publisher=Kogan Page Publishers|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Management training
: Management training activities are those activities which specifically relate to improving the management of people. CLOs may also be responsible for providing training and measuring success of skills and competencies related to management functions (Bonner, 2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bonner|first1=Ded|title=Leading Knowledge Management and Learning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ISWqgaRpaAwC&amp;pgis=1&amp;redir_esc=y|publisher=American Society for Training and Development|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement techniques==
Measurement techniques refer to how CLOs measure learning outcome success. These may take several forms and can include standardized tests, one-to-one interviews and discussions with individuals receiving learning assistance, surveys and questionnaires, and measured competency at various tasks before and after the learning activity (Rani, 2004; Rauner &amp; Maclean, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rani|first1=T. Swarupa|title=Educational Measurement and Evaluation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CRt893qk8c4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=ko&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=Discovery Publishing House|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The aim of the use of these measurement techniques is to quantify the success of the learning activity. This allows the CLO to adapt learning activities in future to increase the level of successful outcomes (Jonassen et al., 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jonassen, Spector, Driscoll, Merrill, Merrienboer|first1=David, Michael, Marcy, M.David, Jeroen|title=Handbook of Research for Educational Communications and Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GgCPAgAAQBAJ&amp;pgis=1&amp;redir_esc=y|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology used==
A wide variety of different technologies may be used by CLOs in order to meet their learning objectives. Popular technologies used include the use of computer software to deliver lessons and tests. Additionally, internet based learning may be used to provide learning at remote locations and enable students to engage with lessons remotely (Iskander, 2008; Facer, 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Iskander|first1=Magued|title=Innovative Techniques in Instruction Technology, E-learning, E-assessment and Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ngQH8S7Zx0gC&amp;pgis=1&amp;redir_esc=y|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media.|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctoral Program==
The [[University of Pennsylvania]] has their own Doctoral Program under their Graduate School of Education called the PennCLO Executive Doctoral Program. It specially prepares the Chief Learning Officers and other senior-level Human Capital Executives for success in their role as learning and talent development leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pennclo.com/ PennCLO: Executive Doctoral Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

==CLO Data==
There is scant data when it comes to the CLO position, considering that the position has only existed since 1991. In terms of salary, [[Indeed.com]] reports that the average salary is roughly  $81,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indeed.com/salary?q1=Chief+Learning+Officer&amp;l1=]&lt;/ref&gt; per year, as of May 2015. According to a CLO survey conducted in April 2015,&lt;ref&gt;[http://elearningmind.com/chief-learning-officer/ Chief Learning Officer Industry Survey 2015: Infographic]&lt;/ref&gt; roughly 45% of CLOs are female, which is a remarkably strong number for female representation in the c-suite. As a comparison, just  3%&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strategyand.pwc.com/media/file/Strategyand_The-2013-Chief-Executive-Study.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; of CEOs are female, according to Pricewaterhouse Coopers.

==Role within the C-Suite==
The chief learning officer often works alongside the CEO and collaborates on his or her vision for instituting learning and development initiatives throughout the company. Occasionally the CLO will work closely with the [[chief technology officer]], because much of L&amp;D involves technological advancement. The [[chief knowledge officer]] will also assist the CLO in disseminating knowledge for employees to learn and apply. The chief culture officer will assist the CLO with any culture-based programs or initiatives, though most companies do not have a CCO at the moment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3632">'''Contract city''' is a term used in some [[U.S. state]]s for a city that contracts one or more municipal services to another unit of government, or to a private or commercial organization.  Most of the contracts are for police or fire / rescue / paramedic services to the county in which the city lies.

In the traditional method, ''franchising'', a private company has a [[government-granted monopoly|franchise]], or legal right, to perform certain public services normally done by municipal government. Cities of all kinds have entered into contracts for non-core governmental services, such as facilities and grounds maintenance, auditing, legal counsel, road construction, garbage collection, water and waste water treatment, engineering services, animal control, and others. Such cities rely on the private sector to provide public service delivery, while the public sector maintains oversight. Public officials are specifically responsible for writing, signing, managing and enforcing contracts.

Another method of contracting is for the city to contract with its county government or with neighboring cities to provide municipal services such as police and public safety, libraries, or parks and recreation. 

In contrast, independent cities are cities which provide basic governmental services themselves, without contracting (this usage is not to be confused with the more common usage of [[independent city]] as a city that is not part of any [[County (United States)|county]]). Most older cities are independent cities. In practice, many cities are hybrids of both. For instance, they may directly operate parks programs, but contract with the county for police and fire services. Most contract cities do their own [[land use planning]], since cities were incorporated to exert local control over land use.

==History==
In 1954, [[Lakewood, California]], became the first city to contract with its county for public services. The previously [[unincorporated area]] was facing a hostile annexation from adjacent [[Long Beach, California]], and residents favored retaining local control while maintaining the existing services provided by [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]]. The so-called Lakewood Plan has been the model for most new contract cities incorporated since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasdhq.org/lasd_services/contract_law/index.html |title=Welcome to contract law enforcement |work=Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department |accessdate=28 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130304185244/http://www.lasdhq.org/lasd_services/contract_law/index.html |archivedate=4 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years there has been a significant increase in the number of contract cities. Several that have received attention from the media include:

The term '''course of performance''' is defined in the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;(a) A "course of performance" is a sequence of conduct between the parties to a particular transaction that exists if:
:(1) the agreement of the parties with respect to the transaction involves repeated occasions for performance by a party; and 
:(2) the other party, with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity for objection to it, accepts the performance or acquiesces in it without objection.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/1/1-303 UCC § 1-303(a)]. "[[Course of dealing]]," as defined in [UCC §&amp;nbsp;1-303] subsection (b), is restricted, literally, to a sequence of conduct between the parties previous to the agreement. A sequence of conduct after or under the agreement, however, is a "course of performance."&lt;ref&gt;Cmt. 2, UCC §&amp;nbsp;1-303.&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a contract involves repeated occasions for performance and opportunity for objection "any course of performance accepted or acquiesced in without objection shall be relevant to determine the meaning of the agreement."&lt;ref&gt;UCC 2-208[1].&lt;/ref&gt; "[S]uch course of performance shall be relevant to show a waiver or modification of any term inconsistent with such course of performance."&lt;ref&gt;UCC 2-208[3].&lt;/ref&gt; This UCC section recognizes that the "parties themselves know best what they have meant by their words of agreement and their action under that agreement is the best indication of what that meaning was."&lt;ref&gt;UCC 2-208, cmt, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is well established that a written contract may be modified by the parties' post-agreement "course of performance." &lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Rose v. Spa Realty Assocs.'', 42 N.Y.2d 338, 397 N.Y.S.2d 922, 366 N.E.2d 1279 (1977); ''GE Capital Commer. Auto. Fin. v. Spartan Motors, Ltd.'', 246 A.D.2d 41, 52, 675 N.Y.S.2d 626, 634 (App. Div. 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

A waiver that changes the express terms of a contract can be established by evidence of a course of performance. This holds true even for contracts that are fully integrated. The policy behind this "broad doctrine of waiver" in contract law is to "prevent the waiving party from 'lull[ing] another into a false assurance that strict compliance with a contractual duty will not be required and then sue for noncompliance.'&amp;#8239;"&lt;ref&gt;''Midwest Builder Distrib. v. Lord &amp; Essex'', 383 Ill. App. 3d 645, 674, 322 Ill. Dec. 371, 398, 891 N.E.2d 1, 28 (2007); ''Whalen v. K Mart Corp.'', 166 Ill. App. 3d 339, 343, 519 N.E.2d 991, 116 Ill. Dec. 776 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not necessary that the contract be ambiguous before course of performance will be considered.&lt;ref&gt;''Feinberg v. Federated Dept. Stores, Inc.'', 15 Misc. 3d 299, 300, 832 N.Y.S.2d 760, 761 (Sup. Ct. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

A course of dealing is shown by repeated instances of the relevant conduct, not single occasions or actions.&lt;ref&gt;''Dallas. Aero., Inc. v. CIS Air Corp.'', 352 F.3d 775, 783 (2d Cir. 2003); ''Cravotta v. Deggingers' Foundry, Inc.'', 288 P.3d 871 (Kan. Ct. App. 2012); ''Estate of Polushkin v. Maw'', 170 P.3d 162, 171 (Alaska 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''[[Credit (finance)|credit]] note''' or '''credit memorandum (memo)''' is a commercial document issued by a [[seller]] to a [[buyer]]. Credit notes act as a [[Source document]] for the Sales return journal. In other words the credit note is evidence of the reduction in sales. 

It can also be a document from a [[bank]] to a [[depositor]] to indicate the depositor's balance is being in event other than a deposit, such as the collection by the bank of the depositor's note receivable.

== Features ==

A credit note lists the products, quantities and agreed prices for products or services the seller provided the buyer, but the buyer returned or did not receive. It may be issued in the case of damaged goods, errors or allowances. In respect of the previously issued invoice, a Credit Memo will reduce or eliminate the amount the buyer has to pay. ''Note:'' A Credit Memo is not to be substituted as a formal document. The Credit Memo rarely contains: PO #, Date, Billing Address, Shipping Address, Terms of Payment, List of products with quantities and prices. Usually it references the original Invoice and sometimes states the reason for issue.

This is received if the goods are incomplete, damaged, or not as per specification; customers may also receive one if they paid too much money, or if they had been overcharged.

== Uses ==

* To allow the buyer to purchase an item or service from that seller on a future date, i.e. a [[gift card]] or store card credit. Credit notes may be issued by a seller as a goodwill gesture to a buyer who wishes to return previously purchased merchandise (instead of cash repayment) in circumstances where the original sales agreement did not include an explicit refund policy for returned items. In such circumstances, a credit note of value equal to the price of the returned item is usually issued allowing the buyer to exchange his purchase for other items available with the sale.

Koch|Charles]], in 1983, and served as an executive vice president until his retirement in 2018.&lt;ref name="asgbio"&gt;[http://www.theadvocates.org/celebrities/david-koch.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226111813/http://www.theadvocates.org/celebrities/david-koch.html|date=February 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon retirement in June 2018 due to health issues, Koch received the title of Director Emeritus.

He was the 1980 candidate for [[Vice President of the United States]] from the [[United States Libertarian Party]] and helped finance the campaign. He founded [[Citizens for a Sound Economy]].&lt;ref name=Mazur&gt;Suzan Mazur, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wk2FfQQ_DmsC&amp;lpg=PA244&amp;dq=David%20H.%20Koch&amp;pg=PA244#v=onepage&amp;q=David%20H.%20Koch&amp;f=false "The Altenberg 16: An Exposé of the Evolution Industry"], ''North Atlantic Books'', 2010, 343 pages&lt;/ref&gt;  He and his brother Charles have donated to political advocacy groups&lt;ref name="Wallet" /&gt; and to political campaigns, almost entirely [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=D000000186&amp;cycle=A |title=Koch Industries: Summary |publisher=OpenSecrets.org |accessdate=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2018, he was ranked as the 12th-richest person in the world, (tied with his brother Charles), with a fortune of $50.7 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/david-koch/|title=David Koch|accessdate=June 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Portfolio.com|Condé Nast Portfolio]]'' described him as "one of the most generous but low-key philanthropists in America".&lt;ref name="Weiss"&gt;Weiss, Gary, [http://www.portfolio.com/executives/features/2008/10/15/Profile-of-Billionaire-David-Koch/ "The Price of Immortality"], ''[[Portfolio.com|Condé Nast Portfolio]]'', November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Koch has contributed to several charities including [[Lincoln Center]], [[Sloan Kettering]], [[New York-Presbyterian Hospital]] and the Dinosaur Wing at the [[American Museum of Natural History]].&lt;ref name=Mazur/&gt; The New York State Theater at Lincoln Center, home of the [[New York City Ballet]], was renamed the [[David H.

==Early life and education==
Koch was born in [[Wichita, Kansas]], the son of Mary Clementine (née Robinson) and [[Fred C. Koch|Fred Chase Koch]], a chemical engineer. David's paternal grandfather, [[Harry Koch (businessman)|Harry Koch]], was a Dutch immigrant who founded the Quanah Tribune-Chief newspaper and was a founding shareholder of [[Quanah, Acme and Pacific Railway]].&lt;ref name="new netherland"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nnp.org/nni/Publications/Dutch-American/kochd.htm |title=Koch, David Hamilton (1940) |publisher=New Netherland Project |accessdate=August 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; David is the third of four sons, with elder brothers [[Frederick R. Koch]], Charles Koch, and nineteen-minute younger twin&lt;ref name="kochbtp"/&gt; [[Bill Koch (businessman)|Bill Koch]]. Among his maternal great-great-grandparents were [[William Ingraham Kip]], an Episcopalian bishop, [[William Burnet Kinney]], a politician, and [[Elizabeth Clementine Stedman]], a writer.

Koch attended the [[Deerfield Academy]] prep school in Massachusetts, graduating in 1959. He went on to the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), earning both a [[bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] (1962) and a [[master's degree]] (1963) in [[chemical engineering]]. He is a member of the [[Beta Theta Pi]] Fraternity. Koch played basketball at MIT, averaging 21 points per game at MIT over three years, a school record. He also held the single-game scoring record of 41 points from 1962 until 2009, when it was eclipsed by [[Jimmy Bartolotta]].&lt;ref name="kochbtp"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/114135/david-and-william-koch-mit-basketball-players |title=David and William Koch as MIT Basketball Players |journal=The New Republic |date=August 14, 2013 |accessdate=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career at Koch Industries==
In 1970, Koch joined [[Koch Industries]] under his brother Charles, to work as a technical-services manager. He founded the company's New York office and in 1979 he became the president of his own division, Koch Engineering, renamed Chemical Technology Group. In 1985, Koch Industries was sued by [[Bill Koch (businessman)|Bill Koch]] and [[Frederick R. Koch]] for the first time in a long series of lawsuits about ownership, that lasted until 2001. As of 2010, David Koch owned 42 percent of Koch Industries, as does his brother Charles.&lt;ref name=Wallet/&gt; He holds 4 U.S patents.

On June 5, 2018, the company announced his retirement from the company due to declining health issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2018/06/05/david-koch-is-leaving-koch-industries-stepping-down-from-americans-for-prosperity/|title=David Koch is leaving Koch Industries, stepping down from Americans for Prosperity|first=James|last=Hohmann |date=June 5, 2018|publisher=|accessdate=June 5, 2018|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
Koch was the [[United States Libertarian Party|Libertarian Party]]'s [[Vice President of the United States|vice-presidential]] candidate in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1980|1980 presidential election]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Man Without a Candidate |authorlink=Charlotte Curtis |first=Charlotte |last=Curtis |date=October 16, 1984 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/16/arts/man-without-a-candidate.html |accessdate=July 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; sharing the party ticket with [[President of the United States|presidential]] candidate [[Ed Clark]]. The Clark–Koch [[Ticket (election)|ticket]] promised to abolish [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], the [[Federal Reserve Board]], [[welfare]], [[minimum-wage]] laws, corporate taxes, all price supports and subsidies for agriculture and business, and [[U.S. Federal agencies]] including the SEC, EPA, ICC, FTC, OSHA, FBI, CIA, and DOE.&lt;ref name="Mayer" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Buck&gt;Rinker Buck, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ueUCAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=David%20Koch&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q=David%20Koch&amp;f=false "How Those Libertarians Pay the Bills"], [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]], November 3, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; The ticket received 921,128 votes, 1% of the total nationwide vote,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1980&amp;off=0&amp;f=1|title=1980 Presidential General Election Results|author=David Leip|work=uselectionatlas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Libertarian Party national ticket's best showing until [[U.S. presidential election, 2016|2016]] in terms of percentage and its best showing in terms of raw votes until the [[U.S. presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential election]], although that number was surpassed again in 2016.&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;James T.

After the bid, according to journalist [[Brian Doherty (journalist)|Brian Doherty]]'s ''[[Radicals for Capitalism]]'', Koch viewed politicians as "actors playing out a script".&lt;ref name=Mayer/&gt;&lt;ref name="Doherty2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Doherty|first=Brian |authorlink=Brian Doherty (journalist)|title=Radicals for Capitalism: A Freewheeling History of the Modern American Libertarian Movement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6g_NGAAACAAJ|accessdate=October 10, 2011|date=May 26, 2008|publisher=Perseus Books Group|isbn=978-1-58648-572-6|page=410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koch credits the campaign of [[Roger MacBride]] as his inspiration for getting involved in politics:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Here was a great guy, advocating all the things I believed in. He wanted less government and taxes, and was talking about repealing all these victimless crime laws that accumulated on the books. I have friends who smoke pot. I know many homosexuals. It's ridiculous to treat them as criminals—and here was someone running for president, saying just that.&lt;ref name=Buck/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Koch gave his own Vice Presidential campaign $100,000 a month after being chosen as [[Ed Clark]]'s running mate. "We'd like to abolish the [[Federal Elections Commission]] and all the limits on campaign spending anyway," Koch said in 1980. When asked why he ran, he replied: "Lord knows I didn't need a job, but I believe in what the Libertarians are saying. I suppose if they hadn't come along, I could have been a big Republican from [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]]. But hell—''everybody'' from Kansas is a Republican."&lt;ref name=Buck/&gt;

In 1984 he broke with the Libertarian Party when it supported eliminating all taxes.  Since then, Koch has been a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]].&lt;ref name=Wallet/&gt;{{rp|4}}

In July 2015 David Koch and his brother were commended by both President Obama and activist [[Van Jones|Anthony Van Jones]] for their bipartisan efforts to reform the prison system in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nelson|first=Colleen Mccain; Fields, Gary |title=Obama, Koch Brothers in Unlikely Alliance to Overhaul Criminal Justice|work=Wall Street Journal|date=July 16, 2015 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/obama-koch-brothers-in-unlikely-alliance-to-overhaul-criminal-justice-1437090737}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wapos&gt;{{cite web|last=Horwitz|first=Sari|title=Unlikely Allies|work=Washington Post|date=August 15, 2015 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2015/08/15/clemency-the-issue-that-obama-and-the-koch-brothers-actually-agree-on/}}&lt;/ref&gt; For nearly ten years the Kochs have been advocating for several reforms within the criminal justice system which include reducing recidivism rates, simplifying the employment process for the rehabilitated, and defending private property from government seizures through [[asset forfeiture]].&lt;ref name=wapos/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cjonline.com/news/2015-10-15/forfeiture-reform-aligns-likes-billionaire-charles-koch-aclu |title=Forfeiture reform aligns likes of billionaire Charles Koch, ACLU|work=The Topeka Capital Journal |date=October 15, 2015|author=Hudetz, Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allying with groups such as  the [[ACLU]], the [[Center for American Progress]], [[Families Against Mandatory Minimums]], the [[Coalition for Public Safety]], and the [[John D. and Catherine T.

== Criticism and recognition==

In August 2010, [[Jane Mayer]] wrote an article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' on the political spending of David and Charles Koch stating: "As their fortunes grew, Charles and David Koch became the primary underwriters of hard-line libertarian politics in America."&lt;ref name="Mayer" /&gt; Mayer's article was criticized by conservatives for not enumerating the Kochs' charitable donations.&lt;ref name=Continetti/&gt;&lt;ref name="lewis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicsdaily.com/2010/09/02/koch-brothers-give-more-to-charity-than-to-right-wing-causes |title=Koch Brothers Donate to Charity as well as Right Wing Causes |last=Lewis |first=Matt |date=September 2, 2010 |publisher=[[AOL News]] |work=[[Politics Daily]] |accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mayer's article was also criticized by Koch Industries as using "psycho-biographic innuendo, unnamed sources, and half-truths".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nick|first=Gillespie|title=The Official Koch Industries Reply to The New Yorker Hit Piece|url=http://reason.com/blog/2010/08/25/the-official-koch-industries-r|work=reason.com|publisher=reason.com|accessdate=October 10, 2011|date=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An opinion piece by journalist [[Yasha Levine]] in the ''[[New York Observer]]'' said Mayer's article failed to mention that the Kochs' "free market philanthropy belies the immense profit they have made from corporate welfare".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://observer.com/2010/09/7-ways-the-koch-bros-benefit-from-corporate-welfare/ |last=Levine |first=Yasha |authorlink=Yasha Levine|date=September 1, 2010| title=7 Ways the Koch Bros.

Dennis, president and chief executive officer of the [[Searle Freedom Trust]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bov.gmu.edu/bios/dennis.html|title=George Mason University Board of Visitors: Kimberly Dennis|accessdate=December 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; said in 2010 that the Kochs are acting against their economic interest in promoting "getting government out of the business of running the economy. If they were truly interested in protecting their profits, they wouldn't be spending so much to shrink government; they'd be looking for a bigger slice of the pie for themselves. Their funding is devoted to promoting free-market capitalism, not crony capitalism."&lt;ref name="dennis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/253323/democrats-cant-blame-koch-brothers-however-much-they-might-want-kimberly-o-dennis |title=Democrats Can't Blame the Koch Brothers (However Much They Might Want To) |last=Dennis |first=Kimberly O. |date=November 15, 2010 |publisher=[[National Review Online]] |accessdate=January 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|reason=evidence  of significant coverage of this view in reliable sources?

In 2011 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' included Charles and David Koch among the [[Time 100]] of the year, for their involvement in supporting the [[Tea Party movement]] and the criticism they received from liberals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ferguson|first=Andrew|title=The 2011 TIME 100|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2066367_2066369_2066324,00.html|work=TIME|accessdate=April 22, 2011 |date=April 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Koch was diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]]. He underwent radiation, surgery, and hormone therapy, but the cancer has returned every time. Koch has said he believes his experience with cancer has encouraged him to fund medical research.&lt;ref name=Continetti/&gt;

The '''Donald J. Trump Foundation''' was a New York-based [[private foundation]] founded and chaired by [[Donald Trump]], 45th [[President of the United States]].  

Trump originally created the foundation to his proceeds from his book ''[[Trump: The Art of the Deal]]'' to charitable causes''.''  However Trump stopped contributing personal funds to the foundation in 2008 and instead solicited donations from outsiders.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

During the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election campaign]] the foundation's activities came under intense media scrutiny, initially by the ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'s'' [[David Fahrenthold]], who went on to win the 2017 [[Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting]] for his investigatory work.  The foundation and its directors have since been accused of committing various ethical and legal violations, including [[self-dealing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|author=David A.

On June 14, 2018, New York Attorney General [[Barbara Underwood]] filed [[civil suit]] against President Donald Trump and his three eldest children, [[Donald Trump Jr.|Donald, Jr.]], [[Ivanka Trump|Ivanka]], and [[Eric Trump|Eric]], alleging "persistently illegal conduct" with respect to foundation money, accusing them of engaging in campaign finance violations, using foundation money in their self-interest ("self-dealing"), and illegally coordinating donations with Donald Trump's presidential campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/07/new-york-state-opens-tax-probe-into-trump-foundation.html|title=New York State Opens Tax Probe Into Trump Foundation|last=Hartmann|first=Margaret|work=Daily Intelligencer|access-date=2018-07-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She ordered the charity dissolved and demanded $2.8 million in restitution and penalties.

==Overview==

=== Purpose and structure ===
Donald Trump established the Donald J.

Until 2017 the [[board of directors]] consisted of Donald Trump, his three adult children, and Trump Organization treasurer/CFO [[Allen Weisselberg]] (although in 2017 Weisselberg claimed to investigators he wasn't even aware he was a board member "at least for the last 10 or 15 years").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/ex_6.pdf|title=In the Matter of The Investigation of The Donald J Trump Foundation, Inc., Exhibit 6|last=Schneiderman|first=Eric|date=July 19, 2018|website=ag.ny.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theweek.com/speedreads/779101/trump-foundations-treasurer-didnt-know-treasurer-until-investigators-told|title=The Trump Foundation's treasurer didn't know he was treasurer until investigators told him|date=2018-06-14|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/30/opinion/an-uncharitable-foundation.html?_r=0|title=An Uncharitable Foundation|last=Sugin|first=Linda|date=September 30, 2016|work=The New York Times|accessdate=October 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, a Trump Organization spokesperson told the [[New York Post|''New York Post'']] that Trump made all decisions regarding the granting of Trump Foundation money.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

In the 2018 lawsuit the [[Attorney General of New York|New York Attorney General]] alleged that the Foundation's board of directors had not met since 1999.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

Like many other private foundations, the foundation conducted no charitable programs of its own. Instead, it granted money to other tax-exempt organizations.&lt;ref name="Tebow" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SearchingforEvid"&gt;{{Cite web|authors= David A.

=== Sources of funds ===
Through 2015, Trump contributed $5.5 million to the Trump Foundation while outside donors contributed an additional $9.3 million.&lt;ref name="Retooled" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;  Trump's final gift to the foundation was $35,000 in 2008.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2015/12/13/trump-hasnt-contributed-to-his-own-foundation-in-years/|title=Trump hasn't contributed to his own foundation in years|last=Vincent|first=Isabel|last2=Klein|first2=Melissa|date=December 13, 2015|website=New York Post|access-date=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many of the outside donors to the foundation have done business with Trump or the [[The Trump Organization|Trump Organization]].&lt;ref name="WaPoMissing" /&gt; Several philanthropy experts noted that having a family foundation without any family money is unusual.&lt;ref name="Retooled" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPoMissing" /&gt;

The top donors to the foundation from 2004 to 2014 were [[Vince McMahon|Vince]] and [[Linda McMahon]] of [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE).  They jointly donated $5 million to the foundation after Trump appeared at [[WrestleMania]] in 2007 and 2009.&lt;ref name="WaPoMissing"&gt;{{Cite web|authors=David A. Fahrenthold &amp; Rosalind S.

=== Dissolution ===
In September 2016 the [[Attorney General of New York|New York Attorney General]]'s office, which administers the state's [https://charitiesnys.com Charities Bureau], announced it was investigating the Trump Foundation based on its failure to file required forms with the bureau.  One week later the office issued a "Notice of Violation".&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt;

In December 2016, one month before his inauguration, then [[President-elect of the United States|President-Elect]] Trump announced that he would dissolve the Trump Foundation to avoid "even the appearance of any conflict with [his] role as President".&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/24/trump-university-shut-down-conflict-of-interest|title=Donald Trump to dissolve his charitable foundation after mounting complaints|last=Jacobs|first=Ben|date=2016-12-24|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2016-12-25|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Attorney General of New York|New York Attorney General]]'s office, however, blocked the dissolution, stating that the foundation "cannot legally dissolve" until its current investigation is completed.&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/24/us/politics/trump-family-conflicts.html|title=Denying Conflict, Trump Family Tries to Resolve Potential Problems|last=Lipton|first=Eric|date=2016-12-24|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2016-12-25|last2=Haberman|first2=Maggie|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In June 2018 the same office filed a civil lawsuit against the Trump Foundation and its board members ordering, among other requirements, that it be shut down and that restitution be made by its board members.  The office also referred possible legal violations to the [[Federal Election Commission]] and the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]].&lt;ref name=":31"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/policy/finance/392323-new-york-ags-office-trump-foundation-warrants-investigation-by-fec-irs|title=New York AG's office: Trump Foundation warrants investigation by FEC, IRS|last=Jagoda|first=Naomi|date=2018-06-14|work=TheHill|access-date=2018-07-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following month, the New York State Governor's chief counsel announced that [[Andrew Cuomo|Governor Cuomo]] was ready to provide the state's Attorney General's office with the requisite criminal referral in the matter for possible criminal prosecution under state law.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

== Investigations by ''The Washington Post'' and others ==
During the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 U.S. presidential election]], [[David Fahrenthold]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' initiated an investigation into Trump's history of charitable giving after Trump had held a fundraiser for veterans in January 2016 in lieu of appearing at a televised Republican debate. Trump claimed that the event raised $6,000,000 for veteran's causes, including purportedly $1,000,000 of his own money.&lt;ref name="WaPoVets" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":35"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2016-01-28/skipping-gop-debate-trump-headlines-event-for-veterans|title=Skipping GOP Debate-Trump Headlines Event For Veterans|last=|first=|date=January 28, 2016|website=|publisher=USA Today|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/what-ever-happened-to-all-that-money-trump-raised-for-the-veterans/2016/03/03/fbafd9a0-e0b2-11e5-8d98-4b3d9215ade1_story.html|title=What ever happened to all that money Trump raised for the veterans?|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPoVets" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":35" /&gt; Fahrenthold began his investigation by attempting to verify the receipt and disbursal of the $6,000,000.   All donations were supposed to have gone into the Trump Foundation and then granted by the foundation to others.  Fahrenthold determined instead that, several months after the rally, the Trump Foundation had yet to disburse funds to any veteran-related charities.&lt;ref name="WaPoVets" /&gt;  Although some of the funds went directly to causes without passing through the Trump Foundation, Fahrenthold widened his investigation into a larger investigation into Trump's history of charitable giving.&lt;ref name = "Pulitzer" /&gt;

In June 2016, in response to criticism, Trump asserted publicly that he had given approximately $102 million to charitable causes from 2009 through 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/trump-and-the-truth-his-charitable-giving|title=Trump and the Truth: His Charitable Giving|date=2016-09-24|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and released a 93-page list of the beneficiaries of the money.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2016/06/29/have-given-more-cash-to-charity-than-donald-trump.html|title=Have You Given More Cash to Charity Than Donald Trump?|date=2016-06-29|newspaper=Fox Business|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequent reporting by the ''Post'' and other news organizations found that many of the donations Trump claimed as having made personally over this 5-year period were made by the Trump Foundation, which by 2009, no longer held any money donated by Trump.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;  Further investigations led to an increasing list of allegations of abuse inside the foundation since its creation.&lt;ref name="WaPo258000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FahrentholdPainting2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPoDirected" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-foundation-lacks-the-certification-required-for-charities-that-solicit-money/2016/09/29/7dac6a68-8658-11e6-ac72-a29979381495_story.html|title=Trump Foundation lacks the certification required for charities that solicit money|website=Washington Post|access-date=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fahrenthold's investigation into the Trump Foundation and Trump's history of personal charitable giving involved hundreds of calls to charities associated with Donald Trump; it was also notable in that he drew heavily on support and investigative help from a large number of his [[Twitter|Twitter followers]] who helped him track down leads on specific charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/13/media/david-fahrenthold-washington-post-donald-trump/index.html|title=The secrets of David Fahrenthold's reporting on the Trump Foundation|last=Stelter|first=Brian|date=2016-09-13|website=CNNMoney|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fahrenthold received the 2017 [[Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting]] for his investigations into the Trump Foundation.&lt;ref name="Pulitzer"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/david-fahrenthold-wins-pulitzer-prize-2017-winner-finalists/|title=Washington Post's David Fahrenthold wins Pulitzer Prize for coverage of Trump's charitable giving|date=April 10, 2017|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Legal affairs of Donald Trump}}

Accusations against Trump and his foundation include the following:

=== Failure to maintain proper governance ===
In a June 2018 petition filed by the office of the [[Attorney General of New York|New York Attorney General]], it was explained that:
{{quote|"...none of the Foundation's expenditures or activities were approved by its Board of Directors.&amp;nbsp; The investigation found that the Board existed in name only: it did not meet after 1999; it did not set policy or criteria for choosing grant recipients; and it did not approve of any grants. Mr. Trump alone made all decisions related to the Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/attorney-general-underwood-announces-lawsuit-against-donald-j-trump-foundation-and-its|title=Attorney General Underwood Announces Lawsuit Against Donald J. Trump Foundation And Its Board Of Directors For Extensive And Persistent Violations Of State And Federal Law {{!}} New York State Attorney General|website=ag.ny.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In an [https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/ex_6.pdf exhibit attached to the filing], Trump Foundation treasurer Allen Weisselberg claimed he hadn't been aware that he treasurer or on the board of the foundation until he was approached by investigators.

=== Solicitation of donations without a license ===
Under New York State law, a not-for-profit foundation must register as a "7A Charitable Organization" if it plans to solicit outside donations in excess of $25,000 in any year.&lt;ref name="licensing"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-foundation-lacks-the-certification-required-for-charities-that-solicit-money/2016/09/29/7dac6a68-8658-11e6-ac72-a29979381495_story.html|title=Donald J. Trump Foundation not certified as charity in New York|last=Farenthold|first=David A.|date=September 29, 2016|access-date=September 30, 2016|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trump Foundation was initially registered as a private foundation set up solely to receive his own personal donations.  As long as it was registered as a private foundation and not soliciting outside funds, it did not have to file annual audited reports with the New York State Charities Bureau&lt;ref name="licensing" /&gt; However, records show that Trump began soliciting donations at least as early as 2004&lt;ref name="licensing" /&gt; and possibly as early as 1989.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/08/trump-files-when-donald-shook-down-mike-tyson-2-million|title=The time Donald Trump tried to shake down Mike Tyson for $2 million|newspaper=Mother Jones|access-date=October 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mishandling of funds raised for veteran's causes ===
In April 2016, [[Fox News]] reported that, more than two months after Trump said he had raised $6 million for military veterans at a pre-[[Iowa caucus]] fundraiser, "most of the organizations targeted to receive the money have gotten less than half of that amount."&lt;ref name="FoxNewsDJTF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/04/08/veterans-charities-reportedly-receive-fraction-money-raised-by-trump-event.html|title=Veterans' charities reportedly receive fraction of money raised by Trump event|date=April 8, 2016|publisher=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Around that time, Trump also said he had contributed $1,000,000 of his personal funds.&lt;ref name="WaPoVets"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/05/30/tomorrow-trump-will-give-more-details-about-his-donations-to-vets-heres-what-we-still-dont-know|title=Trump announced his gifts to veterans. Here's what we learned|date=May 31, 2016|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late May, Trump revised his figures downward, saying that $5.6 million had been raised at the event and that he had contributed his $1,000,000 share only the previous week, after the media criticized him.&lt;ref name="WaPoVets" /&gt; He also provided a list of the beneficiaries of the $5.6 million, although the full amount is further disputed in a lawsuit filed by New York State in 2018, which cites an amount of $2.8 million&lt;ref&gt;[https://assets.donaldjtrump.com/veteran-fundraiser.pdf Donald J.

=== Coordinating foundation grants with Trump's presidential campaign ===
Trump may have used Trump Foundation grants to advance his presidential campaign, in violation of rules barring charities from engaging in political activity.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/08/watchdog-group-files-complaint-with-irs-against-trump-foundation.html|title=Watchdog Group Files Complaint With IRS Against Trump Foundation|last=Mak|first=Andrew Desiderio{{!}}Tim|date=August 8, 2016|website=The Daily Beast|access-date=October 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trump distributed at least some of the funds publicly at "Donald Trump for President" political rallies, displaying large-size donation checks that included his campaign slogan "[[Make America Great Again]]" or a link to a campaign website.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/137522/trumps-charity-tells-us-lot-business|title=Trump's Charity Tells Us a Lot About His Business|last=Hackney|first=Philip|date=October 6, 2016|website=New Republic|access-date=October 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump Organization CFO Allen Weissberg testified in an October 2017 [https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/ex_6.pdf deposition] that he witnessed Donald Trump's campaign staff coordinate with Trump to use the Iowa fundraiser to benefit the campaign.   In 2018, [[New York State Attorney General]] [[Barbara Underwood]] alleged in a larger suit against the foundation that Trump, in using the foundation to promote his campaign during and after the Iowa fundraiser, had violated charities laws.&lt;ref name=":37" /&gt;

=== Grants to the National Museum of Catholic Art and Library ===
In each of 1995 and 1999, the Trump Foundation granted $50,000 to the National Museum of Catholic Art and Library.  A 2001 report by ''[[The Village Voice]]'' stated, after visiting the museum in [[East Harlem]], that the facility had "next to no art" and no official connection to the [[Catholic Church|Catholic church]], despite having had a 10-year track record of soliciting large-scale donations for its collection.  The ''Voice'' and, later, ''The Washington Post'', concluded that Trump may have directed the grants to the museum to curry favor with the museum's then chairman, Eddie Malloy, who was also head of the [[Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York]]. The Council had worked on behalf of one of the unions of workers who worked on Trump construction projects.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-boasts-of-his-philanthropy-but-his-giving-falls-short-of-his-words/2016/10/29/b3c03106-9ac7-11e6-a0ed-ab0774c1eaa5_story.html|title=Trump boasts about his philanthropy.

=== Failure to make pledged 9/11 donations ===
An investigation by the [[New York City Comptroller]]'s office in October 2016 showed that Trump and/or the Donald Trump Foundation may have failed to honor at least one pledge to charities established to provide relief for victims of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks]]. Trump had made a pledge of $10,000 to the Twin Towers Fund on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' in late September 2001.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/donald-trump-lied-donating-9-11-charities-article-1.2829908|title=Donald Trump may have lied about donating to 9/11 charities|newspaper=NY Daily News|access-date=October 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Twin Towers Fund, later administered as part of the New York City Public and Private Initiative, was created by then-[[Mayor of New York City|New York City Mayor]] [[Rudy Giuliani|Rudolph Giuliani]] "to benefit the families of firefighters and police officers who died in the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/09/nyregion/costs-of-twin-towers-fund-draws-criticism.html|title=Costs of Twin Towers Fund Draws Criticism|last=Herszenhorn|first=David M.|date=February 9, 2002|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=October 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2016 Republican National Convention]], Giuliani announced that Trump had made unspecified "anonymous" donations after the Sep 11 attacks, although such donations have not been identified.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Giuliani also said, in support of Trump's candidacy, "Every time New York City suffered a tragedy Donald Trump was there to help,.... He's not going to like my telling you this but he did it anonymously."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The New York City Comptroller's office told the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' it had manually reviewed "approximately 1,500 pages of donor records of the Twin Towers Fund and the related entity NYC Public/Private Initiatives Inc., containing the names of more than 110,000 individuals and entities that were collected as part of the audits" through August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/nyc-audit-finds-donald-trump-donations-911-months/story?id=42801444|title=Despite 2001 Vow, Trump Made No 9/11 Donations in Year After Attack, Audit Finds|date=October 14, 2016|publisher=ABC News|access-date=October 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the ''News'', Comptroller [[Scott Stringer]] "found that Trump and [the Trump Foundation] hadn't donated a dime in the months after 9/11"; however, because the reviewed period only covered one year after the attacks, the Comptroller's office was "unable to conclude definitively" that Trump never gave to the fund after August 2002.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  According to its [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] [[Form 990]] tax filings, the Trump Foundation made no grants to the Twin Towers Fund or to NYC Public/Private Initiatives, Inc. from 2002 through 2014, although Trump may have made personal donations after August 2002 that would not have shown up in these filings.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 2016, after the convention, Trump's campaign suggested that the Trump Foundation made a grant to the [[American Red Cross]] after the attacks; however no record of this exists in the foundation's tax filings from 2001 through 2014.  As with the Twin Towers Fund, if Trump instead had made a personal donation, it would not have shown up in the foundation's records.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Using Trump Foundation money to settle Trump Organization legal disputes===
Trump may have used foundation money to settle his personal or business legal disputes on at least two occasions.

In 2007, Trump used Trump Foundation funds to settle a 2006 legal dispute between the [[Palm Beach, Florida|Town of Palm Beach]], [[Florida]], and Trump's [[Mar-a-Lago]] country club. The town said that the club's flagpole violated town height limit rules and levied a daily accruing fine against the club. The club's flagpole was 80 feet tall, 38 feet above limits imposed by the town.  Palm Beach began fining Trump $1,250 per day for the violation.  Trump countersued Palm Beach for $25 million on US constitutional grounds for restricting his 1st amendment rights of free speech and his 14th amendment rights of equal protection.  The suit alleged that at least 20 other properties had violated the height restrictions but were not similarly fined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2007-04-24/news/0704240036_1_mar-a-lago-american-flag-flagpole|title=Trump settles dispute over flag|newspaper=tribunedigital-sunsentinel|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also alleged that a shorter flagpole "would fail to appropriately express the magnitude of Donald J. Trump's…patriotism."&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/trump-files-how-donald-drove-palm-beach-nuts-american-flag|title=The Trump Files: How Donald drove Palm Beach nuts with an American flag|newspaper=Mother Jones|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump eventually reached a legal settlement with Palm Beach after, according to the ''[[Sun-Sentinel|Sun Sentinel]],'' "secret, court-ordered negotiations."&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;  Settlement documents show that Trump, in return for discharging the club's obligations to Palm Beach, had agreed to personally donate $100,000 to [[Fisher House Foundation|Fischer House]], a charity benefitting veterans and military families. However, Trump then made the grant using foundation money, not his own.&lt;ref name="WaPo258000" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

Trump's foundation paid $158,000 to the Martin B. Greenberg Foundation as a settlement of a lawsuit brought by Greenberg against the [[Trump National Golf Club Westchester]] in [[Briarcliff Manor, New York]]. Greenberg alleged that he had rightfully won a $1 million prize for scoring a [[hole-in-one]] in a 2010 charity golf tournament at the club.  But the club denied the award on technical grounds, arguing that the hole was shorter than the required 150 yards.&lt;ref name="WaPoMissing" /&gt; Martin Greenberg sued and a settlement was reached at a significantly reduced amount. ''The Washington Post'' reported that "on the day that Trump and the other parties told the court that they had settled the case, the Donald J. Trump Foundation made its first and only grant to the Martin B. Greenberg Foundation, for $158,000."&lt;ref name="WaPoMissing" /&gt;  In September 2016, the ''Post'' reported that the grant was directly linked to the legal settlement, likely violating IRS self-dealing rules by using charitable funds to pay Trump's personal or business obligations.&lt;ref name="WaPo258000"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-used-258000-from-his-charity-to-settle-legal-problems/2016/09/20/adc88f9c-7d11-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html|title=Trump used $258,000 from his charity to settle legal problems|last=Farenthold|first=David A.|date=September 20, 2016|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To raise the money needed to make the settlement, the Trump Foundation auctioned a prize of lifetime golf membership at Trump-owned golf courses, with the winning bid bringing a $157,000 donation to the Trump Foundation to the foundation to offset the payment to the Greenberg Foundation.&lt;ref name="Self-Dealing"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/09/28/495782978/journalist-says-trump-foundation-may-have-engaged-in-self-dealing|title=Journalist Says Trump Foundation May Have Engaged In 'Self-Dealing'|website=NPR.org|access-date=September 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winner of the auction may have believed he was donating to Trump Foundation charitable causes.&lt;ref name="Self-Dealing" /&gt;

According to the Trump Foundation's publicly available tax returns, Trump National Golf Club Westchester paid over $200,000 to the Trump Foundation in 2016, with $158,000 of the funds designated as repayment of the foundation funds used toward the Martin B . Greenberg settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-golf-course-reimbursed-president-trumps-charity-amid-ongoing-investigation-into-the-foundation/2017/11/20/5e7ff63c-ce05-11e7-81bc-c55a220c8cbe_story.html|title=Trump golf course reimbursed President Trump's charity amid ongoing investigation into the foundation|last=Fahrenthold|first=David A.|date=2017-11-20|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-11-21|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Donation to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi ===
In 2013, the Trump Foundation donated $25,000 in support of [[Florida Attorney General]] [[Pam Bondi]]'s election campaign while Bondi's office was reviewing fraud allegations against [[Trump University]], a for-profit real estate program created by Donald Trump.&lt;ref name="WaPoPenalty"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/01/trump-pays-irs-a-penalty-for-his-foundation-violating-rules-with-gift-to-florida-attorney-general/|title=Trump pays IRS a penalty for his foundation violating rules with gift to aid Florida attorney general|date=September 1, 2016|website=Washington Post|author=David A. Fahrenthold}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Around that time Trump also hosted a fundraiser for Bondi at his Mar-a-Lago resort at a fee well below his normal market rate.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.citizensforethics.org/press-release/crew-files-criminal-bribery-complaint-donald-trump-pam-bondi/|title=CREW Files Criminal Bribery Complaint Against Donald Trump &amp; Pam Bondi – CREW|newspaper=CREW|language=en-US|access-date=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bondi's office later ended the investigation without bringing charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/07/us/politics/donald-trump-pam-bondi.html|title=Donald Trump's Donation Is His Latest Brush With Campaign Fund Rules|last=Eder|first=Steve|date=September 6, 2016|last2=Twohey|first2=Megan|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a Trump Foundation attorney, "the [$25,000] contribution was made in error due to a case of mistaken identity of organizations with the same name." Trump later personally reimbursed his foundation for the $25,000. The foundation paid a $2,500 fine for violating IRS rules against political contributions by charitable organizations.&lt;ref name="WaPoPenalty" /&gt; In 2016 New York Attorney General [[Eric Schneiderman]] stated publicly that the Trump Foundation was the subject of an ongoing investigation by his office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/04/us/politics/trump-foundation-money.html|title=State Attorney General Orders Trump Foundation to Cease Raising Money in New York|last=Eder|first=Steve|date=2016-10-03|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] (CREW), a not-for-profit watchdog group, filed a complaint with the IRS (see below).  It also cast doubt on Trump's story after obtaining a letter from the Trump Foundation's attorney to the [[New York Attorney General]]'s office.  "We're past the point where a reasonable person could believe this is just a never-ending series of once in a lifetime errors," said CREW Communications Director Jordan Libowitz. "This may not be anything nefarious, but if it isn't, that would mean that the Trump operation is completely inept when it comes to running the Trump Foundation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.citizensforethics.org/press-release/trump-foundations-got-problems-taxes/|title=The Trump Foundation's Got Problems with Its Taxes.

On October 5, 2016, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported details of how Trump had on several other occasions since as early as the 1980s made campaign donations to various US state attorneys general while they had been reviewing cases involving the Trump Organization or Trump personally, although the Bondi case is the only one it cited as having involved Trump Foundation money.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-often-made-donations-to-state-attorneys-general-reviewing-his-business-1475689963|title=Donald Trump Often Made Donations to State Attorneys General Reviewing His Business|last=Rothfeld|first=Michael|date=October 5, 2016|last2=Berzon|first2=Alexandra|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=October 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Grants allegedly made for political purposes ===

Trump paid $100,000 of Trump Foundation funds in 2012 to [[Franklin Graham|Reverend Franklin Graham]]'s [[Billy Graham Evangelistic Association|Billy Graham Evangelical Association]]. [[NBC News]] has called Graham "an early ally" of Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-s-foundation-wrote-many-checks-path-nomination-n659811|title=Trump's foundation wrote many checks on path to nomination|publisher=NBC News|access-date=October 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "The more you listen to him, the more you say to yourself, 'You know, maybe the guy's right,'" Graham had told [[ABC News]] in 2011.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In October 2016 Graham revealed to the ''[[The Charlotte Observer|Charlotte Observer]]'' that, in 2012, he had instructed Trump to make the $100,000 donation and that the money was used to pay for full page ads urging voters to support candidates in the [[2012 Presidential election|2012 presidential election]] who supported "biblical values".  The ''Observer'' has suggested the timing and tone of the ads indicate they were placed in support of [[Mitt Romney]]'s campaign.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/living/religion/article108054712.html|title=Franklin Graham praises McCrory, blames Charlotte for HB2-related disruption|newspaper=Charlotte Observer|access-date=October 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham also heads [[Boone, North Carolina]]-based [[Samaritan's Purse]], a Christian relief agency that received $25,000 from the Trump Foundation in 2012.  Graham credits then-[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] anchor [[Greta Van Susteren]] for soliciting the $25,000 donation from Trump.  Van Susteren and her TV crew had accompanied Graham on Samaritan's Purse trips to Haiti and North Korea.  The ''Charlotte Observer'' quoted Graham saying "[Trump] was on her show, and [Van Susteren] said, 'I was just in Haiti and Samaritan's Purse is doing this down there, and Donald, you need to help.' He sent a check out."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  In 2016, several media outlets alleged that Van Susteren had been producing overtly pro-Trump reports on her Fox News show [[On the Record (Fox News TV series)|''On the Record'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mediamatters.org/research/2016/05/26/media-figures-mock-greta-van-susterens-hour-long-trump-infomercial/210608|title=Media Figures Mock Greta Van Susteren's Hour-Long Trump Infomercial|date=May 26, 2016|publisher=Media Matters for America|access-date=October 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the Trump Foundation made a $100,000 grant to the [[Citizens United (organization)|Citizens United Foundation]], a charitable foundation closely related to [[David Bossie]]'s conservative group, [[Citizens United]].  At the time Citizens United was engaged in a lawsuit against [[New York State Attorney General]] [[Eric Schneiderman]], whose office was pursuing a civil lawsuit against [[Trump University]]. It was the largest single grant made by the Trump Foundation that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-charity-gave-100000-to-david-bossies-citizens-united-that-helped-fund-lawsuit-against-moguls-foe-151337835.html|title=Trump charity gave $100,000 to David Bossie's Citizens United that helped fund lawsuit against mogul's foe|date=September 9, 2016|author=[[Michael Isikoff]]|work=Yahoo News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schneiderman's office called the grant part of a "vendetta" by Trump, while Citizens United rejected any connection between the grant and its own lawsuit against Schneiderman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/295178-trump-foundation-gave-100k-to-conservative-group-suing-ny|title=Trump Foundation gave $100K to conservative group suing NY attorney general: report|last=Smilowitz|first=Elliot|date=September 9, 2016|newspaper=The Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trump Foundation's 2014 tax filing&lt;ref name="Search Results: Donald J Trump Foundation Inc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.charitiesnys.com/RegistrySearch/show_details.jsp?id=%7B412967CE-87D6-4FAF-A0E2-58CF382F8F53%7D|title=Charities Database|website=CharitiesNYS.com|publisher=New York State Office of the Attorney General|accessdate=October 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; misidentified Citizens United as a public charity (501(c)(3)) when it is in fact a social welfare organization (501(c)(4)).

The Trump Foundation donated a total of $40,000 from 2011 through 2013 to the [[Drumthwacket]] Foundation, a charitable organization formed to pay for renovation and historical preservation of the New Jersey governor's mansion of the same name.  In 2011, Trump was seeking to acquire permits to build a personal cemetery on the fairway at the Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/01/donald_trump_death_burial.html|title=Donald Trump looks to spend eternity in N.J. as real estate mogul seeks private cemetery|newspaper=NJ.com|access-date=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may have needed political help in obtaining approval for the permit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/21/chris-christie-drumthwacket_n_4826459.html|title=Christie's Mansion Fund Collected Millions From Political Favor Seekers|last=Reporter|first=Christina Wilkie National|last2=Post|first2=The Huffington|date=February 21, 2014|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump directed $100,000 of Trump Foundation money toward the [[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum|National September 11 Memorial Museum]] days before the 2016 New York State Republican presidential primary, where he was on the ballot, mischaracterizing the foundation grant as a personal donation.&lt;ref name="WaPoMissing" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/uac/about-publication-526|title=Publication 526, Charitable Contributions|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|access-date=September 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/trump-charity-donations/|title=Searching for evidence of Trump's personal giving|website=Washington Post|access-date=October 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, the Trump Foundation granted $10,000 to [[Project Veritas]], a charity run by conservative filmmaker [[James O'Keefe]]. In October 2016, O'Keefe released video which purportedly reveals how Democrats incited violence at Trump rallies.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{cite web |last=Caldwell |first=Leigh Ann |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-foundation-paid-activist-filmmaker-james-o-keefe-n670381 |title=Trump Foundation Paid Activist Filmmaker James O'Keefe |work=NBC News |accessdate=October 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the third [[2016 presidential debates|2016 presidential debate]], Trump claimed that new videos produced by O'Keefe and released that week proved that [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]] had "hired people" and "paid them $1,500" to "be violent, cause fights, [and] do bad things" at Trump rallies.&lt;ref name=":17"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://thinkprogress.org/trump-funded-james-okeefe-53015c2f44b6#.rpq0977jf |title=Trump used his foundation to fund guerrilla filmmaker James O'Keefe |last=Israel |first=Josh |date=October 20, 2016 |newspaper=ThinkProgress |access-date=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Democratic National Committee]] spokesman noted Trump's donation after Project Veritas released another video on the 2016 presidential election.

Trump may have strategically directed money from the Trump Foundation to support his presidential campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article105849807.html|title=Trump used charity dollars for presidential campaign, report says|access-date=October 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one case, the grants were used specifically to pay for newspaper ads.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; In October 2016 ''[[RealClearPolitics]]'' reported that Trump directed significant amounts of foundation money to conservative organizations, possibly in return for political support and access.  The news organization found that, from 2011 through 2014, Trump had "harnessed his eponymous foundation to send at least $286,000 to influential conservative or policy groups.... In many cases, this flow of money corresponded to prime speaking slots or endorsements that aided Trump as he sought to recast himself as a plausible Republican candidate for president." At least two of the groups are based in Republican-leaning early [[Presidential Primary|presidential primary]] states.&lt;ref name="RealClear"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2016/10/04/trump_used_foundation_funds_for_2016_run_filings_suggest.html|title=Trump Used Foundation Funds for 2016 Run, Filings Suggest|last=Berg|first=Rebecca|date=October 4, 2016|access-date=October 4, 2016|work=RealClearPolitics}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Citizens United (above), groups include Iowa's [[The Family Leader]], the South Carolina Palmetto Family Council, the [[American Conservative Union]], and the American Spectator Foundation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-s-foundation-wrote-many-checks-path-nomination-n659811|title=Trump's foundation wrote many checks on path to nomination|access-date=October 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zurcher"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37369515|title=What's the deal with the Trump Foundation?|last=Zurcher|first=Anthony|date=October 4, 2016|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=October 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump's granting of foundation money to these groups could have violated the law, if it was in return for his personal right to speak or gain access to networking events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2016/10/04/cracks-in-the-donald-j-trump-foundation-report-alleges-he-self-dealt-funds-to-buy-conservative-favor/|title=Cracks in the Donald J.

The Family Leader is an Iowa-based organization whose stated mission is to "strengthen families, by inspiring Christ-like leadership in the home, the church, and the government."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefamilyleader.com/our-mission-beliefs/|title=Our mission and beliefs|last=|first=|date=October 4, 2016|website=The Family Leader|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the grant, the group's leader, Vader Plaats, invited Trump to speak at i's leadership summit.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  These grants may also have been illegal because The Family Leader is a 501(c)(4) corporation established to "develop, advocate and support legislative agenda at the state level" and not a charity. The Trump Foundation is prohibited from donating money for non-charity purposes. However, Trump may have intended to make a grant to The Family Leader's affiliated foundation, The Family Leader Foundation, a 501(c)(3) charitable foundation.&lt;ref name="RealClear" /&gt;
* Trump was invited to speak at the [[American Conservative Union]]'s [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] ("CPAC") in 2013 after directing $50,000 of Trump Foundation money to the organization. Also in 2013, Trump was invited to speak to the Economic Club of Washington after the Trump Foundation made a grant there.&lt;ref name="RealClear" /&gt;

=== Partial payment of an assessment owed by the Plaza Hotel ===
In 1989, the Trump Foundation paid more than half of a "voluntary assessment" imposed on the [[Plaza Hotel]] by the [[Central Park Conservancy]].  The hotel was owned by the Trump Organization at the time and the assessment was for the renovation of the severely dilapidated [[Pulitzer Fountain]] at [[Grand Army Plaza (Manhattan)|Grand Army Plaza]], which directly faced the hotel.  Toward the $500,000 assessment, the foundation granted $264,631 to the Conservancy while the Trump Organization paid between $100,000 and $250,000.  The grant to the Conservancy was the largest single grant made by the Trump Foundation from inception through at least 2015.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

=== Purchasing goods and services for personal or business benefit with foundation money ===

On two occasions, Trump used the Foundation's money to purchase artists' portraits of himself.
* In November 2007, Trump spent $10,000 in Trump Foundation funds to purchase a {{convert|6|ft|m}}-tall portrait of himself by artist Michael Israel at a benefit for a Florida charity, the [http://www.homesafeinc.org/home_page.aspx Children's Place at Homespace], held at his [[Mar-a-Lago]] country club in Florida after his wife [[Melania Trump]] made the highest bid.&lt;ref name="FahrentholdPainting2"&gt;David A. Fahrenthold, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-clue-to-the-whereabouts-of-the-6-foot-tall-portrait-of-donald-trump/2016/09/14/ae65db82-7a8f-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html Trump bought a 6-foot-tall portrait of himself with charity money. We may have found it], ''The Washington Post'' (September 14, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://surlysubgroup.com/2016/10/03/trumps-abuse-of-trump-foundation-criminal-tax-implications/|title=Trump's Abuse of Trump Foundation — Criminal Tax Implications?|last=Hackney|first=Philip|date=October 3, 2016|website=Surly Subgroup – Tax Blogging on a Regular Basis|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacobson2"&gt;Louis Jacobson, [http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/13/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-trump-foundation-took-other-peop/ Barack Obama says Trump foundation took other people's money, bought a six-foot-tall painting], ''PolitiFact'' (September 13, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;  The painter's former production manager told ''The Washington Post'' that he had, at the request of Trump's wife [[Melania Trump|Melania]], shipped the painting to the [[Trump National Golf Club Westchester]] in [[Briarcliff Manor, New York]], allegedly for display in the country club's boardroom or conference room.&lt;ref name="FahrentholdPainting2" /&gt; The charity paid half the proceeds, $10,000, to the artist for the painting, which established that the painting had a fair market value of at least that amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/11/01/this-is-the-portrait-of-himself-that-donald-trump-bought-with-20000-from-his-charity/|title=This is the portrait of Donald Trump that his charity bought for $20,000|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tax experts told the ''Post'' that if it was displayed at the golf club, it could violate [[Internal Revenue Service]] rules prohibiting non-profits from [[self-dealing]] (i.e., using charitable funding for noncharitable purposes).&lt;ref name="FahrentholdPainting2" /&gt; In September 2016, President [[Barack Obama]] publicly criticized Trump's purchase of the painting.&lt;ref name="FahrentholdPainting2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacobson2" /&gt;
* In 2014, at a charity for the Unicorn Children's Foundation, held at his [[Mar-a-Lago]] resort, Trump purchased a {{convert|4|ft|m}}-tall painting of a 1990s version of himself by Argentine artist [[Havi Schanz]], paying for it with $20,000 of Trump Foundation funds.&lt;ref name="WaPo258000" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; A photo of the portrait was found on a [[TripAdvisor]] review of [[Trump National Doral Miami]] and, later, a reporter for [[Univision]] went to the club, asked various staff about the painting, and eventually discovered it hanging on a wall at the golf resort's Champions Bar &amp; Grill restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.univision.com/univision-news/politics/how-i-found-trumps-controversial-10-000-portrait|title=How I found Trump's controversial $10,000 portrait.|last=Acevedo|first=Enrique|date=September 21, 2016|publisher=[[Univision]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|presidential campaign]] spokesperson [[Boris Epshteyn]] explained to [[MSNBC]] that Trump's use of the painting at Trump's Champion Bar &amp; Grill was not only proper but beneficial to the foundation based on IRS rules that allow individuals to store items "on behalf of the foundation – in order to help with storage costs" and that its use at the restaurant is "absolutely proper" in that Trump was "doing his foundation a favor".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/09/27/trump-is-actually-doing-his-foundation-a-favor-by-storing-its-portrait-his-golf-resort-wall-his-adviser-says/|title=Trump is actually doing his foundation a favor, by 'storing' its portrait on his golf resort wall, his adviser says|website=Washington Post|access-date=September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Trump bid $12,000 at a charity auction, hosted at his [[Mar-a-Lago|Mar-a-lago]] club, to purchase an [[National Football League|NFL]] football helmet autographed by [[Tim Tebow]] and a Tebow football jersey. Trump was given credit for generosity in newspaper accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/news/komen-for-the-cure-perfect-pink-party-draws-hundre/nMFRJ/|title=Komen for the Cure Perfect Pink party draws hundreds, raises more than $1M|last=Donnelly|first=Shannon|date=January 21, 2012|work=Palm Beach Daily News|accessdate=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the purchase was made with $12,000 of foundation money, not his own. The current whereabouts of the helmet and jersey are unknown. Tax law experts say if Trump kept them, the purchase might have violated the self-dealing rule, which bans private foundations from "the furnishing of goods" to their own officers.&lt;ref name="Tebow"/&gt;

In 2008 Trump used $107,000 of Trump Foundation funds to purchase a luxury trip to Paris, including a meeting with actress [[Salma Hayek]], at a charity auction for the Gucci Foundation.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

In 2013 the Trump Foundation made a $5,000 grant to the non-profit D.C. Preservation League.  According to ''The Washington Post'', the nonprofit's support was helpful to the Trump Organization in obtaining the rights to convert [[Washington, D.C.]]'s historic [[Old Post Office Pavilion]] into the Trump International Hotel. In acknowledgment of the donation, the Trump Foundation received ads in the event programs; the ads promoted Trump's hotels rather than the foundation, in possible violation of IRS self-dealing rules.&lt;ref name="WaPo258000" /&gt;

''[[The Palm Beach Post]]'' has suggested that Trump benefited personally when the Trump Foundation made grants totaling $20,000 during 2012 through 2014 in return for band and choir performances held at his resorts.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://extracredit.blog.palmbeachpost.com/2016/10/20/high-school-bands-performed-at-donald-trumps-businesses-then-his-foundation-cut-them-checks/|title=School bands play at Trump's businesses, and his charity writes checks {{!}} Extra Credit|last=Marra|first=Andrew|access-date=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diverting business or personal income to the foundation as donations ===
Trump may have directed income owed to him personally to be sent to the foundation instead, in possible violation of tax rules. ''The Washington Post'' reported in September 2016 that Donald Trump had directed that $2.3 million owed to him and his organization by various people and organizations should be paid instead to his foundation as donations, possibly evading personal income taxes.&lt;ref name=WaPoDirected&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-directed-23-million-owed-to-him-to-his-charity-instead/2016/09/26/7a9e9fac-8352-11e6-ac72-a29979381495_story.html|title=Trump directed $2.3 million owed to him to his tax-exempt foundation instead|website=Washington Post|access-date=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Post'' found old ''[[Associated Press]]'' coverage showing that Trump may have started directing income to the Trump Foundation as early as 1989. IRS rules prohibit individuals from diverting taxable income owed to them toward charities if they benefit directly from those charities, unless the individual declares the income on his personal tax forms.&lt;ref name="WaPoDirected" /&gt;  Since Trump had yet to release his personal income taxes at that time, the ''Post'' was unable to confirm if the income was declared for any of the donations received.&lt;ref name="WaPoDirected" /&gt;

The Trump Foundation received at least $1.9 million from ticket broker Richard Ebbers. Richard Ebers had bought goods and services, including tickets, from "Trump or his businesses"; he was allegedly instructed to make payment for them to the Trump Foundation in the form of charitable contributions instead of as income for the Trump organization.&lt;ref name="WaPoDirected" /&gt;

The Trump Foundation received a total of $5,000,000 in donations from [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] owner [[Vince McMahon]] and his wife [[Linda McMahon]] from 2007 to 2009.&lt;ref name="WaPoDirected" /&gt; Trump appeared twice in [[WrestleMania]] events, in 2007 and again in 2009. One donation to the foundation was $4 million in 2007; the second was $1 million in 2009. The WWE later told [[The Huffington Post]] that "during this period of time, WWE paid Donald Trump appearance fees separately," and "separately, [WWE chief executives] Vince and Linda McMahon made personal donations to Donald Trump's foundation."&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt;

In 2007, the Celebrity Fight Night Foundation hosted a fundraiser to benefit the [[Muhammad Ali Center|Muhammad Ali Parkinson's Center]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]].  According to a Celebrity Fight Night Foundation spokesperson, in return for Trump's appearance and his offering a New York-based dinner with himself at auction, Trump stipulated that the Parkinson's charity share the total auction proceeds with the Trump Foundation.  The Trump Foundation subsequently received $150,000 of auction proceeds that would otherwise have gone to the center benefitting [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's Disease]] research.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Other donations made to the Trump Foundation that may have been in return for Trump's personal work include:
* $400,000 from [[Comedy Central]] as payment for Trump's attendance at a [[Roast (comedy)|celebrity roast]] in his honor.&lt;ref name="WaPoDirected" /&gt;
* $150,000 from [[People (magazine)|''People Magazine'']]  in return for exclusive photos of Trump's son, Barron Trump.&lt;ref name="Zurcher" /&gt;
* $500,000 from [[NBCUniversal|NBC Universal]] in 2012 while the network was airing Trump's show, ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|The Apprentice]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/12/politics/donald-trump-foundation-charity/index.html|title=Trump hasn't donated to his own charity since 2008|last=CNN|first=Curt Devine, David Fitzpatrick and Drew Griffin|website=CNN|access-date=October 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* $100,000 from the family of Donna Clancy, whose family law office had been renting space at the Trump Organization's [[40 Wall Street]] building.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-foundation-charity_us_56aa90bae4b00b033aae659f|title=Donald Trump Says He Can't Be Bought.

* $100,000 in 2005 for work by Trump's wife [[Melania Trump]] for [[Norwegian Cruise Line]]s for a segment that was later included in Trump's show, ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|The Apprentice]]''.  A spokeswoman for the company confirmed that the appearance fee to Melania was paid in the form of a donation to the Trump Foundation.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Granting money to charities that rented Trump Organization facilities ===
Trump has been accused of directing foundation money toward several charities that in turn paid the Trump Organization to host charity events at Trump-owned hotels and golf clubs.&lt;ref name="Self-Dealing" /&gt; High-profile charity events at [[Mar-a-Lago]] cost as much as $300,000.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/bedb4164bc9e48d190f112f7d83907a5#|title=Charities thinking twice about galas at Trump's Mar-a-Lago|newspaper=The Big Story|language=en-US|access-date=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples:
* In 2010, Trump was personally honored for his support by the Palm Beach Police Foundation after the Trump Foundation donated to the charity $150,000 during the period of 2009–2010.&lt;ref name="Retooled"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-donald-trump-retooled-his-charity-to-spend-other-peoples-money/2016/09/10/da8cce64-75df-11e6-8149-b8d05321db62_story.html|title=How Donald Trump retooled his charity to spend other people's money|website=Washington Post|access-date=September 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the police foundation's public tax records, Palm Beach Police Foundation paid the Trump Organization $276,463 in rent in 2014 for its "Police Ball and Auction"&lt;ref name="PBPF"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.citizenaudit.org/organization/830462654/palm-beach-police-foundation-inc/|publisher=Citizen's Audit|title=Palm Beach Police Foundation tax records Form 990 2014|last=|first=|date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was held at Trump's Mar-a-Lago hotel.&lt;ref name="Retooled" /&gt;  The 2014 tax form also lists $44,332 in unattributed "direct expenses" paid by the police foundation for the same event as well as $36,608 in "direct expenses" for its annual "Golf Classic", which the police foundation holds annually at a Trump Organization-owned golf course.&lt;ref name="PBPF" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.palmbeachpolicefoundation.org/golf-tournament|title=Golf Classic|date=|publisher=Palm Beach Police Foundation|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For each of the four years prior to 2014, the police foundation's public tax records show significant "direct expenses" incurred for both the Police Ball and Auction and the golf tournament, although expense categories are not cited in the filings.&lt;ref name="PBPF" /&gt;
* In 2013, according to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Trump donated $10,000 to the [[V Foundation]], a cancer-fighting group founded by former basketball coach [[Jim Valvano]], in return for the V Foundation holding a fundraiser at his [[Trump Winery]] in [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name="WaPoMissing"/&gt;
* The [[Dana–Farber Cancer Institute|Dana-Farber Cancer Institute]] paid the Trump Organization substantial fees to hold annual events at [[Mar-a-Lago|Mar-A-Lago]].  The Trump Foundation in turn granted to the Institute a total of $85,000 for 2006 and 2007, among other grants in subsequent years.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;''The Foundation Directory, 2009 Edition'', p. 7170 (David G. Jacobs, Senior Editor).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;''The Foundation Directory, 2010 Edition'', p. 7129 (David G. Jacobs, Senior Editor).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trump taking personal credit for donations made using foundation money===
''[[The Washington Post]]'' and [[Fox News]] reported that Trump has repeatedly claimed in public, beginning in 2015, to have made over "$102 million" in charitable donations "in the past five years". The Trump Organization provided journalists with a 93-page list of the donations.  None of the cash donations were confirmed to come from Trump himself; many were actually grants from the Trump Foundation,&lt;ref name="WaPoMissing"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/apps/g/page/politics/a-94-page-list-of-donald-trumps-charitable-contributions-from-the-last-five-years/2013/|title=A 93-page list of Donald Trump's charitable contributions from the last five years|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fox6now.com/2016/06/29/have-you-given-more-cash-to-charity-than-donald-trump/|title=Have you given more to charity than Donald Trump?|date=June 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which no longer contained any of Trump's own money.

For example, Trump took personal credit and was honored for a Trump Foundation grant to the Palm Beach Police Foundation that was actually from an outside source (see above). He had pledged the money personally, and then the Trump Foundation solicited the $150,000 earmarked for the police foundation from an unrelated philanthropic organization, the Charles Evans Foundation.  The Trump Foundation then paid the $150,000 to the Palm Beach charity.&lt;ref name="Retooled" /&gt; The police then honored Trump personally with its annual Palm Tree Award at Trump's [[Mar-a-Lago]] hotel at its annual fundraiser.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.palmbeachpolicefoundation.org/palm-tree-award|title=Palm Tree Award |publisher=Palm Beach Police Foundation|access-date=September 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Washington Post'' wrote that "Trump had effectively turned the Evans Foundation's gifts into his own gifts, without adding any money of his own."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37547094 |title=End NY fundraising, Trump foundation told |date=October 4, 2016 |work=BBC News |accessdate=December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dana–Farber Cancer Institute|Dana-Farber Cancer Institute]] has honored Trump variously as "Grand Benefactor" and "Grand Honorary Chair" at its annual fundraisers held at Trump's [[Mar-a-Lago]] estate.  Trump may have also earned more money on the event fees it received from the institute than the Trump Foundation paid to the institute in grants.  Trump has directed at least $300,000 of grants of the Trump Foundation money to Dana-Farber since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statnews.com/2016/09/29/dana-farber-trump/|title=How Trump was named 'Grand Benefactor' for a Dana-Farber gala without donating a penny|date=September 29, 2016|website=STAT|access-date=September 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump received highly visible praise for his personal generosity on his prime-time television show ''[[The Apprentice (US TV series)|The Apprentice]]'' on multiple occasions.  Trump had frequently offered to make generous donations to his contestants' charities, but records show that he ultimately either directed the Trump Foundation to make a grant, or instead had the show's network, [[NBCUniversal|NBC Universal]], make the donation instead.&lt;ref name="WaPoMissing" /&gt; Examples include:
* A 2008 episode where Trump told contestant and mixed-martial arts star [[Tito Ortiz]]: "I think you're so incredible that — personally, out of my own account — I'm going to give you $50,000 for [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital|St. Jude's]] [children's hospital]," Ortiz's chosen charity and also a favorite named charity of Trump's son, [[Eric Trump|Eric]].  Trump then had the Trump Foundation make a $50,000 grant to St Jude's.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-promised-personal-gifts-on-celebrity-apprentice-heres-who-really-paid/2016/08/18/b8d087b4-5d9a-11e6-af8e-54aa2e849447_story.html|title=Trump promised personal gifts on 'Celebrity Apprentice.' Here's who really paid.|website=Washington Post|access-date=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2012 Trump promised at least six personal donations of $10,000 each to contestants' chosen charities during one episode of ''[[The Apprentice (US TV series)|Celebrity Apprentice]]''. In another episode of the same season, he pledged $10,000 to contestant [[Aubrey O'Day]]'s chosen charity, a gift "that moved [contestant and comedienne Lisa] [[Lisa Lampanelli|Lampanelli]] to tears."&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  According to ''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'}}s review of tax filings, Trump directed all of this money to be granted to the charities out of Trump Foundation funds.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
* In 2013 Trump promised personal donations of $20,000 each to the charities of basketball star [[Dennis Rodman]], singer [[La Toya Jackson]], former [[Playboy Playmate]] [[Brande Roderick]], and actor [[Gary Busey]] during episodes of the ''Celebrity Apprentice.''  Trump then used Trump Foundation money to make the payments.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  "Remember, Donald Trump is a very nice person, okay?" he told them.  According to a ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' reporter, who reviewed transcripts of the show, by 2013 "contestants had come to expect these gifts — and even to demand them, when Trump didn't offer money on his own."&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
* A gift to Starkey Hearing Foundation, a charity chosen by actress [[Marlee Matlin]].  Trump was credited with a personal donation of at least $14,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hearingreview.com/2011/04/marlee-matlin-raises-986000-for-the-starkey-hearing-foundation/|title=Marlee Matlin Raises $986,000 for the Starkey Hearing Foundation – Hearing Review|newspaper=Hearing Review|language=en-US|access-date=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the donation came from the Trump Foundation.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Other alleged examples include:
* Trump using foundation money to pay the personal bills of a viewer of the TV show [[Extra (U.S. TV program)|''Extra'']].  In 2009 he appeared on the show and promised that he would pay a struggling viewer's domestic bills. "This is really a bad time for a lot of people," Trump said as the contest was announced.  Trump eventually paid the winner with Trump Foundation money.&lt;ref name="WaPoMissing" /&gt; A Trump representative later explained that the grant was legal because the winner qualified as an "indigent" individual under [[Internal Revenue Code]] section 4945(d)(3), a contention at least one tax expert has disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.showbiz411.com/2011/05/01/donald-trump-turns-extra-contest-winner-into-charitable-contribution|title=Donald Trump Gave Himself Tax Break for Helping Contest Winner|date=2011-05-01|website=Showbiz411|access-date=2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Trump being honored with a chair and plaque in his personal name at the [[Raymond F. Kravis Center for the Performing Arts]] after the Trump Foundation donated $10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/08/05/the-monuments-to-donald-trumps-charitable-giving-a-chair-a-bench-and-now-another-chair/|title=The monuments to Donald Trump's charitable giving: A chair. A bench. And now….another chair.|website=Washington Post|access-date=October 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Trump taking personal credit for a $25,000 grant from the Trump Foundation at a speech honoring slain journalist [[James Foley (journalist)|James Foley]] in 2014.  At the time, the ''[[New Hampshire Union Leader]]'' published an article titled ''Trump leads tribute for slain journalist James Foley.''  Foley was posthumously awarded the 12th annual Nackey S. Loeb First Amendment Award, "given annually to New Hampshire organizations or residents who protect or exemplify the liberties listed in the First Amendment to the Constitution."  Trump was the "featured speaker of the event."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20141112/NEWS040201/141119641|title=Trump leads tribute for slain journalist James Foley {{!}} New Hampshire|newspaper=UnionLeader.com|access-date=October 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Trump receiving personal praise for a $100,000 Trump Foundation grant in 2016 to the [[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum|National September 11 Memorial Museum]] ahead of the 2016 New York State Republican Primary (above).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Making grants to other private foundations without fulfilling IRS "expenditure responsibility" rules ===
The Trump Foundation is responsible by law for ensuring that any grant it makes to another private foundation is used strictly for charitable purposes. To fulfill this [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] "expenditure responsibility" the foundation is required to attach "full and detailed" reports describing the use of the grant money to its IRS 990 tax return for each year a grant to a private foundation is made.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbc26.com/news/national/democracy-2016/exclusive-trumps-private-foundation-violates-irs-rules-experts-say|title=Exclusive: Trump's private foundation violates IRS rules, experts say|last=Greenblatt|first=Mark|date=October 20, 2016|newspaper=WGBA|language=en-US|access-date=October 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trump Foundation tax returns show that it failed to do this for all of the 20 grants it made to private foundations during the period of 2005 through 2014. Such grants in this period, which total at least $488,500, could be subject to significant fines and penalties.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/4945|title=Cornell Law School|last=|first=|date=October 20, 2016|website=www.law.cornell.edu|publisher=Cornell University|access-date=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Receiving donation from Ukrainian oligarch during campaign for President ===
In 2015 Ukrainian Victor Pichkun made a $150,000 donation to the Trump Foundation in return for Trump's appearance by video conference link at the Yalta European Strategy Conference.  The appearance was broadcast on a large screen and lasted only 20 minutes, including delays caused by translation and by technical difficulties.  Pichkun is the son-in-law of former Ukrainian president [[Leonid Kuchma|Lionid Kuchma]]. In 2018 the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' reported that the office of [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–present)|Special Counsel]] Robert Mueller was investigating the donation as a possible illegal in-kind campaign contribution from a foreign national intended to curry favor with then-candidate Trump.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/us/politics/trump-mueller-ukraine-victor-pinchuk.html|title=Mueller Investigating Ukrainian's $150,000 Payment for a Trump Appearance|date=2018-04-09|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/04/mueller-reportedly-investigating-usd150-000-trump-foundation-payment-by-ukrainian-billionaire-during-campaign.html|title=Mueller Reportedly Investigating $150,000 Payment to Trump Foundation by Ukrainian Billionaire During Campaign|last=Hannon|first=Elliot|work=Slate Magazine|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal actions and closure ==
=== Intended dissolution of the Trump Foundation ===
In September and October 2016 there were several legal actions and complaints filed against the Trump Foundation. Former head of the [[Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service's]] Office of Exempt Organizations Division Marc Owens told ''The Washington Post'' regarding the various allegations against the foundation: "This is so bizarre, this laundry list of issues.... It's the first time I've ever seen this, and I've been doing this for 25 years in the IRS, and 40 years total."&lt;ref name="WaPoDirected" /&gt; 

In late December 2016, one month before his inauguration, Trump announced that he would dissolve the Trump Foundation to avoid "even the appearance of any conflict with [his] role as President".&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt; However, a spokesperson from the New York State Attorney General's office told the ''New York Time''s, the same month, that the foundation "cannot legally dissolve" until its current investigation is completed.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;

=== Actions by New York State ===

==== Initial investigations and Notice of Violation ====
On September 13, 2016, [[New York State Attorney General]] [[Eric Schneiderman]] announced that his office was investigating the foundation "to make sure it's complying with the laws governing charities in New York."&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/13/politics/eric-schneiderman-donald-trump-foundation/|title=NY attorney general is investigating Trump Foundation practices|date=September 14, 2016|work=CNN|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":29"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/09/14/donald-trump-foundation/|title=Trump Foundation Falls Under Investigation By New York Attorney General|date=September 14, 2016|website=Fortune|access-date=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The office had previously filed charges—at that time awaiting trial—against the Trump Organization's [[Trump University]]. [[Jason Miller (communications strategist)|Jason Miller]], a Trump campaign spokesman, responded to the announcement by labeling Schneiderman a "partisan hack".&lt;ref name = "hack" &gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/politics/NY-Attorney-General-Trump-Inquiry-393334141.html|title=NY Attorney General Reveals Inquiry Into Trump Foundation|date=September 13, 2016|work=NBC News Washington|accessdate=October 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schneiderman has endorsed Hillary Clinton and was identified as a member of her "New York leadership council" in October 2015.&lt;ref name = "hack" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2015/10/clintons-new-york-team-includes-more-than-100-leaders-no-de-blasio-027119|title=Clinton's New York team includes more than 100 leaders, no de Blasio|last=Rubinstein|first=Dana|date=September 26, 2015|work=Politico|accessdate=October 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 30, 2016, the Attorney General's office issued a "Notice of Violation" to the Trump Foundation, ordering it to immediately stop all fundraising in New York and to file its registration and all required past audits within 15 days, or risk being "deemed to be a continuing fraud on the people of the State of New York".&lt;ref name="EderCease"&gt;Steve Eder, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/04/us/politics/trump-foundation-money.html State Attorney General Orders Trump Foundation to Cease Raising Money in New York], ''The New York Times'' (October 2, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Under the law, the foundation may eventually be required to return all donations it had solicited since inception.&lt;ref name="licensing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EderCease" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LoBiancoCease"&gt;Tom LoBianco, [http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/03/politics/trump-foundation-cease-and-desist/ NY AG orders Trump Foundation to cease fundraising], CNN (October 2, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AGletter"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/03/us/politics/letter-trump-foundation.html Letter to Trump Foundation From New York Attorney General's Office] (republished by ''The New York Times'') (October 2, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The notice said the foundation has not been in compliance with New York law because it had failed to re-register in New York State as a "7A level charitable organization", as required for charities that solicit $25,000 or more a year from outside donors. The Donald J. Trump Foundation had been registered in New York under the state's Estates, Powers and Trusts Law with a designation intended for self-funded [[Private foundation (United States)|private foundations]].&lt;ref name="licensing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EderCease" /&gt;

On October 17 a spokesperson for the Attorney General's office confirmed that the Trump Foundation had agreed to cease solicitation of donations in New York State. The Trump Foundation was at the time granted an extension of time for filing its financial paperwork, including all past audits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/us/politics/trump-foundation-tells-new-york-it-has-stopped-soliciting-after-state-order.html|title=Trump Foundation Tells New York It Has Stopped Soliciting After State Order|last=Eder|first=Steve|date=October 17, 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/prosecutor-trump-foundation-says-ny-fundraising-has-stopped/2016/10/17/a40fd0f2-94a2-11e6-9cae-2a3574e296a6_story.html|title=Prosecutor: Trump Foundation says NY fundraising has stopped|website=Washington Post|access-date=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Attorney General's office said the Trump Foundation also agreed to cooperate with their ongoing investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/10/17/ag-trump-foundation-ends-ny-fundraising/92315502/|title=AG: Trump Foundation ends N.Y. fundraising|newspaper=USA TODAY|access-date=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Attorney General's press secretary stated that Trump could not legally dissolve his foundation until the investigation is finished.&lt;ref name="dissolve plans"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2016/12/24/politics/trump-says-hell-dissolve-foundation/index.html|title=Trump says he'll dissolve foundation|last=Diamond|first=Jeremy|date=December 24, 2016|work=CNN|accessdate=December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Admission of self-dealing ====
In filing its 2015 IRS Form 990 (filed in 2016 while under investigation by the New York State Attorney General's office), the foundation appears to admit that it had, in previous years, engaged in self-dealing and illegal transfers of funds to "disqualified persons".  This admission contradicts its filings for previous years, where there is no admission of the same violations.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-foundation-apparently-admits-to-violating-ban-on-self-dealing-new-filing-to-irs-shows/2016/11/22/893f6508-b0a9-11e6-8616-52b15787add0_story.html|title=Trump Foundation admits to violating ban on 'self-dealing,' new filing to IRS shows|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== New York State vs the Trump Foundation and Trump family ====

On June 14, 2018, the new [[New York Attorney General]] [[Barbara Underwood]] filed a civil lawsuit against the foundation, Trump himself, and Trump's three adult children, [[Ivanka Trump|Ivanka]], [[Eric Trump|Eric]], and [[Donald Trump Jr.|Donald Jr]]. alleging that they had engaged in "extensive unlawful political conduct" and that Donald Trump had been using the foundation "as his personal checkbook," to, among other things, settle his personal legal debts and support his presidential campaign.&lt;ref name=":38"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/new-york-files-suit-against-president-trump-alleging-his-charity-engaged-in-illegal-conduct/2018/06/14/c3cbf71e-6fc9-11e8-bd50-b80389a4e569_story.html |title=New York files suit against President Trump, alleging his charity engaged in 'illegal conduct' |last=Fahrenthold |first=David A. |date=June 14, 2018 |work=Washington Post |access-date=June 14, 2018 |language=en-US |issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; The lawsuit sought $2.8 million in restitution and the dissolution of the Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/nyregion/trump-foundation-lawsuit-attorney-general.html |title=N.Y.

Underwood's office also referred suspected Federal campaign and tax law violations to the [[Federal Election Commission]] and to the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]].&lt;ref name=":31" /&gt;  

Separately, in July 2018, the case was referred to the [[New York State Department of Taxation and Finance]].&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; In August 2018, the department issued a [[subpoena]] to [[Michael Cohen (lawyer)|Michael Cohen]], formerly Trump's personal attorney, in connection with the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/22/politics/michael-cohen-trump-foundation-subpoena/index.html|title=New York tax investigators subpoena Michael Cohen in Trump Foundation probe|last1=Orden|first1=Erica|last2=Tatum|first2=Sophie|date=August 22, 2018|work=CNN|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/14/politics/new-york-lawsuit-trump-foundation/index.html|title=New York attorney general sues Trump Foundation|last1=Isidore|first1=Chris|last2=Schuman|first2=Melanie|date=June 14, 2018|work=CNN|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 30, 2018, Trump attorney [[Alan Futerfas]] filed a [[motion to dismiss]] Underwood's suit, claiming it was without merit and was a result of "pervasive bias" by former New York Attorney General, [[Eric Schneiderman]], who had supervised the investigation before resigning that May.  On October 4, 2018, [[New York Attorney General]] [[Barbara Underwood]] filed a memorandum opposing the motion, instead strengthening the charges against the Trump Foundation and now alleging, among other claims, that the full $2.8 million of distributions resulting from the January 2016 Iowa fundraiser represented illegal campaign contributions that needed to be repaid.&lt;ref name=":36" /&gt; The memorandum also stated that the Foundation had engaged in "persistent illegality," adding "Donald J. Trump used his control over the Donald J. Trump Foundation for his benefit to advance his personal, business, and political interests in violation of federal and state law governing charities."&lt;ref name=":37"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-foundation-engaged-persistent-illegality-york-attorney-general/story?id=58293404|title=Trump Foundation engaged in 'persistent illegality,' New York attorney general says|first=A. B. C.|last=News|date=October 4, 2018|website=ABC News|accessdate=October 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

On October 25, Judge Saliann Scarpulla heard arguments for and against the motion to dismissed, but declined to issue a ruling at the time, stating she would await a pending decision by judges from the [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division|New York Supreme Court's Appellate Division]] (the separate [[Summer Zervos|Trump-related suit]] involving [[Donald Trump sexual misconduct allegations|Summer Zervos]]) as to whether a sitting US president could be sued in state court at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/judge-in-trump-charity-lawsuit-appears-skeptical-of-presidents-arguments-for-dismissal/2018/10/25/8b11eee0-d871-11e8-a10f-b51546b10756_story.html|title=Judge in Trump charity lawsuit appears skeptical of president’s arguments for dismissal|last=https://www.facebook.com/dafahrenthold|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/25/politics/trump-foundation-lawsuit-wait/index.html|title=Judge waits to hear if sitting president can be sued before ruling on Trump Foundation|last=Orden|first=Erica|work=CNN|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 23, Scarpulla ruled against the motion to dismiss, affirming that a sitting US president can face "a civil lawsuit in state court for actions not taken in his official capacity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/23/politics/trump-foundation-new-york-state-lawsuit/index.html|title=NY AG's lawsuit against Trump foundation can proceed, judge says|last=CNN|first=Erica Orden,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== US Special Counsel Investigation ===
On April 9, 2018 the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' reported that the office of [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–present)|Special Counsel]] Robert Mueller, as part of his larger investigation into Russian interference into the 2016 election, was investigating the 2015 donation to the Trump Foundation of $150,000 by Ukrainian billionaire [[Victor Pinchuk]].&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; The ''Times'' reported that [[Donald Trump|Trump]]'s personal attorney, [[Michael Cohen (lawyer)|Michael Cohen]], had solicited the donation from Pinchuk in return for Trump's appearance in a 20-minute video conference with Pinchuk and others in [[Kiev]] in September 2015, just a few months after Mr Trump officially began his [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|campaign for US President]].&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/09/trump-investigation-mueller-probes-150000-donation-from-victor-pinchuk.html|title=Mueller is reportedly investigating $150,000 a Ukrainian billionaire gave Trump's foundation|last=Lee|first=Yen Nee|date=2018-04-09|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation was part of a [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–present)|broader investigation into foreign influence into the campaign]]. Federal election law prohibits non-US nationals from contributing to US political campaigns.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;

=== Other complaints ===
==== Letter from the House Judiciary Committee to the US Attorney General ====
Also on September 13, 2016, all fifteen Democrats on the [[House Judiciary Committee]] sent a letter to [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] [[Loretta Lynch]] requesting that the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] launch a criminal investigation of Trump in connection with his foundation's $25,000 grant to Pam Bondi's campaign. The letter specifically cited possible violations of two anti-[[bribery]] laws.&lt;ref name="FortuneDJTF"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2016/09/14/trump-foundation-investigation-pam-bondi/|title=Trump Foundation Investigations Now Multiplying|date=September 14, 2016|access-date=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Civil complaint filed with the Internal Revenue Service ====
Also on September 13, 2016, [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] (CREW), a left-leaning watchdog group, filed a complaint with the [[Internal Revenue Service]] citing evidence they argued would compel the agency to seek back taxes and penalties and revoke the foundation's tax-free status.&lt;ref name="FortuneDJTF" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.citizensforethics.org/press-release/trump-appears-violate-tax-code/|title=Trump appears to violate the tax code – CREW|newspaper=CREW|language=en-US|access-date=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Doug DeVos''' (born October 6, 1964) is an American [[businessman]]. 

As President of [[Amway]] since 2002, Doug DeVos oversees daily operations of the company with Chairman Steve Van Andel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/index.ssf/2012/08/amway_makes_no_apologies_for_p.html |title= Amway Makes No Apologies for President Doug DeVos' 'Private Gift' to Anti-Gay Marriage Group |work=MLlive |publisher= [[Booth Newspapers]] |last= Martinez |first= Shandra |date= August 3, 2012 |accessdate= December 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they form the Office of the Chief Executive. He is the youngest son of Helen June (Van Wesep) and Amway co-founder [[Rich DeVos]], who, with Steve’s father [[Jay Van Andel]], started Amway in [[Ada, Michigan]], in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amway.com/about-amway/our-company/leadership/corporate/doug-devos?lng=EN |title=Amway President Doug DeVos: Our Leadership |publisher=Amway |accessdate=December 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=XzsUAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Helen+June+(Van+Wesep)+DeVos%22&amp;dq=%22Helen+June+(Van+Wesep)+DeVos%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiphrqRnMPQAhVr34MKHbFTAbQQ6AEIKjAF]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2014 to 2017, DeVos served as chairman of the World Federation of Direct Selling Associations (WFDSA), a global trade organization representing more than 60 national direct selling associations. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/amway-president-doug-devos-named-chairman-of-the-world-federation-of-direct-selling-associations-282439741.html|title=Amway President Doug DeVos Named Chairman of the World Federation of Direct Selling Associations|last=Associations|first=Amway; World Federation of Direct Selling|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, he was inducted into the United States Direct Selling Association Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dsa.org/news/individual-press-release/direct-selling-association-inducts-dick-and-doug-devos-into-hall-of-fame-presents-amway-co-founder-with-lifetime-achievement-award|title=Press Release|website=www.dsa.org|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeVos has teamed with John J. "Hap" Fauth and Roger Penske to lead the New York Yacht Club's 2021 entry into the America's Cup, sailing's flagship competition.  The entry marks the club's return to the historic race after a 15-year absence.  The New York Yacht Club first won the America's Cup in 1851.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-yacht-club-has-sights-set-on-the-americas-cup-1534344696|title=New York Yacht Club Has Sights Set on the America’s Cup|last=Kuriloff|first=Aaron|date=2018-08-15|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with his Quantum Racing team, DeVos won the 52 Super Series Championship in 2018, the world's leading grand prix monohull yacht racing circuit.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.52superseries.com/quantum-racing-52-super-series-champions-for-2018-luna-rossa-win-valencia-title/|title=Quantum Racing 52 SUPER SERIES Champions for 2018, Luna Rossa Win Valencia Title › 52 SUPER SERIES -  Pure Performance|date=2018-09-22|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;DeVos and Quantum also won the championship in 2013, 2014 and 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.52superseries.com/the-52-super-series/|title=The 52 SUPER SERIES › 52 SUPER SERIES -  Pure Performance|date=2014-01-03|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also is a majority owner of Quantum Sails, a leading sail manufacturer based in Traverse City, Michigan. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2017/01/amway_heirs_international_win.html|title=Amway president's international win is victory for Michigan sailmaker|work=MLive.com|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeVos played quarterback at Purdue University as an undergraduate student.  In 2015, he joined several other Purdue alumni to donate a combined $12.1 million toward the construction of a new football training complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2015/Q4/football-alumni-pledge-12.1-million-to-performance-complex-board-of-trustees-approves-new-everyday-home-of-the-boilermakers.html|title=Football alumni pledge $12.1 million to performance complex; Board of Trustees approves new everyday home of the Boilermakers - Purdue University|last=Service|first=Purdue News|website=www.purdue.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016, he was honored by the "He Played Football" award from the Joe Tiller Chapter of the National Football Foundation.  The award is intended to provide recognition to a former football player from the Northeast Indiana region who went on to become highly successful in life after football.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nfftillerchapter.org/page/show/1294668--he-played-football-award-|title="He Played Football"|website=Joe Tiller NFF Chapter|language=en-us|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeVos was also the former Co-Chair (along with Christian film and media producer [[Billy Zeoli]]) of [[Gospel Communications International]].  Gospel Communications International developed the [[BibleGateway.com]] website and also trained and hosted hundreds of evangelical ministries on the internet beginning in 1995. Gospel Communications International both sold the BibleGateway.com website and ceased operations on December 15, 2008.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2715">'''Emilio Guimoye Hernandez''' (1891&amp;ndash;1988/89) was a Peruvian agricultural entrepreneur who served as Minister of Finance (Secretary of the Treasury) from 1954 to 1955 for the [[Peru|Republic of Peru]]. 

Emilio Guimoye was born in Callao, Peru. His father died when he was 8 years old, his mother when he was 12, which forced him to withdraw from school and work to support his younger siblings. At the age of 14 he decided to go with his siblings to the southern village of Chincha, where he worked to many different trades. In 1915, he rented the Mencia farm in the Pisco Valley and became an agricultural entrepreneur. He undertook agricultural activities in nearly every valley on the country's central and southern coast, and re-invested the profits in other companies, from banking and financial entities to hotels, like the famous [[Hotel Paracas]] in Pisco, and real estate investments.

In 1954, the Peruvian economy was in crisis. Aware of the country's difficult situation, Guimoye did not hesitate to put his business aside and volunteered as Development Minister for the administration in office at the time, headed by [[Manuel A. Odría]]. By the end of the following year, he had performed very well in office. With a restored economy, and debts paid, he resigned his post. He only yearned to go back to his farming dream: the colonization of the northern Peruvian rainforest. Guimoye was adamant in the belief that the nation's rainforest offered significant economic and social opportunities, and that the nation's future lay in developing this potential. Therefore, instead of retiring, he decided to invest everything he owned in the colonization of Peru's northern rainforest. Guimoye settled in the Bagua area, where he dedicated himself to the cultivation of rice and cotton fields, as well as cattle breeding. However his hopes were frustrated by the [[Agrarian reform]] decreed by the left-wing dictatorship of [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]] in the 1970s, which paralyzed the initiative he had started.

Guimoye died at the age of 97.

Not too long after his death, the Peruvian postal service SERPOST, printed a limited edition collection stamp, in memoriam and recognition of who was one of the most important pioneers in agricultural property for the Republic of Peru.

The Republic of Peru, currently owes to Emilio Guimoye and family members, the amount of US $ 30'000,000.00 as an indemnification, product of  the  agricultural reform on which his lands were taken away.

==Early life==
Miller was born Hans Eric Miller, in Yorkshire, and attended the [[Queen Elizabeth Sixth Form College|Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School]] in [[Darlington]].&lt;ref name="timesobit" /&gt; He then studied at the [[Handelshochschule Leipzig|Leipzig School of Commerce]] for two years.

==Career==
Miller entered business at the age of 18 at [[Harrisons and Crosfield]], an import-export company. He was appointed a Director in 1908, aged 25, when the company was incorporated.

As a Director, he was largely concerned with developing a number of rubber plantation companies that Harrisons and Crosfield had an interest in. He became Chairman in 1924 and represented them on many boards of rubber companies in which it had an interest, as well as the [[Port of London Authority]]. As a council member of the [[Rubber Growers' Association]] he became an early proponent of research and was in 1920 awarded an honorary Gold Medal for his efforts. He later became chairman of the British Rubber Producers Research Association, formed in 1938, and the International Rubber Development Board.&lt;ref name="timesobit" /&gt;  He was also a sponsor of the International Rubber Regulation Committee, whose work these bodies was intended to complement. He was knighted in 1952 for this work.&lt;ref name="timesobit" /&gt;

==Personal interests and awards==

He farmed, collected books and art.&lt;ref name="timesobit" /&gt; Aside from his gold medal from the Rubber Growers' Association and knighthood, he was also a [[Order of Orange-Nassau|Commander of the Order of Orange-Nassau]].&lt;ref name="timesobit" /&gt;

'''Fortras''' (''Forschungs und Entwicklungsgesellschaft für Transportwesen'' or: ''Research and Development Corporation for the Transportation Sector'') is an [[Electronic data interchange|EDI]] standard for [[data exchange]] between [[Telephone company|carriers]].

Fortras was the designation of an independent company until 2001, when it merged with System Alliance. The designation 'Fortras' is now solely used for the EDI [[Technical standard|standard]] that also is used outside of System Alliance. 

Important Fortras message types are "BORD" for [[consignment]] information (comparable to [[EDIFACT]]'s IFCSUM), "ENTL" for unloading reports from the receiving carrier, and "STAT" for status information (comparable to EDIFACT's IFTSTA).

Fortras messages consist of a sequence of lines with a fixed number of characters, e.g. 80, 128, or 512 and [[data]] elements are placed on fixed positions on each line. The document type is specified by a letter and a record number at the beginning of the line.

'''First Tuesday''' is a networking forum for technology start-ups, their investors and related service providers.

==History==

First Tuesday was launched on the first Tuesday of October 1998 at the Alphabet Bar in [[London]] by its founders Adam Gold, [[Julie Meyer]], Mark Davies, John Browning and [[Nick Denton]]. The early First Tuesdays were held in the loft on Great Titchfield Street which housed Syzygy’s offices. Each month London’s Internet digerati would gather for drinks, and to listen to a speaker and share information on raising money and growing their Internet businesses.&lt;ref name=Riptide-NickDenton-2013&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nisenholtz|first1=Martin|title=Interview Subjects: Nick Denton|url=http://www.digitalriptide.org/person/nick-denton/|accessdate=23 March 2016|work=Riptide|publisher=[[Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy]]|date=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early speakers included Rikki Tahta,  [[Brent Hoberman]] and [[Martha Lane Fox]], the founders of [[Lastminute.com]]; and [[John Taysom]].&lt;ref&gt;"Meet-Markets For The New Economy First Tuesday's parties " by Nicholas Stein [http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2000/07/10/283754/index.htm Fortune] July 10, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In late Spring 1999 Meyer left her job at NewMedia Investors to build First Tuesday's international network. In September 1999, First Tuesday launched into 17 cities across [[Europe]]. At Christmas 1999 and through the Millennium, Julie Meyer went to [[Israel]], meeting Shlomo Kalisch of Jerusalem Global who had launched Yazam, a similar concept to First Tuesday.

First Tuesday London was incorporated in early February 2000. Yazam tried to purchase First Tuesday in February 2000, but failed, ultimately succeeding on the 20th of July 2000. First Tuesday's City Leaders and Julie Meyer had led an alternative funding strategy with investments ready from Karl Christian Agerup of NorthZone Ventures and Rod Schwartz of [[Catalyst Technologies]]. This funding might have enabled First Tuesday to implement appropriate business models, corporate structures and management teams. The business model emerging through the structured First Tuesday Matchmaking events was to take 2% of funds raised at a First Tuesday Matchmaking event. Despite evidence that this was taking off, the company was sold.
 
First Tuesday was run as an independent business or not-for-profit organisation in most countries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

'''''Getting Past NO''''' is a negotiation handbook written by [[William L. Ury]].  It is the sequel to ''[[Getting to Yes]]'' and was published in September 1991 and revised in March 2007.

==Overview==
The books main points include:
*	Have the joint problem-solving mentality together
*	Break the 5 barriers to cooperation: your reaction, their emotion, their position, their dissatisfaction, their power.
*	Prepare, prepare, prepare yourself by identifying/developing:
**	Interests of each side
**	Options
**	Standards
**	[[BATNA]] - Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement
**	What do you aspire to? What would you be content with? What could you live with?
The book has 5 main sections prescribing how a negotiator should get from the confrontation state to the cooperation state during a negotiation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17763">The '''Health Impact Fund''' ('''HIF''') is a proposed pay-for-performance mechanism that would provide a market-based solution to problems concerning the development and distribution of medicines globally. It would incentivize the research and development of new pharmaceutical products that make substantial reductions in the global [[disease burden|burden of disease]]. The HIF is the creation of a team of researchers led by the [[Yale]] philosopher [[Thomas Pogge]] and the [[University of Calgary]] economist [[Aidan Hollis]], and is promoted by the non-profit organization [[Incentives for Global Health]] (IGH).

==Motivation==
In the current system of development and distribution of medicines, millions of people in poor countries die from diseases because the patented medicines they need are unaffordable or because no medicine exists to cure their ailments.  Little pharmaceutical research is concentrated on [[diseases of poverty|diseases specific to the poor.]] This is largely because it has been difficult for pharmaceutical companies to profit from [[drug development|research and development]] directed at products needed by the poor. The cost of pharmaceutical research and development is high and unlikely to be recovered from those in poor countries who cannot afford the medicines. Therefore, "the Health Impact Fund would give companies incentives to develop new products targeting the diseases and conditions for which existing systems have failed to produce results, which would especially benefit the poor." &lt;ref&gt;S.J. Hoffman, T. Pogge. 2011. “Revitalizing Pharmaceutical Innovation for Global Health,” Health Affairs 30(2):367. doi:10.1377/hlthaff.2011.0103.&lt;/ref&gt;

The distribution of pharmaceutical research and development is partly a result of the global patent regime established by the [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPS).  Prior to TRIPS, countries were free to not enact intellectual property laws covering medicines, leading to flourishing generic drug industries in countries such as [[India]]. Following TRIPS, all [[World Trade Organization]] members were required to institute strict, American-style intellectual property rights. As a result, the supply of generic medicines to poor countries has been sharply diminished.&lt;ref name="stiglitz"&gt;Joseph Stiglitz, "[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/333/7582/1279 Scrooge and Intellectual Property Rights]," ''British Medical Journal'' 333, no. 7582 (2006), pp. 1279.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Nobel Prize|Nobel Laureate]] [[Joseph Stiglitz]], the pharmaceutical patent system needs an "alternative" that would "give large rewards for cures or vaccines for diseases like malaria that affect millions."&lt;ref name="stiglitz" /&gt;

==Design of the Fund==
The HIF is intended to address the problems with an uncomplemented pharmaceutical patent system.  The HIF uses market forces to create incentives to develop medicines for typically neglected diseases and to distribute these medicines at low prices all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;Aidan Hollis and Thomas Pogge, ''The Health Impact Fund: Making Medicines Available for All'' (New Haven, CT: Incentives for Global Health, 2008), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Pharmaceutical patent-holders would receive financial rewards by opting to register their new medicines, or new uses of existing medicines, with the Fund. By registering, a patent-holder agrees to distribute its medicine globally at [[cost]] and to cooperate in measuring the health impact of that medicine. In return, the firm receives an annual reward based on its measurable contribution to reducing the [[Disease burden|global burden of disease]].&lt;ref&gt;Aidan Hollis and Thomas Pogge, ''The Health Impact Fund: Making Medicines Available for All'' (New Haven, CT: Incentives for Global Health, 2008), ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Registrants of new drugs are eligible for reward payments for ten years starting at the date of [[Approved drug|marketing approval]] of their product. New uses receive rewards for five years. Following the reward period, registrants agree to allow [[generic drug|generic]] manufacturing of their medicines, in order to prevent price spikes.&lt;ref&gt;Aidan Hollis and Thomas Pogge, ''The Health Impact Fund: Making Medicines Available for All'' (New Haven, CT: Incentives for Global Health, 2008), pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Registrants retain their rights to control follow-on innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Aidan Hollis and Thomas Pogge, ''The Health Impact Fund: Making Medicines Available for All'' (New Haven, CT: Incentives for Global Health, 2008), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessing the health impact of a registered product==
When assessing the health impact of a registered product, “the HIF would essentially estimate the difference between (1) the actual health status of people who consumed the registered product and (2) the estimated health status of those people, had they not had access to the registered product.”&lt;ref&gt;Aidan Hollis and Thomas Pogge, ''The Health Impact Fund: Making Medicines Available for All'' (New Haven, CT: Incentives for Global Health, 2008), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard measure of health impact is the [[Quality-Adjusted Life Year]] (QALY). For example, if all registered products were in conjunction estimated to have saved 10 million QALYs, then a registered product that saved 1 million of those QALYS would receive ten percent of the available reward funds for that year.&lt;ref&gt;Aidan Hollis and Thomas Pogge, ''The Health Impact Fund: Making Medicines Available for All'' (New Haven, CT: Incentives for Global Health, 2008), pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;  The health impact assessment of a registered product would be conducted for each year of its registration with the HIF, and payments would be disbursed annually.

==Funding==
The HIF is to be financed by governments. Ideally, countries will commit a fixed amount of their [[gross national income]] (GNI) to the HIF (0.03 percent of a country’s GNI is the suggested minimum).&lt;ref&gt;Aidan Hollis and Thomas Pogge, ''The Health Impact Fund: Making Medicines Available for All'' (New Haven, CT: Incentives for Global Health, 2008), pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Next step: an innovative pilot==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2016}}
As performance measurement is a core component of the HIF, it needs to be robust across different products and in diverse settings. Working with leading health care assessment organizations such as The George Institute for International Health, NICE International, and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, IGH will perform evaluations of the health impact of different products in a variety of countries. The HIF would expand assessment beyond pre-approval clinical trials, using epidemiological data from actual usage, practical trials, physician surveys, and patient demographics, as modifiers to the core health impact assessment. IGH aims to pilot the proposed HIF mechanism by rewarding a pharmaceutical manufacturer on the basis of measured health impact in a region. This will allow the pay-for-performance approach to be field-tested and refined before it is implemented on a wider scale.

Outcomes and Benefits of the Pilot:
(1.)	Create a comprehensive metric to evaluate the health impact of medicines based on the actual reductions in mortality and morbidity each achieves.
(2.)	Determine how to apply this metric reliably through a field-test that focuses on a new drug’s introduction into a specific area. No attempt has ever been made to measure the health impact of a newly introduced medicine.
(3.)	Benefit people in the field-test area by giving them access to an important new product at an affordable price and by rewarding the innovator promoting its wide and effective use by those who can benefit from it.

IGH is currently{{when|date=March 2014}} exploring opportunities for potential pilots.

==Relationship to other proposals==
The HIF can be seen as a kind of comprehensive [[advance market commitments|Advanced Market Commitment]], since it essentially is a way of incentivizing new research while ensuring access at low prices. However, compared to the Advanced Market Commitment, it is comprehensive because it could apply to any drug or vaccine, and it would operate in all countries. Alternatively, one can put it in the context of prizes, since it has prize-like characteristics in terms of incentivizing research while not enabling high prices. A third way of viewing it is as a supplementary global [[health insurance|drug insurance system]],  in which the [[copayment]] made by consumers is equal to the cost of production.

The HIF staff has prepared a memo setting out their view of the intellectual history of the HIF.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/macmillan/igh/files/origins.doc HIF intellectual history memo]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

=== Criticisms ===

When the HIF was proposed in 2008, it attracted criticism from Professor Brook Baker and Knowledge Ecology International for not requiring open licensing of registered drugs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthgap.org/trips/bakeronHIF.htm Baker criticism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://keionline.org/hif Knowledge Ecology International criticism]&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it allowed drug manufacturers to maintain a monopoly, subject to regulated prices. The proponents modified the proposal in response, suggesting greater flexibility about this aspect of the HIF,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/macmillan/igh/files/HIF_supplementsNov09.pdf Modified proposal in response to Baker and KEI criticism]&lt;/ref&gt; but this remains a controversial feature of the proposal, when compared to other prize fund proposals that feature open licensing of patents to generic manufacturers.

Brita Pekarsky (2010) has argued that the cost of the HIF may be too high, if it is taking money away from other valuable development aid or health related activities.&lt;ref&gt;Brita Pekarsky, “Should Financial Incentives be Used to Differentially Reward ‘Me-Too’ and Innovative Drugs,” ''Pharmacoeconomics''  28.1(2010): 1-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Grootendorst (2009) states that the primary drawback of the HIF is the difficulty of measuring health impact accurately.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Grootendorst, “How Should We Support Pharmaceutical Innovation?,” ''Expert. Rev. Pharmacoeconomics Outcomes Res.'' 2009: 9(4) – 313-320.&lt;/ref&gt;  He notes particularly the problems of trying to attribute health impact to drugs that have long latency periods in their effectiveness (such as vaccines and anti-hypertensives); the problems of consistency across different therapeutic areas; and the technical difficulty of disentangling the effect of the drug from confounding factors.

Jorn Sonderholm (2009) argues that there is a lack of evidence that patents create a barrier to access, so that the HIF may fail to address a real problem.&lt;ref&gt;Jorn Sonderholm, “A Reform Proposal in Need of Reform: A Critique of Thomas Pogge’s Proposal for How to Incentivize Research and Development of Essential Drugs,” ''Public Health Ethics'' 0.0 (2009): 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sakiko Fukuda-Parr and Proochista Ariana (2011) criticized the HIF on a variety of grounds, including its approach to the distribution of benefits and costs, the impact on generic competition and the role of the HIF in strategic negotiations on intellectual property rights,&lt;ref&gt;Sakiko Fukuda-Parr and Proochista Ariana, "Health Impact Fund – Raising Issues Of Distribution, IP Rights And Alliances," ''IP-Watch.Org'', September 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a response from IGH.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ip-watch.org/weblog/2011/10/03/a-response-from-the-authors-of-the-health-impact-fund/ Response to criticism by Fukuda-Parr and Ariana]&lt;/ref&gt;

Afschin Gandjour and Nadja Chernyak state that the HIF does not have a rational basis for the underlying willingness to pay per health gain and, instead, uses an arbitrary figure such as 0.03% of the GNI. Furthermore, the HIF assumes an arbitrary duration of reward (e.g., 10 years) and does not adjust health gains for equity concerns and uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gandjour|first1=Afschin|last2=Chernyak|first2=Nadja|title=A new prize system for drug innovation|journal=Health Policy|date=October 2011|volume=102|issue=2-3|pages=170–177|doi=10.1016/j.healthpol.2011.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, the Social Democratic Party of Germany officially endorsed the HIF and called on the German government to actively support a HIF pilot.&lt;ref&gt;German Social Democratic Party, "[http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/17/021/1702135.pdf Germany's responsibility to fight for health in developing countries - neglected diseases, reduce child and maternal mortality and a strong Global Fund]," Drucksache 17/2135, June 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Health Organization Expert Working Group on Research and Development Financing (related to Public health, innovation and intellectual property) described the HIF as one of a few "promising" proposals deserving further examination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/macmillan/igh/who-hif.html "WHO Working Group Endorses HIF"], Incentives for Global Health. 17 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;   A new WHO Consultative Expert Working Group (CEWG) has noted that the HIF proposal would benefit from a pilot to demonstrate feasibility.

Carl Nathan (2009) suggests that the HIF could help to overcome obstacles to the control of tuberculosis such as development and distribution of vaccines and medicines to the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Nathan, “Taming Tuberculosis: A Challenge for Science and Society,” ''Cell Host and Microbe'' 5(2009): 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

John J. DeGioia, President of Georgetown University, has complimented the HIF for bringing moral imperatives and pragmatic market principles together.  He states, "that this is the beauty of the Health Impact Fund . . . it translates idealism into innovation."&lt;ref&gt;John J. DeGioia, [http://president.georgetown.edu/sections/speeches/61659.html  “Making New Medicines Available to All: The Health Impact Fund,”] Georgetown University, Gonda Theater.  1 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian Barry and Matt Peterson favour the HIF as a mechanism for providing innovators with incentives to develop new medicines that have significant health impacts rather than significant sales impacts.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Barry and Matt Peterson, “Shallow Cuts: GSK’s Voluntary Price Reductions and Patent Pooling Are Not Enough,” ''Public Ethics Media'', 4 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

James Orbinski states that the HIF is an innovative policy proposal that "should be implemented."&lt;ref&gt;James Orbinski, “Are Patents Impeding Medical Care and Innovation?”, [http://www.plosmedicine.org/home.action ''PLoS Medicine''] 7.1(2009): 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>The new building plans were described as “included” rather than “include.” As the new tower is currently still a go for construction and the plans haven’t changed, the wording of the word “include” should not be used in the past tense.

The '''J.L. Hudson Building''' ("Hudson's") was a [[department store]] located at 1206 [[M-1 (Michigan highway)|Woodward Avenue]] in [[Downtown Detroit|downtown]] [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. It was constructed beginning in 1911, with additions throughout the years, before being "completed" in 1946, and named after the company's founder, [[Joseph Lowthian Hudson]]. Hudson's first building on the site opened in 1891 but was demolished in 1923 for a new structure. It was the flagship store for the [[Hudson's]] chain. The building was demolished in a [[Demolition|controlled demolition]] on October 24, 1998, with many people watching from [[Hart Plaza]] (Detroit) and [[Parks in the city of Windsor, Ontario|Dieppe Gardens]] ([[Windsor, Ontario]]). It was the tallest building ever imploded.

==The structure==
Designed by [[SmithGroupJJR|Smith, Hinchman, &amp; Grylls]], Hudson's consisted of approximately 33 levels: five basements, main floor, mezzanine, 2nd through 15th floors, 15 1/2 floor, 16th through 21st floors, 21 1/2 floor, and 22nd through 25th floors. Only the upper two basements through the 12th floor covered the entire footprint of the structure. A tower rose over 400 feet above the Farmer Street side. On all four sides, porcelain-covered copper letters spelled "HUDSON'S" in red neon.

[[File:HudsonWindow.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A window of the J.L. Hudson Building]]
Hudson's boasted about 2.2 million sq. ft.&lt;ref name=homrich&gt;{{cite web| title=J.L. Hudson's| url=http://www.homrichinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/J.L.-Hudsons-Detroit-MI1.pdf| website=Homrich Inc.| accessdate=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; of retail and office space, included several restaurants and was built in the [[Chicago school (architecture)|Chicago School]] [[architectural style]]. The facade was red brick above the second floor. Below that, it consisted of polished pink granite panels. Terra-cotta cornices and rosettes were extensively employed, along with ornamental ironwork. "JLH"-emblazoned ovals decorated frosted windows on the mezzanine and 3rd through 5th floors.

The building measured {{convert|439|ft|m}} tall from its second basement to the top of the penthouse tower. It was also topped by a {{convert|110|ft|m}} high flagpole.

The store closed January 17, 1983 (at the nadir of downtown Detroit's decline).

After closure, Hudson's maintained its headquarters staff of about 1,100 in the downtown store. In May 1984, The J.L. Hudson Co. formally merged into the Department Store Division of the [[Target Corporation|Dayton Hudson Corp.]], although Hudson's stores continued to carry the Hudson's name. All executive and buying positions transferred to [[Minneapolis]], and other staff moved to space at the [[Northland Center (Michigan)|Northland Center]] store in [[Southfield, Michigan|Southfield]]. The last corporate department in the downtown Detroit building, credit operations, moved in October 1986. Dayton Hudson sold the building in December 1989.

Hudson's was [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JP1HJoG-1Pg demolished] by [[Controlled Demolition, Inc.]] at exactly 5:47 pm [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|EST]] on October 24, 1998. 20,000 people watched as the building was imploded &amp;mdash; turning it into a {{convert|60|ft|m|sing=on}} tall pile of debris. The demolition shattered windows on many then-still-abandoned retail buildings across Woodward Avenue, created a large debris and dust cloud that shrouded many parts of downtown Detroit as far south as [[Jefferson Avenue (Detroit)|Jefferson Avenue]] in dust (including thousands of people and vehicles) and accidentally damaged a section of the elevated [[Detroit People Mover]].

The city constructed a 955-spot, four-level Underground [[parking garage]] at the site using parts of the basement of the demolished tower in 2001.&lt;ref name=abbey&gt;{{cite news| title=Hudson's Detroit Contest Brings Redevelopment Ideas For Historic Downtown Site| last=Abbey-Lambertz| first=Kate| journal=Huffington Post| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/12/hudsons-detroit-site-development-contest_n_3420886.html| date=12 June 2013| accessdate=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Detroit Parking Garages| url=http://park-rite.com/Detroit-Parking-Garages.html| website=Park Rite| accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==

'''Jaime Gilinski Bacal''' (born 14 December 1957) is a Colombian banker and [[real estate developer]]. Gilinski resides in London. According to ''[[Forbes]]'', he is the second richest person in Colombia, with a net worth of US$3.9 billion as of May 2018.&lt;ref name="Forbes profile"/&gt;

== Early life ==
He is the son of [[Isaac Gilinski Sragowicz]], a banker and himself the son of Lithuanian Jewish immigrants.

Gilinski earned his BS in [[Industrial Engineering]] from [[Georgia Tech]] in 1978, and an MBA from [[Harvard Business School]] in 1980.&lt;ref name="Forbes profile"/&gt;

== Banking ==
In the 1990s, Gilinski acquired the Colombian assets of BCCI (Bank of Credit and Commerce International) for a nominal sum after its global collapse. Renamed Banco Andino, it became one of the most efficient banks in the Colombian banking system within four years. The Gilinski Group sold the reconstituted bank for a reported $70 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.semana.com/noticias-nacion/regreso-gilinski/81674.aspx|title=El regreso de los Gilinski|accessdate=2009-07-13|publisher=Semana.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family then moved to purchase Banco de Colombia for $365 million, in what was then the largest privatization in Colombia's history. A group of premier private equity investors led by Morgan Stanley Asset Management investing $65 million, billionaire [[George Soros]] investing $50 million and Tiger Asset Management with $35 million together with more than 100 other European and North American institutional investors co-invested with Gilinski.  Later, the family sold control of the bank to Banco Industrial Colombiano, and its controlling stakeholder Sindicato Antioqueño, in a deal valued at $800 million, among Colombia's largest deals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/26/business/big-bank-in-colombia-is-purchasing-a-rival.html|title=Big Bank in Colombia Is Purchasing a Rival| accessdate=2009-06-05|publisher=New York Times | date=1997-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilinski received $418 million for its stake and retained a minority position in the new bank as part of the deal. As of 2018, Bancolombia was the largest in Colombia with a market capitalization of $11 billion on the [[NYSE]].&lt;ref name="Banking in Colombia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bankcali.com/?p=21|title=Banking in Colombia|accessdate=2009-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Gilinski acquired and subsequently merged Banco Sudameris and Banco Tequendema. This merger created GNB Sudameris, a bank with assets of over US $10 billion that ranks among the largest private Colombian banks as of 2018. The purchase of Servibanca, an ATM network with over 2,600 machines, and Suma Valores, a stock exchange commission agent company, has further expanded the network.&lt;ref name="Banking in Colombia"/&gt;

In May 2012, HSBC announced the sale of its Latin American operations (Colombia, Peru, Paraguay) to Banco GNB Sudameris for $400 million in cash. {{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In September 2013, Banco Sabadell announced that Gilinski became its largest shareholder as the anchor investor in a US $1.8 billion capital raise. Through the ABB and share rights issue, Gilinski's investment totals approximately $500 million. Banco Sabadell is the 5th largest bank in Spain, with over US $220 billion in assets and a 13% market share.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The Gilinski group also owns Yupi, a snack food company in Latin America, and exports to nine countries. Gilinski Group also owns Rimax Plastics, which was founded by his father Isaac Gilinski.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.semana.com/noticias-portada/sueno-crecer/111307.aspx|title=El Sueno de crecer|accessdate=2009-06-24|publisher=Semana.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaime Gilinski and his partners [[Ian and Richard Livingstone]] beat 16 other international firms in a competition to develop the project. The $10 billion project, based on the former Howard Air Force Base in Panama, includes {{convert|2750|acre|km2}} of land, which makes it one of the largest development projects in the world.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6039">[[File:Jaime Yankelevich.jpg|thumb|upright|Jaime Yankelevich (''right'')]]
'''Jaime Yankelevich''' (1896 — 1952) was an [[Argentine]] engineer and businessman who was a pioneer in the development of his country's radio and television media.

==Life and times==
Jaime Yankelevich was born into a [[Bulgarian Jews|Jewish]] family in [[Bulgaria]], in 1896. His parents [[Immigration to Argentina|emigrated to Argentina]] in 1899 and settled in the [[Entre Ríos Province|province of Entre Ríos]]. The Yankelevich family relocated to [[Buenos Aires]] in 1914, where Jaime found work in one of the city's many [[theatre]]s as a backstage hand. Trained as a [[Electrician (theater)|theatre electrician]], Yankelevich eventually opened an electrical supply store in the [[Constitución, Buenos Aires|Constitución]] section of Buenos Aires. The store specialized in [[radio valve]]s and other equipment, which became in great demand following the advent of the medium in 1920. Increasingly skilled in his field, he created many of these parts by hand.&lt;ref name=caras&gt;[http://www.revista-caras.com.ar/ed_1298/nota3.php?art=35 ''Caras''] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sale of a failing early radio station gave Yankelevich the opportunity to pursue his interest directly and in 1924, he purchased the ailing broadcaster. Known at the time as "LR3" (for its being the third station on the dial), Yankelevich pioneered the use of artistic contracts in radio, by which artists were paid a salary in return for his commitment to limit broadcasts of their work to live performances in lieu of recordings. The practice made the newly christened "Radio Belgrano" the most coveted employer in Argentine radio and by the 1930s, it enjoyed the nation's highest [[Ratings (broadcast)|ratings]]. Growing acquisitions allowed Yankelevich to form the Radio Belgrano chain in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;''Argentine Radio: Over 60 years on the air.'' The Argentine Information Secretariat, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;  Venturing into other areas, he co-produced ''Two Friends and One Love'', a 1937 [[romantic comedy]] film, with [[Francisco Canaro]], a well-known [[Argentine tango]] bandleader.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinenacional.com/personas/index.php?persona=17362 ''Cine Nacional''] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that decade, he pioneered late-night broadcasting in Argentina, and in 1942, united numerous low-wattage radio stations into the Argentine Broadcasting Chain, which preserved or reopened a number of smaller, local stations nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lariojacultural.com.ar/Nota.asp?id=266 ''La Rioja Cultural''] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Argentine general election, 1946|1946 election]] of President [[Juan Perón]] resulted in the nationalization of industries producing nearly half the nation's goods and services, including the three radio networks that controlled most of Argentina's stations, ''El Mundo'', ''Splendid'' and ''Belgrano''.&lt;ref name=comfer&gt;[http://www.comfer.gov.ar/004.php ''Comité Federal de Radiodifusión''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014194755/http://www.comfer.gov.ar/004.php |date=2009-10-14 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yankelevich had opposed the 1943 coup d'état, and the advent of one of its most recognizable figures (Perón) to the Presidency antagonized the impresario. Allowing critical commentary of Perón's inaugural address following the event, Radio Belgrano was suspended by government order for one month. The experience persuaded Yankelevich to sell Radio Belgrano to the state for US$1.5 million in 1947. The chain's management was left to Yankelevich, who continued to receive the greater part of the chain's net income (Argentine radio's most profitable), and in turn, the Perón regime dictated content and vetted personnel and performers.&lt;ref name=comfer/&gt;

A personal tragedy motivated Yankelevich to pioneer another, then-inexistent medium in Argentina. The death in 1949 of his son Miguel, who professed fascination with the growth of [[television]] in the [[United States]], led the grieving father to purchase the necessary equipment for its introduction in Argentina. Discussing the authorization for the project with Perón's Communications Minister, Oscar Nicolini, Yankelevich persuaded the reluctant bureaucrat by positing that: 
[[File:Primer cámara de televisión en la argentina.JPG|left|thumb|One of the DuMont cameras imported by Yankelevich]] 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''The money needed to invest in this project does not concern me, for no amount of millions would be too much!'' &lt;ref name=albores&gt;[http://adolfo_salinas.tripod.com/historia/1951.htm ''Albores de la televisión Argentina''] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Importing [[DuMont Laboratories|DuMont]] [[television camera]]s and [[ITT Corporation|ITT]] [[transmitter]]s, he and engineers James Ballantine, Máximo Koeble and Alejandro Spataro prepared the downtown studio and installed a {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} antenna over the 23-story Ministry of Public Works (then Buenos Aires' second-tallest building). Personally operating the antenna, Yankelevich and his team achieved the nation's first television broadcast in 1951, reaching 40 blocks around. Emitting programs through the only TV station in Argentina at the time ([[Canal 7 Argentina|Channel 7]]), all programming on the station was produced by ''Radio Belgrano Televisión'', providing Yankelevich a similarly profitable relationship with the state as the one his radio chain had enjoyed since 1947.&lt;ref name=caras/&gt;&lt;ref name=albores/&gt;

Yankelevich's failing health led to his hospitalization a few months later, and he died in 1952 at the age of 56. Among the items in his hospital room, was a television set.&lt;ref name=caras/&gt;

'''Josephine Porter Crane''' (née Boardman; November 14, 1873 – July 8, 1972) was an American socialite and patron of the arts, co-founder and original trustee of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] and supporter of the [[Dalton School]] of [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=Obituary&gt;{{cite news|last=Obituary|title=Josephine Crane dies in Falmouth|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1972/07/09/91335274.pdf|accessdate=April 11, 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 8, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2016}}
Born Josephine Porter Boardman, in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], she was from a well-to-do family. Her father, William Jarvis Boardman (April 15, 1832 – August 2. 1915), a lawyer and political activist, was the grandson of  United States Senator [[Elijah Boardman]]. Her mother, Florence Sheffield, was the granddaughter of [[Joseph Earl Sheffield]], a major benefactor of Yale University. She had five siblings, including [[Mabel Thorp Boardman]]. The family moved from Ohio to Washington, D.C. in 1887-8, although they maintained connections to Ohio politics including a friendship with the [[Taft family]].

In 1906, she married [[Winthrop Murray Crane]], an American millionaire 20 years her senior, a former [[governor of Massachusetts]] and [[US Senator]], with whom she had three children: Stephen, [[Bruce Crane (businessman)|Bruce]], and [[Louise Crane|Louise]]. Winthrop M. Crane died in 1920. After the Senator's death, she moved to New York City, where she was a founder of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] and was elected to the board of trustees in October 1929.&lt;ref name=Obituary/&gt;

Crane was the benefactress of the prestigious [[Dalton School]], which took its name from the location of the Crane family estate, "Sugar Hill", in [[Dalton, Massachusetts]].  She was the original sponsor for implementing the [[Dalton Plan]] in 1920,&lt;ref name="HighSchool"&gt;{{cite book|last=Parkhurst|first=Helen|authorlink=Helen Parkhurst|title=Education On The Dalton Plan|url=https://archive.org/details/educationontheda028244mbp|accessdate=2007-12-01|year=1922|publisher=E.P. Dutton &amp; Company|location=New York|pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; a much-copied experiment in education.

Crane hosted a weekly literary salon at her apartment at [[820 Fifth Avenue]], [[New York City]] and at the family home on Penzance Point, [[Woods Hole]], [[Massachusetts]]. Guests included [[Marianne Moore]] and [[William Somerset Maugham]].&lt;ref name=Obituary/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
She died of [[pneumonia]] on July 8, 1972, aged 98, at [[Falmouth Hospital]] in [[Falmouth, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=Obituary/&gt;

The '''Josephine B. Crane Foundation''' continues to support the [[Sierra Club]], scientific research and various [[scholarship]]s.

'''Jose Juan Garcia''' a.k.a. '''CheJuan''' (October 22, 1940 – December 17, 2002) was the founder of the international institution called [[Hogares Crea]].

==Early years==
Garcia was born in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico]] where he was raised by his parents. He had a tough childhood and experienced his first imprisonment when he was 15 years old. At a very young age, he became a drug addict and stole in order to pay for his habit.  He went to prison more than once because of his drug problems. However, he was fortunate enough to have met some people who would have a positive influence in his live and change it  forever, among them was the educator [[Ana G. Mendez]]. He also attributed his acceptance of "[[Christ]]" as a reason for his change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblesociety.org/sr_19/sr_19.htm#Drug Center Drug Center Biblesociety]&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Hogares Crea"==
In 1968, Garcia founded in [[Puerto Rico]] "Hogares Crea".  The word "Crea" stands for the re-education of the addict and the community. Those who enter the program do not have to pay a fee, but, must agree to the programs strict rules. Breaking a drug habit is not easy and those who enter the program must adopt new habits which are conductive to recovery. They must go to church on Sundays and sell caramel custards and garbage bags door to door. They also must wash cars and do community services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2003/vol7n28/HogarCrea-en.html Puerto Rico Herald] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203736/http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2003/vol7n28/HogarCrea-en.html |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garcia's program is not financed by the government.  [[Physician|Doctor]]s, [[psychologist]]s and others donate their time. Expenses are covered by the volunteer board of each home. Each home has enough beds for 15 people. 28 thousand people have successfully completed the program, out of 51 thousand addicts who have been treated in 36 years. In is estimated that 92% of those who have completed the program started by Garcia, have completely stayed out of drugs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ich.gov/newsletter/archive/02-23-06_e-newsletter.htm HOGAR CREA DELIVERS INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO RECOVERY]&lt;/ref&gt;

Garcia's Hogares Crea have over 152 facilities worldwide. Some of the other countries besides Puerto Rico, where Hogares Crea are established are: the [[United States]], [[Dominican Republic]],  [[Costa Rica]], [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Panama]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]] and [[Nicaragua]].
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2002/vol6n52/HogarCrea-en.html Hogar CREA: A Struggle To Stay Clean, To Save Souls]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognitions==
Among the awards and recognitions he received are:
* The Citizen of the Year in 1974, Granted by the Puerto Rico Manufacturers Association
* Citizen of the Year 1976, by the Puerto Rico Chamber of Commerce
* An award from [[Ronald Reagan|President Ronald Reagan]] and others for the exemplary community service offered by Hogar CREA in the United States.
* The [[Government of Puerto Rico]] named a plaza in Rio Piedras "Plaza Jose Juan "Cheguan" Garcia".

==Later years==
Jose Juan Garcia died on December 22, 2002 in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]] from [[cancer]].  His son Javier Garcia and his widow Flora Rosario Johnson were involved in a dispute over the control of the organization. The organizations current director is Benjamin Pintor Miranda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexjuris.com/lexlex/lex97133.htm Public Law #133] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022051854/http://www.lexjuris.com/lexlex/lex97133.htm |date=2006-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Reuters'', 20 October 2013, DHAKA | By Shyamantha Asokan and Serajul Quadir&lt;/ref&gt; He is a Fellow of the Institute of Engineers, Bangladesh.  In 2015 he is a member of the executive committee of the International Chamber of Commerce, Bangladesh, and a director of the Chittagong Stock Exchange.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Early life and education==
Ahmed was born on 21 January 1956 in [[Dhaka]]. He graduated in mechanical engineering from [[Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology]] (BUET).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iccbangladesh.org.bd/committee/details/kutubuddin-ahmed |title=Executive Board: Kutubuddin Ahmed |website=International Chamber of Commerce Bangladesh |access-date=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
Ahmed began his career at [[Janata Bank]], but resigned in 1983 to start his own business. Raising the BDT 10 lakh (US$37,500 in 1984) initial capital for what is now known as the [[Envoy Group]] proved difficult. In the end, Ahmed took out a bank loan with his father's house as collateral and brought in a partner, [[Abdus Salam Murshedy]],&lt;ref name="ds20May2017"&gt;{{cite news |last=Mirdha |first=Refayet Ullah |date=20 May 2017 |title=Fortune favours the brave |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/supplements/fortune-favours-the-brave-1407907 |newspaper=The Daily Star |access-date=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[striker (football)|striker]] for [[Mohammedan Sporting Club (Dhaka)|Mohammedan Sporting Club]] who had gained fame in 1982 by scoring a league-record 27 goals, but who had no previous business experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wedson's near miss |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/wedsons-near-miss-34787 |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=25 July 2014 |access-date=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.envoy-group.com/md-profile.php |title=Managing Director's Profile: Abdus Salam Murshedy |website=Envoy Group |access-date=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the partners set up a small factory in the [[Khilgaon Thana]] area of Dhaka, equipped it with 46 sewing machines, and hired 200 garment workers. Initially the company sub-contracted for other garment manufacturers.&lt;ref name="ds20May2017" /&gt; They were early participants in a sector that would become a powerhouse of the Bangladesh economy,&lt;ref name="ds5Dec2014"&gt;{{cite news |last=Mirdha |first=Refayet Ullah |date=5 December 2014 |title=From baby steps to giant strides |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/from-baby-steps-to-giant-strides-53432 |newspaper=The Daily Star |access-date=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but orders were sporadic at first, and the factory was idle for long spells. Sometimes they had to borrow from banks to meet payroll. The turning point came when they received their first order as a primary contractor, 6,500 trousers for a Swedish retailer.&lt;ref name="ds20May2017" /&gt;

The agent who placed the order was impressed with their work and directed more business their way. In the next 16 months, Envoy Group recorded a BDT 1 crore (US$385,000 in 1985) profit. They paid off their debt and bought two more garment factories, building on the experience gained running their first.&lt;ref name="ds20May2017" /&gt;

Through expansion, by attracting investment and purchasing existing businesses, Ahmed led the company as it grew over the years into a large manufacturing and exporting group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailystar.net/business/envoy-textiles-raises-tk-70cr-through-commercial-papers-1205938 "Envoy Textiles raises Tk 70cr through commercial papers"].

==Biography==
Ebata was born in Ollombo, [[Republic of the Congo]], on 12 March 1969. He emigrated to [[Cuba]] where he attained a law degree from the [[University of Havana]] in 1994. He then emigrated to [[Canada]] and completed master's degree studies in Commercial Law at the [[University of Ottawa]] in 1996, and received an [[LLM]] degree in Business Law from the [[University of Montreal]] in 2004.

==Career==
Ebata was variously employed at the Canadian [[Ministry of Natural Resources (Ontario)|Ministry of Natural Resources]], [[Ministry of Human Resources (Canada)|Ministry of Human Resources]], [[Commission for Public Service (Canada)|Commission for Public Service]] and [[Environment Canada|Ministry of Environment]].

Ebata left government service to form a private firm specializing in insurance and taxation, representing clients in the [[Tax Court of Canada]]. Between 2001 and 2004, he shifted his attention to lobbying on behalf of businesses and foreign governments.

Several years later, he founded the [[Orion Group SA]] and focused its activities on the trading of petroleum products, i.e. the purchase / resale of crude and refined petroleum products, mainly on the African continent. He later expanded the scope of the activities of his group to the leasing of aircraft and chauffeur driven cars in Africa and Europe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2123">'''Marcel Louis Ospel''' (born 8 February 1950 in [[Basel]]) was a former Chairman of the Board of Directors of [[UBS AG]], the largest bank in [[Switzerland]].

Marcel Ospel had an income in 2005 of around 24 million [[Swiss Franc|CHF]].

After the company reported 19 billion U.S. dollar write-downs, Mr. Ospel was forced to withdraw his candidacy for re-election to the Board at the Annual General Meeting on 23 April 2008. It has been suggested that Ospel should be prosecuted for criminal negligence and gross mismanagement of UBS*[https://www.ubs.com/global/en/about_ubs/about_us/news.html]

== Timeline ==
* 1977-1980 Swiss Bank Corporation in the Central Planning and Marketing Division
* 1980-1984 SBC London and New York in the Capital Markets division
* 1984-1987 Managing Director with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets
* 1987-1990 In charge of Securities Trading and Sales at SBC
* 1990-1995 Member of the Executive Board of SBC
* 1995-1996 CEO of SBC Warburg
* 1996-1998 President and Group Chief Executive Officer of [[Swiss Bank Corporation]] (SBC)
* 1999-2001 Group Chief Executive Officer, UBS AG
* 2001-2008 Chairman of the Board of Directors, UBS AG

== Recognition ==
: '''2003''' marketing prize of ''Gesellschaft für Marketing'' for UBS world-wide single-brand strategy.

== Criticisms ==
In 2001, he was criticized for evading requests to extend [[Swissair]]'s line of credit, leading some people to believe that the dramatic grounding of Swissair planes on 2 October was Ospel's responsibility.  These theories were later countered by information and details revealed in the media, and by the Swissair trial, held in 2007, which seemed to indicate otherwise.

'''New Entrepreneurs Foundation''' (NEF), founded in 2010, is a London-based [[nonprofit organization]] that runs development programmes for aspiring [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newentrepreneursfoundation.com|title=New Entrepreneurs Foundation|website=New Entrepreneurs Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in 2010 by Oliver Pawle, Dee Stirling, [[Nigel Rudd|Sir Nigel Rudd]] and [[Mervyn Davies, Baron Davies of Abersoch|The Lord Davies of Abersoch CBE]], the NEF was designed to support the next generation of UK entrepreneurs building new businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newentrepreneursfoundation.com/about-us-our-vision/|title=About Us - New Entrepreneurs Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the organisation launched a guide for social entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/social-enterprise-network/2013/dec/19/new-guide-tips-advice-social-entrepreneur&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, it was announced a new organisation would be set up by NEF and The Centre for Entrepreneurs to work on long-term challenges to entrepreneurship in the United Kingdom. One million pounds was donated to the project by [[Mikhail Fridman]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/oligarch-s-helping-hand-for-the-next-generation-bvpq20d9m&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
NEF solely focuses on the entrepreneurial potential of its intake rather than existing venture ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newentrepreneursfoundation.com/programme-explained/what-we-look-for/|title=What we look for - New Entrepreneurs Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not require the contribution of equity from its participants’ ventures. It is entirely funded through corporate and individual sponsorship. See Sponsors and Funding for more information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newentrepreneursfoundation.com/our-sponsors/|title=Our sponsors - New Entrepreneurs Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based in London the organisation's direction is decided  by a [[Board of trustees|Board of Trustees]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newentrepreneursfoundation.com/about-us-our-vision/our-leadership/|title=Our leadership - New Entrepreneurs Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and CEO Neeta Patel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newentrepreneursfoundation.com/about-us-our-vision/executive-team/|title=Executive team - New Entrepreneurs Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the founder of the Singapore-based organisation Hotel Properties, and a shareholder in many businesses. ''[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]'' estimates the net worth of Ong and his wife at $1.8 billion (as of July 2014), making them the 15th richest people in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/profile/beng-seng-christina-ong-ong Forbes, "Singapore's 50 Richest: #15 Ong Beng Seng &amp; Christina Ong"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Ong was born in January 1946,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/UAu09ERPsOGNkjEA6BrJHhqJy9M/appointments |title=Ong Beng Seng ONG - Personal Appointments (free information from Companies House) |publisher=Beta.companieshouse.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Malaysia. When he was four years old, his family relocated to Singapore. His career began when he joined an insurance firm for ships. In 1975, he joined [[Kuo International]], founded by businessman Peter Fu Yun Siak and there he met his later-to-be spouse, [[Christina Ong|Christina]].&lt;ref name="Independent 1"/&gt;

==Career==
After beginning his trading career at Kuo International, Ong went on to found his own firm, [[Hotel Properties Limited]]. Today, he controls many businesses, including a few based in [[Bond Street]] in London, and his investments are worth tens of millions of dollars.&lt;ref name="Independent 1"/&gt; He is a well-established hotelier, having bought and built many hotels worldwide.&lt;ref name="Independent 1"/&gt; Ong is credited as one among the few who brought  the [[Singapore Grand Prix]] to the country, the first [[Formula One]] night race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.formula1.com/races/in_detail/singapore_854/circuit_history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124034034/http://www.formula1.com/races/in_detail/singapore_854/circuit_history.html |archivedate=24 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
A "glitzy figure in Singapore and abroad",&lt;ref name="Independent 1"/&gt; Ong is married to [[Christina Ong]] (née Fu), the daughter of a businessman. They have two children, a daughter and a son.&lt;ref name="Independent 1"/&gt; Ong was described by Hilary Clarke of ''[[The Independent]]'' as "media shy" and "notoriously secretive".&lt;ref name="Independent 1"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Independent]] |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/profile-beng-seng-and-christina-ong-asian-pair-sell-west-buy-east-1153092.html |title=Profile: Beng Seng and Christina Ong: Asian pair sell west, buy east |date=29 March 1998 |first=Hilary |last=Clarke }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite that, he is known to be well-acquainted with many Hollywood celebrities.&lt;ref name="Independent 1"/&gt;

==Wealth==
Ong's business approach is to "[b]uy when rents and properties are cheap and sell when they are not."&lt;ref name="Independent 1"/&gt; As of July 2012, the Ong family, comprising Ong and his wife, is worth $1.6 [[list of billionaires|billion]], based on estimates by Forbes, making the couple Singapore's 10th richest persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/beng-seng-ong/ |title=Ong Beng Seng &amp; Christina Ong |publisher=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=4 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PerForm''' and '''PerForm PRO''' were electronic form programs, initially designed to work under [[Graphics Environment Manager|GEM]] in [[DOS]]. Later versions were designed to work in [[Windows 3.1]], at which point it was succeeded by [[FormFlow]]. 

The initial version of PerForm was created in 1988 and was the first product released by [[Canada|Canadian]] software firm [[Delrina]], which became best known for its later fax software program, [[WinFax]]. Chief Technical Officer [[Bert Amato]] and President of the company [[Mark Skapinker]] came up with the idea for the product while working as consultants that what their clients wanted was a way to fill in forms electronically, rather than an easier way to create paper-based forms from a computer.&lt;ref name="Softwarriors p34"&gt;{{Cite journal

  | first = Ann
  | title = Attack of the Softwarriors
  | journal = Report on Business Magazine
  | page = 34
  | date = March 1994
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program consisted of two parts: a form design module which gave users a graphical user interface for creating and arranging form elements, using tools largely familiar to those using desktop publishing or paint programs of the era, and a separate form filling program which would display the resulting form that the user could then fill in&lt;ref name="Zisman"&gt;{{cite web

 |website= Alan Zisman on Technology
 |publisher= INPUT
 |access-date= November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Those entering information into the forms could not change or alter the forms; they were limited to adding information in the various form fields on screen. Some of the potential uses of the program included being able to create invoices, payment records, personnel and payroll forms, and just about any other standardized  form that may have been required.&lt;ref name="Zisman"&gt;{{cite web

There was significant and long-term uptake of electronic forms products within governmental agencies both in Canada&lt;ref name="TransportCanada"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tc.gc.ca/gol/environment.htm |title="TRANSPORT CANADA'S IM/IT ENVIRONMENT 2006/2007", with a contemporary reference to the use of Delrina FormFlow |accessdate=2007-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070902012852/http://www.tc.gc.ca/gol/environment.htm |archivedate=2007-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States,&lt;ref name="USOffice"&gt;{{cite web

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the firm's early major software deals included a multi-year agreement to sell PerForm to the U.S. Navy in 1990.&lt;ref name="Softwarriors p34"/&gt; Soon after the software was installed on [[Compaq]] [[laptops]] that accompanied U.S. troops during the [[First Gulf War]], where it was used to requisition "everything from [[Coca-Cola]] to [[Outhouse|privies]]".&lt;ref name="Softwarriors p34"/&gt; Other significant volume sales went to [[3M]] and [[Rockwell International]].&lt;ref name="Softwarriors p34"/&gt; What helped set apart Delrina's electronic forms from its competitors in product reviews included its easy-to-use interface, its extensive development tools, and its comparatively low price.&lt;ref name="FormTest"&gt;{{Cite journal
  | title = Putting electronic forms to the test
  | journal = InfoWorld
  | pages = 93–105
  | date = May 2, 1994

  | first = Stuart
  | title = Form is function

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1991 [[InfoWorld]] selected PerForm Pro
as its "Product of the Year" in the electronic forms
category, and [[PC World Magazine]] gave the product it's "Best Buy" designation.&lt;ref name="ProductOfTheYear1990"&gt;{{cite press release
  | title = Delrina's PerFORM Chosen Product of the Year

The electronic forms division of Delrina was sold to [[JetForm]] in 1996. JetForm in turn was bought by [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]], and the electronic forms products were officially discontinued in 2004.

'''''Railroad Tycoon II''''' is a [[train simulator|train]] and [[business simulation]] video game for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[Dreamcast]] in the [[Railroad Tycoon (series)|''Railroad Tycoon'' series]]. The Dreamcast version is a Gold Edition with improved graphics and gameplay.  ''Railroad Tycoon II: Gold Edition'' was ported to [[Linux]] by [[Loki Software]].

Gameplay is displayed in [[dimetric projection|dimetric view]], unlike the top-down view of ''[[Railroad Tycoon]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Railroadtyccon screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|Screenshot from ''Railroad Tycoon II''.]]
''Railroad Tycoon II'' is a [[railroad simulation]] that covers the entire history of railroads from inception to the present day and beyond. The player chooses a map and assumes the role of chairman of a [[railroad company]]. The player tries to make profits for investors and completes various other objectives while being hindered by rivals, random events such as train breakdowns, [[train robber]]s, economic swings, and scripted events particular to the scenario.

Most of the gameplay consists of building tracks, stations and trains, which are used for hauling passengers and freight from one station to another. Delivery revenue can vary by time, distance, demand, cargo type, economic state, station improvements and difficulty level. Companies can connect to and use each other's track and stations, so revenue can be split. Expenses include the fuel, track and engine maintenance and management fee. The fuel cost depends on the cargo weight and the distance each engine runs. Engine maintenance depends on engine age and the engine's type (some locomotives cost more to maintain than others). The elder engines cost more to keep them on the line. The track maintenance is solely calculated from track [[Distance|mileage]].

The player will determine what kind of cargo(es) to put on/off at each station that the player adds to its routing. Way-points may also be inserted to override default track selection where multiple paths are possible.

There are many industries in the game, and each can produce and/or convert specific cargoes. For example, coal mines produce coal, iron mines produce iron, and, in the advanced game, a [[steel mill]] can convert 1 load of [[iron]] plus 1 load of [[coal]] into 2 loads of [[steel]]. The players are encouraged to find a chain of production to make new cargo by hauling the right type of cargo to each step of the industries. By doing this right, the player can haul raw materials one way, "create" manufactured return cargo, and make even more money hauling finished products back the other way.

===Locomotives and industry===
One of the key elements of game play relates to the player purchasing and operating a variety of locomotives, each of which possesses different attributes relating to speed, fuel type, preferred cargo, and the ability to traverse hills and steep track grades. In general, the player should balance the cost of operating a train and the time required to transport cargo, with the balance being that the profit from cargo delivery outweighs train operating costs. The player also may purchase various industrial plants to earn extra money based on amount of cargo received and delivered. Basic industry, such as [[bakery|bakeries]], [[Textile manufacturing|textile mill]]s, and [[Tool and die maker|tool and die factories]], earns less profit than advanced factories such as [[Canning|canneries]], steel mills and [[car|automobile]] plants, although the latter require multiple goods delivered to produce one final product. Furthermore, idle industries which do not produce goods will generate a negative profit, thus increasing overall operating costs and [[Overhead (business)|overhead]].

The following locomotives are available for game play. Locomotives are only seen in specific time periods and scenarios. In addition to the attributes described above, locomotives are subject to "mechanical reliability", which is a randomly generated factor influencing how often a locomotive will break down. All locomotives begin their operational lives with a set chance of mechanical failure, with some types more prone to breakdowns than others. Breakdown percentage chance increases the older a locomotive becomes. A train may also suffer a [[train wreck|wreck]], which completely destroys the locomotive and all hauled cargo.

The game also features one futuristic train, the "Mag-Lev TBX-1" which is portrayed as released in the (then) future date of 2008.  The train operates using [[Maglev]] technology which, as of 2015, has been prototyped in both Europe and Japan.  The first successful Maglev train to be operated was the [[SCMaglev]] with speeds approaching 400 miles per hour.

===Economics===

Gameplay also includes financial manipulation of companies, issuing [[bond (finance)|bond]]s, [[share repurchase]]s, [[stock issue]]s, manipulating [[dividend]]s, merging with other companies and declaring [[bankruptcy]]. These features are required in some scenarios and may be used for either great financial gain or total fiscal disaster.

In normal financial mode, the player may buy or sell any companies' stocks at various prices depending upon the economy. On advanced settings, the broker may allow the player to [[margin (finance)#Margin buying|buy on margin]] or [[short (finance)|short sell]] stocks if he has enough value of stocks or cash to rely on. The computer players may also engage in these practices and will attempt to bankrupt the player when he is heavily in debt.

The economy may fluctuate during gameplay, with five economic states possible: Booming, Prosperity, Normal, [[Recession]] and [[Depression (economics)|Depression]]. When the economy is good, the revenue of hauled goods and stock prices will be higher. Bond interest rates will also be adjusted with the economy level, including the interest received from cash and the interest paid for the bonds.

===Campaigns and scenarios===

The original game features eighteen missions, divided between North America, Europe and the rest of the world. The missions can be played on three difficulty levels, and each also includes three listed objectives.  Completing only the first objective awards the player a bronze medal, the first two a silver medal, and all three a gold medal. The player may play any mission in each set as many times as they wish; they may also continue even though a mission has been failed. The final score for the whole 18 mission campaign is calculated by the difficulty level and the number of each type of medal achieved.

In addition to the campaign, ''Railroad Tycoon II'' features many single scenarios. As with the campaign, each scenario is based on a geographical location, which may be fictional. Most scenarios also have a medal system similar to that of the campaign, although any scenario may be played in [[sandbox mode]] as well. Many scenarios constrain the player to some specific point on the timeline and feature scripted events: for example, the [[Korea]]n map presents an [[alternate history|alternative history]] as the player is informed about the averted [[Korean civil war]].

Additional single scenarios may be created using the [[map editor]] included. Maps may be imported, drawn from scratch, or edited from existing maps and saved under new names. Many fan creations have been shared on various [[fan site]]s.

==Development==
In late 1997, [[Bruce Shelley]] said of his chance of developing ''Railroad Tycoon II'', "I would be happy to work on such a game but there are real doubts about its ability to generate sufficient sales in this blockbuster market where a few of the games make most of the money."&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/19990506043125/http://www.gamecenter.com:80/News/Item/Cont/0,4,0-1280_2,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soundtrack===
The soundtrack of ''Railroad Tycoon II'' consist mostly of classical "railroad" blues and bluegrass genre from the era the game revolves around. These pieces were not, unlike most contemporary games, midi files, but rather high quality studio recordings; some even with vocals. This fact has contributed to the solid ratings this game has received.&lt;!--The soundtrack consists of the following tracks:--&gt;

===Editions===
''Railroad Tycoon 2: Gold'' is a collection of ''Railroad Tycoon 2'' and ''Railroad Tycoon 2: The Second Century'', in one package. ''Railroad Tycoon 2: Platinum'' is equivalent to the ''Gold Edition'' plus over 50 community-made maps added and enhanced mouse-wheel support. Maps (scenarios) developed specifically for the platinum edition may not function in some earlier versions. The last official [[patch (computing)|patch]] to ''Railroad Tycoon 2'' was [https://web.archive.org/web/20130414213020/http://www.shacknews.com/file/2301/railroad-tycoon-2-platinum-156-patch platinum v1.56] on February 19, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = PhilSteinmeyer.com  » Blog Archive   » The missing Railroad Tycoon 2 map…|url = http://www.philsteinmeyer.com/55/the-missing-railroad-tycoon-2-map/|website = www.philsteinmeyer.com|access-date = 2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Railroad Tycoon II'' was a commercial success.&lt;ref name=wired /&gt; Its sales surpassed 500,000 copies globally by February 1999,&lt;ref name=expansion&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050207040945/http://cdmag.com/articles/017/193/rr2_ep.html |url=http://cdmag.com:80/articles/017/193/rr2_ep.html |title=''Railroad Tycoon II: The Second Century'' Expansion Pack Announced |author=Fudge, James |date=February 19, 1999 |work=[[Computer Games Magazine|Computer Games Strategy Plus]] |archivedate=February 7, 2005 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and its computer version alone sold more than 1.5 million copies by August 2001.&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930192333/https://www.wired.com/2001/08/game-over-for-max-payne-makers/ |url=https://www.wired.com/2001/08/game-over-for-max-payne-makers/ |title=Game Over for ''Max Payne'' Makers | author=Shachtman, Noah | date=August 16, 2001 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |archivedate=September 30, 2017 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the game and its ''Gold'' edition together sold 351,000 copies by October 2001.&lt;ref name=godsales /&gt; According to Franz J.

By August 2000, ''Railroad Tycoon II'' had been released in 39 unique [[Stock keeping unit|SKU]]s worldwide, including eight Windows versions in English alone. PopTop's Phil Steinmeyer wrote that roughly 33% of the game's sales derived from the ''Gold'' edition and ''Second Century'' expansion, and that the port for Macintosh "sold respectably", while the PlayStation version was unsuccessful. He accredited the game's number of versions with its commercial success, and wrote in August 2000, "Overall, had we only released the original game, in English, for Windows only, our sales would be less than a quarter of what they are now."&lt;ref name=steinmeyersales&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050317062552/http://www.cdmag.com/articles/029/034/isf_column.html |url=http://www.cdmag.com:80/articles/029/034/isf_column.html |title=Inside the Sausage Factory; Language Barriers |author=Steinmeyer, Phil |date=August 14, 2000 |work=[[Computer Games Magazine]] |archivedate=March 17, 2005 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Steinmeyer remarked that ''Railroad Tycoon II'' continued to sell "pretty well".&lt;ref name=cgmprev&gt;{{cite journal |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100303225823/http://www.cgonline.com/computer-games-magazine/article/return_of_the_king1/ |url=http://www.cgonline.com/computer-games-magazine/article/return_of_the_king1/ |title=Return of the King |author=Sones, Benjamin E. | issue=150 | date=May 2003 |work=[[Computer Games Magazine]] |archivedate=March 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Raoul Warocqué''' ([[Brussels]], 4 February 1870 – [[Brussels]], 28 May 1917), was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] industrialist from [[Wallonia]].

==Biography==
Raoul was the great-grandson of [[Nicolas Warocqué]], the founder of the prominent Warocqué family. His father was [[Arthur Warocqué]], (1835–80),&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120907064944/http://www.morlanwelz.be/histoire/vandeneynde/arthur_warocque.htm Arthur Warocqué (French)]&lt;/ref&gt; a promotor of Belgian horticulture, after whom the [[Araceae|arum]] ''[[Anthurium warocqueanum]]'' was named.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[James Herbert Veitch]]| title=Hortus Veitchii| publisher=[[Caradoc Doy]] | year=2006|edition=reprint|pages=227| isbn=0-9553515-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warocqué was a [[philanthropist]] and a believer in [[paternalism]]. He was a [[freemason]] of the [[Grand Orient of Belgium]], Belgian [[patriotism|patriot]] and a [[monarchist|royalist]]. At the [[Universite Libre de Bruxelles]] (ULB), he participated in the ''Jeune Garde libérale'' (Young Liberal Guard). 

[[File:Université de Mons-Hainaut (1).JPG|thumb|Building of the former ''École de Commerce'' in [[Mons]] which Warocqué founded]]
Raoul Warocqué made the coal mines of [[Morlanwelz|Mariemont]] successful, and at 21 years of age had established a considerable fortune. A careful investment policy made him the richest man in Belgium at the beginning of the 20th century. His industrial ventures were numerous, such as in the coal mines of [[Campine]] as well as in other industrial sectors including [[Clabecq]], Gas and Electricity of Hainaut, railroads and coal mines in [[China]], tobacco in [[Portugal]], and others.

As a politician he was mayor of [[Morlanwelz]] and liberal deputy of [[Thuin]]. In [[Mariemont, Belgium|Mariemont]] and in [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]], he founded liberal organizations. He supported bills favorable to the [[working class]], while at the same time he was opposed to the right to strike. His most noted interventions relate to the [[Belgian Congo]], military service, compulsory education and coal mining.

As a philanthropist, he created open dormitories in Brussels (1891) which distributed soup and bread to the poor. He supported the ULB, the ''Ecole des Mines'' (School of Mining), and founded the ''Institut commercial'' (Commercial Institute) in [[Mons]] as well as the ''Athénée du Centre'' (Central Athenaeum) in [[Morlanwelz]], an orphanage, a childcare facility, a maternity hospital, and some other institutions.

He was also one of the financiers of the [[List of world expositions|World Fair of Brussels]] ([[Brussels International (1897)|1897]] and 1910) and of [[Charleroi]] (1911). He fell ill and died during [[World War I]], in 1917. On his death in 1917, his art and antiquities collections were donated to the Belgian state and now form the basis for the [[Musée royal de Mariemont]].

{{Accounting}}
In [[financial audit]]ing of [[public company|public companies]] in the United States, '''  SOX 404 top–down risk assessment''' (TDRA) is a financial [[risk assessment]] performed to comply with Section 404 of the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002]] (SOX 404). The term is used by the U.S. [[Public Company Accounting Oversight Board]] (PCAOB) and the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC). The TDRA is used to determine the scope and required evidence to support management's testing of its [[internal control]]s under SOX404. It is also used by the external auditor to issue a formal opinion on the company's internal controls.  However, as a result of the passage of Auditing Standard No. 5, which the SEC has since approved, external auditors are no longer required to provide an opinion on management's assessment of its own internal controls.

Detailed guidance about performing the TDRA is included with PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 5 (Release 2007-005 "An audit of internal control over financial reporting that is integrated with an audit of financial statements")&lt;ref&gt;[http://pcaobus.org/Standards/Auditing/Pages/Auditing_Standard_5.aspx PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 5]&lt;/ref&gt; and the SEC's interpretive guidance (Release 33-8810/34-55929) "Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/rules/interp/2007/33-8810.pdf SEC Interpretive Guidance]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/soxcomp.htm SEC List of SOX Guidance]&lt;/ref&gt; This guidance is applicable for 2007 assessments for companies with 12/31 [[fiscal year]]-ends.  The PCAOB release superseded the existing PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 2, while the SEC guidance is the first detailed guidance for management specifically. PCAOB reorganized the auditing standards as of December 31, 2017, with the relevant SOX guidance now included under AS2201: ''An Audit of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting That is Integrated with An Audit of Financial Statements''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pcaobus.org/Standards/Auditing/Pages/AS2201.aspx PCAOB AS2201 An Audit of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting that is Integrated with an Audit of Financial Statements-December 31, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

The language used by the SEC chairman in announcing the new guidance was very direct: "Congress never intended that the 404 process should become inflexible, burdensome, and wasteful. The objective of Section 404 is to provide meaningful disclosure to investors about the effectiveness of a company's internal controls systems, without creating unnecessary compliance burdens or wasting [[shareholder]] resources." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2007/2007-101.htm SEC Press Release 2007-101]&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on the 2007 guidance, SEC and PCAOB directed a significant reduction in costs associated with SOX 404 compliance, by focusing efforts on higher-risk areas and reducing efforts in lower-risk areas.

TDRA is a hierarchical framework that involves applying specific risk factors to determine the scope and evidence required in the assessment of internal control.  Both the PCAOB and SEC guidance contain similar frameworks.  At each step, qualitative or quantitative risk factors are used to focus the scope of the SOX404 assessment effort and determine the evidence required. Key steps include:
# identifying significant financial reporting elements (accounts or disclosures)
# identifying material [[financial statements|financial statement]] risks within these accounts or disclosures
# determining which [[entity-level controls]] would address these risks with sufficient precision
# determining which [[financial transaction|transaction]]-level controls would address these risks in the absence of precise entity-level controls
# determining the nature, extent, and timing of evidence gathered to complete the assessment of in-scope controls
  
Management is required to document how it has interpreted and applied its TDRA to arrive at the scope of controls tested.  In addition, the sufficiency of evidence required (i.e., the timing, nature, and extent of control testing) is based upon management (and the auditor's) TDRA.  As such, TDRA has significant [[compliance cost]] implications for SOX404.

==Method==

The guidance is principles-based, providing significant flexibility in the TDRA approach.  There are two major steps: 1) Determining the scope of controls to include in testing; and 2) Determining the nature, timing and extent of testing procedures to perform.

==Determining scope==
The key SEC principle related to establishing the scope of controls for testing may be stated as follows: "Focus on controls that adequately address the risk of material misstatement." This involves the following steps:

===Determine significance and misstatement risk for financial reporting elements (accounts and disclosures)===

Under the PCAOB AS 5 guidance, the auditor is required to determine whether an account is "significant" or not (i.e., yes or no), based on a series of risk factors related to the likelihood of financial statement error and magnitude (dollar value) of the account.  Significant accounts and disclosures are in-scope for assessment, so management typically includes this information in its documentation and generally performs this analysis for review by the auditor.  This documentation may be referred to in practice as the "significant account analysis."  Accounts with large balances are generally presumed to be significant (i.e., in-scope) and require some type of testing.

New under the SEC guidance is the concept of also rating each significant account for "misstatement risk" (low, medium, or high), based on similar factors used to determine significance.  The misstatement risk ranking is a key factor used to determine the nature, timing, and extent of evidence to be obtained.  As risk increases, the expected sufficiency of testing evidence accumulated for controls related to significant accounts increases (see section below regarding testing &amp; evidence decisions).

Both significance and misstatement risk are inherent risk concepts, meaning that conclusions regarding which accounts are in-scope are determined before considering the effectiveness of controls.

===Identify financial reporting objectives===
Objectives help set the context and boundaries in which risk assessment occurs. The [[Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission|COSO]] Internal Control-Integrated Framework, a standard of [[internal control]] widely used for SOX compliance, states: "A precondition to risk assessment is the establishment of objectives..." and "Risk assessment is the identification and analysis of relevant risks to achievement of the objectives."  The SOX guidance states several hierarchical levels at which risk assessment may occur, such as entity, account, assertion, process, and transaction class. Objectives, risks, and controls may be analyzed at each of these levels. The concept of a top-down risk assessment means considering the higher-levels of the framework first, to filter from consideration as much of the lower-level assessment activity as possible.

There are many approaches to top-down risk assessment. Management may explicitly document control objectives, or use texts and other references to ensure their risk statement and control statement documentation is complete. There are two primary levels at which objectives (and also controls) are defined:  ''[[Entity-level controls|entity-level]]'' and ''[[Management assertions|assertion]] level''.

An example of an ''entity-level'' control objective is: "Employees are aware of the Company's Code of Conduct."  The COSO 1992/1994 Framework defines each of the five components of internal control (i.e., Control Environment, Risk Assessment, Information &amp; Communication, Monitoring, and Control Activities). Evaluation suggestions are included at the end of key COSO chapters and in the "Evaluation Tools" volume; these can be modified into objective statements.

An example of an ''assertion-level'' control objective is "Revenue is recognized only upon the delivery of products and services." Lists of assertion-level control objectives are available in most financial auditing textbooks. Excellent examples are also available in AICPA Statement on Auditing Standards No. 110 (SAS 110) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aicpa.org/download/members/div/auditstd/SAS110.PDF AICPA Statement on Auditing Standards No. 110]&lt;/ref&gt; for the inventory process.  SAS 106 includes the latest guidance on financial statement assertions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aicpa.org/download/members/div/auditstd/SAS106.PDF AICPA Statement on Auditing Standards No. 106]&lt;/ref&gt;

Control objectives may be organized within processes, to help organize the documentation, ownership and TDRA approach. Typical financial processes include expense &amp; accounts payable (purchase to payment), payroll, revenue and accounts receivable (order to cash collection), capital assets, etc. This is how most auditing textbooks organize control objectives. Processes can also be risk-ranked.

COSO issued revised guidance in 2013 effective for companies with year-end dates after December 15, 2014. This essentially requires control statements to be referenced to 17 "principles" beneath the five COSO "components." There are approximately 80 "points of focus" that can be evaluated specifically against the controls of the company, to form a conclusion about the 17 principles (i.e., each principle has several relevant points of focus). Most of the principles and points of focus relate to entity-level controls. As of June 2013 the approaches used in practice were in the early stages of development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coso.org/documents/COSO%20McNallyTransition%20Article-Final%20COSO%20Version%20Proof_5-31-13.pdf COSO-J. Stephen McNally-The 2013 COSO Framework &amp; SOX Compliance]&lt;/ref&gt; One approach would be to add the principles and points of focus as criteria within a database and reference each to the relevant controls that address them.

===Identify material risks to the achievement of the objectives===
One definition of risk is anything that can interfere with the achievement of an objective. A risk statement is an expression of "what can go wrong." Under the 2007 guidance (i.e., SEC interpretive guidance and PCAOB AS5), those risks that inherently have a "reasonably possible" likelihood of causing a material error in the account balance or disclosure are the material misstatement risks ("MMR"). Note that this is a slight amendment to the "more than remote" likelihood language of PCAOB AS2, intended to limit the scope to fewer, more critical material risks and related controls.

An example of a risk statement corresponding to the above assertion level control objective might be: "The risk that revenue is recognized ''before'' the delivery of products and services." Note that this reads very similarly to the control objective, only stated in the negative.

Management develops a listing of MMR, linked to the specific accounts and/or control objectives developed above. MMR may be identified by asking the question: "What can go wrong related to the account, assertion or objective?"  MMR may arise within the accounting function (e.g., regarding estimates, judgments, and policy decisions) or the internal and external environment (e.g., corporate departments that feed the accounting department information, economic and stock market variables, etc.)  Communication interfaces, changes (people, process or systems), fraud vulnerability, management override of controls, incentive structure, complex transactions, and degree of judgment or human intervention involved in processing are other high-risk topics.

In general, management considers questions such as: What is really difficult to get right? What accounting problems have we had in the past? What has changed? Who might be capable or motivated to commit fraud or fraudulent financial reporting?  As a high percentage of financial frauds historically have involved the overstatement of revenue, such accounts typically merit additional attention. AICPA Statement on Auditing Standards No. 109 (SAS 109)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aicpa.org/download/members/div/auditstd/SAS109.PDF AICPA Statement on Auditing Standards No. 109]&lt;/ref&gt; also provides helpful guidance regarding financial risk assessment.

Under the 2007 guidance, companies are required to perform a fraud risk assessment and assess related controls.  This typically involves identifying scenarios in which theft or loss could occur and determining if existing control procedures effectively manage the risk to an acceptable level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.som.yale.edu/faculty/Sunder/FinancialFraud/Elements%20of%20Antifraud%20Program%20-%20White%20Paper.pdf PWC – Elements of an Anti-Fraud Program]&lt;/ref&gt; The risk that senior management might override important financial controls to manipulate financial reporting is also a key area of focus in the fraud risk assessment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aicpa.org/audcommctr/download/achilles_heel.pdf AICPA Management Override] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927040701/http://www.aicpa.org/audcommctr/download/achilles_heel.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, many companies combine the objective and risk statements when describing MMR. These MMR statements serve as a target, focusing efforts to identify [[Mitigating control (financial auditing)|mitigating controls]].

===Identify controls that address the material misstatement risks (MMR)===
For each MMR, management determines which control (or controls) address the risk "sufficiently" and "precisely" (PCAOB AS#5) or "effectively" (SEC Guidance) enough to mitigate it.  The word "mitigate" in this context means the control (or controls) reduces the likelihood of material error presented by the MMR to a "remote" probability. This level of assurance is required because a material weakness must be disclosed if there is a "reasonably possible" or "probable" possibility of a material misstatement of a significant account. Even though multiple controls may bear on the risk, only those that address it as defined above are included in the assessment. In practice, these are called the "in-scope" or "key" controls that require testing.

The SEC Guidance defines the probability terms as follows, per FAS5 ''Accounting for Contingent Liabilities'':
# "Probable: The future event or events are likely to occur."
# "Reasonably possible:  The chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely."
# "Remote:  The chance of the future event or events occurring is slight."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fasb.org/cs/BlobServer?blobkey=id&amp;blobnocache=true&amp;blobwhere=1175820910926&amp;blobheader=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobheadername2=Content-Length&amp;blobheadername1=Content-Disposition&amp;blobheadervalue2=164185&amp;blobheadervalue1=filename%3Dfas5.pdf&amp;blobcol=urldata&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs FASB: Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.5 - March 1975]&lt;/ref&gt;

Judgment is typically the best guide for selecting the most important controls relative to a particular risk for testing. PCAOB AS5 introduces a three-level framework describing entity-level controls at varying levels of precision (direct, monitoring, and indirect.) As a practical matter, control precision by type of control, in order of most precise to least, may be interpreted as:

#Transaction-specific (transaction-level) – Authorization or review (or preventive system controls) related to specific, individual transactions;
#Transaction summary (transaction-level) – Review of reports listing individual transactions;
#Period-end reporting (account-level) – Journal entry review, account reconciliations or detailed account analysis (e.g., utility spending per store);
#Management review controls (direct entity level) – Fluctuation analyses of income statement accounts at varying levels of aggregation or monthly reporting package containing summarized financial and operational information;
#Monitoring controls (monitoring entity level) - Self-assessment and internal audit reviews to verify controls are designed and implemented effectively; and
#Indirect (indirect entity level) - Controls that are not linked to specific transactions, such as the control environment (e.g., tone set by management and hiring practices).

It is increasingly difficult to argue that reliance upon controls is reasonable in achieving assertion-level objectives as one travels along this continuum from most precise to least, and as risk increases.  A combination of type 3-6 controls above may help reduce the number of type 1 &amp; 2 controls (transaction-level) that require assessment for particular risks, especially in lower-risk, transaction-intensive processes.

Under the 2007 guidance, it appears acceptable to place significantly more reliance on the period-end controls (i.e., review of journal entries and account reconciliations) and management review controls than in the past, effectively addressing many of the material misstatement risks and enabling either: a) the elimination of a significant number of transactional controls from the prior-year's scope of testing; or b) reducing related evidence obtained.  The number of transaction-level controls may be reduced significantly, particularly for lower-risk accounts.

==Considerations in testing and evidence decisions==
[[Image:SEC Risk Diagram - SOX TDRA v1.png|thumb|SEC risk diagram plus additional captions]]
The key SEC principle regarding evidence decisions can be summarized as follows: "Align the nature, timing and extent of evaluation procedures on those areas that pose the greatest risks to reliable financial reporting." The SEC has indicated that the sufficiency of evidence required to support the assessment of specific MMR should be based on two factors: a) Financial Element Misstatement Risk ("Misstatement Risk") and b) Control Failure Risk.  These two concepts together (the account- or disclosure-related risks and control-related risks) are called "Internal Control over Financial Reporting Risk" or "ICFR" risk.  A diagram was included in the guidance (shown in this section) to illustrate this concept; it is the only such diagram, which indicates the emphasis placed on it by the SEC.  ICFR risk should be associated with the in-scope controls identified above and may be part of that analysis.  This involves the following steps:

===Link each key control to the "Misstatement Risk" of the related account or disclosure===
Management assigned a misstatement risk ranking (high, medium or low) for each significant account and disclosure as part of the scoping assessment above.  The low, medium, or high ranking assessed should also be associated with the risk statements and control statements related to the account. One way of accomplishing this is to include the ranking within the risk statement and control statement documentation of the company.  Many companies use databases for this purpose, creating data fields within their risk and control documentation to capture this information.

===Rate each key control for "control failure risk (CFR)" and "ICFR risk"===
CFR is applied at the individual control level, based on factors in the guidance related to complexity of processing, manual vs. automated nature of the control, judgment involved, etc.  Management fundamentally asks the question: "How difficult is it to execute this control properly each and every time?"

With account misstatement risk and CFR defined, management can then conclude on ICFR risk (low, medium, or high) for the control.  ICFR is the key risk concept used in evidence decisions.

The ICFR rating is captured for each control statement. Larger companies typically have hundreds of significant accounts, risk statements, and control statements. These have a "many to many" relationship, meaning risks can apply to multiple accounts and controls can apply to multiple risks.

===Consider the impact of risk on the timing, nature, and extent of testing===
The guidance provides flexibility in the timing, nature and extent of evidence based on the interaction of Misstatement Risk and Control Failure Risk (together, ICFR Risk). These two factors should be used to update the "Sampling and Evidence Guide" used by most companies. As these two risk factors increase, the sufficiency of evidence required to address each MMR increases.

Management has significant flexibility regarding the following testing and evidence considerations, in the context of the ICFR risk related to a given control:

[[Image:Evidence Sufficiency Diagram.png|thumb|Impact of ICFR risk on timing, nature and extent of testing]]

*Extent (sample size):  The sample size increases proportionally to ICFR risk.
*Nature of evidence:  Inquiry, observation, inspection and re-performance are the four evidence types, listed in order of sufficiency.  Evidence beyond inquiry, typically inspection of documents, is required for tests of control operating effectiveness.  Re-performance evidence would be expected for the highest risk controls, such as in the period-end reporting process.
*Nature of the control (manual vs. automated):  For fully automated controls, either a sample size of one or a "benchmarking" [[test strategy]] may be used.  If IT general controls related to change management are effective and the fully automated control has been tested in the past, annual testing is not required.  The benchmark must be periodically established.
*Scope of roll-forward testing required:  As risk increases, roll-forward testing is increasingly likely to be necessary to extend the effect of interim testing to year-end.  Lower-risk controls presumably do not require roll-forward testing.

Pervasive factors that also affect the evidence considerations above include:

*Overall strength of entity-level controls, particularly the control environment:  Strong entity-level controls act as a pervasive "counter-weight" to risk across the board, reducing the sufficiency of evidence required in lower-risk areas and supporting the spirit of the new guidance in terms of reducing overall effort.
*Cumulative knowledge from prior assessments regarding particular controls: If particular processes and controls have a history of working effectively, the extent of evidence required in lower-risk areas can be reduced.

===Consider risk, objectivity, and competence in testing decisions===
Management has significant discretion in who performs its testing.  The SEC guidance indicates that the objectivity of the person testing a given control should increase proportionally to the ICFR risk related to that control.  Therefore, techniques such as self-assessment are appropriate for lower-risk areas, while [[internal auditing|internal auditors]] (or the equivalent) generally should test higher-risk areas.  An intermediate technique in practice is "quality assurance," where manager A tests manager B's work, and vice versa.

The external auditors ability to rely on management's testing follows similar logic.  Reliance is proportional to the competence and objectivity of the management person that completed the testing, also in the context of risk.  For the highest risk areas, such as the control environment and period-end reporting process, internal auditors or compliance teams are likely the best choices to perform testing, if a significant degree of reliance is expected from the external auditor.  The ability of the external auditor to rely on management's assessment is a major cost factor in compliance.

==Strategies for efficient SOX 404 assessment==

There are a variety of specific opportunities to make the SOX 404 assessment as efficient as possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-UnitedStates/Local%20Assets/Documents/us_Sarbanes_ControlRationalization%20e-version%281%29.pdf Deloitte-Touche Lean and Balanced]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eycom.ch/publications/items/2007_404_balancing_act/2007_ey_404_balancing_act.pdf E&amp;Y Paper "The New 404 Balancing Act"]&lt;/ref&gt; Some are more long-term in nature (such as centralization and automation of processing) while others can be readily implemented. Frequent interaction between management and the external auditor is essential to determining which efficiency strategies will be effective in each company's particular circumstances and the extent to which control scope reduction is appropriate.

===Centralization and automation===

Centralize: Using a shared service model in key risk areas enables multiple locations to be treated as one for testing purposes.  Shared service models are typically used for payroll and accounts payable processes, but can be applied to many types of transaction processing.  According to a recent survey by Finance Executives International, decentralized companies had dramatically higher SOX compliance costs than centralized companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fei.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=press_releases&amp;item=187 FEI Survey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011142102/http://fei.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=press_releases&amp;item=187 |date=2007-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Automate and benchmark: Key fully automated IT application controls have minimal sample size requirements (usually one, as opposed to as many as 30 for manual controls) and may not have to be tested directly at all under the benchmarking concept.  Benchmarking (see Appendix B of the PCAOB guidance) allows fully automated IT application controls to be excluded from testing if certain IT change management controls are effective.  For example, many companies rely heavily on manual interfaces between systems, with spreadsheets created for downloading and uploading manual journal entries.  Some companies process thousands of such entries each month.  By automating manual journal entries, both labor and SOX assessment costs may be dramatically reduced.  In addition, the reliability of financial statements is improved.

===Overall assessment approach===

Review testing approach and documentation: Many companies or external audit firms mistakenly attempted to impose generic frameworks over unique transaction-level processes or across locations.  For instance, most of the COSO Framework elements represent indirect entity-level controls, which should be tested separately from transactional processes.  In addition, IT security controls (a subset of ITGC) and shared service controls can be placed in separate process documentation, enabling more efficient assignment of test responsibility and removing redundancy across locations.  Testing the key journal entries and account reconciliations as separate efforts enables additional efficiency and focus to be brought to these critical controls.

Rely on direct entity-level controls: The guidance emphasizes identifying which direct entity-level controls, particularly the period-end process and certain monitoring controls, are sufficiently precise to remove assertion-level (transactional) controls from scope.  The key is to determine which combination of entity-level and assertion-level controls address particular MMR.

Minimize roll-forward testing:  Management has more flexibility under the new guidance to extend the effective date of testing performed during mid-year ("interim") periods to the year-end date.  Only the higher risk controls will likely require roll-forward testing under the new guidance.  PCAOB AS5 indicates that inquiry procedures, regarding whether changes in the control process occurred between the interim and year-end period, may be sufficient in many cases to limit roll-forward testing.

Revisit scope of locations or business units assessed:  This is a complex area requiring substantial judgment and analysis.  The 2007 guidance focused on specific MMR, rather than dollar magnitude in determining the scope and sufficiency of evidence to be obtained at decentralized units.  The interpretation (common under the pre-2007 guidance) that a unit or group of units was material and therefore a large number of controls across multiple processes require testing irrespective of risk, has been superseded.  Where account balances from single units or groups of similar units are a material portion of the consolidated account balance, management should carefully consider whether MMR may exist in a particular unit. Testing focused on just the controls related to the MMR should then be performed. Monitoring controls, such as detailed performance review meetings with robust reporting packages, should also be considered to limit transaction-specific testing.

===IT assessment approach===

Focus IT general control (ITGC) testing:  ITGC are ''not'' included in the definition of entity-level controls under the SEC or PCAOB guidance.  Therefore, ITGC testing should be performed to the extent it addresses specific MMR.  By nature, ITGC enables management to place reliance on fully automated application controls (i.e., those that operate without human intervention) and IT-dependent controls (i.e., those that involve the review of automatically generated reports).  Focused ITGC testing is merited to support the control objectives or assertions that fully automated controls have not been changed without authorization and that control reporting generated is both accurate and complete.  Key ITGC focus areas therefore likely to be critical include: change management procedures applied to specific financial system implementations during the period; change management procedures sufficient to support a benchmarking strategy; and periodic monitoring of application security, including separation of duties.

==PCAOB guidance subsequent to 2007==
The PCAOB issues "Staff Audit Practice Alerts" (SAPA) periodically that "highlight new, emerging or otherwise noteworthy circumstances that may affect how auditors conduct audits under the existing requirements of the standards..."  Under SAPA #11 ''Considerations for Audits of Internal Control over Financial Reporting'' (October 24, 2013), the PCAOB discussed significant audit practice issues regarding ICFR assessment. These included, among other topics:
*System-generated reports ("Information provided by the entity" or "IPE"): Requirements that auditors (and by proxy management) obtain additional evidence that fully automated reports and manual queries used as control inputs are accurate and complete.
*Entity-level controls and management review controls: Excessive reliance was sometimes placed on entity-level controls and management review controls (similar conceptually to period-end controls), which were insufficiently precise to reduce the risk of material misstatement to the "remote" level. SAPA #11 provides additional criteria to assist in this evaluation of precision.
*Criteria for investigation: Auditors did not always obtain sufficient evidence that management's controls were executed effectively where unusual variation outside of specified tolerances was noted. For example, management may have signed a control report saying it was reviewed but provided no other documentation of investigation, despite some unusual activity on the report. SAPA #11 states: "Verifying that a review was signed-off provides little or no evidence by itself about the control's effectiveness."&lt;ref&gt;[http://pcaobus.org/Standards/QandA/10-24-2013_SAPA_11.pdf PCAOB Staff Audit Practice Alert #11-October 24, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

SAPA #11 may translate into more work for management teams, which may be required by auditors to retain evidence that these reports and queries were accurate and complete. Further, management may be required to retain additional evidence of investigation where detective control report amounts contain transactions or trends outside of predefined tolerance ranges.

'''Sheet moulding compound''' ('''SMC''') or '''sheet moulding composite''' is a ready to mould [[Fiberglass|glass-fibre reinforced polyester]] material primarily used in [[compression moulding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Whelan |first=A. |year=2012 |title=Polymer Technology Dictionary |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |page=391 |isbn=9789401112925}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sheet is provided in rolls weighing up to 1000&amp;nbsp;kg. Alternatively the resin and related materials may be mixed on site when a producer wants greater control over the chemistry and filler.

SMC is both a process and reinforced composite material.  This is manufactured by dispersing long strands (usually &gt;1”) of chopped fiber (commonly [[glass fiber]]s or [[carbon fiber]]s on a bath of [[thermosetting polymer|thermoset]] resin (commonly [[polyester resin]], [[vinyl ester resin]] or [[epoxy resin]])). The longer fibers in SMC result in better strength properties than standard [[bulk moulding compound]] (BMC) products. Typical applications include demanding electrical applications, corrosion resistant needs, structural components at low cost, automotive, and transit. 

==Process==
Paste reservoir dispenses a measured amount of specified resin paste onto a plastic carrier film.  This carrier film passes underneath a chopper which cuts the fibers onto the surface. Once these have drifted through the depth of resin paste, another sheet is added on top which sandwiches the glass.  The sheets are compacted and then enter onto a take-up roll, which is used to store the product whilst it matures.  The carrier film is then later removed and the material is cut into charges.  Depending on what shape is required determines the shape of the charge and steel die which it is then added to.  Heat and pressure act on the charge and once fully cured, this is then removed from the mould as the finished product. Fillers both reduce weight and change the physical properties, typically adding strength. Production challenges include wetting the filler, which could consist of glass microspheres or aligned fibers rather than random chopped fibers; adjusting die temperature and pressure to provide the proper geometry; and adjusting chemistry to end use.

==Advantages==
Compared to similar methods, SMC benefits from a very high volume production ability, excellent part reproducibility, it is cost effective as low labor requirements per production level is very good and industry scrap is reduced substantially.  Weight reduction, due to lower dimensional requirements and because of the ability to consolidate many parts into one, is also advantageous.  The level of flexibility also exceeds many counterpart processes.

==Physical properties==
Properties vary depending upon fiber and resin types.
* Impact Strength: 8–13&amp;nbsp;ft·lbf/in
* Flex Strength: 18-34 KPSI (120-230 MPa)
* Flex Mod: 1500-2100 KPSI (10-15 GPa)
* Tensile Strength: 8-18 KPSI (55-125 MPa)
* Compressive Strength: 24-32 KPSI (165-220 MPa)
* HDT @ 264 PSI: &gt;500°F
* CURING Temperature: 80°c-150°c

'''''The Industry Standard''''' is a U.S. news web site dedicated to technology business news, part of [[InfoWorld]], a news website covering technology in general. It is a revival of a weekly [[magazine]] based in [[San Francisco]] which was published between 1998 and 2001.

==Print magazine, 1998-2001==
''The Industry Standard'' called itself "the newsmagazine of the Internet economy", and it specialized in areas where business and the Internet overlapped. Like ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', ''[[Red Herring (magazine)|Red Herring]]'', and (later) ''[[Business 2.0]]'', it was part of a breed of late 1990s publications that filled a gap in technology coverage left by mainstream media at the time.

The magazine, which was owned by the technology publishing company [[International Data Group|IDG]], was in many ways the brainchild of [[John Battelle]], who had been a journalist at ''Wired'' both in the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Jonathan Weber was its editor-in-chief. The magazine also ran a web site, thestandard.com.

Beginning in 1999, ''The Standard'' began selling a large number of advertising pages in the magazine, and began to be referred to as "the bible" of the Internet economy. In 2000, it sold more ad pages than any magazine in America, and launched that year a European edition. However, as the [[dot-com boom]] failed, sales of the magazine began to shrink, and it went into bankruptcy in August 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wolverton|first=Troy|url=http://news.com/2100-1023-271755.html|title=The Industry Standard to stop publishing|work=CNET News.com|date=August 17, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of The Standard's writer/editors, [[James Ledbetter]], published a book in 2003 about the magazine's rise and fall; entitled ''Starving to Death on $200 Million: The Short, Absurd Life of The Industry Standard''.

==Website, 2008-present==
IDG relaunched ''The Industry Standard'' as an online-only publication in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stone|first=Brad|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/02/bubblewatch-the-industry-standard-is-coming-back/|title=Bubblewatch: The Industry Standard Is Coming Back|work=The New York Times|date=October 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site featured technology industry news and an interactive section where visitors could make predictions about the future of the tech industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fehd|first=Amanda|url=http://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_wires/2008Feb04/0,4675,IndustryStandard,00.html|title=Industry Standard Returns, Online Only|publisher=Associated Press (via foxnews.com)|date=February 4, 2008| accessdate=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, ''The Industry Standard'' became a "channel" within InfoWorld, another publication owned by IDG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Eric|last=Knorr|first2=Ian|last2=Lamont|url=http://www.infoworld.com/d/the-industry-standard/welcome-readers-the-industry-standard-170|title=Welcome, readers of the Industry Standard!|date=March 26, 2010|accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The [[German language|German]] term ''sozialstaat''&lt;!--German common nouns not normally capitalized in academic texts, and our manual of style says to avoid unnecessary capitalization--&gt; ("social state") has been used since 1870 to describe state support programs devised by German ''[[Historical school of economics|sozialpolitiker]]''  ("social politicians") and implemented as part of [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck's]] conservative reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first= S. B. |last= Fay| title= Bismarck's Welfare State| work= Current History| volume= XVIII |date= January 1950| pages= 1–7| url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, the term ''wohlfahrtsstaat'', a direct translation of the English "welfare state", is used to describe Sweden's [[social insurance]] arrangements.

The literal English equivalent "social state" did not catch on in Anglophone countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Munroe |date=December 1901 |title=Four German Jurists.

Members of Young England attempted to garner support among the privileged classes to assist the less fortunate and to recognize the [[dignity of labor]] that they imagined had characterized England during the Feudal Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Alexander| title= Medievalism| pages= xxiv–xxv, 62, 93, and passim| year= | publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Social welfare in Sweden|Swedish welfare state]] is called ''[[folkhemmet]]'' ("the people's home") and goes back to the 1936 compromise, as well as another important contract made in 1938, between Swedish trade unions and large corporations. Even though the country is often rated comparably economically free, Sweden's [[mixed economy]] remains heavily influenced by the legal framework and continual renegotiations of union contracts, a government-directed and municipality-administered system of [[social security]], and a system of [[universal health care]] that is run by the more specialized and in theory more politically isolated [[county councils of Sweden]].

The [[Italian language|Italian]] term ''stato sociale'' ("social state") and the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] term ''sosyal devlet'' reproduces the original German term. In French, the concept is expressed as ''l'État-providence''. Spanish and many other languages employ an analogous term: ''estado del bienestar'' – literally, "state of well-being". In Portuguese, two similar phrases exist: ''estado de bem-estar social'', which means "state of social well-being", and ''estado de providência'' – "providing state", denoting the state's mission to ensure the basic well-being of the citizenry. In Brazil, the concept is referred to as ''previdência social'', or "social providence".

==Modern forms==
Modern [[welfare program]]s are chiefly distinguished from earlier forms of [[poverty relief]] by their universal, comprehensive character. The institution of [[social insurance]] in Germany under Bismarck was an influential example. Some schemes were based largely in the development of autonomous, mutualist provision of benefits. Others were founded on state provision. In a highly influential essay, "Citizenship and Social Class" (1949), British sociologist [[Thomas Humphrey Marshall|T. H. Marshall]] identified modern welfare states as a distinctive combination of [[democracy]], [[social welfare|welfare]], and [[capitalism]], arguing that citizenship must encompass access to social, as well as to political and civil rights. Examples of such states are Germany, all of the [[Nordic countries]], the Netherlands, France, Uruguay and New Zealand and the United Kingdom in the 1930s. Since that time, the term welfare state applies only to states where social rights are accompanied by civil and political rights.

Changed attitudes in reaction to the worldwide [[Great Depression]], which brought unemployment and misery to millions,  were instrumental in the move to the welfare state in many countries. During the Great Depression, the welfare state was seen as a "middle way" between the extremes of [[communism]] on the left and unregulated ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]] on the right.&lt;ref name= "WF EPE" /&gt; In the period following World War II, countries in Western Europe moved from partial or selective provision of [[social service]]s to relatively comprehensive "cradle-to-grave" coverage of the population.

The activities of present-day welfare states extend to the provision of both cash welfare benefits (such as old-age pensions or unemployment benefits) and in-kind welfare services (such as health or childcare services). Through these provisions, welfare states can affect the distribution of wellbeing and personal autonomy among their citizens, as well as influencing how their citizens consume and how they spend their time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Esping-Andersen |first=Gøsta |title=Social Foundations of Postindustrial Economies |year=1999 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0198742002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rice |first=James Mahmud |author2=Robert E.

==History of welfare states==
Emperor [[Ashoka]] of India put forward his idea of a welfare state in the 3rd century BCE. He envisioned his ''[[dharma]]'' (religion or path) as not just a collection of high-sounding phrases. He consciously tried to adopt it as a matter of state policy; he declared that "all men and my children" and "whatever exertion I make, I strive only to discharge debt that I owe to all living creatures." It was a totally new ideal of kingship.&lt;ref name="google592"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Penguin History of Early India: From the Origins to AD 1300|year=2003|publisher=Penguin UK|isbn=9780141937427|page=592|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HqmyEbLScZ4C&amp;pg|author=Romila Thapar|accessdate=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashoka renounced war and conquest by violence and forbade the killing of many animals.&lt;ref name= "google1989"&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in Indian History Issue 35 of Chaukhambha oriental research studies|year= 1989| publisher= Chaukhamba Orientalia original from: the University of Virginia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_XlDAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq| first= Upendra |last= Thakur|accessdate=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since he wanted to conquer the world through love and faith, he sent many missions to propagate Dharma.

The concepts of welfare and [[pension]] were introduced in early [[Sharia|Islamic law]] as forms of ''[[Zakat]]'' (charity), one of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], under the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] in the 7th century. This practice continued well into the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] era of the [[Caliphate]]. The taxes (including ''Zakat'' and ''[[Jizya]]'') collected in the [[treasury]] of an Islamic government were used to provide income for the [[Poverty|needy]], including the poor, elderly, orphans, widows, and the disabled. According to the Islamic jurist [[Al-Ghazali]] (Algazel, 1058–1111), the government was also expected to stockpile food supplies in every region in case a disaster or famine occurred. The Caliphate can thus be considered the world's first major welfare state.&lt;ref name="Crone 2005 308–9"&gt;{{citation|title=Medieval Islamic Political Thought|first=Patricia|last=Crone|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|year=2005|isbn=0748621946|pages=308–09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hamid&gt;{{citation|title=An Islamic Alternative?

Historian [[Robert Paxton]] observes that on the European continent the provisions of the welfare state were originally enacted by conservatives in the late nineteenth century and by fascists in the twentieth in order to distract workers from unions and socialism, and were opposed by leftists and radicals. He recalls that the German welfare state was set up in the 1880s by [[Otto von Bismarck|Chancellor Bismarck]], who had just closed 45 newspapers and passed [[Anti-Socialist Laws|laws banning the German Socialist Party and other meetings by trade unionists and socialists]].{{efn|These laws had no effect and were allowed to lapse in 1890.}} A similar version was set up by Count [[Eduard von Taaffe]] in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] a few years later. Legislation to help the working class in Austria emerged from Catholic conservatives. They turned to social reform by using Swiss and German models and intervening in state economic matters. They studied  the Swiss Factory Act of 1877 that limited working hours for everyone, and gave maternity benefits, and German laws that insured workers against industrial risks inherent in the workplace. These served as the basis for Austria's 1885 Trade Code Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first= Margarete |last= Grandner| title= Conservative Social Politics in Austria, 1880–1890| work= Austrian History Yearbook| volume= 27 |year= 1996| pages= 77–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"All the modern twentieth-century European dictatorships of the right, both fascist and authoritarian, were welfare states", Paxton writes. "They all provided medical care, pensions, affordable housing, and mass transport as a matter of course, in order to maintain productivity, national unity, and social peace."&lt;ref name= "Paxton way"&gt;{{cite news| first= Robert O. |last= Paxton| title= Vichy Lives! – In a way| url= http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/apr/25/vichy-lives-in-a-way/ | work= The New York Review of Books| date= 25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Continental European Marxists opposed piecemeal welfare measures as likely to dilute worker militancy without changing anything fundamental about the distribution of wealth and power. It was only after World War II, when they abandoned Marxism (in 1959 in West Germany, for example), that continental European socialist parties and unions fully accepted the welfare state as their ultimate goal.&lt;ref name= "Paxton way" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Great Britain===
In Britain, the foundations for the welfare state originated with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] under prime minister [[H. H. Asquith]] and Chancellor of the Exchequer [[David Lloyd George]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first= Arthur |last= Marwick| title= The Labour Party and the Welfare State in Britain, 1900-1948| work= American Historical Review| publisher= | volume= 73| number= 2 |year= 1967| pages= 380-403 | url= https://www.jstor.org/stable/1866166 | via= JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; British liberals supported a capitalist economy and in the nineteenth-century  had principally been concerned with issues of free trade (see [[classical liberalism]]), but by the turn of the twentieth century they shifted away from ''[[laissez faire]]'' economics and began to favor [[Social liberalism|pro-active social legislation]] to assure equal opportunity for all citizens (and to counteract the appeal of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]). In this they were directly inspired by the signal success of the German economy under Bismarck's top-down social reforms. 

===France===
The French welfare state originated in the 1930s during a period of socialist political ascendency, with the [[Matignon Accords (1936)|Matignon Accords]] and the reforms of the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]]/&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Paul V. |last= Dutton| title= Origins of the French welfare state: The struggle for social reform in France, 1914–1947| publisher= Cambridge University Press| year= 2002| url= http://www.newbooks-services.de/MediaFiles/Texts/3/9780521673563_Intro_001.pdf | via= newbooks-services.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paxton points out these reforms were paralleled and even exceeded by measures taken by the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] in the 1940s.

Prior to 1900 in Australia, charitable assistance from benevolent societies, sometimes with financial contributions from the authorities, was the primary means of relief for people not able to support themselves.&lt;ref name = abs-1988/&gt; The 1890s economic depression and the rise of the trade unions and the [[Australian Labor Party#History|Labor parties]] during this period led to a movement for welfare reform.&lt;ref name = dict-syd-2008&gt;{{cite web|year= 2008|first= Stephen|last= Garton|title=  Health and welfare|work= The Dictionary of Sydney|accessdate= 23 December 2014|url= http://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/health_and_welfare|deadurl= no| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120815071913/http://www.dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/health_and_welfare|archivedate= 15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, the states of New South Wales and Victoria enacted legislation introducing non-contributory pensions for those aged 65 and over. Queensland legislated a similar system in 1907 before the federal  labor government led by [[Andrew Fisher]] introduced a national aged pension under the Invalid and Old-Aged Pensions Act 1908. A national invalid disability pension was started in 1910, and a national maternity allowance was introduced in 1912.&lt;ref name = abs-1988&gt;{{cite web|year= 1988|title= History of Pensions and Other Benefits in Australia| work= Year Book Australia, 1988  |publisher= Australian Bureau of Statistics|accessdate= 23 December 2014|url= http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/3d68c56307742d8fca257090002029cd/8e72c4526a94aaedca2569de00296978!OpenDocument|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141223142853/http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/3d68c56307742d8fca257090002029cd/8e72c4526a94aaedca2569de00296978!OpenDocument|archivedate= 23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = australia-wr-2000/&gt;

===Germany===
{{main|Welfare in Germany}}
[[Otto von Bismarck]], the first [[Chancellor of Germany]] (in office 1871–90), developed the modern welfare state by building on a tradition of welfare programs in [[Prussia]] and [[Saxony]] that had begun as early as in the 1840s. The measures that Bismarck introduced – old-age [[pension]]s, [[Accidental death and dismemberment insurance|accident insurance]], and employee health insurance – formed the basis of the modern European welfare state. His [[Paternalism|paternalistic]] programs aimed to forestall social unrest (specifically to prevent an uprising like that of the [[Paris Commune]] in 1871), to undercut the appeal of the [[History of the Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]], and to secure the support of the [[working class]]es for the [[German Empire]], as well as to reduce emigration to the [[United States]], where wages were higher but welfare did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;E.

According to Alex Segura-Ubiergo: &lt;blockquote&gt;Latin American countries can be unequivocally divided into two groups depending on their 'welfare effort' levels. The first group, which for convenience we may call welfare states, includes Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, and Brazil. Within this group, average social spending per capita in the 1973–2000 period was around $532, while as a percentage of GDP and as a share of the budget, social spending reached 51.6 and 12.6 percent, respectively. In addition, between approximately 50 and 75 percent of the population is covered by the public health and pension social security system. In contrast, the second group of countries, which we call non-welfare states, has welfare-effort indices that range from 37 to 88. Within this second group, social spending per capita averaged $96.6, while social spending as a percentage of GDP and as a percentage of the budget averaged 5.2 and 34.7 percent, respectively. In terms of the percentage of the population actually covered, the percentage of the active population covered under some social security scheme does not even reach 10 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Segura-Ubiergo, Alex (2007).

Historian Derek Fraser tells the British story in a nutshell:
:It germinated in the social thought of late Victorian liberalism, reached its infancy in the collectivism of the pre-and post-Great War statism, matured in the universalism of the 1940s and flowered in full bloom in the consensus and affluence of the 1950s and 1960s. By the 1970s it was in decline, like the faded rose of autumn. Both UK and US governments are pursuing in the 1980s monetarist policies [[wikt:inimical#Adjective|inimical]] to welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Derek |last= Fraser| title= The evolution of the British welfare state: a history of social policy since the Industrial Revolution| edition= 2nd | year= 1984| page= 233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern welfare state in Great Britain began operations with the [[Liberal welfare reforms|Liberal welfare reforms of 1906–1914]] under [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Francis G.

The [[History of the minimum wage#Great Britain|minimum wage was introduced in Great Britain in 1909]] for certain low-wage industries and expanded to numerous industries, including farm labour, by 1920. However, by the 1920s, a new perspective was offered by reformers to emphasize the usefulness of [[family allowance]] targeted at low-income families was the alternative to relieving poverty without distorting the labour market.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Lewis, "The English Movement for Family Allowances, 1917–1945." ''Histoire sociale/Social History'' 11.22 (1978) pp. 441–59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Macnicol, ''Movement for Family Allowances, 1918–45: A Study in Social Policy Development'' (1980).&lt;/ref&gt; The trade unions and the Labour Party adopted this view. In 1945, family allowances were introduced; minimum wages faded from view. Talk resumed in the 1970s, but in the 1980s the Thatcher administration made it clear it would not accept a national minimum wage. Finally, with the return of Labour, the  [[National Minimum Wage Act 1998]] set a minimum of ₤3.60 per hour, with lower rates for younger workers. It largely affected workers in high turnover service industries such as fast food restaurants, and members of ethnic minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Pat Thane, ''Cassell's Companion to Twentieth Century Britain'' (2002) pp. 267–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

December 1942 saw the publication of the ''Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Social Insurance and Allied Services'', commonly known as the [[Beveridge Report]] after its chairman, Sir [[William Beveridge]]. The Beveridge Report proposed a series of measures to aid those who were in need of help, or in poverty and recommended that the government find ways of tackling what the report called "the five giants": Want, Disease, Ignorance, Squalor, and Idleness. It urged the government to take steps to provide citizens with adequate income, adequate health care, adequate education, adequate housing, and adequate employment, proposing that "All people of working age should pay a weekly [[National Insurance]] contribution. In return, benefits would be paid to people who were sick, unemployed, retired, or widowed."

The Beveridge Report assumed that:
* the [[National Health Service]] would provide free health care to all citizens
* a Universal Child Benefit would give benefits to parents, encouraging people to have children by enabling them to feed and support a family

The report stressed the lower costs and efficiency of universal benefits. Beveridge cited miners' pension schemes as examples of some of the most efficient available and argued that a universal state scheme would be cheaper than a myriad of individual friendly societies and private insurance schemes and also less expensive to administer than a means-tested government-run welfare system for the poor.

The [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], and then the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] all adopted the Beveridge Report's recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;Beveridge, ''Power and Influence''&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Labour election victory in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]] many of Beveridge's reforms were implemented through a series of Acts of Parliament. On 5 July 1948, the [[National Insurance Act 1946|National Insurance Act]], [[National Assistance Act 1948|National Assistance Act]] and [[National Health Service Act 1946|National Health Service Act]] came into force, forming the key planks of the modern UK welfare state. In 1949, the [[Legal Aid and Advice Act]] was passed, providing the "fourth pillar"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.lawgazette.co.uk/analysis/comment-and-opinion/praise-legal-aid-dont-bury-it/5042498.fullarticle | title=Praise legal aid; don’t bury it | first=Catherine | last=Baksi | date=1 August 2014 | work=The Law Society Gazette | accessdate=10 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the modern welfare state, access to advice for legal redress for all.

Before 1939, most health care had to be paid for through non-government organisations – through a vast network of friendly societies, trade unions, and other insurance companies, which counted the vast majority of the UK working population as members. These organizations provided insurance for sickness, unemployment, and disability, providing an income to people when they were unable to work. As part of the reforms, the [[Church of England]] also closed down its voluntary relief networks and passed the ownership of thousands of church schools, hospitals and other bodies to the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/21541399 "Bagehot: God in austerity Britain"] ''[[The Economist]]'', published 2011-12-10&lt;/ref&gt;

Welfare systems continued to develop over the following decades. By the end of the 20th century parts of the welfare system had been restructured, with some provision channelled through [[non-governmental organization]]s which became important providers of social services.&lt;ref name="globall"&gt;Pawel Zaleski ''Global Non-governmental Administrative System: Geosociology of the Third Sector'', [in:] Gawin, Dariusz &amp; Glinski, Piotr [ed.]: "Civil Society in the Making", IFiS Publishers, Warszawa 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

The United States developed a limited welfare state in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Walter I. Trattner 2007 15"&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter I. Trattner|title=From Poor Law to Welfare State, 6th Edition: A History of Social Welfare in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r0PZdo5fXfgC&amp;pg=PR15|year=2007|publisher=Free Press|page=15|isbn=9781416593188}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest and most comprehensive philosophical justification for the welfare state was produced by an American, the sociologist [[Lester Frank Ward]] (1841–1913), whom the historian [[Henry Steele Commager]] called "the father of the modern welfare state".

Ward saw social phenomena as amenable to human control. "It is only through the artificial control of natural phenomena that science is made to minister to human needs" he wrote, "and if social laws are really analogous to physical laws, there is no reason why social science should not receive practical application such as have been given to physical science."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Thomas F. Gosset, ''Race: The History of an Idea in America'' (Oxford University Press, 1997 [1963]), p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; Ward wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The charge of paternalism is chiefly made by the class that enjoys the largest share of government protection. Those who denounce it are those who most frequently and successfully invoke it. Nothing is more obvious today than the single inability of capital and private enterprise to take care of themselves unaided by the state; and while they are incessantly denouncing "paternalism," by which they mean the claim of the defenseless laborer and artisan to a share in this lavish state protection, they are all the while besieging legislatures for relief from their own incompetency, and "pleading the baby act" through a trained body of lawyers and lobbyists. The dispensing of national pap to this class should rather be called "maternalism," to which a square, open, and dignified paternalism would be infinitely preferable.
&lt;ref&gt;Lester Frank Ward, ''Forum'' XX, 1895, quoted in Henry Steel Commager's ''The American Mind: An Interpretation of American Thought and Character Since the 1880s'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1950), p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ward's theories centred around his belief that a universal and [[Comprehensive school|comprehensive]] system of education was necessary if a democratic government was to function successfully. His writings profoundly influenced younger generations of [[progressivism|progressive]] thinkers such as [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Thomas Dewey]], and [[Frances Perkins]] (1880–1965), among others.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Steele Commager, Editor, ''Lester Ward and the Welfare State'' (New York: Bobbs-Merrill, 1967).&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States was the only industrialized country that went into the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s with no social insurance policies in place. In 1935 [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] instituted significant social insurance policies. In 1938 Congress passed the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]], limiting the work week to 40 hours and banning child labor for children under 16, over stiff congressional opposition from the low-wage South.&lt;ref name="Walter I. Trattner 2007 15"/&gt;

The [[History of Social Security in the United States|Social Security law]] was very unpopular among many groups – especially farmers, who resented the additional taxes and feared they would never be made good. They lobbied hard for exclusion. Furthermore, the Treasury realized how difficult it would be to set up payroll deduction plans for farmers, for housekeepers who employed maids, and for non-profit groups; therefore they were excluded. State employees were excluded for constitutional reasons (the federal government in the United States cannot tax state governments). Federal employees were also excluded. 

By 2013 the U.S. remained the only major industrial state without a uniform national sickness program. American spending on health care (as percent of GDP) is the highest in the world, but it is a complex mix of federal, state, philanthropic, employer and individual funding. The US spent 16% of its GDP on health care in 2008, compared to 11% in France in second place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Soeren Mattke|title= Health and Well-Being in the Home: A Global Analysis of Needs, Expectations, and Priorities for Home Health Care Technology|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bmKInEI1PzQC&amp;pg=PT33|year=2011|publisher= Rand Corporation|pages=33–|display-authors=etal|isbn= 9780833052797}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars, such as Gerard Friedman, argue that [[Labor unions in the United States|labor-union]] weakness in the [[Southern United States]] undermined unionization and social reform throughout the United States as a whole, and is largely responsible for the anaemic U.S. welfare state.&lt;ref&gt;

==Three worlds of the welfare state==

Broadly speaking, welfare states are either universal – with provisions that cover everybody, or selective – with provisions covering only those deemed most needy. In his 1990 book, ''The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism'', Danish sociologist [[Gøsta Esping-Andersen]] further identified three subtypes of welfare state models.&lt;ref&gt;Bo Rothstein, ''Just Institutions Matter: The Moral and Political Logic of the Universal Welfare State'' (Cambridge, 1998), pp. 18–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Though increasingly criticised, these classifications are still used as a starting point in analysis of modern welfare states{{efn|For a review of the debate on the ''Three worlds of Welfare Capitalism'', see Art and Gelissen (2002) and Ferragina and Seeleib-Kaiser (2011).}} and remain a fundamental heuristic tool for welfare state scholars. Even for those who claim that in-depth analysis of a single case is more suited to capture the complexity of different social policy arrangements, welfare typologies can provide a comparative lens that can help to place single cases in perspective.&lt;ref name= "FS regime"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Welfare regime debate: past, present, futures|year=2011| publisher= | work= Policy &amp; Politics| volume= 39| number= 4 | first1= Emanuele |last1= Ferragina | first2= Martin |last2= Seeleib-Kaiser}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|598}}

Esping-Andersen's welfare classification acknowledges the historical role of three dominant twentieth-century Western European and American political movements: [[Social Democracy]] (socialism), [[Christian Democracy]] (conservatism); and [[Social liberalism|Liberalism]].&lt;ref name= "FS regime" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens (1979); Korpi (1983); Van Kersbergen (1995); Vrooman (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;
# The Social-Democratic welfare state model is based on the principle of [[Universalism]], granting access to benefits and services based on citizenship. Such a welfare state is said to provide a relatively high degree of citizen autonomy, limiting reliance on family and market.&lt;ref name= "FS regime" /&gt;{{rp|584}} In this context, social policies are perceived as "politics against the market".&lt;ref&gt;Esping-Andersen (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;
# The Christian-Democratic welfare state model is based on the principle of [[subsidiarity]] (decentralization) and the dominance of social insurance schemes, offering a medium level of [[decommodification]] and permitting a high degree of social stratification.
# The Liberal model is based on market dominance and private provision; ideally, in this model, the state only interferes to ameliorate poverty and provide for basic needs, largely on a means-tested basis. Hence, the decommodification potential of state benefits is assumed to be low and social stratification high.&lt;ref name= "FS regime" /&gt;{{rp|584}}

Based on the decommodification index, [[Esping-Andersen]] divided 18 [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) countries into the following groups:&lt;ref&gt;Esping-Andersen (1990), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Social Democratic: Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden
# Christian Democratic: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and Spain
# Liberal: Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland and US
# Not clearly classified: Ireland and United Kingdom

Since the building of the decommodification index is limited&lt;ref&gt;According to the French sociologist [[Georges Menahem]], Esping-Andersen's "decommodification index" aggregates both qualitative and quantitative variables for "sets of dimensions" which fluid, and pertain to three very different areas. These characters involve similar limits of the validity of the index and of its potential for replication. Cf. [[Georges Menahem]], « [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-246X.2007.00281.x  The decommodified security ratio: A tool for assessing European social  protection systems] », in ''[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1468246x International Social Security Review]'', Volume 60, Issue 4, pp. 69–103, October–December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and the typology is debatable, these 18 countries could be ranked from most purely social-democratic (Sweden) to the most liberal (the United States).&lt;ref name= "FS regime" /&gt;{{rp|597}} Ireland represents a near-hybrid model whereby two streams of unemployment benefit exist: contributory and means-tested. However, payments can begin immediately and are theoretically available to all Irish citizens even if they have never worked, provided they are habitually resident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/10391238/Benefits-in-Europe-country-by-country.html |title= Benefits in Europe: country by country| first= Edward |last= Malnick| date= 19 October 2013| via= telegraph.co.uk| work= The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedish professor of political science [[Bo Rothstein]] points out that in non-universal welfare states, the state is primarily concerned with directing resources to "the people most in need". This requires tight bureaucratic control in order to determine who is eligible for assistance and who is not. Under universal models such as Sweden, on the other hand, the state distributes welfare to all people who fulfill easily established criteria (e.g. having children, receiving medical treatment, etc.) with as little bureaucratic interference as possible. This, however, requires higher taxation due to the scale of services provided. This model was constructed by the Scandinavian ministers [[Karl Kristian Steincke]] and [[Gustav Möller]] in the 1930s and is dominant in Scandinavia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bo Rothstein]], ''Just Institutions Matter: the Moral and Political Logic of the Universal Welfare State'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), pp. 18–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Lane Kenworthy]] argues that the Nordic experience demonstrates that the modern social democratic model can "promote economic security, expand opportunity, and ensure rising living standards for all ... while facilitating freedom, flexibility and market dynamism."&lt;ref&gt;[[Lane Kenworthy|Kenworthy, Lane]] (2014). ''Social Democratic America.'' [[Oxford University Press]]. {{ISBN|0199322511}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=eVTSAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 9].&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, scholars have also proposed to classify welfare regimes using 'outcomes', such as inequalities, poverty rates, response to different social risks, rather than simply focusing on institutional configurations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last= Ferragina| first= E. |last2= et al.| year= 2015| title= The Four Worlds of ‘Welfare Reality’ | work= Social Risks and Outcomes in Europe, Social Policy and Society| volume= 14 | number= 2| pages= 287–307| url= http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9571777&amp;fulltextType=RA&amp;fileId=S1474746414000530| publisher= | via= cambridge.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American political scientist [[Benjamin Radcliff]] has also argued that the universality and generosity of the welfare state (i.e. the extent of [[decommodification]]) is the single most important societal-level structural factor affecting the quality of human life, based on the analysis of time serial data across both the industrial democracies and the American States. He maintains that the welfare state improves life for everyone, regardless of social class (as do similar institutions, such as pro-worker labor market regulations and strong labor unions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| authorlink= Benjamin Radcliff| last= Radcliff| first= Benjamin| year= 2013| title= The Political Economy of Human Happiness| place= New York| publisher= Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|See also [http://benjaminradcliff.com/scholarly-articles/ "this collection of full-text peer reviewed scholarly articles on this subject"] by Radcliff and colleagues (such as "Social Forces," "The Journal of Politics," and "Perspectives on Politics," among others)}}

==Effects of social expenditure on economic growth, public debt and education==
{{See also| List of countries by social welfare spending}}
Researchers have found very little correlation between economic performance and social expenditure.&lt;ref name="atkinson1995"&gt;{{cite book |last=Atkinson |first=A. B. |title=Incomes and the Welfare State |year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0521557968 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also see little evidence that social expenditures contribute to losses in productivity; economist Peter Lindert of the [[University of California, Davis]] attributes this to policy innovations such as the implementation of "pro-growth" tax policies in real-world welfare states.&lt;ref name="lindert2004"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lindert |first=Peter |title=Growing Public:  Social Spending And Economic Growth Since The Eighteenth Century |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0521821754 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nor have social expenses contributed significantly to public debt.&lt;blockquote&gt;According to the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], social expenditures in its 34 member countries rose steadily between 1980 and 2007, but the increase in costs was almost completely offset by GDP growth. More money was spent on welfare because more money circulated in the economy and because government revenues increased. In 1980, the OECD averaged social expenditures equal to 16 percent of GDP.

==Criticism and response==
{{Main|Criticisms of welfare}}
Early conservatives, under the influence of [[Thomas Malthus]], opposed every form of social insurance "root and branch". They argued, according to economist [[Brad DeLong]], that it would "make the poor richer, and they would become more fertile. As a result, farm sizes would drop (as land was divided among ever more children), labor productivity would fall, and the poor would become even poorer. Social insurance was not just pointless; it was counterproductive."&lt;ref&gt;[http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2013/02/american-conservatisms-crisis-of-ideas-project-syndicate-monarchy-patriarchy-orthodoxy-weblogging.html#more  J. Bradford DeLong, "American Conservatism's Crisis of Ideas" (23 February 2013).]&lt;/ref&gt; Malthus, a clergyman for whom [[birth control]] was anathema, believed that the poor needed to learn the hard way to practice frugality, self-control and chastity. Traditional conservatives also protested that the effect of social insurance would be to weaken private charity and loosen traditional social bonds of family, friends, religious and non-governmental welfare organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url= https://mises.org/journals/jls/21_2/21_2_1.pdf |first= James Rolph |last= Edwards| title= The Costs of Public Income Redistribution and Private Charity| work= Journal of Libertarian Studies| publisher= Mises Institute| volume= 21| number= 2 | year= 2007| pages= 3–20| via= mises.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Marx]], on the other hand, opposed piecemeal reforms advanced by middle-class reformers out of a sense of duty. In his ''Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League'', written after the failed revolution of 1848, he warned that measures designed to increase wages, improve working conditions and provide social insurance were merely bribes that would temporarily make the situation of working classes tolerable to weaken the revolutionary consciousness that was needed to achieve a socialist economy.{{efn|"However, the democratic petty bourgeois want better wages and security for the workers, and hope to achieve this by an extension of state employment and by welfare measures; in short, they hope to bribe the workers with a more or less disguised form of alms and to break their revolutionary strength by temporarily rendering their situation tolerable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url= http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/communist-league/1850-ad1.htm |first= Karl |last= Marx| title= Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League| year= 1850| access-date= 5 January 2013 | via= Marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Nevertheless, Marx also proclaimed that the Communists had to support the bourgeoisie wherever it acted as a revolutionary progressive class because "bourgeois liberties had first to be conquered and then criticised".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url= http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bernstein/works/1897/04/marx-reform.htm#n21 | first= Eduard |last= Bernstein| title= Karl Marx and Social Reform| work= Progressive Review| number= 7| date= April 1897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, opponents of the welfare state have expressed apprehension about the creation of a large, possibly self-interested, bureaucracy required to administer it and the tax burden on the wealthier citizens that this entailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Alan |last= Ryan| title= The Making of Modern Liberalism| publisher= Princeton and Oxford University Presses| year= 2012| pages= 26 and passim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political historian [[Alan Ryan]] points out that the modern welfare state stops short of being an "advance in the direction of socialism.... its egalitarian elements are more minimal than either its defenders or its critics think". It does not entail advocacy for [[social ownership]] of industry. The modern welfare state, Ryan writes, does not set out
&lt;blockquote&gt;to make the poor richer and the rich poorer, which is a central element in socialism, but to help people to provide for themselves in sickness while they enjoy good health, to put money aside to cover unemployment while they are in work, and to have adults provide for the education of their own and other people's children, expecting those children's future taxes to pay in due course for the pensions of their parents’ generation. These are devices for shifting income across different stages in life, not for shifting income across classes. Another distinct difference is that social insurance does not aim to transform work and working relations; employers and employees pay taxes at a level they would not have done in the nineteenth century, but owners are not expropriated, profits are not illegitimate, cooperativism does not replace hierarchical management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Alan |last= Ryan| title= On Politics, Book Two: A History of Political Thought From Hobbes to the Present| publisher= Liveright| year= 2012| pages= 904−05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Historian [[Walter Scheidel]] has commented that the establishment of welfare states in the West in the early 20th century could be partly a reaction by elites to the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] and its violence against the bourgeoisie, which feared violent revolution in its own backyard. They were diminished decades later as the perceived threat receded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's a little tricky because the US never really had any strong leftist movement. But if you look at Europe, after 1917 people were really scared about communism in all the Western European countries. ''You have all these poor people, they might rise up and kill us and take our stuff.'' That wasn't just a fantasy because it was happening next door. And that, we can show, did trigger steps in the direction of having more welfare programs and a rudimentary safety net in response to fear of communism. Not that they [the communists] would invade, but that there would be homegrown movements of this sort. American populism is a little different because it's more detached from that. But it happens roughly at the same time, and people in America are worried about communism, too{{snd}}not necessarily very reasonably. But that was always in the background. And people have only begun to study systematically to what extent the threat, real or imagined, of this type of radical regime really influenced policy changes in Western democracies. You don't necessarily even have to go out and kill rich people{{snd}}if there was some plausible alternative out there, it would arguably have an impact on policy making at home. That's certainly there in the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, and 60s. And there's a debate, right, because it becomes clear that the Soviet Union is really not in very good shape, and people don't really like to be there, and all these movements lost their appeal. That's a contributing factor, arguably, that the end of the [[Cold War]] coincides roughly with the time when inequality really starts going up again, because elites are much more relaxed about the possibility of credible alternatives or threats being out there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Taylor |first= Matt|date=February 22, 2017 |title=One Recipe for a More Equal World: Mass Death|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/one-recipe-for-a-more-equal-world-mass-death|work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |location= |access-date=April 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==HKAA presidency==
[[File:RedBull F1 event in Lung Wo Road 2011.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Red Bull Dragon Run in Hong Kong.]]
In June 2011, after [[Scuderia Toro Rosso]] driver [[Jaime Alguersuari]] took a Red Bull Show Car run to the Chinese city state, demoing a Red Bull around [[Lung Wo Road]] and performing a number of short sprints, burnouts and donuts. Wesley Wan told the [[South China Morning Post]]. "This is the first step in gaining the support of the people, we want to raise the exposure of F1 by staging this live show, and I hope it will lead to Hong Kong hosting a grand prix race one day. My dream is that Hong Kong, like Singapore, Malaysia and China, will be a stop on the grand prix circuit. And as far as a street circuit is concerned, if Monte Carlo and Singapore can have it, why can't Hong Kong?"

Wan also revealed that Hong Kong was sounded out about hosting an F1 race back in 1997, before the former British colony was returned to the Chinese.

Wesley Wan has divorced his former wife Tang Do Yee (唐度怡). Tang left the house on 30 April 2006.&lt;ref name=payrent&gt;{{zh-hk icon}}[http://paper.wenweipo.com/2008/05/31/HK0805310013.htm 雲維熹與前妻爭業權 法官裁定須繳租235萬] ''Wen Wei Po''. 31 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

But Wan continues to occupy the house they shared at [[Chung Hom Kok]], which is valued at HK$50–60 million in 2008. Ms. Tang and Mr. Wan then begin a legal battle for the ownership of the property. The court ordered Wesley Wan to pay rent from the beginning of 2007 until the case is decided, at about HK$150,000 per month. He had to pay an interim fee, totaling HK$2.356 million to the court, which consists of rent from January 2007 to June 2008.&lt;ref name=payrent /&gt;

Wan then invited his girlfriend Lok Mei Mei and their baby to join him. Ms. Tang and her mother's company then filed a lawsuit in court to get Ms. Lok and the baby to move out. Lok Mei Mei is the younger sister of TVB's artists manager [[Virginia Lok]].&lt;ref&gt;{{zh-hk icon}}[http://www.hkdailynews.com.hk/news.php?id=129306 逐妻兒出大屋擅換門鎖 雲維熹前妻入稟 逐前夫新歡出大宅] ''Hong Kong Daily News''.
