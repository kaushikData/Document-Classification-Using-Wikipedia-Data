{{IPA notice}}
{{Contains Arabic text}}
While many languages have numerous dialects that differ in [[phonology]], the contemporary spoken [[Arabic language]] is more properly described as a [[varieties of Arabic|continuum of varieties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kirchhoff|Vergyri|2005|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This article deals primarily with [[Modern Standard Arabic]] (MSA), which is the standard variety shared by educated speakers throughout Arabic-speaking regions. MSA is used in writing in formal print media and orally in newscasts, speeches and formal declarations of numerous types.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kirchhoff|Vergyri|2005|pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Standard Arabic has 28 [[consonant]] [[phoneme]]s and 6 [[vowel]] phonemes (8 vowels in most [[Varieties of Arabic|modern dialects]]). All phonemes contrast between "[[emphatic consonant|emphatic]]" ([[uvularized]]) consonants and non-emphatic ones. Some of these phonemes have coalesced in the various modern dialects, while new phonemes have been introduced through borrowing or phonemic splits. A "phonemic quality of length" applies to consonants as well as vowels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Holes|2004|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{fix|text=does the source use the term 'uvularized'?|date=March 2017}}

==Vowels==
[[File:Arabic vowels (Monophthongs).png|thumb|&lt;!--Don't use the svg version as it has wrong vowel values; short and long values aren't the same for that particular dialect--&gt; Vowel chart representing the pronunciation of long vowels by a Palestinian speaker educated in Beirut. From {{Harvcoltxt|Thelwall|1990|p=38}} (Notice that these values vary between regions across North Africa and West Asia)]]
[[File:Arabic vowels (Diphthongs).svg|thumb|Vowel chart representing the pronunciation of diphthongs by a Palestinian speaker educated in Beirut. From {{Harvcoltxt|Thelwall|1990|p=38}}]]
Modern Standard Arabic has six vowel phonemes forming three pairs of corresponding short and long vowels ({{IPA|/a, aː, i, iː, u, uː/}}). Many spoken varieties also include {{IPA|/oː/}} and {{IPA|/eː/}}. Modern Standard Arabic has two diphthongs (formed by a combination of short {{IPA|/a/}} with the semivowels {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/w/}}) in Classical Arabic with no allophones.  [[Allophony]] in different dialects of Arabic can occur, and is partially conditioned by neighboring consonants within the same word.  As a general rule, for example, {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/aː/}} are:

* {{IPA|/a, aː/}}
** retracted to {{IPAblink|ɑ}} in the environment of a neighboring {{IPA|/r/}}, {{IPA|/q/}} or an [[emphatic consonant]] (one that is [[uvularized]], though customarily transcribed as if [[pharyngealized]]): {{IPA|/sˤ/}}, {{IPA|/dˤ/}}, {{IPA|/tˤ/}}, {{IPA|/ðˤ/}}, {{IPA|/ɫ/}} and in a few regional standard pronunciations also {{IPA|/x/}} and {{IPA|/ɣ/}};&lt;ref name="Thelwall 1990 39"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Thelwall|1990|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** only in Iraq and the [[Arab States of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf]]: {{IPAblink|ɐ}} before a word boundary;&lt;ref name="Thelwall 1990 39"/&gt;
** advanced to {{IPAblink|æ}} in the environment of most consonants:
*** [[labial consonants]] ({{IPA|/m/}}, {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/f/}}),
*** plain (non-emphatic) [[coronal consonant]]s with the exception of {{IPA|/r/}} ({{IPA|/θ/}}, {{IPA|/ð/}}, {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/z/}}, {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/ʃ/}} and {{IPA|/d͡ʒ~ɡ~ʒ/}})
*** [[pharyngeal consonant]]s ({{IPA|/ħ/}} and {{IPA|/ʕ/}})
*** [[glottal consonant]]s ({{IPA|/h/}} and {{IPA|/ʔ/}})
*** {{IPA|/j/}}, {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/w/}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Holes|2004|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Across [[North Africa]] and West Asia, the allophones {{IPA|[æ]}} and  {{IPA|[ɑ]}} may be realized differently, either as {{IPA|[{{IPA link|a}} ~ {{IPA link|ɑ}} ~ {{IPA link|ɛ}}]}}, or both as {{IPA|[{{IPA link|a}} ~ {{IPA link|ä}}]}}
** In northwestern Africa, the open front vowel {{IPAslink|æ}} is raised to {{IPAblink|ɛ}} or {{IPAblink|e}}.
* {{IPA|/i, iː, u, uː/}}
** Across North Africa and West Asia, {{IPA|/i/}} may be realized as {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɪ}} ~ {{IPA link|e}} ~ {{IPA link|ɨ}}]}} before or adjacent to emphatic consonants and {{IPAblink|q}}, {{IPAblink|r}}, {{IPAblink|ħ}}, {{IPAblink|ʕ}}. {{IPA|/u/}} can also have different realizations, i.e. {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ʊ}} ~ {{IPA link|o}} ~ {{IPA link|ʉ}}]}}. Sometimes with one value for each vowel in both short and long [[Vowel length|lengths]] or two different values for each short and long lengths. They are distinct phonemes in loan words.
** In Egypt, close vowels have different values; short initial or medial: {{IPAblink|e}},&amp;nbsp;{{IPAblink|o}} ← instead of {{IPA|/i,&amp;nbsp;u/}}. {{IPA|/i~ɪ/}} and {{IPA|/u~ʊ/}} completely become {{IPA|[e]}} and {{IPA|[o]}} respectively in some other particular dialects. Unstressed final long {{IPA|/aː,&amp;nbsp;iː,&amp;nbsp;uː/}} are most often shortened or reduced: {{IPA|/aː/}}&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;{{IPA|[æ ~ ɑ]}}, {{IPA|/iː/}}&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;{{IPA|[i]}}, {{IPA|/uː/}}&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;{{IPA|[o~u]}}.

However, the actual rules governing vowel-retraction are a good deal more complex, and have relatively little in the way of an agreed-upon standard, as there are often competing notions of what constitutes a "prestige" form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abd-El-Jawad|1987|p=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, even highly proficient speakers will import the vowel-retraction rules from their native dialects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abd-El-Jawad|1987|p=361}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, for example, in the Arabic of someone from Cairo emphatic consonants will affect every vowel between word boundaries, whereas certain Saudi speakers exhibit emphasis only on the vowels adjacent to an emphatic consonant.&lt;ref name="Watson 1999 290"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Watson|1999|p=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain speakers (most notably Levantine speakers) exhibit a degree of asymmetry in leftward vs. rightward spread of vowel-retraction.&lt;ref name="Watson 1999 290"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Davis|1995|p=466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final [[syllable weight|heavy syllable]] of a root is stressed.&lt;ref name="Thelwall 1990 38"/&gt;

However, the pronunciation of [[loanword]]s is highly dependent on the speaker's native variety.

The long mid vowels {{IPA|/oː/}} and {{IPA|/eː/}} appear in to be phonemic in most varieties of Arabic, and they can be used in Modern Standard Arabic in some stable loanwords or foreign names,&lt;ref name="EMSA1"&gt;Elementary Modern Standard Arabic: Volume 1, by Peter F. Abboud (Editor), Ernest N. McCarus (Editor)&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. {{lang|ar|كوكاكولا}} {{IPA|/ko(ː)kaˈkoːla/}} ('Coca-Cola'), {{lang|ar|شوكولاتة}} {{IPA|/ʃo(ː)ko(ː)ˈlaːta/}} ('chocolate'), {{lang|ar|دكتور}} {{IPA|/dukˈtoːr/}} or {{IPA|/dokˈtoːr/}} ('doctor'), {{lang|ar|جون}} {{IPA|/(d)ʒoːn/}} ('[[John (first name)|John]]'), {{lang|ar|توم}} {{IPA|/to(ː)m/}} ('Tom'), {{lang|ar|بلجيكا}} {{IPA|/belˈ(d)ʒiːka/}} ('Belgium'), {{lang|ar|سكرتير}} {{IPA|/sekreˈteːr/}} or {{IPA|/sekerˈteːr/}} ('secretary'), etc. Foreign words often have a liberal sprinkling of long vowels, as their word shapes do not conform to standardized prescriptive pronunciations written by letters for short vowels.&lt;ref name="TYA"&gt;Teach Yourself Arabic, by Jack Smart (Author), Frances Altorfer (Author)&lt;/ref&gt; When in need the letters {{lang|ar|ي}} or {{lang|ar|و}} are always used to render the long vowels {{IPA|/eː/}} and {{IPA|/oː/}}.

==Consonants==
{{See also|Arabic letters|sun and moon letters}}

Even in the most formal of conventions, pronunciation depends upon a speaker's background.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Holes|2004|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the number and phonetic character of most of the 28 consonants has a broad degree of regularity among Arabic-speaking regions. Note that Arabic is particularly rich in [[uvular consonant|uvular]], [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]], and [[pharyngealization|pharyngealized]] ("[[emphatic consonant|emphatic]]") sounds. The emphatic [[coronal consonant|coronal]]s ({{IPA|/sˤ/}}, {{IPA|/dˤ/}}, {{IPA|/tˤ/}}, and {{IPA|/ðˤ/}}) cause [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] of emphasis to adjacent non-emphatic coronal consonants.{{citation needed|date=September 2008}} The phonemes {{IPA|/p/}} ⟨[[Pe (Persian letter)|پ]]⟩ and {{IPA|/v/}} ⟨[[Ve (Arabic letter)|ڤ]]⟩ (not used by all speakers) are not considered to be part of the phonemic inventory, as they exist only in foreign words and they can be pronounced as {{IPA|/b/}} ⟨[[ب]]⟩ and {{IPA|/f/}} ⟨[[ف]]⟩ respectively depending on the speaker.&lt;ref name="TYA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wehr&gt;Hans Wehr, ''[[Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic]]'' (transl. of ''Arabisches Wörterbuch für die Schriftsprache der Gegenwart'', 1952)&lt;/ref&gt;. The standard pronunciation of ⟨[[ج]]⟩ {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}} varies regionally, most prominently {{IPAblink|d͡ʒ}} in the [[Arabian Peninsula]], parts of the [[Levant]], [[Iraq]], northern [[Algeria]] and [[Sudan]], it is also considered as the predominant pronunciation of Literary Arabic outside the Arab world, {{IPAblink|ʒ}} in most of [[Maghreb|Northwest Africa]] and the Levant, and {{IPAblink|g}} only in [[Egypt]].

Foreign sounds {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/v/}} are usually transcribed as {{lang|ar|ب}} {{IPA|/b/}} and {{lang|ar|ف}} {{IPA|/f/}}, respectively. In some words, they are pronounced as in the original language ({{IPA|/p/}} and {{IPA|/v/}}), e.g. {{lang|ar|باكستان}} or {{lang|fa|پاکستان}} {{IPA|/pa(ː)kistaːn, ba(ː)kistaːn/}} "Pakistan", {{lang|ar|فيروس}} or {{lang|ar|ڤيروس}} {{IPA|/vi(ː)ru(ː)s, vajru(ː)s/}} "virus", etc. Sometimes the Persian letter (with 3 dots) {{lang|fa|ﭖ}} {{IPA|/p/}} and a modified {{lang|ar|ﭪ}} {{IPA|/v/}} letter are used for this purpose. As these letters are not present on standard keyboards, they are simply written with {{lang|ar|ب}} {{IPA|/b/}} and {{lang|ar|ف}} {{IPA|/f/}}, e.g. both {{lang|ar|نوفمبر}} and {{lang|ar|نوڤمبر}} {{IPA|/nu(ː)fambar/}}, {{IPA|/novambar, -ber/}} or {{IPA|/nofember/}} "November", both {{lang|ar|كاپريس}} and {{lang|ar|كابريس}} {{IPA|/ka(ː)pri(ː)s, ka(ː)bri(ː)s/}} "caprice" can be used.&lt;ref name="TYA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wehr&gt;Hans Wehr, ''[[Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic]]'' (transl. of ''Arabisches Wörterbuch für die Schriftsprache der Gegenwart'', 1952)&lt;/ref&gt; The use of both sounds may be considered marginal and Arabs may pronounce the words interchangeably; besides, many loanwords have become Arabicized.

Long ([[geminate]] or double) consonants are pronounced exactly like short consonants, but last longer. In Arabic, they are called ''mushaddadah'' ("strengthened", marked with a [[shaddah]]), but they are not actually pronounced any "stronger". Between a long consonant and a pause, an [[epenthetic]] {{IPA|[ə]}} occurs,&lt;ref name="Thelwall 1990 38"/&gt; but this is only common across regions in West Asia.

==Phonotactics==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}
Arabic syllable structure can be summarized as follows, in which parentheses enclose optional components:
* (C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) V (S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;))

Arabic [[Syllable#Structure|syllable structure]] consists of an optional syllable onset, consisting of one or two consonants; an obligatory syllable nucleus, consisting of a vowel optionally preceded by and/or followed by a [[semivowel]]; and an optional syllable coda, consisting of one or two consonants.  The following restrictions apply:

* Onset
** First consonant (C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;): Can be any consonant, including a liquid ({{IPA|/l, r/}}). (Onset is composed only of one consonant; consonant clusters are only found in [[loanwords]], sometimes an epenthetic {{IPA|/a/}} is inserted between consonants.)
* Nucleus
** Semivowel (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)
** Vowel (V)
** Semivowel (S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
* Coda
** First consonant (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;): Can be any consonant.
** Second consonant (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;): Can also be any consonant.

==Word stress==

The placement of word stress in Arabic varies considerably from one dialect to another, and has been the focus of extensive research and debate.

In determining stress, Arabic distinguishes three types of syllables:&lt;ref&gt;Watson, JCE (2011) Word stress in Arabic. In: The Blackwell companion to phonology. Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford, 2990-3019 (p. 2991), http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/75747/.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Light:
** An open syllable containing a short vowel (i.e. CV), such as ''wa'' 'and'
* Heavy:
** An open syllable containing a long vowel (i.e. CVV), such as ''sā.fara'' 'he travelled'
** A closed syllable containing a short vowel followed by one consonant (i.e. CVC), such as ''min'' 'from' or ''ka.tab.tu'' 'I wrote'
* Super-heavy:
** A closed syllable containing a long vowel followed by one consonant (i.e. CVVC), such as ''bāb#'' 'door' or ''mād.dun'' 'stretching (NOM)'
** A closed syllable containing a vowel of any length followed by two consonants (i.e. CVCC, CVVCC), such as ''bint#'' 'girl' or ''mādd#'' 'stretching'

The word stress of Classical Arabic has been the subject of debate. However, there is consensus as to the general rule, even though there are some exceptions. A simple rule of thumb is that word-stress falls on the penultimate syllable of a word if that syllable is closed, and otherwise on the antepenultimate.&lt;ref&gt;Kees Versteegh, ''The Arabic Language'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1997), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more precise description is J. C. E. Watson's. Here the stressed syllable follows the marker ' and variant rules are in brackets:&lt;ref&gt;Watson, JCE (2011) Word stress in Arabic. In: The Blackwell companion to phonology. Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford, 2990-3019 (p. 3003), http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/75747/.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Stress a pre-[[Pausa|pausal]] superheavy (CVVC, CVVGG, or CVCC) syllable: {{IPA|[kiˈtaːb]}} ‘book’, {{IPA|[ˈmaːdd]}} ‘stretching (MASC SG)’, {{IPA|[ʃaːˈribt]}} ‘I/you (MASC SG) drank’.
# Otherwise, stress the rightmost (ending) non-final heavy (CVV, CVC, or CVVG) syllable (up to the antepenult): {{IPA|[daˈrasnaː]}} ‘we learnt’, {{IPA|[ṣaːˈbuːnun]}} ‘soap (NOM)’, {{IPA|[ˈmaktabah]}} ‘library’, {{IPA|[ˈmaːddun]}} ‘stretching (NOM)’, {{IPA|[ˈmaktabatun]}} ‘library’ (non-pause) (or {{IPA|[makˈtabatun]}}).
# Otherwise, stress the leftmost (beginning) CV syllable (or antepenult): {{IPA|[ˈkataba]}} ‘he wrote’, {{IPA|[ˈkatabatuhu]}} ‘library’ (or {{IPA|[kataˈbatuhu]}}).

Modern Arabic dialects all maintain rules (1) and (2). But if there is neither a final superheavy syllable nor a heavy penultimate syllable, their behaviour varies. Thus in Palestinian, rule (3) is instead 'otherwise stress the first syllable (up to the antepenult): {{IPA|[ˈkatab]}} ‘he wrote’, {{IPA|[ˈzalama]}} ‘man’', whereas the basic rules of Cairene (to which there are exceptions) are:&lt;ref&gt;Watson, JCE (2011) Word stress in Arabic. In: The Blackwell companion to phonology. Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford, 2990-3019 (pp. 2993, 3004), http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/75747/.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Stress a superheavy ultima.
# Otherwise, stress a heavy penult.
# Otherwise, stress the penult or antepenult, whichever is separated by an even number of syllables from the rightmost non-final heavy syllable, or, if there is no non-final heavy syllable, from the left boundary of the word.

==Local variations of Modern Standard Arabic==

[[varieties of Arabic|Spoken varieties]] differ from [[Classical Arabic]] and [[Modern Standard Arabic]] not only in grammar but also in pronunciation. Outside of the Arabian peninsula, a major linguistic division is between ''sedentary'' varieties, largely urban varieties. Inside the Arabian peninsula and in Iraq, the two types are less distinct; but the language of the urbanized [[Hijaz]], at least, strongly looks like a conservative sedentary variety.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In Modern Standard Arabic {{IPA|/g/}} is used as a marginal phoneme to pronounce some dialectal and loan words.
On the other hand it is considered a native [[phoneme]] or [[allophone]] in most modern Arabic dialects, mostly as a variant of {{lang|ar|ق}} {{IPA|/q/}} (as in [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Arabian Peninsula]] and [[Northwest African]] dialects) or as a variant of {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}} {{lang|ar|ج}} (as in Egyptian and a number of Yemeni and Omani dialects). It is also considered a separate foreign phoneme that appears only in loanwords, as in most urban [[Levant]]ine dialects where {{lang|ar|ق}} is {{IPA|/ʔ/}} and {{lang|ar|ج}} is {{IPA|/d͡ʒ~ʒ/}}.

The [[phoneme]] represented by the Arabic letter ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ǧīm}}'' ({{lang|ar|[[ج]]}}) has many standard pronunciations: {{IPAblink|d͡ʒ}} in most of the Arabian Peninsula and as the predominant pronunciation of Literary Arabic outside the Arab world, {{IPAblink|ɡ}} in most of Egypt and some regions in southern Yemen and southwestern Oman. This is also a characteristic of colloquial [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian]] and southern Yemeni dialects.&lt;ref name="Watson 2002 16"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Watson|2002|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Morocco and western Algeria, it is pronounced as {{IPAblink|ɡ}} in some words, especially colloquially. In most north Africa and most of the [[Levant]], the standard is pronounced {{IPAblink|ʒ}}, and in certain regions of the Persian Gulf colloquially with {{IPAblink|j}}. In some [[Sudanese Arabic|Sudanese]] and [[Yemeni Arabic|Yemeni dialects]], it may be either {{IPA|[ɡʲ]}} or {{IPAblink|ɟ}} as it used to be in [[Classical Arabic]].

{{IPA|/p/}} and {{IPA|/v/}} are not necessarily pronounced by all Arabic speakers, but are often pronounced in names and loanwords. Foreign sounds {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/v/}} are usually transcribed as {{lang|ar|ب}} {{IPA|/b/}} and {{lang|ar|ف}} {{IPA|/f/}}, respectively. In some words, they are pronounced as in the original language ({{IPA|/p/}} and {{IPA|/v/}}), e.g. {{lang|ar|باكستان}} or {{lang|fa|پاکستان}} {{IPA|/pa(ː)kistaːn, ba(ː)kistaːn/}} "Pakistan", {{lang|ar|فيروس}} or {{lang|ar|ڤيروس}} {{IPA|/vi(ː)ru(ː)s, vajru(ː)s/}} "virus", etc. Sometimes the Persian letter (with 3 dots) {{lang|fa|ﭖ}} {{IPA|/p/}} and a modified {{lang|ar|ﭪ}} {{IPA|/v/}} letter are used for this purpose. As these letters are not present on standard keyboards, they are simply written with {{lang|ar|ب}} {{IPA|/b/}} and {{lang|ar|ف}} {{IPA|/f/}}, e.g. both {{lang|ar|نوفمبر}} and {{lang|ar|نوڤمبر}} {{IPA|/nu(ː)fambar/}}, {{IPA|/novambar, -ber/}} or {{IPA|/nofember/}} "November", both {{lang|ar|كاپريس}} and {{lang|ar|كابريس}} {{IPA|/ka(ː)pri(ː)s, ka(ː)bri(ː)s/}} "caprice" can be used.&lt;ref name="TYA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wehr&gt;Hans Wehr, ''[[Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic]]'' (transl. of ''Arabisches Wörterbuch für die Schriftsprache der Gegenwart'', 1952)&lt;/ref&gt; The use of both sounds may be considered marginal and Arabs may pronounce the words interchangeably; besides, many loanwords have become Arabized.

{{IPA|/t͡ʃ/}} is another possible loanword phoneme, as in the word {{script/Arabic|سندوتش}} (''sandawitsh'' 'sandwich'), though a number of varieties instead break up the {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[ʃ]}} sounds with an epenthetic vowel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Watson|2002|pp=60–62}}, citing Ṣan‘ā’ni and Cairene as examples with and without this phoneme, respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian Arabic treats {{IPA|/t͡ʃ/}} as two consonants ({{IPA|[tʃ]}}) and inserts {{IPA|[e]}}, as [{{IPA|teʃ}}C] or [C{{IPA|etʃ}}], when it occurs before or after another consonant. {{IPA|/t͡ʃ/}} is found as normal in [[Iraqi Arabic]] and [[Gulf Arabic]].&lt;ref name="tsh"&gt;[http://www.gulfarabic.com/p11_learn_arabic_sounds.php Gulf Arabic Sounds]&lt;/ref&gt; Normally the combination &lt;big&gt;{{lang|ar|تش}}&lt;/big&gt; (''tā’-shīn'') is used to transliterate the {{IPA|[tʃ]}}. Otherwise Arabic usually substitutes other letters in the transliteration of names and loanwords like the Persian character {{lang|fa|چ}} which is used for writing {{IPA|[tʃ]}}

Other Variations include:
* Split of original {{IPA|/r/}} into two phonemes, distinguished primarily by how they affect neighboring vowels.  This has progressed the farthest in North Africa. See [[Moroccan Arabic]], [[Algerian Arabic]], [[Tunisian Arabic]] and [[Libyan Arabic]]
* Loss of the [[glottal stop]] in places where it is historically attested, as in {{IPA|/samaːʔ/}} → {{IPA|/sama/}}.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

; Vowels

* Development of highly distinctive allophones of {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/aː/}}, with highly fronted {{IPA|[a(ː)]}}, {{IPA|[æ(ː)]}} or {{IPA|[ɛ(ː)]}} in non-emphatic contexts, and retracted {{IPA|[ɑ(ː)]}} in emphatic contexts.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}  The more extreme distinctions are characteristic of sedentary varieties, while Bedouin and conservative Arabian-peninsula varieties have much closer allophones.  In some of the sedentary varieties, the allophones are gradually splitting into new phonemes under the influence of loanwords, where the allophone closest in sound to the source-language vowel often appears regardless of the presence or absence of nearby emphatic consonants.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}
* Spread of "emphasis", visible in the backing of phonemic {{IPA|/a(ː)/}}.  In conservative varieties of the Arabic peninsula, only {{IPA|/a/}} adjacent to emphatic consonants is affected, while in [[Cairo]], an emphatic consonant anywhere in a word tends to trigger emphatic allophones throughout the entire word.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}  Dialects of the Levant are somewhere in between. [[Moroccan Arabic]] is unusual in that {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} have clear emphatic allophones as well (typically lowered, e.g. to {{IPA|[e]}} and {{IPA|[o]}}).{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}
* Monophthongization of diphthongs such as {{IPA|/aj/}} and  {{IPA|/aw/}} to  {{IPA|/eː/}}  and {{IPA|/oː/}}, respectively ({{IPA|/iː/}}  and {{IPA|/uː/}} in parts of the Maghrib, such as in [[Moroccan Arabic]]). Mid vowels may also be present in loanwords such as {{lang|ar|ملبورن}} ({{IPA|/milboːrn/}} [[Melbourne]]), {{lang|ar|سكرتير}} ({{IPA|/sikriteːr/}} '(male) secretary') and {{lang|ar|دكتور}} ({{IPA|/duktoːr/}} 'doctor').&lt;ref name="EMSA1"/&gt;
* Raising of word final {{IPA|/a/}} to {{IPA|[e]}}. In some parts of [[Levant]], also word-medial {{IPA|/aː/}} to {{IPA|[eː]}}. See [[Lebanese Arabic]].
* Loss of final short vowels (with {{IPA|/i/}} sometimes remaining), and shortening of final long vowels.  This triggered the loss of most Classical Arabic case and mood distinctions.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}
* Collapse and deletion of short vowels.  In many varieties, such as North Mesopotamian, many Levantine dialects, many Bedouin dialects of the Maghrib, and Mauritanian, short {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} have collapsed to schwa and exhibit very little distinction so that such dialects have two short vowels, {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/ə/}}.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}  Many Levantine dialects show partial collapse of {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}, which appear as such only in the next-to-last phoneme of a word (i.e. followed by a single word-final consonant), and merge to {{IPA|/ə/}} elsewhere.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} A number of dialects that still allow three short vowels {{IPA|/a/}} {{IPA|/i/}} {{IPA|/u/}} in all positions, such as [[Egyptian Arabic]], nevertheless show little functional contrast between {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} as a result of past sound changes converting one sound into the other.&lt;ref name="Watson 2002 22"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Watson|2002|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic varieties everywhere have a tendency to delete short vowels (especially other than {{IPA|/a/}}) in many phonological contexts.  When combined with the operation of [[inflectional morphology]], disallowed consonant clusters often result, which are broken up by [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] short vowels, automatically inserted by phonological rules.  In these respects (as in many others), [[Moroccan Arabic]] has the most extreme changes, with all three short vowels {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/u/}} collapsing to a schwa {{IPA|/ə/}}, which is then deleted in nearly all contexts.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} This variety, in fact, has essentially lost the quantitative distinction between short and long vowels in favor of a new qualitative distinction between unstable "reduced" vowels (especially {{IPA|/ə/}}) and stable, half-long "full" vowels {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/u/}} (the reflexes of original long vowels).{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} [[Classical Arabic]] words borrowed into [[Moroccan Arabic]] are pronounced entirely with "full" vowels regardless of the length of the original vowel.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Phonologies of different Arabic dialects==
The main dialectal variations in Arabic consonants revolve around the six consonants; {{angbr|[[ǧīm|ج]]}}, {{angbr|[[Qāf|ق]]}}, {{angbr|[[Ṯāʾ|ث]]}}, {{angbr|[[Ḏāl|ذ]]}}, {{angbr|[[Ḍād|ض]]}} and {{angbr|[[Ẓāʾ|ظ]]}}:

===Cairene===
{{main|Egyptian Arabic}}
The Arabic of [[Cairo]] (often called "[[Egyptian Arabic]]" or more correctly "Cairene Arabic") is a typical sedentary variety and a de facto standard variety among certain segments of the Arabic-speaking population, due to the dominance of Egyptian media.  Watson adds emphatic labials {{IPA|[mˤ]}} and {{IPA|[bˤ]}}&lt;ref name="Watson 2002 14"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Watson|2002|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and emphatic {{IPA|[rˤ]}}&lt;ref name="Watson 2002 16"/&gt;  to Cairene Arabic with marginal phonemic status.  Cairene has also merged the interdental consonants with the dental plosives (e.g. {{IPA|/θalaːθa/}} → {{IPA|[tæˈlæːtæ]}}, 'three') except in loanwords from Classical Arabic where they are nativized as sibilant fricatives (e.g. {{IPA|/θaːnawijja/}} → {{IPA|[sænæˈwejja]}}, '[[secondary school]]'). Cairene speakers pronounce {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}} as {{IPA|[ɡ]}} and [[debuccalization|debuccalized]] {{IPA|/q/}} to {{IPA|[ʔ]}} (again, loanwords from Classical Arabic have reintroduced the earlier sound&lt;ref name="Watson 2002 22"/&gt; or approximated to {{IPA|[k]}} with the front vowel around it {{IPAblink|æ}} changed to the back vowel {{IPAblink|ɑ}}).  Classical Arabic diphthongs {{IPA|/aj/}} and {{IPA|/aw/}} became realized as {{IPA|[eː]}} and {{IPA|[oː]}} respectively. Still, Egyptian Arabic sometimes has minimal pairs like {{IPA|[ˈʃæjlæ]}} ('carrying' f.s.) vs {{IPA|[ˈʃeːlæ]}} ('burden'). {{IPA|[ɡeːb]}} 'pocket' + {{IPA|[næ]}} 'our' → collapsing with {{IPA|[ˈɡebnæ]}} which means ('cheese' or 'our pocket'),&lt;ref name="Watson 2002 23"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Watson|2002|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; because Cairene phonology can't have long vowels before two consonants. Cairene also has {{IPAblink|ʒ}} as a marginal phoneme from loanwords from languages other than Classical Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Watson|2002|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sanaa===
{{see also|Yemeni Arabic#San'ani Arabic dialect}}
Varieties such as that of [[Sana'a|Sanaa]], [[Yemen]], are more conservative and retain most phonemic contrasts of Classical Arabic. Sanaani possesses {{IPAblink|ɡ}} as a reflex of Classical {{IPAslink|q}} (which still functions as an emphatic consonant).&lt;ref name="Watson 2002 23"/&gt;  In unstressed syllables, Sanaani short vowels may be reduced to {{IPAblink|ə}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Watson|2002|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA|/tˤ/}} is voiced to {{IPA|[dˤ]}} in initial and intervocalic positions.&lt;ref name="Watson 2002 14"/&gt;

===Morocco===
{{See also|Moroccan Arabic}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
Of all the mainstream varieties of Arabic, Moroccan Arabic is likely the one that has diverged the most from Classical Arabic, similarly to the position of [[French language|French]] in the [[Romance languages]] and [[English language|English]] among the [[Germanic languages]].  As described above, Moroccan has heavily innovated in its vowel phonology, under heavy Berber influence.  Short vowels {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} merged into {{IPA|/ə/}}. More recently, most instances of short {{IPA|/u/}} have also merged into {{IPA|/ə/}}; the few that remain are mostly in the vicinity of velars and uvulars, which suggests an alternative analysis with phonemically rounded consonants (e.g. [[Labialization|labiovelar]]s) and only one short vowel {{IPA|/ə/}}.  This schwa, in turn, is phonemically deleted in all contexts except directly followed by a single word-final consonant or in some three-consonant words of the shape ''CəCC''.  This inevitably results in some very long, complex consonant clusters, which (unlike most other Arabic varieties) Moroccan Arabic is remarkably tolerant of, only tending to insert [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] schwas to break up the clusters at a slow rate of speech.  Unlike in other varieties, doubled consonants are never reduced, but are pronounced clearly whether occurring at the beginning of a word, end of a word, between vowels or before or after a consonant.  With the collapse of short vowels, speakers no longer perceive a long vs. short distinction in vowels, which has been replaced with a "full" vs. "reduced/unstable" distinction.  "Full" vowels (actually pronounced half-long) substitute for both the long and short vowels of Classical Arabic in borrowings; as a result, these borrowings can be immediately identified by their phonology.

A number of other unique or unusual developments have taken place.  Stress is, for the most part, not detectable at all; to the extent stressed syllables can be identified, there is often no consistent pattern governing which syllable is stressed.  Original {{IPA|/q/}} has split into two phonemes {{IPA|/q/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, reflecting the origin of Moroccan Arabic as a mixture of a sedentary and Bedouin dialect.
Original diphthongs {{IPA|/aj/}}, {{IPA|/aw/}} have merged into full vowels {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/u/}} rather than generating new vowel qualities; but "long diphthongs" {{IPA|/aj/}}, {{IPA|/aw/}} also exist, best analyzed as a combination of full vowel {{IPA|/a/}} and semivowel.  Unlike most other varieties, emphasis not only triggers front/back allophones in {{IPA|/a/}}, but also high/low allophones in {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}, and {{IPA|/ə/}} varies between non-emphatic {{IPA|[ɪ̆]}}, emphatic {{IPA|[ə̆]}}, and pharyngeal-environment {{IPA|[ʌ̆]}}.  On the other hand, emphasis spreads only as far as the first full vowel in either direction, unlike in most sedentary varieties where emphasis can spread much more widely, sometimes throughout the entire word.  For the purposes of emphasis, {{IPA|/r/}} splits completely into non-emphatic {{IPA|/r/}} and emphatic {{IPA|/rˤ/}}, distinguishable mostly by their effects on adjacent vowels; with very few exceptions, the choice of one or another is consistent across all words derived from a given root.  Most emphatic/nonemphatic pairs behave similarly, but {{IPA|/t/}} is [[affrication|affricated]] {{IPA|[tˢ]}} while {{IPA|/tˤ/}} is non-affricated {{IPA|[t]}}, so it is always possible to distinguish the two without recourse to their effects on surrounding vowels.

==Distribution==
The most frequent consonant phoneme is {{IPA|/r/}}, the rarest is {{IPA|/ðˤ/}}.  The frequency distribution of the 28 consonant phonemes, based on the 2,967 triliteral roots listed by Wehr&lt;ref name=Wehr/&gt; is (with the percentage of roots in which each phoneme occurs):

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"

This distribution does not necessarily reflect the actual frequency of occurrence of the phonemes in speech, since pronouns, prepositions and suffixes are not taken into account, and the roots themselves will occur with varying frequency. In particular, {{IPA|/t/}} occurs in several extremely common [[affix]]es (occurring in the marker for second-person or feminine third-person as a [[prefix]], the marker for first-person or feminine third-person as a [[suffix]], and as the second element of [[Arabic grammar#Stem formation|Forms VIII and X]] as an [[infix]]) despite being fifth from last on Wehr's list. The list does give, however, an idea of which phonemes are more marginal than others. Note that the five least frequent letters are among the six letters added to those inherited from the [[Phoenician alphabet]], namely, {{transl|ar|DIN|[[ḍād]]}}, {{transl|ar|DIN|[[ṯāʾ]]}}, {{transl|ar|DIN|[[ḫāʾ]]}}, {{transl|ar|DIN|[[ẓāʾ]]}}, {{transl|ar|DIN|[[ḏāl]]}} and {{transl|ar|DIN|[[ghain|ġayn]]}}.

==Sample==
The [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] sample text is a reading of [[The North Wind and the Sun]] by a speaker who was born in [[Safed]], lived and was educated in [[Beirut]] from age 8 to 15, subsequently studied and taught in [[Damascus]], studied phonetics in Scotland and since then has resided in Scotland and Kuwait.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Thelwall|1990|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Biao language''' ({{zh|标话}}; also known as '''Kang Bau''' or '''Kang Beu''') is a [[Kra–Dai language]] (or perhaps three languages)&lt;ref name=Glottolog/&gt; spoken in southwestern [[Huaiji County]] and [[Fengkai County]], [[Zhaoqing]], [[Guangdong]]. Autonyms are ''{{IPA|kaːŋ˩ peu̯˥}}'' and ''{{IPA|kaːŋ˩ paːu̯˥}}''.

==Classification==
Like [[Lakkia language|Lakkia]], the genetic affiliation of the Biao language within the Kra–Dai family is uncertain, although it could be a [[sister group|sister]] of the [[Kam–Sui languages]].&lt;ref name=edmondson1988&gt;Edmondson, Jerold A. and David B. Solnit, editors. 1988. Comparative Kadai: Linguistic studies beyond Tai. Summer Institute of Linguistics and the University of Texas at Arlington Publications in Linguistics, 86. Dallas: Summer Institute of Linguistics and the University of Texas at Arlington. vii, 374 p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tai"&gt;Edmondson, Jerold A. and David B. Solnit, editors. 1997. Comparative Kadai: the Tai branch. Summer Institute of Linguistics and the University of Texas at Arlington Publications in Linguistics, 124. Dallas: Summer Institute of Linguistics and the University of Texas at Arlington. vi, 382 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Hsiu (2014)&lt;ref name="Hsiu2014"/&gt; suggests that Biao could either subgroup with [[Lakkia language|Lakkia]], or form an independent branch of [[Kra–Dai languages|Kra–Dai]] on its own.

==Dialects==
There are three dialects of Biao (Hsiu 2014).&lt;ref name="Hsiu2014"&gt;Hsiu, Andrew. 2014. ''[https://www.academia.edu/7247129/The_Biao_languages_of_northwestern_Guangdong_China_handout_ The Biao languages of northwestern Guangdong, China]''. Presented at SEALS 24, Yangon University, Yangon, Myanmar. ([https://www.academia.edu/7247103/The_Biao_languages_of_northwestern_Guangdong_China_PPT_ PPT slides]) {{doi|10.5281/zenodo.1127818}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shidong dialect is documented in detail by Liang (2002). Additional data from the Yonggu and Dagang dialects are documented by Hsiu (2014).
*Shidong
*Yonggu
*Dagang

==Distribution==
Variants of Biao include the Shidong 诗洞, Yonggu 永固, Qiaotou 桥头, and Dagang 大岗 dialects (Liang 2002:3). In [[Fengkai County]], it is spoken in Chang'an 长安, Jinzhuang 金装, and Qixing 七星. The ''Fengshan County Almanac'' (1998) reports that in Fengkai County, (''piau42'') is spoken by 7,217 people in 48 natural villages in Chang'an 长安, Baoshan 宝山, and Dongshan 东山 townships. Fengkai Biao is reported by the ''Fengshan County Almanac'' (1998) to be a distinct dialect from Biao of [[Huaiji County]]. Yang (2011) reports that Biao is also spoken in Liandu 莲都 and He'erkou 河儿口镇 in [[Fengkai County]], and Shatian 沙田镇, [[Hezhou]], Guangxi.

===Yang (2010)===
According to Yang Biwan (2010), there are more than 160,000 speakers of Biao.&lt;ref name="Yang2010"&gt;Yang Biwan [杨璧菀] (2010). [http://wuxizazhi.cnki.net/Search/WZGZ201004018.html 标话的名称由来及地理分布].&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhisagarsuri was born as Bechardas Patel in Hindu family of Shivabhai and Ambaben in 1874 at [[Vijapur]] in north Gujarat. He studied up to sixth standard. He met Muni Ravisagar, a Jain monk, and became his disciple. He studied at Yashovijay Sanskrit Pathshala in [[Mehsana]], a school for religious studies. He took job of religious teacher in Ajol near Mehsana. Upon death of Ravisagar in 1898, his spiritual quest intensified. Ravisagar's disciple, Sukhsagar initiated him as a Jain monk in 1901. He was given a new name, Muni Buddhisagar. He was conferred with informal title of ''Yog-nishtha'', firm in [[Yoga]]. He was elevated to title of ''Acharya'' in 1914 in [[Mansa, Gujarat|Mansa]].&lt;ref name="Cort2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Cort|title=Framing the Jina: Narratives of Icons and Idols in Jain History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MDBpq23-0QoC&amp;pg=PA250|date=16 November 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-973957-8|pages=250–251}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hnu&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herenow4u.net/index.php?id=84508|title=Acharya Shri Buddhi Sagarji►Biography|work=herenow4u.com|date=31 January 2012|accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He established [[Mahudi]] Jain temple in  1917.&lt;ref name=kc&gt;{{cite news| last= Dave| first = Pranav| date= 2 November 2013| title= Kali Chaudas havan revered by all faiths| url=http://m.timesofindia.com/city/ahmedabad/Kali-Chaudas-havan-revered-by-all-faiths/articleshow/25078317.cms

A '''catastrophic kill''', '''K-Kill''' or '''complete kill''' is damage inflicted on an [[armored vehicle]] that amounts to complete destruction of the vehicle, rendering it both permanently non-functional and irreparable.

The term ''knocked out'' refers to a vehicle which has been damaged to the point of inoperability and abandoned by its crew, but is not obviously beyond the point of repair. While a knocked-out vehicle may be later determined to be irreparable and written off, a K-kill is more obvious and usually involves the destruction of the vehicle by [[fire]] and/or [[explosion]]. Among tank crewmen it is also commonly known as a ''brew up'', coined from the British World War II term for lighting a fire in order to brew [[tea]]. The expression arose because British troops used an old petrol tin with holes punched in the side as a makeshift stove on which to brew their tea. The flames licking out of the holes in the side of the tin resembled a burning tank and thus the expression was coined. 

Typically a catastrophic kill results in the [[combustion|ignition]] of any [[fuel]] the vehicle may be carrying as well as the [[detonation]] ([[cooking off]], or [[sympathetic detonation]]) of its [[ammunition]]. A catastrophic kill does not necessarily preclude the survival of the vehicle's crew, although most historical casualties in armored warfare were the result of K-kills. 

This type of kill is also associated with the [[jack-in-the-box effect]], where a [[tank]]'s [[gun turret|turret]] is blown skyward due to the [[overpressure]] of an ammunition explosion. Some tank designs employ [[blow-off panel]]s, channeling such explosions outside of the vehicle, turning an otherwise catastrophic kill into a [[wikt:firepower kill|firepower kill]].

[[File:CentroDeHoja-Bk25-Cuba1941.jpg|right|thumb|A 25 stamp ''centro de hoja'' (center of the sheet) from Cuba, 1941.]]

'''Centro de hoja''' or '''Center of the sheet''' is a kind of [[Cuba]]n [[postage stamp]]s where there are intersecting [[Gutter (philately)|gutters]] between four panes of stamps.&lt;ref&gt;Littrell, Robert; ''Centros de Hoja or Center of the Sheets''; The Cuban Philatelist, Vol.XX, Whole No. 55; 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The horizontal and vertical blank gutters divide the sheet into quadrants of 25 stamps each. The center four or sixteen stamps on a sheet of 100 stamps are collected similar to how [[plate block]]s of four stamps are collected in the United States.  The first ''centro de hoja'' were the [[imperforate]] Cuban patriots issues of 1926.  These had the unique distinctions of being from sheets of 400 rather than 100 and the "gutters" consisted of nothing more than two intersecting lines drawn through the center of the sheet.&lt;ref name=Garcia&gt;Garcia-Frutos, Silvia; ''Cuban Center Gutter Blocks''; The Cuban Philatelist, Vol. X, Whole No. 30, October, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The last was produced with the three bicentennial of coffee issues of 1952.&lt;ref name=Edifil&gt;Edifil; ''Catálogo Especializado de Sellos de Cuba'', Tomo I (1855-1958), 2nd Ed.; Madrid, 2002 (in Spanish). {{ISBN|84-95019-08-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some people classify the Christmas issues of 1960&lt;ref name=Garcia&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as centros de hoja, but since they have no gutters others call them ''special format'' stamps.

A bit over half of the regular issues, special delivery and [[airmail stamp]]s issued between the years 1926 and 1952 were produced with intersecting gutters, giving rise to the collection of ''centros de hoja''.  Some issues can be quite rare.  There were only 200 [[imperforate]] sheets issued in 1936 for each of the fourteen stamps issued to celebrate the opening of the free port of [[Matanzas]].&lt;ref name=Edifil&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the "writers and artists" series of 1937 sold fewer that 180 sheets.&lt;ref name=Edifil&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  There were only 250 sheets printed of the one peso "death of Maceo" stamp in 1948 and the one peso Fernando Figueredo [[overprint]] of 1952.&lt;ref name=Edifil&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Other issues can be plentiful and readily available to collectors.

[[File:Dredge (PSF).png|thumb|A grab dredge]]
'''Dredging''' is the operation of removing material from one part of the water environment and relocating it to another. In all but a few situations the excavation is undertaken by specialist floating plant, known as a dredger. Dredging is carried out in many different locations and for many different purposes, but the main objectives are usually to recover material that has some value or use, or to create a greater depth of water.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web |title=EuDA - About dredging - Dredging |url=https://www.european-dredging.eu/Dredging |website=www.european-dredging.eu |accessdate=3 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Dredging is the form of [[Earthworks (engineering)|excavation]] carried out underwater or partially underwater, in shallow waters or [[ocean dredging|ocean waters]]. It keeps waterways and ports navigable, and assists coastal protection, land reclamation and coastal redevelopment, by gathering up bottom [[sediment]]s and transporting it elsewhere. Dredging can be done to recover materials of commercial value; these may be high value minerals or sediments such as sand and gravel that are used by the construction industry.&lt;ref name=rabobank/&gt;

Dredging is a four-part process: loosening the material, bringing the material to the surface (together extraction),  transportation and disposal.
&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

The material can be brought to the surface by suction or mechanical means.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

The extract can be disposed of locally or transported by barge or in a liquid suspension in kilometre long pipelines. Disposal can be to infill sites, or the material can be used constuctively to replenish eroded sand that has been lost to [[coastal erosion]], or constructively create sea-walls, building land &lt;ref name="About"/&gt; or [[MV Tian Kun Hao|whole new landforms]] such as viable islands in [[coral atoll]]s.&lt;ref name=TianKunHao&gt;{{cite news |title=What is China's 'magic island-making' ship? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-41882081 |accessdate=4 July 2018 |work=BBC News |date=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ancient authors refer to habour dredging. The seven arms of the Nile were channelled and wharfs built at the time of the pyramids (4000 BC), there was extensive harbour building in the eastern Mediterranean from 1000 BC and the disturbed sediment layers gives evidence of dredging. At Marseille, dredging phases are recorded from the third century BC onwards, the most extensive during the first century AD. The remains of three dredging boats have been unearthed; they were abandoned at the bottom of the harbour during the first and second centuries AD.&lt;ref name="MMC"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Morhange |first1=Christophe |last2=Marriner |first2=Nick |last3=Carayon |first3=Nicolas |title=The eco-history of ancient Mediterranean harbours |url=https://www.ancientportsantiques.com/wp-content/uploads/Documents/AUTHORS/Morhange-PublGenerales/Morhange2016-HistoryPorts.pdf|accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dredging machines were used during the construction of the [[Suez Canal Company|Suez Canal]].

==Purposes of dredging==
* '''Maintenance''': dredging to deepen or maintain navigable [[waterway]]s or [[Channel (geography)|channels]] which are threatened to become silted with the passage of time, due to [[sediment]]ed sand and mud, possibly making them too shallow for navigation. This is often carried out with a trailing suction hopper dredge. Most dredging is for this purpose, and it may also be done to maintain the holding capacity of [[reservoir]]s or lakes.
* '''[[Land reclamation]]''': dredging to mine sand, clay or rock from the seabed and using it to construct new land elsewhere. This is typically performed by a cutter-suction dredge or trailing suction hopper dredge. The material may also be used for [[flood]] or [[erosion]] control.
* '''Capital dredging''': dredging carried out to create a new [[harbour]], [[Berth (moorings)|berth]] or [[waterway]], or to deepen existing facilities in order to allow larger ships access. Because capital works usually involve hard material or high-volume works, the work is usually done using a cutter suction dredge or large trailing suction hopper dredge; but for rock works, drilling and blasting along with mechanical excavation may be used.
* '''Preparatory''': dredging work and excavation for future [[bridge]]s, [[pier]]s or [[Dock (maritime)|docks]]or [[Wharf|wharves]], This is often to build the [[Foundation (architecture)|foundations]].
* '''Winning construction materials''': dredging sand and gravels from offshore licensed areas for use in construction industry, principally for use in concrete. This very specialist industry is focused in NW Europe, it uses specialized trailing suction hopper dredgers self discharging the dry cargo ashore.
* '''[[Soil contamination|Contaminant]] [[Environmental remediation|remediation]]''': to reclaim areas affected by chemical spills, storm water surges (with urban runoff), and other soil contaminations, including silt from [[sewage sludge]] and from decayed matter, like wilted plants. Disposal becomes a proportionally large factor in these operations.
* '''[[Flood prevention]]''': dredging increases the channel depth and therefore increase a channel's capacity for carrying water.
* '''[[Fishing dredger|Fishing dredging]]''' is a technique for catching certain species of edible [[clam]]s and [[crab]]s. In Louisiana and other American states, with salt water estuaries that can sustain bottom [[oyster bed]]s, oysters are raised and harvested. A heavy rectangular metal scoop is towed astern of a moving boat with a chain bridle attached to a cable. This drags along the bottom scooping up oysters. It is periodically winched aboard and the catch is sorted and bagged for shipment.&lt;ref name="reasons"/&gt;
===Other===
* '''Harvesting materials''': dredging [[sediment]] for elements like [[gold]], [[diamond]]s or other valuable trace substances. Hobbyists examine their dredged matter to pick out items of potential value, similar to the [[Coin shooting|hobby of metal detecting]]. &lt;!-- Look again --&gt;
* '''[[Beach nourishment]]''': this is mining sand offshore and placing on a beach to replace sand eroded by storms or wave action. This enhances the recreational and protective function of the beach, which are also eroded by human activity. This is typically performed by a cutter-suction dredge or trailing suction hopper dredge. {{cn|date=July 2018}}
* '''[[Peat extraction]]''': ''dredging poles'' or ''dredge hauls'' were used on the back of small boats to manually dredge the beds of [[peat]]-[[Moorland#Heather moorland|moor]] waterways. The extracted peat was used as a fuel. This tradition is now more or less obsolete. The tools are now significantly changed.{{cn|date=July 2018}}
* '''Removing rubbish and debris''': often done in combination with maintenance dredging, this process removes non-natural matter from the bottoms of rivers and canals and harbours. {{anchor|Police drag}}Law enforcement agencies sometimes need to use a 'drag' to recover evidence or corpses from beneath the water.
* '''[[eutrophication|Anti-eutrophication]]''': A kind of contaminant remediation, dredging is an expensive option for the remediation of eutrophied (or de-oxygenated) water bodies; one of the causes is like mentioned above, [[sewage sludge]]. However, as artificially elevated phosphorus levels in the sediment aggravate the eutrophication process, controlled sediment removal is occasionally the only option for the reclamation of still waters.{{cn|date=July 2018}}
* '''Seabed mining''': is a possible future use, recovering natural metal [[ore]] nodules from the sea's [[abyssal plain|deepest troughs]]. &lt;ref name="reasons"&gt;{{cite web |title=EuDA - About dredging - Dredging - Reasons for Dredging |url=https://www.european-dredging.eu/Reasons_for_Dredging |website=www.european-dredging.eu |accessdate=3 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of dredgers==
===Suction dredgers===
[[Image:Pogłębiarka „Sawa”, głowica, Wisła, Saska Kępa, Warszawa 3.jpg|thumb|The [[dredge drag head]] of a suction dredge [[barge]] on the [[Vistula River]], [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]]]
[[Image:Geopotes 14.jpg|thumb|The Geopotes 14 lifting its boom on a canal in The Netherlands. (''gēopotēs'' is Greek for "that which drinks earth")]]
:''For suction-type excavation out of water, see [[Suction excavator]].''
These operate by sucking through a long tube, like some [[vacuum cleaner]]s but on a larger scale.

A plain suction dredger has no tool at the end of the suction pipe to disturb the material. This is often the most commonly used form of dredging.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

====Trailing suction====
A trailing suction hopper dredger (TSHD) trails its suction pipe when working. The pipe, which is fitted with a [[dredge drag head]], loads the dredge spoil into one or more hoppers in the vessel.
When the hoppers are full, the TSHD sails to a disposal area and either dumps the material through doors in the hull or pumps the material out of the hoppers. Some dredges also self-offload using drag buckets and conveyors.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The largest trailing suction hopper dredgers in the world are currently [[Jan De Nul]]'s ''Cristobal Colon'' (launched 4 July 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandandgravel.com/news/article.asp?v1=11114 |title=Jan de Nul's mega trailer Cristóbal Colón launched - Dredging News Online |publisher=Sandandgravel.com |date=7 July 2008 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and her sister ship ''Leiv Eriksson'' (launched 4 September 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandandgravel.com/news/article.asp?v1=11221 |title=Keel-laying ceremony for Jan de Nul's Leiv Eiriksson held - Dredging News Online |publisher=Sandandgravel.com |date=1 September 2008 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Main design specs for the ''Cristobal Colon'' and the '' Leiv Eriksson'' are: 46,000&amp;nbsp;cubic metre hopper and a design dredging depth of 155&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jandenul.com |title=Jan De Nul Group |publisher=Jandenul.com |date=7 June 2013 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next largest is ''HAM 318'' ([[Van Oord]]) with its 37,293&amp;nbsp;cubic metre hopper and a maximum dredging depth of 101&amp;nbsp;m.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:XLarge cutterhead.jpg|left|thumb|Replaceable pin tooth cutter head used on the largest cutter suction dredges manufactured by Ellicott Dredges]] --&gt;

====Cutter-suction====
A cutter-suction dredger's (CSD) suction tube has a cutting mechanism at the suction inlet. The cutting mechanism loosens the bed material and transports it to the suction mouth. The dredged material is usually sucked up by a wear-resistant centrifugal pump and discharged either through a pipe line or to a barge. Cutter-suction dredgers are most often used in geological areas consisting of hard surface materials (for example gravel deposits or surface bedrock) where a standard suction dredger would be ineffective. They can, if sufficiently powerful, be used instead of underwater blasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.marinelog.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=25244:deme-orders-worlds-most-powerful-cutter-suction-dredge&amp;Itemid=257 | title=DEME orders world's most powerful cutter suction dredge | publisher=Marine Log | date=1 March 2017 | accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, the most powerful cutter-suction dredger in the world is [[Spartacus (ship)|''Spartacus'']], which is scheduled to enter service in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bairdmaritime.com/work-boat-world/marine-projects-world/1245-construction-of-world-s-most-powerful-csd-starts-with-keel | title=Keel laying signals start of world’s most powerful CSD | publisher=Baird Maritime | date=21 December 2017 | accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Auger suction====
The '''auger dredge system''' functions like a cutter suction dredger, but the cutting tool is a rotating [[Archimedean screw]] set at right angles to the suction pipe. The first widely used auger dredges were designed in the 1980s. In 1996, IMS Dredges introduced a self-propelled version operates without anchors or cables. They were primarily used for sludge removal applications from waste water treatment plants; since then they have been used river maintenance and sand mining.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The turbidity shroud on auger dredge systems creates a strong suction vacuum, causing much less turbidity than conical (basket) type cutterheads  and so they are preferred for environmental applications. This and the ability to convey material to the pump faster makes auger dredge systems more productive than similar sized conical (basket) type cutterhead dredges.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

====Jet-lift====
These use the [[Venturi effect]] of a concentrated high-speed stream of water to pull the nearby water, together with bed material, into a pipe.

====Air-lift====
An [[Airlift (dredging device)|airlift]] is a type of small suction dredge. It is sometimes used like other dredges. At other times, an airlift is handheld underwater by a [[underwater diving|diver]].&lt;ref name=RRR4672&gt;{{cite journal |author=Robbins, R |title=USAP Surface-Supplied Diving. |journal=In: Lang, MA and Smith, NE (eds.). Proceedings of Advanced Scientific Diving Workshop: February 23–24, 2006, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC. |year=2006 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4672 |accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It works by blowing air into the pipe, and that air, being lighter than water, rises inside the pipe, dragging water with it.

===Mechanical dredgers===
[[Image:Dredging technique schematic.png|thumb|Bucket dredging]]
Some bucket dredgers and grab dredgers are powerful enough to rip out coral to make a shipping channel through [[coral reef]]s.
&lt;ref name=mechanical&gt;{{cite web |title=Mechanical Dredger |url=https://www.european-dredging.eu/Mechanical_dredger |website=www.european-dredging.eu |accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ErfgoedLeiden LEI001016474 Baggervaartuig Hollandsch Diep 4..jpg|thumb|Old Dutch bucket dredging vessel "Hollandsch Diep 4"]]
====Bucket dredgers====
A [[bucket (machine part)|bucket]] dredger is equipped with a bucket dredge, which is a device that picks up [[sediment]] by mechanical means, often with many circulating buckets attached to a wheel or [[Bucket chain excavator|chain]].&lt;ref name=mechanical/&gt;
====Grab dredgers====
[[Image:Grab Dredging Process.JPG|thumb|Grab (clamshell) dredging in process in [[Port Canaveral]], [[Florida]]]]
A [[Grab (tool)|grab]] dredger picks up seabed material with a [[Clamshell bucket|clam shell bucket]], which hangs from an onboard crane or a [[crane barge]], or is carried by a hydraulic arm, or is mounted like on a [[dragline]]. This technique is often used in excavation of [[bay mud]]. Most of these dredges are crane barges with '''spuds''', steel piles that can be lowered and raised to position the dredge.&lt;ref name=mechanical/&gt;

====Backhoe/dipper dredgers====
A backhoe/dipper dredger has a [[backhoe]] like on some [[excavator]]s. A crude but usable backhoe dredger can be made by mounting a land-type backhoe excavator on a [[Pontoon (boat)|pontoon]]. The six largest backhoe dredgers in the world are currently the Vitruvius, the Mimar Sinan, Postnik Jakovlev (Jan De Nul), the Samson (DEME), the Simson and the Goliath (Van Oord).{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} They featured [[barge]]-mounted excavators. Small backhoe dredgers can be track-mounted and work from the bank of ditches. A backhoe dredger is equipped with a half-open shell. The shell is filled moving towards the machine. Usually dredged material is loaded in barges. This machine is mainly used in harbours and other shallow water.&lt;ref name=mechanical/&gt;
====Bed leveler====
[[File:Bertha being demonstrated on the Exeter Canal Basin - geograph.org.uk - 1055804.jpg|thumb|Steam dredger ''[[Bertha (drag boat)|Bertha]]'', built 1844, on a demonstration run in 1982]] This is a bar or blade which is pulled over the seabed behind any suitable ship or boat. It has an effect similar to that of a [[bulldozer]] on land. The chain-operated steam dredger ''[[Bertha (drag boat)|Bertha]]'', built in 1844 to a design by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel|Brunel]] and now the oldest operational steam vessel in Britain, was of this type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofboats.org/boats/view/bertha/21/bertha|title=Bertha|work=World of Boats|publisher=Eyemouth Marine Centre|accessdate=27 December 2009|location=[[Eyemouth]], Scotland|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604060413/http://www.worldofboats.org/boats/view/bertha/21/bertha|archivedate=4 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Krabbelaar====
This is an early type of dredger which was formerly used in shallow water in the Netherlands. It was a flat-bottomed boat with spikes sticking out of its bottom. As tide current pulled the boat, the spikes scraped seabed material loose, and the tide current washed the material away, hopefully to deeper water. ''Krabbelaar'' is the Dutch word for "scratcher".
====Water injection==== 
&lt;!--How to classify?--&gt;
A water injection dredger uses a small jet to inject water under low pressure (to prevent the sediment from exploding into the surrounding waters) into the seabed to bring the sediment in suspension, which then becomes a [[turbidity current]], which flows away down slope, is moved by a second burst of water from the WID or is carried away in natural currents. Water injection results in a lot of sediment in the water which makes measurement with most hydrographic equipment (for instance: singlebeam echosounders) difficult.

====Pneumatic====
These dredgers use a chamber with inlets, out of which the water is pumped with the inlets closed. It is usually suspended from a crane on land or from a small pontoon or barge. Its effectiveness depends on depth pressure.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}
====Snagboat====
{{Main|Snagboat}}

A [[snagboat]] is designed to remove big debris such as dead trees and parts of trees from North America waterways.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

====Amphibious====
Some of these are any of the above types of dredger, which can operate normally, or by extending legs, also known as spuds, so it stands on the seabed with its hull out of the water. Some forms can go on land.

Some of these are land-type backhoe excavators whose wheels are on long hinged legs so it can drive into shallow water and keep its cab out of water. Some of these may not have a floatable hull and, if so, cannot work in deep water.
[[Oliver Evans]] (1755–1819) in 1804 invented the Oruktor Amphibolos, an amphibious dredger which was America's first steam-powered road vehicle. {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

====Submersible====
These are usually used to recover useful materials from the seabed. Many of them travel on [[continuous track]]. A unique variant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nio.org/past_events/inchoe/dredging_eia.jsp#dredging_1 |title=National Institute of Oceanography, India |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=14 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112162856/http://www.nio.org/past_events/inchoe/dredging_eia.jsp#dredging_1 |archivedate=12 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is intended to walk on legs on the seabed.&lt;ref&gt;"Concept of a mathematical model for prediction of major design parameters of a submersible dredger/miner" by Sritama Sarkar, Neil Bose, Mridul Sarkar, and Dan Walker, in "3rd Indian National Conference on Harbour and Ocean Engineering, National Institute of Oceanography", Dona Paula, [[Goa]] 403 004 [[India]], 7–9 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fishing====
[[File:Dedge haul including live clams and empty shells.jpg|thumb|Dredge haul including live clams and empty shells]]

[[Fishing dredge]]s are used to collect various species of [[clam]]s, [[scallop]]s, [[oyster]]s or [[crab]]s from the seabed. These dredges have the form of a scoop made of chain mesh, and are towed by a [[fishing boat]]. Careless dredging can be destructive to the seabed. Nowadays some scallop dredging is replaced by collecting via [[scuba diving]].&lt;ref name=SPUMS1991&gt;{{cite journal |author=Walker, Margaret |title=What price Tasmanian scallops? A report of morbidity and mortality associated with the scallop diving season in Tasmania 1990. |journal=[[South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society]] Journal |year=1991 |volume=21 |issue=1 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/9414 |accessdate=16 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable individual dredgers===
====A large Asian dredger====
As of June 2018, the largest dredger in Asia is "''[[MV Tian Kun Hao]]''", a 140 metres long dredger constructed in China, with a capacity of 6,000 cubic meters per hour.&lt;ref name="xin"&gt;{{cite news |title=Asia's largest dredging vessel completes first sea trial |url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-06/12/c_137249426_2.htm |accessdate=13 June 2018 |publisher=Xinhua |date=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dredge monitoring software===
Dredgers are often equipped with dredge monitoring software to help the dredge operator position the dredger and monitor the current dredge level. The monitoring software often uses [[Real Time Kinematic]] satellite navigation to accurately record where the machine has been operating and to what depth the machine has dredged to.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Transportation and disposal of materials==
In a "hopper dredger", the dredged materials end up in a large onboard hold called a "hopper." A suction hopper dredger is usually used for maintenance dredging. A hopper dredge usually has doors in its bottom to empty the dredged materials, but some dredges empty their hoppers by splitting the two halves of their hulls on giant hydraulic hinges. Either way, as the vessel dredges, excess water in the dredged materials is spilled off as the heavier solids settle to the bottom of the hopper. This excess water is returned to the sea to reduce weight and increase the amount of solid material (or slurry) that can be carried in one load. When the hopper is filled with [[slurry]], the dredger stops dredging and goes to a dump site and empties its hopper.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Some hopper dredges are designed so they can also be emptied from above using pumps if dump sites are unavailable or if the dredge material is contaminated. Sometimes the slurry of dredgings and water is pumped straight into pipes which deposit it on nearby land. Other times, it is pumped into [[barge]]s (also called [[scow]]s), which deposit it elsewhere while the dredge continues its work.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

A number of vessels, notably in the UK and NW Europe de-water the hopper to dry the cargo to enable it to be discharged onto a quayside 'dry'. This is achieved principally using self discharge bucket wheel, drag scraper or excavator via conveyor systems.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

When contaminated (toxic) sediments are to be removed, or large volume inland disposal sites are unavailable, dredge slurries are reduced to dry solids via a process known as dewatering. Current dewatering techniques employ either centrifuges, Geotube containers, large textile based filters or polymer [[flocculant]]/congealant based apparatus.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In many projects, slurry dewatering is performed in large inland settling pits, although this is becoming less and less common as mechanical dewatering techniques continue to improve.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Similarly, many groups (most notable in east Asia) are performing research towards utilizing dewatered sediments for the production of concretes and construction block, although the high organic content (in many cases) of this material is a hindrance toward such ends.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The proper management of contaminated sediments is a modern-day issue of significant concern. Because of a variety of maintenance activities, thousands of tonnes of contaminated sediment are dredged worldwide from commercial ports and other aquatic areas at high level of industrialization. Dredged material can be reused after appropriate decontamination. A variety of processes has been proposed and tested at different scales of application ([[Environmental remediation#Technologies|technologies for environmental remediation]]). Once decontaminated, the material could well suit the building industry, or could be used for beach nourishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fonti|first1=V|title=To remediate or to not remediate?|url=https://atlasofscience.org/to-remediate-or-to-not-remediate/#more-17692|publisher=Atlas of Science|ref=Fonti, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental impacts==
Dredging can create disturbance to [[aquatic ecosystem]]s, often with adverse impacts.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Newell | first1 = R.C. | last2 = Seiderer | first2 = L.J. | last3 = Hitchcock | first3 = D.R. | year = 1998 | title = The impact of dredging works in coastal waters: A review of the sensitivity to disturbance and subsequent recovery of biological resources on the sea bed | url =http://www.sussex.ac.uk/geography/researchprojects/coastview/dredging/Impact_of_Dredging_Oc_Bio.Ann_Rev.pdf | journal = Oceanography and Marine Biology Annual Review | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 127–178 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, dredge spoils may contain [[toxic]] chemicals that may have an adverse effect on the disposal area; furthermore, the process of dredging often dislodges chemicals residing in [[benthic]] substrates and injects them into the [[water column]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The activity of dredging can create the following principal impacts to the environment:
* Release of toxic chemicals (including [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]] and [[Polychlorinated biphenyls|PCB]]) from bottom [[sediment]]s into the [[water column]].&lt;ref name="Bridges, T S. 2010"&gt;Bridges, T S., Gustavson, K. E., Schroeder, P., Ells, S. J., &amp; Hayes, D. (2010). Dredging processes and remedy effectiveness: Relationship to the 4 Rs of environmental dredging. Integrated Environmental Assessment and Management, 6 (4), 619-630.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Collection of heavy metals lead left by fishing, bullets, 98% mercury reclaimed [natural occurring and left over from gold rush era].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* Short term increases in [[turbidity]], which can affect aquatic [[species]] [[metabolism]] and interfere with [[spawn (biology)|spawning]].  Suction dredging activity is allowed only during non-spawing time frames set by fish and game (in-water work periods).{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* Secondary impacts to [[marsh]] productivity from [[sedimentation]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* Tertiary impacts to [[bird|avifauna]] which may [[prey]] upon contaminated aquatic organisms{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* Secondary impacts to aquatic and benthic organisms' [[metabolism]] and mortality{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* Possible contamination of dredge spoils sites&lt;ref name="Bridges, T S. 2010"/&gt;
* Changes to the topography by the creation of "spoil islands" from the accumulated spoil{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* Releases toxic compound [[Tributyltin]], a popular [[biocide]] used in [[anti-fouling paint]] banned in 2008, back into the water.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The nature of dredging operations and possible environmental impacts cause the industry to be closely regulated and a requirement for comprehensive regional environmental impact assessments with continuous monitoring.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} The U.S. [[Clean Water Act]] requires that any discharge of dredged or fill materials into "waters of the United States," including wetlands, is forbidden unless authorized by a permit issued by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Clean Water Act]], {{USC|33|1311}}, {{USC|33|1362}}, {{USC|33|1344}}{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the potential impacts to the environment, dredging is restricted to licensed areas only with vessel activity monitored closely using automatic GPS systems.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

'''El Molo''' is a possibly extinct language belonging to the [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] branch of the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] language family. It was spoken by the [[El Molo people]] on the southeastern shore of [[Lake Turkana]], in northern Kenya. Alternate names to El Molo are '''Dehes, Elmolo, Fura-Pawa, and Ldes'''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/elo|title=El Molo Ethnologue|last1=Simons|first1=Gary F|date=|website=Languages of the World|publisher=SIL International|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was thought to be extinct in the middle part of the 20th century, but a few speakers were found in the later 20th century. However, it may now be truly extinct, as the eight speakers found in a survey published in 1994 were over 50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://omgvoice.com/news/extinct-kenyan-languages/|title=These 6 Kenyan Languages Are Extinct, According To UNESCO|last=|first=|date=2017-02-01|website=OMGVoice|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the El Molo population have shifted to the neighboring [[Samburu language]].&lt;ref name="e18"/&gt; El Molo also has no known dialects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Oral tradition sees the El Molo people as an offshoot of the Arbore people in South Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;Sobiana 1980, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to be confirmed by El Molo's linguistic proximity to the [[Arbore language]].&lt;ref&gt;Hayward 1984, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==

The possibly extinct El Molo language belonged to the Cushitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El Molo in Kenya|url=https://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/20203/KE|website=Joshua Project|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cushitic languages]] are only known to be spoken by 3% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bunyi|first1=Grace|title=Language in Education in Kenyan Schools|journal=Encyclopedia of Language and Education|issue=Volume 5|pages=33|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-011-4531-2_4|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cushitic is one of the largest language families of East Africa. The geographical area in which Cushitic is spoken stretches from North-East Sudan at the Egyptian border, embracing Eritrea, Jibouti, Somalia, Ethiopia, a considerable part of Kenya, and some areas of Northern Tanzania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lamberti|first1=Marcello|title=Cushitic and Its Classifications|publisher=Anthropos Institut|jstor=40463677}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Population ==
The El Molo population is also referred to as “Dhes, Elmolo, Fura-Pawa, Ldes, and Ndorobo”. There is an ethnic population of about 2,840 according to the 2009 census&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simons|first1=Gary F|title=El Molo|website=Ethnologue: Languages of the World|publisher=SIL International}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the population is decreasing yearly. The location of this Kenyan language is in East and Southern Africa. Individuals belong to six ethnic groups: Turkana, Samburu and Maasai (Eastern Nilotic-speakers); Luo (Western Nilotic- speakers); Rendille and ElMolo (Cushitic- speaking populations). All populations are cattle herders, with the exception of El Molo that are fishermen. Unlike their surrounding neighbors, they do not depend on livestock for livelihood. Fish is their main diet. And occasionally they eat crocodile, turtle, and hippos. There are a few remaining speakers of the language, which is why El Molo (population) are rarely found to speak ''El Molo.'' (the language). Rather, they use “[[Samburu language|Samburu]]", which is now considered to be their primary language after the shift in tongues.

==Kenyan history==
[[Kenya]] is a country that has been considered to be extremely multilingual since the early nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fishman|first1=Joshua|title=Advances in language planning|publisher=Current Trend in Linguistics 7|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=-_LopQs3UDMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq=colonial+period+in+kenya+language&amp;ots=-3sGenol-l&amp;sig=gy9eLHVUECffiC3EI99d6qgF3WM#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different estimates for the ranges of indigenous languages, which is also difficult because many have not been “codified”.&lt;ref&gt;(Abdulaziz 1982; Whiteley, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; As noted when stating statistics with the Development Of The Language in Education Policy there were only 8 indigenous languages that had a textbook produced as late as 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bunyi|first1=Grace|title=Language in Education in Kenyan School|journal=Encyclopedia of Language Education|volume= 5|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intangible cultural heritage===
Intangible cultural heritage (ICH) is the legacy of physical properties and intangible attributes of a group or society that are inherited from past generations, and maintained in the present for the benefit of future generations (Singh 2011). Kenya has a National Heritage Policy that recognizes its diversity and encourages the growth of rich and diverse cultures. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) states that ICH makes people and communities distinguishable in their history, nationalities, languages, ideology and values.&lt;ref name="The Non-Bantu Languages of Kenya"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heine|first1=Bernd|title=The Non-Bantu Languages of Kenya|publisher=Dietrich Reimer|pages=173–218}}&lt;/ref&gt; (46). The past can be understood by studying intangible and tangible heritage that has been preserved over the generations.&lt;ref name="The Non-Bantu Languages of Kenya"/&gt; This verbal and documented history of the land is what allows the growth for the present and future generations. Diverse cultures from surrounding communities also allow diversity to occur at a faster rate than it normally would in this community alone. The transfer of knowledge relies on oral transmission. Although there was a language shift in El Molo to Samburu, in many of these cases where people leave shift to speaking a dominant language, they leave behind vast domains of knowledge that was previously acquired about the land, plants, animals, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=David|title=When Languages Die|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICH was implemented to provide for the protection and conservation of the cultures along with their history and traditions. As the language is dying out, so is the awareness and consciousness of the land that has accumulated over the years.

==Background==
The El Molo today primarily inhabit the northern Eastern Province of Kenya. They are concentrated in Marsabit District on the southeast shore of Lake Turkana, between El Molo bay and Mount Kulal. There is an ethnic population of about 2,840 according to the 2009 census and the population is decreasing yearly.&lt;ref&gt;El Molo at Ethnologue (18th ed., 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; El Molo is critically endangered. There are a few native speakers worldwide. The language is extremely close to extinction since it was shifted as a secondary language by its originators in [[Kenya]]. It was thought to be extinct in the 20th century, but few speakers were later found. Since then, the language '''[[Samburu language|Samburu]]''' has been taking over El Molo and becoming the primary language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simons|first1=Gary|title=Samburu|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/saq|website=Ethnologue: Languages of the World|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on evidence from the '''[[World Oral Literature Project]]''' there is projected to be 8 native speakers remaining. As mentioning in the subsection of how Intangible Cultural Heritage is, most of the indigenous knowledge is lost with there being only few native speakers remaining. Knowledge of the land is being lost in transmission. The ElMolo group are characterized by a low haplotype diversity (0.88), close to that observed in Khoisan hunter-gatherers, and by the non-significance of neutrality tests and the multimodal mismatch distribution indicating small population size and strong genetic drift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tosco|first1=Mauro|title=What Terminal Speakers Can Do to Their Language: the Case of Elmolo|pages=131–143}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an mtDNA study by Castri, the maternal ancestry of the contemporary El Molo consists of a mixture of Afro-Asiatic-associated lineages and Sub-Saharan haplogroups, reflecting substantial female gene flow from neighboring Sub-Saharan populations. A little over 30% of the El Molo belonged to the West Eurasian haplogroups.

==Language shift==

An unsolved question is whether the Elmolo were “originally” speakers of a Cushitic language, and still another is whether they were always fishers or rather pastoralists who turned to fishing out of necessity in an area utterly unsuitable to animal husbandry. Heine (1982) favors the first hypothesis, and claims that traditional fishing in Kenya’s Rift Valley is likely to go back to Eastern Cushites originating from the Ethiopian Highlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heine|first1=Bernd|title=Elmolo. The Non-Bantu Languages of Kenya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Present day===
El Molo compromises of 2 small villages on opposite sides of the Lake Turkana. There are 400 households that hold 1900 people. There are only 2 El Molo villages in Kenya and most likely in the entire world. Although it is not just the youth who cannot speak the mother tongue, '''El Molo''', many elders are not able to construct a sentence in '''El Molo'''. The remaining few speakers of the language are fighting to keep the language alive. The language and most of the culture has been lost to assimilation from surrounding neighbors. The dialect is on the verge of being extinct. Although, there is still a considerable quantity of preserved vocabulary for the language itself. The original Cushitic-Elmolo can be divided into items of basic vocabulary '''(such as body parts, numerals, names of plants and animals, and kinship terms)'''. Samburu dialect is now spoken in substitute of El Molo, since it is more difficult to extend the use of the only basic vocabulary known. All the Cushitic material lost its original phonology and morphosyntax which has been adapted to Samburu. Meaning, present-day El Molo follows accords to the morphophonemic Samburu “language rules”.

====Samburu====
Samburu is a Maasai language (dialect) of Kenya that can go by alternative names of Burkeneji, E Lokop, Lokop, Nkutuk, Sambur, Sampur.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue: Samburu"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simons|first1=Gary|title=Ethnologue: Samburu|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/18/language/saq/|publisher=SIL International}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the three locations is in Isiolo, Marsabit, and Samburu countries, especially East towards Marasabit which will lead one to Lake Turkana. The distance with between the Samburu and El Molo is why El Molo shifted languages and dialect. Lake Turkana is an area shared between the two communities. Samburu language is used at homes, social gatherings, and for religion. The language can be used for all ages. The population according to the 2009 census is 237,000 and yearly increasing.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue: Samburu"/&gt;

===Attempt at revitalization===
In 1995 the “Elmolo Development Group” (EDG) was established to promote self-reliance among the Elmolo people especially in an attempt for revitalization. In this there also was an Elmolo language revival program that had begun. Founder and chairman, Michael Basili, of the Gura Pau was a teacher and later a schoolmaster and Education Officer of the Loiyangalani Division. He retired in 2006 and this is when he began to attempt to reinstate El Molo as the language of the community through school teaching. Basil and his collogues collected any further linguistic and anthropological data.&lt;ref&gt;FEAR OF EXTINCTION AS THE EL MOLO DROP allAfrica.com, March 12, 2010 NEWS, 2pp database : NewsBank&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts were dropped in 2012 because it was difficult to implement and extend Cushitic lexical material as it was limited, or its knowledge was too unevenly spread among the community to be any help. Another thing discovered was how the El Molo people will not disclose themselves the population of their community. They believe that disclosing their numbers endangers them more since over the years they have been assimilated by their surrounding communities.

====Impacts of language loss====
With the language endangerment of El molo, there is a possibility of a loss of undiscovered and unique knowledge that is still yet to be explored.  Language is also a critical fundamental aspect of communication. It is through language that people can communicate with others of different cultures and gain insight and new knowledge. Dixon states, ''A language is the emblem of its speakers. Each language determines a unique way of viewing the world''.&lt;ref&gt;(Dixon 135)&lt;/ref&gt; Languages expose people to different ideas and different ways of thinking. Someone speaking a different language can describe the same object in a different way and it is this which provides us with a diversity that allows us to view things in other light. Furthermore, naming plants and animals is a universal human activity, but each culture develops its own habits. One thing as minor as name choice can reveal how a culture imagines the proper place for these creatures in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, "When Languages Die"&lt;/ref&gt; The names a language bestows upon animals go beyond mere labels, but rather include a great deal of information about the proper place this community, such as El Molo, view this animal in the world.

* Class I: Free of disabling [[seizures]]
* Class II: Rare disabling seizures ("almost seizure-free")
* Class III: Worthwhile improvement
* Class IV: No worthwhile improvement

==History==

[[Surgery]] for [[epilepsy]] patients has been used for over a century, but due to technological restrictions and insufficient knowledge of [[brain surgery]], this treatment approach was relatively rare until the 1980s and 90s.&lt;ref name="Epilepsy surgery page"&gt;{{cite web|last=Weiner|first=Howard L.|title=Surgery|url=http://www.epilepsy.com/learn/treating-seizures-and-epilepsy/surgery|publisher=Epilepsy Foundation|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the 1980s, no classification system existed due to the lack of operations performed up until the time. As surgery as a treatment grew more prevalent, a classification system became a necessity. The appropriate evaluation of patients following epilepsy surgery is extremely important, as medical professionals must know the appropriate course of action to follow in order to achieve seizure freedom for patients.&lt;ref name="compare engel and ILAE" /&gt;  Accordingly, the Engel classification guidelines were devised by [[UCLA]] neurologist Jerome Engel Jr. in 1987 and made public at the 1992 Palm Desert Conference on Epilepsy Surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Massachusetts General Hospital|title=Engel Epilepsy Surgery Outcome Scale|url=http://www.massgeneral.org/neurology/forPhysicians/epilepsy/pro_EngelEpiSurgOutcomeScale.aspx|publisher=Massachusetts General Hospital|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Passaro"&gt;{{cite web|last=Passaro|first=Erasmo A|title=Outcome of Epilepsy Surgery|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1185416-overview#aw2aab6b3|publisher=Medscape|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Engel classification system has since become the standard in reporting postoperative outcomes of epilepsy surgery.&lt;ref name=isbn0881679887 /&gt;

==Overview==

In Engel's 1993 summary of the 1992 Palm Desert Conference on Epilepsy Surgery, he annotated his classification system with more detail.&lt;ref name=isbn0881679887 /&gt;  The annotation was as follows:

*Class I: Seizure free or no more than a few early, nondisabling seizures; or seizures upon drug withdrawal only
*Class II: Disabling seizures occur rarely during a period of at least 2 years; disabling seizures may have been more frequent soon after surgery; nocturnal seizures
*Class III: Worthwhile improvement; seizure reduction for prolonged periods but less than 2 years
*Class IV: No worthwhile improvement; some reduction, no reduction, or worsening are possible

==Advantages==

The subjectivity of the Engel system leaves much of the postoperative class assignment process to the patients. While many have noted the disadvantages of a classification system where the patients are involved in determining the evaluation, others have praised it.&lt;ref name="compare engel and ILAE" /&gt;  Proponents of the Engel classification guidelines argue that the patients are best able to perceive the worth of the operation because they are the ones experiencing the seizures before and after the treatment.

==Disadvantages==

As is the case for all current methods of reviewing [[epilepsy]] [[surgery]] outcomes, the Engel classification system has [[subjectivity|subjective]] components.&lt;ref name="Passaro"/&gt; A "disabling seizure" is subjective and can vary in definition from person to person. While one epileptic experiencing a seizure when driving a car may find the seizure "disabling," the same magnitude of seizure may be interpreted as mild, and thus "nondisabling," by an epileptic resting in bed. Every class other than class I is also subjective because there is no [[wikt:Special:Search/quantitative#adjective|quantitative]] definition of what determines a rare occurrence or method to measure worthwhileness. One doctor and patient may consider 2 seizures in a year as a rare occurrence while another doctor may consider 10 in a year as rarely occurring. The worthwhileness of the operation is ambiguous because worth can be interpreted differently by various patients and healthcare professionals.&lt;ref name="Johns Hopkins" /&gt; Keeping those caveats in mind, most neurologists and neurosurgeons who specialize in epilepsy would most likely agree, as would many epileptics and even laypeople, that any seizure that leads to a period of [[status epilepticus]] (seizure activity, especially of the tonic-clonic, or grand mal, type, for longer than about five to ten minutes, or more- some now say it should be as little as two- without an intervening return to normal, or any repeat seizures without a return to consciousness) is a medical emergency, objectively a major problem, and cannot be considered a satisfactory outcome (unless perhaps if the person had a fatal or very severe form of a neurodegenerative syndrome or other disease where such severe repeat seizures are not unusual, and there are a number of these diseases; even then, such an outcome is usually still not a cure, just an amelioration of a fatal condition or a very disabling condition). Continuing to have to endure a large number of tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal seizures) over a period of days, months, or even over the course of a year or two, would make it impossible to drive and very hard to hold a job away from home entailing much stress, and would pose limits on one's abilities to safely carry out the activities of daily living without at least some monitoring or assistance.

The Engel classification system has been thought of as a [[cross-sectional study|cross-sectional]] grading system by medical professionals because it does not account for long term changes in patients.&lt;ref name="Johns Hopkins"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yan |first=Chaohua |author2=James Valeriano |author3=Kevin Kelly |author4=Carol Lane |author5=Jack Wilberger |title=Comparison of 2 Classifications of Postoperative Seizure Outcome, Engel vs ILAE Classification, Following Epilepsy Surgery in Adults with Medically Refractory Epilepsy |journal=Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine |date=2009 |url=http://jhasim.com/aanhighlights/cs_set8.cfm |accessdate=3 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407085207/http://jhasim.com/aanhighlights/cs_set8.cfm |archivedate=7 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been proposed that it would be more beneficial to reevaluate patients on an annual basis, and the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) devised a separate rating scale in 2001 that reevaluates patients on every annual anniversary of their surgery.&lt;ref name="compare engel and ILAE"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Durnford|first=Andrew J.|author2=William Rodgers |author3=Fenella J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5666">'''Etienne van Heerden''', born 3 December 1954, is a [[South Africa]]n [[author]].

==Biography==
Van Heerden was born in 1954, six years after the official advent of [[apartheid]]. His mother was an English speaking [[mathematics]] teacher. His father, an [[Afrikaans]] speaking [[merino]] stud breeder, farmed the family farm in the [[Karoo]]. Van Heerden was reared Afrikaans, with English reserved for use at home on Tuesdays, and learned from comics ordered from London.

Due to being born blind in the right eye, he was not called up for combat duty, but served as a dog handler, playing his [[German Shepherd Dog|alsatian]] at major festivals.

Van Heerden initially studied law, and was admitted to the South African Side Bar as attorney. He freelanced as deputy sheriff for the Civil Court, and moved about in the townships around Cape Town, dispensing civil summonses and learning a great deal about life in these suppressed communities. As a young practitioner, his clients were mostly from the black and coloured crime-ridden communities around Cape Town.

Van Heerden also lectured Legal Practice at the Peninsula Technikon and spent two years in advertising.  At age thirty, with the birth of his eldest daughter, Van Heerden left the routine of a budding Cape Town advertising agency.  He and his family relocated to northern [[Natal Province|Natal]] where he started out on his academic career in Literature at the [[University of Zululand]]. His PhD was a study on engagement and postmodernism.

During the 1980s he was member of a group of Afrikaans writers secretly meeting the banned ANC of Mandela and exiled writers at the (now famous) Victoria Falls Writers’ Conference, held in [[Zimbabwe]].

Van Heerden is seen as member of a generation of Afrikaans artists who contributed significantly to opening up the Afrikaner psyche to change.

He regularly teaches at universities in Europe, and has been Writer in Residence at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands, and the University of Antwerp in Belgium. He was a member of the University of Iowa’s prestigious [[International Writing Program]] in 1990, and has been back on visits to this university, of which he is an Honorary Fellow in Writing. He regularly reads his fiction at events such as the Edinburgh Festival in Scotland, the Winter Nights Festival in the Hague, Netherlands, the Time of the Writer Festival in Berlin, Germany, the Zimbabwe Book Fair and other festivals and events internationally.

Despite at times at odds with the apartheid government, van Heerden never left South Africa permanently, and now teaches at the University of Cape Town, where he is the Hofmeyr Professor in the School of Languages and Literatures, and chairs the Afrikaans and Netherlandic Studies Section. His current activities at the University of Cape Town include the supervision of Creative Writing, where he has led a generation of young Afrikaans authors to published status, and the lecturing of courses in Literary Theory, Media Studies, and South African and Dutch Literature.

Van Heerden is married to Kaia, a practising doctor, and lives in [[Stellenbosch]]. The couple has two daughters, Imke and Menán.

Although he lives in the Western Cape, Van Heerden returns, in his writing, to the Karoo of his childhood. He describes this arid and mythological part of South Africa’s deep interior is his own “landscape of the mind”.

He serves on the board of directors of NB Publishers, which includes, amongst others, Kwela, Tafelberg, Best Books and Human and Rousseau publishers.

'''Gabriel Fabrero Fabella''' (March 18, 1898 – January 29, 1982) was a prominent Filipino historian during the 20th century. He is primarily known as the historian behind [[President of the Philippines|Philippine President]] [[Diosdado Macapagal]]'s decision to issue Proclamation No. 28 on May 12, 1962, which changed the date of [[Independence Day (Philippines)|Philippine independence]] from July 4, 1946 to June 12, 1898 — the date when Philippine President [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] proclaimed the country's independence from [[Spain]] in [[Kawit, Cavite|Kawit]], [[Cavite]]. For this achievement, Fabella became known as the "Father of June 12 Independence Day."

Fabella was also the founder and first president of the [[Philippine Historical Association]], the pioneer professional association of historians in the Philippines.

==Early life and education==
Fabella was born in the island municipality of Banton, Romblon on March 18, 1898 to Maximo Fabella, a coconut and tobacco merchant, and Rafaela Fabrero, a housewife. He is 10th among the couple's 13 children. At the time, Banton was an isolated municipality halfway between [[Marinduque]] and the main island of [[Romblon, Romblon|Romblon]]. As such, he and his family grew up in abject poverty. He received elementary education at Banton Primary School and Romblon Intermediate School. To augment his monthly stipend of ₱3 to ₱4 from Banton, Fabella worked as a store helper for a local [[Chinese-Filipino|Filipino-Chinese]] merchant.{{sfn|Fabella|1998|pp=2-5, 13}}{{sfn|Esquejo|2011|p=60}}

For his secondary education, Fabella studied at [[Manila High School (Intramuros)|Manila High School]] in [[Intramuros]], [[Manila]] with the support of his brothers Apolonio and Jorge who already lived there and are working as [[calesa]] drivers.{{sfn|Fabella|1998|p=15}}{{sfn|Esquejo|2011|pp=60-61}} To help his brothers in sending him to school, he sold newspapers every Friday and Saturday and polished shoes at  [[Gates of Intramuros#Parian|Puerta del Parian]]. He also helped his sister-in-law in selling food to calesa drivers in the [[Port Area, Manila|Port Area]]. He finished high school in 1916. Among his high school batchmates include [[Julio Nalundasan]] and [[Carlos P. Romulo]].{{sfn|Fabella|1998|p=21}}{{sfn|Esquejo|2011|p=61}}

Poverty forced Fabella to postpone his plan to pursue his college studies. Instead, he worked as an elementary school teacher at Capiz Intermediate School from June 2016 to March 2017. After saving enough money from his salary, he went back to Manila and enrolled at the [[University of the Philippines|University of the Philippines Manila]]. From 1917 to 1920, he completed three courses in the university: [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA), [[Bachelor of Science|Bachelor of Science in Education]] (BSE) and High School Teachers' Certificate (HSTC). He was the first person from Banton to finish both high school and college and the first to have a triple degree.{{sfn|Fabella|1998|pp=22-23}}{{sfn|Esquejo|2011|p=62}} In 1931, Fabella graduated from UP with a degree in [[Master of Arts|Master of Arts in History]], thus becoming the first person from Banton to have [[postgraduate education]]. In 1934, Fabella completed his [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree at the [[University of Manila]] and passed the [[Philippine Bar Examination]] that same year.{{sfn|Fabella|1998|p=25}}{{sfn|Esquejo|2011|p=62}}&lt;ref name="Yagting"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ugatfaigao.yagting.com/news_view_content.asp?newsid=49|title=Profile: Gabriel F.

==Career==
===As history instructor===
After finishing college, Fabella taught at Romblon High School from 1920 to 1922, and at Tayabas High School in [[Lucena, Quezon|Lucena]], [[Quezon (province)]] from 1922 to 1923.{{sfn|Fabella|1998|pp=26-30}}{{sfn|Esquejo|2011|p=62}} That year, he received an offer from UP Department of History chairperson [[Leandro Fernández (historian)|Dr. Leandro Fernandez]] to become a history instructor at the university. His first teaching service at UP lasted 11 years, serving alongside other prominent Filipino historians like [[Gregorio F. Zaide]], [[Encarnacion Alzona]] and [[Nicolas Zafra]]. Among his notable students include would-be dictator [[Philippine President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]].{{sfn|Esquejo|2011|pp=63-64}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Department of History 1910-1979|work=History Week|publisher=UP College of Arts and Sciences|location=Diliman, Quezon City|date=September 17-20, 1979|pages=4-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

While teaching at UP, he also completed his master's degree in History at the school and his Law degree at the University of Manila. During the same period, he wrote for ''Iwag it Kaanduan'', Romblon's first vernacular newspaper and established his own newspaper ''Bag-ong Iwag'' in 1926. Due to his educational achievements, Fabella was well known in Romblon and was active in various organizations such as Katipunang Bantoanon, Romblomanian Association, Banton Uplift Club and Romblon Youth.{{sfn|Ancheta|1962|p=9, 23}}{{sfn|Esquejo|2011|p=66}}

Following budget cuts brought about by the [[Great Depression]], Fabella was among several instructors let go by the university in 1934.{{sfn|Fabella|1998|p=30-31}}{{sfn|Esquejo|2011|p=63}}

===Political career===
As early as 1922, Fabella showed desire to enter politics to challenge the incumbent Leonardo Festin, who has been assemblyman for the lone seat of Romblon in the National Assembly since 1916.{{sfn|Fabella|1998|p=36}} Following the end of his first teaching service in UP in 1934, Fabella joined the [[Nacionalista Party|Partido Nacionalista Democratico]] and ran against Festin during the [[Philippine general election, 1935|1935 Philippine general elections]]. He won against Festin with a lead of 356 votes despite the lack of funding and campaigning throughout the province for only 24 days.{{sfn|Fabella|1998|pp=50-62}}&lt;ref name="Esquejo"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Kristoffer|last=Esquejo|title=Tunggaliang Festin at Fabella: Ang Halalang 1935 sa Kasaysayang Pampulitika ng Romblon|journal=Daluyan Journal ng Wikang Filipino|year=2011|issue=16|pages=101-118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fabella served as Romblon's assemblyman for three years from November 25, 1935 to August 15, 1938. During that time, he became a member of various committees in the National Assembly, namely Public Instruction, Public Services, Civil Service, Codes, Internal Government, Privileges at Navigation. He also appropriated 80 percent of his [[pork barrel]] to building schools in Romblon, while the remaining 20 percent was appropriated to construction and repair of roads in the province.{{sfn|Fabella|1998|pp=69-72}}{{sfn|Esquejo|2011|p=67}}

Following the end of term in 1938, Fabella didn't seek reelection and returned to teaching instead at the University of the Philippines.{{sfn|Esquejo|2011|p=67}}

==Father of June 12 Independence Day==

The resolution asserts the following:

* The United States celebrates independence day every July 4, the day Americans declared their independence, not 3 September 1783 when Great Britain recognized their liberty;
* If the Philippines celebrates its independence day every July 4, our celebration would be dwarfed by the US celebration;
* June 12 was the most logical date since Filipinos were not actually particular about fixing of dates, what we actually cared for is independence itself; and,
* If the Philippines celebrates common independence day with US, other nations might believe that the Philippines is still a part of United States.

In support of the resolution, Fabella gave public speeches and radio interviews explaining the significance of celebrating June 12 as the country’s independence day. He also wrote the article “Philippine Independence: June 12 or July 4? which was published in the ''Sunday Times Magazine'' in July 1, 1956 and garnered positive responses and support from the people.

The resolution reached Philippine President Diosdado Macapagal, who issued Proclamation No. 28, declaring June 12 as the country's Independence Day. [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] made the proclamation formal with the adoption and passage of Republic Act No. 4166.&lt;ref name="Fabella"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/philippines/the-philippine-star/20120612/283716951444760|title=The story of Gabriel Fabella: Father of Philippine Independence|first=Mark|last=Fabella|date=June 12, 2012|publisher=''[[The Philippine STAR]]''|accessdate=October 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hiligaynon language''', also often referred to by most of its speakers simply as '''Ilonggo''', is an [[Austronesian language family|Austronesian]] [[regional language]] spoken in the [[Philippines]] by about 9.1 million people, mainly in [[Western Visayas]] and [[SOCCSKSARGEN]], most of whom belong to the [[Visayan people|Visayan ethnic group]], mainly the [[Hiligaynon people|Hiligaynons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=hil |title=Hiligaynon |author=Lewis, M. Paul |year=2009 |publisher=http://www.ethnologue.com/ |accessdate=July 23, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717030930/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=hil |archivedate=July 17, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the second-most widely spoken language and a member of the so-named [[Visayan language family]] and is more distantly related to other [[Philippine languages]].

Hiligaynon is mainly concentrated in the regions of [[Western Visayas]] ([[Iloilo]], [[Capiz]], [[Guimaras]], and [[Negros Occidental]]), as well as in [[South Cotabato]], [[Sultan Kudarat]], and [[North Cotabato]] in [[SOCCSKSARGEN]]. It is also spoken in other neighboring provinces, such as [[Antique (province)|Antique]] and [[Aklan]] (also in [[Western Visayas]]), [[Negros Oriental]] in [[Central Visayas]], [[Masbate]] in [[Bicol Region]], [[Romblon]] and [[Palawan]] in [[MIMAROPA]].  It is also spoken as a second language by [[Karay-a language|Kinaray-a]] speakers in Antique, [[Aklanon language|Aklanon/Malaynon]] speakers in Aklan, [[Capiznon]] speakers in Capiz and [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] speakers in Negros Oriental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.admu.edu.ph/offices/mirlab/panublion/islas.html |title=Islas de los Pintados: The Visayan Islands | publisher=[[Ateneo de Manila University]] | accessdate=March 29, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927161432/http://www.admu.edu.ph/offices/mirlab/panublion/islas.html |archivedate=September 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are approximately 9,300,000 people in and out of the Philippines who are native speakers of Hiligaynon and an additional 5,000,000 capable of speaking it with a substantial degree of proficiency.&lt;ref name="Philippine Census 2000"&gt;Philippine Census, 2000. Table 11. Household Population by Ethnicity, Sex and Region: 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The language is also often referred to as ''Ilonggo'' ([[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]]: ''Iloŋgo'') in Iloilo and Negros Occidental. Many speakers outside Iloilo argue, however, that this is an incorrect usage of the word "Ilonggo".  In precise usage, "Ilonggo" should be used only in relation to the ethnolinguistic group of native inhabitants of [[Iloilo]] and the culture associated with native Hiligaynon speakers in the place including their dialect. The disagreement over the usage of "Ilonggo" to refer to the language extends to Philippine language specialists and native laypeople.&lt;ref name="a1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bj-informatique.com/langtrad.php|title=My Working Language Pairs|publisher=http://www.bj-informatique.com/|accessdate=January 3, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206233634/http://www.bj-informatique.com/langtrad.php|archivedate=December 6, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has the one of the largest native language-speaking population of the Philippines despite not being taught and studied formally in schools and universities until 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ulrich Ammon |author2=Norbert Dittmar |author3=Klaus J.

==History==
Historical evidence from observations of early Spanish explorers in the Archipelago shows that the nomenclature used to refer to this language had its origin among the people of the coasts or people of the ''Ilawod'' ("''los [naturales] de la playa''"), whom Loarca called ''Yligueynes'' &lt;ref&gt;Cf.  BLAIR, Emma Helen &amp; ROBERTSON, James Alexander, eds. (1903). The Philippine Islands, 1493–1803. Volume 05 of 55 (1582–1583). Historical introduction and additional notes by Edward Gaylord BOURNE. Cleveland, Ohio: Arthur H. Clark Company. {{ISBN|978-0554259598}}. OCLC 769945704. "Explorations by early navigators, descriptions of the islands and their peoples, their history and records of the Catholic missions, as related in contemporaneous books and manuscripts, showing the political, economic, commercial and religious conditions of those islands from their earliest relations with European nations to the beginning of the nineteenth century.", pp. 120-121.&lt;/ref&gt; (or the more popular term ''Hiligaynon'', also referred to by the Karay-a people as ''"Siná"''). In contrast, the "Kinaray-a" has been used by what the Spanish colonizers called ''Arayas'', which may be a Spanish misconception of the Hiligaynon words ''Iraya'' or ''taga-Iraya'', or the current and more popular version ''Karay-a'' (highlanders - people of ''Iraya''/''highlands'').&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Miguel de Loarca, Relacion de las Yslas Filipinas (Arevalo, June 1582)  in  BLAIR, Emma Helen &amp; ROBERTSON, James Alexander, eds. (1903). The Philippine Islands, 1493–1803.

===Dialects===
Similar to many [[Languages of the Philippines|languages in the Philippines]], very little research on [[dialectology]] has been done on Hiligaynon. Some of the widely recognized varieties of the language are Standard or Urban Hiligaynon ([[Iloilo]] provincial and [[Iloilo City]] variant), simply called "Ilonggo", Bacolodnon Hiligaynon ([[Metro Bacolod]] variant), Negrense Hiligaynon (provincial Negros Occidental variant which is composed of 3 sub-variants: Northern, Central and Southern Negrense Hiligaynon), [[Guimaras]] Hiligaynon, and [[Mindanao]] Hiligaynon. Some native speakers also consider [[Kinaray-a]] (also known as Hiniraya or Antiqueño) and [[Capiznon language|Capiznon]] as dialects of Hiligaynon; however, these have been classified by linguists as separate (Western) Visayan languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=cps|title=Capiznon|author=|date=|website=ethnologue.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203093113/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=cps|archivedate=2013-02-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=krj|title=Kinaray-a|author=|date=|website=ethnologue.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203145249/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=krj|archivedate=2013-02-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Related languages====

According to [[H. Otley Beyer]] and other anthropologists, the term ''Visayan'' was first applied only to the people of Panay and to their settlements eastward in the island of Negros (especially its western portion), and northward in the smaller islands, which now compose the province of Romblon. In fact, at the early part of Spanish colonialization of the Philippines, the Spaniards used the term ''Visayan'' only for these areas. While the people of Cebu, Bohol and Leyte were for a long time known only as Pintados. The name ''Visayan'' was later extended to these other islands because, as several of the early writers state, their languages are closely allied to the Visayan dialect of Panay.&lt;ref&gt;G. Nye Steiger, H. Otley Beyer, Conrado Benitez, ''A History of the Orient'', Oxford: 1929, Ginn and Company, pp. 122-123.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing system==
Hiligaynon is written using the [[Latin script]]. Until the second half of the 20th century, Hiligaynon was widely written largely following Spanish orthographic conventions.  Nowadays there is no officially recognized standard orthography for the language and different writers may follow different conventions. It is common for the newer generation, however, to write the language based on the current orthographic rules of Filipino which is more or less phonemic. A noticeable feature of the Spanish-influenced orthography absent in those writing following Filpino's orthography is the use of "c" and "qu" in representing /k/ (now replaced with "k" in all instances) and the absence of the letter "w" (formerly used "u" in certain instances).

The core alphabet consists of 20 letters used for expressing consonants and vowels in Hiligaynon, each of which comes in an upper case and lower case variety.

===Additional symbols===
The apostrophe {{angbr|'}} and hyphen {{angbr|-}} also appear in Hiligaynon writing, and might be considered separate letters.

The hyphen, in particular, is used medially in some words to indicate the [[glottal stop]] ''san-o ''‘when’ ''gab-e'' ‘evening; night’. It is also used to indicate the point in a word where [[reduplication]] is present: ''adlaw-adlaw'' ‘daily, every day’, from ''adlaw'' ‘day, sun’. However, the use of this means of marking reduplication is not always consistent: ''pispis'' ‘bird’.

Hyphens are also used in words with successive sounds of /g/ and /ŋ/, to separate the letters with the digraph NG. Like in the word ''gin-gaan'' 'was given'; without the hyphen, it would be read as ''gingaan'' /gi.ŋaʔan/ as opposed to /gin.gaʔan.

In addition, some English letters may be used in borrowed words.

==Grammar==

===Determiners===
Hiligaynon has three types of case markers: [[absolutive case|absolutive]], [[ergative case|ergative]], and [[oblique case|oblique]]. These types in turn are divided into personal, that have to do with names of people, and impersonal, that deal with everything else, and further into [[grammatical number|singular]] and plural types, though the plural impersonal case markers are just the singular impersonal case markers + ''mga'' (a contracted spelling for {{IPA|/maŋa/}}), a particle used to denote plurality in Hiligaynon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hiligaynon Reference Grammar |last=Wolfenden |first=Elmer |year=1971 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |location=Hawaii |isbn=0-87022-867-6 |pages=61–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(*)The [[article (grammar)|articles]] ''sing'' and ''sing mga'' means the following noun is [[definiteness|indefinite]], while ''sang'' tells of a definite noun, like the use of ''a'' in English as opposed to ''the'', however, it is not as common in modern speech, being replaced by ''sang''. It appears in conservative translations of the Bible into Hiligaynon and in traditional or formal speech&lt;br&gt;
(**)The plural personal case markers are not used very often and not even by all speakers. Again, this is an example of a case marker that has fallen largely into disuse, but is still occasionally used when speaking a more traditional form of Hiligaynon, using less Spanish loan words.{{clarify|reason=Which determiners are used instead?

The case markers do not determine which noun is the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and which is the [[object (grammar)|object]]; rather, the affix of the verb determines this, though the ''ang''-marked noun is always the topic.

In addition to this, there are two verbal deictics, ''karí'', meaning come to speaker, and ''kadto'', meaning to go yonder.

===Copula===
Hiligaynon lacks the marker of sentence inversion "ay" of Tagalog/Filipino or "hay" of Akeanon.  Instead sentences in SV form (Filipino: ''Di karaniwang anyo'') are written without any marker or copula.

Examples:
	
"Si Maria ay maganda" (Tagalog)&lt;br&gt;
	
"Si Maria matahum/ Si Maria guapa" (Hiligaynon) = "Maria is beautiful."
	
"Maria is beautiful" (English)

There is no direct translation for the English copula "to be" in Hiligaynon. However, the prefixes mangin- and nangin- may be used to mean will be and became, respectively.

Example:
	
Manamì mangín manggaránon.&lt;br&gt;
"It is nice to become rich."

The Spanish copula "estar" (to be) has also become a part of the Hiligaynon lexicon.  Its meaning and pronunciation have changed compared to its Spanish meaning, however.  In Hiligaynon it is pronounced as "istar" and means "to live (in)/location"(Compare with the Hiligaynon word "puyô").

Example:
	
Nagaistar ako sa tabuc suba&lt;br&gt;
"I live in tabuc suba"
"tabuc suba" translates to "other side of the river" and is also a barangay in Jaro, Iloilo.

===Existential===
To indicate the existence of an object, the word ''may'' is used.

Example:

May idô (a)ko&lt;br&gt;
"I have a dog"

===Hiligaynon linkers===

When an adjective modifies a noun, the linker ''nga'' links the two.

Example:

Itom nga ido&lt;br&gt;
Black dog

Sometimes, if the linker is preceded by a word that ends in a vowel, glottal stop or the letter N, it becomes acceptable to contract it into -ng, as in Filipino.  This is often used to make the words sound more poetic or to reduce the number of syllables.  Sometimes the meaning may change as in ''maayo nga aga'' and ''maayong aga''.  The first meaning: (the) good morning; while the other is the greeting for 'good morning'.

The linker ''ka'' is used if a number modifies a noun.

Example:

Anum ka ido&lt;br&gt;
six dogs

===Interrogative words===
The interrogative words of Hiligaynon are as follows: ''diin'', ''san-o'', ''sin-o'', ''nga-a'', ''kamusta'', ''ano'', and ''pila''

''Diin'' means '''where'''.&lt;br&gt;
Example:&lt;br&gt;
Diin ka na subong?&lt;br&gt;
"Where are you now?"

A derivation of ''diin'', tagadiin, is used to inquire the birthplace or hometown of the listener.&lt;br&gt;
Example:&lt;br&gt;
Tagadiin ka?&lt;br&gt;
"Where are you from?"

''San-o'' means '''when'''&lt;br&gt;
Example:&lt;br&gt;
San-o inâ?&lt;br&gt;
"When is that?"

''Sin-o'' means '''who'''&lt;br&gt;
Example:&lt;br&gt;
Sin-o imo abyan?&lt;br&gt;
"Who is your friend?"

''Nga-a'' means '''why'''&lt;br&gt;
Example:&lt;br&gt;
Nga-a indi ka magkadto?&lt;br&gt;
"Why won't you go?"

''Kamusta'' means '''how''', as in "How are you?"&lt;br&gt;
Example:&lt;br&gt;
Kamusta ang tindahan?&lt;br&gt;
"How is the store?"

''Ano'' means '''what'''&lt;br&gt;
Example:&lt;br&gt;
Ano ang imo ginabasa?&lt;br&gt;
"What are you reading?"

A derivative of ''ano'', paano, means '''how''', as in "How do I do that?"&lt;br&gt;
Example:&lt;br&gt;
Paano ko makapulî?&lt;br&gt;
"How can I get home?"

A derivative of ''paano'' is paanoano an archaic phrase which can be compared with kamusta &lt;br&gt;
Example:&lt;br&gt;
Paanoano ikaw?&lt;br&gt;
"How art thou?"

''Pila'' means '''how much/how many'''&lt;br&gt;
Example:&lt;br&gt;
Pila ang maupod sa imo?&lt;br&gt;
"How many are with you?"

A derivative of ''pila'', ikapila, asks the numerical order of the person, as in, "What place were you born in your family?"(first-born, second-born, etc.) This word is notoriously difficult to translate into English, as English has no equivalent.&lt;br&gt;
Example:&lt;br&gt;
Ikapila ka sa inyo pamilya?&lt;br&gt;
"What place were you born into your family?"

A derivative of ''pila'', tagpila, asks the monetary value of something, as in, "How much is this beef?"&lt;br&gt;
Example:&lt;br&gt;
Tagpila ini nga karne sang baka?&lt;br&gt;
"How much is this beef?"

{{See also|Austronesian alignment}}

As it is essential for sentence structure and meaning, focus is a key concept in Hiligaynon and other Philippine languages. In English, in order to emphasize a part of a sentence, variation in intonation is usually employed – the voice is stronger or louder on the part emphasized. For example:

#'''The man''' is stealing rice from the market for his sister.
#The man is stealing '''rice''' from the market for his sister.
#The man is stealing rice from '''the market''' for his sister.
#The man is stealing rice from the market for '''his sister'''.

Furthermore, active and passive grammatical constructions can be used in English to place focus on the actor or object as the subject:

:''The man stole the rice.''  vs. ''The rice was stolen by the man.''

In contrast, sentence focus in Philippine languages is built into the construction by grammatical elements. Focus is marked by verbal affixes and a special particle prior to the noun in focus. Consider the following Hiligaynon translations of the above sentences:

#'''Naga'''kawat '''ang lalaki''' sang bugas sa tinda para sa iya utod.
#'''Gina'''kawat sang lalaki '''ang bugas''' sa tinda para sa iya utod.
#'''Gina'''kawatan sang lalaki sang bugas '''ang tinda''' para sa iya utod.
#'''Gina'''kawatan sang lalaki sang bugas sa tinda '''para sa iya utod'''.

:(''lalaki'' = man; ''kawat'' = to steal; ''bugas'' = rice; ''tinda'' = market; ''sibling'' = utod; ''kamot'' = hand)

===Reduplication===

Hiligaynon, like other Philippine languages, employs [[reduplication]], the repetition of a root or stem of a word or part of a word for grammatical or semantic purposes. Reduplication in Hiligaynon tends to be limited to roots instead of affixes, as the only inflectional or derivational morpheme that seems to reduplicate is &lt;u&gt;-pa-&lt;/u&gt;. Root reduplication suggests 'non-perfectiveness' or 'non-telicity'. Used with [[noun]]s, reduplication of roots indicate particulars which are not fully actualized members of their class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Spitz|first = Walter L.|title = Lost Causes: Morphological Causative Constructions in Two Philippine Languages|url = http://scholarship.rice.edu/handle/1911/19215|date = February 1997|pages = 513|publisher = Digital Scholarship Archive, [[Rice University]]|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111005154531/http://scholarship.rice.edu/handle/1911/19215|archivedate = 2011-10-05|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Note the following examples.

| rowspan="3" valign="top" width="30" | (2) || '''maestra-maestra'''
|-
| teacher-teacher
|-
| ''make-believe teacher''
|}

Reduplication of [[verb]]al roots suggests a process lacking a focus or decisive goal. The following examples describe events which have no apparent end, in the sense of lacking purpose or completion. A lack of seriousness may also be implied. Similarly, reduplication can suggest a background process in the midst of a foreground activity, as shown in (5).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Spitz|first = Walter L.|title = Lost Causes: Morphological Causative Constructions in Two Philippine Languages|url = http://scholarship.rice.edu/handle/1911/19215|date = February 1997|pages = 514|publisher = Digital Scholarship Archive, [[Rice University]]|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111005154531/http://scholarship.rice.edu/handle/1911/19215|archivedate = 2011-10-05|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When used with [[adjective|adjectival]] roots, non-telicity may suggest a gradualness of the quality, such as the comparison in (6). In comparative constructions the final syllables of each occurrence of the reduplicated root are accented. If the stress of the second occurrence is shifted to the first syllable, then the reduplicated root suggests a superlative degree, as in (7). Note that superlatives can also be created through prefixation of &lt;u&gt;pinaka-&lt;/u&gt; to the root, as in &lt;u&gt;pinaka-dakô&lt;/u&gt;. While non-telicity can suggest augmentation, as shown in (7), it can also indicate diminishment as in shown in (9), in contrast with (8) (note the stress contrast). In (8b), &lt;u&gt;maàyoáyo&lt;/u&gt;, accented in the superlative pattern, suggests a trajectory of improvement that has not been fully achieved. In (9b), &lt;u&gt;maàyoayó&lt;/u&gt; suggests a trajectory of decline when accented in the comparative pattern. The reduplicated &lt;u&gt;áyo&lt;/u&gt; implies sub-optimal situations in both cases; full goodness/wellness is not achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Spitz|first = Walter L.|title = Lost Causes: Morphological Causative Constructions in Two Philippine Languages|url = http://scholarship.rice.edu/handle/1911/19215|date = February 1997|pages = 514–515|publisher = Digital Scholarship Archive, [[Rice University]]|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111005154531/http://scholarship.rice.edu/handle/1911/19215|archivedate = 2011-10-05|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consonants {{IPA|[d]}} and {{IPA|[ɾ]}} were once allophones but cannot interchange as in other Philippine languages: ''patawaron'' (to forgive) [from ''patawad'', forgiveness] but not ''patawadon,'' and ''tagadiín'' (from where) [from ''diín'', where] but not ''tagariín''.

===Vowels===

There are three main vowels: {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/ɛ ~ i/}}, and {{IPA|/o ~ ʊ/}}. {{IPA|[i]}} and {{IPA|[ɛ]}} (both spelled '''i''') are [[allophone]]s, with {{IPA|[i]}} in the beginning and middle and sometimes final syllables and {{IPA|[ɛ]}} in final syllables. The vowels {{IPA|[ʊ]}} and {{IPA|[o]}} are also allophones, with {{IPA|[ʊ]}} always being used when it is the beginning of a syllable, and {{IPA|[o]}} always used when it ends a syllable.

==Loanwords==

Hiligaynon has a large number of words that derive from Spanish words including nouns (e.g., ''santo'' from ''santo'', saint), adjectives (e.g., ''berde'' from ''verde'', green), prepositions (e.g., ''antes'' from ''antes'', before), and conjunctions (e.g., ''pero'' from ''pero'', but).  Moreover, Spanish provides the Hiligaynon base for items introduced by Spain, e.g., ''barko'' (''barco'', ship), ''sapatos'' (''zapatos'', shoes), ''kutsilyo'' (''cuchillo'', knife), ''kutsara'' (''cuchara'', spoon), ''tenedor'' (fork), ''plato'' (plate), ''kamiseta'' (''camiseta'', shirt), and ''kambiyo'' (''cambio'', change, as in money).

Spanish verbs used in Hiligaynon often remain unconjugated (have the verb endings -ar, -er or -ir) which in Filipino would almost always be conjugated in the '[[Voseo|vos]]' form,{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} e.g., ''komparar'', ''mandar'', ''pasar'', ''tener'', ''disponer'', ''mantener'', and ''asistir''.

[[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], the [[lingua franca]] of northern India and Pakistan, has two standardised [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]]s: [[Hindi]] and [[Urdu]]. Grammatically differences between the two standards are minor but each uses its own script: Hindi uses [[Devanagari]] while Urdu uses [[Urdu alphabet|an extended form]] of the [[Perso-Arabic script]], typically in the [[Nastaʿlīq script|Nastaʿlīq]] style.

On this grammar page [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] is written in "standard [[oriental studies|orientalist]]" [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] as outlined in {{Harvcoltxt|Masica|1991|p=xv}}. Being "primarily a system of [[transliteration]] from the Indian scripts, [and] based in turn upon [[Sanskrit]]" (cf. [[IAST]]), these are its salient features: [[subscript]] [[dot (diacritic)|dot]]s for [[retroflex consonant]]s; [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]]s for etymologically, contrastively [[long vowel]]s; ''h'' for [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] [[plosive]]s; and [[tilde]]s for [[nasalized vowel]]s.

==Phonology==
{{main|Hindustani phonology}}
The vowels used in Hindustani are the following: {{H:title|/ə/|''a''|dotted=no}}, {{H:title|/äː/|''ā''|dotted=no}}, {{H:title|/ɪ/|''i''|dotted=no}}, {{H:title|/iː/|''ī''|dotted=no}}, {{H:title|/ʊ/|''u''|dotted=no}}, {{H:title|/uː/|''ū''|dotted=no}}, {{H:title|/eː/|''e''|dotted=no}}, {{H:title|/oː/|''o''|dotted=no}}, {{H:title|/ɛː/|''ai''|dotted=no}}, {{H:title|/ɔː/|''au''|dotted=no}}.  Note that the vowels ''a'' ''ai'' ''au'' normally have the pronunciations {{IPA|[ə] [ɛː] [ɔː]}}. [[Consonant]]s are outlined in the table below. Hovering the mouse cursor over them will reveal the appropriate [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] symbol, while in the rest of the article hovering the mouse cursor over {{H:title||underlined}} forms will reveal the appropriate English [[translation]].

==Morphology==

===Nouns===
Hindustani distinguishes two [[grammatical gender|genders]] (masculine and feminine), two noun types ([[count noun|count]] and non-count), two [[grammatical number|numbers]] (singular and plural), and three [[grammatical case|case]]s ([[direct case|direct]], [[oblique case|oblique]], and [[vocative case|vocative]]).&lt;ref name="Kachru"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kachru|first1=Yamuna|title=Hindi|date=2006|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|edition=12th|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Hindi.html?id=ooH5VfLTQEQC|isbn=9789027238122}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|43}} Nouns may be further divided into two classes based on [[declension]], called type-I (marked) and type-II (unmarked). The basic difference between the two categories is that the former has characteristic [[suffix|termination]]s in the direct singular while the latter does not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|pp=262–263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The table below displays the suffix paradigms. A [[hyphen]] symbol (for the marked type-I) denotes change from the original termination to another (for example ''laṛkā'' to ''laṛke'' in the masculine singular oblique), whereas a [[Plus and minus signs|plus]] sign (for the unmarked type-II) denotes an ending which should be added (''seb'' to ''sebõ'' in the masculine plural oblique).

{|class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto;"

|}

The next table of noun [[declension]]s, mostly adapted from {{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=263}}, shows the above suffix paradigms in action. Words: ''laṛkā'' ('boy'), ''kuā̃'' ('[[Water well|well]]'), ''seb'' ('apple'), ''vālid'' ('father'), ''cākū'' ('[[penknife]]'), ''ādmī'' ('man'), ''mitra'' ('friend'), ''laṛkī'' ('girl'), ''ciṛiyā'' ('[[finch]]'), ''kitāb'' ('book'), ''bhāṣā'' ('language'), and ''aurat'' ('woman').

Notes for noun declension:
*{{note|1|1}}This is also the ending used for the vocative masculine singular.
*{{note|2|2}}A small number of marked masculines like kuã̄ display [[nasalization]] of all terminations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{note|3|3}}Some masculines ending in ''ā'' don't change in the direct plural and fall in the unmarked category. i.e. ''vālid'' "father", ''cācā'' "[[uncle]]", ''rājā'' "[[king]]".&lt;ref name="Snell&amp;Weightman1989p24"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{note|4|4}}Unmarked nouns ending in ''ū'' and ''ī'' generally shorten this to ''u'' and ''i'' before the oblique (and vocative) plural termination(s), with the latter also inserting the [[semivowel]] ''y''.&lt;ref name="Snell&amp;Weightman1989p24" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shapiro2003p263"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{note|5|5}}Many feminine [[Sanskrit]] loanwords such as ''bhāṣā'' ('language') and ''mātā'' (mother) end in ''ā'', therefore the ''ā'' is not a reliable indicator of noun gender.&lt;ref name="Snell&amp;Weightman1989p24" /&gt;
*The ''iyā'' ending is also not a reliable indicator of gender or noun type. Some words such as ''pahiyā'' ('wheel') and [[Persian language|Persian]] ''takiyā'' ('pillow') are masculine type-I: ''pahiye'' ('wheels'), ''takiye'' ('pillows'). Feminine loanwords such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''duniyā'' ('world') and [[Sanskrit]] ''kriyā'' ('action') use feminine type-II endings: ''duniyāẽ'' ('worlds'), ''kriyāẽ'' ('actions').
*In Urdu, many Arabic words retain their Arabic plurals.
*[[Persian language|Perso]]-[[Arabic language|Arabic]] [[loanword|loan]]s ending in final unpronounced ''h'' are handled as masculine marked nouns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schmidt|2003|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence ''bacca(h)'' → ''baccā''. The former is the Urdu spelling, the latter the Hindi.
*Some Perso-Arabic loans may use their original [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] and [[plural]] markings. i.e. ''vālid'' "father" → ''vālidain'' "[[parent]]s".

===Adjectives===
[[Adjective]]s may be divided into '''declinable''' and '''indeclinable''' categories.&lt;ref name="Shapiro2003p264"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Declinables are marked, through termination, for the gender, number, case of the nouns they qualify. The set of declinable adjective terminations is similar but greatly simplified in comparison to that of noun terminations —

{|class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto;"

| -''ā''||-''e''
|-
! Fem.
|colspan="2"|-''ī''
|-
! colspan="2"| Indecl.
|colspan="2"|
|}

Indeclinable adjectives are completely invariable, and can end in either [[consonant]]s or [[vowel]]s (including ''ā'' and ''ī ''). A number of declinables display nasalization of all terminations.&lt;ref name="Shapiro2003p264"/&gt; Dir. masc. sg. (''-ā'') is the [[citation form]].

*Examples of declinable adjectives: ''baṛā'' "big", ''choṭā'' "small", ''moṭā'' "fat", ''acchā'' "good", ''burā'' "bad", ''kālā'' "black", ''ṭhaṇḍā'' "cold".
*Examples of indeclinable adjectives: ''xarāb'' "bad", ''sāf'' "clean", ''bhārī'' "heavy", ''murdā'' "dead", ''sundar'' "beautiful", ''pāgal'' "crazy", ''lāl'' "red".

All adjectives can be used either [[Attributive adjective#Attributive.2C predicative.2C absolute.2C and substantive adjectives|attributively, predicatively, or substantively]]. Substantively they are of course declined as nouns rather than adjectives.

''sā'' (~ ''se'' ~ ''sī'') is a suffix for adjectives, modifying or lightening their meaning; giving them an "-ish" or "quite" sense. e.g. ''nīlā'' "blue" → ''nīlā-sā'' "bluish". Its emphasis is rather ambiguous, sometimes enhancing, sometimes toning down, the sense of the adjective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Comparatives and superlatives====
[[Comparative|Comparison]]s are made by using "than" (the [[postposition]] ''se''; [[Hindustani grammar#Postpositions|see below]]), "more" (''aur'', ''zyādā''), and "less" (''kam''). The word for "more" is optional, while "less" is required, so that in the absence of either "more" will be inferred.

{|class="wikitable"
! Hindustani !! Word order !! Meaning
|-
|''Gītā Gautam se lambī hai''||Gita Gautam than tall is||Gita is taller than Gautam
|-
|''Gītā Gautam se aur/zyādā lambī hai''||Gita Gautam than more tall is||Gita is more tall than Gautam
|-
|'' Gītā Gautam jitnī lambī hai''|| Gita Gautam as tall is
||Gita is (just) as tall as Gautam
|-
|''Gītā Gautam se kam lambī hai''||Gita Gautam than less tall is||Gita is less tall than Gautam
|}

In the absence of an object of comparison ("more" of course is now no longer optional):

{|class="wikitable"
! Hindustani !! Word order !! Meaning
|-
|''chokrā zyādā baṛā hai''||The lad more big is||The lad is bigger
|-
|'' chokrā utnā hi lambā hai''|| The lad as just tall is
||The lad is just as big
|-
|''chokrā kam baṛā hai''||The lad less big is||The lad is less big

|-
|'' ''|| ||The just as big lad
|-
|''kam baṛā chokrā''||The less big lad ||The less big lad
|}

[[Superlative]]s are made through comparisons with "all" (''sab''). Comparisons using "least" are rare; it is more common to use an antonym.

{|class="wikitable"

|''kamrā sabse sāf hai''||The room all than clean is||The room is the cleanest

===Numerals===
{{main|Hindustani numerals}}
The numeral systems of several of the Indo-Aryan languages, including Hindustani and [[Nepali language|Nepali]], are typical [[decimal]] systems, but contracted to the extent that nearly every number 1–99 is irregular. The first four [[ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinal numbers]] are also irregular. The suffix ''-vā̃'' marks ordinals beginning at the number five.

{| class=wikitable
|+ 0-5

|-

|-
| three || ''tīn'' || ''tīsrā''
|-
| four || ''chār'' || ''cauthā''
|-
| five || ''pā̃ch'' || ''pā̃chvā̃''
|}

===Postpositions===
The aforementioned [[inflection]]al [[grammatical case|case]] system only goes so far on its own, and rather serves as that upon which is built a system of [[agglutinative]] [[suffix]]es or [[Grammatical particle|particle]]s known as [[postposition]]s, which parallel [[English language|English]]'s [[preposition]]s. It is their use with a noun or verb that necessitates the noun or verb taking the oblique case (though the bare oblique is also minorly used [[adverb]]ially&lt;ref name="Shapiro2003p266"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and it is with them that the locus of grammatical function or "case-marking" then lies. There are seven such one-word primary postpositions:

*''kā'' – [[Genitive case|genitive]] marker; variably declinable in the manner of an adjective. X ''kā/ke/kī'' Y has the sense "X's Y", with ''kā/ke/kī'' agreeing with Y.&lt;ref name="Shapiro2003p264"/&gt;
*''ko'' – marks the indirect [[Object (grammar)|object]] (hence named  "[[dative]] marker"), ''or'', if [[definiteness|definite]], the direct object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ne'' – [[Ergative case|ergative]] marker; applied to [[Subject (grammar)|subject]]s of [[Transitivity (grammatical category)|transitive]] [[Perfective aspect|perfective]] [[verb]]s.
*''se'' – [[Ablative case|ablative]] marker; has a very wide range of uses and meanings:
**"from";  ''dillī se'' "from [[Delhi]]".
**"from, of"; ''{{IAST|tumse ḍarnā}}'' "to fear you".
**"since"; ''itvār se'' "since Sunday".
**"by, with"; [[Instrumental case|instrumental]] marker.
**"by, with, -ly"; [[adverb]]ial marker.
**"than"; for [[comparative]]s.
**a minority of verbs use ''se'' rather than ''ko'' to mark their [[Patient (grammar)|patient]]s.
*''mẽ'' – "in".
*''par'' – "on".
*''tak'' – "until, up to".

Beyond these are a large range of compound postpositions, composed of the genitive primary postposition ''kā'' in the oblique form (''ke'', ''kī'') plus an adverb.

*''kī taraf'' "towards", ''ke andar'' "inside", ''ke āge'' "in front of, ahead of", ''ke ūpar'' "on top of, above", ''ke nīce'' "beneath, below", ''ke pīche'' "behind", ''ke bād'' "after", ''ke bāre mẽ'' "about", ''ke bāhar'' "outside", ''ke liye'' "for", ''ke sāmne'' "facing, opposite", etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|pp=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pronouns===

====Personal====
Hindustani has [[personal pronoun]]s for the first and second persons, while for the third person [[demonstrative]]s are used, which can be categorized [[Deixis|deictically]] as proximate and non-proximate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|pp=264–265}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pronoun]]s distinguish [[Grammatical case|case]]s of [[Direct case|direct]], [[Oblique case|oblique]], and [[dative]]. The lattermost, often called a set of "[[Contraction (grammar)|contracted]]" forms, is in free variation with the oblique case plus dative [[postposition]]. Pronouns do not distinguish [[Grammatical gender|gender]].

Also displayed in the below table are the [[genitive]] pronominal forms to show that the 1st and 2nd pronouns have their own distinctive forms of ''merā'', ''hamārā'',  ''terā'', ''tumhārā'' apart from the regular formula of &lt;small&gt;OBL.&lt;/small&gt; + ''kā''; as well as the [[ergative case|ergative]] pronominal forms to show that the postposition ''ne'' does not straightforwardly suffix the oblique bases: rather than *''mujh ne'' and *''tujh ne'', direct bases are used giving ''mai ne'' and ''tū ne'', and rather than ''in ne'' and ''un ne'', it's ''inhõ ne'' and ''unhõ ne''.

''tū'', ''tum'', and ''āp'' are the three second person pronouns ("you"), constituting a threefold scale of sociolinguistic formality: respectively "intimate", "familiar", and "polite". The "intimate" is grammatically singular while the "familiar" and "polite" are grammatically plural.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2003 265"/&gt; When being referred to in the third person however, only those of the "polite" level of formality are grammatically plural.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following table is adapted from {{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=265}}.

Notes for pronouns:
*Postpositions are treated as [[bound morpheme]]s after pronouns in Hindi, but as separate words in Urdu.&lt;ref name="Schmidt2003p293"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schmidt|2003|p=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The varying forms for the 3rd pn. dir. constitute one of the small number of grammatical differences between Hindi and Urdu. ''yah'' "this" / ''ye'' "these" / ''vah'' "that" / ''ve'' "those" is the ''literary'' set for Hindi while ''ye'' "this, these" / ''vo'' "that, those" is the set for Urdu and ''spoken'' (and also often written) Hindi.
*The above [[Hindustani grammar#Postpositions|section on postpositions]] noted that ''ko'' (the dative case) marks direct objects if [[definiteness|definite]]. As "the most specific thing of all is an individual", persons (or their pronouns) nearly always take the dative case or postposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*it is very common practice to use plural pronouns (and their accompanying conjugation) in polite situations, thus ''tum'' can be used in the second person when referring to one person. Similarly, some speakers prefer plural ''ham'' over singular ''mãĩ''. This is not quite the same as the "[[Pluralis majestatis|royal we]]"; it is rather colloquial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''koī'' and ''kuch'' are [[indefinite pronoun]]s/[[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifier]]s. As pronouns ''koī'' is used for [[Animacy|animate]]s ("someone") and ''kuch'' for inanimates ("something").&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; As quantifiers/adjectives ''koī'' is used for singular [[count noun]]s and ''kuch'' for [[mass noun]]s and plural count nouns. ''koī'' takes the form ''kisī'' in the oblique. The form ''kaī'' "several" is partially a plural equivalent to ''koī''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''kuch'' can also act as an [[adverb]], qualifying an adjective, meaning "rather". ''koī'' preceding a number takes the meaning of "about, approximately". In this usage it does not oblique to ''kisī''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''apnā'' is a (genitive) [[reflexive pronoun]]: "my/your/etc. (own)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using non-reflexive and reflexive together gives emphasis; e.g. ''merā apnā'' "my (very) own".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''xud'', ''āp'', and ''svayam'' are some (direct; non-genitive) others: "my/your/etc.-self".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bases for oblique usage are usually ''apne'' or ''apne āp''. The latter alone can also mean "of one's own accord"; ''āpas mẽ'' means "among/between themselves".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adverbs===
Hindustani has few underived forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schmidt|2003|p=322}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adverb]]s may be derived in ways such as the following —
*Simply obliquing some nouns and adjectives: ''nīcā'' "low" → ''nīce'' "down", ''sīdhā'' "straight" → ''sīdhe'' "straight", ''dhīrā'' "slow" → ''dhīre'' "slowly", ''sawerā'' "morning" → ''sawere'' "in the morning", ''ye taraf'' "this direction" → ''is taraf'' "in this direction", ''kalkattā'' "[[Calcutta]]" → ''kalkatte'' "to Calcutta".
*Nouns using a postposition such as ''se'' "by, with, -ly": ''zor'' "force" → ''zor se'' "forcefully" (lit. "with force"), ''dhyān'' "attention" → ''dhyān se'' "attentively" (lit. "with attention").
*Adjectives using postpositional phrases involving "way, manner": ''acchā'' "good" → ''acchī tarah se'' "well" (lit. "by/in a good way"), ''xās'' "special" → ''xās taur par'' "especially" (lit. "on a special way").
*Verbs in conjunctive form: ''hãs'' "laugh" → ''hãs kar'' "laughingly" (lit. "having laughed"), ''meherbānī kar'' "do kindness" → ''meherbānī kar ke'' "kindly, please" (lit. "having done kindness").&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|pp=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Formative suffixes from Sanskrit or Perso-Arabic in higher registers of Hindi or Urdu. Skt. ''sambhava'' "possible" + ''{{IAST|-taḥ}}'' → ''{{IAST|sambhavataḥ}}'' "possibly; Ar. ''ittifāq'' "chance" + ''-an'' → ''ittifāqan'' "by chance".&lt;ref name="Shapiro2003p266"/&gt;

===Verbs===

====Overview====
The Hindustani [[verb]]al system is largely structured around a combination of [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] and [[Grammatical tense|tense]]/[[Grammatical mood|mood]]. Like the nominal system, the Hindustani verb involves successive layers of (inflectional) elements to the right of the [[Root (linguistics)|lexical base]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Masica|1991|p=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindustani has 3 aspects: [[perfective]], [[habitual]], and [[Continuous and progressive aspects|continuous]], each having overt morphological correlates.&lt;ref name="Shapiro2003p266"/&gt; These are [[participle]] forms, inflecting for [[Grammatical gender|gender]] and [[Grammatical number|number]] by way of a vowel termination, like adjectives.&lt;ref name="Schmidt2003p323"/&gt; The perfective, though displaying a "number of irregularities and morphophonemic adjustments", is the simplest, being just the [[Word stem|verb stem]] followed by the agreement vowel. The habitual forms from the [[imperfective]] participle; verb stem, plus -''t''-, then vowel. The continuous forms [[Periphrasis|periphrastic]]ally through [[compound verb|compound]]ing ([[Hindustani grammar#Compounds|see below]]) with the perfective of ''rahnā'' "to stay".

Derived from ''honā'' "to be" are five [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] forms: [[Present tense|present]], [[Past tense|past]], [[subjunctive]], presumptive, [[contrafactual]] ([[List of acronyms and initialisms: A#AK|aka]] "past conditional"). Used both in basic predicative/existential sentences and as [[Auxiliary verb|verbal auxiliaries]] to aspectual forms, these constitute the basis of tense and mood.

Non-aspectual forms include the [[infinitive]], the [[Imperative mood|imperative]], and the [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunctive]]. Mentioned morphological conditions such the subjunctive, "presumptive", etc. are applicable to both copula roots for auxiliary usage with aspectual forms ''and'' to non-copula roots directly for often unspecified (non-aspectual) [[Finite verb|finite]] forms.

[[Finite verb]]al [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] is with the nominative [[Subject (grammar)|subject]], except in the ''[[Transitive verb|transitive]] perfective'', where it is with the [[direct object]], with the erstwhile subject taking the [[ergative case|ergative]] construction ''-ne'' (see [[Hindustani grammar#Postpositions|postpositions]] above). The perfective aspect thus displays [[split ergativity]].

Tabled below on the left are the paradigms for adjectival [[Agreement (linguistics)|concord]] (&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;), here only slightly different from that introduced [[Hindustani grammar#Adjectives|previously]]: the f. pl. can nasalize under certain conditions. To the right are the paradigms for [[Grammatical person|personal]] concord (&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;), used by the subjunctive.

'''Notes'''
*Much of the above chart information derives from {{Harvcoltxt|Masica|1991|pp=292–294, 323–325}}.
*The future tense is formed by adding the suffix ''gā'' (~ ''ge'' ~ ''gī'') to the subjunctive, which is a contraction of ''gaā'' (= ''gayā'', perfective participle of ''jānā'' "to go").&lt;ref name="Schmidt2003p323"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schmidt|2003|p=323}}&lt;/ref&gt; The future suffix, conjunctive participle, and suffix ''vālā'' are treated as bound morphemes in written Hindi, but as separate words in written Urdu.&lt;ref name="Schmidt2003p293"/&gt; 
*{{note|10}}The present copula ({{mono|h-?}}) seems not to follow along the lines of the regular &lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt; system of terminations; while the subjunctive copula ({{mono|ho-&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;}}) is thoroughly irregular. So here are all of their forms.

*For the 1. subj. sg. copula {{Harvcoltxt|Schmidt|2003|pp=324}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|pp=113, 125}} list ''hū̃'' while {{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=267}} lists ''hoū̃''.
*{{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=268}} lists the polite imperative ending as ''-iye'', while {{Harvcoltxt|Schmidt|2003|p=330}} lists it as ''-ie'' but ''-iye'' after ''ā, o, ū''.
*The euphonic [[Semivowel|glide]] ''y'' is inserted in perfective participles between prohibited [[vowel cluster]]s. It is historically the remnant of the old perfective marker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schmidt|2003|pp=324}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clusters are ''a + ā'', ''ā + ā'', ''o + ā'', and ''ī + ā'', resulting in ''āyā'', ''ayā'', ''oyā'', ''iyā''.&lt;ref name="Schmidt2003p328"/&gt; e.g. ''khā'''y'''ā/khā'''y'''e/khāī/khāī̃'' (''khā''- "eat").
*In addition, the combinations ''ī + ī'' and ''i + ī'' give ''ī''.&lt;ref name="Schmidt2003p328"/&gt; e.g. ''piyā/piye/p'''ī'''/p'''ī̃''''' (''pī-'' "drink").
*As stated, agreement in the transitive perfective is with the direct object, with the erstwhile subject taking the ergative postposition ''ne''. If however the direct object takes the postposition ''ko'' (marking [[definiteness]]), or if no direct object is expressed, then agreement neutralizes to default m. sg. ''-ā''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Is this regard, there are a small number of verbs that while perhaps logically transitive still do not take ''ne'' and continue to agree with the subject, in the perfective. e.g. ''lānā'' "to bring", ''bhūlnā'' "to forget", ''milnā'' "to meet", etc.
&lt;!--- perhaps Ergative points belong to Syntax
also discuss: forms both intransitive/transitive
---&gt;
*Besides supplying the copulas, ''honā'' "to be" can be used aspectually: ''huā'' "happened, became"; ''hotā'' "happens, becomes, is"; ''ho rahā'' "happening, being".
*''-ke'' can be used as a colloquial alternative to ''-kar'' for the conjunctive participle of any verb.  But for ''karnā'' it is the only possible form; ''karke'', not *''karkar''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Hindustani displays a very small number of irregular forms, spelled out in the cells below.

*{{note|7}} However, it is ''jā-'' that is used as the perfective stem in the rare instance of an intransitive verb like ''jānā'' being expressed passively, such as in a passivized imperative/subjunctive construction: ''ghar jāyā jāe?'' "Shall [we] go home?" (lit. "Shall home be gone to [by us]?").&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Causatives====
Transitives or [[causative]]s are morphologically contrastive in Hindustani, leading to the existence of related verb sets divisible along such lines. While the derivation of such forms shows patterns, they do reach a level of variegation so as to make it somewhat difficult to outline all-encompassing rules. Furthermore, some sets may have as many as four to five distinct members; also, the meaning of certain members of given sets may be idiosyncratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting from intransitive or transitive verb stems further transitive/causative stems are produced according to these assorted rules —
:1a. Root vowel change: ''a'' → ''ā'', ''u/ū'' → ''o'', ''i/ī'' → ''e''. Sometimes accompanied by root final consonant change: ''k'' → ''c'', ''{{IAST|ṭ}}'' → ''{{IAST|ṛ}}'', ''l'' → ''Ø''.
:1b. Suffixation of ''-ā''. Often accompanied by:
::Root vowel change: ''ū/o'' → ''u'', ''e/ai/ā/ī'' → ''i''.
::Insertion of [[semivowel]] ''l'' between such vowel-terminating stems.
:2. Suffixation of ''-vā'' (in place of ''-ā'' if and where it'd occur) for a "causative".

The majority of the following are sets culled from {{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=270}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|pp=243–244}}. The lack of third members displayed for the ''ghūmnā'' to ''dhulnā'' sets does not imply that they do not exist but that they were simply not listed in the source literature {{Harvcol|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=243}}. Intransitive verbs are coloured &lt;span style="color:brown;"&gt;brown&lt;/span&gt; while transitives remain the usual black.

*&lt;span style="color:brown;"&gt;''girnā''&lt;/span&gt; "to fall", ''girānā'' "to fell", ''girvānā'' "to cause to be felled".
*&lt;span style="color:brown;"&gt;''banna''&lt;/span&gt; "to become", ''banānā'' "to make", ''banvānā'' "to cause to be made".
*&lt;span style="color:brown;"&gt;''khulnā''&lt;/span&gt; "to open", ''kholnā'' "to open", ''khulvānā'' "to cause to be opened".
*''sīkhnā'' "to learn", ''sikhānā'' "to teach", ''sikhvānā'' "to cause to be taught".
*''khānā'' "to eat", ''khilānā'' "to feed", ''khilvānā'' "to cause to be fed".
*&lt;span style="color:brown;"&gt;''biknā''&lt;/span&gt; "to sell", ''becnā'' "to sell", ''bikvānā'' "to cause to be sold".
*&lt;span style="color:brown;"&gt;''dikhnā/dīkhnā''&lt;/span&gt; "to seem", ''dekhnā'' "to see", ''dikhānā'' "to show", ''dikhvānā'' "to cause to be shown".
*''kahnā'' "to say", &lt;span style="color:brown;"&gt;''kahlānā''&lt;/span&gt; "to be called".
*&lt;span style="color:brown;"&gt;''ghūmnā''&lt;/span&gt; "to go round", ''ghumānā'' "to make go round".
*&lt;span style="color:brown;"&gt;''{{IAST|leṭnā}}''&lt;/span&gt; "to lie down", ''{{IAST|liṭānā}}'' "to lay down".
*&lt;span style="color:brown;"&gt;''{{IAST|baiṭhnā}}''&lt;/span&gt; "to sit", ''{{IAST|biṭhānā}}'' "to seat".
*&lt;span style="color:brown;"&gt;''sonā''&lt;/span&gt; "to sleep", ''sulānā'' "to make sleep".
*&lt;span style="color:brown;"&gt;''dhulnā''&lt;/span&gt; "to wash", ''dhonā'' "to wash".
*&lt;span style="color:brown;"&gt;''{{IAST|ṭūṭnā}}''&lt;/span&gt; "to break", ''{{IAST|toṛnā}}'' "to break", ''{{IAST|tuṛānā}}'' "to cause to be broken".

In the causative model of "to cause to be Xed", the agent takes the postposition ''se''. Thus ''Y se Z banvānā'' "to cause Z to be made by Y" = "to cause Y to make Z" = "to have Z made by Y" = "to have Y make Z", etc.
&lt;!---Need to add those that change from a to A. Also bolnA/bulAnA/bulvAnA. Change "The following are sets..." to "The majority of the following are sets...".---&gt;

====Compounds====
&lt;!---
Straight from Shapiro
270:
degree of productivity. Considerable attention has been paid by scholars to determining the {{sic|semnatic}} properties contributed by the election of particle V2 verbs for use in particular compounds. In many cases the meaning contributed by V2 element bears scant resemblance to the literal meaning of the V2 element when it occurs as an independent verb. Thus for example, it is not possible to explain the semantic difference between uThnA "to rise, get up" and uTh baiThnA "to get up suddenly, to spring up" in terms of the semantics of baiThnA "to sit down".
---&gt;
[[Compound verb]]s, a highly visible feature of Hindi–Urdu grammar, consist of a verbal stem plus an [[auxiliary verb]]. The auxiliary (variously called "subsidiary", "explicator verb", and "vector"&lt;ref name="Shapiro2003p269"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;) loses its own independent meaning and instead "lends a certain shade of meaning"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the main or stem verb, which "comprises the lexical core of the compound".&lt;ref name="Shapiro2003p269"/&gt; While almost any verb can act as a main verb, there is a limited set of productive auxiliaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|pp=269–270}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shown below are prominent such auxiliaries, with their independent meaning first outlined, followed by their semantic contribution as auxiliaries.

*''jānā'' "to go"; gives a sense of completeness, finality, or change of state. e.g. ''ānā'' "to come" → ''ā jānā'' "to come, arrive"; ''khānā'' "to eat" → ''khā jānā'' "to eat up"; ''pīnā'' "to drink" → ''pī jānā'' "to drink up"; ''{{IAST|baiṭhnā}}'' "to sit" → ''{{IAST|baiṭh jānā}}'' "to sit down"; ''samajhnā'' "to understand" → ''samajh jānā'' "to realise"; ''sonā'' "to sleep" → ''so jānā'' "to go to sleep"; ''honā'' "to be" → ''ho jānā'' "to become".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|pp=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''lenā'' "to take"; suggests that the benefit of the action flows towards the doer. e.g. ''{{IAST|paṛh lenā}}'' "to read (to/for oneself)".&lt;ref name="Snell&amp;Weightman1989p156"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|pp=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''denā'' "to give"; suggests that the benefit of the action flows away from the doer. e.g. ''{{IAST|paṛh denā}}'' "to read (out)".&lt;ref name="Snell&amp;Weightman1989p156"/&gt;

The above three are the most common of auxiliaries, and the "least marked", or "lexically nearly colourless".&lt;ref name="Schmidt2003p337"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schmidt|2003|pp=337}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nuance conveyed by an auxiliary can often be very subtle, and need not always be expressed with different words in English translation. ''lenā'' and ''denā'', transitive verbs, occur with transitives, while intransitive ''jānā'' occurs mostly with intransitives; a compound of a transitive and ''jānā'' will be grammatically intransitive as ''jānā'' is.

*''{{IAST|ḍālnā}}'' "to throw, pour"; indicates an action done vigorously, decisively, violently or recklessly;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is an intensifier, showing intensity, urgency, completeness, or violence.&lt;ref name="Schmidt2003p338"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schmidt|2003|p=338}}&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. ''mārnā'' "to strike" → ''{{IAST|mār ḍālnā}}'' "to kill", ''pīnā'' "to drink" → ''{{IAST|pī ḍālnā}}'' "to drink down".
*''{{IAST|baiṭhnā}}'' "to sit"; implies an action done foolishly or stubbornly;&lt;ref name="Snell&amp;Weightman1989p221"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows speaker disapproval or an impulsive or involuntary action.&lt;ref name="Schmidt2003p338"/&gt; ''kahnā'' "to say" → ''{{IAST|kah baiṭhnā}}'' "to blurt out", ''karnā'' "to do" → ''{{IAST|kar baiṭhnā}}'' "to do (as a blunder)", ''{{IAST|laṛnā}}'' "to fight" → ''{{IAST|laṛ baiṭhnā}}'' "to quarrel (foolishly)".
*''{{IAST|paṛnā}}'' "to fall"; connotes involuntary, sudden, or unavoidable occurrence;&lt;ref name="Schmidt2003p337"/&gt; adds a sense of suddenness or change of state, with its independent/literal meaning sometimes showing through in a sense of downward movement.&lt;ref name="Snell&amp;Weightman1989p221"/&gt;
*''{{IAST|uṭhnā}}'' "to rise"; functions like an intensifier;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schmidt|2003|pp=337–338}}&lt;/ref&gt;  suggests inception of action or feeling, with its independent/literal meaning sometimes showing through in a sense of upward movement. e.g. ''jalnā'' "to burn" → ''{{IAST|jal uṭhnā}}'' "to burst into flames", ''nacnā'' "to dance" → ''{{IAST|nac uṭhnā}}'' "to break into dance".&lt;ref name="Snell&amp;Weightman1989p221"/&gt;
*''rakhnā'' "to keep, maintain"; implies a firmness of action, or one with possibly long-lasting results or implications;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Snell|Weightman|1989|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; occurs with ''lenā'' and ''denā'', meaning "to give/take (as a loan)", and with other appropriate verbs, showing an action performed beforehand.&lt;ref name="Schmidt2003p338"/&gt;
*The continuous aspect marker ''rahā'' apparently originated as a compound verb with ''rahnā'' ("remain"):  thus ''mãĩ bol rahā hū̃'' = "I have remained speaking" → "I have continued speaking" → "I am speaking".  However it has lost the ability to take any form other than the perfective, and is thus considered to have become grammaticalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Masica|1991|pp=329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, having to do with the ''manner'' of an occurrence, compounds verbs are mostly used with completed actions and imperatives, and much less with negatives, conjunctives, and contexts continuous or speculative. This is because non-occurrences cannot be described to have occurred in a particular manner.&lt;ref name="Snell&amp;Weightman1989p156"/&gt;

Another notable aspect of Hindi–Urdu grammar is that of "conjunct verbs", composed of a [[noun]] or [[adjective]] paired up with a general verbalizer, most commonly transitive ''karnā'' "to do" or intransitive ''honā'' "to be(come)", functioning in the place of what in [[English language|English]] would be single unified verb.

In the case of an adjective as the non-verbal element, it is often helps to think of ''karnā'' "to do" as supplementally having the senses of "to cause to be", "to make", "to render", etc.

{|class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
! Adjective !! Conjunct !! Literal !! Meaning
|-
|''sāf'' clean||''sāf karnā''||to do clean||to clean
|-
|''niyukt/muqarrar'' appointed||''niyukt/muqarrar karnā''||to do appointed||to appoint
|-
|''band'' closed||''band honā''||to become closed||to close
|-
|''xatm'' finished||''xatm honā''||to become finished||to finish
|}

In the case of a noun as the non-verbal element, it is treated syntactically as the verb's (direct) object (never taking the ''ko'' marker; governing agreement in perfective and infinitival constructions), and the semantic [[Patient (grammar)|patient]] (or [[Agent (grammar)|agent]]: see ''gālī khānā'' below) of the conjunct verbal expression is often expressed/marked syntactically as a genitive adjunct (''-kā'' ~ ''ke'' ~ ''kī'') of the noun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masica|1991|p=368}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---more on Masica 368 about "true conjuncts": ko shuru (n.) karnA, etc.---&gt;

{|class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
! Noun !! Conjunct !! Conjunct + patient !! Literal !! Meaning
|-
|''intizār'' wait||''intizār karnā''||''kisī kā intizār karnā''||to do somebody's wait||to wait for somebody
|-
|''istemāl'' use||''istemāl karnā''||''fon kā istemāl karnā''||to do a phone's use||to use a phone
|-
|''bāt'' talk||''bāt karnā''||''Samīr kī bāt karnā''||to do Sameer's talk||to talk about Sameer
|-
|''{{IAST|pratiṣṭhā}}'' installation||''{{IAST|pratiṣṭhānkarnā}}''||''{{IAST|mūrti/but kī pratiṣṭhā karnā}}''||to do an idol's installation||to install an idol
|-
|''gālī'' curse||''gālī khānā''||''sanam kī gālī khānā''||to eat a lover's curse||to be cursed out by one's lover
|-
|''tasvīr'' picture||''tasvīr khīṅcnā/khicvānā''||''Ibrahim ki tasvīr khīṅcnā/khicvānā ''||to pull Ibrahim's picture||to take Ibrahim's picture
|}

With [[English language|English]] it is the verb stems themselves that are used.

{|class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
! Verb stem !! Conjunct !! Meaning
|-
|''cek'' check||''cek karnā''||to check
|-
|''bor'' bore||''bor honā''||to be bored
|}

====Passive====
The [[Grammatical voice|passive]] construction is [[Periphrasis|periphrastic]]. It is formed from the perfective participle by addition of the auxiliary ''jānā'' "to go"; i.e. ''likhnā'' "to write" → ''likhā jānā'' "to be written". The agent is marked by the postposition ''se''. Furthermore, both intransitive and transitive verbs may be grammatically passivized to show physical/psychological incapacity, usually in negative sentences. Lastly, intransitives often have a passive sense, or convey unintentional action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Schmidt|2003|p=331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syntax==
With regards to [[word order]], Hindustani is an [[subject–object–verb|SOV]] language. In terms of [[Branching (linguistics)|branching]], it is neither purely left- or right-branching, and phenomena of both types can be found. The order of constituents in sentences as a whole lacks governing "hard and fast rules", and frequent deviations can be found from normative word position, describable in terms of a small number of rules, accounting for facts beyond the pale of the label of "SOV".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Shapiro|2003|p=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Indirect objects precede direct objects.
# Attributive adjectives precede the noun they qualify.
# Adverbs precede the adjectives they qualify.
# Negative markers (''nahī̃, na, mat'') and interrogatives precede the verb.
# Interrogatives precede negative markers if both are present.
# ''kyā'' ("what?") as the [[yes-no question]] marker occurs at the ''beginning'' of a clause.

===Possession===
Possession, reflecting what many other languages indicate via the verb ''to have'', is reflected in Hindustani by the genitive ''kā'' (inflected appropriately) or the postposition ''ke pās'' ("near") and the verb ''honā''. Possible objects of possession (nouns) fall into two main categories in Hindustani: one for persons such as family members, or body parts, and the other for most inanimate objects, animals, most abstract ideas, and some persons such as servants.

* For indicating possession with objects of the first category, ''kā'' appears after the subject of the possession, followed by the object. With personal pronouns, this requires the use of the possessive pronoun (inflected appropriately). Examples: ''Merī mātā hai'' ("I have a mother"), ''Śiv kī tīn ā̃khẽ haĩ'' ("Shiva has three eyes").
* For indicating possession with objects of the second category, the compound postposition ''ke pās'' ("near") is used. For example: ''Mohan ke pās ek bakarī hai'' ("Mohan has a goat", but also "There is a goat near Mohan").

The '''Ijaw''' '''languages''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|dʒ|ɔː}}),&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student's Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; also spelt '''''Ịjọ''''',&lt;ref&gt;generally pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|dʒ|oʊ}} in English&lt;/ref&gt; are the languages spoken by the [[Ijo people]] in southern [[Nigeria]]. 

== Classification ==
The Ijo languages are traditionally considered a distinct branch of the [[Niger–Congo family]] (perhaps along with [[Defaka language|Defaka]] in a group called [[Ijoid languages|Ijoid]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=toYtBEKYtCMC|title=A Grammar of the Kolokuma Dialect of Ịjọ|last=Williamson|first=Kay|date=2011-08-11|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521175265|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are notable for their [[subject–object–verb]] basic word order, which is otherwise an unusual feature in Niger–Congo, shared only by such distant potential branches as [[Mande languages|Mande]] and [[Dogon languages|Dogon]]. Like Mande and Dogon, Ijoid lacks even traces of the [[noun class]] system considered characteristic of Niger–Congo. This motivated [[Joseph Greenberg]], in his initial classification of Niger–Congo, to describe them as having split early from that family. However, owing to the lack of these features, Linguist Gerrit Dimmendaal doubts their inclusion in Niger–Congo altogether and considers the Ijoid languages to be an independent family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0U4k9duWUOIC|title=Historical Linguistics and the Comparative Study of African Languages|last=Dimmendaal|first=Gerrit Jan|date=2011-01-01|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=9027211787|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following internal classification is based on Jenewari (1989) and Williamson &amp; Blench (2000).

*East
**[[Nkoroo language|Nkoroo]]
**[[Kalabari language|Kalabari]] (Bonny/Ibani, Okrika/Kirike)
**[[Southeast Ijo]]
***Nembe
***Akassa
*West (or Central)
**[[Izon language|Izon]]
**Inland Ijo
***[[Biseni language|Biseni]]
***[[Akita language|Akita]] (Okordia)
***[[Oruma language|Oruma]]

== In the diaspora ==
[[Berbice Creole Dutch]], a creole spoken in [[Guyana]], had a lexicon based partly on an Ịjọ language, perhaps the ancestor of [[Kalabari language|Kalabari]] (Kouwenberg 1994).

==Usage and teaching==
In June 2013, the ''Izon Fie'' instructional book and audio CDs were launched at a ceremony attended by officials of the government of [[Bayelsa State]]. The [[Niger Delta University]] is working to expand the range of books available in the Ijo language. Translations of poetry and the ''Call of the River Nun'' by [[Gabriel Okara]] are underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

An '''inkwell''' is a small jar or container, often made of [[glass]], [[porcelain]], [[silver]], [[brass]], or [[pewter]], used for holding [[ink]] in a place convenient for the person who is writing. The artist or writer dips the brush, [[quill]], or [[dip pen]] into the inkwell as needed or uses the inkwell as the source for filling the reservoir of a [[fountain pen]]. An inkwell usually has a lid to prevent contamination, evaporation, accidental spillage, and excessive exposure to air. A type known as the '''travelling inkwell''' was fitted with a secure, screw lid so a traveller could carry a supply of ink in their luggage without the risk of leakage.
==Origins==
The inkwell's origins may be traced back to Ancient Egypt where [[scribes]] would write on [[papyrus]].  Knowledge of [[hieroglyphics]] was at the time highly restricted.  Only scribes knew the full array of hieroglyphs and would write on the behalf of their employers, usually the [[pharaoh]].  After Rome invaded Egypt, inkwells became more popular in Italy as a larger percentage of the population were capable of writing.&lt;ref&gt;Shanks, H. (2002). Scrolls, Scripts &amp; Stelae. Biblical Archaeology Review, 28(5), 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inkwells gradually fell out of use in the early part of 20th century{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} as the reservoir fountain pen (which needs to be filled only occasionally) replaced the dip pen, which needed to be dipped in ink after writing a few lines. Old school desks had round holes for inkwells.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rblandmark.com/News/Articles/10-16-2007/Schooling-since-1913/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Interlac Landscape.JPG|thumb|right|400px|Interlac font table]]

'''Interlac''' is the designated communication language of the 30th century United Planets in the [[DC Universe|DC Comics fictional universe]]. It is also the name of a similarly-used language in the TV series ''[[Babylon 5]]''.
 
==DC Universe==
Basically, the Interlac alphabet is a simple one-to-one [[substitution cipher]].  The Interlac alphabet corresponds perfectly to the twenty-six letters of the [[Latin alphabet]] and the numbering system corresponds to Earth [[decimal|Base-Ten]] form. Although nominally protected by differences in font spacing, the numbering system itself suffers from a minor stylistic flaw due to the potential for confusion of 6 with 41 and 7 with 42. Anyone writing it by hand could certainly introduce an error when read by another, and this could create problems with handwriting recognition, as well.

{{cquote|As the official U.P. language, Interlac is taught in schools throughout the system and is the common form of communication between most sentient United Planet races." (After ''Who's Who in the Legion of Super-Heroes'' #1 - DC Comics 1988)}}

The first reference to Interlac as the "intergalactic universal language of the 30th century" was in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #379 published March, 1969. It was also frequently referred to in the ''Super Friends'' comic book series (in which all of the Super Friends, including Wendy and Marvin, speak it) as a token explanation of how the Super Friends could understand the language of visiting and/or invading extraterrestrials. The Interlac alphabet was codified years later by writer [[Paul Levitz]] and artist [[Keith Giffen]]  in ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' (vol. 2) #312 (June 1984).

After the DC Comics reboot, the new ''[[Blue Beetle]]'' title points out that a planet that is under attack by The Reach is speaking in Interlac. This planet is in Space Sector 2, and these events take place an undefined time ago, though described as "Long, long ago." and images of Earth show a [[Maya peoples|Mayan]] tribe. Contradictory to the statement that the aliens seen are speaking Interlac is the text that can be seen on the signs in the background of the panels. These symbols do not match up to the Interlac alphabet. This may be due to the text being in their native language or a different written dialect as some symbols are similar.

===Recent usage===
Towards the start of "The Martian Chronicles" (Episode 11 of Season 2 of ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]''), Interlac makes a cameo appearance via graffiti seen on a for-aliens bar when employee M'gann exits to take the trash out.  Appropriately, the tag is simply "bar". In "Wake Up" (Episode 7 of Season 3), the control panel of an alien hibernation device is written in Interlac, displaying such words as "Ready", "Normal", and "Danger".

In the "[[Lightning Saga]]" crossover in ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' (vol. 2) and ''[[Justice Society of America]]'' (vol. 2) Interlac is spoken by the character [[Thom Kallor|Starman]] and others as a trigger. They say "Lightning Lad" in Interlac, freeing other Legion members from the mental blocks that have been put in place.

The individual chapter titles are also printed in Interlac:
* Chapter 1 "Lightning Lad"
* Chapter 2 "Dreams and Fire"

Interlac is also shown to be the language in which the [[Guardians of the Universe]] write the [[Book of Oa]].

Shown to have been used thousands of years ago in Space Sector 2, according to ''Blue Beetle'' issue 1, of the New DC Universe.

==Babylon 5==
In the universe of the TV series ''[[Babylon 5]]'', '''Interlac''' is a universal language most often used in first contact situations because it is easily translated. It is easily translated because it is a language based on pure mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-5898&amp;query=Legion%20of%20Superheroes JMSNews]&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, it is normally used only in first contact situations until such a time as a more common understanding between two new species becomes available. Unlike the DC Comics "Interlac", the common trade language in the Babylon 5 universe is English.

'''Ishwar Chandra Gupta''' ({{lang-bn|ঈশ্বরচন্দ্র গুপ্ত}}; March 1812 – 23 January 1859) was a famous [[India]]n [[Bengali people|Bengali]] poet and writer. Gupta was born in [[Kanchrapara]], [[North 24 Parganas]], [[West Bengal]], [[India]].&lt;ref name="bp"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kahaly |first=Anirudha |year=2012 |chapter=Gupta, Ishwar Chandra |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Gupta,_Ishwar_Chandra |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Ishwar Chandra Gupta was born in a [[Baidya]] family. He was brought up in his uncle's house after the death of his mother. Gupta spent most of his childhood in [[Kolkata]]. At that time, poets were named ''Kobiwala'' and the ''kobiwalas'' were not so civilized in language. Sexual words and clashes were common. But Ishwar Chandra Gupta created a different style of poetry.

He started the newspaper ''[[Sambad Prabhakar]]'' with Jogendra Mohan Tagore on January 28, 1831,&lt;ref name="bp" /&gt; which finally became a daily on June 4, 1839. Many Bengali writers of the 19th century started their careers with that magazine. He reintroduced into Bengali poetry the mediaeval style with double meaning (already seen in Sandhyakaranandi and Bharatchandra):
::''কে বলে ঈশ্বর গুপ্ত, ব্যপ্ত চরাচর,''
::''যাহার প্রভায় প্রভা পায় প্রভাকর।''

::''Ke bole Ishwar Gupta, byapta charachar,''
::''Jahar prabhaye prabha paye Prabhakar.''.

'Ishwar' means God, 'Gupta' means hidden and 'Prabhakar' is the sun. So a translation runs:

::Who says God is hidden? He is omnipresent
::From Him the Sun gets its luminescence.

Also, Ishwar (Chandra) Gupta ran the journal ''Prabhakar''.  So a second meaning of the poem, making a tongue-in-cheek reference to the author, runs:

::Who says Ishwar (Gupta) is hidden? His reach touches the world
::For his brilliance makes the ''Prabhakar'' luminescent.

==Literary style==
He brought modern era of poetry in [[Bengali language|Bengali]]. He did not describe the life of Gods and Goddesses, but the daily life of human beings. He also wrote biographies of many Bengali poets and musicians.

Ishwarchandra Gupta always satires the so-called modern class who blindly followed the colonial British power.

::Tumi ma kalpataru
::Amra shob posha goru
::Shikhi ni shing bankano
::Khai kebol khol-bichuli-ghash
::Jano ranga amla
::::Tule mamla
::::::Na bhange gamla
::Ma!
::Pele bhushi
::::Tatei kushi
::::::Ghushi khele bachbo na!

His literary works were included in the curriculum of school level, secondary and higher secondary [[Bengali Literature]] in Bengali speaking states like West Bengal, Tripura etc. of India and country [[Bangladesh]].

== Political views ==
In the early days he was a conservative, opposing the [[Young Bengal]] movement as well as frowning on widow remarriage. His views on widow remarriage put him at odds with [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]]. He was one of the earliest advocates of a Hindu view of Indian society. Later in his life, his views began to change and he championed the cause for the remarriage of virgin widows and women's education.&lt;ref name="bp" /&gt;

*Kobitabolir Saar Sangraha

'''Kalabari''' is an [[Ijo language]] of [[Nigeria]] spoken in [[Rivers State]] and [[Bayelsa State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| accessdate = 2013-06-15
| url = http://kengema.tripod.com/id60.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its three dialects are [[mutually intelligible]]. The Kalabari dialect (Kalabari proper) is one of the best-documented varieties of Ijo, and as such is frequently used as the prime example of Ijo in linguistic literature.

As of 2005, the language, "spoken by 258,000 people, [was] endangered largely because of the massive relocation that has taken place in the area due to the development of Nigeria's oil industry in the [[Port Harcourt]] region."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The Kalabari language became the basis of [[Berbice Creole Dutch|Berbice]], a [[Dutch-based creole languages|Dutch Creole]] spoken in Eastern [[Guyana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia

'''Kare''' (Kãrɛ̃, Kareng) is an [[Mbum languages|Mbum language]] of the [[Central African Republic]]. It is spoken by around 97,000 people in the country. There are a few thousand speakers in [[Cameroon]]. 

''[[Ethnologue]]'' 17 reports that Kare is intelligible with [[Mbum language|Mbum]] proper. However, languages more closely related to either are not reported to be intelligible. ''Ethnologue'' lists Tale (Tali) as a dialect, but Blench (2004) leaves it unclassified within the Mbum languages. ''Ethnologue'' also lists Kali as a synonym; Blench lists a [[Kali language]] in a different branch of the Mbum languages.

The '''Kathmandu Debates''' is a high school debating championship led by the youth of the [[Sano Sansar Initiative]]. The program aims to provide a platform to encourage young people to engage in social, political, and sustainable economic development issues through the use of the positive aspects of debating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&amp;news_id=46154 |title=News In Nepal: Fast, Full &amp; Factual, Political Affairs, Business &amp; Economy, Social Affairs, Lifestyle, Sports, Opinion, Interview, International, The Week News In English In Nepal |publisher=Myrepublica.Com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 Kathmandu Debates commenced with educational tracks focused on providing knowledge of debating in the [[Debate#World Karl Popper Debate Championships|Karl Popper Debating Championship Format]] to the students in Nepal. More than a hundred young, amateur students participated in the debate tournament, organized with support from the American Embassy in Kathmandu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nepal.usembassy.gov/ep-20130129b.html |title=EMBASSY PROGRAMS &amp;#124; Embassy of the United States Kathmandu, Nepal |publisher=Nepal.usembassy.gov |date=2013-01-30 |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nepal is one of the countries mostly dependent on remittances. The finals of the debate consisted of the motion "THBT [This house believes that] State should prioritize Foreign Investment to Labor Export as Major Economic Strategy". The final debate took place on February 7, 2013, the 7th Anniversary of the Sano Sansar Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2013/02/09/et-cetera/talking-the-talk/245128.html |title=Talking the talk |publisher=Ekantipur.com |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The Kathmandu Debates Tournament was organized in the KPDC (Karl Popper Debating Championship) Format. Teams were composed of four students accompanied by a debate coach. Due to the lack of debating culture in Nepal and with KPDC being a new style of debate in Nepal, the 2013 Kathmandu Debates held a three-day educational track for the students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanosansar.org/blog/2013/02/press-release-kathmandu-debates-2013/ |title=PRESS RELEASE – Kathmandu Debates’ 2013 &amp;#124; Sano Sansar Initiative |publisher=Sanosansar.org |date=2013-02-05 |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9667">'''Kéo''' is an [[Austronesian]] language belonging to the Kéo ethnic group (‘ata Kéo, ‘Kéo people’) that reside in an area southeast of the Ebu Lobo volcano in the south-central part of [[Nusa Tenggara Timur]] Province on the island of [[Flores]], eastern [[Indonesia]].

Kéo belongs to the [[Malayo-Polynesian]], Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, Bima-Lembata subgroups of the Austronesian language family and there are approximately 40,000 speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title =Ke'o
| url = https://www.ethnologue.com/language/xxk
| website = [[Ethnologue]]
| date = 6 May 2015
| accessdate = 6 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kéo is sometimes referred to as [[Nage]]-Kéo, the Nage being the name of a neighbouring ethnic group that is generally considered culturally distinct from Kéo, however whether or not the two languages are separate entities is ambivalent.{{sfnp|Baird|2002a|pp=2, 21}}

Uncommon to Austronesian languages, Kéo is a highly [[isolating language]] that lacks [[inflectional morphology]] or clear morphological derivation. Instead it relies more heavily on [[Lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] and [[syntactic]] grammatical processes.{{sfnp|Baird|2002a|p=30}}

==Sociolinguistic Situation==

Kéo (referred to locally as sara kita ‘our language’ or sara ndai ‘the language here’ as well as Bahasa Bajawa ‘The Bajawa Language’ by people not from central Flores) has distinct dialectal variation between villages. Kéo speakers are able to determine where someone is from based on pronunciation and word use.{{sfnp|Baird|2002a|pp=9, 28}}

Overall, the attitude towards Kéo by its speakers is unfavourable. It is considered more economically beneficial to speak Indonesian or English. Despite this sentiment, a sense of respect for the language remains through its oral traditions.{{sfnp|Baird|2002a|p=9}}

==Phonology==
[[File:Ke'o vowel chart.svg|right|250px|thumb|Ke'o vowel chart, from {{Harvcoltxt|Baird|2002b|p=94}}]]
The Kéo spoken in the village of Udiworowatu (where the majority of data has been collected on the language) has a phonemic inventory of 23 [[consonants]].

There is a four-way [[plosive consonant|stop]] distinction for [[manner of articulation]]: voiceless (unaspirated), voiced, preglottalised and prenasalised. This is atypical for an Austronesian language.{{sfnp|Baird|2002a|p=29}}

Kéo does not have a contrastive distinction between [[bilabial]]  and [[labio-dental]] , hence the term ‘labial’ has been used for the [[place of articulation]].{{sfnp|Baird|2002a|p=34}}

There are 6 [[vowel]] [[phonemes]] in Kéo.{{sfnp|Baird|2002a|p=48}}

| ''miu'' || 2nd person plural
|-
| '''imi-ko'o'' || 3rd person plural
|}

Kéo pronouns have the same form irrespective of their syntactic behaviour. They can function as independent pronouns, as subjects, objects or as  [[Possession (linguistics)|possessors]]. There are also no [[grammatical gender]] distinctions.{{sfnp|Baird|2002a|p=108}}

In the examples below we can see the 1st singular pronoun ''nga’o'' used across four different scenarios: as the subject of an [[intransitive verb]] (1), as the subject of a [[transitive verb]] (2), as an object, (3) and in the possessor slot of a possessive construction (4).

'''Examples:'''{{sfnp|Baird|2002a|p=110}}

(1) '''''Nga’o'''''	''mbana.''
       
1sg walk
       
I’m walking

(2) '''''Nga’o'''''	''bhobha''	''‘imu.''
	
1sg hit 3sg
	
I hit him.

(3) ''Kepa''	''kiki''	'''''nga’o'''''.
	
mosquito bit me
	
A mosquito bit me.

(4) ''Dima''	'''''nga’o''''' ''lo''.
        
arm	1sg	hurt
	
My arm hurts.				

===Alternate Pronoun Forms===

The alternate pronoun forms in Kéo are ''ja’o'', ''miu'', ''kita'' and ''sira''. Their usage can depend on dialectal variants, politeness and [[taboo]] avoidance rules and specificity with quantity of people involved in the utterance.{{sfnp|Baird|2002a|p=111}}

====''ja’o''====

''J’ao'' is an alternate pronoun for ''nga’o'' in the first person singular. In the past, the two terms were used as a dialect-identifying feature for the Kéo speaking areas. Nowadays, both pronouns are used and personal preference appears to dictate usage. It has also been noted that a child will apply the term that is used by their mother.{{sfnp|Baird|2002a|p=111}}

In an example from a Kéo storyteller, both first person pronoun forms are used stylistically to distinguish the main characters during a passage of direct speech, Wodo Bako ''nga’o'' and the sorcerer ''ja’o''. This distinction can reflect the storyteller’s partiality towards a character depending on which form they themselves identify with.{{sfnp|Baird|2002a|p=112}}

'''Examples:'''{{sfnp|Baird|2002a|p=112}}

5)	''Négha''		''ké''	''Wodo''	''Bako''	''simba'' ''si’I'', “Ata podo''		        ''kau''	''kema''	''wado''	''‘ari''			'''''nga’o'''''.”
	
already	that	                W.	B	        then	say    person sorcerer	2sg	work	return	younger sibling	1st

After that Wodo Bako then said, “Sorcerer you bring back my younger brother.”

6)	‘Ata		podo		si’I, “Modo	'''''ja’o'''''	kema	wado”
	
person 	sorcerer	say ok		1sg	work	to return
	
The sorcerer said, “Ok I’ll bring him back.”							

====''miu''====

''Miu'' as shown in the ‘standard’ pronoun form table above is used to address more than one person, yet it can also be used to show a level of respect and politeness when speaking to someone.

'''Example:'''{{sfnp|Baird|2002a|p=113}}

7) ''‘Iné''		'''''miu''''' ''ta''		''ndia.''
	
ma’am	2pl  REL	here.
	
Ma’am, you stay here (while I go).

====''kita''====

''Kita'' is the pronoun used for first person plural [[clusivity|inclusive]]. In some cases ''kita'' is used to replace ''kami'' (first personal plural [[clusivity|exclusive]]) when talking about belongings or possession. This switch in pronoun to include the addressee(s) makes the speaker appear more community-minded and generous opposed to being arrogant or selfish.{{sfnp|Baird|2002a|p=113}}

'''Example:'''{{sfnp|Baird|2002a|p=113}}

8) ''kamba''	''ko’o''	''sai?'' ''Kamba''	'''''kita'''''.
	
buffalo	POSS who buffalo	1pl.incl
	
Whose buffalo are these? Our water buffalo.

====''sira''====

''Sira'' is the archaic third person pronoun plural form that can replace the standard second and third person pronouns ''kay'' and ''‘imi''. ''Sira'' is used to avoid certain taboos in Kéo culture that include addressing parents-in-law or people held in high regard. Sira is also used when addressing a large group of people.{{sfnp|Baird|2002a|p=114}}

===Pronoun + Numeral===

Kéo pronouns can be followed by numerals to indicate the exact number of referents. The pronoun-numeral sequence is the only time a number can be used without a  [[classifier (linguistics)|classifier]]. The most common numeral used is ''rua'' ‘two’ (9) to create [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual pronouns]],{{sfnp|Baird|2002a|p=114}} yet it also acceptable to use any other numeral (10).

'''Examples:'''{{sfnp|Baird|2002a|p=114}}

9) ''Mama'' ''né’e''	''bapa''	''ko’o''	''Henri'' 	''itu''	''tungga''	'''''kami'''''		''rua'' ''weta''	''nala''.

mum	and	dad	POSS	H.	that	only		1pl.excl	two sister	brother

Me and Henri’s dad, only us two were siblings.

10) ''Rembu''	'''''miu'''''	''dima''	''mbana''.

All		2pl	five	go
	
All five of you go.

The '''languages of Palestine''' are the languages spoken or once spoken in the territory of the [[State of Palestine]].

==Overview==
[[Palestinian Arabic]] is the primary language spoken by Palestinians and has a unique dialect. A Levantine Arabic dialect subgroup, it is spoken in Palestine by [[Arab citizens of Israel]] (mostly Palestinians) and in most Palestinian populations around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: L-R - Page 1492, James Minahan - 2002&lt;/ref&gt; However, Palestinian refugees in other parts of the world may have a different dialect from Palestinian Arabic. In the West Bank, there are many Israeli settlements in which, since the early 20th century, Hebrew has become more common. However, [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Amharic]] has also started to appear resulting from aliyah from Ethiopia. Other Jewish migrants have also brought other European languages.&lt;ref&gt;Struggle and Survival in Palestine/Israel - Page 403, Gershon Shafir - 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In premodern and medieval time periods, many other languages had also been spoken in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] for ceremonial purposes or otherwise, including [[Latin]] and other [[Italic languages]] as well as [[French language|French]], [[Germanic languages]], [[Classical Arabic]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]. However, they gradually faded away along with geopolitical shifts and the end of feudalism.&lt;ref&gt;''Naming Patterns in the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem'', p. 42, Iris Shagrir - 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Sixth National Population Census of the People's Republic of China|the sixth population census]]'' in 2010 the overall literacy rate in the [[People's Republic of China]] was 95.92%. In the different regions the illiteracy rate varies considerably, though. The following is a list of the first-level [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China|administrative divisions]] covered in the population census, including all provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, in order of their officially reported [[literacy|illiteracy rate]] for people aged 15 and above in 2010. The figures are from the 2010 census published by the Bureau of Statistics of the PRC.

Figures from a different source, the CIA World Factbook, are given for the special administrative regions [[Hong Kong]] (2002) and [[Macau]] (2001); these are not directly comparable as the methodologies used may differ.

[[Controlled natural language]]s are natural languages that have been altered to make them simpler, easier to use, or more acceptable in certain circumstances, such as for use by people who do not speak the original language well. The following projects are examples of controlled English:

* [[Basic English]], [[Special English]], [[Globish (Gogate)]] and [[Globish (Nerriere)]] seek to limit the language to a given list of common-use words and terms in order to make it simpler to foreign learners or other people who may have difficulties
* [[Plain English]] proposes a more direct, short, clear language by avoiding many idioms, jargon and foreign words
* [[Simplified Technical English]] seeks to largely reduce the complexity and ambiguity of technical texts (such as manuals)
* [[E-Prime]] eliminates the verb ''to be'' with the intent of making writing more expressive and accurate.

===Visual languages===
Visual languages use symbols or movements in place of the spoken word. [[Sign language]]s fall in this category.
* [[Blissymbols]] (zbl)
* [[Gestuno]]
* [[List of sign languages]]

==Ritual languages==
These are languages (and scripts) in actual use by their communities or congregations.
* [[Damin]]
* [[Eskayan]]
* [[Medefaidrin]]

==Engineered languages==

===Knowledge representation===
{{see also|Ontology language}}
* [[Attempto Controlled English]] is a [[controlled natural language]] that is also a knowledge representation language.&lt;ref&gt;Schwitter, Rolf. "[https://aclanthology.info/pdf/C/C10/C10-2128.pdf Controlled natural languages for knowledge representation]." Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Posters. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Several well known [[Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language]]s have been created from extensive research projects, to represent and query knowledge on computers:
** [[Knowledge Interchange Format]] (KIF), a precursor for knowledge representation.
** [[Common Logic]] (CL), an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard derived from KIF.
** [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF), a language standardized by the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) based on the principles of Common Logic, which represents knowledge as a directed graph built from unordered sets of "sentences" (in fact, as relational triples: subject, relation, attribute) using various syntaxes ([[RDF/XML|XML]], [[Turtle (syntax)|Turtle]], [[JSON-LD]], [[RDFa]]) for its interchange format. Each element of the triple can be either a simple value (if its semantic value is not specified outside of the relation using it), or identifiers of objects (such as [[uniform resource identifier|URI]]s) that are part of enumeration built from another subset of relational triples. The relations may be open (in which case the attributes are not enumerable) or closed in a finite enumerable set whose elements can be easily represented as objects as well with their own identity participating in many different relations for other parts of the knowledge.
*** [[Universal Modeling Language|UML]] may be used to describe the sets of relations and rules of inference and processing, and [[Structured Query Language|SQL]] may be used to use them in concrete schemas and compact store formats, but RDF designs its own (semantically more powerful) schema language for handling large sets of knowledge data stored in RDF format.
*** RDF is most probably useful only for automated machine processing, but its verbosity and complex (for a human) representation mechanisms and inference rules do not qualify it as a human language except in very limited contexts. It is still a specification with extensive research.
** [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL), another knowledge representation language standardized by W3C, and derived from Common Logic.
* [[CycL language|CycL]]
* The [[Distributed Language Translation]] project used a "binary-coded" version of [[Esperanto]] as a [[pivot language]] between the source language and its translation.
* [[Lincos (language)|Lincos]]
* [[LoomLanguage|Loom]]
* [[Universal Networking Language]] (UNL)

Additionally, sketches of various other languages, such as [[Adûnaic]], the [[Black Speech]], [[Khuzdul]], [[Telerin]] and [[Westron]] appear in his [[Middle-earth]] works alongside earlier draughts or imagined archaic forms of [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elven]] languages such as [[Common Eldarin]] or [[Primitive Quendian]], [[Goldogrin]], and [[Ilkorin]]. Others such as [[Entish]], [[Rohirric]], and six languages of the [[Avari (Middle-earth)|Avari]] are mentioned but have only one or two words or phrases noted.

[[File:Lula Khamenei Teerã 2010.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Supreme Leader of Iran]] [[Ali Khamenei]] talking with [[President of Brazil|Brazilian President]] [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]]]]
'''Lulism''' ({{lang-pt|lulismo}}) is a political ideology describing the 2006 consolidation of segments of [[Brazil]]ian society previously hostile to [[social movement]]s and the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] behind political forces led by [[President of Brazil|President]] [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0101-33002009000300004|title=Raizes sociais e ideológicas do lulismo|last=Singer|first=André|journal=Novos estudos CEBRAP|issue=85|year=November 2009|language=Portoguese|location=São Paulo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controlled [[reformism]] and limited structural change focused on the poorest sections of society.&lt;ref name="Brazil: Is 'Lulism' over?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://links.org.au/node/3414|title=Brazil: Is 'Lulism' over?|work=Links International Journal of Socialist Renewal|date=23 June 2013|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lumpenproletariat|lower classes]], who had distanced themselves from Lula, accepted his candidacy after his first term as President as the [[middle class]] turned from him. One explanation would be a new ideological configuration incorporating [[Left-wing politics|left-]] and [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] elements. The [[rhetoric]] and [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] which united the maintenance of stability and state distributism are the origins of Lulism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.br/pdf/nec/n85/n85a04.pdf|title=Raízes Sociais e Ideológicas do Lulismo|author=André Singer|format=PDF|language=Portoguese|publisher=[[SciELO]]|date=November 2009|accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although distinct, it shares characteristics of [[Chavismo|Chavism]] and [[Kirchnerism]].

To build political consensus and secure social peace, Lulism has forged a coalition of interests across Brazilian society instead of pursuing an ideological agenda and gradual reformism was favored over direct confrontation with the elite. Brazilian manufacturers, banks and retailers benefited from the consumption-led and credit-fueled government economic model.{{sfn|Casanova|Kassum|2014|p=32}} According to [[André Vítor Singer|André Singer]], who coined the term: "The convergence of interests of the private industry sector on one side, and of the organized labor force on the other, led to the stability that allowed this political system to take the form of a sort of consensus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brazilchamber.no/?p=1035|title=BNCC's Mission|publisher=Brazilian-Norwegian Chamber of Commerce|accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This equilibrium allowed the government to gradually make significant changes in policy. In the Lulism movement, non-confrontation is a ''[[sine qua non]]'' for development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brazilchamber.no/?p=1035|title=Lula +10: results and evolution of "Lulism"|publisher=Brazilian-Norwegian Chamber of Commerce|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolution ==
The word Lulism was coined by [[André Vítor Singer|André Singer]], a political scientist and Lula's press secretary from 2003 to 2005 and spokesperson during his presidency from 2002 to 2007.&lt;ref name="Brazil: Is 'Lulism' over?"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FSP/19-AGO-2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrissima/1139728-cientista-politico-andre-singer-explica-sua-tese-sobre-o-lulismo.shtml|title=Cientista político André Singer explica sua tese sobre o lulismo|last=Werneck|first=Paulo|work=Folha de S. Paulo|language=Portoguese|date=19 August 2012|accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IG/30-SET-2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/politica/2012-09-30/andre-singer-o-lulismo-nao-e-um-monopolio-do-pt.html|title=André Singer: 'O lulismo não é um monopólio do PT'|last=Galhardo|first=Ricardo|work=Último Segundo|date=30 September 2012|accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norlarnet.uio.no/events/events/2013/lula/|title=Lula + 10: Achievements, directions and challenges of the social transformations in Brazil|publisher=NorLARNet|date=11 April 2013|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originating in the [[Brazilian presidential election, 2002|2002 presidential campaign]], Lulism departed from the left-wing politics of the Workers Party until late 2001&lt;ref name="CEBRAP/2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0101-33002009000300004&amp;script=sci_arttext|title=André Singer: Raízes sociais e ideológicas do lulismo|last=Singer|first=André|work=Novos Estudos Cebrap|issue=85|language=Portoguese|location=São Paulo|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and abandoned the concepts of organization and mobilization. Since Lulism is a model of enforced change within order, mobilization is unnecessary and conflict is eliminated.&lt;ref name="IG/30-SET-2012"/&gt;

A 2009 article written for the [[Instituto Millenium]] said that "liberals are cornered" after "more than six years of Lulism". [[Patrícia Carlos de Andrade]] adopted that view: "According to her, the term 'liberal' is mistranslated in Brazil as 'rightist' or 'supportive of [[military dictatorships]]'. In the war for public opinion, the so-called left always got the better, Singer says".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exame.abril.com.br/rede-de-blogs/instituto-millenium/2009/06/03/conversa-com-patricia/|title=Conversa com Patrícia|language=Portuguese|last=Allan|first=Ricardo|publisher=Instituto Millenium|date=3 June 2009|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lulism sought reconciliation between Lula's charisma and the large [[Conservatism in Brazil|Brazilian conservative]] sector.&lt;ref name="IG/30-SET-2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VIOMUNDO/28-JUN-2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viomundo.com.br/politica/gustavo-gindre-dilma-e-o-esgotamento-do-lulismo.html|title=Gustavo Gindre: Dilma e o esgotamento do lulismo|last=Gindre|first=Gustavo|publisher=Viomundo|language=Portoguese|date=28 June 2013|accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically,&lt;ref name="BF/03-JAN-2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brasildefato.com.br/node/11399|title=Os impasses do "lulismo"|last1=Becker|first1=Fernanda|last2=David|first2=Anthony|publisher=Brasil de Fato|language=Portoguese|date=3 January 2013|accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is a conservative social pact combining the economic policy of [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] (1995–2002) with the [[Distributism|distributive]] policies of Lula's government (2002–2010).&lt;ref name="FSP/19-AGO-2012"/&gt;

Under the auspices of conciliation,&lt;ref name="TEMPO-SOCIAL/NOV-2012"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S0103-20702012000200014|title=Fábio Cardoso Keinert: Os sentidos do lulismo - reforma gradual e pacto conservador|last=Cardoso Keinert|first=Fábio|journal=Tempo Social|volume=24|issue=2|language=Portoguese|location=São Paulo|date=November 2012|accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lulism represents an "appeasement of social conflicts, of which the [[bourgeoisie]] has always [been] too afraid, especially in a country of great inequality as is the case of Brazil" because it envisions a "reduction-agenda poverty and inequality, but under the aegis of a weak reformism".&lt;ref name="BF/03-JAN-2013"/&gt; This social change model is explained as a "conservative variant of modernization" in which the state has a "prominent role in leveraging the poorest", ensuring that Brazilian social structural problems will not be touched (in other words, without conflicting with the financial interests of the conservative elite).&lt;ref name="TEMPO-SOCIAL/NOV-2012"/&gt; Lulism "concocted new ideological, under-union banners that seemed to combine" continuity of the Lula and Cardoso governments in [[macroeconomic]] policy based on three pillars, namely inflation control, a floating exchange rate and a budgetary surplus.&lt;ref name="CEBRAP/2009"/&gt;

Another feature distinguishing Lulism as a political movement is its nonpartisan character. It overlaps the political parties, including the Workers Party founded by Lula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sul21.com.br/jornal/em-30-anos-de-pt-lula-se-tornou-maior-do-que-o-partido/|title=Em 30 anos de PT, Lula se tornou maior do que o partido|last=Duarte|first=Rachel|publisher=Sul 21|language=Portoguese|date=7 October 2010|accessdate=24 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the movement was anchored in Lula's charisma, Lulism differs from other movements surrounding political leaders (such as [[Peronism]] in Argentina) in its lack of a [[cult of personality]] around the former Brazilian President.

With the recent events in Brazilian politics, such as the [[impeachment of Dilma Rousseff]] (which is consider it to be a coup by the Brazilian left and [[Centre-left politics|centre-left]] parties), the arrest of [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva#Operation Car Wash – Corruption investigation and prosecution|Lula on 7 April 2018]] and new President [[Michel Temer]]'s [[Brazil labor reform (2017)|reform of labour laws]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2015-2018/2017/lei/l13467.htm|title=L13467|language=Portoguse|date=4 July 2017|accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; some political commentators are arguing about a second phase of Lulism, now more radical and more left orientated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2018/01/24/politica/1516815938_008656.html|title=Lincoln Secco: "TRF-4 pode ter criado um lulismo mais radical, sem Lula e sem o PT, como é o peronismo"|last=Oliveira|first=André de|work=El País|language=Portoguese|date=28 January 2018|accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4694">The '''Master suppression techniques''' is a framework articulated in 1945 by the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[psychologist]] and [[philosopher]] [[Ingjald Nissen]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ingjald Nissen]], ''Psykopatenes diktatur'' 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; These techniques identified by Nissen are ways to indirectly suppress and humiliate opponents. In the late 1970s the framework was popularized by [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Social psychology|social psychologist]] [[Berit Ås]],&lt;ref name="kjerringrad"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ås |first=Berit |authorlink=Berit Ås|title=Hersketeknikker |journal=Kjerringråd |issue=1978:3  |pages=17–21 |location=Oslo |issn=0800-0565}}&lt;/ref&gt; who reduced Nissen's original nine means to five. Master suppression techniques are defined as strategies of social [[Crowd manipulation|manipulation]] by which a dominant group maintains such a position in a (established or unexposed) [[hierarchy]]. They are very prominent in Scandinavian scholarly and public debate, where the expression is also used to refer to types of social manipulation not part of Ås's framework.&lt;ref name="chef"&gt;{{cite web|last=Andrén |first=Maria |title=Så hanterar du skitsnacket |work=Chef |publisher=Ledarna |date=2008-03-11 |url=http://www.chef.se/dynamisk/index.php/ur_chef/senaste_numret_details/sa-hanterar-du-skitsnack/188651.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120525084338/http://www.chef.se/dynamisk/index.php/ur_chef/senaste_numret_details/sa-hanterar-du-skitsnack/188651.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-05-25 |accessdate=2009-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Master suppression techniques are sometimes called '''domination techniques'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/daphnetoolkit/files/projects/2002_181/int_domination_techniques_norway.pdf|title=Domination techniques: what they are and how to combat them|publisher=The Centre for Gender Equality, Norway|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20121025075341/http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/daphnetoolkit/files/projects/2002_181/int_domination_techniques_norway.pdf   |archive-date = 2012-10-25 | date=April 2001|pages=12|format=pdf|accessdate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Five master suppression techniques according to Ås==
===Making invisible===
To silence or otherwise [[marginalize]] persons in opposition by ignoring them

===Ridicule===
{{see also|Appeal to ridicule}}
In a manipulative way to portray the arguments of, or their opponents themselves, in a [[Appeal to ridicule|ridiculing]] fashion


===Withhold information===
To exclude a person from the decision making process, or knowingly not forwarding information so as to make the person less able to make an informed choice


===Double bind===
{{see also|Double bind}}
To punish or otherwise belittle the actions of a person, regardless of how they act


===Heap blame or put to shame===
To embarrass someone, or to insinuate that they are themselves to blame for their position

==Later additions by Ås==
Berit Ås has since added two supplementary master suppression techniques.&lt;ref name="womeninwhite"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ås|first=Berit|authorlink=Berit Ås|editor-last=Evengård|editor-first=Birgitta|title=Women In White: The European Outlook|year=2004|publisher=Stockholm City Council|location=Stockholm|isbn=91-631-5716-0|pages=78–83|chapter=The Five Master Suppression Techniques}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Objectifying===
{{see also|Objectification}}
To discuss the appearance of one or several persons in a situation where it is irrelevant

===Force or threat of force===
To threaten with or use one's physical strength towards one or several persons

==Countermeasures against master suppression techniques==
A group of PhD students at Stockholm University&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamstallt.se/docs/ENSU%20bekraftartekniker.pdf  ENSU, Empowerment-Nätverket vid Stockholms Universitet (2004) ”Bekräftartekniker och motstrategier - sätt att bemöta maktstrukturer och förändra sociala klimat.”, 2010-07-01]&lt;/ref&gt; has formulated five ''counter strategies'':
* Take place
* Questioning
* The cards on the table
* Break the pattern
* Intellectualise

They have also formulated five ''confirmation techniques'':
* Visualizing
* Adherence
* Inform
* Double reward
* Confirm reasonable standards


The [[Centre for Gender Equality]] in Norway has also published an article about how to combat this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://organizingforpower.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/forms-of-domination.pdf Domination techniques: what they are and how to combat them]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Partner-assisted reproduction''' (also known as '''reception of oocyctes from partner''' ('''ROPA''')) is a family model first introduced in [[Spain]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/718882 |title=Sharing Motherhood: Biological Lesbian Co-Mothers, A New IVF Indication |publisher=Medscape.com |date=2010-03-31 |accessdate=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In partner-assisted reproduction, one woman provides the eggs, and the embryo is implanted into her female partner's womb.  (As a technical matter, this technique does not differ from [[oocyte donation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/4/938.full.pdf |title=Sharing motherhood |date=2009 |website=humrep.oxfordjournals.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Using this process ensures that each partner is a [[biological mother]] of the child.

A '''Possum belly''', on a [[Drilling rig (petroleum)|drilling rig]], is a metal container at the head of the [[shale shaker]] that receives the flow of [[drilling fluid]] and is directly connected to and at the end of the [[flow line]]. A possum belly may also be referred to as a distribution box or flowline trap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Skinner|first=Les|title=Oilfield jargon|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3159/is_9_226/ai_n15649426/|work=World Oil|accessdate=25 July 2010|date=Sep 2005}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the possum belly is to slow the flow of the [[drilling fluid]] (after it has gained momentum from coming down through the [[flow line]]) so that it does not shoot off of the [[shale shaker]]s.

Possum bellies are generally used when [[bentonite]] or another form of "mud" is being used. During the use of [[freshwater]] or [[brine water]], the [[flow line]] generally either goes straight to the reserve pit, or into the [[steel pits]].

The possum belly derives its name from the similarity of its appearance to the underbelly of the female [[opossum|possum]]. Each of the chambers of the possum belly resemble an elongated teat similar to the ones found on female possums.

See [[Drilling rig (petroleum)]] for a diagram.

'''Racing identity''', expanded to '''prominent''' or '''colourful racing identity''', is a [[euphemism]] used by journalists (particularly in [[Australia]]) for a person who is believed to be involved in criminal activity, and who frequents horse or dog racing venues or is involved in some aspect of the racing industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bolt |first=Andrew |authorlink= |title=PM twists words to sell carbon tax |work=The Courier Mail |publisher= |date=17 April 2011 |url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/pm-twists-words-to-sell-carbon-tax/story-e6freomx-1226040273209 |format= |doi= |accessdate=10 June 2016 |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cowie|first1=Tom|title=Crikey quiz!

The term gained wide currency in the Australian media in the late 20th century due to a combination of legal and constitutional factors, including:

* the punitive nature of Australian state [[defamation]] laws which, like their English models, tend to be heavily biased towards the [[plaintiff]]
* the absence of explicit [[Freedom Of Speech]] provisions in the [[Australian Constitution]] and
* the lack in Australian law of any legal provision or precedent which makes truth an absolute defence in defamation cases.

The association between [[organised crime]] and racing (especially horse racing) in Australia developed largely because of the conservative nature of Australian law and government in regard to [[gambling]]. In the decades before the recent liberalisation of the laws governing [[poker machine]]s, [[casino]]s and other forms of gambling, betting on horse and greyhound racing was the only legal outlet for gambling in Australia (other than government-run lotteries).

As a result, horse racing (and to a lesser extent dog racing) provided one of the few legitimate means by which those involved in organised crime could easily 'launder' money earned from their illegal enterprises. Because betting with on-track [[bookmaker]]s could not be easily scrutinised by law enforcement or [[taxation]] authorities, it was relatively easy for such people to claim that any large sums of money they might possess had been won on a lucky bet, and it was extremely difficult for the authorities to prove otherwise.

An example of this phenomenon can be found in the case of the former NSW Premier [[Robert Askin]], who is widely reputed to have been at the centre of an extensive network of organised crime and official corruption, and who allegedly received tens of thousands of dollars each month in bribes from major Sydney underworld figures. Despite the fact that official inquiries uncovered assets far in excess of what he could have reasonably earned through investments and stock trading, Askin always claimed that his wealth was because he was a "canny punter" (i.e. a shrewd gambler).

Likewise, because on-track betting transactions could not be monitored as they could in the government-run betting agencies (e.g. the [[Totalisator Agency Board|TAB]]), major racecourses became favoured meeting places for many of the people who are now generally accepted to have been leading figures in Australian organised crime, such as [[George Freeman (bookmaker)|George Freeman]], [[Perc Galea]] and [[Lenny McPherson]].

A '''ring name''' is a name assumed for professional purposes by a [[professional wrestler]], [[martial artist]] or [[Boxing|boxer]].

==Professional wrestling==
Ring names developed as a way to allow wrestling performers to hide their true identities from the [[List of professional wrestling terms#M|wrestling fanbase]] and thus keep [[kayfabe]] intact, or because the wrestler or the management consider the athlete's [[real name]] unattractive, dull, difficult to pronounce or spell, amusing for the wrong reasons, or projecting the wrong image. Since the advent of the [[Internet]], it is now relatively easy to discover the real name of a wrestler, but it was far more difficult in the past. 

Some examples of ring names are Michael Shawn Hickenbottom becoming [[Shawn Michaels]], Roderick George Toombs becoming [["Rowdy" Roddy Piper]], Michael Sean Coulthard becoming [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]], Dwayne Johnson becoming [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] and Chris Irvine becoming [[Chris Jericho]].

A number of wrestlers have adopted their real name or a variation thereof for their [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|in-ring persona]], sometimes modifying the spelling of their real name to better fit their [[List of professional wrestling terms#G|gimmick]], such as David Bautista becoming [[Dave Bautista|Batista]] (now credited as Dave Bautista in his current acting career), Patricia Stratigeas becoming [[Trish Stratus]] and Richard Fliehr becoming [[Ric Flair]]. Others simply use part of their name, such as [[Bill Goldberg]] using Goldberg, [[Kenny Dykstra]] using Kenny, Nicole Garcia-Colace using [[Nikki Bella]], and Mike Mizanin using [[The Miz]], an abbreviation of his surname. Many female wrestlers go solely by their first name as well. Many also use a [[nickname]] in addition to their real name for marketability and other reasons

Some (mostly [[Independent circuit|independent]]) wrestlers, such as [[Nigel McGuinness]], still go to great lengths to ensure that their real names are not publicly known. Professional wrestlers are often referred to by their contemporaries by their ring name. In interviews, [[Bret Hart]] has regularly referred to [[The Undertaker|Mark Calaway]], [[Curt Hennig]], and [[Kevin Nash]] by their ring names (The Undertaker, Mr. Perfect, and Diesel).

Ring names are often [[trademark]]ed by the [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] that creates a character or gimmick for a performer.  It is common to see one performer use a variety of ring names throughout his career, even if his overall persona or gimmick remains similar. That is especially true in [[WWE]], which has largely forced most wrestlers that have debuted since 2006 to use a WWE-owned ring name instead of a ring name that they used on the independent circuit or, such as with [[Daniel Bryan|Bryan Danielson]] and a few others, their real name. One notable recent exception was made for [[David Otunga]] because of his then-current real-life relationship with singer [[Jennifer Hudson]], which gave WWE some mainstream exposure. For example, [[Low Ki|Senshi]] used a ring name specifically for his second [[Impact Wrestling|TNA]] stint so that he would continue to hold on to his original ring name, Low Ki, used elsewhere. Another example is the team known as [[The Dudley Boyz]] in ECW and WWE and Team 3D elsewhere. WWE trademarked the "Dudley Boyz" name, leading them to have to change their name when they went to TNA. The members' names ([[Bubba Ray Dudley]], [[D-Von Dudley]], and [[Spike Dudley]]) were also trademarked by WWE, forcing them to have to change their names to Brother Ray, Brother Devon, and Brother Runt. (Bubba Ray and D-Von later returned to WWE and reassumed the "Dudley Boyz" name; both have since retired from in-ring action, with D-Von now working as a WWE producer.) WWE partially repealed the policy in 2015, allowing wrestlers who were well-known in other promotions such as [[Samoa Joe]], [[A.J. Styles]], [[Shinsuke Nakamura]], [[Austin Aries]], [[Karl Anderson]], [[Bobby Roode]], and [[Eric Young (wrestler)|Eric Young]] to use their long-standing ring names (or in Nakamura and Roode's case, their real name) as well as wrestlers who sign "Tier 2" [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]] contracts such as [[Johnny Gargano]] and [[Tommaso Ciampa]] who wrestle both on NXT and the independent circuit to keep their ring names or (in Gargano's case) their real name. (Gargano and Ciampa have since signed exclusive WWE contracts.) "In-house" WWE wrestlers still use WWE-owned ring names.

In rare cases, the rights to a wrestler's ring name may be owned by a company with little or no connection to professional wrestling, such as [[Marvel Comics]]' ownership of the name [[Hulk Hogan]] until early 2003, which was due to Hogan being advertised as The Incredible Hulk Hogan early in his career, while Marvel owned the trademark for their [[comic book]] character ''[[Hulk (comics)|The Incredible Hulk]]''. Sometimes a wrestler will buy the rights to their own ring name; for example, Steve Borden owns the rights to the ring name [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]]. [[Test (wrestler)|Andrew Martin]], formerly known as Test, took this one step further and legally changed his name to Andrew "Test" Martin. Jim Hellwig, known as [[The Ultimate Warrior]], had his name legally changed to simply "Warrior".

In many cases, ring names evolve over time as the wrestler's gimmick changes, either subtly or dramatically. After debuting in WWE as the "[[Connecticut]] [[Nobility|Blueblood]]", Hunter Hearst Helmsley, [[Triple H|Paul Levesque]]'s character morphed into Triple H upon forming [[D-Generation X]]. A more drastic change sometimes occurs when a wrestler turns [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]] or [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]], such as when [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]] face Hulk Hogan joined the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] as Hollywood Hogan. Hogan's villainous new attitude was enhanced by changing his costume color scheme from Hulkamania's red and yellow to nWo's black and white. Brother Ray adopted the name Bully Ray when he turned heel. When Steve Williams joined the wrestling world in the late 1980s, there was already [["Dr. Death" Steve Williams]]. He therefore adopted the name by which he would eventually become famous, [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Stone Cold Steve Austin or Stunning Steve Austin]], which later became his [[legal name]] (as Steve Austin, without the "Stone Cold" portion).

==Boxing==
Many boxers have used ring names as their mode of identification during their professional boxing careers, particularly more so during the late 19th century and  the early 20th century. Some began with the prefix "Kid". Famous examples include:

*[[Kid Azteca]]
*[[Kid Chocolate]]
*[[Kid Diamond]]
*[[Kid Gavilán|Kid Gavilan]]
*[[Juan Meza|Kid Meza]]
*[[Jack Kid Berg]]
*[[Jersey Joe Walcott]]
*[[Joey Giardello]]
*[[Rocky Marciano]]
*[[Takaloo]]
*[[Tony DeMarco]]

==Oriental martial arts==
Various sports martial artists, such as [[Bill Wallace (martial artist)|Bill 'Superfoot' Wallace]] and [[Benny Urquidez|Benny 'The Jet' Urquidez]], have added monikers to their names. [[Bruce Lee]]'s Chinese name 'little dragon' is, however, more of a [[stage name|screen name]] due to his acting career.

==Global use==
* In [[Japan]], [[sumo]] wrestlers use a ring name called ''[[shikona]]'' (四股名 or 醜名).
* In [[Mexico]], [[Lucha libre|luchadores]] use ring names, and their identity is often further concealed via a mask. This is also the case sometimes in Puerto Rican Lucha Libre, such as the tag team known as [[Los Super Medicos]].
* In Latin America, it is common that boxers use a nickname and their real name in their fights, and both may be used each time they are introduced. Examples are Ruben "El Púas" Olivares, José "Mantequilla" Nápoles, Humberto "La Chiquita" González, Sergio "Maravilla" Martínez, [[Wilfred Benitez|Wilfred "El Radar" Benitez]], [[Wilfredo Gomez|Wilfredo "Bazooka" Gomez]], Roberto "Manos de Piedra" Duran and Román "Chocolate" Gonzáles.

==In fiction==
Wasp is [[Lisbeth Salander]]'s [[kickboxing]] ringname and [[Computer hacker|hacker]] handle, and she has a wasp tattoo on her neck.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13806">'''[[Russian language|Russian]]''' is the first language of more than 150,000 people in Azerbaijan, predominantly ethnic [[Russians]], as well as of [[Russification|Russified]] [[Azerbaijani people|Azeris]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Jews]], and other minorities. In 1994, 38% of Azerbaijanis spoke Russian fluently as a second language.&lt;ref&gt;Suny, Ronald and others, "Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia." DIANE Publishing, 1996; with. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{main article|Russians in Azerbaijan}}
Russian was introduced to the [[South Caucasus]] following its colonisation in the first half of the nineteenth century after [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Iran]] was forced to cede its Caucasian territories per the [[Treaty of Gulistan]] and [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]] in 1813 and 1828 respectively to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KTq2BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA728&amp;dq=russo+persian+war+1804-1813&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QnOXVJXpCcz7UPevhPAK&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=russo%20persian%20war%201804-1813&amp;f=false|title=Russia at War: From the Mongol Conquest to Afghanistan, Chechnya, and Beyond ...|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1830 there were schools with Russian as the language of instruction in the cities of [[Shusha]], [[Baku]], [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Elisabethpol]], and [[Shamakhi]]; later such schools were established in [[Quba]], [[Ordubad]], and [[Zaqatala (city)|Zagatala]]. Education in Russian was unpopular among ethnic Azeris until 1887, when Habib bey Mahmudbeyov and Sultan Majid Ganizadeh founded the first Russian-Azeri school in Baku. A secular school with instruction in both Russian and [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]], its programs were designed to be consistent with cultural values and traditions of the Muslim population.&lt;ref&gt;Humbatov, Tamara. [http://www.window2baku.com/Net/german8.htm Baku and the Germans: 1885 - 1887 years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719094840/http://www.window2baku.com/Net/german8.htm |date=2011-07-19 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually 240 such schools for both boys and girls, including a women's college founded in 1901, were established prior to the "Sovietization" of the South Caucasus.&lt;ref&gt;Mamedov, N. [http://revolution.allbest.ru/pedagogics/00076509_0.html education system in Azerbaijan].&lt;/ref&gt; The first Russian-Azeri reference library opened in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azerbembassy.org.cn/rus/historical19.html Azerbaijan in the second half of the nineteenth century].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918, during the short period of the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Azerbaijan's independence]], the government declared Azeri the official language, but the use of Russian in government documents was permitted until all civil servants mastered the official language.&lt;ref&gt;Aryeh Wasserman. «A Year of Rule by the Popular Front of Azerbaijan». Yaacov Ro'i (ed.). Muslim Eurasia: Conflicting Legaies. Routledge, 1995; p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Soviet era, the large Russian population of Baku, the quality and prospects of education in Russian, increased access to Russian literature, and other factors contributed to the intensive [[Russification]] of the Baku's population. Its direct result by the mid-twentieth century was the formation of a supra-ethnic urban Baku subculture, uniting people of Russian, Azerbaijani, Armenian, Jewish, and other origins and whose special features were being [[Multiculturalism|cosmopolitan]] and Russian-speaking.&lt;ref&gt;Rumyantsev, Sergey.

[http://www.bakupages.com/pubs/news-stall/10749_ru.php Azerbaijan lost Nasiba Zeynalova].&lt;/ref&gt; The widespread use of Russian resulted in a phenomenon of 'Russian-speaking Azeris', i.e. an emergence of an urban community of Azerbaijani-born ethnic Azeris who considered Russian their native language.&lt;ref&gt;Yunusov, Arif. [http://chairs.stavsu.ru/geo/Conference/c1-67.htm Ethnic and migration processes in the post-Soviet Azerbaijan].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, 57,500 Azeris (1.3%) identified Russian as their native language.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandre Bennigsen, S.

=== Russian-language Azerbaijani literature ===
The first works by Azerbaijani authors in Russian were published in the nineteenth century. In 1883 [[Ahmad bey Javanshir]] wrote a historical sketch in Russian entitled "On the Political status of Karabakh Khanate between 1745-1805."

[[Ismayil bey Gutgashynly]] and [[Yusif Vazir Chamanzaminli]] published original works in Russian in the years before the [[October Revolution]]. The great propagator of the Russian language among the Azeri population was playwright [[Mirza Fatali Akhundov]], founder of Azeri dramaturgy.

Russian-language Azeri literature continued to develop throughout the Soviet era. Its outstanding representatives are [[Imran Gasimov]], [[Hasan Seyidbayli]], [[Magsud Ibrahimbeyov|Magsud]] and [[Rustam Ibragimbekov]]s, [[Natig Rasulzadeh]], [[Alla Akhundova]] and [[Chingiz Abdullayev]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia "Krugosvet ". [http://www.krugosvet.ru/enc/kultura_i_obrazovanie/literatura/AZERBADZHANSKAYA_LITERATURA.html Azerbaijan literature].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Russian-Azerbaijani writers "Ray" and the Moscow branch of the Writers Union of Azerbaijan was established. In 2004, an association of writers and poets called Commonwealth of Literature was founded.

== Russian in the arts ==
Since the second half of the nineteenth century, Russian folk and pop songs have appeared in repertoires of [[Bulbuljan]], [[Muslim Magomayev (musician)|Muslim Magomayev]], [[Rashid Behbudov]] [[Polad Bülbüloğlu]], [[Zeynab Khanlarova]], [[Flora Karimova]], the [[Qaya]] group and many others. Even after independence from the Soviet Union Azerbaijani singers such as [[Brilliant Dadashova]] and [[Aygun Kazimova]] have continued to write and perform songs in Russian.

During the Soviet era, [[Azerbaijanfilm]] produced dozens of feature-length and documentary films in Russian, including famous films like ''The Telephone'', ''Don't Worry, I'm With You'', ''Asif, Vasif, Aghasif'' and ''Exam''. Films in Russian continue to be produced in Azerbaijan in the post-Soviet era.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azeri.ru/diaspora/actions/81/ "National Bomb" caused a sensation in Moscow]. "Echo". July 5, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russian today==
Outside of the capital, the use of Russian sharply declined after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Similarly, the Russian-speaking subculture in Baku experienced strong decline due to emigration of a large numbers of Russians. Nevertheless, the Russian language continues to feature prominently in the daily life of people in Baku.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elmira Akhundova]]. Interview for "The Mirror". February 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; As in the Soviet times, today the use of Russian in Azerbaijan is concentrated among the intellectuals and "élite" of the nation, however, a survey conducted by the [[Eurasia Heritage Foundation]] ranked Azerbaijan among former Soviet republics with the worst level of knowledge of Russian, along with [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Tajikistan]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Caravan. [http://www.fundeh.org/about/articles/40/ Russian language and culture in the CIS countries (for example, Azerbaijan): A Study of Fund "Eurasia Heritage Foundation."] Information-Analytical Center, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, President [[Heydar Aliyev]] issued a decree establishing Azerbaijani as the sole language of state operation. Shop signs, forms, and stamps in Russian were replaced with Azeri ones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medialaw.ru/exussrlaw/l/az/lang.htm Law of the Azerbaijan Republic "On State language of Azerbaijan Republic"] ( on September 30, 2002, № 5247)&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time compulsory teaching of Russian in schools was made optional.

In 2007, by decree of the National Broadcasting Council, live broadcasting of Russian TV channels ceased. Officially, this action was undertaken to protect Azerbaijan's national frequencies, which were declared a "national treasure of the country," from the influence of foreign media.&lt;ref&gt;Timur Rzayev. [http://www.nedelya.az/articlen.php?catno=0340005 "first" fell victim to the ambitions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425082601/http://www.nedelya.az/articlen.php?catno=0340005 |date=2012-04-25 }}. "Week". July 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It was rumored however, that the main reason was to eliminate the alleged pro-Armenian orientation of Russian TV channels covering the conflict in [[Nagorno-Karabakh]].&lt;ref&gt;Stella Gavrilova.

Despite the significantly strengthened position of the Azerbaijani language in the post-Soviet era, several Russian language newspapers continue to be published in Baku. The Association of Russian Writers is still operating in the country.

== Features of Russian in Azerbaijan ==
The Russian vernacular spoken in Azerbaijan differs from standard Russian due to the influence of the Azeri spoken throughout the country. At the phonetic level, this influence can be seen specifically in the initial lengthening of vowels,&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Feinberg.

== Education ==
There are more than 300 schools across the country, including 18 local high schools and 38 secondary specialized schools that provide instruction in Russian.

On November 24, 2009, Azerbaijan became the first ex-Soviet country to open the Russian Book House store. The opening ceremony was attended by the head of the Presidential Administration of Russia [[Sergei Naryshkin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=327554 Sergei Naryshkin: Book House in Baku will be the center of Russian culture.]''Vesti.ru''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social interactionist theory''' is an explanation of language development emphasizing the role of social interaction between the developing child and linguistically knowledgeable adults. It is based largely on the socio-cultural theories of Soviet psychologist, [[Lev Vygotsky]].

==Initial stages==

Approach to language acquisition research has focused on three areas, namely the cognitive approach to language acquisition or the [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|developmental cognitive theory]] of [[Jean Piaget]], the information processing approach or the information processing model of [[Brian MacWhinney]] and [[Elizabeth Bates]] (the [[competition model]]), and the social interactionist approach or social interaction model of [[Lev Vygotsky]] (socio-cultural theory). Although the initial research was essentially descriptive in an attempt to describe language development from the stand point of social development, more recently, researchers have been attempting to explain a few varieties of acquisition in which learner factors lead to differential acquisition by the process of socialization; called the theory of "social interactionist approach".&lt;ref&gt;Gallaway, C. &amp; Richard, B.J. 1994, Input and Interaction in Language Acquisition, Cambridge University Press, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socio-cultural theory==

Vygotsky, a psychologist and social constructivist, laid the foundation for the interactionists view of language acquisition. According to Vygotsky, social interaction plays an important role in the learning process and proposed the [[zone of proximal development]] (ZPD) where learners construct the new language through socially mediated interaction. Vygotsky's social-development theory was adopted and made prominent in the Western world though by [[Jerome Bruner]] &lt;ref&gt;Bruner, J. (1983). ''Child's Talk: Learning to Use Language" Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; who laid the foundations of a model of language development in the context of adult-child interaction.

In contrast to the theoretical positions of behaviourism, the approach to language acquisition emphasizing that children are conditioned to learn language by a stimulus-response pattern with which it is sometimes confused, the social interactionist approaches rests on the premises of a social-cognitive model, emphasizing the child's construction of a social world which then serves as the context of language development.

It levels an outline of a language acquisition theory in combining of both the traditional behavioral and linguistic position in language production; the essentials of this theory, which differentiate it from a semantically based theory, are that the deepest level of representation specifies the communicative intent primarily and semantic content secondarily. Thus, within this theory the language acquisition can easily be realized differently in emphasizing the role of the environment in producing such differences, as is most often the case in child language and not infrequently the case in adult language. It is incumbent on this model as on any serious attempt to provide a theory of language acquisition, to answer questions about how the model accounts for changes in the child's knowledge with development, and how the model can account for the adult's language system.

And as the behavioral approaches view that children as [[passive beneficiaries]] of the language training techniques employed by their parents and the linguistic approaches view that children as active language processors of whose maturing neural systems guide development; conversely, social integrationists communication enjoys a rather curious position in contemporary theories of language acquisition as a dynamic system where typically children cue their parents into supplying the appropriate language experience that children require for language advancement. In essence, it turns in supplying of supportive communicative structure that allows efficient communication despite its primitives.&lt;ref&gt;Niedzielski, N.A. &amp; Preston D.R. 2003, Folk Linguistics, Walter de Gruyter, Berlin.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current strand==

Social-interactionists, such as [[Alison Gopnik]], [[Andrew Meltzoff]], [[Anat Ninio]], [[Roy Pea]], [[Catherine E. Snow|Catherine Snow]], and Ernest Moerk theorize that interaction with adults plays an important part in children's language acquisition . However, some researchers such as Bambi B. Schieffelin and Elinor Ochs claim that the empirical data on which theories of social interactionism are based have often been over-representative of middle class American and European parent-child interactions. Anthropological studies of other human cultures, as well as low-educated Western families, suggests rather that many of the world's children are ''not'' spoken to in a manner documented for educated Western families, but nevertheless grow up to be fully fluent language users. Many researchers now take this into account in their analyses.

In addition, social interactionists criticize the claim made by [[Noam Chomsky]] according to which the linguistic input children are presented with by adults addressing them, is full of errors and discontinuities. Another argument of [[nativists]]*** on which interactionists provide contrary empirical evidence is the availability of negative feedback on, and corrections of, children's errors.&lt;ref&gt;Moerk, E.L. (1983). A behavioral analysis of controversial topics in first language acquisition: Reinforcements, corrections, modeling, input frequencies, and the three-term contingency pattern. ''Journal of Psycholinguistic Research, 12'', 129-155&lt;/ref&gt; Moerk (1994) conducted a meta-analysis of 40 studies and found substantial evidence that corrections do indeed play a role. From this work, corrections are not only abundant but contingent on the mistakes of the child.&lt;ref&gt;Moerk, E.L. (1994). Corrections in first language acquisition: Theoretical controversies and factual evidence. ''International Journal of Psycholinguistics, 10,'' 33-58&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[behavior analysis of child development]]).

***Nativists are those who hold the perspective that language and other developments, cognitive or social, are innate... so this sentence doesn't quite make sense. Why would they argue that language develops from interactionist corrections?

{{Dutch Grammar}}

The '''T(ea)-rules''' (''T(hee)-regels''), are a set of conjugation rules used in the [[Dutch language]] to determine whether the second person singular/plural and the first and third person singular of a [[verb]] end in ''-t'' or not. These rules are related to the [['t kofschip]]-rule, which is used to determine the verb end for past tenses and participles. The combined sets of rules are also known as the d/t-rules.

*''Ik drink nooit t(hee)'' (I (''ik'') never drink t(ea))
*''Jij drinkt alleen t(hee) (als 'je' tegenwoordig is en voorafgaat aan 'drinkt')'' (You (''jij'') only drink t(ea) (if 'you' is present and precedes drinks (''drinkt'')) (informal)
*''Gij drinkt altijd t(hee)'' (Thou (''gij'') always drinkst t(ea)) (archaic/informal in Belgium)
*''U drinkt enkel t(hee) (als 'u' tegenwoordig is)'' (You (''U''/''u'') only drink t(ea)) (if 'you' is present) (formal)
*''Hij drinkt enkel t(hee) (als 'hij' tegenwoordig is)'' (He (''hij'') only drinks t(ea)) (if 'he' is present)

However the actual rules for Dutch conjugation are more complex.

==Second person pronouns==
The pronoun ''jij/je'' only makes the [[verb]] end in ''-t'' if it precedes the verb, and if the verb is in the [[present simple]]  or [[present perfect]] indicative. Modal verbs and the future/conditional auxiliary ''zullen'' allow forms with and without ''-t'' (but the subject pronoun must still precede the verb for the ''-t'' form to appear). This pronoun is informal and can be used in written language.

*''Jij'' '''gaat''' naar school. ("You go to school", simple present indicative, ''jij'' precedes verb)
*'''Ga''' ''jij'' naar school? ("Do you go to school?", ''jij'' does not precede verb)
*''Je'' '''zou''' naar school '''gaan'''. ("You would go to school", conditional auxiliary)
*''Jij'' '''ging''' naar school. ("You went to school", past tense)
*''Je'' '''kan''' naar school gaan. ("You can go to school", modal form without ''t'')
*''Je'' '''kunt''' naar school gaan. ("You can go to school", modal ''t''-form, ''je'' precedes verb)
*'''Kun''' ''je'' naar school gaan? ("Can you go to school?", modal, ''je'' does not precede verb)
*''Je'' '''zal''' naar school '''gaan'''. ("You will go to school", future auxiliary without ''t'')
*''Je'' '''zult''' naar school '''gaan'''. ("You will go to school", future auxiliary ''t''-form, ''je'' precedes verb)
*'''Zul''' ''je'' naar school '''gegaan zijn'''? ("Will you have gone to school?", future auxiliary, ''je'' does not precede verb)

If the radical of the verb end in ''-t'', the ''jij'' form always ends in ''-t'':

*''Jij'' '''rust'''. ("You rest", ''je'' precedes verb)
*'''Rust''' ''jij''? ("Do you rest?", ''je'' does not precede verb)

With the verbs ''houden'', ''rijden'' and verbs derived from them, the ''-d'' of the radical can be dropped if it is not followed by ''-t''. In a formal context, usually the ''d'' is not dropped.

*'''Hou''' ''jij'' van bloemen ("Do you like flowers?")
*'''Houd''' ''jij'' van bloemen ("Do you like flowers?", formal)
*''Jij'' '''houdt''' van bloemen ("You like flowers", ''jij'' precedes verb)

===''Jullie'' (2nd plural)===
The pronoun ''jullie'' always makes the verb end in ''-en''. The ending ''-t'' is also possible, but this form is [[archaism|archaic]] (although it does survive in [[Brabantian dialect]]).

*''Jullie'' '''gaan''' naar school. ("You go to school")
*''Jullie'' '''gaat''' naar school. ("You/ye go to school", archaic)

===''Gij/ge'' (2nd sing./plur.)===
The [[pronoun]] ''gij/ge'' makes the verb end in ''-t'', whether the pronoun precede or follow the verb. Modal and auxiliary forms also end in ''-t''. This pronoun is used informally in spoken language in [[North Brabant]] and [[Flanders]] only. Its written form only appears in archaic texts where it compares to English ''thou''.

*''Gij'' '''gaat''' naar school. ("Thou goest to school", present indicative, ''gij'' precedes)
*'''Gaat''' ''gij'' naar school. ("Dost thou go to school?" / "Goest thou to school?", ''gij'' follows)
*''Ge'' '''zoudt''' naar school '''gaan'''. ("Thou wouldst go to school", conditional)
*''Gij'' '''gingt''' naar school. ("Thou wentst to school", past)
*''Ge'' '''kunt''' naar school gaan. ("Thou canst go to school", modal)

No extra ''-t'' is added if the verb stem already end in ''-t''. The ending ''-t'' is added after ''-d'':
*''Gij'' '''rust'''. ("Thou restest")
*'''Houdt''' ''gij'' van bloemen? ("Dost thou like flowers?" / "Likest thou flowers?")
*''Gij'' '''houdt''' van bloemen ("Thou likest flowers")

In the [[subjunctive]] and in the regular past, the ''-t'' survives only as an archaic form:

*''Gij'' '''neme(t)''' een lepel suiker. ("Thou takest a spoon of sugar" / "That thou mayst take a spoon of sugar", present subjunctive)
*'''Werkte(t)''' ''ge'' hard? ("Didst thou work hard?" / "Workedst thou hard?", regular past)

In informal speech (only in Flanders/Brabant), the verb ends in ''-de'' or ''-te'', if ''gij'' follows the verb. In very informal speech (only in Flanders/Brabant), the subject is dropped altogether. The ''-e'' ending after the stem is a remnant of the [[Middle Dutch]] pronoun ''di'' which, over the centuries, developed into a [[clitic]].

*'''Zijde''' ''gij'' blind! '''Ziede''' dat nu niet? ("Are you blind! Didn't (you) see that?", informal)

==Third person singular and ''u''/''U''==
The rules for third person singular subjects and the pronoun ''u''/''U''  (2nd person sing./plur.) are the same: the verb takes ''-t'' in the simple present and present perfect tense of the indicative. Modal verbs and ''zullen'' (will) have forms without ''-t''. This pronoun is formal and is used in both written and spoken language. The spelling with a capital ''U'' is very formal and is used for royalty or deities.

*''Hij'' '''gaat''' naar school. ("He goes to school", present indicative)
*'''Gaat''' ''u'' naar school. ("Do you go to school", present indicative)
*''Hij'' '''zou''' naar school '''gaan'''. ("He would go to school", conditional)
*''U'' '''ging''' naar school. ("You went to school", past)
*''Zij'' '''kan''' naar school gaan. ("She can go to school", modal)

The first person singular for non-modal verb is identical to the radical. The form can end in a vowel or in a consonant (including ''t''). For the verbs ''houden'', ''rijden'' and their derivatives, the ''-d'' of the radical can be dropped in spoken language. In a formal context, the ''d'' is not dropped.
*''Ik'' '''ga''' naar school ("I go to school")
*''Ik'' '''rust''' ("I rest", radical ends in ''t'')
*''Ik'' '''hou''' van bloemen ("I love flowers", form without ''-d'')
*''Ik'' '''houd''' van bloemen ("I love flowers", form with ''-d'', formal)

==History==
Thoughtography (also known as psychic photography) first emerged in the late 19th century due to the influence of [[spirit photography]].&lt;ref name="Krauss"/&gt; Thoughtography has no connection with Spiritualism, which distinguishes it from spirit photography.&lt;ref name="Chéroux"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chéroux|first1=Clément|title=The Perfect Medium: Photography and the Occult|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EfBf1dNkadoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Perfect+Medium:+Photography+and+the+Occult.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWsO_Rq_TXAhUxY98KHYJODnUQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Thoughtography&amp;f=false|date=2005|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|location=New Haven, Connecticut|isbn=9780300111361|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first books to mention "psychic photography" was the book ''The New Photography'' (1896) by Arthur Brunel Chatwood. In the book Chatwood described experiments where the "image of objects on the retina of the human eye might so affect it that a photograph could be produced by looking at a sensitive plate."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Brunel Chatwood. (1896). ''The New Photography''. Downey. p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; The book was criticized in a review in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Lockyer]]. (1896). ''Nature''. Volume 53. p. 460&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychical researcher [[Hereward Carrington]] in his book ''Modern Psychical Phenomena'' (1919) wrote that many psychic photographs were revealed to be fraudulent produced by substitution and manipulation of the plates, double-printing, double-exposure and chemical screens. However, Carrington also stated he believed some of the photographs to be genuine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/modernpsychicalp00carruoft#page/125/mode/2up |title=Modern psychical phenomena, recent researches and speculations |publisher=[[Internet Archive]] |date=2010-07-21 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "thoughtography" was first introduced at the beginning of the twentieth century by Tomokichi Fukurai.&lt;ref name="Chéroux"/&gt;

Skeptics, among them professional photographers, consider psychic photographs to be faked or the result of flaws in the camera or film, exposures, film-processing errors, [[lens flare]]s, flash reflections or chemical reactions.&lt;ref name="Nickell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nickell|first1=Joe|authorlink=Joe Nickell|title=Camera Clues: A Handbook for Photographic Investigation|date=2005|publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]]|location=Lexington|isbn=9780813191249|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stein"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stein|first1=Gordon|authorlink=Gordon Stein|title=The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal|date=1996|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, New York|isbn=9781573920216|page=517|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brugioni|first1=Dino A.|authorlink=Dino Brugioni|title=Photo Fakery: A History of Deception and Manipulation|date=1999|publisher=Brassey's|location=Dulles, Virginia|isbn=9781574881660|page=160|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="skeptic"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carroll|first1=Robert Todd|title=The Skeptic's Dictionary: A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, and Dangerous Delusions|date=2003|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]]|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=9780471272427|url=http://www.skepdic.com/pphotog.html|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims==

===Tomokichi Fukurai===
Around 1910, during a period of interest in [[Spiritualism]] in Japan, Tomokichi Fukurai, an assistant professor of psychology at [[Tokyo University]] began pursuing [[parapsychology]] experiments using [[Chizuko Mifune]], Ikuko Nagao, and others as subjects. Fukurai published results of experiments with Nagao that alleged she was capable of telepathically imprinting images on photo plates, which he called ''nensha.'' When journalists found irregularities, Nagao's credibility was attacked, and there was speculation that her later illness and death was caused by distress over criticism.&lt;ref name="Lacefield"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kristen Lacefield|title=The Scary Screen: Media Anxiety in the Ring|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qEQNgGCktYC&amp;pg=PA37|date=1 April 2013|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|isbn=9781409476191|pages=34, 37–|quote=Later that year Fukurai began to study another psychic, Ikuko Nagao, who possessed a talent he called "nenagraphy" or simply ''nensha.'' Fukurai coined this term from the Japanese ''nen,'' meaning "thought" or "idea," and the Greek ''graphein,'' meaning "writing" or "representation," intending it to refer to the power of inscribing images directly onto photographic plates by sheer force of will. This phenomena was known among western psychical researchers as "psychography" or "thoughtography," a practice that first emerged with the discovery of so-called "N-rays" around the turn of the century.|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, Fukurai published ''Clairvoyance and Thoughtography''. The book was criticized for a lack of scientific approach and his work disparaged by the university and his colleagues. Fukurai eventually resigned in 1913.&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{cite book|author=David B.

===Eva Carrière===
[[File:Eva C fake ectoplasm made from newspaper.gif|thumb|right|Carrière with fake ectoplasm made from the French magazine ''Le Miroir.'']] In the early 20th century the psychical researcher [[Albert von Schrenck-Notzing]] investigated the medium [[Eva Carrière]] and claimed her [[Ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]] "[[Materialization (paranormal)|materializations]]" were the result of "ideoplasty" in which the medium could form images onto ectoplasm from her mind.&lt;ref name="Brady"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brower|first1=M.

Critics pointed out the photographs of the ectoplasm revealed marks of magazine cut-outs, pins and a piece of string.&lt;ref name="Heredia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/spiritismcommons00here#page/186/mode/2up |title=Spiritism and common sense |publisher=Archive.org |date=2010-07-21 |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schrenck-Notzing admitted that on several occasions Carrière deceptively smuggled pins into the séance room.&lt;ref name="Heredia"/&gt; The magician [[Carlos María de Heredia]] replicated the ectoplasm of Carrière using a comb, gauze and a handkerchief.&lt;ref name="Heredia"/&gt;

[[Donald J. West|Donald West]] wrote that the [[ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]] of Carrière was fake and was made of cut-out paper faces from [[newspaper]]s and [[magazine]]s on which fold marks could sometimes be seen from the photographs. A photograph of Carrière taken from the back of the ectoplasm face revealed it to be made from a magazine cut out with the letters "Le Miro". The two-dimensional face had been clipped from the French magazine Le Miroir.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald J. West|West, Donald]]. (1954). ''Psychical Research Today''. Chapter Séance-Room Phenomena. Duckworth. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Back issues of the magazine also matched some of Carrière's ectoplasm faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McHargue|first1=Georgess|authorlink=Georgess McHargue|title=Facts, Frauds, and Phantasms: A Survey of the Spiritualist Movement|date=1972|publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]|isbn=0385053053|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cut out faces that she used included [[Woodrow Wilson]], [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria|King Ferdinand of Bulgaria]], French president [[Raymond Poincaré]] and the actress Mona Delza.&lt;ref name="Stein"/&gt;{{rp|520}}

After Schrenck-Notzing discovered Carrière had taken her ectoplasm faces from the magazine he defended her by claiming she had read the magazine but her memory had recalled the images and they had materialized into the ectoplasm.&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt; Schrenck-Notzing was described as credulous.&lt;ref name="Heredia"/&gt; [[Joseph McCabe]] wrote "In Germany and Austria, Baron von Schrenck-Notzing is the laughing-stock of his medical colleagues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Frank|title=Debates on the Meaning of Life, Evolution and Spiritualism|date=1993|publisher=[[Prometheus Books]]|location=Buffalo, New York|isbn=9780879758288|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ted Serios===
{{main|Ted Serios}}
In the 1960s, it was claimed that [[Chicago]] resident [[Ted Serios]], a hotel bellhop in his late forties, used [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] powers to produce images on [[Instant film|Polaroid]] instant film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nickell|first1=Joe|title=Camera Clues: a Handbook for Photographic Investigation.|date=2010|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|location=Lexington|isbn=0813138280|page=197|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZMCQ7YHw4CgC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=thoughtography+psychokinesis&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=x-aMUvvAK4Tm2gW8j4CIDw&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=thoughtography%20psychokinesis&amp;f=false|quote=Psychokinetic Photographs. In 1967 the world learned of a Chicago man with apparently remarkable powers: he could merely ''think'' of pictures and cause them to appear on photographic film -- a supposedly psychokinetic (PK) process called "thoughtography." The man, an often unemployed bellhop named Ted Serios, was the object of a sensational article in ''Life'' magazine and even an entire book written by Denver psychiatrist Jule Eisenbud, ''The World of Ted Serios.'' To accomplish his marvelous feat, Serios looked through a paper tube that he pressed against the camera's lens. A Polaroid model was used . . .
|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serios's psychic claims were bolstered by the endorsement of a [[Denver]]-based psychiatrist, Jule Eisenbud (1908–1999), who wrote a book, ''The World of Ted Serios: "Thoughtographic" Studies of an Extraordinary Mind'' (1967), arguing that Serios's purported psychic abilities were genuine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kripal|first1=Jeffrey J.|title=Authors of the Impossible: The Paranormal and the Sacred|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, Illinos|isbn=9780226453897|pages=285|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5wD5hS03NkgC&amp;pg=PA285|accessdate=6 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, professional photographers and skeptics found that Serios was employing simple [[sleight of hand]].&lt;ref name="Hines"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hines|first1=Terence|authorlink=Terence Hines|title=Pseudoscience and the paranormal|date=2002|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, New York|isbn=9781573929790|page=77|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Psychic-Projections-Were-a/126934/ |title='Psychic Projections' Were a Hoax - The Chronicle of Higher Education |publisher=Chronicle.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-17 |quote=Anyone who knows anything about this issue knows that Mr. Serios was long ago exposed and thoroughly debunked as a fraud. This was done with absolute certainty by professional photographers Charlie Reynolds and David Eisendrath in the October 1967 issue of Popular Photography. Serios was observed, when he thought no one was looking, sticking pictures into his "gizmo," a tube he held between his head and the camera lens. That some claim he produced images without the tube, and at some distance from the camera, is easily attributed to double exposure or use of previously made exposures, followed by the fake snapping of a picture.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Masuaki Kiyota===
{{main|Masuaki Kiyota}}

Masuaki Kiyota is a Japanese psychic who was claimed to possess [[psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] powers.&lt;ref name="Kurtz"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Kurtz|title=A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LQh_AAAAMAAJ|year=1985|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Buffalo, New York|page=348|isbn=9780879753009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nickell"/&gt;{{rp|198}} Kiyota was tested by investigators in [[London]] by [[ITV Granada|Granada Television]] and the results were negative. It was discovered that with tight controls, Kiyota was unable to project mental images onto film. He could only achieve success when he had the film in his possession without any control for at least 2 hours.&lt;ref name="Nickell"/&gt;{{rp|198}}

According to magician and skeptic [[James Randi]] "Kiyota's Polaroid photos were apparently produced by preexposing the film, since it was noted that he made great efforts to obtain a film pack and spend time with it in private."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=K - Encyclopedia of Claims|url=http://web.randi.org/k---encyclopedia-of-claims.html|website=James Randi Educational Foundation|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Randi|first1=James|authorlink=James Randi|title=[[An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural]]|date=1995|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|location=New York|isbn=0312151195|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1984 television interview, Kiyota confessed to fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Melton|first1=J.

===Uri Geller===
{{main|Uri Geller}}
In 1995, famed psychic [[Uri Geller]] began to use a 35&amp;nbsp;mm [[camera]] in his performances. The lens cap left on the camera, Geller would take pictures of his forehead and then have the pictures developed. Geller claimed that subsequent images had come directly from his mind.&lt;ref name="skeptic"/&gt;{{rp|313}} James Randi claimed Geller had performed the trick by using a "handheld optical device" or by taking photographs on already exposed film.&lt;ref name="skeptic"/&gt;{{rp|313}}

==Vowels==
The vowel inventory of Upper Sorbian is exactly the same as that of [[Lower Sorbian]].{{sfnp|Stone|2002|p=600}} It is also very similar to the vowel inventory of [[Slovene language|Slovene]].

* An epenthetic {{IPA|/j/}} is inserted before a post-vocalic soft consonant, yielding a diphthong. If the soft consonant occurs before {{IPA|/ɛ/}} or {{IPA|/e/}}, it is often realized as hard, and {{IPA|/e/}} is lowered to {{IPA|[ɛ]}}.{{sfnp|Stone|2002|p=604}}{{examples needed|date=August 2017}}
* In literary language, the contrast between hard and soft consonants is neutralized in word-final position. Word-finally, the letter {{angle bracket|ń}} represents a post-vocalic sequence {{IPA|/jn/}}, as in ''dźeń'' {{IPA|/ˈd͡ʒɛjn/}} 'day'.{{sfnp|Stone|2002|p=604}}

===Final devoicing and assimilation===
{{Expand section|date=April 2015}}
Upper Sorbian has both [[final devoicing]] and regressive [[phonation|voicing]] [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]], both word-internal and across word boundaries.{{sfnp|Stone|2002|p=604}}{{sfnp|Šewc-Schuster|1984|p=26}} In the latter context, {{IPA|/x/}} is voiced to {{IPAblink|ɣ}}.

==Stress==
{{Expand section|date=April 2015}}
* Words consisting of up to three syllables are stressed on the first syllable.{{sfnp|Šewc-Schuster|1984|p=27}}
* Foreign words, such as ''student'' {{IPA|/stuˈdɛnt/}} 'student', preserve their original accent.{{sfnp|Šewc-Schuster|1984|p=28}}

'''Vyasaraya Ballal''' ([[Kannada]]:ವ್ಯಾಸರಾಯ ಬಲ್ಲಾಳ) (1 December 1923&amp;nbsp;– 30 January 2008) was a major writer in the [[Kannada language]] and [[Sahitya Academy Award]] winner &lt;ref&gt;[[Sahitya Akademi Award to Kannada Writers]]&lt;/ref&gt; for his novel ''Bandaya in 1986. His Novels Hemanthagaana, Uttarayana and Bandaya are the major contributions to the Kannada Novel.''

==Career==
Ballal was extremely sensitive in his portrayal of women in his works such as Anurakte, Vatsalya Patha, Hemanthagana, and Uttarayana. A critical analysis on Ballal’s novels titled Ballalara Kadambarigalu was brought out by MGM College under the stewardship of its then principal and writer Ku. Shi. Haridasa Bhat.

"Yet some questions still remain a mystery. Why did Ballal not choose to lead his retired life in Udupi, where he was born? Why was Ballal not chosen as president of the 74th All India Kannada Sahitya Sammelan held in Udupi? These questions will torment us for a long time," Prof. Hiriyadka said.

Vyasaraya Ballal had started his literary life by his contributions to a Kannada journal Nudi started in Mumbai. In fact his first novel Anurakte had appeared as a serial in Nudi. It was later published as a novel.

Vyasaraya Ballal and other friends in Mumbai, who were filled with ideas of securing freedom for the country and socialism,Importance of Kannada

Ballal writings also focussed on the importance of Kannada medium and Kannada learning.

Ballal’s candidature for the post of the president of 74th All India Kannada Sahitya Sammelan in Udupi was not pursued vigorously.

Ballal was a man of few words. He was a sensitive person and this sensitivity was reflected in his works. Ballal brought forth beautifully the working of trade unions in his novel Bandaya.

Vyasaraya Ballala was known for his revolutionary thinking and had written more than 25 books including novels, 100 short stories, politics, two plays and children's books. His novel 'Uttarayana' is acclaimed as his best work, while two other books 'Bandaya' and 'Manjari' received wide critical acclaim. 'Bandaya' brought him Kendra Sahitya Akademi award. The writer, who lived in Mumbai for five decades, had contributed short stories for Akashvani-Mumbai. He also served as the editor of 'Nudi', a Kannada weekly published by Kamaladevi Chattopadhay. He was a prominent member of Karnataka Sangha in Mumbai and also contributed to the columns in the dailies. After his retirement, Mr Ballala settled in Bangalore where he continued to write. Mr Ballala was a disappointed man lately as his name was not considered by the Central Office of Kannada Sahitya Parishat (KSP) for the presidency of 74th 'Akhila Bharatha Kannada Sahitya Sammelan' held in Udupi last month. He was born in Ambalapady near Udupi in 1923. His childhood was tough and after his matriculation he went to Mumbai and worked as a steno in a private company.

It is often referred to as '' ChaqF tinyaJ KichenA tziC Chatino de San Marcos Zacatepec'' or ''Chatino de Zacatepec'' as it is distinct from other [[Chatino languages|Chatino]] languages in the region. Zacatepec Chatino is part of the Eastern Chatino languages. It is spoken in the town of San Marcos Zacatepec, a town of approximately 1,000 people and inhabited by an [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous group]] known as the [[Chatino people]]. The language was once spoken in the village of [[Juquila District|Juquila]], but is now virtually extinct with two surviving speakers in the area (Villard 2015).

Zacatepec Chatino is a highly endangered language as it is spoken by about 300 Chatino's whom are all above 50 years of age.

==Classification==
Chatino refers to three closely related languages; the three being Eastern Chatino, [[Tataltepec Chatino|Tataltepec]] Chatino, and [[Zenzontepec Chatino|Zenzontepec]] Chatino of the Zapotecan branch. Zacatepec Chatino falls under the Eastern Chatino branch.

Zacatepec Chatino, being part of Chatino language family, has shallow [[orthography]]. It is more conservative then its Chatino counterparts as it conserves the [[Penultimate rule|penultimate]] syllables of disyllabic roots.

==History==
Little is known about the history of Zacatepec Chatino but according to Stéphanie Villard who studied and presented her thesis on the language, it has been on a decline for the past 40 years as natives continue to expand their ties with non-Chatino communities. With the help of the Zacatepec Chatino Documentation Project, Villard has uncovered some of the remnants of the language with the help of many natives from the area. The project includes visits in 2005 and 2006 by Hilaria Cruz, Emiliana Cruz, [[Megan Crowhurst]] as well as preliminary analysis of tones in H. Cruz y Woodbury in 2006. It also includes intensive work since 2006 by Stéphanie Villard, including 150 hours of audio, a sketch, papers on sandhi and inflection and grammar as well as short visits concentrating on textual documentation, tone, &amp; morphology

The major language spoken in Zapotec Chatino and its surrounding regions is Spanish so it is no surprise that many foreigners are coming to San Marcos Zacatepec speaking Spanish and not Chatino.

Although Spanish is the [[official language]] in San Marcos Zacatepec, Oaxaca, many government officials communicate in Zacatepec Chatino. A study conducted by Villard revealed that majority of the younger population are monolingual Spanish speakers.

==Geographic distribution==
Zacatepec Chatino is only spoken in San Marcos Zacatepec, Oaxaca in the [[Sierra Madre de Oaxaca|Sierra Madre]] region of Mexico.

===Dialects/Varieties===

Since Zacatepec Chatino is unintelligible with other Chatino varieties, it does not have any other dialects or varieties associated with it.

==Phonology==

=== Vowels ===
Villard (2015) reports that Zacatepec Chatino presents voicing of non-continuant after nasals, vowel harmony, and contrastive nasal vowels. It also lacks labial phonemes and has 4 levels of pitch ranging from low to high. It also presents 15 specific tonal sequences that can define 15 Lexical classes.

Its phonology presents a rich tonal system with a large inventory of phonemic tonal sequences as well as intricate [[sandhi]] patterns.

The vowels in Zacatepec Chatino are {{IPA|/i e a o u/}} and have several rules they have to follow which are juxtaposed with the nasal vowels among each other.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Villard|first=Stephanie|date=2015|title=The phonology and morphology of Zacatepec eastern Chatino|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2152/31492|journal=UT Electronic Theses and Dissertations|doi=|pmid=|access-date=May 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

/a/ does not present any restrictions in its distribution. /a/ is pronounced [a] and may be slightly nasalized. Here are some examples:

''n'''ǎ''' [na''] thing

''p'''a̋'''[pa''] dad

''kw'''ā ́'''[kwa]'' already

''mp'''aà''' ̋ [mba:''] godfather

''Wy'''àa̋['''bja:]'' Santos Reyes Nopala, Oaxaca

''ch'''ǎ'''ʔ [t͜ʃaʔ''] word

/e/ does not occur after the nasal stop /n/. /e/ can be long in final syllables and short in non final syllables. Here are some examples:

''traʔw'''ē ́''' [traʔwe]'' middle

''tik'''è'''ʔ  [tikeʔ''] aroused

''siy'''ě'''ʔ [sijeʔ]'' dressed up

''tsaʔw'''ě''' [t͜saʔwe]'' good

''nkyas'''e'''ʔ [ŋgjaseʔ]'' it got deflated

n''kyan'''è'''   [ŋgjanɛ'']̃ he/she sprayed it

''nkyaʔw'''è'''  [ŋgjaʔwe]'' it got split

/i/ occurs in final as well as non-final syllables of roots followed by a /?/. It is slightly restricted in its distribution. Here are some examples:

''p'''i̋'''[pi]'' poult

''p'''ì'''i̋[pi:]'' fair skinned, pale

''ly'''i'''ʔ̋ [li̻ ʔ]'' parrot

''mp'''i'''ʔ̋ [mbiʔ]'' dram

''ki'''i'''ʔ [ki:ʔ]'' fire

The distribution of /u/ is highly restricted. /u/ in monosyllabic words is rare. /u/ can be long in final syllables but is always short in non-final syllables. Here are some examples:

x'''ǔ'''ʔ [ʃuʔ] oldster

ch'''ūú''' [t͜ʃu:] Jesus

s'''ù'''nt'''ū ̋'''[suntu] issue (from Spa. asunto)

b'''ù'''rr'''ū ̋'''[bur̥u] donkey (from Spa. burro)

k'''u'''ʔwǐ [kuʔwi] drunk

s'''u'''ti [suti] his/her father

t'''u'''ʔwa [tuʔwa] his/her mouth

/o/ is restricted as well. It does not occur after the nasal stop /n/ and similarly to /u/, /o/ does not occur after the labiovelars /k&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;/ or /w/. Here are some examples

Ty'''ò''' ̋ [to̻ ] Pedro

k'''ōō''' [ko:] fog

y'''o''' [jo] guy

y'''oo''' [jo:] soil

pìx'''ō''' ̋[piʃo] peso

==Grammar==

===Morphology===
San Marcos Zacatepec is considered a [[head-marking language]] as it is synthetic and analytic. Some functions are the language are mixed; for example, person marking can be signaled through tone contrast and/or [[nasalization]], [[Clitic|encliticization]], or also by a separate word.

Its verbal morphology features a large inventory of [[allomorph]]s of its aspectual morphemes, which makes its verbal paradigms appear extremely irregular.

The sequence classes are “morphological”—some are specialized by part-of-speech, by inflectional category, or loan provenance, while others are open ended and general.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Syntax===
The basic word order is [[Verb–subject–object|VSO]] but there are other orders present. Here is an example of the Chatino Language VSO:
{| class="wikitable"
!N-da
!nu
!xni
!ndaha
!ska
!ha
!xtlya
!?i
!nu
!'o
|-
|con-give
|the
|dog
|lazy
|one
|tortilla
|Spanish
|to
|the
|Coyote
|}
This would say "The lay dog gave a sweetbread to the coyote".

Some morphemes, such as the marker ''"?in"'' have various functions in the grammar as it is a [[Dative case|dative]] marker. The dative marker introduces human objects, indirect objects, and also marks alienable possession.

Compounding patterns play an important role and word formation. the use of combinations of 'light nouns’ or semantically poor nouns and semantically rich adjectives (or nouns, although very rarely) is very prolific in the language. Villard provides us with an example of such formations: the light noun ''nu'' ‘the one who’, often occurs as a head noun in noun phrases, as in ''nu kīʔyó 'man''' (the one who is male) or ''nu kunāʔán'' 'woman' (the one who is female).

==Vocabulary/Lexis==
There are 15 lexical tone classes defined by 15 tone sequences. The sequences pertain to any noncompound stem but have different realizations depending on the number of [[Mora (linguistics)|moras]] in the stem. The sequence classes are “morphological”—some are specialized by part-of-speech, by inflectional category, or loan provenance, while others are open ended and general. Sequence class identity—not tones—determines tonal [[ablaut]] behavior and tonal inflectional classes. The progressive aspect is associated with an M tone which generates composed sequences beyond the original 15 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.surrey.ac.uk/englishandlanguages/research/smg/events/2014/the_exuberant_tonal_system_of_san_marcos_zacatepec_eastern_chatino.htm|title=The exuberant tonal system of San Marcos Zacatepec Eastern Chatino|website=www.surrey.ac.uk|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
