The '''Alacalufan languages''' or '''Kawesqaran languages''' are a small [[language family]] of South America. They have not been definitely linked to any other American language family.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, L. (1997). ''American Indian Languages: The Historical Linguistics of Native America''. Oxford Studies in Anthropological Linguistics 4. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adelaar, W. F. H., &amp; Muysken, P. C. (2004). ''The Languages of the Andes''. Cambridge Language Surveys. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Languages==
Early vocabularies show that Alakaluf was three languages, with an extinct Southern Alakaluf (vocabularies in Fitz-Roy 1839 and Hyades &amp; Deniker 1891) and Central Alakaluf (vocabularies in Borgatello 1928, Marcel 1892, and Skottsberg 1913) in addition to the critically endangered northern variety, [[Kawésqar language|Kawésqar]].&lt;ref&gt;Viegas Barros (1990, 2005), cited in Hammarström (2015) Ethnologue 16/17/18th editions: a comprehensive review: online appendices&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on alleged toponymic evidence, a purported [[Kakauhua language]] has sometimes been included in the Alacalufan family.

'''Bajjika''' is a language spoken in eastern India, considered by some to be a [[dialect]] of the [[Maithili language]]. It is spoken in the north-western districts of the [[Bihar]] state of India, and the adjacent areas in [[Nepal]].

== Territory and speakers ==

Bajjika is spoken in the north-western part of Bihar, in a region popularly known as Bajjikanchal. In Bihar, it is mainly spoken in the [[Samastipur district|Samastipur]], [[Sitamarhi district|Sitamarhi]], [[Muzaffarpur district|Muzaffarpur]], [[Vaishali district|Vaishali]], [[West Champaran district|West Champaran]], [[East Champaran district|East Champaran]], Eastern part of [[Saran district|Saran]] district, [[Sheohar district|Sheohar]] districts. It is also spoken in a part of the [[Darbhanga district]] adjoining [[Muzaffarpur district|Muzaffarpur]] and [[Muzaffarpur district|Samastipur]] districts.{{sfn|Abhishek Kashyap|2014|p=1}} Researcher Abhishek Kashyap (2013), based on the 2001 census data, estimated that there were 20 million Bajjika speakers in Bihar (including around 11.46 illiterate adults).{{sfn|Abhishek Kashyap|2014|pp=1-2}}

Bajjika is also spoken by a major population in [[Nepal]], where it has 237,947 speakers according to the country's 2001 census.{{sfn|Abhishek Kashyap|2014|p=2}}

== Relationship to Maithili ==

Bajjika has been classified as a dialect of Maithili,&lt;ref&gt;[http://multitree.org/codes/mai-baj MultiTree]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ethnologue.com/language/mai/17 Ethnologue]&lt;/ref&gt; but its speakers now assert its status as a distinct language. When the proponents of the Maithili language in Bihar demanded use of Maithili-[[medium of instruction|medium]] primary education in the early 20th century, the [[Angika]] and Bajjika-speaking people did not support them, and instead favoured [[Hindi]]-medium education.{{sfn|Mithilesh Kumar Jha|2017|p=163}} The discussions around Bajjika's status as a [[minority language]] emerged in the 1950s.{{sfn|Abhishek Kashyap|2014|p=1}} In the 1960s and the 1970s, when the Maithili speakers demanded a separate [[Mithila, India|Mithila]] state, the Angika and Bajjika speakers made counter-demands for recognition of their languages.{{sfn|Kathleen Kuiper|2010|p=57}} In the following years, the Bajjika community saw a growth in linguistic awareness, and local movements demanding an autonomous status for Bajjika arose.{{sfn|Abhishek Kashyap|2014|p=2}}

Maithili proponents believe that the [[Government of Bihar]] and the pro-Hindi Bihar Rashtrabhasha Parishad promoted Angika and Bajjika as distinct languages to weaken the Maithili language movement; many of them still consider Bajjika to be a dialect of Maithili.{{sfn|Mithilesh Kumar Jha|2017|p=163}} People from mainly [[Maithil Brahmin]]s and [[Karan Kayastha]]s castes have supported the Maithili movement, while people from various other castes in the [[Mithila, India|Mithila]] region have projected Angika and Bajjika as their mother tongues, attempting to break away from the Maithili-based regional identity.{{sfn|Manish Kumar Thakur|2002|p=208}} The exponents of Bajjika have unsuccessfully demanded an official language status for Bajjika from the federal and the state governments.{{sfn|Abhishek Kumar Kashyap|2016|p=169}}

== Films in Bajjika ==

''Lakshmi Elthin Hammar Angna'' (2009) was the first formal feature film in Bajjika. ''Sajan Aiha Doli le ke'' came after that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-08-17/patna/28156704_1_bhojpuri-film-industry-soumya-songs | work=The Times Of India | title=Bhojpuri artist to make first Bajjika film | date=17 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bedia''' a community of Bihar, they believe that they originally lived on Mohdipahar and have descended from the union of Vedbansi prince with a Munda girl. The other view is that a section of the Kurmis were outcasts and to be known as the Bedia or Wandering Kurmis.&lt;ref&gt;Ethnographic notes on the scheduled tribes of West Bengal by Manas Kamal Chowdhuri; West Bengal (India). Cultural Research Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bedia''' or sometimes pronounced Baidya are a [[Muslim]] community found in eastern [[India]]. They are a community of pastoralists, who traditionally specialized un the castration of cattle. The community speak a number of dialects of [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and use the surnames Chaudhary, Sekh, and Mondal.&lt;ref&gt;Marginal Muslim Communities in India edited by M.K.A Siddiqui pages 263-267&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name of the community==
The community has several names, like Bedia Kudmi, Shershahbadia, Bhathia, Wandering Kurmis, Maldahiya, Badia and Bedia. However its official name is Sharshahbadia. {{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Origin==

The Bedia are found mainly in central and north [[West Bengal]], the [[Purnia Division]] of [[Bihar]], [[Rajshahi District]] of [[Bangladesh]], the [[Terai]] region of [[Nepal]] and southern [[Bhutan]]. In [[West Bengal]], the Bedia are found mainly in the districts of [[Murshidabad District|Murshidabad]], [[Nadia District|Nadia]], [[Malda District|Malda]], [[Dakshin Dinajpur district|South Dinajpur]], [[Uttar Dinajpur district|North Dinajpur]] and [[Darjeeling District|Darjeeling]]. In [[Bihar]], where the community is known as [[Shershahabadia]], are found mainly in [[Kishanganj District|Kishanganj]], [[Purnia District|Purnea]] and [[Katihar District|Katihar]].And tha bedias are also found  In district of Jharkhand Mainly in [[Bhagalpur District|Bhagalpur]] &lt;ref&gt;Marginal Muslim Communities in India edited by M.K.A Siddiqui pages 263-267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ethnographic notes on the scheduled tribes of West Bengal by Manas Kamal Chowdhuri; West Bengal (India). Cultural Research Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present circumstances==

Traditionally, the Bedia were a pastoral group who used to breed buffaloes, sheep and goats, with the castration of cattle being a secondary occupation. By the 19th Century, the majority of the Bedia had settled down to cultivation, and majority were small and medium-sized farmers. A small number of Bedia were also [[jotedar]]s, or large landowners, particularly in [[Malda District|Malda]]. Presently, the bulk of the community remains cultivators, with a smaller numbers employed in the military and police services.&lt;ref&gt;Marginal Muslim Communities in India edited by M.K.A Siddiqui pages 263-267&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bedia are endogamous group, and marriage occurs within close kin. In Bedia society, consanguinal kin are classed into two categories, the bhiad or minimal lineage and khandan or maximal lineage. Marriages are preferred within the bhiad. Bedias of [[West Bengal]] now belong to the [[Ahle Hadith]] sect, which distinguishes from other [[Bengali Muslims|Bengali Muslim]] communities. The [[Shershahabadia]] of [[Malda District|Malda]] and [[Bihar]] remain [[Sunni]] [[Hanafi]].

Traditionally, each Bedia settlement consists of a paich, or [[caste]] council. These remain informal, and there is no [[India]]-wide formal [[caste]] association. The council consists of a hakim or headman, a jurist or mahat and a dhuli  or messenger. All intra-group or inter-religious matters and disputes are settled by the paich.

According to Risley, the Bedia are divided into septs. However, the present survey identified some exogamous clans, namely Phecha, Kachhua, Mahua, Bambi, Suiya, etc. The marriage age for boys and girls is sixteen to seventeen years and fourteen to fifteen years, respectively. A marriage is arranged though monogamy is prevalent. Married  women put a vermillion mark and wear an iron bangle as marriage symbols. The payment of bride price is obligatory. They follow the rule of patrilocal residence. Either spouse can seek divorce with social approval on grounds of adultery, barrenness, maladjustment, cruelty and laziness. Remarriage of widows and divorcces is permitted and a widow can marry her late husband's brother. The Bedia live both in nuclear and extended families. Sons inherit parental property in equal measure while the eldest son succeeds to his father's authority. A woman contributed to the family income and is tonsured. The first cereal feeding ceremony is optional. The marriage rites are performed at the bridegroom's house. The dead are buried. The death rites observed are telnahan and daskarma.

The Bedia are the followers of the traditional tribal religion. Their family and clan deities are Mai, Mudkati Kundri Bansa Darha, etc. The village deities worshipped by them are Jher-buri Gawandeti Mahadania, Durga and the regional deities are Palcharu and Badpahari. They visit the annual fairs at Rajarappa, Hundru and Jonha falls and Jaganathpur. The Bedia celebrate festivals like Phagun, Sarhul, Karma, Jitia and Sohrai.

The Bedia who have settled down in West Bengal, are also known as the Bedia Kudmi, Choto Kudmi or San Kurmi. They speak in Kudmali, an Indo-Ayan language, at home and Bengali for inter-group communication. The Bengali and Devanagari scripts are used.&lt;ref&gt;Ethnographic notes on the scheduled tribes of West Bengal by Manas Kamal Chowdhuri; West Bengal (India).

The '''''Bower Manuscript''''' is an early [[birch bark document]], dated to the [[Gupta period|Gupta era]] (between the 4th and the 6th century). This Sanskrit language manuscript is written in the [[Gupta script|Late Brahmi script]], and contains some [[Prakrit]].&lt;ref name="Sircar1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sircar|first=D.

The manuscript is notable as a benchmark for ancient literary tradition in India, and the evidence of the spread and sharing of ideas in ancient times between India, China and central Asia.&lt;ref name=mirskysas82/&gt; It is also notable for preserving one of the earliest treatises on Indian medicine ([[Ayurveda]]). [[Rudolf Hoernle]] (1910) suggested that the text of the manuscript contains excerpts of the (otherwise unknown) ''Bhela Samhita'' on medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hoernle |first=A. F. Rudolf |date=July 1910 |title=The Bhela Samhita in the Bower Manuscript |jstor=25189734 |journal=The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland |pages=830–833}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medical parts (I-III) constitute may be based on similar types of medical writings antedating the composition of the saṃhitās of sushruta, vagbhata and kashyapa and as such rank with the earliest surviving texts on Ayurveda.

It is today preserved as part of the collections of the [[Bodleian Library]] in Oxford. The Bower Manuscript in reality is a collection of seven distinct manuscripts, or it may be called a collective manuscript of seven parts.

==Discovery and edition==
[[File:Hoernle-bower-tp.png|thumb|Hoernle's edition]]
The Bower Manuscript is named after [[Hamilton Bower]], the [[British Army]] intelligence officer who obtained it from a local inhabitant in [[Kucha]] early in 1890, while on a confidential mission for the government of [[British India]]. Bower took the MS to Simla on his return, whence it was forwarded to Colonel [[James Waterhouse (photographer)|James Waterhouse]], the then the President of the [[Asiatic Society of Bengal]]. Waterhouse exhibited the manuscript at the monthly meeting of the Society on 5 November 5, 1890.

After the meeting some attempts were made to decipher the MS, but they proved unsuccessful. German Indologist [[Georg Buhler]] succeeded in reading and translating two leaves of the MS, reproduced in the form of heliogravures in the Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal.
 
Immediately after his return to India in February 1891, [[A. F. R. Hoernle]] began to study the MS. He presented the first decipherment two months later, at the meeting of the Society in April 1891. Between 1893 and 1897 Hoernle published a  complete edition of the text, featuring an annotated English translation and illustrated facsimile plates. A Sanskrit Index was published in 1908, and a revised translation of the medical portions (I, II, and III) in 1909; the Introduction appeared in 1912.

The discovery of the Bower Manuscript caught the attentions of the outward-looking European powers, arousing further interest in the region of its discovery and proving a major stimulus in the development of [[the Great Game]]. Hoernle claimed that "it was the discovery of the Bower manuscript and its publication in Calcutta which started the whole modern movement of archaeological exploration of Eastern Turkestan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hartmann|first=Jens-Uwe|title=Collection of Essays 1993 : Buddhism across boundaries : Chinese Buddhism and the Western regions|isbn=9575438604|pages=108|author2=Jens-Uwe Hartmann|article=Buddhist Sanskrit Texts from Northern Turkestan and their relation to the Chinese Tripitaka}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and dating==
The 'Bower Manuscript' is in fact a collation of two manuscripts, a larger and a smaller one. The larger manuscript is itself a convolute of six smaller manuscripts, which are separately paginated. These seven constituent manuscripts are numbered as parts I to VII in Hoernle's edition.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The text is written on 51 pages of birch bark leaves of an oblong shape, in the form of those of an Indian pothī. The birch bark of the large portion of the manuscript is of a quality much inferior to that of the smaller portion. The hole for the passage of the binding string is placed about the middle of the left half of the leaves. This placement of the string hole and the oblong form of the leaves point to an imitation of palm leaf pothīs from Southern India by the scribes of Kucā.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The seven parts of the manuscript are written in an essentially identical script, the [[Gupta script|Gupta Brahmi script]], which places the manuscript in the [[Gupta period|Gupta era]] (4th to 6th centuries). Hoernle placed the ms. in the 4th century on grounds of paleography, but palaeographical studies by Dani (1986) and especially Sander (1987) suggest a date of about the first half of the 6th century.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Hoernle distinguished four scribes who wrote parts I-III, part IV, parts V and VII and part VI, respectively. He identified the first and third of these as natives of India who had migrated to Kucā. To judge from the style of writing, the scribe of parts I - III originally came from the northern, the two scribes of parts V-VII from the southern part of the northern area of the Indian Gupta script. The writer of part IV may have been a native of Eastern Turkestan.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}
 
The script of the Bower MS are written is a type of [[Gupta script|Late Brahmi script]].&lt;ref name=mirskysas82/&gt; There is an influence of Prakrit, which is far more pronounced in the more popular treatises on divination and incantation in parts IV-VII than in the more scientific medical treatises of parts I-III.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Contents==
The text consists of seven separate and different treatises, of which three on Ayurvedic medicine, two on divination, and two on magical incantations to prevent snakebite.&lt;ref name=dwtra/&gt; The three medicinal treatises contain content that is also found in the ancient Indian text called the [[Caraka Samhita]].&lt;ref name= dwtra/&gt;

* Parts I to III, the three medical treatises of the collection, comprise a total of 1,323 verses and some prose; ... It is evident from this familiarity with metrical writing that the author of the three medical treatises was well versed in Sanskrit composition.   The author of parts IV-VII was not conversant with scholarly Sanskrit; these treatises are written, in a mixed type of language.
** Part I opens with a flowery description of the Himalayas, where a group of munis reside, interested in the names and properties of medicinal plants.  Mentioned by name are the following sages: [[Atreya|Ātreya]], [[Harita Samhita|Hārīta]], [[Parasara|Parāśara]], Bhela, [[Garga]], Śāmbavya, [[Susruta|Suśruta]], [[Vasistha|Vasiṣṭha]], Karāla, and Kāpya. Suśruta, whose curiosity is aroused by a particular plant, approaches muni Kāśirāja, enquiring about the nature of this plant. Kāśīrāja, granting his request, tells him about the origin of the plant, which proves to be [[garlic]] (Sanskrit ''laśuna''), its properties and uses. The section on garlic consists of 43 verses in poetic meter. This section is also notable for mentioning the ancient Indian tradition of "garlic festival", as well as a mention of sage [[Sushruta Samhita|Sushruta]] in Benares ([[Varanasi]]).&lt;ref name="dwtra"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wujastyk |first=Dominik |title=The Roots of Āyurveda: Selections from Sanskrit Medical Writings |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sJOEMwrVyRcC |year=1998 |publisher=Penguin Books India |isbn=978-0-14-043680-8 |pages=195–206|chapter=Chapter 4: The Uses of Garlic (from the Bower Manuscript)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Part II, which opens with a salutation addressed to the [[Tathagata|Tathāgatas]], contains, as stated by the author, the Navanītaka, a standard manual (siddhasaṃkarṣa).&lt;ref&gt;G. J. Meulenbeld, A History of Indian Medical Literature (1999–2002), vol. IIa, pp. 5&lt;/ref&gt;
** Part III is a fragment of a formulary, the contents of which correspond to chapters one to three of part II.&lt;ref&gt;G. J. Meulenbeld, A History of Indian Medical Literature (1999–2002), vol. IIa, pp. 6&lt;/ref&gt;
* Parts IV and V contain two short manuals of Pāśakakevalī, or cubomancy, i.e., the art of foretelling a person's future by means of the cast of dice. These parts of the MS are notable due for having no relevance to medicine or healing.
**Part IV is almost complete, while the manual constituting Part V is markedly more fragmentary. Hoernle thought it likely that Part V is one of the numerous recensions of the divinatory work accredited to the ancient sage [[Garga]].&lt;ref name="J. Meulenbeld 2002 pp. 8"&gt;G. J. Meulenbeld, A History of Indian Medical Literature (1999–2002), vol. IIa, pp. 8&lt;/ref&gt;
* Parts VI and VII contain two different portions of the same text, the [[Mahamayuri|Mahāmāyurī]], Vidyārājñī, a Buddhist [[Dharani|dhāraṇī]] that protects against snake-bite and other evils.&lt;ref name="J. Meulenbeld 2002 pp. 8" /&gt;

According to G.J. Meulenbeld: "An important peculiarity of the Bower MS consists of its varying attitude towards the number of the [[Dosha|doṣas]] [humours]. In many instances it accepts the traditional number of three, vāta, pitta, and kapha, but in a smaller number of passages it also appears to accept blood (rakta) as a doṣa."&lt;ref&gt;G. J. Meulenbeld, A History of Indian Medical Literature (1999–2002), vol. IIa, pp. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bunjevci''' ({{IPA-hr|bǔɲeːʋtsi, bǔː-}}) are a South Slavic ethnic group living mostly in the [[Bačka]] region of [[Serbia]] (province of [[Vojvodina]]) and southern [[Hungary]] ([[Bács-Kiskun]] county, particularly in the [[Baja (Hungary)|Baja]] region). They presumably originate from western [[Herzegovina]], whence they migrated to [[Dalmatia]], and from there to [[Lika]] and Bačka in the 17th century.{{sfn|Černelić|2016|p=11–12}} Bunjevci who remained in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as those in modern [[Croatia]] today maintain that designation chiefly as a regional identity, and declare as ethnic Croats. Those who emigrated to Hungary were largely assimilated, and assumed Hungarian or Croatian designation. Bunjevci are mainly [[Roman Catholic]], and speak a [[Bunjevac dialect]] of [[Croatian language]] with [[Shtokavian#Yat_reflexes|Ikavian]] pronunciation and with certain archaic characteristics. During the 18th and 19th century, they formed a sizable part of the population of northern Bačka, but many of them were gradually assimilated into larger ethnic groups in the region.

==Ethnology==
The Bunjevci are a South Slavic ethnic group, Catholic by religion, and Western [[Shtokavian#Bosnian–Dalmatian|Shtokavian]]-[[Ikavian]] by dialect,&lt;ref name="Identitet"/&gt; of which majority who still declares as Bunjevci live in the [[Bačka]] region in Serbia and [[Bács-Kiskun]] county in Hungary.

===Ethnonym===
Their endonym, used in Croatian, is ''Bunjevci'' (pronounced {{IPA-sh|bǔɲeʋtsi}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hjp.srce.hr/index.php?show=search_by_id&amp;id=f11nWBY%3D&amp;keyword=Bunjevci |title=Bunjevci |publisher=Hrvatski jezični portal |quote=Bùnjevci... etn.

According to [[Petar Skok]] they also called themselves in Bačka as ''oò*kac'' ([[Šokci|Šokac]]), while Hungarians in [[Szeged]] also called them as ''Dalmát'' (Dalmatians; Dalmatini),&lt;ref name="Skok"/&gt; which they also used for themselves in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/65550?lang=en|title=Uloga Hrvata u povijesti slobodnog i kraljevskog grada Szegedina|author=Ladislav Heka|date=2010|journal=Annals of the Institute for Scientific and Art Research Work in Osijek|issue=26|language=Serbo-Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the term meant Catholic (Croat) population from [[Livanjsko field]] up to [[Montenegro]] which was mostly considered by the neighbor [[Serbs|Serbian]] Orthodox population,{{sfn|Černelić|2016|p=215–216}} while at [[Peroj]] in [[Istria]] it was a pejorative name for [[Croats]] as well ''pobunjevčit'' pejorativelly meant "become Catholic".&lt;ref name="Skok"/&gt; In the 20th century hinterland of [[Novi Vinodolski]], called as [[Krmpote]], the Primorje ([[Croatian Littoral|Littoral or Coastal]]) Bunjevci were economically less powerful rural population and hence it had an attribution of "otherness" with negative connotation by urban citizens.

The etymological derivation of their ethnonym is unknown.{{sfn|Černelić|2016|p=215}} There are several theories about the origin of their name. The most common is that the name derives from the river [[Buna River (Neretva)|Buna]] in central [[Herzegovina]],&lt;ref name="Skok"/&gt; their hypothesized ancestral homeland before their migrations. However, although preserved in Littoral and mostly in Podunavlje branch folk oral tradition, linguists generally dismissed such derivation.{{sfn|Černelić|2016|p=215}} Another theory is that the name comes from the term ''Bunja'', a traditional [[Vernacular architecture|stone house]] in Dalmatia similar to ''Kažun'' in Istria, meaning people who live in such type of houses,&lt;ref name="Laszlo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogic1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/195391?lang=en|title=Antroponimija i porijeklo stanovništva u naseljima srednjeg velebitskog Podgorja|author=Pavle Rogić|date=1966|journal=Hrvatski dijalektološki zbornik|issue=2|publisher=Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts|pages=319–321|language=Serbo-Croatian|accessdate=24 June 2018|quote=Tu su se izmiješali s tamošnjim starosjediocima, koji su ih, po svoj prilici, i prozvali Bunjevcima, kao ljude koji žive i stanuju u bunjama, tj. u primitivnim kućama, najčešće okrugla, rjeđe četvrtasta oblika, zidanih u suho i različitog od tipa primorskih kuća.}}&lt;/ref&gt; from personal name ''Bunj'' deriving from Bunislav or Bonifacije, or Romanian personal name ''Bun'' from Bonus from which derives toponym ''Bunić'' near [[Gospić]].&lt;ref name="Skok"&gt;{{cite book|title=Etimologijski rječnik hrvatskoga ili srpskoga jezika I: A–J|author=Petar Skok|author-link=Petar Skok|year=1971|publisher=[[JAZU]]|pages=237–238|language=Serbo-Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin theories===
The most common view is that the community fled western Herzegovina and Dalmatia to Vojvodina during the 17th-century Ottoman invasion, led by Franciscan monks, and was accepted in the [[Military Frontier]].{{sfn|Todosijević|2002|p=3}} The Catholic Church in Subotica celebrates 1686 as the anniversary of the Bunjevci migration, when the largest single migration did take place.{{sfn|Todosijević|2002|p=3}} According to modern historiographical studies based on archival research, there is still no consensus on their homeland, only ethnological elements indicate specific regions. It is considered to be Southwestern Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Dalmatia, from where in the 17th century migrated to Bačka and Northern Dalmatia, as well as Lika, [[Croatian Littoral|Primorje]] and [[Gorski Kotar]]. This with a political situation divided the community into four groups, Western Herzegovinian (Ottoman), Dalmatian (Venetian), Lika-Primorje (Habsburg), and [[Podunavlje]] (Hungarian), although the ethnologists often consider the first two as one group (broad Dalmatian) from which other diverged.{{sfn|Černelić|2016|p=11–12}}&lt;ref name="HE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?id=10202|title=Bunjevci|work=[[Croatian Encyclopedia]]|publisher=LZMK|accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is considered that some groups already existed since 1520 on the Triplex Confinium (the boundary between Venetian, Ottoman, and Habsburg Empire), but were not directly mentioned in historical documents, rather than were used alternative terms due to social-regional-ethnic-linguistic-cultural reasons such as [[Uskoks]], [[Morlachs]], Morlachi catolichi, Valachi catolichi and catholische Walahen, Rasciani catolichi and Katolische Ratzen (the term had transconfessional meaning&lt;ref name="Identitet"/&gt;), Iliri, Horvati, Meerkroaten, Likaner.{{sfn|Černelić|2016|p=14}}&lt;ref name="Ce2010"/&gt; In the territory of [[Croatian Military Frontier]] happened complex ethnic-demographic integrations, with Ledenice being one of the earliest examples of Croatian-Vlachian-Bunjevac integration when an anonymous priest from Senj in 1696 calls them as ''nostris Croatis'', while captain Coronini in 1697 as ''Croati venturini'', at the same time (1693), chiefs of Zdunići in Ledenice emphasized their Bunjevci (Krmpote) ancestry.&lt;ref name="Identitet"/&gt;

According to modern and most recent ethnological studies, as well anthroponymy structure,&lt;ref name="Ce2010"/&gt; Bunjevci have substantial elements of non-Slavic origin (Vlachian, Albanian) and originate from Vlachian-Croatian ethnic symbiosis of Ikavian Chakavian/Chakavian-Shtokavian language group, with some similarities to Vlachian-Montenegrin symbiosis, but both being more archaic and different to the Vlachian-Serbian symbiosis of Ekavian/Jekavian-Shtokavian group.{{sfn|Černelić|2016|p=207–218, 249}} Based on ethnological, linguistic and some historical indicators the area of origin could have been between rivers Buna in Herzegovina and [[Bojana (river)|Bunë]] in Albania, along with the Adriatic-Dinaric belt (south Dalmatia and its hinterland, Boka Kotorska Bay, the coast of Montenegro and a part of its hinterland),&lt;ref name="Ce2003"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=27797&amp;lang=en|title=Investigation of Traditional Heritage, Identity and Ethno-Genesis of Coastal Bunjevci|author=Milana Černelić|date=2003|journal=Senjski zbornik : prilozi za geografiju, etnologiju, gospodarstvo, povijest i kulturu|volume=30|issue=1|pages=407–422|language=Serbo-Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; seemingly encompassing the territory of the so-called [[Red Croatia]], regardless of the issue whether the entity is historically founded, which was partly inhabited by Croats according to Byzantine sources from 11th and 12th century.&lt;ref name="Ce2003"/&gt;{{sfn|Černelić|2016|p=215, 250–251, 255–256}} This is supported by the observed Alpine cattle-breeding among Bunjevci at Velebit Podgorje, which is a non-Dinaric type of cattle-breeding in the Dinaric mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=64067&amp;lang=en|title=Tradicijsko planinsko stočarstvo na Velebitu i bunjevačka etnogeneza|trans-title=Traditional Mountain Cattle Breeding on the Mountain of Velebit and Ethnogenesis of Bunjevci|author=Vitomir Belaj|author-link=Vitomir Belaj|date=2004|journal=Studia ethnologica Croatica|volume=16|issue=1|pages=5–31|language=Serbo-Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study about Western Balkans household and families, Austrian historian of [[historical anthropology]] Karl Kaser argued a probable Vlach origin of Bunjevci who became absorbed in Catholic Croat community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl Kaser|title=Household and Family in the Balkans: Two Decades of Historical Family|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|date=2012|page=111–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National status dispute===
Disputes over the national status of the Bunjevci go back to the nationalism wave in the 19th century in Austria-Hungary, but their "national status" remained ambiguous since, as the debate revived by the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia]] in the 1990s.{{sfn|Todosijević|2002|p=1}} It has been argued that they are Croats, Serbs, and yet another as a fourth nation of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] among the South Slavic nations.{{sfn|Todosijević|2002|p=1}} In the period between 1920 and 1930 and again in 1940, there were three types of manipulation to neutralize their Croatian nationality, primarily emphasizing their ethnic distinctiveness from both the Croats and Serbs, that can be both Croats and Serbs or it's unimportant because both are [[Yugoslavs]], and open denial of their ethnicity and religious belonging considering that Bunjevci and Šokci are Serbs of the Catholic faith.&lt;ref name="Ce1995"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=101851&amp;lang=en|title=Attempts to Deny the Bunjevci of Bačka the Rights to Belong to the Croat Nation|author=Milana Černelić|date=1995|journal=Studia ethnologica Croatica|volume=6|issue=1|pages=85–103|language=Serbo-Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third was argued by Serbian academic elite, including Aleksa Ivić, Radivoj Simonović, [[Jovan Erdeljanović]] among others, but without proper argumentation and ethnological basis, which also included unsubstantiated claims like that they got Ikavian pronunciation because of Franciscan monks influence.&lt;ref name="Ce1995"/&gt;

==History==

===Early Modern Period and Austro-Hungarian Empire===
[[File:Bunjevci migrations.png|right|thumb|250px|Map of the supposed Bunjevci migration (13th-17th century)]]
The migrations from Northern Dalmatia were influenced by Ottomans conquest in the 15th and 16th century, and the first migration to [[Croatian Littoral|Primorje]] is considered to have happened in 1605 when around 50 families from [[Krmpote|Krmpota]] near [[Zemunik Donji|Zemunik]] settled in Lič near [[Fužine, Croatia|Fužine]] by Danilo Frankol, captain of Senj, in agreement with [[Nikola VI Zrinski|Nikola]] and [[Juraj V Zrinski|Juraj Zrinski]],&lt;ref name="Rogic1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Magas"&gt;{{cite book |title=Prostor i vrijeme knezova Posedarskih: Zemljopisna obilježja i povijesni razvoj Općine Posedarje (Posedarje, Slivnica, Vinjerac, Podgradina, Islam Latinski, Ždrilo i Grgurice) |author1=Damir Magaš|author2=Josip Brtan |location=Zadar |publisher=Sveučilište u Zadru, Centar za istraživanje krša i priobalja, Odjel za geografiju, Hrvatsko geografsko društvo Zadar |year=2015 |language=Croatian |pages=117–118 |isbn=978-953-331-059-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with several waves until 1647 settling in Lič, the hinterland of Senj (Ledenice, [[Krmpote]] - Sv. Jakov, Krivi Put, Senjska draga), and some to Pag and Istria. Some also arrived during the [[Cretan War (1645–1669)]], and after the Ottomans defeat in Lika (1683–1687), some littoral Bunjevci moved to settlements in Lika, like Pazarište, [[Smiljan]], [[Gospić]]ko field, Široka Kula, valley of Ričice and Hotuče.&lt;ref name="Ce2010"/&gt; According to the common theory based on historical documents happened at least three big migrations to Podunavlje, first from the beginning of the 17th century (without Franciscan monks{{sfn|Černelić|2016|p=15}}), second in the mid 17th century during Cretan War, and third during [[Great Turkish War]] (1683–1699).{{sfn|Černelić|2016|p=15}} 

In 1788 the first Austrian population census was conducted – it called Bunjevci ''Illyrians'' and their language the Illyrian language. It listed 17,043 Illyrians in Subotica. In 1850 the Austrian census listed them under ''Dalmatians'' and counted 13,894 Dalmatians in the city. Despite this, they traditionally called themselves ''Bunjevci''. The Austro-Hungarian censuses from 1869 onward to 1910 numbered the Bunjevci distinctly. They were referred to as "bunyevácok" or "dalmátok" (in the 1890 census). In 1880 the Austro-Hungarian authorities listed in Subotica a total of 26,637 Bunjevci and 31,824 in 1892. In 1910, 35.29% of the population of the Subotica city (or 33,390 people) were registered as "others"; these people were mainly Bunjevci. In 1921 Bunjevci were registered by the Royal Yugoslav authorities as speakers of the Serbian or Croatian language – Subotica city had 60,699 speakers of Serbian or Croatian or 66.73% of the total city population. Allegedly, 44,999 or 49.47% were Bunjevci. In the 1931 population census of the Royal Yugoslav authorities, 43,832 or 44.29% of the total Subotica population were Bunjevci.

It is estimated that a few tens of thousands of Bunjevci were [[magyarization|Magyarized]] in the 19th and early 20th century. Croat national identity was adopted by some Bunjevci in the late 19th and early 20th century, especially by the majority of the Bunjevac clergy, notably one of the [[titular bishop]]s of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kalocsa-Kecskemét|Kalocsa]], [[Ivan Antunović]] (1815–1888), supported the notion of calling Bunjevci and [[Šokci]] with the name Croats.{{sfn|Todosijević|2002|p=7}} Antunović, with journalist and ethnographer Ambrozije Šarčević (1820–1899), led Bunjevci national movement in the 19th century, and in 1880 was founded the ''Bunjevačka stranka'' ("the Bunjevac party"), an indigenous political party, mostly concentrated on language rights, preservation, and ethnographic work.{{sfn|Todosijević|2002|p=9}} When their 1905 request for having police patrol and church services in the Croatian language was denied by Hungarian language policy, one group of 1,200 people converted to Orthodoxy.{{sfn|Todosijević|2002|p=9}}

===Yugoslavia===
[[File:GNOOV 1040-1945.png|left|thumb|200px|Order of the Supreme People's Liberation Board of Vojvodina from 14 May 1945, which states that Bunjevci and Šokci should be regarded as Croats, no matter of their self-declaration]]

Around the time of World War I, was argued an idea that Bunjevci were not only a distinct group but also a fourth and smallest Yugoslav nation.{{sfn|Todosijević|2002|p=9}} In October 1918, Bunjevci held a national convention in Subotica and decided to secede [[Banat, Bačka and Baranja]] from the Kingdom of Hungary and to join [[Kingdom of Serbia]]. This was confirmed at the [[1918 Novi Sad Assembly|Great National Assembly of Serbs, Bunjevci and other Slavs]] in [[Novi Sad]], which proclaimed unification with the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] in November 1918. The subsequent creation of the [[Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (renamed Yugoslavia in 1929) brought most of the Bačka Bunjevci in the same country with the Croats (with some remaining in Hungary).

Between the World Wars, the national dispute included pro-Bunjevci, pro-Croatian, and pro-Serbian position. As Bunjevci were mostly supporters of the [[Croatian Peasant Party]], and the ethnic boundary between Serbs and Croats was established on confessional line, they naturally felt closer to Croats.{{sfn|Todosijević|2002|p=10}} During the late World War II, Partisan General [[Božidar Maslarić]] spoke on the national councils in Sombor and Subotica on 6 November 1944 and General [[Ivan Rukavina]] on Christmas in Tavankut in the name of the Communist Party about the ''Croatdom of the Bunjevci''. After 1945, in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] the [[census]] of 1948 did not officially recognize the Bunjevci (nor Šokci), and instead merged their data with the Croats, even if a person would self-declare as a Bunjevac or Šokac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/drustvo/aktuelno.290.html:709833-Bunjevci-ni-zvanicno-nece-morati-da-budu-Hrvati |title= Bunjevci ni zvanično neće morati da budu Hrvati? |publisher=Večernje Novosti | date=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in local schools was used the Serbian version of the Serbo-Croatian language in Latin script, while during the 1990s even in Cyrillic script, policy interpreted as an attempt to assimilate them into the Serbian culture.{{sfn|Todosijević|2002|p=10}}

Proponents of a distinct Bunjevac ethnicity regard this time as another dark period of encroachment on their identity and feel that this assimilation did not help in the preservation of their language. The censuses of 1953 and 1961 also listed all declared Bunjevci as Croats. The 1971 population census listed the Bunjevci separately under the municipal census in Subotica upon the personal request of the organization of Bunjevci in Subotica. It listed 14,892 Bunjevci or 10.15% of the population of Subotica. Despite this, the provincial and federal authorities listed the Bunjevci as Croats, together with the Šokci and considered them that way officially at all occasions. In 1981 the Bunjevci made a similar request – it showed 8,895 Bunjevci or 5.7% of the total population of Subotica. Many, on an example of [[Donji Tavankut]], also declared as Yugoslavs.{{sfn|Todosijević|2002|p=11}}

===Contemporary period===

====Serbia====
[[File:Bikovo.jpg|right|thumb|230px|The Catholic Church in the Bunjevac village of [[Bikovo]]]]

Following the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, Bunjevac nationality was officially recognized as a minority group in Serbia in 1990.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} They were granted the status of autochthonous people in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.hri.org/news/balkans/serb/1996/96-10-01.serb.html#05 | title = Bunjevci – to be granted status of people | newspaper = [[Politika]] | date = 1996-10-01 | accessdate = 2011-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 census lived 74,808 Croats, and 21,434 Bunjevci in Vojvodina, while in the district of Subotica, there were approximately equal numbers of declared Croats and Bunjevci: 16,369 and 17,439.{{sfn|Todosijević|2002|p=11}} In the administrative area of the city of Subotica region, there were 13,553 Bunjevci and 14,151 in 2011. The historically Bunjevac village of [[Donji Tavankut]] had 1,234 Croats, 787 Bunjevci, 190 Serbs and 137 declared as Yugoslavs. A 1996 survey by the local government in Subotica found that in the community, there are many people who declare as Croats and consider themselves Bunjevci, but also some people who declare as Bunjevci but consider themselves part of the wider Croatian nation. The same survey found that the delineation between the pro-Croat and pro-Bunjevac positions correlated with the delineation between the people who were more supportive towards the then ruling regime in Serbia that did not favor special rights for national minorities, and conversely those who were against the then government and more interested in minority rights and connections with what they saw as their second homeland.{{sfn|Todosijević|2002|p=11–12}}

In early 2005, the Bunjevac issue was again popularized when the [[Vojvodina government]] decided to allow the official use of "''bunjevački'' language with elements of national culture" in schools in the following school year{{spaced ndash}} the [[Štokavian]] dialect with [[ikavian]]  pronunciation. This was protested by the Croatian Bunjevac community as an attempt of the government to widen the rift between the two Bunjevac communities. They favour integration, regardless of whether some people declared themselves distinct, because [[minority group|minority]] rights (such as the right to use a [[minority language]]) are applied based on the number of members of the minority. As opposed to this, supporters of pro-Bunjevci option are accusing Croats for attempts to assimilate Bunjevci.&lt;ref name="pravda.rs"&gt;http://www.pravda.rs/2011/02/16/srbija-progoni-bunjevce/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Bunjevac politician Blaško Gabrić and Bunjevac National Council asked Serbian authorities to start juristic criminal responsibility procedure against those Croats who denying the existence of Bunjevci ethnicity, which is, according to them, violation of laws and constitution of the Republic of Serbia.&lt;ref name="pravda.rs"/&gt;

Today, both major parts of the community (the pro-independent Bunjevac one and the pro-Croatian one) continue to consider themselves [[ethnology|ethnologically]] as Bunjevci, although each subscribing to its interpretation of the term.

====Hungary====
In Hungary, Bunjevci are not officially recognized as a minority; the government simply consider them Croats. In April 2006 a Bunjevci group began collecting subscriptions to register Bunjevci as a distinct minority group. In Hungary, 1,000 valid subscriptions are needed to register an ethnic minority with historical presence. By the end of the given 60 days period, the initiative gained over 2,000 subscriptions of which cca. 1,700 were declared valid by national vote office and [[Hungarian Parliament Building|Budapest parliament]] gained a deadline of 9 January 2007 to solve the situation by approving or refusing the proposal. No other such initiative has reached that level ever since minority bill passed in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.index.hu/Article/showArticle?na_start=0&amp;na_step=30&amp;t=9130749&amp;na_order= Nemzetiségi elismerést a bunyevácoknak – Index Fórum&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 December the [[National Assembly of Hungary]] refused to accept the initiative (with 334 No and 18 Yes votes). The decision was based on the study of the [[Hungarian Academy of Science]] that denied the existence of an independent Bunjevac minority (they stated that Bunjevci are a Croatian subgroup). The opposition of Croatian minority leaders also played part in the outcome of the vote,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mkogy.hu/internet/plsql/ogy_irom.irom_adat?p_ckl=38&amp;p_izon=960 Iromány adatai&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the opinion of Hungarian Academy of Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.croatica.hu/fileadmin/glasnik/2007/glasnik03internet.pdf |title=Hrvatski glasnik br.3 }} Odbijena narodna inicijativa... , Jan 18, 2007&amp;nbsp;{{small|(714KB)}}{{hr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==

===Serbia===
[[File:Vojvodina south slavs.png|thumb|250px|Bunjevci in Vojvodina (2002 census)]]
In [[Serbia]], Bunjevci live in Autonomous Province of [[Vojvodina]], mostly in the northern part of [[Bačka]] region. The community, however, has been divided around the issue of the ethnic affiliation: in the 2011 census, in terms of ethnicity, 16,706 inhabitants of Vojvodina self-declared as Bunjevci and 47,033 as [[Croats of Serbia|Croats]]. Not all of the Croats in Vojvodina have Bunjevac roots; the other big group are [[Šokci]].

The largest concentration of Bunjevci in Serbia (9,235) is in the ethnically mixed city of [[Subotica]], which is their cultural and political center. Another significant urban center of Bunjevac people is the city of [[Sombor]] (1,629). Villages with a significant population of Bunjevci are all located in the administrative area of the city of Subotica:

*[[Ljutovo]]
*[[Bikovo]]
*[[Gornji Tavankut]]
*[[Donji Tavankut]]
*[[Đurđin]]
*[[Mala Bosna]]
*[[Stari Žednik]]
*[[Bajmok]]

==Culture==
[[File:Bunjevacke igre.jpg|right|thumb|230px|Bunjevci national costumes and dance]]
The cultural center of Danube Bunjevci from Bačka is the city of Subotica in Serbia, in Bács-Kiskun is Baja (those in Szeged became extinct as a distinct ethnic group due to assimilation),&lt;ref name="Laszlo"/&gt; while of littoral or coastal Bunjevci is the city of [[Senj]]. As the former live in a region inhabited by a population of the same nationality, they are far more assimilated, show less appreciation for traditional clothing and heritage due to external factors, but although mostly aware of their identity there's indifference for connection to other Bunjevci branches in Lika and Danube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=8012&amp;lang=en|title=Approaches to the Research of the Identity of the Ethnic Group of Bunjevci|author=Milana Černelić|date=2005|journal=Studia ethnologica Croatica|volume=17|issue=1|pages=25–49|language=Serbo-Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, Bunjevci of Bačka are associated with land and farming. Large, usually isolated farms in Northern Bačka called ''[[salaš]]i'' are a significant part of their identity. Most of their customs celebrate the land, harvest, horse-breeding, and their most important feasts (other than Christmas and weddings) are:

* ''[[Dužijanca]]''{{spaced ndash}} celebration of harvest end, and the most famous festival as well as a tourist attraction. It consists of several events held in Bunjevci-populated places ([[Bajmok]], [[Donji Tavankut]], [[Gornji Tavankut]]), with the central celebration held in Subotica. ''Dužijanca'' includes religious celebrations devoted to harvesting, street [[procession]] and performing of Bunjevci folklore and music.
* ''[[Slava|Krsno ime]]''{{spaced ndash}} a celebration of a [[patron saint]] of the family.{{dubious|date=November 2011}}
* ''Kraljice''{{spaced ndash}} ceremonial processions held on [[Pentecost]].
* ''Divan''{{spaced ndash}} a meeting of young boys and girls for singing and dancing in a place far from their parents. The custom has been forbidden by church authorities already in the mid-19th century.

''[http://www.bunjevci.com/novine/ Bunjevačke novine]'' ("Bunjevac newspaper") is the main newspaper in Bunjevac dialect, published in [[Subotica]].

'''Burunge''' is an [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] language spoken in [[Tanzania]] in the [[Dodoma Region]], by the [[Burunge people]], a small "group" of about 13,000 native speakers that live in the Northeastern region of Tanzania. The Burunge belong to a cluster of Tanzanian groups known as Southern Cushites, which also categorizes Burunge as part of the [[South Cushitic languages|South Cushitic language family]].&lt;ref name="Lamberti, M. 1991"&gt;Lamberti, M. (1991). Cushitic and its classifications. ''Anthropos'', (H. 4./6), 552-561.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Burunge live in close proximity to other languages such as the Rangi, Gogo and Sandawe, and ultimately, their language and culture is endangered by dwindling number of speakers and absorption by larger tribes.

== Name ==
Burunge is a language spoken by a clan of peoples of the same name, and it belongs to a larger "Cushtic" language family which is one of the most largest and most important in East Africa. Thirty million people in the region trace their native language back to the Cushitic language family.&lt;ref name="Lamberti, M. 1991"/&gt;

Burunge has various alternate names: Bulunge, Burunga Iso, Burungee, Burungi, Kiburunge, Mbulungi, Mbulungwe. Burunge has no known dialects, but it does share a high similarity with the Alagwa language - a different Cushitic language spoken in the same Dodoma Region as Burunge.

== History ==
The modern use of the term "Cushite" is used to describe the cultural descendants of ancient cultures in northeastern Africa. The heritage of these descendants is traced back through languages that are descended from their ancient ancestors. Thus, the term "Cushite" is a linguistic grouping rather than a racial or cultural designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://strategyleader.org/articles/cushite.htm|title=A Summary of the Cushite Peoples of Eastern Africa|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method of characterization allows for a more clear cut historical lineage than just identifying by cultural groups. Therefore, peoples of Cushite heritage are those who speak languages of the Cushite grouping of the Afro-Asiatic family, and as a result of this categorization or clustering on the basis of language, the Cushitic peoples can exhibit diverse physical and racial features.

The Burunge belong to the Southern Cushites in Tanzania; their ancestors are believed to have originated from Southern Ethiopia and migrated into the northeastern region of Tanzania around 1000 BC. After migration into Tanzania, the ancient Burunge culture centered on subsistence farming and cattle grazing. Although the Burunge originally came from the region of what is now Ethiopia, there is a marked difference between the languages of the Southern Cushites in Tanzania and the Cushites of Southern Ethiopia which suggests that a long period of isolation and linguistic differentiation has occurred between the Burunge migration and present day.

== Land ==
Burunge native speakers are native to northeastern Tanzania, in the Kondoa district of the Dodoma region, southeast of the Langi, Goima, Chambalo, and Mirambu villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/bds|title=Burunge|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The land in this region is generally described as scattered brush, and the  Burunge have historically used the land for farming and cattle grazing and watering. In more recent times this has changed as land has been privatized in order to form Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs) - these are areas that are to be used solely for wildlife conservation, and as such are off limits to farmers who used to graze and water their livestock in these areas.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, M. J., &amp; Riosmena, F. (2013). Adaptive capacity in Tanzanian Maasailand: Changing strategies to cope with drought in fragmented landscapes. ''Global Environmental Change'', ''23''(3), 588-597.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of the formation of the Wildlife Management Areas, and the close proximity to Tarangire National Park, most of the land in this area is used for tourism safaris.

== Present Day ==
Burunge both as a language and distinct designation of peoples are in danger of disappearing as a result of the dominance of Swahili in Tanzania, the small population of Burunge speakers, and also the Burunge clan of approximately thirteen thousand being absorbed into stronger, more populous clans. The Rangi is one such clan; they are a neighboring clan with their own specific language, and not only do they have a larger population than the Burunge, they are also more economically advantaged. The Rangi have subgroup "clubs" within their clan, that male members of the Burungee can officially join to become a member of the Rangi clan. Once someone is a member, they have to shed their identity as a Burunge and become completely Rangi by marrying a Rangi woman and raising their children as Rangi.&lt;ref&gt;Stegen, O. (2003, June). How does their language survive?. In ''talk presented at the meeting of the Language in Context Research Group, University of Edinburgh''.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Burunge have joined the Rangi this way over the past few decades, so it is unclear if Burunge as a people and language group will continue to exist as a distinct and separate culture, as the new generations born of both Burunge and Rangi heritage will be seen as and taught only Rangi language and culture.

'''Business economics''' is a field in [[applied economics]] which uses [[economic theory]] and quantitative methods to analyze [[Business|business enterprises]] and the factors contributing to the diversity of organizational structures and the relationships of firms with labour, [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and product markets.&lt;ref name="Moschandreas"&gt;Moschandreas, Maria (2000). ''Business Economics'', 2nd Edition, Thompson Learning,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=ncVfjhTULyAC&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PA410#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Description] and chapter-preview [https://books.google.com/books?id=ncVfjhTULyAC&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PR5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false links].&lt;/ref&gt; A professional focus of the journal ''[[Business Economics (journal)|Business Economics]]'' has been expressed as providing "practical information for people who apply economics in their jobs."&lt;ref&gt;National Association for Business Economics, ''[http://www.nabe.com/busecon.htm ''Business Economics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111082746/http://www.nabe.com/busecon.htm |date=November 11, 2011 }}''®&lt;/ref&gt;
Business economics is an integral part of traditional economics. It is an extension of economic concepts to the real business situations. It is an applied science in the sense of a tool of managerial decision-making and forward planning by management. In other words, Business economics is concerned with the application of economic theory to business management.

==Subject matter==
Business economics is concerned with economic issues and problems related to business organization, management, and strategy. Issues and problems include: an explanation of why ''corporate'' firms emerge and exist; why they expand: horizontally, vertically and spacially; the role of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship; the significance of organizational structure; the relationship of firms with the employees, the providers of capital, the customers, the government; the interactions between firms and the business environment.&lt;ref name="Moschandreas"/&gt;

==Ambiguity in the use of term==
The term 'business economics' is used in a variety of ways.  Sometimes it is used as synonymously with industrial economics/[[industrial organisation]], [[managerial economics]], and economics for business. Still, there may be substantial differences in the usage of 'economics for business' and 'managerial economics' with the latter used more narrowly.
One view of the distinctions between these would be that business economics is wider in its scope than industrial economics in that it would be concerned not only with "industry" but also businesses in the service sector. Economics for business looks at the major principles of economics but focuses on applying these economic principles to the real world of business.&lt;ref&gt;Sloman, J and Sutcliffe (2004) Economics for Business, Financial Times/ Prentice Hall; 3 edition&lt;/ref&gt; Managerial economics is the application of economic methods in the managerial decision-making process.&lt;ref&gt;• Jones, Trefor, 2004 ''Business Economics and Managerial Decision Making'', Wiley.

== Interpretations from various universities ==
Many universities offer courses in business economics and offer a range of interpretations as to the meaning of the word.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uel.ac.uk/programmes/business/undergraduate/summary/businesseco.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bachelor of Business Economics (BBE) Program at [[University of Delhi]] is designed to meet the growing need for an analytical and quantitative approach to problem solving in the changing corporate world by the application of the latest techniques evolved in the fields of economics and business.&lt;ref&gt;http://du.ac.in/du/index.php?page=business-economics-2&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Autonomous University of Barcelona]] (UAB), the [[Universidad Pública de Navarra]] (UPNa) and the [[University of the Balearic Islands]] (UIB) developed an official Master of Science in Management, Organization and Business Economics focused on management and business topics to train professionals in the study of organizations, on a conceptual and quantitative basis. To achieve this, advanced analysis tools are used from the fields of [[Neoclassical economics]], [[New institutional economics]], [[Statistics]], [[Econometrics]] and [[Operations research]]. This focus is complemented with contributing ideas and theories to develop the necessary instruments to facilitate the management of sophisticated and complex organizations.&lt;ref&gt;UAB,UPNa, UIB - Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Management, Organization and Business Economics - MMOBE Program. [http://pagines.uab.cat/mmobe/ Link]&lt;/ref&gt;

The program at [[Harvard University]] uses economic methods to analyze practical aspects of business, including [[business administration]], management, and related fields of business economics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gsas.harvard.edu/programs_of_study/business_economics_4.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Miami]] defines business economics as involving the study of how we use our resources for the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services.  This requires business economists to analyze social institutions, banks, the stock market, the government and their relationships with labor negotiations, taxes, international trade, and urban and environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.miami.muohio.edu/academics/majorsminors/majors/businesseconomics.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725091346/http://www.miami.muohio.edu/academics/majorsminors/majors/businesseconomics.cfm |archivedate=2009-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Courses at the [[University of Manchester]] interpret business economics to be concerned with the economic analysis of how businesses contribute to welfare of society rather than on the welfare of an individual or a business. This is done via an examination of the relationship between ownership, control and firm objectives; theories of the growth of the firm; the behavioural [[theory of the firm]]; theories of entrepreneurship; the factors that influence the [[Structure-conduct-performance paradigm|structure, conduct and performance]] of business at the industry level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socialsciences.manchester.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/modules/modulelist.html?department%3D3%26newcode%3DECON2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224053759/http://www.socialsciences.manchester.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/modules/modulelist.html?department=3&amp;newcode=ECON2 |archivedate=2008-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian Universities borrow their concept of business economics from the tradition of [[Gino Zappa]], for example a standard course&lt;ref&gt;https://www11.ceda.polimi.it/schedaincarico/schedaincarico/controller/scheda_pubblica/SchedaPublic.do?&amp;evn_default=evento&amp;c_classe=618079&amp;__pj0=0&amp;__pj1=6f3356db456e221b165cf3ee421a14ec&lt;/ref&gt;  at the [[Politecnico di Milano]] involves studying [[corporate governance]], [[accounting]], [[investment analysis]], [[budgeting]] and [[business strategy]].

[[La Trobe University]] of Melbourne, Australia associates business economics with the process of demand, supply and equilibrium coordinating the behaviour of individuals and businesses in the market. Also, business economics extends to government policy, economic variables and international factors which influence business and competition.

'''Camping Unlimited''' is the organization that runs '''Camp Krem''', a camp in the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]] that caters to [[disabled]] adults and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://campingunlimited.org|website=Camping Unlimited|accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camp Krem provides year-round programs nearly every weekend and summer camp sessions ranging from 7 to 12 days long. In the summer, Camp Krem has a main camp, an Outdoor Adventure Camp, and a Travel Camp that travels throughout California and the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Summer camp overview|url=http://campingunlimited.org/summer-camp/|website=Camping Unlimited|accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The camp is located in [[Boulder Creek, California]].

== History ==

Camping Unlimited is a foundation started by Alex Krem in 1961. Krem, originally a chemist, became a [[special education]] teacher and took some of his kids camping in his backyard. Because of the success of these trips, he expanded his program and bought 45 acres of land in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission and history|url=http://campingunlimited.org/us/mission-history/|website=Camping Unlimited|accessdate=4 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906214329/http://campingunlimited.org/us/mission-history/#|archive-date=2015-09-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Camp Activities ==

At Camp Krem, campers participate in a variety of activities. According to the [[American Camp Association]], some of these activities include:
* Acting

== Vision, Mission, and Values ==

Camp Krem aims to provide a caring, outdoor environment where children and adults of all developmental disabilities can feel comfortable, safe, and able to try new things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission and history|url=http://campingunlimited.org/us/mission-history/|website=Camping unlimited|accessdate=4 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906214329/http://campingunlimited.org/us/mission-history/#|archive-date=2015-09-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camp Krem also provides respite for the caretakers of their campers. Some of the disabilities include, but are not limited to, Aspergers, Autism, Cerebral Palsy, Down Syndrome, intellectual disabilities, mobility limitations, and Prader-Willi Syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Camp krem- camping unlimited- camp krem summer camp|url=http://find.acacamps.org/program_profile.php?back=search&amp;program_id=304|website=American Camp Association|accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the goals of Camp Krem is to provide "planned permissiveness." This means that campers who do not want to participate in a certain activity do not have to because they are on vacation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission and history|url=http://campingunlimited.org/us/mission-history/|website=Camping unlimited|accessdate=4 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906214329/http://campingunlimited.org/us/mission-history/#|archive-date=2015-09-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title}}
'''Defender of the Faith''' ([[Latin]]: ''Fidei defensor'' (feminine: ''Fidei defensatrix''); [[French (language)|French]]: ''Défenseur de la Foi'') is a phrase that has been used as part of the full [[Royal and noble styles|style]] of many English and later British monarchs since the early 16th century. It has also been used by some other monarchs and heads of state.

==English, later British, usage==

===History===
[[File:1555 gold medal Queen Mary I of England.jpg|thumb|Medal of Queen Mary I with the legend "Maria I Reg. Angl. Franc. et Hib. Fidei Defensatrix"]]
"''Defender of the Faith''" has been one of the subsidiary titles of the English and later British monarchs since it was granted on 11 October 1521&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/155661/defender-of-the-faith|title=defender of the faith – English royal title|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Pope Leo X]] to King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] of [[England]] and [[Ireland]]. His wife [[Catherine of Aragon]] was also a Defender of the Faith in her own right.&lt;ref&gt;Antonia Fraser, ''The Wives of Henry VIII'', page 95&lt;/ref&gt; The title was conferred in recognition of Henry's book ''[[Defense of the Seven Sacraments|Assertio Septem Sacramentorum]]'' (''Defense of the Seven Sacraments''), which defended the sacramental nature of [[marriage]] and the supremacy of the [[Pope]]. This was also known as the "Henrician Affirmation" and was seen as an important opposition to the early stages of the [[Protestant Reformation]], especially the ideas of [[Martin Luther]].

Following Henry's decision to break with [[Roman Catholic Church|Rome]] in 1530 and establish himself as head of the [[Church of England]], the title was revoked by [[Pope Paul III]] (since Henry's act was regarded as an attack on "the Faith") and Henry was [[excommunication|excommunicated]]. However, in 1544,{{citation needed|date=July 2010}} the [[Parliament of England]] conferred the title "''Defender of the Faith''" on King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and his successors, now the defenders of the [[Anglican]] faith, of which they (except the Catholic [[Mary I of England|Mary I]]) remain the [[Supreme Governor]]s (formally above the Archbishop of Canterbury as [[Primate (bishop)|Primate]]).

King [[James V of Scotland|James V]] of [[Scotland]] was granted the title of Defender of the Faith by [[Pope Paul III]] on 19 January 1537, symbolizing the hopes of the papacy that the King of Scots would resist the path that his uncle, Henry VIII, had followed.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, Jamie, ''James V'', Tuckwell (1998), 288.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hay, Denys, ed., ''Letters of James V'', HMSO (1954), 328.&lt;/ref&gt; James' father, James IV, had been granted the title of "Protector and Defender of the Christian Faith" by [[Pope Julius II]] in 1507.&lt;ref&gt;Macdougall, Norman, ''James IV'', Tuckwell (1997); pp. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Neither title became part of the full style of the [[monarch of Scotland]].

During [[The Protectorate]] (1653–59), the [[republicanism|republican]] heads of state [[Oliver Cromwell]] and [[Richard Cromwell]], more clearly profiled as Protestant than the Monarchy, although claiming [[divine sanction]], did not adopt the [[Royal and noble styles|style]] "''Defender of the Faith''". The style was reintroduced after the [[English Restoration|restoration]] of the monarchy and remains in use to this day.

===Modern usage===
In her capacity as queen of the [[United Kingdom]], [[Elizabeth II]] is [[Royal and noble styles|styled]] "Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], Defender of the Faith". The title "Defender of the Faith" reflects the Sovereign's position as the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]], who is thus formally superior to the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. The original Latin phrase ''Fidei Defensor'' is represented on all current [[British coinage|British coins]] by the abbreviations, '''&lt;small&gt;F D&lt;/small&gt;''' or '''&lt;small&gt;FID DEF&lt;/small&gt;'''. This notation was first added to British coins in 1714, during the reign of King [[George I of England|George I]]. The decision of the [[Royal Mint]] to omit this and certain other parts of the monarch's style from the "[[Florin (British coin)|Godless Florin]]" in 1849 caused such a scandal that the coin was replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qns.org.au/Articles/SWA_Agnostic/SWA_Agnostic.htm |title=Agnostic Coinage |author=Stephen Appleton |publisher=Queensland Numismatic Society |date=September 2001 |accessdate=2007-08-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829052932/http://qns.org.au/Articles/SWA_Agnostic/SWA_Agnostic.htm |archivedate=2007-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most [[Commonwealth realm]]s, the phrase does not appear in the Monarch's full style, though the initial "[[By the Grace of God]]" is maintained. For example, in [[Australia]], Queen Elizabeth is currently styled "by the Grace of God, Queen of Australia and Her other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth". She is additionally styled "Defender of the Faith" only in Canada, [[New Zealand]] and the UK. [[Canada]] chose to include the phrase not because the sovereign is regarded as the protector of the state religion (Canada has none), but as a defender of faith in general. In a speech to the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] in [[1953 in Canada|1953]], [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Louis St. Laurent]] stated:

{{quote|The rather more delicate question arose about the retention of the words, "Defender of the Faith". In England there is an established church. In our countries [the other monarchies of the Commonwealth] there are no established churches, but in our countries there are people who have faith in the direction of human affairs by an all-wise providence, and we felt that it was a good thing that the civil authorities would proclaim that their organisation is such that it is a defence of the continued beliefs in a supreme power that orders the affairs of mere men, and that there could be no reasonable objection from anyone who believed in the Supreme Being in having the sovereign, the head of the civil authority, described as a believer in and a defender of the faith in a supreme ruler.|Louis St Laurent}}

However, the style used on Canadian coinage is simply D.G. Regina (''Dei Gratia Regina'', "By the Grace of God, Queen").

In Australia, the monarch held the title "Defender of the Faith" until 1973, when it was formally removed. (The words "by the Grace of God" were retained, however.)&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Roy (2013). In God They Trust?, p. 168. Bible Society Australia, Canberra.&lt;/ref&gt;

At various times, some countries of the Commonwealth retained the title until they formally became republics, e.g. [[South Africa]] from 29 May 1953. Others dropped it even sooner, e.g. in 1953, while still a dominion of the Commonwealth (until 1956), [[Pakistan]] dropped the title in recognition of the contradiction between its overwhelmingly [[Islam|Muslim]] population and having a monarch as the defender of the [[Christianity|Christian]] faith.

[[Charles, Prince of Wales]], the present heir apparent, expressed a preference to change the spirit of this role should he succeed to the throne as expected. He commented in 1994, "I personally would rather see [my future role] as Defender of Faith, not ''the'' Faith", and clarified in 2015 that "while at the same time being Defender of the Faith you can also be protector of faiths".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Haiti===
In 1811, when he proclaimed himself king, [[Henri Christophe|Henri I]] of [[Haiti]] awarded himself the title, "''Défenseur de la Foi''", and incorporated it into his [[Royal and noble styles|full style]], which translates from the [[French language|French]] original as: By the grace of God and the constitutional law of the state, King of Haiti, Sovereign of [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortuga]], [[Gonâve Island|Gonâve]] and other adjacent Islands, Destroyer of Tyranny, Regenerator and Benefactor of the Haitian Nation, Creator of her Moral, Political and Martial Institutions, First Crowned Monarch of the New World, ''Defender of the Faith'', founder of the Royal and Military Order of Saint-Henry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Haiti.htm|title=World Statesmen – Haiti|author=|publisher=worldstatesmen.org|date=|accessdate=2007-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dual-track system''' is an [[economic system]] in which the [[government]] controls key sectors of the [[economy]], while allowing [[private enterprise]] limited control over the other sectors.&lt;ref&gt;1981: Dual-track Price System -- China.org.cn.&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, the government followed dual-track pricing, known as "''shuangguizhi''" in Chinese. State-controlled (planned) prices, which were lower, accompanied the market prices, which were higher. This was done to ensure stability and gradual opening of markets (instead of a "big bang" strategy of sudden transformation to capitalism that was attempted in Eastern Europe and Russia). However, to provide incentive to the State-owned Enterprises, government allowed selling of the products at market prices after the planned targets had been met.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Naughton, "The Chinese Economy" (MIT Press, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 2003, and in response to the threat of federal funding loss due to unacceptable levels of dust pollution in the [[Las Vegas Valley]] (which then were in violation of US [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] policy), the "Dusty" character and its associated campaigns were created by Nevada-based agency Thomas Puckett&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thomaspuckett.com/portfolio/air-quality/ |title=Thomas Puckett: Clark County Department of Air Quality &amp; Environmental Management |publisher=Thomas Puckett |date= |accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in conjunction with the [[Clark County, Nevada]] Department of Air Quality &amp; Environmental Management.

Within three years the campaign succeeded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.co.clark.nv.us/public_communications/news_releases/070103_air_quality.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828023817/http://www.co.clark.nv.us/public_communications/news_releases/070103_air_quality.htm |title=County Air Quality Hits Major Milestone: Aggressive Dust Control Measures Successful in Keeping Air Clean |publisher=Clark County, Nevada (Official) |archivedate=3 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; in raising awareness of dust and its serious contribution to the Las Vegas Valley air pollution issue. $1.2-million in dust violation and other pollutant-related fines were channeled to the local school district during the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2007/Jan-04-Thu-2007/news/11774909.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129050921/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2007/Jan-04-Thu-2007/news/11774909.html |title='Dusty the Dusthole' Successful: Clark County Meets Federal Air Quality Standard Three Years Straight |publisher=The Las Vegas Review-Journal |archivedate=4 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Dusthole-watertruck-2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Water truck silkscreen bearing Clark County Nevada "Dusty the Dusthole" mascot, 2004]] --&gt;

Within a decade, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] declared the Las Vegas Valley "clean," meeting US federal standards for airborne dust particles. The ''"Don't Be a Dusthole"'' campaign---by then retired---was cited as a positive contributing factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/water-environment/epa-says-dust-has-settled-las-vegas |title=EPA Says Dust Has Settled in Las Vegas |publisher=The Las Vegas Review-Journal |date=1 October 2014 |accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The "Dusty" character was so pervasive in the state of Nevada that [[off-roading]] groups defended themselves against the new awareness and scrutiny, having lost some of their longstanding travel privileges as result of Dusty's ubiquitous presence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jeep.meetup.com/225/about/ About Jeep Thrills in Las Vegas - Jeep Thrills in Las Vegas (Las Vegas, NV) - Meetup.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|We need to provide a visible counterpoint to the image of "Dusty the Dusthole" which many people in the general public equate with off-roaders thanks to some very aggressive PR and billboard campaigns. The other side on this issue is spending a lot of money to demonize us and while we might not have the same deep pockets ourselves, we can get out there and raise public awareness in a more positive manner.}}

Conversely, the Las Vegas area media declared the Dusthole character "(not) such a bad guy after all",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalcollections.mypubliclibrary.com/c/Henderson-Home-News/view/download/5489/?download=true&amp;file=2007-01-11+-+Henderson+Home+Ne.pdf |title=Valley Lauded for Dust Control |publisher=Henderson Home News via MPL Digital Collections |date=17 January 2007 |accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; having saved the State of Nevada from a $280-million loss of funds thanks to the precipitous drop in dust and other pollutants from the time of the campaign's inception.

==Dusthole==
The "Dusty the Dusthole" character was portrayed by lifelong Las Vegas resident Alan Burd. In the Dusthole ad campaign's opening years, Burd was a common sight at various fairs and functions as the Dusty character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://viewnews.com/2004/VIEW-Jun-16-Wed-2004/East/24077053.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050115202900/http://viewnews.com/2004/VIEW-Jun-16-Wed-2004/East/24077053.html |title=Actor Nothing Like His Dusty Character |publisher=The Las Vegas Review-Journal: View |archivedate=16 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, a bi-weekly [[Capitol Hill]]-based publication from [[National Association of Counties]] featured the Dusty character in a [[word search]] puzzle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/sites/default/files/documents/CNews_Dec15_2014.pdf |title=Vol. 46, No. 24 - Word Search (Page 6) |publisher=National Association of Counties |date=15 December 2014 |accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ethnic Chinese in Mongolia''' can be subdivided into three groups: Mongolian citizens of ethnic Chinese background, [[temporary resident]]s with Chinese citizenship, and permanent residents with Chinese citizenship.
Mongolia's 1956 census counted [[Han Chinese|ethnic Chinese]] as 1.9% of the population; the United States government estimated their proportion to be 2% in 1987, or roughly 40,000 people.&lt;ref name="LOC"&gt;{{harvnb|LOC|1989|loc=[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+mn0052) Ch. 2.3.2]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2000 census showed 1,323 permanent residents of Chinese descent; this figure does not include naturalised citizens, temporary residents, nor illegal immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Batbayar|2006|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Illegal immigrants]] from China were estimated at 10,000 in the 1990s; some use Mongolia as a transit point into [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bedeski|1999|loc=Mongolia--A Demographic Buffer?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ming dynasty==
The Liaodong Han Chinese military frontiersmen were prone to mixing and acculturating with (non-Han) tribesmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederic E.

Han Chinese soldiers served in the Yuan army against the Ming, and the Mongols were joined by many Chinese defectors. The Mongol Mangui served in the Ming military and fought the Manchus, dying in battle against a Manchu raid. Some Chinese who lived among the Mongols of Inner Mongolians, while in their youth, adopted Mongol culture and married a Mongol women but when he became old he would come back and lived with the Han Chinese again. One Han Chinese military officer who defected to the Mongols was "Monkey Li" (Li Huai) who fought against the Ming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederic E.

==Qing Dynasty==
Historically, the [[Gobi Desert|Gobi]] served as a barrier to large-scale Chinese settlement in what was, before 1921, called [[Outer Mongolia]]; the unsuitability of most of the territory for [[agriculture in Mongolia|agriculture]] made settlement less attractive. Some Chinese settlements in Mongolia were founded in 1725, when farmers moved there by decree of the [[Qing Dynasty]] to grow food for soldiers fighting the [[Dzungars]]. They were established in the [[Orkhon River|Orkhon]] and [[Tuul River|Tuul]] river basins, and in 1762, in the [[Khovd (city)|Khovd]] region. After the fighting ended, the Qing closed off Mongolia to immigration&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Batbayar|2006|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; and occasionally evicted Chinese merchants.

Despite those restrictions, Chinese trade firms continually penetrated the country, concentrating mainly in [[Ulaanbaatar|Ikh Khüree]], [[Uliastai]], [[Khovd (city)|Khovd]] and [[Kyakhta]]. Their trade practices and the lifestyle of the Mongolian nobility lead to an ever-increasing indebtedness of the banners, nobles, and ordinary people, and Chinese businesses became a target of public discontent as early as [[Chingünjav]]'s uprising in 1756. The spill-over from the [[Dungan revolt (1862–1877)|Dungan rebellions]] of the 1870s into Mongolia also saw a number of Chinese businesses in Khovd and Uliastai destroyed. Many of the Chinese merchants lived in Mongolia only seasonally or until they had made enough money to return to China. Others took Mongolian wives, at least for the time of being in Mongolia.

In 1906, the [[Qing Dynasty]] began to implement policies aimed at a Han-Chinese colonization of Outer Mongolia along the lines of those in Inner Mongolia, but these policies never took full effect because the Dynasty collapsed and Mongolia declared independence in 1911. The total Han Chinese population at that time, mainly consisting of traders and artisans, but also of some colonists, can be estimated to have been at some ten thousand.{{fact|date=May 2017}}

==Since 1911==
[[File:First Day Russian Post in Mongolia Urga 1915.jpg|thumb| A 1915 cover, red band from [[Ulaanbaatar|Urga]] to [[Beijing]], written by Chinese merchant.]]
Upon [[Mongolia]]'s declaration of independence, many Chinese became victims of atrocities,{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} particularly in [[Khovd (city)|Khovd]]. However, after 1912, Chinese businesses were able to continue their operations, including collection of debts, largely unimpeded. It was only the establishment of communism that meant an end to Chinese trade in Mongolia. Ever-increasing obstacles to commerce were created, and the closure of the border to China for imports in 1928 meant an end for Chinese enterprise in the country.

With the [[People's Republic of China]] development aid projects of the 1950s, many Han Chinese entered Mongolia, beginning in 1955. By 1961, they had reached a number of 20,000. However, after the [[Sino-Soviet split]] in the early 1960s, in which Mongolia sided with the Soviets, China eventually withdrew most of its workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/ACF4CA.pdf|author=Sergey Radchenko|title=The Soviets' Best Friend in Asia|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Mongolian politicians or academicians with alleged links to China (e.g. Ts. Lookhuuz or G. Sükhbaatar) became victims of political purges. In the early 1980s, Ulan Bator was reported to have a small Chinese community, which published a Chinese-language newspaper and which looked to the Chinese embassy there for moral support. However, in 1983, Mongolia systematically began expelling some of the remaining 7,000 Chinese contract workers in Mongolia to China. At the same time, ethnic Chinese who had become naturalized citizens were reported to be unaffected. Because the presence and the status of Chinese residents in Mongolia were politically sensitive subjects, Mongolian sources usually avoided mentioning the Chinese at all.&lt;ref name="LOC"/&gt;

After the introduction of [[democracy]], another wave of Chinese immigrants has entered the country. Many of the migrants work in the construction sector, while others run small or medium enterprises. Negative sentiment against Chinese migrants remains;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Sinophobia-Anxiety-Violence-Mongolian-Identity/dp/082483982X|title=Sinophobia: Anxiety, Violence, and the Making of Mongolian Identity|last=Bille|first=Franck|date=2014-12-30|publisher=Univ of Hawaii Pr|isbn=9780824839826|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; China is seen as a potential threat to Mongolia's security and cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0WDP/is_2005_April_11/ai_n13601320|title=Anti-Chinese sentiment swelling in Mongolia|date=2005-04-11|accessdate=2007-02-23|periodical=Asian Economic News}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all recent immigrants from China are ethnic [[Han Chinese]]; in particular, there is a number of [[ethnic Mongols in China|Inner Mongolians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Uradyn|1998|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant proportion of the Fula – a third, or an estimated 12 to 13 million&lt;ref name=levinsonfula/&gt; – are [[pastoralism|pastoralists]], making them the ethnic group with the largest [[nomad]]ic pastoral community in the world.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Africa"/&gt;&lt;ref name=levinsonladdi&gt;{{cite book|author=David Levinson|title=Encyclopedia of World Cultures: Africa and the Middle East, Volume 9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JcDMrQEACAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Gale Group|isbn=978-0-8161-1808-3|chapter=Fulani }}, Quote: The Fulani form the largest pastoral nomadic group in the world.

The Fulas are leaders in many West African countries. These include the president of Nigeria, [[Muhammadu Buhari]]; the President of Senegal, [[Macky Sall]]; the President of Gambia, [[Adama Barrow]]; and the Vice President of Sierra Leone, [[Mohamed Juldeh Jalloh]]. They are also leaders in International Institutions such as the [[Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations]], [[Amina J. Mohammed]]; and Secretary General of [[OPEC]], [[Mohammed Sanusi Barkindo]].

==Names==
[[File:1997 275-27 Wodaabe fashion.jpg|thumb|left|A Bodaado (singular of Wadaabe) Fula man]]
There are many names (and spellings of the names) used in other languages to refer to the ''Fulɓe''. '''Fulani''' in English is borrowed from the [[Hausa language|Hausa]] term.&lt;ref&gt;The [[homonym]] "''Fulani''" is also used by the Manding peoples, being the diminutive form of the word ''Fula'' in their language (with suffix ''-ni''), essentially meaning "little Fula".&lt;/ref&gt; '''Fula''', from [[Manding languages]], is also used in English, and sometimes spelled '''Fulah''' or '''Fullah'''. Fula and Fulani are commonly used in English, including within Africa. The French borrowed the [[Wolof language|Wolof]] term ''Pël'', which is variously spelled: '''Peul''', '''Peulh''', and even '''Peuhl'''. More recently the [[Fula language|Fulfulde / Pulaar]] term ''Fulɓe'', which is a plural noun (singular, ''Pullo'') has been [[Anglicised]] as '''Fulbe''',&lt;ref&gt;The letter "'''[[ɓ]]'''" is an implosive b sound, which does not exist in English, so is replaced by "'''b'''." In the [[orthography for languages of Guinea (pre-1985)]], this sound was represented by '''[[Bh (digraph)|bh]]''', so one would have written ''Fulbhe'' instead of ''Fulɓe''.&lt;/ref&gt; which is gaining popularity in use. In Portuguese, the terms Fula or Futafula are used. The terms '''Fallata''' '''Fallatah''' or '''Fellata''' are of [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]] origins, and are often the ethnonyms by which Fulani people are identified by in parts of Chad and in Sudan.

==Geographic distribution==
[[File:A distribution map of Fula people in Africa.jpg|thumb|A distribution map of Fula people. Dark green: a major ethnic group; Medium: significant; Light: minor.&lt;ref name="Juang2008p492"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ml.html Mali: People &amp; Society], [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/uv.html Burkina Faso: People &amp; Society], [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gv.html Guinea: People &amp; Society], [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sg.html Senegal: People &amp; Society], [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ng.html Niger: People &amp; Society], CIA Factbook (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Fula people are widely distributed, across the Sahel from the Atlantic coast to the Red Sea, particularly in West Africa. The countries where they are present include [[Mauritania]], [[Ghana]], [[Senegal]], [[Guinea]], [[the Gambia]], [[Mali]], [[Nigeria]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Benin]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Guinea Bissau]], [[Cameroon]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Niger]], [[Chad]], [[Togo]], [[South Sudan]] the [[Central African Republic]], [[Liberia]], and as far east as the Red Sea in [[Sudan]] and [[Egypt]]. With the exception of Guinea,&lt;ref&gt;{{CIA World Factbook link|gv|Guinea}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the Fula make up the largest ethnic group, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, and Fulas are either a significant or a minority ethnic group in nearly all other countries they live in. Alongside, many also speak other languages of the countries they inhabit, making many Fulani bilingual or even trilingual in nature. Such languages include [[French language|French]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Bambara language|Bambara]], [[Wolof language|Wolof]], and [[Arabic]].

Major concentrations of Fulani people exist in the [[Fouta Djallon]] highlands of central Guinea and south into the northernmost reaches of Sierra Leone; the [[Futa Tooro]] savannah grasslands of Senegal and southern Mauritania; the [[Inner Niger Delta|Macina]] inland Niger river delta system around Central Mali; and especially in the regions around [[Mopti]] and the Nioro Du Sahel in the [[Kayes]] region; the [[Borgu]] settlements of Benin, Togo and West-Central Nigeria; the northern parts of Burkina Faso in the [[Sahel Region|Sahel region]]'s provinces of [[Séno Province|Seno]], [[Oudalan Province|Wadalan]], and [[Soum Province|Soum]]; and the areas occupied by the [[Sokoto Caliphate]], which includes what is now Southern Niger and Northern Nigeria (such as [[Tahoua]], [[Katsina]], [[Sokoto]], [[Kebbi]], [[Zinder]], [[Bauchi]], [[Diffa]], [[Yobe]], [[Gombe State|Gombe]], and further east, into the [[Benue River]] valley systems of North Eastern Nigeria and Northern Cameroon).

This is the area known as the '''Fombina''', literally meaning "The South" in ''Adamawa Fulfulde'', because it represented the most southern and eastern reaches of Fulɓe hegemonic dominance in [[West Africa]]. In this area, [[Fulfulde]] is the local lingua franca, and language of cross cultural communication. Further east of this area, Fulani communities become predominantly nomadic, and exist at less organized social systems. These are the areas of the [[Chari-Baguirmi Region]] and its river systems, in Chad and the Central African Republic, the [[Ouaddaï highlands]] of Eastern Chad, the areas around [[Kordofan]], [[Darfur]] and the [[Blue Nile]], [[Sennar]], [[Kassala]] regions of Sudan,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fX6pCg3iDHcC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;lpg=PA140&amp;dq=fulani+blue+nile#v=onepage&amp;q=fulani%20blue%20nile&amp;f=false | title = Changing Identifications and Alliances in North-east Africa: Volume II: Sudan, Uganda, and the Ethiopia-Sudan Borderlands | isbn = 9781845459635 | editor1-last = Schlee | editor1-first = Gunther | editor2-last = Watson|editor2-first=Elizabeth | date = 2013-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Red Sea]] coastal city of [[Port Sudan]]. The Fulani on their way to or back from the pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], Saudi Arabia, settled in many parts of eastern Sudan, today representing a distinct community of over 2 million people referred to as the '''Fellata'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Al-Amin Abu-Manga |author2=Nuhu Auwalu Wakili |title= Fulfulde in the Sudan: process of adaptation to Arabic |year=1986 |publisher=D.

While their early habitat in West Africa was apparently in an area in the vicinity of the tri-border point of present-day Mali, Senegal and Mauritania, they are now, after centuries of gradual migrations and conquests, spread throughout a wide band of West and Central Africa. The Fulani People occupy a vast geographical expanse located roughly in a longitudinal East-West band immediately south of the Sahara, and just north of the coastal rain forest and swamps. There are an estimated 20-25 million Fulani people.&lt;ref name="Danver2015p31"/&gt;

There are generally three different types of Fulani based on settlement patterns, viz: the Nomadic/Pastoral or '''Mbororo''', The Semi-Nomadic and the Settled or "Town Fulani". The pastoral Fulani move around with their cattle throughout the year. Typically, they do not stay around, for long stretches {not more than 2–4 months at a time}. The semi-nomadic Fulani can either be Fulɓe families who happen to settle down temporarily at particular times of the year, or Fulɓe families who do not "browse" around past their immediate surroundings, and even though they possess livestock, they do not wander away from a fixed or settled homestead not too far away, they are basically "In-betweeners".{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Settled Fulani live in villages, towns and cities permanently and have given up nomadic life completely, in favor of an urban one. These processes of settlement, concentration and military conquest led to the existence of organized and long-established communities of Fulani, varying in size from small villages to towns. Today, some major Fulani towns include: [[Labé]], [[Pita, Guinea|Pita]], [[Mamou]] and [[Dalaba]] in Guinea, [[Kaedi]], [[Matam, Senegal|Matam]] and [[Podor]] in Senegal and Mauritania, [[Bandiagara]], [[Mopti]], [[Dori, Burkina Faso|Dori]], [[Gorom-Gorom]] and [[Djibo]] in Mali and Burkina Faso, on the bend of the Niger, and [[Birnin Kebbi]], [[Gombe, Nigeria|Gombe]], [[Yola, Nigeria|Yola]], [[Digil]], [[Jalingo]], [[Mayo Belwa]], [[Mubi]], [[Maroua]], [[Ngaoundere]], [[Girei]] and [[Garoua]] in the countries of Cameroon and Nigeria, in most of these communities, the Fulani are usually perceived as a [[ruling class]].
{|class="wikitable" border="2"|center|Fulani Communities are sometimes grouped and named based on the areas they occupy. Although within each region, there are even further divisions and sub groupings as well. Below is a list of the main Fulɓe Groups.

Typically, Fulɓe belonging to the same affinity bloc tend to cluster together in culture, customs, and dialectal variety. Eastern Fulɓe sub-groups tend to be more similar to each other than to other sub-groups, and the same applies with most Western groups. Culturally speaking, the Central Fulɓe sub-groups are roughly in between the Western and Eastern Fulani cultural niches.

For example, the Massina Fulɓe share similarities both dialectally and culturally to Nigeria/Cameroonian (Eastern) (Both of which end interrogative questions with "na?"), as well as Senegalese/Guinean (Western) Fulɓe cultures (who do not end interrogative questions in such mannerism). Accordingly, the Western groups are the most divergent from the Eastern groups and vice versa. Overall however, all share most cultural practices to a large extent.

==History==
{{double image|right|Fulani Woman from Niger.jpg|181|Fulani man.jpg|80|Fulani woman from Niger and man in Nigeria.}}
The origins of the Fulani people are unclear and various theories have been postulated. As a nomadic herding people, they have moved through and among many other cultures. Skutsch notes that their oral histories point toward a start in Egypt or farther east, but also that their language comes from the Senegambian region. He concludes that the modern Fulani people began in the northern Senegambian region&lt;ref name="Danver2015p31"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skutsch2013p474"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl Skutsch|title=Encyclopedia of the World's Minorities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yXYKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA474|year=2005 |publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-19388-1|page=474}}, Quote: "Fulani oral traditions suggest an origin in Egypt or the Middle East, a common theme in West African Muslim traditions.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethnogenesis of the Fulani people may have begun as a result of interactions between an ancient West African population and [[North Africa]]n populations such as Berbers or Egyptians.&lt;ref name="Ndukwe1996p9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skutsch2013p474"/&gt; Their West African roots may be in and around the valley of [[Senegal River]].&lt;ref name=gatesfulani/&gt; They likely reflect a genetic intermix of people with West African, North African, and Arabian origins, and have been a part of many ruling dynasties particularly in the [[Sahel]] and West Africa.&lt;ref name="Juang2008p492"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Webster238"/&gt; Speculations about their origins started in the era of European conquest and colonization. In 1902, [[E. D. Morel|Edmund Dene Morel]] equated the ancient Romans' [[White Aethiopians|Leucæthiopes]] with the people the ''[[Tarikh al-Sudan]]'' placed at the head of the Ghana empire, who (Morel claims the ''Tarikh al-Soudan'' says) were "white" and whose monarch had a Fulfulde affix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morel|first1=E.D.|title=Affairs of West Africa|date=1902|publisher=William Heinemann|location=London|pages=130–131, 140–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===
[[File:Algerien Desert.jpg|thumb|[[Tassili n'Ajjer]] rock art]]

The earliest evidence that shed some light on the pre-historic Fulani culture can be found in the [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] rock art, which seem to depict the early life of the people dating back to 6000 BCE). Examination of these rock paintings suggests the presence of proto-Fulani cultural traits in the region by at least the 4th millennium BCE. Tassili-N'Ajjer in Algeria is one of the most famous North African sites of rock painting.&lt;ref name="webpulaaku.net"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webpulaaku.net/defte/adepegba/conclusion.html |title=C.O. Adepegba: Decorative Arts of the Fulani Nomads: Conclusion |publisher=webPulaaku|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars specializing in Fulani culture believe that some of the imagery depicts rituals that are still practiced by contemporary Fulani people. At the Tin Tazarift site, for instance, historian Amadou Hampate Ba recognized a scene of the 'lotori' ceremony, a celebration of the ox's aquatic origin. In a finger motif, Ba detected an allusion to the myth of the hand of the first Fulani herdsman, Kikala. At Tin Felki, Ba recognized a hexagonal carnelian jewel as related to the Agades cross, a fertility charm still used by Fulani women. There are also details in the paintings which correspond to elements from Fulani myths taught during the initiation rites like the hermaphroditic cow.&lt;ref name="webpulaaku.net"/&gt;

The Fulani initiation field is depicted graphically with the sun surrounded by a circle lined up with heads of cows as different phases of the moon at the bottom and surmounted by a male and a female figures. The female figure even has a hanging braid of hair to the back. Though no exact dates have been established for the paintings they are undoubtedly much earlier than the historic times when the Fulani were first noticed in Western Sahara.&lt;ref name="webpulaaku.net"/&gt;

In the 9th century the Fulani may have been involved in the formation of a state with its capital at [[Takrur]] which is suggested to have had influx of Fulani migrating from the east and settling in the Senegal valley,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hrbek|first=I.|title=General History of Africa volume 3: Africa from the 7th to the 11th Century: Africa from the Seventh to the Eleventh Century v. 3 (Unesco General History of Africa (abridged))|year=1992|publisher=James Carey|isbn=978-0852550939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qDFcD0BuekQC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=Serer+neolithic#v=onepage&amp;q=Takrur&amp;f=false|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Creevey|first=Lucy|title=Islam, Women and the Role of the State in Senegal|journal=Journal of Religion in Africa|date=August 1996|volume=26|issue=3|pages=268–307|jstor=1581646|doi=10.1163/157006696X00299}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[John Donnelly Fage]] suggests that Takrur was formed through the interaction of Berbers from the Sahara and "Negro agricultural peoples" who were "essentially Serer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fage|first=John Donnelly|title=The Cambridge History of Africa, Volume 3|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521209816|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qwg8GV6aibkC&amp;lpg=PA484&amp;dq=Takrur%7CTekrur%20serer&amp;pg=PA483#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Developments%20before%20the%20arrival%20of%20Europeans%22&amp;f=false|editor=Roland Oliver|chapter=Upper and Lower Guinea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fulani culture continued to emerge in the area of the upper Niger and Senegal Rivers. The Fulani were cattle-keeping farmers who shared their lands with other nearby groups, like the Soninke, who contributed to the rise of ancient Ghana. During the 16th century the Fula expanded through the [[sahel]] grasslands, stretching from what is today [[Senegal]] to [[Sudan]], with eastward and westward expansion being led by nomadic groups of cattle breeders or the '''Fulɓe ladde'''. While the initial expansionist groups were small, they soon increased in size due to the availability of grazing lands in the sahel and the lands that bordered it to the immediate south.

Agricultural expansions led to a division among the Fulani, where individuals were classified as belonging either to the group of expansionist nomadic agriculturalists or the group of Fulani who found it more comfortable to abandon traditional nomadic ways and settle in towns or the '''Fulɓe Wuro'''. Fulani towns were a direct result of a nomadic heritage, and were often founded by individuals who had simply chosen to settle in a given area instead of continue on their way.

This cultural interaction most probably occurred in [[Senegal]], where the closely linguistically related Toucouleur, [[Serer people|Serer]] and [[Wolof people|Wolof]] people predominate, ultimately leading to the ethnogenesis of the Fulani culture, language and people before subsequent expansion throughout much of West Africa. Another version is that they were originally a Berber speaking people who crossed the Senegal to pasture their cattle on the [[Ferlo Desert]] south of the [[Senegal River]]. Finding themselves cut off from their kinsmen by the other communities now occupying the fertile Senegal valley, they gradually adopted the language of their new neighbours. As their herds increased, small groups found themselves forced to move eastward and further southwards and so initiated a series of migrations throughout West Africa, which endures to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africa.gm/africa/gambia/article/2008/2/5/history-corner-peoples-of-the-gambia-the-fula |title=History Corner - Peoples of The Gambia: The Fula |publisher=Africa.gm - Africa news and information community |accessdate=2014-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of Fulani migration as a whole, from the Western to the Eastern Sudan is very fragmentary. Delafosse, one of the earliest enquirers into Fulani history and customs, principally relying on oral tradition, estimated that Fulani migrants left Fuuta-Tooro, and Macina, towards the east, between the eleventh and the fourteenth centuries. By the 15th century, there was a steady flow of Fulɓe immigrants into Hausaland and, later on, Bornu. Their presence in Baghirmi was later recorded when Fulani fought as allies, to Dokkenge or Birni Besif, when he founded Massenya (a Chadian town), early in the 16th century.

By the end of the 18th century Fulani settlements were dotted all over the [[Benue River]] valley and its tributaries. They spread eastwards towards [[Garoua]] and [[Rey Bouba]], and southwards towards the [[Faro River]], to the foot of the [[Mambilla Plateau]], which they would later ascend in subsequent years. The heaviest concentrations of their settlements were at Gurin, [[Chamba people|Chamba]] territory, Cheboa, Turua and Bundang. These so-called "Benue-Fulani" reduced the frequency with which they moved from place to place. The number of years they stayed at one spot depended on two factors: the reaction of the earlier settlers of that locality to their presence, and how satisfactory the conditions were, i.e., availability of pastures for their cattle.

===Settlement and Islam===
Fula people, with Arabic and North African roots, adopted Islam early. According to David Levison, adopting Islam made the Fulani feel a "cultural and religious superiority to surrounding peoples, and that adoption became a major ethnic boundary marker" between them and other African ethnic groups in Sahel and West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Levinson|title=Encyclopedia of World Cultures: Africa and the Middle East, Volume 9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JcDMrQEACAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Gale Group|isbn=978-0-8161-1808-3|chapter=Fulani }}, Quote: "Their adoption of Islam increased the Fulanis' feeling of cultural and religious superiority to surrounding peoples, and that adoption became a major ethnic boundary marker."&lt;/ref&gt; Settled and nomadic Fulani became political and warring entities, armed with horses and equipment of war from the north.&lt;ref name=stantonfulawar&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrea L. Stanton|title=Cultural Sociology of the Middle East, Asia, and Africa: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GtCL2OYsH6wC |year=2012|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4129-8176-7|pages=147–148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wars were not merely between Fula people and other ethnic groups, but also internecine between the pastoral and sedentary Fulani, where sometimes they worked in cohesion, and other times the Muslim Fulani leaders attacked the nomadic Fulani as infidels.&lt;ref name=stantonfulawar/&gt;

The [[Songhai Empire]] rulers had converted to Sunni Islam in the 11th-century, and were a major trading partner of the Middle East and North Africa.&lt;ref name=songhaibrit&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/place/Songhai-empire Songhai Empire], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; The Fulani warriors, in the 15th century, challenged this West African trading state near the [[Niger River]], but were repulsed. In 1493, [[Askia Muhammad]] led the Fulani people from western Sudan, and over time gained control of much that was previously Songhai empire, removing Sonni Baru who had attempted to protect the interests of pastoralists.&lt;ref name=songhaibrit/&gt; Askia Muhammad won a control over the caravan trade routes in West Africa, but was overthrown by his own son, [[Askia Musa]], in a coup in 1528.&lt;ref name=songhaibrit/&gt;

The Fulani, after being the first group of people in West Africa to convert to Islam, became active in supporting Islamic theology and ideology from centers such as [[Timbuktu]]. The Fula people who later became known as the Toroobe worked with Berber and Arabian Islamic clerics, charting out the spread of Islam in West Africa. The Fula people led many jihads, or holy wars, some of which were major.&lt;ref name="Manger2013p92"&gt;{{cite book|author=Knut Vikor| editor=Leif Manger|title=Muslim Diversity: Local Islam in Global Contexts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8WGOAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA92| year=2013 |publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-81857-8|pages=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; These war efforts, helped spread Islam in West Africa, as well helped them dominate much of the Sahel region of West Africa during the medieval and pre-colonial era history, establishing them not only as a religious group but also as a political and economic force.&lt;ref name=johnsonmasina/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beek1988fulani"/&gt;

===Rise to dominance in West Africa===
Futa Toro was established in the 1500s, by Denianke dynasty built out of Fulani and Mandinka forces; the importance of Fula people to this rule led to this era known as [[Empire of Great Fulo]].&lt;ref name=stantonfulawar/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Thornton|title=Africa and Africans in the Making of the Atlantic World, 1400-1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AVZDHeVEeywC |date=28 April 1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-62724-5|pages=91–92, xvii–xix}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fulani raided and violently disrupted the trade routes that accounted for the economic prosperity of older African kingdoms, and thus began their rise. Futa Bundu, sometimes called Bondu and located in Senegal and Faleme rivers confluence, became a center for the rise of West Africa-wide Fula empire and influence in 17th century. From the 18th century onwards, the frequency of Jihads increased such as those led by Ibrahim Sori and Karamoko Ali in 1725, the Fulani became a hegemonic force and were politically dominant in many areas.&lt;ref name=stantonfulawar/&gt; The region was engulfed in theocratic wars, with many Islamic lineages seeking political power and control. The Moroccans invaded western Sahel adding to an anarchical situation. Food production plummeted, and during this periods famine plagued the region, negatively affecting the political situation and increasing the trigger for militant control of the economic activity.&lt;ref name="openaccess.leidenuniv.nl"&gt;https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/9616/ASC_1268914_030.pdf?sequence=1&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, Fulɓe empire split among the later descendants and developed into many emirates. The main nuclei of Fulɓe power were the polities in the Senegal River Valley, the Fuuta Jallon mountains, in Guinea, the Inland Delta of the Niger in Mali (Maasina), the north of Nigeria and the Adamawa Plateau in Cameroon. In between these big centres there were numerous small polities dominated by the Fulɓe in the central [[Gourma Province|Gourma]] of present-day Mali and the north and west of Burkina Faso (Jelgoji, Boboola, Dori, Liptako), northern Benin (Borgu), the Sene-Gambia, northern Senegal (Bundu), and the southern and western parts of present-day Niger (Dallol Bosso, Birni N'konni).

====Imamate of Futa Jallon====
{{main|Imamate of Futa Jallon}}

The Emirate / Imamate of Timbo in the Fuuta Jallon was the first of the Fulɓe emirates in West Africa. It developed from a revolt by Islamic Fulɓe against their oppression by the pagan '''Pulli''' (non-Islamic Fulɓe), and the Jallonke (the original [[Mandé peoples|Mande]] inhabitants of the Fuuta-Jallon), during the first half of the 18th century. The first ruler took the title of ''Almaami'' and resided in [[Timbo]], near the modern-day town of [[Mamou]]. The town became the political capital of the newly formed Immamate, with the religious capital was located in [[Fugumba]]. The Council of Elders of the Futa Jallon state were also based in Fugumba, acting as a brake on the Almami's powers.

The newly formed imamate was mostly located mainly in present-day Guinea, but also spanned parts of modern-day Guinea Bissau, Senegal, and Sierra Leone. This emirate was, in fact, a federal state of nine provinces: Timbo, Fugumbaa, Ɓuuriya, Koyin, Kollaaɗe, Keebaali, Labe, Fode-Hajji, and Timbi. After the Muslim Fulɓe victory, other ethnic groups who had resisted the jihad were deprived of their rights to land except for a small piece for their own subsistence, and were reduced to servitude. The nomad '''Pulli Fulɓe''' lost all freedom of movement, and thus, began to settle en-masse. The Jalonke lost their noble status and became slaves (''maccuɓe'').

Later, due to strife between two branches of the Seediayanke royal lineage, (the [[Soriya]] and the [[Alfaya (party)|Alphaya]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=J. D. Fage |author2=Roland Anthony Oliver |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q3mx8aAo6x0C&amp;pg=PA208&amp;lpg=PA208 |title=The Cambridge History of Africa, Volume 4 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1975 |accessdate=2014-02-27 |isbn=9780521204132 |page=208 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a system for the rotation of office between these branches was set up. This led to an almost permanent state of civil strife, since none of the parties was inclined to respect the system, which considerably weakened the power of the political centre.

====The Empire of Massina====
{{main|Massina Empire}}
[[File:Fula jihad states map general c1830.png|thumb|Fula people have helped formed several historic Islamic theocracies and led many [[Jihad]] states such as the 19th-century Masina.&lt;ref name=johnsonmasina&gt;{{cite journal | last=Johnson | first=Marion | title=The Economic Foundations of an Islamic Theocracy - The Case of Masina | journal=The Journal of African History | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=17 | issue=4 | year=1976 | pages=481–495 | doi=10.1017/s0021853700015024 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beek1988fulani"&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter van Beek|title=The Quest for Purity: Dynamics of Puritan Movements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NvpMSDSeqwMC&amp;pg=PA149|year=1988|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-011382-2|pages=149–177|chapter=Purity and statecraft: The Fulani Jihad}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Maasina Emirate, also called ''Diina'' ("religion" in Fulfulde, with Arabic origins), was established by the Fulbe jihad led by Sheeku Aamadu in 1818. The origins of the Maasina Emirate in the Inner Delta of the Niger are also found in rebellion, this time against the Bambara / Bamana Kingdom of [[Segou]], a political power that controlled the region from outside. This jihad was inspired by events in northern Nigeria where an important scholar of the time, Usman Dan Fodio, established an Islamic empire with Sokoto as its capital.&lt;ref name="openaccess.leidenuniv.nl"/&gt;

For some time, groups of Fulbe had been dominant in parts of the delta, thereby creating a complex hierarchy dating back through several waves of conquest. However, due to internecine warfare they were never able to organize a countervailing force against the Bamana Kingdom. In 1818, an Islamic cleric named Aamadu Hammadi Buubu united the Fulbe under the banner of Islam and fought a victorious battle against the Bamana and their allies. He subsequently established his rule in the Inland Delta and the adjacent dry lands east and west of the delta.&lt;ref name="openaccess.leidenuniv.nl"/&gt;

This state appears to have had tight control over its core area, as evidenced by the fact that its political and economic organization is still manifested today in the organization of agricultural production in the Inland Delta. Despite its power and omnipresence, the hegemony of the emirate was constantly threatened. During the reign of Aamadu Aamadu, the grandson of Sheeku Aamadu, internal contradictions weakened the emirate until it became easy prey for the forces of the '''Futanke''', which subsequently overthrew the Maasina Emirate, in 1862.&lt;ref name="openaccess.leidenuniv.nl"/&gt;

====The Futanke / Toucouleur Empire====
{{main|Toucouleur Empire}}
Many regard the Futanke or Toucouleur conquest of the western Sudan and central Mali as a reform movement. The character of the Futanke Emirate was somewhat different, although its founding was related to the conquest of the Maasina Emirate and the Bamana Kingdoms of Segou and Kaarta in the aftermath of a movement for reform. Threatened by French colonial forces while at the same time being supplied with firearms by them, the Futanke staged a jihad to fight paganism and the competing Islamic brotherhood of the Tijannya.

Its founder, [[El Hadj Umar Tall]] an Islamic reformer originating from the Fuuta Tooro on the banks of the Senegal River, died fighting against rebels shortly after his forces defeated the Maasina Emirate. After El Hadj Umar's death, the emirate was divided into three states, each ruled by one of his sons. These three states had their capitals respectively in the towns of [[Nioro du Sahel|Nioro]], [[Segou]] and [[Bandiagara]]. A most important distinction was between noblemen (free people) and the non-free ('''Rimmaibe''' or '''Maccube''').

The noblemen consisted of the ruling class of political overlords and Islamic clerics, as well as the pastoral Fulbe populations, who helped them come to power. Together, they formed a group of vassals to the political elite, and were considered noblemen, although, in reality, their political influence was minimal. The conquered populations were reduced to servitude or slavery and more slaves were captured in order to provide enough labour for the functioning of the economy. In addition, there were groups of bards, courtiers and artisans who occupied lower political and social positions.

====The Sokoto Caliphate and its various emirates====
{{main|Sokoto Caliphate}}
The Sokoto Caliphate was by far the largest and most successful legacy of Fulani power in Western Africa. It was the largest, as well as the most well-organized, of the Fulani Jihad states. Throughout the 19th century, Sokoto was one of the largest and most powerful empires in West Africa until 1903, when defeated by European colonial forces. The Sokoto Caliphate included several emirates, the largest of which was [[Adamawa Emirate|Adamawa]], although the [[Kano Emirate]] was the most populated. Others included, but are not limited to: [[Gombe Emirate]], [[Gwandu Emirate]], [[Bauchi Emirate]], [[Katsina Emirate]], [[Zazzau Emirate]], [[Hadejia Emirate]], and [[Muri, Nigeria|Muri Emirate]].

While establishing their hegemony, the Fulbe defined a strict social hierarchy and imposed limitations on economic and trading activities, the purpose of which was to ensure a constant flow of tax revenue and commodities to the state apparatus and the standing army, especially for the cavalry. The freedom for pastoralists to move around was curtailed in order to ensure the smooth functioning of other production activities, such as cereal cultivation and, in the case of Maasina, of fishing activities.

There appears to be a considerable resistance to the forced acceptance of Islam by these emirates. For example, many nomadic Fulbe, predominantly [[Wodaabe]] fled northern Nigeria when their liberty was curtailed and they were forced to convert to Islam following the jihads instigated by Usman Dan Fodio from Sokoto. Conversion to Islam meant not only changing one's religion, but also submitting to rules dealing with every aspect of social, political and cultural life, intrusions with which many nomadic Fulbe were not comfortable.

The Fulani and [[Hausa people]] have taken some influences from each other's cultures. Upon the success recorded in the 1804 [[Fulani War]] of [[Usman dan Fodio]], many of Fulɓe subsequently joined the ruling classes of the Northern Nigerian Emirate. They dress and speak like their Hausa neighbours and live in the same form (see [[Hausa–Fulani]]). The Fulɓe who didn't settle during this period and their descendants, however, still keep an obvious distinct identity from that of the Hausa and other surrounding groups of the region. This Hausa–Fulani interaction is uncommon outside the eastern subregion of West Africa.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The [[Toucouleur people]] in the central [[Senegal River]] valley are closely related to the Fula people. During the medieval era, they paid a tribute to the Fula. Large numbers of other Fula-speakers live scattered in the region and have a lower status. They are descendants of Fula-owned slaves. Now legally emancipated, in some regions they still pay tribute to Fula elites, and they are often denied chances for upward social mobility.&lt;ref&gt;Lotte Pelckmans (2011) ''[https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/17911/ASC-075287668-3015-01.pdf?sequence=2 Travelling hierarchies, Roads in and out of slave status in a central Malian Ful&amp;#595;e network]'', African Studies Centre, Leiden University, African Studies Collection, Vol. 34, {{ISBN|978-90-5448-105-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mali]], [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Senegal]] for instance, those within the fulɓe cultural sphere, but who are not ethnically Fula, are referred to as ''yimɓe pulaaku'', i.e. (people of the Fula culture). As such, Fulani culture includes people who may or may not be ethnic Fulani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://centre.icddrb.org/images/jhpn211_knowledge_methods.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220110353/https://centre.icddrb.org/images/jhpn211_knowledge_methods.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although slavery is now illegal, memories of the past relationship between Fulɓbe and Rimayɓe are still very much alive in both groups. Paul Riesman, an American ethnographer who resided among the ''Jelgooji Ful&amp;#595;be'' of Burkina Faso in the 1980s, states that the Fulɓe are tall, slim, and light-skinned; they have thin straight noses, and their hair tends to be long and curly. In contrast, the Rimayɓe are stocky, tending towards corpulence, dark-skinned with flat 'squashed' noses, and short kinky hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Paul Riesman |author2=David L.

===Slavery and caste system===
Fula society features the [[Caste system in Africa|caste divisions]] typical of the West African region.&lt;ref name="Tamari 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name=dupire85&gt;Marguerite Dupire (1985), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40460882 A Nomadic Caste: The Fulani Woodcarvers Historical Background and Evolution], ''Anthropos'', Bd. 80, H. 1./3.

The second part of this study raises the question of the conditions underlying the creation of artisan castes, drawing upon examples taken from agricultural societies, certain of which are state-based (Fulani, Serer of Sine), others of which are more or less acephalous (Marghi, [[Senufo people|Senufo]], Cangin Serer)."&lt;/ref&gt; The fairly rigid caste system of the Fula people has medieval roots,&lt;ref name="Tamari 1991"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Tamari | first=Tal | title=The Development of Caste Systems in West Africa | journal=The Journal of African History | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=32 | issue=2 | year=1991 | pages=221–250 | doi=10.1017/s0021853700025718 }}, Quote: "Endogamous artisan and musician groups are characteristic of over fifteen West African peoples, including the Manding, Soninke, Wolof, Serer, '''Fulani''', Tukulor, Songhay, Dogon, Senufo, Minianka, Moors, and Tuareg.

The Fulani castes are endogamous in nature, meaning individuals marry only within their caste. This caste system, however, wasn't as elaborate in places like northern [[Nigeria]], Eastern [[Niger]] or [[Cameroon]]. According to some estimates, by the late 19th century, slaves constituted about 50% of the population of the Fulɓe-ruled [[Adamawa Emirate]], where they were referred to as ''jeyaɓe'' (singular ''jeyado'').

==Culture==
===Traditional livelihood===

The Fulani are traditionally a [[nomad]]ic, [[Pastoralism|pastoralist]] [[trade|trading]] people. They herd [[cattle]], [[goat]]s and [[sheep]] across the vast dry hinterlands of their domain, keeping somewhat separate from the local agricultural populations. They are the largest nomadic ethnic group in the world, and inhabit several territories over an area larger in size than the continental United States.

The Fulani follow a code of behavior known as ''pulaaku'', which consists of the qualities of patience, self-control, discipline, prudence, modesty, respect for others (including foes), wisdom, forethought, personal responsibility, hospitality, courage, and hard work. Among the nomadic Fulani, women in their spare time make handicrafts including engraved gourds, weavings, knitting, beautifully made covers for calabashes known as '''mbeedu''', and baskets. The Fulani men are less involved in the production of crafts such as pottery, iron-working, and dyeing, unlike males from neighboring ethnic groups around them.

In virtually every area of West Africa, where the nomadic Fulɓe reside, there has been an increasing trend of conflicts between farmers (sedentary) and grazier (pastoral nomadic). There have been numerous such cases on the [[Jos Plateau]], the [[Western High Plateau]], the Central/Middle Belt regions of Nigeria,&lt;ref name="BBC2016-08-10"&gt;{{cite web |author=Martin Patience |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-37021044 |title=Nigeria's deadly battle for land: Herdsmen v farmers |publisher=BBC News |date=2016-08-10 |accessdate=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Northern Burkina Faso, and Southern Chad. The rearing of cattle is a principal activity in four of Cameroon’s ten administrative regions as well as three other provinces with herding on a lesser scale, throughout the North and Central regions of Nigeria, as well as the entire Sahel and Sudan region.&lt;ref name="4 July 2013"&gt;{{cite web|author=4 July 2013 |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201307041283.html |title=Nigeria: Going Beyond the Green Wall Ritual |publisher=allAfrica.com |date=2013-07-04 |accessdate=2014-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For decades there have been intermittent skirmishes between the [[Wodaabe|Woɗaaɓe]] ''Bororo'' (graziers) and sedentary farmers such as the [[Jukun people (West Africa)|Jukun]], [[Tiv people|Tiv]], [[Chamba people|Chamba]], [[Bamileke people|Bamileke]], and sometimes even the Hausa. Such conflicts usually begin when cattle have strayed into farmlands and destroyed crops. Thousands of Fulani have been forced to migrate from their traditional homelands in the Sahel, to areas further south, because of increasing encroachment of [[Sahara]]n [[desertification]]. Nigeria alone loses {{convert|2168|km2}} of cattle rangeland and cropland every year to desertification, posing serious threats to the livelihoods of about 20 million people.&lt;ref name="4 July 2013"/&gt;

Recurrent droughts have meant that a lot of traditional herding families have been forced to give up their nomadic way of life, losing a sense of their identity in the process. Increasing urbanization has also meant that a lot of traditional Fulani grazing lands have been taken for developmental purposes, or forcefully converted into farmlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scialert.net/fulltext/?doi=tae.2010.147.157&amp;org=11 |title=Economic Effects of Farmer-grazier Conflicts in Nigeria: A Case Study of Bauchi State |doi=10.3923/tae.2010.147.157 |publisher=Scialert.net |date= |accessdate=2014-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; These actions often result in violent attacks and reprisal counterattacks being exchanged between the Fulani, who feel their way of life and survival are being threatened, and other populations who often feel aggrieved from loss of farm produce even if the lands they farm on were initially barren and uncultivated.&lt;ref name="BBC2016-08-10"/&gt;

Fulani in Nigeria have often requested for the development of exclusive grazing reserves, to curb conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamji.com/fulani8.htm |title=Grazing Reserve Development and Constraints |publisher=Gamji.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the leading presidential aspirants of previous elections seeking Fulɓe votes have made several of such failed promises in their campaigns. Discussions among government officials, traditional rulers, and Fulani leaders on the welfare of the pastoralists have always centered on requests and pledges for protecting grazing spaces and cattle passages. The growing pressure from '''Ardo'en''' (the Fulani community leaders) for the salvation of what is left of the customary grazing land has caused some state governments with large populations of herders (such as Gombe, Bauchi, Adamawa, Taraba, Plateau, and Kaduna) to include in their development plans the reactivation and preservation of grazing reserves. Quick to grasp the desperation of cattle-keepers for land, the administrators have instituted a Grazing Reserve Committee to find a lasting solution to the rapid depletion of grazing land resources in Nigeria.&lt;ref name="July 21, 2012"&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.punchng.com/news/senators-fight-over-grazing-land-for-fulani-herdsmen/ |title=Senators fight over grazing land for Fulani herdsmen |publisher=Punchng.com |date=2012-07-21 |accessdate=2014-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201214847/http://www.punchng.com/news/senators-fight-over-grazing-land-for-fulani-herdsmen/ |archivedate=2014-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fulani believe that the expansion of the grazing reserves will boost livestock population, lessen the difficulty of herding, reduce seasonal migration, and enhance the interaction among farmers, pastoralists, and rural dwellers. Despite these expectations, grazing reserves are not within the reach of about three-quarters of the nomadic Fulani in Nigeria, who number in the millions, and about sixty percent of migrant pastoralists who use the existing grazing reserves keep to the same reserves every year. The number and the distribution of the grazing reserves in Nigeria range from insufficient to severely insufficient for Fulani livestock. In countries like Nigeria, Cameroon, and Burkina Faso where meat supplies are entirely dependent on the Fulani, such conflicts lead to scarcity and hikes in animal protein prices. In recent times, the Nigerian senate and other lawmakers have been bitterly divided in attempts to pass bills on grazing lands and migration "corridors" for Fulani herdsmen.

===Language===
The language of the Fulani is [[Pulaar language|Pulaar]]. It is also the language of the Toucouleurs. All Senegalese and Mauritanians who speak the language natively are known as the ''[[wikt:Halpulaar|Halpulaar]]'' or ''Haalpulaar'en'', which means "speakers of Pulaar" ("hal" is the root of the Pulaar verb ''haalugol'', meaning "to speak"). In some areas, e.g. in northern Cameroon, Fulfulde is a local [[lingua franca]].

===Moral code===
Central to the Fulani people's lifestyle is a code of behavior known as ''pulaaku'' or ''laawol Fulɓe'' in Fulfulde, literally meaning the "Fulani pathways" which are passed on by each generation as high moral values of the Fulbe, which enable them to maintain their identity across boundaries and changes of lifestyle. Essentially viewed as what makes a person Fulani, or "Fulaniness", ''pulaaku'' consists of four basic tenets.

The dominant traits of Laawol Pulaaku or the Fulani way are ''munyal, hakkiilo, semteende, sagata'' and an intimate understanding of both the Fulfulde language and people.

''Munyal'' is a cross between strength and courage in adversity and a stoic acceptance or endurance of the supposedly pre-ordained vicissitudes of life. It is often translated as patience.

The word ''hakkiilo'' (''hakkille''), meaning intelligence, foresight and common sense, conveys a blending of prudence and shrewdness in livelihood management and face-to-face encounters.

''Semteende'' (shame) is best described both as a lacking of restraint (''gacce/yaage'') and self-control in daily social interaction, and evidencing a weakness when facing adversity. It is most often translated as shame. When someone acts shamefully, Fulbe say ''o sempti'', meaning they shamed themselves, or alternatively, ''o walaa semteende (o wala gacce)'', meaning they have no shame. In other words, a pullo must know of the social constraints on behavior and be able to avoid contravening them in all situations, especially in front of others. A true fulani is in total control of his emotions and impulses.
* ''Munyal'': Patience, self-control, discipline, prudence
* ''Gacce'' / ''Semteende'': Modesty, respect for others (including foes)
* ''Hakkille'': Wisdom, forethought, personal responsibility, hospitality
* ''Sagata'' / ''Tiinaade'': Courage, hard work

===Dress===
[[File:Chapeau berger Peul-Institut d'ethnologie de Strasbourg-2.jpg|thumb|The traditional hat (Tengaade) of the Fulani people worn in diverse slightly different variations among every Fula subgroup]]
There are no particular outfits for all Fulani sub-groups; dressing and clothing accessories such as ornaments mostly depend on the particular region. The traditional dress of the Fulbe Wodaabe consists of long colourful flowing robes, modestly embroidered or otherwise decorated. In the Futa Jallon highlands of central Guinea, it is common to see men wearing a distinctive hat with colorful embroidery. In Nigeria, Cameroon and Niger, men wear a hat that tapers off at three angular tips, known as a ''noppiire''. Both men and women wear a characteristic white or black cotton fabric gown, adorned with intricate blue, red and green thread embroidery work, with styles differing according to region and sex. [[File:Old Traditional Fulani Blanket - courtesy WOVENSOULS COLLECTION.jpg|thumb|180px|Antique Fulani Blanket, Mali, estimated to be from the 1920s courtesy the WOVENSOULS collection]]

It is not uncommon to see the women decorate their hair with bead hair accessories as well as cowrie shells. Fula women often use [[henna]] for hand, arm and feet decorations. Their long hair is put into five long braids that either hang or are sometimes looped on the sides. It is common for women and girls to have silver coins and [[amber]] attached to their braids. Some of these coins are very old and have been passed down in the family. The women often wear many bracelets on their wrists. The women can also be seen wearing a colorful cloth (''modjaare'') around, the waist, head or over one shoulder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Picturing Pity: Pitfalls and pleasures in cross-cultural communication – image and word in a North Cameroon mission |author=[[Marianne Gullestad]] |page=130 |publisher=Berghahn Books |year=2007 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SGYA2fpt0bwC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;lpg=PA130&amp;dq=fulani+modjaare&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zAWll9wKwk&amp;sig=OpH3-PswH2v1E6UUf4MMsoHOb5o&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIlvb_zs_XAhWCKJoKHcZ2CiIQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=fulani%20modjaare&amp;f=false |isbn=9781845453435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the men, the women have markings on their faces around their eyes and mouths that they were given as children. The Western Fulbe in countries like Mali, Senegal and Mauritania use [[indigo]] inks around the mouth, resulting in a blackening around the lips and gums.

Fulani men are often seen wearing solid-colored shirt and pants which go down to their lower calves, made from locally grown cotton, a long cloth wrapped around their faces, and a [[Fulani hat|conical hat made from straw and leather]] on their turbans, and carrying their walking sticks across their shoulders with their arms resting on top of it. Often the men have markings on either side of their faces and/or on their foreheads. They received these markings as children. Fula ethics are strictly governed by the notion of ''pulaaku''. Women wear long robes with flowery shawls. They decorate themselves with necklaces, earrings, nose rings and anklets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamtan.com/jamtan/fulani.cfm?chap=1&amp;linksPage=155 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227165525/http://www.jamtan.com/jamtan/fulani.cfm?chap=1&amp;linksPage=155 |archivedate=2007-12-27 |title=Pulaaku Ethics |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-12-27 |accessdate=2013-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Herding===
Fula are primarily known to be [[Pastoralism|pastoralist]]s, but are also traders in some areas. Most Fula in the countryside spend long times alone on foot, and can be seen frequently parading with their cattle throughout the west African [[hinterland]], moving their herds in search of water and better pasture. They were, and still are, the only major migratory people group of West Africa, although the [[Tuareg people]], another nomadic tribe of North African origin, live just immediately north of Fula territory, and sometimes live alongside the Fulani in countries such as Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso. The Fulani, as a result of their constant wandering of the past, can be seen in every climatic zone and habitat of West Africa, from the deserts of the north, to the derived [[savannah]] and forests of the south.

From the 16th to 20th centuries many Fulani communities settled in the highlands of the [[Jos Plateau]], the [[Western High Plateau]] of Bamenda, and [[Adamawa Plateau]] of Nigeria and the Cameroons. These are the highest elevated places in West Africa, and their altitude can reach up to 8,700 feet above sea level. The highland plateaus have a more temperate climate conducive for cattle herding activities, which allowed Fulbe populations to settle there in waves of migrations from further west. Though most Fula now live in towns or villages, a large proportion of the population is still either fully nomadic, or semi-nomadic in nature.

Wealth is counted by how large the herd of cattle is. Long ago Fulani tribes and clans used to fight over cattle and grazing rights. Being the most treasured animal that the Fulanis herd, the cows are very special. Many people say that a person cannot speak Fulfulde if he does not own a cow. The Fulani have a tradition of giving a ''habbanaya'' – a cow which is loaned to another until she calves. Once the calf is weaned it is retained and the cow is returned to its owner. This habbanaya is a highly prized animal. Upon receipt of this gift, there is a special ceremony in honor of the gift. The recipient buys special treats and invites his neighbors for this event in which the habbanaya is given a name. The habbanaya is never to be struck under any circumstance.

[[File:N'Dama herd in West Africa.jpg|thumb|An [[N'Dama]] herd in West Africa]]
Fulani nomads keep various species of cattle, but the [[zebu]] is the most common in the West African hinterland, due to its drought resistant traits. In the wetter areas of Fouta Djallon and Casamance, the dwarf [[N'Dama]] is more common, as they are highly resistant to [[Animal trypanosomiasis|trypanosomiasis]] and other conditions directly associated with high humidity. Subspecies of zebu include the [[White Fulani cattle]], locally known as the Aku, Akuji, Bororoji, White Kano, Yakanaji or Bunaji, which are an important beef breed of cattle found throughout the area conquered by the Fulani people and beyond in the Sahel zone of Africa.&lt;ref name="dagris.ilri.cgiar.org"/&gt;

The [[Red Fulani cattle]], which are called the Jafun {{lang-fr|Djafoun}} in Nigeria and Cameroon, and Fellata in Chad, as well as other names such as the M'Bororo, Red Bororo, or Bodaadi, another subspecies is the ''Sokoto Gudali'' and the ''Adamawa Gudali'' or simply ''Gudali'', which means "horned and short legged" in the Hausa language. The widely accepted theory for the origin of present-day zebu cattle in West Africa is that they came from the westward spread of the early zebu populations in East Africa through the Sudan. Other breeds of zebu are found mainly in the drier regions. Their body conformation resembles the zebu cattle of eastern Africa. The zebu did not appear in West Africa until about 1800.&lt;ref name="dagris.ilri.cgiar.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dagris.ilri.cgiar.org/display.asp?ID=77 |title=DAGRIS |publisher=Dagris.ilri.cgiar.org |date=2009-10-20 |accessdate=2014-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610032236/http://dagris.ilri.cgiar.org/display.asp?ID=77 |archivedate=2015-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing aridity of the climate and the deterioration of the environment in the Sahel appear to have favoured the introduction and spread of the zebu, as they are superior to longhorn and shorthorn [[cattle]] in withstanding drought conditions.

The origins and classification of the Fulani remains controversial; one school of thought is of the opinion that the Fulani cattle are truly long-horned zebus that first arrived in Africa from Asia on the east coast; these are believed to have been introduced into West Africa by Arab invaders during the seventh century, roughly about the same time that the short-horned zebus arrived into East Africa. This theory is supported by the appearance of the skull as well as the thoracic hump of the Fulani cattle.&lt;ref name="dagris.ilri.cgiar.org"/&gt;

Another school of thought contends that these cattle originated from the Horn of Africa, present-day Ethiopia and Somalia, and that interbreeding between the short-horned zebu (which arrived in the Horn around the first millennium BC) and the ancient Hamitic Longhorn and/or ''B. taurus brachyceros'' shorthorn (which had arrived much earlier) occurred in the Horn about 2000–1500 BCE. The subsequent successive introductions of the short-horned zebu are believed to have displaced most [[sanga cattle]] into southern Africa.&lt;ref name="dagris.ilri.cgiar.org"/&gt;

During this period of constant movement of people and animals within Africa, some of these sanga cattle probably intermixed with the short-horned, thoracic-humped cattle to produce the thoracic-humped sanga. The latter may have migrated, most probably along with the spread of Islam, westerly to constitute what are today the lyre-horned cattle of West and Central Africa, including the Fulani cattle. Originally the White Fulani were indigenous to north Nigeria, southeast Niger and northeast Cameroon, owned by both Fulani and Hausa people. They then spread to southern Chad and western Sudan.&lt;ref name="dagris.ilri.cgiar.org"/&gt;

Every year, in the Malian town of [[Diafarabé]], Fulani men cross the [[Niger River]] with their cattle, in an annual cycle of transhumance. This annual festival is known in the local Fulfulde as the ''Dewgal''. Since the founding of the village in 1818, it has always been the most important Fulani festival. It takes place on a Saturday in November or December; the day is carefully chosen based on the state of pastures and the water levels in the river Niger. During the rainy season, the river swells, and the areas around the village are inundated in water, as the level of the river Niger rises, and turns Diafarabe into an island. The cattle are kept on the lush fields up north or south, but when the West African Monsoon subsides and the drier season returns, the water level drops and the cattle can return home again.&lt;ref name="africareview.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africareview.com/Arts-and-Culture/Courtship-by-the-river-as-cows-return-home/-/979194/1055420/-/v41ix5/-/index.html |title=Courtship by the river as cows return home - Arts and Culture |publisher=africareview.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chris Caldicott"&gt;{{cite news |author=Chris Caldicott |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/take-me-to-the-river-1350267.html |title=Take me to the river - Travel |newspaper=The Independent |date=1996-11-02 |accessdate=2014-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="15 November 2012"&gt;{{cite web|author=15 November 2012 |url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/mali/travel-tips-and-articles/77554 |title=Dewgal (Crossing of the Cattle): a celebration of greener pastures |publisher=Lonely Planet |date=2012-11-15 |accessdate=2014-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crossing is more than a search for pastures; it is also a competition to show craftsmanship as a herdsmen. The cattle are driven into the river, and each herder, with no help from others, loudly encourages the animals to move forward as he stands or swims between them, holding on to the horns of the bulls. The smaller animals don't have to swim, but are lifted into [[pirogue]]s. When all the cattle are back, they are judged by a panel, which decides whose animals are the "fattest". That herder is awarded "best caretaker", and he is awarded by the community.&lt;ref name="africareview.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chris Caldicott"/&gt;&lt;ref name="15 November 2012"/&gt; The worst caretaker ends up with a shameful "prize" – a peanut.

Besides being a competition of herdsmanship, it is also a social event; the herdsmen return after having been away for the most part of the year and they meet their family and friends again. It is a time for celebration. The women decorate their house with woven mats and paint the floor with white and black clay, braid their hair with very intricate patterns, and dress up for their husbands and loved ones. Impressed by the cultural significance attached to the annual event, [[UNESCO]] included it on its list of world cultural heritage events.&lt;ref name="africareview.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chris Caldicott"/&gt;&lt;ref name="15 November 2012"/&gt;

===Music===
[[File:Fulani traditional dance costume.jpg|thumb|Fulani dancers in their full traditional regalia.]]
The Fula have a rich musical culture and play a variety of traditional instruments including drums, ''[[xalam|hoddu]]'' (a plucked skin-covered lute similar to a banjo), and ''riti'' or ''riiti'' (a one-string bowed instrument similar to a violin), in addition to vocal music. The well-known Senegalese Fula musician [[Baaba Maal]] sings in Pulaar on his recordings. ''Zaghareet'' or ululation is a popular form of vocal music formed by rapidly moving the tongue sideways and making a sharp, high sound.

Fulani music is as varied as its people. The numerous sub-groups all maintain unique repertoires of music and dance. Songs and dances reflect traditional life and are specifically designed for each individual occasion. Music is played at any occasion: when herding cattle, working in the fields, preparing food, or at the temple. Music is extremely important to the village life cycle with field cultivation, harvest and winnowing of millet performed to the rhythm of the songs and drums.

Fulani herders have a special affinity for the flute and violin ''nianioru''. The young Fulani shepherd like to whistle and sing softly as they wander the silent savannah with cattle and goats. The truly Fulani instruments are the one-string viola of the Fulani (nianioru), the flute, the two to five string lute ''hoddu'' or ''molo'', and the ''buuba'' and ''bawdi'' set of drums. But they are also influenced by the other instruments of the region such as the beautiful West African harp, the kora, and the balafon. Entertainment is the role of certain casts. The performance of music is the realm of specialized casts. The Griots or ''Awlube'' recite the history of the people, places and events of the community.

===Food===
[[File:Paoua - Peul calabashes used for cheese production.jpg|thumb|Fulani [[calabash]]es used for butter and milk storage and as containers for hawking]]
''Kossam'' can be the general term for both fresh milk miradam and yoghurt known as ''pendidan'' in Fulfulde. It is central to Fulbe identity and revered as a drink or in one of its various processed forms, such as yoghurt and cheese. ''Kettugol'' and ''lébol'' are derived from milk fat, are used in light cooking and hair weaving. It is common to see Fulani women hawking milk products in characteristic beautifully decorated calabashes balanced on their heads. Other meals include a heavy grease ''(nyiiri)'' made of flour from such grains as millet, sorghum, or corn which is eaten in combination with soup (''takai'', ''haako'') made from tomatoes, onions, spices, peppers, and other vegetables.&lt;ref name="everyculture"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/wc/Germany-to-Jamaica/Fulani.html |title=Fulani - Introduction, Location, Language, Folklore, Religion, Major holidays, Rites of passage, Relationships, Living conditions |publisher=Everyculture.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another popular meal eaten by almost all Fulani communities is made from fermenting milk into yoghurt and eaten with corn [[couscous]] known as ''latchiiri'' or ''dakkere'', either in the same bowl or separately, also a fluid or porridge called ''gāri'' made of flour cereals such as millet, sorghum or corn and milk. The [[Wodaabe]] traditionally eat millet, milk and meat as staples. Millet is eaten in the morning, noon and night as a grease with a sauce or stew which usually contains tomatoes, peppers, bone, meat, onion, and other vegetables. On special occasions they eat meat such as goat or beef. A thick beverage similar to the Tuareg ''eghajira'' is made by pounding goat cheese, milk, dates and millet.

===Houses===
Traditionally, nomadic Fula live in domed houses known as a ''bukkaru'' or ''suudu hudo'', literally "grass house". During the dry season, the characteristically hemisphere-shaped domed houses are supported by compact millet stalk pillars, and by reed mats held together and tied against wood poles, in the wet or rainy season. These mobile houses are very easy to set up, and dismantle, as typical of houses from nomadic societies. When it is time to move, the houses are easily disassembled and loaded onto donkeys, horses or camels for transport. With recent trends however, many Fula now live in mud or concrete block houses.

Once they are set up, the room is divided into a sleeping compartment, and another compartment where calabashes and guards of all sizes are intricately arranged in a stack according to their sizes and functions. Spoons made from [[gourd]]a are hung from the rooftop, with others meant for grain storage.

==Genomic studies==
{{anchor|Genetics}}
The paternal lineages of the Fula/Fulɓe/Fulani tend to vary depending on geographic location. According to a study by Cruciani et al. (2002), around 90% of Fulani individuals from [[Burkina Faso]] carried haplotype 24, which corresponds with the [[haplogroup E-V38]] that is common in West Africa. The remainder belonged to haplotype 42/[[haplogroup E-M132]]. Both of these clades are today most frequent among [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo-speaking]] populations, particularly those inhabiting [[Senegal]]. Similarly, 53% of the Fulani in northern [[Cameroon]] bore haplogroup E-M132, with the rest mainly carrying other African clades (12% [[Macro-haplogroup A(X-BT)|haplogroup A]] and 6% haplogroup E1b1a). A minority carried the West Eurasian haplogroups [[Haplogroup T-M184|T]] (18%) and [[Haplogroup R1|R1]] (12%).&lt;ref name = "Cruciani2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cruciani | first1 = Fulvio | last2 = Santolamazza | first2 = Piero | last3 = Shen | first3 = Peidong | title = A Back Migration from Asia to Africa Is Supported by High-Resolution Analysis of Human Y-Chromosome Haplotypes | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 70 |issue=5 | pages = 1197–1214 | doi=10.1086/340257 | pmid=11910562 | pmc=447595|display-authors=etal | date=May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mulcare et al. (2004) observed a similar frequency of haplogroup R1 subclades in their Fulani samples from Cameroon (18%).&lt;ref name="Mulcare"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The T Allele of a Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism 13.9 kb Upstream of the Lactase Gene (LCT) (C−13.9kbT) Does Not Predict or Cause the Lactase-Persistence Phenotype in Africans |year=2004 |last1=Mulcare |first1=Charlotte A. |last2=Weale |first2=Michael E. |last3=Jones |first3=Abigail L. |last4=Connell |first4=Bruce |last5=Zeitlyn |first5=David |last6=Tarekegn |first6=Ayele |last7=Swallow |first7=Dallas M. |last8=Bradman |first8=Neil |last9=Thomas |first9=Mark G. |journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=74 |issue=6 |pages=1102–1110 |doi=10.1086/421050 |pmid=15106124 |pmc=1182074}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Hassan et al. (2008) on the Fulani in [[Sudan]] observed a significantly higher occurrence of the West Eurasian haplogroup R1 (53.8%). The remainder belonged to various Afro-Asiatic associated [[Haplogroup E-M215 (Y-DNA)|haplogroup E-M215]] subclades, including 34.62% [[Haplogroup E-V68|E-M78]] and 27.2% [[Haplogroup E-V68#E-V22|E-V22]].&lt;ref name="DoiajpaMissing"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ajpa.20876 |title=Y-chromosome variation among Sudanese: Restricted gene flow, concordance with language, geography, and history |year=2008 |last1=Hassan |first1=Hisham Y. |last2=Underhill |first2=Peter A. |last3=Cavalli-Sforza |first3=Luca L. |last4=Ibrahim |first4=Muntaser E. |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology |volume=137 |issue=3 |pages=316–23 |pmid=18618658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bučková et al. (2013) similarly observed significant frequencies of the haplogroups R1b and E1b1b in their pastoralist Fulani groups from [[Niger]]. E1b1b attained its highest frequencies among the local Fulani Ader (60%) and R1b among the Fulani Zinder (~31%). This was in sharp contrast to most of the other Fulani pastoralist groups elsewhere, including those from Burkina Faso, Cameroon, [[Mali]] and [[Chad]]. All of these latter Fulani communities instead bore over 69–75% West African paternal haplogroups.&lt;ref name="Bučková"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Multiple and differentiated contributions to the male gene pool of pastoral and farmer populations of the African Sahel |year=2013 |last1=Bučková |first1=Jana |last2=Cerný |first2=Viktor |last3=Novelletto |first3=Andrea |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology |volume=151 |pages=10–21 |pmid=23460272 |issue=1 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.22236 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MtDNA (maternal)===
In contrast to their heterogeneous paternal lineages, the Fulani largely cluster maternally with other Niger-Congo populations. Only 8.1% of their mtDNA clades were associated with West Eurasian or Afro-Asiatic groups (J1b, U5, H, and V):&lt;ref name="Missingor"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1690087 |year=1990 |last1=Miller |first1=MS |title=Differential effects of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine on constitutive and hormone-inducible gene expression in rat hepatoma cells |volume=73 |issue=2–3 |pages=207–19 |journal=Chemico-biological interactions |doi=10.1016/0009-2797(90)90004-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mark S. Miller,&lt;ref name="Missingor" /&gt; a study of four Fulani nomad populations (n = 186) in three countries in the Sahel (Chad, Cameroon, and Burkina Faso), the only group of nomadic Fulani that manifests some similarities with geographically related agricultural populations (from Guinea-Bissau and Nigeria) comes from Tcheboua in northern Cameroon.

===Autosomal DNA (overall)===
According to Tishkoff et al. (2009), the Fulani's genomic ancestry clusters near that of [[Chadic languages|Chadic]] and [[Central Sudanic languages|Central Sudanic]] speaking populations. Based on this, the researchers suggest that the Fulani may have adopted a Niger-Congo language at some point in their history while intermarrying with local populations. Additionally, low to moderate levels of West Eurasian admixture was also observed in the Fulani samples, which the authors propose may have been introduced via the [[Iberian Peninsula]].&lt;ref name="Tishkoff"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Genetic Structure and History of Africans and African Americans |year=2009 |last1=Tishkoff |first1=S.

About a quarter of a million [[Germans|German nationals]] had permanent residence in [[Switzerland]] in 2009, rising to some 300 thousand five years later.

== History – looking back ==
Ever since the emergence of [[Early Modern Switzerland|Switzerland]] and [[Early Modern Germany|Germany]] as distinct nations in the [[Early Modern period]] – the Swiss became exempt from the jurisdiction of the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] in 1499 as a result of the [[Swabian War]], formal recognition of Swiss independence dates to 1648 ([[Peace of Westphalia]]) – there has been considerable population movement in both directions, but meaningful population statistics become available only after the [[Napoleonic era]], with the formation of the [[restored Swiss Confederacy]] and the [[German Confederation]] in 1815.

A number of Germans, and of people living in Germany, fled the [[militarism]] of [[German Empire]] and, shortly afterwards, the [[Nazism|Nazi regime]] or were expelled by it,  in the first decades of the 20th century and sought refuge in Switzerland, among other places.

==21st century - 1st decades==

===Demographics===
Because of the unequal size of the two countries, Germany being roughly ten times larger than Switzerland, German residents in Switzerland have a much greater visibility than Swiss residents in Germany:
In 2007, about 37,000 Swiss nationals, or about 1 in 180 Swiss citizens, lived in Germany, accounting for just 0.05% of German population.
At the same time, about 224,000 German nationals, or 1 in 350 German citizens, lived in Switzerland, accounting for 3% of Swiss population.&lt;ref&gt;Note that this comparison ignores [[dual citizenship]]. As of 2007, Switzerland recorded 75,000 Swiss citizens residing in Germany, while Germany recorded only 37,000 foreign nationals with Swiss citizenship, suggesting that the remaining 38,000 people have dual Swiss-German citizenship.{{Dubious|date=June 2011}}&lt;!--this needs to be verified. Prior to 2007 there wasn't even any Swiss-German dual citizenship, where did these 38,000 people suddenly come from? Why does Switzerland list 75,000 Swiss in Germany, but Germany only 37,000 Swiss in Germany?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of Germans in Switzerland has doubled in the period of 2002 to 2009. The reason for this is the [[Switzerland – European Union relations|Swiss&amp;ndash;European treaty]] regarding the [[freedom of movement for workers]], activated in 2002.{{fact|date=January 2018}}
While  the freedom of movement treaty applies to all EU citizens, German nationals have been the main beneficiaries because their proficiency in the [[Standard German|German language]] allows them to take qualified jobs in [[German-speaking Switzerland]] without the added difficulty of a language barrier.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

As of 2009, they were the second-largest expatriate group in Switzerland, numbering 266,000 (or 3.4% of total Swiss population) second to the [[Italian immigration to Switzerland|Italians]] with 294,000 (3.7% of total Swiss population). 22,000 were born in Switzerland (of these, 18,000 were minors, children born to German parents living in Switzerland). 19,000 Germans with permanent residence in Switzerland were married to a Swiss citizen.

In 2007, the number of Germans in Switzerland passed the historical maximum of 220,000 Germans recorded prior to [[World War I]].
However, because of the lower total population at the time, the pre-1914 fraction of Germans relative to total Swiss population was as high as 6%.
The rate of [[Swiss nationality law|naturalizations]] has also steeply increased since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/schweiz/standard/Pro-Tag-werden-10-Deutsche-eingebuergert/story/27541536?track Pro Tag werden 10 Deutsche eingebürgert]'', [[Tages-Anzeiger]], 30 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this, beyond the rising number of qualifying German nationals who had resided in Switzerland for the twelve years required by Swiss nationality law, was a change in German nationality law which
permitted German nationals to hold Swiss-German [[dual citizenship]] (while prior to 2007, Germans wishing to be naturalized in Switzerland had to give up their German citizenship).&lt;ref&gt;Renat Künzi: ''[http://www.swissinfo.ch/ger/Home/Archiv/Deutsch-schweizerische_Doppelbuerger_behalten_roten_Pass.html?cid=6083040 Deutsch-schweizerische Doppelbürger behalten roten Pass]'', [[Swissinfo]], 31 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

German citizens have mostly settled in [[Zürich]] and the city's wider [[Zürich metropolitan area|metropolitan area]].
Already at the historical maximum of German presence in Switzerland in 1910, German population in Zürich was as high as 41,000 or 22% of the city's total population.
As of 2009, German population in Zürich was at about 30,000, or close to 8%.&lt;ref name="zeit090326"/&gt;
As of 2015 this population counted 33,297, slightly above 8% of the 410,404 inhabitants, of which 131,168 were foreigners, some third of all people of the city of Zurich.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/portal/de/index/portraet_der_stadt_zuerich/zahlen_u_fakten.html Zahlen und Fakten : Bevölkerung]'', city of Zurich, stadt-zuerich.ch&lt;/ref&gt;

While Swiss opposition against immigration from Southeast Europe and [[African immigrants to Switzerland|Africa]] is – as in other places – characterized by concerns about [[immigrant criminality#Switzerland|criminality]] and the burden put on [[social welfare]] by large numbers of lower class or [[Poverty in Switzerland|destitute]] immigrants, opposition to immigration from Germany has a contrary motivation, notably the fear of competition from qualified immigrants on the job market,&lt;ref name="helbling"&gt;Helbling (2009-11), see below&lt;/ref&gt; and rising prices on the real-estate market because of the increased demand created by well-to-do German immigrants, while in terms of [[crime rate]], the German community was recorded as the group with lowest delinquency, at only 0.6% of the crime rate among Swiss nationals.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/schweiz/standard/Neue-Statistik-Tamilen-sind-krimineller-als-ExJugoslawen/story/27784193 Neue Statistik: Tamilen sind krimineller als Ex-Jugoslawen]'', [[Tagesanzeiger]], 12 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent of and reasons for Swiss opposition to German immigration were studied in Helbling (2009–11), based on a survey from 1994-95 of 1,300 Swiss (of which some 940 responded) from the city of [[Zürich]]&lt;ref name="uzh95-94"&gt;Institute of Sociology of the [[University of Zurich|Zurich University]], October 1994 to March 1995, 1'300 targeted participants between 18 and 65 of age, response rate 72%, i.e. some 940 respondents (source: Helbling 2009-11) – a survey conducted by Jörg Stolz (et al.?), published in German: ''Soziologie der Fremdenfeindlichkeit. Theoretische und empirische Analysen'', Campus, Frankfurt/New York 2000 and ''Einstellungen zu Ausländern und Ausländerinnen 1969 und 1995: eine Replikationsstudie'', in: Hans-Joachim Hoffmann-Nowotny (publisher): ''Das Fremde in der Schweiz'', Seismo, Zurich 2001, pp.33–74&lt;/ref&gt; (Zurich, and the Zurich area, are the main target of recent German immigration – see demographics above). The survey found that, in 1994-95, the Germans were the fourth-most disliked immigrant group in Zürich (disliked by almost each 9th). Following – with a distance – the immigrants from [[Turks in Switzerland|Turkey]] (disliked by each 3rd to 4th), the [[Arab World]] (disliked by each 3rd) and [[Former Yugoslavia]] (considered as a single group, disliked by each 2nd). And disliked slightly more than the  [[Tamils in Switzerland|Tamils]] (disliked by each 10th) and [[Black Africans in Switzerland|Black Africans]] (disliked by each narrowly under each 10th of the 940 respondents).

&lt;/div&gt;

Helbling concludes – summing up further literature and media – that "German immigrants put in danger Swiss characteristics as much as immigrants from the Balkans", that "contrary to many other studies, education does not improve attitudes towards Germans", that "people who are young and seek to improve their job position are significantly more Germanophobic than those who are satisfied with their current job situation and are already established" and that "it appears that as much as low-skilled workers fear that poorly educated immigrants take their jobs, well-educated Swiss consider German immigrants as competitors on the job market".&lt;ref name="helbling"/&gt;

As to the feeling of the "intimidated" part of Swiss-Germans, feeling being left-behind, the journalist Gunhild Kübler, a German living in Switzerland, remarks:

{{Quote|China has 1.3 billion people, 16 times more than Germany. The Federal Republic again exactly 16 times as many as the German-speaking Switzerland. So, if a German would put himself in the position of an intimidated German Swiss, he may well imagine that his country is not adjacent in the East to the Czech Republic but to China.|Gunhild Kübler&lt;ref name="tagesspiegel090624"&gt;Marco Lauer: ''[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/international/integration-i-ha-di-gaern-deutsche-in-der-schweiz/1543294.html Integration: I ha di gärn! - Deutsche in der Schweiz]'', [[Tagesspiegel]] June 24, 2009 / also as: ''[http://www.taz.de/!5153955/ Integration für Deutsche in der Schweiz: "Grüezi Gummihälse!"]'', [[Die Tageszeitung|TAZ]], October 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cristiana Baldauf, one of the course leaders of the Swiss integration courses for Germans and Austrians, and a German and Swiss citizen, with a German mother and Italian father, says:
{{Quote|I think, that what the Swiss dislike about the Germans, is the German in themselves.|Cristiana Baldauf&lt;ref name="zeit090326"/&gt;}}

;Integration – differences in culture, behavior, manners, language problems

Experience shows that the excitement fades away on every major wave of immigration with its increasing integration. So, a.o. also Helbling&lt;ref name="helbling"/&gt; cites the popular example of now largely integrated Italians, who came in one of the "waves" in the '60s as [[gastarbeiter]]s to Switzerland, and whose generations are today a part of the society of the German-speaking Switzerland, without giving up their culture.

{{Quote|It is particularly notable that Italians are the most liked immigrants, while at their arrival in the 1950s and 1960s they were the group of immigrants that attracted the most hostilities.|Marc Helbling&lt;ref&gt;Marc Helbling summing up Gianni D’Amato (2001) and Josef M. Niederberger (2004) in: ''[https://bibliothek.wzb.eu/pdf/2010/iv10-702.pdf Germanophobia in Switzerland]'' (PDF), Discussion Paper SP IV 2010-702, [[WZB]] Berlin, May 2010, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the relations of the German-Swiss and the incoming German come up, overtly or covertly, specific misunderstandings – perceived similarities, different mentalities and manners and, now already well known, language problems and differences.&lt;ref name="zeit090326"/&gt;&lt;ref name="helbling"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tagesspiegel090624"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sueddeutsche100517"&gt;Cristiana Baldauf-Hornig: ''[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/deutsche-in-der-schweiz-vorsicht-vor-fraenkli-und-grueezi-1.79758 Deutsche in der Schweiz: Vorsicht vor Fränkli und Grüezi] – Wie es Deutsche schaffen, bei Schweizern nicht anzuecken'', [[Süddeutsche Zeitung|SZ]], 17 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also ''Literatur - Beletristik, populär'' on German Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;

Cristiana Baldauf comments on the fundamental differences, on the petty ones and on the different languages:
{{Quote|One has to bear in mind that the Swiss are ticking quite differently as we do.|Cristiana Baldauf&lt;ref name="zeit090326"/&gt;}}
{{Quote|Often just minor differences bear a potential for misunderstanding. | Cristiana Baldauf&lt;ref name = "sueddeutsche100517"/&gt;}}
{{Quote|The language plays a central role in the misunderstanding. The Swiss German is more than just a dialect for most German-speaking Swiss, it is the mother tongue, the language of the heart. Much of what has to do with proximity is expressed with the Swiss German: intimacy, spontaneity and emotions [...]&lt;br&gt;
High German is indeed learned and spoken at school, although the active knowledge remains hidden away in the cellar, often making the Swiss feeling inferior to the eloquent Germans.|Cristiana Baldauf&lt;ref name="sueddeutsche100517"/&gt;}}

Like his female counterpart, the [[scullery maid]], the hall boy would have been expected to work up to 16 hours per day, seven days per week.  His duties were often among the most disagreeable in the house, such as emptying [[chamber pot]]s for the higher-ranking servants, and (in the absence of a [[boot boy]]) cleaning the [[boot]]s.  

A hall boy could rise through the ranks and, if fortunate, eventually become a [[valet]] or [[butler]].  Arthur Inch, butler technical consultant for the film ''[[Gosford Park]]'', stated in an interview that he began his life in service as a hall boy at the age of 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The butler did it--but how? |first=Patricia Dane |last=Rogers |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-11-30/features/0311300514_1_napkins-tables-dinner |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |agency=''[[The Washington Post]]'' |date=30 November 2003 |accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19124">The modern '''history of hypertension''' begins with the understanding of the cardiovascular system based on the work of physician [[William Harvey]] (1578–1657), who  described the circulation of blood in his book "''De motu cordis''".

Consequently, hypertension was often classified into "malignant" and "benign". In 1931, John Hay, Professor of Medicine at [[Liverpool University]], wrote that "there is some truth in the saying that the greatest danger to a man with a high blood pressure lies in its discovery, because then some fool is certain to try and reduce it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hay J | title = A British Medical Association Lecture on THE SIGNIFICANCE OF A RAISED BLOOD PRESSURE | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 2 | issue = 3679 | pages = 43–7 | date = July 1931 | pmid = 20776269 | pmc = 2314188 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.2.3679.43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moser/&gt; This view was echoed by the eminent US cardiologist [[Paul Dudley White]] in 1937, who suggested that "hypertension may be an important compensatory mechanism which should not be tampered with, even if we were certain that we could control it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=White PD |title=Heart Disease | edition=2nd | location=New York, NY | publisher=MacMillan Co. | year=1937| page=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Friedberg's 1949 classic textbook "Diseases of the Heart",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Friedberg CK | title=Diseases of the Heart| location=Philadelphia, PA| publisher=WB Saunders Co | year=1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that "people with 'mild benign' hypertension&amp;nbsp;...

==Treatment and Medications==
Historically  the treatment for what was called the "hard pulse disease" consisted in reducing the quantity of blood by [[blood letting]] or the application of [[leech]]es.&lt;ref name="Esunge1991rev"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Esunge PM | title = From blood pressure to hypertension: the history of research | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 84 | issue = 10 | pages = 621 | date = October 1991 | pmid = 1744849 | pmc = 1295564 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was advocated by The [[Yellow Emperor]] of China, [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Cornelius Celsus]], [[Galen]], and [[Hippocrates]].&lt;ref name="Esunge1991rev" /&gt;

'''Irarutu''', '''Irahutu''', or '''Kasira''', is an [[Austronesian language]] of most of the interior of the [[Bomberai Peninsula]] of New Guinea.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trends in Linguistics: Comparative Austronesian Dictionary An Introduction to Austronesian Studies Part 1|last=Tyron|first=Darrell|publisher=|year=1995|isbn=3111797082|location=|pages=638|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name “Irarutu” comes from the language itself, where “ira” conjoins with “ru” to create “their voice”. When put together with “tu”, which on its own means “true”, the meaning of the name becomes “Their true voice” or “The people’s true language”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Kuri language (Austronesian)|Kuri]] is very close lexically, but has not been formally classified. Other than this, Irarutu is quite divergent among the [[Central Malayo-Polynesian languages]].  Irarutu is one of the many languages found in the South Halmahera subgroup of Austronesian languages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are seven variations found within the language: Nabi, Babo, Kasuri, Fruata, South-Arguni, East-Arguni, North-Arguni.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Grammar ==
Irarutu follows the "Subject, Verb, Object" (SVO) format in word order. Adjectives such as "big" or a numbered value come after the noun, but for lineage-related matters the initial ancestor comes before the descendant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

/p, t, c, k, b, d, ɟ, g, are all stops with /p, t, c, k/ being voiceless and /b, d, ɟ, g,/ being voiced. All stop consonants can be placed in any position (beginning, middle, or end) with the exception of /c/ which cannot be placed in the ending position.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of Irarutu, A language of West Papua, Indonesia, With Historical Analysis|last=Jackson|first=Jason Alexander Johann|publisher=University of Hawaii at Manoa|year=2014|isbn=|location=University of Hawaii at Manoa|pages=7, 43, 44, 52|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

/f, s, h/ are all voiceless fricatives. /f/ is found in all 3 positions and is sometimes pronounced as a voiced /v/ due to biological features of Native Irarutu speakers. /s/ is also found in all 3 positions but is never voiced. /h/ is a new consonant sound which may have come from Arabic or a nearby dialect. /h/ is only found in initial and middle positions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

/m, n/ are both voiced nasals. Both consonants are found in all 3 positions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

/r/ is found in most Irarutu dialects, but is sometimes switched out with /l/.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

7 types of vowels are found in Irarutu, /a, e, ɪ, i, o, u, y/. The vowels can then be formed in two different ways, one being monophthongs and the other being diphthongs. Monophthongs are a single sounding vowel while diphthongs are a combination of two separate vowels. All 7 vowels can be used in monophthong form but diphthong is restricted to only a few combinations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Nouns ===
Nouns are words that can be placed in the “Subject” or “Object” portions of a sentence and can be modified for possessive relations. There are 3 functions of noun phrases: semantic function, pragmatic function, and grammatical function. In Irarutu, the grammatical function for nouns and pronouns do not differ for unique situations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

For possessive noun phrase there are usually no prefixes, suffixes, or any other alterations made to the noun of interest. The only cases where changes to the word are made are for body parts, names, and one's child.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Verbs ===
Both transitive and intransitive verbs are found in the Irarutu language. These verbs are conjoined with prefixed marks to show who is creating/causing the action. Up to three unique individuals can be indicated using these marks. Sounds within the verb can change if the verb stem begins with "t, ɪ, b, m, or s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Verb Function ====

There are three different types of prefixes relating the person who is creating the action. “a-“ refers to 1st person, “m-“ for 2nd and “n-“ for 3rd. “a-“ is used for 1st person cases but holds many rules along with it. “m-“ is seen in almost all cases for a 2nd person sentence and is sometimes accompanied by an inflection. “n-“ is present with a verb root in 3rd person and also tends to use inflection in the prefix.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Adjectives ===
Adjectives can be used to alter nouns or clauses and in most cases come after the statement it is altering. In Irarutu there is also a subclass of adjectives which differentiate the level of magnitude on which the adjective affects the subject/object. There are both clause-level and phrase-level adjectives, each of which affect the topic at hand differently. Nouns with multiple adjectives are indeed possible, but a bit uncommon. Adverbs exist but are often hard to point out in Irarutu sentence structure. Sometimes an entire phrase will be used to modify a verb or adjective. To make the meaning of a sentence clear, specific verbs, which can only be modified by certain adverbs, are used to show what part of the sentence is modifying what. The sequence and placement of the adverb also helps identify which part of the claim it is modifying.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5579">The '''Kurtey people''' (var. '''Kourtey''') are a small ethnic group found along the [[Niger River]] valley in parts of the [[West African]] nations of [[Niger]], [[Benin]], [[Mali]], and [[Nigeria]]. They are also found in considerable numbers in [[Ghana]], [[Togo]], [[Ivory Coast]], and [[Burkina Faso]]. 
==Assimilation into Songhai==
The Kurtey were formed from the movement of [[Fula people]] into the Niger River valley of modern [[Tillaberi Region]], Niger in the 18th century, and their intermarriage with local [[Songhai people|Songhai]], [[Zarma people|Zarma]], [[Sorko people|Sorko]] and others.&lt;ref name="Decalo1997"&gt;{{Cite book

They today number less than 50000, concentrated on islands and along the Niger river banks  near [[Sansani]], [[Dessa]] and [[Ayorou]]; in [[Niamey]] (especially in [[Koutoukalé]] quarter); and in villages along the lower middle Niger from Gao to northern Nigeria.&lt;ref name="Decalo1997" /&gt;  Some Kurtey continue to mark themselves with their traditional facial scarification: a small cross at the top of each cheekbone.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Stoller and Cheryl Olkes.

UN Integrated Regional Information Networks, 6 February 2004.

'''Maba''' (Maban, Mabang) is a [[Maban languages|Maban]] language spoken in [[Chad]] and [[Sudan]]. It is divided into several dialects, and serves as a local [[trade language]]. Maba is closely related to the [[Masalit language]].&lt;ref name="Ethnologuemls"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/mls|title=Masalit language|publisher=Ethnologue|accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a group of related languages spoken in the border area of Chad, the Sudan, and the Central African Republic. The Maban languages form a branch of the Nilo-Saharan language family. Maba (also called Bura Mabang) is the largest Maban language in terms of number of speakers (more than 250,000). Other members of the group include Karanga, Kibet, Massalat, Masalit (Massalit), Marfa, and Runga. Maban also includes two languages known by the names of their first investigators as Mimi of Nachtigal and Mimi of Gaudefroy-Demombynes (the latter also being referred to as Mime), both spoken in southeastern Chad.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22875">'''Marriage privatization''' is the concept that the [[state (polity)|state]] should have no authority to define the terms of [[personal relationship]]s such as [[marriage]]. Proponents of marriage privatization, including certain [[minarchism|minarchists]], [[anarchism|anarchists]], [[libertarianism|libertarians]], and opponents of government interventionism, claim that such relationships are best defined by private individuals and not the state. Arguments for the privatization of marriage have been offered by a number of scholars and writers. Proponents of marriage privatization often argue that privatizing marriage is a solution to the social controversy over [[same-sex marriage]]. Arguments for and against the privatization of marriage span both [[modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] political camps.

==Advocacy==

===Libertarian advocacy===
In 1997, [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[David Boaz]] wrote an article for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' titled “Privatize Marriage: A Simple Solution to the Gay-Marriage Debate." In the article, Boaz suggests privatizing marriage in a way that models the nature of standard business contracts. Boaz's idea is to allow two (possibly more) individuals to set the terms of their own private marital contract in a way that is best for the individuals involved. "When children or large sums of money are involved, an enforceable contract spelling out the parties' respective rights and obligations is probably advisable. But the existence and details of such an agreement should be up to the parties."&lt;ref&gt;Boaz (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Boaz the government could be called upon to enforce the contract but may have no other role in developing the contract and setting the terms.

In 2002, [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[Wendy McElroy]] echoed Boaz's business contract model in an essay for ''Ifeminists'' titled "It's Time to Privatize Marriage."

&lt;blockquote&gt;Marriage should be privatized. Let people make their own marriage contracts according to their conscience, religion and common sense. Those contracts could be registered with the state, recognized as legal and arbitrated by the courts, but the terms would be determined by those involved.&lt;ref&gt;McElroy (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

McElroy has also said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Why is marriage declining? One reason is that it has become a three-way contract between two people and the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/0702/0702marriage.htm |title=It's time to privatize marriage |publisher=Enterstageright.com |date=2002-07-22 |accessdate=2014-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2003, political columnist Ryan McMaken, writing on [[LewRockwell.com]], raised the issue of marriage privatization arguing that the rise of state-sanctioned marriage coincides historically with the expansion of government. In his article titled "Married to the State," McMaken wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The question we are then left with today is one of whether the churches and individuals should be looking to privatize marriage yet again and to begin making a distinction between secular contracts between private citizens and religious unions that should be kept beyond the power of the State. Such a move, of course, would bring with it new assumptions about the role of the State in divorce, children, and a variety of other aspects of family life. The State will not give up control over these things easily, for the assertion that the importance of marriage makes it a legitimate interest of the State is only true from the point of view of the State itself, for as the foundation of society, marriage and family cannot be entrusted to governments just to be blown about by the winds of democratic opinion, for the same government that has the power to protect can just as easily destroy.&lt;ref&gt;McMaken (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a similar libertarian vein, the radio talk-show host [[Larry Elder]] endorsed the privatization of marriage. In "The State Should Get Out of the Marriage Business", a 2004 article published in on the website Capitalism Magazine, Elder wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;How about government simply getting out of the marriage-license-granting business? (Ditto for government licenses necessary to cut hair, drive a taxi, open a business or enter a profession.) Leave marriage to non-governmental institutions, like churches, synagogues, mosques, and other houses of worship or private institutions. Adultery, although legal, remains a sin subject to societal condemnation. It's tough to legislate away condemnation or legislate in approval. Those who view same-sex marriage as sinful will continue to do so, no matter what the government, the courts or their neighbors say.&lt;ref&gt;Elder (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2006, law professor Colin P.A. Jones wrote an article appearing in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' titled "Marriage Proposal: Why Not Privatize?" following the business model for privatization Jones writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Subject to certain statutory constraints, businesspeople have long been free to form whatever sort of partnership they felt appropriate to their needs. Why not make the same possible for marriage, which is a partnership based on one of the oldest types of contractual relationships? &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marriage proposal: Why not privatize? / Partnerships could be tailored to fit|url=https://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/Marriage-proposal-Why-not-privatize-2523603.php|website=SFGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2009, author and journalist [[Naomi Wolf]] wrote about getting the state out of marriage in ''[[The Times]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let's also get the state out of the marriage union. In spite of the dress and the flowers, marriage is a business contract. Women, generally, don't understand this, until it hits them over the head upon divorce. Let's take a lead from our gay and lesbian friends, who, without state marriage, often create domestic partnerships with financial autonomy and unity spelt out. A heterosexual parallel: celebrate marriage with a religious or emotional ceremony—leave the state out of it—and create a business- or domestic-partner contract aligning the couple legally.&lt;ref&gt;Times (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Professor [[Gary Becker]], a winner of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]], has said that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;With marriage contracts that set out the couple's commitments, there is little reason why judges should retain their current involvement in marriage.&lt;ref&gt;"Why Every Married Couple Should Sign a Contract". Gary S. Becker. ''Business Week''. New York: December 29, 1997. Iss. 3559; p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As of 2015, the only known members of [[US Congress]] to support privatization of state marriage are Sen. [[Rand Paul]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://time.com/3939374/rand-paul-gay-marriage-supreme-court/?xid=fbshare | work=Time | title=Rand Paul: Privatize Marriage | date=June 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rep. [[Justin Amash]] (R–Michigan)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/29/justin-amash-doma-repeal_n_2981622.html|title=Justin Amash Backs DOMA Repeal On Twitter|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rep. [[Gary Palmer (politician)|Gary Palmer]] (R–Alabama).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2014/10/abortion_marijuana_and_same-se.html|title=Abortion, marijuana, and same-sex marriage: District 6 candidates state their positions|work=AL.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious advocacy===
[[Pepperdine University]] law professor [[Douglas Kmiec]] told the ''[[Catholic News Agency]]'' that churches that do not accept same-sex marriage have a genuine concern that they be subject to penalties such as losing public benefits or receiving lawsuits. He argued that the state should just allot people "civil licenses", with the terminology "marriage" left "as a religious concept" for groups to debate outside the scope of government.&lt;ref name=Kmiec&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/kmiec_proposes_end_of_legally_recognized_marriage/ |title=Kmiec proposes end of legally recognized marriage |publisher=Catholic News Agency |date=2009-05-28 |accessdate=2014-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberal advocacy===
Though often introduced from [[conservative]] [[Pundit (expert)|commentators]], marriage privatization has received attention from advocates on the left. In 2003 left-leaning political [[columnist]] and [[journalist]] [[Michael Kinsley]] wrote a second essay to appear in ''Slate'' on the topic. Kinsley's essay is titled "Abolish Marriage: Let's Really Get the Government out of Our Bedrooms." Kinsley follows the model set by his libertarian counterparts Boaz and McElroy; like Elder's he emphasizes marriage privatization's potential to end the controversy over same-sex marriage:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If marriage were an entirely private affair, all the disputes over gay marriage would become irrelevant. Gay marriage would not have the official sanction of government, but neither would straight marriage. There would be official equality between the two, which is the essence of what gays want and are entitled to. And if the other side is sincere in saying that its concern is not what people do in private, but government endorsement of a gay "lifestyle" or "agenda," that problem goes away, too.&lt;ref&gt;Kinsley (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Marriage privatization received attention from the legal scholar [[Alan Dershowitz]] in 2003 when Dershowitz wrote a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' editorial titled "To Fix Gay Dilemma, Government Should Quit the Marriage Business." More so than commentators from the right, Dershowitz frames his view on the topic in terms of [[church-state separation]]; unlike libertarian leaning discussions Dershowitz maintains that the state does have an interest in the [[secular]] rights of marriage. Dershowitz proposes that civil-unions as a [[secular]] replacement for state sanctioned marriage, be extended to both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. Under Dershowitz's conception of privatization, couples have a choice as to whether or not they wish to be married by a [[clergy]] willing to perform a [[Wedding|marriage ceremony]] or to exclusively partake of secular/state-sanctioned civil unions. Dershowitz writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Not only would this solution be good for gays and for those who oppose gay marriage on religious grounds, it would also strengthen the wall of separation between church and state by placing a sacred institution entirely in the hands of the church while placing a secular institution under state control.&lt;ref&gt;Dershowitz (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Public policy advocacy and academia===
In 2007 the [[Center for Inquiry]], a secular [[think tank]], released a position paper authored by analyst Ruth Mitchell titled "Same-Sex Marriage and Marriage". The paper argues from the separation of church and state that as long as marriage is available to heterosexual couples it ought to be equally available to [[LGBT]] couples. Nevertheless, the position paper claims that state endorsement of civil unions for both types of couples is the most appropriate policy in light of separation of church and state.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument for marriage privatization has also been formulated in [[academic]] scholarship. In 2008 an argument for marriage privatization appeared in the [[public policy]] journal ''Public Affairs Quarterly''. In that issue philosopher Lawrence Torcello offers a detailed model of marriage privatization based on the later political writings of the 20th century [[political philosopher]] [[John Rawls]]. The article is titled "Is The State Endorsement of Any Marriage Justifiable? Same-Sex Marriage, Civil Unions, and The Marriage Privatization Model."

In the 1993 book ''[[Political Liberalism]]'', Rawls argues that arguments in a [[Cultural pluralism|pluralistic]] [[society]] must be hashed out in terms that all members of that society can understand if not endorse. This means that in making public claims one must refrain from religious or otherwise controversial [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] claims that cannot, in principle, be equally endorsed by reasonable persons. In doing this, one is relying on what Rawls refers to as [[public reason]].

In his article, Torcello claims that any state endorsement of marriage represents an inappropriate [[public]] [[Testimonial|endorsement]] of a comprehensive religious or otherwise metaphysical [[doctrine]], which underlies any particular definition of marriage. Accordingly, taking public reason seriously leads to the idea that [[legalization]] of same-sex marriage may be just as neutrally unbalanced as its ban.&lt;ref name="Torcello 2008 p.51"&gt;Torcello 2008 p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; In place of the public institute of marriage, Torcello, like Dershowitz, argues that civil unions providing the full extent of marital benefits under law ought to be instituted for both heterosexual and homosexual couples.&lt;ref name="Torcello 2008 p.51"/&gt; According to the argument, such civil unions ought to replace the current legal institute of marriage. Once privatized, marriage is open for individuals to define and embrace or ignore as they see fit, within the scope of their [[Privacy|private]] religious or [[Philosophy|philosophical]] [[belief system]]s:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No religious model that rejects same-sex marriage would be required to perform same-sex marriages under this privatized model. Under this model a couple, either heterosexual or homosexual, would obtain a civil union in order to have public and legal recognition of their partnership; they would have a private marriage ceremony if they so chose in order to honor their private religious or philosophical concept of marriage.&lt;ref name="Torcello 2008 p.51"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a July 2008 article appearing in ''[[The Monist]]'' titled "Privatizing Marriage" [[Harvard]] Law Professor [[Cass Sunstein]] and [[University of Chicago]] economist [[Richard H. Thaler]] offer arguments for the privatization of marriage. Thaler and Sunstein also take up the topic in their co-authored 2008 book ''Nudge: Improving Decisions about Wealth, Health, and Happiness.'' Sunstein and Thaler argue for marriage privatization among other positions under the heading of what they call "Libertarian Paternalism".

==Arguments opposing the privatization of marriage==
Opposition to marriage privatization, like its endorsement, is equally likely to be found arising from conservative or liberal sources and a wide variety of objections are made.

Conservative [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[baptist]] [[R. Albert Mohler, Jr.]] has stated that he opposes the privatizaton of marriage because "markets do not always encourage or support moral behavior" and he believes the proposal would "[destroy] marriage as a public institution."&lt;ref&gt;Mohler (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Princeton University|Princeton]] professor [[Robert P. George]] has argued that marriage has an important cultural role in helping children develop into "basically honest, decent law-abiding people of goodwill—citizens—who can take their rightful place in society". Thus, he concludes, "Family is built on marriage, and government—the state—has a profound interest in the integrity and well-being of marriage, and to write it off as if it were purely a religiously significant action and not an institution and action that has a profound public significance, would be a terrible mistake".&lt;ref name=Kmiec/&gt;  This position is seconded by Jennifer Morse of the Witherspoon Institute, who argues that if literally anyone can define marriage as whatever they want, the state forfeits the ability to sufficiently secure the best interests of children.  She goes further, arguing that the logic of marriage privatization "at the expense of children, is a concept developed by adults that will benefit only adults."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2012/04/5073 |title=Privatizing marriage is unjust to children |last1=Morse |first1=Jennifer |last2= |first2= |date=4 April 2012 |website= |publisher=The Witherspoon Institute |access-date=11 August 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanley Kurtz]] of ''[[National Review]]'' has written that privatization would be a "disaster". He argued that government "still has to decide what sort of private unions merit benefits... under this privatization scheme", and then "we also get the same quarrels over social recognition that we got before privatization." He commented that the government will have to deal with [[polygamy|polygamous]], [[polyamory|polyamorous]], and [[incest]]uous relationships attempting to obtain contracts under the new scheme as well as attempts by heterosexual acquaintances to make "marriages of convenience" to obtain things such as spousal medical insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/117239/privatizing-marriage-stanley-kurtz |title=Privatizing Marriage |publisher=Nationalreview.com |date=2006-01-22 |accessdate=2014-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[National Review]]'' colleague [[Maggie Gallagher]] has also called privatization as a "fantasy" since "[t]here is scarcely a dollar that state and federal government spends on social programs that is not driven in large part by family fragmentation: crime, poverty, drug abuse, teen pregnancy, school failure, mental and physical health problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://article.nationalreview.com/269352/the-stakes/maggie-gallagher |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806085511/http://article.nationalreview.com/269352/the-stakes/maggie-gallagher |archivedate=2010-08-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues involved with privatizing marriage==
In general, a legal contract signed between two or more people will often include penalties for the severing of the contract by a party or parties. However, this generally does not apply to marriages in the US, which usually fall under the legal standard of [[no-fault divorce]]. It remains an open issue as to whether or not these quasi-marriage partnership contracts will be enforced with penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hotair.com/archives/2010/08/07/why-is-the-state-involved-in-marriage-at-all/ |title=Why is the state involved in marriage at all? |publisher=Hotair.com |date=2010-08-07 |accessdate=2014-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''men who have sex with men blood donor controversy''' is the dispute over prohibitions on donations of [[blood donation|blood]] or tissue for [[organ transplant]]s from [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM), a classification of men who engage (or have engaged in the past) in sex with other men, regardless of whether they identify themselves as [[bisexual]], [[gay]], or otherwise. Restrictions on donors are sometimes called "deferrals", since blood donors who are found ineligible may be found eligible at a later date. However, many deferrals are indefinite meaning that donation may not be accepted at any point in the future, thus constituting a [[de facto]] ban. Restrictions vary from country to country and in some countries practice of protected sex or periods of abstinence are not considered. The restrictions affect these men and, in some cases, any female sex partners. They do not otherwise affect other women, including [[women who have sex with women]]. The [[United States Food &amp; Drug Administration]] (FDA) asserts that the one year deferral window is "supported by the best available scientific evidence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015-12-21/fda-lifts-ban-on-blood-donations-from-gay-and-bisexual-men|title=Gay and Bisexual Men Can Soon Donate Blood – but There's a Catch|website=US News &amp; World Report|access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[LGBT]] organizations view the restrictions on donation as based on [[homophobia]] and not based on valid medical concern since donations are rigorously [[HIV test|tested]] to rule out donors that are infected with known viruses such as [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]], [[Human papillomavirus|HPV]], [[Hepatitis B]], and [[Hepatitis C]]. They state the deferrals are based on stereotypes.&lt;ref name="Schoettes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Blood Donations Questions|last=Schoettes|first=Scott|date=December 2012|newspaper=Adelante Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the lifetime restriction defend it because of the asserted risk of false negative test results&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeff-stier/blood-for-sale_b_52046.html |title=Blood for Sale |accessdate=5 April 2008 |last=Stier|first=Jeff |date=13 June 2007 |publisher=HuffingtonPost.com, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because the MSM population in developed countries tends to have a higher prevalence of HIV/AIDS infection.&lt;ref name="unaids2006"&gt;UNAIDS 2006 report on the global AIDS epidemic, [http://data.unaids.org/pub/GlobalReport/2006/2006_GR_CH05_en.pdf Chapter 05], June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The UK government advisory committee, SABTO, stated in 2013 that "the risk of transfusion of HIV infected blood would increase if MSM were allowed to donate blood".&lt;ref name="telegraph1aug2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8441054/Homosexual-men-allowed-to-give-blood-but-sex-banned-for-decade.html |title=Homosexual men allowed to give blood but sex banned for decade |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017 however, the UK government reduced the one year deferral window to three months, to take effect in the following months, resulting from SABTO's updated conclusions that "new testing systems were accurate and donors were good at complying with the rules". Furthermore, [[NHS Blood and Transplant]] are now investigating how possible it is for MSM, depending on degree of risk, to donate without even the three month deferral.&lt;ref name=bbcjul17&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-40669950 |title=Blood donation rules relaxed for gay men and sex workers |accessdate=28 August 2017 |date=23 July 2017 |publisher=BBC.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates for change to MSM prohibitions point out that screening of donors should focus on sexual behavior as well as [[safe sex]] practices since many MSM may always have protected sex, be [[monogamy|monogamous]], or be in other low risk categories.&lt;ref name=Schoettes/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph1aug2013" /&gt; Some groups in favor of lifting the restrictions support a waiting period after the blood is donated when the donor is considered to have had behavior considered higher risk, and before it is used, to match the blood bank's window of testing methods.&lt;ref name=Schoettes/&gt;  While HIV is reliably detected in 10 to 14 days with RNA testing, older testing methods provide accuracy for only up to 98% of positive cases after three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sfaf.org/hiv-info/testing/hiv-test-window-periods.html|title = HIV Test Window Periods|date = 2014|accessdate = 19 February 2015|website = San Francisco AIDS Foundation|publisher = San Francisco AIDS Foundation|last = |first =}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are massive amounts of residual fear about blood product contamination stemming from the contaminated blood scandals, which have caused thousands of deaths due to HIV and Hepatitis C in patients requiring a blood transfusion. Contaminated blood put [[hemophilia|haemophiliacs]] at massive risk and severe mortality, increasing the risk of common surgical procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-10-16|title=Contaminated haemophilia blood products|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Contaminated_haemophilia_blood_products&amp;oldid=805668781|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who contracted HIV from a contaminated blood transfusion include [[Isaac Asimov]], who received a blood transfusion following a cardiac surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-11-22|title=Isaac Asimov|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Isaac_Asimov&amp;oldid=811619239|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Men who have sex with men#HIV/AIDS}}
In many developed countries HIV is more prevalent among [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM) than among the general population.&lt;ref name="unaids2006"/&gt;

In the United States in 2005, MSM, [[African Americans]], and persons engaging in high-risk heterosexual behavior accounted for respectively 49%, 49%, and 32% of new HIV diagnoses.&lt;ref&gt;CDC [https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/statistics_2005_hiv_surveillance_report_vol_17.pdf HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report: HIV Infection and AIDS in the United States and Dependent Areas, 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 in the United States, African Americans accounted for 47.9% of new HIV diagnoses reported that year, but represented approximately only 12% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/america.htm|title=HIV and AIDS in America|publisher=avert.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian Red Cross Blood Service]] pushed to have the deferral period lowered from twelve to six months however it was rejected by the [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]] (TGA). The Red Cross will re-submit their application to reduce the deferral period to six months in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/vd8zd3/why-cant-gay-men-donate-blood-in-australia|title=Why Can't Gay Men Donate Blood in Australia?|website=VICE|access-date=28 August 2017|date=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
Italy, Latvia, Poland, Russia and Spain are the only European countries that don't have deferral policies for men who have sex with men. The donation is allowed if the donor hasn't had a risky sexual encounter, but not depending on the sexual orientation of the donor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.donarsangre.org/donantes-de-sangre/|title=Donantes de sangre - Centro de Donación de Sangre de Cruz Roja|publisher=[[Cruz Roja Española]]|language=Spanish|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="El Mundo 2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/salud/2015/04/29/5540e08bca47415e108b4579.html|title=España no discrimina a los donantes por su orientación sexual|date=29 April 2015|work=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|language=Spanish|accessdate=6 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The UK since November 2017 has implemented a 3 month deferral policy on all gay/bi men who want to donate their blood, the lowest in the western world. However this does not apply to Northern Ireland, which still has a 12 month deferral period in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.blood.co.uk/news-and-campaigns/news-and-statements/blood-donation-rules-have-changed/|title=Blood donation rules have changed|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SaBTO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_129796 |title=Donor selection criteria review |accessdate=8 September 2011 |publisher=[[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] and SaBTO, Blood Donor Selection Steering Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Waygood |first=James |url=http://sosogay.org/2011/government-announces-end-of-lifetime-ban-on-gay-blood-donation/ |title=UK Government lifts lifetime ban on gay blood donation |work=So So Gay |date=8 September 2011 |accessdate=20 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512193654/http://sosogay.org/2011/government-announces-end-of-lifetime-ban-on-gay-blood-donation/ |archive-date=12 May 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs recommended the policy change after a study concluded that a total ban may breach equality legislation and that the risk of HIV reaching the blood supply would only increase by approximately 2%.&lt;ref name = ukbanlift&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8441054/Homosexual-men-allowed-to-give-blood-but-sex-banned-for-decade.html |title=Homosexual men allowed to give blood but sex banned for decade |work=The Daily Telegraph|date= |accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ireland, [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM) may donate blood if they have not engaged in oral or anal sex with another man at least 12 months prior to a donation. This policy came into effect from 16 January 2017. On 27 July 2015, Tomás Heneghan, a 23-year-old University of Limerick student and journalist from Galway began a legal challenge in the High Court against the permanent deferral imposed on MSM donors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/gay-blood-ban-tomas-heneghan-2240158-Jul2015/|title=This 23-year-old student is challenging Ireland's gay blood donation ban|first=Catherine|last=Healy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/courts/high-court/gay-man-brings-legal-challenge-over-blood-donation-ban-1.2298825|title=Gay man brings legal challenge over blood donation ban|work=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the questionnaire and interview process used by the IBTS does not adequately assess the risk of disease transmission posed by his donation. He claims this is in breach of EU law. He said that both failed to consider the length of time between a donor's last sexual experience and the end of a "window period" in which infections are sometimes not detected. Heneghan's previous sexual activity posed no risk of infection, according to HSE-approved advice and he said the service had no evidence upon which it could legitimately impose a life-long ban on him donating blood. Following several adjournments of the case to allow the blood service and Department of Health to examine and develop the donation policies, in late June 2016 the Irish Blood Transfusion Service recommended that the lifetime ban on MSM be reduced to a 12 month ban. Later that week the Minister for Health Simon Harris agreed to the recommendations and announced the reduction would take place. However no timeline was reported for the implementation of the new policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2016/0623/797739-blood-donation/|title=IBTS votes to end ban on gay men donating blood|website=RTE.ie|access-date=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 July 2016, Tomás Heneghan dropped his High Court challenge against the service as an end to the lifetime deferral on MSM blood donors had been announced in the interim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/gay-man-drops-challenge-to-blood-donation-ban-after-change-in-policy-announced-by-health-minister-34913345.html|title=Gay man drops challenge to blood donation ban after change in policy announced by Health Minister - Independent.ie|access-date=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heneghan then wrote about his experiences of challenging the ban in a number of national media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/toms-heneghan-on-his-high-court-case-why-was-i-shaming-the-family-why-was-my-sex-life-being-opened-up-to-public-scrutiny-34917487.html|title=Tomás Heneghan on his High Court case: Why was I shaming the family?

However he also criticised the new 12 month deferral policy on MSM and called on Ireland's Health Minister to initiate a review of the IBTS and replace the 12 month deferral period for MSM with no deferral or a 3 month deferral on all donors following sexual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;http://theoutmost.com/news/irish-lifetime-ban-blood-donation-lifted-gay-men/?platform=hootsuite&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/blood-transfusion-service-finally-lifts-ban-on-gay-men-donating-blood-439426.html|title=Blood Transfusion Service finally lifts ban on gay men donating blood|date=17 January 2017|work=Irish Examiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/gay-donor-tooth-and-nail-battle-to-give-blood-at-an-end-1.2939185|title=Gay donor: 'Tooth and nail' battle to give blood at an end|work=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.limerickleader.ie/news/home/231273/i-abstained-from-sex-for-23-months-gay-ul-student-wins-fight-over-blood-donations.html|title='I abstained from sex for 23 months': Gay UL student wins fight over blood donations|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar policy exists in the rest of the European Union and is the prevailing interpretation of the European Union Directive 2004/33/EC article 2.1 on donor deferrals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iospress.metapress.com/content/c1r9rx5fc499m1rm/fulltext.pdf |title=Commission Directive 2004/33/EC of 22 March 2004 |publisher=Iospress.metapress.com |accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy, however, is not very specific and refers to "high risk sexual contact."  The UK interprets the directive to include all forms of homosexual sex as falling within 2.2.2 of Annex III to the directive "Persons whose behaviour or activity places them at risk of acquiring  infectious diseases that may be transmitted by blood", requiring a deferral based on the window period for the diseases involved, and sets this at 12 months, despite the Annex suggesting 6 months for risk of exposure to Hepatitis B. Hélder Trindade, President of the Portuguese Institute of Blood and Transplantation (IPST), stated in 2015 that sexually abstinent homosexuals may give blood, but that MSM is definitely seen as a risk factor.&lt;ref name=tvi24-29April2015a&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvi24.iol.pt/sociedade/doar/homossexuais-so-podem-dar-sangue-em-abstinencia-sexual |title=Homosexuals may give blood if they abstain from sex (Homossexuais só podem dar sangue em abstinência sexual)|publisher=tvi24|language=Portuguese|date=29 April 2015|accessdate=5 November 2015|quote=The President of the Institute of Blood explains that "sexual contact by men with other men is definitely (seen) as a risk factor" (Presidente do Instituto do Sangue explica que "contacto sexual de homens com outros homens é definido como fator de risco")}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Finland, the parliamentary ombudsman launched an investigation on the possible unconstitutionality of the lifetime ban in January 2006. In June 2008, it was concluded that the ban was not unlawful in Finland as it is based on "appropriately reasoned epidemiological information" and because it is related to sexual behaviour rather than sexual orientation. The ombudsman added that people over the age of 65 and people who lived in Britain during the [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (mad cow disease) outbreak are also screened out during blood donor interviews. In December 2013, the Finnish Red Cross blood service announced it was lifting the ban and introducing a one-year deferral instead.

Since 10 July 2016, France implemented a 1-year deferral period policy on all gay and bisexual men donating blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/05/world/europe/france-gay-blood-donation.html|title=France to Lift Ban on Gay Men Donating Blood |work=The New York Times |date=4 November 2015 |accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
Since 2009, the [[New Zealand Blood Service]] (NZBS) had deferred males who have had oral or anal intercourse, with or without protection, with another male for five years. From the formation of the NZBS in 1998 to 2009, the deferral period had been ten years, but reduced to five years following an independent review of blood donation criteria in 2007-8 which found no significant difference in risk to the blood supply for deferral periods of five years compared to ten years.&lt;ref name="NZBS-criteriareview"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nzblood.co.nz/content/download/218/1386/file/NZBS%20Behavioural%20Donor%20Deferral%20Criteria%20Review%20%20Final%20Report%20April%202008.pdf |title= Behavioural Donor Deferral Criteria Review - Final Report to the New Zealand Blood Service |date= April 2008 |accessdate= 20 July 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121029210122/http://www.nzblood.co.nz/content/download/218/1386/file/NZBS%20Behavioural%20Donor%20Deferral%20Criteria%20Review%20%20Final%20Report%20April%202008.pdf |archive-date= 29 October 2012 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the NZBS dropped the ban period from 5 years to one year following the recommendation of [[Medsafe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gaynz.com/articles/publish/2/article_16184.php |title= New one year blood ban now in place |date= 15 December 2014 |accessdate= 1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their decision was mainly caused by recently gained facts about HIV transmission in Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sdgln.com/health/2014/12/15/new-zealand-new-1-year-blood-ban-now-place#sthash.7HLfyPIC.dpbs |date= 15 December 2014 |accessdate= 1 February 2015|title=New Zealand: New one-year blood ban now in place|publisher=San Diego Gay and Lesbian News}}&lt;/ref&gt; which already had a one-year deferral. The new 1 year deferral has been in effect since 15 December 2014.

The one year deferral period for MSM is on par with the one year deferral period for persons engaging in prostitution outside of New Zealand and people who have resided in a country which has a high (1% or more) HIV prevalence. Females who engage in sexual intercourse with a male who has had sex with another male are also deferred for twelve months.&lt;ref name="NZBS-safeblood"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nzblood.co.nz/Give-blood/Donating/Detailed-eligibility-criteria |title= Detailed Eligibility Criteria |publisher= New Zealand Blood Service |accessdate= 21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the US, the current guidance from the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) is to defer any male donor who has had sex with another man (MSM) in the past year.

Female sexual partners of MSM are deferred for one year since the last exposure. This is the same policy used for any sexual partner of someone in a high risk group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/oashi/aids/1992policy.html 1992 Recommendations for the prevention of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Transmission by Blood and Blood Products] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629190236/http://www.fda.gov/oashi/aids/1992policy.html |date=29 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument used to follow these policies is that blood should be collected from a population that is at low risk for disease, since the tests are not perfect and human error may lead to infected units not being properly discarded, and these population groups would be considered a high risk. The policy was first put in place in 1983 by the FDA, which regulates blood donations to profit and non-profit organizations.&lt;ref name="FDA"&gt;{{cite web | title=Blood Donations from Men Who Have Sex with Other Men Questions and Answers (published: August 19th, 2013) |publisher=FDA.gov |url=http://www.fda.gov/biologicsbloodvaccines/bloodbloodproducts/questionsaboutblood/ucm108186.htm | accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History of calls to change the policy====

* In 2006, the [[AABB]], [[American Red Cross]], and [[America's Blood Centers]] all supported a change from the current US policy of a lifetime deferral of MSM to one year since most recent contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/06/transcripts/2006-4206t1.pdf |format=133MB |title=Meeting of Blood Products Advisory Committee |date=9 March 2006 |publisher=Food and Drug Administration |page=66 |accessdate=25 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; One model suggested that this change would result in one additional case of HIV transmitted by transfusion every 32.8 years. The AABB has suggested making this change since 1997. The FDA did not accept the proposal and had concerns about the data used to produce the model, citing that additional risk to recipients was not justified.
* On 19 August 2009, the Assembly Judiciary Committee in California passed AJR13, the U.S. Blood Donor Nondiscrimination Resolution, calling upon the FDA to end the MSM blood ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.californiaprogressreport.com/site/?q=node/252 |title=Ending the Federal Ban on Gay Blood Donations |publisher=California Progress Report |date=19 August 2009 |accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In April 2010, the [[New York City Council]] passed a resolution calling on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to eliminate the ban stating "This ban was based on prejudice, a knee-jerk reaction, and misunderstandings about the HIV/AIDS disease. Given the constant need for blood, it does not make common sense to prohibit donations from an entire population."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.council.nyc.gov/d7/html/members/pdf/community_report_04.30.2010.pdf |title=Legislative and Community Report |date=30 April 2010 |publisher=[[New York City Council]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |page=2 |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5y5nQs7v6?url=http://www.council.nyc.gov/d7/html/members/pdf/community_report_04.30.2010.pdf |archivedate=20 April 2011 |accessdate=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 1 June 2010, the [[Council of the District of Columbia]] passed a resolution calling on the FDA to "reverse the lifetime deferment of blood donations by men who have had sex with men since 1977 in favor of a policy that protects the safety and integrity of the blood supply that is based on an up-to-date scientific criteria."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dcregs.dc.gov/Notice/DownLoad.aspx?NoticeID=400045 |title=A Resolution 18-486 : In the Council of the District of Columbia |date=1 June 2010 |publisher=Dcregs.dc.gov |accessdate=28 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029202852/http://www.dcregs.dc.gov/Notice/DownLoad.aspx?NoticeID=400045 |archive-date=29 October 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In June 2013, the American Medical Association issued a statement calling on the FDA to change the policy, stating that "The lifetime ban on blood donation for men who have sex with men is discriminatory and not based on sound science."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/news/news/2013/2013-06-18-new-ama-policies-annual-meeting.page |title=AMA Adopts New Policies on Second Day of Voting at Annual Meeting |author=no author listed |work=ama-assn.org |publisher=[[American Medical Association]] |date=18 June 2013|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mohney"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/american-medical-association-opposes-fda-ban-gay-men/story?id=19436366 |title=FDA Ban on Gay Men as Blood Donors Opposed by American Medical Association |publisher=ABC News |last=Mohney|first=Gillian|date=20 June 2013 |accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In July 2013, the [[American Osteopathic Association]] approved a policy calling on the FDA to "end the indefinite deferment period for Men who have sex with Men (MSM)", and to "modify the exclusion criteria for MSM to be consistent with deferrals for those judged to be at an increased risk of infection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/news-and-publications/media-center/2013-news-releases/Pages/HOD-2013-increase-number-of-eligible-blood-donors.aspx |title=American Osteopathic Association Calls for Removing FDA's Blood Donor Ban |publisher=Osteopathic.org |date=20 July 2013 |accessdate=1 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821193753/http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/news-and-publications/media-center/2013-news-releases/Pages/HOD-2013-increase-number-of-eligible-blood-donors.aspx |archive-date=21 August 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 14 December 2015, Jordan Moll-Vigrass, Congressmen [[Brian Higgins]] and the [http://www.pridecenterwny.org/ Pride Center of Western New York] held a community rally in [[Buffalo, New York]] to rally against the [[Food and Drug Administration]] policy that bans blood donations by gay and bisexual men. Moll-Vigrass, who is openly gay and had been in a committed relationship for four years, was refused as a blood donor after disclosing his sexual orientation during the questionnaire screening process. Outraged by the federal policy and disappointed by being refused as a blood donor, Moll-Vigrass started to advocate for change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wkbw.com/news/gay-man-fighting-for-right-to-give-blood|title=Gay man fighting for right to give blood|last=Pasceri|first=Joanna|date=December 2015|publisher=[[WKBW-TV|WKBW]]|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The government’s unfounded policy is hurtful to the people being turned away solely based on sexual orientation and the millions of others who will be in need of a lifesaving blood donation," said Higgins.

*On 27 May 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved of a new blood donor history questionnaire for general use by blood establishments, which is compatible with the deferral for 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aabb.org/tm/questionnaires/Pages/dhqaabb.aspx|title=Blood Donor History Questionnaires|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this update, the approved questionnaires were compatible only with an indefinite deferral of blood donations from MSM.
*As of December 2016, the [[American Red Cross]] reports that MSM may be eligible to donate blood if they did not have sex with another man in more than 12 months.  The American Red Cross reports that, in January 2017, the organization began donor reinstatement of MSM who were previously deferred from donating, and who later became qualified to donate blood in accordance with the new donation deferral period of 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redcrossblood.org/donating-blood/eligibility-requirements/eligibility-criteria-topic|title=Eligibility Criteria by Topic|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Red Cross website specifies that this 12-month deferral does also apply to [[transgender men]] who have sex with men, but does not apply to [[transgender women]] who have sex with men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redcrossblood.org/donating-blood/lgbtq-donors|title=LGBTQ+ Donors|publisher=American Red Cross|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasoning for the restrictions==
Blood services first and foremost must ensure that all blood received for donation is safe for transfusion purposes. This is achieved by screening potential donors for high risk behaviors through questionnaires and interviews before blood is taken, and subsequent laboratory testing on samples of donated blood.

Blood services commonly justify their bans against MSM using the statistically higher prevalence of HIV and hepatitis of MSM in population studies.

In the earliest years of the AIDS epidemic, there were no reliable tests for the virus, which justified blanket bans on blood donations from groups at high risk of acquiring or having HIV, including MSM. These restrictions are similar to present-day restrictions in most countries on people residing in the United Kingdom during the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]] ("mad cow disease") epidemic of the 1980s and early-to-mid 1990s, due to the absence of a test for its human form, [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease|variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]] (vCJD).

In 1985, early tests using the [[ELISA]] method looked for antibodies, which are the immune system's response to the virus. However, there is a [[window period]] when using this method in which a person who has been infected with HIV is able to spread the disease but may test negative for the virus. This window period can be as long as three to six months,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfaf.org/aids101/hiv_testing.html#window |title=San Francisco AIDS Foundation: HIV Testing |publisher=Sfaf.org |date= |accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an average of 22 days.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2002/ANS01140.html FDA Approves First Nucleic Acid Test (Nat) System To Screen Whole Blood Donors For Infections With Human Immunodeficiency Virus (Hiv) And Hepatitis C Virus (Hcv)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221174758/http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2002/ANS01140.html |date=21 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tests using the ELISA methods are often still used in developed countries because they are highly [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]]. In developing countries, these tests are often the only method used to screen donated blood for HIV. To cover the window period resultant from the use of these tests, donors are also screened for high risk behaviors, one of which is a history of same-sex sexual activity among male potential donors. Other groups with similar restrictions include commercial sex workers, injecting drug users, and people resident in countries with a high HIV prevalence (such as sub-Saharan Africa). Newer tests look for the virus itself, such as the [[p24 antigen]] test, which looks for a part on the surface of the virus, and [[Nucleic acid tests]] (NAT), which look for the genetic material of the virus. With these tests, the window period is shorter, with an average duration of 12 days.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  Fourth generation combination HIV tests are conclusive at 3 months, and Hepatitis B tests are conclusive at 6 months.

Risks are also associated with a non-MSM donors testing positive for HIV, which can have major implications as the donor's last donation could have been given within the window period for testing and could have entered the blood supply, potentially infecting blood product recipients. An incident in 2003 in New Zealand saw a non-MSM donor testing positive for HIV and subsequently all blood products made with the donor's last blood donation had to be recalled. This included NZ$4 million worth of [[Factor VIII]], a blood clotting factor used to treat haemophiliacs which is manufactured from large pools of donated plasma, and subsequently led to a nationwide shortage of Factor VIII and the deferral of non-emergency surgery on haemophiliac patients, costing the health sector millions of dollars more.&lt;ref name="NZBS-criteriareview" /&gt; Screening out those at high risk of bloodborne diseases, including MSM, reduces the potential frequency and impact of such incidents.

==Criticism of the restrictions==
Objections to the restrictions, including those from the American Medical Association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/about-ama/our-people/member-groups-sections/glbt-advisory-committee/ama-policy-regarding-sexual-orientation.page|title=Policies on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender &amp; Queer (LGBTQ) Issues - AMA|website=www.ama-assn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the American Red Cross, are generally based on the idea that improvements in testing and other safeguards have reduced the risk from transfusion transmitted HIV to an acceptable level. Blood shortages are common, and advocates for change to the policies point out that excluding healthy donors only makes the problem worse. "Ideal" inventories are at least a three-day supply, but many blood centers struggle to meet this demand.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Further advocating for change stems from the fact that the ban is a blanket ban encompassing all men who have had sex with another man, even with protection and even if the HIV status of these men's partners is shown beyond doubt to be negative. Advocates for change point out that a promiscuous straight male is a higher-risk donor than a gay or bisexual man in a monogamous relationship, but the former will usually be allowed to donate blood. Furthermore, other high-risk activities such as having sexual contact with anyone who has used needles to take drugs not prescribed by their doctor have a set deferral period before the donor is allowed to donate blood, whereas in some countries MSM donors are deferred indefinitely. Female donors who have sexual contact with MSM are sometimes deferred temporarily.{{fact|date=September 2017}}

Following [[2016 Orlando nightclub shooting|a mass shooting targeting a gay nightclub]] in June 2016, there were reported expressions of frustration and disapproval by a number of gay and bisexual men who were forbidden to donate blood to victims, with LGBT activists across the country and a group of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] lawmakers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Barron-Lopez |first=Laura |date=13 June 2016 |title=Democrats Call On FDA To End Ban On Blood Donations From Gay Men |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-blood-donations-gay_us_575ed49ce4b0ced23ca8b4b3 |work=The Huffington Post |access-date=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; urging the ban to be lifted.

'''Musgum mud huts''' or '''Musgum dwelling units''' are traditional domestic structures built of mud by the ethnic [[Musgum people]] in the Maga sub-division, Mayo-Danay division, [[Far North Province]] in [[Cameroon]]. (Musgum also is spelled as Moosgoum.)&lt;ref name="Noble2007"&gt;{{cite book|first=Allen G. |last=Noble|title=Traditional Buildings: A Global Survey of Structural Forms and Cultural Functions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pMjHpEyDqJMC&amp;pg=PA85|accessdate=7 February 2013|date=15 September 2007|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-84511-305-6|pages=85–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dwellings were built in a variety of shapes, such as tall domed or conical dwellings or huts, some with a reverse-V shape, and others with geometric designs. 

Musgums are an example of "[[earth architecture]]". Of simple design, they are constructed of mud, thatch, and water by local residents using few tools. Resembling the shape of beehives or shells, they are also known as "cases obus".&lt;ref name=Archi&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.designboom.com/architecture/musgum-earth-architecture/|title= Musgum dwelling unit|accessdate=15 February 2013|publisher= Designboom.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are [[adobe]] structures,&lt;ref name=Quiz&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://quizlet.com/7106844/history-of-architecture-to-1850-flash-cards/|title=History of Architecture to 1850|accessdate=15 February 2013|publisher=Quizlet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a variant of [[Cob (material)|cob]], and are in the [[catenary arch]] form, which can bear maximum weight with the minimum use of building materials.&lt;ref name=Natural&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://naturalhomes.org/shellhomes.htm#musgumshells|title=Homes inspired by shells and other natural forms..|accessdate=15 February 2013|publisher=Natural Homes Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dwellings also are  described as "beehive type" because of their dome shape. They are considered to be an important architectural style of Cameroon, although not in fashion in the present day.&lt;ref name="DeLanceyMbuh2010"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Mark Dike |last1=DeLancey|first2=Rebecca |last2=Mbuh|first3=Mark W. |last3=Delancey|title=Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Cameroon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4l9lSZ9d46cC&amp;pg=PA41|accessdate=7 February 2013|date=3 May 2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7399-5|pages=41–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The houses were built with earth, following a traditional practice before the advent of [[cement]]. These structures are no longer popular, however, as they are considered to be outdated. Very few Musgums build them now.&lt;ref name=Archi/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gardi1974"&gt;{{cite book|first=René |last=Gardi|title=Indigenous African Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tKvfAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=7 February 2013|year=1974|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Incorporated|isbn=978-0-442-22574-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
The Musgum people in Cameroon constructed their mud houses with compressed sun-dried mud. Earth is still used as a building material and appears environmentally more acceptable for low cost housing, as cement production releases large amounts of [[carbon dioxide|carbon emissions]]. Mud is laid over a thatch of lashed reeds. They are compared to adobe structures or variants of cob structures, which are made from sand, clay, water, and some kind of fibrous or organic material such as sticks, straw, and/or manure. Although of simple design, they are well planned from a utility viewpoint.&lt;ref name=Archi/&gt; The houses were built with geometric designs. They were built in the shape of a shell in inverted-“V’ or conical form. [[Ronald Rael]], an architect and author of the book entitled, “Earth Architecture”, has observed that the Musgum houses are of "a [[catenary]] arch—the ideal mathematical form," which can withstand the load of the building with minimum use of material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eartharchitecture.org/index.php?/archives/1070-Musgum-Architecture.html|title=One half of the World’s Population, approximately 3 billion people on six Continents lives or works in buildings constructed of earth|accessdate=15 February 2013|publisher=Earth Architecture organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the inverted form of an arc of a chain, the domes are slim and work on the principle of compression providing rigidity to the structure without any twisting or bending moments. The geometric patterns on the exterior face of the domes provide a foothold for workers who stand on them during construction and also during subsequent maintenance.&lt;ref name=Archi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Natural/&gt; The exterior design and large height of the structures (nearly {{convert|9|m|abbr=on}}) keeps the houses cool inside on hot summer days. 

A small circular opening at the top of the huts also helps with air circulation and is used as an escape hatch if subjected to flooding.&lt;ref name=Archi/&gt;&lt;ref name="Country Life"&gt;{{cite book|title=Country Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8DtOAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=17 February 2013|year=1922|page=397}}&lt;/ref&gt; This circular opening, a few inches in diameter, also known as a "smoke hole", is closed with a slab or a pot during the rains to prevent water entering the house. Entrance is provided by a single door, which is narrow up to knee level, but widens at shoulder level, and is said to resemble a keyhole.&lt;ref name="Noble2007"/&gt;

Musgums form part of a complex of housing units, granaries, and a central courtyard enclosed within a thatched compound wall. The walls are connected to provide access. The exterior surfaces are grooved so that rain water can drain easily. The complex also is protected with fencing.&lt;ref name=Quiz/&gt; Space is provided for expansion of the dwelling units for each new wife or daughter-in-law or, for additions to the family.&lt;ref name="Wilkes1990"&gt;{{cite book|first=Joseph A.|last= Wilkes|title=Encyclopedia of architecture: design, engineering &amp; construction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MnHzAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=7 February 2013|year=1990|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-471-63243-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ClarkPause2012"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Roger H. |last1=Clark|first2=Michael |last2=Pause|title=Precedents in Architecture: Analytic Diagrams, Formative Ideas, and Partis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6vcLZcSIE_kC&amp;pg=PT2140|accessdate=7 February 2013|date=15 February 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-17084-7|pages=2140–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique adopted during construction is called the [[mud coil]] pottery technique. In this method, the mud layers are placed spirally with each lift of about 0.5 m. Each lift is allowed to dry before the next one is added. The walls are thicker at the base, gradually thinning out toward the top, thereby contributing to the structure's stability.&lt;ref name="Noble2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Archi/&gt; The relief lines are created as the construction proceeds upward in the "V" shape or with straight line grooves to facilitate quick and easy draining of water when it rains.&lt;ref name="DeLanceyMbuh2010"/&gt;

A '''naked butler '''is a popular type of entertainment used at [[Bachelorette party|hen parties]] and for corporate entertainment. It was introduced into the UK in the early 2000s and is now popular across the USA, New Zealand, Australia and Canada.

==Attire==

===Naked butler===
[[File:Naked butlers with a hen party, Bristol 2013.jpg|320px|thumbnail|right|Naked butlers serving guests at a hen party]]
The standard attire for a naked butler is only an [[apron]] or [[Trunks (clothing)|trunks]], [[cuff]]s, [[detachable collar]] and [[bow tie]]. It is seen as a more conservative entertainment option to hiring a [[male stripper]] for a [[Bachelorette party]] as it can be suitable for a broader range of guests.

===Topless waiter===

In this case the apron will be replaced with smart black trousers. This option may be more commonly used during corporate entertainment where the attire needs to be smarter and the exposing of a butlers naked bottom is not appropriate.

==In popular culture==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:A naked butler on X factor, July 2011.jpg|thumb|223x223px]] --&gt;
Naked butlers have become a popular [[gimmick]] on television shows in the UK and this is demonstrated by appearances on TV shows including ''[[Deal or No Deal]]'', ''[[Come Dine with Me]]'' and ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|the X Factor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/1806642/x-factor-half-naked-butlers-endless-booze-and-hot-tub-romps-what-really-happened-at-the-x-factor-contestants-party/|title=Boozy wannabes have X-rated romp in boot camp hot tub as  Simon warns some have blown their chances|date=2016-09-18|work=The Sun|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2005, the role and job of a naked butler was discussed in the documentary ''Going to work Naked'' on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]].&lt;ref&gt;Star 7th February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, naked butlers were part of an international news feature after being hired by a retirement home as part of the resident's wish program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/16988603.milton-lodges-hunks-in-trunks-visit-goes-international/|title=Care home's Hunks in Trunks visit goes international|website=Gazette|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nasozai'''  ({{lang-ps|نسوزئ}}) are a [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] tribe.  They are largely literate. Nasozai is the second largest and most important ''[[mohallah]]'' of the village of [[Nartopa]] in [[Attock District]], [[Punjab, Pakistan]], naming that part of the village after their tribe. The people of Nasozai migrated from [[Afghanistan]] (Nasozai) to [[Chhachh]], [[Attock District]] in 1723. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Along with [[Burmese Indian]]s, they were part of the large South Asian community in the country. Significant Muslim migration occurred to Burma during the [[British Raj]] period. Most of these migrants were [[Bengali people|Bengalis]] of erstwhile [[East Pakistan]] but there were also significant communities of [[Urdu language|Urdu]]-speakers, [[Memons]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/world/asia/pakistan/khausa-a-tale-of-two-cities---yangon-and-karachi-1.1541422747664|title=Khausa: A tale of two cities - Yangon and Karachi|first=Falah|last=Gulzar|work=Gulf News|date=20 November 2018|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Punjabi people|Punjabis]] and [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]].

==History==
Large-scale [[Muslim]] immigration from the [[South Asia]] to Burma began in the 1870s, when Burma, like modern-day Pakistan, was also under the [[British Raj]].&lt;ref name="Yegar"/&gt; Many of these Muslims came from areas that were to become Pakistan, and settled in various parts of Burma, including the western regions which were predominantly populated by local [[Islam in Burma|Burmese Muslims]]. Following Burma's independence in 1948, the status of Muslims from the South Asia living in Burma was profoundly affected; they could no longer display links with their places of origin and were given the option of either applying for [[Burmese citizenship]], be considered foreigners, or become stateless. At that time, various Muslim associations in the area together united to form the "[[All Burma Pakistan Association]]" (ABPA) – a federation which came to be known as representing the "largest South Asian Muslim ethnic group in Burma."&lt;ref name="Yegar"/&gt; The number of Pakistanis in Burma was estimated by the leaders of the ABPA to be between 300,000 and 500,000 people; however, the accuracy of this figure could never possibly be determined given the lack of official and reliable statistics.&lt;ref name="Yegar"/&gt;

According to Moše Yegar, author of ''Between Integration and Secession'', most of the Pakistanis belonged to modest, working-class socioeconomic backgrounds..

Many of the Pakistanis failed to opt for Burmese citizenship either because of "ignorance or a lack of information"; however, among them were some who intentionally managed to retain their [[Pakistani citizenship]]. Then, there were others who lost their Pakistani citizenship while at the same time failing to take up Burmese citizenship.&lt;ref name="Yegar"/&gt; It became one of the objectives of the ABPA to lobby Burmese authorities and the local [[List of diplomatic missions of Pakistan|Pakistani embassy]] to assist in facilitating the [[naturalization]] of those Pakistanis who sought Burmese citizenship, as well as facilitating those who wanted to acquire [[Pakistani passport]]s.&lt;ref name="Yegar"/&gt;

==Community==
Pakistanis in Burma remained equally loyal to Burma and Pakistan, identifying themselves with the national aspirations of both countries, and were an important link in promoting bilateral relations between the two countries.&lt;ref name="Yegar2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yegar|first=Moshe|title=The Muslims of Burma|year=1972|publisher=O. Harrassowitz|isbn=978-3447013574|pages=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; They identified as [[Muslim]]s in terms of religious affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Thomas Duval|title=Area handbook for Burma|year=1968|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|location=American University (Washington, D.C.). Foreign Area Studies|pages=141, 143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with [[Burmese Indians]], they were part of the large South Asian community in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=United States. Dept. of State|title=Background Notes|year=1971|publisher=Dept. of State, Bureau of Public Affairs, Office of Media Services|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robert R. Nathan Associates|title=Comprehensive report: economic and engineering development of Burma, Volume 1|year=1953|publisher=Knappen, Tippetts, Abbett, McCarthy Engineers|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The All Burma Pakistan Association served as the exclusive association for all Pakistanis in Burma. The ABPA maintained strong relations with the [[Government of Pakistan]]. Whenever high-profile Pakistani personalities visited Burma, they would be personally received as guests by the APBA.&lt;ref name="Yegar2"/&gt;

In the [[2014 Myanmar Census]], Pakistani residents were categorised into the "Other" ethnic category, along with [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MYO ZAW LINN|title=Burma to count Thailand refugees in 2014 census|url=http://www.dvb.no/news/burma-to-count-thailand-refugees-in-2014-census/34045|accessdate=14 November 2015|newspaper=DVB|date=31 October 2013|quote=But last month, Immigration Minister Khin Yi insisted that the Rohingya, described as “Bengalis” in Burma, will be counted under the “other” category on the census along with ethnic Chinese and Pakistani residents.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exodus== 
In the years that followed independence, Pakistanis in Burma enjoyed the same lifestyles as other immigrants settled in Burma. In fact, Pakistanis were granted special privileges by the [[Government of Burma]] whereby they were given complete freedom to observe and celebrate their national and cultural events, such as raising the [[flag of Pakistan]] on occasions like [[Pakistan Day]].&lt;ref name="Yegar2"/&gt; Similar privileges were enjoyed by the [[Burmese Chinese|Chinese]] and Hindu communities.&lt;ref name="Yegar2"/&gt; Even the [[Rohingya conflict in Western Burma]], led by local Muslim separatists who aspired a unification with neighboring [[East Pakistan]], posed no political effects whatsoever upon the lives of the Pakistanis in Burma despite the momentary diplomatic scuffle that was meanwhile following between the governments of Pakistan and Burma over the conflict.&lt;ref name="Yegar2"/&gt;

However, following the [[1962 Burmese coup d'état]] by General [[Ne Win]] and a nationwide nationalization program, living conditions suddenly became difficult for all immigrants. The 1962 coup led to a swift exodus of South Asians from Burma, and many Muslims began returning to India and Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Yegar"/&gt; With the growing popularity of the Burmese National Movement post-[[World War II]], opposition against the presence of South Asian and Muslim immigrants had begun to grow in Burma. South Asian Muslims were losing their prospects of being equal citizens and were beginning to discover themselves as a foreign minority in independent Burma. The changing hostile atmosphere triggered a mass exodus of South Asians and the Pakistani community significantly declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Richard|title=A short introduction to the history and politics of Southeast Asia|year=1970|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Far Eastern Economic Review, Volume 45|year=1964|publisher=Far Eastern Economic Review Limited|pages=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those Muslims of Pakistani origin who chose to remain were confronted by an increasingly nationalist Burmese movement and were forced to quietly assimilate into Burmese society rather than being able to freely emphasize a separate ethnic identity.&lt;ref name="Yegar"/&gt;

The '''penose''' is the organized criminal underbelly in [[Amsterdam]] and other major cities in the [[Netherlands]]. Penose usually means the organisations formed by criminals of Dutch descent. It is a slang word coming from the old Amsterdam Bargoens language.

==Origin of the word==
Organized crime in the Netherlands goes back to the 18th century when organized groups of [[thieves]], [[pimps]] and shady travelling salesmen created a [[cant (language)|cant]] language named [[Bargoens]] to communicate with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voorbeginners.info/bargoens/ |title=Bargoens voor beginners |publisher=Voorbeginners.info |date= |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Out of the language there arose a couple of new words which would become part of the Dutch folklore. Until this day the word ''Penose'' (which arose from Bargoens) is still used by some people to describe the Dutch underworld in which the organized crime bosses thrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waterloopleinmarkt.nl/woordenlijst.html |title=Woordenlijst-Waterloopleinmarkt |publisher=Waterloopleinmarkt.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is mostly used in [[Amsterdam]], but has also spread to other big cities in the Netherlands such as [[Den Haag]], [[Rotterdam]] or [[Eindhoven]].

==Organized crime in the Netherlands==
The Netherlands is the biggest exporter of [[ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]] in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expatica.com/nl/news/local_news/the-ecstasy-capital-of-the-world-36_44150.html |title=The ecstasy capital of the world &lt; Dutch news &amp;#124; Expatica The Netherlands |publisher=Expatica.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Dutch gangs are a major exporter of [[cocaine]], [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and a smaller exporter of [[heroin]]. In the drugs business they closely cooperate with [[British firms (organized crime)|British firms]] and [[Colombian cartels]] for the importation and exportation of ecstasy and cocaine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ateno.nl/doc/Article%20Cocaine%20Trade%20kl%20Crime%20Law%20%20Social%20Change.pdf |title=Dutch Cocaine Trade : The perspective of Rotterdam cocaine retail dealers |publisher=Ateno.nl |accessdate=2013-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029190024/http://www.ateno.nl/doc/Article%20Cocaine%20Trade%20kl%20Crime%20Law%20%20Social%20Change.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while they cooperate with [[Agriculture in Morocco|Moroccan drug barons]] in the [[Rif]]fian areas and with [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] drug lords based in [[Crime in Pakistan|Pakistan]] for the importation of [[hashish]].

While the term ''Penose'' was and still is used to describe the ethnic [[Dutch people|Dutch]] crime lords, it has been used in a broader context.

==Criminal groups concerning the ''Penose''==
The ''penose'' concerns organized criminal groups with ties to the country of the [[Netherlands]] itself. Due to immigration there are strong [[Turkish people|Turkish]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Yugoslav people|Yugoslav]], [[Russian people|Russian]], [[Albanian people|Albanian]] and [[Italian people|Italian]] communities in the Netherlands. Criminal outfits such as the [[Turkish mafia]], [[Triad (underground society)|Triads]], [[Serbian mafia]], [[Russian mafia]], [[Albanian mafia]], and the [['Ndrangheta]] are not regarded as a part of the traditional ''Penose'', although they're an active part of the Dutch criminal underworld nonetheless. The reason why Surinamese, Antillean, Moroccan and Ambonese groups are considered to be a part of the ''Penose'' is because their criminal groups were formed and based in the Netherlands, whereas the Turkish or Serb gangs are part of a criminal group based in their home country.

===Dutch crime groups===

Indigenous organized crime based in some of The Netherlands' major cities, mainly [[Amsterdam]] and [[The Hague]], mostly has origins in the traditional working-class quarters. These small groups mainly consist of local career criminals that band together for their involvement in organized criminal activities such as [[extortion]], [[loan sharking]], [[prostitution]] and narcotics. Often these local criminals groups are strongly connected with, or in some cases even have an official membership to, outlaw motorcycle gangs such as the Hells Angels MC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1012/Nederland/article/detail/2332755/2006/01/20/Holleeder-brein-Hells-Angels.dhtml|title=Cookies op AD.nl|work=ad.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panorama.nl/crimipedia/dick-v|title=Dick V.|work=Panorama|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411084648/http://www.panorama.nl/crimipedia/dick-v|archivedate=2015-04-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of indigenous organized crime is mainly based in the [[Flanders|Flemish]] regions bordering the Netherlands, mainly located in the provinces of [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]] and [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerp]]. The region is known to be one of the most important production areas for synthetic drugs such as [[ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]]. It is home to organized criminal gangs active in the production, transport and distribution of synthetic narcotics and marihuana, as well as in the importation of hashish and cocaine, controlled by both local [[Flemish people|Flemish]] and [[Dutch people|Dutch]] criminal entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.levif.be/actualite/belgique/portraits-robots-des-mafias-en-belgique/article-normal-166731.html|title=Portraits-robots des mafias en Belgique|work=levif.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vandaag.be/binnenland/110654_belgie-draaischijf-van-synthetische-drugs.html|title=België draaischijf van synthetische drugs|work=vandaag.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbvl.be/cnt/aid749495/belgie-grote-producent-van-synthetische-drugs|title=België grote producent van synthetische drugs|author=jrosquin|work=Het Belang van Limburg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moroccan crime groups===
Out of the [[Netherlands]]' substantial Moroccan community also grew criminal gangs mostly involved in the trafficking of [[marihuana]]. This is due to the ties of some families to their area of origin, the [[Rif]], which is a known hub of [[marihuana]]/[[hashish]] cultivating. Certain criminals have also progressed to the trafficking of [[cocaine]]. [[Armed robbery]] and [[prostitution]] are known activities of the Dutch Moroccan groups as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burojansen.nl/traa/b8_2_30.htm |title=Bijlage VIII - IV.7. Georganiseerde misdaad onder Marokkanen in Nederland |publisher=Burojansen.nl |date= |accessdate=2013-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moluccan ''Kajahatan''===
The word '''kejahatan''' is Indonesian for 'committing crime' and has since become a synonym for [[Moluccans|Moluccan]] organized crime. Due to the Netherlands' large Moluccan [[Ambonese]] community '''kejahatan''' groups also exist in the [[Netherlands]]. Dutch [[Ambonese]] gangsters are involved in [[kidnapping]], [[armed robbery]], [[extortion]] and [[drug trafficking]], especially the growing and illegally distributing of [[marihuana]]. An alleged criminal gang of [[Ambonese]] origin is [[Satudarah]], a known [[One percenter (motorcycle)|one-percenter]] [[motorcycle club]]. Ambonese gangsters have traditionally also assisted other criminal enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://malukulifestyle.hyves.nl/forum/3522704/epc3/Incidenten_Molukse_KAJAHATAN_de_georganiseerde_misdaad/# |title=Maluku Lifestyle Hyve - hyves.nl |publisher=Malukulifestyle.hyves.nl |date= |accessdate=2013-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incidents with the so-called '''Tattoo killers''', a Moluccan/Ambonese gang specialised in [[contract killing]], have also been major news in the Dutch criminal underworld in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/article/detail.aspx?articleid=DMF20121112_00366566 |title=Tattoo-killer nieuw spoor in moord op motorhandelaar - Het Nieuwsblad |publisher=Nieuwsblad.be |date=2012-11-13 |accessdate=2013-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Afro-Dutch crime groups===
Criminal groups consisting of descendants of [[Afro-Surinamese]] and [[Afro-Curaçaoans|Afro-Curaçaoan]] immigrants exist in major cities in the [[Netherlands]]. While some of said groups are involved in petty crimes, other Afro-Dutch crime groups have been responsible for the more sophisticated trafficking of [[cocaine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antilliaansdagblad.com/images/stories/adnews/november/20-11-09/P07.pdf|title=Antilliaansdagblad|publisher=Antilliaansdagblad.com|accessdate=2013-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since both [[Suriname]] and the [[Netherlands Antilles]] are known transit zones for the drug trafficking from Colombia, Curaçaoan and Surinamese crime groups based in the Netherlands have also formed alliances with said Colombian groups and have committed [[contract killings]] for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gva.be/regio-antwerpen-stad/borgerhout/geweld-en-liquidaties-zijn-wekelijkse-kost-nederlandse-drugswereld.aspx |title=Geweld en liquidaties wekelijkse kost in Nederlandse drugswereld |publisher=Gva.be |date=2013-10-22 |accessdate=2013-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prostitution]], [[Truck hijacking|hijacking]] and [[List of confidence tricks|ripdeals]] are known activities of [[Afro-Surinamese]] and [[Afro-Curaçaoans|Afro-Curaçaoan]] groups.

Gang wars over turf have appeared from time to time. The Amsterdam district [[Bijlmermeer]] for instance has been the scene of violence between two of its biggest gangs, the ''[[Hopi Boys]]'' and the ''Kloekhorststraat Gang''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metronieuws.nl/binnenland/2013/09/moord-bijlmer-in-fijne-buurt |title=Moord Bijlmer in Fijne Buurt |publisher=Metronieuws.nl |date=2013-09-09 |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from these Netherlands-originated groups, gangs that originated in the Caribbean have also been able to set up shop in the Netherlands. The [[No Limit Soldiers (organized crime group)|No Limit Soldiers]] gang, which originated in Curaçao, for instance now has bases in cities such as Rotterdam, where they're involved in gang violence and organized crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panorama.nl/crimipedia/de-curacao-holland-connection |title=De Curaçao-Holland connection &amp;#124; Crimesite Panorama |publisher=Panorama.nl |date=2013-08-28 |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Crips in the Netherlands====
The Netherlands is the only country in Europe where the [[Crips]] have a significant presence.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} In the major cities of [[Den Haag]], [[Rotterdam]] and [[Amsterdam]] Crip-gangs were formed in the 80's. There are a lot of Crip-gangs in the Netherlands but only 12 of them are regarded as a serious criminal organization. The 12 criminal gangs are mostly composed of older adolescent males (in contrast to the majority of the street gangs which are composed of youths) who are involved in organized crime such as [[drug trafficking]], [[arms trafficking]], [[prostitution]], [[contract killing]] and [[extortion]]. The groups are mainly composed of [[Dutch Antillean people|Dutch Antilleans]] (mainly [[Afro-Curaçaoan]]s) and [[Afro-Surinamese]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.camilleri.nl/2012/01/gangs-in-nederland/ |title=Gangs in Nederland &amp;#124; Crimesite Camilleri |publisher=Camilleri.nl |date=2013-09-15 |accessdate=2013-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Dutch criminals ==
*[[Klaas Bruinsma (drug lord)|Klaas Bruinsma]] trafficked [[hashish]] from [[Pakistan]]. His nickname was De Dominee (the Reverend) due to his habit of  dressing in black and lecturing others.
*[[Willem Holleeder]] was one of the perpetrators of the [[Kidnapping of Freddy Heineken|Heineken kidnapping]] in 1983. In the early 2000s, he extorted real estate trader [[Willem Endstra]]. Endstra was later killed, allegedly by Holleeder.
*[[Cor van Hout]] was the mastermind behind the [[kidnapping of Freddy Heineken]]. After serving jail time, he went back into the underworld together with his brother-in-law Willem Holleeder. He was assassinated in 2003, following other unsuccessful assassination attempts in 1996 and 2000.
*[[John Mieremet]] and Sam Klepper made up a successful duo in the criminal underworld. They were mostly involved in the hashish trade and robberies. In 2005, he was shot in [[Thailand]].

The '''Phoenix Throne''' (''eojwa'') is the [[English language|English]] term used to identify the [[throne]] of the hereditary monarchs of Korea. In an abstract sense, the Phoenix Throne also refers [[rhetorically]] to the [[head of state]] of the [[Joseon dynasty]] (1392–1897) and the [[Empire of Korea]] (1897–1910).

The [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]] motif &lt;ref&gt;The connection with Korea's history was acknowledged when the phoenix was incorporated in the modern State Seal of the [[Republic of Korea]] (''guksae'' 국새, 國璽)-- ''see'' "Three-Legged Bird to Replace Phoenix on State Seal," ''Chosun Ilbo'' (Seoul). January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; symbolizes the king's supreme authority.&lt;ref&gt;Korean Ministry of Culture and Information. (1978). ''A Handbook of Korea,'' p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;  The phoenix has a long association with Korean royalty &amp;mdash; for example, in [[Goguryeo]] tomb murals like that of the Middle Gangseo Tumulus where the painted image of a phoenix is featured.&lt;ref&gt;Korea Culture and Information Service (KOCIS), [http://korea-japanese.goodsw.net/news.do?mode=detail&amp;thiscode=eng030011&amp;guid=40815 The Culture and Customs of Goguryeo]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
==History==
[[File:Gojong-King.of.the.Korean.Empire-1903.jpg|thumb|right|The portrait of [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|Emperor Gojong]] enthroned. Lithograph by Joseph de la Nezière, 1903.]]

Enthronement ceremonies and the throne itself has evolved across the span of Korean history.  For example, from 1399–1549, seven of twelve kings were enthroned in the royal throne hall (''Geunjeong-jeon'') at [[Gyeongbokgung|Gyeongbokgung Palace]]. In other words, [[Jeongjong of Joseon|Jeongjong]], [[Sejong the Great|Sejong]], [[Danjong of Joseon|Danjong]], [[Sejo of Joseon|Sejo]], [[Seongjong of Joseon|Seongjong]], [[Jungjong of Joseon|Jungjong]], and [[Myeongjong of Joseon|Myeongjong]] ascended the Phoenix Throne in the same royal location.&lt;ref&gt;Life in Korea,  [http://www.lifeinkorea.com/Travel2/seoul/66  Gyeongbokgung Palace, Keunjeong-jeon]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetorical usage==
This flexible English term is also a [[rhetorical]] [[trope (linguistics)|trope]].  Depending on context, the Phoenix Throne can be construed as a [[metonymy]], which is a rhetorical device for an allusion relying on proximity or correspondence, as for example referring to actions of the monarch or as "actions of the Phoenix Throne."

The Phoenix Throne is also understood as a [[synecdoche]], which is related to metonymy and metaphor in suggesting a play on words by identifying a closely related conceptualization, e.g.,

* referring to the whole with the name of a part, such as "Phoenix Throne" for the serial symbols and ceremonies of enthronement
:* " ... Yi Pang-won ... ascended the Phoenix Throne as [[Taejong of Joseon|King Taejong]] in 1400."&lt;ref&gt;Korea History Project, [http://www.koreanhistoryproject.org/Ket/C08/E0804.htm  Choson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731180249/http://www.koreanhistoryproject.org/Ket/C08/E0804.htm |date=2010-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* referring to the general with the specific, such as "Phoenix Throne" for kingship—as in:

[[File:Eirene Ploutos Glyptothek Munich 219 n4.jpg|thumb|right|280px|[[Eirene (Greek goddess)|Eirene]] with the infant Ploutos: Roman copy after [[Cephisodotus the Elder|Kephisodotos]]' votive statue, c. 370BCE, in the Agora, Athens]]
'''Plutus''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|l|uː|t|ə|s}} ({{lang-grc-gre|Πλοῦτος}}, ''Ploutos'', literally "wealth") is the Greek god of wealth. He is either the son of [[Demeter]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Kerenyi]], "We are not surprised to learn that the fruit of her love was Ploutos, "riches". What else could have sprung from the willingness of the grain goddess? (''Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter'' (Bollingen) 1967, p 30).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Iasion]], with whom she lay in a thrice-ploughed field; or the child of [[Hades|Plouton]] and [[Persephone]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Kerenyi]], "After the rape of Persephone a child was born, the little Ploutos, who resembled the ravisher, Plouton- Latinized as Pluto. ... In two representations of the Eleusinian goddesses intended for the general public, two magnificent vase paintings in late Attic style, we see the child; once as a little boy standing with a cornucopia before the enthroned Demeter, and once in the cornucopia being handed to Demeter by a goddess rising out of the earth- as though he had been born down there in the realm to which Kore had been carried away. (''Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter'' (Bollingen) 1967, p 31).&lt;/ref&gt;. In the theology of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] he is regarded as the "Divine Child."

==In the arts==

[[File:S03 06 01 020 image 2538.jpg|thumbnail| Sencathea [?] [Female figure] feeding infant Plutus from horn of plenty, relief, Rome. Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]
In the philosophized mythology of the later Classical period, Plutus is envisaged by [[Aristophanes]] as blinded by [[Zeus]], so that he would be able to dispense his gifts without prejudice; he is also lame, as he takes his time arriving, and winged, so he leaves faster than he came.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Plutus (play)|Plutus]]'' (''Wealth'', second version, 388 BC)&lt;/ref&gt; When the god's sight is restored, in [[Plutus (play)|Aristophanes' comedy]], he is then able to determine who is deserving of wealth, creating havoc.

Among the Eleusinian figures painted on [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek ceramics]], regardless of whether he is depicted as child or youthful ''[[ephebos|ephebe]]'', Plutus can be identified as the one bearing the [[cornucopia]]—horn of plenty. In later [[allegory|allegorical]] [[bas-reliefs]], Plutus is depicted as a boy in the arms of [[Eirene (Greek goddess)|Eirene]], as Prosperity is the gift of "Peace", or in the arms of [[Tyche]], the Fortune of Cities.

In [[Lucian of Samosata]]'s satirical dialogue ''Timon'', Ploutus, the very embodiment of worldly goods written up in a parchment will, says to Hermes:
{{cquote|it is not Zeus who sends me, but hades, who has his own ways of conferring wealth and making presents; hades and Plutus are not unconnected, you see. When I am to flit from one house to another, they lay me on parchment, seal me up carefully, make a parcel of me and take me round. The dead man lies in some dark corner, shrouded from the knees upward in an old sheet, with the cats fighting for possession of him, while those who have expectations wait for me in the public place, gaping as wide as young swallows that scream for their mother's return.}}

{{anchor|dante_plutus}}In Canto VII of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''The Inferno'', Plutus is a demon of wealth who guards the fourth circle of Hell, "The Hoarders and the Wasters". Dante likely included Plutus to symbolize the evil of hoarding wealth.

==Etymology==
Like many other figures in Greek and Roman mythology, Plutus' name is related to several English words. These include:
*[[Plutocracy]], rule by the wealthy, and [[:wikt:plutocrat|plutocrat]], one who rules by virtue of wealth
*[[:wikt:plutonomics|Plutonomics]], the study of wealth management
*[[wikt:plutolatry|Plutolatry]], the "worship" of money
* [[wikt:plutomania|Plutomania]], an excessive desire for wealth

Many foreign men and women take part in [[sex tourism]], which is thriving at resorts along [[Kenya]]'s coast. Thousands of girls and boys are involved in full-time [[child prostitution]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.es/contenidos/582/Kenia_Tourism_exploitation.pdf La explotación sexual de menores en Kenia alcanza una dimensión horrible – UNICEF España].

== Sex tourism on the coast ==
The ministry for tourism in Kenya has been severely criticised because of its lack of response to the booming sex tourism and child exploitation on the Kenyan coast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/201104270052.html Kenya: Supkem Slams Balala Over Sex Trade]. allAfrica.com (2011-04-26).

In 2006, a study by UNICEF reported that up to 30% of the population of children aged between 12 and 18 in the coastal regions of Malindi, Mombasa, Kilifi and Diani were engaged in some form of sex work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Report reveals Kenyan child sex industry of ‘horrific’ magnitude|url=https://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/kenya_37817.html|publisher=UNICEF|author=Chris Niles|date=19 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unicef1"&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/protection/kenya_37823.html Kenya – Sex tourism in Kenya: One girl’s story].

== Prostitution and health ==
{{see also|HIV/AIDS in Kenya}}
Access to health services is guaranteed by Article 43 of the Kenyan Constitution. However sex workers are often discriminated against and access to health services limited. &lt;ref name="spl" /&gt;

Kenya is one of the world's most [[HIV]] affected countries.&lt;ref name="avert"&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV and AIDS in Kenya|url=https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-around-world/sub-saharan-africa/kenya|website=AVERT|accessdate=17 December 2017|date=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex workers are the most affected group within the country. Research has shown that around 30% of sex workers are HIV positive.&lt;ref name="avert" /&gt;

Lack of [[condom]] use, (both amongst sex workers and the general public), fuelled the spread of HIV and other [[Sexually transmitted infections|STIs]]. Since 2001, the Kenyan Government has been distributing free condoms (180 million in 2013) and educating the public on their use.&lt;ref name="avert" /&gt; A study of Nairobi sex workers in 2015 reported about two thirds always use condoms with clients. This compares with 40% amongst members of the general public who have two or more partners.&lt;ref name="avert" /&gt;

HIV and STI testing is voluntary, however as the HIV and AIDS Prevention and Control Act 2006 criminalised HIV transmission, there is some reluctance for sex workers to get tested.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt; The 2015 Nairobi sex workers' study found 86% had been tested, 63% within the previous 12 months.&lt;ref name="avert" /&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Kenya}}
Kenya is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to [[sex trafficking]]. Boys were increasingly subjected to trafficking. Girls and boys are exploited in commercial sex throughout Kenya, including in sex tourism in [[Nairobi]], [[Kisumu]], and on the coast, particularly in informal settlements; at times, their exploitation is facilitated by family members. Children are also exploited in sex trafficking by people working in [[khat]] (a mild narcotic) cultivation areas, near gold mines in western Kenya, by truck drivers along major highways, and by fishermen on Lake Victoria. Kenyans are recruited by legal or illegal employment agencies or voluntarily migrate to Europe, the United States, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Kuwait, Qatar, the UAE, and Oman, in search of employment, where at times they are exploited in massage parlours and brothels,. Reports allege gay and bisexual Kenyan men are deceptively recruited from universities with promises of overseas jobs, but are forced into prostitution in [[Qatar]] and [[UAE]]. Kenyan women are subjected to forced prostitution in [[Thailand]] by Ugandan and Nigerian traffickers.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kenya 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271216.htm|publisher=US Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons|accessdate=18 December 2017}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some children in [[Dadaab]] and [[Kakuma]] refugee camps may be subjected to sex trafficking. Children from East Africa and [[South Sudan]] are subjected to sex trafficking in Kenya. Trucks transporting goods from Kenya to [[Somalia]] returned to Kenya with girls and women subsequently exploited in brothels in Nairobi or [[Mombasa]]. [[Nepal|Nepalese]] and [[India|Indian]] women recruited to work in [[mujra]] dance clubs in Nairobi and Mombasa face debt bondage, which they are forced to pay off by dancing and forced prostitution.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Kenya as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]]' country.&lt;ref name="state18"&gt;{{cite web |title=Kenya 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282683.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rogue state''''' or '''''outlaw state''''' is a term applied by some international theorists to states they consider threatening to the world's peace. This means being seen to meet certain criteria, such as being ruled by [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] or [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] governments that severely restrict [[human rights]], sponsoring [[terrorism]] and seeking to proliferate [[weapons of mass destruction]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.empereur.com/armscontrol/page1/page1.html Rogue States?], Arms Control and Dr. A. Q. Khan.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used most by the [[United States]] (though the [[US State Department]] officially stopped using the term in 2000&lt;ref name="Isolating" /&gt;), and in a speech to the [[United Nations|UN]] in 2017, [[Donald Trump|President Donald Trump]] reiterated the phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-41324970|title=US could destroy North Korea - Trump|date=2017-09-19|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been applied by other countries as well.&lt;ref name=glj&gt;Minnerop, Petra. (2002). [http://www.germanlawjournal.com/article.php?id=188 "Rogue States – State Sponsors of Terrorism?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212034924/http://www.germanlawjournal.com/article.php?id=188 |date=2007-12-12 }}. ''German Law Journal'', '''9'''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the term ==
As early as July 1985, President [[Ronald Reagan]] stated that "we are not going to tolerate … attacks from outlaw states by the strangest collection of misfits, loony tunes, and squalid criminals since the advent of the Third Reich," but it fell to the Clinton administration to elaborate on this concept.&lt;ref name="Isolating"&gt;{{cite web |title=Post–cold War Policy – Isolating and punishing 'rogue' states |url=http://www.americanforeignrelations.com/O-W/Post-cold-War-Policy-Isolating-and-punishing-rogue-states.html |work=Encyclopedia of the New American Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1994 issue of ''Foreign Affairs'', U.S. National Security Advisor [[Anthony Lake]] labelled five nations as ''rogue states'': [[North Korea]], [[Cuba]], [[Iran]], [[Libya under Muammar Gaddafi]], and [[Ba'athist Iraq]]. He described these regimes as "recalcitrant and outlaw states that not only choose to remain outside the family [of democratic nations] but also assault its basic values".&lt;ref name="Isolating" /&gt; In theory, to be classified as a ''rogue state'', a state had to do the following: seek to obtain [[weapons of mass destruction]], support [[terrorism]], and severely abuse its own [[citizen]]s.&lt;ref name="Isolating" /&gt; While four of the listed countries met all these conditions, Cuba, though known from repressing it citizens and its vocal criticism of the United States, was put on the list solely because of the political influence of the Cuban-American community and specifically that of the Cuban American National Foundation (pre-Jorge Mas Santos), whereas [[Syria]] and [[Pakistan]] avoided being added to the list because the United States hoped that Damascus could play a constructive role in the Arab-Israeli peace process, and because Washington had long maintained close relations with Islamabad—a vestige of the Cold War.&lt;ref name="Isolating" /&gt;

Three other nations, the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], [[Sudan]] and [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], were treated as ''rogue states'' as well.&lt;ref name="Isolating" /&gt; The US State Department at times labelled Yugoslavia as a "rogue state" because its leader, [[Slobodan Milošević]], had been accused of violating the rights of his nation's citizens, including but not limited to [[Croatia–Serbia genocide case|attempted genocide in Croatia]] and orchestrating the [[Srebrenica massacre]] in eastern Bosnia.&lt;ref name="Isolating" /&gt;

The United States employed several tools to isolate and punish "rogue states". Tough unilateral economic sanctions, often at congressional behest, were imposed on or tightened against Iran, Libya, Cuba, Sudan and Afghanistan. The United States selectively used air-power against Iraq for years after the conclusion of the Gulf War in 1991. Cruise missiles were fired at Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation for terrorist attacks against U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in September 1998. In March 1999, NATO launched a [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|massive air-bombing campaign against Yugoslavia]] in response to the Yugoslav Army's crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in the province of Kosovo.&lt;ref name="Isolating" /&gt;

In the last six months of the [[Clinton administration]], U.S. Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]] announced that the term ''rogue state'' would be abolished in June 2000, in favour of the term ''states of concern'',&lt;ref&gt;WAMU 88.5 American University Radio, Washington D.C., Broadcast on 19 June, 10–11 a.m. / Daily Press Briefing, Monday, 19 June 2000, Briefer: Richard Boucher, Spokesman Department 5-10, "States of Concern" versus "Rogue states"&lt;/ref&gt; as three of the nations listed as "rogue states" (Libya, Iran, and North Korea) no longer met the conditions established to define a ''rogue state''.&lt;ref name="Isolating" /&gt;

Libya was removed from the [[State Sponsors of Terrorism]] list in 2006 after achieving success through [[diplomacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wald|first1=Matthew L.|title=U.S. drops Libya from list of terrorist countries - Africa &amp; Middle East - International Herald Tribune|url=https://nytimes.com/2006/07/07/world/africa/07iht-libya.2143377.html|work=The New York Times|date=7 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relations with Libya also became more mutual following the eight month [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]] in 2011, which resulted in the National Transitional Council ousting longtime Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] from power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McElroy|first1=Damien|title=Gaddafi's death: Libya's new rulers 'stained' by manner of his death, says Philip Hammond|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8844744/Gaddafis-death-Libyas-new-rulers-stained-by-manner-of-his-death-says-Philip-Hammond.html|work=The Telegraph|date=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, after the US reopened its embassy in [[Cuba]] and restarted diplomatic relations with the Cuban government, Cuba was removed from the list of [[State sponsors of terrorism]] and was no longer referred to as a "rogue state".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What is behind the US-Cuba thaw?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-30524560|work=BBC News|date=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the [[Donald Trump]] administration labelled [[Venezuela]] a "rogue state" due to its gross human rights violations, [[anti-American]] stances and its involvement in the international drug trafficking. During the 2017 UN general assembly, UN ambassador [[Nikki Haley]] called Venezuela a global threat and a "Dangerous [[Narco-state]]". Some figures of the Venezuelan government, like Vice-president [[Tareck el Aissami]] and minister of defense [[Vladimir Padrino López]], were permanently banned from entering US territory, due to their involvement with human rights abuses and drug cartels. Later in the year, the US government banned all high ranking Venezuelan government officials from entering US territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Imbert|first1=Fred|title=Venezuela's bad relationship with the United States just got worse|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/15/venezuela-drug-trafficking-a-bad-relationship-with-the-us-got-worse.html|work=CNBC|date=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wyss|first1=Jim|title=Trump targets Venezuela’s government in new travel ban|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/venezuela/article175207481.html|work=Miami Herald|date=September 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later terms ==
In the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]], the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] returned to using a similar term. The concept of ''rogue states'' was replaced by the Bush administration with the ''[[Axis of Evil]]'' concept (gathering [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]], [[Iran]], and [[North Korea]]). U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] first spoke of this "Axis of Evil" during his January 2002 [[State of the Union Address]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/onpolitics/transcripts/sou012902.htm | work=The Washington Post | title=Text of President Bush's 2002 State of the Union Address}}&lt;/ref&gt; More terms, such as ''[[Axis of Evil#Beyond the Axis of Evil|Beyond the Axis of Evil]]'' and ''[[Outposts of Tyranny]]'', would follow suit.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

As the U.S. government remains the most active proponent of the expression ''rogue state'', the term has received much criticism from those who disagree with U.S. [[Foreign relations of the United States|foreign policy]]. Both the concepts of ''rogue states'' and the ''Axis of Evil'' have been criticized by certain scholars, including philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] and linguist [[Noam Chomsky]], who considered it more or less a justification of [[imperialism]] and a useful word for [[propaganda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/25/books/review/25freedland.html | work=The New York Times | first=Jonathan | last=Freedland | title=Homeland Insecurity | date=June 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics charge that ''rogue state'' merely means any state that is generally hostile to the U.S., or even one that opposes the U.S. without necessarily posing a wider threat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/02/12/1076548157407.html?from=storyrhs Pakistan, a rogue state unpunished], Sydney Morning Herald, February 13, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenleft.org.au/back/2004/571/571p12.htm PAKISTAN: How Washington helped create a nuclear 'rogue state'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826122120/http://www.greenleft.org.au/back/2004/571/571p12.htm |date=2006-08-26 }}, Green left online, November 17, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as author [[William Blum]], have written that the term is also applicable to the U.S. and [[Israel]]. In his ''[[Rogue State: A Guide to the World's Only Superpower]]'', Blum makes the case that the United States defines itself as a rogue state through its foreign policy.{{Page needed|date=February 2018}}

== Usage by and against Turkey ==
In 23 February 1999, Turkish President [[Süleyman Demirel]] described [[Greece]] as a "rogue state" because of its support to [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]] which is recognized as a terrorist organization by Turkey, [[United States]] and [[European Union]]. Demirel said that: "Greece serves as a sanctuary for members of the PKK seeking shelter and provides training facilities and logistics to the terrorists." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Çevik |first=Ilnur |date= 23 February 1999|title= Demirel describes Greece: A 'rogue state' |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/demirel-describes-greece-a-rogue-state.aspx?pageID=438&amp;n=demirel-describes-greece-a-rogue-state-1999-02-23 |newspaper= [[Hürriyet Daily News]]|location=[[Manila]] |access-date=13 March 2016 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

On June 28, 2012, after the [[2012 Turkish F-4 Phantom shootdown|shooting down of a Turkish warplane]] by the [[Syrian Army]] during the [[Syrian Civil War]], Turkish Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] declared [[Syria]] to be a "rogue state".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date= 28 June 2012|title= PM calls Syria rogue state as Turkey, Russia in touch|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/Default.aspx?pageID=517&amp;nID=24255&amp;NewsCatID=338 |newspaper= [[Hürriyet Daily News]]|location=[[Ankara]] |access-date=1 May 2016 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Commentator Robert Ellis, writing in the  British newspaper [[The Independent]] in 2016, wrote that [[Turkey]] under President [[Recep Tayyip Erdogan]] risks "being regarded as a rogue state" due to its increasingly authoritarian government, the [[Human rights in Turkey|deterioration of the human rights in the country]], the [[Foreign involvement in the Syrian Civil War#Turkey|Turkish government's involvement in Syria]] and [[State-sponsored terrorism#Turkey|its alleged support of terrorist groups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turkey has become a rogue state - and even Erdogan must face up to the fact |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/turkey-has-become-a-rogue-state-and-even-erdogan-must-face-up-to-the-fact-a6909196.html |publisher=The Independent |accessdate=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2581">The '''Social Science Genetic Association Consortium''', abbreviated '''SSGAC''', is a consortium of scientists dedicated to studying the role of [[genetics]] in important life outcomes in the [[social science]]s. It has received media coverage for its research looking for [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|genetic variant]]s associated with [[educational attainment]].&lt;ref name=wired/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/23/science/genes-education.html |title=Years of Education Influenced by Genetic Makeup, Enormous Study Finds |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |date=2018-07-23 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2018-09-26 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the Consortium's first study, published in 2013, found three such variants in a sample of 101,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/05/the-genetics-of-staying-in-school/482052/ |title=The Genetics of Staying in School |last=Yong |first=Ed |date=2016-05-11 |website=The Atlantic |language=en-US |access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SSGAC was founded by Daniel Benjamin ([[University of Southern California]]), David Cesarini ([[New York University]]), and Philipp Koellinger ([[VU Amsterdam]]).&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/story/are-diplomas-in-your-dna/ |title=Are Diplomas in Your DNA? |last=Molteni |first=Megan |date=2018-07-31 |website=WIRED |language=en-US |access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Benjamin, "One major impetus for the formation of the SSGAC was the growing recognition that most effects of individual genetic markers on behavioral traits are very small and that, consequently, very large samples are required to accurately detect them".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2013/05/genetic-variants-linked-educational-attainment |title=Genetic variants linked to educational attainment  |last=Kelley |first=Susan |date=2013-05-30 |website=Cornell Chronicle |language=en |access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded during a meeting of the CHARGE (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology) consortium on February 12, 2011.

'''Sri Ksetra''' (Śrī Kṣetra, သရေခေတ္တရာ ပြည်, IPA: [θəjè kʰɪʔtəjà pjì]; lit. "Field of Fortune"&lt;ref name="mha-1970-8-10"&gt;Htin Aung, Maung (1970). ''Burmese History before 1287: A Defence of the Chronicles.'' Oxford: The Asoka Society, 8 - 10.&lt;/ref&gt; or "Field of Glory"&lt;ref&gt;Aung-Thwin, Michael (1996). "Kingdom of Bagan". In Gillian Cribbs. ''Myanmar Land of the Spirits''. Guernsey: Co &amp; Bear Productions, 77.&lt;/ref&gt;), located along the [[Irrawaddy River]] at present-day Hmawza, was once a prominent [[Pyu city-states|Pyu settlement]]. The Pyu occupied several sites across Upper Myanmar, with Sri Ksetra recorded as the largest, the city wall enclosing an area of 1,477 hectares,&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Elizabeth (2012). ''The Pyu Landscape: Collected Articles''. Myanmar: Department of Archaeology, 175,&lt;/ref&gt; although a recent survey found it enclosed 1,857 hectares within its monumental brick walls, with an extramural area of a similar size, being the largest Southeast Asian city before Angkor times.&lt;ref&gt; Stargardt, Janice, et al. (2015). "Early urban archaeology in Southeast Asia: the first evidence for a Pyu habitation site at Sri Ksetra, Myanmar", Antiquity Dec 2015, Project Gallery.&lt;/ref&gt; Issues surrounding the dating of this site has meant the majority of material is dated between the seventh and ninth centuries AD, however recent scholarship suggests Pyu culture at Sri Ksetra was active centuries before this.

Sri Ksetra is the site for much of the Pyu artistic legacy. The arrival of Buddhism into the Pyu cities saw the increased artistic production, with very little surviving from the earlier period of occupation. The vast arraying of surviving material indicates a rich visual culture that was endorsed by the Pyu at Sri Ksetra.

The Pyu at Sri Ksetra declined in prominence around the ninth century AD. The final mention of the Pyu is found at Pagan, with a twelfth century stone featuring inscriptions in Pyu, Mon, Burmese and Pali.&lt;ref&gt;Luce, Gordon H. (1985). ''Phases of Pre-Pagan: language and history''. New York: Oxford University Press, 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{see also|Pyu city-states}}

Burmese legends greatly differ from the reconstruction of Pyu history by scholars. A widely held belief, based on the interpretation of the extensive interdisciplinary evidence suggests that Sri Ksetra was founded between the fifth and seventh centuries by the Pyu people.&lt;ref name="mat-24-26"&gt;Aung-Thwin, Michael (2005). ''The mists of Rāmañña: The Legend that was Lower Burma'' (illustrated ed.). Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 24 - 26.&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation has been challenge by scholars who have argued that it was occupied earlier than these dates.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Bob (2012).  "A thousand years before Bagan: radiocarbon dates and Myanmar’s ancient Pyu cities". Paper presented at Early Myanmar and its Global Connections Conference, Bagan, 5 - 7.https://www.academia.edu/5489143/Hudson_Bob_2012_A_Thousand_Years_Before_Bagan_Radiocarbon_dates_and_Myanmars_ancient_Pyu_cities_Revision_3&lt;/ref&gt; Radiocarbon dating tested on charcoal found at Sri Ksetra produce dates to between 50 – 200 AD, a timeframe that is significantly earlier than previously considered.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (2012).  "A thousand years before Bagan: radiocarbon dates and Myanmar’s ancient Pyu cities", 5 - 7.&lt;/ref&gt; This early date in the first centuries of the first millennium AD would place the Pyu as one of the earliest urbanised people in Southeast Asia. During two excavation seasons, January to February 2015 and December 2015 to February 2016, led by Janice Stargardt in Yahanda mound at Sri Ksetra, early sherds stamped with Buddhist motifs were found, later dated c. 340 +/- 30 CE &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/sri_ksetra/sri_ksetra | title=Sri Ksetra, Ancient Pyu City - Director Janice Stargardt — Department of Archaeology}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Pyu culture cremation burials around 270 +/- 30 CE. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/sri_ksetra/sri_ksetra | title=Sri Ksetra, Ancient Pyu City - Director Janice Stargardt — Department of Archaeology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sri Ksetra is the largest Pyu site discovered thus far (Beikthano and Sri Ksetra are the only Pyu sites that have been extensively excavated. Other important Pyu cities as Maingmaw and Binnaka could yield more artefacts with more extensive excavations). It occupied an area larger than that of the eleventh century [[Pagan Kingdom|Pagan]] or nineteenth century [[Mandalay]].&lt;ref&gt;Aung-Thwin (2005). ''The mists of Rāmañña: The Legend that was Lower Burma,'' 24 - 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The city walls at Sri Ksetra are the largest of any Pyu settlements.&lt;ref&gt;Moore (2012). ''The Pyu Landscape'', 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous ruined stupas and temples have been discovered both inside and outside the city walls at Sri Ksetra.&lt;ref&gt;"Sri Ksetra Survey Map, 2005 - 2007" (2008). Field School of Archaeology Pyay and University of Sydney. https://www.academia.edu/2411552/Hudson-2008-archaeological_survey_map_of_SRIKSETRA&lt;/ref&gt; The three principal stupas that are a feature of the Pyu landscape at Hmawza, Bawbaw gyi, Payama and Paya gyi, are also located outside the walls.

In conjunction to archaeological evidence, there are a number of written records that mention the Pyu, largely found in Chinese historical accounts. The earliest mention is the fourth century AD account by Ch'ang Ch'u, with later accounts by Chinese pilgrims Xuanzang and Yijing in the seventh century AD .&lt;ref&gt;Luce (1985). ''Phases of Pre-Pagan: language and history,'' 47.&lt;/ref&gt; In the eighth century AD Tang histories mentioned the arrival at the court of an embassy from the Pyu capital in 801.&lt;ref&gt;Phayre, Lt. Gen. Sir Arthur P. (1883). ''History of Burma'' (1967 ed.). London: Susil Gupta, 17.&lt;/ref&gt; While these written records assist with the dating of Sri Ksetra and demonstrate cross-cultural interactions, they are fragmented and cannot all be backed by other evidence.

Sri Ksetra was an important entrepôt between China and India. It was located on the Irrawaddy, close to the sea, before the Irrawaddy delta had been formed. Ships from the Indian Ocean travelled to Prome to trade with the Pyu and Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;Htin Aung (1970). ''Burmese History before 1287: A Defence of the Chronicles'', 8 - 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Trade with India brought important cultural influences to Sri Ksetra, including the arrival of Buddhism, which was imposed on existing belief systems. There is strong evidence of a rich Buddhist culture at Sri Ksetra, along with the existence of Hindu religion.

=== Royal Names ===
Several inscriptions discovered at Sri Ksetra possess possible royal names and dynastic titles. Below is a table of translated Pyu funerary inscriptions found on four stone burial urns, excavated outside the city walls of Sri Ksetra from what is believed to be a royal burial site.&lt;ref&gt;Moore (2012). ''The Pyu Landscape: Collected Articles,'' 210.&lt;/ref&gt;  First translated by O. Blagden in 1917, these inscriptions give insights into Pyu kingship and possible dating of Sri Ksetra.&lt;ref&gt;Blagden, CO (1917). "The 'Pyu' inscriptions", J''ournal of the Burma Research Society'' 7: 37 - 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tt-42"&gt;[[Than Tun]] (1964). ''Studies in Burmese History'' (in Burmese) '''1'''.

Current inscriptional evidence indicate two distinct dynastic names, Wikyama (Vikrama) and Warman (Varman).&lt;ref&gt;Moore (2012). ''The Pyu Landscape: Collected Articles,'' 210.&lt;/ref&gt; The first dynasty, called the Wikyama (Vikrama) Dynasty, is believed by [[G.H. Luce]] and [[Than Tun]] to have launched the Pyu calendar with the epochal date of 22 March 638, which later became the Burmese calendar, in 640 AD.&lt;ref name="ghl-330"&gt;Luce 1970: 330&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tt-1964-40"&gt;[[Than Tun]] (1964). ''Studies in Burmese History, 40.''&lt;/ref&gt; Given the evidence for the dating of Sri Ksetra to earlier than the seventh century, it is likely that Pyu kings existed prior to names mentioned on the burial urns. Burmese chronicle sources, on the other hand, suggest the Sri Ksetra dynasty was established in 444 BC by King Duttabaung (ဒွတ္တပေါင်), however no archaeological evidence has been from this early date.&lt;ref&gt;Tin, Pe Maung; Luce, Gordon H. (1923). ''The Glass Palace Chronicle of the Kings of Burma''. Lodon: Oxford University Press, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend==
According to ''[[Glass Palace Chronicle|Hmannan Yazawin]]'', the royal chronicle of the [[Konbaung Dynasty]], the Kingdom of Sri Ksetra was founded by two brothers named [[Maha Thanbawa]] and [[Sula Thanbawa]] in 484 BC. The brothers were scions of the [[Tagaung Kingdom]] located in Upper Burma, and ultimately descended from kings [[Abhiyaza]] and [[Dazayaza]], both of whom belonged to the [[Shakya|Sakya clan]] of the [[Buddha]]. The brothers had been born blind, and ordered to be executed at birth by their own father [[Thado Maha Yaza]] for their blindness. Their mother, [[Keinnayi Dewi]], however, had raised them in secret until 482 BC when the father discovered their existence, and ordered them killed once again. Their mother put the blind princes on a raft by their mother down the [[Irrawaddy river]] before the executioners of the king arrived. Adrift in the river, the brothers miraculously gained sight with the help of an [[ogress]].&lt;ref name="hy-1-164-165"&gt;Royal Historical Commission of Burma (1832). ''Hmannan Yazawin'' (in Burmese) 1–3 (2003 ed.). Yangon: Ministry of Information, Myanmar, 164–165.&lt;/ref&gt;

With their newfound vision, the brothers arrived at the environs of [[Sri Ksetra]] (near present-day [[Pyay]] (Prome)), whose [[Pyu people|Pyu]] inhabitants had been at war with [[Kanyan people]]. Having to lost their chief to the war, the Pyu nominated the newly arrived Maha Thanbawa as chief. The "Kingdom" of Sri Ksetra was founded in 484 CE. (''Hmannan'' does not indicate the extent of the kingdom.) In all, a total of 27 kings of this dynasty are said to have reigned for 578 years.&lt;ref name="hy-1-168-170"&gt;Hmannan Vol. 1 (2003), 168–170.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="app-17"&gt;Phayre (1883). ''History of Burma,'' 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hmannan'' continues that the end of the kingdom came in 94 AD due to a civil war between the Pyu and the Kanyan, two of the three main ethnic groups of the kingdom. (The [[Bamar|Mranma]] (Burmans) were the third.) The Pyu initially emerged victorious over the Kanyan. But the victors soon broke into three rival groups, and a second round of war ensued. Taking advantage of the confusion, a fourth group, the Mon of Lower Burma drove all indigenous groups out of Sri Ksetra. One of the refugee groups led by [[Thamoddarit]], nephew of the last king of Sri Ksetra, wandered on for a dozen years. In 107 AD, Thamoddarit founded the city of [[Bagan|Pagan]] (Bagan) and the [[Pagan Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="hy-1-185-188"&gt;Hmannan Vol. 1 (2003), 185–188.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Monuments and archaeological sites==
===Ramparts===
[[File:20160810 Gate Sri Ksetra 9207.jpg|thumb|Sri Ksetra, Bago, Myanmar. Yahanda gate seen from outside the city]]
Sri Ksetra is a large city site with ruins of many structures, palaces and stūpas. The most prominent feature of the city is the circular plan, marked by a semi-circle of ramparts on the north, south and western sides. Outside the ramparts there was a moat, marked by a succession of tanks in the dry season. At several points in the ramparts, there are prominent gates, and around these gates are shrines and important remains.
===Payama stūpa===
[[File:Payama from SSE.jpg|thumb|Sri Ksetra, Bago, Myanmar. Payama stūpa from the south.]]
The Payama stūpa is located north of the ramparts of Sri Ksetra near the village of Koneyoe (at 18°50'3"N 95°18'7"E). It is reported in the Myanmar chronicles to have been built by king Duttabaung to house relics of the Buddha. The structure is built of brick and lime mortar on four terraces. Having the conical shape characteristic of stūpas in early relief sculpture from Sri Ksetra, it is one of the first stūpas of the middle Pyu period and dates between the 4th and 7th centuries.
===Baw Baw Gyi Paya===
The Baw Baw Gyi Paya is an important Buddhist stūpa, located to the south of the ramparts of Sri Ksetra (at 18°47'10"N 95°17'7"E). It is a circular brick-built structure, raised on terrace to a height of approximately 46m. The shape of the stūpa is often compared to the [[Dhamek Stupa]] at [[Sarnath]] in India, with which it is likely coeval. With the fall of Sri Ksetra in the mid-ninth century, king [[Anawrahta]] opened the stūpa and removed the relic which was re-installed at this capital in [[Bagan]]. In its place, he left behind a number of signed votive tablets.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Strachan, ''Imperial Pagan: Art and Architecture of Old Burma'' (Honolulu: University of Hawaii, 1989), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:20160810 Bawbawgyi Pogoda Sri Ksetra Pyay Myanmar 9252.jpg|thumb|Sri Ksetra, Bago, Myanmar. Baw Baw Gyi from the north west]]
===Khin Ba mound===
[[File:Stone bas-relief of stupa.jpg|thumb|Sri Ksetra, Bago, Myanmar. Stone bas-relief of stūpa in sandstone, found in the Khin Ba mound.]]
The Khin Ba mound is located inside the ramparts, on the south side of the city, not far from the Tharawaddy gate and Mathe Gyagone stūpa. Located at 18°47'37"N 95°18'0"E, Khin Ba is the site of an ancient stūpa and one of the most important early archaeological sites in Sri Ksetra and Myanmar. First excavated in 1926-27, it has yielded a host of finds now on display in the Sri Ksetra Museum and the National Museum, Yangon. In addition to early terracotta plaques and stone reliefs, the 'great silver reliquary' was found at Khin Ba.&lt;ref&gt;Janice Stargardt, ''Tracing Thought Through Things: The Oldest Pali Texts and the Early Buddhist Archaeology of India and Burma'' (Amsterdam: Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; The reliquary, inscribed in Pyu and Pāli, was accompanied by a series of golden leaves carrying a Buddhist text of the sixth century. It is generally regarded as the oldest surviving example of the Pāli language.

== Art ==
Since the early twentieth century, excavations at this Pyu site have uncovered a significant amount of Pyu art, in contrast to the minimal finds at Beikthano and Halin.&lt;ref&gt;Moore (2012). ''The Pyu Landscape: Collected Articles,'' 176.&lt;/ref&gt; The objects recovered from Sri Ksetra can be dated between the fourth to ninth centuries AD, however, difficulties in dating Pyu art has meant that most artistic remains are broadly dated between this period. An art historical study of a stele discovered at Sri Ksetra suggests a first century AD date, which would make it the earliest Pyu artwork, however, this is contested among scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Gutman, Pamela and Hudson, Bob (2012-13). "A First Century Stele from Sriksetra." ''Bulletin de l'École Française d'Extreme-Orient'' 99: 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Further Scholarship has also demonstrated that the art of the Pyu draws from a range of influences, from both Indian and Southeast Asian cultures.

The artistic remains uncovered at Sri Ksetra are primarily Buddhist. However, the existence of sculpture and fragments depicting Hindu deities, most often Vishnu, suggests that [[Vaishnavism]] was practice alongside Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Luce (1985). ''Phases of Pre-Pagan,'' 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Remains at Sri Ksetra suggest a thriving Buddhist culture that existed in this Pyu settlement. The variety of Buddhist material includes votive tablets, stone sculptures, bronze and other precious metal sculptures, architectural fragments and reliquary objects. Along with other artefacts including handmade beads crafted from stone, glass, terracotta and bone, rings and silver bowls and plates. A chronology of Pyu art, demonstrating developments and characteristics of a ‘Pyu’ style, has not yet been established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guy|first=John|date=1997|title=A Warrior-Ruler Stele from Śrī Ksetra, Pyu, Burma|url=http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/1991/JSS_085_0g_Guy_WarriorRulerSteleFromSriKsetra.pdf|journal=Journal of the Siam Society|volume=85|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dating Pyu art ===
[[File:Statue of Vishnu and Lakshmi.jpg|thumb|''Statue of Vishnu and Lakshmi'', sandstone, Pyu period, found in near Hmaw Zar station.]]
Dating Pyu art at Sri Ksetra is difficult. Studies conducted at Sri Ksetra have used a variety of methods including radio carbon dating, stylistic analysis and palaeographic studies to determine dates, however much of the dating is still contested among scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Moore (2012). ''The Pyu Landscape: Collected Articles, 175.''&lt;/ref&gt; A palaeographic study of a gold leaf manuscript containing [[Pali]], recovered from the Khin Ba mound, suggests the script could be dated to the fifth century AD, much earlier then the original seventh century AD date it was attributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stargardt|first=Janice|date=1995|title=The Four Oldest Surviving Pali Texts: the Results of the Cambridge Symposium on the Golden Pali Text of Sri Ksetra (Burma), April 1995|url=|journal=Journal of the Pali Text Society|volume=XXI|pages=212|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study was important in reconsidering the date for the Khin Ba mound, however this dating has not been accepted by all scholars. An argument against dating Pyu material at Sri Ksetra earlier then the seventh century AD is based on the nature of stylistic comparison, with scholars suggesting that while an artefact may have similar attributes to a fifth century AD culture in India, this culture may have been active into the seventh century AD which could mean that the similarities could have derive from this later date.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Robert (2001). “Pyu art: Looking East and West”, ''Orientations'' 32: 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Continued research needs to be undertaken at Sri Ksetra to ratify these issues surrounding dating Pyu art.

=== Influences ===
Pyu art at Sri Ksetra has a number of influences. Art demonstrates similar qualities to the art of Southern India including the Gupta and post-Gupta periods, Andhra Pradesh and Sri Lanka. Silver Buddha sculptures recovered from the relic chamber of the Khin Ba mound demonstrate stylistic qualities with Sri Lanka, including broad shoulders, shortened necks, individual hair curls and transparent robes.&lt;ref&gt;"The Great Silver Reliquary of Sri Ksetra: Where Early Epigraphy and Buddhist Art Meet," The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 35:06, posted by MET Media.&lt;/ref&gt; While cultural influences on the Pyu focuses on Indian similarities, scholarship has also demonstrated similarities with the Mon of Burma and Dvaravati of Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, Charlotte (2010). “Ways of Seeing a Pyu Mon and Dvaravati Artistic Continuum”. ''Bulletin of the Indo Pacific Prehistory Association'' 30: 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Buddha and stupa triads, use of [[megalith]]s and shared imagery have been cited as demonstrating the influences of these neighbouring Southeast Asian cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (2001). “Pyu art: Looking East and West”, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The wide-ranging comparisons found in Pyu art demonstrates the complexity in studying the art of this culture.

'''Tehuelche''' (''Aoniken, Inaquen, Gunua-Kena, Gununa-Kena'') is one of the [[Chonan languages]] of [[Patagonia]]. Its speakers were nomadic hunters who occupied territory in present-day Chile, north of [[Tierra del Fuego]] and south of the [[Mapuche]] people. It is also known as ''Aonikenk'' or ''Aonek'o 'ajen.''

The decline of the language started with the [[Araucanization of Patagonia]], when many [[Tehuelche people]]s adopted the [[Mapuche language]] as their main language. While being quite separate from each other, the Tehuelche were considerably influenced by these two other languages and cultures.  This allowed the transference of morpho-syntactical elements into Tehuelche.[http://redalyc.uaemex.mx/redalyc/pdf/594/59401506.pdf]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} During the 19th and 20th centuries, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] became the dominant language as [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]] gained independence, and Spanish-speaking settlers took possession of Patagonia.

==Classification==
{{main|Chonan languages}}
Tehuelche belongs to the Chonan family together with [[Teushen language|Teushen]], [[Ona language|Ona]] (Selk'nam) and [[Haush language|Haush]]. The latter two languages were spoken by tribes in northeast and far northeast [[Tierra del Fuego]]. They are extinct.

The '''Tolai''' are the indigenous people of the [[Gazelle Peninsula]] and the [[Duke of York Islands]] of [[East New Britain]] in the [[Islands Region|New Guinea Islands region]] of [[Papua New Guinea]]. They are ethnically close kin to the peoples of adjacent [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]] and tribes like the [[Tanga people]] and are thought to have migrated to the Gazelle Peninsula in relatively recent times, displacing the [[Baining]] people who were driven westwards.

The majority of Tolais speak [[Kuanua]] as their first language (~100,000). Two other languages are spoken as first languages: [[Lungalunga language|Lungalunga]] and [[Bilur language|Bilur]], each with approximately 2,000 speakers.

The Tolais almost universally define themselves as [[Christianity|Christian]] and are predominantly [[Roman Catholic]] and [[United Church in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands|United Church]].  Christianity was introduced to the island when Methodist ministers and teachers from [[Fiji]] arrived in the New Guinea islands region in 1875.  However, in 1878 when some of the tribespeople ate four of the missionaries, the [[England|Englishman]] who led the missionaries, George Brown, directed and took part in a [[punitive expedition]] that resulted in a number of Tolais being killed and several villages burnt down.

In August 2007, the descendants of Tolai tribespeople who ate a Fijian minister and three Fijian teachers in 1878 publicly apologized for the incident to Fiji's High Commissioner, Ratu Isoa Tikoca.  The apology was accepted. At the event, Papua New Guinea's Governor-General Paulias Matane told the crowd he appreciated the work of the early Fijian missionaries in spreading Christianity in the islands region.[http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,22254565-5006506,00.html]

Notwithstanding the [[Christianization]] of the Tolais for more than a century, old beliefs and traditions still persist, e.g., the belief in the female spirits of the ''Tubuans'' with secret ceremonies performed by initiates of the [[Duk-Duk]]&lt;ref name="D'Alleva"&gt;{{cite book|last=D'Alleva|first=Anne|title=Arts of the Pacific Islands|date=1998|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=978-0-300-16412-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; society as well as the belief in sorcery to either gain someone's love or to punish an enemy.

The Tolais are divided into two [[Kinship#Lineages, clans, phratries, moieties, and matrimonial sides|moieties]]. Membership is determined by matrilineal descent.

'''Uppara is a [[Indian caste system|caste]] categorized as [[Other Backward Class]] in India.  primary economic activity.

==History==

According to [[Francis Buchanan-Hamilton|Buchanan]], the most important occupation of the Telugu Upparas at the beginning of the nineteenth century was the manufacture of salt.

Some members of the caste are [[Vaishnavite]]s and others [[Saivite]]s. They also worship various village deities, which vary according to the place of residence.

The one man commission constituted by the [[Government of Andhra Pradesh]], chaired by Sri Anantha Raman{{who|date=March 2013}}&lt;!-- How do you chair a one-man commission? --&gt; in its report in 1968 made certain observations and recommendations regarding the Uppara or Sagara community. Some of the points mentioned in the report are as follows:
*Uppara or Sagara is a caste of workers engaged in agriculture.
*It traces its descent from "Sagara Chakravarti" who was a Kshatriya. 
*It is said that they were originally Kshatriyas 
*They also engaged in manufacturing salt.
*
*When private manufacture of salt was forbidden during the British rule, the people of the community turned to other occupations. The Uppara seem to have made little shifts in an agrarian context. Losing their caste based occupation as salt makers, they mainly did agriculture.

There are many surnames for Uppiliya or Uppara or Sagara Community (Sourced from Sagara Uppara Community website)

A '''Viability study''' is an in depth investigation of the [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]] of the [[business idea]] to be converted into a business enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Nieuwenhuizen, C., Le Roux, E.E. and Jacobs, H., (2004). Entrepreneurship and how to establish your own business. 2nd Edition, Juta, Pretoria, RSA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feasibility report==
This type of report studies a situation (for example, a problem or opportunity) and the plan for doing something about it, then determines whether that plan is "feasible". This would involve determining whether it is technologically possible to achieve and whether it is practical in the current technological, economical and social scenario. The feasibility report does not provide a simple "Yes" or "No" answer, but is used in the [[analysis]] of a decision. It is not just a tool to provide a recommendation, it is also used to gather data and give reasoning behind the recommendation given, to be later used in evaluation.

This study is the most important especially to people who plan to start their own business.

==Recommendation report==
{{Seealso|SWOT Analysis}}
This type of report examines either a stated need or a selection of choices, or in some cases both. The report is a collection of analysis and evaluation of the situation, and generally will examine the strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and threats in the situation, take them into account, and be combined with the feasibility report in order to give a recommendation. Sometimes a recommendation can be given to do nothing, if all options currently possible would prove unbeneficial. The recommendation report answers the question "Which option should we choose?" (or "Which are the best options?") by allowing a recommendation to be made. This can be linked into the analysis of the [[continuum of choice]] in the scenario.

==Evaluation report==
This type of report provides an opinion or judgment rather that is based on the above two report, along with additional data available. It provides a studied opinion on the value or worth of something. This type of report compares the object of the analysis to a set of requirements (or [[:wikt:criteria|criteria]]) and determines how well it meets those requirements. Generally, the evaluation report will feature an overall recommendation on the course of action to be taken.

== History ==
=== European conquest and colonization ===
{{See also|History of Haiti}}
The presence of whites in Haiti dates back to the founding of [[La Navidad]], the first European settlement in the Americas by [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492. It was built from the timbers of his wrecked ship [[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]], during his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|first voyage]] in December 1492. When he returned in 1493 on his second voyage he found the settlement had been destroyed and all 39 settlers killed. Columbus continued east and founded a new settlement at [[La Isabela]] on the territory of the present-day [[Dominican Republic]] in 1493. The capital of the colony was moved to [[Santo Domingo]] in 1496, on the south east coast of the island also in the territory of the present-day Dominican Republic. The Spanish returned to western Hispaniola in 1502, establishing a settlement at Yaguana, near modern-day [[Léogâne]]. A second settlement was established on the north coast in 1504 called Puerto Real near modern [[Fort-Liberté]] – which in 1578 was relocated to a nearby site and renamed Bayaha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haitiantreasures.com/HT_fort-liberte.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028134351/http://www.haitiantreasures.com:80/HT_fort-liberte.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-10-28|title=Fort-Liberté: A captivating Site|accessdate=2010-07-01|publisher=Haitian Treasures}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clammer|first=Paul |author2=Michael Grosberg |author3=Jens Porup|title= Dominican Republic and Haiti|pages=339, 330–333|accessdate=2010-07-01|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kjde3Fmwb7IC&amp;pg=PA340&amp;dq=Fort-Libert%C3%A9,+Haiti&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=aGEcTL3hCYGFrAfKkc3cCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Fort-Libert%C3%A9%2C%20Haiti&amp;f=false|publisher= Lonely Planet|year=2008|isbn= 1-74104-292-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://population.mongabay.com/population/haiti/3725170/fort-liberte|title=Population of Fort Liberté, Haiti|accessdate=2010-07-01|publisher=Mongabay.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of precious metals such as gold boosted migration of thousands of [[Spaniards]] to Hispaniola seeking easy wealth. They tried to enslave the native inhabitants, but many of these died of diseases, and those that survived did not make good slaves.

The settlement of Yacanagua was burnt to the ground three times in its just over a century long existence as a Spanish settlement, first by French pirates in 1543, again on 27 May 1592 by a 110 strong landing party from a 4 ship English naval squadron led by [[Christopher Newport]] in his flagship Golden Dragon, who destroyed all 150 houses in the settlement, and finally by the Spanish themselves in 1605, for reasons set out below.&lt;ref&gt;''Historic Cities of the Americas: An Illustrated Encyclopedia'' (2005). David Marley. Page 121&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1595, the Spanish, frustrated by the twenty-year [[Dutch Revolt|rebellion of their Dutch subjects]], closed their home ports to rebel shipping from the Netherlands, cutting them off from the critical salt supplies necessary for their herring industry. The Dutch responded by sourcing new salt supplies from Spanish America where colonists were more than happy to trade. So large numbers of Dutch traders/pirates joined their English and French brethren trading on the remote coasts of Hispaniola. In 1605, Spain was infuriated that Spanish settlements on the northern and western coasts of the island persisted in carrying out large scale and illegal trade with the Dutch, who were at that time fighting a war of independence against Spain in Europe and the English, a very recent enemy state, and so decided to forcibly resettle their inhabitants closer to the city of [[Santo Domingo]].&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Franklin, ''The Caribbean: The Genesis of a Fragmented Nationalism'', 3rd ed. p. 54 New York, Oxford University Press 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; This action, known as the ''Devastaciones de Osorio'', proved disastrous; more than half of the resettled colonists died of starvation or disease, over 100,000 cattle were abandoned, and many slaves escaped.&lt;ref&gt;''Rough Guide to the Dominican Republic'', p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt;  Five of the existing thirteen settlements on the island were brutally razed by Spanish troops including the two settlements on the territory of present-day Haiti, La Yaguana, and Bayaja. Many of the inhabitants fought, escaped to the jungle, or fled to the safety of passing Dutch ships&lt;ref&gt;''Peasants and Religion: A Socioeconomic Study of Dios Olivorio and the Palma Sola Movement in the Dominican Republic''. Jan Lundius &amp; Mats Lundah. Routledge 2000, p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt; This Spanish action was counterproductive as English, Dutch, and French pirates were now free to establish bases on the island's abandoned northern and western coasts, where wild cattle were now plentiful and free.

=== Saint-Domingue ===
{{Main|Saint-Domingue}}
[[File:Hispaniola 1697-1795.png|thumb|300px|French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]] in the West and Spanish colony of [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]] in the East of Hispaniola island during colonial years.]]
In the early seventeenth century, the Spanish government ordered the evacuation of the northern and western coast of the island, and forcing the relocation to areas close to the city of Santo Domingo, to prevent the pirates from other European nations. This ended up being counterproductive to Spain, because in 1625 the pirates and French [[buccaneer]]s began to establish settlements on the island of [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortuga]] and in a strip north of Hispaniola surrounding [[Port-de-Paix]] and were soon joined by like-minded English and Dutch [[privateer]]s and [[pirate]]s, who formed a lawless international community that survived by preying on Spanish ships and hunting wild cattle.  Although the Spanish destroyed the buccaneers' settlements in 1629, 1635, 1638 and 1654, on each occasion they returned. In 1655, the newly established English administration on Jamaica sponsored the re-occupation of Tortuga under Elias Watts as governor. In 1660, the English made the mistake of replacing Watts as governor by a Frenchman Jeremie Deschamps,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Saint-Méry|first=Moreau|title=Description topographique, physique, civile, politique et historique de la partie française de l'isle Saint-Domingue|pages=667–670|year=1797 |edition=réédition, 3 volumes, Paris, Société française d'histoire d'outre-mer, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; on condition he defended English interests. Deschamps on taking control of the island proclaimed for the King of France, set up French colours, and defeated several English attempts to reclaim the island.  It is from this point in 1660 that unbroken French rule in Haiti begins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepirateking.com/books/books_buccaneersintewestindies_ch04.htm The Buccaneers in the West Indies in the XVII Century]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1663, Deschamps founded a French settlement [[Léogâne]] on the western coast of the island on the abandoned site of the former Spanish town of Yaguana.

In 1664, the newly established [[French West India Company]] took control of the new colony, and France formally claimed control of the western portion of the island of Hispaniola. In 1665, they established a French settlement on the mainland of Hispaniola opposite Tortuga at [[Port-de-Paix]]. In 1670, the headland of Cap-Français (now [[Cap-Haïtien]]), was settled further to the east along the northern coast. In 1676, the colonial capital was moved from Tortuga to Port-de-Paix.  In 1684, the French and Spanish signed the [[Treaty of Ratisbon]] that included provisions to suppress the actions of the Caribbean [[privateer]]s, which effectively ended the era of the buccaneers on Tortuga, many being employed by the French Crown to hunt down any of their former comrades who preferred to turn outright pirate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zeerovery.nl/history/tortuga.htm Short History of Tortuga, 1625-1688]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the 1697 [[Treaty of Ryswick]], Spain officially ceded the western third of Hispaniola to France which renamed the colony [[Saint-Domingue]]. By that time, planters outnumbered buccaneers and, with the encouragement of Louis XIV, they had begun to grow tobacco, [[indigo]], cotton, and [[Cacao bean|cacao]] on the fertile northern plain, thus prompting the importation of African slaves.

In 1777, France and Spain signed a border treaty, in which the western and northwestern coast of Hispaniola would be French and the rest of the island would be Spanish. By 1780 [[Saint-Domingue]] was the richest colony in the world, even than all the British [[Thirteen Colonies]] and the [[West Indies]] together. The French established an economy based on the production and export of sugar sustained on the forced labor of black slaves imported from west and central Africa. Slavery of blacks was characterized as one of the most ruthless in which terror and severe punishments were applied to slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hein, ''Written in Blood: The History of the Haitian People'' (University Press of America: Lantham, Md., 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1789, the population was composed as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leyburn|first=James|title=El pueblo haitiano}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=James|first=C.L.R.|title=The Black Jacobins|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MuKienAdrianaSang" /&gt;

* 28,000 ''Sang-melés'' ([[French language|French]] for: "Mixed blood") or [[free people of color]].
*452,000 slaves

The white population were 8% of Saint-Domingue’s population, but they owned 70% of the wealth and 75% of the slaves in the colony. The mulatto population were 5% of the population and had the 30% of the wealth.

When the [[French Revolution]] started, the ideas of freedom among men spread in Saint-Domingue. [[Afro-Haitian|Blacks]], and the majority African descendants such as [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], rebelled against their white masters and began a genocide against the French. In 1791, more than a thousand were killed.&lt;ref name="MuKienAdrianaSang" /&gt; In order to preserve their lives, they fled Saint-Domingue. The wealthy ''grand-blancs'', returned to France or went to [[Louisiana (New France)|French Louisiana]], but the ''petit-blancs'' who did not have many resources were compelled to move to the eastern side of [[Hispaniola]], [[Cuba]], and [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/cuba/French-in-Cuba.pdf French colonization in Cuba, 1791-1809]&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, there were many ''sang-melés'', some of which fled from Saint-Domingue as well, and settled in neighboring islands, mostly Puerto Rico and Cuba.

Most French colonists died or fled [[Saint-Domingue]] during the [[Haitian Revolution]] and the surviving remainder were either annihilated in the [[1804 Haiti Massacre]] or kept if thought to be of some use to the country's development, such as doctors, teachers, engineers and were not to be harmed in any way.&lt;ref name="David Ritter"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=David Ritter |year= 2010 |title=Forgotten faces of Haiti (Part 1) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6HU8MMPXpY |time=06:30 |accessdate=1 August 2010 |location=Haiti |publisher=Carib Productions}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the U.S. occupation of 1915, it was hard for white foreigners to become Haitian citizens due to restrictions on owning land in Haiti, with exceptions made for Germans, Poles, and Frenchmen who had fought with the rebels against France in the war and their descendants. White foreigners could become citizens only by marrying Haitians.&lt;ref&gt;Girard 2011 pg 340&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Before the [[Haitian Revolution]], Haitians were categorized under three major categories: white, black and mulatto but were far more complex in practice that involved the coarseness of one's hair, nose measurements and other facial features.&lt;ref name="Averill"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gwEL9mUcVA8C&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=milat+blan+haiti&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4cmO8Dao--&amp;sig=RVktC6X7akTIqZOKEPaBwWdPS5g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6ER2VaGyCImryATCgIPQAw&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=milat%20blan%20haiti&amp;f=false |title=A Day for the Hunter, a Day for the Prey: Popular Music and Power in Haiti |author=Averill, Gabe |page=5 |year=1997 |isbn=0226032914 |accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
== Demographics==
Today, a group of Haitians are of direct descendants of the Frenchmen who were saved from the massacre.&lt;ref name="David Ritter" /&gt; As of 2013, people of solely European descent are a small minority in [[Haiti]]. The combined population of whites and [[mulatto]]s constitutes 5% of the population, roughly half a million people.&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ha.html |title=CIA - The World Factbook -- Haiti |accessdate=2013-06-04 |publisher=CIA | archiveurl= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ha.html| archivedate= 7 May 2013 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; People born to foreigners on Haitian soil are not automatically Haitian citizens due to the ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' ({{etymology|Latin||right of blood}}) principle of nationality law.&lt;ref name=HaitiCitizenship&gt;{{cite web|last=Paraison|first=Edwin|title=Doble nacionalidad; La Constitución haitiana en la diáspora|url=http://elnacional.com.do/doble-nacionalidad-la-constitucion-haitiana-en-la-diaspora/|publisher=Hoy|accessdate=13 April 2014|language=Spanish|date=9 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to those of French descent, other White Haitians are of German, Polish, Italian, Spanish, English, Dutch, and American descent,  Most white Haitians live in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area, particularly the wealthy suburb of Pétionville.&lt;ref&gt;Dubois 2012 pgs 142-43&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Haitian constitution since the time of independence, all citizens are to be referred to as ''black,'' where all races are considered equal to avoid prejudice.&lt;ref name=Zephir&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zéphir|first1=Flore |authorlink=Flore Zéphir |title=Haitian Immigrants in Black America: A Sociological and Sociolinguistic Portrait|date=1996|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0-89789-451-0|pages=54–55|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gr58kE2T8NQC&amp;pg=PA54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creole term ''nèg'' is derived from the French word ''negre'' (to mean "black") and is used normatively to mean a ''person''.&lt;ref name="Averill" /&gt; A Haitian man is always a nèg, even if he is of European descent where he would be called a ''nèg blan'' ("white guy"), and his counterpart being nèg nwa ("black guy"); all with no racist overtones.&lt;ref name="WarnerWittner" /&gt; Foreigners are always referred to as simply ''blan'' regardless of skin-tone, denoting a double meaning for the word.&lt;ref name="Katz" /&gt;

In the countryside, it is common to hear a poor light-skinned person called ''ti-wouj'' (little red), ''ti-blan'' (little white), or simply "blan" rather than a ''milat'' (mulatto), which is commonly being used to exclude individuals at the bottom of the social ladder as the term "mulatto" historically coincides with people who were more privileged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ROuqj_xIRMoC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;lpg=PA172&amp;dq=milat+blan+haiti&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=L5fi9TRK_u&amp;sig=Mx6pjeUWY1ZA5pWfRco7lwsC2RY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vUV2VZnMMomhyAST7YLoBA&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=milat%20blan%20haiti&amp;f=false |title=Race |author=Gregory, Steven |page=172 |year=1996 |isbn=0813521092 |accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Women in society sidebar|science}}

Women have made significant contributions to [[science]] from the earliest times. Historians with an interest in [[gender]] and science have illuminated the scientific endeavors and accomplishments of women, the barriers they have faced, and the strategies implemented to have their work [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] and accepted in major scientific journals and other publications. The historical, critical and [[sociology|sociological]] study of these issues has become an academic discipline in its own right.

The involvement of [[Women in medicine|women in the field of medicine]] occurred in several early civilizations, and the study of [[natural philosophy]] in [[ancient Greece]] was open to women. Women contributed to the [[proto-science]] of [[alchemy]] in the first or second centuries AD. During the Middle Ages, [[convent]]s were an important place of education for women, and some of these communities provided opportunities for women to contribute to scholarly research. While the eleventh century saw the emergence of the [[medieval university|first universities]], women were, for the most part, excluded from university education.&lt;ref name="Whaley"&gt;Whaley, Leigh Ann. ''Women's History as Scientists''. Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, INC. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The attitude to educating women in medical fields in Italy appears to have been more liberal than in other places. The first known woman to earn a university chair in a scientific field of studies, was eighteenth-century Italian scientist, [[Laura Bassi]].

Although gender roles were largely defined in the eighteenth century, women experienced great advances in science. During the nineteenth century, women were excluded from most formal scientific education, but they began to be admitted into learned societies during this period. In the later nineteenth century, the rise of the [[women's college]] provided jobs for women scientists and opportunities for education. [[Marie Curie]], the first woman to receive a [[Nobel Prize]] in 1903 (physics), went on to become a double Nobel Prize recipient in 1911 (chemistry), both for her work on [[radioactive decay|radiation]]. Forty women have been awarded the Nobel Prize between 1901 and 2010. 17 women have been awarded the Nobel Prize in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine.&lt;ref name="Nobel Prize Awarded Women"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/women.html|title=Nobel Prize Awarded Women|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Cross-cultural perspectives===
In the 1970s and 1980s although many books and articles about women scientists were appearing, virtually all of the published sources ignored women of color and women outside of Europe and North America.  One of the few exceptions was Derek Richter's 1982 book about women scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Richter, ''Women Scientists:The Road to Liberation'', Macmillan, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of the [[Kovalevskaia Fund]] in 1985 and the [[Organization for Women in Science for the Developing World]] in 1993 gave more visibility to previously marginalized women scientists, but even today there is a dearth of information about current and historical women in science in developing countries.  According to [[Ann Hibner Koblitz]],&lt;ref&gt;Ann Hibner Koblitz, "Gender and science where science is on the margins," ''Bulletin of Science, Technology &amp; Society'', vol. 25, no 2 (2005), pp. 107–114.&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Quote|
Most work on women scientists has focused on the personalities and scientific subcultures of Western Europe and North America, and historians of women in science have implicitly or explicitly assumed that the observations made for those
regions will hold true for the rest of the world.
}}
Koblitz has said that these generalizations about women in science often do not hold up cross-culturally.  For example,&lt;ref&gt;Ann Hibner Koblitz, "Global perspectives," ''World Science Report 1996'', UNESCO, p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt;  
{{Quote|
A scientific or technical field that might be considered 'unwomanly' in one country in a given period may enjoy the participation of many women in a different historical period or in another country.  An example is engineering, which in many countries is considered the exclusive domain of men, especially in usually prestigious subfields such as electrical or mechanical engineering.  There are exceptions to this, however.  In the former Soviet Union all subspecialties of engineering had high percentages of women, and at the Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería of Nicaragua, women made up 70% of engineering students in 1990.

===Ancient history===
The involvement of [[Women in medicine|women in the field of medicine]] has been recorded in several early civilizations. An [[ancient Egypt]]ian, [[Merit-Ptah]] ({{circa|2700 BC}}), described in an inscription as "chief physician", is the earliest known female scientist named in the [[history of science]]. [[Agamede]] was cited by [[Homer]] as a healer in [[ancient Greece]] before the [[Trojan War]] (c. 1194–1184 BC). [[Agnodike]] was the first female physician to practice legally in fourth century BC [[Athens]].

The study of [[natural philosophy]] in [[ancient Greece]] was open to women.  Recorded examples include [[Aglaonike]], who predicted [[eclipse]]s; and [[Theano (mathematician)|Theano]], [[mathematician]] and physician, who was a pupil (possibly also wife) of [[Pythagoras]], and one of a school in [[Crotone]] founded by Pythagoras, which included many other women.&lt;ref name="four_thousand"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astr.ua.edu/4000WS/timelist.shtml|title=Time ordered list|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A passage in Pollux speaks about those who invented the process of coining money mentioning Pheidon and [[Hermodike II (Demodike II, Hermodice II, Damodice II)|Demodike from Cyme]], wife of the Phrygian king, Midas, and daughter of King Agamemnon of Cyme.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Nilsson, ''Mycenaean Origin of Greek Mythology'', 1983, University of California Press, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Tradition recounts that a daughter of a certain Agamemnon, king of [[Cyme (Aeolis)|Aeolian Cyme]], married a Phrygian king called Midas.&lt;ref name="Clay et al"&gt;Jenny Strauss Clay, Irad Malkin, Yannis Z. Tzifopoulos eds., ''Panhellenes at Methone: Graphê in Late Geometric and Protoarchaic Methone'', Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, 2017, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; This link may have facilitated the Greeks "borrowing" their alphabet from the Phrygians because the Phrygian letter shapes are closest to the inscriptions from Aeolis.&lt;ref name="Clay et al" /&gt;

During the period of the Babylonian civilization, around 1200 B.C., two perfumeresses named [[Tapputi|Tapputi-Belatekallim]] and -ninu (first half of her name lost) were able to obtain the essences from plants by using extraction and distillation procedures. If we are to argue chemistry as the use of chemical equipment and processes, then we can identify these two women as the first chemists. Even during the time of the Egyptian dynasty, women were involved in applied chemistry, such as the making of beer and the preparation of medicinal compounds.&lt;ref name="Rayner-Canham p. 1-2"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Women in Chemistry: Their Changing Roles from Alchemical Times to the Mid-Twentieth Century |last=Rayner-Canham |first=Marelene |publisher=American Chemical Society |year=2005 |isbn=978-0941901277 |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good number of women have been recorded to have made major contributions to [[alchemy]].&lt;ref name="Rayner-Canham p. 1-2" /&gt; Many of which lived in [[Alexandria]] around the 1st or 2nd centuries AD, where the [[gnostic]] tradition led to female contributions being valued. The most famous of the women alchemist, [[Mary the Jewess]], is credited with inventing several chemical instruments, including the [[double boiler]] (''bain-marie''); the improvement or creation of distillation equipment of that time.&lt;ref name="Rayner-Canham p. 1-2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="reframing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/uu37we/uu37we08.htm|title=Reframing the question|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such distillation equipment were called ''kerotakis'' (simple still) and the ''tribikos'' (a complex distillation device).&lt;ref name="Rayner-Canham p. 1-2" /&gt;

[[Hypatia of Alexandria]] (c. 350–415 AD), daughter of [[Theon of Alexandria]], was a well-known teacher at the Neoplatonic School in Alexandria teaching astronomy, philosophy, and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Hypatia#ref1178406|title=Hypatia {{!}} mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rayner-Canham p. 3-4"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Women in Chemistry: Their Changing Roles from Alchemical Times to the Mid-Twentieth Century |last=Rayner-Canham |first=Marelene |publisher=American Chemical Society |year=2005 |isbn=978-0941901277 |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is recognized to be the first known woman mathematician in history through her major contributions to mathematics.&lt;ref name="Rayner-Canham p. 3-4" /&gt; Hypatia is credited with writing three major treatises on [[geometry]], [[algebra]] and [[astronomy]]; as well as the invention of a [[hydrometer]], an [[astrolabe]], and an instrument for [[distillation|distilling]] [[water (molecule)|water]].&lt;ref name="four_thousand" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deakin|first=Michael A.

===Medieval Europe===
[[File:Hildegard von Bingen.jpg|thumb|Hildegard of Bingen]]
The early parts of the European [[Middle Ages]], also known as the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], were marked by the decline [[decline of the Roman Empire|of the Roman Empire]]. The [[Latin West]] was left with great difficulties that affected the continent's intellectual production dramatically. Although nature was still seen as a system that could be comprehended in the light of reason, there was little innovative scientific inquiry.&lt;ref name="SocietalCollapse"&gt;The End of the Classical World, (Lecture 12), in Lawrence M. Principe (2002) History of Science: Antiquity to 1700. Teaching Company, Course No. 1200&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabic world deserves credit for preserving scientific advancements. Arabic scholars produced original scholarly work and generated copies of manuscripts from [[Classical antiquity|Classical periods]].&lt;ref name="Rayner-Canham p. 6-8"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Women in Chemistry: Their Changing Roles from Alchemical Times to the Mid-Twentieth Century |last=Rayner-Canham |first=Marelene |publisher=American Chemical Society |year=2005 |isbn=978-0941901277 |location=Washington, D.C.|pages=6–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Christianity underwent a period of resurgence, and Western civilization was bolstered as a result. This phenomenon was, in part, due to monasteries and nunneries that nurtured the skills of reading and writing, and the monks and nuns who collected and copied important writings produced by scholars of the past.&lt;ref name="Rayner-Canham p. 6-8" /&gt;{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}.[[File:Medieval female physician.jpg|thumb|Female physician caring for a patient]]

As it mentioned before, [[convent]]s were an important place of education for women during this period, for the monasteries and nunneries encourage the skills of reading and writing, and some of these communities provided opportunities for women to contribute to scholarly research.&lt;ref name="Rayner-Canham p. 6-8" /&gt; An example is the German [[abbess]] [[Hildegard of Bingen]] (1098–1179 A.D), a famous philosopher and botanists, known for her prolific writings include treatments of various scientific subjects, including medicine, [[botany]] and [[natural history]] (c.1151–58).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.staff.uni-mainz.de/horst/hildegard/documents/flanagan.html Hildegard von Bingen (Sabina Flanagan)]&lt;/ref&gt; Another famous German abbess was [[Hrotsvitha|Hroswitha of Gandersheim]] (935–1000 A.D.)&lt;ref name="Rayner-Canham p. 6-8" /&gt; that also helped encourage women to be intellectual. However, with the growth in number and power of nunneries, the all-male clerical hierarchy was not welcomed toward it, and thus it stirred up conflict by having backlash against women's advancement. That impacted many religious orders closed on women and disbanded their nunneries, and overall excluding women from the ability to learn to read and write. With that, the world of science became closed off to women, limiting women's influence in science.&lt;ref name="Rayner-Canham p. 6-8" /&gt;

Entering the 11th century, the [[medieval university|first universities]] emerged. Women were, for the most part, excluded from university education.&lt;ref name="Whaley" /&gt; However, there were some exceptions. The Italian [[University of Bologna]], for example, allowed women to attend lectures from its inception, in 1088.&lt;ref name=wise&gt;{{cite journal|first=J. S.|last=Edwards|title= A Woman Is Wise: The Influence of Civic and Christian Humanism on the Education of Women in Northern Italy and England during the Renaissance |journal=Ex Post Facto: Journal of the History Students at San Francisco State University |volume =XI | year=2002 |url=http://userwww.sfsu.edu/epf/journal_archive/volume_XI,_2002/edwards_j.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attitude to educating women in medical fields in Italy appears to have been more liberal than in other places. The physician, [[Trotula of Salerno|Trotula di Ruggiero]], is supposed to have held a chair at the [[Schola Medica Salernitana|Medical School of Salerno]] in the 11th century, where she taught many noble Italian women, a group sometimes referred to as the "ladies of Salerno".&lt;ref name="reframing" /&gt; Several influential texts on women's medicine, dealing with [[obstetrics]] and [[gynecology]], among other topics, are also often attributed to Trotula.

[[Dorotea Bucca]] was another distinguished Italian physician. She held a chair of philosophy and medicine at the University of Bologna for over forty years from 1390.&lt;ref name=wise /&gt;&lt;ref name="Howard"&gt;Howard S. [https://books.google.com/books?id=RoqNOWuNa8oC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=%22dorotea+bucca%22&amp;sig=8woi3s53ZMsEXfRjee9uswZdUHI The Hidden Giants], p. 35, (Lulu.com; 2006) (Retrieved 22 August 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sackler"&gt;[http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/heritage_floor/dorotea_bucca.php Brooklyn Museum: Elizabeth A.

Despite the success of some women, cultural biases affecting their education and participation in science were prominent in the Middle Ages. For example, St. [[Thomas Aquinas]], a Christian scholar, wrote, referring to women, "She is mentally incapable of holding a position of authority."&lt;ref name="Whaley" /&gt;

===Scientific Revolution (sixteenth and seventeenth centuries)===
[[File:Margbig.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Margaret Cavendish]]]]

[[Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle upon Tyne|Margaret Cavendish]], a seventeenth-century aristocrat, took part in some of the most important scientific debates of that time. She was however, not inducted into the English [[Royal Society]], although she was once allowed to attend a meeting. She wrote a number of works on scientific matters, including ''Observations upon Experimental Philosophy (1666)'' and ''Grounds of Natural Philosophy''. In these works she was especially critical of the growing belief that humans, through science, were the masters of nature. The 1666 work attempted to heighten female interest in science. The observations provided a critique of the experimental science of Bacon and criticized microscopes as imperfect machines.&lt;ref&gt;Whaley, Leigh Ann. ''Women's History as Scientists''. (California: 2003), pg. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, the tradition of female participation in craft production enabled some women to become involved in observational science, especially [[astronomy]]. Between 1650 and 1710, women were 14% of German astronomers.&lt;ref&gt;Spielvogel, Jackson J. Western Civilization, Volume B: 1300–1815. [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-495-50289-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous female astronomer in Germany was [[Maria Winkelmann]]. She was educated by her father and uncle and received training in astronomy from a nearby self-taught astronomer. Her chance to be a practising astronomer came when she married [[Gottfried Kirch]], Prussia's foremost astronomer. She became his assistant at the [[astronomical observatory]] operated in Berlin by the [[Academy of Science]]. She made original contributions, including the discovery of a comet. When her husband died, Winkelmann applied for a position as assistant astronomer at the Berlin Academy – for which she had experience. As a woman – with no university degree – she was denied the post. Members of the Berlin Academy feared that they would establish a bad example by hiring a woman. "Mouths would gape", they said.&lt;ref&gt;Schiebinger, Londa (1992). "Maria Winkelmann at the Berlin Academy", in Gendered domains: rethinking public and private in women's history : essays from the Seventh [[Berkshire Conference on the History of Women]]. (Ithaca: 1992). 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Winkelmann's problems with the Berlin Academy reflect the obstacles women faced in being accepted in scientific work, which was considered to be chiefly for men. No woman was invited to either the [[Royal Society]] of London nor the [[French Academy of Sciences]] until the twentieth century. Most people in the seventeenth century viewed a life devoted to any kind of scholarship as being at odds with the domestic duties women were expected to perform.

A founder of modern botany and zoology, the German [[Maria Sibylla Merian]] (1647–1717), spent her life investigating nature. When she was thirteen, Sibylla began growing caterpillars and studying their metamorphosis into butterflies. She kept a "Study Book" which recorded her investigations into natural philosophy. In her first publication, ''The New Book of Flowers'', she used imagery to catalog the lives of plants and insects. After her husband died, and her brief stint of living in [[Siewert]], she and her daughter journeyed to [[Paramaribo]] for two years to observe insects, birds, reptiles, and amphibians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/apr/09/the-flowering-genius-of-maria-sibylla-merian/|title=The Flowering Genius of Maria Sibylla Merian|author=Ingrid D.

Overall, the [[Scientific Revolution]] did little to change people's ideas about the nature of women - more specifically - their capacity to contribute to science just as men do. According to Jackson Spielvogel, 'Male scientists used the new science to spread the view that women were by nature inferior and subordinate to men and suited to play a domestic role as nurturing mothers. The widespread distribution of books ensured the continuation of these ideas'.&lt;ref name=Jackson2014&gt;"book" in Spielvogel, Jackson (2014) Western Civilisation.

Although women excelled in many scientific areas during the eighteenth century, they were discouraged from learning about plant reproduction. [[Carl Linnaeus]]' system of plant classification based on sexual characteristics drew attention to botanical licentiousness, and people feared that women would learn immoral lessons from nature's example. Women were often depicted as both innately emotional and incapable of objective reasoning, or as natural mothers reproducing a natural, moral society.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Ruth, Women in Science: A Social and Cultural History. (London and New York: 2007), pg. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; The eighteenth century was characterized by three divergent views towards woman: that women were mentally and socially inferior to men, that they were equal but different, and that women were potentially equal in both mental ability and contribution to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-tNlvK-_t9IC|title=Women's History as Scientists: A Guide to the Debates|publisher=ABC-CLIO}}&lt;/ref&gt; While individuals such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] believed women's roles were confined to motherhood and service to their male partners, the Enlightenment was a period in which women experienced expanded roles in the sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Whaley, Leigh Ann.

In 1741-42 [[Charlotta Frölich]] became the first woman to be published by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] with three books in agricultural science.

[[Émilie du Châtelet]], a close friend of [[Voltaire]], was the first scientist to appreciate the significance of [[kinetic energy]], as opposed to [[momentum]]. She repeated and described the importance of an experiment originally devised by [[Willem 's Gravesande]] showing the impact of falling objects is proportional not to their velocity, but to the velocity squared. This understanding is considered to have made a profound contribution to [[Newtonian mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;Zinsser Judith P. ''Emilie Du Chatelet: Daring Genius of the Enlightenment.'' Penguin paperback, November 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1749 she completed the French translation of Newton's ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' (the ''Principia''), including her derivation of the notion of [[conservation of energy]] from its principles of mechanics. Published ten years after her death, her translation and commentary of the ''Principia'' contributed to the completion of the [[scientific revolution]] in France and to its acceptance in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essential Calculus Early Transcendental Functions|last=Larson, Hostetler, Edwards|publisher=Richard Stratton|year=2008|isbn=978-0-618-87918-2|location=U.S.A|pages=344|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marie-Anne Pierrette Paulze]] and her husband [[Antoine Lavoisier]] rebuilt the field of [[chemistry]], which had its roots in [[alchemy]] and at the time was a convoluted science dominated by [[George Stahl]]’s theory of [[phlogiston]]. Paulze accompanied Lavoisier in his lab, making entries into lab notebooks and sketching diagrams of his experimental designs. The training she had received allowed her to accurately and precisely draw experimental apparatuses, which ultimately helped many of Lavoisier's contemporaries to understand his methods and results. Paulze translated various works about phlogiston into French. One of her most important translation was that of [[Richard Kirwan]]'s ''Essay on Phlogiston and the Constitution of Acids'', which she both translated and critiqued, adding footnotes as she went along and pointing out errors in the chemistry made throughout the paper.&lt;ref name=Haines&gt;{{cite book|last=Haines|first=Catharine M.C.|title=International Women in Science a Biographical Dictionary to 1950.|year=2002|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara|isbn=9781576075593|pages=167–168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paulze was instrumental in the 1789 publication of Lavoisier's ''Elementary Treatise on Chemistry'', which presented a unified view of chemistry as a field. This work proved pivotal in the progression of chemistry, as it presented the idea of conservation of mass as well as a list of elements and a new system for chemical nomenclature. She also kept strict records of the procedures followed, lending validity to the findings Lavoisier published.

The astronomer [[Caroline Herschel]] was born in Hanover but moved to England where she acted as an assistant to her brother, [[William Herschel]]. Throughout her writings, she repeatedly made it clear that she desired to earn an independent wage and be able to support herself. When the crown began paying her for her assistance to her brother in 1787, she became the first woman to do so at a time when even men rarely received wages for scientific enterprises—to receive a salary for services to science.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Brock, Claire.

===Early nineteenth century===
Science remained a largely amateur profession during the early part of the nineteenth century. Women's contributions were limited by their exclusion from most formal scientific education, but began to be recognized by admittance into learned societies during this period.

Scottish scientist [[Mary Fairfax Somerville]] carried out experiments in [[magnetism]], presenting a paper entitled 'The Magnetic Properties of the Violet Rays of the Solar Spectrum' to the [[Royal Society]] in 1826, the second woman to do so. She also wrote several mathematical, astronomical, physical and geographical texts, and was a strong advocate for women's education. In 1835, she and [[Caroline Herschel]] were the first two women elected as Honorary Members of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dreyer|first1=ed. by J. L.

Ausg.] London, Wheldon &amp; Wesley, 1923.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English mathematician [[Ada Lovelace|Ada, Lady Lovelace]], a pupil of Somerville, corresponded with [[Charles Babbage]] about applications for his [[analytical engine]]. In her notes (1842–3) appended to her translation of [[Luigi Menabrea]]'s article on the engine, she foresaw wide applications for it as a general-purpose computer, including composing music. She has been credited as writing the first computer program, though this has been disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0092j0x|title=Ada Lovelace, In Our Time – BBC Radio 4|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, institutes for "higher" education of women (''Höhere Töchterschule'', in some regions called ''Lyzeum'') were founded at the beginning of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Claus-Hinrich Offen; ''Schule in einer hanseatischen Bürgergesellschaft: zur Sozialgeschichte des niederen Schulwesens in Lübeck (1800–1866)'', 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Deaconess Institute]] at [[Kaiserswerth]] was established in 1836 to instruct women in [[nursing]]. [[Elizabeth Fry]] visited the institute in 1840 and was inspired to found the [[London Institute of Nursing]], and [[Florence Nightingale]] studied there in 1851.&lt;ref name="CUP"&gt;''The Cambridge Illustrated History of Medicine'', R. Porter (editor), Cambridge University Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, [[Maria Mitchell]] made her name by discovering a comet in 1847, but also contributed calculations to the Nautical Almanac produced by the [[United States Naval Observatory]]. She became the first woman member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1848 and of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1850.

Other notable female scientists during this period include:&lt;ref name="four_thousand" /&gt;
* in Britain, [[Mary Anning]] (paleontologist), [[Anna Atkins]] (botanist), [[Janet Taylor]] (astronomer)
* in France, [[Sophie Germain|Marie-Sophie Germain]] (mathematician), [[Jeanne Villepreux-Power]] (marine biologist)

===Late 19th century in western Europe===
The latter part of the 19th century saw a rise in educational opportunities for women. Schools aiming to provide education for girls similar to that afforded to boys were founded in the UK, including the [[North London Collegiate School]] (1850), [[Cheltenham Ladies' College]] (1853) and the [[Girls' Day School Trust|Girls' Public Day School Trust]] schools (from 1872). The first UK women's university college, [[Girton College, Cambridge|Girton]], was founded in 1869, and others soon followed: [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham]] (1871) and [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville]] (1879).

The [[Crimean War]] (1854–6) contributed to establishing [[nursing]] as a profession, making [[Florence Nightingale]] a household name. A public subscription allowed Nightingale to establish a school of nursing in London in 1860, and schools following her principles were established throughout the UK.&lt;ref name="CUP" /&gt; Nightingale was also a pioneer in [[public health]] as well as a statistician.

[[James Barry (surgeon)|James Barry]] became the first British woman to gain a medical qualification in 1812, passing as a man. [[Elizabeth Garrett Anderson]] was the first openly female Briton to qualify medically, in 1865. With [[Sophia Jex-Blake]], American [[Elizabeth Blackwell (doctor)|Elizabeth Blackwell]] and others, Garret Anderson founded the first UK medical school to train women, the [[London School of Medicine for Women]], in 1874.

[[File: Annie Scott Dill Maunder.jpg|thumb|Annie Scott Dill Maunder]]
[[Annie Scott Dill Maunder]] was a pioneer in astronomical photography, especially of [[sunspot]]s. A mathematics graduate of Girton College, Cambridge, she was first hired (in 1890) to be an assistant to [[Edward Walter Maunder]], discoverer of the [[Maunder Minimum]], the head of the solar department at [[Greenwich Observatory]]. They worked together to observe sunspots and to refine the techniques of solar photography. They married in 1895. Annie's mathematical skills made it possible to analyse the years of sunspot data that Maunder had been collecting at Greenwich. She also designed a small, portable wide-angle camera with a {{convert|1.5|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} lens. In 1898, the Maunders traveled to India, where Annie took the first photographs of the sun's corona during a solar eclipse. By analysing the Cambridge records for both sunspots and [[geomagnetic storm]], they were able to show that specific regions of the sun's surface were the source of geomagnetic storms and that the sun did not radiate its energy uniformly into space, as [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin]] had declared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Stuart|last=Clark|title=The Sun Kings – The Unexpected Tragedy of Richard Carrington and the Tale of How Modern Astronomy Began|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2007|pages=140–146, 154–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Prussia]] women could go to university from 1894 and were allowed to receive a PhD. In 1908 all remaining restrictions for women were terminated.

[[Alphonse Rebière]] published a book in 1897, in France, entitled ''Les Femmes dans la science'' (Women in Science) which listed the contributions and publications of women in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Les femmes dans la science; notes recueillies par A.

===Late nineteenth century Russians===
In the second half of the 19th century a large proportion of the most successful women in the STEM fields were Russians.  Although many women received advanced training in medicine in the 1870s,&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Alpern Engel, "Women medical students in Russia, 1872–1882," ''Journal of Social History'', Vol. 12, No. 3 (1979), pp. 394-415.&lt;/ref&gt; in other fields women were barred and had to go to western Europe—mainly Switzerland—in order to pursue scientific studies.  In her book about these "women of the [eighteen] sixties" (шестидесятницы), as they were called, [[Ann Hibner Koblitz]] writes:&lt;ref name="ruswomen"&gt;Ann Hibner Koblitz, ''Science, Women and Revolution in Russia'', Routledge, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}
{{Quote|
To a large extent, women's higher education in continental Europe was pioneered by this first generation of Russian women.  They were the first students in Zürich, Heidelberg, Leipzig, and elsewhere.  Theirs were the first doctorates in medicine, chemistry, mathematics, and biology.

Among the successful scientists were [[Nadezhda Suslova]] (1843–1918), the first woman in the world to obtain a medical doctorate fully equivalent to men's degrees; [[Maria Bokova-Sechenova]] (1839–1929), a pioneer of women's medical education who received two doctoral degrees, one in medicine in Zürich and one in physiology in Vienna; [[Iulia Lermontova]] (1846–1919), the first woman in the world to receive a doctoral degree in chemistry; the marine biologist [[Sofia Pereiaslavtseva]] (1849–1903), director of the Sevastopol Biological Station and winner of the Kessler Prize of the Russian Society of Natural Scientists;  and the mathematician [[Sofia Kovalevskaia]] (1850–1891), the first woman in 19th century Europe to receive a doctorate in mathematics and the first to become a university professor in any field.&lt;ref name="ruswomen"/&gt;

===Late nineteenth century in the United States===

In the later nineteenth century the rise of the [[women's college]] provided jobs for women scientists, and opportunities for education. Women's colleges produced a disproportionate number of women who went on for PhDs in science. Many [[coeducation]]al colleges and universities also opened or started to admit women during this period; such institutions included just over 3000 women in 1875, by 1900 numbered almost 20,000.&lt;ref name="CWP" /&gt;

An example is [[Elizabeth Blackwell (doctor)|Elizabeth Blackwell]], who became the first certified female doctor in the US when she graduated from [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges|Geneva Medical College]] in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/changingthefaceofmedicine/physicians/biography_35.html|title=Changing the Face of Medicine – Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With her sister, [[Emily Blackwell]], and [[Marie Zakrzewska]], Blackwell founded the [[New York Infirmary for Women and Children]] in 1857 and the first women's medical college in 1868, providing both training and clinical experience for women doctors. She also published several books on medical education for women.

In 1876, Elizabeth Bragg became the first woman to graduate with a [[civil engineering]] degree in the United States, from the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|title=WEP Milestones|url=http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/bpi/jmep/milestones.html|work=Berkeley Engineering|accessdate=2011-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marie Curie|Marie Skłodowska-Curie]], the first woman to win a [[Nobel prize]] in 1903 (physics), went on to become a double Nobel prize winner in 1911 (chemistry), both for her work on [[radioactive decay|radiation]]. She was the first person to win two Nobel prizes, a feat accomplished by only three others since then.

Alice Perry is understood to be the first woman to graduate with a degree in civil engineering in the then [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], in 1906 at [[National University of Ireland, Galway|Queen's College, Galway, Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alice Perry|url=http://www.realizedvision.com/ap.php|publisher=[[Institution of Engineers of Ireland]]|accessdate=2011-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lise Meitner]] played a major role in the discovery of nuclear fission. As head of the physics section at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin she collaborated closely with the head of chemistry [[Otto Hahn]] on atomic physics until forced to flee Berlin in 1938. In 1939, in collaboration with her nephew [[Otto Frisch]], Meitner derived the theoretical explanation for an experiment performed by Hahn and [[Fritz Strassman]] in Berlin, thereby demonstrating the occurrence of [[nuclear fission]]. The possibility that Fermi's bombardment of uranium with neutrons in 1934 had instead produced fission by breaking up the nucleus into lighter elements, had actually first been raised in print in 1934, by chemist [[Ida Noddack]] (co-discover of the element [[rhenium]]), but this suggestion had been ignored at the time, as no group made a concerted effort to find any of these light radioactive fission products.

[[Maria Montessori]] was the first woman in Southern Europe to qualify as a physician.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} She developed an interest in the diseases of children and believed in the necessity of educating those recognized to be ineducable. In the case of the latter she argued for the development of training for teachers along [[Froebelian]] lines and developed the principle that was also to inform [[Montessori education|her general educational program]], which is the first the education of the senses, then the education of the intellect. Montessori introduced a teaching program that allowed defective children to read and write. She sought to teach skills not by having children repeatedly try it, but by developing exercises that prepare them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Phyllis Povell|title=Montessori Comes to America: The Leadership of Maria Montessori and Nancy McCormick Rambusch|location=California, US|publisher=UPA|page=170|date=2009|isbn=978-0-7618-4928-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emmy Noether]] revolutionized abstract algebra, filled in gaps in relativity, and was responsible for a critical theorem about conserved quantities in physics. One notes that the [[Erlangen program]] attempted to identify [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariants]] under a group of transformations. On 16 July 1918, before a scientific organization in [[Göttingen]], [[Felix Klein]] read a paper written by [[Emmy Noether]], because she was not allowed to present the paper herself. In particular, in what is referred to in physics as [[Noether's theorem]], this paper identified the conditions under which the [[Poincaré group]] of transformations (now called a [[gauge group]]) for [[general relativity]] defines [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation laws]].&lt;ref&gt;Emmy Noether (1918c) "Invariante Variationsprobleme" ''Nachrichten von der Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften der Göttingen'', 235–257. Presented by Felix Klein 16 July 1918. Final printed version submitted September 1918. Paper denoted 1918c, in a Bibliography of Noether's work, pp. 173–182 of ''Emmy Noether in Bryn Mawr: Proceedings of a symposium sponsored by the Association for women in mathematics, in honor of Emmy Noether's 100th birthday'' (1983, Bhama Srinivasan and Judith Sally, eds.) Springer-Verlag {{ISBN|0-387-90838-2}}. Biographical information on Noether's life can be found on pp. 133–137 "Emmy Noether in Erlangen and Göttingen", and on pp. 139–146 "Emmy Noether in Bryn Mawr".&lt;/ref&gt; Noether's papers made the requirements for the conservation laws precise. Among mathematicians, Noether is best known for her fundamental contributions to abstract algebra, where the adjective [[noetherian (disambiguation)|noetherian]] is nowadays commonly used on many sorts of objects.

[[Mary Cartwright]] was a British mathematician who was the first to analyze a dynamical system with chaos.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} [[Inge Lehmann]], a Danish [[seismologist]], first suggested in 1936 that inside the Earth's molten core there may be a solid [[inner core]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnh.org/explore/resource-collections/earth-inside-and-out/inge-lehmann-discoverer-of-the-earth-s-inner-core|title=Inge Lehmann: Discoverer of the Earth's Inner Core|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women such as [[Margaret Fountaine]] continued to contribute detailed observations and illustrations in botany, entomology, and related observational fields. [[Joan Beauchamp Procter]], an outstanding herpetologist, was the first woman Curator of Reptiles for the [[Zoological Society of London]] at [[London Zoo]].

[[Florence R. Sabin|Florence Sabin]] was an [[United States|American]] medical scientist. Sabin was the first woman faculty member at Johns Hopkins in 1902, and the first woman full-time professor there in 1917.&lt;ref name="Sabin Papers"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/Narrative/RR/p-nid/|title=The Florence R. Sabin Papers|website=profiles.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her scientific and research experience is notable. Sabin published over 100 scientific papers and multiple books.&lt;ref name="Sabin Papers" /&gt;

====United States before World War II====
{{See also|Timeline of women in science in the United States}}

Women moved into science in significant numbers by 1900, helped by the women's colleges and by opportunities at some of the new universities. Margaret Rossiter's books ''Women Scientists in America: Struggles and Strategies to 1940'' and ''Women Scientists in America: Before Affirmative Action 1940–1972'' provide an overview of this period, stressing the opportunities women found in separate women's work in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rossiter|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rossiter|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ellen Swallow Richards.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Ellen Swallow Richards]]]]
In 1892, [[Ellen Swallow Richards]] called for the "christening of a new science" – "[[oekology]]" (ecology) in a Boston lecture. This new science included the study of "consumer nutrition" and environmental education. This interdisciplinary branch of science was later specialized into what is currently known as ecology, while the consumer nutrition focus split off and was eventually relabeled as [[home economics]].,&lt;ref&gt;Kass-Simon, G. and Farnes, Patricia. ''Women of Science: Righting the Record''. Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University Press. 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Robert. ''Ellen Swallow: The Woman Who Founded Ecology''. Chicago: Follett. 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; which provided another avenue for women to study science. Richards helped to form the [[American Home Economics Association]], which published a journal, the ''[[Journal of Home Economics]]'', and hosted conferences. Home economics departments were formed at many colleges, especially at land grant institutions. In her work at MIT, Ellen Richards also introduced the first biology course in its history as well as the focus area of sanitary engineering.

Women also found opportunities in [[botany]] and [[embryology]]. In [[psychology]], women earned doctorates but were encouraged to specialize in educational and [[child psychology]] and to take jobs in clinical settings, such as hospitals and social welfare agencies.

In 1901, [[Annie Jump Cannon]] first noticed that it was a star's temperature that was the principal distinguishing feature among different spectra.{{Dubious|reason=her bio suggests that she decided to categorize by Balmer lines and that it was only later was it realized that this corresponded to temperature.|date=March 2016}} This led to re-ordering of the ABC types by temperature instead of hydrogen absorption-line strength. Due to Cannon's work, most of the then-existing classes of stars were thrown out as redundant. Afterward, astronomy was left with the seven [[Stellar classification|primary classes]] recognized today, in order: O, B, A, F, G, K, M;&lt;ref name="Pogge"&gt;{{cite web |title=Introduction to Stars, Galaxies, &amp; the Universe |first=Richard|last=Pogge|url=http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Unit1/sptypes.html |date=8 January 2006 |publisher=Ohio State University Department of Astronomy}}&lt;/ref&gt; that has since been extended.

[[File:Leavitt henrietta b1.jpg|thumb|160px|alt=Woman sitting at desk writing, with short hair, long-sleeved white blouse and vest|Henrietta Swan Leavitt made fundamental contributions to astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hamblin |first=Jacob Darwin |title=Science in the early twentieth century: an encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/?id=mpiZRAiE0JwC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;lpg=PA181&amp;dq=Leavitt+california+benjamin+leavitt#PPA181,M1 |pages=181–184 |year=2005 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=1-85109-665-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Henrietta Swan Leavitt]] first published her study of variable stars in 1908. This discovery became known as the "period-luminosity relationship" of [[Cepheid variable]]s.&lt;ref name="Malatesta"&gt;{{cite web |title=Delta Cephei |first=Kerri|last=Malatesta|url=http://www.aavso.org/vsots_delcep |date=16 July 2010 |publisher=American Association of Variable Star Observers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our picture of the universe was changed forever, largely because of Leavitt's discovery.

The accomplishments of [[Edwin Hubble]], renowned American astronomer, were made possible by Leavitt's groundbreaking research and Leavitt's Law. "If Henrietta Leavitt had provided the key to determine the size of the cosmos, then it was Edwin Powell Hubble who inserted it in the lock and provided the observations that allowed it to be turned", wrote David H. and Matthew D.H. Clark in their book ''Measuring the Cosmos''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Measuring the Cosmos: How Scientists Discovered the Dimensions of the Universe |author1=David H. Clark |author2=Matthew D.H.

Hubble often said that Leavitt deserved the Nobel for her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oneminuteastronomer.com/2009/11/19/mile-markers-galaxies |author=&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/Cool-Astronomy/Blogs/One-Minute-Astronomer Ventrudo, Brian]&lt;/span&gt; |title=Mile Markers to the Galaxies |date=19 November 2009 |work=One-Minute Astronomer |accessdate=25 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gösta Mittag-Leffler]] of the Swedish Academy of Sciences had begun paperwork on her nomination in 1924, only to learn that she had died of cancer three years earlier&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Big Bang: The Origin of the Universe |last=Singh|first=Simon|authorlink=Simon Singh |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4iAsRemPRJkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=big+bang+the+origin+of+the+universe+simon+singh#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=0-00-716221-9 |accessdate=25 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the Nobel prize cannot be awarded posthumously).

In 1925, Harvard graduate student [[Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin]] demonstrated for the first time from existing evidence on the spectra of stars that stars were made up almost exclusively of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]], one of the most fundamental theories in stellar [[astrophysics]].&lt;ref name="Pogge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Malatesta" /&gt;

Canadian born [[Maud Menten]] worked in the US and Germany.  Her most famous work was on enzyme kinetics together with [[Leonor Michaelis]], based on earlier findings of [[Victor Henri]].  This resulted in the [[Michaelis–Menten kinetics|Michaelis–Menten]] equations. Menten also invented the azo-dye coupling reaction for [[alkaline phosphatase]], which is still used in histochemistry. She characterised bacterial toxins from ''B. paratyphosus'', ''Streptococcus scarlatina'' and ''[[Salmonella]] ssp.'', and conducted the first [[electrophoresis|electrophoretic]] separation of proteins in 1944. She worked on the properties of [[hemoglobin]], regulation of [[blood sugar]] level, and kidney function.

World War II brought some new opportunities. The [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]], under [[Vannevar Bush]], began in 1941 to keep a registry of men and women trained in the sciences. Because there was a shortage of workers, some women were able to work in jobs they might not otherwise have accessed. Many women worked on the [[Manhattan Project]] or on scientific projects for the United States military services. Women who worked on the Manhattan Project included [[Leona Woods]] Marshall, [[Katharine Way]], and [[Chien-Shiung Wu]].

Women in other disciplines looked for ways to apply their expertise to the war effort. Three nutritionists, [[Lydia Roberts|Lydia J. Roberts]], [[Hazel Stiebeling|Hazel K. Stiebeling]], and [[Helen S. Mitchell]], developed the [[Recommended Dietary Allowance]] in 1941 to help military and civilian groups make plans for group feeding situations. The RDAs proved necessary, especially, once foods began to be [[Rationing|rationed]]. [[Rachel Carson]] worked for the United States [[Bureau of Fisheries]], writing brochures to encourage Americans to consume a wider variety of fish and seafood. She also contributed to research to assist the Navy in developing techniques and equipment for submarine detection.

Women in psychology formed the [[National Council of Women Psychologists]], which organized projects related to the war effort. The NCWP elected [[Florence Laura Goodenough]] president. In the social sciences, several women contributed to the [[Japanese Evacuation and Resettlement Study]], based at the [[University of California]]. This study was led by sociologist [[Dorothy Swaine Thomas]], who directed the project and synthesized information from her informants, mostly graduate students in anthropology. These included [[Tamie Tsuchiyama]], the only [[Japanese American|Japanese-American]] woman to contribute to the study, and [[Rosalie Hankey Wax]].

In the [[United States Navy]], female scientists conducted a wide range of research. [[Mary Sears (oceanographer)|Mary Sears]], a [[Planktology|planktonologist]], researched military oceanographic techniques as head of the Hydgrographic Office's Oceanographic Unit. [[Florence van Straten]], a chemist, worked as an aerological engineer. She studied the effects of weather on military combat. [[Grace Hopper]], a mathematician, became one of the first [[computer programmers]] for the [[Harvard Mark I|Mark I]] computer. [[Mina Spiegel Rees]], also a mathematician, was the chief technical aide for the Applied Mathematics Panel of the [[National Defense Research Committee]].

[[Gerty Cori]] was a biochemist who discovered the mechanism by which glycogen, a derivative of glucose, is transformed in the muscles to form lactic acid, and is later reformed as a way to store energy. For this discovery she and her colleagues were awarded the Nobel prize in 1947, making her the third woman and the first American woman to win a Nobel Prize in science. She was the first woman ever to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Cori is among several scientists whose works are commemorated by a U.S. postage stamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Women Subjects on United States Postage Stamps |url=http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/women-stamp-subjects.pdf |page=6 |publisher=United States Postal Service |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nina Byers]] notes that before 1976, fundamental contributions of women to physics were rarely acknowledged. Women worked unpaid or in positions lacking the status they deserved. That imbalance is gradually being redressed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

In the early 1980s, Margaret Rossiter presented two concepts for understanding the statistics behind women in science as well as the disadvantages women continued to suffer. She coined the terms "hierarchical segregation" and "territorial segregation." The former term describes the phenomenon in which the further one goes up the chain of command in the field, the smaller the presence of women. The latter describes the phenomenon in which women "cluster in scientific disciplines."&lt;ref name=Schiebinger2001&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=Londa|title=Has Feminism Changed Science?|year=2001|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-674-00544-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|33–34}}

A recent book titled ''Athena Unbound'' provides a life-course analysis (based on interviews and surveys) of women in science from early childhood interest, through university, graduate school and the academic workplace. The thesis of this book is that "Women face a special series of gender related barriers to entry and success in scientific careers that persist, despite recent advances".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Etzkowitz|Kemelgor|Uzzi|2000|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[L'Oréal-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science]] were set up in 1998, with prizes alternating each year between the materials science and life sciences. One award is given for each geographical region of Africa and the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, and North America. By 2017, these awards had recognised almost 100 laureates from 30 countries.  Two of the laureates have gone on to win the Nobel Prize, [[Ada Yonath]] (2008) and [[Elizabeth Blackburn]] (2009). Fifteen promising young researchers also receive an International Rising Talent fellowship each year within this programme.

==Statistics==
{{globalize/US|section|date=April 2013}}

Statistics are used to indicate disadvantages faced by women in science, and also to track positive changes of employment opportunities and incomes for women in science.&lt;ref name=Schiebinger2001 /&gt;{{rp|33}}

=== Situation in the 1990s ===
Women appear to do less well than men (in terms of degree, rank, and salary) in the fields that have been traditionally dominated by women, such as [[nursing]]. In 1991 women attributed 91% of the [[PhD]]s in nursing, and men held 4% of full professorships in nursing{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}. In the field of [[psychology]], where women earn the majority of PhDs, women do not fill the majority of high rank positions in that field.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Women's lower salaries in the scientific community are also reflected in statistics. According to the data provided in 1993, the median salaries of female scientists and engineers with doctoral degrees were 20% less than men.&lt;ref name=Schiebinger2001 /&gt;{{rp|35}}{{Update inline|date=March 2016}} This data can be explained{{who|date=April 2013}} as there was less participation of women in high rank scientific fields/positions and a female majority in low-paid fields/positions. However, even with men and women in the same scientific community field, women are typically paid 15–17% less than men{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}. In addition to the [[gender pay gap|gender gap]], there were also salary differences between ethnicity: [[African-American]] women with more years of experiences earn 3.4% less than [[European-American]] women with similar skills, while Asian women engineers out-earn both Africans and Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;Schiebinger [2001], p. 37, citing {{Cite journal|publisher=NSF|title=Women, Minorities|date=1996|pages=72–74}}, {{Cite journal|author=Edward Silverman|title=New NSF Report on Salaries of Ph.D.'s Reveals Gender Gaps in All Categories|work=Scientist |issue=5|date= 19 August 1991|volume=20}} and {{Cite journal|author=Edward Silverman|title=NSF's Ph.D. Salary Survey Finds Minorities Earn Less than Whites|work=Scientist|issue=5 |date= 16 September 1991|volume=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=these figures are from the early 1990s|date=March 2016}}

Women are also under-represented in the sciences as compared to their numbers in the overall working population. Within 11% of African-American women in the workforce, 3% are employed as scientists and engineers.{{Clarify|3% of what? How is this relevant? I suspect this entire paragraph needs to be re-written or removed.|date=March 2016}} [[Hispanic]]s made up 8% of the total workers in the US, 3% of that number are scientists and engineers. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] participation cannot be statistically measured.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Women tend to earn less than men in almost all industries, including government and academia.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} Women are less likely to be hired in highest-paid positions{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}. The data showing the differences in salaries, ranks, and overall success between the genders is often claimed{{who|date=April 2013}} to be a result of women's lack of professional experience. The rate of women's professional achievement is increasing. In 1996, the salaries for women in professional fields increased from 85% to 95% relative to men with similar skills and jobs. Young women between the age of 27 and 33 earned 98%, nearly as much as their male peers.{{update inline|date=March 2016}} In the total workforce of the United States, women earn 74% as much as their male counterparts (in the 1970s they made 59% as much as their male counterparts).&lt;ref name=Schiebinger2001 /&gt;{{rp|33–37}}{{update inline|date=March 2016}}

Claudia Goldin, Harvard concludes in ''A Grand Gender Convergence: Its Last Chapter'' – "The gender gap in pay would be considerably reduced and might vanish altogether if firms did not have an incentive to disproportionately reward individuals who labored long hours and worked particular hours."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1257/aer.104.4.1091|title=A Grand Gender Convergence: Its Last Chapter†|journal=American Economic Review|volume=104|issue=4|pages=1091–1119|year=2014|last1=Goldin|first1=Claudia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on women's participation in the "hard" sciences such as [[physics]] and [[computer science]] speaks of the "leaky pipeline" model, in which the proportion of women "on track" to potentially becoming top scientists fall off at every step of the way, from getting interested in science and maths in elementary school, through doctorate, postdoctoral, and career steps.  The leaky pipeline also applies in other fields.  In [[biology]], for instance, women in the United States have been getting [[Master's degree|Masters]] degrees in the same numbers as men for two decades, yet fewer women get [[PhD]]s; and the numbers of women [[principal investigator]]s have not risen.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Luckenbill-Edds, "The 'Leaky Pipeline:' Has It Been Fixed?",''The American Society for Cell Biology'' 2000 WICB / Career Strategy Columns (1 November 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

What may be the cause of this "leaky pipeline" of women in the sciences?{{tone inline|date=March 2016}} It is important to look at factors outside of academia that are occurring in women's lives at the same time they are pursuing their continued education and career search.  The most outstanding factor that is occurring at this crucial time is family formation. As women are continuing their academic careers, they are also stepping into their new role as a wife and mother.  These traditionally require at large time commitment and presence outside work.  These new commitments do not fare well for the person looking to attain tenure. That is why women entering the family formation period of their life are 35% less likely to pursue tenure positions after receiving their PhD's than their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Staying Competitive|url = https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/report/2009/11/10/6979/staying-competitive/|website = name|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, women occupied over half the places in science-related higher education courses (science, medicine, maths, computer science and engineering) in 2004/5.&lt;ref name="HESA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hesa.ac.uk/holisdocs/pubinfo/student/subject0405.htm |title=Table 2e – All HE students by level of study, subject of study(#5), domicile and gender 2004/05 |date=9 March 2007

In the US, women with science or engineering doctoral degrees were predominantly employed in the education sector in 2001, with substantially fewer employed in business or industry than men.&lt;ref name="hahm"&gt;[http://www7.nationalacademies.org/cwse/S_E_stats.pdf Hahm, J-o.

The salary of a male engineer continues to experience growth as he gains experience whereas the female engineer sees her salary reach a plateau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|work=The Gender and Science Reader|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-21358-5|pages=16–17|author=Margaret A.

Women, in the United States and many European countries, who succeed in science tend to be graduates of single-sex schools.&lt;ref name=Schiebinger2001 /&gt;{{rp|at=Chapter 3}}{{update inline|date=March 2016}}  Women earn 54% of all bachelor's degrees in the United States and 50% of those are in science.  9% of US physicists are women.&lt;ref name=Schiebinger2001 /&gt;{{rp|at=Chapter 2}}{{Update inline|date=March 2016}}

===Overview of situation in 2013===
[[File:The leaky pipeline, share of women in higher education and research, 2013.svg|thumb|The leaky pipeline, share of women in higher education and research worldwide, 2013. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030, Figure 3.3, data from UNESCO Institute for Statistics.]]
In 2013, women accounted for 53% of the world's graduates at the bachelor's and master's level and 43% of successful PhD candidates but just 28% of researchers. Women graduates are consistently highly represented in the life sciences, often at over 50%. However, their representation in the other fields is inconsistent. In North America and much of Europe, few women graduate in physics, mathematics and computer science but, in other regions, the proportion of women may be close to parity in physics or mathematics. In engineering and computer sciences, women consistently trail men, a situation that is particularly acute in many high-income countries.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=Paris|pages=84–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women in decision-making ====
Each step up the ladder of the scientific research system sees a drop in female participation until, at the highest echelons of scientific research and decision-making, there are very few women left. In 2015, the EU Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation Carlos Moedas called attention to this phenomenon, adding that the majority of entrepreneurs in science and engineering tended to be men. In Germany, the coalition agreement signed in 2013 introduces a 30% quota for women on company boards of directors.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

Although data for most countries are limited, we know that women made up 14% of university chancellors and vice-chancellors at Brazilian public universities in 2010 and 17% of those in South Africa in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=National Assessments of Gender, Science, Technology and Innovation: Brazil|last=Abreu|first=A.|publisher=Women in Global Science and Technology and the Organization for Women in Science for the Developing World|year=2011|isbn=|location=Brighton  (Canada)|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Participation of Girls and Women in the National STI System in South Africa|last=|first=|publisher=Academy of Sciences of South Africa|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Argentina, women make up 16% of directors and vice-directors of national research centres and, in Mexico, 10% of directors of scientific research institutes at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=National Assessments of Gender, Science, Technology and Innovation: Argentina|last=Bonder|first=Gloria|publisher=Women in Global Science and Technology and the Organization for Women in Science for the Developing World|year=2015|isbn=|location=Brighton (Canada)|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Participation of Women and  Girls in National Education and the STI System in Mexico|last=Zubieta, J.|first=J.|last2=Herzig|first2=M.|publisher=Women in Global Science and Technology and the Organization for Women in Science for the Developing World|year=2015|isbn=|location=Brighton (Canada).|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, numbers are slightly higher at 23%. In the EU, less than 16% of tertiary institutions were headed by a woman in 2010 and just 10% of universities. At the main tertiary institution for the English-speaking Caribbean, the University of the West Indies, women represented 51% of lecturers but only 32% of senior lecturers and 26% of full professors in 2011. Two reviews of national academies of science produce similarly low numbers, with women accounting for more than 25% of members in only a handful of countries, including Cuba, Panama and South Africa. The figure for Indonesia was 17%.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=She Figures 2012: Gender in Research and Innovation|last=|first=|publisher=Directorate-General for Research and Innovation of the European Union|year=2013|isbn=|location=Brussels|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=National Assessments of Gender Equality in the Knowledge Society.

==== Women in life sciences ====
In life sciences, women researchers have achieved parity (45–55% of researchers) in many countries. In some, the balance even now tips in their favour. Six out of ten researchers are women in both medical and agricultural sciences in Belarus and New Zealand, for instance. More than two-thirds of researchers in medical sciences are women in El Salvador, Estonia, Kazakhstan, Latvia, the Philippines, Tajikistan, Ukraine and Venezuela.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

There has been a steady increase in female graduates in agricultural sciences since the turn of the century. In sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, numbers of female graduates in agricultural science have been increasing steadily, with eight countries reporting a share of women graduates of 40% or more: Lesotho, Madagascar, Mozambique, Namibia, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Swaziland and Zimbabwe. The reasons for this surge are unclear, although one explanation may lie in the growing emphasis on national food security and the food industry. Another possible explanation is that women are highly represented in biotechnology. For example, in South Africa, women were underrepresented in engineering (16%) in 2004 and in ‘natural scientific professions’ (16%) in 2006 but made up 52% of employees working in biotechnology-related companies.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

Women play an increasing role in environmental sciences and conservation biology. In fact women played a foremost role in the development of these disciplines. [[Silent Spring]] by Rachel Carson proved an important impetus to the conservation movement and the later banning of chemical pesticides. Women played an important role in conservation biology including the famous work of Dian Fossey, who published the famous [[Gorillas in the Mist]] and [[Jane Goodall]] who studied primates in East Africa. Today women make up an increasing proportion of roles in the active conservation sector. A recent survey of those working in the Wildlife Trusts in the U.K., the leading conservation organisation in England, found that there are nearly as many women as men in practical conservation roles.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, M. D. 2017. Gender equality in the wildlife trusts. ECOS. 38(6) https://www.academia.edu/35875487/Gender_equality_in_the_Wildlife_Trusts&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women in engineering and related fields ====
Women are consistently underrepresented in engineering and related fields. In Israel, for instance, where 28% of senior academic staff are women, there are proportionately many fewer in engineering (14%), physical sciences (11%), mathematics and computer sciences (10%) but dominate education (52%) and paramedical occupations (63%). In Japan and the Republic of Korea, women represent just 5% and 10% of engineers.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

In Europe and North America, the number of female graduates in engineering, physics, mathematics and computer science is generally low. Women make up just 19% of engineers in Canada, Germany and the US and 22% in Finland, for example. However,  50% of engineering graduates are women in Cyprus, 38% in Denmark and 36% in the Russian Federation, for instance.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

In many cases, engineering has lost ground to other sciences, including agriculture. The case of New Zealand is fairly typical. Here, women jumped from representing 39% to 70% of agricultural graduates between 2000 and 2012, continued to dominate health (80–78%) but ceded ground in science (43–39%) and engineering (33–27%).&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

In a number of developing countries, there is a sizable proportion of women engineers. At least three out of ten engineers are women, for instance, in Costa Rica, Vietnam and the United Arab Emirates (31%), Algeria (32%), Mozambique (34%), Tunisia (41%) and Brunei Darussalam (42%). In Malaysia (50%)  and Oman (53%), women are on a par with men. Of the 13 sub-Saharan countries reporting data, seven have observed substantial increases (more than 5%) in women engineers since 2000, namely: Benin, Burundi, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Mozambique and Namibia.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

Of the seven Arab countries reporting data, four observe a steady percentage or an increase in female engineers (Morocco, Oman, Palestine and Saudi Arabia). In the United Arab Emirates, the government has made it a priority to develop a knowledge economy, having recognized the need for a strong human resource base in science, technology and engineering. With just 1% of the labour force being Emirati, it is also concerned about the low percentage of Emirati citizens employed in key industries. As a result, it has introduced policies promoting the training and employment of Emirati citizens, as well as a greater participation of Emirati women in the labour force. Emirati female engineering students have said that they are attracted to a career in engineering for reasons of financial independence, the high social status associated with this field, the opportunity to engage in creative and challenging projects and the wide range of career opportunities.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

An analysis of computer science shows a steady decrease in female graduates since 2000 that is particularly marked in high-income countries. Between 2000 and 2012, the share of women graduates in computer science slipped in Australia, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea and USA. In Latin America and the Caribbean, the share of women graduates in computer science dropped by between 2 and 13 percentage points over this period for all countries reporting data.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

There are exceptions. In Denmark, the proportion of female graduates in computer science increased from 15% to 24% between 2000 and 2012 and Germany saw an increase from 10% to 17%. These are still very low levels. Figures are higher in many emerging economies. In Turkey, for instance, the proportion of women graduating in computer science rose from a relatively high 29% to 33% between 2000 and 2012.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

The Malaysian information technology (IT) sector is made up equally of women and men, with large numbers of women employed as university professors and in the private sector. This is a product of two historical trends: the predominance of women in the Malay electronics industry, the precursor to the IT industry, and the national push to achieve a ‘pan-Malayan’ culture beyond the three ethnic groups of Indian, Chinese and Malay. Government support for the education of all three groups is available on a quota basis and, since few Malay men are interested in IT, this leaves more room for women. Additionally, families tend to be supportive of their daughters’ entry into this prestigious and highly remunerated industry, in the interests of upward social mobility. Malaysia's push to develop an [[Innovation in Malaysia|endogenous research culture]] should deepen this trend.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

In India, the substantial increase in women undergraduates in engineering may be indicative of a change in the ‘masculine’ perception of engineering in the country. It is also a product of interest on the part of parents, since their daughters will be assured of employment as the field expands, as well as an advantageous marriage. Other factors include the ‘friendly’ image of engineering in India and the easy access to engineering education resulting from the increase in the number of women's engineering colleges over the last two decades.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

=== Regional trends as of 2013 ===
The global figures mask wide disparities from one region to another. In Southeast Europe, for instance, women researchers have obtained parity and, at 44%, are on the verge of doing so in Central Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean. In the European Union, on the other hand, just one in three (33%) researchers is a woman, compared to 37% in the Arab world. Women are also better represented in sub-Saharan Africa (30%) than in South Asia (17%).&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

There are also wide intraregional disparities. Women make up 52% of researchers in the Philippines and Thailand, for instance, and are close to parity in Malaysia and Vietnam, yet only one in three researchers is a woman in Indonesia and Singapore. In Japan and the Republic of Korea, two countries characterized by high researcher densities and technological sophistication, as few as 15% and 18% of researchers respectively are women. These are the lowest ratios among members of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]. The Republic of Korea also has the widest gap among OECD members in remuneration between men and women researchers (39%). There is also a yawning gap in Japan (29%).&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

==== Latin America and the Caribbean ====
Latin America has some of the world's highest rates of women studying scientific fields; it also shares with the Caribbean one of the highest proportions of female researchers: 44%. Of the 12 countries reporting data for the years 2010–2013, seven have achieved gender parity, or even dominate research: Bolivia (63%), Venezuela (56%), Argentina (53%), Paraguay (52%), Uruguay (49%), Brazil (48%) and Guatemala (45%). Costa Rica is on the cusp (43%). Chile has the lowest score among countries for which there are recent data (31%). The Caribbean paints a similar picture, with Cuba having achieved gender parity (47%) and Trinidad and Tobago on 44%. Recent data on women's participation in industrial research are available for those countries with the most developed national innovation systems, with the exception of Brazil and Cuba: Uruguay (47%), Argentina (29%), Colombia and Chile (26%).&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

As in most other regions, the great majority of health graduates are women (60–85%). Women are also strongly represented in science. More than 40% of science graduates are women in each of Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Panama and Uruguay. The Caribbean paints a similar picture, with women graduates in science being on a par with men or dominating this field in Barbados, Cuba, Dominican Republic and Trinidad and Tobago.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

In engineering, women make up over 30% of the graduate population in seven Latin American countries (Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Honduras, Panama and Uruguay) and one Caribbean country, the Dominican Republic. There has been a decrease in the number of women engineering graduates in Argentina, Chile and Honduras.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

The participation of women in science has consistently dropped since the turn of the century. This trend has been observed in all sectors of the larger economies: Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Colombia. Mexico is a notable exception, having recorded a slight increase. Some of the decrease may be attributed to women transferring to agricultural sciences in these countries. Another negative trend is the drop in female doctoral students and in the labour force. Of those countries reporting data, the majority signal a significant drop of 10–20 percentage points in the transition from master's to doctoral graduates.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

==== Eastern Europe, West and Central Asia ====
Most countries in Eastern Europe, West and Central Asia have attained gender parity in research (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Ukraine) or are on the brink of doing so (Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan). This trend is reflected in tertiary education, with some exceptions in engineering and computer science. Although Belarus and the Russian Federation have seen a drop over the past decade, women still represented 41% of researchers in 2013. In the former Soviet states, women are also very present in the business enterprise sector: Bosnia and Herzegovina (59%), Azerbaijan (57%), Kazakhstan (50%), Mongolia (48%), Latvia (48%), Serbia (46%), Croatia and Bulgaria (43%), Ukraine and Uzbekistan (40%), Romania and Montenegro (38%), Belarus (37%), Russian Federation (37%).&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

One in three researchers is a woman in Turkey (36%) and Tajikistan (34%). Participation rates are lower in Iran (26%) and Israel (21%), although Israeli women represent 28% of senior academic staff. At university, Israeli women dominate medical sciences (63%) but only a minority study engineering (14%), physical sciences (11%), mathematics and computer science (10%). There has been an interesting evolution in Iran. Whereas the share of female PhD graduates in health remained stable at 38–39% between 2007 and 2012, it rose in all three other broad fields. Most spectacular was the leap in female PhD graduates in agricultural sciences from 4% to 33% but there was also a marked progression in science (from 28% to 39%) and engineering (from 8% to 16%).&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

==== Southeast Europe ====
With the exception of Greece, all the countries of Southeast Europe were once part of the Soviet bloc. Some 49% of researchers in these countries are women (compared to 37% in Greece in 2011). This high proportion is considered a legacy of the consistent investment in education by the Socialist governments in place until the early 1990s, including that of the former Yugoslavia. Moreover, the participation of female researchers is holding steady or increasing in much of the region, with representation broadly even across the four sectors of government, business, higher education and non-profit. In most countries, women tend to be on a par with men among tertiary graduates in science. Between 70% and 85% of graduates are women in health, less than 40% in agriculture and between 20% and 30% in engineering. Albania has seen a considerable increase in the share of its women graduates in engineering and agriculture.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

==== European Union ====
Women make up 33% of researchers overall in the European Union (EU), slightly more than their representation in science (32%). Women constitute 40% of researchers in higher education, 40% in government and 19% in the private sector, with the number of female researchers increasing faster than that of male researchers. The proportion of female researchers has been increasing over the last decade, at a faster rate than men (5.1% annually over 2002–2009 compared with 3.3% for men), which is also true for their participation among scientists and engineers (up 5.4% annually between 2002 and 2010, compared with 3.1% for men).&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

Despite these gains, women's academic careers in Europe remain characterized by strong vertical and horizontal segregation. In 2010, although female students (55%) and graduates (59%) outnumbered male students, men outnumbered women at the PhD and graduate levels (albeit by a small margin). Further along in the research career, women represented 44% of grade C academic staff, 37% of grade B academic staff and 20% of grade A academic staff.11 These trends are intensified in science, with women making up 31% of the student population at the tertiary level to 38% of PhD students and 35% of PhD graduates. At the faculty level, they make up 32% of academic grade C personnel, 23% of grade B and 11% of grade A. The proportion of women among full professors is lowest in engineering and technology, at 7.9%. With respect to representation in science decision-making, in 2010 15.5% of higher education institutions were headed by women and 10% of universities had a female rector.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

Membership on science boards remained predominantly male as well, with women making up 36% of board members. The EU has engaged in a major effort to integrate female researchers and gender research into its research and innovation strategy since the mid-2000s. Increases in women's representation in all of the scientific fields overall indicates that this effort has met with some success; however, the continued lack of representation of women at the top level of faculties, management and science decision making indicate that more work needs to be done. The EU is addressing this through a gender equality strategy and crosscutting mandate in [[Horizon 2020]], its research and innovation funding programme for 2014–2020.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

==== Australia, New Zealand and USA ====
In 2013, women made up the majority of PhD graduates in fields related to health in Australia (63%), New Zealand (58%) and the United States of America (73%). The same can be said of agriculture, in New Zealand's case (73%). Women have also achieved parity in agriculture in Australia (50%) and the United States (44%). Just one in five women graduate in engineering in the latter two countries, a situation that has not changed over the past decade. In New Zealand, women jumped from constituting 39% to 70% of agricultural graduates (all levels) between 2000 and 2012 but ceded ground in science (43–39%), engineering (33–27%) and health (80–78%). As for Canada, it has not reported sex-disaggregated data for women graduates in science and engineering in recent years. Moreover, none of the four countries mentioned here have reported recent data on the share of female researchers.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

==== South Asia ====
South Asia is the region where women make up the smallest proportion of researchers: 17%. This is 13 percentage points below sub-Saharan Africa. Of those countries in South Asia reporting data for 2009–2013, Nepal has the lowest representation of all (in head counts), at 8% (2010), a substantial drop from 15% in 2002. In 2013, only 14% of researchers (in full-time equivalents) were women in the region's most populous country, India, down slightly from 15% in 2009. The percentage of female researchers is highest in Sri Lanka (39%), followed by Pakistan: 24% in 2009, 31% in 2013. There are no recent data available for Afghanistan or Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

[[File:Share of women among researchers employed in the business enterprise sector, 2013 or closest year.svg|thumb|Share of women among researchers employed in the business enterprise sector, 2013 or closest year. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030, Figure 3.4, data from UNESCO Institute for Statistics.]]

Women are most present in the private non-profit sector – they make up 60% of employees in Sri Lanka – followed by the academic sector: 30% of Pakistani and 42% of Sri Lankan female researchers. Women tend to be less present in the government sector and least likely to be employed in the business sector, accounting for 23% of employees in Sri Lanka, 11% in India and just 5% in Nepal. Women have achieved parity in science in both Sri Lanka and Bangladesh but are less likely to undertake research in engineering. They represent 17% of the research pool in Bangladesh and 29% in Sri Lanka. Many Sri Lankan women have followed the global trend of opting for a career in agricultural sciences (54%) and they have also achieved parity in health and welfare. In Bangladesh, just over 30% choose agricultural sciences and health, which goes against the global trend. Although Bangladesh still has progress to make, the share of women in each scientific field has increased steadily over the past decade.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

==== Southeast Asia ====
Southeast Asia presents a different picture entirely, with women basically on a par with men in some countries: they make up 52% of researchers in the Philippines and Thailand, for example. Other countries are close to parity, such as Malaysia and Vietnam, whereas Indonesia and Singapore are still around the 30% mark. Cambodia trails its neighbours at 20%. Female researchers in the region are spread fairly equally across the sectors of participation, with the exception of the private sector, where they make up 30% or less of researchers in most countries.

The proportion of women tertiary graduates reflects these trends, with high percentages of women in science in Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, Myanmar and the Philippines (around 60%) and a low of 10% in Cambodia. Women make up the majority of graduates in health sciences, from 60% in Laos to 81% in Myanmar – Vietnam being an exception at 42%. Women graduates are on a par with men in agriculture but less present in engineering: Vietnam (31%), the Philippines (30%) and Malaysia (39%); here, the exception is Myanmar, at 65%. In the Republic of Korea, women make up about 40% of graduates in science and agriculture and 71% of graduates in health sciences but only 18% of female researchers overall. This represents a loss in the investment made in educating girls and women up through tertiary education, a result of traditionalviews of women's role in society and in the home. Kim and Moon (2011) remark on the tendency of Korean women to withdraw from the labour force to take care of children and assume family responsibilities, calling it a ‘domestic brain drain’.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

Women remain very much a minority in Japanese science (15% in 2013), although the situation has improved slightly (13% in 2008) since the government fixed a target in 2006 of raising the ratio of female researchers to 25%. Calculated on the basis of the current number of doctoral students, the government hopes to obtain a 20% share of women in science, 15% in engineering and 30% in agriculture and health by the end of the current ''Basic Plan for Science and Technology'' in 2016. In 2013, Japanese female researchers were most common in the public sector in health and agriculture, where they represented 29% of academics and 20% of government researchers. In the business sector, just 8% of researchers were women (in head counts), compared to 25% in the academic sector. In other public research institutions, women accounted for 16% of researchers. One of the main thrusts of [[Abenomics]], Japan's current growth strategy, is to enhance the socio-economic role of women. Consequently, the selection criteria for most large university grants now take into account the proportion of women among teaching staff and researchers.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

The low ratio of women researchers in Japan and the Republic of Korea, which both have some of the highest researcher densities in the world, brings down Southeast Asia's average to 22.5% for the share of women among researchers in the region.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

==== Arab States ====
At 37%, the share of female researchers in the Arab States compares well with other regions. The countries with the highest proportion of female researchers are Bahrain and Sudan at around 40%. Jordan, Libya, Oman, Palestine and Qatar have percentage shares in the low twenties. The country with the lowest participation of female researchers is Saudi Arabia, even though they make up the majority of tertiary graduates, but the figure of 1.4% covers only the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology. Female researchers in the region are primarily employed in government research institutes, with some countries also seeing a high participation of women in private nonprofit organizations and universities. With the exception of Sudan (40%) and Palestine (35%), fewer than one in four researchers in the business enterprise sector is a woman; for half of the countries reporting data, there are barely any women at all employed in this sector.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

Despite these variable numbers, the percentage of female tertiary-level graduates in science and engineering is very high across the region, which indicates there is a substantial drop between graduation and employment and research. Women make up half or more than half of science graduates in all but Sudan and over 45% in agriculture in eight out of the 15 countries reporting data, namely Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates. In engineering, women make up over 70% of graduates in Oman, with rates of 25–38% in the majority of the other countries, which is high in comparison to other regions.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

The participation of women is somewhat lower in health than in other regions, possibly on account of cultural norms restricting interactions between males and females. Iraq and Oman have the lowest percentages (mid-30s), whereas Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Palestine and Saudi Arabia are at gender parity in this field. The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have the highest rates of all: 83% and 84%.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

Once Arab women scientists and engineers graduate, they may come up against barriers to finding gainful employment. These include a misalignment between university programmes and labour market demand – a phenomenon which also affects men –, a lack of awareness about what a career in their chosen field entails, family bias against working in mixed-gender environments and a lack of female role models.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Samulewicz|first=D.|last2=Vidican|first2=G. and N. G. Aswad|year=2012|title=Barriers to pursuing careers in science, technology and engineering for women in the United Arab Emirates .|url=|journal=[[Gender, Technology and Development]]|volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=125–52|via=|doi=10.1177/097185241201600201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the countries with the smallest female labour force is developing technical and vocational education for girls as part of a wider scheme to reduce dependence on foreign labour. By 2017, the Technical and Vocational Training Corporation of Saudi Arabia is to have constructed 50 technical colleges, 50 girls’ higher technical institutes and 180 industrial secondary institutes. The plan is to create training placements for about 500 000 students, half of them girls. Boys and girls will be trained in vocational professions that include information technology, medical equipment handling, plumbing, electricity and mechanics.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

==== Sub-Saharan Africa ====
Just under one in three (30%) researchers in sub-Saharan Africa is a woman. Much of sub-Saharan Africa is seeing solid gains in the share of women among tertiary graduates in scientific fields. In two of the top four countries for women's representation in science, women graduates are part of very small cohorts, however: they make up 54% of Lesotho's 47 tertiary graduates in science and 60% of those in Namibia's graduating class of 149. South Africa and Zimbabwe, which have larger graduate populations in science, have achieved parity, with 49% and 47% respectively. The next grouping clusters seven countries poised at around 35–40% (Angola, Burundi, Eritrea, Liberia, Madagascar, Mozambique and Rwanda). The rest are grouped around 30% or below (Benin, Ethiopia, Ghana, Swaziland and Uganda). Burkina Faso ranks lowest, with women making up 18% of its science graduates.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

Female representation in engineering is fairly high in sub-Saharan Africa in comparison with other regions. In Mozambique and South Africa, for instance, women make up more than 34% and 28% of engineering graduates, respectively. Numbers of female graduates in agricultural science have been increasing steadily across the continent, with eight countries reporting the share of women graduates of 40% or more (Lesotho, Madagascar, Mozambique, Namibia, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Swaziland and Zimbabwe). In health, this rate ranges from 26% and 27% in Benin and Eritrea to 94% in Namibia.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

Of note is that women account for a relatively high proportion of researchers employed in the business enterprise sector in South Africa (35%), Kenya (34%), [[Science and technology in Botswana|Botswana]] and Namibia (33%) and Zambia (31%). Female participation in industrial research is lower in Uganda (21%), Ethiopia (15%) and Mali (12%).&lt;ref name="UNESCO 2015" /&gt;

== Lack of agency and representation of women in science ==

=== Social pressures that repress femininity ===
Beginning in the late twentieth century{{Original research inline|date=March 2016}} to present day, more and more women are becoming involved in science. However, women often find themselves at odds with expectations held towards them in relation to their scientific studies. For example, in 1968 James Watson questioned scientist Rosalind Franklin's place in the industry. He claimed that "the best place for a feminist was in another person's lab",&lt;ref name=Schiebinger2001 /&gt;{{rp|76–77}} most often a male's research lab.{{Synthesis inline|date=March 2016}} Women were and still are often critiqued of their overall presentation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} In Franklin's situation, she was seen as lacking femininity for she failed to wear lipstick or revealing clothing.&lt;ref name=Schiebinger2001 /&gt;{{rp|76–77}} Women believed that in order to gain recognition, they needed to hide their feminine qualities, to thus appear more masculine.  For example, women in the sixties often wore male clothing, which often did not fit for the pant's inseam was sized for a man and not a woman's leg. This conformity had little benefit besides men demoralizing them for lack of femininity.

Since most of their colleagues in science are men, women also find themselves left out of opportunities to discuss possible research opportunities outside of the laboratory. In Londa Scheibinger's book, ''Has Feminism Changed Science?'', she mentions that men would have discussed their research outside of the lab, but this conversation is preceded by talk of sports or other “masculine” topics that excluded women from the conversation.&lt;ref name="Schiebinger2001" /&gt;{{rp|81–91}} Consequently, this act of excluding women from the after-hours work discussions produced a more separate work environment between the men and the women in science; as women then would converse with other women in science about their current findings and theories. Ultimately, the women's work was devalued as a male scientist was not involved in the overall research and analysis.

According to Oxford University Press, the inequality toward women is “endorsed within cultures and entrenched within institutions [that] hold power to reproduce that inequality”.&lt;ref name="Cech 371–397"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cech|first=Erin A.|last2=Blair-Loy|first2=Mary|date=2010-01-01|title=Perceiving Glass Ceilings? Meritocratic versus Structural Explanations of Gender Inequality among Women in Science and Technology|jstor=10.1525/sp.2010.57.3.371|journal=Social Problems|volume=57|issue=3|pages=371–397|doi=10.1525/sp.2010.57.3.371}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various gendered barriers in social networks that prevent women from working in male-dominated fields and top management jobs. Social networks are based on the cultural beliefs such as schemas and stereotypes.&lt;ref name="Cech 371–397" /&gt; According to social psychology studies, top management jobs are more likely to have incumbent schemas that favor “an achievement-oriented aggressiveness and emotional toughness that is distinctly male in character”.&lt;ref name="Cech 371–397" /&gt; Gender stereotypes of feminine style set by men assume women to be conforming and submissive to male culture creating a sense of unqualified women for top management jobs. However, when the women try to prove their competence and power, they often faced obstacles. They are likely to be seen as dislikable and untrustworthy even when they excel at “masculine” tasks.&lt;ref name="Cech 371–397"/&gt; In addition, women's achievements are likely to be dismissed or discredited.&lt;ref name="Cech 371–397" /&gt; These “untrustworthy, dislikable women” could have very well been denied achievement from the fear men held of a woman overtaking his management position. Social networks and gender stereotypes produce many injustices that women have to experience in their workplace, as well as, the various obstacles they encounter when trying to advance in male-dominated and top management jobs. Women in professions like science, technology, and other related industries are likely to encounter these gendered barriers in their careers.&lt;ref name="Cech 371–397" /&gt; Based on the meritocratic explanations of gender inequality, “as long as the people accept the mechanisms that produce unequal outcomes,” all the outcomes will be legitimated in the society.&lt;ref name="Cech 371–397" /&gt; When women try to deny the stereotypes and the discriminations by becoming “competent, integrated, well-liked”, the society is more likely to look at these impressions as selfishness or “being a whiner”.&lt;ref name="Cech 371–397" /&gt; However, there have been positive attempts to reduce gender discrimination in the public domain. For example, in the United States, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 provides opportunities for women to achieve to a wide range of education programs and activities by prohibiting sex discrimination.&lt;ref name="aauw.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aauw.org|title=AAUW: Empowering Women Since 1881|website=AAUW: Empowering Women Since 1881|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law states "No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under any educational program or activity receiving federal financial assistance."&lt;ref name="aauw.org" /&gt; Although, even with laws prohibiting gender discrimination, society and social institutions continue to minimize women's competencies and accomplishments, especially, in the workforce by dismissing or discrediting their achievements as stated above.

===Underrepresentation of queer women in STEM fields===
Cisgender heterosexual women are underrepresented in STEM fields and there has been a push to encourage more women to join the sciences.&lt;ref name="bu.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/research/articles/lgbt-issues-stem-diversity/|title=Is Science Too Straight?|last=Moran|first=Barbara|date=2015-06-17|website=Research|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the lack of data and statistics of LGBTQ members involvement in the STEM field, it illustrates that lesbian, bisexual, and transgender women are even more repressed and underrepresented than their straight female peers.&lt;ref name="bu.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/05/opinion/manil-suri-why-is-science-so-straight.html|title=Why Is Science So Straight?|last=Suri|first=Manil|date=2015-09-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-08|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bu.edu" /&gt; Reasons for underrepresentation of queer women in STEM fields include lack of role models in K–12,&lt;ref name="bu.edu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Unsay|first=Joseph D.|date=2017-03-27|title=Where are all the LGBT scientists?

==Reasons to why women are disadvantaged in science==
[[Margaret W. Rossiter|Margaret Rossiter]], an American historian of science, offered three concepts to explain the reasons behind the data in statistics and how these reasons disadvantaged women in the science industry. The first concept is hierarchical segregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2002|title=Science And Women|encyclopedia=Women's Studies Encyclopedia|url=http://gem.greenwood.com/wse/wseDisplay.jsp?id=id586&amp;ss=aristotle|accessdate=9 November 2013|last=Tierney|first=Helen}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a well-known phenomenon in society, that the higher the level and rank of power and prestige, the smaller the population of females participating. The hierarchical differences point out that there are fewer women participating at higher levels of both academia and industry. Based on data collected in 1982, women earn 54 percent of all bachelor's degrees in the United States, with 50 percent of these in science. The source also indicated that this number increased almost every year.&lt;ref&gt;Hahm, J-o. Data on Women in S&amp;E. From: Women, Minorities and Persons With Disabilities in Science and Engineering, NSF 2004&lt;/ref&gt; There are fewer women at the graduate level; they earn 40 percent of all doctorates, with 31 percent of these in science and engineering.

The second concept included in Rossiter's explanation of women in science is [[Gender segregation|territorial segregation]].&lt;ref name=Schiebinger2001 /&gt;{{rp|34–35}} The term refers to how female employment is often clustered in specific industries or categories in industries. Women stayed at home or took employment in feminine fields while men left the home to work. Although nearly half of the civilian work force is female, women still comprise the majority of low-paid jobs or jobs that society considered feminine. Statistics show that 60 percent of white professional women are nurses, daycare workers, or schoolteachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.nationalacademies.org/xpedio/groups/pgasite/documents/webpage/pga_049211.pdf|title=Science and Engineering Indicators 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Territorial disparities in science are often found between the 1920s and 1930s, when different fields in science were divided between men and women. Men dominated the chemistry, medical sciences, and engineering, while women dominated the fields of botany, zoology, and psychology. The fields in which the majority of women are concentrated are known as the "soft" sciences and tend to have relatively low salaries.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Researchers collected the data on many differences between women and men in science. Rossiter found that in 1966, thirty-eight percent of female scientists held master's degrees compared to twenty-six percent of male scientists; but large proportions of female scientists were in environmental and nonprofit organizations.&lt;ref name="Science Reader 2001"&gt;The Gender and Science Reader, edited by Muriel Lederman And Ingrid Bartsch, section one, Eisenhart and Elizabeth Finkel, 2001, first published by Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1960s and 1970s, equal-rights legislation made the number of female scientists rise dramatically. The statistics from [[National Science Board]] (NSB) present the change at that time.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} The number of science degrees awarded to woman rose from seven percent in 1970 to twenty-four percent in 1985. In 1975 only 385 women received bachelor's degrees in engineering compared to 11,000 women in 1985, indicating the importance of legislation to the representation of women in science.{{Synthesis inline|date=March 2016}} Elizabeth Finkel claims that even if the number of women participating in scientific fields increases, the opportunities are still limited.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Jabos, who worked for NSB, reported the pattern of women in receiving doctoral degrees in science: even though the numbers of female scientists with higher-level degrees increased, they still were consistently in a minority.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Another reporter, Harriet Zuckerman, claims that when woman and man have similar abilities for a job, the probability of the woman getting the job is lower.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Elizabeth Finkel agrees, saying, "In general, while woman and men seem to be completing doctorate with similar credentials and experience, the opposition and rewards they find are not comparable. Women tend to be treated with less salary and status, many policy makers notice this phenomenon and try to rectify the unfair situation for women participating in scientific fields."&lt;ref name="Science Reader 2001" /&gt;

==Contemporary advocacy and developments of women in science==

===Efforts to increase participation===
A number of organizations have been set up to combat the stereotyping that may encourage girls away from careers in these areas.  In the UK [[The WISE Campaign]] (Women into Science, Engineering and Construction) and the [[UKRC]] (The UK Resource Centre for Women in SET) are collaborating to ensure industry, academia and education are all aware of the importance of challenging the traditional approaches to careers advice and recruitment that mean some of the best brains in the country are lost to science.  The [[UKRC]] and other women's networks provide female role models, resources and support for activities that promote science to girls and women. The [[Women's Engineering Society]], a professional association in th UK, has been supporting women in engineering and science since 1919.  In computing, the [[British Computer Society]] group [[BCSWomen]] is active in encouraging girls to consider computing careers, and in supporting women in the computing workforce.

In the United States, the [[Association for Women in Science]] is one of the most prominent organization for professional women in science.  In 2011, the [[Scientista Foundation]] was created to empower pre-professional college and graduate women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), to stay in the career track.  There are also several organizations focused on increasing mentorship from a younger age. One of the best known groups is [[Science Club for Girls]], which pairs undergraduate mentors with high school and middle school mentees. The model of that pairs undergraduate college mentors with younger students is quite popular. In addition, many young women are creating programs to boost participation in STEM at a younger level, either through conferences or competitions.

In efforts to make women scientists more visible to the general public, the [[Grolier Club]] in [[New York City|New York]] hosted a "landmark exhibition" titled "Extraordinary Women in Science &amp; Medicine: Four Centuries of Achievement", showcasing the lives and works of 32 women scientists in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=65321|title=Landmark exhibition recognizes the achievements of women in science and medicine at The Grolier Club|date=2013-12-22|work=artdaily.org|accessdate=2013-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) developed a video series highlighting the stories of female researchers at NIOSH.&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/women/2013-wis/|title=CDC – Women's Safety and Health Issues at Work – NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic – Science Speaks: A Focus on NIOSH Women in Science|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of the women featured in the videos share their journey into science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM), and offers encouragement to aspiring scientists.&lt;ref name="cdc.gov" /&gt;  NIOSH also partners with external organizations in efforts to introduce individuals to scientific disciplines and funds several science-based training programs across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/oep/trainresearch.html|title=CDC – NIOSH Grants and Funding – Extramural Research and Training Programs – Research and Training|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/training/default.html|title=CDC – NIOSH Training and Workforce Development|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women scientists in the media ====
In 2013, journalist [[Christie Aschwanden]] noted that a type of media coverage of women scientists that "treats its subject's sex as her most defining detail" was still prevalent. She proposed a checklist, the "[[Finkbeiner test]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.doublexscience.org/the-finkbeiner-test/|title=The Finkbeiner Test: What matters in stories about women scientists?|last=Aschwanden|first=Christie|date=5 March 2013|newspaper=Double X Science|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help avoid this approach.&lt;ref name="CJR 22 March 2013"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cjr.org/the_observatory/finkbeiner_test_gender_gap_fem.php?page=all|title=‘The Finkbeiner Test’ Seven rules to avoid gratuitous gender profiles of female scientists|last=Brainard|first=Curtis|date=22 March 2013|newspaper=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was cited in the coverage of a much-criticized 2013 ''New York Times'' obituary of rocket scientist [[Yvonne Brill]] that began with the words: "She made a mean beef stroganoff".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://io9.com/the-new-york-times-fails-miserably-in-its-obituary-for-464140204|title=The New York Times fails miserably in its obituary for rocket scientist Yvonne Brill|last=Gonzalez|first=Robert T.|date=31 March 2013|newspaper=[[io9]]|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable controversies and developments===
A study conducted at [[Lund University]] in 2010 and 2011 analysed the genders of invited contributors to ''News &amp; Views'' in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''Perspectives'' in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.  It found that 3.8% of the Earth and environmental science contributions to ''News &amp; Views'' were written by women even while the field was estimated to be 16–20% female in the United States.  ''Nature'' responded by suggesting that, worldwide, a significantly lower number of Earth scientists were women, but nevertheless committed to address any disparity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencenordic.com/gender-bias-leading-journals|title=Gender bias in leading journals|last=Nordahl|first=Marianne|date=2012-09-08|publisher=Science Nordic|accessdate=2015-10-27|quote=should we find that the News &amp; Views section is indeed under-representing women, we will certainly take steps to redress the balance.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a journal article published in ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' (PNAS) reported a gender bias among science faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moss-Racusin|first=Corinne A.|author2=John F. Dovidiob|author3=Victoria L. Brescollc|author4=Mark J. Grahama|author5=Jo Handelsman|date=August 2012|title=Science faculty's subtle gender biases favor male students|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/09/14/1211286109|journal=PNAS|volume=109|issue=41|pages=16395–16396|bibcode=2012PNAS..10916474M|doi=10.1073/pnas.1211286109|pmc=3478626|pmid=22988126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Faculty were asked to review a resume from a hypothetical student and report how likely they would be to hire or mentor that student, as well as what they would offer as starting salary.  Two resumes were distributed randomly to the faculty, only differing in the names at the top of the resume (John or Jennifer).  The male student was rated as significantly more competent, more likely to be hired, and more likely to be mentored.  The median starting salary offered to the male student was greater than $3,000 over the starting salary offered to the female student.  Both male and female faculty exhibited this gender bias.  This study suggests bias may partly explain the persistent deficit in the number of women at the highest levels of scientific fields.  Another study reported that men are favored in some domains, such as biology tenure rates, but that the majority of domains were gender-fair; the authors interpreted this to suggest that the under-representation of women in the professorial ranks was not solely caused by sexist hiring, promotion, and remuneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ceci|first1=S.

In 2014, a [[Shirtstorm|controversy]] over the depiction of pinup women on [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta]] project scientist Matt Taylor's shirt during a press conference raised questions of sexism within the European Space Agency.&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/nov/13/why-women-in-science-are-annoyed-at-rosetta-mission-scientists-clothing|title=Why women in science are annoyed at Rosetta mission scientist's clothing|last1=Bell|first1=Alice|date=13 November 2014|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shirt, which featured cartoon women with firearms, led to an outpouring of criticism and an apology after which Taylor "broke down in tears."&lt;ref name="The Independent 2014-11-30" /&gt;

In 2015, stereotypes about women in science were directed at Fiona Ingleby, research fellow in evolution, behavior, and environment at the [[University of Sussex]], and Megan Head, postdoctoral researcher at the [[Australian National University]], when they submitted a paper analyzing the progression of PhD graduates to postdoctoral positions in the life sciences to the journal ''[[PLOS ONE]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Elsei, Holly.  ″′Sexist′ peer review causes storm online.″  ''Times Higher Education'' 30 April 2015: Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors received an email on March 27 informing them that their paper had been rejected due to its poor quality.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;  The email included comments from an anonymous reviewer, which included the suggestion that male authors be added in order to improve the quality of the science and serve as a means of ensuring that incorrect interpretations of the data are not included.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;  Ingleby posted excerpts from the email on [[Twitter]] on April 29 bringing the incident to the attention of the public and media.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;  The editor was dismissed from the journal and the reviewer was removed from the list of potential reviewers.  A spokesman from PLOS apologized to the authors and said they would be given the opportunity to have the paper reviewed again.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

On June 9, 2015, Nobel prize winning biochemist [[Tim Hunt]] spoke at the World Conference of Science Journalists in [[Seoul]].  Prior to applauding the work of women scientists, he described emotional tension, saying "you fall in love with them, they fall in love with you, and when you criticise them they cry."&lt;ref name="Radcliffe"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/10/nobel-scientist-tim-hunt-female-scientists-cause-trouble-for-men-in-labs|title=Nobel scientist Tim Hunt: female scientists cause trouble for men in labs|last=Radcliffe|first=Rebecca|date=10 June 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, his [[Sir Tim Hunt controversy at WCSJ|remarks]] were widely condemned and he was forced to resign from his position at [[University College London]].  However, multiple conference attendees gave accounts, including a partial transcript and a partial recording, maintaining that his comments were understood to be satirical before being taken out of context by the media.&lt;ref name="Times_Moody_18July"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/science/article4501733.ece|title=Recording ‘shows Sir Tim was joking’|last1=Moody|first1=Oliver|date=18 July 2015|work=The Times|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 an article published in ''[[JAMA Dermatology]]'' reported a significant and dramatic downward trend in the number of NIH-funded woman investigators in the field of dermatology and that the gender gap between male and female NIH-funded dermatology investigators was widening.  The article concluded that this disparity was likely due to a lack of institutional support for women investigators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cheng|first=Michelle A.|author2=Annie Sukhov|author3=Hawa Sultani|author4=Koungmi Kim|author5=Emanual Maverakis|date=May 2016|title=Trends in National Institutes of Health Funding of Principal Investigators in Dermatology Research by Academic Degree and Sex|url=http://archderm.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2522760|journal=JAMA Dermatology|volume=152|issue=8|pages=883–8|doi=10.1001/jamadermatol.2016.0271|pmid=27191545}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Problematic public statements ====
In January 2005, [[Harvard University]] President [[Lawrence Summers]] sparked controversy at a National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) Conference on Diversifying the Science &amp; Engineering Workforce. Dr. Summers offered his explanation for the shortage of women in senior posts in science and engineering. He made comments suggesting the lower numbers of women in high-level science positions may in part be due to innate differences in abilities or preferences between men and women. Making references to the field and behavioral genetics, he noted the generally greater variability among men (compared to women) on tests of cognitive abilities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hedges|first1=L. V.|last2=Nowell|first2=A.|year=1995|title=Sex differences in mental scores, variability, and numbers of high scoring individuals|url=http://atavisionary.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Sex-differences-in-mental-test-scores-variability-and-numbers-of-high-scoring-individuals-1995-hedges-nowell.pdf|journal=Science|volume=269|issue=5220|pages=41–45|bibcode=1995Sci...269...41H|doi=10.1126/science.7604277|pmid=7604277}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lehrke, R.

In his discussion of this, Summers said that "even small differences in the standard deviation [between genders] will translate into very large differences in the available pool substantially out [from the mean]".&lt;ref name="harvard2005"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080130023006/http://www.president.harvard.edu/speeches/2005/nber.html Archive of: Remarks at NBER Conference on Diversifying the Science &amp; Engineering Workforce]. 14 January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Summers concluded his discussion by saying:&lt;blockquote&gt;So my best guess, to provoke you, of what's behind all of this is that the largest phenomenon, by far, is the general clash between people's legitimate family desires and employers' current desire for high power and high intensity, that in the special case of science and engineering, there are issues of intrinsic aptitude, and particularly of the variability of aptitude, and that those considerations are reinforced by what are in fact lesser factors involving socialization and continuing discrimination.&lt;ref name="harvard2005" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Despite his protégée, Sheryl Sandberg, defending Summers’ actions and Summers offering his own apology repeatedly, the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences passed a motion of “lack of confidence” in the leadership of Summers who had allowed tenure offers to women plummet after taking office in 2001.&lt;ref name="harvard2005" /&gt; The year before he became president, Harvard extended 13 of its 36 tenure offers to women and by 2004 those numbers had dropped to 4 of 32 with several departments lacking even a single tenured female professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/06/education/06iht-ffharvard.html|title=After Harvard Controversy, Conditions Change but Reputation Lingers|last=Lewin|first=Tamar|date=2010-03-05|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; This controversy is speculated to have significantly contributed to Summers resignation from his position at Harvard the following year.

The '''Zo'é people''' (also known as '''Zo'é''' or the '''Marrying tribe''') are a native tribe in the State of [[Pará]], Municipality of [[Óbidos, Pará|Óbidos]], on the [[Cuminapanema River]], [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=pto |title=Zo'é |accessdate=2007-10-18 |work=ethnologue.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are a [[Tupi–Guarani]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socioambiental.org/pib/english/howtheylive/isol.shtm#t3 |title=The case of the Zo'é |accessdate=2007-10-18 |work=Indigenous Peoples in Brazil |publisher=Instituto Socioambiental |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071015022525/http://www.socioambiental.org/pib/english/howtheylive/isol.shtm#t3 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socioambiental.org/pib/english/indiandus/zoei.shtm |title=Jipohan is someone like yourself |accessdate=2007-10-18 |work=socioambiental.org |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070705003513/http://www.socioambiental.org/pib/english/indiandus/zoei.shtm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
They are also known as the Poturu, Poturujara, or Buré. The term "Zo'é" means "us," as opposed to non-Indians or enemies. The term "Poturu" is the type of wood used to make the embe'po [[labret]]s which they wear.&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;

==Language==
The [[Zo'é language]] belongs to Subgroup VIII of the [[Tupi-Guarani language]] family.&lt;ref name=ethno/&gt;

==Culture==
All Zo'é wear the poturu, a wooden plug piercing the bottom lip. The Zo'é have a tradition where new fathers have the backs of their [[Calf (anatomy)|calves]] cut with the 'tooth of a small rodent'.

The marriage rituals of the Zo'é are complex and not fully understood. It is not known how many wives or husbands one is allowed to have. Many women practice [[polyandry]]. One or more husbands may be "learning husbands"; young men learning how to be good spouses, in exchange for hunting for the rest of the family.

{{quote|In the state of Para, Northern Brazil, in one of the last still largely unexplored rainforests in the world, a new tribe, the Zo'é, was recently contacted. They live between the Amazon River and the country of Suriname. The Zo'é are part of the Tupi linguistic group. Little is known about them. They are semi-nomadic hunters and gatherers. Their favorite prey is monkey, which is plentiful in the region during the dry season. During the rainy season, the Zo'é rely on a root plant called [[manioc]], which must be processed into flour to avoid its poisonous properties.|[[Jean-Pierre Dutilleux]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jpdutilleux.com/thework/zoe/index.html |title=Jean-Pierre Dutilleux, The Zoe |accessdate=2007-10-18 |work=jpdutilleux.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228082712/http://jpdutilleux.com/thework/zoe/index.html |archivedate=December 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
