'''Abbas Sahhat''' ({{lang-az|Abbas Səhhət}}), born '''Abbasgulu Aliabbas oglu Mehdizadeh''' (1874 in [[Shamakhi]] – 11 July 1918 in [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]]), was an [[Azerbaijan]]i poet and dramatist.

==Life and career==
Abbas Sahhat was born into the family of a cleric in the city of Shamakhi. He received his primary education from his father. At age 15 he started writing amateur poems.&lt;ref name="kultur"&gt;{{tr icon}} [http://www.kultur.gov.tr/TR/Tempdosyalar/109864__abbassehhet.pdf Abbas Sahhat]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. ''Kultur.gov.tr''&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1892 he studied [[medicine]] in [[Mashhad]] and [[Tehran]]. After returning to Shamakhi around 1900 he abandoned his professional field, as Russian institutions did not recognize medical diplomas from Iran. Sahhat started teaching Azeri and literature first in primary schools and then in a [[Realschule]]. This period is considered the beginning of his career as a poet and playwright. In 1903 he began writing articles for the Azeri-language newspaper ''Sharg-i Rus'', published in [[Tiflis]]. His articles mostly discussed topics in contemporary literature.&lt;ref name="sayt.ws"&gt;{{Az icon}} [http://www.sayt.ws/shexsiyyetler/bbbbb/adabiyyat/sahhat.html Abbas Sahhat]. ''Sayt.ws''&lt;/ref&gt;

As a poet, Sahhat adhered generally to [[romanticism]]. His poetry was influenced by [[Ali bey Huseynzadeh]], editor of the ''Fuyuzat'' magazine in 1905–1907. Sahhat also translated works of [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]], [[Mikhail Lermontov|Lermontov]], [[Semen Nadson|Nadson]], [[Ivan Krylov|Krylov]], [[Victor Hugo|Hugo]], [[Alfred de Musset|Musset]], [[Sully Prudhomme|Prudhomme]], [[Amir Khusro]] as well as a number of [[German literature|German]] poets into Azeri.&lt;ref name="sayt.ws"/&gt;

In 1912 he published his first collection of poems entitled ''Sinig saz'' ("Broken [[Bağlama|Saz]]"), his narrative poem ''Ahmadin shujaati'' and his translations of Western European literature under the name ''Garb gunashi'' ("The Sun of the West"). In 1916 his [[romantic poetry|romantic poem]] ''Shah, muza va shaharli'' was published. In his literary style, influence of classical poets such as [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]], [[Hafez]] and [[Saadi (poet)|Saadi]], and modern poets such as [[Tevfik Fikret]], is seen.&lt;ref name="sayt.ws"/&gt;

Among his dramatic pieces, ''Neft fontani'' (1912) and ''Yoxsullug ayib deyil'' (1913) are noteworthy. There are accounts of a novel written by Sahhat and entitled ''Ali and Aisha''. It was never published and its manuscript is believed to have perished during the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation|Dashnak]] occupation of Shamakhi in April 1918, when Sahhat's house was ravaged and burned. The poet himself managed to escape the town with his family, fleeing first to [[Kurdamir]] and later to Ganja, where he died some months later of a stroke.&lt;ref name="kultur"/&gt;

Abbas Sahhat was in favour of [[liberalism|liberal]] [[bourgeoisie]] and, due to his [[Iran]]ian academic upbringing, disagreed with mass [[secularisation]] that was taking place among Azeris beginning in the early 20th century. Instead he promoted a more moderate idea of all-Muslim [[westernization]]. He dedicated some of his finest pieces of poetry to the [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution]], in which he presented himself as a [[realism (arts)|realist]] poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} Литературная энциклопедия 1929—1939.

In [[computer science]], an '''abstract syntax tree''' ('''AST'''), or just '''syntax tree''', is a [[directed tree|tree]] representation of the [[abstract syntax|abstract syntactic]] structure of [[source code]] written in a [[programming language]]. Each node of the tree denotes a construct occurring in the source code. The syntax is "abstract" in the sense that it does not represent every detail appearing in the real syntax, but rather just the structural, content-related details. For instance, grouping [[Bracket#Parentheses|parentheses]] are implicit in the tree structure, and a syntactic construct like an if-condition-then expression may be denoted by means of a single node with three branches.

This distinguishes abstract syntax trees from concrete syntax trees, traditionally designated [[parse tree]]s, which are typically built by a [[parser]] during the source code translation and [[compiler|compiling]] process. Once built, additional information is added to the AST by means of subsequent processing, e.g., [[Semantic analysis (compilers)|contextual analysis]].

Abstract syntax trees are also used in [[program analysis]] and [[program transformation]] systems.

== Application in compilers ==

Abstract syntax trees are [[data structures]] widely used in [[compilers]] to represent the structure of program code. An AST is usually the result of the [[syntax analysis]] phase of a compiler. It often serves as an intermediate representation of the program through several stages that the compiler requires, and has a strong impact on the final output of the compiler.

=== Motivation ===
An AST has several properties that aid the further steps of the compilation process:
* An AST can be edited and enhanced with information such as properties and annotations for every element it contains. Such editing and annotation is impossible with the source code of a program, since it would imply changing it.
* Compared to the [[source code]], an AST does not include inessential punctuation and delimiters (braces, semicolons, parentheses, etc.).
* An AST usually contains extra information about the program, due to the consecutive stages of analysis by the compiler. For example, it may store the position of each element in the source code, allowing the compiler to print useful error messages.

ASTs are needed because of the inherent nature of programming languages and their documentation. Languages are often ambiguous by nature. In order to avoid this ambiguity, programming languages are often specified as a [[context-free grammar]] (CFG). However, there are often aspects of programming languages that a CFG can't express, but are part of the language and are documented in its specification. These are details that require a context to determine their validity and behaviour. For example, if a language allows new types to be declared, a CFG cannot predict the names of such types nor the way in which they should be used. Even if a language has a predefined set of types, enforcing proper usage usually requires some context. Another example is [[duck typing]], where the type of an element can change depending on context. [[Operator overloading]] is yet another case where correct usage and final function are determined based on the context. Java provides an excellent example, where the '+' operator is both numerical addition and concatenation of strings.

Although there are other [[data structure]]s involved in the inner workings of a compiler, the AST performs a unique function. During the first stage, the [[syntax analysis]] stage, a compiler produces a parse tree. This parse tree can be used to perform almost all functions of a compiler by means of syntax-directed translation. Although this method can lead to a more efficient compiler, it goes against the software engineering principles of writing and maintaining programs{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}. Another advantage that the AST has over a parse tree is the size, particularly the smaller height of the AST and the smaller number of elements.

=== Design ===

The design of an AST is often closely linked with the design of a compiler and its expected features.

Core requirements include the following:

* Variable types must be preserved, as well as the location of each declaration in source code.
* The order of executable statements must be explicitly represented and well defined.
* Left and right components of binary operations must be stored and correctly identified.
* Identifiers and their assigned values must be stored for assignment statements.

These requirements can be used to design the data structure for the AST.

Some operations will always require two elements, such as the two terms for addition. However, some language constructs require an arbitrarily large number of children, such as argument lists passed to programs from the [[command shell]]. As a result, an AST used to represent code written in such a language has to also be flexible enough to allow for quick addition of an unknown quantity of children.

Another major design requirement for an AST is that it should be possible to unparse an AST into source code form.{{why?|date=September 2015}} The source code produced should be sufficiently similar to the original in appearance and identical in execution, upon recompilation.

=== Design patterns ===

Due to the complexity of the requirements for an AST and the overall complexity of a compiler, it is beneficial to apply sound software development principles. One of these is to use proven design patterns to enhance modularity and ease of development.

Different operations don't necessarily have different types, so it is important to have a sound node class hierarchy. This is crucial in the creation and the modification of the AST as the compiler progresses.

Because the compiler traverses the tree several times to determine syntactic correctness, it is important to make traversing the tree a simple operation. The compiler executes a specific set of operations, depending on the type of each node, upon reaching it, so it often makes sense to use the [[visitor pattern]].

=== Usage ===

The AST is used intensively during [[Semantic analysis (compilers)|semantic analysis]], where the compiler checks for correct usage of the elements of the program and the language. The compiler also generates [[symbol table]]s based on the AST during semantic analysis. A complete traversal of the tree allows verification of the correctness of the program.

After verifying correctness, the AST serves as the base for code generation. The AST is often used to generate an intermediate representation (IR), sometimes called an [[intermediate language]], for the code generation.

The language has been called ''Ejenge Dõ'' or ''Kolum So'' in the literature. However, there are two Ejenge groups, the [[Mombo Dogon|Mombo]] and the Ampari. The Ampari understand Mombo but not vice versa; this appears to be learned intelligibility, since the Ampari visit Mombo yearly.

In the village of Flicko, people call themselves ''Nyamboli'' and their language ''Nyambeeŋge'', but these terms vary regionally.

'''Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic''' is a modern [[Jew]]ish [[Aramaic language]], often called ''Neo-Aramaic'' or ''[[Judeo-Aramaic]]''. It was originally spoken in three villages near [[Aqrah]] in [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

It is nearly extinct, with only about 20 elderly speakers today.&lt;ref name=MUTZAFIC/&gt;

== Classification ==
Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic is classified as Afro-Asiatic, Semitic, and Aramaic language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/3922 |title=Endangered Languages Project - Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic |website=Endangeredlanguages.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005063054/http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/3922 |archive-date=2016-10-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin and use today ==
The Jewish inhabitants of a wide area from northern [[Iraq]], eastern [[Turkey]] and north western [[Iran]], corresponding to the area of [[Kurdistan]], mostly spoke various dialects of modern [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]. The turmoil near the end of [[World War I]] and resettlement in [[Israel]] in 1951 (when eight families from Bijil moved to the new Jewish state) led to the decline of these traditional languages. This particular and distinct dialect of Jewish Neo-Aramaic was spoken in the villages of Bijil, Barzan and Shahe. It was known as ''Bijili'' until recently.

The last native speaker of Bijil Neo-Aramaic, Mrs. Rahel Avraham, died in [[Jerusalem]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic | website = www.endangeredlanguages.com | url = http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/bjf | access-date = January 23, 2017 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170202070135/http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/bjf | archivedate = February 2, 2017 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining second-language speakers are all related and over 70 years of age, and most from Barzan.  Other speakers are from Aqra.  Barzan and Aqra are both located in Iraqi Kurdistan. The first language of these speakers is either [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] or [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], and some also speak [[Arabic language|Arabic]] or another Neo-Aramaic dialect. Thus, the language is effectively extinct.

Most of the speakers of Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic live in Jerusalem, Israel today.&lt;ref name=MUTZAFIC/&gt;

== History ==

Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic is part of the Northeastern Neo-Aramaic (NENA) speech-type.  Many of the NENA languages are seriously endangered, like Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic.  Most of the NENA languages became endangered since most of the Aramaic speaking Jewry began to immigrate to Israel.  This occurred mostly during the 1950s. Barzani Jewish-Neo Aramaic stands out from these languages because it began its endangerment in the early 1900s.  This occurred in Kurdistan. The reason for the decline of the language was that most of the speakers were dispersed and integrated into communities that spoke other languages than Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic.  This dispersal occurred violently in many of the communities by outside forces.&lt;ref name=MUTZAFIC/&gt;

Most speakers of Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic now speak Israeli Hebrew or Arabic.&lt;ref name=MUTZAFIC/&gt;

== Geographical Distribution ==
Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic is only spoken in Israel today.  Speakers come mostly from Iraq.

Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic is not the official language of any country.

== Sounds and Phonology ==
There are 23 in the Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic alphabet and eight vowels.  
The letters can sound differently, making 35 distinct sounds.

== Dialects and Varieties ==

Between the years of 1996 and 2000, three dialects of Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic were discovered. They are called Barzan, Shahe, and Bejil.  Bejil is extinct.&lt;ref name=MUTZAFIC/&gt;

It may be related to [[Lishanid Noshan]], which has clusters around [[Arbil]] to the south east of Barzan. There may be some similarities between Barzani and the subdialect of Lishanid Noshan formerly spoken in the village of Dobe, 50&amp;nbsp;km north of Arbil. The Sandu dialect of Jewish Neo-Aramaic is quite similar to Barzani. However, studies suggest that it has more in common with [[Lishana Deni]]. There is evidence that the language was also spoken in the nearby village of Nerim, but no speaker from that village remains.

Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic has been infused with words from the Jewish Neo-Aramaic dialect of Zakho.  This occurred due to the close proximity of the speakers of Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic and the dialect Zakho.  This dialect is the most commonly spoken variant of Aramaic spoken in Jerusalem.  This dialect is seen as more prestigious by the speakers and is most commonly understood.&lt;ref name=MUTZAFIC/&gt;

== Examples ==
Hezy Mutzafi has recorded and translated two texts in Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic.&lt;ref name=MUTZAFIC/&gt;

== Writing system ==
The alphabet used in Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic is the same alphabet used in modern Hebrew.

'''''Caravan of Dreams''''' is a book by [[Idries Shah]] first published in 1968 by [[Octagon Press]] as part of his presentation of traditional [[Orient|Eastern]] teachings and [[Sufism|Sufi]] ideas for contemporary society. New editions of the book were published in 2015 by [[The Idries Shah Foundation]].

Shah relates the title to three traditional sources: the story of ''Maruf the Cobbler'', which can be found in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''; a [[proverb]] which says, “The Dog may bark, but the Caravan moves on”; and some verses from the [[Sufism|Sufi]] Master [[Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari|Bahaudin Naqshband]] which read:

“Here we are, all of us: in a dream-caravan.&lt;br /&gt;
A caravan, but a dream – a dream, but a caravan.&lt;br /&gt;
And we know which are the dreams.&lt;br /&gt;
Therein lies the hope.”&lt;ref name="caravan-of-dreams"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Idries|title=Caravan of Dreams|date=1968|publisher=Octagon Press|location=London|isbn=0863040438}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary / content==
The book contains sections on the Traditions ([[Hadith]]s) of the [[Prophet]] [[Muhammad]] (primarily from the [[Mishkat al-Masabih|Mishkat]] of [[Al-Baghawi]] of [[Herat]]), the adventures of the [[Nasreddin|Mulla Nasrudin]], thoughts from [[Omar Khayyam]], meditations of [[Rumi]], and the definitions of [[Mulla Do-Piyaza|Mulla Do-Piaza]], as well as sayings from many  classical Sufi Masters like [[Saadi Shirazi|Saadi]], [[Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari|Bahaudin Naqshband]] and Khwaja Ahrar. Also included are some excerpts about [[Islam]]ic culture and history from [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' and from Shah's earlier book of travels, ''[[Destination Mecca]]''. Two [[anecdote]]s are about Shah's great-great grandfather, [[Jan-Fishan Khan]].&lt;ref name="caravan-of-dreams" /&gt;
 
Much of the book is devoted to important [[teaching stories]] from the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]], such as ''The Four Men and the Interpreter'' (from Rumi's ''[[Masnavi]]''), ''The Magic Horse'' (from the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]''), and ''The Story of Mushkil Gusha'' (a Persian tale traditionally recited on Thursday nights).&lt;ref name="ishk-mushkil-gusha"&gt;{{cite web

Doris Lessing commented on how in this book “Shah spoke openly, but briefly, about the Sufi use of tales...” and she explained that “Sufis have always taught through stories, and [[pedant]]s and traditionalists have perennially complained – and sometimes about the greatest of the Sufis – 'but these are merely tales of the kind you tell to children.' The claim is that the action of the genuine Sufi teaching story is 'direct and certain' upon the innermost self of the human being and this is true whether or not the said human is prepared to acknowledge that he or she has an innermost self. This attitude to literature brings us into an unfamiliar relation with our own literary heritage. The tales, anecdotes, illustrative recitals, jokes are not meant to be attacked by the intellectual apparatus...” &lt;ref name="lessing-time-bites-363-364"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lessing|first1=Doris|title=Time Bites|date=2005|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=New York|isbn=9780007179862|pages=363–364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lessing-telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lessing|first1=Doris|title=Summing up|work=The Daily Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|date=23 November 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Science fiction]] author, editor and reviewer, [[Douglas Hill]] reiterates Shah's assertion that the stories are not only entertaining, but establish in the reader “a means of communication with a non-verbalised truth.”&lt;ref name="hill-teaching-stories"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hill|first1=Douglas|title=Teaching Stories|journal=The Tribune|date=16 August 1968|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychologist Robert Ornstein states that teaching tales like the ones found in "Caravan of Dreams" are traditionally used for the indirect communication of knowledge.&lt;ref name=&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = 978-1-933779-63-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his introduction to “The Magic Horse”, Shah writes that teaching stories operate on a level different from that of [[fable]]s and [[parable]]s and, when intact, are a “priceless heritage of mankind” and precisely tooled instruments to “assist the interior movement of the mind.”&lt;ref name="new-society"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Teaching Stories|journal=New Society|date=20 June 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Douglas Hill wrote in ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'' that the teaching stories form the “real value” of the book: “One can read a story or two and be delighted. But the effect does not stop there. These stories adhere, return, seeming somehow to expand after reading into an area beyond outer consciousness. Like fine poems, their balanced harmonies appeal... they seem to enrich, elevate, nourish, without intellectualisation or special emotional attunement. The experience is more than rewarding, and impossible to forget.”&lt;ref name="hill-teaching-stories" /&gt;

A review in ''[[New Society]]'' said that the book indicates “real possibilities and practical alternatives to our present ways of operation; presenting not idle fantasies but signals from the tradition of known and tested activity; relevant, fruitful and urgent for our present society... Throughout the book notes are sounded, models given, maps drawn. Much is channelled through 'teaching stories' [which] concern human patterns of criticism, notions of communication, ideas of justice, and obstacles of self-esteem... Informing, instructing, entertaining, alarming: with funny and intensely painful moments, others of immediate practicality, and others... of extraordinary enchantment.”&lt;ref name="new-society" /&gt;

Award-winning author and later winner of the 2007 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], [[Doris Lessing]] wrote that the book has information which is a “useful corrective” to the West's ignorance and prejudice about Islam, Islamic cultures and Islamic Sufism.&lt;ref name="lessing-time-bites-266"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lessing|first1=Doris|title=Time Bites|date=2005|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=New York|isbn=9780007179862|page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1973 review in [[Afghanistan]]'s ''[[Kabul Times]]'' said that ''Caravan of Dreams'' was “highly recommended” and “of especial interest to Afghans” because it is “basically an [[anthology]] of short stories, tales and proverbs, jokes and extracts, from the written and [[oral literature]] which forms a part of many an evening's talk and interchange – even in these modern times – in Afghanistan.” They pointed out that the book – which seemingly discussed almost every facet of Islamic life and thought – had been well-received in the [[United States]] and [[Continental Europe]], and was on the reading list of several universities in Islamic and literature courses. They added that the book was also recommended for the purpose of deep psychological study by people like Professor [[Robert E. Ornstein]] (in his book ''The Psychology of Consciousness'') because it illustrates the pioneering work of Islamic thinkers who depicted, in traditional literature from many centuries ago, patterns and workings of the mind and brain now confirmed by modern scientific studies.&lt;ref name="kabul-times"&gt;{{cite news|work=Kabul Times|publisher=|title=Caravan of Dreams|date=13 May 1973|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Hindustan Standard]]'' of India found that ''Caravan of Dreams'' was a “fabulous collection of [[folklore]] nuggets from the West and Central Asia... extracts, thoughts and teachings, in very readable translation, of the unknown wise men of, in and around Arabia. The horse-sense of some of the anecdotes and stories is equally amusing and rewarding... This is a fine anthology, dippable-into at any time for entertainment, refreshment, consolation, and inspiration... witty, engrossing, utterly and appealingly human.”&lt;ref name="hindustan-standard"&gt;{{cite news|title=Oriental Wisdom|work=Hindustan Standard|publisher=ABP Group|date=4 January 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A silent count off, such as those given by an orchestral conductor using a [[Baton (conducting)|baton]], may be given as a value "in front" (''i.e.'' "eight in front" refers to a count off of eight beats).&lt;ref name="Tedesco 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tedesco|first=Tommy|title=For Guitar Players Only|year=2008|publisher=Alfred Publishing Co.|location=Van Nuys, CA|isbn=1-4574-3052-5|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recorded music, the final two beats of the count off (one, two, one—two—''three''—''four'') are often silent to avoid [[spill (audio)|spill]] onto the recording,&lt;ref name="Sweetwater" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharp 1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharp|first=J.D.|title=Home recording techniques : a step-by-step guide to multitracking and mixing|year=1992|publisher=Alfred Publishing Co.|location=Van Nuys, CA|isbn=0-88284-495-4|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially if the piece has a [[anacrusis|pickup]].

In the case of "[[I Saw Her Standing There]]" by [[The Beatles]], the count off was edited onto a different [[take]] of the song.&lt;ref name="Lewisohn 1988"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewisohn|first=Mark|title=The Beatles recording sessions|year=1988|publisher=Harmony Books|location=New York|isbn=0-517-57066-1|page=9|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recorded count off can be made by musicians through an open microphone or through the studio's [[talkback (recording)|talkback system]],&lt;ref name="Hurtig 1988"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hurtig|first=Brent|title=Multi-Track Recording for Musicians|year=1988|publisher=Alfred Publishing Co.|location=Van Nuys, CA|isbn=1-4574-2484-3|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter being done by non-performing personnel such as the [[record producer|producer]] or [[audio engineer|engineer]]. The inclusion of a count off in a studio recording may give the impression of a live performance, as on the Beatles' "[[Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band Reprise]]" (1967).&lt;ref name="Continuum"/&gt;

[[File:Countersunk and counterbored holes cross-section.png|thumb|Comparison of countersunk and counterbored holes.]]
A '''Countersink''' (symbol: [[Miscellaneous Technical#Miscellaneous Technical (2300–23FF) in Unicode|'''⌵''']]) is a [[Cone (geometry)|conical]] hole cut into a manufactured object, or the cutter used to cut such a hole. A common use is to allow the head of a countersunk bolt, screw or rivet, when placed in the hole, to sit flush with or below the surface of the surrounding material (by comparison, a [[counterbore]] makes a flat-bottomed hole that might be used with a socket-head capscrew). A countersink may also be used to remove the [[Burr (metal)|burr]] left from a drilling or [[Taps and dies|tapping]] operation thereby improving the finish of the product and removing any hazardous sharp edges.

The basic geometry of a countersink (cutter) inherently can be applied to the plunging applications described above (axial feed only) and also to other milling applications (sideways traversal). Therefore, countersinks overlap in form, function, and sometimes name with chamfering endmills ([[endmill]]s with angled tips). Regardless of the name given to the cutter, the surface being generated may be a conical chamfer (plunging applications) or a beveled corner for the intersection of two planes (traversing applications).

===Machining===
A countersink may be used in many tools, such as [[drill]]s, [[drill press]]es, [[milling machine]]s, and [[lathe]]s.

====Cross-hole countersink cutter====
[[File:CrossHoleDeburrer.jpg|thumb|200px|Side and end view of a Weldon style "zero flute" countersink]]

A Dan Martin Style "zero flute" countersink is a cone-shaped tool with a cutting edge provided by a hole that goes through the side of the cone. The intersection of the hole and cone form the cutting edge on the tool. The cone is not truly symmetrical as it is essential that the cone retreats away from the cutting edge as the tool rotates providing clearance. If this does not occur the cutting edge will lack clearance and rub rather than ''bite'' into the material. This clearance is referred to as [[cutting relief]].

These tools are best used as deburring tools, where the [[Burr (metal)|burr]] from a previous machining operation needs to be removed for cosmetic and safety reasons, however they may be used in softer materials (such as wood or plastic) to create a countersunk hole for a screw.

====Fluted countersink cutter====
[[File:4FlutedCountersink.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Side and end view of a 4-fluted countersink]]

The [[Flute (cutting tool)|fluted]] countersink cutter is used to provide a heavy [[chamfer]] in the entrance to a drilled hole. This may be required to allow the correct seating for a [[Screw#Types of screws and bolts|countersunk-head screw]] or to provide the lead in for a second machining operation such as [[taps and dies|tapping]]. Countersink cutters are manufactured with six common angles, which are 60°, 82°, 90°, 100°, 110°, or 120°, with the two most common of those being 82° and 90°. Countersunk-head screws that follow the [[Unified Thread Standard]] very often have an 82° angle, and screws that follow the [[ISO metric screw thread|ISO standard]] very often have a 90° angle. Throughout the aerospace industry, countersunk fasteners typically have an angle of 100°.

====Back countersink====
A ''back countersink'', also known as an ''inserted countersink'', is a two piece countersink used on tough to reach areas. One component is a rod that is inserted into the existing hole in the workpieces; the other component is the cutter, which is attached to the rod, or extends out of it, after it is in position.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reithmaier|1999|p=90}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This is comparable to other types of "back-" machining, such as back-spotfacing, back-boring, back-counterboring, back-milling, and back-deburring. The common theme is accomplishing machining operations on the far side of the workpiece from the spindle face, which obviates a "second operation" setup. This reduces setup time and frustration in several ways. Not only does it obviate the flipping over, cleaning, reclamping, etc., but it also can allow effortless high concentricity, parallelism, and squareness with the first setup's datum without the hassle of reestablishing it on another setup (via painstaking [[dial indicator|indicating]]).

====Speeds, feeds, and avoiding chatter====
It can often be difficult to avoid chatter (also known as machining vibrations) when cutting with countersink cutters. As usual in machining, the shorter and more rigid the setup, the better. Better-quality fluted countersink cutters sometimes have the flutes (or at least one flute) at an irregular pitching. This variation in pitching reduces the chance of the cutting edges setting up a [[harmonic]] action and leaving an undulated surface. This surface ripple is also dependent on the surface speed of the cutting edges, material type, and applied pressure (or feed rate); once started it is hard to remove. Too light a feed tends to increase chatter risk. As in many other machining operations, an appropriate response to the chatter may be to decrease speed and increase feed. On a drill press, the slowest available spindle speed is usually best. With a variable-speed handheld power drill, the trigger is best squeezed lightly to yield a low spindle speed.

Good chatter-free results can usually be had by countersinking by hand (as opposed to running the tool in a powered spindle). The slow speed and sensitive feed tend to prevent chatter. With a quarter-inch-hex shank, the countersink cutter can be held with a screwdriver handle of the indexable - bit type.

===Form countersinking===&lt;!-- [[Dimpling]] &amp; [[form countersinking]] redirect here --&gt;
Form countersinking, also known as ''dimpling'', is a countersink that is formed into [[sheet metal]] to increase the strength of a structure as the countersinks of multiple pieces nest together. There are two processes for producing formed countersinks: ''coin dimpling'' and ''modified radius dimpling''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reithmaier|1999|p=91}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Such dimples in fairly thick sheet can even be [[tap and die|tapped]] to yield a threaded [[hardpoint]] on the sheet without the bother and expense of welding a [[nut (hardware)|nut]] to the sheet. This style of construction is often seen in modern household appliance design, because it allows the product to be lower-priced, and the quality can still be good as long as the sheet is thick enough.

The term '''course of performance''' is defined in the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;(a) A "course of performance" is a sequence of conduct between the parties to a particular transaction that exists if:
:(1) the agreement of the parties with respect to the transaction involves repeated occasions for performance by a party; and 
:(2) the other party, with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity for objection to it, accepts the performance or acquiesces in it without objection.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/1/1-303 UCC § 1-303(a)]. "[[Course of dealing]]," as defined in [UCC §&amp;nbsp;1-303] subsection (b), is restricted, literally, to a sequence of conduct between the parties previous to the agreement. A sequence of conduct after or under the agreement, however, is a "course of performance."&lt;ref&gt;Cmt. 2, UCC §&amp;nbsp;1-303.&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a contract involves repeated occasions for performance and opportunity for objection "any course of performance accepted or acquiesced in without objection shall be relevant to determine the meaning of the agreement."&lt;ref&gt;UCC 2-208[1].&lt;/ref&gt; "[S]uch course of performance shall be relevant to show a waiver or modification of any term inconsistent with such course of performance."&lt;ref&gt;UCC 2-208[3].&lt;/ref&gt; This UCC section recognizes that the "parties themselves know best what they have meant by their words of agreement and their action under that agreement is the best indication of what that meaning was."&lt;ref&gt;UCC 2-208, cmt, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is well established that a written contract may be modified by the parties' post-agreement "course of performance." &lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Rose v. Spa Realty Assocs.'', 42 N.Y.2d 338, 397 N.Y.S.2d 922, 366 N.E.2d 1279 (1977); ''GE Capital Commer. Auto. Fin. v. Spartan Motors, Ltd.'', 246 A.D.2d 41, 52, 675 N.Y.S.2d 626, 634 (App. Div. 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

A waiver that changes the express terms of a contract can be established by evidence of a course of performance. This holds true even for contracts that are fully integrated. The policy behind this "broad doctrine of waiver" in contract law is to "prevent the waiving party from 'lull[ing] another into a false assurance that strict compliance with a contractual duty will not be required and then sue for noncompliance.'&amp;#8239;"&lt;ref&gt;''Midwest Builder Distrib. v. Lord &amp; Essex'', 383 Ill. App. 3d 645, 674, 322 Ill. Dec. 371, 398, 891 N.E.2d 1, 28 (2007); ''Whalen v. K Mart Corp.'', 166 Ill. App. 3d 339, 343, 519 N.E.2d 991, 116 Ill. Dec. 776 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not necessary that the contract be ambiguous before course of performance will be considered.&lt;ref&gt;''Feinberg v. Federated Dept. Stores, Inc.'', 15 Misc. 3d 299, 300, 832 N.Y.S.2d 760, 761 (Sup. Ct. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

A course of dealing is shown by repeated instances of the relevant conduct, not single occasions or actions.&lt;ref&gt;''Dallas. Aero., Inc. v. CIS Air Corp.'', 352 F.3d 775, 783 (2d Cir. 2003); ''Cravotta v. Deggingers' Foundry, Inc.'', 288 P.3d 871 (Kan. Ct. App. 2012); ''Estate of Polushkin v. Maw'', 170 P.3d 162, 171 (Alaska 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8314">A '''demand guarantee''' is a [[guarantee]] that must be honoured by the [[guarantor]] upon [[beneficiary]]'s demand. The beneficiary is not required to first make a claim or take any action against the obligor of the guaranteed obligation that the guarantee supports. A demand guarantee is enforceable notwithstanding any deficiencies in the enforceability of the underlying obligation.

==Terminology==
*The '''[[guarantor]]''' is the person providing the [[guarantee]].
*The '''[[obligor]]''' is the person whose obligations are supported by the [[guarantee]].
*The '''underlying obligation''' is the primary debt or contractual obligation of the obligor that the guarantee supports.
*The '''[[beneficiary]]''' is person to whom the [[obligor]] owes the underlying obligation and who benefits from the [[guarantee]].

==Conditional Guarantees==
Traditionally, an English law [[guarantee]] is a secondary, [[:wikt:conditional|conditional]] [[obligation]]: It is a [[promise]] to pay (or perform) the obligations of a distinct [[obligor]] should the obligor itself fail to perform. Therefore:
*The [[beneficiary]] of the [[guarantee]] must first prove the obligor's default before the guarantor becomes [[legal liability|liable]] to pay. 
* The guarantor may raise any legal defences which are available to the Obligor
;
. Thus if the [[contract]] giving rise to the underlying obligation is void, the [[guarantor]] may also avoid its obligations under the guarantee. Additionally, an Obligor's underling obligations may be altered by the operation of insolvency laws.
*The guarantor may also raise defences which are not available to the obligor, especially where the underlying obligation has been changed since execution of the guarantee without the guarantor's consent.&lt;ref&gt;see Jones, G. 'Performance Guarantees in Construction Contracts: Surety Bonds Compared to Letter of Credit as Vehicles to Guarantee Performance' (1994) 11 I.C.L.R. .p., pp. 15-18&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Letters of Credit]]===

Major differences distinguish letters of credit from "demand guarantees"; in the latter instrument the obligation to pay is conditioned within the terms of the bank’s promise, therefore if the demand guarantee is payable upon the beneficiary’s written first demand he is assured payment notwithstanding any defence related to any other underlying transactions. Proof of default is not needed and issuers are not concerned with the underlying contract nor can they raise any defence available to the underlying contracting party.&lt;ref&gt;I.E. Contracts Ltd v. [[Lloyds Bank (historic)|Lloyds Bank]] Plc and Rafidain Bank [1989] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 205, Leggatt J. at 207&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]],  demand guarantees are seldom issued with most money center banks preferring to issue a standby letter of credit instead, primarily due to the banks familiarity with the undertaking. English courts give standby credits the same [[legal status]] that is given to demand guarantees.&lt;ref&gt;Howe Richardson Scale Co Ltd v. Polimex-Cekop [1978] 1Lloyd’s Rep 161, 165&lt;/ref&gt; In the pecking order of seniority this, for the most part is true.  In cases of a bank becoming insolvent all credit undertakings are deemed to be on par with the common shares of the bank. See Bank of International Settlements Basel II and Basel III accords.

However, fundamental differences exist between the nature of Demand Guarantees and SBLCs.  For example, SBLCs are issued as a contingent liability of the issuing banks and are issued in conjunction with a primary means of underwriting being considered.  In effect SBLC's are as they sound.. there in a "Stand-by" position to a primary means of repayment. Demand Guarantees can be issued to be the primary means for repayment.  In which case they are not necessarily contingent in nature. Because of the contingent and secondary means of collateral nature of the SBLC, it would be considered counter-intuitive for a bank to underwrite a loan or facility strictly on the basis of receiving an SBLC.  A bank lending against an SBLC alone in such a manner would in effect be purposefully underwriting a loan with the expectation that there was to be a default... Which is not something your typical bank regulators would approve.

Demand Guarantee can be issued as the primary means for meeting the loan or facility repayment terms.

== Role of Demand Guarantees in international trade ==
Demand guarantees developed to replace [[money deposits]], which sellers had to provide to buyers in order to secure the latter against the former’s default under the contract. The substitution of money deposits by demand guarantees helped account parties to maintain their [[liquidity]]: they were no more forced to tie up their money for a considerable period of time pending completion of the underlying contracts, and where the account party had no sufficient money to pay an upfront deposit it was relieved from the expense of borrowing cash from a banker and paying interest on the loan during its life. The account party also benefits from the low cost of demand guarantees compared to other instruments such as accessory guarantees.&lt;ref&gt;Fong, P. ‘An Overview of Performance Bonds, Performance Guarantees and Bank Guarantees: Part 1’(1997) 16 Tr. Law., p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

The account party might not trust the beneficiary enough to agree to provide him with a cash [[Deposit account|deposit]]; similarly the beneficiary might doubt the account party’s [[solvency]] and therefore ability to fulfill the underlying contract or its ability to rectify defaults in performance. The demand guarantee bridges the "gap of distrust" that exists between the parties. When the bank issues the demand guarantee, the beneficiary deals with a party whose financial strength he can trust and a party which would pay upon first demand regardless of an existing dispute between the parties on the performance of the underlying contract.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, M. ‘Standby Letter of Credit: Recent Limitations on the Fraud in the Transaction’ (1988) 35 Wayne L. Rev., p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, however, the demand guarantee is also used to reallocate the risks between the parties. In this regard, the demand guarantee is used to avoid three types of risk: judgment risks, execution risks and jurisdictional risks. Judgment risks include, [[List of Latin phrases (F–O)|inter alia]], risks involved in taking the dispute to court, losing on a procedural issue, the risk of an unfriendly court, evidentiary problems and the threat of political uncertainty that could prevent an action being brought against a party. Execution risks include the risk that a plaintiff could not execute a judgment against the defendant. This is often due to defendant insolvency or due to the unenforceability of one country’s court judgments in another country. Finally jurisdictional risks are part of both the above risks: they revolve mainly around the costs and difficulty that a party would endure when bringing an action against the defendant who is usually located in another jurisdiction. Where the beneficiary is issued a demand guarantee by a bank in his own locality, the guarantee aims "to shifting of risks and the cost of bearing them from [the beneficiary to the account party]".&lt;ref&gt;Dolan, ‘Standby Letters of Credit and Fraud (Is The Standby Only Another Invention of the Goldsmiths in Lombard Street?) (1985) 7 Cardozo L.R., p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Should the beneficiary find the contractor in default, he can immediately seek compensation by demanding on the guarantee and it is the account party who is forced to bring an action to recover any disputed amount. The premise in such transactions is that by agreeing to provide a demand guarantee both the account party and the beneficiary agree that the latter should not be deprived of his money (money due under the guarantee) by litigation against him at the suit of the account party.

Demand guarantees are typically subject to international set of rules, like the [[Institute of International Banking Law &amp; Practice|ISP98]], the URDG758, or the UCP600 by way of reference to such rules in the guarantee.

[[Image:Diple-periestigmene.png|thumb|Diple periestigmene (dotted diple) according to the variants in the Proposal for the Universal Character Set by [[Thesaurus Linguae Graecae]], 2003.]]

'''Diple''' ({{lang-grc|διπλῆ}}, meaning double, referring to the two lines in the mark &gt;) was used in [[marginalia|margins]] to draw attention to something in text. It is sometimes also called '''antilambda'''{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} because the sign resembles a [[Greek language|Greek]] capital letter [[lambda]] (Λ) turned upon its side. In some ways its usage was similar to modern day [[quotation marks]]; [[guillemet]]s («&amp;nbsp;»), used for quotations in French, are derived from it.

[[Isidore of Seville|Isidore]] remarks in his ''[[Etymologiae]]'' (I.XXI.13) [http://www.fh-augsburg.de/~harsch/Chronologia/Lspost07/Isidorus/isi_et01.html] that the diple was used to mark quotations from the [[Bible]]. He also talks about ''diple peri strichon'' (or ''sticon''), which was used to draw attention to separate concepts and ''diple periestigmene'' used (like [[obelism|obelos]]) to mark dubious passages. ''Diple obolismene'' was used according to Isidore to separate sentences in [[comedies]] and [[tragedies]], so its usage was similar to that of [[paragraphos]].

The '''Endangered Language Fund''' (ELF) is a small non-profit organization based in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. ELF supports [[endangered language]] maintenance and [[documentation]] projects that aim to preserve the world’s languages while contributing rare [[linguistics|linguistic]] data to the scientific community.

==Introduction==
The Fund has sponsored over 100 language projects in 30 countries since 1997, and has recently begun developing a large digital archive of endangered language data.
ELF's main mechanism of support work is funding for individuals, tribes and museums.&lt;ref name="Battista"&gt;{{cite news|last=Battista|first=Carolyn|title=On the Trail of Disappearing Languages|work=The New York Times|page=15|date=7 April 1996|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/07/nyregion/on-the-trail-of-disappearing-languages.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supported programs have been projects to develop indigenous radio programs in South Dakota, recording elders and last living speakers of endangered languages, and the production of materials to be used for language teaching programs all over the world.  
&lt;br /&gt;
There are two main grant programs that accept proposals annually, the Language Legacies Grant &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.endangeredlanguagefund.org/request.php |title=Request for Proposals 2011 Language Legacies |accessdate=2011-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Native Voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.endangeredlanguagefund.org/native_voices.php | title=Native Voices Endowment - For Certain Tribal Members |accessdate=2011-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Language Legacies Grant supports language revitalization and documentation efforts from all over the world.  It is open to community members and language research scholars across the country. ''Native Voices'' is a grant managed and distributed by ELF for Native American language revitalization from the Native Voices Endowment: A Lewis &amp; Clark Expedition Bicentennial Legacy.  Grants through this program are available to members of the Native American tribes that came in contact with the Lewis and Clark Expedition between 1803-1806.  Applicants must be Federally Recognized tribal enrolled members, tribal language programs, and tribal schools and colleges. 
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition, ELF sponsors a workshop called The Breath of Life &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.endangeredlanguagefund.org/BOL/ | title=Breathe of Life Archival Institute |accessdate=2011-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
for Native American communities who have either no living speakers or few or no fluent speakers. At the workshop, linguistic mentors are paired with participants to explore language resources and archives. The workshop is supplemented with lectures and workshops on linguistics and related topics such as language learning and teaching. The name and design is based on the  Breath of Life Language Workshop for California Indians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~survey/activities/breath-of-life.php |title=Survey of California and other Indian Languages |accessdate=2011-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524170105/http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~survey/activities/breath-of-life.php |archivedate=2011-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a biennial event designed and organized by the Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aicls.org/ | title=Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival | accessdate=2011-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hosted at the [[University of California at Berkeley]].

ELF is also responsible for an initiative known as Healing Through Language, which aims both to support indigenous language revitalization programs and to measure their effect on the health of indigenous communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.healingthroughlanguage.org/|title = Healing Through Language|date = |accessdate = January 22, 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founder of the Endangered Language fund is [[Douglas Whalen]], who served as its president until 2015, at which time he became Chair of the Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.endangeredlanguagefund.org/about_board.php|title =Endangered Language Fund: Board of Directors|date =|accessdate =January 22, 2015|website =|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150123031057/http://www.endangeredlanguagefund.org/about_board.php|archivedate =January 23, 2015|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current president is [[Monica Macaulay]] and the vice president is [[Claire Bowern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.endangeredlanguagefund.org/about_board.php|title =Endangered Language Fund: Board of Directors|date =|accessdate =January 22, 2015|website =|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150123031057/http://www.endangeredlanguagefund.org/about_board.php|archivedate =January 23, 2015|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The offices of the Fund are presently located in space lent by [[Haskins Laboratories]]. There is no formal affiliation between the two organizations.

The ELF is associated with the international network of the [[Linguapax Institute]], as the lead of Linguapax North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linguapax.org/en/linguamon.html Linguapax.org.

'''Ephraim Deinard''' (1846–1930) was one of the greatest [[Hebrew]] "bookmen" of all time. He was a [[bookseller]], [[bibliographer]], [[publicist]], [[polemicist]], historian,  [[memoirist]], author, [[editing|editor]], and [[publisher]], all rolled into one.

Deinard produced some 70 volumes whose subjects range from [[Jewish history]] and [[Jewish Antiquities|antiquities]] (especially of the [[Crimea]], Russia, America, and The [[Holy Land (Biblical)|Holy Land]]), to treatises against [[Hasidism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Communism]], [[parodies]], [[medieval]] and modern [[Hebrew literature]], Jewish religion, and especially booklore.

Deinard's [[antiquarian]] activities, which involved constant travel throughout Europe, the [[Orient]], and America, gave him a unique acquaintance with scholars, private collectors, fellow booksellers, and libraries. He came into contact and conflict with numerous Hebrew writers and Jewish communal and political figures. His wide-ranging knowledge and experience are fully reflected in his own voluminous writings, mostly in Hebrew, produced over more than half a century. His scope of interests, the intensity of his sentiments, the acerbity of his remarks, all coupled with his bibliophily, render Deinard's works a source of contemporary Jewish historical and literary controversy, as seen in the margins of the Hebrew-reading world, before and after World War I.

==Publisher==
Devoted to many periods and genres of Hebrew literature, Deinard published, aside from new or revised editions of early [[polemical]] tracts, various medieval and modern Hebrew texts, works by American Hebrew authors, and sharp critiques of modern Hebrew writing. Involved in Hebrew journalism since his youth, Deinard made several brief attempts to publish his own [[Magazine|journals]], including one of the first Hebrew papers in America, and a [[Zionist]] [[Yiddish]] paper in [[Newark, New Jersey]], of which no copy survives. Deinard did not neglect Yiddish, and in the  time he lived in [[Odessa]], he published both Hebrew and Yiddish works by the [[Podolian]]-born historian and [[belletrist]] [[M. N. Litinsky]]. Some Yiddish texts appear in his Hebrew books, and he deals with Yiddish in his catalogs and [[bibliographies]]. One of his last books, ''Devir Efrayim'', which was published just after the founding of the Yiddish Scientific Institute ([[YIVO]]) in 1925, contains a chapter on Yiddish.

His books were printed in eleven towns in Europe, [[History of Palestine#Ottoman era|Ottoman Palestine]], and America, including Odessa, [[Pressburg]], [[Warsaw]], [[Vienna]], New York City, Newark, [[Kearny, New Jersey|Kearny]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Jaffa]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and [[North Arlington, New Jersey|Arlington]]. In his time Deinard was the most prolific Hebrew author-publisher in [[New Jersey]]. At the end of his career, Deinard had sixteen volumes printed at the [[Moinester Press]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], more than he had printed in any other town. This press catered almost exclusively to immigrant [[Rabbinic literature|rabbinic]] authors from Eastern Europe. Of the books printed in St. Louis, some were "published" in [[New Orleans]], a [[Hebraist]] center where he spent his last twelve years.

Deinard's works stand out for their secular subject matter, among them the first Hebrew book on local [[American Jewish history]]. 
 
A number of Deinard's books are bibliophilic curiosities; several were printed in limited editions of 50 or 100 copies, some have survived in only a handful of copies, and one was said to survive in only a single copy. Reviving an old tradition in Hebrew printing, five of his books were printed on colored papers (blue, green, red, yellow, and gold), two of them using a variety of these papers, and one using red ink. Some of his books are unusual in their dimensions: several are very small octavos, and one work, appropriate to [[Moses Montefiore]], is an oversize folio on gold paper. The narrow miniature ''Zemir `Aritsim'' on colored papers is known as one of the great oddities of Hebrew booklore. Some books are enhanced with illustrative plates or other reproductions or fold-out leaves. The ''Kundes'', another octavo on multicolored papers, contains cartoons taken from [[Abraham Goldfaden]]'s first illustrated [[Yiddish]] [[periodical]]. A few volumes make use of unusual or complex typography.

Following a long tradition of false and fictional [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]]s in Hebrew [[publishing]], especially in Eastern Europe, one of his books bears the imprint "Sodom" and another "Boltunovka" ("Chatter-town"), although in fact both were printed in Newark, New Jersey. A third rarity, on colored papers, bears the imprint "Tsevu'im" ("the painted capital of hypocrites"), "at the press of the [[Raziel]] the angel". Deinard's eccentric and combative personality is reflected in another textual-bibliographic idiosyncrasy: he is known to have printed special copies for specific individuals, with variant texts depending on the intended recipient, some copies differing considerably from each other.

==Polemics and parodies==
Deinard is remembered today as both a bookman and a prolific polemicist, two careers inextricably linked in his singular personality. Indeed, his works are devoted in large part to religious, political, and even bibliographical polemics. He attacked Hasidism and Christianity in equal measure, with plenty of bile left over for Communism, [[Reform Judaism]], [[Kabbalah]], [[Jewish apostates]], and [[Karaism]]. Deinard reissued several early anti-Hasidic works, including two tracts of diverse authorship entitled ''Zemir 'Aritsim'', as well as his own Hebrew translation of [[Israel Ubel]]'s [[German language|German]] diatribe. He edited another polemical text preserved in [[manuscript]] in the [[Bodleian Library]] (one of several [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] manuscripts edited by Deinard), and printed a previously unpublished anti-Hasidic work by the [[Russian Federation|Russian]] [[maskil]] [[Isaac Baer Levinsohn]]. His two-volume ''Alatah'', which is of bibliographic interest, attempts to show the [[Zohar]] to be a forgery, and that Hasidism is [[Catholicism]] in disguise.

After Hasidism, Deinard's biggest bugaboo was Christianity. Over the course of 40 years, he published seven volumes of anti-Christian polemics, beginning with his first book in America, an edition of medieval Judeo&amp;ndash;Christian disputations. He later reissued [[Hasdai Crescas]]' 14th-century refutation of [[Christian]] beliefs, though his accompanying edition of an 18th-century anti-Christian polemic by [[David Nassy]] of [[Surinam]] was destroyed by fire. Deinard wrote several attacks on the Jewish biography of [[Jesus]] by [[Joseph Klausner]], and his last printed book, ''A Zoo Without an Animal'', questioned the existence of Jesus. Several of his books contain essays directed against Jewish converts to Christianity, among them the ill-fated [[antiquarian]] [[Moses Wilhelm Shapira]], who attempted to sell ancient Biblical fragments of questionable authenticity to the [[British Museum]].

Deinard's particular literary genius and satirical gifts are displayed in his ''Kundes'' ("Prankster") and ''Ployderzak'' ("Chatterbox"), written in the tradition and style of earlier [[maskilic]] or [[anti-Hasidic]] parodies. The latter, with its [[Yiddish]] title, mocks the flawed [[Jewish]] journalism of his day. These works are among the earliest of a whole genre of Hebrew parodies written in America shortly before and after 1900.

==Zionism==
A passionate [[Hebraist]] and [[Zionist]], Deinard observed and participated in Jewish national activities on three continents. He devoted a number of books to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], Zionism and related subjects, especially the Jewish national movements in Russia, Europe, and America. His narratives of trips to Palestine, [[Syria]], [[Egypt]], and every corner of Europe, focus on contemporary Jewish communities and their political affairs. Some of his earliest books, which were published in [[Pressburg]], before his emigration to America in 1888, deal with Jewish [[aliyah]]. Some of his last books include an account of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule in Palestine, a critique of British policy, and a critical biography of the [[Anglo-Jewish]] [[Maecenas]] and proto-Zionist [[Sir Moses Montefiore]]. While living in Palestine before the end of Ottoman rule, Deinard published texts and documents from manuscripts and old printed books, among them an account of anti-Jewish riots in [[Ancona, Italy]], in the late 18th century. He also published [[S. Raffaeli]]'s illustrated survey of ancient Hebrew coins, the first Hebrew book on this subject.

==''Kohelet Amerika''==
His most well known book is the two-volume ''Kohelet Amerika'', which records books of American Hebrew literature issued from 1735 to 1926. He was the first to devote attention to Hebrew books printed overseas by American authors. [[Yosef Goldman]]'s ''[[Hebrew Printing in America]]'' is set around this book. (Indeed, some have taken to calling Goldman "Deinard Junior" for their supposed over-all similarities.)

He also dealt with early Hebrew printing, recording post-incunabula, especially Italian, in ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;Atikot Yehudah'', and he wrote about the history of Hebrew bibliography and of Hebrew printing, especially in Eastern Europe. The prospectus of Deinard's last library, subsequently acquired by Harvard, also contains a listing of ceremonial Judaica which passed to the Smithsonian.

==Libraries with Deinard==
Surviving copies of Deinard's many works are scattered in libraries around the globe. No library holds a complete set, and some of his books are exceedingly rare. The largest and most comprehensive collection of Deinard works is said to be in the [[Yosef Goldman Collection]], in New York. A further almost complete collection of Deinard's works, as well as a number of extremely rare works written against him by various literary enemies, is apparently to be found in the [[Pini Dunner]] private collection in [[Los Angeles]]. The [[Hebrew Union College]] libraries in [[Cincinnati]] and Los Angeles, the [[Library of Congress]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]] in [[New York City]], and the [[Harvard University Library]] (which received donations of Deinard's texts from [[Lucius Nathan Littauer]], housed in [[Widener Library|Widener]] and [[Houghton Library|Houghton]] libraries) also have large collections of Deinard works.

'''Fabel''' is a critical term and a [[Dramaturge|dramaturgical]] technique pioneered by the twentieth-century [[Germany|German]] [[theatre practitioner]] [[Bertolt Brecht]].

''Fabel'' should not be confused with '[[fable]]', which is a form of short narrative (hence the retention of the original German spelling in its adoption into English usage). Elizabeth Wright argues that it is "a [[term of art]] which cannot be adequately translated".&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;Wright, Elizabeth. 1989. ''Postmodern Brecht: A Re-Presentation''. Critics of the Twentieth Century Ser. London and New York: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-02330-0}}. p.28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==A critical term==

As a critical term, ''fabel'' refers to an analysis of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of a [[Play (theatre)|play]]. This includes three interrelated but distinct aspects: firstly, an analysis of the events portrayed in the story. In an [[Epic Theater|epic]] production, this analysis would focus on the [[social interaction]]s between the [[Fictional character|characters]] and the [[causality]] of their [[Behavior|behaviour]] from a [[Historical materialism|historical materialist]] perspective; the ''fabel'' summarizes "the moral of the story not in a merely ethical sense, but also in a [[Political theatre|socio-political]] one".&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt; For example, in relation to Brecht's play ''[[Man Equals Man]]'' (1926), Wright argues that "[t]he ''fabel'' of this play centres on the transformation of an individual through his insertion into a collective."&lt;ref name="Wright2"&gt;Wright, Elizabeth. 1989. ''Postmodern Brecht: A Re-Presentation''. Critics of the Twentieth Century Ser. London and New York: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-02330-0}}. p.33&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, a ''fabel'' analyzes the plot from a [[Formalism (art)|formal]] and [[Semiotics|semiotic]] perspective. This includes the play's [[dramatic structure]] and its formal shaping of the events portrayed. It also includes an analysis of the semiotic fabric of the play, recognizing that it "does not simply correspond to actual events in the collective life of human beings, but consists of invented happenings [and that t]he stage figures are not simple representations of living persons, but invented and shaped in response to ideas."&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt;

Thirdly, a ''fabel'' analyzes the attitudes that the play appears to embody and articulate (in the sense of the author's, the characters' and, eventually, the company's). Brecht refers to this aspect of a play as its ''[[Gestus]]''. Analyzing a play in this way presupposes Brecht's recognition that ''every'' play encodes such attitudes; "for art to be 'unpolitical'", he argued in his "[[Little Organum for the Theater|Short Organum for the Theatre]]" (1949), "means only to ally itself with the 'ruling' group".&lt;ref name="Brecht1"&gt;[[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht, Bertolt]]. 1949. "[[Little Organum for the Theater|A Short Organum for the Theatre]]". In John Willett, ed. ''Brecht on Theatre: The Development of an Aesthetic''. London: Methuen, 1964. {{ISBN|0-413-38800-X}}. p.196.&lt;/ref&gt;

==A practical tool==

As a practical tool, ''fabels'' form part of the process of engaging with a play-text undertaken by a company when mounting a production of a play. A ''fabel'' is a piece of creative writing, usually made by a [[Dramaturge|dramaturg]] or the [[Theatre director|director]], that summarizes the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of a play in such a way as to emphasize the production’s interpretation of that play-text. It is produced in order to make clear the company's ''particular way'' of understanding and rendering the story. In this respect, it is related to the concept of [[Gestus]] (insofar as this renders an action and an attitude towards that action simultaneously); a ''fabel'' indicates the sequence of [[Gestus|gestic]] episodes that constitute the dramatic or theatrical [[narrative]].

[[Carl Weber (theatre director)|Carl Weber]], who worked as a director with [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]] at his [[Berliner Ensemble]], explains that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[w]hat he [Brecht] called ''fabel'' was the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of the play told as a sequence of interactions, describing each event in the [[dialectic]] fashion developed by [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and, in Brecht’s last years, also by [[Mao Zedong|Mao]]. This may sound quite theoretical, but in Brecht’s practice the ''fabel'' was something utterly concrete and practical. Acting, music, the visual elements of the staging, in short, everything an audience perceived, had to contribute to the storytelling and make it lucid, convincing, entertaining and ‘elegant’--as Brecht liked to put it. One result was that the [[Berliner Ensemble|Ensemble’s]] productions were quite well understood by international audiences who could not follow the German text. Brecht insisted that the [[Blocking (stage)|configuration and movement of actors]] and objects on stage should clearly ‘tell the ''fabel''’. If they were to watch a play through a glass wall blocking all sound, the audience should still be able to follow the essential story. He also insisted that each of the performance elements: acting, design, music and so forth, should remain a recognisable [[Separation of the Elements|separate entity]] while it contributed to the ''fabel''’s presentation.  Brecht liked to speak of a 'storytelling arrangement', which meant the specific [[Blocking (stage)|blocking]] of actors and all props employed in a scene. He regarded this arrangement as the most important means to achieve a clear presentation of the ''fabel'', and the term 'scenic writing' may best convey what he was aiming for. [. . .] The thorough and extremely detailed preparation included countless discussions in which a text was dissected to determine which ''fabel'' it might yield."&lt;ref name="Weber"&gt;[[Carl Weber (theatre director)|Weber, Carl]]. 1994. “Brecht and the Berliner Ensemble - the making of a model.” In Peter Thomson and Glendyr Sacks, eds. ''The Cambridge Companion to Brecht''. Cambridge Companions to Literature Ser. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-42485-2}}. p.181, 183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As Weber's reference here to 'scenic writing' suggests, a director or other company member may produce multiple ''fabels'' during the course of a production, each detailing and clarifying a different aspect of the process: a dramatic analysis; an interpretive proposal; an initial springboard position from which to initiate a process of exploration and experiment in rehearsals; a description of individual production aspects (the lighting ''fabel'', the sound ''Fabel'', the visual or scenic design ''fabel'', etc.); an account of progress made at different stages of the rehearsal process; individual actor performance and character behaviour ''fabels''. Virtually any aspect of the theatrical process of production may be explored through the use of a specific ''fabel''.

[[John Willett]], Brecht's English translator, suggests that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[t]he primary principle which [Brecht] taught his collaborators was that of the ''fabel'' or story. The chain of events must be clearly and strongly established not just in the production, but beforehand in the actual play. Where it was not clear it was up to the ‘[[Dramaturge|Dramaturg]]’ to alter the text, in order to cut unnecessary entanglements and come to the point. The play itself might be by [[George Farquhar|Farquhar]] or [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], [[Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz|Lenz]] or [[Molière]], but ‘the writer’s words are only sacred insofar as they are true’. This went for Brecht’s own words as well, and his plays were subject to continual small changes even in the course of a single run. Atmosphere and ‘psychology’ did not matter as such; everything  would emerge given a clear and credible sequence of concrete events. ‘Each scene,’ says a writer in ''Theaterarbeit'',
::is subdivided into a succession of episodes. Brecht produces as though each of these little episodes could be taken out of the play and performed on its own. They are meticulously realized, down to the smallest detail.
The chain of events had become his substitute for the tidy, comprehensive ‘[[Plot (narrative)|plot]]’. Thus the "[[A Short Organum for the Theatre|Short Organum]]":
::As we cannot invite the public to fling itself into the story as if it were a river, and let itself be swept vaguely to and fro, the individual events have to be knotted together in such a way that the knots are easily seen. The events must not succeed one another indistinguishably but must give us a chance to interpose our judgment.
‘Playing according to the sense’, the [[Berliner Ensemble|Ensemble]] calls it; and the sense is what Brecht tried to get clear in any play, first for himself and his collaborators, then for the audience too.Hence, for example, his emphasis on that side of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare’s]] work which is so often neglected: the actual story. ‘It is a long time,’ he found, ‘since our theatre played these scenes for the events contained in them; they are played only for the outbursts of temperament which the events allow.’ [. . . ]
In such conferences Brecht would get his colleagues to make a written or verbal précis of the play, and later they would have to write descriptions of an actual performance. Both were practice in distilling the incidents that count.&lt;ref name="willett"&gt;[[John Willett|Willett, John]]. 1959. ''The Theatre of Bertolt Brecht: A Study from Eight Aspects''. Rev. Ed. London: Methuen, 1977. {{ISBN|0-413-34360-X}}. p.152-153,154)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A ''fabel'' specifies, narrativizes, and objectifies the attitudes and activities involved in the process of producing a play. In doing so, it enables company members to [[Dialectics|dialecticize]] that process—in the sense that a particular ''fabel'' provides a fixed 'snapshot' of a transitory and constantly developing process in a form that enables comparisons to be made. These comparisons may be between the description in the ''Fabel'' and the reality of the production as it stands or between different ''fabels'' (which have been generated by the production either at different stages of the process or in relation to different aspects—lighting, sound, blocking, etc.---of it); for example, having produced a ''Fabel'' at the beginning of the rehearsal process, the director may return to it near the end of rehearsals to check that the production is 'telling the story' intended (or, alternatively, to clarify the ways in which that story has changed as a result of rehearsal exploration and development).

The use of ''fabels'' does not predetermine the style of production nor does it necessarily require an [[Epic theater|epic]] [[Dramatic structure|dramaturgy]] or aesthetic (the elimination of [[suspense]] and mystery,&lt;ref name="suspense"&gt;[[Walter Benjamin|Benjamin, Walter]]. 1939. "What is Epic Theatre? [Second Version]". In ''Understanding Brecht''. Trans. Anna Bostock. London: Verso, 1973. {{ISBN|0-902308-99-8}}. p.17: "[T]he suspense concerns less the ending than the separate events".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alienation effect|defamiliarization effects]], etc.), despite having originated in [[Bertolt Brecht|Brechtian]] practice. The creation of ''Fabels'' is an attempt to achieve clarity for the ''producers'' (actors, director, designers) rather than the ''audience'' (which would characterize an epic production). One may create [[psychological fiction|psychological]] (in a [[Konstantin Stanislavsky|Stanislavskian]] approach) or [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] (in an [[Antonin Artaud|Artaudian]] approach) ''fabels'' as well as the [[Sociology|social]] ones that Brecht explored.

A '''favorite son''' (or a '''favorite daughter''') is a [[politics|political]] term.

* At the quadrennial American national political party conventions, a state delegation sometimes nominates and votes for a candidate from the state, or less often from the state's region, who is not a viable candidate.

The '''Fernaig manuscript''' ({{lang-gd|Làmh-sgrìobhainn Fheàrnaig}}) is a document containing approximately 4,200 lines of verse consisting largely of political and religious themes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-204838/Fernaig-manuscript Fernaig manuscript (collection of Scottish poetry) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript was composed between 1688 and 1693 by [[Donnchadh MacRath]] in [[Wester Ross]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/news/display.var.1387482.0.0.php The Herald – Scotland's Leading Quality Daily Newspaper&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070907233733/http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/news/display.var.1387482.0.0.php |date=7 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is notable for the author's unique [[orthography]] which is, like the more famous [[Book of the Dean of Lismore]], based upon English, rather than [[Classical Gaelic]], [[phonetics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/alba/radio/cuairtean/lochaillse/lamh_sgriobhainn_fhearnaig.shtml BBC Alba – Cuairtean – Làmh-sgrìobhainn Fheàrnaig&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the manuscript has been studied, "translated" in accordance with correct Gaelic orthography and republished – for the first time in 1923 by Calum MacPhàrlainn – it has been said that it has yet to be reliably interpreted.&lt;ref name="celt.dias.ie"&gt;[http://www.celt.dias.ie/publications/cat/k/k3/essay8.html School of Celtic Studies – 50th Anniversary Report – The State of the Art&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the unusual spelling system used the manuscript is notable for several other reasons. It is the only record of [[Scottish literature|Scottish verse]] which is similar in form and nature to that practised by the [[Munster]] poets at the start of the 17th century.&lt;ref name="celt.dias.ie"/&gt; It also contains religious poems which predate the composition of the manuscript by several centuries and have been described as the only extant examples of religious verse from that period as equivalent examples recorded following [[Battle of Culloden|Culloden]] are very sparse. All other remaining records of 17th century [[Scottish literature|Gaelic verse]] were committed to paper only after surviving for a hundred years or more as part of the oral tradition.&lt;ref name="celt.dias.ie"/&gt; The manuscript contains 59 pieces with 10 being of unknown authorship, 12 attributed to [[Donnchadh MacRath|MacRath]] himself with a further 17 authors named as responsible for the rest.&lt;ref&gt; Thomson, The Companion to Gaelic Scotland pp72&lt;/ref&gt;

The manuscript, in the form of two books, is currently held by the [[University of Glasgow]] library. Prior to the university gaining possession the manuscript was held by a Matheson of Fernaig, and was thus named the Fernaig manuscript. It then passed through the hands of Dr Mackintosh-Mackay, Dr W.F. Skene and the Reverend John Kennedy of [[Isle of Arran|Arran]] who finally bequeathed it to [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, The Companion to Gaelic Scotland pp71&lt;/ref&gt; The dialect used in the text varies and seems to vary between the formal, literary style and that of the local vernacular. While it is possible that MacRath had some knowledge of Gaelic (both Scottish and Irish) manuscripts written in the literary form, the almost total lack of [[Elliptical construction|eclipses]] present in the text – which are a feature of [[Irish Gaelic]] and the main distinction between [[Differences between Scottish Gaelic and Irish|Scottish and Irish]] dialects&lt;ref name="macp 290"&gt;MacPharlain ''Lamh-Sgrìobhainn Mhic Rath'', (pp290)&lt;/ref&gt; – suggest that the author did not commit anything to paper dictated by an [[Irish language|Irish]] speaker. However the anthology does include pieces by two Irish poets who lived generations before the time of the author and this does point to some degree of familiarity by MacRath with that class of literature. The two books of the manuscript can basically be divided by the general theme of the verse found within them. The first contains mostly religious works of a literary style while the second is more political and colloquial in nature. A considerable number of the words used throughout cannot be found in modern [[Scottish Gaelic]] dictionaries but many can be found in [[Irish Gaelic]] dictionaries and Shaw's "pan-Gaelic" dictionary.&lt;ref name="macp 290"/&gt;

== Career ==
Tsagué A. is a member of several organizations such as the [[African Union]] in [[Siegerland]] (region of Germany) and African Development Initiative. She is an accredited lecturer at  Europäische Akademie NRW. In addition to her publications in the press such as Africa Positive, She organizes reading sessions in the  Siegen area. In 2008 she took part in Siegen Wittgenstein's poets and writers tour entitled "Menschen zwischen den Kulturen". She writes news, poems and novels. Her first novel, Famous Women, Unknown Co-Wives, was published in August 2009. In this novel, which takes the reader into a rich world of cultures and traditions, she talks about the discrimination of women and girls in the inheritance system in Cameroon. It also contains themes on [[polygamy]], child abuse and complicit silence.The book pleads for the adaptation of the culture that addresses the urgent problems of its time and thus participates in a debate which in African societies are dominated by the elders. This novel was nominated for the Pan-literate prize of the association "Africa Culture Rhein-Neckar".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afrika-kulturinstitut.de/index.php/kuturprojekte-2010/62-philomene-atyame|title=Die Nomminees für PANLITERATE|last=|first=|date=|year=2010|publisher=Africa Culture Rhein-Neckar e.V.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308154937/http://www.afrika-kulturinstitut.de/index.php/kuturprojekte-2010/62-philomene-atyame |archive-date=2011-03-08|dead-url=yes|access-date=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23696">'''ISO 639-3:2007''', ''Codes for the representation of names of languages&amp;nbsp;– Part 3: Alpha-3 code for comprehensive coverage of languages'', is an international standard for [[language code]]s in the [[ISO 639]] series. It defines three-letter codes for identifying languages. The standard was published by [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] on 1 February 2007.&lt;ref name="ISO status"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=39534&amp;ICS1=1&amp;ICS2=140&amp;ICS3=20 |title=ISO 639-3 status and abstract |publisher=iso.org |date=2010-07-20 |accessdate=2012-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISO 639-3 extends the [[ISO 639-2]] alpha-3 codes with an aim to cover all known [[natural language]]s. The extended language coverage was based primarily on the language codes used in the ''[[Ethnologue]]'' (volumes 10-14) published by [[SIL International]], which is now the [[registration authority]] for ISO 639-3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Maintenance agencies and registration authorities | url = http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards_development/list_of_iso_technical_committees/maintenance_agencies.htm | publisher = ISO }}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides an enumeration of languages as complete as possible, including living and extinct, ancient and constructed, major and minor, written and unwritten.&lt;ref name="ISO status" /&gt; However, it does not include [[reconstructed language]]s such as [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iso639-3.sil.org/about/types#Ancient |title=Types of individual languages – Ancient languages |publisher=sil.org |date= |accessdate=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISO 639-3 is intended for use as [[metadata]] codes in a wide range of applications. It is widely used in computer and information systems, such as the Internet, in which many languages need to be supported. In archives and other information storage, they are used in cataloging systems, indicating what language a resource is in or about. The codes are also frequently used in the linguistic literature and elsewhere to compensate for the fact that language names may be obscure or ambiguous.

== Language codes ==
{{main article|List of ISO 639-3 codes}}
ISO 639-3 includes all languages in [[ISO 639-1]] and all individual languages in [[ISO 639-2]]. ISO 639-1 and ISO 639-2 focused on major languages, most frequently represented in the total body of the world's literature. Since ISO 639-2 also includes language collections and Part 3 does not, ISO 639-3 is not a superset of ISO 639-2. Where [[ISO 639-2#B and T codes|B and T codes]] exist in ISO 639-2, ISO 639-3 uses the T-codes.

Examples:
{| class=wikitable
|-
!language||639-1||639-2 (B/T)||639-3&lt;br/&gt;type||639-3&lt;br/&gt;code

|}

{{As of|2012|4}}, the standard contains 7776 entries.&lt;ref name="Data-Files"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/download.asp |title=ISO 639-3 Code Set |publisher=Sil.org |date=2007-10-18 |accessdate=2012-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inventory  of languages is based on a number of sources including: the individual languages contained in 639-2, modern languages from the [[Ethnologue]], historic varieties, ancient languages and [[constructed language|artificial languages]] from the [[Linguist List]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/default.asp |title=ISO 639-3 |publisher=sil.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as languages recommended within the annual public commenting period.

[[Machine-readable data]] files are provided by the registration authority.&lt;ref name="Data-Files"/&gt; Mappings from ISO 639-1 or ISO 639-2 to ISO 639-3 can be done using these data files.

ISO 639-3 is intended to assume distinctions based on criteria that are not entirely subjective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/scope.asp#I |title=Scope of Denotation: Individual Languages |publisher=sil.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not intended to document or provide identifiers for dialects or other sub-language variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/scope.asp#Dialects |title=Scope of Denotation: Dialects |publisher=sil.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, judgments regarding distinctions between languages may be subjective, particularly in the case of oral language varieties without established literary traditions, usage in education or media, or other factors that contribute to language conventionalization.

== Code space ==
Since the code is three-letter alphabetic, one upper bound for the number of languages that can be represented is 26 × 26 × 26 = 17576. Since ISO 639-2 defines special codes (4), a reserved range (520) and B-only codes (23), 547 codes cannot be used in part 3. Therefore, a stricter upper bound is 17576 − 547 = 17029.

The upper bound gets even stricter if one subtracts the language collections defined in 639-2 and the ones yet to be defined in [[ISO 639-5]].

== Macrolanguages ==
{{Main article|ISO 639 macrolanguage}}

There are 56 languages in ISO 639-2 which are considered, for the purposes of the standard, to be "macrolanguages" in ISO 639-3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/scope.asp#M |title=Scope of denotation: Macrolanguages |publisher=sil.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these [[macrolanguage]]s had no individual language as defined by ISO 639-3 in the code set of ISO 639-2, e.g. 'ara' (Generic Arabic). Others like 'nor' (Norwegian) had their two individual parts ('nno' ([[Nynorsk]]), 'nob' ([[Bokmål]])) already in ISO 639-2.

That means some languages (e.g. 'arb', Standard Arabic) that were considered by ISO 639-2 to be dialects of one language ('ara') are now in ISO 639-3 in certain contexts considered to be individual languages themselves.

This is an attempt to deal with varieties that may be linguistically distinct from each other, but are treated by their speakers as two forms of the same language, e.g. in cases of [[diglossia]].

For example:
* http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=ara (Generic Arabic, 639-2)
* http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=arb (Standard Arabic, 639-3)

See&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/macrolanguages.asp |title=Macrolanguage Mappings |publisher=sil.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the complete list.

== Collective languages ==
{{See also|ISO 639-2#Collective language codes|ISO 639-5}}
"A collective language code element is an identifier that represents a group of individual languages that are not deemed to be one language in any usage context."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/scope.asp#C |title=Scope of denotation: Collective languages |publisher=sil.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; These codes do not precisely represent a particular language or macrolanguage.

While ISO 639-2 includes three-letter identifiers for collective languages, these codes are excluded from ISO 639-3. Hence ISO 639-3 is not a superset of ISO 639-2.

[[ISO 639-5]] defines 3-letter collective codes for language families and groups, including the collective language codes from ISO 639-2.

==Special codes==
{{anchor|Non-language codes}}{{anchor|Generic codes}}
Four codes are set aside in [[ISO 639-2#Special situations|ISO 639-2]] and ISO 639-3 for cases where none of the specific codes are appropriate. These are intended primarily for applications like databases where an ISO code is required regardless of whether one exists.

{|class=wikitable
|-
|mis ||uncoded languages
|-
|mul ||multiple languages
|-
|und ||undetermined languages
|-
|zxx ||no linguistic content / not applicable
|}
* &lt;code&gt;mis&lt;/code&gt; (originally an abbreviation for 'miscellaneous') is intended for languages which have not (yet) been included in the ISO standard.
* &lt;code&gt;mul&lt;/code&gt; is intended for cases where the data includes more than one language, and (for example) the database requires a single ISO code.
* &lt;code&gt;und&lt;/code&gt; is intended for cases where the language in the data has not been identified, such as when it is mislabeled or never had been labeled. It is not intended for cases such as [[Trojan language|Trojan]] where an unattested language has been given a name.
* &lt;code&gt;zxx&lt;/code&gt; is intended for data which is not a language at all, such as animal calls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/catalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2004S12 Field Recordings of Vervet Monkey Calls]. Entry in the catalog of the [http://www.ldc.upenn.edu Linguistic Data Consortium]. Retrieved 2012-09-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, 520 codes in the range &lt;code&gt;qaa&lt;/code&gt;–&lt;code&gt;qtz&lt;/code&gt; are 'reserved for local use'. For example, the [[Linguist List]] uses them for [[Extinct language|extinct languages]].  Linguist List has assigned one of them a generic value:

{|class=wikitable
|-
|qnp ||unnamed proto-language (Linguist List only)
|}

This is used for proposed intermediate nodes in a family tree that have no name.

==Maintenance processes==
The code table for ISO 639-3 is open to changes. In order to protect stability of existing usage, the changes permitted are limited to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/submit_changes.asp#Types |title=Submitting ISO 639-3 Change Requests: Types of Changes |publisher=sil.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*modifications to the reference information for an entry (including names or categorizations for type and scope),
*addition of new entries,
*deprecation of entries that are duplicates or spurious,
*merging one or more entries into another entry, and
*splitting an existing language entry into multiple new language entries.
The code assigned to a language is not changed unless there is also a change in denotation.&lt;ref name="Morey-Post-Friedman" /&gt;

Changes are made on an annual cycle. Every request is given a minimum period of three months for public review.

The ISO 639-3 Web site has pages that describe "scopes of denotation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/scope.asp |title=Scope of Denotation for Language Identifiers |publisher=sil.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[wikt:languoid|languoid]] types) and types of languages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/types.asp |title=Types of Languages |publisher=sil.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which explain what concepts are in scope for encoding and certain criteria that need to be met. For example, constructed languages can be encoded, but only if they are designed for human communication and have a body of literature, preventing requests for idiosyncratic inventions.

The registration authority documents on its Web site instructions made in the text of the ISO 639-3 standard regarding how the code tables are to be maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/changes.asp |title=ISO 639-3 Change Management |publisher=sil.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also documents the processes used for receiving and processing change requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/submit_changes.asp |title=Submitting ISO 639-3 Change Requests |publisher=sil.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A change request form is provided, and there is a second form for collecting information about proposed additions. Any party can submit change requests. When submitted, requests are initially reviewed by the registration authority for completeness.

When a fully documented request is received, it is added to a published Change Request Index. Also, announcements are sent to the general LINGUIST discussion list at Linguist List and other lists the registration authority may consider relevant, inviting public review and input on the requested change. Any list owner or individual is able to request notifications of change requests for particular regions or language families. Comments that are received are published for other parties to review. Based on consensus in comments received, a change request may be withdrawn or promoted to "candidate status".

Three months prior to the end of an annual review cycle (typically in September), an announcement is set to the LINGUIST discussion list and other lists regarding Candidate Status Change Requests. All requests remain open for review and comment through the end of the annual review cycle.

Decisions are announced at the end of the annual review cycle (typically in January). At that time, requests may be adopted in whole or in part, amended and carried forward into the next review cycle, or rejected. Rejections often include suggestions on how to modify proposals for resubmission. A public archive of every change request is maintained along with the decisions taken and the rationale for the decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/chg_requests.asp |title=ISO 639-3 Change Request Index |publisher=sil.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Linguists Morey, Post and Friedman raise various criticisms of ISO 639, and in particular ISO 639-3:&lt;ref name="Morey-Post-Friedman"&gt;{{cite conference | title = The language codes of ISO 639: A premature, ultimately unobtainable, and possibly damaging standardization | last1 = Morey | first1 = Stephen | last2 = Post | first2 = Mark W. | last3 = Friedman | first3 = Victor A. | year = 2013 | conference = PARADISEC RRR Conference | url = http://prijipati.library.usyd.edu.au/handle/2123/9838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The three-letter codes themselves are problematic, because while officially arbitrary technical labels, they are often derived from mnemonic abbreviations for language names, some of which are pejorative.  For example, [[Yemsa language|Yemsa]] was assigned the code [jnj], from pejorative "Janejero".  These codes may thus be considered offensive by native speakers, but codes in the standard, once assigned, cannot be changed.
*The administration of the standard is problematic because SIL is a missionary organization with inadequate transparency and accountability.  Decisions as to what deserves to be encoded as a language are made internally.  While outside input may or may not be welcomed, the decisions themselves are opaque, and many linguists have given up trying to improve the standard. 
*Permanent identification of a language is incompatible with language change.
*Languages and dialects often cannot be rigorously distinguished, and [[dialect continuum|dialect continua]] may be subdivided in many ways, whereas the standard privileges one choice.  Such distinctions are often based instead on social and political factors.
*ISO 639-3 may be misunderstood and misused by authorities that make decisions about people's identity and language, abrogating the right of speakers to identify or identify with their speech variety. Though SIL is sensitive to such issues, this problem is inherent in the nature of an established standard, which may be used (or mis-used) in ways that ISO and SIL do not intend.

[[Martin Haspelmath]] agrees with four of these points, but not the point about language change.&lt;ref name=Haspelmath&gt;Martin Haspelmath, [http://dlc.hypotheses.org/610 "Can language identity be standardized? On Morey et al.'s critique of ISO 639-3"], ''Diversity Linguistics Comment'', 2013/12/04&lt;/ref&gt; He disagrees because any account of a language requires identifying it, and we can easily identify different stages of a language.  He suggests that linguists may prefer to use a codification that is made at the [[wikt:languoid|languoid]] level since "it rarely matters to linguists whether what they are talking about is a language, a dialect or a close-knit family of languages."  He also questions whether an ISO standard for language identification is appropriate since ISO is an industrial organization, while he views language documentation and nomenclature as a scientific endeavor.  He cites the original need for standardized language identifiers as having been "the economic significance of translation and [[Language localisation|software localization]]," for which purposes the ISO 639-1 and 639-2 standards were established. But he raises doubts about industry need for the comprehensive coverage provided by ISO 639-3, including as it does "little-known languages of small communities that are never or hardly used in writing and that are often in danger of extinction".

==Usage==

* Wikimedia foundation: New language-based projects (e.g. Wikipedias in new languages) must have an identifier from ISO 639-1, -2, or -3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Language_proposal_policy|title=Language proposal policy|work=wikimedia.org|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Other standards that rely on ISO 639-3:
** [[IETF language tag|Language tags]] as defined by the [[IETF|Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)]], as documented in:
*** BCP 47: ''Best Current Practice 47'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47|title=BCP 47 – Tags for Identifying Languages|work=ietf.org|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes RFC 5646
*** RFC 5646, which superseded RFC 4646, which superseded [https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3066.txt RFC 3066]. (Therefore, all standards which depend on any of these 3 IETF standards now use ISO 639-3.)
** The [[EPUB|ePub]] 3.0 standard for language metadata&lt;ref name="idpf.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idpf.org/epub/30/spec/epub30-publications.html#elemdef-opf-dclanguage|title=EPUB Publications 3.0|work=idpf.org|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses Dublin Core Metadata elements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46379">The '''[[grammar]]''' of the '''[[Massachusett language]]''' shares similarities with the grammars of related Algonquian languages.  Nouns have [[gender (linguistics)|gender]] based on [[animacy]], based on the world-view of the Indians on what has spirit versus what does not. A body would be animate, but the parts of the body are inanimate. Nouns are also marked for [[obviative|obviation]], with nouns subject to the topic marked apart from nouns less relevant to the discourse. Personal pronouns distinguish three [[persons]], two numbers (singular and plural), inclusive and exclusive first-person plural, and proximate/obviative third-persons. Nouns are also marked as absentative, especially when referring to lost items or deceased persons.

Sentence structures are typically SVO or SOV, but deviation from strict word order does not alter the meaning due to the synthetic structure.&lt;ref&gt;Fermino, J. L. D. (2000). Introduction to the Wampanoag grammar. (Master's thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology). pp. 10-63.&lt;/ref&gt; Verbs are quite complex, and can be broken into four classes of verbs: animate-intransitive (AI), inanimate-intransitive (II), animate-transitive (AT), and inanimate-transitive (IT). Verbs are also prefixed and suffixed with various inflections, particles, and conjugations, so complex things can easily be described just by a verb.&lt;ref&gt;Pentland, David H. (2006). "Algonquian and Ritwan Languages", in Keith Brown, ed., Encyclopedia of Languages and Linguistics (2nd ed.), pp. 161–6. Amsterdam: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fermino, J. L. D. (2000). pp. 28-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Massachusett recognizes first, second and third person in singular and plural form.  However, like other Algonquian languages, Massachusett makes a distinction between the first person plural exclusive, 'we, excluding you' and the first person plural inclusive, 'we, including you.'  In general, the exclusive is more common when referring to oneself and one's family and network or when the audience is unknown, but the inclusive is used when the audience is definitely being referenced.

The obviate, a form of 'second third person' that disambiguates the activities of another third person in a sentence, may possess another noun which although technically a 'third third person,' has no forms that distinguish it from the unmarked proximate bare form of a noun, as opposed to more conservative languages like [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] which have a separate form for nouns in this rare position.  Similarly, there are no attested forms for obviate inanimate nouns, as exist in Ojibwe.&lt;ref&gt;Waasaagoneshkang (2001). 'Theft of Fire.' Recorded in 1974 by William Jones, translated by Rand Valentine. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Persons exist on an importance scale, which is often more important in establishing word order regarding synthetic placement of prefixes, suffixes and markers.  For example, most words exist which generally follow a hierarchy of 2 &gt; 1 &gt; X &gt; 3 &gt; 3'.&lt;ref&gt;Macaulay, M. (2005). 'On the 2 &gt; 1 Prominence Hierarchy of Algonquian' in

Nouns can only have an animate/inanimate plural or absentative animate/inanimate singular or plural terminations on a given word.  In general, the locative is the same in the singular and plural and replaces the animate/inanimate plural if any.  All nouns can have a diminutive, locative and obviative ending, although it would be rare for a word to exist with all possible forms, the order is usually diminutive, absentative/animate-inanimate plural (if any), locative, obviative.  For example, *'''''wekeesiutoh''''' *('''''weekeesayutah'''''), literally 'his-house-diminutive-absentative-locative-obviate' which would signify 'at the other man's/woman's small house—that is no more? that was destroyed?'

===Number===
Algonquian languages recognize two numbers, singular and plural.  Although it is rare for a word to not have both a singular and plural form, a small number of nouns, as in English, are either uncountable or inherently plural or singular.  This is clearest in loan words from English such as '''''monêash''''' ('''money''ash'''''), from English 'moneys,' which always appears in the plural and '''''saut''''' ('''salt'''), from English '[[salt]]' which only appears in the singular.&lt;ref&gt;Rees-Miller, J. (1996). Morphological Adaptation of English Loanwords in Algonquian. International Journal of American Linguistics, 62(2), 196-202. Retrieved 3 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nouns are unmarked in the singular, but can take one of two forms dependent on the noun's gender, which can be either [[animacy|animate]] and refer to something considered living, moving, divine or said to have spirit and [[animacy|inanimate]] including natural objects, tools and small plants.&lt;ref name="GoddardAnimate"&gt;Goddard, I. &amp; Bragdon, K. (1988). pp. 486-497.&lt;/ref&gt;  Words that are animate have '''''-ack'''''/'''''-og'''''/'''''-ak''''' ('''''-ak''''') {{IPA|/-ak/}} and those that are inanimate have '''''-ash'''''/'''''-osh''''' ('''''-ash''''') {{IPA|/-aʃ/}} appended to the end, respectively.  Although unmarked in the singular, words ''must'' have either an animate or inanimate plural, with only a few rare exceptions to this rule.&lt;ref name="Silent"&gt;Fermino, J. L. D. (2000). p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nouns in the singular often exist in a truncated form, but when any endings such as the plural are appended, many nouns will have consonants or syllables appear where unexpected, but were probably the original form of the word from its development from Proto-Algonquian.  For instance, the words 'dog,' 'man' and 'chair' appear in Massachusett as '''''annum''''' ('''''anum''''') {{IPA|/anəm/}}, '''''wosketomp''''' ('''''waskeetôp''''') {{IPA|/waskiːtãp/}} and '''''appuonk''''' ('''''apuwôk''''') {{IPA|/apuːwãk/}} in the singular but '''''anum&lt;u&gt;w&lt;/u&gt;og''''' ('''''anum&lt;u&gt;w&lt;/u&gt;ak''''') {{IPA|/anəm&lt;u&gt;w&lt;/u&gt;ak/}}, '''''wosketomp&lt;u&gt;au&lt;/u&gt;og''''' ('''''waskeetôp&lt;u&gt;â&lt;/u&gt;ak''''') {{IPA|/waskiːtãp&lt;u&gt;aː&lt;/u&gt;ak/}} and '''''appuonk&lt;u&gt;an&lt;/u&gt;ash''''' ('''''apuwôk&lt;u&gt;an&lt;/u&gt;ash''''') {{IPA|/apuːwãk&lt;u&gt;an&lt;/u&gt;aʃ/}} as 'dogs' and 'chairs,' respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Trumbull, J. H. (1903). pp. 12, 14, 292.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Silent"/&gt;  In the case of 'dog,' Massachusett '''''annum''''' ('''''anum''''') developed from Proto-Algonquian *'''''aθem&lt;u&gt;w&lt;/u&gt;a'''''&lt;ref&gt;Wiktionary. Proto-Algonquian *''[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Algonquian/a%CE%B8emwa aθemwa]''.&lt;/ref&gt; with the final *'''''-wa''''' only re-appearing in the non-truncated forms of the plural, i.e., Proto-Algonquian *'''''aθemwaki''''' and Massachusett '''''annumwak''''' ('''''anumwak''''').  As they are based on etymology, words with these non-truncated finals must be learned individually.&lt;ref name="Silent"/&gt;

===Gender and plural formation===
As seen in the plural formations, all nouns have a [[grammatical gender]] based on [[animacy]], thus nouns are either animate or inanimate.  Animate objects include human beings and their bodies, animals, trees and bushes, planetary bodies—essentially things considered to be alive, possess spirit or are mobile—whereas inanimate nouns cover most objects, body parts, natural land forms, abstract things—essentially objects that do not move, do not possess spirit and generally unable to move.&lt;ref name="GoddardAnimate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Silent"/&gt;

Numerous exceptions to this general rule exist.  The body parts '''''-ohpee''''' ('''''-apee'''''), 'hip,' '''''-úhkus''''' ('''''-uhkas'''''), 'finger nail' and '''''woskequah''''' ('''''wushkeeqâh''''') {{IPA|/wəʃkiːkʷaːh/}}, 'whale bone'; the English loan words '''''conner''''' ('''corner''') and '''''Testament''''' ('''Testament''') and the kitchen object '''''kunnommaog''''' ('''''kunumuwôk''''') {{IPA|/kənəməwãk/}}, 'ladle' or 'spoon' are all animate.  The sun and moon, despite being planetary bodies, are inanimate.  Although standing trees are animate, names of trees and species are always inanimate, thus the plural form of '''''kꝏwa''''' ('''''k8wa''''') {{IPA|/kuːwa/}}, 'pine tree,' is not *'''''kꝏwak''''' (*'''''k8wak''''') but instead '''''kꝏwash''''' ('''''k8wash''''').&lt;ref name="GoddardAnimate"/&gt;

Only a handful of words can appear with both genders, with subtle differences in meaning.  For instance, the word for 'tree' is '''''mehtog''''' ('''''muhtuq'''''), but can also mean 'wood.'  As gender is not overtly marked in the singular, this can be seen in the plural forms where '''''mehtogquog''''' ('''''muhtuqak'''''), 'trees' (that are still in the ground and living) and '''''mehtogquosh''''' ('''''muhtuqash'''''), 'trees' (that have been felled) but better translates as 'wood,' i.e., the product of a tree that is no longer living.&lt;ref&gt;Trumbull, J. H. (1903). pp. 54, 346.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another rare form is to refer to land forms, structures or locales said to have a spiritual presence, or were considered the meeting place with or dwelling of [[tutelary spirits]] were discussed in the animate gender, in essence 'personifying' or linguistically 'animating' them.  For example, '''''wadchuash''''' ('''''wachuwash'''''), 'mountains,' is the inanimate plural, but when it appears as *'''''wadchuog''''' ('''''wachuwak''''') in the animate plural, it signifies 'mountains' but specifically the 'spirit(s) of the mountains.'  This latter feature only appears in religious and ceremonial usage and is only known from a few examples, but was likely more common prior to the introduction of Christianity and the English missionary influences.&lt;ref name="GoddardAnimate"/&gt;

===Case===
====Obviation====
Massachusett, just as in other Algonquian languages, marks second third persons with an [[obviative]] marker '''''-oh''''' ('''''-ah''''') {{IPA|/ah/}}.  The proximate, usually the primary subject or more important topic is left unmarked.  In English, for example, 'He gives the book to me, then I give the money to him,' it is ambiguous if the man receiving the money is the same as the giver of the book or a different man present, but in Massachusett, the person giving the book would be proximate and thus unmarked and the recipient of the money would be marked for obviation and removing the ambiguity.

The noun marked for obviation tends to be the possessed, not the possessor, and also tends to be the less animate or the recipient of a particular action.  For example, '''''mosq nâau ahtuck&lt;u&gt;oh&lt;/u&gt;''''' ('''''masq nâwâw ahtuhq&lt;u&gt;ah&lt;/u&gt;''''') {{IPA|/mask naːwaːw ahtəhkʷah/}}, 'The bear sees the deer.'&lt;ref&gt;Fermino, J. L. D. (2000). pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Like the word 'deer' in English, which may refer to the animal in the singular and collectively, the obviative forms are identical in the singular and the plural and have to be differentiated by context.  Nouns which are truncated are restored, as with the plural endings, so '''''anum''''' ('''''anum'''''), 'dog' and plural '''''anum&lt;u&gt;w&lt;/u&gt;og''''' ('''''anum&lt;u&gt;w&lt;/u&gt;ak''''') and '''''appuonk''''' ('''''apuwônk''''') and plural '''''appuonkanash''''' ('''''apuwônkanash'''''), 'chairs' become '''''annum&lt;u&gt;w&lt;/u&gt;oh''''' ('''''anum&lt;u&gt;w&lt;/u&gt;ah''''') {{IPA|/anəm&lt;u&gt;w&lt;/u&gt;ah/}} and '''''appuonk&lt;u&gt;an&lt;/u&gt;ah''''' ('''''apuwônkan&lt;u&gt;ah&lt;/u&gt;''''') {{IPA|/apuːãnkanah/}}, respectively, when marked for obviation.  This can occur in verbs as well:&lt;ref&gt;Fermino, J. L. D. (2000). pp. 54-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proximate'''
* '''''Nꝏwoman kuh nꝏwamanug'''''. ('''''Nuwâmôn kah nuwâmônuq'''''.) 
* 'I love her and she loves me.' 
* Literally 'I-love-(animate 'her') and me-love-she'
* '''''nunnechanunnonog'''''. ('''''nuneechônunônak'''''.)
* 'Our (exclusive) children'
* Literally 'my-child-plural exclusive-[r]en'

'''Obviate'''
* '''''Nꝏwoman kuh nꝏwamanug&lt;u&gt;oh&lt;/u&gt;'''''. ('''''Nuwamôn kah nuwamônuq&lt;u&gt;ah&lt;/u&gt;'''''.) 
* 'I love her and she loves me.' 
* Literally 'I-love-(animate 'her') and me-love-she-[obviative] (obviative 'other she')', suggesting a love triangle.
* '''''Nunnechanunnonog wunnechannooah''''' ('''''Nuneechanunônak wuneechanuwôwah'''''.)
* 'Our (exclusive) children's children.'''''
* Literally 'Our [exclusive]-child[r]-en their-child[r]-en-[obviative] (obviative 'children of other they' distinct from 'our children')'

'''Proximate of obviate''' (third third-person)
* '''''Nunnechanunnonog wunnechannooah wunnechanuwauwog'''''. ('''''Nuneechanunônak wuneechanuwôwah wuneechanuwôwak'''''.)
* 'Our (exclusive) children's children's children.''''' (children of our children's children)
* Literally 'Our [exclusive]-child[r]-en their-child[r]-en-[obviative] their-child[r]-en.' (obviative 'children of other they' distinct from 'our children' but proximate 'their-children')
* '''''Nꝏsh ꝏshoh umisses'''''. ('''''N8sh 8shah umuhsees'''''.)
* 'my father's father's sister.' (referring to paternal great aunt) 
* Literally 'My-father his-father-[obviative] 'his-sister.' (obviative 'his-father' but proximate 'his-sister')

====Absentation====
Algonquian languages mark those objects that were, i.e., people or living things that are deceased and objects that are lost, stolen or destroyed, or 'absent,' as opposed to those that currently exist.  For people and animate objects, it generally refers to something alive that has [[death|passed away]].  Items that are destroyed, beyond repair or lost forever tend to be inanimate objects.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, I., &amp; Bragdon, K. (1988). pp. 494, 506-508.&lt;/ref&gt;  All nouns, whether animate or inanimate, are marked with the suffixes '''''-i''''' or '''''-y''''' ('''''-ay''''') {{IPA|/aj/}} in the singular and '''''-uk''''' or '''''-ug''''' ('''''-uk''''') {{IPA|/-ək/}} in the plural.  With the same forms, a noun's animacy must be known or determined from context.  Truncated noun stems are also restored before absentative endings, so '''''woskétomp''''' ('''''waskeetôp''''') {{IPA|/waskiːtãp/}} is restored before becoming '''''woskétomp&lt;u&gt;á&lt;/u&gt;ay''''' ('''''waskeetôp&lt;u&gt;â&lt;/u&gt;ay''''') {{IPA|/waskiːtãp&lt;u&gt;aː&lt;/u&gt;aj/}}, 'man' (that is passed away).&lt;ref&gt;Fermino, J. L. D. (2000). p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Animate'''
* '''''kꝏsh&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;''''' ('''''k8sh&lt;u&gt;ay&lt;/u&gt;''''') {{IPA|/kuːʃaj/}}, 'your (singular) late father'
* '''''nussontimminon&lt;u&gt;uk&lt;/u&gt;''''' ('''''nusôtyumunôn&lt;u&gt;uk&lt;/u&gt;''''') {{IPA|/nəsãtjəmənãnək/}}, 'our (exclusive) deceased sachems'

'''Inanimate'''
* '''''uméquonn&lt;u&gt;ai&lt;/u&gt;''''' ('''''umeequn&lt;u&gt;ay&lt;/u&gt;''''') {{IPA|/əmiːkʷən&lt;u&gt;aj&lt;/u&gt;/}}, 'his feather' (that was lost? that was destroyed?)
* '''''wuttuhquaunn&lt;u&gt;ick&lt;/u&gt;''''' ('''''wutuhqôn&lt;u&gt;uk&lt;/u&gt;''''') {{IPA|/wətəhkʷãnək/}} 'her hooks' (that were lost? that were destroyed?)

====Diminution====
Nouns can be marked with one of two [[diminutive]] endings, '''''-ees''''' ('''''-ees''''') {{IPA|/iːs/}} or '''''-emes''''' ('''''-âmees''''') {{IPA|/aːmiːs/}}, with the latter form chosen for more extreme examples or euphony.  These endings indicate that the noun is smaller, littler or younger.  For example, '''''nonkomp''''' ('''''nôkôp''''') {{IPA|/nãkãp/}}, 'boy,' '''''nonkomp&lt;u&gt;ees&lt;/u&gt;''''' ('''''nôkôp&lt;u&gt;ees&lt;/u&gt;''''') {{IPA|/nãkãp&lt;u&gt;iːs&lt;/u&gt;/}}, 'young boy' and '''''nonkomp&lt;u&gt;amees&lt;/u&gt;''''' ('''''nôkôp&lt;u&gt;âmees&lt;/u&gt;''''') {{IPA|/nãkãp&lt;u&gt;aːmiːs&lt;/u&gt;/}}, a 'very young boy.'  Although rare in the written language, which may have thus protected against its complete intrusion in the spoken language, late-stage speakers along the western and northern transitional dialects permitted [[syncope (phonology)|syncope]] and the diminutive ending is often truncated, as seen in the surname of [[Crispus Attucks]], '''''Attuck'''''['''''ee''''']'''''s''''' ('''''Ahtuq'''''['''''ee''''']'''''s'''''), 'Little Deer,' and '''''wachu'''''['''''ee''''']'''''s''''' ('''''wachu'''''['''''w''''']['''''ee''''']'''''s'''''), 'small mountain' or 'hill' as in the example of [[Mount Wachusett]], a Native toponym from the closely related Nipmuc-speaking peoples where syncope was generally permitted.

The use of the diminutive, as in extant Algonquian languages, may have had some semantic functions that varied between dialects.  Although it is the general rule to use diminutive endings on small, young and little things, examples from other Algonquian languages such as [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] indicate that it can be used as a term of endearment, such as '''''n'nechan&lt;u&gt;emes&lt;/u&gt;''''' ('''''nuneechan&lt;u&gt;âmees&lt;/u&gt;''''') {{IPA|/nəniːtʃan&lt;u&gt;aːmiːs&lt;/u&gt;/}}, 'my little child,' but can also be used, in certain contexts, to mark something as inferior or degrading, such as '''''keen wosketomp&lt;u&gt;ees&lt;/u&gt;''''' ('''''keeen waskeetôp&lt;u&gt;ees&lt;/u&gt;''''') {{IPA|/kiːn waskiːtãp&lt;u&gt;iːs&lt;/u&gt;/}}, 'you little man' but could have nuanced implied meanings of being weak, small in stature, inferior or unworthy dependent on context.

====Location====
Nouns are suffixed with a [[locative case|locative]] suffix '''''-et''''' (also '''''-ett''''', '''''-it''''', etc.) ('''''-ut''''') to indicate 'in/on/at' (physically).  It can be used to mark areas near certain geographical features, and survives in the name '''''Massachus&lt;u&gt;ett&lt;/u&gt;''''' ('''''Mâsach8s&lt;u&gt;ut&lt;/u&gt;''''') {{IPA|/maːsatʃuːsət/}} as well as most geographical place names and landmarks of Massachusett-language derivation. The locative is often, though not alwayss, identical in singular and the plural and number has to be determined from context.&lt;ref&gt;Fermino, J. L. D. (2000). p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GoddardLocative"&gt;Goddard, I., &amp; Bragdon, K. (1988). p. 506-507.&lt;/ref&gt;

The choice of locative seems to have some dialectal variation, where the older form '''''-uck'''''/'''''-og'''''/'''''-uk''''' ('''''-uk''''') was generally more common in the speech of Nantucket and areas inhabited by the Nauset, and seems to have occurred with equal frequency in the related L-dialect Nipmuc language and areas inhabited by the Pawtucket.  Areas inhabited by the Coweset, Massachusett and the closely related Y-dialect Narragansett seem to have been strongholds of the {{IPA|/-ət/}} termination, although documents in Natick seem to have also used the {{IPA|/-ək/}} variant, perhaps due to the influence of Nipmuc.  As the written language of Eliot seems to have favored {{IPA|/-ət/}}, most place names in the region in Massachusetts were 'standardized' under the influence of the literate Indians and the English missionaries.&lt;ref name="GoddardLocative"/&gt;

There is a rare secondary locative '''''-ehtu''''' ('''''-eehtyuw''''') {{IPA|/iːhtʲᵊəw/}} or '''''-uhkontu''''' ('''''-uhkôhtyuw''''') that only appears in a handful of attestations in the Native documents.&lt;ref name="GoddardLocative"/&gt;  It seems to have been somewhat more common in Eliot's translation of the Bible, where it seems to serve the purpose of a plural locative.  For example, '''''ayeuwog&lt;u&gt;ut&lt;/u&gt;''''', 'in/on/at the place,' and '''''nuppee&lt;u&gt;it&lt;/u&gt;''''', 'in/on/at the water' and '''''ayeuongan&lt;u&gt;ehtu&lt;/u&gt;''''' ('''''ayuwôkan&lt;u&gt;eehtyuw&lt;/u&gt;'''''), 'in/on/at the places,' and '''''nippe&lt;u&gt;kontu&lt;/u&gt;''''' ('''''nupee&lt;u&gt;hkôhtyuw&lt;/u&gt;''''') {{IPA|/nəpiː&lt;u&gt;hkãtjəw&lt;/u&gt;/}}, 'in/on/at the water&lt;u&gt;s&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Trumbull, J. H. (1903). pp. 307, 341.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, N. (2006). pp. 7, 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GoddardLocative"/&gt;

The locative can be used for abstract phrases, such as 'in his posterity' and 'on this day' and these phrases can be literally translated from English.  The locative, however, is also mandatory for certain transitive verbs that do not have an English parallel.

'I place a door on my house.'
* '''''Nupponam usquont neek&lt;u&gt;itt&lt;/u&gt;''''' ('''''Nup8num usqôt neek&lt;u&gt;ut&lt;/u&gt;''''') {{IPA|/nəpuːnəm əskʷãt niːk&lt;u&gt;ət&lt;/u&gt;/}}
* dialectal '''''neek&lt;u&gt;uck&lt;/u&gt;''''' ('''''neek&lt;u&gt;uk&lt;/u&gt;''''') {{IPA|/niːk&lt;u&gt;ək&lt;/u&gt;/}}
* Literally, 'I-put-it door my-house-[locative]' (locative 'in/on/at my house')

'I am fishing in your canoe.'
* '''''N'taumam kumishꝏn&lt;u&gt;it&lt;/u&gt;''''' ('''''Nutômôm kumuhsh8nut''''') {{IPA|/nətãmãm kəməhʃuːnət/}}
* dialectal '''''kumishꝏn&lt;u&gt;ucke&lt;/u&gt;''''' ('''''kumuhsh8n&lt;u&gt;uk&lt;/u&gt;''''') {{IPA|/kəməuhʃuːn&lt;u&gt;ək&lt;/u&gt;/}}
* Literally, 'I-fish you-canoe-in' (locative 'in/on/at your canoe')

'On this day'
* '''''yeu kesuk&lt;u&gt;od&lt;/u&gt;''''' ('''''y8 keesuk&lt;u&gt;ut&lt;/u&gt;''''') {{IPA|/juː kiːsək&lt;u&gt;ət&lt;/u&gt;/}}
* dialectal '''''keesuk&lt;u&gt;ok&lt;/u&gt;''''' ('''''keesuk&lt;u&gt;uk&lt;/u&gt;''''') {{IPA|/kiːsək&lt;u&gt;ək&lt;/u&gt;/}}
* Literally, 'this day-in' (locative 'in/on/at this day')

'We (inclusive) go to the sachem's village'
* '''''kutóminn sonchim ꝏtann&lt;u&gt;it&lt;/u&gt;''''' ('''''kutômun sôtyum wut8tan&lt;u&gt;ut&lt;/u&gt;''''') {{IPA|/kətãmən sãtjəm wətuːtan&lt;u&gt;ət&lt;/u&gt;/}}
* dialectal '''''ꝏtann&lt;u&gt;uk&lt;/u&gt;''''' ('''''wut8tan&lt;u&gt;uk&lt;/u&gt;''''') {{IPA|/wətuːtan&lt;u&gt;ək&lt;/u&gt;/}}
* Literally 'his-village-in' (locative 'in/on/at his village')
* In this case, the locative is used in directional verbs to mean 'to' as in 'towards the ....'

'I resemble my father.'
* nutoqueneoquiss nꝏsh&lt;u&gt;utt&lt;/u&gt; ('''''nutaquneôqus n8sh&lt;u&gt;ut&lt;/u&gt;''''') {{IPA|/nətakʷənjᵊãkʷəs nuːʃ&lt;u&gt;ət&lt;/u&gt;/}}
* dialectal '''''nꝏsh&lt;u&gt;ick&lt;/u&gt;''''' ('''''n8sh&lt;u&gt;uk&lt;/u&gt;''''')
* Literally, 'I-resemble my-father-in' (locative 'in/on/at my father')

The prefixes, suffixes and infixes on nouns shown in the table under nouns determine ownership are used as genitive constructions, equivalent to 'my,' 'our,' 'ours,' 'his,' 'her,' 'hers,' 'its', 'their,' 'theirs' used in English.  As previously states, the third-person form '''''wu-''''' ('''''wu-''''') is truncated to '''''u-''''' ('''''u-''''') or, with sufficient context, sometimes dropped altogether in certain situations, so '''''meequon''''' ('''''meeqôn''''') is '''''umeequon''''' ('''''umeeqôn''''') and ''never'' *'''''wumeequon''''' (*'''''wumeeqôn''''').  Both of the first-person plural forms have an ending ('''''-un'''''), which are otherwise distinguished by ('''''nu-'''''), equivalent to 'I'.&lt;ref name="pro"&gt;Fermino, J. L. D. (2000). pp. 17-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plural persons are formed with suffixes.  For example, 'our' can be formed with '''''nu-'''''[stem]'''''-un''''', 'I-[stem]-first-person plural' in the exclusive  form or '''''ku-'''''[stem]'''''-un''''', 'you-[stem]-[1st pl.] in the inclusive form.  The inclusive form actually shares '''''ku-''''', the second-person prefix, as the construction 'you-[stem]-[1st pl.],' somewhat suggesting 'you + us' as it would naturally include the audience or person being addressed in a description of a group action including the speaker.  The second-person plural and third-person plural are formed with ('''''ku-''''') and ('''''wu-''''') or its variant ('''''u-''''')—used before /m/, /p/, /k/ or /w/, but not /kʷ/—respectively.  They also share use of the second/third-person plural suffix ('''''-uw''''').&lt;ref name="pro"/&gt;

Plural personhood in the dependency markers requires an infix, which wedges itself between the suffix appended to the stem and the peripheral markers, such as those that indicate the animate or inanimate plural, depending on the word's gender or absentative, locative or obviative forms.  The first-person exclusive and first-person inclusive plurals share ('''''-ôn-''''') whilst the second- and third-person plurals share ('''''-ôw-''''').  This prevents the previous stem from truncation or elimination, according to the complicated sound rules for joining morphemes and the influence of surrounding vowels.  Thus, 'our (exclusive) feet' is ('''''nuseetun&lt;u&gt;ôn&lt;/u&gt;ash''''') and not (*'''''nuseetunash''''') and 'your (plural) feet' is ('''''kuseetuw&lt;u&gt;ôw&lt;/u&gt;ash''''') and not (*'''''kuseetuwash''''').&lt;ref name="pro"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fermino, J. L. D. (2000). pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dependent and Independent nouns===
Nouns are declined by person somewhat differently depending on whether or not the noun in question is dependent or independent.  For example, a 'foot' always belongs to someone and therefore, in Algonquian languages, it can only exist in a genitive construction such as 'my foot,' 'your feet,' 'his foot,' etc., and is therefore 'dependent.'  When the exact owner is unknown, ('''''mu-''''') is attached and indicates 'someone's' or 'somebody's' foot.  Dependency is a common feature of kinship terms such as 'mother' or 'father,' almost all body parts, including the body itself.  Most other nouns are independent and can exist by themselves, although they can also be declined in genitive constructions, such as a 'tree' can be owned as 'my tree' or 'his tree' that do exist without implied ownership.

====Intrusive 't'====
As a grammatical rule, a {{IPA|/t/}} is inserted before the prefix that implies the person and an independent noun stem that begins with a vowel.  For example, '''''nu&lt;u&gt;t&lt;/u&gt;ohkeem''''' ('''''nu&lt;u&gt;t&lt;/u&gt;ahkeem'''''), 'my land' where '''''ohke''''' ('''''ahkee'''''), 'earth' or 'land' is independent.  This is in contrast to '''''nꝏsh''''' ('''''n8sh'''''), 'my father,' which does not require the 'intrusive t' as it is a dependent noun, i.e., not *'''''nu&lt;u&gt;t&lt;/u&gt;ꝏsh''''' (*'''''nu&lt;u&gt;t&lt;/u&gt;8sh''''') which are incorrect.

The example of 'my father' also shows that vowel-initial dependent noun roots assimilate the vowel of the person prefix, '''''nꝏsh''''' ('''''n8sh''''') ''not'' *'''''nuꝏsh''''' (*'''''nu8sh'''''). When a dependent noun has ownership that is not implied or unknown, the Algonquian X person, it is prefixed with '''''mu-''''' which indicates that it is 'someone's' or 'somebody's,' for instance, '''''&lt;u&gt;m&lt;/u&gt;usseett''''' ('''''&lt;u&gt;m&lt;/u&gt;useet''''') {{IPA|/&lt;u&gt;m&lt;/u&gt;əsiːt/}}, 'someone's foot' or 'somebody's foot.'  Dependent nouns that begin with a consonant do not assimilate the preceding vowel, e.g., '''''kunnutcheg''''' ('''''kunucheek''''') {{IPA|/kənətʃiːk/}}, 'your (singular) hand.'  Dependent nouns have to be learned separately.

====M-class==== 
A small 'm-class' of independent nouns also exist.  This small subset of words takes a final ('''''-m''''') in words that end in a vowel or ('''''-um''''') for words that end in a consonant, but only when the word is declined for person.  This terminal is dropped when the noun exists in its, non-pronominally declined independent form.  This was likely a retention of an archaic trait in the language that began to fade from the language around the time literacy was adopted, as the Indian documents show that many writers applied it inconsistently and seem to have been unsure, although it is just as likely that it may have varied by dialect or age of speaker.  Where it was retained, the /m/ helps preserve noun stems from mutation or assimilation of vowels of various noun suffixes.&lt;ref&gt;Fermino, J. L. D. (2000). pp. 16, 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''wadchu''''' ('''''wachuw''''') {{IPA|/watʃəw/}} 'mountain'
* '''''nuwadchu&lt;u&gt;m&lt;/u&gt;ash''''' ('''''nuwachuw&lt;u&gt;um&lt;/u&gt;ash''''') {{IPA|/nəwatʃəw&lt;u&gt;əm&lt;/u&gt;aʃ/}} 'my mountains'

* '''''ohkeash''''' ('''''ahkeeash'''''), 'lands.'

* '''''kehtassꝏtak''''' ('''''keehtahs8tak'''''), 'kings'

The Algonquian languages are [[pro-drop languages]] which means that independent pronouns are usually unnecessary in conversation.  Nouns can be inflected for possession and verbs often encode the subject, and sometimes, even the object information, rendering the use of pronouns mostly redundant.  There are several instances where pronouns cannot be omitted.  For instance, Massachusett lacks a copula which is found in English as the various conjugations of the verb 'to be' that link the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]].  Thus, a pronoun would be mandatory in sentences such as '''''kén nétop''''' ('''''keen neetôp''''') {{IPA|/kiːn niːtãp/}}, 'you are my friend,' but literally 'you my-friend.  The pronouns are also mandatory as the direct answers to questions involving figuring out who was doing what or what was done to whom.

In a sentence such as '''''nuwoman''''' ('''''nuwâmôn'''''), the transitive animate verb '''''woman''''' ('''''wâmôn''''') is marked with the first-person prefix ('''''nu-''''') marks the subject.  The third-person recipient, 'her' or 'him' is assumed because it is an animate verb.  Even though, '''''nen nuwoman nagum''''' or '''''neen nagum nuwoman''''' are possible, literally 'I I-love-[her/him] her/him' and 'I he/she I-love-[her/him],' respectively, enough information exists in the verb alone to warrant the exclusion of the pronouns.

Although the exact roles that the pronouns filled are not fully understood, in related Algonquian languages, pronouns seem to help clear ambiguity, such as the similarity of certain verb forms and noun stems, some of which may differ by only a short syllable at the end, such as ('''''kuseet''''') 'your (singular) foot,' ('''''kuseetun''''') 'our (inclusive) foot' and ('''''kuseetuw'''''), which in rapid conversation, may require the independent pronouns ('''''keen''''') 'you (singular)', ('''''keenawun''''') 'we (inclusive)' and ('''''keenaw''''') 'you (plural)' to disambiguate.  In other cases, the insertion of pronouns were probably used for emphasis, such as a topical marker, or to mark deference as is done in other Algonquian languages.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, I., &amp; Bragdon, K. (1988). p. 507.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gustuffson, H. S. (2000). pp. 50-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emphasis'''&lt;br&gt;
The pronoun helps mark the topic and the emphasis of the statement.  More important in the following example is not the canoe itself but the ownership of the canoe by the owner.
* '''''Numishꝏn.  Numishꝏn &lt;u&gt;neen&lt;/u&gt;.'''''
* ('''''Numuhsh8n.  Numuhsh8n &lt;u&gt;neen&lt;/u&gt;.'''''
* 'My canoe. My canoe is '''mine''''
* Literally 'My-canoe. My-canoe I.'

'''Deference'''&lt;br&gt;
Possibly used to mark the noun ('''''sôtyum'''''), 'chief' or 'leader,' as someone worthy of respect or importance.
* '''''Kusontimman naum sépu.  &lt;u&gt;Nâgum&lt;/u&gt; kusontimman naum sépu.'''''
* ('''''Kusôtyumun nâm seepuw.  &lt;u&gt;Nâkum&lt;/u&gt; kusôtyumun nâm seepuw.''''') 
* 'Our ''sachem'' (inclusive) sees the river. '''He''', our (inclusive) sachem, sees the river.'
* Literally, '[He] sees river. He our-sachem-[inclusive] he-sees river.'

'''Disambiguation'''&lt;br&gt;
Although the difference between 'your father' and 'our (inclusive) fathers' (obviative) is slight, 
* '''''Kꝏsh matta kꝏshunocke.  &lt;u&gt;Keen&lt;/u&gt; kꝏsh matta kꝏshunog.'''''
* ('''''K8sh mata k8shunak.  &lt;u&gt;Keen&lt;/u&gt; k8sh mata &lt;u&gt;keenawun&lt;/u&gt; k8shunakah.''''') 
* 'Your father not our (inclusive) fathers. '''You''', your father, not our (inclusive) fathers.'
* Literally 'Your-father not our-father-s.  You your-father not our-father-[inclusive]-s-[obviative].' (not all of our (inclusive) fathers, only yours alone)

* Only singular forms are attested in the Massachusett-language documents, but evidence from related languages suggest they may have occurred in the language, but this is uncertain.&lt;ref name="NipmucReflexive"&gt;Gustuffson, H. S. (2000). p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflexive pronouns are relatively uncommon.  There only use appears with certain transitive animate verbs where the subject is also the recipient of the action.  This is in stark contrast to languages such as Spanish or French, where reflexive verbs, and their accompanying reflexive pronoun markers, are quite common, often imbued with slightly different shades of meaning from there original non-reflexive counterparts.&lt;ref name="FerminoPronoun"/&gt;

In Massachusett, reflexive pronouns are only known in singular form, but plural forms are attested in closely related language.  For instance, in the [[Loup language]] of Nipmuc refugees in [[New France]], '''''nahakanon''''', 'ourselves' (first person exclusive plural reflexive) appears in Mathevet's word lists recorded in the mid-eighteenth century.&lt;ref name="NipmucReflexive"/&gt; if it existed in Massachusett would probably appear as *'''''nuhhoggan''''' (*'''''nuhakun''''') {{IPA|/*nəhakən/}} as Massachusett usually dropped the infix '''''-on''''' unless further suffixation as required but retained in Nipmuc which corresponds to Massachusett ('''''-ôn'''''), e.g., ('''''nuseetun'''''), 'our (exclusive) foot' and ('''''nuseetunônash'''''), 'our (exclusive) feet.'&lt;ref name="NipmucReflexive"/&gt;

* '''''Wussusséquin wuhhog'''''
('''''Wususeequn wuhak''''') {{IPA|/wəsəsiːkʷən wəhak/}}&lt;br&gt;
'He anoints himself.' Literally, 'He-anoints his-self'

'I love myself.' Literally, 'I-love my-self.'

The [[deixis|deictic]] pronouns are used to express both specific objects and their physical distance in relation to the speaker, with the nearer deictic pronouns corresponding to English 'this' and plural 'these.' Objects that are too far for a speaker to use nearer deictic forms, such as objects 'over there' or 'yonder,' the farther deictic forms 'that' and 'those.'

The anaphoric pronouns were unknown to most dialects and is peculiar to the speech of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, but has been adopted as integral pronouns in the revived language.  Their usage on the islands had two main uses.  In some cases, they seem to represent 'furthest deictic,' roughly 'that'/'those' (over there) akin to the Spanish distinction between ''ese'', 'that' and ''aquel'', 'that yonder.'  It also served in its anaphoric usage to reference 'this' or 'that' when the context was known and discussed earlier in conversation or in a written document.  The anaphoric forms have obviate markings.  As inanimate obviate marking is not used in Massachusett, the inanimate anaphoric forms ('''''y8nuh''''') and ('''''shanuh''''') perhaps have them by analogy to their animate counterparts.

The interrogative pronouns function as question words, such as 'who?', 'whom?' and 'what?'  The interreogative pronouns in statements take different meanings, for instance '''''teague''''' ('''''tyaqa''''') generally means 'what?' or 'what thing?' but also functions as 'something' as in '''''howan''''' ('''''hawân''''') can, in non-interrogative functions, as 'somebody' or 'someone.'

===Nominalization of verbs===
As verbs are the basic and most important part of Massachusett word construction, nouns are often formed from verbs or can exist in verbal form, for example 'I am the chief' can be rendered with only nouns, and in an archaic style befitting a leader, '''''sachem neen''''' ('''''sôtyum neen'''''), literally ''[[sachem]]'' I,' or only with a verb as in '''''nusontimauw''''' ('''''nusôtyumâw'''''), literally 'I-chief-[animate intransitive verb]' or 'I-chief-be.' Although use of nominal versus verbal constructions were used interchangeably, they undoubtedly had distinct nuances in use that are unknown.

Conversion of nouns from verbal stems can occur in one of three ways.  Nouns tend to be either the bare form of a verb, identical to the verbal form or modified with a nominalizing suffix.

'''Bare verb stem''' 
* '''''mꝏs''''' ('''''m8s'''''), 'moose' or 'Eurasian elk' &lt; '''''mꝏsua-''''' ('''''m8swa-'''''), 'to shear' or 'to trim smooth'
* '''''nꝏht''''' ('''''n8ht'''''), 'fire' &lt; '''''nꝏhtau''''' ('''''n8htâw'''''), 'it burns.'
* '''''chog''''' ('''''chahk'''''), 'spot' &lt; '''''chogui''''' ('''''chahkâyu-'''''), 'to be spotted'

'''Identical to verbal form'''
* '''''pittu''''' ('''''putyuw''''') '[[pitch (resin)|pitch]]' (pine resin) = '''''pittu''''' ('''''putyuw'''''),'it is pitch'
* '''''sokunon''''' ('''''s8kunôn'''''), '[[rain]]' = '''''sokunon''''' ('''''s8kunôn'''''), 'it rains.'
* '''''sepu''''' ('''''seepuw'''''), 'river' = '''''sepu''''' ('''''seepuw'''''), 'it spreads long.'

'''Nominalized with ''-onk''''' ('''''-ôk''''')'''
* '''''chipwuttꝏnapwaonk''''' ('''''chupwut8napwaôk'''''), 'kiss,' &gt; '''''chipwuttꝏnapw-''''' ('''''chupwut8napw-'''''), 'to kiss by mouth'
* '''''appuonk''''' ('''''apuwôk'''''), 'chair' &gt; '''''appu-''''' ('''''apu-'''''), 'to sit'
* '''''wussohquohwonk''''' ('''''wusuhqahwôk'''''), 'book' &gt; ('''''wusuhqahw-'''''), 'to write' (with a tool)

==Verbs==
===Verb categories===
Verbs are very complex and form the basis of a typical word.  Like nouns, verbs are divided into animate and inanimate forms which are distinct in meaning and usage.  For example, '''''chog-''''' ('''''chahk-'''''), 'spot,' has different conjugations based on the animacy of the subject.  An inanimate object, such as a body part, rock, leaf, man-made products, annual plants, etc., would be described as '''''chogi''''' ('''''chahkây'''''), 'it is spotted' (i.e., 'it has spots') whereas when referring to people, animals, large trees, planetary bodies, etc., it would be described as '''''chogusu''''' ('''''chahkusuw'''''), 'he/she/it is blemished' (literally, 'he/she is spotted').  As different verb endings are used to distinguish animacy, the subject or equivalent pronoun can be dropped in conversation and writing if there is sufficient context.

Transitivity is another important division.  Verbs are marked differently if they take an object or not.  For example, the root '''''mꝏs-''''' ('''''m8hs-''''') implies 'envy' or 'jealousy' but and can be found as intransitive, not requiring an object, '''''mꝏsumꝏau''''' ('''''m8hsumuwâw'''''), 'he/she is jealous' (i.e., 'he/she/it is a jealous person) or transitive, requiring an object, '''''mꝏsumꝏ''''' ('''''m8hsumuw'''''), 'he/she is jealous &lt;u&gt;of&lt;/u&gt;' and requires an object, e.g., '''''mꝏsumꝏ sontimoh''''' ('''''m8hsumuw sôtyumah'''''), 'he/she is jealous &lt;u&gt;of&lt;/u&gt; the chief.'

Transitive and intransitive verbs differ when the object in question is animate or inanimate.  For example, the root '''''onch-''''' ('''''ôch-'''''), signifies 'mend,' 'fix' or 'repair,' and appears as transitive with animate object '''''onchheew''''' ('''''ôchuheew'''''), 'he/she repairs [something]' and transitive with inanimate object '''''onchuteaw''''' ('''''ôchuhteaw'''''), 'he/she fixes (someone).'  Similarly, '''''quin-''''' ('''''qun-'''''), 'long' or 'tall,' appears in the intransitive, no object, with animate subject '''''qunôsu''''' ('''''qunôhsuw'''''), 'he/she is tall,' and inanimate subject, no object, '''''quinni''''' ('''''qunây'''''), 'it is long' or 'it is tall'.  Thus, verbs generally fall into one of four categories: animate subject, no object or animate intransitive (AI), animate object or transitive animate (TA), inanimate with no object or inanimate intransitive (II) and inanimate object or transitive inanimate (TI).

A '''mole''' is a massive structure, usually of [[Rock (geology)|stone]], used as a [[pier]], [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]], or a [[causeway]] between places separated by water.  The word comes from [[Middle French]] ''mole'', ultimately from Latin ''mōlēs'', meaning a large mass, especially of rock; it has the same root as [[molecule]] and [[mole (unit)|mole]], the chemical unit of measurement.&lt;ref&gt;John Simpson (ed), [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/120837 "mole, ''n.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''"], ''Oxford English Dictionary Online'', retrieved 8 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  A mole may have a wooden structure built on top of it that resembles a wooden pier.  The defining feature of a mole, however, is that water cannot freely flow underneath it, unlike a true pier. The oldest known mole is at [[Wadi al-Jarf]], an ancient Egyptian harbor complex on the Red Sea.

==San Francisco Bay Area==
[[Image:Oakland Long Wharf aerial.jpg|thumb|right|[[Oakland Long Wharf]], San Francisco East Bay]]
In the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in [[California]], there were several moles, combined causeways and wooden piers or trestles extending out from the eastern shore and utilized by various railroads, such as the [[Key System]], [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] (two), and [[Western Pacific Railroad]]: the [[Alameda Mole]], the [[Oakland Mole]], and the Western Pacific Mole. By extending the tracks the railroads could get beyond the shallow mud flats and reach the deeper waters of the Bay that could be navigated by the [[Ferries of San Francisco Bay|Bay Ferries]].  A train fell off the Alameda Mole through an open drawbridge in 1890 killing several people.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence M. Friedman]], [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1747-4469.1987.tb00541.x/abstract "Civil wrongs: personal injury law in the late 19th century"], ''Law &amp; Social Inquiry'', vol. 12, iss. 2-3, pp. 351–378, April 1987, p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;  None of the four Bay Area moles survive today, although the causeway portions of each were incorporated into the filling in of large tracts of marshland for harbor and industrial development.

A large mole was completed in 1947 at the [[San Francisco Naval Shipyard]] in the [[Bayview-Hunters Point, San Francisco|Bayview-Hunters Point]] neighborhood of [[San Francisco]] to accommodate the large Hunters Point gantry crane. The mole required {{convert|3000000|cuyd}} of fill.&lt;ref name=PM-4709&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1d8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA124#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Spanning the Navy's Mole at Hunter's Point, Calif., is the World's Largest Crane |author=Stimson Jr., Thomas E. |date=September 1947 |magazine=Popular Mechanics |volume=88 |number=3 |issn=0032-4558 |pages=124–128; 256 |accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
===Dunkirk evacuation===
[[File:East Mole Dunkirk.jpg|thumb|left|The remains of the East Mole of Dunkirk harbour, pictured in 2009]]
The two concrete moles protecting the outer harbour at [[Dunkirk]] played a significant part in the [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuation of British and French troops]] during [[World War II]] in May/June 1940.  The harbour had been made unusable by German bombing and it was clear that troops were not going to be taken directly off the beaches fast enough.  Naval captain [[William Tennant (Royal Navy officer)|W. G. Tennant]] had been placed ashore to take charge of the navy shore parties and organise the evacuation.  Tennant had what proved to be the highly successful idea of using the East Mole to take off troops.  The moles had never been designed to dock ships, but despite this, the majority of troops rescued from Dunkirk were taken off in this way.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/operation_dynamo.html "Operation Dynamo, the evacuation from Dunkirk, 27 May-4 June 1940"], ''Military History Encyclopedia on the Web'', retrieved 8 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Churchill Barriers===
[[File:Churchill Barrier 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Churchill Barrier 1, blocking Kirk Sound]]
The [[Churchill Barriers]] are a series of four causeways in the [[Orkney Islands]] with a total length of 1.5 miles (2.4&amp;nbsp;km).  They link the [[Orkney Mainland]] in the north to the island of [[South Ronaldsay]] via [[Burray]] and the two smaller islands of [[Lamb Holm]] and [[Glimps Holm]].

The barriers were built in the 1940s as naval defences to protect the anchorage at [[Scapa Flow]]. They were commissioned following the sinking of [[HMS Royal Oak (08)|HMS ''Royal Oak'']] in 1939 by German [[German submarine U-47 (1938)|U-boat ''U-47'']] which had penetrated the existing defences of sunken [[blockship]]s and [[anti-submarine net]]s.  The barriers now serve as road links, carrying the [[A961 road]] from [[Kirkwall]] to [[Burwick, Orkney|Burwick]].

==English Tangier==
[[File:Tangier under English rule, 1680.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Tangier under English rule, 1680]]
When England acquired the north African city of Tangier as [[English Tangier]] in 1661, the English began building a mole to improve the harbour. The mole was planned to be {{convert|1436|ft|m}} long and cost £340,000, and the improved harbour was to be {{convert|600|yd|m|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|30|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} deep at low tide, and capable of keeping out the roughest of seas.&lt;ref&gt;GIS-based plans of the historic harbour and of its works, prepared from English and Portuguese documents, are available in Elbl, ''Portuguese Tangier'' (the plans show all the data in modern coordinates).&lt;/ref&gt; Work began on the mole in August 1663&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A32878.0001.001/1:1?rgn=div1;view=fulltext|title=A Short account of the progress of the mole at Tangier|author=Sir Hugh Cholmley|date=|work=Early English Books Online – Text Creation Partnership|accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued for some years under a succession of Governors. With an improved harbour the town would have played the same role that [[Gibraltar]] later played in British naval strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Enid M. G.

However, Parliament expressed concern about the cost of maintaining the Tangier garrison, and by 1680 [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] had threatened to give up Tangier unless the supplies were voted for its sea defences. A crippling blockade by the [[Jaysh al-Rifi]] finally forced the English to withdraw from Tangier in 1683. The King gave secret orders to abandon the city, level the fortifications, destroy the harbour, and evacuate the troops. [[Samuel Pepys]] was present at the evacuation and wrote an account of it.&lt;ref name=wreglesworth&gt;John Wreglesworth, ''[http://www.elsewhereonline.com.au/Members/ChristopherWood/resources/by-country/morocco/tangier-england2019s-forgotten-colony-1661-1684 Tangier: England's Forgotten Colony (1661-1684)]''  at elsewhereonline.com.au, accessed 28 February 2011 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905061648/http://www.elsewhereonline.com.au/Members/ChristopherWood/resources/by-country/morocco/tangier-england2019s-forgotten-colony-1661-1684 |date=5 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{linguistics}}

'''Morphophonology''' (also '''morphophonemics''' or '''morphonology''') is the branch of [[linguistics]] that studies the interaction between [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] and [[phonology|phonological]] or [[phonetic]] processes. Its chief focus is the sound changes that take place in [[morpheme]]s (minimal meaningful units) when they combine to form words.

Morphophonological analysis often involves an attempt to give a series of formal rules that successfully predict the regular sound changes occurring in the morphemes of a given language. Such a series of rules converts a theoretical [[underlying representation]] into a surface form that is actually heard. The units of which the underlying representations of morphemes are composed are sometimes called '''morphophonemes'''. The surface form produced by the morphophonological rules may consist of [[phoneme]]s (which are then subject to ordinary phonological rules to produce speech sounds or ''[[phone (phonetics)|phones]]''), or else the morphophonological analysis may bypass the phoneme stage and produce the phones itself.

==Morphophonemes and morphophonological rules==
When [[morpheme]]s combine, they influence each other's sound structure (whether analyzed at a phonetic or [[phonemic]] level), resulting in different variant pronunciations for the same morpheme. Morphophonology attempts to analyze these processes. A language's morphophonological structure is generally described with a series of rules which, ideally, can predict every morphophonological [[Alternation (linguistics)|alternation]] that takes place in the language.

An example of a morphophonological alternation in English is provided by the [[plural]] morpheme, written as "-s" or "-es". Its pronunciation alternates between {{IPA|[s]}}, {{IPA|[z]}}, and {{IPA|[ɪz]}}, as in ''cats'', ''dogs'', and ''horses'' respectively. A purely phonological analysis would most likely assign to these three endings the phonemic representations {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/z/}}, {{IPA|/ɪz/}}. On a morphophonological level, however, they may all be considered to be forms of the underlying object {{IPA|//z//}}, which is a '''morphophoneme'''. The different forms it takes are dependent on the segment at the end of the morpheme to which it attaches: the dependencies are described by morphophonological rules. (The behaviour of the English past tense ending "-ed" is similar: it can be pronounced {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/d/}} or {{IPA|/ɪd/}}, as in ''hoped'', ''bobbed'' and ''added''.)

The plural suffix "-s" can also influence the form taken by the preceding morpheme, as in the case of the words ''leaf'' and ''knife'', which end with {{IPA|[f]}} in the singular/but have {{IPA|[v]}} in the plural (''leaves'', ''knives''). On a morphophonological level, the morphemes may be analyzed as ending in a morphophoneme {{IPA|//F//}}, which becomes [[voiced consonant|voiced]] when a voiced consonant (in this case the {{IPA|//z//}} of the plural ending) is attached to it. The rule may be written symbolically as {{IPA|/F/}} -&gt; [αvoice] / {{IPA|__}} [αvoice]. This expression is called Alpha Notation in which α can be +(positive value) or -(negative value).

Common conventions to indicate a morphophonemic rather than phonemic representation are double slashes (//&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;//) (as above, implying that the transcription is 'more phonemic than simply phonemic'), pipes (|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|), double pipes (‖&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;‖)&lt;ref&gt;Note, however, that in the IPA single and double pipes are used to indicate minor and major suprasegmental groups respectively as well as dental and alveolar lateral [[Click consonant|clicks]].&lt;/ref&gt; and curly brackets ({&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibbon|first1=Dafydd|last2=Moore|first2=Roger|last3=Winski|first3=Richard|title=Handbook of Standards and Resources for Spoken Language Systems: Spoken language characterisation|date=1998|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|location=Berlin; New York|isbn=9783110157345|pages=61–62|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8cxtWcsAk5MC&amp;pg=PA61|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, the English word ''cats'' may be transcribed phonetically as {{IPA|[ˈkʰæts]}}, phonemically as {{IPA|/ˈkæts/}} and morphophonemically as {{IPA|//ˈkætz//}}, if the plural is argued to be underlyingly {{IPA|//z//}}, assimilating to {{IPA|/s/}} after a voiceless nonsibilant. The tilde ~ may indicate morphological alternation, as in {{IPA|//ˈniː~ɛl+t//}} for ''kneel~knelt'' (the plus sign '+' indicates a morpheme boundary).&lt;ref&gt;Collinge (2002) ''An Encyclopedia of Language'', §4.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of changes==
Inflected and agglutinating languages may have extremely complicated systems of morphophonemics. Examples of complex morphophonological systems include:
* [[Sandhi]], the phenomenon behind the English examples of plural and past tense above, is found in virtually all languages to some degree. Even [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], which is sometimes said to display no [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], nonetheless displays [[tone sandhi]], a morphophonemic alternation.
* [[Consonant gradation]], found in some [[Uralic languages]] such as [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Northern Sami|Northern Sámi]], and [[Nganasan language|Nganasan]].
* [[Vowel harmony]], which occurs in varying degrees in languages all around the world, notably [[Turkic languages]].
* [[Ablaut]], found in English and other [[Germanic languages]]. Ablaut is the phenomenon wherein stem vowels change form depending on context, as in English ''sing'', ''sang'', ''sung''.

== Relation with phonology ==
Until the 1950s, many phonologists assumed that [[neutralization (linguistics)|neutralizing]] rules generally applied before [[allophone|allophonic]] rules. Thus phonological analysis was split into two parts: a morphophonological part, where neutralizing rules were developed to derive phonemes from morphophonemes; and a purely phonological part, where phones were derived from the phonemes. Since the 1960s (in particular with the work of the [[generative linguistics|generative]] school, such as Chomsky and Halle's ''[[The Sound Pattern of English]]'') many linguists have moved away from making such a split, instead regarding the surface phones as being derived from the underlying morphophonemes (which may be referred to using various terminology) through a single system of [[phonological rule|(morpho)phonological rules]].

The purpose of both phonemic and morphophonemic analysis is to produce simpler underlying descriptions for what appear on the surface to be complicated patterns. In purely phonemic analysis the data is just a set of words in a language, while for the purposes of morphophonemic analysis the words must be considered in grammatical [[inflection|paradigms]] to take account of the underlying [[morphemes]]. It is postulated that morphemes are recorded in the speaker's "[[lexicon]]" in an invariant (morphophonemic) form, which, in a given environment, is converted by rules into a surface form. The analyst attempts to present as completely as possible a system of underlying units (morphophonemes) and a series of rules that act on them, so as to produce surface forms consistent with the linguistic data.

== Isolation forms ==
The '''isolation form''' of a morpheme is the form in which that morpheme appears in isolation (when not subject to the effects of any other morpheme). In the case of a [[bound morpheme]], such as the English past tense ending "-ed", it will generally not be possible to identify an isolation form, since such a morpheme does not occur in isolation.

It is often reasonable to assume that the isolation form of a morpheme provides its underlying representation. For example, in some varieties of [[American English]], ''plant'' is pronounced {{IPA|[plænt]}}, while ''planting'' is {{IPA|[ˈplænɪŋ]}}, where the morpheme "plant-" appears in the form {{IPA|[plæn]}}. Here the underlying form can be assumed to be {{IPA|//plænt//}}, corresponding to the isolation form, since rules can be set up to derive the reduced form {{IPA|[plæn]}} from this (while it would be difficult or impossible to set up rules that would derive the isolation form {{IPA|[plænt]}} from an underlying {{IPA|//plæn//}}).

That is not always the case, however; sometimes the isolation form itself is subject to [[Neutralization (linguistics)|neutralization]] that does not apply to some other instances of the morpheme. For example, the French word ''petit'' ("small") is pronounced in isolation without the final [t] sound, but in certain derived forms (such as the feminine ''petite''), the [t] is heard. If the isolation form were adopted as the underlying form, the information that there is a final "t" would be lost, and it would be hard then to explain the appearance of the "t" in the inflected forms.

Assume that the grammar of a language has two rules,rule A and rule B, with A ordered before B. If, in a given derivation, the application of rule A creates the environment for rule B to apply, which was not present before the application of rule A, rule A and B are in a ''feeding relationship'' so rule A feeds rule B.

Assuming again rule A and B, with A ordered before B in the derivation in which rule A destroys the environment to which rule B shall apply, one says A and B are in a ''bleeding order''.

If it is assumed again that a pair of rules A and B, with A ordered before B and B creating an environment to which A could have applied, B is said to counterfeed A, and the relationship is ''counterfeeding''.

If one assumes a pair of rules A and B and A ordered before B is in a ''counterbleeding'' relationship if B destroys the environment that A applies to and has already applied, therefore, B ordered after A has missed its chance to bleed A.

''Conjunctive ordering'' is the ordering that ensures that all rules are applied in a derivation before the surface representation is arrived at. One says that rules applied in a feeding relationship are ''conjunctively ordered''.

''Disjunctive ordering'' is a rule that applies and prevents the other rule to apply up to the surface representation. Such rules have a bleeding relationship and are ''disjunctively ordered''.

== Orthography ==
The principle behind [[alphabet]]ic writing systems is that the letters ([[grapheme]]s) represent [[phoneme]]s. However, in many [[orthography|orthographies]] based on such systems the correspondences between graphemes and phonemes are not exact, and it is sometimes the case that certain spellings better represent a word's morphophonological structure rather than the purely phonological. An example of this is that the English plural morpheme is written ''-s'' regardless of whether it is pronounced as {{IPA|/s/}} or {{IPA|/z/}}; we write ''cat'''s''''' and ''dog'''s''''', not ''dog'''z'''''.

The above example involves active morphology ([[inflection]]), and morphophonemic spellings are common in this context in many languages. Another type of spelling that can be described as morphophonemic is the kind that reflects the [[etymology]] of words. Such spellings are particularly common in English; examples include '''''sci'''ence'' {{IPA|/saɪ/}} vs. ''uncon'''sci'''ous'' {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, '''''pre'''judice'' {{IPA|/prɛ/}} vs. '''''pre'''quel'' {{IPA|/priː/}}, '''''sign''''' {{IPA|/saɪn/}} '''''sign'''ature'' {{IPA|/sɪɡn/}}, '''''na'''tion'' {{IPA|/neɪ/}} vs. '''''na'''tionalism'' {{IPA|/næ/}}, and '''''spec'''ial'' {{IPA|/spɛ/}} vs. '''''spec'''ies'' {{IPA|/spiː/}}.

'''Nefamese''' (also ''Arunamese'') is a [[pidgin]] of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] (formerly [[North-East Frontier Agency|NEFA]]), India. Its classification is unclear; ''Ethnologue'' states that it is based on the [[Assamese language]], but also that it is most closely related to the Sino-Tibetan [[Gallong language|Gallong]] like the Assamese language formed out by the mixture of languages like [[Austric]], [[Tibeto-Burman]], [[Tai languages|Tai]] and [[Indo-Chinese]] family of languages. 

Nefamese emerged in eastern Arunachal Pradesh as a [[lingua franca]] among the Nishi, Adi, Apatanai, Khampti, Hill Miri, Idu Mishimi, Nocte, Wanchu, Tagin, Mompa, Zakhring, Apatani, and Bugun peoples, among others—between them and with other [[Assamese people|Indigenous Assamese people]] and other Indigenous groups of [[Northeast India]]. The language is threatened by, and has perhaps somewhat been replaced by, the use of Hindi due to force of the mainland Indian Government and its policies.

==Phonology==
Nefamese has six vowel phonemes, eighteen consonant phonemes and six diphthongs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bhuyan|2012|p=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Optical braille recognition''' is the act of capturing and processing images of [[braille]] characters into [[natural language]] characters. It is used to convert braille documents for people who cannot read them into text, and for preservation and reproduction of the documents.

==History==
In 1984, a group of researchers at the [[Delft University of Technology]] designed a braille reading tablet, in which a reading head with photosensitive cells was moved along set of rulers to capture braille text line-by-line.&lt;ref name=Mennens&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mennens|first1=Jan|last2=Tichelen|first2=Luc van|last3=François|first3=Guido|last4=Engelen|first4=Jan J.|title=Optical recognition of Braille using standard equipment|journal=IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering|date=December 1994|volume=2|issue=4|pages=207–212|doi=10.1109/86.340878|issn=1063-6528}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, a group of French researchers at the [[Lille University of Science and Technology]] developed an [[algorithm]], called Lectobraille, which converted braille documents into plain text. The system photographed the braille text with a low-resolution [[CCD camera]], and used [[spatial filter]]ing techniques, [[median filter]]ing, [[Erosion (morphology)|erosion]], and [[Dilation (morphology)|dilation]] to extract the braille. The braille characters were then converted to natural language using [[adaptive recognition]].&lt;ref name=Lectobraille&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dubus|first1=J.P.|last2=Benjelloun|first2=M.|last3=Devlaminck|first3=V.|last4=Wauquier|first4=F.|last5=Altmayer|first5=P.|title=Image processing techniques to perform an autonomous system to translate relief braille into black-ink, called: Lectobraille|journal=Proceedings of the Annual International Conference of the IEEE|date=November 1988|volume=4|pages=1584–1585|doi=10.1109/IEMBS.1988.94726|publisher=Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lectobraille technique had an error rate of 1%, and took an average processing time of seven seconds per line.&lt;ref name="Mennens" /&gt; In 1993, a group of researchers from the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]] developed a system to recognize braille that had been scanned with a commercially available [[Image scanner|scanner]].&lt;ref name=Mennens /&gt; The system, however, was unable to handle deformities in the braille grid, so well-formed braille documents were required.&lt;ref name="Wong"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wong|first1=Lisa|last2=Abdulla|first2=Waleed|last3=Hussman|first3=Stephan|title=A software algorithm prototype for optical recognition of embossed Braille|journal=Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Pattern Recognition|date=August 2004|pages=586–589|doi=10.1109/ICPR.2004.1334316|issn=1051-4651}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, a group at the [[Hong Kong Polytechnic University]] implemented an optical braille recognition technique using [[edge detection]] to translate braille into English or Chinese text.&lt;ref name=Ng&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ng|first1=C.|last2=Ng|first2=V.|last3=Lau|first3=Y.|title=Regular feature extraction for the recognition of braille|journal=Third International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Multimedia Applications|date=September 1999|pages=302–306|doi=10.1109/ICCIMA.1999.798547}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Murray and Dais created a handheld recognition system, that scanned small sections of a document at once.&lt;ref name=Murray&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=I.|last2=Dias|first2=T.|title=A protable device for optically recognizing Braille|journal=The Seventh Australian and New Zealand Intelligent Information Systems Conference|year=2001|pages=302–306|doi=10.1109/ANZIIS.2001.974063}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the small area scanned at once, grid deformation was less of an issue, and a simpler, more efficient algorithm was employed.&lt;ref name=Wong /&gt; In 2003, Morgavi and Morando designed a system to recognize braille characters using [[artificial neural network]]s. This system was noted for its ability to handle image degradation more successfully than other approaches.&lt;ref name=Wong /&gt;

==Applications==
Optical braille recognition is used to [[digitize]] and reproduce texts that have been produced with non-computerized systems, such as with [[braille typewriter]]s. Digitizing braille texts also helps reduce storage space, as braille texts take up much more space than their natural language counterparts. Optical braille recognition is also useful for people who cannot read braille, but need to access the content of braille documents.&lt;ref name="Al-Saleh"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Al-Saleh|first1=Amany|last2=El-Zaart|first2=Ali|last3=Al-Salman|first3=Abdul Malik|title=Dot detection of Braille images using a mixture of beta distributions|journal=Journal of Computer Science|year=2011|volume=7|issue=11|pages=1749–1759|publisher=Science Publications|issn=1549-3636|doi=10.3844/jcssp.2011.1749.1759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
Many of the challenges to successfully processing braille text arise from the nature of braille documents. Braille is generally printed on solid-color paper, with no ink to produce contrast between the raised characters and the background paper. However, imperfections in the page can appear in a scan or image of the page.

Many documents are printed ''inter-point'', meaning they are double-sided. As such, the depressions of the braille of one side appear interlaid with the protruding braille of the other side.&lt;ref name="Antonacopoulos"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Antonacopoulos|first=A.|author2=Bridson, D.|title=A Robust Braille Recognition System|journal=Document Analysis Systems|year=2004|volume=VI|pages=533–545|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-28640-0_50|issn=0302-9743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
Some optical braille recognition techniques attempt to use [[oblique angle|oblique]] lighting and a camera to reveal the shadows of the depressions and protrusions of the braille. Others make use of commercially available document scanners.&lt;ref name=Antonacopoulos /&gt;

'''Pere Maria Orts i Bosch''' (5 July 1921 – 26 February 2015)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laveupv.com/noticia/13320/mor-pere-maria-orts-humanista-i-academic-de-lavl News about Pere Maria Orts' death] in ''La Veu del País Valencià'' (28 February 2015) {{ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Valencian Community|Valencian]] writer, historian, researcher, [[heraldist]] and [[art collector]]. He was a member of the [[Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua]] (Valencian Language Academy) and was awarded the High Distinction of the [[Generalitat Valenciana]] in 2006.

== Biography ==
He was born on the city of Valencia on 5 July 1921. He went to the High School in the [[Piarist|Piarist School]] of Valencia. Although he graduated in Law from in the [[University of Valencia]] in 1945, and his historian grandfather Pere Maria Orts i Berdin (1839) was a judge of the Superior Court of Valencia, he never practiced it.

When he was 45 years-old, Orts moved to [[Benidorm]], where his paternal family lived, to conduct research directly related to ''la Marina'' ([[Marina Alta]] and [[Marina Baixa]]). His main goal was to find documents and works of art that were actually from the ancient [[Kingdom of Valencia]], hoping to complete Valencian patrimony and part of its lost history. As an art sponsor, he enlarged his family heritage by buying many works of art. He searched for unique objects in libraries, archives and museums outside [[Valencian Country]], eventually donating most of them to Valencian public institutions, particularly to:

* [[Valencian Library]]: more than 11.000 volumes donated, including 13 [[incunable]]s.
* [[Museu de Belles Arts de València|Museum of Fine Arts of Valencia saint Pius V]]: 229 paintings from the [[Trecento]] until the 20th century were donated, as were artistic objects of great value. These encompassed 10 sculptures, chinaware of the ''Indian Company,'' glass from [[Murano]], and a combined 69 pieces pottery both from Spain ([[Manises]], [[Talavera]]{{disambiguation needed|date=April 2017}}&lt;!--Talavera de la Reina and Talavera pottery are both possible--&gt;, [[l'Alcora]] and [[Ribesalbes]]) and other countries ([[China]], [[Japan]] and [[France]]).

Among his other donations were 3 tapestries, 7 chalices, several candelabrums, 9 pieces of furniture, and even a silver writing desk.

He died on 26 February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.levante-emv.com/cultura/2015/02/26/investigador-academico-pere-maria-orts/1231315.html News] in [[Levante-EMV]]. {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==

===New Testament===
A passage in the [[New Testament]] which may refer to a prayer for the dead is found in {{Bibleverse|2|Timothy|1:16-18}}, which reads as follows:
:"May the Lord grant mercy to the house of [[Onesiphorus]], for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain, but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me (the Lord grant to him to find the Lord's mercy on that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well."

As with the verses from 2 Maccabees, these verses refer to prayers that will help the deceased "on that day" (perhaps [[Last judgement|Judgement Day]], see also [[end times]]). It is not stated that Onesiphorus, for whom [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] prayed, was dead, though some scholars infer this, based on the way Paul only refers to him in the past tense, and prays for present blessings on his household, but for him only "on that day". And towards the end of the same letter, in {{Bibleverse|2|Timothy|4:19}}, Paul sends greetings to "Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus", distinguishing the situation of Onesiphorus from that of the still living [[Priscilla and Aquila|Prisca and Aquila]].

===Tradition===
Prayer for the dead is well documented within  [[Early Christianity#Prayer for the dead|early Christianity]], both among prominent Church Fathers and the Christian community in general. In [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] Christians pray for "such souls as have departed with faith, but without having had time to bring forth fruits worthy of repentance".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravoslavieto.com/docs/eng/Orthodox_Catechism_of_Philaret.htm#gen0 The Longer Catechism of the Orthodox, Catholic, Eastern Church], 376&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Catholic Church]] the assistance that the dead receive by prayer on their behalf is linked with the process of purification known as [[purgatory]].&lt;ref name="Le Goff"&gt;[[Jacques Le Goff|Le Goff, Jacques]]. The birth of purgatory. University of Chicago Press. 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1sect2chpt3art12.htm Catechism of the Catholic Church], 1032&lt;/ref&gt; While prayer for the dead continues in both these traditions and in those of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] and of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], many [[Protestantism|Protestant groups]] reject the practice.

The tomb of the Christian [[Abercius of Hieropolis|Abercius]] of [[Hierapolis|Hieropolis]] in [[Phrygia]] (latter part of the 2nd century) bears the inscription: "Let every friend who observes this pray for me", i.e. Abercius, who throughout speaks in the first person.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The inscriptions in the Roman [[catacomb]]s bear similar witness to the practice, by the occurrence of such phrases as:
*''Mayst thou live among the [[saints]]'' (3rd century);&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;
*''May God refresh the soul of . . . ;''&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;
*''Peace be with them''.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Among Church writers [[Tertullian]] († 230) is the first to mention prayers for the dead: "The widow who does not pray for her dead husband has as good as divorced him". This passage occurs in one of his later writings, dating from the beginning of the 3rd century. Subsequent writers similarly make mention of the practice as prevalent, not as unlawful or even disputed (until [[Arius]] challenged it towards the end of the 4th century). The most famous instance is [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]]'s prayer for his mother, [[Monica of Hippo|Monica]], at the end of the 9th book of his ''[[Confessions of St. Augustine|Confessions]]'', written around 398.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

An important element in the [[Christian liturgy|Christian liturgies]] both East and West consisted of the [[diptych]]s, or lists of names of living and dead commemorated at the [[Eucharist]]. To be inserted in these lists was a confirmation of one's orthodoxy, and out of the practice grew the official [[canonization]] of saints; on the other hand, removal of a name was a condemnation.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In the middle of the 3rd century, St. [[Cyprian]] enjoining that there should be no oblation or public prayer made for a deceased layman who had broken the Church's rule by appointing a cleric trustee under his will: "He ought not to be named in the priests prayer who has done his best to detain the clergy from the altar."&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Although it is not possible, as a rule, to name dates for the exact words used in the ancient liturgies, yet the universal occurrence of these diptychs and of definite prayers for the dead in all parts of the [[Christian Church]], East and West, in the 4th and 5th centuries shows how primitive such prayers were. The language used in the prayers for the departed is asking for rest and freedom from pain and sorrow.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; A passage from the [[Liturgy of St James]] reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Remember, O Lord, the God of Spirits and of all Flesh, those whom we have remembered and those whom we have not remembered, men of the true faith, from righteous [[Abel]] unto to-day; do thou thyself give them rest there in the land of the living, in thy kingdom, in the delight of [[Paradise]], in the [[bosom of Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]], our [[Patriarchs (Bible)|holy fathers]], from whence pain and sorrow and sighing have fled away, where the light of thy countenance visiteth them and always shineth upon them.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Public prayers were only offered for those who were believed to have died as faithful members of the Church. But [[Saint Perpetua]], who was martyred in 202, believed herself to have been encouraged in a vision to pray for her brother, who had died in his eighth year, almost certainly unbaptized; and a later vision assured her that her prayer was answered and he had been translated from punishment. St. Augustine thought it needful to point out that the narrative was not canonical Scripture, and contended that the child had perhaps been baptized.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Eastern Christianity===

====Theology====
[[Orthodox Church|Eastern]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] believe in the possibility of situation change for the souls of the dead through the prayers of the living, and reject the term "[[purgatory]]". Prayer for the dead is encouraged in the belief that it is helpful for them, though ''how'' the prayers of the faithful help the departed is not elucidated. Eastern Orthodox simply believe that tradition teaches ''that'' prayers should be made for the dead.&lt;ref&gt;"Of course we do not understand exactly ''how'' such prayer benefits the departed. Yet equally, when we intercede for people still alive, we cannot explain how this intercessions assists them. We know from our personal experience that prayer for others is effective, and so we continue to practice it."

Saint [[Basil the Great]] († 379), a saint of undivided Christianity, writes in his Third Kneeling Prayer at [[Pentecost]]: "O Christ our God...(who) on this all-perfect and saving Feast, art graciously pleased to accept propitiatory prayers for those who are imprisoned in hades, promising unto us who are held in bondage great hope of release from the vilenes that doth hinder us and did hinder them ... send down Thy consolation... and establish their souls in the mansions of the Just; and graciously vouchsafe unto them peace and pardon; for not the dead shall praise thee, O Lord, neither shall they who are in Hell make bold to offer unto thee confession. But we who are living will bless thee, and will pray, and offer unto thee propitiatory prayers and sacrifices for their souls."&lt;ref&gt;Isabel F.

Saint [[Gregory the Great|Gregory Dialogus]] († 604) in his famous ''Dialogues'' (written in 593) teaches that, "The Holy Sacrifice (Eucharist) of Christ, our saving Victim, brings great benefits to souls even after death, provided their sins (are such as) can be pardoned in the life to come."&lt;ref&gt;''Dialogues'' IV, 57.&lt;/ref&gt; However, St. Gregory goes on to say, the Church's practice of prayer for the dead must not be an excuse for not living a godly life on earth. "The safer course, naturally, is to do for ourselves during life what we hope others will do for us after death."&lt;ref&gt;Id. IV, 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Father [[Seraphim Rose]] († 1982) says, "the Church's prayer cannot save anyone who does not wish salvation, or who never offered any struggle ([[podvig]]) for it himself during his lifetime."&lt;ref&gt;Fr. Seraphim Rose, ''The Soul After Death'' (Saint Herman of Alaska Brotherhood, Platina, California, {{ISBN|0-938635-14-X}}), p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eastern Orthodox Praxis====
The various prayers for the departed have as their purpose to pray for the repose of the departed, to comfort the living, and to remind those who remain of their own mortality. For this reason, memorial services have an air of penitence about them.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, the Panikhida does not have the chanting of "God is the Lord..." as the [[Moleben]] does; but instead, the "Alleluia" is chanted, reminiscent of the "Alleluia" that is chanted at Lenten services.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church's prayers for the dead begin at the moment of death, when the priest leads the ''Prayers at the Departure of the Soul '', consisting of a special [[Canon (hymnography)|Canon]] and prayers for the release of the soul. Then the body is washed, clothed and laid in the coffin, after which the priest begins the ''First [[Panikhida]]'' (prayer service for the departed). After the First Panikhida, the family and friends begin reading the [[Psalter]] aloud beside the casket. This reading continues and concludes until the next morning, in which usually the funeral is held, up until the time of the ''[[orthros]]''.

Orthodox Christians offer particularly fervent prayers for the departed on the first 40 days after death. Traditionally, in addition to the service on the day of death, the memorial service is performed at the request of the relatives of an individual departed person on the following occasions:
*'''Third day''' after death&lt;ref&gt;In calculating the number of days, the actual day of death is counted as the first day. According to St. [[Macarius the Great]], the reason for these days is as follows: from the third day to the ninth day after death, the departed is soul is shown the mansions of [[Paradise]] (the funeral is normally performed on the third day); from the ninth to the fortieth days, the soul is shown the torments of [[hell]]; and on the fortieth day, the soul stands before the throne of God to undergo the [[Particular judgement|Particular Judgement]] and is assigned the place where it will await the [[Second Coming]]. For this reason, the fortieth day is considered to be the most important. In some traditions, there is also a commemoration at six months.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Ninth day'''
*'''Fortieth day'''
*'''First anniversary''' of death
*'''Third anniversary''' (some will request a memorial every year on the anniversary of death)

In addition to Panikhidas for individuals, there are also several days during the year that are set aside as special general commemorations of the dead, when all departed Orthodox Christians will be prayed for together (this is especially to benefit those who have no one on earth to pray for them). The majority of these general commemorations fall on the various "[[Saturday of Souls|Soul Saturday]]s" throughout the year (mostly during [[Great Lent]]). On these days, in addition to the normal Panikhida, there are special additions to [[Vespers]] and [[Matins]], and there will be [[Proper (liturgy)|propers]] for the departed added to the Divine Liturgy. These days of general memorial are:
*'''Meatfare Saturday''' (two Saturdays before Great Lent begins)&amp;mdash;in some traditions families and friends will offer Panikhidas for their loved ones during the week, culminating in the general commemoration on Saturday
*'''The second Saturday of Great Lent'''
*'''The third Saturday of Great Lent'''
*'''The fourth Saturday of Great Lent'''
*'''[[Radonitsa]]''' (the second Tuesday after Easter)
*'''The Saturday before [[Pentecost]]'''&amp;mdash;in some traditions families and friends will offer Panikhidas for their loved ones during the week, culminating in the general commemoration on Saturday
*'''Demetrius Saturday''' (the Saturday before the feast of [[Saint Demetrius]], October 26). In the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] there is a commemoration of the dead on the Saturday before the feast of [[Saint Michael the Archangel]], November 8, instead of the Demetrius Soul Saturday.

The most important form of prayer for the dead occurs in the [[Divine Liturgy]]. Particles are cut from the [[prosphora|prosphoron]] during the [[Liturgy of Preparation|Proskomedie]] at the beginning of the Liturgy. These particles are placed beneath the [[Lamb (Liturgy)|Lamb]] (Host) on the [[paten|diskos]], where they remain throughout the Liturgy. After the Communion of the faithful, the deacon brushes these particles into the  [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]], saying,  "Wash away, O Lord, the sins of all those here commemorated, by Thy Precious Blood, through the prayers of all thy saints." Of this action, Saint [[Mark of Ephesus]] says, "We can do nothing better or greater for the dead than to pray for them, offering commemoration for them at the Liturgy. Of this they are always in need... The body feels nothing then: it does not see its close ones who have assembled, does not smell the fragrance of the flowers, does not hear the funeral orations. But the soul senses the prayers offered for it and is grateful to those who make them and is spiritually close to them."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Seraphim Rose, ''The Soul After Death'', p. 192, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

Normally, candidates for sainthood, prior to their [[Glorification]] (Canonization) as a saint, will be commemorated by serving Panikhidas. Then, on the eve of their Glorification will be served an especially solemn [[Orthodox requiem|Requiem]], known as the "Last Panikhida."

===Roman Catholic Church===
In the West there is ample evidence of the custom of praying for the dead in the inscriptions of the [[catacomb]]s, with their constant prayers for the peace and refreshment of the souls of the departed and in the early liturgies, which commonly contain commemorations of the dead; and Tertullian, Cyprian and other early Western Fathers witness to the regular  practice of praying for the dead among the early Christians.&lt;ref name="ODCC"&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' (Oxford University Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-19-280290-3}}), article "dead, prayer for the"&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the case of martyred Christians, it was felt that it was inappropriate to pray "for" the martyrs, since they were believed to be in no need of such prayers, having instantly passed to the [[Beatific Vision]] of [[Heaven]]. Theoretically, too, prayer for those in hell (understood as the abode of the eternally lost) would be useless, but since there is no certainty that any particular person is in hell understood in that sense, prayers were and are offered for all the dead, except for those believed to be in heaven. These are prayed to, not for. Thus, prayers were and are offered for all those in [[Hades in Christianity|Hades]], the abode of the dead who are not known to be in heaven, sometimes rendered as "hell".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1R.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 633]&lt;/ref&gt; With the development of the doctrine of [[purgatory]], the dead prayed for were spoken of as being in purgatory and, in view of the certainty that by the process of purification and with the help of the prayers of the faithful they were destined for heaven, they were referred to as the "holy souls".

Limits were placed on public offering of [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] for the unbaptised, non-Catholics, and notorious sinners, but prayers and even Mass in private could be said for them. The present Code of Canon Law of the [[Catholic Church]] states that, unless the person concerned gave some signs of repentance before death, no form of funeral Mass may be offered for notorious apostates, [[heretic]]s and [[schism (religion)|schism]]atics; those who for anti-Christian motives chose that their bodies be cremated; and other manifest sinners to whom a Church funeral could not be granted without public scandal to the faithful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P4A.HTM canons 1184-1185]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, "provided their own minister is not available, baptised persons belonging to a non-catholic Church or ecclesial community may, in accordance with the prudent judgement of the local Ordinary, be allowed Church funeral rites, unless it is established that they did not wish this."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P4A.HTM canon 1183 §3]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the slaughter of the First World War, [[Pope Benedict XV]] on 10 August 1915, allowed all priests everywhere to say three Masses on [[All Souls' Day]]. The two extra Masses were in no way to benefit the priest himself: one was to be offered for all the faithful departed, the other for the Pope's intentions, which at that time were presumed to be for all the victims of that war. The permission remains.

Each Eucharistic Prayer, including the ancient [[Roman Canon]], of the [[Order of Mass]] has a prayer for the departed.

In ''Communio Sanctorum'', the Lutheran and Roman Catholic Churches in Germany agreed that prayer for the dead "corresponds to the communion in which we are bound together in Christ...with those who have already died to pray for them and to commend them...to the mercy of God."&lt;ref name="Gould2016"/&gt; Likewise, in the United States, the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America|Evangelical Lutheran Church]] and Roman Catholic Church formulated a statement ''The Hope of Eternal Life'', which affirmed that "there is communion among the living and the dead across the divide of death. ... Prayerful commendation of the dead to God is salutary within a funeral liturgy. ... Insofar as the resurrection of the dead and the general final judgment are future events, it is appropriate to pray for God's mercy for each person, entrusting that one to God's mercy."&lt;ref name="Gould2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gould|first=James B.|title=Understanding Prayer for the Dead: Its Foundation in History and Logic|date=4 August 2016|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|language=English |isbn=9781620329887|pages=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anglicanism ===
The [[Church of England]]'s 1549 [[Book of Common Prayer|Book of the Common Prayer]] still had prayer for the dead, as (in the Communion Service): "We commend into thy mercy all other thy servants, which are departed hence from us with the sign of faith and now do rest in the sleep of peace: grant unto them, we beseech thee, thy mercy and everlasting peace."&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; But since 1552 the Book of Common Prayer has no express prayers for the dead, and the practice is denounced in the Homily "On Prayer" (part 3).&lt;ref&gt;"Neither let us dreame any more, that the soules of the dead are any thing at all holpen by our prayers: But as the Scripture teacheth us, let us thinke that the soule of man passing out of the body, goeth straight wayes either to heaven, or else to hell, whereof the one needeth no prayer, and the other is without redemption" ([http://www.anglicanlibrary.org/homilies/bk2hom07.htm An Homilie or Sermon concerning Prayer], part 3)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nonjuring schism|Nonjurors]] included prayers for the dead, a practice that spread within the Church of England in the mid-nineteenth century, and was authorized in 1900 for forces serving in South Africa and since then in other forms of service. Many jurisdictions and parishes of the Anglo-Catholic tradition continue to practice prayer for the dead, including offering the Sunday liturgy for the peace of named departed Christians and keeping All Souls' Day.

The [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]'s 1979 [[Book of Common Prayer#United States|Book of Common Prayer]] includes prayers for the dead. The prayers during the Sunday Eucharistic Liturgy  include intercessions for the repose of the faithful departed. Furthermore, most of the prayers in the burial rite are for the deceased, including the opening collect: &lt;blockquote&gt;O God, whose mercies cannot be numbered: Accept our prayers on behalf of thy servant ''N.,'' and grant ''him'' an entrance into the land of light and joy, in the fellowship of thy saints; through Jesus Christ thy Son our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. Amen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Book of Common Prayer|last = |first = |publisher = |year = 1979|isbn = |location = |pages = 470}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to the Catechism in the 1979 Book of Common Prayer, "We pray for (the dead), because we still hold them in our love, and because we trust that in God's presence those who have chosen to serve him will grow in his love, until they see him as he is."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Book of Common Prayer|last = |first = |publisher = |year = 1979|isbn = |location = |pages = 862}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this statement indicates that prayer is typically made for those who are known to have been members of the Church ("those who have chosen to serve him"), prayer is also offered for those whose faith was uncertain or unknown—authorized options in the Prayer Book burial rite allow for prayers that thus entrust the deceased to the mercy of God while retaining integrity about what was known of the deceased's religious life. For example, following the intercessions, there are two options for a concluding prayer: the first begins, "Lord Jesus Christ, we commend to you our brother (sister) ''N.,'' who was reborn by water and the Spirit in Holy Baptism . . ."; the second, however, would be appropriate for one whose faith and standing before God is not known:&lt;blockquote&gt;Father of all, we pray to you for ''N.,'' and for all those whom we love but see no longer. Grant to them eternal rest. Let light perpetual shine upon them. May ''his'' soul and the souls of all the departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace. Amen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Book of Common Prayer|last = |first = |publisher = |year = 1979|isbn = |location = |pages = 498}}&lt;/ref&gt;   &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Lutheran Church  ====
To console women whose children were not born and baptized, [[Martin Luther]] wrote in 1542: "In summary, see to it that above all else you are a true Christian and that you teach a heartfelt yearning and praying to God in true faith, be it in this or in any other trouble. Then do not be dismayed about your child or yourself. Know that your prayer is pleasing to God and that God will do everything much better than you can comprehend or desire. 'Call upon me,' he says in Psalm 50. 'In the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me.' For this reason, we ought not to condemn such infants. Believers and Christians have devoted their longing and yearning and praying for them."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kX9ZSEGyQiIC&amp;pg=PT594&amp;dq=Luther+consolation+for+women&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=L1QIU_-tN4bQ7AajgoGQAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Luther%20consolation%20for%20women&amp;f=false ''Martin Luther's Basic Theological Writings'' (Fortress Press 2012)] {{ISBN|978-0-80069883-6}}; cf.

The Lutheran Reformers de-emphasized prayer for the dead, because they believed that the practice had led to many abuses and even to false doctrine, in particular the doctrine of purgatory and of the Mass as a propitiatory sacrifice for the departed.  But they recognized that the early Church had practiced prayer for the dead, and accepted it in principle.  Thus in the 1580 Book of Concord, the Lutheran Church taught:

"... we know that the ancients speak of prayer for the dead, which we do not prohibit; but we disapprove of the application ''ex opere operato'' of the Lord's Supper on behalf of the dead."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Defense of the Augsburg Confession - Book of Concord|url = http://bookofconcord.org/defense_23_mass.php#para94|website = bookofconcord.org|accessdate = 2015-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest Lutheran denomination in the United States, the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], "remembers the faithful departed in the Prayers of the People every Sunday, including those who have recently died and those commemorated on the church calendar of saints".&lt;ref name="WipfStock2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gould|first=James B.|title=Understanding Prayer for the Dead: Its Foundation in History and Logic|date=4 August 2016|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|language=English |isbn=9781532606014|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Funeral rites of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, "deceased are prayed for" using "commendations: 'keep our sister/brother ... in the company of all your saints. And at the last ... raise her/him up to share with all the faithful the endless joy and peace won through the glorious resurrection of Christ our Lord.'"&lt;ref name="WipfStock2016"/&gt; The response for these prayers for the dead in this Lutheran liturgy is the prayer of [[Eternal Rest]]: "rest eternal grant him/her, O Lord; and let light perpetual shine upon him/her".&lt;ref name="WipfStock2016"/&gt;

On the other hand, the edition of Luther's ''Small Catechism'' widely used among communicants of the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] recommends:{{quote| For whom should we pray?...We should pray for ourselves and for all other people, even for our enemies, but not for the souls of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Question 201 of Luther's Small Catechism with Explanation (Concordia Publishing House, 1991 edition) The Lutheran Church Missouri Synod&lt;/ref&gt;}}This question and answer do not appear in Luther's original text, but reflect the views of the twentieth-century Lutherans who added this explanation to the catechism.

Similarly, the conservative Lutheran denomination WELS teaches:{{quote|Lutherans do not pray for the souls of the departed.  When a person dies his soul goes to either heaven or hell.  There is no second chance after death.  The Bible tells us, "Man is destined to die once and after that to face judgment" (Hebrew 9:27, see also Luke 16:19-31).

Family members will pray around the body as soon as possible after [[death]]. People try to avoid touching the [[corpse]] as it is considered polluting.

== Islam ==
{{See also|Islamic funeral}}
In [[Islam]], Muslims of their community gather to their collective prayers for the [[forgiveness]] of the dead, a prayer is recited and this prayer is known as the [[Salat al-Janazah]] (Janazah prayer).

The Janazah prayer is as follows:

like [[Eid prayer]], the Janazah prayer incorporates an additional (four) Takbirs, the Arabic name for the phrase Allahu Akbar, but there is no Ruku' (bowing) and Sujud (prostrating).

[[Supplication]] for the deceased and mankind is recited.

In extraordinary circumstances, the prayer can be postponed and prayed at a later time as was done in the Battle of Uhud.

[[Dogma]] states it is obligatory for every Muslim adult male to perform the funeral prayer upon the death of any Muslim, but the dogma embraces the practical in that it qualifies, when Janazah is performed by the few it alleviates that obligation for all.

In addition, "Peace be upon him" (sometimes abbreviated in writing as PBUH) is a constantly repeated prayer for dead people such as Mohammed.

== Judaism ==
{{main|Yizkor}}
Prayers for the dead form part of the [[Jewish services]]. The prayers offered on behalf of the deceased consist of: Recitation of [[Psalms]]; Reciting a thrice daily communal prayer in [[Aramaic]] which is known as ''[[Kaddish]]''. ''Kaddish'' actually means "Sanctification" (or "Prayer of Making Holy") which is a prayer "In Praise of God"; or other special remembrances known as ''[[Bereavement in Judaism#Yizkor|Yizkor]]''; and also a ''Hazkara'' which is said either on the annual commemoration known as the ''[[Bereavement in Judaism#Yahrzeit|Yahrzeit]]'' as well on [[Jewish holiday]]s.

The form in use in England contains the following passage: "Have mercy upon him; pardon all his transgressions ... Shelter his soul in the shadow of Thy wings. Make known to him the path of life."&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Prayers for the Dead |volume=22 |pages=262–263 |first=Winfrid Oldfield |last=Burrows |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''El Maleh Rachamim'' is the actual Jewish prayer for the dead, although less well known than the Mourner's Kaddish. While the Kaddish does not mention death but rather affirms the steadfast faith of the mourners in God's goodness, ''El Maleh Rachamim'' is a prayer for the rest of the departed.  There are various translations for the original Hebrew which vary significantly. One version reads:
{{quote|God, filled with mercy, dwelling in the heavens' heights, bring proper rest beneath the wings of your Shechinah, amid the ranks of the holy and the pure, illuminating like the brilliance of the skies the souls of our beloved and our blameless who went to their eternal place of rest. May You who are the source of mercy shelter them beneath Your wings eternally, and bind their souls among the living, that they may rest in peace. And let us say: Amen.{{cite quote|date=May 2018}}}}

A record of Jewish prayer and offering of sacrifice for the dead at the time of the [[Maccabees]] is seen being referred to in [[2 Maccabees]], a book written in [[Greek language|Greek]], which, though not accepted as part of the [[Jewish Bible]], is regarded as canonical by [[Eastern Christianity]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]]:
{{Quote|But under the tunic of each of the dead they found amulets sacred to the idols of Jamnia, which the law forbids the Jews to wear. So it was clear to all that this was why these men had been slain. They all therefore praised the ways of the Lord, the just judge who brings to light the things that are hidden. Turning to supplication, they prayed that the sinful deed might be fully blotted out. The noble [[Judas Maccabeus|Judas]] warned the soldiers to keep themselves free from sin, for they had seen with their own eyes what had happened because of the sin of those who had fallen. He then took up a collection among all his soldiers, amounting to two thousand silver drachmas, which he sent to Jerusalem to provide for an expiatory sacrifice. In doing this he acted in a very excellent and noble way, inasmuch as he had the resurrection of the dead in view; for if he were not expecting the fallen to rise again, it would have been useless and foolish to pray for them in death. But if he did this with a view to the splendid reward that awaits those who had gone to rest in godliness, it was a holy and pious thought. Thus he made atonement for the dead that they might be freed from this sin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/2maccabees/2maccabees12.htm 2 Maccabees 12:40-46]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Jacques Le Goff]], French historian and agnostic, concluded,  "at the time of Judas Maccabeus-around 170 B.C., a surprisingly innovative period- prayer for the dead was not practiced, but that a century later it was practiced by certain Jews.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Le Goff|first=Jacques|title=The Birth of Purgatory|date=1984|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4dzynjFfX7kC&amp;q=a+surprisingly+innovative+period#v=snippet&amp;q=a surprisingly innovative period&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This extract does not explain on what grounds Le Goff argued that prayer for the dead was not in use in the first half of the 2nd century BC. The account of the action of Judas Maccabaeus was written midway through the second half of the same century, in about 124 B.C.,&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], ''Understanding the Bible''. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the view of [[Philip Schaff]] its mention of prayer for the dead "seems to imply habit".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/hcc2.v.xiv.xx.html Philip Schaff, ''History of the Christian Church, Volume II: Ante-Nicene Christianity. A.D. 100-325'', "§156. Between Death and Resurrection."]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bahá'í Faith==
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] believes the soul continues to progress toward God in the afterlife. In fact the Bahá'í definition of heaven and hell are nearness and distance from God respectively. The belief is that souls can be aided in their progress by the saying of prayers for the departed. Here is a sample of one such prayer:
{{Quote|O my God! O Thou forgiver of sins, bestower of gifts, dispeller of afflictions!

Verily, I beseech thee to forgive the sins of such as have abandoned the physical garment and have ascended to the spiritual world.

O my Lord! Purify them from trespasses, dispel their sorrows, and change their darkness into light.  Cause them to enter the garden of happiness, cleanse them with the most pure water, and grant them to behold Thy splendors on the loftiest mount.
 - ‘Abdu’l-Bahá}}

The Prayer for the Dead is a particular prayer for the departed said at Bahá'í funerals before internment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bahaiprayers.org/depart1.htm Prayer for the Dead]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.org/compilations/burial.html Compilation: Baha'i Burial]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-14.html The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Pages 101-102 - Baha'i Reference Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard George Adams''' (9 May 1920 – 24 December 2016)&lt;ref name="BBC report"/&gt; was an English novelist and writer of the books ''[[Watership Down]]'', ''[[Shardik]]'' and ''[[The Plague Dogs]]''. He studied modern history at university before serving in the British Army during World War II. Afterwards, he completed his studies, and then joined the [[British Civil Service]]. In 1974, two years after ''Watership Down'' was published, Adams became a full-time author.&lt;ref name="Structo talks to Richard Adams"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://structomagazine.co.uk/interviews/richard-adams/|title = Structo talks to Richard Adams|publisher=structomagazine.co.uk|accessdate = 1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McFadden|first=Robert D.|title=Richard Adams, Whose Novel 'Watership Down' Became a Phenomenon, Dies at 96|date=27 December 2016|newspaper=The New York Times| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/27/arts/richard-adams-author-of-watership-down-dies-at-96.html?_r=0|access-date=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==

Richard Adams was born on 9 May 1920 in [[Wash Common]], near [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]], Berkshire, England, the son of Lillian Rosa (Button) and Elveyn George Beadon Adams, a doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/27/arts/richard-adams-author-of-watership-down-dies-at-96.html|title=Richard Adams, Whose Novel 'Watership Down' Became a Phenomenon, Dies at 96|date=27 December 2016|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Horris Hill School]] from 1926 to 1933, and then [[Bradfield College]] from 1933 to 1938. In 1938, he went to [[Worcester College, Oxford]], to read [[Modern History#Oxford|Modern History]]. In July 1940, Adams was called up to join the [[British Army]]. He was posted to the [[Royal Army Service Corps]] and was selected for the Airborne Company, where he worked as a brigade liaison. He served in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], Europe and the Far East but saw no direct action against either the Germans or the Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;Michael D Sharp, ''Popular Contemporary Writers'', Marshall Cavendish Corporation 2006 {{ISBN|0-7614-7601-6}}(p.26)&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving the army in 1946, Adams returned to Worcester College to continue his studies for a further two years. He received a bachelor's degree in 1948, proceeding [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biography.jrank.org/pages/4088/Adams-Richard-George.html "Richard George Adams"], Trevor Royle, ''Brief Biographies, Contemporary Novelists vol. 1''.

Retrieved 2 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; After his graduation in 1948, Adams joined the British Civil Service, rising to the rank of [[Assistant Secretary]] to the [[Ministry of Housing and Local Government]], later part of the [[Secretary of State for the Environment|Department of the Environment]]. Now, finally he began to write his own stories in his spare time, reading his creations to his amazed children and then, a bit later on, grandchildren. 
&lt;ref name=Blezard/&gt;

==Career==
Adams originally began telling the story that would become ''[[Watership Down]]'' to his two daughters on a car trip.&lt;ref name=batty/&gt; They eventually insisted that he publish it as a book. He began writing in 1966, taking two years to complete it.&lt;ref name=batty&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/27/watership-down-author-richard-adams-dies-aged-96 |title=Richard Adams, Watership Down author, dies aged 96 |work=The Guardian |author=David Batty |date=28 December 2016 |accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, after four publishers and three writers' agencies turned down the manuscript, [[Rex Collings]] agreed to publish the work.&lt;ref name=Blezard&gt;{{cite news|last=Blezard|first=Paul|title=Richard Adams: Forever animated by the life of animals|date=15 May 2010|newspaper=The Independent|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/richard-adams-forever-animated-by-the-life-of-animals-1974572.html|access-date=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book gained international acclaim almost immediately for reinvigorating anthropomorphic fiction with naturalism.&lt;ref name=batty/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Timothy |last=Jones |date=27 December 2016 |title=''Watership Down'' author Richard Adams dies, aged 96 |url=http://www.dw.com/en/watership-down-author-richard-adams-dies-aged-96/a-36925179 |website=DW |accessdate=27 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next few years ''Watership Down'' sold over a million copies worldwide. Adams won both of the most prestigious British children's book awards, one of six authors to do so: the [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] and the [[Guardian Children's Fiction Prize]].&lt;ref name=medal1972/&gt;&lt;ref name=relaunch/&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name=GCFP/&gt; In 1974, following publication of his second novel, ''[[Shardik]]'', he left the Civil Service to become a full-time author. He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]] in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rslit.org/content/fellows |title=Royal Society of Literature All Fellows |publisher=Royal Society of Literature |accessdate=10 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305070326/http://www.rslit.org/content/fellows |archivedate=5 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point, Adams served as writer-in-residence at the [[University of Florida]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.english.ufl.edu/crw/ |title=Department of English &amp;#124; Graduate Programs – MFA in Fiction &amp; Poetry |publisher=English.ufl.edu |date= |accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[Hollins University]] in Virginia.&lt;ref name="Structo talks to Richard Adams"/&gt; Adams was the recipient of the inaugural Whitchurch Arts Award for inspiration in January 2010, presented at the Watership Down pub in [[Freefolk]], Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.newsquest.co.uk/hampshire/southampton/page_turning/wiltshire_society/20100304/index.html Wiltshire Society | Water under the bridge (accessed 2 April 2010)] March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.whitchurcharts.org.uk/events/whitchurch-arts-award/whitchurch-arts-award-2010-richard-adams/ |title=Whitchurch Arts Award for inspiration given to Richard Adams (accessed April 2010) |publisher=Whitchurcharts.org.uk |date=9 May 1920 |accessdate=19 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513223752/http://whitchurcharts.org.uk/events/whitchurch-arts-award/whitchurch-arts-award-2010-richard-adams/ |archivedate=13 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the [[University of Winchester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inspirational figures celebrated at University of Winchester Graduation ceremonies|date=17 October 2015|publisher=The University of Winchester|url=http://www.winchester.ac.uk/newsandevents/Pages/Inspirational-figures-celebrated-at-University-of-Winchester-Graduation-ceremonies.aspx|access-date=27 December 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228032118/http://www.winchester.ac.uk/newsandevents/Pages/Inspirational-figures-celebrated-at-University-of-Winchester-Graduation-ceremonies.aspx|archivedate=28 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public figure==
In 1982, Adams served one year as president of the [[RSPCA]].&lt;ref name="Structo talks to Richard Adams"/&gt; Besides campaigning against furs, Adams wrote ''The Plague Dogs'' to satirize animal experimentation (as well as government and tabloid press).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rabbit.org/journal/4-2/richardadams.html|title=My Afternoon with Richard Adams|last=Fezza|first=Charlemange|website=www.rabbit.org|access-date=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also made a voyage through the [[Antarctic]] in the company of the ornithologist [[Ronald Lockley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adams|first1=Richard|last2=Lockley|first2=Ronald|title=Voyage Through the Antarctic|publisher=Allen Lane|year=1982|isbn=978-0394528588}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just before his 90th birthday, he wrote a new story for a charity book, ''Gentle Footprints'', to raise funds for the [[Born Free Foundation]].&lt;ref name=Blezard/&gt;

==Personal life==
Adams celebrated his 90th birthday in 2010 with a party at the White Hart in his hometown of [[Whitchurch, Hampshire]], where [[Sir George Young, 6th Baronet|Sir George Young]] presented him with a painting by a local artist.

In 1949, Adams married (Barbara) Elizabeth, daughter of R.A.F. Squadron-Leader Edward Fox Dyke Acland, son of the barrister and judge [[Reginald Acland|Sir Reginald Brodie Dyke Acland]], whose father, the scientist [[Henry Acland|Henry Wentworth Dyke Acland]] (himself created a baronet of St Mary Magdalen, Oxford) descended from the [[Acland baronets]] of Columb John.&lt;ref&gt;Burke's Peerage, 1999, vol. 1, pg 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature, vol. 2, R. Reginald, 1979, pg 790&lt;/ref&gt;

Until his death, he lived with his wife in Whitchurch, within {{convert|10|mi|km}} of his birthplace. Their daughters, to whom Adams originally related the tales that became ''Watership Down'', are Juliet and Rosamond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=Jonathan|date=11 March 1985|title=Richard Adams Follows Up Watership Down and Shardik with An Erotic Epic Called Maia|publisher=[[People (magazine)|People]]|url=http://people.com/archive/richard-adams-follows-up-watership-down-and-shardik-with-an-erotic-epic-called-maia-vol-23-no-10/|access-date=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Blezard/&gt;

A '''runic inscription''' is an [[inscription]] made in one of the various [[runic alphabet]]s. The body of  runic inscriptions falls into the three categories of [[Elder Futhark]] (some 350 items, dating to between the 2nd and 8th centuries AD), [[Anglo-Frisian Futhorc]] (some 100 items, 5th to 11th centuries) and [[Younger Futhark]] (close to 6,000 items, 8th to 12th centuries).&lt;ref&gt;not including the inscriptions in [[medieval runes]] in Sweden, and the early modern and modern inscriptions in [[Dalecarlian runes]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/runic-alphabet|title=runic alphabet {{!}} writing system|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-05-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total 350 known inscriptions in the [[Elder Futhark]] script&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 2004:281&lt;/ref&gt; fall into two main geographical categories, [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] (Scandinavian, c. 267 items) and [[Continental Germanic|Continental or South Germanic]] ([[Old High German|"German"]] and Gothic, c. 81 items).&lt;ref&gt;Lüthi 2004:321&lt;/ref&gt; These inscriptions are on many types of loose objects, but the North Germanic tradition shows a preference for [[bracteate]]s, while the South Germanic one has a preference for [[Fibula (brooch)|fibula]]e. The precise figures are debatable because some inscriptions are very short and/or illegible so that it is uncertain whether they qualify as an inscription at all.

The division into Scandinavian, North Sea (Anglo-Frisian), and South Germanic inscription makes sense from the 5th century. In the 3rd and 4th centuries, the Elder Futhark script is still in its early phase of development, with inscriptions concentrated in what is now [[Denmark]] and [[Northern Germany]].

The tradition of runic literacy continues in Scandinavia into the [[Viking Age]], developing into the [[Younger Futhark]] script. Close to 6,000 Younger Futhark inscriptions are known, many of them on [[runestones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/runic.htm#yngrfuthark|title=Runic alphabets / Runes / Futhark|website=www.omniglot.com|access-date=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Estimates of total number of inscriptions produced===
Elder Futhark inscriptions were rare, with very few active literati, in relation to the total population, at any time, so that knowledge of the runes was probably an actual "secret" throughout the Migration period. Of 366 lances excavated at [[Illerup Ådal|Illerup]], only 2 bore inscriptions. A similar ratio is estimated for Alemannia, with an estimated 170 excavated graves to every inscription found (Lüthi 2004:323) 
Estimates of the total number of inscriptions produced are based on the "minimal runological estimate" of 40,000 (ten individuals making ten inscriptions per year for four centuries). The actual number was probably considerably higher,  maybe close to 400,000 in total, so that of the order of 0.1% of the corpus has come down to us), and Fischer (2004:281) estimates a population of several hundred active literati throughout the period, with as many as 1,600 during the Alamannic "runic boom" of the 6th century.

==Types of inscribed objects==
Especially the earliest inscriptions are found on all types of everyday objects. Later, a preference for valuable or prestigious objects (jewelry or weapons) seems to develop, inscriptions often indicating ownership.

==Early period (2nd to 4th centuries)==
{{Further|Alu (runic)|Erilaz}}
The earliest period of Elder Futhark (2nd to 4th centuries) predates the division in regional script variants, and linguistically essentially still reflect the [[Common Germanic]] stage. Their distribution is mostly limited to southern Scandinavia, northern Germany and Frisia (the "North Sea Germanic runic ''Koine''"), with stray finds associated with the [[Gothic runic inscriptions|Goths]] from [[Romania]] and [[Ukraine]].
Linguistically, the 3rd and 4th centuries correspond to the formation of [[Proto-Norse]], just predating the separation of [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] into [[Anglo-Frisian]], [[Old Saxon|Low German]] and [[Old High German|High German]].

==Scandinavian==
{{Further|Sveriges runinskrifter|bracteate|Runestone}}
About 260 items in Elder Futhark, and close to 6,000 items (mostly runestones) in Younger Futhark.
The highest concentration of Elder Futhark inscriptions is in Denmark.

An important [[Proto-Norse]] inscription was on one of the [[Golden horns of Gallehus]] (early 5th century). A total of 133 known inscriptions on bracteates. There are several legible and partly interpretable inscription that date from the 1st half of the 5th century such as a Silver neck ring found near [[Aalen]] with "noru" inscribed in runic alphabets on its inner edge. others discoveries were unearthed around Germany, Denmark, Norway, Hungary, Belgium, England and Bosnia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://odroerirjournal.com/download/LOOIJENGA%20Texts%20and%20Contexts%20of%20the%20Oldest%20Runic%20Inscriptions%202003.pdf|title=Runes, Runology and Runologists|last=Looijenga|first=Tineke|date=2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/3230056/c7.pdf|title=Runes around the North Sea and on the Continent AD 150-700|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest known [[runestone]]s date to the early 5th century ([[Einang stone]], [[Kylver Stone]]).
The longest known inscription in the Elder Futhark, and one of the youngest, consists of some 200 characters and is found on the early 8th-century [[Eggjum stone]], and may even contain a stanza of [[Old Norse poetry]].

The transition to [[Younger Futhark]] begins from the 6th century, with transitional examples like the [[Björketorp Runestone|Björketorp]] or [[Stentoften Runestone|Stentoften]] stones. In the early 9th century, both the older and the younger futhark were known and used, which is shown on the [[Rök Runestone]].
By the 10th century, only Younger Futhark remained in use.

==Anglo-Frisian==
{{Main|Futhorc#Inscriptions}}
Some 100 items spanning the 5th to 11th centuries. 
The 5th-century [[Undley bracteate]] is considered the earliest known Anglo-Frisian inscription.

The 8th-century [[Franks Casket]], preserved during the Middle Ages in [[Brioude]], central France, exhibits the longest coherent inscriptions in Anglo-Saxon runes by far, including five alliterating long-lines, qualifying as the oldest preserved Anglo-Saxon poetry.

While the Nordic bracteates are jewelry imitating Roman gold coins, there were a number of actual coins (currency) in  Anglo-Saxon England inscribed with runes, notably the coins from Kent, inscribed with  ''pada'', ''æpa'' and ''epa'' (early 7th century).

There are a number of Christian inscriptions from the time of [[Christianization of the Anglo-Saxons|Christianization]].
[[St. Cuthbert's coffin]], dated to 698, even has a runic [[monogram of Christ]], and the Whitby II bone comb (7th century) has a pious plea for God's help, ''deus meus, god aluwaldo, helpæ Cy…'' "my God, almighty God, help Cy…". The [[Ruthwell Cross]] inscription could also be mentioned, but its authenticity is dubious; it might have been added only in the 10th century.

Unlike the situation on the continent, the tradition of runic writing does not disappear in England after Christianization but continues for a full three centuries, disappearing after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]]. A type of object unique to Christianized Anglo-Saxon England are the six known [[Anglo-Saxon runic rings]] of the 9th to 10th centuries.

==Continental==
{{Further|Elder Futhark#Continental inscriptions}}
Apart from the earliest inscriptions found on the continent along the North Sea coast (the  "North Germanic ''Koine''", Martin 2004:173), continental inscriptions can be divided in those of the "Alemannic runic province"  (Martin 2004), with a few dozen examples dating to the 6th and 7th centuries, and those associated with the [[Goths]], loosely scattered along the Oder  to south-eastern Poland, as far as the [[Carpathian Mountains]] (e.g. the [[ring of Pietroassa]] in Romania), dating to the 4th and 5th centuries.
The cessation of both the Gothic and Alemannic runic tradition coincides with the Christianization of the respective peoples.

Lüthi (2004:321) identifies a total of about  81 continental inscriptions found south of the "North Germanic Koine".  Most of these originate in southern Germany ([[Baden-Württemberg]] and [[Bavaria]]), with a single one found south of the [[Rhine]] ([[Bülach fibula]], found in [[Bülach]], [[Switzerland]]), and a handful from Eastern Europe (Poland, Romania, Ukraine).

A silver-plated copper disk, originally part of a sword-belt, found at [[Liebenau, Lower Saxony]] with an early 5th-century runic inscription (mostly illegible, interpreted as possibly reading ''rauzwih'') is classed as the earliest South Germanic (German) inscription known by the [[Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde|RGA]] (vol. 6, p.&amp;nbsp;576); the location of Liebenau is close to the boundary of the North Sea and South Germanic zones.

[[Siglas Poveiras]] in [[Povoa de Varzim]], [[Portugal]] are also a type of writing based on the Viking runes. The siglas were first studied by António de Santos Graça in his book Epopeia dos Humildes ("The Odyssey of the Humble"). Published in 1952, the book contains hundreds of siglas and the history and maritime tragedy of Póvoa. Other works of his are "O Poveiro" (The Poveiro, 1932), "A Crença do Poveiro nas Almas Penadas" (Poveiro Beliefs Regarding Dead Souls, 1933) e "Inscrições Tumulares por Siglas" (Tomb Inscriptions Using Siglas, 1942).

After a visit to the National Museet in Copenhagen, Octávio Lixa Filgueiras, by accident, found objects marked with "home-marks" from Funen in Denmark. Moreover, the complex hereditary mark system of Póvoa de Varzim was also found in Funen.

The Siglas development is at least, partly, attributed to Vikings that settled in the town during the 10th century and 11th century. This form of primitive writing developed within the community of Póvoa de Varzim was kept due to the practice of endogamy. Also, the similarity with the Scandinavian tradition of using specific bomärken ("homestead marks") for signatures and for marking property has also been noted.

===Gothic===
{{Main|Gothic runic inscriptions}}

Out of about a dozen candidate inscriptions,  only three are widely accepted to be of Gothic origin: the [[gold ring of Pietroassa]], bearing a votive inscription, part of a larger treasure found in the [[Romania]]n [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]], and two spearheads inscribed with what is probably the weapon's name, one found in the  [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] Carpathians, and the other in eastern Germany, near the [[Oder]].

The inscription on the  [[spearhead of Kovel]], found in Ukraine (now lost) is a special case. Its date is very early (3rd century) and it shows a mixture of runic and [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] letters, reading
&lt;TᛁᛚᚨᚱᛁDᛊ&gt; or &lt;TIᛚᚨRIDS&gt; (the ''i'', ''r'' and ''s'' letters being identical in the Elder Futhark and Latin scripts), and may thus reflect a stage of development before the runes became fixed as a separate script in its own right.

===Alemannic===
The known inscriptions from [[Alemannia]] mostly date to the century between AD 520 and 620. There are some 70 inscriptions in total, about half of them on fibulae. Some are explicitly dedications among lovers, containing ''leub'' "beloved", or in the case of the Bülach fibula ''fridil'' "lover".
Most were found in Germany, in the [[states of Germany|states]] of [[Baden-Württemberg]] and [[Bavaria]]. A lesser number originates in [[Hessen]] and [[Rheinland-Pfalz]], and outside of Germany there is a single example from Switzerland, and a small number of what are likely [[Burgundians|Burgundian]] inscriptions from eastern France.

The precise number of inscriptions is debatable, as some proposed inscriptions consist of a single sign, or a row of signs that may also be "rune-like", in imitation of writing, or purely ornamental. For example, a ring found in [[Bopfingen]] has been interpreted as being inscribed with a single ''g'', i.e. a simple X-shape that may also be ornamental. Most interpretable inscriptions contain personal names, and only ten inscriptions contain more than one interpretable word. Of these, four translate to "(PN) wrote the runes".&lt;ref&gt;Karin Lüthi, 'South Germanic runic inscriptions as testimonies of early literacy'', in:  Marie Stoklund, Michael Lerche Nielsen, Gillian Fellows-Jensen, Bente Holmberg (eds.), ''Runes and their secrets: studies in runology, Volume 2000'', Museum Tusculanum Press, 2006, 172f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The other six "long" interpretable inscriptions are:
*[[Pforzen buckle]]: '''aigil andi aïlrun''' /  '''ltahu gasokun''' ("Aigil and Ailrun fought [at the Ilz River?]")
*[[Nordendorf fibulae|Nordendorf I fibula]]: '''logaþorewodanwigiþonar''' (three theonyms, or "Wodan and Wigi-þonar are magicians/sorcerers")
*[[Schretzheim]] case: ''' arogisd ''' / '''alaguþleuba : dedun''' ("Arogast / Alaguth [and] Leubo (Beloved) made it")
*Schretzheim fibula: ''' siþwagadin leubo''' ("to the Traveller (Wotan?), [from] Leubo (Beloved)", or perhaps "love to my travel-companion" or similar)&lt;ref&gt;[[Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde]], s.v. "Schretzheim".&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Osthofen]]: '''madali umbada''' ("Madali, protection")
*[[Bad Ems]] fibula: '''god fura dih deofile''' ("God for/before you, devil/Theophilus". The inscription is one of the youngest of the Alemannic sphere, dating to between 660 and 690, and clearly reflects a Christianized background).&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Jungandreas, 'God fura dih, deofile †' in: Zeitschrift für deutsches Altertum und deutsche Literatur, 101, 1972, pp. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable inscriptions:
*[[Bülach fibula]]: '''frifridil du aftm'''
*Wurmlingen spearhead, from an Alemannic grave in [[Wurmlingen]], inscription read as a personal name '''(i)dorih''' (''{{lang|goh|Ido-rīh}}'' or ''{{lang|goh|Dor-rīh}}'')
*Schretzheim [[ring-sword]]: the sword blade has four runes arranged so that the staves form a cross. Read as '''arab''' by Düwel (1997). Schwab (1998:378) reads '''abra''', interpreting it as abbreviating the magic word [[Abraxas]], suggesting influence of the [[magic in the Greco-Roman world|magic traditions]] of Late Antiquity, and the Christian practice of arranging monograms on the arms of a cross.
*[[Kleines Schulerloch inscription]], of dubious authenticity and possibly a hoax. Considered an obvious falsification by Looijenga (2003: 223). Reads '''birg : leub : selbrade'''.

A small number of inscriptions found in eastern [[France]] may be [[Burgundians#Language|Burgundian]] rather than Alemannic:
*the [[Arguel inscription|Arguel pebble]] (considered an obvious falsification by Looijenga): '''arbitag | wodan | luïgo[?h]aŋzej | kim |'''
*the [[Charnay Fibula]]: '''fuþarkgwhnijïpʀstbem | ' uþf[?]þai ' id | dan ' (l)iano | ïia | [?]r |'''

===Frankish===
Very few inscriptions can be associated with the [[Franks]], reflecting their early Romanization and Christianization. An important find is the [[Bergakker inscription]], suggested as recording 5th-century [[Old Frankish]].
The only other inscription definitely classified as Frankish is the Borgharen buckle, reading ''bobo'' (a Frankish personal name).&lt;ref&gt;Looijenga, Tineke. , Two Runic finds from the Netherlands - both with a Frankish connection. In: Essays on the early Franks, ed. Taayke, Ernst. Barkhuis 2003, 231-240.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4824">'''Same-gender-loving''', or '''SGL''', a term coined for [[African American]] use by activist [[Cleo Manago]], is a description for [[Homosexuality|homosexuals]] and [[Bisexuality|bisexuals]] in the African American community. It emerged in the early 1990s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Communities of African Descent Media Resource Kit|work=Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation|url=http://www.glaad.org/poc/coad/coad_media_kit.php|accessdate=2007-02-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061002013523/http://www.glaad.org/poc/coad/coad_media_kit.php|archivedate=2006-10-02}}
&lt;/ref&gt; as a culturally affirming African American homosexual identity.

SGL was adapted as an [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] alternative to what are deemed Eurocentric homosexual identities (e.g. [[gay]] and [[lesbian]]) which do not culturally affirm or engage the history and cultures of people of African descent. The term SGL usually has broad, important and positive personal, social, and political purposes and consequences. SGL is anti-hate and anti-anti-Black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Manago|first=Cleo|title=What is Same Gender Loving?|url=http://bmxnational.org/faqs/what-is-same-gender-loving|accessdate=16 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015005535/http://bmxnational.org/faqs/what-is-same-gender-loving/|archivedate=15 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because most men of color do not self-label as gay or bisexual, the phrase same-gender-loving youths was selected to describe this population. This phrase currently is used by men of color in major urban centers as a {{sic|hide=y|culturally|-}}informed self-label related to their sexual orientation identity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term AGL / All Gender Loving is slowly being recognized as well. AGL is a label for bisexual and pansexual Black people. The word's origin is unknown, though it is most commonly attributed to Black LGBTQ+ people who are active in gender/sexuality discussions across social media.

The National Black Men's Xchange is the oldest and largest US "community-based movement devoted to promoting healthy self-concept and behavior, cultural affirmation and critical consciousness among same-gender loving (SGL), gay-identifying and bisexual African-descended males and allies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Founder of Black Men’s Xchange Issues Statement Regarding CNN’s Don Lemon|url=http://www.dogonvillage.com/?p=2168|accessdate=6 January 2011|author=villagechief}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6118">{{Canadian Charter}}
'''Section 19''' of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'' is one of the provisions of the [[Constitution of Canada]] that addresses rights relating to [[Canada]]'s two [[official language]]s, [[English (language)|English]] and [[French (language)|French]].  Like section 133 of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'', section 19 allows anyone to speak English or French in federal [[Court system of Canada|courts]].  However, only section 133 extends these rights to [[Quebec]] courts, while section 19 extends these rights to courts in [[New Brunswick]].  New Brunswick is the only officially bilingual province under [[Section Sixteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 16]] of the ''Charter''.

==Text==
Section 19 reads,

{{cquote|19.(1)  Either English or French may be used by any person in, or in any pleading in or process issuing from, any court established by Parliament.

(2)  Either English or French may be used by any person in, or in any pleading in or process issuing from, any court of New Brunswick.}}


Section 19 is based on rights in section 133 of the ''Constitution Act, 1867.''  Section 133 provides that "either of those Languages may be used by any Person or in any Pleading or Process in or issuing from any Court of Canada established under this Act, and in or from all or any of the Courts of Quebec."  However, unlike section 133, section 19(2) extends these rights to courts in New Brunswick.  This was not entirely new, as section 13(1) of the ''Official Languages of New Brunswick Act'' (1973) provided for [[statute|statutory]] language rights in New Brunswick courts.  Still, the wording of section 19(2) follows section 133 more closely than section 13(1).  In the 1986 [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] case ''[[Société des Acadiens v. Association of Parents]]'', Justice [[Jean Beetz]] found this to be significant.  Since section 133 rights are limited, constitutional language rights in New Brunswick courts are more limited than rights under section 13(1).&lt;ref name="Beetz"&gt;Beetz J., ''Société des Acadiens v. Association of Parents'', [1986] 1 S.C.R. 549.&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 13(1) reads,
{{cquote|13(1). Subject to section 15, in any proceeding before a court, any person appearing or giving evidence may be heard in the official language of his choice and such choice is not to place that person at any disadvantage.}}

Under section 23 of the [[Manitoba Act]], people in [[Manitoba]] courts have rights similar to those in section 133.  Hence, New Brunswick, Manitoba, and Quebec are the only provinces whose court systems constitutionally must provide such rights.&lt;ref&gt;Peter W. Hogg, ''Constitutional Law of Canada'', 2003 Student Ed. (Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003), page 1145.&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 19(2) was controversial when the Charter was being negotiated.  The Barristers' Society of New Brunswick considered the proposed provision and argued that over 90% of New Brunswick lawyers spoke only English and the section might emphasize the language of lawyers more so than their clients.&lt;ref name="Bastarache"&gt;Bastarache, Michel, Andre Braen, Emmanuel Didier and Pierre Foucher, ''Language Rights in Canada'', ed. Michel Bastarache, trans. Translation Devinat et Associés, Ottawa, (Montréal, Quebec:  Editions Yvon Blais, 1987), p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
In ''Société des Acadiens'', Justice Beetz ruled that section 19 of the ''Charter'' and section 133 of the ''Constitution Act, 1867'' established a right to speak in either English or French.  However, neither section went so far as to guarantee a person speaking in either English or French would be understood by the judge or judges.  Under these sections it would be possible for a judge who understood only one of the two languages to preside over a case in which someone chose to speak the other language.  Beetz did not want such a situation, however, and felt that the right to be understood was protected by basic principles of [[fundamental justice]] found in [[Section Seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|sections 7]] and [[Section Fourteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|14]] of the ''Charter''.  Since this is a right established under fundamental justice and not the official language provisions, it was a right belonging to anyone regardless of whether they speak English, French or a non-official language.  This interpretation was influenced by past interpretations of section 133, including the interpretation of similar language rights in the [[Parliament of Canada]] found in section 133 and [[Section Seventeen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 17 of the ''Charter'']]. 

This interpretation of section 19 has been disputed.  In the same case, [[Chief Justice of Canada|Chief Justice]] [[Brian Dickson]] and Justice [[Bertha Wilson]] both found that a right to be understood by a judge regardless of whether one chooses to speak English or French could be found in the [[penumbra]] of section 19.&lt;ref name="Beetz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, pages 1147-1148.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the restrictive interpretation of language rights in ''Société des Acadiens'' was largely overturned in [[R. v. Beaulac]].

'''Sudarshan Mahasthavir''' ([[Devanagari]]: सुदर्शन महास्थविर) (alternative name: '''Sudarshan Bhante''', born '''Lumbini Raj Shakya''') (1938–2002) was a Nepalese [[Buddhist monk]] and author who played a major role in the development of [[Theravada Buddhism]] in Nepal and [[Nepal Bhasa]] literature. He was jailed by Nepal's repressive [[Panchayat (Nepal)|Panchayat]] regime for his activities supporting language rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=LeVine|first1=Sarah|last2=Gellner|first2=David N.|publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2005 |pages=109, 296 |title=Rebuilding Buddhism: The Theravada Movement in Twentieth-Century Nepal |edition= |url= |isbn=978-0-674-01908-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shrestha|first=Ishwari Maiya|publisher=Bhikshu Sudarshan Memorial Group |year=2010 |page=12 |title=Bhikshu Sudarshan wa Waykah ya Kriti Dhalah |edition= |url= |accessdate=|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Sudarshan was born Lumbini Raj Shakya at OkuL Baha, [[Patan, LalitApur|Lalitpur]]. His father was Nhuchhe Raj Shakya and mother Harkha Maya Shakya. In 1950, he travelled to [[Kushinagar]], India to be ordained a novice monk and was given the dharma name Sudarshan. He received higher ordination in [[SarnathA|Sarnath]].

==Teacher and writer==

Sudarshan graduated in literature in [[Hindi]] in 1954 and in Nepal Bhasa in 1967. He went on to receive a master's degree in Nepalese history, culture and archeology in 1979. He taught at various schools and was a lecturer at [[Tribhuvan University]], [[Kathmandu]].

Sudarshan was a prolific writer, and greatly enriched the corpus of Nepal Bhasa literature. His favourite genre was drama, and he has written more than nine plays, most of them based on Buddhist themes. He also wrote short stories and poetry. In addition to Nepal Bhasa, he has written in [[Nepali language|Nepali]] and English. A number of his books on Buddhism have been prescribed as course books at the bachelor and Master's levels by Tribhuvan University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.lumbini.org.uk/bd_n_thera_t.html|title = Theravada Buddhism in Modern Nepal | work = | publisher = Lumbini Nepalese Buddha Dharma Society (UK)| date=2008| accessdate =6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also engaged in journalism, and has been the editor of ''[[Nepal Bhasa Patrika]]'' daily, ''[[Dharmodaya]]'' and ''Lumbini'' monthlies and ''Purnima'' annual.

Sudarshan was a member of the preparatory committee formed by the [[Lumbini Development Trust]] to establish a Buddhist university. Under its initiative, [[Lumbini Buddha University|Lumbini Bauddha University]] was founded in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =| first =| authorlink = | coauthors = |url = http://www.lbu.edu.np/| title =Lumbini Buddhist University | work = | publisher =| date=| accessdate = 2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sudarshan became the abbot of Shri Kirti Vihara, a Theravada Buddhist monastery built in [[Thai people|Thai]] architectural style, which he established in [[Kirtipur]] in 1989. He also founded the Shri Kirti Buddhist Center here to teach Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=LeVine|first1=Sarah|last2=Gellner|first2=David N.|publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2005 |page=166 |title=Rebuilding Buddhism: The Theravada Movement in Twentieth-Century Nepal |edition= |url= |isbn=978-0-674-01908-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.lumbini.org.uk/bd_n_thera_t.html|title = Theravada Buddhism in Modern Nepal | work = | publisher = Lumbini Nepalese Buddha Dharma Society (UK)| date=2008| accessdate =6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imprisonment==

Sudarshan was active in the [[Nepal Bhasa movement]]. In 1965, the Panchayat regime (1962–1990) banned Nepal Bhasa from being broadcast over state-run [[Radio Nepal]], the only radio station in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Maharjan | first = Basanta | authorlink = | coauthors = | url = https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:u07wVOvD30YJ:www.socialinclusion.org.np/download.php%3Fp%3DresearchReport%26f%3D7996_Finalreport.doc+nepal+bhasa+radio+1965&amp;hl=en&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESi9256j5vkAtxFmzLXi31AD1N_do6qcAL7_ULYcy41D7GeijuqJfwFf6QOzNSGbBVqAtC19vXNAftsB0vo841MGc1Igbje0xHXvmIkJtrPZcGLYjePEFO3Vvf1DUbefX-eLE5sX&amp;sig=AHIEtbTzWjezYJYvu6s-gHS7nSKs5N3RFw

==Honors and publications==

On 31 December 2012, the Postal Services Department of the government of Nepal issued a commemorative postage stamp depicting the portrait of Sudarshan to honor his contribution to the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Commemorative stamps issued|url=http://epaper.ekantipur.com/ktpost/showtext.aspx?boxid=4059500&amp;parentid=21107&amp;issuedate=112013|accessdate=3 January 2013|newspaper=The Kathmandu Post|date=1 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202235553/http://epaper.ekantipur.com/ktpost/showtext.aspx?boxid=4059500&amp;parentid=21107&amp;issuedate=112013|archivedate=2 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, he was decorated with the title Bhasa Thuwa (Patron of the Language) by Nepal Bhasa Parishad for his service to Nepal Bhasa. His play ''Juju Jaya Prakash'' ("King Jaya Prakash"), on the last king of Kathmandu [[Jaya Prakash Malla]], was awarded the Shrestha Sirapa in 1958.

In a writing career spanning 1951–2002, Sudarshan produced plays, biographies, translations, essays and poetry. He has published more than 75 books in Nepal Bhasa and four in Nepali. His plays are ''Ambapali'' (1955), ''Rastrapal'' (1958), ''Amritmaya Maun'' (1958), ''Juju Jaya Prakash'' (1962), ''85 Pau'' (1962), ''Ashanka'' (1971), ''Pratishodh'' (1986), ''Nirvana'' (1993) and ''Patachara'' (1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shrestha|first=Ishwari Maiya|publisher=Bhikshu Sudarshan Memorial Group |year=2010 |page= |title=Bhikshu Sudarshan wa Waykah ya Kriti Dhalah |edition= |url= |accessdate=|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7517">'''Sultan Mohammad Munadi''' ({{lang-ps|صئلتان هحامماد ئنادي}}; November 22, 1976&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; – September 9, 2009) was an [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] [[journalist]], reporter, [[production manager]] and [[translator]].  He worked for the [[International Red Crescent]], ''[[The New York Times]]'' and Afghan state radio at various times during his career in journalism. Munadi was killed by [[friendly fire]] on September 9, 2009, in a British [[Special Boat Service]] [[special forces]] raid meant to rescue [[Stephen Farrell (journalist)|Stephen Farrell]] and Munadi, who were both captured by Taliban forces near Kunduz four days earlier.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Munadi was born in Astana, [[Bazarak District]], in [[Panjshir province]], [[Afghanistan]],&lt;ref name=cpj&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Brief Biography, Sultan M. Munadi |url=http://cpj.org/blog/Sep%2014%20Sultan_Bio_English.pdf|work=[[Good Morning Afghanistan]]|publisher=[[Committee to Protect Journalists]]|date= |accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; on November 22, 1976.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Munadi, an ethnic [[Tajik people|Tajik]], grew up around the family's farm in the village of Astana in the [[Panjshir Valley]].&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|first=Eric |last=Schmitt |title=Colleagues Remember Sultan Munadi |url=http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/09/colleagues-remember-sultan-munadi/?scp=3&amp;sq=Sultan%20Munadi&amp;st=cse |work=[[New York Times]]|publisher=|date=2009-09-09 |accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father fought against [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces during the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; The family's home in Astana, which was used as a [[command post]] by the [[mujahedeen]], was bombed by Soviet troops.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Munadi and his brothers rebuilt the family home by hand following the bombing.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Munadi attended Amir Sharali Khan Primary School.  He graduated from Nadiria High School in 1991.&lt;ref name=cpj/&gt;

===Career===
Munadi was accepted into the [[journalism]] program at [[Kabul University]] in 1995.&lt;ref name=cpj/&gt; He also took a course in [[English language|English]] while studying journalism at the university.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; In 1996, the Taliban seized control of the city of Kabul, forcing Munadi to temporarily abandon his [[undergraduate]] studies.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; He eventually received his [[bachelor's degree]] in journalism from Kabul University.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Munadi worked as a [[press officer]] and liaison for the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent]]'s local office in [[Gulbahar]], [[Parwan Province]], during the period of [[Taliban]] control from 1997 until 2001.&lt;ref name=cpj/&gt; He coordinated communications between the office in northern Afghanistan and the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]] main [[headquarters]] in Kabul.&lt;ref name=cpj/&gt;

Munadi joined the Afghan staff of the ''[[New York Times]]'' in 2002, following the ouster of the Taliban and establishment of an interim government.&lt;ref name=cpj/&gt; Munadi worked as a local [[correspondent]] in the Kabul office for the New York Times and contributed reports to the headquarters in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=cpj/&gt;  He also translated [[Dari (Eastern Persian)|Dari]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]] and [[English language|English]] documents and reports for the newspaper.&lt;ref name=cpj/&gt;  Munadi remained with the New York Times until 2006.&lt;ref name=cpj/&gt;

In 2006, Munadi joined the staff of [[Good Morning Afghanistan]] (GMA), which is produced by AwaNama Productions.&lt;ref name=cpj/&gt; He was employed as a [[production manager]] for the radio show, and performed the tasks of [[editing|editor]], director and [[radio producer]].  He was later promoted to the editor of the show's website and radio broadcasts, and assigned stories to journalists.&lt;ref name=cpj/&gt;

Munadi moved to [[Germany]] in early 2009, where he enrolled in a graduate program at [[University of Erfurt|University of Erfurt School of Public Policy]]&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; towards a [[master's degree]] in [[public policy]], [[good governance]] and journalism.&lt;ref name=cpj/&gt;  He returned to Afghanistan from Germany twice during 2009.&lt;ref name=cpj/&gt;

===Kidnapping and death===
Munadi returned to Afghanistan from Germany during his summer break to visit his wife and two children. The ''New York Times'' contacted Munadi while he was in Afghanistan to ask him to assist its foreign correspondents in the country.&lt;ref name=cpj/&gt;

On September 5, 2009, Munadi and ''New York Times'' journalist [[Stephen Farrell (journalist)|Stephen Farrell]], a [[United Kingdom|British]]–[[Ireland|Irish]] colleague, were kidnapped by the [[Taliban]] in northern Afghanistan near [[Kunduz]]. Farrell and Munadi were in the area interviewing local residents about a recent [[NATO]] airstrike on two fuel tankers (that had been kidnapped by Taliban militants) which had allegedly killed Afghan civilians.&lt;ref name=nyt2/&gt;

Munadi and Farrell were held by Taliban militants for four days. The Taliban treated Farrell rather well, but were increasingly threatening and abusive to Munadi while he was in captivity. The Taliban reminded Munadi of a 2007 kidnapping in which an Italian reporter, [[Daniele Mastrogiacomo]], was freed while his Afghan translator was killed and beheaded. Munadi had called his parents at 10:30 pm on September 8 to report that he and Farrell were safe. His parents immediately left their home in Kabul to travel to Kunduz to await a possible release.&lt;ref name=nyt2&gt;{{cite news|first=Eric |last=Schmitt |title=As Menace to Hostages Grew, British Moved In |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/world/asia/10rescue.html?scp=4&amp;sq=Sultan%20Munadi&amp;st=cse |work=[[New York Times]]|publisher=|date=2009-09-09 |accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Military Intelligence discovered the house in which Munadi and Farrell were being held. On September 9, 2009, British [[Special Boat Service]] [[special forces]] raided the home to rescue the captives. Farrell was rescued, but Munadi was shot and killed in the firefight between the Taliban and British forces. It was later concluded that Munadi was shot in the front by a British soldier while he was also apparently shot by Taliban bullets while trying to get to the helicopter after the British mistook him for an enemy militant.&lt;ref name="JU"&gt;p.55-58, The British Army in Afghanistan 2006–14, Leigh Neville, Squadron-Signal, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Munadi's body was left at the scene and his parents reportedly had to collect his body themselves. Neither the ''New York Times'' nor the Munadi or Farrell families knew about the planned rescue attempt in advance. Munadi's death and the failure to retrieve his body resulted in widespread anger among Afghan journalists, claiming that Munadi's death revealed a double standard by international forces over the treatment of Western reporters versus local Afghan journalists.&lt;ref name=nyt2/&gt;&lt;ref name="JU" /&gt;

'''Telephony''' ({{IPAc-en|t|ə|ˈ|l|ɛ|f|ə|n|i}} {{respell|tə|LEF|ə-nee}}) is the field of technology involving the development, application, and deployment of [[telecommunication]] services for the purpose of electronic transmission of voice, fax, or data, between distant parties. The history of telephony is intimately linked to the invention and development of the [[telephone]].

Telephony is commonly referred to as the construction or operation of telephones and telephonic systems and as a system of telecommunications in which telephonic equipment is employed in the transmission of speech or other sound between points, with or without the use of wires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/telephony Dictionary.com] Telephony Definition&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used frequently to refer to computer hardware, software, and computer network systems, that perform functions traditionally performed by telephone equipment. In this context the technology is specifically referred to as Internet telephony, or [[voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP).

==Overview==
The first telephones were connected directly in pairs. Each user had a separate telephone wired to the locations he or she might wish to reach. This quickly became inconvenient and unmanageable when people wanted to communicate with more than a few people. The inventions of the [[telephone exchange]] provided the solution for establishing telephone connections with any other telephone in service in the local area. Each telephone was connected to the exchange via one wire pair, the [[local loop]]. Nearby exchanges in other service areas were connected with [[Trunking|trunk lines]] and long distance service could be established by relaying the calls through multiple exchanges.

Initially, switchboards were manually operated by an attendant, commonly referred to as the "[[switchboard operator]]".  When a customer cranked a handle on the telephone, it turned on an indicator on the board in front of the operator, who would then plug the operator headset into that jack and offer service. The caller had to ask for the called party by name, later by number, and the operator connected one end of a circuit into the called party jack to alert them.  If the called station answered, the operator disconnected their headset and completed the station-to-station circuit. Trunk calls were made with the assistance of other operators at other exchangers in the network.

In modern times, most telephones are plugged into [[telephone plug|telephone jacks]]. The jacks are connected by [[on-premises wiring|inside wiring]] to a [[drop (telecommunication)|drop]] wire which connects the building to a cable. Cables usually bring a large number of drop wires from all over a district [[access network]] to one wire center or telephone exchange. When a telephone user wants to make a [[telephone call]], equipment at the exchange examines the dialed [[telephone number]] and connects that [[telephone line]] to another in the same wire center, or to a trunk to a distant exchange. Most of the exchanges in the world are interconnected through a system of larger switching systems, forming the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN).

After the middle of the 20th century, fax and data became important secondary users of the network created to carry voices, and late in the century, parts of the network were upgraded with [[ISDN]] and [[DSL]] to improve handling of such traffic.

Today, telephony uses digital technology ([[digital telephony]]) in the provisioning of telephone services and systems. Telephone calls can be provided digitally, but may be restricted to cases in which the [[last mile]] is digital, or where the conversion between digital and analog signals takes place inside the telephone. This advancement has reduced costs in communication, and improved the quality of voice services. The first implementation of this, [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]], permitted all data transport from end-to-end speedily over telephone lines. This service was later made much less important due to the ability to provide digital services based on the [[IP protocol]].

Since the advent of personal computer technology in the 1980s, [[computer telephony integration]] (CTI) has progressively provided more sophisticated telephony services, initiated and controlled by the computer, such as making and receiving voice, fax, and data calls with [[telephone directory]] services and [[caller identification]]. The integration of telephony software and computer systems is a major development in the evolution of the automated office. The term is used in describing the computerized services of call centers, such as those that direct your phone call to the right department at a business you're calling. It's also sometimes used to describe the ability to use your personal computer to initiate and manage phone calls (in which case you can think of your computer as your personal call center).&lt;ref&gt;[http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/CTI What is CTI?] TechTarget&lt;/ref&gt; CTI is not a new concept and has been used in the past in large telephone networks, but only dedicated [[call center]]s could justify the costs of the required equipment installation. Primary telephone service providers are offering information services such as [[automatic number identification]], which is a telephone service architecture that separates CTI services from call switching and will make it easier to add new services. [[Dialed Number Identification Service]] (DNIS) on a scale is wide enough for its implementation to bring real value to business or residential telephone usage. A new generation of applications ([[middleware]]) is being developed as a result of standardization and availability of low cost computer telephony links.

=={{anchor|Digital telephony}} Digital telephony==
Starting with the introduction of the transistor, invented in 1947 by [[Bell Laboratories]], to amplification and switching circuits in the 1950s, and through development of computer-based [[electronic switching system]]s, the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN) has gradually evolved towards automation and digitization of signaling and audio transmissions.

'''Digital telephony''' is the use of [[digital electronics]] in the operation and provisioning of telephony systems and services. Since the 1960s a digital [[core network]] has replaced the traditional [[Analog signal|analog]] transmission and signaling systems, and much of the [[access network]] has also been digitized.

Digital telephony has dramatically improved the capacity, quality, and cost of the network. End-to-end [[Analog signal|analog]] telephone networks were first modified in the early 1960s by upgrading transmission networks with [[Digital Signal 1]] (DS1/T1) carrier systems, designed to support the basic 3&amp;nbsp;kHz voice channel by sampling the bandwidth-limited analog voice signal and encoding using [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]]. While digitization allows [[wideband voice]] on the same channel, the improved quality of a wider analog voice channel did not find a large market in the PSTN.

Later transmission methods such as [[SONET]] and [[fiber optic]] transmission further advanced digital transmission. Although analog carrier systems existed that multiplexed multiple analog voice channels onto a single transmission medium, digital transmission allowed lower cost and more channels [[multiplexing|multiplexed]] on the transmission medium. Today the end instrument often remains analog but the analog signals are typically converted to [[Digital signal (signal processing)|digital signals]] at the [[serving area interface]] (SAI), central office (CO), or other aggregation point. [[Digital loop carrier]]s (DLC) and [[fiber to the x]] place the digital network ever closer to the customer premises, relegating the analog [[local loop]] to legacy status.

==IP telephony==
{{main|Voice over IP}}
[[File:Cisco7960G.jpg|thumb|A commercial IP telephone, with keypad, control keys, and screen functions to perform configuration and user features.]]
The field of technology available for telephony has broadened with the advent of new communication technologies. Telephony now includes the technologies of Internet services and mobile communication, including video conferencing.

The new technologies based on [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) concepts are often referred to separately as voice over IP (VoIP) telephony, also commonly referred to as IP telephony or Internet telephony. Unlike traditional phone service, IP telephony service is relatively unregulated by government. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates phone-to-phone connections, but says they do not plan to regulate connections between a phone user and an IP telephony service provider.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

A specialization of digital telephony, Internet Protocol (IP) telephony involves the application of digital networking technology that was the foundation to the [[Internet]] to create, transmit, and receive telecommunications sessions over [[computer network]]s. Internet telephony is commonly known as [[voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP), reflecting the principle, but it has been referred with many other terms. VoIP has proven to be a [[disruptive technology]] that is rapidly replacing traditional telephone infrastructure technologies. As of January 2005, up to 10% of telephone subscribers in [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]] have switched to this digital telephone service. A January 2005 ''[[Newsweek]]'' article suggested that Internet telephony may be "the next big thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sheridan |first=Barrett |url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/6831938/site/newsweek/ |title=Newsweek - National News, World News, Health, Technology, Entertainment and more... - Newsweek.com |publisher=MSNBC |date= |accessdate=2010-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050118033848/http://msnbc.msn.com/id/6831938/site/newsweek/ |archivedate=January 18, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2006, many VoIP companies offer service to [[consumer]]s and [[business]]es.{{Update inline|date=September 2015}}

IP telephony uses an Internet connection and hardware [[IP phone]]s, analog telephone adapters, or [[softphone]] computer applications to transmit conversations encoded as [[data packet]]s. In addition to replacing plain old telephone service (POTS), IP telephony services compete with [[mobile phone]] services by offering free or lower cost connections via [[WiFi]] [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|hotspots]]. VoIP is also used on private networks which may or may not have a connection to the global telephone network.

==Social impact research==
Direct person-to-person communication includes non-verbal cues expressed in facial and other bodily articulation, that cannot be transmitted in traditional voice telephony. [[Video telephony]] restores such interactions to varying degrees. Social Context Cues Theory is a model to measure the success of different types of communication in maintaining the non-verbal cues present in face-to-face interactions. The research examines many different cues, such as the physical context, different facial expressions, body movements, tone of voice, touch and smell.

Various communication cues are lost with the usage of the telephone. The communicating parties are not able to identify the body movements, and lack touch and smell. Although this diminished ability to identify social cues is well known, Wiesenfeld, Raghuram, and Garud point out that there is a value and efficiency to the type of communication for different tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hosted PBX|url=http://www.hostedpbx.com.au|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They examine work places in which different types of communication, such as the telephone, are more useful than face-to-face interaction.

The expansion of communication to mobile telephone service has created a different filter of the social cues than the [[land-line]] telephone. The use of instant messaging, such as ''texting'', on mobile telephones has created a sense of community.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} In ''The Social Construction of Mobile Telephony'' it is suggested that each phone call and text message is more than an attempt to converse. Instead, it is a gesture which maintains the social network between family and friends. Although there is a loss of certain social cues through telephones, mobile phones bring new forms of expression of different cues that are understood by different audiences. New language additives attempt to compensate for the inherent lack of non-physical interaction.

Another social theory supported through telephony is the Media Dependency Theory. This theory concludes that people use media or a resource to attain certain goals. This theory states that there is a link between the media, audience, and the large social system.&lt;ref&gt;http://communicationtheory.org/media-dependency-theory/&lt;/ref&gt; Telephones, depending on the person, help attain certain goals like accessing information, keeping in contact with others, sending quick communication, entertainment, etc.

'''Ugaritic''' is an [[Extinct language|extinct]] [[Northwest Semitic languages|Northwest Semitic language]]. This article describes the grammar of the Ugaritic language. For more information regarding the Ugaritic language in general, see [[Ugaritic language]].

==Overview==
[[Ugaritic]] is an [[inflected]] language, and as a [[Semitic language]] its grammatical features are highly similar to those found in [[Arabic Language|Classical Arabic]] and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]. It possesses two [[Grammatical gender|genders]] (masculine and feminine), three [[grammatical case|cases]] for [[nouns]] and [[adjectives]] ([[nominative]], [[accusative]], and [[genitive]] [also, note the possibility of a locative case]) ; three numbers: (singular, dual, and plural); and [[grammatical aspect|verb aspects]] similar to those found in other Northwest Semitic languages. The word order for Ugaritic is [[verb–subject–object]] (VSO), [[Possession (linguistics)|possessed–possessor]] (NG), and [[noun]]–[[adjective]] (NA). Ugaritic is considered a conservative Semitic language, since it retains most of the [[Proto-Semitic]] [[phonemes]], the basic qualities of the [[vowel]], the case system, the word order of the Proto-Semitic ancestor, and the lack of the [[definite article]].

==Grammar==
===Word order===
The word order for Ugaritic is [[Verb]] [[Subject (grammar)|Subject]] [[Object (grammar)|Object]] (VSO), [[Subject  (grammar) |Subject]]  [[Object (grammar)|Object]]  [[Verb]] (SOV), [[Possession (linguistics)|possessed–possessor]] (NG), and [[noun]]–[[adjective]] (NA).

===Morphology===
Ugaritic, like all [[Semitic languages]], exhibits a unique pattern of stems consisting typically of "[[triliteral]]", or 3-[[consonant]] consonantal [[Root (linguistics)|roots]] (2- and 4-consonant roots also exist), from which [[nouns]], [[adjectives]], and [[verbs]] are formed in various ways: e.g. by inserting [[vowels]], doubling [[consonants]], and/or adding [[prefixes]], [[suffixes]], or [[infixes]].

===Verbs===
====Aspects====

Verbs in Ugaritic have 2 [[Grammatical aspect|aspects]]: [[Perfective|perfect]] for completed action (with [[pronoun|pronominal]] [[suffixes]]) and [[imperfective|imperfect]] for uncompleted action (with [[pronoun|pronominal]] [[prefixes]] and [[suffixes]]). [[Verb]] formation in Ugaritic is based on (like all [[Semitic languages]]) [[triliteral|triconsonantal roots]]. [[Affixes]] inserted into the [[root (linguistics)|root]] form different meanings. Taking the [[triliteral|root]] '''RGM''' (which means "to say") for example:

===Nouns===
[[Nouns]] in Ugaritic can be categorized according to their [[inflection]] into: [[grammatical cases|cases]] ([[nominative]], [[genitive]], and [[accusative]]), state (absolute and construct), [[gender]] (masculine and feminine), and [[grammatical number|number]] ([[singulative number|singular]], [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]], and [[plural]]).

====Case====
Ugaritic has three [[grammatical cases]] corresponding to: [[nominative]], [[genitive]], and [[accusative]]. Normally, [[singulative number|singular]] [[nouns]] take the ending&amp;nbsp;–u in the [[nominative]], -i in the [[genitive]] and&amp;nbsp;–a in the [[accusative]]. Using the word Malk- (king) and Malkat- (queen) for example:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!!![[Nominative]]!![[Genitive]]!![[Accusative]]
|-
|'''Masculine'''||Malku||Malki||Malka
|-
|'''Feminine'''||Malkatu||Malkati||Malkata
|}

As in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], some exceptional nouns (known as [[diptotes]]) have the [[suffix]] -a in the [[genitive]]. There is no Ugaritic equivalent for Classical Arabic [[nunation]] or Akkadian mimation.

====State====
[[Nouns]] in Ugaritic occur in two [[compound (linguistics)|states]]: [[absolute state|absolute]] and [[status constructus|construct]].
If a [[noun]] is followed by a [[genitive|genitival]] attribute ([[noun]] in the [[genitive]] or suffixed [[pronoun]]) it becomes a [[status constructus|construct]] (denoting possession). Otherwise, it is in the [[absolute state]]. Ugaritic, unlike [[Arabic]] and [[Hebrew]], has no [[definiteness|definite]] [[article (grammar)|article]].

====Gender====
[[Nouns]] which have no [[gender]] [[marker (linguistics)|marker]] are for the most part masculine, although some feminine [[nouns]] do not have a feminine [[marker (linguistics)|marker]]. However, these denote feminine beings such as ʼumm- (mother).  /-t/ is the feminine marker which is directly attached to the base of the noun.

====Number====
Ugaritic distinguishes between [[nouns]] based on quantity. All [[nouns]] are either [[singulative number|singular]] when there is one, [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]] when there are two, and [[plural]] if there are three or more.

=====Singular=====
The [[singulative number|singular]] has no [[marker (linguistics)|marker]] and is [[inflected]] according to its [[grammatical cases|case]].

=====Dual=====
The marker for the [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]] in the [[absolute state]] appears as /-m/. However, the [[Speech production|vocalization]] may be reconstructed as /-āmi/ in the [[nominative]] (such as malkāmi "two kings") and /-ēmi/ for the [[genitive]] and [[accusative]] (e.g. malkēmi). For the [[status constructus|construct state]], it is /-ā/ and /-ē/ respectively.

=====Plural=====
Ugaritic has only regular [[plurals]] (i.e. no [[broken plurals]]). Masculine [[absolute state]] [[plurals]] take the forms /-ūma/ in the [[nominative]] and /-īma/ in the [[genitive]] and [[accusative]]. In the [[status constructus|construct state]] they are /-ū/ and /-ī/ respectively.  The female afformative [[plural]] is /-āt/ with a [[grammatical cases|case]] [[marker (linguistics)|marker]] probably following the /-t/, giving /-ātu/ for the [[nominative]] and /-āti/ for the [[genitive]] and [[accusative]] in both [[absolute state|absolute]] and [[status constructus|construct state]].

===Adjectives===
[[Adjectives]] follow the [[noun]] and are [[declension|declined]] exactly like the preceding [[noun]].

===Personal pronouns===
====Independent personal pronouns====

Independent [[personal pronouns]] in Ugaritic are as follows (some forms are lacking because they are not in the [[Corpus language|corpus of the language]]):

{| class="wikitable"
!  colspan=2|Person
!  [[Singulative number|singular]]
!  [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]]

{{reflist |group=decimal |refs=
&lt;ref name=footnote1&gt;3rd person independent [[pronouns]] can occur in the [[genitive]] or [[accusative]] but are [[suffix]]ed with a /-t/.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

====Suffixed (or enclitic) pronouns====

[[Suffix]]ed (or [[enclitic]]) pronouns (mainly denoting the [[genitive]] and [[accusative]]) are as follows:

{| class="wikitable"

!  Plural
|-
! colspan=2|1st

|  -ka "your"
| rowspan=2| -kumā "your"
|  -kum- "your"
|-
!&lt;small&gt;feminine&lt;/small&gt;
|  -ki "your"
|  -kin(n)a "your"
|-
! rowspan=2|3rd
!&lt;small&gt;masculine&lt;/small&gt;
|  -hu "his"
|  rowspan=2|-humā "their"
|  -hum- "their"
|-
!&lt;small&gt;feminine&lt;/small&gt;
|  -ha "hers"
|  -hin(n)a "their"
|}
{{reflist |group=decimal |refs=
&lt;ref name=footnote1&gt;-nī is used for the [[nominative]], i.e. following a [[verb]] denoting the [[subject (grammar)|subject]].&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

'''Woleaian''' is the main language of the island of [[Woleai]] and surrounding smaller islands in the state of [[Yap]] of the [[Federated States of Micronesia]].  Woleaian is a [[Trukic languages|Trukic language]]. Within that family, its closest relative is [[Satawal]]ese, with which it is largely mutually intelligible.  Woleaian is spoken by approximately 1700 people.&lt;ref&gt;http://globalrecordings.net/en/language/18321&lt;/ref&gt; Woleai has a [[Woleai script|writing system]] of its own, a syllabary based on the Latin alphabet.

==Introduction==

===History===
Most Woleaian speakers or Woleaians as they are more commonly known as are mostly found in the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], and the Central and Eastern [[Caroline Islands]]. More specifically most of the speakers are found in [[Yap]] State in Micronesia where Woleaian is considered an official language. Most Woleaian speakers are classified as Pacific Islanders and [[Micronesian people|Micronesian]] (People-In-Country Profile). The island of Yap is broken up into two parts: Yap Proper, which is made up of [[Gagil]], [[Tomil]], [[Fanif]], [[Weloy]], and [[Rull]]—and the Yap Outer Islands, which is made up of [[Ulithi]], Faris/[[Sorol]], [[Ngulu Atoll|Ngulu]], [[Woleai]], [[Eauripik]], [[Ifalik]], [[Faraulep|Faraulap]], [[Elato]], [[Lamotrek]] and [[Satawal]]. Aside from Woleaian, many speakers in Yap and other nearby places speak other languages, like [[Yapese language|Yapese]], [[Satawalese language|Satawalese]], [[Ulithian language|Ulithian]], [[English language|English]], [[Chuukese language|Chuukese]], [[Kosraean language|Kosraean]], [[Pingelapese language|Pingelapese]], [[Pohnpeian language|Pohnpeian]], [[Mwoakilloan]], and some [[Asian language|Asian]] and [[Polynesian languages|Polynesian]] Languages (Yap Census Report, 2002).
The Woleaian language and culture is very important to the Woleaian people, as well as their history. The Woleaian history is passed down from generation to generation by storytelling. By doing so this helps to keep their language alive. As well as passing down their history, they also pass down their music, which is important to them. An important part of their culture is their clothing. Their clothing is so important to them that they have strict rules against wearing any type of western clothing. They also enjoy using canoes to get around instead of motorboats, and simple things like beautiful beaches and going fishing. They also enjoy working and spending time with their family and friends (Team).

===Population===
In 1987, a [[Yap]] Census was taken and reported that there were about 1,630 people speaking the language. 13 years later when the census was taken in 2000 there was an increase of speakers and about 5,000 people were speaking or knew the language. Of these 5,000 speakers about 4,500 of them spoke Woleaian as their first language and 500 of them as their second language (Yap Census Report, 2002).

===Classification===
Woleaian is classified as an [[Austronesian]], Malayo-Polynesian, Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, Oceanic, Central-Eastern Oceanic, Remote Oceanic, Micronesian, Micronesian Proper, Ponapeic-Trukic, Trukic language (Woleaian).

==Phonology==
Woleaian has [[gemination|geminate]] (long) consonants and vowels.

In the orthography of Sohn (1975), along with a few approximations in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], the inventory is,

{| class=wikitable
|+ Consonants
|- align=center
! short oral consonant 
| b {{IPA|[ɸʷ]}} || p || f || t || s || l || sh {{IPA|[ʃ]}} || r || g {{IPA|[x]}}
|- align=center
! equivalent geminate 
| bb {{IPA|[pːʷ]}} || pp || ff  || tt || ss || nn {{IPA|[nː]}} || colspan=2| ch {{IPA|[tʃ]}} || k {{IPA|[kː]}}
|- align=center
! nasal consonant 
| mw {{IPA|[mʷ]}} || m ||  || n ||  ||  ||  || || ng {{IPA|[ŋ]}} 
|- align=center
! semivowel 
| w ||  ||  || || || y {{IPA|[j]}} || ||
|}

Note that both ''sh'' and ''r'' become ''ch'' when long, and that ''l'' becomes ''nn''.


{| class=wikitable
|+ Vowels
|- align=center
| i || iu {{IPA|[y]}} || u
|- align=center
| e || eo {{IPA|[øː]}} || o
|- align=center
|  || a || oa {{IPA|[ɑː]}}
|}

Vowels occur long and short, except for ''eo'' and ''oa,'' which are only found long.

All simple vowels except ''a'' can occur as voiceless vowels in word-final position. (All simple vowels can also occur as word-final voiced vowels.) Though these voiceless vowels are generally not spelled out by native speakers, they represent an important change in pronunciation between words which are otherwise spelled the same. For example:

*''besh'' [beshi̥]        "hot"
*''besh'' [beshe̥]        "lime"
*''yalius'' [yaliusi̥u̥]   "ghost"
*''yalius'' [yaliuse̥]    "beard"
*''lamw'' [lamwu̥]        "mosquito"
*''lamw'' [lamwo̥]        "lagoon"



===Syllable structure===
In the Woleaian language words can have anywhere from one to three consonants in a row. Words may either have CV, CCV, CCCV, or VV [[syllable structures]], and words can end in consonants (Sohn, 1975).

==Grammar==

===Word Formation===
====Inflectional Patterns====
There are four [[Inflection|inflectional paradigms]] in Woleaian: possessive, objective, progressive, and plural.
=====Possessive=====
These suffixes, attached to nouns, convey the person and number of a possessor. There are seven regular possessive suffixes and one defective possessive suffix.

*''metal John''         'eyes of John'
*''metaar''             'their eyes'
*''metal John me Mary'' 'eyes of John and Mary'

=====Object=====
These suffixes occur with all transitive verbs and show person, number, and animateness of the object of that verb.

|}

=====Progressive=====
Progressive action is shown in Woleaian through reduplication of initial parts of verbs. For example: ''mil'' "to stay" becomes ''mimmil'' "to be staying."

=====Plural=====
Plurality of nouns is generally left up to context, but the plural marker ''ka'' is added when nouns are accompanied by a demonstrative pronoun.

===Basic word order===
Woleaian has many different sentences types—and the type of sentence determines the word order. The first types of sentences are major and minor sentences. [[Major sentences]] are expressions that contain a subject and a predicate. (Sohn, Woleaian Reference Grammar, 1975). Within a major sentence it can be broken up into two types, simple and complex sentences. Simple major sentences have a subject associated with a predicate. In a simple major sentence, the subject and predicates are interchangeable—so sometimes the subject comes first, and sometimes the predicate comes first. Simple major sentences can then be broken up into either equational or predicative. In an equational sentence the subject always follows the predicate, whether a question or statement. In predicative sentences, a subject or noun phrase usually follows a predicate. Two or more simple sentences together within one sentence produces a complex major sentence. Complex major sentences can either be coordinative or subordinative. [[Minor sentences]] are without "...a subject, a predicate, or both, but still express a complete thought.” (Sohn, Woleaian Reference Grammar, 1975). Just as major sentence can be divided into two types, so can minor sentences. Some refer back to the context and complete it, (completive), and some that appear independently, (exclamatory). (Sohn, Woleaian Reference Grammar, 1975). The problem with equational and predicative statement and question sentences in Woleaian is that you cannot differentiate between the question and statement based on how the words are arranged. An example of this in an equational sentence is ‘‘“Iiy semal sar skuul”’’, which can translate to “He is a student" or "is he a student?”—and in a predicative sentence, ‘‘“Go weri saw we”’’ which can translate to “You saw the child" or "Did you see the child?” (Sohn, Woleaian Reference Grammar, 1975).

===Reduplication===
Many words in Woleaian, especially verbs, use [[reduplication]], (Kennedy). They use both whole stem and partial reduplications “as initial or medial consonant doubling and initial or final reduplication,” (Sohn, Woleaian Reference Grammar, 1975). An example of this is the word ‘‘fiyefiy’’, which means to squeeze and comes from the word ‘‘fiya’’, which means squeeze it. Some nouns also use reduplication, like ‘‘ugoug’’ or gallbladder, which reduplicates the word ‘‘ug’’ for net. Reduplication in Woleaian can be found in adjectives—like the word ‘‘yangoyang’’, meaning to be yellow, yellowish of ginger color, which comes from the word yang, which means ginger. (Sohn &amp; Tawerilmang, Woleaian-English Dictionary, 1976). Another type of reduplication in Woleaian is reduplication-prefixation, which is when “a neutral verb has both reduplication and the causative prefix/” (Sohn, Woleaian Reference Grammar, 1975). An example of this is the Woleaian word ‘‘gareparep’’, which means to get close. This word comes from the words ‘‘garepa’’ meaning approach to it, and ‘‘rep’’, meaning to be near (Sohn, Woleaian Reference Grammar, 1975).

==Vocabulary==

===Indigenous vocabulary===
*‘‘file-file’’ means ‘to stir’
* ‘‘fitiye-tiye’’ means ‘to marry’
*‘‘maŋi-meŋi’’ means ‘to remember’
*‘‘masowe-sowe’’ means ‘to be strong’
*‘‘lewe-lewe’’ means ‘to lick’
*‘‘perase-rase’’ means ‘to scatter’
*‘‘gofeti-feti’’ means ‘to chip off’
*‘‘gare-gare’’ means ‘to broil’
*‘‘mmwutu’’ means ‘to vomit’
*‘‘cago’’ means ‘to hug’

===Loanwords===
Many loanwords in Woleaian come from [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and English.

Words from Spanish: (Sohn, Woleaian Reference Grammar, 1975)
*''baarekow'' from ''barco'' ('ship')
*''filooras'' from ''flora'' ('flower')
*''karebau'' from ''caribú'' ('caribou' in Spanish, 'cow' in Woleaian)

Words from Japanese: (Sohn &amp; Tawerilmang, Woleaian-English Dictionary, 1976)
*''geitei'' comes from the Japanese word ''heitai'' ('soldier')
*''koori'' comes from the Japanese word ''koori'' ('ice')
*''koomaru'' comes from the Japanese word ''komaru'' ('to be in trouble')
*''meeteto'' comes from the Japanese word ''omedetou'' ('congratulations/happy holidays' in Japanese; 'New Year' in Woleaian)
*''taiko'' comes from the Japanese word ''taiko'' (drum)

Words from English: (Sohn &amp; Tawerilmang, Woleaian-English Dictionary, 1976)
*''felaaki'' means ‘flag’
*''feraipaang'' means ‘fry pan’
*''iinch'' means ‘inch’
*''kolook'' means ‘clock’
*''mariiken'' means ‘America’
*'' baibai'' means 'papaya'

==Endangerment==

===Materials===
There are many resources on the Woleaian language—including books, websites, research papers, and even YouTube videos. Two books in particular are helpful in learning about the Woleaian language: the [[Woleaian Reference Grammar]] book by Ho-Min Sohn, and a Woleaian-English Dictionary by Ho-Min Sohn and Anthony Tawerilmang. These two books contain much information about the Woleaian language, such as the sentence structures, types of reduplication, vocabulary, etc. Many websites contain useful information. The 2000 Yap Census also provides information about the language and speakers. A few research papers are helpful as well. One by Tsz-him Tsui from the University of Hawaii at Manoa describes the Woleaian vocabulary and phonemes. A paper by Robert Kennedy from the University of Arizona is about Woleaian reduplication. Lastly, a YouTube channel provides Woleaian videos. Some of the videos are of church services, cultural dances similar to the [[hula]], and Woleaian people singing Woleaian songs.

===Vitality===
Woleaian, under the [[Expanded Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale]] (EGIDS, which determines the status of a language, is level five, a developing language. This means that it “is in vigorous use, with literature in a standardized form being used by some people, though it is not yet widespread or sustainable.” (Lewis, Simons &amp; Fennig, 2013). From the rapid growth of Woleaian in 1987 to 2000 it is pretty safe to say that Woleaian is being transmitted and taught to young children. There is intergenerational transmission involved in Woleaian because of its language status on the EGIDS. It is described as a developing language in vigorous use—which means that the Woleaian speakers must pass it down from generation to generation.

'''Xiang''' or '''Hsiang''' ({{zh|s=湘|p=xiāng}}; {{IPA-cmn|ɕi̯ɑ́ŋ}}), also known as '''Hunanese''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|ˌ|h|uː|n|ɑː|ˈ|n|iː|z}}),  is a group of linguistically similar and historically related [[varieties of Chinese]], spoken mainly in [[Hunan]] province but also in northern [[Guangxi]] and parts of neighboring [[Guizhou]] and [[Hubei]] provinces. Scholars divided Xiang into five subgroups, Chang-Yi, Lou-Shao, Hengzhou, Chen-Xu and Yong-Quan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=鲍|first=鲍|author2=陈晖 |script-title=zh:湘语的分区（稿）|journal=方言|date=24 August 2005|issue=2005年第3期|pages=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those, Lou-shao, also known as Old Xiang, still exhibits the three-way distinction of [[Middle Chinese]] [[obstruent]]s, preserving the [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] [[stop consonant|stop]]s, [[fricative consonant|fricative]]s, and [[affricate consonant|affricate]]s. Xiang has also been heavily influenced by [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], which adjoins three of the four sides of the Xiang speaking territory, and [[Gan Chinese|Gan]] in [[Jiangxi Province]], from where a large population immigrated to Hunan during the [[Ming Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=徐 |first=明  |script-title=zh:60%湖南人是从江西迁去的 专家：自古江西填湖广 |url=http://jx.people.com.cn/n/2013/0714/c190181-19069374.html |publisher=人民网 |accessdate=17 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221184756/http://jx.people.com.cn/n/2013/0714/c190181-19069374.html |archivedate=February 21, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Ancient ages===
During Qin and Han dynasty, most part of today's Eastern Hunan belonged to [[Changsha|Changsha-Xian/Changsha-Guo]]. According to [[Yang Xiong (author)|Yang Xiong]]'s ''[[Fangyan]]'', people in this region spoke Southern [[Chu language|Chu]], which is considered the ancestor of Xiang Chinese today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |script-title=zh:汉语方言槪要|volume=|author=袁家骅|editor=|edition=|publisher=|year=1983|location=|page=333|pages=|isbn=9787801264749|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle ages and recent history===
During the [[Tang dynasty]], a large-scale emigration took place with people emigrating from the north to the south, bringing Middle Chinese into Hunan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |script-title=zh:旧唐书|volume=地理志|author=|editor=|edition=|publisher=|location=|page=|pages=|isbn=|quote={{lang|zh-hans|中原多故，襄邓百姓，两京衣冠，尽投江湘，故荆南井邑，十倍其初，乃置荆南节度使。}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today's Xiang still keeps some Middle Chinese words, such as {{lang|zh|嬉}} (to have fun), {{lang|zh|薅}} (to weed), {{lang|zh|行}} (to walk). [[Entering tone]] vowels started weakening in Hunan at this time.

The late [[Yuan Dynasty]] peasant uprising caused a great many casualties in Hunan. During the [[Ming dynasty]], a large-scale emigration from [[Jiangxi]] to [[Hunan]] took place. [[Gan Chinese|Gan]], which was brought by settlers from Jiangxi, influenced Xiang. The speech in east Hunan differentiated into [[New Xiang]] during that period.

[[Quanzhou County]] became part of [[Guangxi]] province after the adjustment of administrative divisions in the Ming Dynasty. Some features of Xiang at that time were kept in this region.

==Classification==
[[File:Xiang in hunan.png|thumb|right|Dialect map of [[Hunan]] Province. [[New Xiang]] orange, [[Old Xiang]] yellow, [[Chen-Xu Xiang]] light red. [[Xiangnan Tuhua]] dark green and medium green. &lt;br&gt;Note other dialects are shown in larger areas than in the next map. [[Hakka]] pink, Southwestern Mandarin light blue, medium blue, light green, and [[Waxianghua|Waxiang]] dark blue]]

Since the classification of [[Yuan Jiahua]] (1960), Xiang has been considered one of seven major groups of [[varieties of Chinese]].{{sfn|Norman|1988|p=181}}
[[Jerry Norman (sinologist)|Jerry Norman]] classified Xiang, [[Gan Chinese|Gan]] and [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], as central groups, intermediate between the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] group to the north and the southern groups, [[Min Chinese|Min]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] and [[Yue Chinese|Yue]].{{sfn|Norman|1988|pp=181–183}}

In Xiang dialects, the voiced initials of [[Middle Chinese]] yield unaspirated initials in all tone categories.  A few varieties have retained voicing in all tones, but most have voiceless initials in some or all tone categories.{{sfn|Norman|1988|p=207}}

Pervasive influence from Mandarin dialects has made Xiang dialects difficult to classify.{{sfn|Norman|1988|p=207}}
Xiang is traditionally divided into [[New Xiang]], in which voicing has been lost completely, and [[Old Xiang]] varieties, which retain voiced initials in at least some tones.
[[Changsha dialect]] is usually taken as representative of New Xiang, while [[Shuangfeng dialect]] represents Old Xiang.{{sfn|Yan|2006|p=107}}
Norman describes the boundary between New Xiang and [[Southwestern Mandarin]] as one of the weakest in China, with considerable similarities between dialects near either side of the boundary, though more distant dialects are mutually unintelligible.{{sfn|Norman|1988|p=190}}
Indeed, [[Zhou Zhenhe]] and You Rujie (unlike most authors) classified New Xiang as part of [[Southwestern Mandarin]].{{sfn|Zhou|You|1986}}{{sfn|Kurpaska|2010|p=55}}
Within New Xiang and Old Xiang, there are also many different sub-dialects.

The ''[[Language Atlas of China]]'' identified a third subgroup, [[Ji-Xu Xiang|Ji-Xu]] in some places of Western Hunan.{{sfn|Yan|2006|p=114}}
Bao &amp; Chen (2007) split out part of New Xiang as a new Hengzhou Xiang subgroup, and part of Old Xiang out as a Yong-Quan Xiang subgroup.
They also reclassified parts of the Ji–Xu subgroup as Southwest Mandarin, renaming the remainder of the subgroup as [[Chen-Xu Xiang]].
Their five subgroups are:

;[[New Xiang]]
:(17.8 million speakers) voiced initials in Middle Chinese become unaspirated voiceless consonant. Most of the dialects of New Xiang retain the [[entering tone]] as a separate category.
;[[Old Xiang]]
:(11.5 million speakers) Voiced initials still exist. The entering tone does not exist in most of the dialects.
;[[Chen-Xu Xiang]]
:(3.4 million speakers) Some of the voiced consonants are retained.
;[[Hengzhou Xiang]]
:(4.3 million speakers)
;[[Yong-Quan Xiang]]
:(6.5 million speakers) Voiced consonants still exist. Sometimes Yong-Quan dialects are considered a variety of Old Xiang.

==Geographic distribution==

Xiang is spoken by over 36 million people in China, primarily in the most part of the [[Hunan]] province, and in the four counties of [[Quanzhou County|Quanzhou]], [[Guanyang County|Guanyang]], [[Ziyuan County|Ziyuan]], and [[Xing'an County|Xing'an]] in northeastern [[Guangxi]] province, and in several places of [[Guizhou]] and [[Guangdong]] provinces. It is abutted by Southwestern Mandarin-speaking areas to the north and west, as well as by [[Gan Chinese|Gan]] in the eastern parts of Hunan and [[Jiangxi]]. Xiang is also in contact with the [[Qo Xiong language|Qo-Xiong Miao]] and [[Tujia language|Tujia]] languages in West Hunan.
