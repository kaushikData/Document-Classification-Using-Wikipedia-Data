      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11616">'''Agroecosystem analysis''' is a thorough analysis of an [[agricultural]] environment which considers aspects from [[ecology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]], and [[politics]] with equal weight. There are many aspects to consider; however, it is literally impossible to account for all of them. This is one of the issues when trying to conduct an analysis of an agricultural environment. In the past, an agroecosystem analysis approach might be used to determine the [[sustainability]] of an agricultural system. It has become apparent, however, that the "sustainability" of the system depends heavily on the definition of sustainability chosen by the observer. Therefore, agroecosystem analysis is used to bring the richness of the true complexity of agricultural systems to an analysis to identify reconfigurations of the system (or ''holon'') that will best suit individual situations.

[[Agroecosystem]] analysis is a tool of the multidisciplinary subject known as [[Agroecology]]. Agroecology and agroecosystem analysis are not the same as [[sustainable agriculture]], though the use of agroecosystem analysis may help a farming system ensure its viability. Agroecosystem analysis is not a new practice, [[agriculturalists]] and [[farmers]] have been doing it since societies switched from hunting and gathering ([[hunter-gatherer]]) for food to settling in one area. Every time a person involved in agriculture evaluates their situation to identify methods to make the system function in a way that better suits their interests, they are performing an agroecosystem analysis.

== Agroecosystem analysis and sustainable agriculture differ ==

It is difficult to discuss these differences without the aid of an example. Consider the case of a conventional (see [[conventional agriculture]]) apple farmer. This farmer may choose to change his farm to conform to the standards of [[USDA]] approved [[organic agriculture]] because he felt motivated by social or moral norms or the potential of increased profits or a host of other reasons. This farmer evaluated his situation and reconfigured it to try to improve it. Some might look at this situation and conclude that the apple farmer chose organic apple production because it is more sustainable for the environment. But, what if a few years later the farmer finds that he is struggling to make a profit and decides to go back to conventional agriculture?  The farmer performed another agroecosystem analysis and arrived at a reconfiguration that some might see as unsustainable. This example illustrates how agroecosystem analysis is not required to lead a more environmentally sustainable form of agriculture. Agroecosystem analysis might produce a reconfiguration that is more economically sustainable or socially sustainable or politically sustainable for a farmer (or other actor). By definition, however, agroecosystem analysis is not required to produce an environmentally sustainable configuration for an agricultural system.

== Approach to analysis ==

William L. Bland, from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], developed the idea of a farm as a [[Holon (philosophy)]] This term, ''holon'', was originally introduced by [[Arthur Koestler]] in 1966, in which he referred to a ''holon'' as an entity in which it is a part by itself, a ''holon'', while contributing to a larger entity, which is also a ''holon''.&lt;ref&gt;* Koestler, Arthur, 1967. ''The Ghost in the Machine''. London: Hutchinson. 1990 reprint edition, Penguin Group. {{ISBN|0-14-019192-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bland develops this for an agricultural environment or [[farm]] as, "The farm holon is both the whole in which smaller holons exists, and a part of larger entities, themselves holons." This idea was expanded upon by Bland and Michael M. Bell [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in their 2007 article "A holon approach to agroecology,"&lt;ref&gt;*Bland, W.L. and Bell, M.M., (2007) A holon approach to agroecology ''International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability'' 5(4), 280-294. [http://www.drs.wisc.edu/documents/articles/bell/bland-bell-2007.pdf abstract available here] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426051309/http://www.drs.wisc.edu/documents/articles/bell/bland-bell-2007.pdf |date=April 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; because it is difficult to account for boundary and change when using a [[systems thinking]] approach. One major difference between Koestler's holon and the holon idea developed for agroecosystem analysis is that the latter can only be defined as a holon if it has [[intentionality]].

The farm itself is a holon and within the [[farm]] holon, other holons exist. For example, a [[Livestock|farm animal]], the farm [[family]], and a [[farmworker]] can all be considered holons within the farm. Additionally, the farm is considered a holon which is inpart connected to other holons such as the [[county]] in which the farm resides, the [[bank]] from which the [[farmer]] borrowed money, or the [[grain elevator]] where the farmer can sell goods. Things like the [[tractor]] or the [[barn]] are not holons because they lack [[intentionality]].

When conducting an agroecosystem analysis, the analyst should approach the farm as the farm itself and the "[[ecology of contexts]]" in which the farm and the farmer function. A "context" is anything that might influence functioning of the farm and cause it to change. According to Bland and Bell, examples of contexts include, "family, farm business, genetic heart disease, and spiritual beliefs." These examples illustrate the breadth of contexts that could influence why farmers do what they do. Bland concluded his model of a [[farm]] as a ''holon'' by stating, "A farm is not [[sustainable]] (disintegrates) when it cannot find an overall configuration that is simultaneously viable in all contexts."

==Questions to consider==

There is no right or wrong way to evaluate an agroecosystem. It is important to identify all actors in a holon before beginning the analysis. When an analyst accepts the task of analyzing the agroecosystem, first and foremost, it must be approached as to incorporate all elements involved and should derive questions that should be answered. Questions such as:

*What defining factors (holons and contexts) determine the present configuration of the agroecosystem?
*How does one quantify the sustainability of the farm holon (economic, social, political, ecological and/or other)?
*How does the farmer or farm family perceive an agroecosystem?
*What is the farmer doing now, and how do those practices or actions affect the viability of the agroecosystem?
*Can the farmer maintain his livelihood continuing with current practices?
*What does the farmer value and where do those values come from?
*Will the farmer consider alternative farm configurations?

These are the types of questions an analyst could consider. There are no preset questions to ask, and usually more questions are derived than answered. However, the most important task an analysts can do, is to start the analysis with an open mind and under no presumptions about what is and is not sustainable for the farm holon.

== Analysis types ==

J. Visser of [[Dordt College]] uses a diagram, "Wealth Creation Wheel"&lt;ref&gt;*[http://cari.unl.edu/Presentations/wealthwheel.pdf Wealth Creation Wheel] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907235848/http://cari.unl.edu/Presentations/wealthwheel.pdf |date=September 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to emphasize and account for the parameters of developing a thorough analysis. His diagram is more emphasized on [[economics]]; however, it is a useful tool to reference when starting to analyze an agroecoystem. His interest is to create a functioning wheel which will ''roll'' when all parameters are met equally. If one parameter is not functioning in context with the other parameters, then the wheel will be out of balance and ineffective, thus unsustainable. When referring to an [[agroecosystem]], if one parameter is out of balance, this could lead to an unproductive cropping season and loss of income and/or livelihood.

== Behavior analytics ==
Behavior informatics covers ''behavior analytics'' which focuses on analysis and learning of behavioral data.

== Behavior ==
From an informa[[Informatics|t]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;ics perspective, a [[behavior]] consists of four key elements: actors (behavioral subjects and objects), operations (actions, activities) and interactions (relationships), and their properties. A behavior can be represented as a behavior vector, all behaviors of an actor or an actor group can be represented as behavior sequences and multi-dimensional behavior matrix.

[[File:Bibliotheca Botanica 1736.jpg|thumb|upright|225px|Title page of Linnaeus's Bibliotheca Botanica, 1736.]]
'''''Bibliotheca Botanica''''' ("Bibliography of botany", Amsterdam, 1736, Salomen Schouten; 2nd edn., 1751) is a [[botany]] book by Swedish [[naturalist]] [[Carl Linnaeus]] (1707–1778).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k97132d.image.f2 Full scan of original text of ''Bibliotheca Botanica'']&lt;/ref&gt; The book was written and published in Amsterdam when Linnaeus was twenty-eight and dedicated to the botanist [[Johannes Burman]] (1707–1779). The first edition appeared in 1735 with the full title ''Bibliotheca Botanica recensens libros plus mille de plantis huc usque editos secundum systema auctorum naturale in classes, ordines, genera et species''; it was an elaborate classification system for his catalogue of books.

The Preface, dated 8 August 1735, on pages 2–19 contains Linnaeus's extended account of botanical history in the form of a botanical analogy; in pages 2–3 Linnaeus lists previous bibliographers and then gives his account of botanical history leading to a golden age lasting from 1683 to 1703 (see also ''Incrementa Botanices'', Biuur 1753 and ''Reformatio Botanices'', Reftelius, 1762, for other historical notes by Linnaeus).&lt;ref&gt;Heller p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt; The Preface mentions that ''Bibliotheca Botanica'' was the first part of a planned ''Bibliotheca medica'' (which he did not produce).

A digest of ''Bibliotheca Botanica'', which elaborated on the first chapter of the ''[[Fundamenta Botanica]]'', is given in Aphorisms 5–52 of the ''Philosophia Botanica''.

Linnaean authority [[Frans Stafleu]] describes the book:

{{cquote|''The Bibliotheca is a concise history of botany in a dry, enumerative, but very efficient style. Linnaeus describes the development of botanical science by subdividing the authors in various categories and by adding several statements on the main events in human affairs without which the growth of botany as a science cannot be understood.

[[File:Bibliotheca Botanica 1736 System.jpg|thumb|upright|225px|Linnaeus's method for classifying the elements of ''Bibliotheca Botanica''.]]
The term “methodists” (methodici, equivalent to present-day systematists) was coined by Linnaeus in his ''Bibliotheca Botanica'' to denote the authors who care about the principles of classification in contrast to the collectors who are concerned primarily with the description of plants paying little or no attention to their arrangement into genera etc. For Linnaeus the important early Methodists were Italian physician and botanist [[Andrea Caesalpino]], the English naturalist [[John Ray]], German physician and botanist [[Augustus Quirinus Rivinus]], and a French physician, botanist, and traveller [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort]].&lt;ref&gt;Stafleu pp. 36, 39, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Botanical bibliography effectively began, as did bibliography in general, with the work of the sixteenth-century Swiss natural historian and polymath Conrad Gesner (1516–65). His ''Bibliotheca Universalis'', a general compendium of some 12,000 items in Latin, Greek, or Hebrew arranged by authors’ forenames, appeared in 1545 as an attempt to bring some order into the rapidly increasing range of literature consequent to the Renaissance and the introduction of printing.&lt;ref&gt;Frodin, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Bibliotheca Botanica'' was the first botanical bibliography arranged by subject. The titles were arranged hierarchically into 16 classes or chapters, each with one or more ordines or sections. Applying this ''methodus naturalis'' to books and people was a mark of his ‘scholastic’ view of the world. Most subsequent classifications of botanical literature, including geographical entities, would be more or less empirically based highlighting a recurrent conflict between [[essentialism]], [[empiricism]], [[nominalism]] and other doctrines in the theory and practice of any kind of classification.&lt;ref&gt;Frodin, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical assessment==
Heller notes the incomplete coverage of material, incorrect dating of books, and many minor errors in his book descriptions. Also, that his “natural method” of classifying books was “not very practical”.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, pp. 407-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5867">{{about|bounded quantification in mathematical logic|bounded quantification in type theory|Bounded quantification}}
In the study of formal theories in [[mathematical logic]], '''bounded quantifiers''' are often included in a formal language in addition to the standard quantifiers "∀" and "∃". Bounded quantifiers differ from "∀" and "∃" in that bounded quantifiers restrict the range of the quantified variable. The study of bounded quantifiers is motivated by the fact that determining whether a [[Sentence (mathematical logic)|sentence]] with only bounded quantifiers is true is often not as difficult as determining whether an arbitrary sentence is true.

Examples of bounded quantifiers in the context of real analysis include "∀''x''&gt;0", "∃''y''&lt;0", and "∀''x'' ∊ ℝ". Informally "∀''x''&gt;0" says "for all ''x'' where ''x'' is larger than 0", "∃''y''&lt;0" says "there exists a ''y'' where ''y'' is less than 0" and  "∀''x'' ∊ ℝ" says "for all ''x'' where ''x'' is a real number". For example, {{nowrap|1="∀''x''&gt;0 ∃''y''&lt;0 (''x'' = ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)"}} says "every positive number is the square of a negative number".

== Bounded quantifiers in arithmetic ==

Suppose that ''L'' is the language of [[Peano arithmetic]] (the language of [[second-order arithmetic]] or arithmetic in all finite types would work as well).  There are two types of bounded quantifiers: &lt;math&gt;\forall n &lt; t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\exists n &lt; t&lt;/math&gt;.
These quantifiers bind the number variable ''n'' and contain a numeric term ''t'' which may not mention ''n'' but which may have other free variables. ("Numeric terms" here means terms such as "1 + 1", "2", "2 × 3", "''m'' + 3", etc.)

These quantifiers are defined by the following rules (&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; denotes formulas):
:&lt;math&gt;\exists n &lt; t\, \phi \Leftrightarrow \exists n ( n &lt; t \land \phi)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall n &lt; t\, \phi \Leftrightarrow \forall n ( n &lt; t \rightarrow \phi)&lt;/math&gt;

There are several motivations for these quantifiers.
* In applications of the language to [[recursion theory]], such as the [[arithmetical hierarchy]], bounded quantifiers add no complexity.  If &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a decidable predicate then &lt;math&gt;\exists n &lt; t \, \phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\forall n &lt; t\,  \phi&lt;/math&gt; are decidable as well.
* In applications to the study of [[Peano arithmetic]], the fact that a particular set can be defined with only bounded quantifiers can have consequences for the computability of the set. For example, there is a definition of primality using only bounded quantifiers: a number ''n'' is prime if and only if there are not two numbers strictly less than ''n'' whose product is ''n''.  There is no quantifier-free definition of primality in the language &lt;math&gt;\langle 0,1,+,\times, &lt;, =\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, however. The fact that there is a bounded quantifier formula defining primality shows that the primality of each number can be computably decided.

In general, a relation on natural numbers is definable by a bounded formula if and only if it is computable in the linear-time hierarchy, which is defined similarly to the [[polynomial hierarchy]], but with linear time bounds instead of polynomial. Consequently, all predicates definable by a bounded formula are [[ELEMENTARY|Kalmár elementary]], [[context-sensitive grammar|context-sensitive]], and [[primitive recursive]].

In the [[arithmetical hierarchy]], an arithmetical formula which contains only bounded quantifiers is called &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Delta^0_0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_0&lt;/math&gt;. The superscript 0 is sometimes omitted.

== Bounded quantifiers in set theory ==
Suppose that ''L'' is the language &lt;math&gt;\langle \in, \ldots, =\rangle&lt;/math&gt; of the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], where the ellipsis may be replaced by term-forming operations such as a symbol for the powerset operation.  There are two bounded quantifiers: &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\exists x \in t&lt;/math&gt;.  These quantifiers bind the set variable ''x'' and contain a term ''t'' which may not mention ''x'' but which may have other free variables.

The semantics of these quantifiers is determined by the following rules:
:&lt;math&gt;\exists x \in t\ (\phi) \Leftrightarrow \exists x ( x \in  t \land \phi)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \in t\ (\phi) \Leftrightarrow \forall x ( x \in t \rightarrow \phi)&lt;/math&gt;

A ZF formula which contains only bounded quantifiers is called &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Delta_0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Pi_0&lt;/math&gt;. This forms the basis of the [[Lévy hierarchy]], which is defined analogously with the arithmetical hierarchy.

Bounded quantifiers are important in [[Kripke–Platek set theory]] and [[constructive set theory]], where only [[axiom schema of predicative separation|&amp;Delta;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; separation]] is included. That is, it includes separation for formulas with only bounded quantifiers, but not separation for other formulas. In KP the motivation is the fact that whether a set ''x'' satisfies a bounded quantifier formula only depends on the collection of sets that are close in rank to ''x'' (as the powerset operation can only be applied finitely many times to form a term). In constructive set theory, it is motivated on [[impredicativity|predicative]] grounds.

==History==
The Carl Albert Center was founded by the University of Oklahoma's Board of Regents and the [[Oklahoma Regents for Higher Education]] in 1979 with both state and private funds.&lt;ref name="CAC history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gamino 15"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gamino|first1=Denise|title=Albert bill faces hurdle|url=http://newsok.com/albert-bill-faces-hurdle/article/2006545|accessdate=September 25, 2014|work=[[NewsOK]]|date=December 15, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center's early federal funding proved to be controversial, as a "yearlong battle" occurred in Congress before it approved a $2-million appropriation in 1982.&lt;ref name="Gamino 21"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gamino|first1=Denise|title=Lawmakers OK Research Center Funding for OU|url=http://newsok.com/lawmakers-ok-research-center-funding-for-ou/article/2007331|accessdate=September 25, 2014|work=[[NewsOK]]|date=December 21, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the eight members in Oklahoma's congressional delegation that year, seven supported federal funding for the Carl Albert Center, with only [[Don Nickles]] opposing it.&lt;ref name="Gamino 21"/&gt; Nickles argued that the "Senate won't buy" the idea of federal funding for the Center, while [[Dave McCurdy]] (one of the seven in support) termed Nickles' opposition "unfortunate" and contended that the institution was "good for the University of Oklahoma" and "of national importance".&lt;ref name="Gamino 15"/&gt; In 1982, the Center contained 40 sets of congressional papers, 36 of which were from Oklahomans; however, a number of Oklahoma lawmakers wanted it to eventually become, in the words of journalist Denise Gamino, "the premier national repository for congressional papers".&lt;ref name="Gamino 15"/&gt; By 1989, the number of collections held at the Carl Albert Center had grown to 50, while the Center was selected as one of three host institutions for the [[National Historical Publications and Records Commission]]'s [[Andrew W.

'''Cell biology''' (also called '''cytology''', from the [[Greek language|Greek]] κύτος, ''kytos'', "vessel") is a branch of [[biology]] that studies the [[Structural biology|structure]] and [[Physiology|function]] of the [[Cell (biology)|cell]], which is the basic unit of [[life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/topic/cell-biology-13906536|title=Cell Biology {{!}} Learn Science at Scitable|website=www.nature.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cell biology is concerned with the [[physiology|physiological]] properties, [[Metabolic pathway|metabolic]] processes, [[signaling pathway]]s, [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]], [[Biochemistry|chemical composition]] and interactions of the cell with their environment. This is done both on a [[microscope|microscopic]] and [[molecule|molecular]] level as it encompasses [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic cells]] and [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic cells]]. Knowing the components of cells and how cells work is fundamental to all [[Biology|biological sciences]]; it is also essential for research in [[bio-medical]] fields such as [[cancer]], and other diseases. Research in cell biology is closely related to [[genetics]], [[biochemistry]], [[molecular biology]], [[immunology]] and [[cytochemistry ]].&lt;ref name="cell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alberts|first1=Bruce|last2=Johnson|first2=Alexander|last3=Lewis|first3=Julian|last4=Raff|first4=Martin|last5=Roberts|first5=Keith|last6=Walter|first6=Peter|title=Isolating, Cloning, and Sequencing DNA|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26837/|accessdate=31 December 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Cells, which were once invisible to the naked eye, were first seen in 17th century Europe with the invention of the [[Optical microscope#Compound microscope|compound microscope]]. [[Robert Hooke]] was the first person to term the building block of all living organisms as "cells" after looking at [[Cork (material)|cork]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Micrographia|last1=Hooke|first1=Robert|date=September 1665}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cell theory states that all living things are made up of cells.&lt;ref name="Cell and Molecular Biology"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cell and Molecular Biology|last1=Gupta|first1=P.|date=Dec 1, 2005|publisher=Rastogi Publications|isbn=978-8171338177|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory also states that both plants and animals are composed of cells which was confirmed by plant scientist, [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden|Matthias Schleiden]] and animal scientist, [[Theodor Schwann]] in 1839.&lt;ref name="Cell and Molecular Biology"/&gt; 19 years later, [[Rudolf Virchow]] contributed to the cell theory, arguing that all cells come from the division of preexisting cells.&lt;ref name="Cell and Molecular Biology"/&gt; In recent years, there have been many studies which question the cell theory. Scientists have struggled to decide whether [[virus]]es are alive or not. Viruses lack common characteristics of a living cell, such as membranes, cell [[organelle]]s, and the ability to reproduce by themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chemistry in Medicine|last1=Kendrick|first1=Karolyn|date=Jan 1, 2010|publisher=Benchmark Education Company|isbn=978-1450928526|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viruses range from 0.005 to 0.03 micrometers in size whereas [[bacteria]] range from 1-5 micrometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Practical Manual of Groundwater Microbiology|last1=Cullimore|first1=D.|date=Dec 17, 2007|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0849385315|edition=2nd|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern day cell biology research looks at different ways to culture and manipulate cells outside of a living body to further research in human anatomy and physiology, to derive treatments and other medications, etc. The techniques by which cells are studied have evolved. Advancement in microscopic techniques and technology such as [[Fluorescence microscope|fluorescence microscopy]], [[phase-contrast microscopy]], [[dark field microscopy]], [[confocal microscopy]], [[cytometry]], [[transmission electron microscopy]], etc. have allowed scientists to get a better idea of the structure of cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cell and Molecular Biology|last1=Lavanya|first1=P.|date=Dec 1, 2005|publisher=Rastogi Publications|isbn=978-8171338177|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cell structure ==
There are two fundamental classifications of cells: [[prokaryote]]s and [[eukaryote]]s. The major difference between the two is the presence and/or absence of organelles. Other factors such as size, the way in which they reproduce, and the number of cells distinguish them from one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biochemical Engineering|last1=Doble|first1=Mukesh|last2=Gummadi|first2=Sathyanarayana N.|date=August 5, 2010|publisher=Prentice-Hall of India Pvt.Ltd|isbn=978-8120330528|location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eukaryotic cells include animal, plant, fungi, and protozoa cells which all have a nucleus enclosed by a membrane, with various shapes and sizes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Prokaryotic cells, lacking an enclosed nucleus, include bacteria and [[archaea]]. Prokaryotic cells are much smaller than eukaryotic cells, making prokaryotic cells the smallest form of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cell Physiology Sourcebook: A Molecular Approach|last1=Kaneshiro|first1=Edna|date=May 2, 2001|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0123877383|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cytologists typically focus on eukaryotic cells whereas prokaryotic cells are the focus of [[microbiologist]]s, but this is not always the case.

==Internal cellular structures==
[[File:Illu cell structure.jpg|thumb|380px|The generalized structure and [[molecule|molecular]] components of a cell]]

===Chemical and molecular environment===
The study of the cell is done on a molecular level; however, most of the processes within the cell are made up of a mixture of small organic molecules, inorganic ions, hormones, and water. Approximately 75-85% of the cell's volume is due to water making it an indispensable solvent as a result of its polarity and structure.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Molecular Cell Biology|last = Lodish|first = Harvey|publisher = W. H. Freeman and Company|year = 2013|isbn = 978-1-4292-3413-9|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These molecules within the cell, which operate as substrates, provide a suitable environment  for the cell to carry out metabolic reactions and signalling. The cell shape varies among the different types of organisms, and are thus then classified into two categories: [[eukaryotes]] and [[prokaryotes]]. In the case of eukaryotic cells - which are made up of animal, plant, fungi, and protozoa cells - the shapes are generally round and spherical or oval&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|title = The Morphology of Eukaryotic Cells: Shape, Number and Size|url = http://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/zoology/cell/the-morphology-of-eukaryotic-cells-shape-number-and-size/30442/|website = YourArticleLibrary.com: The Next Generation Library|accessdate = 2015-11-22|language = en-US|date = 2014-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; while for prokaryotic cells – which are composed of bacteria and archaea - the shapes are: spherical ([[Coccus|cocci]]), rods ([[bacillus]]), curved ([[vibrio]]), and spirals (''[[Spirochaete|spirochetes]])''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Size, Shape, And Arrangement of Bacterial Cells|url = http://classes.midlandstech.edu/carterp/courses/bio225/chap04/lecture2.htm|website = classes.midlandstech.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-22|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160809135552/http://classes.midlandstech.edu/carterp/courses/bio225/chap04/lecture2.htm|archivedate = 9 August 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cell biology focuses more on the study of eukaryotic cells, and their signalling pathways, rather than on prokaryotes which is covered under [[microbiology]]. The main constituents of the general molecular composition of the cell includes: proteins and lipids which are either free flowing or [[membrane]] bound, along with different internal [[cellular compartment|compartments]] known as [[organelle]]s. This environment of the cell is made up of [[Hydrophile|hydrophilic]] and [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] regions which allows for the exchange of the above-mentioned molecules and ions. The hydrophilic regions of the cell are mainly on the inside and outside of the cell, while the hydrophobic regions are within the [[Lipid bilayer|phospholipid bilayer]] of the cell membrane. The cell membrane consists of lipids and proteins which accounts for its hydrophobicity as a result of being non-polar substances.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Therefore, in order for these molecules to participate in reactions, within the cell, they need to be able to cross this membrane layer to get into the cell. They accomplish this process of gaining access to the cell via: [[osmotic pressure]], [[diffusion]], concentration gradients, and membrane channels. Inside of the cell are extensive internal sub-cellular membrane-bounded compartments called organelles.

===Organelles ===
Cells contains specialized sub-cellular compartments including [[cell membrane]], [[cytoplasm]],mitochondria, and [[ribosome]]s. See [[organelle]].

==Processes==
===Growth and development ===
The growth process of the cell does not refer to the size of the cell, but instead the density of the number of cells present in the organism at a given time. [[Cell growth]] pertains to the increase in the number of cells present in an organism as it grows and develops; as the organism gets larger so too does the number of cells present. Cells are the foundation of all organisms, they are the fundamental unit of life. The growth and development of the cell are essential for the maintenance of the host, and survival of the organisms. For this process the cell goes through the steps of the [[cell cycle]] and development which involves cell growth, [[DNA replication]], [[cell division]], regeneration, specialization, and [[cell death]]. The cell cycle is divided into four distinct phases, G1, S, G2, and M. The G phases – which is the cell growth phase - makes up approximately 95% of the cycle.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Becker's World of the Cell|last = Hardin|first = Jeff|publisher = |year = 2012|isbn = 978-0-321-71602-6|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proliferation of cells is instigated by progenitors, the cells then differentiate to become specialized, where specialized cells of the same type aggregate to form tissues, then organs and ultimately systems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The G phases along with the S phase – DNA replication, damage and repair - are considered to be the interphase portion of the cycle. While the M phase ([[mitosis]] and [[cytokinesis]]) is the cell division portion of the cycle.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The cell cycle is regulated by a series of signalling factors and complexes such as [[cyclin-dependent kinase]]s and [[p53]], to name a few. When the cell has completed its growth process, and if it is found to be damaged or altered it undergoes cell death, either by [[apoptosis]] or [[necrosis]], to eliminate the threat it cause to the organism's survival.

===Other cellular processes===
*[[Active transport]] and [[Passive transport]] - Movement of [[molecules]] into and out of cells.
*[[Autophagy]] - The process whereby cells "eat" their own internal components or [[Microorganism|microbial]] invaders.
*[[Cell adhesion|Adhesion]] - Holding together cells and [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]].
*Cell movement - [[Chemotaxis]], [[Muscle contraction|contraction]], [[cilia]] and [[Flagellum|flagella]].
*[[Cell signaling]] - Regulation of cell behavior by signals from outside.
*[[Cell division|Division]] - By which cells reproduce either by [[mitosis]] (to produce clones of the parent cell) or [[Meiosis]] (to produce [[haploid]] [[gametes]])
*[[DNA repair]] - [[Cell death]] and cell [[senescence]].
*[[Metabolism]] - [[Glycolysis]], [[Cellular respiration|respiration]], [[photosynthesis]], and [[chemosynthesis]].
*[[Cell signaling|Signalling]] - The process by which the activities in the cell are regulated.
*[[Transcription (genetics)|Transcription]] and [[Splicing (genetics)|mRNA splicing]] - [[Gene]] expression.

'''The Center for the Development of Recycling''' (CDR), also known as the County of Santa Clara Recycling Hotline, is a university-based, non-profit, environmental research and service organization. The CDR is located in the Department of [[Environmental Studies]] office at [[San Jose State University]] (SJSU).&lt;ref name="sjsu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sjsu.edu/depts/EnvStudies/beyond-class/index.htm |title=San Jose State University Environmental Studies Department |publisher=Sjsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faculty-managed students work on recycling-related projects for the community.&lt;ref name="sjsufoundation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sjsufoundation.org/html/sjsuf-news-info/case-studies.htm |title=SJSU Research Foundation - Case Studies |publisher=Sjsufoundation.org |date=2011-12-18 |accessdate=2012-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508055347/http://www.sjsufoundation.org/html/sjsuf-news-info/case-studies.htm |archivedate=2012-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This organization not only provides the community with a recycling service, but also provides a service-learning opportunity to students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://svtc.org/about-us/staff/ |title=Staff and Board – Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition |publisher=Svtc.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
CDR operates with a part-time Director, two compensated part-time students who serve as Administrative Manager and Project Manager, and a staff of student interns who earn academic credit for community service learning. The CDR Director is a Department of Environmental Studies faculty member who is responsible for all activities including management of staff, projects, equipment, budget, and adherence to University regulations. The San Jose State University Foundation manages accounting and payroll services.&lt;ref name="recyclestuff"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.recyclestuff.org/about.php |title=Center for the Development of Recycling |publisher=Recyclestuff.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831200037/http://www.recyclestuff.org/about.php |archivedate=2012-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Website==
The CDR’s website assists users to find locations for recycling, reuse, and the donation of goods. It contains specific services available from over 1200 companies and local government for over 2000 product and material types.  Links and documents are provided to assist users with access to multiple information sources that address nearly any question about recycling and waste management.  The site features specific information about recycling and reuse services provided by private business, local government, landfills, and extensive information resources in this expanding field.

==History==
The CDR was founded in 1989 by Bruce Olszewski.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sjsu.edu/depts/EnvStudies/about/faculty/olszewski.htm |title=Bruce Olszewski Bio |publisher=Sjsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, CDR bridged personnel and equipment resources of SJSU with [[Santa Clara County]] and its 15 cities that resulted in an alliance to provide cost-effective recycling information services for County residents and businesses that also created student service-learning opportunities. In 1992, the CDR began operating the County of Santa Clara Recycling Hotline. CDR added a donor funded website in 1999.&lt;ref name="recyclestuff" /&gt; In 2017, CDR expanded its organization to include the County of San Mateo.

==Recycling Hotline==
Since 1992,&lt;ref name="recyclestuff" /&gt; the CDR has operated the County of Santa Clara Recycling Hotline under contract with the County of Santa Clara.&lt;ref name="sjsu" /&gt; The hotline was created to assist residents with finding a reuse or recycling center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sanjoseca.gov/esd/pollution-prevention/e-waste.asp |title=Pollution Prevention for Residents: E-waste |publisher=Sanjoseca.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609104312/http://www.sanjoseca.gov/ESD/pollution-prevention/e-waste.asp |archivedate=2012-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for any recyclable item they may have.&lt;ref name="sccgov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sccgov.org/portal/site/iwm/agencychp?path=%2Fv7%2FIntegrated%20Waste%20Management%20%28DIV%29%2FRecycling%20Hotline |title=The County of Santa Clara - Office of Integrated Waste Management |publisher=Sccgov.org |date=2012-08-03 |accessdate=2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The student-operated hotline serves the 16 jurisdictions of Santa Clara County&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creec.edgateway.net/cs/creecp/view/creec_org/590 |title=CREEC - Center for Development of Recycling, San Jose State University |publisher=Creec.edgateway.net |date=2003-05-14 |accessdate=2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; which include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33867">[[File:Bronze_age_weapons_Romania.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt; Weapons of the age of Bronze, [[Romania]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
The different types of '''[[bladed weapons]]''' ([[Sword|swords]], [[Small sword|dress-swords]], [[Sabre|sabers]], [[Rapier|rapiers]], [[Foil (fencing)|foils]], [[Machete|machetes]], [[Dagger|daggers]], [[Knife|knives]], [[Arrowhead|arrowheads]], etc..) have been of great importance throughout history. In addition to its use for fighting, or in wars, the ''[[bladed weapons]]'' have been the object of special considerations forming part of funerary rituals, mythology and other ancestral traditions.

The manufacture of a [[Bladed weapons|''bladed weapon'']] of a certain quality (either of bronze or iron alloy) requires a certain degree of mastery in metallurgy: obtaining metals and alloys from the minerals of the mines, mastery on forging, casting or forming techniques and heat treatments; without forgetting the artistic aspects or the crafts related to the complements (pods, belts, shawls, knobs, decoration, etc...).

== Chronology details ==
The present [[chronology]] it's a compilation that includes diverse and relatively uneven documents about different families of ''[[bladed weapons]]'': [[Sword|swords]], [[Small sword|dress-swords]], [[Sabre|sabers]], [[Rapier|rapiers]], [[Foil (fencing)|foils]], [[Machete|machetes]], [[Dagger|daggers]], [[Knife|knives]], [[Arrowhead|arrowheads]], etc..., with the sword references being the most numerous but not the unique included among the other listed references of the rest of ''[[bladed weapons]]''. The reason to group them into a single list responds to a goal for simplification, instead of making a different [[chronology]] article for each type of bladed weapon.

== Chronology (until the Christian Era) ==

=== Bronze Swords ===
[[File:Nebra_Schwerter.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt; [[Sword]]s found next to [[Nebra sky disk]] &lt;/Center&gt;]]
The first bronze swords with a length equal to or greater than 60&amp;nbsp;cm date from the 17th century BC in regions of the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Aegean Sea]]. They emerged as an evolution of shorter weapons of the type of the daggers or daggers. To make a sword useful in combat, you must have a correct alloy, give it the right shape and apply the necessary thermal (and finishing) treatments. The longer a sword, the stresses (bending and buckling) are more important. What is needed is a weapon that is hard enough (to cut), fairly flexible (without being fragile) and quite tenacious enough to withstand the blows in the fights.

The manufacturing process is summarized as follows: The bronze swords were cast into moulds, heated to a certain temperature and allowed to cool slowly. Finally they cold hammered (hitting them with a hammer on a type of anvil) to increase its hardness.

* 197 BC. The Greeks were defeated by the Romans, led by [[Gaius Cornelius Cethegus|Gaius Cornelius Cetegus]] near the River Clusius (perhaps the current Brembo River). In spite of the numerical superiority of the Gauls, their swords were bent at the first blow and had to be straightened.

&lt;/ref&gt; asserts that computational problems can be feasibly computed on some computational device only if they can be computed in [[polynomial time]]; that is, if they lie in the [[complexity class]] '''[[P (complexity)|P]]''' ('''PTIME''').&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author = Steven Homer and Alan L. Selman | year = 1992 | chapter = Complexity Theory | title = Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Technology | volume = 26 | editor = Alan Kent and James G. Williams | publisher = CRC Press | chapterurl = http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/tech-reports/91-04.ps|postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern terms, it identifies [[tractable problem]]s with the complexity class '''P'''.

Formally, to say that a problem can be solved in polynomial time is to say that there exists an algorithm that, given an ''n''-bit instance of the problem as input, can produce a solution in time [[Big-O notation|O]](n&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;), where ''c'' is a constant that depends on the problem but not the particular instance of the problem.

Alan Cobham's 1965 paper entitled "The intrinsic computational difficulty of functions"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Alan Cobham | year = 1965 | title = The intrinsic computational difficulty of functions | url = https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sacook/homepage/cobham_intrinsic.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the earliest mentions of the concept of the [[complexity class]] '''[[P (complexity)|P]]''', consisting of problems decidable in polynomial time.  Cobham theorized that this complexity class was a good way to describe the set of feasibly [[Computability theory (computer science)|computable]] problems.

Jack Edmonds's 1965 paper "Paths, trees, and flowers"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  | doi = 10.4153/CJM-1965-045-4
  | author = Edmonds, Jack

  | volume = 17
  | year = 1965
  | pages = 449–467
}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also credited with identifying '''P''' with tractable problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Algorithms and Complexity |first=Gerard |last=Meurant |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-08093391-7 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6WriBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=Edmonds p. 4] |quote=A problem is said to be ''feasible'' if it can be solved in polynomial time (as stated for the first time in Edmonds [26] [1965, Paths, trees, and flowers])).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
[[File:KnapsackEmpComplexity.GIF|thumb|310 px|The graph shows time of solution of problem in milliseconds (msec) vs. problem size, n, for [[knapsack problem]]s solved by a state-of-the-art specialized algorithm using a 933 MHz Pentium III computer (average of 100 instances, data from:&lt;ref name=Pisinger2003&gt;D. Pisinger, 2003. "Where are the hard knapsack problems?" Technical Report 2003/08, Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark, see [http://www.diku.dk/forskning/Publikationer/tekniske_rapporter/2003/03-08.pdf], accessed 31 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;). The fit of the quadratic equation suggests that empirical algorithmic complexity for instances with 50–10,000 variables is O((log&amp;nbsp;''n'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) despite having exponential worst-case complexity estimate in theory.]]
While Cobham's thesis is an important milestone in the development of the theory of [[computational complexity theory|computational complexity]], it has limitations as applied to practical feasibility of algorithms. The thesis essentially states that "'''P'''" means "easy, fast, and practical," while "not in '''P'''" means "hard, slow, and impractical." But this is not always true, because the thesis abstracts away some important variables that influence the runtime in practice:

* It ignores constant factors and lower-order terms.
* It ignores the size of the exponent. The [[time hierarchy theorem]] proves the existence of problems in '''P''' requiring arbitrarily large exponents.
* It ignores the typical size of the input.

All three are related, and are general complaints about [[analysis of algorithms]], but they particularly apply to Cobham's thesis since it makes an explicit claim about practicality.  Under Cobham's thesis, a problem for which the best algorithm takes ''n''&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt; instructions is considered feasible, and a problem with an algorithm that takes 2&lt;sup&gt;0.00001 ''n''&lt;/sup&gt; instructions infeasible&amp;mdash;even though one could never solve an instance of size ''n'' = 2 with the former algorithm, whereas an instance of the latter problem of size ''n'' = 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; could be solved without difficulty.  In fields where practical problems have millions of variables (such as [[Operations Research]] or [[Electronic Design Automation]]), even O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) algorithms are often impractical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Darkforest is named after [[Liu Cixin]]'s science fiction novel ''[[The Dark Forest]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xw.qq.com/tech/20160301024236/TEC201603010242360D|title=FB围棋项目负责人谈人机大战|date=2016-03-01|publisher=Tencent|language=Chinese|trans-title=FB Go Project Manager Discusses Man vs Machine Showdown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Competing with top human players in the ancient game of Go has been a long-term goal of artificial intelligence. Go’s high [[branching factor]] makes traditional search techniques ineffective, even on cutting-edge hardware, and Go’s [[evaluation function]] could change drastically with one stone change. However, by using a Deep [[Convolutional neural network|Convolutional Neural Network]] designed for long-term predictions, '''Darkforest''' has been able to substantially improve the win rate for bots over more traditional [[Monte Carlo tree search|Monte Carlo Tree Search]] based approaches.

=== Matches ===
Against human players, '''Darkfores2''' achieves a stable ''[[Go ranks and ratings|3d ranking]]'' on [[KGS Go Server]], which roughly corresponds to an advanced amateur human player. However, after adding [[Monte Carlo tree search|Monte Carlo Tree Search]] to '''Darkfores2''' to create a much stronger player named '''darkfmcts3,''' it can achieve a ''5d ranking'' on the KGS Go Server.

==== Against other AI ====
'''darkfmcts3''' is on par with state-of-the-art Go AIs such as Zen, DolBaram and [[Crazy Stone (software)|Crazy Stone]] but lags behind AlphaGo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search|url = https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v529/n7587/full/nature16961.html|journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]| issn= 0028-0836|pages = 484–489|volume = 529|issue = 7587|doi = 10.1038/nature16961|pmid = 26819042|first1 = David|last1 = Silver|author-link1=David Silver (programmer)|first2 = Aja|last2 = Huang|author-link2=Aja Huang|first3 = Chris J.|last3 = Maddison|first4 = Arthur|last4 = Guez|first5 = Laurent|last5 = Sifre|first6 = George van den|last6 = Driessche|first7 = Julian|last7 = Schrittwieser|first8 = Ioannis|last8 = Antonoglou|first9 = Veda|last9 = Panneershelvam|first10= Marc|last10= Lanctot|first11= Sander|last11= Dieleman|first12=Dominik|last12= Grewe|first13= John|last13= Nham|first14= Nal|last14= Kalchbrenner|first15= Ilya|last15= Sutskever|author-link15=Ilya Sutskever|first16= Timothy|last16= Lillicrap|first17= Madeleine|last17= Leach|first18= Koray|last18= Kavukcuoglu|first19= Thore|last19= Graepel|first20= Demis |last20=Hassabis|author-link20=Demis Hassabis|date= 28 January 2016|bibcode = 2016Natur.529..484S|accessdate=10 December 2017}}{{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; It won 3rd place in [https://www.gokgs.com/tournEntrants.jsp?sort=s&amp;id=1005 January 2016 KGS Bot Tournament] against other Go AIs.

=== News Coverage ===
After [[Google]]'s [[AlphaGo]] won against [[Fan Hui]] in 2015, [[Facebook]] made its AI's hardware designs public, alongside releasing the code behind DarkForest as open-source, along with heavy recruiting to strengthen its team of AI engineers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Style of play ==
'''Darkforest''' uses a neural network to sort through the 10&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt; board positions, and find the most powerful next move.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/544181/how-facebooks-ai-researchers-built-a-game-changing-go-engine/|title=How Facebook’s AI Researchers Built a Game-Changing Go Engine|website=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, neural networks alone cannot match the level of good amateur players or the best search-based Go engines, and so '''Darkfores2''' combines the neural network approach with a search-based machine. A database of 250,000 real Go games were used in the development of '''Darkforest''', with 220,000 used as a training set and the rest used to test the neural network's ability to predict the next moves played in the real games.  This allows Darkforest to accurately evaluate the global state of the board, but local tactics were still poor. Search-based engines have poor global evaluation, but are good at local tactics. Combining these two approaches is difficult because search-based engines work much faster than neural networks, a problem which was solved in '''Darkfores2''' by running the processes in parallel with frequent communication between the two.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Conventional strategies ===
Go is generally played by analyzing the position of the stones on the board. Some advanced players have described it as playing in some part subconsciously. Unlike chess and checkers, where AI players can simply look farther forward at moves than human players, but with each round of Go having on average 250 possible moves, that approach is ineffective. Instead, neural networks copy human play by training the AI systems on images of successful moves, the AI can effectively learn how to interpret how the board looks, as many grandmasters do.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/12/google-and-facebook-race-to-solve-the-ancient-game-of-go/|title=Google and Facebook Race to Solve the Ancient Game of Go With AI|website=WIRED|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, Facebook demonstrated the combination of MCTS with neural networks, which played with a style that "felt human".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Flaws ===
It has been noted that Darkforest still has flaws in its play style. Sometimes the bot plays [[tenuki]] ("move elsewhere") pointlessly when local powerful moves are required. When the bot is losing, it shows the typical behavior of MCTS, it plays bad moves and loses more. The Facebook AI team has acknowledged these as areas of future improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35419141|title=Facebook trains AI to beat humans at Go board game - BBC News|website=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program architecture ==
The family of '''Darkforest''' computer go programs is based on [[Convolutional neural network|convolution neural networks]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The most recent advances in '''Darkfmcts3''' combined convolutional neural networks with more traditional [[Monte Carlo tree search]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Darkfmcts3 is the most advanced version of Darkforest, which combines Facebook's most advanced convolutional neural network architecture from Darkfores2 with a [[Monte Carlo tree search]].

'''Darkfmcts3''' relies on a [[Convolutional neural network|convolution neural networks]] that predicts the next k moves based on the current state of play. It treats the board as a 19x19 image with multiple channels. Each channel represents a different aspect of board information based upon the specific style of play. For standard and extended play, there are 21 and 25 different channels, respectively. In standard play, each players [[List of Go terms#Liberty|liberties]] are represented as six binary channels or planes. The respective plane is true if the player one, two, or three or more liberties available. [[List of Go terms#Ko|Ko]] (i.e. illegal moves) is represented as one binary plane. Stone placement for each opponent and empty board positions are represented as three binary planes, and the duration since a stone has been placed is represented as real numbers on two planes, one for each player. Lastly, the opponents rank is represented by nine binary planes, where if all are true, the player is a 9d level, if 8 are true, a 8d level, and so forth. Extended play additionally considers the boarder (binary plane that is true at the border), position mask (represented as distance from the board center, i.e. &lt;math&gt; x^{(-0.5 * distance^2)}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a real number at a position), and each player's territory (binary, based on which player a location is closer to).

Darkfmct3 uses a 12-layer full convolutional network with a width of 384 nodes without weight sharing or pooling. Each convolutional layer is followed by a [[Rectifier (neural networks)|rectified linear unit]], a popular activation function for deep neural networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Bengio|first2=Yoshua|last3=Hinton|first3=Geoffrey|date=27 May 2015|title=Deep learning|journal=Nature|volume=521|issue=7553|pages=436–444|doi=10.1038/nature14539|last1=LeCun|first1=Yann|pmid=26017442|bibcode=2015Natur.521..436L}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key innovation of Darkfmct3 compared to previous approaches is that it uses only one [[softmax function]] to predict the next move, which enables the approach to reduce the overall number of parameters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Darkfmct3 was trained against 300 random selected games from an empirical dataset representing different game stages. The learning rate was determined by vanilla [[stochastic gradient descent]].

Darkfmct3 [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronously]] couples a convolutional neural network with a [[Monte Carlo tree search]]. Because the convolutional neural network is computationally taxing, the Monte Carlo tree search focuses computation on the more likely game play trajectories. By running the neural network synchronously with the Monte Carlo tree search, it is possible to guarantee that each node is expanded by the moves predicted by the neural network.

== Comparison with other systems ==
'''Darkfores2''' beats '''Darkforest''', its neural network-only predecessor, around 90% of the time, and Pachi, one of the best search-based engines, around 95% of the time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On the [[Go ranks and ratings|Kyu rating system]], Darkforest holds a 1-2d level. '''Darkfores2''' achieves a stable 3d level on KGS Go Server as a ranked bot.&lt;ref name="facebook-paper2" /&gt; With the added [[Monte Carlo tree search]], '''Darkfmcts3''' with 5,000 rollouts beats Pachi with 10k rollouts in all 250 games; with 75k rollouts it achieves a stable 5d level in KGS server, on par with state-of-the-art Go AIs (e.g., Zen, DolBaram, CrazyStone); with 110k rollouts, it won the 3rd place in January KGS Go Tournament.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''[[Defeminization]] and [[masculinization]]''' are the processes that a fetus goes through to become a male. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

It has often been said by biologists that in [[sexual differentiation]] in [[mammals]], the female is the "default" developmental pathway, in the sense that elimination of any of several gene actions necessary for formation of male genitalia leads to the development of external female genitalia (though development of functional ovaries requires effective action of several less understood sex-specific genes). {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} Two processes: [[defeminization]], and [[masculinization]], are involved in producing [[male]] typical morphology and behavior.  Disruption of either of these processes in males produces female-typical development. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} The opposite is not true; disruption of normal sexual development in females does not lead to male-typical endpoints. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

[[Defeminization]] involves the suppression of the development of female typical morphology (development of the [[Müllerian ducts]] into the fallopian tubes, uterus and [[vagina]]) and behavioural predispositions.  [[Masculinization]] involves the production of male typical morphology (development of the [[Wolffian ducts]] into male reproductive structures) and behavioural predispositions.  Both defeminization and masculinization are required for a mammalian zygote to become a fully reproductively functional male.

A brief version of the female default paradigm can be stated as follows:

#A set of specific genetic instructions must be present and a series of differentiating events mediated by hormones must occur in order for a mammalian zygote to become a fully reproductively functional male.
##The [[Y chromosome]], [[SRY]], [[SOX9]], and SF1 genes must be present and functional.
##Functional [[Leydig cell]]s must form in the [[gonad]]s.
##The Leydig cells must be able to produce [[testosterone]].
##The target cells must have the [[hormone receptor]]s to respond to the testosterone. The target cells of the [[external genitalia]] must have functional [[5-alpha-reductase]] enzyme to convert some of the testosterone to more active [[dihydrotestosterone]].
##There is some evidence that the brain must be exposed and respond to [[androgen]]s either prenatally or early in life to produce characteristic mating behavior. This is well demonstrated in many animal species but remains mostly speculative with respect to humans.
#To a large extent, each step builds on the previous. If anything goes wrong at any of the first four steps, the subsequent pathway of development results in female anatomy and behavior.
#No [[ovary|ovarian]] organizing gene [[homology (biology)|homologous]] to SRY has been discovered. Both sexes are exposed to maternal estrogen prenatally. No hormones have yet been discovered that are necessary early in life to produce female sexual development. [[Estrogen]] seems not to be necessary until puberty for purposes of differentiation.
##The full development of male characteristics also includes personal experience throughout life, determining [[gender identity]], [[gender roles]] and [[sexual orientation]]. However, there is much debate on the balance between [[nature and nurture]] in the determination.

==History==
This paradigm dates back to the 1950s. Even stronger versions were commonly stated in the 1960s and 1970s. One version, perhaps most associated with [[John Money]], (who termed it the ''Adam principle''), held that additional steps in the cascade to male identity were the recognition by parents and doctor that the external genitalia were male, which resulted in a male [[sex assignment]], which in turn resulted in a male [[sex of rearing]] by parents and society, which in turn (coupled with the reinforcing appearance of male genitalia) resulted in a male gender identity. At least by implication, female gender identity simply required a female sex of rearing and lack of an obvious penis.

In Germany in the 1970s, [[Günter Dörner]] extrapolated the cascade to include direct testosterone effect on the brain as necessary for a male gender identity and [[sexual orientation]], proposing that [[transsexualism]] and or [[homosexuality]] in biological males could result from deficiency of prenatal or early postnatal testosterone effect on the brain.

The '''Environmental Research Institute of Michigan''' (ERIM) was a [[research institute]] at [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], founded in 1972. The institute contributed to the development of [[remote sensing]], [[radar]], and [[holography]]. 

ERIM grew out of a military and environmental research arm of the [[University of Michigan]]. A for-profit enterprise, ERIM International, split off from it in 1997. This was successively acquired by Veridian Corporation, by [[General Dynamics]] - moving to [[Ypsilanti, Michigan|Ypsilanti]] - and in 2014 by [[MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates]] (MDA). Meanwhile, the remaining non-profit portion became the [[Altarum Institute]] in 2001. Part of Altarum was in 2006 merged into the [[Michigan Tech Research Institute]] (MTRI), conducting environmental and remote sensing research, while health systems research continues at Altarum Institute.

==History==

The Environmental Research Institute of Michigan (ERIM) began as Willow Run Laboratories in 1946, but was established as a private [[not for profit]] research institute when it formally separated from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070528235741/http://www.engin.umich.edu/alumni/engineer/00FW/connections.html ''University of Michigan Engineering School:  Former CoE Lab Endows New Professorship'']&lt;/ref&gt;  ERIM contributed to the development of [[remote sensing]] for [[Natural environment|environmental]] and [[military]] applications.  Much of the laboratory's early history is not publicized because ERIM and its predecessor organizations were developing remote sensing and [[surveillance]] systems to collect [[military intelligence]] from [[aircraft]] and [[satellite]]s.&lt;ref name="findarticles1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311024001/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3165/is_2000_Sept/ai_68325979 ''What's ERIM? Secretive Past, Automotive Future'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Willow Run Laboratories==

Prior to Willow Run Laboratories's establishment in 1946, with the [[Cold War]] just beginning, the War Department was concerned about keeping the U.S. in the forefront of applied science. University researchers newly returned from WWII service were anxious to use their expertise to address those concerns.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5Qe80pZ6H?url=http://mtri.org/QuickPlace/mtri/Main.nsf/h_Toc/DE1AD8280F7DF2E1852571FC0074F9D7/?OpenDocument ''History of the Michigan Tech Research Institute.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

At the University of Michigan’s College of Engineering, Professors [[William Gould Dow]] and [[Emerson W. Conlon]] approached [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] scientists with their proposal to conduct a large-scale research project. The project was designed to prove the feasibility of what would later be referred to as an [[antiballistic missile system]]. The proposal was accepted, called WIZARD, and it was this contract that gave birth to ERIM’s first predecessor organization, the [[Michigan Aeronautical Research Center|Michigan Aeronautical Research Laboratory]] (MARC).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

During the [[Vietnam War]], protesters at the University of Michigan forced the University to sever formal ties with Willow Run Laboratories.  Research from ERIM provided technology for military surveillance, as well as information and models for better prediction and understanding of floods, fires, agricultural crops and remotely sensed information, including studies of the [[Bering Glacier]].

==Key technologies==

ERIM became well known in the [[scientific]] community through a series of international conferences on remote sensing and [[geospatial]] [[information technologies]], in the spirit of the first International Symposium on Remote Sensing of the Environment held in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] in 1962.

ERIM played key-roles in the development and implementation of [[synthetic aperture radar]] (SAR), at the time, an entirely new concept of radar technology. Development of an optical processing system for SAR data led [[Emmett Leith]], Adam Kozma and [[Juris_Upatnieks|Juris Upatnieks]] to use the newly invented laser in conjunction with the holographic theories outlined by Dennis Gabor. Leith and Upatnieks developed a practical technique for wave-front recording and reconstruction using lasers, thereby making possible the field now known as [[holography]]. Holograms have since found a wide variety of applications.

==Corporate history==

In 1997, claiming an inability to compete with for-profit industry, President Peter Banks and ERIM's board of trustees spun off a for-profit [[subsidiary]] under the name ERIM International, Incorporated.  Nearly all of ERIM's R&amp;D work and contracts moved to the for-profit entity, while the buildings, property, and a small fraction of personnel and contracts were retained by the not-for-profit ERIM.  Banks and many board members allotted themselves high numbers of shares in the new for-profit venture, which were exercised for considerable sums when ERIM International, Inc. was sold to Veridian Corp. of [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1999.  Veridian was later bought by [[General Dynamics| General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems]] in 2003, and the heritage-ERIM part of the organization became its [[Michigan Research and Development Center]] (MRDC) and moved from Ann Arbor to nearby [[Ypsilanti, Michigan|Ypsilanti]].  Proceeds from the sale of ERIM International were used by the not-for-profit ERIM to acquire Center for Electronic Commerce (CEC), another Ann Arbor not for profit in 1998.&lt;ref name="findarticles1"/&gt;  ERIM acquired Vector Research, Inc. (VRI) in 2001 to form the [[Altarum Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070321213915/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0NEW/is_2001_May_21/ai_74869484/print ''Vector Research Acquired by ERIM'']&lt;/ref&gt; headquartered in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

On October 1, 2006, [[Michigan Technological University]] purchased the Altarum Institute's Environmental and Emerging Technologies Division (EETD), which was mostly comprised by the heritage-ERIM portion of the Institute, to form the [[Michigan Tech Research Institute]] (MTRI).  The Altarum Institute is a nonprofit now solely focused on health systems research,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; while the environmental and remote sensing research continues at MTRI.

On October 3, 2014, [[MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates]] (MDA), Canadian corporation, completed the acquisition of the Ypsilanti, Michigan building and employees therein from General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdaus.com/news/Default.aspx?id=143 ''MDA completes strategic capability acquisition in the United States'']&lt;/ref&gt; With MDA's corporate restructuring following the acquisition of [[Digital Globe]] in 2017, this line of business was shifted into the newly-formed subsidiary [[Radiant Solutions]] .

{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}
The '''extracellular field potential''' is the [[electrical potential]] produced by [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s, e.g. [[Neuron|nerve]] or [[Muscle fiber|muscle cell]]s, outside of the cell.  [[Electrophysiology|Electrophysiological studies]] investigate these potentials using extracellular [[microelectrode]]s. In these experiments the extracellular field potential will be detected as an electrical potential whose source and composition is often ambiguous, making its interpretation difficult. Individual nerve cells [[neuron]]s may produce [[Voltage spike|spike]]s seen as peaks of some tens to hundreds of microvolts. Contributions from neighboring neurons may overlap, producing extracellular potentials of up to several millivolts. Spatially integrating over even larger populations of cells, i.e. lumps of [[nervous tissue|nervous]] or [[muscle|muscular tissue]], will produce signals commonly called [[local field potential]]s (LFP) that can be recorded either in the tissue or with suitable equipment at the body surface as, e.g., [[electroencephalogram]] (EEG), [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG), or [[electromyogram]] (EMG).

For individual cells, the time course of the extracellular potential theoretically is inversely proportional to the transmembrane current. In practice, however, this is complicated considerably by the very complex [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] of neurons and the overlap of contributions from adjacent cells.

Using the [[Internet]], G-HOU participants around the world request observations from an automated [[telescope]], download images from a large image [[archive]], and analyze them with the aid of user-friendly image processing software, as described by Dr. Miller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title = Image Processing for Educators in Global Hands-On Universe |last1 = Miller |first1 = J.

==About==
'''Global Hands-On Universe''' is a worldwide project, with extensions over all the continents, the root project being GHOU. The project is based on observations, possibly acquired by the pupils themselves in classrooms thanks to a worldwide network of automatic telescopes operated via Internet or didactic tools ([[webcam]] system, radio telescope) developed within this project. These observations can be manipulated in classrooms with a specific software designed to be pupil-friendly. They are integrated into pedagogical resources constructed in a close collaborative work between researchers and teachers. The resources developed in the course of this project are posted on the Web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arXiv |eprint=astro-ph/0109372 |title=Hands-On Universe: A Global Program for Education and Public Outreach in Astronomy |author1= Boer |author2= Pack |author3= Pennypacker |author4= Melchior |author5= Faye |author6= Ebisuzaki |date= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) launched in 2009 the Galileo Teacher Training Program (GTTP), a Cornerstone project of the [[International Year of Astronomy]] 2009. GHOU is a major component of GTTP.

GHOU, among which EU-HOU is the leading consortium, is now officially included in the Astronomy for the Developing World Strategic Plan 2010-20 of IAU, under Section 3.4.2 Astronomy for Children and Schools. During the next decade the IAU will concentrate more resources on education activities for children and schools designed to advance sustainable global development.

In [[Europe]], the EU-HOU project is led by Dr. Ferlet &amp; Dr A.-L. Melchior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |bibcode= 2006IAUSS...2E...3F |title=Hands-on Universe - Europe|journal=IAU Special Session|volume=2|pages=3|author1=Ferlet|first1=R.|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; EU-HOU has been funded through the [[European Community]] (EC) program MINERVA (SOCRATES) for a two-year period (2004–2006), and through  the European Community (EC) program COMENIUS (LifeLong Learning Program) for two two-year periods (2008–2010, 2010-2012). EU-HOU has extended up to 15 EC countries, with national websites. The [[Pierre and Marie Curie University]] in [[Paris]] is the educational centre for the EU-HOU project. The EU-HOU project has developed numerous  (free) pedagogical resources tested in classrooms and posted on the project's [http://www.euhou.net website]. The most ambitious ones are: (1) the multilingual [http://www.euhou.net/index.php/salsaj-software-mainmenu-9 SalsaJ] software: it enables secondary school pupils to handle astronomical data and analyse them. An exercise series based on this software has been developed. Associated data can be downloaded directly from the software. (2) The EUHOUMW Small Radiotelescope Network developed in the framework of the Comenius project "Connecting classrooms to the Milky Way" enables secondary school pupils to access the instruments installed in five different European countries (France, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain). Kids can observe the hydrogen from the Milky Way with these 3-metres radiotelescopes. Every operation can be performed from the [http://euhou.obspm.fr/public/ Web interface], available in 17 different languages, which enables the learners to reconstruct the rotation curve of the Milky Way as well as its spiral arms. Pedagogical resources (teacher's manual, [http://euhou.obspm.fr/public/simu.php simulator of observation], [http://euhou.obspm.fr/public/archive.php archives], [http://www.euhou.net/index.php/exercises-mainmenu-13/radio/352-pedagogical-material kinesthetic activities]) have been tested in teacher's training, secondary school level and also at undergraduate level.

In [[United States|America]], the US HOU project&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |bibcode= 1996AAS...189.3004A |title=Hands-On Universe: Meaningful Astronomical Research in the Classroom |journal=Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society|volume=28|pages=1311 |date=1996|author1=Asbell-Clarke |first1=J. |last2=Barclay |first2=T. |last3=Deustua |first3=S. |last4=Gordon |first4=S. |last5=Marshall |first5=A. |last6=Pennypacker |first6=C. |last7=Refling |first7=J. |last8=Hoette |first8=V. |last9=Lohman |first9=R. |last10=Morin |first10=T. |last11=Pack |first11=H. |last12=Rodriguez |first12=B. |last13=Spuck |first13=T. |last14=Toler |first14=D. }}&lt;/ref&gt; is led by the United States with support from the [[National Science Foundation]], the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], and the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]. In the USA, HOU has developed and pilot tested an educational program that enables high school students to request their own observations from professional observatories. Students download telescope images to their classroom computers and use the powerful HOU image processing software to visualize and analyze their  data. [[High school]] [[curriculum]] developed by HOU integrates many of the science and math topics and skills outlined in national standards into open-ended astronomical investigations. HOU has also developed activities and tools for middle school students and products for informal science education centers. The Lawrence Hall of Science at [[University of California, Berkeley]], is the educational center for the HOU project.

In [[Asia]], the AS-HOU section have China and Japan strongly involved. They have their own web sites.

In Africa, AF-HOU is now extending to Kenya&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |bibcode= 2008cosp...37.2272O |title=Hands-on Universe |journal=37th COSPAR Scientific Assembly|volume=37 |page=E2|id=PE2-0011-08|author1=Oduori |first1=Susan |year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a recently launched pilot, researchbased astronomy and astrophysics curriculum into Kenya High in Nairobi, Kenya as a vehicle to introducing the methodologies of scientific research into secondary education.

== Teacher training sessions ==

In the context of the European Commission [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013]], EU-HOU proposes regular European training sessions in France, at [[Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University]] in Paris, since 2010. These sessions are published on the Comenius training database (reference numbers: FR-2010-314-003, FR-2011-359-006, [http://ec.europa.eu/education/trainingdatabase/index.cfm?fuseaction=DisplayCourse&amp;cid=34183 FR-2013-408-003]).

The main goal of these training sessions is to re-awake the interest for science in the young generation with inquiry-based methods. Active methods based e.g. on kinesthesia ([[Proprioception]]) have been recently introduced to introduce modelling concepts. Renewing of the teaching of science is fulfilled through astronomy as a well-established source of motivation, and through the use of new Information and Communication Technologies - ICT. Involving teachers in a variety of research-based astronomical projects, they will get excited, enthused and motivated to teach science/technology/maths. '''The training is intended to enhance basic competencies of teachers and develop higher level skills and expertise, primarily in [[Information and communication technologies in education]] (ICT), maths and physics area'''.

These sessions are financed through European Commission Comenius national Agencies ([[Comenius programme]]). Information related to scheduled training sessions are posted on the [http://www.euhou.net/index.php/training-sessions-mainmenu-184 EU-HOU] Website and its [http://www.euhou.net/index.php/news-mainmenu-49 news].

A dedicated [http://www.euhou.net/index.php/forum/index forum]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} in English has been opened to favour feed-back from trained teachers and interaction with a wider educator and researcher community.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2048">The '''Globe of Matelica''' (Globo of Matelica) is an ancient Roman [[sundial]] sculpted on a marble ball. The artifact was found during the 1985 reconstruction of the medieval Palazzo Pretorio, presently Museo Civico Archeologico, of [[Matelica]] in the region of [[Marche]], Italy.

==Description==
The globe measures nearly 29&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter an appears to be sculpted from a cristalline marble originating near [[Ephesus]] in present-day Turkey. It is thought to date from the first two centuries CE. There is one similar item, identified in 1939 by [[Carl William Blegen]] in a Museum in [[Nafplio]], Greece.

All that remains is the stone component, it is engraved with a variety or lines and letter sare inscribed. The sphere is bisected by a center line while on its top are three concentric circles of various diameters, intersected by an arc of a circle and on which words in ancient Greek alphabet are still visible, and 13 holes, each marked by a Greek letter. In these holes were probably metallic insertions that delineated the hour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antiqui.it/archeoastronomia/globo.htm Description of Astronomical calculus of globe], by  Andrea Carusi and Danilo Baldini, from l'Astronomia n. 92 (October 1989) pp. 30-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lower part there is a large conical depression which ends with a big rectangular hole maybe made to secure the base. Other theories for the sphere are that it was used for astronomical calculations, thus as an [[armillary sphere]] or for use in [[spherical astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turismo.marche.it/Turismi/Cultura-The-genius-of-Marche/The-best-of/Title/Globo-di-Matelica/IdPOI/3677/C2/31/T/16?page=1 Tourism Office of the Region of Marche], entry on globe.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guillermo Morphy y Ferríz de Guzmán''', best known as '''Conde Morphy''' or '''Count Morphy''' (February 29, 1836 – August 27, 1899 in Madrid) was a Spanish aristocrat, music critic, musicologist, historian, educator, composer and politician. He became personal secretary to King [[Alfonso XII of Spain]] in 1875. He became a highly admired figure in artistic circles of late nineteenth century Madrid, and for his service to the Crown of Spain. He was a friend of [[Isaac Albéniz]], who he arranged a grant for to study at the [[Royal Conservatory of Brussels]]. He served as director of the Royal Concert Society at the [[Teatro Real]] in Madrid until 1891.

==Biography==
Born in Madrid on February 29, 1836, he was of Irish descent, son of Joseph Morphy.&lt;ref name= "Clark p. 36"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filomusica.com/filo49/bayreuth.html|title=Guillermo Morphy|publisher=Filomusica.com|accessdate=March 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent his childhood traveling through France, Italy and Germany, among other countries, where he had a European renaissance education becoming a lover of art and literature. He lived for two years in Germany between 1846 and 1848.&lt;ref name= "Clark p. 36"&gt;{{harvnb|Clark|2002|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1858, he took over his father's law firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qlinks.net/FamilyHistory/d0000/g0000032.html#I582|title=Guillermo MORPHY Y FERRIZ DE GUZMAN (Conde de)|publisher=Qlinks.net|accessdate=March 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863 he took classes under the composer [[François-Joseph Fétis]] in Brussels.&lt;ref name= "Clark p. 7"&gt;{{harvnb|Clark|1998|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he returned he entered the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]] on November 28, 1863 as a gentleman of the then Prince of Asturias and future King [[Alfonso XII of Spain]], a position he held until the Revolution in 1868 that overthrew [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabel II]].&lt;ref name= "Clark p. 36"/&gt;

He moved to France to engage in musicology, and during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] he traveled to [[Vienna]] to be with Prince Alfonso. There he composed the opera ''Lizzie'' and other orchestral parts.&lt;ref name= "boileau-music.com p. "&gt;{{harvnb|boileau-music.com|2012|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[Bourbon Restoration]], he returned to Spain with the King, who appointed him his personal secretary on January 18, 1875 and granted him the title Count Morphy on May 3, 1882.&lt;ref name= "Clark p. 36"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Ruvigny-Massue-Ruvigny p. 352"&gt;{{harvnb|Ruvigny|Massue|Ruvigny|2000| p=352}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published several studies and translated into Spanish a biography of [[Beethoven]], and in 1892 entered the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando. He also served as director of the [[Royal Concert Society]] at the [[Teatro Real]] in Madrid until 1891.

Morphy was also an acquaintance and benefactor of several notable musicians of the time, such as [[Tomás Bretón]], [[Pablo Casals]] and [[Isaac Albéniz]].&lt;ref name= "boileau-music.com p. "/&gt; The count was a close friend of Albéniz in particular and was highly enthusiastic towards his talent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaudiallgaudi.com/AM005albeniz.htm|title=Albéniz|publisher=Gaudiallgaudi.com|accessdate=March 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was Morphy who arranged for a grant for him to study at the [[Royal Conservatory of Brussels]].&lt;ref name= "Clark p. 36"/&gt; Morphy also arranged for violinist [[Enrique Fernández Arbós]] to study under [[Henri Vieuxtemps]] in Brussels.&lt;ref name= "Clark p. 36"/&gt; Albéniz dedicated his composition ''[[Sevilla (Albéniz)|Sevilla]]'' to Count Morphy's wife when he premiered in a piano performance in Paris on January 24, 1886.&lt;ref name= "Clark p. 69"&gt;{{harvnb|Clark|2002|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In late 1883, a number of musicians, led by Count Morphy, sharing the same concerns regarding the regeneration of Spanish art, gathered together in a society in Madrid to found the Philharmonic Institute with the aim of offering musical training at the same level as other European centres. The regenerative nature of their educational project, compared to the teachings of the Conservatory of Madrid, is highlighted. In particular, the bel canto school run by Napoleón Verger helped to improve the standard of singing in Spain and to endow opera stages with renowned figures, thus paving the way for the establishment of Spanish lyric drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=García Álvarez de la Villa |first1=Beatriz |title=El Instituto Filarmónico |journal=Cuadernos de Música Iberoamericana |date=2016 |volume=29 |pages=81–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From 1886 to 1895, the Count of Morphy assumed a leading role as president of the Fine Arts section, he engaged with the activities of the society by giving lectures and by introducing the Ateneo to his own aesthetic principles, including his regenerationist agenda and his musical nationalism. He also extended invitations to some of the most relevant international figures and to a young generation of Spanish artists, with the intention of bringing the public closer to the European cultural scene. The Ateneo experienced a period of splendor with a new impulse in vocal, instrumental and chamber music, and a renewed repertoire with contemporary works by Spanish and Central European composers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=García Álvarez de la Villa |first1=Beatriz |title=Regeneracionismo musical en el Ateneo de Madrid bajo la presidencia del Conde de Morphy (1886-1895) |journal=Revista de Musicología |volume=40 |date=2017 |issue=vol.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1716">'''Helena''' (active during the 4th century BC in Egypt) was a painter who learned her craft from her father, Timon, who was also an artist. She worked in the period after the death of [[Alexander the Great]] in 323 BC. Helena painted a scene of Alexander defeating the Persian ruler, [[Darius III]], at the [[Battle of Issus]] in Southern Asia Minor.&lt;ref name="Lightman 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lightman1|first1=Marjorie|last2=Lightman |first2=Benjamin|title=A to Z of ancient Greek and Roman women|year=2008|publisher=Facts On File|location=New York|isbn=1438107943|edition=Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith 1870"/&gt;

[[Pliny the Elder]] writes that “The Battle of Issus” was Helena’s only recorded work, of which there is a mosaic reproduction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4812">The '''Hoboken catalogue''' is a catalogue of the musical compositions by [[Joseph Haydn]] compiled by [[Anthony van Hoboken]]. It is intended to cover the composer's entire oeuvre and includes over 750 entries. Its full title in the original German is ''Joseph Haydn, Thematisch-bibliographisches Werkverzeichnis'' ("Joseph Haydn, thematic-bibliographic catalog of works"). The Haydn catalog that now bears Hoboken's name was begun in card format in 1934; work continued until the publication of the third and final book volume in 1978.

Works by Haydn are often indicated using their Hoboken catalogue number, typically in the format "[[Violin Concerto No. 1 (Haydn)|Violin Concerto No. 1]] in C major, Hob. VIIa:1".

==The catalog==
The catalog is a massive work; a currently available version runs to 1936 pages.&lt;ref&gt;Available in pdf format from [https://archive.org/details/JosephHaydnThematisch-bibliographischesWerkverzeichnis].&lt;/ref&gt; Each work is given with an identifying [[incipit]], printed on a single musical line. There is discussion of manuscript sources, early editions, listing in previous catalogs (including the two Haydn prepared), and critical commentary.

==Organization==

Catalogs of composers' works typically follow either a chronological arrangement (sorting by date of composition) or a sorting by musical genre.&lt;ref&gt;Examples of the chronological type are [[Köchel catalogue]] of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s works, or [[Schubert Thematic Catalogue|Otto Erich Deutsch's catalogue]] of [[Franz Schubert]]'s works. Another example of the genre-arranged type is [[Wolfgang Schmieder]]'s catalogue of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s works.&lt;/ref&gt; Hoboken's catalogue is of the latter type; thus the [[Symphony|symphonies]], for example, are in category I, all [[string quartet]]s are in category III, [[piano sonata]]s are in category XVI, and so on.

An ITHC is generally performed by an external service provider, although [[Government Communications Headquarters|NCSC]] personnel may perform ITHCs on especially sensitive systems. It can touch on both applications and [[Computer networking|infrastructure]], and involves an element of [[penetration test]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tigerscheme.org/qualifications.php?ID=5

'''Intelligent Word Recognition''', or IWR, is the recognition of unconstrained handwritten words. IWR recognizes entire handwritten words or phrases instead of character-by-character, like its predecessor, [[Optical Character Recognition]] (OCR).   IWR technology matches handwritten or printed words to a user-defined dictionary, significantly reducing character errors encountered in typical character-based recognition engines.  

New technology on the market utilizes IWR, [[Optical character recognition|OCR]], and [[Intelligent character recognition|ICR]] together, which opens many doors for the processing of documents, either constrained (hand printed or machine printed) or unconstrained (freeform cursive).  IWR also eliminates a large percentage of the manual [[Data entry clerk|data entry]] of handwritten documents that, in the past, could only be keyed by a human, creating an automated workflow.

When cursive handwriting is in play, for each word analyzed, the system breaks down the words into a sequence of graphemes, or subparts of letters.  These various curves, shapes and lines make up letters and IWR considers these various shape and groupings in order to calculate a confidence value associated with the word in question.

IWR is not meant to replace [[Intelligent character recognition|ICR]] and [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] engines which work well with printed data; however, IWR reduces the number of character errors associated with these engines, and it is ideal for processing real-world documents that contain mostly freeform, hard-to-recognize data, inherently unsuitable for them.

The '''International Council on Systems Engineering''' ('''INCOSE'''; pronounced in-co-see) is a [[non-profit]] membership organization dedicated to the advancement of [[systems engineering]] and to raise the professional stature of systems engineers. INCOSE is the world’s largest Professional Network of Systems Engineers.

== Overview ==
Founded in 1990, INCOSE has over ten thousand members representing a broad spectrum – from student to senior practitioner, from technical engineer to program and [[corporate management]], from [[science]] and [[engineering]] to [[business development]]. Members work together to advance their technical knowledge, exchange ideas with colleagues, and collaborate to advance systems engineering.

The organization's mission is to advance the state of the art and practice of systems engineering in [[industry]], [[academia]], and [[government]] by promoting interdisciplinary, scalable approaches to produce technologically appropriate solutions that meet societal needs.

INCOSE is governed by a Board of Directors. Its technical activities are led by a Technical Operations board with oversight over thirty-nine working groups operating under  seven technical committees focused on Education &amp; Research, Modeling &amp; Tools, Process &amp; Improvement, SE Management, SE Initiatives, Standards, and SE Applications. It publishes [[periodical]]s, [[user manual|manual]]s and instructional materials; sponsors [[Academic conference|conference]]s; develops [[Standardization|standard]]s; and works to promote education and registration of systems engineers.

INCOSE is a member organization of the [[Federation of Enterprise Architecture Professional Organizations]] (FEAPO), a worldwide association of professional organizations which have come together to provide a forum to standardize, professionalize, and otherwise advance the discipline of [[Enterprise Architecture]].

== History ==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[National Council on Systems Engineering]] --&gt;
The beginnings of INCOSE may be traced back to a meeting in 1989, hosted by [[General Dynamics]]  at the [[University of California]], [[San Diego|San Diego, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1520-6858(1998)1:1&lt;4::AID-SYS2&gt;3.0.CO;2-M| title = INCOSE: History of the International Council on Systems Engineering| journal = Systems Engineering| volume = 1| issue = 1| pages = 4–13| year = 1998| last1 = Honour | first1 = E. C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the apparent shortage of qualified [[engineer]]s who could think in terms of a total system, rather than just a specific discipline. In the summer of 1990, [[Boeing]] hosted a follow-up meeting at the Battelle Conference Center in [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]]. This meeting was attended by about 30 people, and shared similar concerns. The group adopted a charter, formed ''[[ad hoc]]'' committees to tackle the systems engineering issues, and formed the National Council on Systems Engineering (NCOSE). Harry Carlson from [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], Jerry Lake from the Defense System Management College, and Brian Mar from the [[University of Washington]] were selected as the provisional co-chairpersons. More meetings and workshops were held in 1990 and 1991, sponsored by the [[Aerospace Corporation]], [[IBM]], and [[TRW Inc.|TRW]].

The first NCOSE conference was held in cooperation with the American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM) in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] in October 1991. Other conferences were held annually, at various locations in the United States.

In the summer of 1995, the organization officially changed its name to the International Council on Systems Engineering or INCOSE, to reflect the growing participation of professionals from ten different countries around the world. Since the 1990s INCOSE has continued to grow and by the end of 2007 "there were over six thousand members representing a broad spectrum – from student to senior practitioner, from technical engineer to program and corporate management, from science and engineering to business development".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.incose.org/about/index.aspx INCOSE overview], retrieved 7 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Istituto Superiore di Sanità''''' (National Institute of Health), also '''ISS''', is an [[Italy|Italian]] public institution that, as the leading technical-scientific body of the Italian National Health Service (''[[Servizio Sanitario Nazionale]]''), performs [[research]], [[Clinical trial|trials]], control, [[counseling]], [[documentation]] and [[training]] for public health. The Institute is under the supervision of the ''Ministero della Salute'' (Ministry of Health).

==History==
[[Image:ISS 050207.JPG|350px|right|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Headquarters of ISS in [[Rome]].&lt;/center&gt;]]
The official opening of the ISS, called ''Istituto di Sanità Pubblica'' (Institute of Public Health), took place on April 21, 1934.
The construction of the main building in [[Rome]], designed by architect Giuseppe Amendola, started on July 6, 1931 and it was financed by the American [[Rockefeller Foundation]].

In 1941 the ''Istituto di Sanità Pubblica'' assumed its present name of ''Istituto Superiore di Sanità''

In 1958 the ISS came under the protection of the [[Ministry of Health (Italy)|Ministry of Health]], from the [[Ministry of Interior]].

'''John Tasioulas''' (born 18 December 1964) is a Greek-Australian moral and legal philosopher. He is the inaugural Yeoh Professor of Politics, Philosophy and Law at [[The Dickson Poon School of Law]], [[King's College London]] and Director of the [[Yeoh Tiong Lay]] Centre for Politics, Philosophy, and Law.{{r|joins}} He holds dual Australian and British citizenship.

==Biography==
John Tasioulas was born in Wollongong, New South Wales, in 1964.{{r|cv}} His parents migrated to Australia from [[Dasyllio]] in the [[Grevena]] region of Greece. He was a student at [[Northcote High School]] and [[Melbourne High School (Victoria)|Melbourne High School]]. He completed undergraduate degrees in Philosophy and Law at the [[University Of Melbourne|University of Melbourne]] and was the 1989 [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholar]] for Victoria.{{r|psonis}} Studying at [[Balliol College]], he received a doctorate (D.Phil in Philosophy) from [[Oxford university|Oxford University]] for a thesis on moral relativism which was supervised by [[Joseph Raz]]. Tasioulas was a Lecturer in Jurisprudence at the [[Glasgow university|University of Glasgow]] (1992–1998), Reader in Moral and Legal Philosophy at the University of Oxford where he was a Tutorial Fellow in Philosophy at [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi College]] (1998–2010), and [[Quain Professor|Quain Professor of Jurisprudence]] in the [[UCL Faculty of Laws|Faculty of Laws]], [[University College London]] (2011–2014). He is an Honorary Professorial Fellow at Melbourne Law School, an Emeritus Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, a Distinguished Research Fellow of the Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics, and a member of the [[Academia Europaea]].{{r|ae|ccae}} He has been a Fellow at the [[Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study]] at [[Harvard University]] and a Visiting Professor of Law at the [[University of Chicago Law School]]. He delivered the 'Or 'Emet Lecture at [[Osgoode Hall Law School]] (2011), the Natural Law Lecture at Notre Dame Law School (2012), and the Van Hasselt Lecture at Delft University of Technology (2016). 

==Academic expertise==

Tasioulas works in moral, legal and political philosophy. He has advanced a version of the communicative theory of punishment, according to which the overarching point of punishment is the communication of censure to wrong-doers. His version of the theory is distinctive in making room for the value of mercy alongside that of retributive justice. 

In the philosophy of human rights, Tasioulas has argued for an orthodox understanding of such rights, according to which they are moral rights possessed by all human beings simply in virtue of their humanity. This contrasts with a more recent view that characterizes human rights in terms of some political role(s), such as being triggers for international intervention or benchmarks of internal legitimacy. According to Tasioulas, human rights have a foundation both in a plurality of human interests and in equal human dignity. 

He has written on a range of other topics including moral relativism, the ethics of biomedicine, and the philosophy of international law. His co-edited volume, ''The Philosophy of International Law'' (OUP, 2010), is a central text in the field.

'''HORIBA MIRA Ltd.''' (formerly the '''Motor Industry Research Association''') is an [[automotive]] engineering and development consultancy company headquartered near [[Nuneaton]] in [[Warwickshire]], [[United Kingdom]]. It provides product engineering, research, testing, information and certification services to the automotive sector. Its headquarters are in the '''MIRA Technology Park Enterprise Zone'''. On 14 July 2015 MIRA announced that it was being bought by the Japanese-owned testing equipment group [[Horiba]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.horiba-mira.com/news-and-events/2015/july/horiba-acquires-mira-in-historic-sale]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
MIRA was formed in 1946 and was mostly government-funded. It is based just off the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]] near the junction with the [[A444 road|A444]] in the parish of [[Higham on the Hill]] (also near [[Fenny Drayton]]), [[Leicestershire]], where around five hundred staff work, with another establishment in [[Basildon]] in [[Essex]]. The company dates back to the foundation of the [[Cycle Engineers' Institute]] (CEI) in 1898, which became the Incorporated Institution of Automobile Engineers (IAE) in 1906. The IAE became the Automotive Branch of the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers|IMechE]] in 1946. The IAE and the [[Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders]] were largely responsible for creating MIRA.

===Pooling of expertise===
After World War Two, the UK car industry was finding it difficult to export to countries where it formerly had little trouble finding markets for its wide range of cars. It was decided by the government to pool the research resources of UK car manufacturers into one site to reduce costs and possibly find new technological advances sooner that could be incorporated into all ranges of UK vehicle makes. The principal auto-makers were located in the [[Birmingham]] area, apart from [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] which had its factory in Luton and [[Ford of Britain|Ford]] which by now was located at [[Ford Dagenham assembly plant|Dagenham]] to the east of London.&lt;ref name=Motor196905/&gt; The Motor Industry Research institution under its director Dr Albert Fogg (who would later become Engineering Chief at [[British Leyland]]) therefore looked for a location that was reasonably accessible from all these locations, and the site near Nuneaton fulfilled that criterion.&lt;ref name=Motor196905&gt;{{cite magazine | authorlink =Harold Hastings |title = What MIRA stands for|magazine=Motor| volume =  | pages =75–78| date = 10 May 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The facilities became available to MIRA member companies in October 1948, though at this stage the test tracks consisted only of disused runways.&lt;ref name=Motor196905/&gt; They were finally opened on 28 April 1949 by Dr Fogg who used explosives to cut the ceremonial tape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MIRA: World-class Vehicle Engineering, Test and Development {{!}} MIRA|url = http://www.mira.co.uk/about-mira/mira-heritage#timeline-milestone_835|website = www.mira.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facilities were nevertheless developed under Dr Fogg and [[Professor Robert Macmillan]] who took over the directorship from Fogg in 1964.&lt;ref name=Motor196905/&gt; Such examples include the half mile [[Belgian Pavé]] road used in vehicle tests, completed in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MIRA: World-class Vehicle Engineering, Test and Development {{!}} MIRA|url = http://www.mira.co.uk/about-mira/mira-heritage#timeline-milestone_139|website = www.mira.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secondary safety===
Marking the increasing concern with [[secondary safety]] at the time was the opening by the [[Minister of Technology]] [[Tony Benn]], in April 1968, of MIRA's indoor rig for crash-testing cars in head-on impacts.&lt;ref name=Motor196804&gt;{{cite magazine | authorlink = Charles Bulmer (Ed)|title = News: New MIRA test facility|magazine=Motor| volume =  |page=73| date = 6 April 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Such tests, at {{convert|30|mph|abbr=on}}, had recently become mandatory for cars sold in the US.&lt;ref name=Motor196804/&gt;   The MIRA crash rig featured the UK's largest industrial [[linear induction motor]].&lt;ref name=Motor196804/&gt; It was based on a design by Professor [[Eric Laithwaite]] of Imperial College. It replaced a complicated outdoor system that had involved the "victim" car's final seconds being controlled by means of a radar-operated remote device from a following vehicle.&lt;ref name=Motor196804/&gt;

===Commercial organisation===
Since 1975, the funding arrangements for belonging to the organisation went from a membership subscription (or levy – mostly irrespective of the quantity of work that took place for individual manufacturers) for car companies to a fee-based system. Currently, the site has around £110 million of test equipment. On 4 July 2001, the organisation changed its name to '''MIRA Ltd'''. At this point, it also became liable for [[United Kingdom corporation tax|corporation tax]]. It bought the Creative Automotive Design consultancy in March 2003. The company's turnover has increased 4.9% to £45.7m in 2013, producing a £6m surplus which was all reinvested back into itself. On 14 July 2015 MIRA announced that it was being bought by the Japanese-owned testing equipment group HORIBA and changed its name to '''HORIBA MIRA Ltd.'''

==Technology park==
HORIBA MIRA is headquartered within the MIRA Technology Park, a park for automotive research and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/business/nuneaton-based-mira-reveals-impressive-year-4872512 |title=Nuneaton-based MIRA reveals impressive year of growth | last=Waddington |first=Jenny |publisher=[[Coventry Telegraph]] |date=5 July 2013 |accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the UK government announced that the 850 acre park would become an [[enterprise zone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-14552193 |title=New 'enterprise zones' announced around England |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |date=17 August 2011 |accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies who have moved into the park include [[Haldex (company)|Haldex]] and [[Aston Martin]]. In February 2015 the government announced that the enterprise zone would be expanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/local-news/nuneaton-based-mira-gets-green-light-8637459 |title=Nuneaton-based MIRA gets green light to expand Technology Park | last=Waddington |first=Jenny |publisher=Coventry Telegraph |date=12 February 2015 |accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Former airfield==
The [[proving ground]] which forms the largest area of HORIBA MIRA is built on {{convert|760|acres}} of the former [[RAF Lindley]] airfield, named after the nearby Lindley Hall Farm&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/337265 Lindley Hall Farm] photo&lt;/ref&gt; after the former Lindley Hall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webspinners.org.uk/weddingtoncastle2/new_page_49.htm Lindley Hall] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709171930/http://www.webspinners.org.uk/weddingtoncastle2/new_page_49.htm |date=9 July 2009 }} at the website of [[Weddington Castle]]. 2008. Retrieved 2011-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt; This farm claims to be the centre of England,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2271925.stm A tale of two centres], BBC News, 22 October 2002 Retrieved 2011-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt; if calculated by the centre of mass method, similar to a [[centroid]]. [[Meriden, West Midlands|Meriden]] also makes a similar claim. The [[Ashby and Nuneaton Joint Railway]] used to pass along the south-east perimeter of HORIBA MIRA, and is now the Weddington Country Walk. The line was open to freight until 1971, and had a station at Higham on the Hill on the perimeter of HORIBA MIRA.

==Operations==
HORIBA MIRA is a provider of product engineering, [[research]], testing, development and certification to the worldwide transport industry. Its work includes crash testing, aerodynamic design and vehicle ergonomics. It was developed to provide research for UK companies but now provides engineering consultancy to clients worldwide.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2602">A '''macro recorder''' is a piece of [[software]] that records user actions for playback at a later time. 
The main advantage of using a macro recorder is that it allows a user to easily perform complex operations much faster and with less effort without requiring custom computer programming or scripting.

== Built-in Macro Recorders ==

Most word processors, text editors and other office programs come with built-in macro recorder tools which automate the user's actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/products/HA010192301033.aspx MS KB Article: Using macros to speed up your work] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218163151/http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/products/HA010192301033.aspx |date=2008-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Standalone macro recorders ==

Not all software comes with a built-in macro recorder. A standalone macro-recorder program allows a user to "record" mouse and keyboard functions for "playback" at a later time. This allows automating any activity in any software application: from copy-pasting spreadsheet data to [[operating system]] maintenance actions.

Most macro recorders do not attempt to analyze or interpret what the user did when the macro was recorded. This can cause problems when trying to play back a macro if the user's desktop environment has changed. For example, if the user has changed their desktop resolution, moved icons, or moved the task bar, the ''mouse'' macro may not perform the way the user intended. That's one of the reasons for preferring ''keyboard'' macros over the mouse-oriented ones.

However, some recorders do attempt to analyze user actions, trying to record mouse activity in window-related, not screen-related coordinates, for instance, or to detect exactly what [[Widget (computing)|widget]] a user selected.

Possible features of standalone macro recorders include:
* a built-in editor that allows a macro to be composed rather than recorded. This includes adding [[conditional (programming)|conditional statements]], custom commands such as "open file", "launch website" or "shutdown computer".
* conversion of a macro to a compressed [[Executable|executable file (".exe")]] that can run independently, without the need for the software that generated the macro to be present on the user's computer.

== History ==

The [[emacs]] text editor is well known for its macro-recording ability,{{weasel-inline|date=January 2017}} whose name is an acronym for Editing MACroS.

{{Usul al-fiqh}}
A '''''{{transl|ar|ALA|madhhab}}''''' ({{lang-ar|مذهب}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|maḏhab}}'', {{IPA-ar|ˈmaðhab|IPA}}, "way to act"; pl. {{lang|ar|مذاهب}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|maḏāhib}}'', {{IPA-ar|maˈðaːhɪb|}}) is a school of thought within ''[[fiqh]]'' (Islamic [[jurisprudence]]). In the first 150 years of [[Islam]], there were numerous ''madhahib'', most of which have become extinct or merged with other schools. The [[Amman Message]], which was endorsed in 2005 by prominent Islamic scholars around the world, recognized four [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] schools ([[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Hanbali]]), two [[Shia Islam|Shia]] schools ([[Ja'fari jurisprudence|Ja'fari]], [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]]), the [[Ibadi]] school and the [[Zahiri]] school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amman Message|url=http://ammanmessage.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=15&amp;Itemid=29&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Ancient" schools===
According to John Burton, “modern research shows” that fiqh was first “regionally organized” with “considerable disagreement and variety of view”. In the second century of Islam, schools of fiqh were noted for the loyalty of their jurists  to the legal practices of their local communities, whether [[Mecca]], [[Kufa]], [[Basra]], Syria, etc.&lt;ref name=JBSILITA1990:13&gt;[[#JBSILITA1990|Burton, ''Islamic Theories of Abrogation'', 1990]]: p.13&lt;/ref&gt; (Egypt's school in [[Fustat]] was a branch of Medina's school of law and followed such practices -- up until the end of the 8th century -- as basing verdict on one single witness (not two) and the oath of the claimant. Its principal jurist in the second half of the 8th century was al-Layth b. Sa'd.){{#tag:ref|
It is usually assumed that no regional school developed in Egypt (unlike in Syria, Iraq and the Hijaz). Joseph Schacht states that the legal milieu of [[Fustat]] (ancient Cairo) was a branch of the Medinan school of law.&lt;ref&gt;J. Schacht, ''The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1950), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding judicial practices, the qadis (judges) of Fustat resorted to the procedure called "''al-yamin ma'a l-shahid''", that is, the ability of the judge to base his verdict on one single witness and the oath of the claimant, instead of two witnesses as was usually required. Such a procedure was quite common under the early Umayyads, but by the early Abbasid period it had disappeared in Iraq and it was now regarded as the {{'}}''amal'' ("good practice") of Medina. Up until the end of the 8th century, the qadis of Fustat were still using this "Medinan" procedure and differentiated themselves from Iraqi practices. From a doctrinal point of view, however, the legal affiliation of Egypt could be more complex. The principal Egyptian jurist in the second half of the 8th century is al-Layth b. Sa'd.&lt;ref&gt;R.G. Khoury, "Al-Layth Ibn Sa'd (94/713-175/791), grand maître et mécène de l’Egypte, vu à travers quelques documents islamiques anciens", ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'' 40, 1981, p. 189–202&lt;/ref&gt; The only writing of his that has survived is a letter he wrote to Malik b. Anas, which has been preserved by Yahya b. Ma'in and al-Fasawi. In this letter, he proclaims his theoretical affiliation to the Medinan methodology and recognizes the value of the {{'}}''amal''. Nevertheless, he distances himself from the Medinan School by opposing a series of Medinan legal views. He maintains that the common practice in other cities is also valuable, and thus implicitly defends the Egyptians’ adherence to their own local tradition. Thus it is possible that, even though it did not develop into a formal school of law, a specific Egyptian legal milieu was distinct of the Medinan School in the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;Mathieu Tillier, "[https://www.academia.edu/1470575/Les_premiers_cadis_de_Fus_a_et_les_dynamiques_regionales_de_linnovation_judiciaire_750-833_ Les “premiers” cadis de Fusṭāṭ et les dynamiques régionales de l’innovation judiciaire (750-833)]", ''Annales Islamologiques'', 45 (2011), p. 214–218&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} 
[[Al-Shafi‘i]] writes that, `every capital of the Muslims is a seat of learning whose people follow the opinion of one of their countrymen in most of his teachings`.&lt;ref name=Schacht-OoMJ-1959-246&gt;{{cite book |title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence |last1=Schacht |first=Joseph |publisher=Oxford University Press |origyear= 1950 |year= 1959 |page=246 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tr-III-148&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shafi'i |page=148. Kitab Ikhtilaf Malid wal-Shafi'i | title=Kitab al-Umm vol. vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "real basis" of legal doctrine in these "ancient schools" was not a body of reports of Muhammad's sayings, doings, silent approval (the ahadith) or even those of his Companions, but the `living tradition` of the school as "expressed in the consensus of the scholars", according to Joseph Schacht.&lt;ref name=Schacht-OoMJ-1959-98&gt;{{cite book |title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence |last1=Schacht |first=Joseph |publisher=Oxford University Press |origyear= 1950 |year= 1959 |page=98 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Al-Shafi‘i and after===
It has been asserted that ''madhahib'' were consolidated in the 9th and 10th centuries as a means of excluding dogmatic theologians, government officials and non-Sunni sects from religious discourse.&lt;ref name="stewart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Islamic_law.aspx |title=Law, Islamic |work=[[Encyclopedia.com]] |accessdate=13 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have differed regarding the times at which the various schools emerged.  One interpretation is that Sunni Islam was initially{{when|date=December 2013}} split into four groups: the [[Hanafi]]tes, [[Maliki]]tes, [[Shafi'i]]tes and [[Zahiri]]tes.&lt;ref&gt;Mohammad Sharif Khan and Mohammad Anwar Saleem, ''Muslim Philosophy And Philosophers'', pg. 34. [[New Delhi]]: Ashish Publishing House, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the [[Hanbali]]tes and [[Jariri]]tes developed two more schools; then various dynasties effected the eventual exclusion of the Jarirites;&lt;ref name=mel&gt;[[Christopher Melchert]], ''The Formation of the Sunni Schools of Law'': 9th-10th Centuries C.E., pg. 178. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; eventually, the Zahirites were also excluded when the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] established a total of four independent [[Qadi|judicial positions]], thus solidifying the Maliki, Hanafi, Shafi'i and Hanbali schools.&lt;ref name="stewart" /&gt;  The Ottoman Empire later reaffirmed the official status of these four schools as a reaction to Shi'ite Persia.&lt;ref name=chib&gt;Chibli Mallat, ''Introduction to Middle Eastern Law'', pg. 116. [[Oxford]]: [[Oxford University Press]], 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-19-923049-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some are of the view that Sunni jurisprudence falls into two groups: ''Ahl al-Ra'i'' ("people of opinions", emphasizing scholarly judgment and reason) and ''[[Ahl al-Hadith]]'' ("people of traditions", emphasizing strict interpretation of scripture).&lt;ref&gt;Murtada Mutahhari, [http://www.al-islam.org/al-tawhid/ijtihad-legislation.htm ''The Role of Ijtihad in Legislation''], [http://www.al-islam.org/al-tawhid/ Al-Tawhid] volume IV, No.2, Publisher: [http://www.itf.org.ir/ Islamic Thought Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;

10th century [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] scholar [[Ibn al-Nadim]] named eight groups: Maliki, Hanafi, Shafi'i, Zahiri, [[Twelver|Imami Shi'ite]], Ahl al-Hadith, Jariri and [[Kharijites|Kharijite]].&lt;ref name=mel /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Devin J.

Historically, the ''fiqh'' schools were often in political and academic conflict with one another, vying for favor with the ruling government in order to have their representatives appointed to legislative and especially judiciary positions.&lt;ref name=chib /&gt;  Geographer and historian [[Al-Muqaddasi]] once satirically categorized competing ''madhahib'' with contrasting personal qualities: Hanafites, highly conscious of being hired for official positions, appeared deft, well-informed, devout and prudent; Malikites, dull and obtuse, confined themselves to observance of prophetic tradition; Shafi'ites were shrewd, impatient, understanding and quick-tempered; Zahirites haughty, irritable, loquacious and well-to-do; Shi'ites, entrenched and intractable in old rancor, enjoyed riches and fame; and Hanbalites, anxious to practice what they preached, were charitable and inspiring.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Massignon]], ''The Passion of al-Hallaj: Mystic and Martyr of Islam''. Trans. Herbert W. Mason. Pg. 130. [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]]: [[Princeton University Press]], 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; While such descriptions were almost assuredly humorous in nature, ancient differences were less to do with actual doctrinal opinions than with maneuvering for adherents and influence.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

== List of schools ==
Generally, Sunnis have a single preferred ''madhhab'' from region to region, but also believe that ''[[ijtihad]]'' must be exercised by the contemporary scholars capable of doing so.  Most rely on ''[[taqlid]]'', or acceptance of religious rulings and epistemology from a higher religious authority in deferring meanings of analysis and derivation of legal practices instead of relying on subjective readings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sahihmuslim.com/sps/sp.cfm?subsecID=MNJ06&amp;articleID=MNJ060001&amp;articlePages=1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rissc.jo/docs/1N-WithCovers(lowres).pdf On Islam, Muslims and the 500 most influential figures]&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts and scholars of ''fiqh'' follow the ''[[usul al-fiqh|usul]]'' (principles) of their own native ''madhhab'', but they also study the ''usul'', evidences, and opinions of other ''madhahib''.

===Sunni===
{{Sunni Islam|Sunni Schools of Law}}

[[Sunni]] schools of jurisprudence are each named after the classical jurist who taught them.  The four primary Sunni schools are the [[Hanafi]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] rites. The [[Zahiri]] school remains in existence but outside of the mainstream, while the [[Jariri]], [[Laythi]], [[Awza'i]] and [[Thawri]] have  become extinct.

The extant schools share most of their rulings, but differ on the particular practices which they may accept as authentic and the varying weights they give to [[Qiyas|analogical]] reason and pure reason.

* The [[Hanafi]] school was founded by [[Abu Hanifa an-Nu‘man]]. It is followed by Muslims in the Levant, Central Asia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, most of Egypt, Iraq, Turkey, the Balkans and by most of [[Islam in Russia|Russia's Muslim community]]. There are movements within this school such as [[Barelvi]]s and [[Deobandi]], which are concentrated in South Asia.
* The [[Maliki]] school was founded by [[Malik ibn Anas]]. It is followed by Muslims in North Africa, West Africa, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, in parts of Saudi Arabia and in Upper Egypt. The [[Murabitun World Movement]] follows this school as well. In the past, it was also followed in parts of [[Islam in Europe|Europe under Islamic rule]], particularly [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] and the [[Emirate of Sicily]].
* The [[Shafi'i]] school was founded by [[Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi'i]]. It is followed by Muslims in Saudi Arabia, Eastern Lower Egypt, Indonesia, Malaysia, Jordan, Palestine, the Philippines, Singapore, Somalia, Thailand, Yemen, Kurdistan, and the [[Mappila]]s of [[Kerala]] and [[Konkani Muslims]] of India. It is the official school followed by the governments of Brunei and Malaysia.
* The [[Hanbali]] school was founded by [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]]. It is followed by Muslims in Qatar, most of Saudi Arabia and minority communities in Syria and Iraq. The majority of the [[Salafi]]st movement claims to follow this school.
* The [[Zahiri]] school was founded by [[Dawud al-Zahiri]]. It is followed by minority communities in Morocco and Pakistan. In the past, it was also followed by the majority of Muslims in Mesopotamia, Portugal, the Balearic Islands, North Africa and parts of Spain.

===Shia===
{{Shia Islam|collapsed=1}}
{{Twelvers|collapsed=1}}

* [[Twelver]]s (see also ''[[Imami]]'')
** [[Ja'fari]]: associated with [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]].  The time and space bound [[Fatwa|rulings]] of early jurists are taken more seriously in this school, likely due to the more hierarchical structure of Shia Islam which is ruled by the Shi'ite [[Imam (Shia Islam)|Imams]].  The Ja'fari school is also more flexible in that every jurist has considerable power to alter a decision according to his reasoning. The Jafari school uses the [['aql|intellect]] instead of analogy when establishing Islamic laws, as opposed to common Sunni practice.
*** [[Usulism]]: forms the overwhelming majority within the Twelver Shia denomination. They follow a [[Marja'|Marja-i Taqlid]] on the subject of [[taqlid]] and fiqh. They are concentrated in &lt;nowiki&gt;Iran, Pakistan, Azerbaijan, India, Iraq, and Lebanon&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
*** [[Akhbarism]]: similar to Usulis, however reject [[ijtihad]] in favor of hadith. Concentrated in Bahrain.
*** [[Shaykhism]]: an Islamic religious movement founded by [[Shaykh Ahmad]] in the early 19th century [[Qajar dynasty]], Iran, now retaining a minority following in Iran and Iraq. It began from a combination of Sufi and Shia and Akhbari doctrines. In the mid 19th-century many Shaykhis converted to the [[Bábism|Bábí]] and [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] religions, which regard Shaykh Ahmad highly.
** The [[Batiniyyah]] school consists of [[Alevis]], [[Bektashi Order|Bektashis]], and [[Alawites]], who developed their own fiqh system and do not pursue the [[Ja'fari jurisprudence]].
*** [[Alawism]] is followed by [[Alawites]], who are also called Nusayris, Nusairis, Namiriya or Ansariyya. Their [[madh'hab]] was established by [[Ibn Nusayr]], and their [[aqidah]] is developed by [[Al-Khaṣībī]]. They follow ''Cillī'' [[aqidah]] of ''"Maymūn ibn [[Al-Tabarani|Abu’l-Qāsim Sulaiman ibn Ahmad ibn at-Tabarānī]] fiqh"'' of the [[‘Alawi]]s.&lt;ref name="Meymûn"&gt;"Muhammad ibn Āliyy’ūl Cillī [[aqidah]]" of "Maymūn ibn [[Al-Tabarani|Abu’l-Qāsim Sulaiman ibn Ahmad ibn at-Tabarānī]] fiqh" (Sūlaiman Affandy, ''Al-Bākūrat’ūs Sūlaiman’īyyah - [[Family tree]] of the [[Nusayri]] [[Tariqat]],'' pp. 14-15, [[Beirut]], 1873.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Both ''Muhammad ibn Āliyy’ūl Cillī'' and ''Maymūn ibn [[Al-Tabarani|Abu’l-Qāsim’at-Tabarānī]]'' were the [[murid]]s of ''"[[Al-Khaṣībī]]"'', the founder of the [[Nusayri]] [[tariqat]].&lt;/ref&gt; Slightly over one million of them live in Syria and Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/intro/islam-alawi.htm|title=Alawi Islam|author=John Pike|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*** [[Alevism]], sometimes categorized as part of Twelver Shia Islam and sometimes as its own religious tradition, as it has markedly different philosophy, customs, and rituals. They have many ''[[Tasawwuf]]ī'' characteristics and express belief in the [[Qur'an]] and [[The Twelve Imams]], but reject [[polygamy]] and accept religious traditions predating Islam, like Turkish [[shamanism]]. They are significant in East-Central Turkey. They are sometimes considered a Sufi sect, and have an untraditional form of religious leadership that is not scholarship oriented like other Sunni and Shia groups. They number around 24 million worldwide, of which 17 million are in [[Turkey]], with the rest in the [[Balkans]], [[Albania]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Iran]] and [[Syria]].
* [[Ismaili]] Muslims who adhere to the [[Shi'a]] [[Ismaili]] [[Fatimid]] fiqh, follow the ''[[Daim al-Islam]]'', a book on the rulings of Islam. It describes manners and etiquette, including [[Ibadat]] in the light of guidance provided by the Ismaili Imams. The book emphasizes what importance Islam has given to manners and etiquette along with the worship of God, citing the traditions of the first four Imams of the Shi'a Ismaili Fatimid school of thought.
** Tāyyebī Mustā'līyyah: the [[Mustaali]] group of Ismaili Muslims differ from the Nizāriyya in that they believe that the successor-Imām to the Fatimid caliph, al-Mustansir, was his younger son al-Mustaʻlī, who was made Caliph by the Fatimad Regent [[Al-Afdal Shahanshah]]. In contrast to the Nizaris, they accept the younger brother al-Mustaʻlī over Nizār as their Imam. The Bohras are an offshoot of the [[Taiyabi]], which itself was an offshoot of the Mustaali. The Taiyabi, supporting another offshoot of the Mustaali, the [[Hafizi]] branch, split with the Mustaali Fatimid, who recognized [[Al-Amir]] as their last Imam. The split was due to the Taiyabi believing that [[At-Tayyib Abi l-Qasim]] was the next rightful Imam after [[Al-Amir]]. The [[Hafizi]] themselves however considered [[Al-Hafiz]] as the next rightful Imam after [[Al-Amir]]. The Bohras believe that their 21st Imam, Taiyab abi al-Qasim, went into seclusion and established the offices of the [[Da'i al-Mutlaq]] (الداعي المطلق), Ma'zoon (مأذون) and Mukasir (مكاسر). The Bohras are the only surviving branch of the Mustaali and themselves have split into the [[Dawoodi Bohra]], [[Sulaimani Bohra]], and [[Alavi Bohra]].
** [[Nizari]]: the largest branch (95%) of [[Ismā'īlī]], they are the only Shia group to have their absolute temporal leader in the rank of Imamate, which is currently invested in [[Aga Khan IV]]. Their present living Imam is [[Mawlānā]] [[Shah Karim Al-Husayni]] who is the 49th Imam. [[Nizārī Ismā'īlī]]s believe that the successor-Imām to the [[Fatimid]] caliph [[Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah]] was his elder son [[Nizar (Fatimid Imam)|al-Nizār]]. While ''[[Nizārī]]'' belong to the "[[Imami]] jurisprudence" or [[Ja'fari jurisprudence|Ja'fāriyya Madhab ''(school of Jurisprudence)'']], believed by Shias to be founded by Imam [[Jafar Sadiq|Ja'far as-Sadiq]] they adhere to sumpremacy of "[[Kalam]]", in the interpretation of scripture, and believe in the temporal relativism of understanding, as opposed to fiqh ''(traditional [[nomianism|legalism]]),'' which adheres to an [[Moral absolutism|absolutism]] approach to [[revelation]].
* [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] jurisprudence follows the teachings of [[Zayd ibn Ali]]. In terms of law, the Zaidi school is quite similar to the Hanafi school from Sunni Islam.&lt;ref name="Sayyid 2005"&gt;Article by Sayyid 'Ali ibn 'Ali Al-Zaidi, التاريخ الصغير عن الشيعة اليمنيين (A short History of the Yemenite Shi‘ites, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; This is likely due to the general trend of Sunni resemblance within Zaidi beliefs. After the passing of Muhammad, Imam [[Jafar al-Sadiq]], Imam [[Zayd ibn Ali]], Imams [[Abu Hanifa]] and Imam [[Malik ibn Anas]] worked together in [[Al-Masjid an-Nabawi]] in Medina along with over 70 other leading jurists and scholars{{fact|date=November 2018}}.

===Ibadi ===
The [[Ibadi]] school of Islam is named after [[Abd-Allah ibn Ibadh]], though he is not necessarily the main figure of the school in the eyes of its adherents. Ibadism is distinct from both Sunni and Shi'ite Islam not only in terms of its jurisprudence, but also its core beliefs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30872">'''Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers''' ('''MRSECs''') are university based research centers supported by the MRSEC Program of the Division of Materials Research at the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF). The  centers support interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research of fundamental and technological importance and integrate research with education.  MRSECs require outstanding research quality, intellectual breadth, support for research infrastructure, and education outreach. MRSECs facilitate active collaborations between academic institutions, national laboratories, and industry, as well international collaborations.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;[http://www.mrsec.org/mrsec-program-overview "MRSEC Program Overview"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
MRSECs form a significant component of NSF's center-based research portfolio, but are also of historical importance. MRSECs were established by NSF in 1994&lt;ref name=overview&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; but have their roots in the NSF Materials Research Laboratories (MRLs) started in 1972, which in turn evolved from the Interdisciplinary Laboratories (IDLs) initiated by the Department of Defense in 1960.&lt;ref name=sproull&gt;R.L. Sproull, "Materials Research Laboratories: The Early Years" in ''Advancing Materials Research''  (P.A. Psaras and H. D. Lanford, eds., National Academy Press, Washington, D.C. 1987), pps. 25-34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;L.H. Schwartz, "Materials Research Laboratories: Reviewing the First Twenty-Five Years" in ''Advancing Materials Research''  (P.A. Psaras and H. D. Lanford, eds., National Academy Press, Washington, D.C. 1987), pps. 35-48.&lt;/ref&gt; These cross-disciplinary, center-based activities required significant changes in how materials research and education were carried out at academic institutions and the IDLs/MRLs are credited with contributing to the accelerating growth of  [[Materials Science and Engineering]] Departments in the U.S.  in the 1960s to 1980s.&lt;ref name=sproull&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They also made significant contributions to the National Materials Program that emerged from the early post [[Sputnik]] era, leading to a vigorous growth in science and engineering graduate education and the development of university based experimental facilities.&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since much of the information regarding current MRSECs is available from websites&lt;ref name=overview&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; only a brief overview of the current program is provided. The main purpose of this article is to review the historical aspects of MRSECs and the significance of their impact on materials research and education in the U.S.

== Current MRSEC Status ==

===Program Summary ===

The research carried out in MRSECs is carried out in interdisciplinary research groups (IRGs), teams of six to a dozen or more researchers working on a current research topic of national significance. MRSECs range in size from two to four IRGs. The topics of the IRGs within a center may be focused on closely related scientific or technological topics or can cover distinctly different areas of research.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding levels for a given MRSEC currently range approximately from $1.5 to $3.5 million annually, depending of the overall scope of the research program. Each center has considerable flexibility to distribute its funds consistent with its proposed and approved research and education proposal.  In addition, the centers are strongly encouraged to apply a modest fraction of their funds for support of "seed projects," allowing them to respond quickly to promising new research opportunities.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

MRSECs feature partnerships with other academic institutions, national laboratories, and industry as well as international collaborations. The centers also feature extensive experimental and computational facilities, which are generally accessible to outside users.  A recently established facility network coordinates access to a broad range of experimental tools across the nationwide network of MRSECs.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A key mandate for these centers is the training and education of a future highly skilled workforce. The largest component of the center's funding is directed toward support of students (undergraduate and graduate), and postdoctoral researchers.  In addition, MRSECS carry out a broad range of education and outreach activities involving K - 12 students and public education through collaborations with museums and other public institutions.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=garcia&gt;U.

===  Recent Competition Results ===

Generally, MRSEC awards are for six years with competitions held every three years.  Competitions are open to all US academic institutions and normally only one award is made per institution.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nine awards were made based on the competition held in 2010/2011&lt;ref name=nsfpress2010&gt;NSF Announces Results of the Materials Research Center and Teams Competition: [https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=121536 "National Science Foundation Press Release 11-186 (Sept. 8, 2011)"]&lt;/ref&gt; and twelve awards were made based on the 2013/2014 competition,&lt;ref name=nsfpress2015&gt; Funding cutting-edge, collaborative research.

== Historical Background ==

=== State of Materials Research Prior to 1960 ===

The modern study of materials intersects many of the traditional scientific disciplines, including physics, chemistry, engineering, and increasingly the biosciences and mathematics.  Until the middle of the 20th century the various disciplines approached the study of materials with their own distinctive methodologies. Interdisciplinary collaborations, especially at academic institutions, were not the norm.  Past exceptions were the successful collaborative approaches leading to the intense technological developments during the Second World War, including the military and peaceful applications of nuclear energy production.&lt;ref name=baker&gt;W.O. Baker, "Advances in Materials Research and Development" in Advancing Materials Research  (P.A. Psaras and H. D. Lanford, eds., National Academy Press, Washington, D.C. 1987), pps. 3-24.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The late 1950s saw important developments in how the federal government could play  an increasing role in supporting interdisciplinary, collaborative research at academic institutions. The successful launch of the Russian space satellite [[Sputnik]] on October 4, 1957 had a profound impact on how scientific and technological research was carried out in the United States.  Within a year of this date the federal government established two new agencies: The [[National  Aeronautic and Space Administration]] (NASA), which was to define US supported space exploration for the remainder of the century and beyond, and the Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA, later [[DARPA]]) within the Department of Defense.&lt;ref name=baker&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  ARPA was tasked with expanding the frontiers of technology and science, often with potential military applications. In addition, the [[National Defense Education Act of 1958]] had the main purpose to greatly increase the number of trained engineers, scientists, and mathematicians, and included provisions for financial assistance.&lt;ref name=baker&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The post Sputnik enthusiasm for more investment in science research led to a broader recommendation in March 1958 for coordinating materials research in the United States by President Eisenhower's Science and Advisory Committee (PSAC). A subsequent report entitled "Strengthening American Science", was submitted to President Eisenhower in December 1958.&lt;ref name=baker&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This report led, by Executive Order of President Eisenhower on March 13, 1959, to the formation of the Federal Council for Science and Technology.  One of the early actions of this council was the establishment of a "Coordinating Committee on Materials Research and Development" (CCMRD), which was chaired by John W. Williams, Director of Research of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). The ultimate outcome was the establishment of three university based Interdisciplinary Laboratories (IDLs) in mid 1960 under the supervision of ARPA.,&lt;ref name=sproull&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

The idea of an interdisciplinary laboratory in the solid state and materials sciences had already proved extremely successful in industrial laboratory settings (such as the Bell Laboratories and others) leading, for example,  to the development of the transistor and the laser. The establishment of such laboratories in an academic environment arose naturally from the demands of the post-Sputnik era for a large, highly trained, scientific workforce. American universities were ideally positioned to provide the opportunity to combine their educational mission with the planned development of larger, modern state-of-the-art experimental facilities.&lt;ref name=baker&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Interdisciplinary Laboratories (IDLs) 1960-1972 ===

The creation of three Interdisciplinary laboratories, at Cornell University, the University of Pennsylvania, and Northwestern University, was officially announced by ARPA on July 11, 1960.&lt;ref name=baker&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The contracts required that these universities "shall establish an interdisciplinary materials research program and shall furnish the necessary personnel and facilities for the conduct of research in the science of materials..."&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In the following year (1961) eight additional IDLs were created:&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Brown University, University of Chicago, Harvard, University of Maryland, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of North Carolina, Purdue University, and Stanford University.
  
A 12th IDL was added at the University of Illinois in 1962, which was administered by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC).  Subsequently, there were three more AEC contracts and two contracts through NASA.&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the AEC in establishing a strong materials research community was well known since the advent of nuclear reactors and the importance of materials in reactor cost, efficiency, and safety.&lt;ref name=sproull&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1955 [[John von Neumann]], renowned mathematician and contributor to the Manhattan Project, in his role as commissioner of the AEC and member of the AEC General Advisory Committee (GAC), strongly endorsed a materials-focused institute in an academic setting.&lt;ref name=sproull&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The impact of the IDLs on the training of students was significant.  By 1969 over 360 new doctorate degrees were awarded. A report by the National Academy of Sciences&lt;ref name=coscmat&gt;National Academy of Sciences, Committee on the Survey of Materials Science and Engineering (COSCMAT), Materials and Man's Needs: Materials Science and Engineering, Vol.III (National Academy of Sciences, Washington, D.C., 1975), pp.&amp;nbsp;7–209 - 7-210&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that these center based programs were instrumental in defining "materials science and engineering" as a new interdisciplinary activity which was evidenced by a rapid increase of materials science departments between 1960 and 1970 and beyond.  In addition, to the building of new facilities infrastructure these centers of excellence led to the training of not only materials scientists, but also physicists, chemists, engineers and other professionals.&lt;ref name=sproull&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

The National Academy study&lt;ref name=coscmat&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; noted that though the IDLs were considered a success, there was room for growth of interdisciplinary collaborations among faculty from different university departments. However, it was acknowledged that joint  block funding and joint use of shared experimental facilities by students and faculty from diverse departments had planted the seeds for increased interdisciplinarity in materials research.&lt;ref name=sproull&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

===  The Materials Research Laboratories (MRLs) 1972-1994 ===

In late 1969 an amendment to the Military Authorization Act, sponsored by Senator Mike Mansfield, placed restrictions on the funding of long-term basic research by agencies of the Department of Defense, including ARPA/DARPA.&lt;ref name=nsb70s&gt;The National Science Board: A History in Highlights 1950-2000; [https://www.nsf.gov/nsb/documents/2000/nsb00215/nsb50/1970/mansfield.html "The 1970s: The Mansfield Amendment"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nsb80s&gt;The National Science Board: A History in Highlights 1950-2000; [https://www.nsf.gov/nsb/documents/2000/nsb00215/nsb50/1980/debate.html "The 1980s: The Debate over Centers"]&lt;/ref&gt; (ARPA was changed to DARPA in 1972). Consequently, a decision was made in 1970 to transfer the IDLs to the National Science Foundation.&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The block type IDL grant for multidisciplinary research and shared facilities would mean a distinct departure of NSF's funding approach at that time which was support of predominantly small, single investigator grants in a particular discipline.   After an in-depth review by NSF of the IDL program a transfer of the then existing 12 IDLs to NSF was recommended. However, the transfer came with several major critical provisions.  These included the following:&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

"The laboratories, now renamed 'Materials Research Laboratories', would retain locally administered block (or 'core') funding intended to 'facilitate research in materials science and engineering which is either difficult or unfeasible to carry out under traditional funding of individual research.' Most importantly, the new component added by NSF was that 'scientific excellence is viewed as a necessary, but no longer sufficient, condition to qualify for MRL core support.' In addition, the MRLs would be judged by their ability to foster 'coherent, multidisciplinary and multi-investigator projects requiring the expertise of two or more materials related disciplines.' These so-called thrust groups are the heart of the current core funding at MRLs; at their best they have achieved a transformation in the way materials research is done at universities and in the way graduate education proceeds."&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Acceptance by NSF of the new materials laboratories in 1972 led to the creation of the Division of Materials Research (DMR).  Its initial portfolio consisted of the MRL program as well as individual investigator programs closely related to materials science which were drawn from other parts of NSF.  Initially, the MRL program made up approximately 40% of the DMR budget. By 1985, with the growth of individual investigator and small group programs, the MRL program was funded at a level of about 20% of the total DMR budget.&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Between 1972 and 1985, a number of additional MRLs were added and some of the existing centers were phased out.  The following table summarizes this information:&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;The National Science Foundation's Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers Program: Looking Back, Moving Forward, (The National Academies Press, 2007) [http://www.nap.edu/read/11966/chapter/1-xii "Read-only link"]&lt;/ref&gt;

MRL technical accomplishments are significant and have been detailed in a number of studies.&lt;ref name=sproull&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; J.G. Ling and M.A. Head, "Federal Funding in Materials Research," (summary of the findings of the MITRE report). Science 209, 1203 (1980); Technical Report 7764 (MITRE Corp., Bedford, Mass., Sept. 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; Another important impact has been the cultural change at U.S. universities in how research could be conducted across traditional departmental boundaries.  This trend was initiated by the IDLs but greatly strengthened by the MRL program because of the new NSF guidelines concerning requirements for interdisciplinarity.  A new generation of students would be trained in a highly collaborative and interdisciplinary environment and the experiences of the IDL/MRL programs in the fields of materials and condensed matter sciences would be the proving ground for other center type endeavors in a wide range of fields.&lt;ref name=sproull&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

===  Impact of IDLs/MRLs on other NSF Centers ===

The mid-1980s saw a convergence of a number of favorable trends for the establishments of NSF center based activities in a wide range of different fields. There was a strong interest in government investments in basic science that could be leveraged by matching funds from industry and other sources. In addition, the role of multidisciplinary teams in conducting research and educating students was widely appreciated.&lt;ref name=sproull&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The first new centers-based initiative at NSF was the creation of the [[Engineering Research Centers]] (ERCs) in 1985.  Although the role of the previous 25-year history of funding the materials laboratories in preparing universities to accept a wider role in conducting interdisciplinary research was instrumental for the creation of new types of centers, this historical connection was not widely appreciated. Both NSF and the Office of Science Technology Policy, viewed the creation of ERCs as the major new initiative in 1985 for leveraging NSF funds. The following description of the announcement of the ERC program in 1985 is illuminating:&lt;ref name=baker&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sciencegovreport1985&gt;Science and Government Report 15 (18), 4 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

"George A. Keyworth II, President's Reagan Science Advisor and Director of the [[Office of Science Technology Policy]], refers to the creation of the ERCs by the National Science Foundation as:
'the single most important thing that we've done as an Administration in increasing efficiency and effectiveness of federal R&amp;D dollars.'&lt;ref name=baker&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sciencegovreport1985&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He said the centers address a widely recognized need in various fields of science and technology: 
'Continued pushing of the frontiers in those fields was constrained by the difficulty of assembling multidisciplinary teams to work on the problems. Our universities are, justifiably and understandably, structured to pursue disciplinary research.  On the other hand, we increasingly find ourselves as a nation confronting the solving of problems that have technically based solutions. We need to expose our young people to a problem-solving environment....These Centers - I'd rather call them Science and Technology Centers - are multidisciplinary mechanism by which chemists, physicists, neurobiologists, engineers, etc, can get together and solve exciting, intellectually demanding, real-world problems.' "&lt;ref name=baker&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sciencegovreport1985&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

It was pointed out by [[William O. Baker]] that the above comments about the economic potential of the ERCs are nearly the same as those describing the original IDLs in the early 1960s.  Baker concludes that "it is refreshing indeed to find such current agreement on the concept that has involved so significant a portion of our best academic talent."&lt;ref name=baker&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The first six ERC awards were made in 1985. These awards are generally for five years with one other 5 year renewal possible for a total funding length of 10 years.&lt;ref name=ERCs&gt;Engineering Research Centers [https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5502 "National Science Foundation website"]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same year NSF made five-year awards for five supercomputing centers and made plans for the development of a program for Science and Technology Centers (STCs) that would ultimately touch all areas of NSF programs. The first 11 STCs were established in 1988.&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The 13 centers that are part of the 2013 class of STCs  cover a wide range of subjects ranging from studies of brain and intelligence to modeling of atmospheric processes to the study of quantum materials.&lt;ref name=STCs&gt;Science and Technology Centers [https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/programs/stc/active_centers/ACTIVE.jsp "National Science Foundation website"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of concerns about the impact on center funding on individual investigator awards the [[National Science Board]] required that center awards cannot be renewed without  open recompetition.&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Since the establishment of ERCs and STCs a large number of other centers have been established across all major NSF disciplines and now represent an essential element of the NSF funding portfolio.&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Establishment of MRSECs (1994 - 1996) ===

As can be seen from Table 1 the majority of MRLs were started between 1972 and 1984 with only a few later additions.  The MRL competition of 1992 led to the start of only one new center: the MRL at the University of California Santa Barbara. The lack of new awards, coupled with the National Science Board re-competition requirement, provided one impetus for the development of the NSF Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers (MRSEC) program. Previously, MRLs, once funded, could be continually supported without a need to compete against other center candidates. The MRSEC program limits awards to a fixed time period, currently six years.  Additional support is possible, but only on the basis of a new proposal that competes nationally against all other applicants.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The transition from the MRL to the MRSEC programs occurred through two competitions held in 1993/4 and 1995/96, respectively.  The competitions were open to all US academic institutions, including those with then current MRL awards. Institutions with awards made under the Materials Research Group (MRG) program, which was initiated at NSF in 1984, were eligible to participate in the competition. All MRL and MRG awards were discontinued after 1996. In all, 10 MRLs and 17 MRGs participated in the competitions of 1994-96. As seen in Table 2, nine of the MRLs were successful in transitioning to MRSECs, and six MRSEC awards went to institutions with prior MRG awards.  Importantly, new MRSEC awards were made to six institutions that never had any substantial NSF center or large group support in materials research.&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

TABLE 2 Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers established after open competitions in 1994 and 1996. Those institutions with existing Materials Research Laboratories (MRLs) or Materials Research Groups (MRGs) in 1994 or 1996 are indicated, while "new" refers to institutions that did not have a current MRL or MRG award.  The MRL and MRG programs were discontinued after 1996.&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent MRSEC competitions were held every two years (with a four-year award cycle) and, every three years starting in 2002 (with a six-year award cycle). The required open competition for any center that wishes to be supported for more than the initial six-year award period is consistent with the re-competition requirements set by the National Science Board.&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== National Academy Study of MRSEC program (2007) ==

An assessment of the MRSEC program was published by the National Academy of Sciences in 2007.&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Executive Summary summarizes the impact of the program:

"MRSEC awards continue to be in great demand. The intense competition for them within the community indicates a strong perceived value."&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The report lists a number of key areas where the MRSEC program has an impact, including providing the resources and environment that fosters:&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* interdisciplinary, collaborative research;
* interdisciplinary training for the future scientific and technical workforce; 
* rapid response to new ideas, including support for higher-risk projects, than is possible with single-investigator  grants;	
* increased  institutional, local, and/or state support for materials research; 
* attraction of  high quality students and junior faculty;
* development of infrastructure helpful for organizing and managing experimental and computational facilities and educational and industrial outreach.

Among the report's recommendations are an increase in the grant size of the centers, which would allow adequate resources for education and outreach, while ensuring that the support for research activities is not compromised.  Recent MRSEC competitions&lt;ref name=nsfpress2010&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nsfpress2015&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; have responded to the recommendations by increasing award sizes, notably by requiring that each new award will support a minimum of two interdisciplinary research groups (IRGs). In addition, the NAS study recommends strengthening the cooperative aspects of MRSECs and continue the progress made in the past toward building a national cooperating network of centers.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The report concludes that such a network, once fully established, would  "strengthen materials science and engineering in the United States as a discipline and as a factor in U.S. competitiveness."&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neo-expressionism''' is a style of [[Late Modernism|late modernist]] or early-[[Postmodern art|postmodern]] painting and sculpture that emerged in the late 1970s. Neo-expressionists were sometimes called ''[[Transavantgarde]]'', ''[[Junge Wilde]]'' or ''Neue Wilden'' ('The new wild ones'; 'New Fauves' would better meet the meaning of the term). It is characterized by intense subjectivity and rough handling of materials.&lt;ref&gt;Chilvers, Ian and John Glaves-Smith. ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art''. Oxford University Press (2009), p. 503&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-expressionism developed as a reaction against [[conceptual art]] and [[minimal art]] of the 1970s. Neo-expressionists returned to portraying recognizable objects, such as the human body (although sometimes in an [[abstract art|abstract]] manner), in a rough and violently emotional way, often using vivid colors. It was overtly inspired by [[German Expressionist]] painters, such as [[Emil Nolde]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[George Grosz]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[James Ensor]] and [[Edvard Munch]]. It is also related to American [[Lyrical Abstraction]] painting of the 1960s and 1970s, [[The Hairy Who]] movement in Chicago, the [[Bay Area Figurative School]] of the 1950s and 1960s, the continuation of [[Abstract Expressionism]], New Image Painting and precedents in [[Pop art|Pop Painting]].&lt;ref&gt;Chilvers, Ian and John Glaves-Smith. ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art''. Oxford University Press (2009), p. 503-504&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==

Neo-expressionism dominated the art market until the mid-1980s. The style emerged internationally and was viewed by many  critics, such as [[Achille Bonito Oliva]] and [[Donald Kuspit]], as a revival of traditional themes of self-expression in European art after decades of American dominance. The social and economic value of the movement was hotly debated.

Critics such as [[Benjamin Buchloh]], [[Hal Foster (art critic)|Hal Foster]], [[Craig Owens (critic)|Craig Owens]], and [[Mira Schor]] were highly critical of its relation to the marketability of painting on the rapidly expanding art market, celebrity, the [[anti-feminism|backlash against feminism]], [[anti-intellectualism]], and a return to mythic subjects and individualist methods they deemed outmoded. Women were notoriously marginalized in the movement, and painters such as [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]] and [[Maria Lassnig]] were omitted from many of its key exhibitions, most notoriously the 1981 "New Spirit in Painting" exhibition in London which included 38 male painters but no female painters.

"'''Nightfall'''" is a 1941 science fiction [[Short story|novelette]] by American writer [[Isaac Asimov]] about the coming of darkness to the people of a planet ordinarily illuminated by sunlight at all times. It was adapted into a novel with [[Robert Silverberg]] in 1990. The short story has been included in 48 anthologies, and has appeared in six collections of Asimov's stories.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} In 1968, the [[Science Fiction Writers of America]] voted "Nightfall" the best science fiction short story written prior to the 1965 establishment of the [[Nebula Awards]], and included it in ''[[The Science Fiction Hall of Fame Volume One, 1929-1964]]''.

==Background==
Written from 17 March to 9 April 1941 and sold on 24 April, the short story was published in the September 1941 issue of ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' under editor [[John&amp;nbsp;W. Campbell]]. It was the 32nd story by Asimov, written while he was a graduate student in chemistry at [[Columbia University]]. Campbell asked Asimov to write the story after discussing with him a quotation from [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]:&lt;ref name="earlyyears335_339"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/334/mode/2up |title=The early Asimov; or, Eleven years of trying |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1972 |publisher=Doubleday |year=1972 |location=Garden City NY |pages=335-339}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|If the stars should appear one night in a thousand years, how would men believe and adore, and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of God!}}
Campbell's opinion was to the contrary: "I think men would go mad". He and Asimov chose the title "Nightfall" together. At more than 13,000 words it was Asimov's longest story yet, and including a bonus from Campbell he received $166 (1 1/4 cents per word), more than twice any previous payment for a story. His name appeared on the cover of ''Astounding'' for the first time, and the story made Asimov—who later said that before "Nightfall" neither he nor anyone else other than perhaps Campbell considered him more than a "third rater"—one of the industry's top writers.{{r|earlyyears335_339}} Asimov believed that the unusual plot of "Nightfall" distinguished it from others, but "[[The Last Question]]" was his own favorite story.&lt;ref name="asimov1973"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Best of Isaac Asimov |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Sphere Books |year=1973 |isbn=0-385-05078-X |pages=ix-xiv |chapter=Introduction |lccn=74-2863 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/bestofisaacasimo00asim#page/n11/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, [[Martin H. Greenberg]] suggested Asimov find someone who would take his 47-year-old short story and – keeping the story essentially as written – add a detailed beginning and a detailed ending to it. This resulted in the 1990 publication of the novel ''Nightfall'' by Isaac Asimov and [[Robert Silverberg]]. As Asimov relates in the Robert Silverberg chapter of his autobiography, "...Eventually, I received the extended ''Nightfall'' manuscript from Bob [Silverberg]... Bob did a wonderful job and I could almost believe I had written the whole thing myself. He remained absolutely faithful to the original story and I had very little to argue with."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Plot summary==
The planet Lagash ("Kalgash" in the novel) is constantly illuminated by at least one of the six suns of its [[multiple star system]]. Lagash has areas of darkness (in caves, tunnels, etc.), but "night" does not exist.

A skeptical journalist visits a university [[observatory]] to interview a group of scientists who warn that civilization will soon end. One of the researchers explains that they have discovered evidence of numerous ancient civilizations on Lagash, all destroyed by fire, with [[Social cycle theory|each collapse]] occurring about 2,000 years apart. The religious writings of a [[doomsday cult]] claim that Lagash periodically passes through a dark cave where mysterious "[[star]]s" appear. The stars are said to rain down fire from the heavens and rob people of their souls, reducing them to beast-like savages.

The scientists use this apparent myth, along with recent discoveries in gravitational research, to develop a theory about the repeated collapse of society. A [[Orbital perturbation analysis|mathematical analysis of Lagash's orbit]] around its primary sun reveals irregularities caused by an undiscovered [[Natural satellite|moon]] that is invisible in the light of the six suns. Calculations indicate that this moon will soon obscure one of Lagash's suns when it is alone in the sky, resulting in a total [[eclipse]] that occurs once every 2,000 years. Having evolved on a planet with no [[diurnal cycle]], Lagashians possess an intense, instinctive [[fear of the dark]] and have never experienced a long period of total darkness, but the eclipse will last for "well over half a day".

The scientists theorize that earlier civilizations were destroyed by people who became insane during previous eclipses and—desperate for any light source—started large fires that destroyed cities. Oral accounts of the chaos from crazed survivors and small children were passed down through the ages and became the basis for the cult's sacred texts. Present-day civilization is doomed for the same reasons, but the researchers hope that detailed observations of the eclipse will help to break the cycle of [[societal collapse]].

The scientists are unprepared, however, for the stars. Because of the perpetual daylight on Lagash, its inhabitants are unaware of the existence of stars apart from their own; astronomers believe that the entire universe is no more than a few [[light year]]s in diameter and may hypothetically contain a small number of other suns. But Lagash is located in the center of a "[[Globular cluster|giant cluster]]," and during the eclipse, the night sky—the first that people have ever seen—is filled with more than 30,000 newly visible stars.

Learning that the universe is far more vast—and Lagash far more insignificant—than they believed causes everyone, including the scientists, to become insane. Outside the observatory, in the direction of the city, the horizon begins glowing with the light of spreading fires as "the long night" returns to Lagash.

==Setting==
The system of Kalgash has six stars named Alpha, Beta, etc. in the original short story, whereas each has a proper name in the novel. In the novel, Onos is the primary sun of Kalgash and is located 10 [[light-minute]]s away, similar to the distance from Earth to our Sun. The other five suns are minor in comparison, but provide enough light to prevent the inhabitants of Kalgash from defining "night". The only other distance given is that Tano and Sitha form a [[Binary system (astronomy)|binary star system]] about 11 times as far away as Onos.

* Onos – [[G-type main-sequence star|yellow dwarf]] – similar to the Sun
* Dovim – [[red dwarf]]
* Trey and Patru – [[Stellar classification|class A or F main sequence stars]], described as "white" – binary star system
* Tano and Sitha – class A, B, or O main sequence stars, described as "blue" – binary star system

From what can be drawn from the text, Onos, the star appearing brightest and largest in Kalgash's sky, is the star that Kalgash orbits. Onos, in turn, orbits around the [[Binary system (astronomy)|binary system]] Trey and Patru, the other binary system Tano and Sitha, and the red dwarf star Dovim. In addition to these stars, the only other celestial object mentioned is Kalgash's moon, dubbed Kalgash Two by the scientists of Kalgash. Kalgash Two follows an [[Eccentricity (orbit)|eccentric]] orbit around Kalgash and every 2049 years it eclipses Dovim, during a period when from one part of Kalgash, Dovim is the only star that would be visible.

The characters of ''Nightfall'' travel to three separate locations on Kalgash. Most of the book is set in Saro City, which is situated near a large forest with trees, bushes, and graben (scavenger animals). As stated in the introduction, the weather in the book is analogous to the meteorologic experiences of the characters in the book, and the region of Saro City receives rains that last several days. The first major weather fluctuation mentioned in the book is the sandstorm that Siferra 89 avoided by hiding under a [[tarpaulin]] with her crew. The other weather event was the [[monsoon]]-like rains that occurred after Sheerin 501 returned from a consultation in Jonglor, which is described as a northern city. Siferra 89 travels to Beklimot, which is described as half a world away from Jonglor. Beklimot is located on the Sagikan Peninsula, near mountains. Beklimot is in a sandy, arid desert region.

==Adaptations in other media==
In the 1950s, the story was adapted for radio programs ''[[Dimension X (radio program)|Dimension X]]'' and ''[[X Minus One]]''.

In 1976, Analog Records, as their only release, presented a further dramatization of "Nightfall" on a {{frac|33|1|3}} rpm vinyl record, produced by James Cutting and recorded at American Learning Center. After the story, it includes a dialog between Isaac Asimov and [[Ben Bova]].

In 1988, ''[[Nightfall (1988 film)|Nightfall]]'', a low-budget movie, was produced based upon the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0095738|Nightfall|(1988)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie was shot on location at the [[Arcosanti|Arcosanti Project]], using the resident community members as background actors. Another film version, ''[[Nightfall (2000 film)|Nightfall]]'', was made in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0249840|Nightfall|(2000)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007, the story was the 100th episode of ''[[Escape Pod (podcast)|Escape Pod]]'', a science-fiction [[podcast]].

The '''Oceanographic Institute of the University of São Paulo''' ({{lang-pt|Instituto Oceanográfico da Universidade de São Paulo}}, '''IO-USP'''), due to its name in Portuguese, was founded in 1946. It began as an independent institute, sponsored by the government, but was later incorporated into the [[University of São Paulo]], in 1951. It founded because its creators needed scientific basis to [[fishery]] and exploitation of all the available [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[natural resource|resources]] along the [[Brazil]]ian [[coast]], especially in the state of [[São Paulo]].

IO-USP was transformed into a University Unit in 1972, and started to offer post-graduate Masters courses in biological and [[physical oceanography]] in 1973. It offers an undergraduate course as well, and performs many different researches. Now, the institute has two departments - [[Biological Oceanography]] and Physical, Chemical and Geological Oceanography. The institute has 34 teachers and around 150 general non-teaching workers.

Its current director is [[Michel Michaelovitch de Mahiques]].

== Research vessels ==
[[Image:Profwbesnard.jpg|right|thumb|210px|The W. Besnard Oceanographic Ship out in the ocean.]]
The institution has the support of three major vessels - the W. Besnard Oceanographic Ship, as well as the Albacora and the Veliger, used mostly by the graduation students in their field research.

== Research bases ==

The institute has two research bases - Dr. João de Paiva Carvalho base, in the estuarine city of [[Cananéia]], and the Clarimundo de Jesus base, in the coastal city of [[Ubatuba]]. Both are equipped with advanced laboratories and sufficient research vessels, with the fundamental support of the main vessel, the W. Besnard Oceanographip Ship.

Anatomically, the petrolingual ligament demarcates two of the segments of the internal carotid artery:

In [[continuum mechanics]], a material is said to be under '''plane stress''' if the [[stress (mechanics)|stress vector]] is zero across a particular surface.  When that situation occurs over an entire element of a structure, as is often the case for thin plates, the [[stress analysis]] is considerably simplified, as the stress state can be represented by a [[tensor]] of dimension 2 (representable as a 2 × 2 matrix rather than 3 × 3). &lt;ref name=Meyers/&gt; A related notion, [[plane strain]], is often applicable to very thick members.

Plane stress typically occurs in thin flat plates that are acted upon only by load forces that are parallel to them.  In certain situations, a gently curved thin plate may also be assumed to have plane stress for the purpose of stress analysis. This is the case, for example, of a thin-walled cylinder filled with a fluid under pressure.  In such cases, stress components perpendicular to the plate are negligible compared to those parallel to it.&lt;ref name=Meyers/&gt;

In other situations, however, the bending stress of a thin plate cannot be neglected. One can still simplify the analysis by using a two-dimensional domain, but the plane stress tensor at each point must be complemented with bending terms.

==Mathematical definition==

Mathematically, the stress at some point in the material is a plane stress if one of the three [[principal stress]]es (the [[eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalues]] of the [[Cauchy stress tensor]]) is zero.  That is, there is [[Cartesian coordinate system]] in which the stress tensor has the form  
: &lt;math&gt;\sigma = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{11} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \sigma_{22} &amp; 0 \\
0      &amp;     0       &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix} 
\equiv 
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{x} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \sigma_{y} &amp; 0 \\
0      &amp;     0       &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
 
For example, consider a rectangular block of material measuring 10, 40 and 5 [[centimetre|cm]] along the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, that is being stretched in the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; direction and compressed in the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; direction, by pairs of opposite forces with magnitudes 10 [[newton (unit)|N]] and 20 N, respectively, uniformly distributed over the corresponding faces.  The stress tensor inside the block will be

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma = 
\begin{bmatrix}
500\mathrm{ Pa} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; -4000\mathrm{ Pa} &amp; 0 \\
0      &amp;     0       &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, if one chooses the first two coordinate axes arbitrarily but perpendicular to the direction of zero stress, the stress tensor will have the form
: &lt;math&gt;\sigma = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{11} &amp; \sigma_{12} &amp; 0 \\
\sigma_{21} &amp; \sigma_{22} &amp; 0 \\
0      &amp;     0       &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix} 
\equiv 
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{x} &amp; \tau_{xy} &amp; 0 \\
\tau_{yx} &amp; \sigma_{y} &amp; 0 \\
0      &amp;     0       &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
and can therefore be represented by a 2 × 2 matrix,
: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{11} &amp; \sigma_{12} \\
\sigma_{21} &amp; \sigma_{22}
\end{bmatrix} 
\equiv 
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{x} &amp; \tau_{xy} \\
\tau_{yx} &amp; \sigma_{y}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

== Constitutive equations ==
:''See [[Hooke's law#Plane_stress]]''

==Plane stress in curved surfaces ==
In certain cases, the plane stress model can be used in the analysis of gently curved surfaces. For example,
consider a thin-walled cylinder subjected to an axial compressive load uniformly distributed along its rim, and filled with a pressurized fluid.  The internal pressure will generate a reactive [[hoop stress]] on the wall, a normal tensile stress directed perpendicular to the cylinder axis and tangential to its surface.  The cylinder can be conceptually unrolled and analyzed as a flat thin rectangular plate subjected to tensile load in one direction and compressive load in another other direction, both parallel to the  plate.

==Plane strain (strain matrix)==
[[File:Plane strain.svg|600px|right|thumb|Figure 7.2 Plane strain state in a continuum.]]
{{main|Infinitesimal strain theory}}
If one dimension is very large compared to the others, the [[Strain (materials science)|principal strain]] in the direction of the longest dimension is constrained and can be assumed as zero, yielding a plane strain condition (Figure 7.2).  In this case, though all principal stresses are non-zero, the principal stress in the direction of the longest dimension can be disregarded for calculations. Thus, allowing a two dimensional analysis of stresses, e.g. a [[dam]] analyzed at a cross section loaded by the reservoir.
{{Clear}}


The corresponding strain tensor is:

: &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ij} = \begin{bmatrix}
\varepsilon_{11} &amp; \varepsilon_{12} &amp; 0 \\
\varepsilon_{21} &amp; \varepsilon_{22} &amp; 0 \\
0      &amp;     0       &amp; \varepsilon_{33}\end{bmatrix}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

in which the non-zero &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{33}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; term arises from the [[Poisson's ratio|Poisson's effect]]. This strain term can be temporarily removed from the stress analysis to leave only the in-plane terms, effectively reducing the analysis to two dimensions.&lt;ref name=Meyers/&gt;
{{Clear}}

==Stress transformation in plane stress and plane strain==
Consider a point &lt;math&gt;P\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in a continuum under a state of plane stress, or plane strain, with stress components &lt;math&gt;(\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \tau_{xy})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and all other stress components equal to zero  (Figure 8.1). From static equilibrium of an infinitesimal material element at &lt;math&gt;P\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (Figure 8.2), the normal stress &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and the shear stress &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; on any plane perpendicular to the &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;y\,\!&lt;/math&gt; plane passing through &lt;math&gt;P\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with a unit vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; making an angle of &lt;math&gt;\theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with the horizontal, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\cos \theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the direction cosine in the &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; direction, is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{n} = \frac{1}{2} ( \sigma_x + \sigma_y ) + \frac{1}{2} ( \sigma_x - \sigma_y )\cos 2\theta + \tau_{xy} \sin 2\theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{n} = -\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_x - \sigma_y )\sin 2\theta + \tau_{xy}\cos 2\theta \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

These equations indicate that in a plane stress or plane strain condition, one can determine the stress components at a point on all directions, i.e. as a function of &lt;math&gt;\theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, if one knows the stress components &lt;math&gt;(\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \tau_{xy})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; on any two perpendicular directions at that point. It is important to remember that we are considering a unit area of the infinitesimal element in the direction parallel to the &lt;math&gt;y\,\!&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;z\,\!&lt;/math&gt; plane.
[[File:Stress transformation 2D.svg|460px|left|thumb|Figure 8.1 - Stress transformation at a point in a continuum under plane stress conditions.]]
[[File:Stress at a plane 2D.svg|200px|none|thumb|Figure 8.2 - Stress components at a plane passing through a point in a continuum under plane stress conditions.]]

The principal directions (Figure 8.3), i.e., orientation of the planes where the shear stress components are zero, can be obtained by making the previous equation for the shear stress &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; equal to zero. Thus we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{n} = -\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_x - \sigma_y )\sin 2\theta + \tau_{xy}\cos 2\theta=0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

and we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;\tan 2 \theta_\mathrm{p} = \frac{2 \tau_{xy}}{\sigma_x - \sigma_y}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This equation defines two values &lt;math&gt;\theta_\mathrm{p}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; which are &lt;math&gt;90^\circ\,\!&lt;/math&gt; apart (Figure 8.3). The same result can be obtained by finding the angle &lt;math&gt;\theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt; which makes the normal stress &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; a maximum, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\sigma_\mathrm{n}}{d\theta}=0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The principal stresses &lt;math&gt;\sigma_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, or minimum and maximum normal stresses &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{max}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{min}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, can then be obtained by replacing both values of &lt;math&gt;\theta_\mathrm{p}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; into the previous equation for &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. This can be achieved by rearranging the equations for &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, first transposing the first term in the first equation and squaring both sides of each of the equations then adding them. Thus we have

:&lt;math&gt;
\left[ \sigma_\mathrm{n} - \tfrac{1}{2} ( \sigma_x + \sigma_y )\right]^2 + \tau_\mathrm{n}^2 = \left[\tfrac{1}{2}(\sigma_x - \sigma_y)\right]^2 + \tau_{xy}^2 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
(\sigma_\mathrm{n} - \sigma_\mathrm{avg})^2 + \tau_\mathrm{n}^2 = R^2  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;R = \sqrt{\left[\tfrac{1}{2}(\sigma_x - \sigma_y)\right]^2 + \tau_{xy}^2} \quad \text{and} \quad \sigma_\mathrm{avg} = \tfrac{1}{2} ( \sigma_x + \sigma_y )\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

which is the equation of a circle of radius &lt;math&gt;R\,\!&lt;/math&gt; centered at a point with coordinates &lt;math&gt;[\sigma_\mathrm{avg}, 0]\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, called [[Mohr's circle]]. But knowing that for the principal stresses the shear stress &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{n} = 0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, then we obtain from this equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_1 =\sigma_\mathrm{max} = \tfrac{1}{2}(\sigma_x + \sigma_y) + \sqrt{\left[\tfrac{1}{2}(\sigma_x - \sigma_y)\right]^2 + \tau_{xy}^2}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_2 =\sigma_\mathrm{min} = \tfrac{1}{2}(\sigma_x + \sigma_y) - \sqrt{\left[\tfrac{1}{2}(\sigma_x - \sigma_y)\right]^2 + \tau_{xy}^2}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Principal stresses 2D.svg|400px|left|thumb|Figure 8.3 - Transformation of stresses in two dimensions, showing the planes of action of principal stresses, and maximum and minimum shear stresses.]]
{{Clear}}
When &lt;math&gt;\tau_{xy}=0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; the infinitesimal element is oriented in the direction of the principal planes, thus the stresses acting on the rectangular element are principal stresses: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x = \sigma_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_y = \sigma_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. Then the normal stress &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and shear stress &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as a function of the principal stresses can be determined by making &lt;math&gt;\tau_{xy}=0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we have

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{n} = \frac{1}{2} ( \sigma_1 + \sigma_2 ) + \frac{1}{2} ( \sigma_1 - \sigma_2 )\cos 2\theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{n} = -\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_1 - \sigma_2 )\sin 2\theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Then the maximum shear stress &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{max}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; occurs when  &lt;math&gt;\sin 2\theta = 1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\theta = 45^\circ\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (Figure 8.3):

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{max} = \frac{1}{2}(\sigma_1 - \sigma_2 )\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Then the minimum shear stress &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{min}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; occurs when  &lt;math&gt;\sin 2\theta = -1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\theta = 135^\circ\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (Figure 8.3):

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{min} = -\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_1 - \sigma_2 )\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

'''Pressure retarded osmosis''' ('''PRO''') is a technique to separate a solvent (for example, [[fresh water]]) from a solution that is more concentrated (e.g. [[sea water]]) and also pressurized. A [[semipermeable membrane]] allows the solvent to pass to the concentrated solution side by [[osmosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037673881300865X | doi=10.1016/j.memsci.2013.10.053 | volume=453 | title=Osmotic power with Pressure Retarded Osmosis: Theory, performance and trends – A review | year=2014 | journal=Journal of Membrane Science | pages=337–358 | author=Helfer Fernanda, Lemckert Charles, Anissimov Yuri G}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique can be used to generate power from the [[salinity gradient]] energy resulting from the difference in the salt concentration between sea and river water.
In PRO, the [[water potential]] between [[fresh water]] and sea water corresponds to a pressure of 26 [[Bar (unit)|bar]]s. This pressure is equivalent to a column of water ([[hydraulic head]]) 270 meters high.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statkraft.com/energy-sources/osmotic-power/default.aspx How does it work?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128105625/http://www.statkraft.com/energy-sources/osmotic-power/default.aspx |date=2009-11-28 }} - [[Statkraft]]&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the optimal working pressure is  only half of this, 11 to 15 bar.

== History ==

This method of generating power was invented by [[Sidney Loeb|Prof. Sidney Loeb]] in 1973 at the [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]], [[Beersheba]], Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Patent Application 42658. (July 3, 1973) [http://www.google.com/patents/US3906250 United States patent 3906250]. (Erroneously shows Israel priority as 1974 instead of 1973).
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 researchers verified that 95% of a PRO system's theoretical power output can be produced with a membrane that is half (or less) the size needed for achieving 100%. Output is proportional to the salinity. Desalination yields very salty brine, while treated municipal wastewater has relatively little salt. Combining those streams could produce energy to power both facilities. However, powering an existing wastewater treatment plant by mixing treated wastewater with seawater could require a membrane area of 2.5 million square meters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://online.wsj.com/articles/a-new-kind-of-power-from-salt-water-1409337076]&lt;/ref&gt;

To deal with these membrane requirements, scientists are working on rolled membranes &lt;ref&gt;"A New Kind of Power from Salt Water" Wall St. Journal, August 29–31, 2014 [https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-new-kind-of-power-from-salt-water-1409337076]&lt;/ref&gt; that will take up much less space.

== Testing ==

The world's first osmotic plant with capacity of 10&amp;nbsp;kW was opened by [[Statkraft]] on 24 November 2009 in [[Tofte, Norway|Tofte]], Norway.&lt;ref name=reuters241109&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1132">In [[zoology]], the '''Principle of Homonymy''' is one of the guiding principles of the ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]''.

It states that any one name, in one particular spelling, may be used only once (within its group). This will be the first-published name; any later name with the same spelling (a [[homonym (zoology)|homonym]]) is barred from being used. The Principles of [[Principle of Priority|Priority]] and [[Principle of the First Reviser|the First Reviser]] apply here. For family-group names the termination (which is rank-bound) is not taken into account.

::In 1777 [[Johann Reinhold Forster]] published the name ''Echidna'' for a genus of [[moray eel]]s. This meant that when [[Georges Cuvier]] proposed to use this name ''Echidna'' in 1797 for the [[echidna|spiny anteater]] he created a junior homonym. Later, in 1811, [[Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger]] published the name ''Tachyglossus'', as a replacement name, or ''[[nomen novum]]'', and this is considered to be the [[valid name (zoology)|valid name]] for the spiny anteater.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5727">A '''rainbow party''' is a supposed [[group sex]] event featured in an [[urban legend]] spread since the early 2000s. A variant of other [[sex party (group sex)|sex party]] urban myths, the stories claim that at these events, allegedly increasingly popular among adolescents, females wearing various shades of [[lipstick]] take turns [[fellatio|fellating]] males in sequence, leaving multiple colors (a "[[rainbow]]") on their penises.&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;{{cite news| author=Lewin, Tamar| date=2005-06-30| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/30/fashion/thursdaystyles/30rainbow.html| title=Are These Parties for Real| publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=2009-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The idea was publicized on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' in 2003, and became the subject of a juvenile novel called ''Rainbow Party''.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; Sex researchers and adolescent health care professionals have found no evidence for the existence of rainbow parties, and consequently attribute the spread of the stories to a [[moral panic]].&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; On May 27, 2010 the television program ''[[The Doctors (2008 TV series)|The Doctors]]'' discussed the topic with dozens of teens, parents, and professionals.

==Origin==
The story was originally related by American [[pediatrician]] Meg Meeker in her 2002 book ''Epidemic: How Teen Sex Is Killing Our Kids''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Meeker, Meg | title=Epidemic: How Teen Sex Is Killing Our Kids | publisher = Lifeline Press | date = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-89526-143-4 | url = https://archive.org/details/epidemichowteens00meek }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book related case stories of adolescents suffering cancer, sterility, acute infections, and unwanted pregnancies as a consequence of starting sexual activity too early in life.  Meeker relates the following story from a 14-year-old patient from Michigan:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Allyson] had heard some kids were going to have a "rainbow party," but had no idea what that meant.  Still, she thought it might be fun, and arranged to attend with a friend.  After she arrived, several girls (all in the eighth grade) were given different shades of lipstick and told to perform oral sex on different boys to give them "rainbows."  Once she realized what was happening, Allyson was too stunned and frightened to do anything.  When a girl gave her some lipstick, she refused at first but, with repeated pressure, finally gave in.  "It was one of the grossest things I've ever done."&lt;ref&gt;Meeker, p22-23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==On ''The Oprah Winfrey Show''==
The idea of the rainbow party was publicized in October 2003 on the episode of ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' titled "Is Your Child Leading a Double Life?", which was about the trend of increasing sexual [[promiscuity]] among American youth and the lack of parental awareness of the sexual practices of their children. In the ''[[O: The Oprah Magazine|O Magazine]]'' Michelle Burford asserted, among other things, that many teens across the United States engaged in rainbow parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Trystan T. Cotten, Kimberly Springer eds.| title=Stories of Oprah: the Oprahfication of American culture | isbn=978-1-60473-407-2 | publisher=University Press of Mississippi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book==
''Rainbow Party'' is a [[novel]] commissioned by a [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] editor.&lt;ref name=Memmott&gt;{{cite news| newspaper=USA Today | date= 2005-05-22 | title= Controversy colors teen book | last1= Memmott | first1=Carol| url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2005-05-22-rainbow-usat_x.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author is [[Paul Ruditis]]. The book, which ''[[Library Journal]]'' declined to review, is about teens who fantasize about having a rainbow party.

The book has proven controversial, as it was meant for teenagers (recommended by the publisher for ages 14 and up), thus raising questions about its propriety. In turn, concerns were raised that excluding the book from bookstores and libraries would amount to censorship. The publishers justified ''Rainbow Party'' on the grounds that it was a cautionary tale intended to teach readers that oral sex can be dangerous.&lt;ref name=Memmott /&gt;

==Legend==
[[Deborah Tolman]], director of the [[Center for Research on Gender and Sexuality]] at [[San Francisco State University]], writes:  "This 'phenomenon' has all the classic hallmarks of a [[moral panic]]. One day we have never heard of rainbow parties and then suddenly they are everywhere, feeding on adults' fears that morally-bankrupt sexuality among teens is rampant, despite any actual evidence, as well as evidence to the contrary." Tolman finds that several features of the story ring false. She was skeptical that many adolescent girls would be motivated to engage in such activity in the face of the severe social stigma still attached to sexual activity, and rejected the idea that adolescent boys would examine each other's lipstick marks. However, the urban legend was widespread; an informal survey taken by ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2005 found that most teenagers between the ages of 13 and 16 were familiar with the rumor.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;

Canadian parenting coach Lisa Bunnage claimed in a 2014 TEDxSFU talk that such parties were taking place. She claimed that despite rainbow parties being described by Wikipedia as an urban legend, they were an ongoing issue.&lt;ref&gt;Bunnage, Lisa. 2014. "TED Talk at SFU." ''YouTube''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1755">In [[geology]], '''range offset''' is the time difference between the last fossil occurrence of a [[taxon]] and the actual disappearance of this taxon. Range offset can be used as a measure of [[Biostratigraphy|biostratigraphic]] precision&lt;ref name="patzkowskyholland94" /&gt; and determines among others how much information about extinctions can be derived from fossil occurrences.

== Definition ==
The range offset of a taxon is defined as&lt;ref name="Holland2000" /&gt; 
* the time span between the moment in which the highest stratigraphic occurrence of said taxon was deposited and the moment in which the taxon disappeared from the locality or area and/or
* the time span between the moment the taxon appears for the first time in the locality or area and the moment in which the lowest stratigraphic occurrence of said taxon was deposited.

== Effects of sequence stratigraphy ==
Range offset is strongly affected by [[sequence stratigraphy]]. Simulations show that range offset changes by up to three [[orders of magnitude]] dependent on the position in the [[systems tract]]s.&lt;ref name="Holland2000" /&gt;

In cooperation with the Technion Lorry I. Lokey Center for Life Science and Engineering, RBNI has invested in equipment facilitating advanced mechanical characterization and manipulation of tissue and tissue scaffolds, and bio-rheology.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===Special instrumentation===
The institute has a top-of-the-line Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) (0.07&amp;nbsp;nm resolution), an additional TEM, Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM) and advanced facilities for sample preparation including the Dual Focused Ion Beam.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} There is now also a  new cryo TEM and a new high resolution cryo SEM. A UHV Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM), Near Field Scanning Optical Microscope (NSOM), and Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOFSIMS) are now also available.

Colloidal and molecular characterization equipment has been grouped under one roof and supplemented with small angle X-ray scattering and X-ray diffraction capabilities, as well as spectroscopy capabilities in solution.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

A cluster supercomputer has been installed facilitating parallel computation, and services researchers from several faculties.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}{{when|date=November 2015}}

==Graduate program==
The ''''Norman Seiden Multidisciplinary Graduate Program in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology''' was launched in October 2005 and expanded in October 2006 to include a [[PhD]] program.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The science involving nanometric systems and the technology derived from them involves the convergence of know-how from numerous fields. The Program offers a core curriculum exposing students to the varied fields of nano science and endows them with the necessary knowledge in the [[life sciences]] (Biology and Medicine), the [[exact sciences]] (Chemistry and Physics), and [[engineering]] (Electrical, Materials, Chemical, Mechanical, Biomedical, Biotechnology and more).

The students are exposed to a broad curriculum covering topics from life sciences, physical sciences, and engineering and the individual curriculum reflects the student’s individual background. The broad education requires five semesters for [[MSc]] compared with the usual four, with the first two semesters mostly devoted to filling gaps in the required background. In 2010, RBNI added its international graduate program in nano science and technology.

==Winter schools==
RBNI winter schools in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology attract participants from around the world.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Following the success of the 2008 winter school, the second winter school was held in February 2010 in Ein Gedi near the Dead Sea. Both were organized by a dedicated committee of 15  lecturers, and approximately 140 graduate students from Technion and other Israeli academic institutions.

==Ties with industry==
Strengthening contacts with Israeli industry is a stated RBNI priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rbni.technion.ac.il/?cmd=industry.173 |title=Israel Nano Industry - Links |publisher=Rbni.technion.ac.il |date= |accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dozens of meetings with firms have taken place over the past 5 years, including open days with companies such as [[Intel]], [[IBM]], [[Elbit]], Israel Aircraft Industry (IAI), Applied Materials, and more.

The investment in capital equipment  at the institute has served approximately 120 research groups from industry that used this equipment over the past 5 years. Approximately 110 cooperative projects with industry were launched via programs  such as Magneton, Nofar, participation in MAGNET consortia, participation in defense projects and more. RBNI has filed more than 104 patent applications.

==Outreach==
In cooperation with the Technion Youth Activity section, the institute initiated a nano education program for junior and high-school students in Israel. As part of this program an “Introduction to Nano” lecture was developed and introduced to youth from different schools in Israel visiting the Technion Youth activity section. An additional lecture was developed in 2008 on routes to new, denser information storage strategies.

The "nano bible" &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/12/071220222917.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427104935/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/12/071220222917.htm |date=April 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; created at the Russell Berrie Nanotechnology Institute was originally produced to demonstrate the current miniaturization capabilities as part of the effort to attract high school students to science and technology. It was later given by Israel President Shimon Peres to Pope Benedict XVI, on his visit to Jerusalem.  RBNI is one of the first Israeli research institutes to create an active presence in the social media, on Facebook&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/Technion-RBNI/181843988500877 |title=Technion RBNI |publisher=Facebook.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Twitter.

'''Seismic''' or '''vibrational communication''' is a process of conveying [[information]] through mechanical ([[seismology|seismic]]) [[vibration]]s of the substrate. The substrate may be the earth, a plant stem or leaf, the surface of a body of water, a spider’s web, a honeycomb, or any of the myriad types of soil substrates. Seismic cues are generally conveyed by surface [[Rayleigh waves|Rayleigh]] or [[bending wave]]s generated through vibrations on the substrate, or acoustical waves that couple with the substrate. Vibrational communication is an ancient sensory modality and it is widespread in the animal kingdom where it has evolved several times independently. It has been reported in mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, insects, arachnids, crustaceans and nematode worms.&lt;ref name="Hill, (2008)"&gt;Hill, P.S.M., (2008). ''Vibrational Communication in Animals.'' Harvard, Cambridge, London&lt;/ref&gt;  Vibrations and other communication channels are not necessarily mutually exclusive, but can be used in multi-modal communication.

== Functions ==
Communication requires a sender, a message, and a recipient, although neither the sender or receiver need be present or aware of the others intent to communicate at the time of communication.

=== Intra-specific communication ===
Vibrations can provide cues to conspecifics about specific behaviours being performed, predator warning and avoidance, herd or group maintenance, and courtship.
The [[Middle East blind mole-rat]] (''Spalax ehrenbergi'') was the first mammal for which vibrational communication was documented. These [[fossorial]] rodents bang their head against the walls of their tunnels, which was initially interpreted as part of their tunnel building behaviour, however, it was eventually realised they generate temporally patterned vibrational signals for long-distance communication with neighbouring mole-rats.
Footdrumming is used widely as a predator warning or defensive action.  It is used primarily by fossorial or semi-fossorial rodents, but has also been recorded for [[spotted skunk]]s (''Spilogale putorius''), [[deer]] (e.g. white-tailed deer ''Odocoileus virginianus''), marsupials (e.g. [[Tammar wallaby|tammar wallabies]] ''Macropus eugenii''), rabbits (e.g. [[European rabbits]] ''Oryctolagus cuniculus'') and [[elephant shrew]]s (Macroscelididae).&lt;ref name="Randall, (2001)"&gt;Randall, J.A., (2001).  Evolution and function of drumming as communication in mammals. American Zoologist, 41: 1143–1156&lt;/ref&gt;  Banner-tailed kangaroo rats (''[[Dipodomys spectabilis]]'') footdrum in the presence of snakes as a form of individual defense and parental care.&lt;ref name="MoL-mammals"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapoflife.org/topics/topic_585_Vibrational-communication-in-mammals/|title=Vibrational communication in mammals|work=Map of Life|accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Randall and Matocq, (1997)"&gt;Randall, M.D. and Matocq, J.A., (1997).  Why do kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spectabilis) footdrum at snakes? Behavioural Ecology, 8: 404–413&lt;/ref&gt;  Several studies have indicated intentional use of [[ground vibrations]] as a means of intra-specific communication during courtship among the [[Cape mole-rat]] (''Georychus capensis'').&lt;ref name="Narins et al., (1992)"&gt;Narins, P.M., Reichman, O.J., Jarvis, J.U.M. and Lewis, E.R., (1992). Seismic signal transmission between burrows of the Cape mole-rat Georychus capensis. Journal of Comparative Physiology [A], 170: 13–22&lt;/ref&gt;  Footdrumming has been reported to be involved in male-male competition where the dominant male indicates its resource holding potential by drumming, thus minimising physical contact with potential rivals.  The Asian elephant (''Elephas maximus'') uses seismic communication in herd or group maintenance&lt;ref name="O’Connell-Rodwell et al., (2000)"&gt;O’Connell-Rodwell, C.E., Arnason, B. and Hart, L.A., (2000).  Seismic properties of elephant vocalizations and locomotion. Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 108: 3066–3072&lt;/ref&gt; and many social insects use seismic vibrations to coordinate the behaviour of group members, for example in cooperative foraging.&lt;ref name="mapoflife.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapoflife.org/topics/topic_458_Vibrational-communication-in-animals/|title=Web of Life:Vibrational communication in animals|accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other insects use vibrational communication to search for and attract mates, like North American treehoppers, ''Enchenopa binotata''. Males of this species use their abdomen to send vibrations through their host plant's stem. Females perceive these signals and respond to them to initiate a duet.&lt;ref&gt;Mcnett, G.D. and Cocroft, R.B. (2008). Host shifts favor vibrational signal divergence in Enchenopa binotata treehoppers. Behavioral Ecology. 19.3: 650-656.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wood, T.K., 1980. Intraspecific divergence in Enchenopa binotata Say (Homoptera: Membracidae) effected by host plant adaptation. Evolution, 34: 147-160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wood, T.K. &amp; Guttman, S.I., 1982. Ecological and behavioural basis for reproductive isolation in the sympatric Enchenopa binotata complex (Homoptera: Membracidae). Evolution, 36: 233-242.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inter-specific communication ===
The banner-tailed kangaroo rat, (''Dipodomys spectabilis),'' produces several complex footdrumming patterns in a number of different contexts, one of which is when it encounters a snake.  The footdrumming may alert nearby offspring but most likely conveys that the rat is too alert for a successful attack, thus preventing the snake's predatory pursuit.&lt;ref name="mapoflife.org"/&gt;  Vibrations caused by stampeding animals may be sensed by other species to alert them to danger, thereby increasing the size of the stampede and reducing the risk of danger to an individual.

=== Eavesdropping ===
Some animals use [[eavesdropping]] to either catch their prey or to avoid being caught by predators.  Some snakes are able to perceive and react to substrate-borne vibrations. The vibrations are transmitted through the lower jaw, which is often rested on the ground and is connected with the inner ear.  They also detect vibrations directly with receptors on their body surface.  Studies on horned desert vipers (''[[Cerastes cerastes]]'') showed they strongly rely on vibrational cues for capturing prey.  Localisation of the prey is probably aided by the two halves of the lower jaw being independent.&lt;ref name="mapoflife.org"/&gt;

Vibrational cues can even indicate the life stage of prey thereby aiding optimal prey selection by predators, e.g. [[larva]]l vibrations can be distinguished from those generated by [[pupa]]e, or, adults from juveniles.&lt;ref&gt;Meyhöfer, R., Casas, J. and Dorn, S., (1994). Host location by a parasitoid using leafminer vibrations: characterizing the vibrational signals produced by the leafmining host. Physiological Entomology, 19: 349–359&lt;/ref&gt; Although some species can conceal or mask their movements, substrate-borne vibrations are generally more difficult to avoid producing than airborne vibrations.&lt;ref name="Hill, (2009)"&gt;Hill, P.S.M., (2009).  How do animals use substrate-borne vibrations as an information source? Naturwissenschaften, 96: 1355–1371.  doi:10.1007/s00114-009-0588-8&lt;/ref&gt;  The common angle moth (''[[Macaria aemulataria|Semiothisa aemulataria]]'') caterpillar escapes predation by lowering itself to safety by a silk thread in response to vibrations produced by approaching predators.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

=== Mimicry ===
Several animals have learnt to capture prey species by mimicking the vibrational cues of their predators.   [[Wood turtle]]s (''Clemmys insculpta''),&lt;ref name="Kaufmann, (1986)"&gt;Kaufmann, J.H. (1986) Stomping for earthworms by wood turtles, Clemmys insculpta: a newly discovered foraging technique. Copeia, 1986: 1001–1004&lt;/ref&gt;  [[European herring gull]]s (''Larus argentatus''),&lt;ref name="Tinbergen, (1960)"&gt;Tinbergen, N., (1960). ''The Herring Gull's World.'' New York: Basic Books, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[humans]]&lt;ref name="Catania, (2008)"&gt;Catania, K.C., (2008). Worm grunting, fiddling, and charming — humans unknowingly mimic a predator to harvest bait. Public Library of Science ONE, 3(10): e3472. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0003472 [http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0003472]&lt;/ref&gt; have learnt to vibrate the ground causing earthworms to rise to the surface where they can be easily caught.  It is believed that deliberately produced surface vibrations mimic the seismic cues of moles moving through the ground to prey on the worms; the worms respond to these naturally produced vibrations by emerging from their burrows and fleeing across the surface.&lt;ref name="Catania, (2008)" /&gt;

Other animals mimic the vibrational cues of prey, only to ambush the predator when it is lured towards the mimic.  [[Assassin bug]]s (''Stenolemus bituberus'') hunt web-building spiders by invading the web and plucking the silk to generate vibrations that mimic prey of the spider.  This lures the resident spider into striking range of the bug.&lt;ref name="Wignall and Taylor, (2010)"&gt;Wignall, A.E. and Taylor, P.W., (2010).  Assassin bug uses aggressive mimicry to lure spider prey.  Proceedings of the Royal Society B. doi:10.1098/rspb.2010.2060 [http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2010/10/26/rspb.2010.2060.abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;  Spiders from at least five different families routinely invade the webs of other spiders and lure them as prey with vibratory signals (e.g. ''[[Pholcus]]'' or ‘daddy long-leg’ spiders; salticid ‘jumping’ spiders from the genera ''[[Portia (genus)|Portia]]'', ''[[Brettus]]'', ''[[Cyrba]]'' and ''[[Gelotia]]'').&lt;ref name="Wignall and Taylor, (2010)" /&gt;

''[[Portia fimbriata]]'' jumping spiders lure female ''[[Euryattus]]'' species by mimicking male courtship vibrations.&lt;ref name="Jackson and Wilcox, (1990)"&gt;Jackson, R.R. and Wilcox, R.S., (1990). Aggressive mimicry, prey-specific predatory behaviour and predator-recognition in the predator–prey interactions of Portia fimbriata and Euryattus sp., jumping spiders from Queensland. Behavioural Ecology and Sociobiology, 26: 111–119. doi:10.1007/BF00171580&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Habitat sensing ===
The wandering spider (''[[Cupiennius salei]]'') can discriminate vibrations created by rain, wind, prey, and potential mates.  The creeping grasshopper can escape predation by this spider if it produces vibrations similar enough to those of wind.&lt;ref&gt;Barth, F.G., Bleckmann, H., Bohnenberger, J. and Seyfarth, E-A., (1988). Spiders of the genus ''Cupiennius'' Simon 1891 (Araneae, Ctenidae): II. On the vibratory environment of a wandering spider. Oecologia, 77:194–201&lt;/ref&gt;  Thunderstorms and earthquakes produce vibrational cues; these may be used by elephants and birds to attract them to water or avoid earthquakes. Mole rats use reflected, self-generated seismic waves to detect and bypass underground obstacles - a form of "seismic echolocation".&lt;ref name="MoL-mammals"/&gt;

However, these type of use is not considered communication in the strictest sense.

== Production of vibrational cues ==
Vibrational cues can be produced in three ways, through percussion (drumming) on the substrate, vibrations of the body or appendages transmitted to the substrate, or, acoustical waves that couple with the substrate.&lt;ref name="O'Connell-Rodwell et al., (2001)"&gt;O'Connell-Rodwell, C.E., Hart,L.A. and Arnason, B.T., (2001). Exploring the potential use of seismic waves as a communication channel by elephants and other large mammals.  American Zoologist, 41(5): 1157-1170. doi: [https://dx.doi.org/10.1668/0003-1569(2001)041&amp;#91;1157:ETPUOS&amp;#93;2.0.CO;2]&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of these cues depends mostly on the size and muscular power of the animal producing the signal.&lt;ref name="Markl, (1983)"&gt;Markl, H., (1983).  Vibrational communication. In: ''Neuroethology and Behavioral Physiology,'' edited by Huber, F. and Markl, H. Berlin: Springer-Verlag, pp. 332–353&lt;/ref&gt;

; Percussion:
Percussion, or drumming, can produce both short-and long-distance vibrational cues. Direct percussion of the substrate can yield a much stronger signal than an airborne vocalization that couples with the substrate, however, the strength of the percussive cue is related directly to the mass of the animal producing the vibration. Large size is often associated with greater source amplitudes, leading to a greater propagation range. A wide range of vertebrates perform drumming with some part of their body either on the surface or within burrows. Individuals bang heads, rap trunks or tails, stamp or drum with front feet, hind feet or teeth, thump a [[gular skin|gular pouch]], and basically employ available appendages to create vibrations on the substrates where they live.&lt;ref name="Hill, (2008)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Randall, (2001)"/&gt;  Insects use percussion by drumming (or scraping) with the head, hind legs, fore legs, mid legs, wings, abdomen, [[gaster (insect anatomy)|gaster]], [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] or maxillary palps.&lt;ref name="Virant-Doberlet and Cokl, (2004)"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Virant-Doberlet |first1=Meta |last2=Čokl |first2=Andrej |year=2004 |title=Vibrational communication in insects |journal=Neotropical Entomology |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=121-134 |doi=10.1590/S1519-566X2004000200001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Tremulation:
Tremulation is performed by a range of insects.  This process involves rocking of the entire body with the subsequent vibrations being transferred through the legs to the substrate on which the insect is walking or standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sarmiento-Ponce |first1=Edith Julieta |title=Acoustic communication in insects |journal=Quehacer Científico en Chiapas |date=2014 |volume=9 |page=50 |url=http://www.dgip.unach.mx/images/pdf-REVISTA-QUEHACERCIENTIFICO/QUEHACER-CIENTIFICO-2014-jul-dic/Acoustic_communication_in_insects.pdf |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Stridulation:
Insects and other arthropods [[Stridulation|stridulate]] by rubbing together two parts of the body.[[File:Cf. Chorthippus biguttulus.ogg|thumb|right|200px|A stridulating cricket.]]  These are referred to generically as the stridulatory organs.  Vibrations are transmitted to the substrate through the legs or body.

; Tymbal vibrations:
Insects possess [[tymbal]]s which are regions of the exoskeleton modified to form a complex membrane with thin, membranous portions and thickened "ribs". These membranes vibrate rapidly, producing audible sound and vibrations that are transmitted to the substrate.

; Acoustically coupled:
Elephants produce low-frequency vocalizations at high amplitudes such that they couple with the ground and travel along the surface of the earth.&lt;ref name="O’Connell-Rodwell et al., (2000)" /&gt;  Direct percussion can produce a much stronger signal than airborne vocalizations that couple with the ground, as shown in the Cape mole rat and the [[Asian elephant]].&lt;ref name="O’Connell-Rodwell, (2007)" /&gt; However, the power that an animal can couple into the ground at low frequencies is related directly to its mass.  Animals of low mass cannot generate low-frequency vibrational surface waves; thus the mole rat could not produce a vibrational signal at 10–20&amp;nbsp;Hz like the elephant.  Some invertebrates e.g. prairie mole cricket (''[[Gryllotalpa major]]''),&lt;ref name="Hill and Shadley, (2001)"&gt;Hill, P.S.M. &amp; J.R. Shadley. (2001). Talking back: Sending soil vibration signals to lekking prairie mole cricket males. American Zoologist, 41: 1200-1214&lt;/ref&gt; bushcricket ([[Tettigoniidae]]),&lt;ref name="Kalmring et al., (1997)"&gt;Kalmring, K., Jatho, M., Rossler, W. and Sickmann, T. (1997). Acousto-vibratory communication in bushcrickets (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae). Entomology Genetics, 21: 265-291&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cicada]]&lt;ref name="Stölting et al., (2002)"&gt;Stölting, H., Moore T.E. and Lakes-Harlan. R., (2002). Substrate vibrations during acoustic signalling in the cicada Okanagana rimosa. Journal of Insect Science, 2: 2: 1-7&lt;/ref&gt; produce acoustic communications and substrate vibrations that may be due to acoustic coupling.&lt;ref name="Virant-Doberlet and Cokl, (2004)" /&gt;

For acoustic coupling, low-frequency, high-amplitude vocalizations are necessary for long-distance transmission. It has been suggested that other large mammals such as the [[lion]] and [[rhinoceros]] may produce acoustically coupled vibrational cues similar to elephants.&lt;ref name="O'Connell-Rodwell et al., (2001)" /&gt;

== Reception of vibrational cues ==
[[File:Condylura.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The star-nose mole]]
Vibrational cues are detected by various body parts.  Snakes receive signals by sensors in the lower jaw or body, invertebrates by sensors in the legs or body (earthworms), birds by sensors in the legs (pigeons) or bill-tip ([[Wader|shorebirds]], [[kiwi]]s and [[ibis]]es), mammals by sensors in the feet or lower jaw (mole rats) and kangaroos by sensors in the legs.&lt;ref name="Gregory et al., (1986)"&gt;Gregory, J.E., McIntyre, A.K. and Proske, U., (1986).  Vibration-evoked responses from lamellated corpuscles in the legs of kangaroos. Experimental Brain Research, 62: 648–653&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[star-nosed mole]] (''Condylura cristata''), has evolved an elaborate nose structure which may detect seismic waves.&lt;ref name="Catania, (1999)"&gt;Catania, K.C., (1999).  A nose that looks like a hand and acts like an eye: the unusual mechanosensory system of the star-nosed mole. Journal of Comparative Physiology [A], 185: 367–372&lt;/ref&gt;

The sensory organs are generically known as [[somatosensory]] [[mechanoreceptors]].  In insects these sensors are known as [[campaniform sensilla]]e located near the joints, the [[Scolopidia|subgenual organ]] in the [[tibia]] and [[Johnston's organ]] located in the [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]]. Arachnids use [[Slit sensilla|slit sense organ]]. In vertebrate animals the sensors are [[Lamellar corpuscle|Pacinian corpuscles]] in placental mammals, similar lamellated corpuscles in marsupials, [[Corpuscles of Herbst|Herbst corpuscles]] in birds and a variety of encapsulated or naked nerve endings in other animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mapoflife.org/topics/topic_584_Vibrational-communication-in-insects-and-spiders/|title=Web of Life:Vibrational communication in insects and spiders|accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These sensory receivers detect vibrations in the skin and joints, from which they are typically transmitted as nerve impulses ([[action potentials]]) to and through spinal nerves to the [[spinal cord]] and then the [[brain]]; in snakes, the nerve impulses could be carried through cranial nerves. Alternatively, the sensory receivers may be centralized in the [[cochlea]] of the inner ear. Vibrations are transmitted from the substrate to the cochlea through the body (bones, fluids, cartilage, etc.) in an ‘extra-tympanic’ pathway that bypasses the eardrum, and sometimes, even the middle ear. Vibrations then project to the brain along with cues from airborne sound received by the eardrum.&lt;ref name="Hill, (2009)" /&gt;

==Propagation of vibrational cues==
Documented cases of vibrational communication are almost exclusively restricted to Rayleigh waves or bending waves.&lt;ref name="Hill, (2009)" /&gt; Seismic energy in the form of Rayleigh waves transmits most efficiently between 10 and 40 [[Hertz|Hz]]. This is the range in which elephants may communicate seismically.&lt;ref name="O’Connell-Rodwell et al., (2000)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arnason  et al., (2002)"&gt;Arnason, B.T., Hart, L.A.and O’Connell-Rodwell, C.E., (2002). The properties of geophysical fields and their effects on elephants and other animals. Journal of Comparative Psychology, 116: 123–132&lt;/ref&gt; In areas with little to no human-generated seismic noise, frequencies around 20&amp;nbsp;Hz are relatively noise-free, other than vibrations associated with thunder or earth tremors, making it a reasonably quiet communication channel. Both airborne and vibrational waves are subject to interference and alteration from environmental factors. Factors such as wind and temperature influence airborne sound propagation, whereas propagation of seismic signals are affected by the substrate type and heterogeneity. Airborne sound waves spread spherically rather than cylindrically, attenuate more rapidly (losing 6 [[Decibel|dB]] for every doubling of distance) than ground surface waves such as Rayleigh waves (3&amp;nbsp;dB loss for every doubling of distance), and thus ground surface waves maintain integrity longer.&lt;ref name="O’Connell-Rodwell, (2007)"&gt;O’Connell-Rodwell, E.O., (2007).  Keeping an “ear” to the ground: seismic communication in elephants.  Physiology, 22: 287-294.  doi:10.1152/physiol.00008.200 [http://physiologyonline.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/22/4/287#R45]&lt;/ref&gt;  Vibrational signals are probably not very costly to produce for small animals, whereas the generation of air-borne sound is limited by body size.

Benefits and costs of vibrational communication to the signaler are dependent on the function of the signal. For social  signaling, daylight and line-of-sight are not required for seismic communication as they are for visual signaling. Likewise, flightless individuals may spend less time locating a potential mate by following the most direct route defined by substrate-borne vibrations, rather than by following sound or chemicals deposited on the path.&lt;ref name="Hill, (2009)" /&gt;

Most insects are herbivorous and usually live on plants, therefore the majority of vibrational signals are transmitted through plant stems. Here, communication typically ranges from 0.3 m-2.0 m. It has been suggested that vibrational signals might be adapted to transmit through particular plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapoflife.org/topics/topic_584_Vibrational-communication-in-insects-and-spiders/|title=Web of Life:Vibrational communication in insects and spiders|accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===American alligator===
During courtship, male American alligators use [[American alligator#Vocalizations|their near-infrasound capabilities]] to bellow to females, assuming a "reverse-arch" posture at the water's surface (head and tail slightly elevated, midsection barely breaking the surface) using near-infrasound to literally make the water's surface "sprinkle"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIxl10Qvgw8 Male alligator "sprinkling" while bellowing in near-infrasound during courtship]. YouTube.com (April 28, 2010). Retrieved on 2016-09-07.&lt;/ref&gt; as they bellow, usually termed as their "water dance"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garrick |first1=L. D. |last2=Lang |first2=J.

===White-lipped frog===
[[File:HylaArboreaCallingMale2.jpg|thumb|right|170px|European tree frog with distended gular pouch]]

One of the earliest reports of vertebrate signaling using vibrational communication is the bimodal system of sexual advertisement of the white-lipped frog (''[[Leptodactylus albilabris]]''). Males on the ground sing airborne advertisement songs that target receptive females, but instead of supporting themselves on their front limbs as other frogs often do, they partially bury themselves in soft soil. As they inflate their vocal sacs to produce the airborne call, the [[Throat|gular]] pouch impacts the soil as a ‘thump’ that sets up Rayleigh waves which propagate 3–6 m through the substrate. Advertising males space themselves at distances of 1–2 m, thus, the nearest neighbour males are able to receive and respond to substrate-borne vibrations created by other males.&lt;ref name="Hill, (2009)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis and Narins, (1985)"&gt;Lewis, E.R.and Narins, P.M., (1985). Do frogs communicate with seismic
signals? Science, 227: 187–189&lt;/ref&gt;

===Namib Desert golden mole===
Predators may use vibrational communication to detect and capture prey. The Namib Desert [[golden mole]] (''Eremitalpa granti namibensis'') is a blind mammal whose [[eyelid]]s fuse early in development.  The ear lacks a [[Pinna (anatomy)|pinna]], the reduced ear opening is hidden under fur and the organization of the middle ear indicates it would be sensitive to vibrational cues.  The Namib Desert golden mole actively forages at night by dipping its head and shoulders into the sand in conjunction with ‘sand swimming’ as it navigates in search of termite prey producing head-banging alarms.&lt;ref name="Narins et al., (1997)"&gt;Narins, P.M., Lewis, E.R., Jarvis, J.J.U.M. and O’Riain, J., (1997).  The use of seismic signals by fossorial southern African mammals: a neuroethological gold mine. Brain Research Bulletin, 44: 641–646&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mason, (2003)"&gt;Mason, M.J., (2003). Bone conduction and seismic sensitivity in golden moles (Chrysochloridae).

Seismic sensitivity in the desert golden mole (Eremitalpa granti): a review. Journal of Comparative Psychology, 116: 158–163&lt;/ref&gt;  Experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that substrate-borne vibrations produced as wind blows through grassy hummocks influence these moles as they forage on termites associated with the grassy mounds, which are spaced at distances of 20–25 m. The exact mechanism of extracting directional information from the vibrations has not been confirmed.&lt;ref name="Hill, (2009)" /&gt;

===Elephants===
[[File:Loxodonta africana oral rumble visualized with acoustic camera (25fps) - pone.0048907.s003.ogv|thumb|right|200px|Elephant producing low frequency rumbles]]
In the late 90's, Caitlin O'Connell-Rodwell first argued that elephants communicate over long distances using low-pitched rumbles that are barely audible to humans.{{Disputed inline|small=left|date=June 2018}}&lt;ref name="psyorg"&gt;{{cite web

| title = Scientists unravel the secret world of elephant communication
| accessdate = 2010-08-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further pioneering research in elephant infrasound communication was done by [[Katy Payne]] of the Elephant Listening Project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.birds.cornell.edu/brp/elephant/ | title = Elephant Listening Project | accessdate = 2007-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and detailed in her book ''Silent Thunder''. This research is helping our understanding of behaviours such as how elephants can find distant potential mates and how social groups are able to coordinate their movements over extensive ranges.&lt;ref name="Larom et al., (1997)"&gt;Larom, D., Garstang, M., Payne, K., Raspet, R. and Lindeque, M., (1999). The influence of surface atmospheric conditions on the range and area reached by animal vocalizations.  Journal of Experimental Biology, 200: 421–431 [url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/200/3/421.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  Joyce Poole has also begun decoding elephant utterances that have been recorded over many years of observation, hoping to create a lexicon based on a systematic catalogue of elephant sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=BARCUS |first1=CHRISTY ULLRICH |title=What Elephant Calls Mean: A User’s Guide |url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/05/what-elephant-calls-mean/ |website=National Geographic |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seismic energy transmits most efficiently between 10-40&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]], i.e. in the same range as the fundamental frequency and 2nd harmonic of an elephant rumble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elephantvoices.org/elephant-communication/seismic-communication.html
| title = Seismic communication
| first = Petter
| last = Granli
| accessdate = 2010-08-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For Asian elephants, these calls have a frequency of 14–24&amp;nbsp;Hz, with sound pressure levels of 85–90 [[Decibel|dB]] and last 10–15 seconds.&lt;ref name=Payne&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Payne, K.B. |author2=Langbauer, W.R. |author3=Thomas, E.M. |year=1986|title=Infrasonic calls of the Asian elephant (''Elephas maximus'')|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=18|issue=4|pages=297–301|doi=10.1007/BF00300007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For African elephants, calls range from 15–35&amp;nbsp;Hz and can be as loud as 117&amp;nbsp;dB, allowing communication over many kilometers.&lt;ref name="Larom et al., (1997)" /&gt;
It seems that when an elephant rumbles, the infrasound that is produced couples with the surface of the earth and then propagates through the ground.  In this way, elephants are able to use seismic vibrations at infrasound frequencies for communication.&lt;ref name="Gunther et al., (2004)"&gt;Günther, R.H., O'Connell-Rodwell, C.E. and Klemperer, S.L., (2004). Seismic waves from elephant vocalizations: A possible communication mode?  Geophysical Research Letters, 31: L11602.  doi:10.1029/2004GL019671&lt;/ref&gt;  These vibrations can be detected by the skin of an elephant's feet and trunk, which relay the resonant vibrations, similar to the skin on a drum. To listen attentively, individuals will lift one foreleg from the ground, possibly [[triangulation|triangulating]] the source, and face the source of the sound.  Occasionally, attentive elephants can be seen to lean forward, putting more weight on their front feet.  These behaviours presumably increase the ground contact and sensitivity of the legs.  Sometimes, the trunk will be laid on the ground.

Elephants possess several adaptations suited for vibratory communication. The cushion pads of the feet contain cartilaginous nodes and have similarities to the acoustic fat ([[Melon (whale)|melon]]) found in [[marine mammals]] like [[toothed whales]] and [[sirenian]]s. In addition, the annular muscle surrounding the [[ear canal]] can constrict the passageway, thereby dampening acoustic signals and allowing the animal to hear more seismic signals.&lt;ref name="O’Connell-Rodwell, (2007)"/&gt;

Elephants appear to use vibrational communication for a number of purposes.  An elephant running or mock charging can create seismic signals that can be heard at great distances.&lt;ref name="O’Connell-Rodwell et al., (2000)" /&gt;  Vibrational waveforms produced by locomotion appear to travel at distances of up to {{convert|32|km|mi|abbr=on}} while those from vocalizations travel {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}}. When detecting the vibrational cues of an alarm call signaling danger from predators, elephants enter a defensive posture and family groups will congregate.&lt;ref name="O’Connell-Rodwell et al., (2006)"&gt;O’Connell-Rodwell, C.E., Wood, J.D., Rodwell, T.C. Puria, S., Partan, S.R., Keefe, R., Shriver, D., Arnason, B.T. and Hart, L.A., (2006).  Wild elephant (''Loxodonta africana'') breeding herds respond to artificially transmitted seismic stimuli.  Behavioral and Ecological Sociobiology, 59: 842–850. doi:10.1007/s00265-005-0136-2 {{cite web |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/bec/papers/OConnellRodwell_4.16.07.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203071054/http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/bec/papers/OConnellRodwell_4.16.07.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vibrational cues are also thought to aid their navigation by use of external sources of infrasound.  After the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Boxing Day tsunami]] in Asia, there were reports that trained elephants in Thailand had become agitated and fled to higher ground before the devastating wave struck, thus saving their own lives and those of the tourists riding on their backs. Because earthquakes and tsunamis generate low-frequency waves, O'Connell-Rodwell and other elephant experts have begun to explore the possibility that the Thai elephants were responding to these events.&lt;ref name="psyorg"/&gt;

== Background ==
A sustainable landscape is designed to be both attractive and in balance with the local climate and environment and it should require minimal resource inputs. Thus, the design must be “functional, cost-efficient, visually pleasing, environmentally friendly and maintainable" &lt;ref name="ext.colostate.edu"&gt;Colorado State University Extension. http://www.ext.colostate.edu/Pubs/Garden/07243.html. Viewed 11-15-09.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the concept called [[sustainable development]] it pays close attention to the preservation of limited and costly resources, reducing waste and preventing air, water and soil pollution. Landscape Maintenance practices greatly influence the waste produced and the cost of the maintenance itself; such as using electric or gas [[hedge trimmer]]s which degrade plant material rather than using hand shears which create plant longevity, reduce the amount of waste over time, and prevent the misshaping of plant material and eliminates the "Balls and Boxes that unskilled gardeners create.(James Deagan, Prof Cal Poly Pomona Lecture 1980),  In addition, compost, fertilization, grass cycling, pest control measures that avoid or minimize the use of chemicals, [[integrated pest management]], using the right plant in the right place, appropriate use of turf, irrigation efficiency and [[xeriscaping]] or water-wise gardening are all components of sustainable landscaping.&lt;ref name="ciwmb.ca.gov"/&gt;

== Benefits ==
The geographic location can determine what is sustainable due to differences in precipitation and temperature. For example, the [[California Waste Management]] Board emphasizes the link between minimizing environmental damage and maximizing one’s bottom line of urban commercial landscaping companies. In California, the benefits of landscapes often do not outweigh the cost of inputs like water and labor. However, using appropriately selected and properly sited plants may help to ensure that maintenance costs are lower than they otherwise would be due to reduced chemical and water inputs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;California Integrated Waste Management Board. http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Organics/landscaping/ Viewed 11-15-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==
There are several programs in place that are open to participation by various groups. For example, the [[Audubon International#Programs|Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary Program]] for [[Golf|Golf Courses]],&lt;ref&gt;http://Audubon International. acspgolf.auduboninternational.org/. Viewed 9/23/09.&lt;/ref&gt; the Audubon Green Neighborhoods Program,&lt;ref&gt;Green Neighborhoods http://gn.auduboninternational.org/.

The Sustainable Sites Initiative, the cooperative effort between the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]], the [[Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center]] and the [[United States Botanic Garden]], began in 2005 and will provide a points-based certification for landscapes, similar to the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] program for buildings operated by the [[Green Building Council]]. The Sustainable Sites Initiative now has a document titled Guidelines and Performance Benchmarks.&lt;ref&gt;The Sustainable Sites Initiative. http://www.sustainablesites.org/report/SSI_Guidelines_Draft_2008.pdf. Viewed 9/23/09.&lt;/ref&gt; The credit system is expected to be completed in 2011.

== Proper design ==
The primary step to landscape design is to do a "sustainability audit". This is similar to a landscape site analysis that is typically performed by landscape designers at the beginning of the design process. Factors such as lot size, house size, local covenants and budgets should be considered. The steps to design include a base plan, site inventory and analysis, construction documents, implementation and maintenance.&lt;ref name="ext.colostate.edu"/&gt; Of great importance is considerations related to the growing conditions of the site.  These include orientation to the sun, [[soil type]], wind flow, slopes, shade and climate.  The goal of reducing artificial [[irrigation]] (such as preventing irrigation of landscapes leaving the Los Angeles Basin a Desert again), and reducing use of toxic substances and requires proper plant selection for the specific site.

== Composting ==
{{Main|Composting}}
Composting is a way to recycle kitchen and garden waste while creating inexpensive organic fertilizer for the garden and landscape. Earthworms, microbes and other soil microorganisms feast on such organic matter when provided adequate nitrogen and proper temperatures and moisture. The ideal size for a compost pile or bin is one cubic yard (3' x 3' x 3'). It should be placed in a partly shady location to avoid intense sun and drying out, as this will delay the decomposition process. The pile heats up during the decomposition process, then cools as material is transformed; this is a good time to turn the pile, so that uncomposed materials on the periphery of the pile can be moved to the center to complete the process. With adequate moisture, nitrogen, proper temperature and correct timing of turning the pile, compost can be made in about a 30-day period. Left alone this process will still occur, but may take three to four months under less-than-ideal conditions.

Compost can be added as an amendment to poorly draining soil, as a fertilizer on flower and vegetable beds, to fruit trees or used as a potting soil for potted plants. Trimmings from lawns, trees and shrubs from a large landscape site can be used as feedstock for on-site composting. Reusing on-site organic materials will decrease the need for purchasing other soil additives.

== Irrigation ==
[[Mulch]] may be used to reduce water loss due to [[evaporation]], reduce weeds, minimize [[erosion]], dust and mud problems. Mulch can also add nutrients to the soil when it decomposes. However, mulch is most often used for weed suppression.  Over use of mulch can result in harm to the selected plantings. Care must be taken in the source of the mulch, for instance, black walnut trees result in a toxic mulch product. Grass cycling turf areas (using mulching mowers that leave grass clippings on the lawn) will also decrease the amount of fertilizer needed, reduce landfill waste and reduce costs of disposal.&lt;ref name="ciwmb.ca.gov"/&gt;

A common recommendation is to adding 2-4&amp;nbsp;inches of mulch in flower beds and under trees away from the trunk. Mulch should be applied under trees to the dripline (extension of the branches) in lieu of flowers, [[hosta]]s, [[turf]] or other plants that are often planted there. This practice of planting under trees is detrimental to tree roots, especially when such plants are irrigated to an excessive level that harms the tree. One must be careful not to apply mulch to the bark of the tree.  It can result in smothering, mold and to insect depredation.

The practice of [[xeriscaping]] or water-wise gardening suggests that placing plants with similar water demands together will save time and low-water or drought tolerant plants would be a smart initial consideration.

A homeowner may consider consulting an accredited irrigation technician/auditor and obtain a water audit of current systems. In the event that the situation is difficult to manage, drip or sub-surface irrigation may be most effective. If the system has been in use for over five years, upgrading to [[evapotranspiration]] (ET) controllers, soil sensors and refined control panels will improve the system. Often irrigation heads are in need of readjustment to avoid sprinkling on sidewalks or streets. Business owners may consider developing watering schedules based on historical or actual weather data and soil probes to monitor soil moisture prior to watering.&lt;ref name="ext.colostate.edu"/&gt;

== Building materials ==
{{see also|Sustainable architecture}}
When deciding what kind of building materials to put on a site it is important to recycle as often as possible. Reusing old bricks from sidewalks as patio pavers is one way to provide an aesthetic appeal to an area while reducing what goes to the landfill.

But it is also important to be careful about what materials you use, especially if you plan to grow food crops of any kind. Old telephone poles and railroad ties have usually been treated with a substance called [[creosote]] that can leach into the soils and make any food grown there toxic enough to cause harm to anyone that eats it. In general, you should avoid any kind of treated material, especially wood, that could leach into the soil with rain.&lt;ref name="sustainable-landscape.com"&gt;Sustainable Landscape Design's Custom Design Philosophy. http://www.sustainable-landscape.com/about.html.

The [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (http://www.fscus.org/) was formed in 1993 "to change the dialogue about and the practice of sustainable forestry worldwide." Sustainably harvested lumber - also called [[certified wood]] is now available, in which ecological, economic and social factors are integrated into the management of trees used for lumber.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bearcreeklumber.com/products/intextboth/sustainable.html.

== Planting selection ==
{{see also|Xeriscaping|Native plant}}
One important part of sustainable landscaping is plant selection. Most of what makes a landscape unsustainable is the amount of inputs required to grow a non-native plant on it. What this means is that a local plant, which has adapted to local climate conditions will require less work on the part of some other agent to flourish. For example, it does not make sense to grow tomatoes in Arizona because there is not enough natural rainfall for them to survive without constant watering. Instead, [[drought-tolerant]] plants like [[succulents]] and [[cacti]] are better suited to survive. Also, by choosing native plants, one can avoid certain problems with insects and pests because these plants will also be adapted to deal with any local invader. The bottom line is that by choosing the right kind of local plants, a great deal of money can be saved on amendment costs, pest control and watering.&lt;ref name="sustainable-landscape.com"/&gt;

Plants used as [[windbreak]]s can save up to 30% on [[heating costs]] in winter. They also help with shading a residence or commercial building in summer, create cool air through evapo-transpiration and can cool hardscaped areas such as driveways and sidewalks.&lt;ref&gt;Farmstead Windbreaks: Planning. http://www.extension.iastate.edu/Publications/PM1716.pdf. Retrieved 12-12-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

A house surrounded by local trees or bushes enjoys multiple benefits. Plants release [[water vapor]] in the air through [[transpiration]] and water has the ability to reduce temperature extremes in the areas near it (as it boasts very high [[heat capacity]]). The larger and more leafy the plant, the most water vapor it produces. Additionally, the presence of trees is crucial in the creation of stable, healthy and productive ecosystems (such as forests). In fact this is an important principle of [[permaculture]].

If the surrounding trees are chosen to produce edible fruit they can provide a sustainable food source for the occupants of the house. Even if some are fairly demanding (especially in the summer), irrigation is an excellent end-use option in [[greywater]] recycling and [[rainwater harvesting]] systems, and a [[composting toilet]] can cover (at least) some of the [[nutrient]] requirements. Research suggests that diluted human urine might be as effective as chemical fertilizers.{{fact|date=January 2016}} Not all fruit trees are suitable for greywater irrigation, as reclaimed greywater is typically of high pH and [[acidophile]] plants don't do well in alkaline environments.

An intelligent choice for direct energy conservation would be the placement of broadleaf [[deciduous]] trees near the east, west and optionally north-facing walls of the house. Such selection provides shading in the summer while permitting large amounts of heat-carrying solar radiation to strike the house in the winter. The trees are to be placed as closely as possible to the house walls but no closer than 1 meter - otherwise the roots can cause substantial foundation damage. A sustainable house will most likely be equipped with south-facing (north-facing in the S. hemisphere) [[photovoltaic panel]]s and a large, south-facing [[glazing (window)|glazing]] as a result of [[passive solar]] heating design. As the efficiency of both systems is very sensitive to shading, experts suggest the complete absence of trees near the south side.

Another intelligent choice would be that of a dense vegetative fence composed of evergreens (e.g. [[conifer]]s) near that side from which cold continental winds blow (usually north in the N. hemisphere) and also that side from which the [[prevailing winds]] blow (west in temperate regions of both hemispheres). Since north winds are most cold and westerlies blow most often, such choice creates an effective winter windbarrier that prevents very low temperatures outside the house and reduces air infiltration towards the inside. Calculations show that placing the windbrake at a distance twice the height of the trees can reduce the wind velocity by 75%. It then follows that, with some planning, both arrangements (deciduous and evergreen) can be applied simultaneously.&lt;ref name="GF"&gt;"Green from the ground up" by D. Johnston and S. Gibson&lt;/ref&gt;

The above vegetative arrangements come with two disadvantages. Firstly, they minimize air circulation in summer (although in many climates heating is more important and costly than cooling) and, secondly, they may affect the efficiency of photovoltaic panels, thus prompting the need for a shading analysis. However, it has been estimated that if both arrangements are applied properly, they can reduce the overall house energy usage by up to 22%.&lt;ref name="GF" /&gt;

== Maintenance ==
{{see also|Organic gardening}}
'''''Pest Problems'''''

Maintaining plant health will eliminate most pest problems. It is best to start with pest-free plant materials and supplies and close inspection of the plant upon purchase is also recommended. Establishing diversity within the area of plant species will encourage beneficial organism populations (e.g. birds, insects), which feed on potential plant pests. Attracting a wide variety of organisms with a variety of host plants has shown to be effective in increasing pollinator presence in agrarian settings &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cole|first=Lorna J.|last2=Brocklehurst|first2=Sarah|last3=Robertson|first3=Duncan|last4=Harrison|first4=William|last5=McCracken|first5=David I.|date=2015-12|title=Riparian buffer strips: Their role in the conservation of insect pollinators in intensive grassland systems|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167880915002327|journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment|volume=211|pages=207–220|doi=10.1016/j.agee.2015.06.012|issn=0167-8809}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Because plant pests vary from plant to plant, assessing the problem correctly is half the battle. The owner must consider whether the plant can tolerate the damage caused by the pest. If not, then does the plant value justify some sort of treatment? While pesticide is often chosen to solve the problem, physical barriers and repellents may help. If pesticides are the chosen method, selective organic or natural pesticide is often better because it has less impact on non-target species.&lt;ref name="ext.colostate.edu" /&gt; 

'''''Pruning'''''

Proper pruning will increase air circulation and decrease the likelihood of plant diseases. However, improper pruning is detrimental to shrubs and trees.&lt;ref name="ext.colostate.edu" /&gt; Hedging, topping and shearing of landscape plants causes excessive plant growth. In addition, topping is a hazardous practice which creates a hazardous tree which is highly susceptible to wind damage. Natural pruning techniques during the proper season, on the other hand, promotes healthier, more stable plants.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; In temperate areas, deciduous plants should be pruned during dormancy. Plants should never be pruned at the end of a growing season because growth is stimulated and such new growth will be too tender to survive winter freezing temperatures.

'''''Pollution Prevention'''''

Landscape managers should make use of the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) to reduce use of pesticides and herbicides and reduce non-point source solution. As there is considerable debate on the safety levels of nitrates and the impact of fertilizer run-off, more studies are needed in order to determine if the risks justify the outcomes of applying nitrate-ladden fertilizers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Powlson|first=David S.|last2=Addiscott|first2=Tom M.|last3=Benjamin|first3=Nigel|last4=Cassman|first4=Ken G.|last5=Kok|first5=De|last6=M|first6=Theo|last7=van Grinsven|first7=Hans|last8=L'hirondel|first8=Jean-Louis|last9=Avery|first9=Alex A.|date=2008-03-01|title=When Does Nitrate Become a Risk for Humans?|url=https://www.agronomy.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/37/2/291|journal=Journal of Environmental Quality|language=en|volume=37|issue=2|pages=291–295|doi=10.2134/jeq2007.0177|pmid=18268290|issn=1537-2537}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity''' ('''TEEB''') is a study led by [[Pavan Sukhdev]]. It is an international initiative to draw attention to the global economic benefits of [[biodiversity]]. Its objective is to highlight the growing cost of [[biodiversity loss]] and [[environmental degradation|ecosystem degradation]] and to draw together expertise from the fields of science, economics and policy to enable practical actions. TEEB aims to assess, communicate and mainstream the urgency of actions through its five deliverables&amp;mdash;D0: science and economic foundations, policy costs and costs of inaction, D1: policy opportunities for national and international policy-makers, D2: decision support for local administrators, D3: business risks, opportunities and metrics and D4: citizen and consumer ownership.

One motive for the study was to establish an objective global standard basis for [[natural capital accounting]]. Estimates establish the cost of biodiversity and ecosystem damage expected to cost 18% of global economic output by 2050&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11606228|title=Nature's gift: The economic benefits of preserving the natural world|first=Richard|last=Anderson|date=24 October 2010|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and currently at over US$2T (for the largest 3000 companies according to [[Trucost]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11495812|title=Nature's sting: The real cost of damaging Planet Earth|first=Richard|last=Anderson|date=12 October 2010|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some estimates as high as US$6T/year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10103179|title=Nature loss 'to damage economies'|first=Richard|last=Black|date=10 May 2010|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[World Bank]] in particular has led recent efforts to include the cost of biodiversity and climate harm in national accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11642538|title=World Bank to account for nature|first=Richard|last=Black|date=28 October 2010|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its sponsors declare TEEB to be a "major international initiative to draw attention to the global economic benefits of biodiversity, to highlight the growing costs of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation, and to draw together expertise from the fields of science, economics and policy to enable practical actions moving forward."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teebweb.org|title=The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity - TEEB|website=TEEB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2010 it released its report "Mainstreaming the Economics of Nature: a synthesis of the approach, conclusions and recommendations of TEEB"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teebweb.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=bYhDohL_TuM=&amp;tabid=924&amp;mid=1813|title=Page Not Found|website=TEEB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and launched the [[Bank of Natural Capital]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bankofnaturalcapital.com|title=Bank of natural – Capital|website=bankofnaturalcapital.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; to communicate its findings to the general public.

==History==
The TEEB study was launched by Germany and the [[European Commission]] in response to a proposal by the [[G8+5]] Environment Ministers in Potsdam, Germany in 2007, to develop a global study on the [[economics of biodiversity]] loss. The second phase of the TEEB study is hosted by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) with support from a number of organizations, including the European Commission, German [[Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety]] and the UK [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]].

Pavan Sukhdev, a senior banker from [[Deutsche Bank]], and founder-director of the [[green accounting]] project GIST (Green Indian States Trust&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gistindia.org/|title=gist|website=gist}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in India. The TEEB Advisory Board includes experts from the fields of science and economics.

The TEEB Interim Report was released in May 2008 under Phase I. The report provided evidence for significant global and local [[economic loss]]es and human welfare impacts due to the ongoing losses of biodiversity and degradation of [[ecosystem]]s. It focused largely on forests and looked at the extent of losses of [[natural capital]] taking place as a result of [[deforestation]] and degradation. TEEB estimates that this is US$2–4.5 trillion per year, every year.

Phase II of the study set out to expand on the work begun in Phase I. It was completed in 2010 and presented in [[Nagoya]], Japan, at the 10th Conference of the Parties of the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) in October 2010. The final volumes of TEEB are being published by Earthscan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthscan.co.uk/ Earthscan]&lt;/ref&gt; The first volume published in October 2010: The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity: Ecological and Economic Foundations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthscan.co.uk/?tabid=102480|title=Environment &amp; Sustainability - Routledge|website=Routledge.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second, third and fourth volumes will be published over the course of 2011.

==Phase i: key messages==
The world has already lost much of its biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;Novacek, M.J. and Cleland, E.E. (2001). "The current biodiversity extinction event: Scenarios for mitigation and recovery". ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'' (98):11, 5466–5470.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scholes, R.J. and Biggs, R. (2005). "A biodiversity intactness index". ''Nature'' 434, 45–49&lt;/ref&gt; TEEB indicates that pressure on [[commodity]] and food prices shows the consequences of this loss to society. TEEB recommends that urgent remedial action is essential because [[species loss]] and ecosystem degradation are inextricably linked to human well-being. Economic growth and the conversion of natural ecosystems to agricultural production are forecasted to continue, but TEEB feels that it is essential to ensure that such development takes proper account of the real value of natural ecosystems. This is central to both economic and [[environmental management]].

The findings of TEEB (Interim Report) were largely in three areas&amp;mdash;the economic size and welfare impact of losses of ecosystems and biodiversity, the strong links between biodiversity [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] and ecosystem health on the one hand and poverty elimination and the achievement of Millennium Development Goals on the other, and the ethical choices involved in selecting a social discount rate for discounting the benefits of ecosystems and biodiversity.

===Main findings===
* 11% of the natural areas remaining in 2000 could be lost, chiefly as a result of conversion for agriculture, the expansion of infrastructure, and climate change.
* Almost 40% of the land currently under low-impact forms of agriculture could be converted to intensive agricultural use, with further biodiversity losses.
* It is estimated that for an annual investment of US$45 billion into protected areas alone, the delivery of [[ecosystem services]] worth some US$5 trillion a year could be secured.

TEEB finds that sound [[ecosystem management|ecosystem]] and biodiversity management, and the inclusion of natural capital in governmental and business accounting can start to redress inaction and reduce the cost of future losses.

==Phase II==
TEEB Phase II, currently underway, takes an economic approach that is spatially specific and builds on knowledge of how ecosystems function and deliver [[Service (economics)|services]]. It examines how ecosystems and their associated services are likely to respond to particular policy actions. A fundamental focus of TEEB is on developing an economic yardstick that is more effective than [[GDP]] for assessing the performance of an economy. TEEB recommends that [[national accounting]] systems need to be more inclusive in order to measure the significant human welfare benefits that ecosystems and biodiversity provide. Such systems can help policy makers adopt the right measures and design appropriate financing mechanisms for conservation.

In Phase II TEEB aims to:

* Integrate [[ecology|ecological]] and economic knowledge to structure the evaluation of [[ecosystem services]] under different scenarios.
* Recommend appropriate [[Valuation (finance)|valuation]] methodologies for different contexts.
* Examine the economic costs of biodiversity decline and the costs and benefits of actions to reduce these losses.
* Develop ‘toolkits’ for policy makers at international, regional and local levels to foster [[sustainable development]] and better conservation of ecosystems and biodiversity.
* Enable easy access to leading information and tools for improved biodiversity practice for the business community&amp;mdash;from the perspective of managing risks, addressing opportunities, and measuring impacts.
* Raise public awareness of the individual’s impact on biodiversity and ecosystems, and areas where individual action can make a positive difference.

==Climate issues update==
TEEB's Climate Update stated that an agreement on funding for forests was a key priority for governments attending the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Copenhagen.

An estimated 5 gigatonnes or 15% of worldwide carbon dioxide emissions are absorbed or 'sequestrated' by forests every year, making them the "mitigation engine" of the natural world.

TEEB finds that investing in ecosystem-based measures such as financing [[Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation]] (REDD) can thus assist in combating [[climate change]] and can also be a key anti-poverty and adaptation measure.

The Update also underlines a 'Coral Reef Emergency' that is already here as a result of the current build-up of greenhouse gases. Scientists contributing to the TEEB process indicate that irreversible damage to coral reefs can occur at atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations of over 350 parts per million (ppm). This is linked with rising temperatures and [[ocean acidification]]. Concentrations are above this threshold and rising. It raises concerns that stabilizing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels at 450 ppm, or some 16% above the current levels, may condemn this critical, multibillion-dollar ecosystem to extinction and take with it the livelihoods of 500 million people within a matter of decades.

==Green economy initiative==
The UNEP's [[green economy]] initiative is a project designed to communicate that the [[green economy|greening of economies]] is not a burden on growth but rather a new engine for growth, employment, and the reduction of persistent global poverty. The [[green economy]] report, published in February 2011, used economic analysis and modelling approaches to provide an in-depth assessment of identified economic sectors where "greening" might lead to prosperity and job creation (i.e. traditional economic growth). This promotes sectors regarded as necessary for a [[green economy]] such as: agriculture, buildings, cities, fishery, forests, industry, [[renewable energy]], transport, tourism, [[waste management]], and water as well as the enabling conditions in finance, domestic and international policy architecture.

==Criticism==
The approach to valuing ecosystems encapsulated by the TEEB project has been criticized and is open to the same problems as affect all mainstream [[economic value]] theories.  More specifically the argument is that prices need to be corrected for [[market failure]] and simple adjustments can be made to correct the price system so resources will be allocated efficiently. The basis for this recalculation is human preferences for nature, ecosystems, bugs and plants.  One critique concerns the irrelevance of human preferences for determining what is ecologically essential for the maintenance of life support systems. Human preferences may be a good guide to choosing ice cream flavors but not the mix of species or gases in the atmosphere necessary to sustain life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clivespash.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Spash_Ecosystem_Value_EV_2008.pdf|title=Spash, C.L. 2008.

Beyond criticism of the actual calculations being used in these TEEB studies and associated work there is the institutional implications.  Pavan Sukdev argues for a financial and banking sector response which will 'capture values'. This basically means making [[Profit (economics)|profits]] for those prepared to develop and trade new financial instruments and fund financial initiatives which will trade biodiversity and ecosystem assets as new [[financial asset]]s. This is seen by some as the hidden agenda of TEEB as it has been backed by financial interests including being headed by a former [[Deutsche Bank]] financier. Clive Spash refers to TEEB as "terrible economics, ecosystems and banking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Spash, C.

'''Tonmeister''' is most often found as a job description in the music and recording industries. It describes a person who is a sound master (a literal translation of the German word): a [[Record producer|person who creates recordings or broadcasts of music]] who is both deeply musically trained (in [[Classical music|'classical']] and non-classical genres) and also who has a detailed theoretical and practical knowledge of virtually all aspects of [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recording]]. Both competencies have equal importance in a tonmeister's work.

A Tonmeister spans both art and technology: working with musicians on a musical level to help them achieve the best performances and interpretation; and utilizing or directing the use of appropriate technology to produce the most communicative experience for the listener, including appropriate editing, sound balance and other post-production skills. One may say that a Tonmeister would utilize the techniques of scientific measurement (microphones, digital recorders, accurate amplifiers, etc.), but he or she is in the entertainment industry, too, using additional techniques to create experiences and illusions for performers and listeners.

The word ''tonmeister'' was trademarked in 1996 for the UK by the [[University of Surrey]]. Also within the UK, the SAE Institute registered the term ''SAE Tonmeister'', which has been abbreviated to ''tonmeister'' in their registrations in several other countries, but not including Germany, Switzerland, or Austria. Members of the [[Verband Deutscher Tonmeister|VDT]] may call themselves Tonmeister VDT.

When describing the full four-year UK BMus degree or its equivalent in Germany, the term is applied mostly to people who have graduated at bachelor's level in music and applied physics and who have gathered, under university supervision, at least a year of appropriate industrial experience in the music or recording business. Their musical training generally encompasses a full conventional classical training including instrumental studies, conducting, composition, historic and analytical studies and performance; together with applied physics and mathematics including calculus, the Fourier transform, complex numbers, information theory and modulation techniques, acoustics, electronics and much experience in recording techniques and music technology garnered in modern studios and on many locations. A portfolio of recordings must be offered in the final degree assessment.

== Origins ==

The concept of a Tonmeister dates back to 1946,&lt;ref name="Borwick"&gt;{{citation |first=John |last=Borwick |title=The Tonmeister Concept |year=1973 |location=Proceedings of the 46th Audio Engineering Society Convention (paper 938).}}&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Arnold Schoenberg]] wrote a letter to the Chancellor of the University of Chicago suggesting a course to train "soundmen". Schoenberg wrote "soundmen will be trained in music, acoustics, physics, mechanics and related fields to a degree enabling them to control and improve the sonority of recordings, radio broadcasts and sound films".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bLf0u5GXo84C&amp;lpg=PA241&amp;ots=759OOoU5Y3&amp;dq=soundmen%20will%20be%20trained%20in%20music%2C%20acoustics%2C%20physics%2C%20mechanics%20and%20related%20fields%20to%20a%20degree%20enabling%20them%20to%20control%20and%20improve%20the%20sonority%20of%20recordings%2C%20radio%20broadcasts%20and%20sound%20films&amp;pg=PA241#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Arnold Schoenberg letters, p. 241]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also in this year that the University in Detmold, Germany, started the first Tonmeister course ([[#Tonmeister Institutes in Germany|see below]]).

== Education ==
Seven institutions (six European and one global) offer honors degrees that are called Tonmeister: The Royal Danish Academy of Music Copenhagen (RDAM), the Universität der Künste Berlin ([[UdK]]) and the [[Hochschule für Musik Detmold]] in Germany; the [[Universität für Musik und darstellende Kunst Wien]] in Austria, the [[Conservatoire de Paris]], the [[University of Surrey]] in the United Kingdom; and (as a post-graduate study) the [http://www.sae.edu SAE Institute] in Oxford, UK and Byron Bay, Australia.

In 1998, the previous Course Director at the University of Surrey, Dave Fisher, characterised the Tonmeister course as a course for excellent musicians/scientists who wish to acquire the theoretical knowledge and practical skills of sound recording along with both an academic understanding of audio engineering and also an experiential understanding of the technology of the sound recording and broadcast industries. Its aims were described in this way:
* a comprehensive and up-to-date knowledge base;
* intellectual and practical skills;
* technical, artistic and scholarly curiosity;
* motivation and self-directed learning skills;
* professional skills and training;
* communication and presentation skills;
* self-confidence;

...all acquired as appropriate for a career in audio engineering or sound recording.

===Mercury, Moon, and Earth===

{{Main|Lunar water}}

Recent observation made by a number of spacecraft confirmed significant amounts of [[Lunar water]]. Mercury does not appear to contain observable quantities of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, presumably due to loss from giant impacts.&lt;ref name = Drake2005/&gt; In contrast, Earth's hydrosphere contains ~{{convert|1.46e21|kg|abbr=on}} of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and [[sedimentary rock]]s contain ~{{convert|0.21e21|kg|abbr=on}}, for a total crustal inventory of ~{{convert|1.67e21|kg|abbr=on}} of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.&lt;ref name = Kulikov2006/&gt; The mantle inventory is poorly constrained in the range of {{convert|0.5e21-4e21|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name = Morbidelli2000&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morbidelli|first1=A.|last2=Chambers|first2=J.|last3=Lunine|first3=J.

===Venus===

{{Main|Atmosphere of Venus}}

The current Venusian atmosphere has only ~200&amp;nbsp;mg/kg H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(g) in its atmosphere and the pressure and temperature regime makes water unstable on its surface. Nevertheless, assuming that early Venus's H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O had a D/H ratio similar to Earth's Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water ([[VSMOW]]) of 1.6×10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref name = NIST&gt;[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (2005), [https://srmors.nist.gov/certificates/8535.pdf?CFID=12001608&amp;CFTOKEN=5c24bc7fc8132ce6-2B2520A5-A7C5-6123-0D31F83B0741932B&amp;jsessionid=b430d26f379de78357e1 Report of Investigation]&lt;/ref&gt; the current D/H isotopic ratio in the Venusian atmosphere of 1.9×10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, at nearly ×120 of Earth's, may indicate that Venus had a much larger H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O inventory.&lt;ref name = Kulikov2006&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kulikov|first1=Yu.

==Accretion of water by Earth and Mars==

{{Main|Origin of water on Earth}}

The D/H isotopic ratio is a primary constraint on the source of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O of terrestrial planets. Comparison of the planetary D/H ratios with those of carbonaceous chondrites and comets enables a tentative determination of the source of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The best constraints for accreted H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O are determined from non-atmospheric H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, as the D/H ratio of the atmospheric component may be subject to rapid alteration by the preferential loss of H &lt;ref name=Jakosky2001/&gt; unless it is in isotopic equilibrium with surface H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Earth's VSMOW D/H ratio of 1.6×10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name=NIST/&gt; and modeling of impacts suggest that the cometary contribution to crustal water was less than 10%. However, much of the water could be derived from Mercury-sized planetary embryos that formed in the [[asteroid belt]] beyond 2.5&amp;nbsp;AU.&lt;ref name = Lunine2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lunine|first1=J. I.|last2=Chambers|first2=J.|last3=Morbidelli|first3=A.|last4=Leshin|first4=L. A.|title=The origin of water on Mars|journal=Icarus|date=2003|volume=165|issue=1|pages=1–8|doi=10.1016/S0019-1035(03)00172-6|bibcode=2003Icar..165....1L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mars's original D/H ratio, as estimated by deconvolving the atmospheric and magmatic D/H components in [[Mars meteorite|Martian meteorites]] (e.g., QUE 94201), is ×(1.9+/-0.25) the VSMOW value.&lt;ref name=Lunine2003/&gt; The higher D/H and impact modeling (significantly different from Earth due to Mars's smaller mass) favor a model where Mars accreted a total of 6% to 27% the mass of the current Earth hydrosphere, corresponding respectively to an original D/H between ×1.6 and ×1.2 the SMOW value.&lt;ref name = Lunine2003/&gt; The former enhancement is consistent with roughly equal asteroidal and cometary contributions, while the latter would indicate mostly asteroidal contributions.&lt;ref name=Lunine2003/&gt; The corresponding WEG would be {{convert|0.6-2.7|km|abbr=on}}, consistent with a 50% outgassing efficiency to yield ~{{convert|500|m|abbr=on}} WEG of surface water.&lt;ref name = Lunine2003/&gt; Comparing the current atmospheric D/H ratio of ×5.5 SMOW ratio with the primordial ×1.6 SMOW ratio suggests that ~{{convert|50|m|abbr=on}} of has been lost to space via [[solar wind]] stripping.&lt;ref name=Lunine2003/&gt;

The cometary and asteroidal delivery of water to accreting Earth and Mars has significant caveats, even though it is favored by D/H isotopic ratios.&lt;ref name=Drake2005/&gt; Key issues include:&lt;ref name=Drake2005/&gt;

# The higher D/H ratios in Martian meteorites could be a consequence of biased sampling since Mars may have never had an effective [[crustal recycling]] process
# Earth's Primitive Upper Mantle estimate of the &lt;sup&gt;187&lt;/sup&gt;Os/&lt;sup&gt;188&lt;/sup&gt;Os isotopic ratio exceeds 0.129, significantly greater than that of carbonaceous chondrites, but similar to anhydrous ordinary chondrites. This makes it unlikely that planetary embryos compositionally similar to carbonaceous chondrites supplied water to Earth
# Earth's atmospheric content of Ne is significantly higher than would be expected had all the rare gases and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O been accreted from planetary embryos with carbonaceous chondritic compositions.&lt;ref name = Morbidelli2000/&gt;

An alternative to the cometary and asteroidal delivery of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O would be the accretion via physisorption during the formation of the terrestrial planets in the [[solar nebula]]. This would be consistent with the thermodynamic estimate of around two Earth masses of [[water vapor]] within 3AU of the solar accretionary disk, which would exceed by a factor of 40 the mass of water needed to accrete the equivalent of 50 Earth hydrospheres (the most extreme estimate of Earth's bulk H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O content) per terrestrial planet.&lt;ref name = Drake2005/&gt; Even though much of the nebular H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(g) may be lost due to the high temperature environment of the accretionary disk, it is possible for physisorption of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O on accreting grains to retain nearly three Earth hydrospheres of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O at {{convert|500|K|C F}} temperatures.&lt;ref name = Drake2005/&gt; This adsorption model would effectively avoid the &lt;sup&gt;187&lt;/sup&gt;Os/&lt;sup&gt;188&lt;/sup&gt;Os isotopic ratio disparity issue of distally-sourced H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. However, the current best estimate of the nebular D/H ratio spectroscopically estimated with Jovian and Saturnian atmospheric CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is only 2.1×10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;, a factor of 8 lower than Earth's VSMOW ratio.&lt;ref name = Drake2005/&gt; It is unclear how such a difference could exist, if physisorption were indeed the dominant form of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O accretion for Earth in particular and the terrestrial planets in general.
