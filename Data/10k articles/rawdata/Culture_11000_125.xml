'''''Anglo-Saxon Deviant Burial Customs''''' is an [[archaeology|archaeological]] study of atypical [[burial]] practices in [[Anglo-Saxon England]]. It was written by the English archaeologist [[Andrew Reynolds (archaeologist)|Andrew Reynolds]] of the [[UCL Institute of Archaeology]], based on the work which he had undertaken for his [[PhD]], completed in 1998. The book was first published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 2009 as a part of their series on "Medieval History and Archaeology", edited by [[John Blair (historian)|John Blair]] and [[Helena Hamerow]].

The book has been acknowledged as providing archaeological data to back up the historical records regarding Medieval European beliefs in the undead.

==Background==
Reynolds' investigation into Anglo-Saxon deviant burials emerged from his PhD thesis, which he undertook at the Institute of Archaeology, University College London, and completed in 1998. He decided not to publish his findings immediately afterward, because more information on this issue was coming to light as a result of further excavation. From 2002 to 2003, Reynolds undertook a year of study leave to undertake new research in this area.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rey09|Reynolds 2009]]. p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

|quote     = "In the pre-Christian centuries Early Anglo-Saxon communities arguably marked the burials of people considered somehow different, and perhaps dangerous to the living, in distinctive ways, and certain of these locally determined but widely understood modes of treating social 'others' can be observed to continue until the nineteenth century in England. A further argument of this book is that it is possible to observe a gradual process whereby local practices for marking out wrongdoers and others of whom their peers were wary came under increasing influence of emerging political authorities, namely kings and their councillors."

}}
The first chapter, "Sources, approaches, and contexts", takes an interdisciplinary approach by examining the literary evidence from the Anglo-Saxon period regarding the execution and burial of those "individuals deemed social outcasts and even feared among the living for their malevolent qualities." Reynolds examines the references to punishment for deviancy within the Anglo-Saxon law codes, before looking at the evidence from charters and place-names referring to places of execution and burial sites.{{sfn|Reynolds|2009|pp=1&amp;ndash;33}}

Chapter two, "Burials, bodies and beheadings", focuses on the archaeological evidence for deviant burials in Anglo-Saxon England, identifying eight specific causes for such funerary deposits: victims of battles, judicial executions, massacres, murder, plague, sacrifice and suicide. For each of these, Reynolds looks at the archaeological evidence that these would each leave behind, before attempting to identify any Anglo-Saxon grave sites that fit into these categories.{{sfn|Reynolds|2009|pp=35&amp;ndash;60}}

In the third chapter, "Social deviants in a pagan society", Reynolds looks at the evidence for deviant burial practices from the fifth to the eighth centuries. Dismissing ideas that crouched, multiple, and shallow burials could be considered "deviant", he examines prone inhumations, decapitated and amputated bodies, and corpses with evidence of stoning, suggesting that these are best categorised as examples of deviant burial.{{sfn|Reynolds|2009|pp=61&amp;ndash;95}}

==Reception and reviews==

===Academic reviews===
Catherine Hills of the [[University of Cambridge]] positively reviewed Reynolds' book for the journal ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]'', announcing it to be a "significant contribution" to the study of both Anglo-Saxon England and of the archaeology of burial and justice. She noted that Reynold's ideas appeared "less novel" than they should be because he had already presented many of his conclusions in published papers and talks, and that the tome contains a number of traces betraying its origins as a doctoral dissertation. Ultimately noting that its last two chapters represent "an impressive piece of scholarship", she considers his arguments to be "persuasive and original".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hil0|Hills 2010]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Reynold's work reviewed a more critical review in ''[[The English Historical Review]]'', authored by Tom Lambert of [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sid.cam.ac.uk/aboutus/people/person.html?crsid=tbl25&lt;/ref&gt; Lambert noted that he wished that clearer diagrams had been included in the section where Reynolds discusses family plots, and went on to criticise the book for what he argued was a circular argument, that Reynolds uses "his handlist to argue for the very criteria that were used to construct it." Lambert argued that the fifth chapter was unable to unite the separate analysis into a "coherent whole" and that, despite "some interesting ideas", Reynolds' ultimate conclusion was rushed and "inexplicably terse". Summing up his review, Lambert noted that this was an "important book" which represented a "necessary and stimulating" read, but that its flaws meant that it had to be read "very carefully".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lam12|Lambert 2012]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wider influence===
Writing a review of [[Claude Lecouteux]]'s book ''The Return of the Dead'' for the journal ''Preternature'', Stephen Gordon of the [[University of Manchester]] made reference to Reynold's book, noting that he "devotes considerable attention to the relationship between the revenant narratives and unusual burial practices", in this way providing supporting evidence for many of Lecouteux's claims.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gor12|Gordon 2012]]. p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reynolds' ideas were also positively discussed in the paper "[[Signals of Belief in Early England#Sanmark' "Living On"|Living On: Ancestors and the Soul]]", authored by Alexandra Sanmark, a Post Doctoral Research Associate at the Millennium Institute Centre for Nordic Studies and Lecturer at the [[University of Western Australia]]'s Department of History. Published in the anthology ''[[Signals of Belief in Early England]]'' (2010), co-edited by Sanmark, Sarah Semple and [[Martin Carver]], Sanmark noted that Reynold's work provided good archaeological evidence for a belief in the malevolent dead in Early Medieval England.&lt;ref&gt;[[#San10|Sanmark 2010]]. pp. 172&amp;ndash;174.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anti-Canadianism''' is hostility towards the [[Government of Canada|government]], [[Culture of Canada|culture]], or [[Demographics of Canada|people]] of [[Canada]].

==Historical==
[[Voltaire]] reputedly joked that Canada was "[[a few acres of snow]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.ca/Bastards-Boneheads-Canadas-Glorious-Leaders/dp/1550547372/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1462992518&amp;sr=8-1-fkmr0&amp;keywords=Bastards+%2526+Boneheads%253A+Our+Glorious+Leaders%252C+Past+and+Present|title=Bastards &amp; Boneheads: Canada's Glorious Leaders Past and Present|last=Ferguson|first=Will|date=1999-10-01|publisher=Douglas &amp; Mcintyre|isbn=9781550547375|location=Vancouver|language=English|author-link=Will Ferguson}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was in fact referring to [[New France]] as it existed in the 18th century. The quote meant that New France was economically worthless and that [[France]] thus did not need to keep it. Many Canadians believe Voltaire's statement to be more an indictment of conquest in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=le Branchu|first=Jean-Yves|date=June 1937|title=The French Colonial Empire and the Popular Front Government|jstor=2750594|journal=Pacific Affairs|volume=10|issue=2|pages=125–135|doi=10.2307/2750594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{See also|Canada–United States relations}}
In the [[United States]], Canada is often a target of [[Conservatism|conservative]] and [[right-wing]] commentators who hold the nation up as an example of what a government and society that are too [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] would look like.

"'''Soviet Canuckistan'''" (full name being The Peoples' Republic of Soviet Canuckistan) is an [[epithet]] for Canada, used by [[Pat Buchanan]] on October 31, 2002, on his [[television]] show on [[MSNBC]] in which he denounced Canadians as [[anti-Americanism|anti-American]] and the country as a haven for [[terrorism|terrorists]]. He was reacting to Canadian criticisms of US security measures regarding [[Arab Canadians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p_-l1GyQ1gYC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=soviet+canuckistan+arab+canadians&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_tPEvTjaRt&amp;sig=Pp1-mrAzmqrEOVMin_7Ua_nXLjY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiLy-mP29LMAhVH0mMKHQ3mChEQ6AEIQzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=soviet%2520canuckistan%2520arab%2520canadians&amp;f=false|title=Bomb Canada: And Other Unkind Remarks in the American Media|last=Allan|first=Chantal|date=2009|publisher=Athabasca University Press|isbn=9781897425497|pages=84–85|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buchanan has a history of unflattering references to Canada, having said in 1990 that if Canada were to break apart due to the failure of the [[Meech Lake Accord]], "America would pick up the pieces."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/pat-buchanistan/article757550/|title=Pat Buchanistan|date=2002-11-02|website=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said two years after that "for most Americans, Canada is sort of like a case of latent arthritis. We really don't think about it, unless it acts up."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MfmtAwAAQBAJ|title=Is That Mic Off?: More Things Politicians Wish They Hadn't Said|last=Mason|first=Phil|last2=Parris|first2=Matthew|date=2012-10-22|publisher=Biteback Publishing|isbn=9781849544818|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of Canada's refusal to participate in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], as well as its turning down of the [[National Missile Defence in Canada|Missile Defense Plan (CMDP)]], conservative commentators [[Ann Coulter]] and [[Tucker Carlson]] have become prominent American critics of Canadian policies. Coulter has during interviews proposed extreme solutions to Canadian dissent, even military invasion, and has said that Canada should be grateful that the US "allows" it to exist on the same continent,&lt;ref&gt;''Hannity &amp; Colmes'', Fox News Channel, December 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; while Carlson has mocked that "without the US, Canada is essentially Honduras, only less interesting".&lt;ref&gt;''Wolf Blitzer Reports'', CNN. November 30, 2004. Quoted in ''Bomb Canada: And Other Unkind Remarks in the American Media'', Chantal Allan, Athabasca University Press, November 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, right-wing American strategist [[Paul Weyrich]] said Canadians are "so liberal and hedonistic" that they have a philosophy of "[[cultural Marxism]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/canadians-liberal-and-hedonistic-but-can-change-u-s-right-winger-says-1.624037|title=Canadians 'liberal and hedonistic' but can change, U.S. right-winger says|date=2006-01-27|website=CBC News|access-date=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a panel of commentators on the [[Fox News Channel]] talk show ''[[Red Eye with Greg Gutfeld#The Canadian Military|Red Eye with Greg Gutfeld]]'' satirically mocked the [[Canadian Forces|Canadian military]] for avoiding war, sparking outrage in Canada, which had troops on [[NATO War in Afghanistan|active combat duty in Afghanistan]] from 2001 to 2011 and has since transitioned to a training role. The host of the show later apologized for his remarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/fox-host-apologizes-for-mocking-of-canadian-forces-1.801729|title=Fox host apologizes for mocking of Canadian Forces|date=2009-03-23|publisher=[[CBC News]]|accessdate=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saudi Arabia===

Amid a diplomatic row between Saudi Arabia and Canada, there has been an apparent smear campaign targeting Canada in Saudi media. An Al-Arabiya segment accused Canada of 'human rights abuses'. In august, a pro government media outlet uploaded a controversial photo which depicted an air Canada airliner heading towards the CN tower with the words "sticking ones nose where it doesn't belong". The post was later taken down and accompanied with an apology, and the account was shut down. &lt;ref&gt; [https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/saudi-arabias-bizarre-propaganda-campaign-against-canada] &lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
{{See also|Brazil–Canada relations}}
Anti-Canadian sentiment has been observed in [[Brazil]]. People boycotted Canadian goods to protest a Canadian ban of Brazilian beef imports, reportedly because of fears of [[mad-cow disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/feb/14/business/fi-25160|title=Brazil Ranchers, Ports Boycott Canadian Imports|last=Smith|first=Jeremy|date=2001-02-14|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few Brazilians believed the Canadian ban was motivated by a trade dispute between the two nations. Canada's subsidies to aircraft manufacturer [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]] and Brazil's subsidies to Bombardier's Brazilian rival [[Embraer]] have been a source of much tension because they are said to interfere with each other's business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Westervelt|first=Robert|date=2001-02-28|title=Potash Firms Caught in Brazil-Canada Trade War|url=http://www.chemweek.com/articles/2001/02/28/094.html|journal=Chemical Week|volume=163|issue=9|page=16|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2016-05-11|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palestine===
During a 2015 visit to the region, then Canadian foreign Minister John Baird under the government of Stephen Harper was accosted by protesters, who opposed his strong support for Israel, pelted eggs and shoes at him and his convoy and heckled him with disparaging remarks. &lt;ref&gt; [https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/01/18/palestinian-protesters-throw-eggs-shoes-at-john-baird.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Some hostility towards Canada as a nation can be seen within Canada itself, most prominently by [[Quebec nationalists]].

====Quebec====

Anti-Canadianism in the [[Francophone]] province of [[Quebec]] has its roots originally stemming from the resentment since the [[French and Indian War|conquest]] of [[New France]] by [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] in 1760, even before the official existence as entities of Canada and Quebec themselves. However, after the [[Constitution Act, 1867]], which officially proclaimed a Canadian Confederation, creating "one Dominion under the name of Canada" (Dominion of Canada) on July 1, 1867, with four provinces: Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, which marked the separate existence and de facto independence and de jure evolutionary independence of Canada, these sentiments developed into Anti-Canadianism. Anti-Canadianism is sometimes intertwined with [[Quebec nationalism]].

From the invasion of New France in the 1760s and the formation of the Dominion of Canada in 1867 until the [[Quiet Revolution]] of the 1960s, the [[economy of Quebec]] and its high-ranking positions were controlled by the [[Anglo-Quebecer|English minority in Quebec]], who were always a small minority comprising less than 10% throughout Quebec's post–Royal French Canadian history and who used to be mostly [[unilingual]] English speakers, despite the Francophone [[French-speaking Quebecer|Québécois]]' comprising more than 80% of the province's population.  This led nationalist thinkers to denounce a [[Colonialism|colonial]] phenomenon that, as they believed, was at work between Quebec and the rest of Canada; some hold that residuals of this are still there in the present relationship.  Journalist [[Normand Lester]] published three volumes of ''[[The Black Book of English Canada]]'' detailing events of [[Canadian history]] he saw as being crimes perpetrated by the majority on the minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Black Book of English Canada|last=Lester|first=Normand|date=2002-10-22|publisher=McClelland &amp; Stewart|isbn=9780771022593|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quebec, whose sole official language is [[French language|French]] since 1974, has introduced and implemented laws since the 1970s, especially with the adoption of the comprehensive [[Charter of the French Language]] Law in 1977 that limits the visibility of English on non-official signs. Commercial signs in languages other than French (especially targeting those in English) have been permitted only if French is given marked prominence in size. This law has been the subject of periodic controversy since its inception. While the architects and advocates of the Charter of the French Language Law argue that it was adopted to promote and protect the French language, critics argue that it is anti-English Canadian in its purpose by rooting out the English language from all spheres in Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uW2rM_6I3gMC|title=The English Language in Canada: Status, History and Comparative Analysis|last=Boberg|first=Charles|date=2010-08-26|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139491440|page=9|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the charter's articles stipulates that all children under 16 must receive their primary and secondary education in French schools, unless one of the child's parents has received most of their education in English, in Canada, or the child themselves has already received a substantial part of their education in English, in Canada. Access to elementary and secondary English language schools by non-anglophone immigrants have also been limited with this law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://canadafreepress.com/article/time-for-the-nation-of-quebec-to-leave-canada|title=Time for the NATION of Quebec to leave Canada|last=Field|first=Dick|date=2008-03-11|website=canadafreepress.com|access-date=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lucien Bouchard]] said that Canada wasn't a "real country", sparking outrage across Canada. He later apologized for the remark.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joyal |first=Serge |date=Fall 2000 |title=Bill C-20 and the sovereignty of the people |url=http://sen.parl.gc.ca/sjoyal/e/articles/C-20%2520and%2520the%2520sov_people_citélibre.html |journal=Cité Libre |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=97–100 |doi= |pmid= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727041949/http://sen.parl.gc.ca/sjoyal/e/articles/C-20%20and%20the%20sov_people_cit%C3%A9libre.html |archive-date=2011-07-27 |access-date= |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Newfoundland====

Many in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] harbour an ambivalent attitude towards Canada. Many blame the federation for economic difficulties experienced since the dominion joined confederation in 1949. Some Newfoundlanders perceive a disrespectful attitude toward them from the rest of Canada, and [[Newfie]] stereotypes and [[ethnic jokes]] that depict Newfoundlanders as stupid and/or lazy are a source of ire. There is also a fear that Newfoundland culture and [[Newfoundland English]] are diminishing&lt;!-- AUTHOR'S PERSONAL OPINION?  and will disappear because of insensitivity and ignorance from the rest of Canada--&gt;. Former Newfoundland premier [[Danny Williams (politician)|Danny Williams]] notably ordered all Canadian flags removed from provincial buildings during a dispute with the federal government in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/maple-leaf-flags-removed-in-offshore-feud-1.494970|title=Maple Leaf flags removed in offshore feud|date=2004-12-23|website=[[CBC News]]|access-date=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams was, and remains, personally popular in Newfoundland, at times receiving as much as 85% support in polls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2008/03/07/tories-poll.html|title=Williams, PCs still dominate landscape, latest poll finds|date=2008-03-07|website=[[CBC News]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312074929/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2008/03/07/tories-poll.html|archive-date=2008-03-12|access-date=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====First Nations====
As for [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]], some [[First Nations]] people call Canada an illegal nation state built on stolen land {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}. One term used by some Indigenous activists for non-indigenous residents of Canada is "[[settlers]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstnations.eu/indian_land.htm First Nations]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Political accusations====
Sometimes Canadians accuse each other of being anti-Canadian:  For example, [[Manitoba]] [[Premier of Manitoba|Premier]] [[Gary Doer]] ([[New Democratic Party of Canada|NDP]]) accused the governments of [[Ontario]] and [[Alberta]] of being "anti-Canadian" due to their dislike for [[equalization payment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://calsun.canoe.ca/News/Columnists/Byfield_Link/2006/06/16/1635485.html|title=Far from equal|last=Byfield|first=Link|date=2006-06-16|website=The Calgary Sun|archive-url=https://archive.is/20061003130236/http://calsun.canoe.ca/News/Columnists/Byfield_Link/2006/06/16/1635485.html|archive-date=2006-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====From the political right=====
Some anti-Canadian criticism from a few in the right of the political spectrum is coupled with proposals that the province of [[Alberta]] [[Alberta separatism|secede from the country]] to form a new nation, either on its own or with other [[Western Canada|Western provinces]]. A separatist party obtained more than one tenth of the vote in the [[Alberta general election, 1982|1982 Alberta general election]] although no other separatist party in Western Canada has obtained a similar share of the vote in a provincial election before or since 1982.

An example of conservative anti-Canadianism arose in 1997 when [[Stephen Harper]], who was at the time vice-president of the conservative lobby group the [[National Citizens Coalition]], stated he believed "Canada is a Northern European welfare state in the worst sense of the term, and very proud of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thetyee.ca/News/2011/03/23/StephenHarpersEyes/|title=Canada through Stephen Harper's Eyes|last=Harper|first=Stephen|date=2011-03-23|website=The Tyee|language=English|access-date=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speech was made to members of the American conservative think tank the [[Council for National Policy]]. In the years since, claims have been made both that Harper's words were heartfelt, and that they were not, and that he was embellishing for the benefit of his audience. Harper himself dismissed the comments when they were cited by the centre-left [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] in [[negative campaigning|attack ads]] against him during the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 Canadian federal election]], saying that they were meant as humour, not serious analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Riley, "Harper's suspect evolution", 16 December 2005, A18.&lt;/ref&gt; (Harper became [[prime minister of Canada]] in 2006.)

Conservative activists [[Steven Crowder]], [[David Frum]], [[Jamie Glazov]], [[Ezra Levant]] and [[Mark Steyn]] have repeatedly criticized Canada's policies.

=====From the political left=====
Some [[communist]] organizations in Canada view a Canadian nationalist or isolationist line as [[Marxist revisionism|revisionist]], anti-communist and anti-[[internationalism (politics)|internationalist]]. They believe the communist view of the national question in Canada should be [[internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] and consider that other nationalities exist within the nation-state, such as the [[French-speaking Quebecer|Québécois]], [[First Nations]] and [[Acadian]] peoples; as well as the borders being artificial boundaries put in place during the colonial period and held in place under capitalism. These views are usually held by [[Maoist]], [[Trotskyite]] and other [[revolutionary]] groups that tend not to participate in mainstream activities such as [[elections]]. Such alternative views can be viewed as anti-Canadianism by more nationalist tendencies on both the left and right.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Anti-Canadianism and humour==
Humorous anti-Canadianism often focuses on broadly known attributes of Canada and Canadians such as cold weather or [[publicly-funded health care|public health care]],&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Canadian Bacon (film)|Canadian Bacon]]'' for jokes about the weather and health care, and ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[The Bart Wants What It Wants]]" for jokes about Canadian health care&lt;/ref&gt; as the finer details of Canadian culture and politics are generally not well known outside Canada. The sport of [[curling]] is also treated with some irreverence in the United States and most of Europe. However, these broad targets are more accurately caricatured within Canada itself. The fact that others are perceived to know surprisingly little about Canada is a frequent theme in Canadian humour and such examples of self-deprecating humour are nearly universal among Canadian humorists. In keeping with this attitude, some genuinely critical anti-Canadianisms such as "Soviet Canuckistan" are embraced by some Canadians as humorous, in defiance of the original intent.

==In popular culture==
* "[[Blame Canada]]", a song from the film ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut]]'' in which the town's parents blame Canada for the trouble their children have been getting into, was nominated by the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]]. The song was generally understood to be using anti-Canadian statements as a parody, such as a perceived tendency toward [[scapegoating]] and the shirking of parental responsibility, rather than a statement of actual anti-Canadianism, as the singers end the song saying it is a good idea to blame Canada before someone blames them.
* "[[Canadian Idiot]]", by [["Weird Al" Yankovic]], a parody of the song "[[American Idiot (song)|American Idiot]]" by [[Green Day]], is a friendly send-up of Canadian stereotypes. The American character that "Weird Al" Yankovic plays in the song uses many common Canadian stereotypes, such as the statement by some that Canadians supposedly "[[Tim Hortons#A Canadian cultural fixture|live on doughnuts]] and moose meat". Near the end of the song, Weird Al Yankovic (through his character) proclaims that the United States should preemptively strike Canada, as he has no idea what they are up to.
* ''[[Canadian Bacon (film)|Canadian Bacon]]'', a film by [[Michael Moore]] starring Canadian [[John Candy]], also parodies anti-Canadianism, depicting a post-[[Cold War]] American president ([[Alan Alda]]) who provokes anti-Canadian sentiment in a gambit to produce an economic stimulus through a new Cold War and boost his poll numbers: the movie's tag line is "Surrender pronto, or we'll level Toronto." The movie makes heavy use of irony in driving home the message that many aspects of Canadian culture are superior to American culture, such as one scene in which an RCMP jailer writes heartfelt letters to ex-inmates, and another in which a crew led by the Sheriff of Niagara Falls, New York (played by Candy), "attacks" Canada by spreading litter in a public park.
* "[[The Canada Song]]", a song from the movie-mocking TV show ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', features Mike and Crow singing about Canada's perceived failings while Tom Servo attempts to persuade them that Canada should be praised, not mocked. Eventually, Mike and Crow convince Servo to join in the Canada-bashing, which he does with a gusto that alarms the other two.
* In the fourth-season episode "[[Little Minnesota]]" of the American [[sitcom]] ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', Marshall takes Robin (a Canadian) to a Minnesota themed bar in which she discovers that Minnesotans believe that all Canadians suffer from [[nyctophobia]] (fear of darkness).
* An episode of the 13th and final season of ''[[King of the Hill]]'' titled "Uh-Oh, Canada" showed a Canadian family living in Texas for the summer who act condescending toward American society and show no appreciation for Hank Hill and his friends' efforts to welcome them, which soon culminates into outright insults hurled at both societies. The episode drew criticism when broadcast in Canada. The same episode had an antithetical subplot where Boomhauer, who is spending the summer in Canada, acculturates to his new surroundings and is gracious to an attractive French-Canadian woman who welcomes him (also starting a relationship with her).

An '''assignment cover sheet''' is a paper used by [[student]]s when completing [[assignment (education)|assignment]]s at [[university]] for their courses. These coversheets generally contain [[metadata]] about the assignment (such as the name of the student and the course number). This aids the efficient handling of assignments. Other types of data may be included, depending on the needs of the course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mendota.english.wisc.edu/~WAC/page.jsp?id=44&amp;c_type=category&amp;c_id=27 |title=Integrating Writing Into Your Course |author= |date= |work=University of Wisconsin (Madison) |accessdate=October 7, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some universities require and/or provide cover sheets in standardized formats. These are often in the form of computer files which a student can download, print, and personalize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assessment.illinoisstate.edu/generaleducation/coversheet.shtml |title=Student Assignment CoverSheet |author= |date= |work=Illinois State University |accessdate=October 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127035002/http://assessment.illinoisstate.edu/generaleducation/coversheet.shtml |archivedate=November 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unisa.edu.au/ltu/students/study/assessment/use_coversheet.asp |title=Using the assignment cover sheet |author= |date=June 10, 2010 |work=University of South Australia |accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.monash.edu.au/students/current/resources/assigncoversheet.html |title=Assignment cover sheet |author= |date= |work=Monash University |accessdate=October 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219020616/http://www.education.monash.edu.au/students/current/resources/assigncoversheet.html |archivedate=February 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Caraceni''' was founded in [[Rome]] in 1913 by the father of Italian tailoring, Domenico Caraceni. At one point in the 1930s, Domenico and his family operated ateliers in Rome, Milan and Paris. The Paris atelier was operated by Domenico's brother, Augusto, who closed his atelier when Mussolini declared war on France.

Today, there are several businesses going by the name "Caraceni" in operation. The original shop operates out of a small location in Rome with a very small workforce. This is run by Tommy and Giulio Caraceni, nephews of Domenico. There are three branches in Milan, all founded by offshoots of the clan, one even claiming to be the "real Caraceni."  However, the cognoscenti consider A. Caraceni, currently operated by Mario Caraceni (son of Augusto) to be the best of the Milan branches.  These suits are what is known as "bench bespoke," meaning they are made one at a time, by hand, to a pattern specifically drawn for each individual customer.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/caraceni-domenico-bespoke-tailor-rome/&lt;/ref&gt;

Gianni Campagna, once an apprentice at Sartoria Domenico Caraceni in Milan, acquired the Sartoria Domenico Caraceni label in 1998. Under this name, his company makes expensive made-to-measure suits out of the Palazzo Bernasconi in [[Milan]]. This business is separate from and not affiliated with the other Caraceni bespoke ateliers in Rome and Milan.

==Notable clients==
The various Caraceni "sartorias" have crafted handmade [[Suit (clothes)|suits]] for various celebrities over the years, including [[Tyrone Power]], [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[Gary Cooper]], [[Cary Grant]], [[Yves Saint-Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]], [[Gianni Agnelli]], [[Sophia Loren]] and fashion designer [[Valentino Garavani]]. The Caraceni label is also famous for dressing generations of The Kings of [[Greece]] and Italy, The Prince of [[Wales]], [[Rainier III, Prince of Monaco|Prince Rainier of Monaco]], Italian Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]] and [[Aristotle Onassis]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.permanentstyle.com/2014/07/a-caraceni-bespoke-tailor-milan.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''comedy club''' is a venue—typically a [[nightclub]], [[bar (establishment)|bar]], [[casino]], or [[restaurant]]—where people watch or listen to performances, including [[stand-up comedian]]s, improvisational [[comedian]]s, [[impersonator]]s, [[impressionist]]s, [[magic (illusion)|magicians]], [[ventriloquist]]s, and other comedy acts. The term "comedy club" usually refers to venues that feature stand-up comedy, as distinguished from [[improvisational theatre]]s, which host improv or sketch comedy, and variety clubs (which may also host musical acts).

==Types of comedy clubs==
Comedy clubs are usually broken down by comedians into "A rooms", "B rooms", and "C rooms":
*A rooms usually cater to people with movie deals, people with television shows, and generally well known acts.
*B rooms are where the best aspects of both A rooms and C rooms meet. Young comics need B rooms as a stepping stone. These are rooms where someone doing a 10- to 15-minute set (hosting/MCing) can be asked, after they've been going up long enough, to do a 20-minute set (featuring) and so on. These clubs also typically allow dirtier material, since they can become established names for "dirty" comedy or shows that usually cover adult themes.
*C rooms act as "neighborhood" comedy clubs, for the most part. The headliners are not usually very well known or popular, and the audiences are random walk-ins.

{{Culture of Indonesia}}
'''Dance in Indonesia'''  ({{lang-id|Tarian Indonesia}}) reflects the country's diversity of [[Ethnic groups in Indonesia|ethnicities]] and [[Culture of Indonesia|cultures]]. There are more than 700 ethnic groups in Indonesia: [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] roots and [[Melanesia]]n tribal forms are visible, and influences ranging from neighbouring Asian and even western styles through colonisation. Each ethnic group has their own dances; makes total dances in Indonesia are more than 3,000 Indonesian original dances. The old traditions of dance and drama are being preserved in the many dance schools which flourish not only in the courts but also in the modern, government-run or supervised art academies.&lt;ref name="Folk Dances"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indonesia-tourism.com/general/theatre.html |work=Indonesia Tourism| title=The Indonesian Folk Dances}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For classification purpose, the dances of Indonesia can be divided according to several aspects. In historical aspect it can be divided into three eras; the prehistoric-tribal era, the Hindu-Buddhist era and the era of Islam. According to its patrons, it can be divided into two genres; court dance and folk dance. In its tradition, Indonesian dances can be divided into two types; traditional dance and contemporary dance.

In [[Bali]] on 19 November 2011 [[UNESCO]] announced the traditional [[Saman dance]] from [[Aceh]] province as a world intangible cultural heritage. Saman dance is unique due to the speed of movement and harmony between dancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UNESCO to recognize Aceh`s Saman dance|date=19 April 2011 |author=Andi Abdussalam |newspaper=Antara News.com |url=http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/70434/unesco-to-recognize-acehs-saman-dance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to their contact with the outer world the people of the Indonesian archipelago had already developed their own styles of dancing, still somewhat preserved by those who resist outside influences and choose tribal life in the interior of [[Sumatra]] (example: [[Batak (Indonesia)|Batak]], [[Nias]], [[Mentawai people|Mentawai]]), of Kalimantan/[[Borneo]] (example: [[Dayak people|Dayak]], Punan, Iban), of [[Java]] (example: Badui), of [[Sulawesi]] (example: [[Toraja]], [[Minahasa]]), of the [[Moluccan Islands]] and of [[Papua province|Papua]] (example: Dani, Amungme).

Dances in Indonesia are believed by many scholars to have had their beginning in rituals and religious worship.&lt;ref name="Folk Dances"/&gt; Such dances are usually based on rituals, like the war dances, the dance of [[witch doctor]]s, and dance to call for rain or any agricultural related rituals such as [[Hudoq]] dance ritual of Dayak people. War dances such as [[cakalele]] of Maluku and [[kabasaran]] dance of Minahasa, North Sulawesi. Others are inspired by nature, such as the ''Tari Merak'' (Peafowl dance) of [[West Java]]. Ancient forms are usually characterised by repetitive movements like the ''Tor-Tor'' dance of the [[Batak people]] of ([[North Sumatra]]). The dancing also is meant to let the human's inner spirit come out, and also to calm or appease the spirits. Some of the tribal dances involving [[trance]] mental condition which interpreted as channelling the spirits through the dancer's body movements. ''Tari Sanghyang Dedari'' is a special dance of [[Bali]], in which the dancers are pre-pubescent girls in trance, chasing away bad spirits. The dance of [[Kuda Lumping|kuda lumping]] and [[keris]] dance also involve trance.

===The Hindu-Buddhist Era===
[[File:Ramayana Java.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lakshmana]], [[Rama]] and [[Sita|Shinta]] in [[Ramayana]] ballet at [[Prambanan]], Java.]]
With the advent of Dharmic religions in Indonesia, Hinduism and Buddhism were celebrated in ritual and in art. Although the poem originates in India, [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]] epic has long been adopted by the Javanese people. Etchings of the story can be found on temples dating back to 10th century CE, and has since then played a recurring role in ancient Javanese literature as well as [[wayang]] shows.&lt;ref name="JG-Drupadi"&gt;{{cite news|title=A Tribute to the Female ‘Force’|newspaper=Jakarta Globe|url=http://jakartaglobe.beritasatu.com/features/tribute-female-force/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They incorporated stories of the Ramayana, Mahabharata and also [[Panji (prince)|Panji cycles]] into dance-drama, which is called ''sendratari'' (dance-drama) or sometimes simply translated as "ballet", such as [[Ramayana Ballet]] of Java and Bali. Highly stylised methods of dances were developed and are still obvious nowadays, especially in the islands of Java and Bali. The Javanese Ramayana dance-drama is regularly staged and performed in 9th century [[Prambanan]] temple compound, Yogyakarta; while its Balinese counterpart is also performed in various [[Balinese temple]]s throughout the island. The Javanese [[wayang wong]] dance-drama took stories from the episodes of Ramayana or Mahabharata Hindu epic. However, the dances are distinct to those of Indian. While hand gestures are still very important, Indonesian dancers do not have the Indian attention to [[mudra]]: instead the dances incorporated local forms. Javanese court dances stressed on graceful and slow movements while the dances of Balinese court are more dynamic and very expressive. The Javanese sacred ritual dance of [[Bedhaya]] has very gentle and elegant moves.&lt;ref name="JG-Drupadi"/&gt; It is believed to have its root in 14th century [[Majapahit]] court or probably earlier, which originated as ritual dance performed by virgins to worship [[Hindu deities|Indic deities]] such as [[Shiva]], [[Brahma]], and [[Vishnu]].

In Bali, dances has become the integral part of Hindu Balinese rituals. Experts believed that balinese dance derived from older dance tradition of Java. Friezes on East Javanese temples built during the 14th century show headdresses almost identical to those still being used for dances in Bali today. These represent a remarkable unbroken continuity of form at least 600 years old. Certain sacred dances are reserved and only performed during certain religious ceremony. Each Balinese dances have special functions, from sacred ritual dances performed only in [[Balinese temple]]s such as sacred [[sanghyang|sanghyang dedari]] and [[Barong (mythology)|Barong]] dance that involved trance, dance drama that retold the legends and popular stories such as [[legong]] and [[kecak]], to the dance for welcoming guests such as [[pendet]] or social youth dance such as [[joged]]. The [[topeng]] dance also popular in Java and Bali, it often took story from Panji tales, originated from 12th century [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri kingdom]]. The notable topeng dances are topeng Cirebon dance and topeng Bali dance. The Panji tales, telling the romance between Prince Panji Inu of the ancient Javanese kingdom of Jenggala with Princess Galuh Chandra Kirana of the neighboring kingdom of Kediri, continues to be a source of inspiration in both Javanese and Balinese dance traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Juxtaposing Indonesia’s Cultures Through Dance |newspaper=Jakarta Globe | url=http://jakartaglobe.beritasatu.com/features/juxtaposing-indonesias-cultures-dance/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Islamic Era===
[[File:KFT (Indonesia) performing in Jaca, España 02.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ratoh Duek]] dance performance from Aceh]]

Even as the new religion of Islam gradually penetrated the region, the native and dharmic dances continued to be popular. Artists and performers would still use the styles of the previous eras, making changes in stories (which took an Islamic turn) and clothing (which became more modest in respect of Islamic teachings). This change is obvious in ''Tari Persembahan'' from [[Jambi]]. The dancers are still adorned with the intricate gold of the Hindu/Buddhist era but the clothing is more modest.

The new era brought newer styles of dance: [[Zapin]] dances of the [[Malay people]] and Acehnese ''Tari Saman'' adopted dance styles and musics typical of [[Arabia]] and [[Persia]], and combined them with indigenous styles to form a newer generation of dance in the era of Islam. The adoption of Persian and Arab musical instruments, such as ''[[rebana]]'', ''[[tambur]]'', and ''[[gendang]]'' drums that has become the main instrument in Islamic dances, as well as chant that often quotes Islamic chants.

===Contemporary dances===
Known contemporary dancers from Indonesia was [[Bagong Kussudiardja]], which invented contemporary dance form inspired by the Javanese classical dance.

==Patrons==

===The court dances===
[[File:Tari Golek Ayun-Ayun 9.JPG|thumb|left|Golek Ayun-ayun, a Javanese court dance of [[Yogyakarta]]]]

The dances in Indonesia reflects its diverse and long history. Several royal houses; the [[istana]]s and [[keraton]]s still survived in some parts of Indonesia and become the haven of cultural conservation. The obvious difference between courtly dance and common folk dance traditions is the most evident in [[Javanese dance]]. Javanese stratified social class is reflected in its culture, where the upper noble class are more concentrated and deeply concern with refinement, spiritual and sophistication; while the commoners are usually more interested in entertainment and social value of the dance. As the result court dances are often have strict rules and disciplines preserved through generations, while folk dances are more liberated and open to any influences.

The royal patronage of arts and culture is often encouraged by the palace institution as the guardian of their traditions. For example, the Sultans of [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]] and Sunans of [[Surakarta]], also nobles of [[Pakualaman]] and [[Mangkunegaran]] are known to create various Javanese court dances completed with [[gamelan]] composition to accompanied the dance. For example, the Suryo Sumirat dance school of Mangkunegaran court, opened its doors to public and foreign students eager to learn the royal Javanese dance. The mission is to not only produce new royal dancers but also, more importantly, to preserve ancient royal dance.&lt;ref name="JG-Suryo"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Jakarta Globe|title=Keeping Tradition Alive, One Step at a Time |url=http://jakartaglobe.beritasatu.com/features/keeping-tradition-alive-one-step-at-a-time/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The palace court traditions also evident in Balinese and Malay court which usually— just like Java—imposed refinement and prestige. Sumatran Malay courtly culture such as the remnant of Aceh Sultanate, Deli Sultanate in North Sumatra, and South Sumatra Sultanate, are more influenced by Islamic culture, while Java and Bali are more deeply rooted in their Hindu-Buddhist heritage. The [[Palembang]] dance of [[Gending Sriwijaya]] for example, still demonstrating the Hindu-Buddhist elements of gilded ornaments, but compared to its Javanese counterpart, it is rendered in more covered and modest costume of ''Aesan Gede''.

===The folk dances===
[[File:Jaipongan Bunga Tanjung 03.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jaipongan]] Mojang Priangan, [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] traditional folk dance]]
The dance in Indonesia demonstrate the social complexity and the social stratifications of its people, it often reflect the social class and also degree of refinement. According to its patron, the folk dances were developed and fostered by common people, either in the villages or in the cities, in contrast of court dance that is developed through royal patronage. Indonesian folk dances are often relatively free from strict rules nor disciplines, although certain style of gestures, poses and movements are still preserved. The commoners folk dance is more concerned with social function and entertainment value than rituals.

The Javanese [[Ronggeng]] and [[Sundanese dance|Sundanese]] [[Jaipongan]] is the fine example of this common folk dance traditions. Both are social dances that are more for entertainment purpose than rituals. It often display movements that are considered inappropriate in refined courtly dances, as the result, the common folk dances were often mistakenly deemed too erotic or even too crude for court standard. However this traditions is alive and well in contemporary Indonesia since it is popular and supported by its people. Certain traditional folk dances has been developed into mass dance with simple but structurised steps and movements, such as Poco-poco dance from Minahasa [[North Sulawesi]], and Sajojo dance from [[Papua (province)|Papua]].

==Traditions==
[[File:Bali-Danse 0729a.jpg|thumb|right|[[Balinese people|Balinese]] temple dancer performing ''Sekar Jepun'' dance]]

===The traditional dance===
Traditional dance of Indonesia reflect the rich diversity of Indonesian people. The dance traditions in Indonesia; such as Balinese, Javanese, Sundanese, Minangkabau, Palembang, Malay, Aceh and many other dances traditions are age old traditions, yet also a living and dynamic traditions. Certain traditional dances might be centuries old, while some others might just created less than a decade ago. The creation of a new dance choreography but still within the frame of respected dance tradition and discipline is still possible. As the result, there is some ''kreasi baru'' (newly created) dances. The newly created dance could be the rediscovery and the revival of lost old traditions or a new interpretation, inspiration and exploration of traditional dances.

The Art Schools in Indonesia such as ''Sekolah Tinggi Seni Indonesia'' (STSI) in [[Bandung]], ''Institut Kesenian Jakarta'' (IKJ) in [[Jakarta]], ''Institut Seni Indonesia'' (ISI/Indonesian Art Institute) in [[Denpasar]], [[Yogyakarta]], and [[Surakarta]] all are fostering and encouraging their student to explore the dance traditions in Indonesia. Certain festival such as [[Bali Art Festival]] also known as the distinguished event for Balinese traditional dance choreographers to showcase their Balinese ''kreasi baru'' dances.

===The contemporary dance===
[[File:2011-06-05 TTF 05.jpg|thumb|left|Indonesian contemporary dance involved in a play performance.]]
Indonesian contemporary dance borrows influences from abroad, such as western [[ballet]] and [[modern dance]]. In 1954, two artists from Yogyakarta — Bagong Kusudiarjo and Wisnuwardhana — journeyed to the United States to study ballet and modern dance with a number of dance companies. When they returned to Indonesia in 1959 they brought with them a new artistic culture, which changed the face of movement and choreography and introduced the idea of individual expression to Indonesian dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Artistic Body Expression In Indonesian Society| work=Goethe Institut| url=https://www.goethe.de/ins/id/en/kul/mag/20446638.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of dance as individual expression and artistic exploration rejuvenate the tradition-based dance discipline of traditional Indonesia, through exposure to artists from a wide range of cultural and artistic backgrounds. Native traditional dance traditions often influenced the contemporary dance in Indonesia, such as traditional Javanese dance form, pose and poise often took place in contemporary dances performances.

International dance collaborations also possible and often took place, such as the collaboration of [[Noh]] [[Japanese dance]] with Balinese and Javanese dance theatre. Another example is the collaboration of two dance traditions, between Indonesian Balinese [[Legong]] dance and Indian [[Bharata Natyam]]. Legong and Bharata Natyam's similarities extend to more than its roots or spirituality. Both are joyful celebrations of life and a shared classical heritage of culture and dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Balinese and Indian Culture Dance Together| newspaper= Jakarta Globe |url=http://jakartaglobe.beritasatu.com/features/juxtaposing-balinese-and-indian-dances/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indonesian modern dance also showcased in Indonesian showbiz, such as the dance performance to accompany songs, music performances or entertainment. Today with rapid [[popular culture|pop culture]] influences from abroad, especially United States, urban teen dances such as [[street dance]]s also gain popularity among Indonesian youngsters.

'''Enochian''' is an [[Occultism|occult]] or angelic language recorded in the private journals of [[John Dee]] and his colleague [[Edward Kelley]] in late 16th-century England.&lt;ref&gt;{{gutenberg|no=19553|title=The Private Diary of Dr. John Dee by John Dee|bullet=none}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelley was a [[spirit medium]] who worked with Dee in his [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] investigations. The men claimed that the language was revealed to them by the [[Enochian angels]]. The language is integral to the practice of [[Enochian magic]]. The syntax and grammar of the Enochian language are highly similar to the [[English language]].&lt;ref name="Laycock p43"&gt;Laycock, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The language found in Dee's and Kelley's journals encompasses a limited textual corpus, only some of it with English translations. Several linguists, notably [[Donald Laycock]], have studied Enochian, and argue against any extraordinary features in the language.

Dee's journals did not describe the language as "Enochian", instead preferring descriptors like "Angelical", the "Celestial Speech", the "Language of Angels", the "First Language of God-Christ", the "Holy Language" or "[[Adamic language|Adamical]]" because, according to Dee's Angels, it was used by [[Adam]] in Paradise to name all things. The term "Enochian" comes from Dee's assertion that the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|Biblical Patriarch]] [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] had been the last human (before Dee and Kelley) to know the language.

==Dee's Angelic language==

According to Tobias Churton in his text ''The Golden Builders'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Churton, Tobias |title=The Golden Builders |publisher=Signal Publishing |year=2002 |isbn=0-9543309-0-0 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the concept of an Angelic or [[antediluvian]] language was common during Dee's time. If one could speak the language of Angels, it was believed one could directly interact with them.

In 1581, Dee mentioned in his personal journals that God had sent "good angels" to communicate directly with prophets. In 1582, Dee teamed up with the [[Clairvoyance|seer]] [[Edward Kelley]], although Dee had used several other seers previously.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Harkness, ''John Dee's Conversations with Angels'', 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt; With Kelley's help as a [[scryer]], Dee set out to establish lasting contact with the angels. Their work resulted, among other things, in the reception of the Enochian or Angelical language.

According to Dee's journals,&lt;ref&gt;Now in various collections of the British Library. See especially Sloane MSS 3188, 3189 and 3191, and Cotton Appendix XLVI. All the above are available in digital scans at: {{cite web |url=http://www.themagickalreview.org/enochian/mss/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230010212/http://www.themagickalreview.org/enochian/mss/ |archivedate=2011-12-30 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Angelical was supposed to have been the language God used to create the world, and which was later used by Adam to speak with God and the angels, and to name all things in existence. After his [[Fall from Paradise]], Adam lost the language and constructed a form of proto-[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] based upon his vague memory of Angelical. This proto-Hebrew, then, was the [[universal human language]] until the time of the Confusion of Tongues at the [[Tower of Babel]]. After this, all the various human languages were developed, including an even more modified Hebrew (which we know as "[[Biblical Hebrew]]"). From the time of Adam to the time of Dee and Kelley, Angelical was hidden from humans with the single exception of the patriarch Enoch who, according to the angels, recorded the "Book of Loagaeth" (Speech from God) for humanity. The book was then lost again in the [[Deluge of Noah]].

The reception of Enochian started on March 26, 1583, when Kelley reported visions in the crystal of the twenty-one lettered alphabet characteristic of the language. A few days later, Kelley started receiving what became the first corpus of texts in the purported Angelic language. This resulted in the book ''Liber Loagaeth'' ("Book [of] Speech from God"). The book consists of 49 great letter tables, or squares made of 49 by 49 letters (however, each table has a front and back side—making 98 49x49 tables in all).&lt;ref&gt;This book is now in the British Library, MS Sloane 3189.&lt;/ref&gt; Dee and Kelley said the angels never translated the texts in this book.

The other set of Enochian texts was received through Kelley about a year later, in [[Kraków]], where both alchemists stayed for some time at the court of King [[Stefan Batory]]. These come with English translations, thus providing the basis for the Enochian vocabulary. The texts comprise 48 poetic verses, which in Dee's manuscripts are called "Claves Angelicae", or "Angelic Keys". The Keys are assigned certain functions within the magical system. Dee was apparently intending to use these Keys to "open the 49 Gates of Wisdom/Understanding" represented by the 49 magic squares in ''Liber Loagaeth'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am therefore to instruct and inform you, according to your Doctrine delivered, which is contained in 49 Tables. In 49 voices, or callings: which are the Natural Keys to open those, not 49 but 48 (for one is not to be opened) Gates of Understanding, whereby you shall have knowledge to move every Gate…&lt;ref&gt;The angel Nalvage, cited in Casaubon ed., ''A True and Faithful Relation…'', p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;
:—The angel Nalvage&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;But you shall understand that these 19 Calls are the Calls, or entrances into the knowledge of the mystical Tables.  Every Table containing one whole leaf, whereunto you need no other circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;The angel Illemese, cited in Casaubon ed., ''A True and Faithful Relation…'', p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;
:—The angel Illemese&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While these texts contain most of the vocabulary, dozens of further words are found hidden throughout Dee's journals, and thousands of undefined words are contained in the ''Liber Loagaeth''.

== Alphabet ==
The Enochian script is written from right to left, and may include [[diacritic|diacritical marks]]. Different documents have slightly different forms of the script. Some of the letter names are pronounced as they would be in English, but many are pronounced differently. The Enochian letters have English letter equivalents.&lt;ref name="alphabet"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Angelic or Enochian Alphabet |url=http://www.themagickalreview.org/enochian/alphabet.php |publisher=The Magickal Review |year=2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712100049/http://www.themagickalreview.org/enochian/alphabet.php |archivedate=2011-07-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of different fonts for the Enochian alphabet are available, which use the English letter equivalents to access the Enochian glyphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Enochian Materials |url=http://www.themagickalreview.org/enochian/ |publisher=The Magickal Review |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826140151/http://www.themagickalreview.org/enochian/ |archivedate=2007-08-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gerald J.

== Sceptical and linguistic evaluations ==
[[scientific skepticism|Sceptics]]{{who|date=June 2017}} have pointed to this discrepancy{{what|date=June 2014}} between the two revealed sets of Enochian texts as an indication that Enochian is not a consistent language.&lt;ref&gt;See Donald Laycock, "Enochian: Angelic language or mortal folly?", 19–64 in ''The Complete Enochian Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, it has been noted, especially by the Australian linguist [[Donald Laycock]], that the texts in the Loagaeth material show phonetic features that do not generally appear in natural languages.&lt;ref&gt;Laycock, "Enochian: Angelic language or mortal folly?", p.33.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, the features shown are commonly found in instances of [[glossolalia|glossolalia ("speaking in tongues")]], suggesting that Kelley actually produced at least this set of writings this way{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}.

Building on Laycock's linguistic analysis, skeptics{{who|date=June 2017}} also point out that there are even problems with holding that the texts of the Enochian keys represent a genuine [[natural language]].  It is observed that the syntax of the Enochian calls is almost identical with that of English.&lt;ref name="Laycock p43"&gt;Laycock, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, the very scant evidence of Enochian [[verb conjugation]] seems quite reminiscent of English, more so than with [[Semitic languages]] as Hebrew or Arabic, which Dee claimed were debased versions of the original Angelic language.&lt;ref name="Laycock p43" /&gt; There are only two known verbs with conjugations, one of which, "to be," is highly irregular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Egil Asprem|title="Enochian" language: A proof of the existence of angels?|url=http://skepsis.no/index.php?page=vis_nyhet&amp;NyhetID=84&amp;sok=1|publisher=Skepsis|date=Dec 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some phonetic features of Enochian show a connection to glossolalia, others show similarities to the English language. Both languages have soft and hard [[consonants]] such as ''c'' and ''g'', and combine ''s'' and ''h'' to make the ''sh'' sound.

As for the [[semantics]] of Enochian, additional similarities to English have been found. For example, ''luciftias'', a term meaning brightness, may very possibly have a connection to [[Lucifer]], whose name means "light bringer." ''Londoh'', a word meaning kingdom, may have come from Dee's admiration for [[Queen Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. These and other examples have led sceptics to believe that many of these terms are derived from notions that would have been contemporary in Dee's and Kelley's time.

The alphabet also shares many graphical similarities to a script- also attributed to the prophet Enoch- that appeared in the ''Voarchadumia Contra Alchimiam'' of [[Johannes Pantheus]], a copy of which Dee is known to have owned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Johannes Pantheus|title=''Voarchadumia Contra Alchimiam''|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/9925345/Voarchadumia-Contra-Alchimiam-Johannes-Pantheus|year=1550|page=15v-16r|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308052242/https://www.scribd.com/doc/9925345/Voarchadumia-Contra-Alchimiam-Johannes-Pantheus|archivedate=2016-03-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and Meaning==
The reason that mainly the southern Ghana-based [[Ga people]] use such elaborate coffins for their funerals is explained by their religious beliefs regarding the afterlife. They believe that death is not the end and that life continues in the next world in the same way it did on earth. Ancestors are also thought to be much more powerful than the living and able to influence their relatives who are still alive. This is why families do everything they can to ensure that a dead person is sympathetic towards them as early as possible. The social status of the deceased depends primarily on the importance, success and usage of an exclusive coffin during a burial.

Fantasy coffins are only seen on the day of the burial when they are buried with the deceased. They often symbolise the dead people’s professions. Certain shapes, such as a sword or stool coffin, represent regal or priestly insignia with a magical and religious function. Only people with the appropriate status are allowed to be buried in these types of coffins. Various animals, such as lions, cockerels and crabs can represent clan totems. Similarly, only the heads of the families concerned are permitted to be buried in coffins such as these. Many coffin shapes also evoke proverbs, which are interpreted in different ways by the Ga. That is why these coffins are also called proverbial coffins (''abebuu adekai'') or in the Ga language "okadi adekai".

==History==

[[Image:Drawing by Ataa Oko, 2009.jpg|right|thumb|[[Figurative Palanquin in Ghana|Figurative palanquin]]; drawing by [[Ataa Oko]] from Ghana]] 
Among the Christians the use of custom coffins is relatively new and began in the [[Greater Accra Region]] around 1950. These coffins were formerly used only by the Ga chiefs and priests, but since around 1960 figurative coffins have become an integral part of the local funeral culture.&lt;ref&gt;The buried treasures of the Ga. Coffin art in Ghana. Regula Tschumi. Bern:  Benteli 2008, p. 52-66.&lt;/ref&gt; The Christians had taken over the figurative coffins from the traditional Ga who were using figurative palanquins and coffins already since the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Regula Tschumi: The Figurative Palanquins of the Ga.

The invention of these figurative coffins is usually attributed to Seth Kane Kwei, though the anthropologist Roberta Bonetti&lt;ref&gt;Roberta Bonetti, ''Alternate Histories of the Abebuu Adeka''i, African Arts, autumn 2010, p. 14-33: Roberta Bonetti reached the same conclusion as [[Regula Tschumi]] considers the well-known stories about the origin of the figure-coffins to have been invented: „[...] We have seen how the same criteria of authenticity that were fundamental in documenting the uniqueness and truthfulness of ancient works have been adopted for recent coffins. The proof is provided by the presumed origin of the work, which has become even more precious and exceptional ever since the death of its „invented“ inventor, Kane Kwei“.&lt;/ref&gt; and especially [[Regula Tschumi]] question this myth. The idea of making and using custom coffins was inspired by the figurative palanquins in which the Ga chiefs were carried, and in which they were sometimes buried.&lt;ref&gt;The buried treasures of the Ga. Coffin art in Ghana. Regula Tschumi. Bern:  Benteli 2008, p. 57, 221-22.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ataa Oko]] (b.1919), of La, according to a few sources, could have started making custom coffins and figurative palanquins around 1945. Along with Kane Kwei from Teshie and Ataa Oko from La, other carpenters may have started this innovative art form the early 1950s.

== Making the coffins ==
Figurative coffins are produced only to order. Every master craftsman employs one or more apprentices, who carry out a large part of the work. This allows the artist to make several coffins simultaneously. The coffins are generally made from the wood of the local wawa tree. In the interests of durability, items produced for museums are constructed from mahogany or some other high-grade hardwood so as to guard against cracking and attacks by insects when transferred from one climate to another. 
A coffin will take two to six weeks to produce, depending on the complexity of the construction and the carpenters’ level of experience. In urgent cases several carpenters will work on a single item. All woodworking is done using the simplest tools, without the aid of electrical appliances. 
The painting of the figural coffins can take up to two days to finish.Some models are painted by the head of the workshop, others by local sign writers, some of them are even well known on the western art market for their hand-painted movie posters. Coffin-makers and sign-painters usually decide together which patterns and colours to use for a coffin.&lt;ref&gt;The buried treasures of the Ga. Coffin art in Ghana. Regula Tschumi.

===Ataa Oko===
[[Image:Ataa Oko, his third wife with a battleship coffin about 1960.jpg|thumb|[[Ataa Oko]] and his third wife with a battleship coffin, c.1960]]
[[Ataa Oko]] (1919-2012) was born in the coastal town of La, Ghana. From 1936 to 1939 he was trained as a carpenter in Accra. [[Ataa Oko]] was, until 2002, not in contact with foreigners, he only made coffins for Ghanaian customers and thus remained unknown in Western art circles.  In 2006, his work was for the first time exhibited at the art museum in [[Bern]].&lt;ref&gt;Six Feet Under, 2006. Art Museum Bern, and "Six Feet Under" 2007/2008 in the Deutsches Hygienemuseum, Dresden.&lt;/ref&gt;  Uninfluenced by Western customers, Ataa Oko had developed his own form of artistic language. His work is therefore different from those artists which come out of Kane Kwei's tradition. Therefore, it differs not only in terms of design, materials, but overall appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Ataa Oko, Ex. Cat., [[Collection de l'art brut]] (Hg), Infolio, 2010, p. 15-34.&lt;/ref&gt;  From 2005 to his death in 2012, he became a painter under the supervision of anthropologist [[Regula Tschumi]]. 2010/11 he had his first one-man show in a western Art museum, in the [[Collection de l'Art Brut]] in Lausanne.

'''Food swaps''' are events where members of a local community meet up to share homemade, homegrown, and foraged foods with each other. Apart from diversifying their [[larder]]s and redistributing surpluses and gluts, they provide opportunities for building stronger communities, and picking up tips. No money changes hands. Attendees bring items that they wish to swap and then bid for each other's produce, either verbally or on cards in the form of a [[silent auction]], until suitable swaps are negotiated. Often attendees bring extra items either as free samples or as contributions to a [[potluck]] lunch or tea, so that there is more time to get to know each other, exchange gossip and pass on tips.

==History==
Food has been swapped and traded since prehistoric times, from cacao beans to spices, fresh-killed meat to foraged berries.&lt;ref name="BBC-Winterman"&gt;{{cite news|last=Winterman|first=Denise|title=Food swapping: The movement taking off in the UK|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22539062|accessdate=21 November 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Food Swap Network started in Brooklyn, New York in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Food Swap Network Founders|url=http://www.foodswapnetwork.com/about-us/|publisher=Food Swap Network|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and 125 groups have been established across the US and Canada, as well as in Europe including the UK.&lt;ref name="BBC-Winterman"/&gt;  'Apples for Eggs' is a produce-sharing network set up in the UK in 2011.&lt;ref name="Telegraph-Hyslop"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hyslop|first=Leah|title=Word of mouth: Apples for Eggs, a food-swapping scheme|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/10383395/Word-of-mouth-Apples-for-Eggs-a-food-swapping-scheme.html|accessdate=21 November 2013|newspaper=Telegraph Magazine|date=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Apples for Eggs' has 159 registered swappers and organises events in York, Ormskirk, Henley, Stoke, and Brampton in Cumbria. There are similar events in Brazil, Denmark, France and the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Guardian-Sturgess"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sturgess|first=Emma|title=Food swapping: a fast way to free, homegrown food|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/oct/16/food-swapping-fast-free-homegrown|accessdate=21 November 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
There are several networks that organise food swaps, but anyone can create an event. The organisers provide premises, which may be a person's home, or a community building, publicise the event, and may also provide swapping cards or in some other way specify a procedure to be followed. The organisers may also provide tables and seating and may lay on teas and coffees for the attendees, or at least provide hot water and utensils for them to make their own.

Attendees may be advised to package their produce both for good looks and for transportability. While attendees kitchens are unlikely to be certified nut-free or have Food Standards Agency guarantees of cleanliness,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apples for Eggs|url=http://www.applesforeggs.com/|publisher=Apples for Eggs|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; swappers may be asked to specify ingredients, whether an item can be considered vegetarian or vegan, storage instructions, and a suggested use-by date, all based on trust and judgement.

Items may be grouped into swappable units, for example six cup-cakes may be equivalent to one loaf of bread, or three small fresh-caught fish. Swappers cruise the room, noting their interest by filling in bid cards at the different stands before the big exchange starts.&lt;ref name="Guardian-Sturgess"/&gt; Teas and coffees, or a potluck lunch provide an opportunity for people to get to know each other, and to swap recipes and tips. Attendees are usually asked to bring free samples of their wares, or some other items to share with others during the lunch or tea. Afterwards, bid cards are finalised, and finally, people actually swap their goods with others and clear up the room.&lt;ref name="Telegraph-Hyslop"/&gt;

If a food swap event last two hours, the timetable may be as follows: During the first 30 minutes people sign-in, set-up, and greetings go on. Swappers fill out name tags and swap sheets and set up their wares on the tables. The next 30 minutes to 1 hour are for everyone to walk around, examine, and sample items from other swappers, writing swap bids on other swappers' cards. Potluck tea or lunch may take place here too. The final 30 minutes are when all the swapping actually happens. Everyone goes back to their own bid cards, looks at the offers, finds interested offerers via their name tags, and swaps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a food swap?|url=http://www.foodswapnetwork.com/what-is-a-food-swap/|publisher=Food Swap Network|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Organisers of food swaps say the idea is part of a "new type of collectivism" including skills sharing and clothes swapping, and that it also feeds into current trends for thrift, recycling and making things yourself. The aims of food swapping are said to be to reduce waste, save people money, and bring communities together.&lt;ref name="BBC-Winterman"/&gt; Vicky Swift, who runs 'Apples for Eggs', told the BBC that the growing popularity of food swaps is about more than just food. "They are really social events and you get such a mix of people, from university students to pensioners. I think people like the sense of community that a food swap provides and you meet like-minded people with the same interests. People mingle, chat and swap expertise."&lt;ref name="BBC-Winterman"/&gt; She added to ''The Telegraph'', "There’s something very bonding about exchanging goods with someone you haven’t met before, and when you meet them again, you feel you’ve made a lasting connection. We really are seeing little communities blossom around these events."&lt;ref name="Telegraph-Hyslop"/&gt;

Martin Dolce, a UK food swapper, explained that when it's time to swap, you've got to move fast. "The first time I was forewarned that it would get a bit frantic. I thought: 'I'm a businessman, I can handle it.' I didn't know what was going on and I missed the choice stuff. Now I proactively go and grab something I like: you want that, I've got that, boom. The first five minutes are crucial."&lt;ref name="Guardian-Sturgess"/&gt;

''The Guardian'' warns that food swapping isn't for everyone. Nicki Jones, at a UK food swap said, "This would be my mother's worst nightmare. She couldn't bear the thought of having anyone else's things."&lt;ref name="Guardian-Sturgess"/&gt;

'''''Freedom Project''''' is a Japanese promotional project by [[Nissin Foods|Nissin]] [[Cup Noodles]] for their 35th anniversary in 2006. As part of the project, the 7-part [[Original video animation|OVA]] series, titled '''''Freedom''''',  was commissioned with and designed by [[Katsuhiro Otomo]] (of the anime film ''[[Steamboy]]'' and the manga ''[[Akira (manga)|Akira]]'' and its [[Akira (1988 film)|film adaptation]]) serving as the character and [[mecha]] designer. The series is directed by [[Shuhei Morita]], creator of the award-winning animation short ''[[Kakurenbo]]'', and is authored by celebrated writer [[Dai Sato]], Katsuhiko Chiba and Yuuichi Nomura. The series openly displays its sponsor's [[product placement]] in numerous scenes in which characters are shown consuming [[Nissin Cup Noodles]].

The OVA is animated and produced by [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]] and distributed by [[Bandai Visual]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hddvd.highdefdigest.com/383/freedomvol6.html|title=Freedom: 6|author=|date=|work=highdefdigest.com|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Freedom Committee" is the collective term used for the entire creative team behind ''Freedom'', which includes animators and production staff members who have previously worked on ''[[Steamboy]]''.

The theme song for the series, titled "[[This Is Love (Hikaru Utada song)|This is Love]]", is performed by popular [[Japanese pop]] singer [[Utada Hikaru]]. A second song, "[[Kiss &amp; Cry (song)|Kiss &amp; Cry]]", [[Utada Hikaru]]'s 19th Japanese single, was used for Nissin's fifth television commercial for Freedom, which began airing in Japan starting April 20, 2007.

==Plot==

''Freedom'' is about a child, Takeru, discovering a secret that could change the very society he depends upon.
Civilization on the Earth was destroyed by a permanent abnormal climate shift. Cities with millions of people had been built on the far side of the Moon and became the only place where humanity still survived. The remaining population declared the foundation of Republic Eden, then set forth expanding those lunar colonies that loved peace and freedom.

More than 160 years have passed since then. In Eden, children complete their compulsory education program when they are 15 years old. They are then integrated into the society as citizens. During their brief moratorium they are granted freedom. Like other boys, Takeru decides to take part in a race with his friends using machines particular to the moon, called “Vehicle”. But what distinguishes Takeru is that he has constructed his own vehicle. When his vehicle catches fire on a public road he is sentenced to 10 hours of "volunteer" work outside the dome, where he discovers the remains of a small crashed capsule bearing photographs and articles seemingly sent from Earth. Structures visible in the background identify the location they were taken as the Kennedy launch facility in Florida.

Infatuated with a young woman in the photograph, Takeru attempts to research conditions on Earth and finds that the library's information on the home planet is heavily censored. Furthermore, nobody is permitted to travel far enough from the dome over the lunar surface to get within visual range. He discovers a small enclave of people living in a facility outside of Eden's centralized control, and after befriending the enclave's leader is given access to a moon rover with sufficient range to get a view of Earth. He sees that the Earth is blue; it has recovered from the disaster that befell it and is now habitable again. The authorities of Eden pursue Takeru, attempting to suppress this discovery, but Takeru and his friend Bismarck manage to commandeer an old "escape" rocket and leave Eden to explore Earth first hand.

The escape rocket's capsule comes down slightly off course, landing in the ruins of Las Vegas, and Takeru and Bismarck use Takeru's vehicle to make the overland trek across the United States.

==Characters==
* '''Takeru''' — ''Age:'' 15 &amp;nbsp;''Height:'' 170&amp;nbsp;cm &amp;nbsp; A third-generation moon-dweller with a big appetite for Cup Noodles, Takeru has a warm and cheerful personality but is somewhat shy with girls. Takeru has a fascination for visiting the Earth. (Voiced by [[Daisuke Namikawa]] (Japanese) and [[Mike Sinterniklaas]] (English))
* '''Kazuma''' — ''Age:'' 15 &amp;nbsp;''Height:'' 175&amp;nbsp;cm &amp;nbsp; A close friend of Takeru, Kazuma is the quiet and cool type. He has a younger sister Chiyo. (Voiced by [[Morikubo Shotaro]] (Japanese) and [[Johnny Yong Bosch]] (English))
* '''Bismarck''' — ''Age:'' 15 &amp;nbsp;''Height:'' 160&amp;nbsp;cm &amp;nbsp; Close friends with Takeru and Kazuma, Bismarck has an introverted nature. He is called Biz by his friends.  Although not an accomplished rider, he is an ace with vehicle mechanics. (Voiced by [[Kappei Yamaguchi]] (Japanese) and [[Robby Sharpe]] (English))
* '''Taira''' — ''Age:'' 15 &amp;nbsp;''Height:'' 171&amp;nbsp;cm &amp;nbsp; A Tube Race rival that Takeru met and lost out to in ''Freedom 1''. Taira is an extremely accomplished rider and leader of the Tube Racers group called Moon Shine. (Voiced by [[Takuya Kirimoto]] (Japanese) and [[Greg Abbey]] (English))
* '''Junk''' — The owner of Moonraker, a garage found in Eden. This was where Takeru's vehicle was repaired and modified in preparation for the Tube Race in ''Freedom 1''.
* '''Alan''' — A senior member of Freedom living in the subterranean levels of Eden's domes. He  provides the high-powered engine for Takeru's damaged vehicle after his disastrous challenge with Taira. Alan also dons an Apollo jacket similar to the one worn by Takeru. His name is likely a reference to US Astronaut [[Alan Shepard]]. (Voiced by [[Seizō Katō]] (Japanese) and [[William Frederick Knight]] (English))
* '''Ao''' - The young Native American woman in the photo that Takeru is trying to find.  (Voiced by [[Sanae Kobayashi]] (Japanese) and [[Stephanie Sheh]] (English))
* '''Chiyo''' — Kazuma's younger sister.
* '''Gosshu''' — A member of Moon Shine.
* '''Naomi''' — A member of Moon Shine.

==Marketing==
As with most other major film and animation releases in Japan, a wide array of promotional merchandise was marketed before and during the OVA's release, including Nissin Cup Noodles with lead character Takeru printed on the lid, small desktop figurines, a 4 flavours Nissin Cup Noodles bundled Freedom DVD gift set, a limited Nissin Cup Noodle container and badges designed by video rental outlet [[Culture Convenience Club|Tsutaya]] that came free with the purchase of ''Freedom 1'', among tie-ins with other retailers. Although ''Freedom Project'' is a direct-to-video (DVD) animation, it stands apart from conventional OVA series first by the involvement of Otomo, and also from the collaboration with Nissin Cup Noodles resulting in extensive TV advertising scheduled to run through the duration of the series until its conclusion with ''Freedom 6''.

Publicity for the series began April 11, 2006, with large banners and posters featuring concept sketches of the lead characters Takeru, Kazuma and their vehicles lining Tokyo's busiest train stations, such as [[Shibuya Station|Shibuya]] and [[Shinjuku Station|Shinjuku]] — the latter being the busiest railway station in the world with 3 million transiting passengers every day. These initial pencil-work posters were later replaced by fully coloured, CG created versions with finished background art, giving the effect of a work-in-progress animation piece being completed.

At the same time, 30-second television spots were shown on TV — short trailers providing a glimpse of the story to unfold in ''Freedom 1''. The 5th advertising spot is currently being shown on Japanese television &lt;nowiki&gt;[April 20, 2007]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, and reveals major plot advances from ''Freedom 3''. Some of these spots were made available on the limited-edition ''Freedom Previsited'' DVD (see release notes below).

A special ''Freedom Project'' page, a collaboration between [[Yahoo! Japan]] and Nissin, will also stream every episode of the series one week before its DVD release date.

Print ads showcasing Katsuhiro Otomo's sketches for the OVA were also released in magazines nationwide. Shortly before the ''Freedom 1'' DVD release, many popular media, manga and animation magazines ran articles for the OVA, featuring mecha design descriptions and interviews with staff members.

The largely successful publicity campaign for ''Freedom Project'' was very well received by fans of Katsuhiro Otomo and animation fans in Japan, who saw him returning to his strengths of designing stylish mecha and memorable characters.

It seemed that Otomo was concerned with the production of this work overall and was the director at first, but was over for participation only for character and mechanic design after all.
According to the announcement of Nissin side, nonparticipation of Otomo is on schedule, Otomo confesses having resigned this work, or has refused the comment with some magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.narinari.com/Nd/2006116768.html|title=大友克洋が「FREEDOM PROJECT」を降板？　その噂の真相は。|author=|date=|work=narinari.com|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Genderqueer person.jpg|thumb|Genderqueer fashion style]]
'''Genderqueer fashion''' is [[fashion]] among [[genderqueer]] people that goes beyond common style conventions that usually associate certain colors and shapes with one of the two [[binary gender]]s. Genderqueer fashion aims to be perceived by consumers as a fashion style that focuses on experimenting garments based on people's different body shapes instead of following the restrictions given by gendered clothing categorization.

== Genderqueer style ==
Genderqueer style is characterized by the choice to not conform to gender norms assigned at birth. Its purpose is to redefine what is considered feminine and masculine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/24/queer-fashion-social-movement_n_7128374.html|title=Queer Fashion Is Not A Trend, 'It's A Social Movement'|first=Kira|last=Brekke|date=24 April 2015|publisher=|via=Huff Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This differentiation between gender norms through clothing became preponderant during the nineteenth century and it mainly involved different fabrics, trims and constructions for different genders.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Y, Kawamura, Fashion-ology: an introduction to fashion studies, Bloomsbury Academy, 2015, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; Those distinctions were meant to mirror gender roles in society as masculine clothing aimed to be practical while female fashion was perceived as purely aesthetic.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Therefore, there is a historical dimension to the association between fashion and gender identity. Nonetheless, gender expression today is recognized by the [[LGBT]] community as a very personal and subjective behaviour; genderqueer style is therefore intrinsically tied to identity, and as such, it includes a vast range of aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.advocate.com/commentary/2015/09/02/op-ed-how-queer-fashion-changing-world|title=Op-ed: How Queer Fashion Is Changing the World|date=2 September 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to contemporary criticism, gender becomes through fashion a form of body style which is a fundamental part of self-realisation and presentation&lt;ref&gt;J, Butler, Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory, Theatre Journal, Vol. 40, No. 4, 1988, pp. 519-531&lt;/ref&gt; as it creates a bridge between individual identity and society: the genderqueer fashion style tries to recode this relation, although encountering several restrictions in the mass production of commonly binary goods.&lt;ref&gt;B, Fine and E, Leopold, The World of Consumption, London: Routledge, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

These restrictions denote the political nature of genderqueer fashion. According to an article that featured the writer and activist [[Alok Vaid-Menon]],&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/125713-how-getting-dressed-as-a-non-binary-individual-is-a-political-act|title=Why My Outfit Choice Is Always Political|first=Meg|last=Zulch|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; fashion represents the inherent politics of each individual artist or human. For genderqueer people, as for [[transgender]] people, whose life and relationship with the body is hardly acknowledged by society, existence itself is political. [[File:Alok Vaid-Menon and Janani Balasubramanian, from the Duo Dark Matter.jpg|thumb|[[Alok Vaid-Menon]] and Janani Balasubramanian, from the Duo Dark Matter]]

Vaid-Menon points out that there is an additional layer of risk for humans assigned male at birth who want to present feminine by wearing dresses and makeup, since the act itself is likely to attract unwanted attention.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; In Vaid-Menon's words: "There's a material consequence to me presenting feminine, and there's not a material consequence to me presenting masculine, the minute I wear lipstick, or the minute I put on earrings, or the minute I'm wearing a skirt, my entire reality shifts".

In this regard, a 2017 study from Davidson Skylar showed that non-binary people who were assigned male at birth encounter more negative employment outcomes than non-binary people who were assigned female at birth.&lt;ref&gt;S, Davidson, Gender Inequality: Nonbinary Transgender People in the Workplace, University of Massachusetts Amherst, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon is considered an aspect of [[transmisogyny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.juliaserano.com/av/TransmisogynyPrimer-Serano.pdf|title=Trans-misogyny primer|last=Serano|first=Julia|date=|website=Julia Serano|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emerging designers ==
Most mainstream stores separate man and women clothing in different sections, making it difficult for genderqueer people to find clothes that fit. Genderqueer designers are trying to build a bridge between menswear and womenswear by meeting the clothing needs of all identities. For example, the clothing brand [[NO SESSO]] specializes in using different prints, fabric and reconstructed materials to dress various body types and gender identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2017/02/23/no-sesso-pierre-davis-gender-neutral-fashion|title=NO SESSO Is The Nonbinary Clothing Brand We're Stoked About|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sharpe Suiting]] is a fashion line that through a [[Kickstarter]] campaign was able to manufacture custom-constructed dresswear and a ready-to-wear line for a niche of masculine and androgynous people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/12/sharpe-suiting-fabrications_n_7046742.html|title=FABRICATIONS: Meet Queer Fashion Designer Leon Wu Of Sharpe Suiting|first=JamesMichael|last=Nichols|date=12 April 2015|publisher=|via=Huff Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its innovative feature consists in developing a system of measuring and tailoring techniques that minimize female curves of people who don't identify as women. This method is called [[andropometrics]] and is an androgynous alternative to the standard anthropometrics method used by most manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/17/sharpe-suiting-kickstarter_n_6171912.html|title=Sharpe Suiting To Design Clothing For Butch, Androgynous And Masculine-Of-Center Individuals|first=JamesMichael|last=Nichols|date=17 November 2014|publisher=|via=Huff Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maternity lines often include stereotypically feminine elements both in shapes and patterns, as motherhood and femininity are commonly considered to be matching. An alternative was offered by the [[startup company]] [[butchbaby &amp; co]], the first wear line for pregnant genderqueer individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thecut.com/2015/04/maternity-clothes-for-genderqueer-parents.html|title=Designing Maternity Clothes for Genderqueer Parents|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elle.com/fashion/shopping/a28252/butchbaby-and-co-interview-sketches.|title=What Do Genderqueer Maternity Clothes Look Like?|date=12 May 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global retail brands ==

Non-conforming fashion styles are gaining acceptance by a larger audience; for this reason, brands such as [[Zara (retailer)|Zara]] and [[H&amp;M]] are trying to offer unisex clothing lines to consumers by launching gender neutral collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vibe.com/2017/03/hm-unisex-denim-line|title=H&amp;M Is Defying Gender Norms With Their New Unisex Denim Line|date=10 March 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These collections are represented by female or male models only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/news/zara-gender-fluid-agender-unisex-fashion-transgender-ruby-rose-a6917496.html|title=Zara joins the gender fluid movement with new unisex range|date=7 March 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, these unisex products display an aesthetic typically considered masculine, both in shapes and colours (grey, beige and brown).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/20/fashion/in-fashion-gender-lines-are-blurring.html|title=In Fashion, Gender Lines Are Blurring|first=Ruth La|last=Ferla|date=19 August 2015|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== High fashion modeling ==

Genderqueer fashion is being increasingly recognized by high fashion designers who are now showcasing it on their runaways. For example, during [[Moschino]]'s Fall 2018 menswear and women's Pre-Fall show, [[Jeremy Scott]] presented a gender non-conforming look modelled by nonbinary model [[Oslo Grace]] and genderqueer [[drag queen]] [[Violet Chachki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/violet-chachki-moschino-runway-interview|title=Violet Chachki on Walking the Moschino Runway and the Importance of Queer Visibility|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Violet Chachki's words: "It's very important to have visual representation, to show that queers are important, queers are powerful, queers are beautiful, queers are valid, and you can't erase us".

Moreover, modeling agencies are starting to scout non-binary models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/non-binary-models-fashion-industry|title=The Fashion Industry Needs to Stop Ignoring Non-Binary Models|first=Sian|last=Ferguson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the case of [[My Friend Ned]]; a South African agency that officially divides its models in male, female and non-binary sections.

Overall, genderqueer representation in the high fashion world appears to be growing and to be increasingly acknowledged by the media. Famous examples of genderqueer/non-binary models are [[Casey Legler]], labelled as the world's first "female male model", [[Elliott Sailors]], [[Rain Dove]], [[Stas Fedyanin]] and [[Erika Linder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/fashion/models-crossing-gender-lines-fashion-industry-article-1.2485069|title=Models crossing gender lines in the fashion industry|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="50029">'''Global citizenship''' is the idea that all [[person|people]] have [[rights]] and [[civic duties|civic responsibilities]] that come with being a member of the [[world]], with whole-world philosophy and sensibilities, rather than as a citizen of a particular [[nation]] or place. The idea is that one’s identity transcends geography or political borders and that responsibilities or rights are derived from membership in a broader class: "humanity". This does not mean that such a person denounces or waives their nationality or other, more local identities, but such identities are given "second place" to their membership in a global community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kosmosjournal.org/articles/what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-global-citizen  Israel, Ronald C. (Spring|Summer 2012). "What Does it Mean to be a Global Citizen?" ''Kosmos.'']&lt;/ref&gt; Extended, the idea leads to questions about the state of global society in the age of [[globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Users/hafa3/global.htm | title=Global Society and International Relations: Sociological and Political Perspectives | publisher=Polity Press | author=Shaw, Martin | year=2000 | location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general usage, the term may have much the same meaning as "[[#World citizen|world citizen]]" or [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]], but it also has additional, specialized meanings in differing contexts. Various organizations, such as the [[World Service Authority]], have advocated global citizenship.

==Usage==

===Education===

In education, the term is most often used to describe a [[worldview]] or a set of [[values]] toward which education is oriented (see, for example, the priorities of the ''Global Education First Initiative'' led by the Secretary-General of the [[United Nations]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globaleducationfirst.org/220.htm "Priority #3: Foster Global Citizenship." ''Global Education First Initiative,'' Secretary-General of the United Nations.]&lt;/ref&gt; The term "global society" is sometimes used to indicate a [[global studies]] set of learning objectives for students to prepare them for global citizenship (see, for example, the Global Studies Center at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/global/node/483| title=Global Studies Center | publisher=University of Pittsburgh| accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the educational system, the concept of global citizenship education (GCED) is beginning to supersede or overarch movements such as [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] education, [[peace education]], [[human rights education]], [[Education for Sustainable Development]] and [[international education]].&lt;ref&gt;Australian Government (2008). ''Global Perspectives: A framework for global education in Australian schools''. Carlton South Victoria, Australia: Curriculum Corporation. {{ISBN|978 1 74200 075 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, GCED rapidly incorporates references to the aforementioned movements. The concept of global citizenship has been linked with awards offered for helping humanity.&lt;ref name="twsJun16gb"&gt;{{cite news

With GCED gaining attention, scholars are investigating the field and developing perspectives. The following are a few of the more common perspectives:
* ''Critical and transformative perspective''. Citizenship is defined by being a member with rights and responsibilities. Therefore, GCED must encourage active involvement. GCED can be taught from a [[Critical thinking|critical]] and [[Transformative learning|transformative]] perspective, whereby students are thinking, feeling, and doing. In this approach, GCED requires students to be politically critical and personally transformative. Teachers provide [[social issues]] in a neutral and grade-appropriate way for students to understand, grapple with, and do something about.&lt;ref&gt;O’Sullivan, M. (2008). "You can’t criticize what you don’t understand: Teachers as social change agents in neo liberal times."  Pp. 113-126 in O’Sullivan, Michael &amp; K. Pashby (eds.) ''Citizenship in the era of globalization: Canadian perspectives''. Rotterdam, The Netherlands: Sense Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Worldmindedness''. Graham Pike and David Selby view GCED as having two strands. Worldmindedness, the first strand, refers to understanding the world as one unified system and a responsibility to view the interests of individual nations with the overall needs of the planet in mind. The second strand, [[Student-centered learning|Child-centeredness]], is a pedagogical approach that encourages students to explore and discover on their own and addresses each learner as an individual with inimitable beliefs, experiences, and talents.&lt;ref&gt;Pike, G. &amp; D. Selby (2000). ''In the Global Classroom 2''. Toronto: Pippin.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Holistic Understanding''. The Holistic Understanding perspective was founded by Merry Merryfield, focusing on understanding the self in relation to a global community. This perspective follows a curriculum that attends to human values and beliefs, global systems, issues, history, [[cross-cultural]] understandings, and the development of [[Analysis|analytical]] and [[Evaluation|evaluative]] skills.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Philosophy===

Global citizenship, in some contexts, may refer to a brand of [[ethics]] or political philosophy in which it is proposed that the core [[social]], [[political]], [[economic]] and [[Natural environment|environmental]] realities of the world today should be addressed at all levels—by individuals, civil society organizations, communities and nation states—through a global lens.  It refers to a broad, culturally- and environmentally-inclusive worldview that accepts the fundamental interconnectedness of all things. Political, geographic borders become irrelevant and solutions to today's challenges are seen to be beyond the narrow vision of national interests. Proponents of this philosophy often point to [[Diogenes of Sinope]] (c. 412 B.C.) as an example, given his reported declaration that "I am a citizen of the world (κοσμοπολίτης, ''cosmopolites'')" in response to a question about his place of origin.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, "The Lives of Eminent Philosophers", Book VI, Chapter 2, line 63.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Sanskrit]] term, ''[[Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam]]'', has the meaning of "the world is one family".&lt;ref name="malhotra"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M7TlAgAAQBAJ | title=Indra's Net | publisher=Harper Collins, India. | author=Malhotra, Rajiv.| isbn=9789351362487 | date=2014-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest reference to this phrase is found in the Hitopadesha, a collection of parables. In the [[Mahopanishad]] VI.71-73, ślokas describe how one finds the Brahman (the one supreme, universal Spirit that is the origin and support of the phenomenal universe). The statement is not just about peace and harmony among the societies in the world, but also about a truth that somehow the whole world has to live together like a family.&lt;ref name="malhotra" /&gt;

===Psychological studies===
{{Missing|statistics reported by polls|date=October 2018}}
Global pollsters and psychologists have studied individual differences in the sense of global citizenship. Beginning in 2005, the [[World Values Survey]], administered across almost 100 countries, included the statement, “I see myself as a world citizen.”  For smaller studies, several multi-item scales have been developed, including Sam McFarland and colleagues’ Identification with All Humanity scale (e.g., “How much do you identify with (that is, feel a part of, feel love toward, have concern for) . . . all humans everywhere?”),&lt;ref name="McFarland, S. Webb 2012"/&gt; Anna Malsch and Alan Omoto’s Psychological Sense of Global Community (e.g., “I feel a sense of connection to people all over the world, even if I don’t know them personally”),&lt;ref&gt;Malsch, A. M., &amp; Omoto, A. M. (2007). Prosocial behavior beyond borders: Understanding a psychological sense of global community. Claremont, CA: Unpublished manuscript, Department of Psychology, Claremont Graduate University.&lt;/ref&gt; Gerhard Reese and colleagues’ Global Social Identity scale (e.g. “I feel strongly connected to the world community as a whole.”),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reese | first1 = G. | last2 = Proch | first2 = J. | last3 = Cohrs | first3 = J.C. | year = 2014 | title = Individual differences in responses to global inequality | doi = 10.1080/00224545.2014.992850 | journal = Analyses of Social issues and Public Policy | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 217–238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Stephen Reysen and Katzarska-Miller's global citizenship identification scale (e.g., “I strongly identify with global citizens.”).&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reysen | first1 = S. | last2 = Katzarska-Miller | first2 = I. | year = 2013 | title = A model of global citizenship: Antecedents and outcomes | doi = 10.1080/00207594.2012.701749 | journal = International Journal of Psychology | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 858–870 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These measures are strongly related to one another, but they are not fully identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McFarland | first1 = S. | last2 = Hornsby | first2 = W. | year = 2015 | title = An analysis of five measures of global human identification | doi = 10.1002/ejsp.2161 | journal = European Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 806–817 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of the psychological roots of global citizenship have found that persons high in global citizenship are also high on the personality traits of openness to experience and agreeableness from the [[Big Five personality traits]] and high in empathy and caring. Oppositely, the [[authoritarian personality]], the [[social dominance orientation]] and [[psychopathy]] are all associated with less global human identification. Some of these traits are influenced by heredity as well as by early experiences, which, in turn, likely influence individuals' receptiveness to global human identification.&lt;ref name="McFarland, S. Webb 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McFarland | first1 = S. Webb | last2 = Brown | first2 = D. | year = 2012 | title = All humanity is my ingroup: A measure and studies of Identification with All Humanity | doi = 10.1037/a0028724 | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 103 | issue = | pages = 830–853 | pmid=22708625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has found that those who are high in global human identification are less prejudiced toward many groups, care more about international human rights, worldwide inequality, global poverty and human suffering. They attend more actively to global concerns, value the lives of all human beings more equally, and give more in time and money to international humanitarian causes. They tend to be more politically liberal on both domestic and international issues.&lt;ref name="McFarland, S. Webb 2012"/&gt; They want their countries to do more to alleviate global suffering.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"/&gt;

Following a [[social identity approach]], Reysen and Katzarska-Miller tested a model showing the antecedents and outcomes of global citizenship identification (i.e., degree of psychological connection with global citizens).&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org" /&gt; Individuals’ normative environment (the cultural environment in which one is embedded contains people, artifacts, cultural patterns that promote viewing the self as a global citizen) and global awareness (perceiving oneself as aware, knowledgeable, and connected to others in the world) predict global citizenship identification. Global citizenship identification then predicts six broad categories of [[prosocial behavior]]s and values, including: intergroup [[empathy]], valuing diversity, [[social justice]], environmental [[sustainability]], intergroup [[Helping behavior|helping]], and a felt responsibility to act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Student Learning: Improving Practice |last=Reysen |first=Stephen |publisher=Nova |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-62618-938-6 |location=New York |pages=121–137 |last2=Katzarska-Miller |first2=Iva |editor-last=Boyle |editor-first=Christopher |chapter=Student pathways to global citizenship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects==

===Geography, sovereignty, and citizenship===

At the same time that [[globalization]] is reducing the importance of [[nation-states]],&lt;ref name="Scholte, 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scholte|first=Jan-Aart|title=Globalization: A Critical Introduction |chapter=Chapter 6: Globalization and Governance|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave}}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea of global citizenship may require a redefinition of ties between civic engagement and geography.  Face-to-face [[town hall meeting]]s seem increasingly supplanted by electronic "town halls" not limited by space and time.{{fact|date=October 2018}} [[Absentee ballot]]s opened the way for [[expatriate]]s to vote while living in another country; the Internet may carry this several steps further. Another interpretation given by several scholars of the changing configurations of citizenship due to globalization is the possibility that citizenship becomes a changed institution; even if situated within territorial boundaries that are national, if the meaning of the national itself has changed, then the meaning of being a citizen of that nation changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sassen|first=Saskia|title=Towards post-national and denationalized citizenship|year=2003|publisher=Sage|location=New York|pages=286|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~sjs2/PDFs/Towards_Post-National_and_Denationalized_Citizenship.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights===
The lack of a universally recognized world body can put the initiative upon global citizens themselves to create rights and obligations. Rights and obligations as they arose at the formation of nation-states (e.g. the right to vote and obligation to serve in time of war) are being expanded. Thus, new concepts that accord certain "human rights" which arose in the 20th century are increasingly being universalized across nations and governments. This is the result of many factors, including the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] by the United Nations in 1948, the aftermath of [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]] and growing sentiments towards legitimizing marginalized peoples (e.g., pre-industrialized peoples found in the jungles of Brazil and Borneo). Couple this with growing awareness of our impact on the environment, and there is the rising feeling that citizen rights may extend to include the right to dignity and [[self-determination]]. If national citizenship does not foster these new rights, then global citizenship may seem more accessible.

Global citizenship advocates may confer specific rights and obligations of human beings trapped in conflicts, those incarcerated as part of [[ethnic cleansing]], and pre-industrialized tribes newly discovered by scientists living in the depths of dense jungle

===World citizen===
{{original research|date=November 2017}}
[[File:World Citizen Flag.svg|thumb| World Citizen flag by Garry Davis]]
[[File:World citizen badge.svg|thumb|World Citizen badge]]
In general, a world citizen is a person who places global citizenship above any nationalistic or local identities and relationships. An early expression of this value is found in [[Diogenes of Sinope]] (c. 412 B.C.; mentioned above), the founding father of the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic movement]] in Ancient Greece.  Of Diogenes it is said: "Asked where he came from, he answered: 'I am a citizen of the world (kosmopolitês)'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laertius]], "The Lives of Eminent Philosophers", Chapter VI, line 63.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a ground-breaking concept because the broadest basis of social identity in Greece at that time was either the individual city-state or the Greeks (Hellenes) as a group. The [[Tamil people|Tamil]] poet Kaniyan Poongundran wrote in ''[[Purananuru]]'', "To us all towns are one, all men our kin." In later years, political philosopher [[Thomas Paine]] would declare, "my country is the world, and my religion is to do good."&lt;ref name="Paine1792"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Paine|title=The Rights of Man|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Rights_of_Man|accessdate=6 August 2015|date=1792}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, the increase in worldwide globalization has led to the formation of a "world citizen" [[social movement]] under a proposed [[world government]].&lt;ref name="worldservice"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worldservice.org/ | title=World Government of World Citizens | accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a non-political definition, it has been suggested that a world citizen may provide value to society by using knowledge acquired across cultural contexts.&lt;ref name="number"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2007| url = http://global-culture.org/blog/index.php/2007/03/22/the-utmost-global-citizen/  | title = the utmost global citizen| publisher = Global Culture}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people also consider themselves world citizens, as they feel at home wherever they may go.

[[Albert Einstein]] described himself as a world citizen and supported the idea throughout his life,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/world.php Einstein - World Citizen, Erasing National Boundaries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704235850/http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/world.php |date=4 July 2012 }}, [[American Museum of Natural History]]&lt;/ref&gt; famously saying "Nationalism is an infantile disease. It is the measles of mankind."&lt;ref&gt;Viereck, George Sylvester (26 October 1929), "What Life Means to Einstein: An Interview by George Sylvester Viereck", The Saturday Evening Post: 117, http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/satevepost/what_life_means_to_einstein.pdf retrieved on 7 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; World citizenship has been promoted by distinguished people including [[Garry Davis]], who lived for 60 years as a citizen of no nation, only the world.  Davis founded the [[World Service Authority]] in Washington, DC, which sells [[World Passport]]s, a [[Camouflage passport|fantasy passport]] to world citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.MyCountryIsTheWorld.net My Country Is the World] By Garry Davis&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 [[Hugh J. Schonfield]] founded the [[Commonwealth of World Citizens]], later known by its [[Esperanto]] name "Mondcivitana Respubliko", which also issued a world passport; it declined after the 1980s.

The [[Bahá'í faith]] promotes the concept through its founder's proclamation (in the late 19th century) that "The Earth is but one country, and mankind its citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Bahá'u'lláh |authorlink = Bahá'u'lláh |origyear = 1873-92 |year = 1994 |title = Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed After the Kitáb-i-Aqdas |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-87743-174-4 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/ | page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a term defined by the Bahá'í International Community in a concept paper shared at the 1st session of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development, New York, U.S.A. on 14–25 June 1993.&lt;ref name="bic"&gt;{{cite conference | title = World Citizenship: A Global Ethic for Sustainable Development | date = 1993-06-14 | location = New York, NY | author = Bahá'í International Community | booktitle =  1st session of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; "World citizenship begins with an acceptance of the oneness of the human family and the interconnectedness of the nations of 'the earth, our home.' While it encourages a sane and legitimate patriotism, it also insists upon a wider loyalty, a love of humanity as a whole. It does not, however, imply abandonment of legitimate loyalties, the suppression of cultural diversity, the abolition of national autonomy, nor the imposition of uniformity. Its hallmark is 'unity in diversity.' World citizenship encompasses the principles of social and economic justice, both within and between nations; non-adversarial decision making at all levels of society; equality of the sexes; racial, ethnic, national and religious harmony; and the willingness to sacrifice for the common good. Other facets of world citizenship—including the promotion of human honour and dignity, understanding, amity, co-operation, trustworthiness, compassion and the desire to serve—can be deduced from those already mentioned."&lt;ref name="bic"/&gt;

===Mundialization===
Philosophically, mundialization (French, ''mondialisation'') is seen as a response to globalization’s "dehumanisation through [despatialised] planetarisation" (Teilhard de Chardin quoted in Capdepuy 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://cybergeo.revues.org/24903 | title=Au prisme des mots | author=Capdepuy, Vincent | journal=Cybergeo: European Journal of Geography. | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early use of ''mondialisation'' was to refer to the act of a city or a local authority declaring itself a "world citizen" city, by voting a charter stating its awareness of global problems and its sense of shared responsibility. The concept was promoted by the self-declared World Citizen [[Garry Davis]] in 1949, as a logical extension of the idea of individuals declaring themselves world citizens, and promoted by Robert Sarrazac, a former leader of the [[French Resistance]] who created the Human Front of World Citizens in 1945.   The first city to be officially mundialised was the small French city of [[Cahors]] (only 20,000 in 2006), the capital city of the Département of [[Lot (department)|Lot]] in central [[France]], on 20 July 1949. Hundreds of cities mundialised themselves over a few years, most of them in France, and then it spread internationally, including to many German cities and to [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]]. In less than a year, 10 General Councils (the elected councils of the French "Départements"), and hundreds of cities in France covering 3.4 million inhabitants voted mundialisation charters. One of the goals was to elect one delegate per million inhabitants to a People's World Constitutional Convention given the already then historical failure of the [[United Nations]] in creating a global institution able to negotiate a final [[world peace]].  To date, more than 1000 cities and towns have declared themselves [[World cities]], including [[Beverly Hills]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Minneapolis]], [[St. Louis]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Toronto]], [[Hiroshima]], [[Tokyo]], [[Nivelles]], and [[Königswinter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldservice.org/mundcity.html|title=LIST OF MUNDIALIZED COMMUNITIES AND TOWNS|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a social movement, mundialization expresses the solidarity of populations of the globe and aims to establish institutions and [[supranational]] [[law]]s of a [[federation|federative]] structure common to them, while respecting the diversity of cultures and peoples. The movement advocates for a new political organization governing [[all humanity]], involving the transfer of certain parts of national [[sovereignty]] to a [[Federal World Authority]], [[Federal World Government]] and [[Federal World Court]]. Basing its authority on the will of the people, supporters hope it could develop new systems to draw on the highest and best wisdom of all humanity, and solve major planetary problems like [[hunger]], access to [[water]], [[war]], [[peace-keeping]], [[pollution]] and energy.  The mundialization movement includes the declaration of specified territory - a city, town, or state, for example - as world territory, with responsibilities and rights on a world scale. Currently the nation-state system and the United Nations offer no way for the people of the world to vote for world officials or participate in governing our world.  International [[treaties]] or agreements lack the [[force of law]]. Mundialization seeks to address this lack by presenting a way to build, one city at a time, such a system of true World Law based upon the sovereignty of the whole.

===Earth Anthem===
Author [[Shashi Tharoor]] feels that an [[Earth Anthem]] sung by people across the world can inspire [[planetary consciousness]] and global citizenship among people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newindianexpress.com/nation/Indian-diplomat-pens-anthem-for-earth/2013/06/05/article1620381.ece Indian diplomat pens anthem for earth] The New Indian Express 5 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Not all interpretations of global citizenship are positive. For example, [[Bhikhu Parekh|Parekh]] advocates what he calls globally oriented citizenship, and states, "If global citizenship means being a citizen of the world, it is neither practicable nor desirable."&lt;ref name="Parekh1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parekh | first1 = B | year = 2003 | title = Cosmopolitanism and Global Citizenship | url = | journal = Review of International Studies | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 3–17 | doi=10.1017/s0260210503000019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that global citizenship, defined as an actual membership of a type of worldwide government system, is impractical and dislocated from one's immediate community.&lt;ref name="Parekh1"/&gt; He also notes that such a world state would inevitably be "remote, bureaucratic, oppressive, and culturally bland."&lt;ref name=Parekh1/&gt; Parekh presents his alternative option with the statement: "Since the conditions of life of our fellow human beings in distant parts of the world should be a matter of deep moral and political concern to us, our citizenship has an inescapable global dimension, and we should aim to become what I might call a globally oriented citizen."&lt;ref name=Parekh1/&gt; Parekh's concept of globally oriented citizenship consists of identifying with and strengthening ties towards one's political regional community (whether in its current state or an improved, revised form), while recognizing and acting upon obligations towards others in the rest of the world.&lt;ref name=Parekh1/&gt;

Michael Byers, a professor in Political Science at the [[University of British Columbia]], questions the assumption that there is one definition of global citizenship, and unpacks aspects of potential definitions. In the introduction to his public lecture, the UBC Internalization website states, "'Global citizenship' remains undefined. What, if anything, does it really mean? Is global citizenship just the latest buzzword?"&lt;ref name="Byers1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Byers|first=Michael|title=The Meanings of Global Citizenship|year=2005|publisher=UBC Global Citizenship Speaker Series|url=http://www.internationalization.ubc.ca/gcss.htm#Meanings|accessdate=2009-10-28|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Neither criticism of global citizenship is anything new.  [[Gouverneur Morris]], a delegate to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)]], criticized "citizens of the world" while he was on the floor of the convention; August 9, 1787.  "As to those philosophical gentlemen, those Citizens of the World as they call themselves, He owned he did not wish to see any of them in our public Councils. He would not trust them. The men who can shake off their attachments to their own Country can never love any other. These attachments are the wholesome prejudices which uphold all Governments, Admit a Frenchman into your Senate, and he will study to increase the commerce of France: an Englishman, and he will feel an equal biass in favor of that of England."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_809.asp | title= Notes on the Debates in the Federal Convention | publisher=[[Yale University]] Avalon Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Changing the guards kremlin.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.4|Russian [[Kremlin Regiment|Kremlin Guards]] goose-stepping at [[military step|slow march]] near the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (Moscow)|Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]], [[Moscow]].]]
The '''goose step''' is a special [[military step|marching step]] performed on formal [[military parade]]s and other ceremonies. While marching in parade formation, troops swing their legs in unison off the ground while keeping each leg rigidly straight.

The step originated in [[Prussian Army|Prussian]] military drill in the mid-18th century and was called the '''Stechschritt''' (literally, "piercing step") or '''Stechmarsch'''. German military advisors spread the tradition to Russia in the 19th century, and the Soviets spread it around the world in the 20th. The goose step is now used by the militaries of over seventy countries, comprising three-fifths of the world's population.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The term "goose step" originally referred to a British military drill in which one leg at a time was swung back and forth without bending the knee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Goose-step | encyclopedia=The Encyclopædic Dictionary: A New, and Original Work of Reference to All the Words in the English Language with a Full Account of Their Origin, Meaning, Pronunciation, and Use | volume=4, Part 1 | quote=''Mil.:'' The act of a recruit in balancing himself on one foot while moving the other backwards and forwards without taking a step.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently, standing on only one leg reminded soldiers of how geese often stand. The term was later applied to the German ''stechschritt'' during [[World War I]] and is nowadays heavily associated with [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-goo3.htm|title=World Wide Words: Goose-step|website=World Wide Words}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=goose+step|title=goose step - Search Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the term has acquired a [[pejorative]] meaning in some English-speaking countries.

==Ceremonial usage==

The goose step is a difficult marching style that takes much practice and coordination. It is therefore reserved for ceremonial occasions.

Goose stepping is often seen in military parades. Because it is difficult to maintain for long periods of time, troops only begin to goose-step when they approach the reviewing stand and return to a normal march step once they have marched past. Large military parades require several days of practice to ensure that troops can perform the goose step without injuring themselves. Preparatory training includes having soldiers march in small groups, with arms linked to maintain balance.

[[File:RIAN archive 555827 Carrying the Olympic flag.jpg|thumb|right|Athletes goose-stepping with the Olympic flag at the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow.]]

[[Honour guard]]s also use the goose step during solemn ceremonies such as at war memorials or military cemeteries. The goose step has been featured in several [[Olympic opening ceremony|Olympic opening ceremonies]], as the host nation pays the same respect to the Olympic flag as to its own flag.

In the most rigorous form of the goose step, often found in [[guard mounting]] ceremonies, the pace is done at a [[military step|slow march]], and the leg is nearly horizontal, and sometimes well beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/16/trump-reckless-on-nato-says-defence-committee-chairman#img-1 |title=Trump 'reckless' on Nato, says defence committee chairman |newspaper=The Guardian |date= 16 January 2017 |author= Ewen MacAskill|accessdate= 16 January 2017}} Article has a photograph of soldiers goose-stepping with legs 45° above the horizontal.&lt;/ref&gt; In a standard goose step, found in large military parades, the pace is done at a [[military step|quick march]] and the leg is raised only to knee-height, or even to calf height. The lower goose step improves balance and unit cohesion at the tempo of a quick march. Flagbearers and honour guards will frequently march with a higher goose step than the mass of troops following.

==History==
===Origin===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-10887, Parade der Reichswehr.jpg|thumb|left||German soldiers of the [[Weimar Republic]]'s [[Reichswehr]] goosestepping in 1931.]] 

The "Stechschritt" originated in the 18th century, like other march steps, as a method of keeping troops lined up properly as they advanced towards enemy lines. It was introduced into German military tradition by [[Leopold I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau]], a [[Field Marshal]] whose close attention to training transformed the [[Prussia]]n infantry into one of the most formidable armed forces in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Navy and Army Illustrated|date=6 February 1904|volume=17|page=430|quote=The hero of the comedy is, it will be remembered, none other than Prince Leopold of Dessau, friend of Frederick the Great, hero of the Prussian Army, and inventor of the iron ramrod and of the "goose-step."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other armies adopted different march steps that served the same purpose; in the [[British Army]], soldiers were trained to swing their arms in a wide arc to allow officers to keep the advancing line in order. The [[Russian Empire]] adopted the goose step during the 1796&amp;ndash;1801 reign of [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haythornthwaite|first=Philip J.|title=The Russian Army of the Napoleonic Wars: Infantry, 1799-1814|year=1987|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-0850457377|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-19th century, the replacement of [[musket]]s with [[rifle]]s greatly increased the accuracy of defensive fire. It was too hazardous to march forward into battle in precise formation, and the practice became obsolete. However, armed forces continued to drill recruits in marching techniques that now focus on team building, military uniformity, and ceremonial functions. This was true in Prussia and the later [[German Empire]], where the goose step became emblematic of military discipline and efficiency.&lt;ref name="ruhl"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ruhl|first1=Arthur|title=Antwerp to Gallipoli: A Year of War on Many Fronts - and Behind Them|date=1916|publisher=Scribner|pages=115–116|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K6-fAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=goose%20step|quote=You have heard, let us say, of the German parade step, sometimes laughed at as the "goose step" in England and at home.

"Have you any idea of the moral effect of that step?

=== Adoption outside Europe ===

The goose step became widespread in militaries around the world in the 19th and 20th centuries. Military modernisation and political influence carried the practice to Asia, Africa, and Latin America from its origins in Prussia and Russia.

The first wave of adoption took place in the late 19th century, as the Prussian army became greatly admired for its decisive victory in the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. This led many countries to modernise their military forces along the Prussian model. The [[Chilean Army]] was the first non-European country to adopt the goose step, importing many Prussian military traditions after the [[War of the Pacific]]. The practice of goose stepping then spread widely throughout Latin America thanks to Chilean and Prussian influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sater|first1=William F.|last2=Herwig|first2=Holger H.|title=The Grand Illusion: The Prussianization of the Chilean Army|date=1999|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln, Nebraska|isbn=9780803223936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goose stepping continued to gain ground even after Germany's defeat in World War I, as many nations still looked to the German model for military organisation and training. Notably, the army of [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Nationalist China]] was trained by German advisors in the 1920s, accounting for the largest single goose-stepping military today.

=== Cold War ===

During the [[Cold War]], the Soviet Union trained the military forces of many of its [[client state]]s with Soviet military drill and ceremonial practices. This led to the second great wave of adoption, as the goose step was introduced into many Third World countries in Asia and Africa. Meanwhile, the United States, France and the United Kingdom were, through efforts in their client republics and allies, preventing the use of the goose step in their armed services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Hixson|editor-first1=Walter L.|title=The American experience in World War II|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415940368|page=64|quote=After referring to earlier Russian and German military missions in China, Wedemeyer announced that now the Chinese would "unlearn to goosestep."}}&lt;/ref&gt; A divided Germany was also divided in the goose step. The East German [[National People's Army|Nationale Volksarmee]] kept the goose step, while the West German [[Bundeswehr]] adopted a Western-style march step but with hands swinging. The centuries-long German practice of goose-stepping finally ended in 1990, when the East German army also ended the practice altogether.&lt;ref name="fulbrook2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fulbrook|first1=Mary|title=A History of Germany 1918-2014: The Divided Nation|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9781118776131|page=213|edition=4|year=2014|quote=Curiously, the East German Army retained the old Prussian military goose step until December 1989.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countries that use the goose step==

[[File:Santiago de Cuba - Garde au Mausolée José Marti.JPG|thumb|Cuban Honor Guards goose-stepping at the Mausoleum of [[José Martí]], [[Santiago de Cuba]]]]

The goose step is a feature of military ceremonies in dozens of countries, to varying extents. Some countries use the goose step as a general parade step performed by all troops, while others reserve it for honour guards and ceremonial units.

===Americas===

The goose step is very popular in Latin America, where it has been adopted by most Spanish-speaking countries. It is not found in countries where Dutch, English, or Portuguese is the official language.

* [[Armed Forces of the Argentine Republic|Argentina]]: The Infantry Company of the [[Colegio Militar de la Nación]] uses the goose step as their parade step.

* [[Military of Haiti|Haiti]]: The Haitian military was dissolved in 1996. However, demobilized soldiers have formed militias that continue to drill with the goose step.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | title=Les Militaires continuent de s'entraîner | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eZfpkDBcbg | publisher=Le Nouvelliste Haiti | date=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government began reforming its armed forces in 2016, sending them to be trained by Latin American countries that use the goose step like Ecuador.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | title=Fuerzas Armadas de Ecuador capacitará a 40 aspirantes a soldados de Haití | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RRgnC4AWGE | publisher=Defense Ecuador | date=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;Thus, the new Haiti Defence Force marches in like manner as in many South and Central American armed services which use the practice.

==High-stepping as an alternative==

[[File:Military Parade Belgrade 2014 - Serbian Soldiers with Russian Knights - The Swifts (16021305159).jpg|thumb|Example of high-stepping in a military parade, Belgrade]]

Many militaries choose to use a high step in which the legs are lifted high off the ground, but the knee is bent at the top of the arc. The high step is commonly found in countries that abandoned the goose step, were under German military influence, or border countries that use the goose step.

Countries that abandoned the goose step:

* Argentina: The Infantry Company of the [[Colegio Militar de la Nacion]] still uses the goose step as a parade step. However, several units of the [[Argentine Army]] and the [[Argentine Naval Prefecture]] that used to goose-step have switched to the high step, which is also in standard use in the [[Argentine Navy]] and the [[Argentine Air Force]].
* [[Timor Leste Defence Force|East Timor]] adopted the high step after obtaining its independence from Indonesia, which uses the goose step.
* [[Syrian Armed Forces|Syrian government forces]] continue to goose-step, but Kurdish forces have switched to the high step.
* [[Yugoslav People's Army|Yugoslavia]] adopted the goose step shortly after World War II, as its army was modernized along Soviet lines. Goose-stepping can be seen in the 1950 military parade in the capital [[Belgrade]]. However, it had been replaced by high-stepping by the 1975 parade, as [[Josip Broz Tito|Marshal Tito]] asserted his [[Non-Aligned Movement|independence]] from Soviet influence. High-stepping is still used in [[Serbian Armed Forces|Serbia]], [[Army of the Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], and [[Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

Countries that were under German military influence:

* During the Meiji era, the Japanese military was modernized along the German model, but the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] chose to adopt the high step instead of the goose step.&lt;ref name="walcott"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | title=Military Parade In Tokyo (1930-1939) | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGqUTEE3BAE | publisher=British Pathé}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese military dropped the high step after its defeat in World War II.
* [[Portuguese Armed Forces|Portugal]] adopted the high step in the 1910s, when it [[First Portuguese Republic|became a republic]].
* Turkey's use of the high step dates back to the late Ottoman Empire, when the [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman military]] was modernized under German influence. Like Japan, it chose to adopt a bent-leg high step instead of the German goose step. Turkey continues to use the high step today.

Countries that border goose-stepping countries:

* [[Brazilian Armed Forces|Brazil]] uses the high step as its general parade step. Brazil borders several Spanish-speaking countries that use the goose step.
* Somalia shares a border with Djibouti and sea borders with Yemen. The [[Somali Armed Forces]] and the [[Somaliland Armed Forces]] both perform the high step.
* [[Armed Forces of Uruguay|Uruguay]] is one of the few Spanish-speaking countries that does not use the goose step. Instead, it uses the high step as its general parade step in all ceremonies.
* [[Lebanon]] shares borders with Syria to the north. The [[Lebanese Armed Forces]] today perform the high step in parades held on major national holidays.

==Abandonment==

The goose-step is a ceremonial march that requires substantial training. It is often abandoned in times of war, as more pressing needs occupy the available training time. Opinion on the goose-step was divided even in the German ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;"Doom Of 'Goose-Step' Sought By Nazi Military Officials", The Baltimore Sun, June 6, 1937. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; In the later part of World War II, the goose step nearly disappeared because of manpower shortages, accelerated courses in basic training, and a paucity of appropriate occasions.

After the Second World War, [[West Germany]] abandoned the goose step in favor of a hybrid Western march step, while keeping the hand swings to the chest. [[East Germany]] preserved the goose step and renamed it the "drilling step" (''exerzierschritt'') to avoid references to old Prussian and Wehrmacht military traditions. The 200-year German tradition of goose stepping finally ended with [[German reunification]] in 1990, as [[National People's Army|East German forces]] were absorbed into the [[Bundeswehr]] and conformed to West German military customs. Although goose-stepping has no official sanction, the practice is not illegal in Germany. Some civilian marching bands and riflemen's associations continue to goose-step while others dropped it altogether.

After the fall of the Soviet Union, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Georgia abandoned the Russian-style goose step (by 2015, Estonia revived the practice but only color guards do so on parades and Latvia retained the goose step for ceremonial purposes). The other 11 former Soviet Republics have kept the goose step (only Moldova's military honor guard unit retains the practice).

Ethiopia adopted the goose step during the [[Derg]] military junta, which espoused socialist ideals and sought Soviet military aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | title=Cuban president Fidel Castro and Ethiopian leader Mariam watch military parade | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihrYxYK2rvo | publisher=AP Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was dropped after the Derg were overthrown.

Hungary used the high step during the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|regency of Miklós Horthy]], and switched to the goose step early in the Cold War. Neither march step was retained after the end of the Cold War, as the parade of 1961 formally ended its use in favor of the normal quick march. (It was only retained as a slow march for the entrance of historical colors.)

Italy introduced the goose step in 1938 under [[Benito Mussolini]] as the ''Passo Romano'' ("Roman Step"). The custom was never popular in Italy's armed forces except amongst the [[Blackshirts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,789426,00.html|title=Foreign News: Roman Step|date=7 February 1938|publisher=|via=www.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goose step was dropped after World War II.

Romania used the goose step until from the 1910s up to 1967, when the [[Romanian Armed Forces]] ended using it for formal parades. It was briefly revived in the 1990s, and today only a single historical unit performs it while wearing First World War uniforms.

Switzerland is a majority German-speaking country that absorbed many German military traditions alongside those of France and Italy. The [[Swiss Armed Forces]] abandoned the goose step in 1946, after the German defeat in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;"Swiss Army Drops Goosestep," Associated Press, February 28, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Republic of China Armed Forces|Republic of China (Taiwan) Armed Forces]] continued to use the goose step after the end of the [[Chinese Civil War]]. The 80-year tradition of goose-stepping was finally ended in 2003, during an independence-minded [[Democratic Progressive Party]] administration. In 2016, veterans organizations criticized the sloppy marching of military cadets and began holding their own goose-stepping parades, reviewed by [[Kuomintang]] politicians in two occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Huang|first1=Sunrise|last2=Liu|first2=Claudia|last3=Su|first3=Justin|last4=Hsu|first4=Elizabeth|title=Veterans reintroduce goose step in Taipei parade|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201606120005.aspx|work=Focus Taiwan|date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zimbabwean guerillas used the goose step during the [[Rhodesian Bush War]] of the 1970s. [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army|ZIPRA]] was trained and supplied by the [[Warsaw Pact]], adopting East German uniforms and the goose step.&lt;ref&gt;Petter-Bowyer, Peter J.H. ''Winds of destruction: the autobiography of a Rhodesian combat pilot''. Johannesburg: 30° South Publishers, 2005. p.382.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siff, Peter. ''Cry Zimbabwe: Independence -- Twenty Years on''. Galago, 2000.  p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army|ZANLA]] was supplied and trained by China in [[On Guerrilla Warfare|Maoist guerilla tactics]]. However, Zimbabwe ultimately attained black majority rule thanks to [[Lancaster House Agreement|British influence]]. As a result, the unified [[Zimbabwe National Army|Zimbabwean Army]] maintained a British march step.

==Association with dictatorship==

The goose step was ridiculed by Allied [[propaganda]] in the World Wars as a symbol of blind obedience and senseless attachment to military form. Prior to U.S. entry into World War I, American military observers had remarked favorably on the goose step as a means of building unit cohesion.&lt;ref name="ruhl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="walcott"/&gt; However, its association with Nazi Germany in World War II proved fatal to the goose step's reputation in English-speaking countries. It was condemned in [[George Orwell|George Orwell's]] essay ''[[The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism and the English Genius|The Lion and the Unicorn]]'', and proved an easy target for parody in many editorial cartoons and [[Hollywood]] films.

Orwell commented in "[[England Your England]]" (1941) that the goose step was used only in countries where the population was too scared to laugh at their military.

===Cultural references===
&lt;!--Do not add more examples, unless they are very significant culturally or historically. Otherwise, this section will grow too large, as thousands of World War II movies show the goose step. For example, George Orwell did a great deal to associate the goose step with totalitarianism, so he gets a mention. --&gt;

* In the episode of the British sitcom ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'' called ''[[The Germans]]'', the main character Basil Fawlty infamously imitates the goose step in front of some German guests. 
* In a 1999 television adaptation of Orwell's ''[[Animal Farm (1999 film)|Animal Farm]]'', the goose step is appropriately performed by a flock of geese, singing the praises of their porcine leader Napoleon in a propaganda film.

In colloquial English, the phrase ''goose-stepping'' has connotations of blind obedience and submission. The term does not carry this negative connotation in countries that actually use the goose step. This can result in mistaken interpretations due to [[cultural bias]]:

* In ''[[Spartacus (ballet)|Spartacus]]'', a ballet by [[Aram Khachaturian]], the Roman soldiers goose-step in most of their scenes. English-speaking reviewers sometimes conclude erroneously that the [[choreography]] must be intending to link the Roman Empire with the tyranny of Nazi Germany. However, goose-stepping in Russia carries no such connotation, and reflects only military discipline. Goose-stepping can be found in a number of Russian ballets in which it is not associated with the villains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bolshoi in DC -- Nutcracker |url=http://ballettalk.invisionzone.com/index.php?/topic/8417-bolshoi-in-dc-nutcracker/ |publisher=Ballet Alert! |accessdate=June 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HumanTraces.jpg|thumb|right|First edition (publ. [[Hutchinson (publisher)|Hutchinson]])]]
'''''Human Traces''''' is a 2005 [[novel]] by [[Sebastian Faulks]], best known as the British author of ''[[Birdsong (novel)|Birdsong]]'' and ''[[Charlotte Gray (novel)|Charlotte Gray]]''. The novel took Faulks five years to write. It tells of two friends who set up a pioneering asylum in 19th-century Austria, in tandem with the evolution of psychiatry and the start of the [[First World War]].

==Plot overview==
Tracing the intertwined lives of Doctors Thomas Midwinter, who is English, and Jacques Rebière, from [[Brittany]], France, ''Human Traces'' explores the development of [[psychiatry]] and [[psychoanalysis]] in the late 19th century, by way of excursions into first [[psychiatry|alienism]] then [[metaphysics]], [[human evolution]] and [[neuroscience]], before the search for what it means to be human takes us into a brief foray into the [[First World War]]. Central to the plot is the theory of [[Bicameralism (psychology)|bicameralism]].

Whilst some have criticised ''Human Traces'' as excessively [[expository]], detailed and [[didactic]], it has also been considered wide-ranging, ambitious and well written. It has enjoyed commercial success, having been a bestseller in the United Kingdom.

Faulks himself says of his novel:

'Human Traces was a [[Sisyphus|Sisyphean task]]. After spending five years in libraries reading up on madness, psychiatry and psychoanalysis (my office had charts and timelines and things plastered all over the walls), the act of finishing it felt like a bereavement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21613136-5001986,00.html ''The Australian'', Books, 28 April 2007 'Parting with the art of war]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6279">'''Huon of Bordeaux''' is the title character of a 13th-century French epic poem with [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] elements.

== ''Huon of Bordeaux'' ==
Huon is a knight who, after unwittingly killing [[Charlot]], the son of Emperor [[Charlemagne]], is given a reprieve from death on condition that he fulfill a number of seemingly impossible tasks: he must travel to the court of the [[Emir]] of [[Babylon (Egypt)|Babylon]] and return with a handful of the Emir's hair and teeth, slay the Emir's mightiest knight, and three times kiss the Emir's daughter, Esclarmonde. All these Huon eventually achieves with the assistance of the fairy king [[Oberon]].

== Editions and continuations ==
The ''[[chanson de geste]]'' that survives (in three more or less complete manuscripts and two short fragments) comprises 10,553 [[decasyllable]] verses grouped in 91 [[assonance]]d  [[laisse]]s.  Presumed dates for its composition vary, but 1216 and 1268 are generally given as ''[[terminus post quem]]'' and ''[[terminus ante quem]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Raby, ix-xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''chanson'''s success gave rise to six continuations and one prologue which triple its length:
*''Roman d'Aubéron'' – the [[Turin]] manuscript of the romance (the only manuscript to contain all of the continuations) contains the only version of this 14th-century prologue in the shape of a separate romance of Auberon.  No prose version exists.&lt;ref&gt;Raby, xviii.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Huon Roi de Féérie''
*''Chanson d'Esclarmonde''
*''Chanson de Clarisse et Florent''
*''[[Chanson d'Yde et d'Olive]]''
*''Chanson de Godin'' – the [[Turin]] manuscript of the romance contains the only version of this 13th–14th century continuation. No prose version exists.&lt;ref&gt;Raby, xx-xxi.&lt;/ref&gt; The Turin manuscript also contains the romance of ''Les Lorrains'', a summary in seventeen lines of another version of the story, according to which Huon's exile is due to his having slain a count in the emperor's palace.
*''Roman de Croissant''

The poem and most of its continuations were converted to a [[rhyme]]d version in [[French alexandrine|alexandrine]]s in 1454 (only one manuscript exists).&lt;ref&gt;Raby, xxi-xxii.&lt;/ref&gt; While no manuscript exists from the 15th century prose version, this version served as the base text for 16th century printed editions (eleven exist), the earliest extant being the edition printed by Michel le Noir in 1513.&lt;ref&gt;Raby, xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;  The work was reprinted ten times in the 17th century, eight times in the 18th and four times in the 19th (notably in a beautifully printed and illustrated adaptation in modern French by [[Gaston Paris]] in 1898).

The romance came into vogue in England through the translation (c. 1540) of [[John Bourchier, 2nd Baron Berners|John Bourchier, Lord Berners]], as ''Huon of Burdeuxe'',&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; through which Shakespeare heard of the French epic.  In [[Philip Henslowe]]'s diary there is a note of a performance of a play, ''Hewen of Burdocize'', on December 28, 1593. The tale was dramatized and produced in Paris by the Confrérie de la Passion in 1557. 

The tale also serves as the basis for [[Christoph Martin Wieland]]'s epic poem ''[[Oberon]]'' of 1780, where Huon becomes the lover of the Sultan's daughter Rezia/Amanda. [[Andre Norton]] retold the tale in quasi-modern English prose as ''Huon of the Horn'', published by [[Harcourt, Brace &amp; Company]] in 1951, which is considered her first fantasy novel.

== Historical sources ==
The Charlot of the story has been identified by [[Auguste Longnon]] (''Romania'' vol. viii) with [[Charles the Child]], one of the sons of [[Charles the Bald]] and [[Ermentrude]], who died in 866 in consequence of wounds inflicted by a certain Aubouin in precisely similar circumstances to those related in the romance. The godfather of Huon may safely be identified with [[Seguin II of Gascony|Seguin]], who was count of Bordeaux under [[Louis the Pious]] in 839, and died fighting against the [[Vikings]] six years later. Huon himself is probably based on [[Hunald I]], duke of [[Aquitaine]] in the 8th century, who was defeated by Charlemagne's father.&lt;ref&gt;Julien Bellarbre, [http://journals.openedition.org/ifha/8049 "La « nation » aquitaine dans l’historiographie monastique du sud de la Loire (VIII&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;–XII&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècles)"], ''Revue de l'IFHA'', '''6''' (2014), retrieved 21 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s influence and reception''' varied widely and may be roughly divided into various chronological periods. Reactions were anything but uniform, and proponents of various ideologies attempted to appropriate his work quite early.

Kierkegaard's reputation as a philosopher was first established in his native [[Denmark]] with his work ''[[Either/Or]]''.&lt;ref name=Garff&gt;Garff, Joakim. ''Søren Kierkegaard: A Biography''. Trans. Bruce H. Kirmmse. Princeton, 2005, 0-691-09165-X&lt;/ref&gt; Henriette Wulff, in a letter to [[Hans Christian Andersen]], wrote, "''Recently a book was published here with the title ''Either/Or''! It is supposed to be quite strange, the first part full of Don Juanism, skepticism, et cetera, and the second part toned down and conciliating, ending with a sermon that is said to be quite excellent. The whole book attracted much attention. It has not yet been discussed publicly by anyone, but it surely will be. It is actually supposed to be by a Kierkegaard who has adopted a pseudonym....''"&lt;ref name=Garff /&gt;

Kierkegaard's fame in Denmark increased with each publication of his philosophical works, including ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'' and ''[[Philosophical Fragments]]'', and culminating in his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], the ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments]]''. However, Kierkegaard's attack upon [[Christendom]], represented by the [[Danish National Church]] near the end of his life, did not endear him to many in the clergy and theological circles. After his death, his original manuscripts were bequeathed by his one-time fiancée, [[Regine Olsen]] for posterity. She later donated most of his writings to the [[Danish Royal Library]] where they continue to be stored.

Kierkegaard's thought gained a wider audience with the translation of his works into [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], and [[English language|English]].

Many [[20th-century philosophy|20th-century philosophers]], both theistic and atheistic, drew concepts from Kierkegaard, including the notions of angst, despair, and the importance of the individual. His fame as a philosopher grew tremendously in the 1930s, in large part because the ascendant [[existentialist]] movement pointed to him as a precursor, although later writers celebrated him as a highly significant and influential thinker in his own right.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weston|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Kierkegaard was raised as a [[Lutheran]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hampson|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was commemorated as a teacher in the [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|Calendar of Saints]] of the [[Lutheran Church]] on 11 November and in the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church)|Calendar of Saints]] of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] with a [[feast day]] on 8 September.

Philosophers and theologians influenced by Kierkegaard include [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]], [[Karl Barth]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Niels Bohr]], [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]], [[Emil Brunner]], [[Martin Buber]], [[Rudolf Bultmann]], [[Albert Camus]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]], [[Karl Jaspers]], [[Gabriel Marcel]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], [[Franz Rosenzweig]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Joseph Soloveitchik]], [[Paul Tillich]], [[Malcolm Muggeridge]], [[Thomas Merton]], [[Miguel de Unamuno]].&lt;ref name="Archive.org"&gt;Unamuno refers to Kierkegaard in his book ''The Tragic Sense of Life'', Part IV, [https://archive.org/stream/thetragicsenseof00unamuoft#page/106/mode/1up "In The Depths of the Abyss"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Feyerabend]]'s [[epistemological anarchism]] in the philosophy of science was inspired by Kierkegaard's idea of subjectivity as truth. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] was immensely influenced and humbled by Kierkegaard,&lt;ref name="Creegan"&gt;{{harvnb|Creegan|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that "Kierkegaard is far too deep for me, anyhow. He bewilders me without working the good effects which he would in deeper souls".&lt;ref name="Creegan" /&gt; [[Karl Popper]] referred to Kierkegaard as "the great reformer of Christian ethics, who exposed the official Christian morality of his day as anti-Christian and anti-humanitarian hypocrisy".&lt;ref name="Popper 2002"&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kierkegaard and psychology==
Kierkegaard had a profound influence on [[psychology]]. He is widely regarded as the founder of [[Christian psychology]] and of [[existential psychology]] and [[existential therapy|therapy]].&lt;ref name="Ostenfeld"&gt;{{harvnb|Ostenfeld|McKinnon|1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Existentialist (often called "humanistic") psychologists and therapists include [[Ludwig Binswanger]], [[Viktor Frankl]], [[Erich Fromm]], [[Carl Rogers]], and [[Rollo May]]. May based his ''The Meaning of Anxiety'' on Kierkegaard's ''The Concept of Anxiety''. Kierkegaard's [[sociology|sociological]] work ''Two Ages: The Age of Revolution and the Present Age'' critiques [[modernity]].&lt;ref name="LitRev"&gt;{{harvnb|Kierkegaard|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernest Becker]] based his 1974 [[Pulitzer Prize]] book, ''[[The Denial of Death]]'', on the writings of Kierkegaard, [[Freud]] and [[Otto Rank]]. Kierkegaard is also seen as an important precursor of [[postmodern]]ism.&lt;ref name="Postmod"&gt;{{harvnb|Matustik|Westphal|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kierkegaard and literature==
Kierkegaard influenced [[19th century in literature|19th-century literature]] writers as well as [[20th century in literature|20th-century literature]]. [[August Strindberg]] (1843-1912) found inspiration in Kierkegaard and the famous Norwegian dramatist and poet [[Henrik Ibsen]] (1828-1906) clearly seems to have been inspired by the Dane in famous works such as ''Brand''. The other great Norwegian national writer and poet [[Bjornstjerne Bjornson]] (1832-1910) was also deeply inspired by Kierkegaard.&lt;ref&gt;See ''In God's Way'', by Bjornson [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/37726/37726-h/37726-h.htm ''In God's Way''.] Bjornson names one of his characters Soren Pedersen. Kierkegaard's father's name was Michael Pedersen Kierkegaard.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally the celebrated Norwegian artist [[Edvard Munch]] (1863-1944) closely studied key concepts such as anxiety, and this influence is notable in some of his iconic paintings such as The Scream.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lVCJtJDKOjAC&amp;pg=PR12&amp;lpg=PR12&amp;dq=Jorge+Luis+Borges+kierkegaard&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=72574Q0nC6&amp;sig=4CEwkWb1B9db8qdaP7GjPrUUKAI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QOy-VPjPGoaaNtX5gaAC&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Jorge%20Luis%20Borges%20kierkegaard&amp;f=false ''Kierkegaard's Influence on Literature, Criticism and Art: The Germanophone World'' Feb 28, 2013, by Jon Stewart p. xii]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other figures deeply influenced by his work include [[W. H. Auden]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Don DeLillo]], [[Hermann Hesse]], [[Franz Kafka]],&lt;ref name="Kafka"&gt;{{harvnb|McGee|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]], [[Flannery O'Connor]], [[Walker Percy]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[J.D. Salinger]] and [[John Updike]].&lt;ref name="Updike"&gt;{{harvnb|Updike|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard's work ''The Diary of a Seducer'' has been re-published several times, including Princeton University Press' translation with John Updike's foreword and [[Penguin Books]]' series ''[[Penguin Great Loves|Great Loves]]''.

Kierkegaard's present stature in the English-speaking world owes much to the exegetical writings and improved Kierkegaard translations by the American theologian Walter Lowrie, the [[University of Minnesota]] philosopher David F. Swenson, and the Danish translators [[Howard V. and Edna H. Hong Kierkegaard Library|Howard and Edna Hong]]. [[Anthony Rudd]]'s book ''Kierkegaard and the Limits of the Ethical'' and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]]'s discussion of Kierkegaard in ''[[After Virtue]]'' and ''[[A Short History of Ethics]]'' did much to facilitate Kierkegaard's legacy in ethical thought in [[analytic philosophy]].

Kierkegaard's influence on [[continental philosophy]] increased dramatically after the First and Second World Wars, especially among the German existenz thinkers and French existentialists. [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Emmanuel Levinas]], and [[Karl Barth]] all owe a heavy debt to Kierkegaard. [[Paul Ricoeur]] and [[Judith Butler]] wrote monographs drawing new attention to Kierkegaard's work, and a 1964 [[UNESCO]] colloquium on Kierkegaard in [[Paris]] ranks as one of the most important events for a generation's reception of Kierkegaard, which included a keynote speaker, Sartre who gave his lecture ''The Singular Universal'', which solidified Kierkegaard's influence over existentialism.&lt;ref&gt;Matuštík, M. (1995), ''Kierkegaard in Post/Modernity'', Indiana University Press, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In America, interest in Kierkegaard was revived from the 1980s onwards, particularly by the American philosopher and curator of the Kierkegaard Library at [[St. Olaf College]] Gordon Marino, who has devoted several books and essays to Kierkegaard. In Kierkegaard's native Denmark, the Danish people hosted his 200th anniversary of Kierkegaard's birth in [[Copenhagen]] in May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sk2013.ku.dk/english/ Kierkegaard in 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130131000532/http://sk2013.ku.dk/english/ |date=2013-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kierkegaard has also influenced members of the [[analytical philosophy]] tradition, most notably [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], who considered Kierkegaard to be "the most profound thinker of the [nineteenth] century. Kierkegaard was a saint."&lt;ref&gt;[http://sammelpunkt.philo.at:8080/521/1/13-2-97.TXT Notes on Wittgenstein's Reading of Kierkegaard by Jens Glebe-Moeller.]&lt;/ref&gt; To some degree, Kierkegaard can be seen as one of the few philosophers to whom the simple analytic/continental divide does not fully apply.

Kierkegaard predicted his posthumous fame, and foresaw that his work would become the subject of intense study and research. In his journals, he wrote:
{{Quote|"What the age needs is not a genius—it has had geniuses enough, but a martyr, who in order to teach men to obey would himself be obedient unto death. What the age needs is awakening. And therefore someday, not only my writings but my whole life, all the intriguing mystery of the machine will be studied and studied. I never forget how God helps me and it is therefore my last wish that everything may be to his honour."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dru|1938|p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== International reception ==
{{expand section|date=December 2015}}

=== In France ===
Kierkegaard was first mentioned in a French publication in 1856 in ''{{Lang|fr|[[Revue des deux mondes]]}}'' ({{Lang-en|Review of the Two Worlds}}) in an article detailing the state of Danish politics and culture which described his influence on the Danish church as having "bewildered many minds and troubled many weak or fearful consciences". The article also detailed the controversy around his funeral.&lt;ref name="KIR-france"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stewart|first1=Jon|editor1-last=Stewart|editor1-first=Jon|title=Kierkegaard's International Reception I: Northern and Western Europe|date=2007|publisher=Ashgate|location=Aldershot|isbn=9780754664963|pages=421–474|chapter=France: Kierkegaard as a Forerunner of Existentialism and Poststructuralism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first translation of Kierkegaard into French was published in 1886 by Johannes Gøtzsche, with a preface by the theologian Hans-Peter Kofoed-Hansen. The work translated was ''[[Two Minor Ethical-Religious Essays]]'' ({{lang-fr|En quoi l'homme de génie diffère-t-il de l'apôtre? Traité éthique-religieux}}).&lt;ref name="KIR-france" /&gt;

Subsequent translations of Kierkegaard into French include those produced by [[Paul Petit (writer)|Paul Petit]], who produced a French translation of the ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'' in 1941, as well as a translation of the ''Philosophical Fragments'', published posthumously in 1947.&lt;ref name="KIR-france" /&gt;

=== In Germany ===
The earliest mentions of Kierkegaard's work in German publications were written by [[Andreas Frederik Beck]], himself Danish and one of the attendees at Kierkegaard's oral dissertation defence. There was an anonymous German review of ''Philosophical Fragments'' published in 1845 which subsequent scholarship believes was written by Beck. Kierkegaard responded to Beck's criticisms in a footnote published in the followup to the ''Fragments'', the ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript''. Another early mention of Kierkegaard in German is from [[Johann Georg Theodor Grässe]], who included Kierkegaard briefly in an 1848 review of European literature.&lt;ref name="KIR-germany"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Schulz|first1=Heiko|editor1-last=Stewart|editor1-first=Jon|title=Kierkegaard's International Reception I: Northern and Western Europe|date=2007|publisher=Ashgate|location=Aldershot|isbn=9780754664963|pages=307–419|chapter=Germany and Austria: A Modest Head Start}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1856, the Bavarian-born conservative politician and historian [[Joseph Edmund Jörg]] wrote an article discussing religious movements and events in Scandinavian history. The Catholic Jörg praised Kierkegaard's relentless attack on the Danish Lutheran Church, but suggests that Kierkegaard should perhaps have seen Catholicism as a final step in his religious development.&lt;ref name="KIR-germany" /&gt;

Early translations of Kierkegaard into German were restricted to his post-1850 material (''The Moment'', the attack on the Lutheran Church) and appeared in the 1860s. The Tübingen-trained pastor, [[Albert Bärthold]], studied Kierkegaard under [[Johann Tobias Beck]] and published translations of a number of Kierkegaard's works.&lt;ref name="KIR-germany" /&gt;

The most significant translation work was conducted by [[Christoph Schrempf]], another student of J.T. Beck. Schrempf's first translations appeared in 1890 and by 1922, he had completed translations of the entire set of Kierkegaard's published writings. His translations have been criticised repeatedly as unreliable: Heiko Schulz referred to them as "repeatedly revised, highly idiosyncratic, and at times breathtakingly free renditions of the Kierkegaardian texts". Schrempf also spread a view of Kierkegaard significantly out-of-step from the mainstream, interpreting Kierekgaard's "subjectivity as truth" as a justification for his own religious disbelief.&lt;ref name="KIR-germany" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3419">'''Hamdir''', '''Sörli''' and '''Erp''' (Old Norse: ''Erpr'') were three brothers in [[Norse mythology]], who have a historic basis in the history of the [[Goths]]. 

==Legend==
According to the [[Edda]] and the ''[[Völsunga saga]]'', Hamdir and Sörli were the sons of [[Gjuki]]'s daughter [[Gudrun]] and King '''Jonakr'''. Erp was the son of Jonakr from an earlier marriage. [[Svanhild]], the daughter of [[Sigurd]] and [[Gudrun]], was also raised by Jonakr. 

King Jörmunrek ([[Ermanaric]]) proposed to Svanhild through his son Randver, but the treacherous Bicke said that Randver tried to win Svanhild's love. Consequently, Jörmunrek sentenced Randver to death by hanging and had Svanhild trampled to death by horses. Gudrun then agitated her sons Hamdir and Sörli to avenge their half-sister. When Sörli and Hamdir met Erp en route, they did not understand his riddles and, thinking him arrogant, killed him.

During the night, they arrived and they cut off Jörmunrek's hands and feet. This made Jörmunrek wake up and he cried for his [[housecarl]]s. Hamdir said that if Erp had been alive he would have cut off the head. The housecarls could not kill the two brothers with sharp weapons, but an old one-eyed man ([[Odin]]) advised them to kill them with stones.

This is why scaldic poetry used the "sorrow of Jonakr's sons" as a [[kenning]] for stones.

In  ''[[Ynglingatal]]'' (9th century), [[Þjóðólfr of Hvinir]] mentions their death in a comparison with the death of the Swedish king [[Anund]]:

|
|}

==Sources and historic basis==
The legend of Jörmunrek appears in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' as ''[[Hamðismál]]'' and ''[[Guðrúnarhvöt]]''. It also appears in [[Bragi Boddason]]'s ''[[Ragnarsdrápa]]'', in the ''[[Völsunga saga]]'' and in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''. [[Jordanes]] wrote in 551 that the Gothic king [[Ermanaric]] was upset with the attack of a subordinate king and had his wife Sunilda (i.e. Svanhild) torn to pieces by horses, and as revenge Ermanaric was pierced with spears by her brothers '''Ammius''' (Hamdir) and  '''Sarus''' (Sörli) and died from the wounds. The ''[[Annals of Quedlinburg]]'' (end of the 10th century) relates that the brothers '''Hemidus''' (Hamdir), '''Serila''' (Sörli) and '''Adaccar''' (Erp/[[Odoacer]]) had cut off the hands of Ermanarik.

==In popular culture==
The legend forms the background behind [[Poul Anderson]]'s short story "[[The Sorrow of Odin the Goth]]."

A '''keepsake box''' or '''[[memory box]]''', typically made from wood, is used for storing mementos of a special time, event or person. They are often created or purchased to mark life's major events like a [[christen]]ing, [[wedding]], [[birthday]], or First Holy Communion. They may also be given for sad occasions of bereavement, such as the [[stillbirth]] of a child, when a keepsake/memory box helps with the grieving process. This sort of a keepsake box may be personalised with a person's name, design or picture.

In September 2011 the [[BBC]] highlighted a modern example of a particularly intricate memory box, in the form of a Pantheon Theatre, containing over 10,000 pieces of [[marquetry]], taking 18 months to create.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MMxFCmjD3Y Memory Box Model Theatre], BBC East Midlands News (YouTube clip).

'''''Life After Billy''''' is a non-fiction book written by [[Brian Vallée]] published in 1993. ''Life After Billy'' is a sequel to Vallée's acclaimed book [[Life with Billy (book)|''Life With Billy'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thewesternstar.com/Opinion/Columnists/2009-10-17/article-1483208/Married-to-a-monster%3A-Life-with-Billy-and-the-story-of-Jane-Hurshman/1 |title=Married to a monster: 'Life with Billy' and the story of Jane Hurshman |last1=Squires |first1=Darrell |date= October 17, 2009 |website= The Western Star |access-date= March 11, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Life After Billy'' focuses on the long term impacts of domestic violence and life after leaving an abusive partner.  The book continues to follow the experiences of [[Jane Hurshman]] who Vallée wrote about in ''Life With Billy''

==Synopsis==
''Life After Billy'' picks up where the [[Life with Billy (book)|''Life With Billy'']] book by Vallée concluded.  This book continues to focus on domestic violence through the lens of [[Jane Hurshman]]'s experience with abuse. In 1982 Hurshamn shot and killed her husband Billy Stafford.  Jane was found not guilty of murder and was sentences for manslaughter.  Her case set precedents in Canada for cases involving [[battered women]] syndrome.  ''Life After Billy'' focuses on Hurshman's experience following the non-guilty verdict and her work as a fighter against domestic abuse.  Hurshman committed suicide in 1992, ten years after Stafford's death.  Vallée addresses her death through ''Life After Billy'' and uses it as a focal point for discussing the long term impacts of abusive relationships.

[[File:Black Badna-Bodna BD.jpg|thumb|A black spouted '''bôdnā''' made in Bangladesh]]
A '''lota''' or '''bodna''' ({{lang-bn|{{Nastaliq|বদনা}}}}, {{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|لوٹا}}}}, {{lang-hi|लोटा}}) is a small (usually spherical) water vessel of brass, copper or plastic used in parts of [[South Asia]] for personal hygiene and, among [[Muslim]]s, for ''[[wudu]]''.&lt;ref name="Definition of Lota"&gt;{{cite web | title = Definition of Lota | publisher = Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary | url = http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/lota | accessdate = 2007-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==
{{See also|Kindi (vessel)}}
Early examples of ''lota'' and ''kindi'' first appear in chalcolithic period cultures of South Asia, notably in [[Daimabad#Phase_I:_Savalda_culture|Savalda Culture]] and two well-preserved examples from [[Daimabad#Phase_V:_Jorwe_culture|Jorwe culture]] pottery dating back to 2nd millennium BC.&lt;ref name=singh&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Upinder|title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&amp;pg=PA229&amp;lpg=PA229&amp;dq=Daimabad&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xccy3QeRgD&amp;sig=4VrbXMwjPNBDci-067WIOhMHNyc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=IFp-TJbqC4-2vQP5ib2EDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Daimabad&amp;f=false|year=2008|publisher=[[Pearson Education]]|location=[[Delhi]]|isbn=978-81-317-1120-0|pages=229–233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="asi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asi.nic.in/asi_exca_imp_maharashtra.asp|title=Excavations - Important - Maharashtra|publisher=[[Archaeological Survey of India]]|accessdate=1 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011165314/http://asi.nic.in/asi_exca_imp_maharashtra.asp|archive-date=11 October 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design example==

American designers [[Charles and Ray Eames]] in their ''[[The India Report]]'' expressed a great admiration for the lota, saying about its [[design]], "Of all the objects we have seen and admired during our visit to India, the Lota, that simple vessel of everyday use, stands out as perhaps the greatest, the most beautiful."&lt;ref name="An Eames Primer"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Demetrios  | first = Eames   | title = An Eames Primer  | publisher = Universe Publishing  | date = 9 February 2002  | url = http://www.well.com/conf/inkwell.vue/topics/147/Eames-Demetrios-An-Eames-Primer-page01.html#post13  | accessdate = 2007-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The India Report"&gt;{{cite web  | title = Eames' India Report  | publisher = National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad, India  | url = http://www.nid.edu/aboutus_eamesreport.htm  | accessdate = 2007-03-22  | deadurl = yes  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070309151633/http://www.nid.edu/aboutus_eamesreport.htm  | archivedate = 9 March 2007  | df = dmy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100409093444/http://observatory.designobserver.com/entry.html?entry=12692 "Charles &amp; Ray Eames India Report, April 1958"], Design Observer&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yoga and religious uses==
The lota is also used in [[religious]] activities such as the [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]] in [[Hinduism]]. When used for Hindu worship, it is often decorated with [[sindoor]] and/or [[turmeric]] powder. For Muslims when praying they have to be clean hence they perform wudu (ablutions), a further requirement is to clean themself with water after going to the toilet so the Lota is used by Muslims for personal hygiene, after going to the toilet, so that they can pray afterwards.

==Related concepts==
In some parts of Pakistan and India, the use of the phrase "bependi ka lota" (a "lota without a base") is colloquially used to refer to a person who may switch their loyalties. This comes from the observation that a spherical lota without a base tends to roll over in unpredictable directions when kept on uneven ground. The [[neologism]] "[[wikt:lotacracy|lotacracy]]" was coined in Pakistan to describe [[politician]]s who would switch [[political party|parties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Humayun|last= Gauhar|title= Blasphemy…or a convenience?|url= http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentID=2011012492056|work= [[Saudi Gazette]]|publisher= Okaz Organization for Press and Publication|date= 24 January 2011|accessdate= 24 January 2011|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120330191038/http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentID=2011012492056|archivedate= 30 March 2012|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleansing==
In [[Islam]], the [[wudu]] and [[ghusl]] [[ritual purification]] require water, for which a lota is commonly used.

In the [[Indian subcontinent]], the lota is employed to cleanse oneself.&lt;ref name="Donald Albrecht"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TDxDM2gSSFcC&amp;q=lota+indian+american&amp;dq=lota+indian+american&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UwdlTtGgNsrYgAf7_dSsCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBA|author=Donald Albrecht|title =The Work of Charles and Ray Eames: a Legacy of Invention|publisher = [[Harry N. Abrams]]|quote=India and Pakistan have a water culture, so that it is preferable to use a lota to cleanse with after using the washroom.|year=2009|accessdate = 5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In parts of [[Bangladesh]] the term ''bôdnā'' ({{lang-bn|বদনা}}) describes spouted (teapot-like) vessels while ''lotā'' is used for bath mugs (the vessels used for puja are called ''ghôt'' or ''ghôti''). People of the [[desi]] diaspora may use [[watering can]]s, empty bottles or cups for this purpose. Muslims often refer to the cleansing process as [[istinja]].  It is specially use for [[wudu]], [[bathing|bath]], vessel and [[anal cleansing]].

This 'bodna' is used by Hindus and called Gangasagar. It is often used for serving water/ sharbat to people in a party or Barat or langar.

The '''[[Mount Crosby, Queensland|Mount Crosby]] Pumping Station''' is located on the [[Brisbane River]] in the [[City of Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], Australia. It is located on both sides of the river at [[Mount Crosby, Queensland|Mount Crosby]] on the east bank and at [[Chuwar, Queensland|Chuwar]] on the west bank. The facility supplies water to [[Brisbane]] and nearby cities and towns within the [[SEQ Water Grid]]. It is listed on the [[Brisbane Heritage Register]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite BrisbaneHR|1084|Mt Crosby Pumping Station|27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Brisbane's water supply during the convict era came from a reservoir in present-day Tank Street in the [[Brisbane central business district]]. There was no pipe network; the water was delivered by water carts to households who stored their water in barrels. The water was described as having "a [[Pea soup|pea-soup]] colour and consistency" which required the householders to add wood ashes or alum to their water barrels to [[precipitate]] the yellow sediments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = History of Moreton Bay Convict Settlement and Penal Colony|url = http://www.brisbanehistory.com/convict_era.html|website = www.brisbanehistory.com|accessdate = 13 September 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924083028/http://www.brisbanehistory.com/convict_era.html|archive-date = 24 September 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On establishment of the [[Brisbane Municipal Council]] in 1859, one of their first tasks was to plan a better water supply for the growing town.&lt;ref name=cm&gt;{{Citation | author1=Melton, Charles | title=Brisbane's water supply : the Queen Street fire of 1864 | publication-date=1 January 1935 | publisher=Royal Historical Society of Queensland | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/37779460 | accessdate=13 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mount Crosby pumping station was originally steam-powered. Coal was transported via a [[tramway (industrial)|tramway]] to fire the boilers to create the steam that drove the pumping engines; the tramway was originally created for construction purposes.&lt;ref name="qpmc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://queenslandplaces.com.au/node/606 |title=Mount Crosby |work=Queensland Places |publisher=Centre for the Government of Queensland, University of Queensland |accessdate=21 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008235409/http://queenslandplaces.com.au/node/606 |archive-date=8 October 2012 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The facility originally pumped untreated water from the north or eastern bank of the River. To cater for increased demand the Westbank Water Treatment Plant was built in 1986.&lt;ref name="mcwtpt" /&gt;

During [[January 2013 Eastern Australia floods]], both treatment plants were unable to process Brisbane River water because it was too muddy and filled with silt.&lt;ref name="ewfn"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/enough-water-for-now--if-were-careful-20130130-2djol.html|title=Enough water for now - if we're careful|author=Tony Moore|first=|date=30 January 2013|work=Brisbane Times|accessdate=21 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130131034817/https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/enough-water-for-now--if-were-careful-20130130-2djol.htmlhttps://web.archive.org/web/20130131034817/https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/enough-water-for-now--if-were-careful-20130130-2djol.html|archive-date=31 January 2013|dead-url=yes|publisher=Fairfax Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
There is a single lane bridge over the [[Mount Crosby Weir]] enabling easy access between the two sites; it is also a public road.

==Operation==
Most of the water treated is sourced from [[Lake Wivenhoe]] and Lockyer Creek via the [[Brisbane River]], though some is also from [[Lake Manchester, Queensland|Lake Manchester]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsroom.brisbane.qld.gov.au/home/news_detail.asp?ID=320 Lake Manchester joins SEQ drought fight] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090608201340/http://newsroom.brisbane.qld.gov.au/home/news_detail.asp?ID=320 |date=8 June 2009 }}. Brisbane City Council.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two intakes pipes, one on each bank.&lt;ref name="mcwtpt"/&gt; The pipes are protected by a {{convert|25|mm}} mesh screen which stops material such as leaves and sticks from entering the plant. The water from the Pumping Station is supplied to the Eastbank Water Treatment Plant. An additional smaller pumping station sits on the west bank to supply the Westbank Water Treatment Plant. Treated water from both Water Treatment Plants is pumped to two {{convert|90|Ml}} reservoirs at Cameron's Hill.&lt;ref name="mcwtpt"/&gt;

Westbank Water Treatment Plant is able to generate {{convert|250|Ml}} of drinking water each day.&lt;ref name="mcwtpt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seqwater.com.au/public/virtual-tours/pdf/MtCrosby_Water_Treatment_Plant_Script_Sheet.pdf |title=Mount Crosby Water Treatment Plant Tour |publisher=Seqwater |accessdate=21 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411154130/http://www.seqwater.com.au/public/virtual-tours/pdf/MtCrosby_Water_Treatment_Plant_Script_Sheet.pdf |archive-date=11 April 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During periods of high demand the amount can be increased four-fold to {{convert|1,000|Ml}}. The process takes about 24 hours to convert.

Eastbank Water Treatment Plant is able to generate {{convert|850|Ml}} of drinking water each day.

[[Image:ancientlibraryalex.jpg|thumb|right| The Ancient Library of Alexandria.]]
The '''Musaeum''' or '''Mouseion at Alexandria''' ({{lang-grc|Μουσεῖον τῆς Ἀλεξανδρείας}}), which included the famous [[Library of Alexandria]],&lt;ref&gt;The relation of the institutions is still a matter of debate. The ''Musaeum'' is discussed by P.M. Fraser, ''Ptolemaic Alexandria'' (1972: vol. I:213-19 etc), and Mostafa el-Addabi, ''The Life and Fate of the Ancient Library of Alexandria'' (Paris 1990:84-90).&lt;/ref&gt; was an institution founded by [[Ptolemy I Soter]] or, perhaps more likely, by his son [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]]. This original ''Musaeum'' ("Institution of the Muses") was the home of music or poetry, a philosophical school and library such as [[Plato]]'s [[Academy]], also a storehouse of  texts. It did not have a collection of works of art, rather it was an institution that brought together some of the best scholars of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic world]], analogous to a modern [[university]]. This original ''Musaeum'' was the source for the modern usage of the word ''[[museum#Etymology|museum]]''.

==History==
The Musaeum was an institution founded, according to [[Johannes Tzetzes]], by [[Ptolemy I Soter]] (c. 367 BC – c. 283 BC) or, perhaps more likely, by [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] (309–246 BC)&lt;ref&gt;There is no ancient source for the founding either of the Library or the Musaeum, [[Roger S. Bagnall]] notes, in "Alexandria: Library of Dreams", ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' '''146'''.4 (December 2002:348-362) p. 348. We rely instead on the self-confident but unreliable Byzantine scholar [[Johannes Tzetzes]]' remarks in an introduction to Aristotle.&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Alexandria]]. The ''Mouseion'' remained supported by the patronage of the royal family of the [[Ptolemies]]. Such a Greek ''Mouseion'' was the home of music or poetry, a philosophical school and library such as [[Plato]]'s [[Academy]], also a storehouse of  texts.&lt;ref&gt;Entry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2368883 Μουσείον] at [[Liddell &amp; Scott]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mouseion'', connoting an assemblage gathered together under the protection of the [[Muses]], was the title given to a collection of stories about the esteemed writers of the past assembled by [[Alcidamas]], an Athenian [[sophist]] of the fourth century BC.

Though the ''Musaeum'' at Alexandria did not have a collection of sculpture and painting presented as works of art,&lt;ref&gt;The Ptolemaic dynasty displayed these in their palace nearby.&lt;/ref&gt; as was assembled by the Ptolemies' rival [[Attalid dynasty|Attalus]] at the [[Library of Pergamum]], it did have a room devoted to the study of [[anatomy]] and an installation for astronomical observations. Rather than simply a [[museum]] in the sense that has developed since the Renaissance, it was an institution that brought together some of the best scholars of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic world]], as [[Germain Bazin]] compared it, "analogous to the modern [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] or to the [[Collège de France]] in Paris."&lt;ref&gt;Bazin, ''The Museum Age'' 1967:16.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 21st century, the nearest equivalent is a [[university]].

More than 1,000 scholars lived in the Mouseion at a given time. Staff members and scholars were salaried by the Mouseion and paid no taxes. They also received free meals, free room and board, and free servants. The Mouseion was administered by a priest appointed by the Pharaoh.&lt;ref name="DW"/&gt;

The Mouseion's scholars conducted scientific research, published, lectured, and collected as much literature as possible from the known world. In addition to Greek works, foreign texts were translated from Assyrian, Persian, Jewish, Indian languages, and other sources.&lt;ref name="DW"/&gt; The edited versions of the Greek [[literary canon]] that we know today, from [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]] forward, exist in editions that were collated and corrected by the scholars assembled in the Musaeum at Alexandria.

==Appearance==
The Greek geographer [[Strabo]] described the Musaeum and Library as richly decorated edifices in a campus of buildings and gardens.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Mouseion is also part of the palaces, possessing a ''peripatos''&lt;ref&gt;An open loggia for walking and talking.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''exedra''&lt;ref&gt;The curved seat of an ''exedra'' is more accommodating to a group conversation than a bench in a straight line.&lt;/ref&gt; and large ''oikos'', in which the common table&lt;ref&gt;''Oikos'' signifies "household" in the broadest sense; an English analogy might be a university "commons".&lt;/ref&gt; of the ''philologoi'', men who are members of the ''Mouseion'', is located. This ''synodos'' has property in common and a priest in charge of the ''Mouseion'', formerly appointed by the kings, but now by Caesar."  --Strabo &lt;ref&gt;Strabo, ''Geography'' 17.1.8, noted by Bagnall 2002:57 note 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Mouseion featured a roofed walkway, an arcade of seats, and a communal dining room where scholars routinely ate and shared ideas.  The building was filled with private study rooms, residential quarters, lecture halls, and theaters.&lt;ref name="DW"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailywriting.net/Mouseion.htm|title=Mouseion|website=www.dailywriting.net|access-date=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
{{See also|Serapeum of Alexandria}}
The classic period of the Musaeum did not survive the purge and expulsion of most of the intellectuals attached to it in 145 BC, when [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] resigned his position; at any rate, the sources that best describe the Musaeum and library, [[Johannes Tzetzes]] and others, all Byzantine and late, do not mention any further directors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Heller-Roazen]], "Tradition's Destruction: On the Library of Alexandria" ''October'', '''100''', Obsolescence (Spring 2002:133-1530 esp. p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; The Musaeum continued as an institution in the Roman period when [[Strabo]] gave his description of it, and according to [[Suetonius]],&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Claudius'', 42&lt;/ref&gt; the emperor [[Claudius]] added an additional building.&lt;ref name="watts147"&gt;Edward Jay Watts, (2008), ''City and School in Late Antique Athens and Alexandria'', page 147. University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt; Under the emperors, membership of the Musaeum was awarded to prominent scholars and statesmen, often as a reward to supporters of the emperor.&lt;ref name="watts148"&gt;Edward Jay Watts, (2008), ''City and School in Late Antique Athens and Alexandria'', page 148. University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor [[Caracalla]] suppressed the Musaeum in 216,&lt;ref name="Butler"&gt;Butler, Alfred, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=O3-yWUIs7TkC The Arab Conquest of Egypt – And the Last Thirty Years of the Roman Dominion]'', p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps as a temporary measure.&lt;ref name="watts147"/&gt; By this time, the center of learning in Alexandria had already moved to the [[Serapeum of Alexandria|Serapeum]].&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt;

==Destruction==
The last known references to Musaeum membership occur in the 260s.&lt;ref name="watts150"&gt;Edward Jay Watts, (2008), ''City and School in Late Antique Athens and Alexandria'', page 150. University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt; The Bruchion, the section of Alexandria that included the Musaeum, was probably destroyed by fire on the orders of Emperor [[Aurelian]] in 272, although we do not know for sure whether it still existed in 272, the area having already been set ablaze during the occupation by [[Julius Caesar]]. Scattered references in later sources suggest that a Musaeum was reestablished in the 4th century on a different site, but little is known about this later organisation and it is unlikely to have had the resources of its predecessor.&lt;ref name="watts150"/&gt; The mathematician [[Theon of Alexandria|Theon]] (ca. 335&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; ca. 405), father of [[Hypatia]], is described in the tenth century ''[[Suda]]'' as "the man from the Mouseion." It is not known what connection he actually had with the Musaeum. [[Zacharias Rhetor]] and [[Aeneas of Gaza]] both speak of a physical space known as the "Mouseion" in the later 5th century.&lt;ref name="watts150"/&gt;

==Legacy==
This original '''Musaeum''' or '''Institution of the Muses''' was the source for the modern usage of the word ''[[museum#Etymology|museum]]''. In early modern [[France]], it denoted as much a community of scholars brought together under one roof as it did the collections themselves. French and English writers referred to these collections as a "cabinet" as in "a [[cabinet of curiosities]]." A catalogue of the 17th century collection of [[John Tradescant the elder]] and his son [[John Tradescant the younger]] was the founding core of the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in [[Oxford]]. It was published as ''[[Musaeum Tradescantianum]]: or, a Collection of Rarities. Preserved at South-[[Lambeth]] near [[London]] by John Tradescant'', 1656.

'''Musical phrasing''' is the way a [[musician]] shapes a sequence of [[Musical note|notes]] in a passage of [[music]] to allow expression, much like when speaking English a [[phrase]] may be written identically but may be spoken differently, and is named for the interpretation of small units of time known as [[phrase (music)|phrases]] (half of a [[period (music)|period]]). A musician accomplishes this by interpreting the music—from memory or [[sheet music]]—by altering [[Musical tone|tone]], [[tempo]], [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]], [[Articulation (music)|articulation]], inflection, and other characteristics. Phrasing can emphasise a concept in the music or a message in the lyrics, or it can digress from the composer's intention, aspects of which are commonly indicated in [[musical notation]] called '''phrase marks''' or '''phrase markings'''. For example, accelerating the tempo or prolonging a note may add [[resolution (music)|tension]].

{{Quote|A ''phrase'' is a substantial musical thought, which ends with a musical punctuation called a [[cadence (music)|cadence]]. Phrases are created in music through an interaction of [[melody]], [[harmony]], and [[rhythm]].&lt;ref&gt;Benward, Bruce &amp; Saker, Marilyn (2003). ''Music: In Theory and Practice, Vol. I'', p.89. Seventh Edition. McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|978-0-07-294262-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Giuseppe Cambini]]—a composer, violinist, and music teacher of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]]—had this to say about [[bowed string instrument]]s, specifically [[violin]], phrasing:
{{quote|The [[bow stroke|bow]] can express the affections of the soul: but besides there being no signs that indicate them, such signs, even were one to invent them, would become so numerous that the music, already too full of indications, would become a formless mass to the eyes, almost impossible to decipher.  I should consider myself fortunate if I could only get a student to hear, through a small number of examples, the difference between bad and mediocre, mediocre and good, and good and excellent, in the diversity of expressions that one may give to the same passage.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://epub.library.ucla.edu/leguin/boccherini/section15.htm Nouvelle Méthode théorique et pratique pour le violon]" by Giuseppe Cambini ([http://epub.library.ucla.edu/leguin/boccherini/contents.htm ref])&lt;/ref&gt;|"Nouvelle Méthode théorique et pratique pour le violon". Paris, Naderman (c. 1803)}}

==Intuitive and analytical phrasing==

"There are two schools of thought on phrasing," says flautist Nancy Toff: "one more intuitive, the other more analytical. The intuitive school uses a verbal model, equating the function of phrasing with that of punctuation in language. Thus, said Chopin to a student, 'He who phrases incorrectly is like a man who does not understand the language he speaks.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toff |first=Nancy |year=1996 |title=The Flute Book: A Complete Guide for Students and Performers |page=150 |edition=Second |isbn=978-0-19-510502-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Problems linked with an analytical approach to phrasing occur particularly when the analytical approach is based only on the search for objective information, or (as is often the case) only concerned with the score:

{{quote|The reliance on the score for information about temporal structures reflects a more profound analytical difficulty. Structural information gleaned from the score is visually apprehended and as such is predisposed to visualist models of structure. These models are premised on symmetry and balance and on a timeless notion of "objective" structure. [...] Temporal and aurally-apprehended structures are denied reality because they cannot be said to "exist" in the way that spatial and visually apprehended structures do. [...] Musical investigations exhibit the Western prejudice toward visualism in the dependence on visual symmetry and balance. Information about structure from listening experience is suspect because it is considered "subjective" and is opposed to "objective" information from the score.|F. Joseph Smith&lt;ref&gt;Smith, F. Joseph (1989). ''Understanding the Musical Experience'', p.121-124. {{ISBN|978-2-88124-204-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Elision or reinterpretation==
{{anchor|elision|reinterpretation}}
In the [[musical analysis|analysis]] of 18th- and 19th-century Western [[music]], an '''elision''', '''overlap''', or rather '''reinterpretation''' (''Umdeutung''), is the perception, after the fact, of a ([[metre (music)|metrically]] weak) [[cadence (music)|cadential]] [[chord (music)|chord]] at the end of one [[phrase (music)|phrase]] as the (metrically strong) initial chord of the next phrase. Two phrases may overlap, making the beginning and ending of both happen at the same moment in time, or both phrases and [[Bar (music)#Hypermeasure|hypermeasures]] may overlap, making the last bar in the first hypermeasure and the first in the second. [[Charles Burkhart]] uses overlap and reinterpretation to distinguish between the overlap of phrases and of both phrase and measure-group, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Deborah (2005). ''Engaging Music: Essays in Music Analysis'', p.328, 330. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-517010-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burkhart, Charles. "The Phrase Rhythm of Chopin's A-flat Major Mazurka, Op. 59, No. 2", p.10, 11n14. Cited in Stein (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1864">A '''product naming convention''' is a process of product or good description or titling.  Consistent use of [[alphanumeric]] characters and separating devices defines a [[Naming convention]].  The naming [[convention (norm)|convention]] will create an identifier for that version or model of product or goods.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maxim-ic.com/qa/info/naming_conventions Maxim Product Naming Conventions]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://ics.nxp.com/products/naming/ Logic product naming conventions]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Character use can interrupt with computerized software management systems which further limits the scope. The use of [[Universal Product Code|UPC]] codes may come to replace the need for such naming conventions as bar code readers become common. Speakable product name codes or strict names are still needed for marketing and customer service aspects.  A properly identified product can lead to sales and properly targeted support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conversations.nokia.com/2010/03/02/nokia-naming-conventions/ Nokia naming conventions]&lt;/ref&gt;

Naming can be separated by a shift of characters.  Heritage concepts like character segments are common.  

;Simple Names
:1234H67
:HGrD
:11-2044
:RR-1234
;Complex Names
:ABC-04-DEF-GHI
:AB035NN5T
:21T-4000-97

==Issues==
# Variable naming lengths could be hard to quickly verify.
# Numeric Names could overlap from vendor to vendor.
# Naming could distract from product purpose.
# Mixed alphanumeric codes using similar characters (e.g. uppercase ''I'' and the digit ''1'', the letter ''O'' and the digit ''0'') can cause mistakes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2712">A '''roof stomp''' is a tradition in the [[United States Air Force]] in which servicemembers - typically officers - mount the roof of the home of a new unit commander, [[colonel]] or other higher-ranking officer and stomp on the roof.  The event originated as a "no-notice hospitality check” in flying units, where pilots proceeded to a commander’s residence to check their ability to entertain the group with beverages, food, and entertainment.  Frequently, the location or target is determined based on not being present when the majority of a squadron determines a squadron party needs to happen.  Members then proceed directly to their squadron mate's house and stomp on the roof, in an attempt to be let in.  Originally these events were intended as surprises, but more frequently now, the member's significant other is notified so that he or she can prepare and make necessary arrangements for the gathering.  It is an "informal celebration recognizing a new commander, a retirement or other special event."&lt;ref name="Brzozowske"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.warren.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123136499|title= CGOC returns porch stomp to Warren colonels|author= Brooke Brzozowske |date= 20 February 2009|work= |publisher= F.E.

According to Greg Tims, &lt;blockquote&gt;Traditionally, a roof stomp is where you greet a new commander or celebrate some sort of special occasion by climbing up on the commander's roof and begin to make a LOT of noise while others are outside banging on the windows and doors. When he or she opens the door, the commander invites the group in for food and drink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.warren.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123173093|title= Commander: Impressed with the men and women of the 90th Missile Wing |author= Greg Tims |date= 16 October 2009|work= |publisher= F.E.

'''Sarah J. Mahler''' (born 1959) is an American author and cultural anthropologist.

==Background==
Sarah J. Mahler was born in York, Pennsylvania but spent most of her formative years in rural upstate New York in the western [[Catskill Mountains]]. She earned a bachelor's degree in Liberal Arts from [[Amherst College]] in 1982, a year later than her graduating class because after her sophomore year, she took a year leave, moved to Colombia, and immersed herself in a different culture and language.

Upon graduating, she worked in Manhattan for several years before continuing her education at [[Columbia University]], earning a master's degree in [[Anthropology]] in 1989, and a Ph.D. in 1992. While in school and living predominantly in Latin American neighborhoods in New York City, she taught English as a second language for free, and became trained in immigration law. During those years she also worked with refugees fleeing violent wars in Central America.

==Career==
After graduation, Mahler taught at the [[University of Vermont]] from 1992 to 1997 in the Anthropology department, and [[Florida International University]] from 1997, where she continues to teach courses in the interdisciplinary department of Global and Sociocultural Studies. Her academic expertise is in cultural anthropology and international migration from Latin America and the Caribbean to the United States. She joined a group of anthropologists and other scholars seeking to shift migration studies from just examining immigrants’ lives in their new country to a more comprehensive approach called “[[transnational migration]]” which researches how people who migrate across international borders nonetheless retain ties to their homelands, and how their cultural practices and identities reflect influence from previous and present contexts. Mahler’s contributions to this paradigm shift in migration studies have focused on how migrants’ gender relations typically shift, even for family members who themselves do not migrate.

In 2004, Mahler served as director of her department’s graduate studies program and in that year she oversaw a major shift in the graduate curriculum. In 2005 she was promoted to Director of the Center for Transnational and Comparative Studies at Florida International University. She served in that capacity in charge of numerous international study programs until 2008 when the center was closed for budgetary reasons. She then embarked on a major shift in her research, returning to an early passion for how people learn culture that she had wanted to pursue since her daughter Sophia was born.

Since 2008 she has dedicated herself wholly to studying the wide-ranging interdisciplinary literatures on the brain and how infants and children learn in general, and how they learn culture in particular. The results of this research are being published (see below).

==Honors and achievements==
As Central Americans’ story had not been told during the very difficult years of civil wars in the 1980s and early 1990s, Mahler decided to focus her dissertation on highlighting their plight; this was eventually published in two books. The first, ''American Dreaming: Immigrant Life on the Margins'' (Princeton 1995) was reviewed by ''The New York Times'', has been used by scores of faculty teaching courses on area studies, and has helped a train a generation of new researchers on immigration. It remains an academic best seller despite being published almost two decades ago.

In 1994, she was awarded a prestigious research fellowship at the [[Russell Sage Foundation]] in New York City, one of the country’s premier social science fellowships. During her residency, Mahler finished ''American Dreaming'' and wrote her second book, ''Salvadorans in Suburbia: Symbiosis and Conflict''.

Due to her work with immigrants and refugees, in 1996 she was honored by the Central American Refugee Center for years of advocacy in defense of human rights.

In 2011, Mahler was awarded the first Provost Award for Graduate Student Mentorship conferred by FIU’s Graduate School.

Mahler's next book, ''Culture as Comfort: The Many Things You Already Know [but might not realize] About Culture'', was due to be published by Pearson Education in the summer of 2012. The book is the first step in a larger project aimed at shifting people’s everyday understandings of culture toward focusing on how creative and positive we can be culturally, instead of divisive and destructive.

==Personal==
With her husband, Miguel Marante, Mahler lives a peripatetic life from their RV. Her daughter, Sophia Dominguez-Mahler, is in college. Mahler also has three stepchildren and seven step-grandchildren.

A lack of oversight and a lack of proper training for scientists have led to the rise of plagiarism and research misconduct in [[India]].&lt;ref name="In India, plagiarism is on the rise"&gt;[http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/india/090921/did-you-write-yaar-india-plagiarism-the-rise In India, plagiarism is on the rise], [[GlobalPost]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- a reliable source should be one published in peer-reviewed journals, this website report does not meet [[WP:RS]] --&gt; India does not have a statutory body to deal with [[scientific misconduct]] in academia, like the [[Office of Research Integrity]] in the US, and hence cases of plagiarism are often dealt in ad-hoc fashion with different routes being followed in different cases. In most cases, a public and media outcry leads to an investigation either by institutional authorities or by independent enquiry committees. Plagiarists have in some cases been suspended, removed or demoted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=INTELLECTUAL FRAUD:Punishment For Plagiarised Research Must Be Severe| work = The Statesman

This has led to calls for establishment of an independent ethics body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =India 'needs independent ethics body' says watchdog| work = SciDev.net| author= TV Padma|date=27 February 2007|  url =http://www.scidev.net/dossiers/index.cfm?fuseaction=dossierreaditem&amp;dossier=5&amp;type=1&amp;itemid=3445&amp;language=1
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Society for Scientific Values ==
The Society for Scientific Values is an independent body of scientists with the goal of upholding ethics in the Indian Scientific community. In absence of a statutory body to investigate academic misconduct, the society has been acting as an independent watchdog over the years. The society has been active in recent past over several cases involving plagiarism. [[Kasturi Lal Chopra|K. L. Chopra]], ex-director of [[Indian Institute of Technology]], [[Kharagpur]] is currently the president of the society while N. Raghuram of [[GGS Indraprastha University]] is the secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificvalues.org |title=Society For Scientific Values – Homepage |publisher=Scientificvalues.org |date= |accessdate=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plagiarism in IIMs==

===IIM Ahmedabad===
On  17 August 1992, a student complained to the Director IIM "While doing my summer project, I had to do some modelling and data analysis. I had carried my copies of [[Rick Levin|Levin]] (''Statistics for Management''), and [[William Baumol|Baumol]] (''Economic Theory and Operations Analysis'') along. From the organisation I was in, I borrowed copies of [[Harvey M. Wagner|Wagner]] (''Principles of Operations Research'') and ''Quantitative Techniques for Managerial Decisions'' by U. K. Srivastava (a CMA Prof. at IIMA), G. V. Shenoy, and S. C. Sharma. As I was browsing through the books, I came across a most interesting thing. At several places, the Srivastava, Shenoy, Sharma book had simply lifted stuff from the other three books (Baumol, Levin, and Wagner) and no references anywhere in the book". Upon enquiry a Committee, based on a report by a student, found that the book ''Quantitative Techniques for Managerial Decisions'' by U. K. Srivastava, G. V. Shenoy, and S. C. Sharma had copied without acknowledgment of the source at least at 10 different places including 5 foreign books and some other Indian books, such as Baumol, Levin and Wagner (all books were published prior to the publication of the book).&lt;ref&gt;http://indiankanoon.org/doc/946037/&lt;/ref&gt;

===IIM Indore===
On 3 March 2012, the director of [[IIM Indore]], N. Ravichandran, has been asked by the Centre to respond to an accusation of plagiarism against him and another senior faculty member of the institute, Omkar D. Palsule-Desai. They had submitted a paper—The management case on "Euthanasia: Should it be Lawful or Otherwise?". Ahmedabad-based researcher K.R. Narendrababu has complained that the paper was sourced heavily from a Supreme Court judgment without adequate attribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120304/jsp/nation/story_15210111.jsp | location=Calcutta, India | work=The Telegraph | title=Plagiarism finger at IIM head | date=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One month later, on 12 April, veteran industrialist Mr LN Jhunjhunwala, who is also the chairman of the [[Indian Institute of Management Indore|Indian Institute of Management]] (IIM), Indore's board of governors resigned citing major differences with Dr N Ravichandran. Another board member and Bhopal-based retired IAS officer Dr MN Buch also resigned.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pagalguy.com/news/why-chairman-member-iim-indores-board-a-8796288/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-04-13/indore/31336960_1_iim-indore-chairman-iim-i-board-iim-indore | work=The Times Of India | title=IIM-Indore Chairman resigns; alleges irregularities - The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other instances of plagiarism ==

=== Prof. B.S. Rajput controversy ===
The most high-profile and widely publicised controversy in India has been that of Prof. B. S. Rajput and colleagues in the field of Theoretical Physics.

Prof. B.S. Rajput was the vice-chancellor of [[Kumaon University]], India in 2002 when various physicists in India started a website alleging that some of his papers claimed authorship of work, reported earlier by other researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/physics_plagiarism/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027034050/http://geocities.com/physics_plagiarism/ |archivedate=27 October 2009 |title=Physics Plagiarism Alert |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=27 October 2009 |accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal allegation was that a paper published by S.C. Joshi and B.S. Rajput entitled "Axion-dilaton black holes with SL(2,Z) symmetry through APT-FGP model" in ''[[Europhysics Letters]]'', Vol. 57, No. 5, was entirely copied from a six-year-old paper by Renata Kallosh of Stanford in ''[[Physical Review D]]'', Vol 54, No. 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =   The physics of plagiarism| author =   R. Ramchandra| work =   [[The Frontline]]| date =   8 November 2002| url =   http://frontlineonnet.com/fl1922/stories/20021108003508400.htm| deadurl =   yes| archiveurl =   https://web.archive.org/web/20071014024552/http://frontlineonnet.com/fl1922/stories/20021108003508400.htm| archivedate =   14 October 2007| df =   dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the campaign very soon included three other papers by Prof. Rajput and colleagues as plagiarised papers. One of these papers "BPS Spectra of Dyons in Four-Dimensional ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 Supersymmetric Theories" was later recalled by the journal ''[[Progress of Theoretical Physics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Manu P. Singh and B. S. Rajput* |url=http://ptp.ipap.jp/cgi-bin/getarticle?magazine=PTP&amp;volume=102&amp;number=4&amp;page=843-858 |title=843–858 |journal=[[Progress of Theoretical Physics]] |date= |accessdate=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On publication of the site, Prof. Rajput threatened to take legal action against the website, maintaining that the paper was written by Mr. Joshi, one of his students, without prior approval from him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Plagiarism scandal brewing| work = [[The Hindu]] | author= N. Gopal Raj  |date=27 September 2002
| url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2002/09/27/stories/2002092702061300.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the site was endorsed by over 40 Indian physicists. In addition, seven physicists including Nobel Laureate, [[Steven Chu|S. Chu]], [[Robert B. Laughlin|R. Laughlin]] and [[Douglas D. Osheroff|D. Osheroff]] wrote to the president of India, [[APJ Abdul Kalam]] requesting an investigation in this matter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stanford.edu/dept/physics/publications/PDFfiles/india.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The situation became murkier when Prof Kavita Pandey, head of the Physics department at Kumaon University claimed that she was suspended by the university as she brought this issue to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Kumaon prof says she blew plagiarism whistle on V-C, so he suspended her| work = [[The Indian Express]]| author= SMA Kazmi
|date=5 October 2002 | url=http://www.indianexpress.com/india-news/full_story.php?content_id=10730 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In midst of all this blame game, the president of India asked the Governor of Uttaranchal who was also the chancellor of the Kumaon University to institute an enquiry to investigate the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =  Probe into plagiarism charge| work = [[The Frontline]]|date=8 November 2002 | url=http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1925/stories/20021220008813400.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee led by a retired judge of Allahabad high court Justice S.R. Singh consisted of Prof K.B. Powar, former chief of the [[Association of Indian Universities]], New Delhi, Prof Indira Nath, former secretary of the Society of Scientific Values and AIIMS faculty member and physicist Prof R. Rajaraman of JNU. The committee presented its report in February 2003 upholding the plagiarism charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Probe panel upholds plagiarism charges against Kumaon V-C| work = [[The Indian Express]]| author= P. Bagla |date=4 February 2003 | url=http://www.indianexpress.com/india-news/full_story.php?content_id=17786 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prof. Rajput maintained that he has personally done no harm and it was his student's fault.

=== Gopal Kundu controversy ===

A controversy erupted in [[National Centre for Cell Science]] (NCCS), Pune in 2006 when an anonymous mail alleged that the authors (H. Rangaswami and Colleagues from the group of [[Gopal Kundu|Dr. Gopal Kundu]]) may have misrepresented data (especially through [[Western blot]]s) in a paper published in ''[[Journal of Biological Chemistry]]''. The allegation was that they had rehashed the same set of data which they had published earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Prof. K. Kumar controversy===
In yet another high-profile case involving a Director of an Indian technical institute, a web campaign, similar to the campaign started by physicists in India, reported plagiarism in papers published by Prof. Kalyan Kumar and colleagues at North Eastern Regional Institute of Science and Technology, [[NERIST]], India. Three papers have been reported to have similarity to works reported earlier. Two of these, "Improved PID controller using fuzzy precompensated algorithm for PMBLDC motor drive" (''[[AMSE Advances in Modelling and Analysis C]]'', Volume 61, number 1-2, January 2006, Page (s) 1–15) and "Optimum PI controller for Permanent Magnet Brushless DC Motor" (''[[Electrical Review]]'', Volume 12, No 6, June 2005, Pages 16 –23) have been shown to be very similar to earlier papers by Bhim Singh, AHN Reddy and SS Murthy of [[Indian Institute of Technology]], Delhi. The papers of Singh, Reddy and Murthy, viz "Hybrid fuzzy logic proportional plus conventional integral-derivative controller for permanent magnet brushless DC motor" (''[[IEEE]] [[International Conference on Industrial Technology]] 2000'', Volume 2, 19–22 January 2000, pp.&amp;nbsp;185–191) and "Gain Scheduling Control of Permanent Magnet Brushless dc Motor" (''[[Journal of Institution of Engineers]]'' : India EL, Vol 84, September 2003 ) predate the papers of Kumar and Singh by five years.

In yet another controversy, the same group of authors have claimed to publish a paper entitled, "Sensorless control of permanent magnet brushless dc motors" in ''Electrical Review'' (Volume 14, No 1, January 2007, Pages 10–14), which has been reported to have high similarity to a thirteen-year-old paper entitled "Sensorless control of permanent magnet AC motors" by K. Rajshekara and A. Kawamura from EPS Anderson and Yokohama University, published in ''Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Industrial Electronics, Control and Instrumentation'', 1994.

===Anna University controversy===
Another controversy occurred in 2007, this time surrounding authors from [[Anna University]] and [[Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research]] (IGCAR) publishing an article in the ''[[Journal of Materials Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaenews.com/pdf/76169.pdf |title=Anna University in plagiarism scandal |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article written by K. Muthukumar, T. Mathews, S. Selladurai and R. Bokalawela was reported to be a reproduction of an article published earlier in ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' (PNAS) by David Andersson and others at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]], Sweden. In a correction published online, the journal reported that the article 'does not just plagiarise the results presented in the PNAS paper but actually copies most of it word for word'. The journal had started an investigation and is also working with officials at the two institutions. The three authors other than the first author have distanced themselves from the paper and the first author has accepted his mistake.

===Prof Ashok Pandey controversy===
Ashok Pandey is a scientist of the National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology of India's Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). He is the editor of several well known international journals in Biotechnology. He appears in the list of most cited authors and received the Thomson Scientific Citation Laureate Award 2006. His paper cited as K. Balakrishnan and A. Pandey (1996) Influence of amino acids on the synthesis of cyclosporin A by Tolypocladium inflatum. Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 45: 800–803 which was published as an original article in July 1996, was an extensively plagiarised version of J. Lee and S.N. Agathos (1989) Effect of amino acids on the production of cyclosporin A by Tolypocladium inflatum. Biotechnol Lett 11:77–82. This was pointed out by Agathos in his letter to the Editor of the journal.&lt;ref name="Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 1997"&gt;Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (1997) 48:432–433&lt;/ref&gt; The Editor-in-Chief of the journal, Alexander Steinbüchel, confronted Ashok Pandey with the evidence and decided that "manuscripts from K. Balakrishnan and A. Pandey will no longer be considered for publication in this journal, and the Editors-in-Chief of other journals covering aspects of microbiology and /or biotechnology will be informed about this matter".&lt;ref name="Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 1997"/&gt;

===Prof M.R. Adhikari and L.K. Pramanik controversy===
A retired academic at Calcutta University, Mahimaranjan Adhikari and his Ph.d student L.K. Pramanik, have been found to be indulging in Plagiarism, courtesy the [[American Mathematical Society]]. AMS has cautioned universities worldwide regarding this incidence. The papers reported to be plagiarised are 'The connectivity of squares of box graphs', 'On edge-connectivity of inserted graphs' and 'Factors of inserted graphs'. The reviews may be found in MathSciNet. The original work was carried out by T Zamfirescu's in the 1970s. An investigation by Calcutta university found these to be true and the university is planning action against the concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prof. M.R. Adhikari for his part has shifted the entire blame on the research scholar Lakshmikanto Pramanik who had "used his name without consent". A reply to the editor of the South East Asian Bulletin of Mathematics (MR2400443) confirms this.

'''''Soccer Kid''''' is a [[platform game|platform]] video game created by UK-based developer [[Krisalis]]&lt;ref name="superplay"/&gt; and released in 1993 for the [[Commodore Amiga]], 1994 for the [[Super NES]],&lt;ref name="superplay"&gt;{{cite news|title=Four Long-awaited Conversions|date=Oct 1993|work=[[Super Play]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Personal computer|PC]], [[Amiga CD32]] and [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer]]. Its title for the Super NES in the United States is '''''The Adventures of Kid Kleets'''''. It was re-released for the [[Atari Jaguar]] in 2000, the [[Game Boy Advance]] on September 30, 2002 and the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] on December 13, 2003.

The goal of the game is to guide a little soccer player boy through various levels, using his soccer ball as the main tool. The player character can perform runs, shots, bicycle kicks, headers and other sorts of soccer moves to either advance in the level or eliminate enemies.

==Story==
The game begins when Soccer Kid is waiting for the World Cup to start. However, the alien pirate Scab is scanning for trophies to add to his collection and starts beaming up the World Cup using his spaceship. While he beams the trophy into space, he collides with a satellite, blowing the Cup into five pieces that fall in random places around the world. It is up to Soccer Kid to recover the pieces. The Cup pieces are located in England, Italy, Russia, Japan, and the United States, in their respective order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Adventures of Kid Kleets (Super NES)|url = http://www.ign.com/games/soccer-kid/snes-496521|website = IGN|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[File:Soccer Kid Gameplay.jpg|alt=Soccer Kid dodging an enemy in Italy.|left|thumb|Soccer Kid in Italy.]]
By pressing different buttons at the title screen, the player can change the colours of Soccer Kid's clothes. This way, the protagonist can be a fan of the player's favorite team. Each country has three levels that the player must navigate through. Soccer Kid can perform various types of soccer moves to defeat enemies and get to hard to reach areas. The player starts out with two hearts but by opening random chests scattered throughout the game, they can get more hearts. At the end of each third level, the player must fight a boss, based on stereotypical people associated with their respective country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Adventures of Kid Kleets|url = http://www.gamespot.com/the-adventures-of-kid-kleets/user-reviews/2200-227868/|website = GameSpot|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the player must always explore each level to find soccer cards, which are crucial to getting the cup at the end of the game. Once a country is completed and all the cards in that country are collected, Soccer Kid is transported to a bonus level where he must collect all the food against limited time in order for a piece of the cup to be obtainable.

==Reception==
Amiga Power gave the Amiga version a score of 88% with a review by [[Stuart Campbell (games journalist)|Stuart Campbell]]. He criticized the player character's moves as being too "fiddly": "you have to stop, line up your shot, get into trick shot mode and then actually do it. This all looks great and stylish and everything, but it can really slow the pace of the game down on occasion - sometimes when you're zipping along, you'd give anything just to be able to jump on a baddie's head and sort him out then-and-there without a lot of hanging around." However, he praised the graphics and particularly the "fearsome" difficulty, saying it gave the game good value for money. He compared the game to the acclaimed ''[[Arabian Nights (video game)|Arabian Nights]]'', saying it was even better due to the superior control and greater focus on platform action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Stuart|title=Game Reviews: Soccer Kid|journal=Amiga Power|date=September 1993|issue=29|pages=28–30|url=http://amr.abime.net/review_1349|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3DO version received a 6.2 out of 10 from ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''. They praised the "technique" and "excellent graphics", but said the sound effects were lacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Soccer Kid Review|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=65|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=December 1994|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[GamePro]]'' gave it a wholly positive review, citing smooth controls, strong sound effects, good variety of musical tracks, and exceptional graphics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Soccer Kid|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=66|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=January 1995|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing the 3DO version, [[AllGame]]'s Shawn Sackenheim wrote that ''Soccer Kid'' is "an impressive action/platformer that manages to be just different enough to warrant investigation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=2410&amp;tab=review |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116053024/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=2410&amp;tab=review |archivedate=2014-11-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Standard Catalog of World Paper Money''''' is a well-known [[Paper money catalog|catalogue]] of [[banknote]]s that is published by [[Krause Publications]] in three volumes. These catalogues are commonly known in the numismatic trade as the '''Pick catalogues''', as the numbering system was originally compiled by [[Albert Pick]], but are also referred to as "Krause" or "SCWPM." Since the mid-1980s the titles have been owned by Krause Publications, and from 1994–2016 were under the editorship of George S. Cuhaj, and subsequently by Tracy L. Schmidt.

==Numbering system==
The numbering system uses an integer to identify a note. Some varieties also have an alphabetic prefix, with a capital letter or letters.  
* A prefix of "A" or "B" is used to insert older series which were not cataloged when the numbering system was established. 
* A prefix of "CS" is used for made-for-collector merchandise such as souvenir folders, uncut pairs/strips/sheets, special serial numbers, booklets, etc.; the numbers after "CS" are sometimes sequential (1, 2, 3, etc.) in which case these products are listed after all regular notes, and other times are the equivalent of the normal note, in which case these items are listed right after the regular version of each note.
* A prefix of "FX" is used for Foreign Exchange Certificates.  
* A prefix of "M" designates military issues (often occupation issues, or military scrip); these have been moved to the "Specialized" catalog.  
* A prefix of "R" is used for certain regional notes, which have also been moved to the "Specialized" catalog.  
* A prefix of "S" is used to represent "Specialized" issues which are cataloged separately (often, though inconsistently, private banks, regional issues, emergency issues, local notes, etc.).  

In common usage, but not in the catalog itself, it is a common practice to prefix "P" to the catalog number (and any prefixes or suffixes, to designate that this is a "Pick" number; however, this is not a practice of the catalog themselves.  If there are prefixes, in this usage, they will follow the "P" (e.g. "P5," "PS101a," "PM3" or "PFX").
 
Inconsistently, if a note has signature or date or other variants, then a lower case letter follows (e.g. P120a, P120b, P120c, etc.); in some cases though, multiple dates are assigned to a single variant; e.g "1936–1940; 1942; 1945."  From edition to edition, these variety letters may change, as additional dates and signatures are found, and as the editors decide to add more granularity.
* A suffix of "ct" is used for color trial proofs (sometimes listed as "tc")
* A suffix of "r" is used for either a "remainder" or a "replacement" note.  
* A suffix of "p" is used for "proof" notes
* A suffix of "s" is used for "specimen" notes.  
* A suffix of "tc" is used for "trial color proofs" 
* A suffix of "x" is used to denote certain varieties, such as counterfeits or errors.

Where there are multiple versions of proofs, remainders or specimens, and occasionally other variations, they are often cataloged with a number after the letter, e.g. "p1" or "p2."   

If a number needs to be inserted between two numbers, then in some cases, the section is renumbered -- which creates confusion, and some collectors will annotate this with the previous number in parentheses .. e.g. 6(5) would indicate the current Pick number is 6, but it was once 5.  But in other cases, the entries are not renumbered, and then the format is to use a suffix capital letter (e.g. P120'''A''').

===Number===
The sorting of notes is usually by issue series/date, then ascending by denomination.

===Variants===
Regular variants start with the letter a, b, c, ... Error notes usually bears the letter x, while specimen notes have the letter s. Unissued remainders (mostly 19th century incomplete printings) have the letter r, while known 20th century notes issued with replacement serial numbers would also have the letter r. Color trials bear the variant letters ct. When multiple specimens are known, then the format used is s1, s2.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="69369">[[File:Matura2005 ILOSzczecin.jpg|thumb|Young adults in Poland sit for their [[Matura#Matura in Poland|Matura exams]].  The Matura is standardized so that universities can easily compare results from students across the entire country.]]
A '''standardized test''' is a [[Test (assessment)|test]] that is administered and scored in a consistent, or "standard", manner. Standardized tests are designed in such a way that the questions, conditions for administering, scoring procedures, and interpretations are consistent&lt;ref name="Sylvan"&gt;Sylvan Learning glossary, retrieved online, source no longer available&lt;/ref&gt; and are administered and scored in a predetermined, standard manner.&lt;ref name="Popham"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Popham | first1 = W.J. | year = 1999 | title = Why standardized tests don't measure educational quality | url = | journal = Educational Leadership | volume = 56 | issue = 6| pages = 8–15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any test in which the same test is given in the same manner to all test takers, and graded in the same manner for everyone, is a standardized test. Standardized tests do not need to be [[high-stakes test]]s, time-limited tests, or [[multiple-choice test]]s. The questions can be simple or complex.  The subject matter among school-age students is frequently academic skills, but a standardized test can be given on nearly any topic, including [[driving test]]s, creativity, [[Personality test|personality]], [[professional ethics]], or other attributes.

The opposite of standardized testing is ''non-standardized testing'', in which either significantly different tests are given to different test takers, or the same test is assigned under significantly different conditions (e.g., one group is permitted far less time to complete the test than the next group) or evaluated differently (e.g., the same answer is counted right for one student, but wrong for another student).

Most everyday quizzes and tests taken by students typically meet the definition of a standardized test:  everyone in the class takes the same test, at the same time, under the same circumstances, and all of the students are graded by their teacher in the same way.  However, the term ''standardized test'' is most commonly used to refer to tests that are given to larger groups, such as a test taken by all adults who wish to acquire a license to have a particular kind of job, or by all students of a certain age.

Because everyone gets the same test and the same grading system, standardized tests are often perceived as being fairer than non-standardized test. Such tests are often thought of as fairer and more objective than a system in which some students get an easier test and others get a more difficult test. That perception, which may or may not be accurate, depends entirely on the purpose for the test. If a teacher wishes to determine individual children's skills with respect to a specific activity, tests other than those that are standardized are more effective. Standardized tests are designed to permit reliable comparison of outcomes across all test takers, because everyone is taking the same test.&lt;ref name="Phelps"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nonpartisaneducation.org/Review/Essays/v4n3.htm|title=Role &amp; Importance of Testing|last=Phelps|first=Richard P.|website=nonpartisaneducation.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; While that point is granted, often the children tested have not been exposed to the same materials found on those standardized tests. Equally often, such tests are constructed by individuals who have no knowledge of the test-takers beyond their age and/or grade level. Age and/or grade level, however, are poor indicators of what children have learned.  As a result, conclusions drawn from the results can easily be wrong.&lt;ref name="jojoem"/&gt; The prevalence of standardized testing in formal education has also been criticized for many reasons.

==Definition==
The definition of a standardized test has changed somewhat over time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CSt1AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=423|title=21st Century Education: A Reference Handbook|last=Olson|first=Amy M.|last2=Sabers|first2=Darrell|date=October 2008|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=|isbn=9781452265995|editor-last=Good|editor-first=Thomas L.|location=|pages=423–430|language=en|chapter=Standardized Tests|doi=10.4135/9781412964012.n46}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, standardized tests were defined as those in which the conditions and content were equal for everyone taking the test, regardless of when, where, or by whom the test was given or graded. The purpose of this standardization is to make sure that the scores reliably indicate the abilities or skills being measured, and not other things, such as different instructions about what to do if the test taker does not know the answer to a question.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

By the beginning of the 21st century, the focus shifted away from a strict sameness of conditions towards equal fairness of conditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, a test taker with a broken wrist might write more slowly because of the injury, and it would be more fair, and produce a more reliable understanding of the test taker's actual knowledge, if that person were given a few more minutes to write down the answers to a most test.  However, if the purpose of the test is to see how quickly the student could write, then this would become a [[Special education#Modifications|modification]] of the content, and no longer a standardized test.

==History==
===China===

{{main|Imperial examination}}
The earliest evidence of standardized testing was in [[China]], during the Han Dynasty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/112424/Chinese-civil-service|title=Chinese civil service|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the [[imperial examination]]s covered the [[Six Arts]] which included music, archery, horsemanship, arithmetic, writing, and knowledge of the rituals and ceremonies of both public and private parts.  These exams were used to select employees for the state bureaucracy.

Later, sections on military strategies, civil law, revenue and taxation, agriculture and geography were added to the testing. In this form, the examinations were institutionalized for more than a millennium.

Today, standardized testing remains widely used, most famously in the [[Gaokao]] system.

===UK===
Standardized testing was introduced into Europe in the early 19th century, modeled on the Chinese [[mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarin]] examinations,&lt;ref name="MB"/&gt; through the advocacy of British colonial administrators, the most "persistent" of which was Britain's consul in [[Guangzhou]], [[China]], Thomas Taylor Meadows.&lt;ref name="MB"/&gt; Meadows warned of the collapse of the British Empire if standardized testing was not implemented throughout the empire immediately.&lt;ref name="MB"/&gt;

Prior to their adoption, standardized testing was not traditionally a part of Western pedagogy; based on the skeptical and open-ended tradition of debate inherited from Ancient Greece, Western academia favored non-standardized assessments using [[essay]]s written by students. It is because of this, that the first European implementation of standardized testing did not occur in Europe proper, but in [[British India]].&lt;ref name="APH"&gt;Kazin, Edwards, and Rothman (2010), 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the Chinese use of standardized testing, in the early 19th century, British "company managers hired and promoted employees based on competitive examinations in order to prevent corruption and favoritism."&lt;ref name="APH"/&gt; This practice of standardized testing was later adopted in the late 19th century by the British mainland. The parliamentary debates that ensued made many references to the "Chinese mandarin system."&lt;ref name="MB"&gt;Mark and Boyer (1996), 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was from Britain that standardized testing spread, not only throughout the [[British Commonwealth]], but to [[Europe]] and then America.&lt;ref name="MB"/&gt; Its spread was fueled by the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The  increase in number of school students during and after the [[Industrial Revolution]], as a result of [[compulsory education]] laws, decreased the use of open-ended assessment, which was harder to mass-produce and assess objectively due to its intrinsically subjective nature. For instance, measurement error is easy to determine in standardized testing, whereas in open-ended assessment, graders have more individual discretion and therefore are more likely to produce unfair results through [[unconscious bias]].  When the score depends upon the graders' individual preferences, then the result an individual student receives depends upon who grades the test.

More recently, standardized testing has been shaped in part, by the ease and low cost of grading of multiple-choice tests by computer. Though the process is more difficult than grading multiple-choice tests electronically, essays can also be graded by computer.  In other instances, essays and other open-ended responses are graded according to a pre-determined assessment [[rubric]] by trained graders.  For example, at Pearson, all essay graders have four-year university degrees, and a majority are current or former classroom teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Grading the Common Core: No Teaching Experience Required|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/23/us/grading-the-common-core-no-teaching-experience-required.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2015-06-22|access-date = 2015-10-06|issn = 0362-4331|first = Motoko|last = Rich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Further|List of standardized tests in the United States}}
Standardized testing has been a part of American education since the 1800s, but the widespread reliance on standardized is largely a 20th-century phenomenon. For instance the College Entrance Examination Board did not begin standardized testing in connection to higher education until 1900. The College Entrance Examination Board was established and in 1901, the first examinations were administered around the country in nine subjects. This test was implemented with the idea of creating standardized admissions for the United States in northeastern elite universities. Originally, the test was also meant for top boarding school in order to standardize curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Darity Jr|first1=William|title=International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences.|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T003&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;searchResultsType=SingleTab&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=5&amp;docId=GALE%7CCX3045302589&amp;docType=Topic+overview&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;contentSegment=&amp;prodId=GVRL.corecollection&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CCX3045302589&amp;searchId=R1&amp;userGroupName=pcc&amp;inPS=true|website=Encyclopedia for Background Information|publisher=Gale Cengage Learning|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With origins in [[World War I]] the [[Army Alpha]] and [[Army Beta|Beta]] tests developed by [[Robert Yerkes]] and colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J., "A Nation of Morons", ''[[New Scientist]]'' (6 May 1982), 349–352.&lt;/ref&gt; Before then, immigration in the mid-19th century contributed to the growth of standardized tests in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Robert. "Standardized Tests." Encyclopedia of Educational Reform and Dissent. SAGE Publications, INC. 2010. 853–856.Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Standardized tests were used in immigration when people first came over to test social roles and find social power and status.&lt;ref&gt;Garrison, Mark J. A Measure of Failure: The Political Origins of Standardized Testing. Albany: State University of New York, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally the standardized test was made of essays and was not intended for widespread testing. French psychologist Alfred Binet begins developing a standardized test of intelligence, work that would eventually be incorporated into a version of the modern IQ test, dubbed the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Test. The College Board then designed the SAT(Scholar Aptitude Test) in 1926 for a broader IQ test. Notably, the Army IQ tests were what the first SAT test was based on in order to determine a student’s intelligence, problem solving skills, and critical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Darity Jr|first1=William|title=International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences.|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T003&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;searchResultsType=SingleTab&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=1&amp;docId=GALE%7CCX3045302589&amp;docType=Topic+overview&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;contentSegment=&amp;prodId=GVRL.corecollection&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CCX3045302589&amp;searchId=R1&amp;userGroupName=pcc&amp;inPS=true|website=Encyclopedias for Background Information|publisher=Gale Cengage Learning|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1959, [[Everett Franklin Lindquist|Everett Lindquist]] offered the [[ACT (test)|ACT]] (American College Testing) for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, Dan. "Standardized Testing." Time. Time Inc., 11 Dec. 2009.

Large population state testing began in the 1970s, and in the 1980s America began to assess nationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stiggins|first1=Richard|title=Assessment Crisis: The Absence Of Assessment FOR Learning|journal=Phi Delta Kappan|date=2002|url=http://beta.edtechpolicy.org/CourseInfo/edhd485/AssessmentCrisis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, together 45 states is annual spending on assessments cost $27 per student and $669 million overall. However, once test involved administrative costs were included the cost per student increased to $1100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Strauss|first1=Valerie|title=Five Reasons Standardized Testing Isn't Going to Let Up|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2015/03/11/five-reasons-standardized-testing-isnt-likely-to-let-up/|accessdate=26 January 2017|agency=The Washington Post|publisher=The Washington Post|date=March 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for the federal government to make meaningful comparisons across a highly de-centralized (locally controlled) public education system has also contributed to the debate about standardized testing, including the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act|Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965]] that required standardized testing in public schools. [[List of United States federal legislation|U.S. Public Law]] 107-110, known as the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] of 2001, further ties public school funding to standardized testing. The goal of No Child Left Behind was to improve the education system in the United States by holding school and teachers accountable and attempting to close the educational gap between minority and non-minority children in public schools. Students' results on standardized tests were used to allocate funds and other resources such as teachers and administrators to schools.  This policy does not provide a federal standard for schools, but allows each state to set their own standards.&lt;ref&gt;"History and Background of No Child Left Behind".

Web. 12 October 2015. http://www.brighthubeducation.com/student-assessment-tools/3140-history-of-the-no-child-left-behind-act/&lt;/ref&gt; The Every Student Succeeds Act replaced the NCLB. It was signed into law by President Obama on December 10, 2015. This act was created in order to revise the provisions of the NCLC in order to further allow student achievement and success.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ed.gov/essa?src=rn&lt;/ref&gt;

Standardized testing is a very common way of determining a student's past academic achievement and future potential.  However, [[High stakes tests|high-stakes tests]] (whether standardized or non-standardized) can cause anxiety.

"High Stakes Testing". Encyclopedia of Giftedness, Creativity, and Talent. SAGE Publications, 2009. 9 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional factor to consider in regards to standardized testing in the United States education system, is the socio-economic background of the students being tested. Research has shown that children from low-income and poor families do not receive the same emphasis on education from their parents as those students from higher income families. According to the Nation Center for Children in Poverty, 41 percent of children under the age of 18 fall into the category of lower income. (Kobal, H. and Jiang, Y., 2018) This is a large percent of the student population who start behind the learning curve and require specialized attention to get to where they need to be in order to perform well on the standardized test.&lt;ref&gt;Kobal, H. and Jiang, Y., (2018) Basic Facts about Low Income Children. Retrieved from http://www.nccp.org/publications/pub_1194.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
The Australian National Assessment Program – Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) standardized testing was commenced in 2008 by the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority, an independent authority "responsible for the development of a national curriculum, a national assessment program and a national data collection and reporting program that supports 21st century learning for all Australian students".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/|title=Home – The Australian Curriculum v8.1|website=www.australiancurriculum.edu.au|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The testing includes all students in Years 3, 5, 7 and 9 in Australian schools to be assessed using national tests. The subjects covered in these testings include Reading, Writing, Language Conventions (Spelling, Grammar and Punctuation) and Numeracy.

The program presents students level reports designed to enable parents to see their child's progress over the course of their schooling life, and help teachers to improve individual learning opportunities for their students. Students and school level data are also provided to the appropriate school system on the understanding that they can be used to target specific supports and resources to schools that need them most. Teachers and schools use this information, in conjunction with other information, to determine how well their students are performing and to identify any areas of need requiring assistance.

The concept of testing student achievement is not new, although the current Australian approach may be said to have its origins in current educational policy structures in both the USA and the UK. There are several key differences between the Australian NAPLAN and the UK and USA strategies. Schools that are found to be under-performing in the Australian context will be offered financial assistance under the current federal government policy.

==Design and scoring==
[[File:Cito Eindtoets Basisonderwijs.JPG|thumb|right|Some standardized testing uses multiple-choice tests, which are relatively inexpensive to score, but any form of assessment can be used.]]
Standardized testing can be composed of multiple-choice questions, true-false questions, essay questions, [[authentic assessment]]s, or nearly any other form of assessment.  Multiple-choice and true-false items are often chosen because they can be given and scored inexpensively, quickly, and reliably through using special answer sheets that can be read by a computer or via [[computer-adaptive test]]ing. Some standardized tests have short-answer or essay writing components that are assigned a score by independent evaluators who use [[Rubrics (education)|rubrics]] (rules or guidelines) and benchmark papers (examples of papers for each possible score) to determine the grade to be given to a response. Not all standardized tests involve answering questions; an authentic assessment for athletic skills could take the form of running for a set amount of time or [[dribbling]] a ball for a certain distance.

Most national and international assessments, however, are not fully evaluated by people; people are used to score items that are not able to be scored easily by computer (such as essays). For example, the [[Graduate Record Exam]] is a computer-adaptive assessment that requires no scoring by people except for the writing portion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ets.org/portal/site/ets/menuitem.1488512ecfd5b8849a77b13bc3921509/?vgnextoid=302433c7f00c5010VgnVCM10000022f95190RCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=7196e3b5f64f4010VgnVCM10000022f95190RCRD#Scoring_and_Reporting ETS webage] about scoring the GRE.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "normative assessment" refers to the process of comparing one test-taker to his or her peers. A [[norm-referenced test]] (NRT) is a type of test, [[Educational assessment|assessment]], or [[evaluation]] which yields an estimate of the position of the tested individual in a predefined population. The estimate is derived from the analysis of test scores and other relevant data from a [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] drawn from the population. This type of test identifies whether the test taker performed better or worse than other students taking this test. A [[criterion-referenced test]] (CRT) is a style of test which uses [[Test (student assessment)|test]] scores to show whether or not test takers performed well on a given task, not how well they performed compared to other test takers. Most tests and quizzes that are written by school teachers can be considered criterion-referenced tests. In this case, the objective is simply to see whether the student has learned the material.

===Scoring issues===
Human scoring is relatively expensive and often variable, which is why computer scoring is preferred when feasible. For example, some critics say that poorly paid employees will score tests badly.&lt;ref name=Houtz&gt;Houtz, Jolayne (August 27, 2000) [http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=4039520&amp;date=20000827&amp;query=wasl+pearson+pay+hour "Temps spend just minutes to score state test A WASL math problem may take 20 seconds; an essay, 2{{frac|1|2}} minutes"].  ''Seattle Times'' "In a matter of minutes, a $10-an-hour temp assigns a score to your child's test"&lt;/ref&gt; Agreement between scorers can vary between 60 and 85 percent, depending on the test and the scoring session. Sometimes states pay to have two or more scorers read each paper; if their scores do not agree, then the paper is passed to additional scorers.&lt;ref name=Houtz/&gt;

Open-ended components of tests are often only a small proportion of the test. Most commonly, a major academic test includes both human-scored and computer-scored sections.

Along with scoring the actual tests, teachers are being scored on how well their own students are performing on the tests. Teachers are faced with the incredible pressure to continuously bring scores up to be judged on whether or not they are worthy of keeping their job. There has been a lot of discussion covering how accurate of a way that to score a teachers' success because there are so many factors that go in to how well his or her students perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ub5he7kv4q.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fsummon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Relying+on+High-Stakes+Standardized+Tests+to+Evaluate+Schools+and+Teachers%3A+A+Bad+Idea&amp;rft.jtitle=Clearing+House%3A+A+Journal+of+Educational+Strategies%2C+Issues+and+Ideas&amp;rft.au=Morgan%2C+Hani&amp;rft.date=2016&amp;rft.pub=Routledge&amp;rft.issn=0009-8655&amp;rft.eissn=1939-912X&amp;rft.volume=89&amp;rft.issue=2&amp;rft.spage=67&amp;rft.externalDocID=EJ1104410&amp;paramdict=en-US|title=Relying on High-Stakes Standardized Tests to Evaluate Schools and Teachers: A Bad Idea.|last=Morgan|first=Hani|date=2016|website=EBSCOhost|access-date=May 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In scoring how well teachers do, how is there a way in which they could find a teacher to blame it on if they are in high school or even middle school, where there is not only one teacher, but a teacher for each subject?

Often, colleges are giving scholarships to students who score well on standardized tests like the ACT or the SAT. Students' intellectual level is judged by the score they receive, but the issue is that even if a student scores well on a standardized test that gets them to college, that does not imply that the student is smart. A student can do well on the test and fail out of college. It is not the best indicator of how well a student actually performs, but how well they test.

There is a lack of oversight. Teachers are told to watch over the students and be as organized as possible when collecting and grading the tests, but there are numerous sources stating all of these instances where students, even teachers are cheating. Students have been known to somehow accommodate the answers, or during breaks, teachers are not told to watch over the conversations held; they could easily discuss questions and figure out the answers together. Teachers, more of which are in "desperate situations" find that they are changing the answers for their students themselves to make it look like they are great teachers and it would take away from the pressure they feel in raising scores. "The accountability system is whats driving [standardized testing] and it's fundamentally flawed."

There are two types of standardized [[test score]] interpretations:  a [[norm-referenced test|norm-referenced]] score interpretation or a [[criterion-referenced test|criterion-referenced]] score interpretation.
* '''Norm-referenced score interpretations''' compare test-takers to a [[Sample (statistics)|sample of peers]].  The goal is to rank students as being better or worse than other students.  Norm-referenced test score interpretations are associated with [[traditional education]].  Students who perform better than others pass the test, and students who perform worse than others fail the test.
* '''Criterion-referenced score interpretations''' compare test-takers to a criterion (a formal definition of content), regardless of the scores of other examinees.  These may also be described as [[standards-based assessment]]s, as they are aligned with the [[standards-based education reform]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Where We Stand: Standards-Based Assessment and Accountability (American Federation of Teachers) [http://www.aft.org/pubs-reports/downloads/teachers/StandAssessRes.pdf/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824050606/http://www.aft.org/pubs-reports/downloads/teachers/StandAssessRes.pdf/|date=August 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Criterion-referenced score interpretations are concerned solely with whether or not this particular student's answer is correct and complete.  Under criterion-referenced systems, it is possible for all students to pass the test, or for all students to fail the test.

Either of these systems can be used in standardized testing.  What is important to standardized testing is whether all students are asked equivalent questions, under equivalent circumstances, and graded equally.  In a standardized test, if a given answer is correct for one student, it is correct for all students.  Graders do not accept an answer as good enough for one student but reject the same answer as inadequate for another student.

==Standards==
The considerations of [[Validity (logic)|validity]] and [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] typically are viewed as essential elements for determining the quality of any standardized test.  However, professional and practitioner associations frequently have placed these concerns within broader contexts when developing [[Standards organization|standards]] and making overall judgments about the quality of any standardized test as a whole within a given context.

===Evaluation standards===
In the field of [[evaluation]], and in particular [[educational evaluation]], the [[Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/|title=Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation|work=Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation|accessdate=2 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015044732/http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/|archivedate=15 October 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has published three sets of standards for evaluations.

Each publication presents and elaborates a set of standards for use in a variety of educational settings. The standards provide guidelines for designing, implementing, assessing and improving the identified form of evaluation. Each of the standards has been placed in one of four fundamental categories to promote educational evaluations that are proper, useful, feasible, and accurate.  In these sets of standards, validity and reliability considerations are covered under the accuracy topic. The tests are aimed at ensuring that student evaluations will provide sound, accurate, and credible information about student learning and performance, however; standardized tests offer narrow information on many forms of intelligence and relying on them harms students because they inaccurately measure a student's potential for success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ub5he7kv4q.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fsummon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Relying+on+High-Stakes+Standardized+Tests+to+Evaluate+Schools+and+Teachers%3A+A+Bad+Idea&amp;rft.jtitle=Clearing+House%3A+A+Journal+of+Educational+Strategies%2C+Issues+and+Ideas&amp;rft.au=Morgan%2C+Hani&amp;rft.date=2016&amp;rft.pub=Routledge&amp;rft.issn=0009-8655&amp;rft.eissn=1939-912X&amp;rft.volume=89&amp;rft.issue=2&amp;rft.spage=67&amp;rft.externalDocID=EJ1104410&amp;paramdict=en-US|title=Relying on High-Stakes Standardized Tests to Evaluate Schools and Teachers: A Bad Idea.|last=Morgan|first=Hani|date=March 2016|website=ub5he7kv4q.search.serialssolutions.com|access-date=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Testing standards===
In the field of [[psychometrics]], the ''[[Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/science/standards.html#overview|title=The Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing|work=http://www.apa.org|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; place standards about validity and reliability, along with [[Measurement#Difficulties|errors of measurement]] and issues related to the [[special education#Accommodations|accommodation]] of individuals with [[Disability|disabilities]].  The third and final major topic covers standards related to testing applications, [[Professional certification|credentialing]], plus testing in [[program evaluation]] and [[Standardized testing and public policy|public policy]].

== Importance of testing ==
Standardized testing is considered important and these tests do assess what is taught on the national level. They are used to measure objectives and how schools are meeting educational state standards.

There are three primary reasons for Standardized tests: Comparing among test takers, Improvement of ongoing instruction and learning, and Evaluation of instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=April 2016|title=Standardized Tests Purpose is the Point|url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/apr16/vol73/num07/Standardized-Tests@-Purpose-Is-the-Point.aspx|journal=Educational Leadership|volume=73|issue=7|page=47|last1=Popham|first1=W. James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering the information presented above, students undergoing the testing have been told to not spend copious amounts of their own time to study and prepare for the tests, although students believe they need to do well to ensure they don't let down their school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rand.org/blog/2015/11/standardized-tests-can-be-smarter.html|title=Standardized Tests Can Be Smarter {{!}} RAND|last=S.|first=Hamilton, Laura|last2=M.|first2=Stecher, Brian|website=www.rand.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standardized tests put large amounts of pressure on students. Some children who are considered at the top of their class choke when it comes to standardized tests such as the citywide.

=== Reflection of testing ===
Parents and community activists around the country explain that the education system is failing students. Standardized testing is included in efforts to improve the education system. Standardized testing gives a detailed account of student improvement and teacher effectiveness is evaluated, which can show how the school's effectiveness sits on a national scale.

==Public policy==
Standardized testing is used as a [[Public policy (law)|public policy]] strategy to establish stronger accountability measures for public [[education]].  While the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) has served as an educational barometer for some thirty years by administering standardized tests on a regular basis to random schools throughout the United States, efforts over the last decade at the state and federal levels have mandated annual standardized test administration for all public schools across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/|title=NAEP Nations Report Card - National Assessment of Educational Progress - NAEP|website=nces.ed.gov|language=EN|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea behind the standardized testing policy movement is that testing is the first step to improving schools, teaching practice, and educational methods through data collection.  Proponents argue that the data generated by the standardized tests act like a [[report card]] for the community, demonstrating how well local schools are performing.  Critics of the movement, however, point to various discrepancies that result from current state standardized testing practices, including problems with test validity and reliability and false correlations (see [[Simpson's paradox]]).

Critics also charge that standardized tests encourage "[[teaching to the test]]" at the expense of creativity and in-depth coverage of subjects not on the test. Multiple choice tests are criticized for failing to assess skills such as writing. Furthermore, student's success is being tracked to a teacher's relative performance, making teacher advancement contingent upon a teacher's success with a student's academic performance. Ethical and economical questions arise for teachers when faced with clearly underperforming or underskilled students and a standardized test.

Critics also object to the type of material that is typically tested by schools.  Although standardized tests for non-academic attributes such as the [[Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking]] exist, schools rarely give standardized tests to measure initiative, creativity, imagination, curiosity, good will, ethical reflection, or a host of other valuable dispositions and attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Case Against Standardized Testing: Rising the Scores, Ruining the Schools|last=Kohn|first=Alfie|publisher=Heinemann|year=2000|isbn=0325003254|location=361 Hanover Street Portsmouth, NH 03801-3912|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, the tests given by schools tend to focus less on moral or character development, and more on individual identifiable academic skills.

==Advantages==
* '''Offers guidance to teachers.''' Standardized tests will allow teachers to see how their students are performing compared to others in the country. This will help them revise their teaching methods if necessary to help their students meet the standards.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.oxfordlearning.com/pros-cons-of-standardized-tests/|title=Pros &amp; Cons of Standardized Tests {{!}} Oxford Learning|date=2014-10-29|work=Oxford Learning|access-date=2018-02-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Allows students to see own progress.''' Students will be given the opportunity to reflect on their scores and see where their strengths as well as weaknesses are.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* '''Provide parents information about their child.''' The scores can allow parents to get an idea about how their child is doing academically compared to everyone else of the same age in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://worklife.columbia.edu/files_worklife/public/Pros_and_Cons_of_Standardized_Testing_1.pdf|title=Pros and Cons of Standardized Testing|last=|first=|date=Spring 2013|website=Columbia University|access-date=February 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127224837/http://worklife.columbia.edu/files_worklife/public/Pros_and_Cons_of_Standardized_Testing_1.pdf|archive-date=2018-01-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Lets government know what areas need to be improved.''' Tests that are taken by everyone can help the government determine where students are struggling the most. With this information, they can implement solutions to fix the issue, allowing students to learn and grow in an academic environment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

One of the main advantages of standardized testing is that the results can be empirically documented; therefore, the test scores can be shown to have a relative degree of [[Validity (psychometric)|validity]] and [[Reliability (psychometric)|reliability]], as well as results which are generalizable and replicable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuncel | first1 = N. R. | last2 = Hezlett | first2 = S. A. | year = 2007 | title =  ASSESSMENT: Standardized Tests Predict Graduate Students' Success| url = | journal = Science | volume = 315 | issue = 5815| pages = 1080–81 | doi=10.1126/science.1136618 | pmid=17322046}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is often contrasted with grades on a school transcript, which are assigned by individual teachers.  It may be difficult to account for differences in educational culture across schools, difficulty of a given teacher's curriculum, differences in teaching style, and techniques and biases that affect grading.  This makes standardized tests useful for admissions purposes in higher education, where a school is trying to compare students from across the nation or across the world. Examples of such international benchmark tests include the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study ([[Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study|TIMMS]]) and the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study ([[Progress in International Reading Literacy Study|PIRLS]]). Performance on these exams have been speculated to change based on the way standards like the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) line up with top countries across the world.

There are three metrics by which the best performing countries in the TIMMS (the "A+ countries") are measured: focus, coherence, and rigor. Focus is defined as the number of topics covered in each grade; the idea is that the fewer topics covered in each grade, the more focus can be given to each topic. The definition of coherence is adhering to a sequence of topics covered that follows the natural progression or logical structure of mathematics. The CCSSM was compared to both the current state standards and the A+ country standards. With the most number of topics covered on average, the current state standards had the lowest focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidt | first1 = William H. | last2 = Houang | first2 = Richard T. | year = 2012 | title = Curricular Coherence and the Common Core Standards for Mathematics | url = http://edr.sagepub.com/content/41/8/294.abstract | journal = Educational Researcher | volume = 41 | issue = 8| pages = 294–308 | doi=10.3102/0013189x12464517}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Common Core Standards aim to fix this discrepancy by helping educators focus on what students need to learn instead of becoming distracted by extraneous topics. They encourage educational materials to go from covering a vast array of topics in a shallow manner to a few topics in much more depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Porter | first1 = A. | last2 = McMaken | first2 = J. | last3 = Hwang | first3 = J. | last4 = Yang | first4 = R. | year = 2011 | title = Common Core Standards: The New U.S. Intended Curriculum | doi = 10.3102/0013189x11405038 | journal = Educational Researcher | volume = 40 | issue = 7| pages = 103–116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standardized tests also remove teacher bias in assessment. Research shows that teachers create a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy in their assessment of students, granting those they anticipate will achieve with higher scores and giving those who they expect to fail lower grades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = Jussim | year = 1989 | title = Teacher expectations: Self-fulfilling prophecies, perceptual bias, and accuracy | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.57.3.469| journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 57 | issue = 3| pages = 469–480 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another advantage is aggregation. A well designed standardized test provides an assessment of an individual's mastery of a domain of knowledge or skill which at some level of aggregation will provide useful information. That is, while individual assessments may not be accurate enough for practical purposes, the mean scores of classes, schools, branches of a company, or other groups may well provide useful information because of the reduction of error accomplished by increasing the sample size.

Opponents claim that standardized tests are misused and uncritical judgments of intelligence and performance, but supporters argue that these aren't negatives of standardized tests, but criticisms of poorly designed testing regimes. They argue that testing should and does focus educational resources on the most important aspects of education&amp;nbsp;— imparting a pre-defined set of knowledge and skills&amp;nbsp;— and that other aspects are either less important, or should be added to the testing scheme.

==Disadvantages and criticism==
* '''Validity, efficacy, and predictive power.''' Many contend that overuse and misuse of these tests harms teaching and learning by narrowing the curriculum. According to the group [[FairTest]], when standardized tests are the primary factor in accountability, schools use the tests to narrowly define curriculum and focus instruction. Accountability creates an immense pressure to perform and this can lead to the misuse and misinterpretation of standardized tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holloway | first1 = J. H. | year = 2001 | title = The Use and Misuse of Standardized Tests | url = | journal = Educational Leadership | volume = 59 | issue = 1| page = 77 }}&lt;/ref&gt; FairTest says that negative consequences of test misuse include narrowing the curriculum, teaching to the test, pushing students out of school, driving teachers out of the profession, and undermining student engagement and school climate. Critics say that "[[teaching to the test]]" disfavors higher-order learning; it transforms what the teachers are allowed to be teaching and heavily limits the amount of other information students learn throughout the years.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=OVIC&amp;u=jcl_jccc&amp;id=GALE&amp;#124;EJ3010692244&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=summon|title=Standardized Testing Is Harming Student Learning|last=Williams|first=Mary|date=2015|website=go.galegroup.com|access-date=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is possible to use a standardized test without letting its contents determine curriculum and instruction, frequently, what is not tested is not taught, and how the subject is tested often becomes a model for how to teach the subject. 
** Uncritical use of standardized test scores to evaluate teacher and school performance is inappropriate, because the students' scores are influenced by three things: what students learn in school, what students learn outside of school, and the students' innate [[intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1999|title=Why Standardized Test Scores Don't Measure Educational Quality|url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/mar99/vol56/num06/Why-Standardized-Tests-Don't-Measure-Educational-Quality.aspx|journal=Educational Leadership|volume=56|issue=6|pages=8–15|last1=Popham|first1=W.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school only has control over one of these three factors. [[Value-added modeling]] has been proposed to cope with this criticism by statistically controlling for innate ability and out-of-school contextual factors.&lt;ref&gt;Hassel, B. &amp; Rosch, J. (2008) "Ohio Value-Added Primer." Fordham Foundation.  http://www.edexcellence.net/doc/Ohio_Value_Added_Primer_FINAL_small.pdf{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a value-added system of interpreting test scores, analysts estimate an expected score for each student, based on factors such as the student's own previous test scores, primary language, or socioeconomic status.  The difference between the student's expected score and actual score is presumed to be due primarily to the teacher's efforts.
**Some teachers would argue that Standardized Test only measures a student’s current knowledge and it does not reflect the students progress from the beginning of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pros and Cons of Standardized Testing|url=https://www.everettsd.org/cms/lib07/WA01920133/Centricity/Domain/2847/Pros%20and%20Cons%20of%20Standardized%20Testing.pdf| publisher=Columbia University|date=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A result created by individuals that are not a part of the student's regular instruction, but by professionals that determine what students should know at different ages. In addition, teachers agree that the best test creator and facilitator are themselves. They argue that they are the most aware of students abilities, capacities, and necessities which would allow them to take a longer on subjects or proceed on with the regular curriculum. 
* '''Notable Opponents'''. In her book,  ''Now You See It'', [[Cathy Davidson]] criticizes standardized tests. She describes our youth as "assembly line kids on an assembly line model," meaning the use of the standardized test as a part of a one-size-fits-all educational model. She also criticizes the narrowness of skills being tested and labeling children without these skills as failures or as students with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davidson|first=Cathy|title=Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn|year=2011|publisher=Viking|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widespread and organized cheating has been a growing culture in today's reformation of schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/11/25/15430647-cheating-scandal-feds-say-teachers-hired-stand-in-to-take-their-certification-tests?lite|title=Cheating scandal: Feds say teachers hired stand-in to take their certification tests|author=U.S. News|date=2 May 2015|work=NBC News|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Education theorist [[Bill Ayers]] has commented on the limitations of the standardized test, writing that "Standardized tests can't measure initiative, creativity, imagination, conceptual thinking, curiosity, effort, irony, judgment, commitment, nuance, good will, ethical reflection, or a host of other valuable dispositions and attributes. What they can measure and count are isolated skills, specific facts and function, content knowledge, the least interesting and least significant aspects of learning."&lt;ref&gt;To teach: the journey of a teacher, by William Ayers, Teachers College Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0-8077-3985-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8077-3985-3}}, pg. 116&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''[[The Shame of the Nation]],'' [[Jonathan Kozol]] argues that students submitted to standardized testing are victims of "cognitive decapitation."  Kozol comes to this realization after speaking to many children in inner city schools who have no spatial recollection of time, time periods, and historical events. This is especially the case in schools where due to shortages in funding and strict accountability policies, schools have done away with subjects like the arts, history and geography; in order to focus on the contest of the mandated tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Shame of the Nation: The Restoration of Apartheid Schooling in America|last = Kozol|first = Jonathan|publisher = Random House|year = 2005|isbn = 9781415924167|location = Print|pages = 118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Teachers are severely impacted on the success of their students' scores. In some cases, they have their entire career put on the line with how well their students' are testing. Up to half of a teacher's salary will be tied to how her students perform on the tests.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
** Schools that score poorly wind up being slated for closure or downsizing, which gives direct influence on the administration to result to dangerous tactics such as intimidation, cheating and drilling of information to raise scores.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
*'''Testing Minorities.''' Monty Neill, the director of the National Center for Fair and Open Testing, claims that students who speak English as a second language, who have a disability, or who come from low-income families are disproportionately denied a diploma due to a test score, which is unfair and harmful. In the late 1970s when the graduation test began in the United States, for example, a lawsuit delayed that many Black students had not had a fair opportunity on the material they were tested on the graduation test because they had attended schools segregated by law. “The interaction of under-resourced schools and testing most powerfully hits students of color”, as Neill argues, “They are disproportionately denied diplomas or grade promotion, and the schools they attend are the ones most likely to fare poorly on the tests and face sanctions such as restructuring.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neill|first1=Monty|title=Standardized Tests Are Unfair and Harmful|date=Fall 2009|publisher=Farmington Hills, MI : Greenhaven Press|location=Detroit|isbn=9780737747812|pages=28–35|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/EJ3010692217/OVIC?u=puya65247&amp;xid=782577cf|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**In the journal ''The Progressive,'' Barbara Miner explicates the drawbacks of standardized testing by analyzing three different books. As the co-director of the Center for Education at Rice University and a professor of education, Linda M. McNeil in her book ''Contradictions of School Reform: Educational Costs of Standardized Testing'' writes “Educational standardization harms teaching and learning and, over the long term, restratifies education by race and class.” McNeil believes that test-based education reform places higher standards for students of color. According to Miner, McNeil “shows how test-based reform centralizes power in the hands of the corporate and political elite-- a particularly frightening development during this time of increasing corporate and conservative influence over education reform.” Such test-based reform has dumbed down learning, especially for students of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miner|first1=Barbara|title=Standardized Minds: The High Price of America's Testing Culture and what we can do to Change it / Contradictions of School Reform: Educational Costs of Standardized Testing..|journal=The Progressive|date=August 2000|volume=64|pages=40–43|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/231959849?accountid=2280|accessdate=4 Dec 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''On a student and educator level.''' There is criticism from students themselves that tests, while standardized, are unfair to the individual student. Some students are "bad test takers", meaning they get nervous and unfocused on tests. Therefore, while the test is standard and should provide fair results, the test takers are at a disadvantage, but have no way to prove their knowledge otherwise, as there is no other testing alternative that allows students to prove their knowledge and problem-solving skills. 
** Some students suffer from [[test anxiety]]. Test anxiety applies to standardized tests as well, where students who may not have test anxiety regularly feel immense pressure to perform when the stakes are so high. High stakes standardized testing includes exams like the SAT, the PARCC, and the ACT, where doing well is required for grade passing or college admission.
** Standardized tests are a way to measure the education level of students and schools on a broad scale. From Kindergarten to 12th grade, students participate in required test taking.  In that amount of time, the average student takes 112 standardized tests, which equates to about 10 tests per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/study-says-standardized-testing-is-overwhelming-nations-public-schools/2015/10/24/8a22092c-79ae-11e5-a958-d889faf561dc_story.html|title=Study says standardized testing is overwhelming nation's public schools|last=Layton|first=Lyndsey|date=October 24, 2015|website=The Washington Post|publisher=|access-date=July 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this rate, the average amount of testing takes about 2.3% of total class time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/10/24/obama-schools-test/74536886/|title=Obama plan limits standardized testing to no more than 2% of class time|last=Doering|first=Christopher|date=October 25, 2015|website=USA Today|publisher=|access-date=July 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although standardized tests were designed to improve the education system, they are creating many negative effects on students and teachers.

With the relationship between teachers and students, the school system is advocating for the break down of communities and fostering competition. Educators are wanting to raise test scores by teaching to the test and only working on their own students. Avoiding work with fellow teachers allows for them to look better compared to the ones next to them if they do successfully raise scores, it gives room for them to shine, letting go of the idea of community. The competition gives way for an unhealthy environment that's placed in the school setting, and could be damaging to the students by limiting the information they are given, and maybe different ways to go about solving and interpreting certain questions/problems.

Standardized tests have caused the quality and depth of the educational curriculum to diminish (Rooks, Noliwe, and Noliwe Rooks). Instead of teachers developing a curriculum that addresses the needs of the actual students in their classrooms, they end up using the required material which they did not take any part in creating. The required material often contains pacing guidelines which regulate when substance should be taught and scripted lessons which often limits the teacher’s abilities to make relevant decisions in a classroom.
	The tests have narrowed the curriculum to a lot of schools, usually squeezing out classes such as art and music simply because they are excluded in the tests, then they are wiped out of the curriculum. Teachers are then forced to teach subjects that only influence the literacy level and comprehension ability of a student and leave out the ones that often require talent or skill.

Standardized testing places a lot of stress and pressure on children and teachers. Teachers are put under a lot of stress because the better students do on the test the more federal funding that school and district will receive. This causes teachers to teach to the test rather than teach to the life skills children will  use and need. In some cases, schools have shortened or removed recess so that more time can be spent preparing and practicing for the standardized tests. The pressure of this and the removal of a stress outlet, recess, means that children, along with teachers, are going to become depressed and sleep-deprived. Being depressed and sleep-deprived causes children to act out more than usual which places more stress on the teachers. Teachers do not get the results back until the end of the summer which means they will not be able to use those results to help those children because they will already be on to the next grade. Standardized tests place an unnecessary amount of stress on teachers and students without yielding any information in a timely manner.

* Standardized testing puts pressure not only on students, but on teachers as well. New Jersey Governor [[Chris Christie]] has proposed educational reform in New Jersey that pressures teachers not only to "teach to the test," but also have their students perform at the potential cost of their salary and job security. The reform calls for performance-based pay that depends on students' performances on standardized tests and their educational gains. However, students vary based on cognitive, developmental, and psychological abilities, so it is unfair to teachers with students with difficulties on the test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/06/christie_education_speech_in_iowa.html#incart_2box_politics_index.ssf|title=Christie Education Speech in Iowa|last=Arco|first=Matt|date=June 12, 2015|website=NJ.com|publisher=|access-date=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In an April 1995 "meta-analysis" published in the Journal of Educational and Psychological Measurement, Todd Morrison and Melanie Morrison examined two dozen validity studies of the test required to get into just about any Masters or PhD program in America: the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). This study encompassed more than 5,000 test-takers over the past 30 years. The authors found that GRE scores accounted for just 6 percent of the variation in grades in graduate school. The GRE appears to be "virtually useless from a prediction standpoint," wrote the authors. Repeated studies of the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) find the same. The SAT's maker, the Educational Testing Service (ETS), now claims the SAT is not an "aptitude" test but rather an assessment of "developed abilities."&lt;ref&gt;Todd Morrison and Melanie Morrison. "A Meta-Analytic Assessment of the Predictive Validity..." Journal of Educational and Psychological Measurement. 1995. Componentshttp://epm.sagepub.com/content/55/2/309.abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, standardized tests are not inexpensive.  It has been reported that the United States spends about 1.7 billion dollars annually on these tests.&lt;ref&gt;Kuczynski-Brown, Alex. "Standardized Testing Costs States $1.7 Billion A Year, Study Finds." The Huffington Post. TheHuffingtonPost.com, 29 November 2012. Web. 7 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, it was also reported that only three companies (Harcourt Educational Measurement, CTB McGraw-Hill and Riverside Publishing) design 96% of the tests taken at the state level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/schools/testing/companies.html|title = The Testing Industry's Big Four|date = 2001|accessdate = 2015-01-21|website = PBS Frontline|publisher = PBS|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational decisions==
Test scores are in some cases used as a sole, mandatory, or primary criterion for admissions or certification.  For example, some U.S. states require [[high school graduation examination]]s.  Adequate scores on these exit exams are required for high school graduation.  The [[General Educational Development]] test is often used as an alternative to a high school diploma.

Other applications include tracking (deciding whether a student should be enrolled in the "fast" or "slow" version of a course) and awarding scholarships.  In the United States, many colleges and universities automatically translate scores on [[Advanced Placement Program|Advanced Placement]] tests into college credit, satisfaction of graduation requirements, or placement in more advanced courses.  Generalized tests such as the [[SAT]] or [[GRE]] are more often used as one measure among several, when making admissions decisions.  Some public institutions have cutoff scores for the SAT, [[GPA]], or class rank, for creating classes of applicants to automatically accept or reject.

Heavy reliance on standardized tests for decision-making is often controversial, for the reasons noted above.  Critics often propose emphasizing cumulative or even non-numerical measures, such as classroom grades or brief individual assessments (written in prose) from teachers.  Supporters argue that test scores provide a clear-cut, objective standard that serves as a valuable check on [[grade inflation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The National Academy of Sciences recommends that major educational decisions not be based solely on a single test score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.nap.edu/html/highstakes/|title=Browse All Topics – The National Academies Press|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of minimum cut-scores for entrance or graduation does not imply a single standard, since test scores are nearly always combined with other minimal criteria such as number of credits, prerequisite courses, attendance, etc.  Test scores are often perceived as the "sole criteria" simply because they are the most difficult, or the fulfillment of other criteria is automatically assumed.  One exception to this rule is the [[GED]], which has allowed many people to have their skills recognized even though they did not meet traditional criteria.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The '''{{lang|es|Templo Mayor}}''' (Spanish for "[the] Greater Temple") was the main temple of the Mexica Peoples in their capital city of [[Tenochtitlan]], which is now [[Mexico City]]. Its architectural style belongs to the late [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic period of Mesoamerica]]. The temple was called the ''{{lang|nah|Huēyi Teōcalli}}'' {{IPA-nah|we:ˈi teoːˈkali|}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/4560-El-Templo-Mayor-%28Distrito-Federal%29 El Templo Mayor (Distrito Federal)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925190105/http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/4560-El-Templo-Mayor-(Distrito-Federal) |date=25 September 2009 }} (in Spanish).

The spire in the center of the adjacent image was devoted to [[Quetzalcoatl]] in his form as the wind god, [[Ehecatl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=http://www.mexicolore.co.uk/aztecs/gods/study-the-wind-god}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Temple devoted to Huitzilopochtli and Tlaloc, measuring approximately {{convert|100|by|80|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} at its base, dominated the Sacred Precinct.&lt;ref name="MexMax"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicomaxico.org/Tenoch/Tenoch2.htm |title= EL RECINTO CEREMONIAL Y EL TEMPLO MAYOR Evolución de la Gran Tenochtitlan |language=Spanish |accessdate=2008-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the first temple began sometime after 1325, and it was rebuilt six times.

==Discovery and excavation==
[[File:Coyolxauhqui 4095977415 b89d64f008-2.jpg|thumb|Disk depicting a dismembered [[Coyolxauhqui]] which was found during construction in 1978]]
After the destruction of Tenochtitlan, the Templo Mayor, like most of the rest of the city, was taken apart and covered over by the new Spanish colonial city. The Temple’s exact location was forgotten, although by the 20th-century scholars had a good idea where to look for it.&lt;ref name="MexDes"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Solis |first=Felipe |authorlink= |author2=Angel Gallegos |date=Aug 2000 |title=El Templo Mayor de Mexico-Tenochtitlan |journal=Mexico Desconocido |volume=45 |issue=91 |pages= |language=Spanish |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/4591-El-Templo-Mayor-de-Mexico-Tenochtitlan |accessdate=2008-11-09 |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021111221/http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/4591-El-Templo-Mayor-de-Mexico-Tenochtitlan |archivedate=21 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was based on the archeological work done at the end of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th. [[Leopoldo Batres]] did some excavation work at the end of the 19th century under the [[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral]] because at this time, the temple was thought to be there.&lt;ref name="viajero"/&gt; In the first decades of the 20th century, [[Manuel Gamio]] found part of the southwest corner of the temple and his finds were put on public display. However, it did not generate great public interest in excavating further because the zone was an upper-class residential area.&lt;ref name="EncMex20003"/&gt; In 1933, Emilio Cuevas found part of a staircase and beam. In 1948, Hugo Moedano and Elma Estrada Balmori excavated a platform containing serpent heads and offerings. In 1966, Eduardo Contreras and Jorge Angula excavated a chest containing offerings that was first explored by Gamio.&lt;ref name="viajero"/&gt;

The push to fully excavate the site did not come until late in the 20th century. On 21 February 1978, workers for [[Comisión Federal de Electricidad|the electric company]] were digging at a place in the city then popularly known as the "island of the dogs". It was so named because it was slightly elevated over the rest of the neighborhood, and when that was flooded, street dogs would congregate there. Just over two meters down, the diggers struck a pre-Hispanic monolith. This stone turned out to be a huge disk of over {{convert|3.25|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=off}} in diameter, {{convert|30|cm|in|1|sp=us|abbr=off}} thick and weighing {{convert|8.5|t|abbr=off|sp=us}}&lt;!-- Which ton? --&gt;. The relief on the stone was later determined to be [[Coyolxauhqui]], Huitzilopochtli's sister, dating to the end of the 15th century.&lt;ref name="EncMex20003"/&gt;

From 1978 to 1982, specialists directed by archeologist [[Eduardo Matos Moctezuma]] worked on the project to excavate the Temple.&lt;ref name="EncMex20003"/&gt; Initial excavations found that many of the artifacts were in good enough condition to study.&lt;ref name="lindstrom"&gt;{{cite book |title=Early Spanish American Narrative |last=Lindstrom |first=Naomi |authorlink= |year=2004 |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin TX USA |isbn=  |url=|page=23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts coalesced into the Templo Mayor Project, which was authorized by presidential decree.&lt;ref name="MTMproject"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archaeology.la.asu.edu/tm/pages2/mtm02.htm |title= Templo Mayor Project |editor= Lordes Cue |date= 1998-01-14 |accessdate= 2008-11-09 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081105103152/http://archaeology.la.asu.edu/tm/pages2/mtm02.htm |archivedate= 5 November 2008 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To excavate, 13 buildings in this area had to be demolished. Nine of these were built in the 1930s and four dated from the 19th century, and had preserved colonial elements. During excavations, more than 7,000 objects were found, mostly offerings including effigies, clay pots in the image of Tlaloc, skeletons of turtles, frogs, crocodiles, and fish, snail shells, coral, some gold, [[alabaster]], [[Mixtec]] figurines, ceramic [[urn]]s from [[Veracruz]], masks from what is now [[Guerrero]] state, copper rattles, decorated skulls and knives of [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]] and [[flint]]. These objects are housed in the Templo Mayor Museum.&lt;ref name="EncMex20003"/&gt; This museum is the result of the work done since the early 1980s to rescue, preserve and research the Templo Mayor, its Sacred Precinct and all objects associated with it. The museum exists to make all of the finds available to the public.&lt;ref name="MTMproject"/&gt;

[[File:GranPyramideDeTenochtitlan.JPG|thumb|The nested remains of successive phases of construction (1999)]]
The excavated site consists of two parts: the temple itself, exposed and labeled to show its various stages of development, along with some other associated buildings, and the museum, built to house the smaller and more fragile objects.&lt;ref name="MTMproject"/&gt;

Aztec temples were typically expanded by building over prior ones, using the bulk of the former as a base for the latter, as later rulers sought to expand the temple to reflect the growing greatness of the city of Tenochtitlan. Therefore, digging down through this temple takes us back in time. The first temple was begun by the Aztecs the year after they founded the city, and the temple was rebuilt six times. All seven stages of the Templo Mayor, except the first, have been excavated and assigned to the reigns of the emperors who were responsible for them.&lt;ref name="hassig"&gt;{{cite book |title=Time, History and Belief in Aztec and Colonial Mexico |last=Hassig |first=Ross |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin TX USA |isbn= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the first Templo Mayor began sometime after 1325. This first temple is only known through historical records, because the high water table of [[Lake Texcoco|the old lakebed]] prevents excavation.&lt;ref name="hassig"/&gt; According to these records, the first pyramid was built with earth and perishable wood, which may not have survived to the present time.&lt;ref name="EncMex20003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MexDes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MTMsala1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archaeology.la.asu.edu/tm/pages2/sala1.htm |title= Model of the ceremonial precinct of Mexico-Tenochtitlan |editor= Lourdes Cue |date= 1998-01-14 |accessdate= 2008-11-09 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081209092412/http://archaeology.la.asu.edu/tm/pages2/sala1.htm |archivedate= 9 December 2008 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second temple was built during the reigns of [[Acamapichtli]], [[Huitzilihuitl]] and [[Chimalpopoca]] between 1375 and 1427. The upper part of this temple has been excavated, exposing two stone shrines covered in stucco on the north side. A [[chacmool]] was uncovered as well. On the south side, there is a sacrificial stone called a "téchcatl" and a sculpted face.&lt;ref name="viajero"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EncMex20003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MexDes"/&gt;

The third temple was built between 1427 and 1440 during the reign of [[Itzcoatl]]. A staircase with eight stone standard-bearers is from this stage bearing the [[glyph]] with the year Four-Reed (1431) These standard bearers act as "divine warriors" guarding the access to the upper shrines.&lt;ref name="EncMex20003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MexDes"/&gt;

The fourth temple was constructed between 1440 and 1481 during the reigns of [[Moctezuma I]] and [[Axayacatl]]. This stage is considered to have the richest of the architectural decorations as well as sculptures. Most offerings from the excavations are from this time. The great platform was decorated with serpents and [[brazier]]s, some of which are in the form of monkeys and some in the form of Tlaloc. At this time, the stairway to the shrine of Tlaloc was defined by a pair of undulating serpents and in the middle of this shrine was a small altar defined by a pair of sculpted frogs. The circular monolith of Coyolxauhqui also dates from this time.&lt;ref name="EncMex20003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MexDes"/&gt;

The fifth temple (1481–1486) is dated during the short reign of [[Tizoc]]. During these five years, the platform was recovered in stucco and the ceremonial plaza was paved.&lt;ref name="EncMex20003"/&gt;

The sixth temple was built during the reign of [[Ahuizotl]]. He finished some of the updates made by Tizoc and made his own; as shown on the carvings of the "commemoration stone of the huei teocalli", showing the two tlatoqueh celebrating the opening of the temple during the last day of the month Panquetzaliztli dedicated to Huitzilopochtli; day 7 acatl of the year 8 acatl (Dec 19th, 1487). The Sacred Precinct was walled off and this wall was decorated with serpent heads. He built three shrines and the House of the Eagle Warriors.&lt;ref name="EncMex20003"/&gt;

==Final version==
[[File:Zocalo temple mayor metro.jpg|thumb|Model of Templo Mayor. [[Mexico City Metro]] [[Metro Zócalo|Zócalo]] station.]]
The seventh and last temple is what [[Hernán Cortés]] and his men saw when they arrived to Tenochtitlan in 1519. Very little of this layer remains because of the destruction the Spaniards wrought when they conquered the city. Only a platform to the north and a section of paving in the courtyard on the south side can still be seen.&lt;ref name="EncMex20003"/&gt;

Most of what is known about this temple is based on the historical record. It was at the time the largest and most important active ceremonial center. Fray [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] reported that the Sacred Precinct had 78 buildings; the Templo Mayor towered above all of them.&lt;ref name="MTMsala1"/&gt;

The pyramid was composed of four sloped terraces with a passage between each level, topped by a great platform that measured approximately {{convert|80|x|100|m|ft|0|sp=us|abbr=off}}. It had two stairways to access the two shrines on the top platform. One was dedicated to Tlaloc, the god of water on the left side (as you face the structure), and one to Huitzilopochtli, deity of war and of the sun, on the right side. The two temples were approximately {{convert|60|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=off}} in height, and each had large braziers where the sacred fires continuously burned. The entrance of each temple had statues of robust and seated men which supported the standard-bearers and banners of handmade bark paper. Each stairway was defined by [[balustrade]]s flanking the stairs terminating in menacing serpent heads at the base. These stairways were used only by the priests and sacrificial victims. The entire building was originally covered with stucco and polychrome paint.&lt;ref name="EncMex20003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MexDes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MTMtemplomayor"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archaeology.la.asu.edu/tm/pages2/mtm10.htm |title= Templo Mayor |date= 1998-01-14 |editor= Lourdes Cue |accessdate= 2008-11-09 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081010023636/http://archaeology.la.asu.edu/tm/pages2/mtm10.htm |archivedate= 10 October 2008 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deities were housed inside the temple, shielded from the outside by curtains. The idol of Huitzilopochtli was modeled from [[amaranth]] seeds held together with honey and human blood. Inside of him were bags containing jade, bones and [[amulet]]s to give life to the god. This figure was constructed annually and it was richly dressed and fitted with a mask of gold for his festival held during the Aztec month of Panquetzaliztli. At the end of the festival, the image was broken apart and shared among the populace to be eaten.&lt;ref name="MexDes"/&gt;

In his description of the city, Cortés records that he and the other Spaniards were impressed by the number and magnificence of the temples constructed in Tenochtitlan, but that was tempered by this disdain for their beliefs and human sacrifice.&lt;ref name="lindstrom"/&gt;

On 14 November 1519, Cortes seized the emperor [[Moctezuma II]] and ordered the destruction of all the religious relics of the Aztecs. He ordered a Catholic cross placed on the Templo Mayor.&lt;ref name="vazquez"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Mexican Rulers 1325-1997 |last=Vazquez-Gomez |first=Juana |authorlink= |year=1997 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |location=Westport CT USA |isbn=  |url=|page=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Cortes left for Veracruz to confront Spaniards looking to arrest him, [[Pedro de Alvarado]] learned of a plan to attack the Spaniards, and staged a pre-emptive attack on the Aztecs in the Sacred Precinct while they celebrated a religious festival. Unarmed and trapped within the walls of the Sacred Precinct, an estimated 8,000&amp;ndash;10,000 Aztec nobles were killed. When word of the massacre spread throughout the city, the people turned on the Spaniards, killing seven, wounding many, and driving the rest back to their quarters. The Spaniards were trapped between two Aztec forces and 68 were captured alive. Ten of these Spanish captives were immediately sacrificed at the Temple and their severed heads were thrown back to the Spaniards. The others were sacrificed at the Great Temple that night, which could be seen from the Spanish camps. The sacrificed Spaniards were flayed and their faces &amp;mdash; with beards attached &amp;mdash; were tanned and sent to allied towns, both to solicit assistance and to warn against betraying the alliance.&lt;ref name="black"&gt;{{cite book |title=War in the Early Modern World 1450-1815 |last=Black |first=Jeremy |authorlink= |year= 1998 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Inc |location=Florence KY USA |isbn=  |url=|page=222 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of Tenochtitlan in 1521, the lands controlled by the Aztecs became part of the Spanish empire. All the temples, including the Templo Mayor, were sacked, taking all objects of gold and other precious materials.&lt;ref name="viajero"/&gt; Cortés, who had ordered the destruction of the existing capital, had a Mediterranean-style city built on the site. Essential elements of the old imperial center, including the Templo Mayor, were buried under similarly key features of the new Spanish city in what is now the historical downtown of the Mexico City.&lt;ref name="lindstrom"/&gt; The Templo Mayor and Sacred Precinct were demolished and a Spanish church, later the main cathedral, was built on the western half of the precinct.&lt;ref name="viajero"/&gt;

==Orientation==
Fray Toribio de Motolinía, a Spanish friar who arrived to Mexico soon after the Conquest, writes in his work ''Memoriales'' that the Aztec feast of Tlacaxipehualiztli “took place when the sun stood in the middle of [the Temple of] Huitzilopochtli, which was at the equinox”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aveni |first1=Anthony F. |title=Skywatchers: A Revised and Updated Version of Skywatchers of Ancient Mexico |date=2001 |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin |pages=236ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement has become very famous, as it is the only textual reference known so far that explicitly relates a Mesoamerican temple with astronomical observations. The measurements in the Templo Mayor confirmed the veracity of this comment. The orientation of stage II, the earliest of the archaeologically attested construction phases, is different from that adopted by stage III and preserved in all subsequent stages. One of the sunset dates corresponding to the east-west axis of the late stages, including the last, is April 4, which in the Julian calendar of the 16th century was equivalent to March 25. In 1519, this was the last day of Tlacaxipehualiztli, that is, precisely the day of the feast of the month. Furthermore, March 25, the Feast of the Annunciation, was in the Middle Ages commonly identified with the vernal equinox. Consequently, Motolinía did not refer to the astronomical equinox (the date of which would have hardly been known to a non-astronomer at that time), but rather only pointed out the correlation between the day of the Mexica festival, which in the last years before the Conquest coincided with the solar phenomenon in the Templo Mayor, and the date in the Christian calendar that corresponded to the traditional day of spring equinox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |title=Astronomical alignments at the Templo Mayor of Tenochtitlan, Mexico |journal=Archaeoastronomy: Supplement to the Journal for the History of Astronomy |date=2000 |volume=31 |issue=25 |pages=S11-S40 |doi=10.1177/002182860003102502 |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/002182860003102502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==
[[File:Altar der Kröten.jpg|thumb|Altar of the [[toad]]s as symbols of [[water]]]]

According to tradition, the Templo Mayor is located on the exact spot where the god [[Huitzilopochtli]] gave the [[Mexica]] people his sign that they had reached the promised land: an eagle on a [[nopal]] cactus with a snake in its mouth.&lt;ref name="MexDes"/&gt;

The Templo Mayor was partially a symbolic representation of the Hill of Coatepec, where according to Mexica myth, Huitzilopochtli was born.&lt;ref name="MTMtemplomayor"/&gt; Huitzilopochtli emerged from his mother [[Coatlicue]] fully grown and fully armed to battle his sister [[Coyolxauhqui]] and her brothers the [[Centzon Huitznahua]] who intended to kill him and their mother. Huitzilopochtli was victorious, slaying and dismembering his sister. Her body was then thrown to the bottom of the hill. As the southern half of the Great Temple represented Coatepec (on the side dedicated to Huitzilopochtli), the great stone disk with Coyolxauhqui’s dismembered body was found at the foot of this side of the temple. The northern half represented Tonacatepetl, the mountain home of Tlaloc.&lt;ref name="hassig"/&gt;&lt;ref name="joyce"&gt;{{cite book |title=Gender and Power in Prehispanic Mesoamerica |last=Joyce |first=Rosemary A. |authorlink= |year=2000 |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin TX USA |isbn=  |url=|page=144 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mesoamerican ballgame#Aztec|sacred ballcourt]] and [[tzompantli|skull rack]] were located at the foot of the stairs of the twin temples, to mimic, like the stone disk, where Huitzilopochtli was said to have placed the goddess’ severed head. These locations served as a place for the reenactment of the mythical conflict.&lt;ref name="joyce"/&gt;

The various levels of the Temple also represent the cosmology of the Aztec world. First of all, it is aligned with the cardinal directions with gates that connect to roads leading in these directions.&lt;ref name="hassig"/&gt;&lt;ref name="joyce"/&gt; This indicates the place where the plane of the world that humans live in intersects the thirteen levels of the heavens, called Topan and the nine levels of the underworld, called [[Mictlan]].&lt;ref name="hassig"/&gt;

Archaeologist [[Eduardo Matos Moctezuma]], in his essay "Symbolism of the Templo Mayor," posits that the orientation of the temple is indicative of the total vision that the Mexica had of the universe ([[cosmovision]]). He states that the "principal center, or navel, where the horizontal and vertical planes intersect, that is, the point from which the heavenly or upper plane and the plane of the Underworld begin and the four directions of the universe originate, is the Templo Mayor of Tenochtitlan."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Aztec Templo Mayor|last=Matos Moctezuma|first=Eduardo|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection|year=1987|isbn=|editor-last=Hill Boone|editor-first=Elizabeth|location=|pages=188–189|chapter=Symbolism of the Templo Mayor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matos Moctezuma supports his supposition by claiming that the temple acts as an embodiment of a living myth where "all sacred power is concentrated and where all the levels intersect." Said myth is the birth and struggle between [[Huitzilopochtli]] and [[Coyolxauhqui]].

==Sacred Precinct and surrounding buildings==
[[File:TenochtitlanModel.JPG|thumb|Situation of the Templo Mayor (upper centre) in the central district of Tenochtitlan]]
The Sacred Precinct of the Templo Mayor was surrounded by a wall called the "coatepantli" (serpent wall). Among the most important buildings were the ballcourt, the Calmecac (area for priests), and the temples dedicated to [[Quetzalcoatl]], [[Tezcatlipoca]] and the sun.&lt;ref name="MTMsacredprecinct"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archaeology.la.asu.edu/tm/pages2/mtm08.htm |title= Sacred Precinct |date= 1998-01-14 |editor= Lourdes Cue |accessdate= 2008-11-09 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081010023626/http://archaeology.la.asu.edu/tm/pages2/mtm08.htm |archivedate= 10 October 2008 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Templo Mayor itself delineated the eastern side of the Sacred Precinct.&lt;ref name="viajero"/&gt;

[[File:CloseupEagleWarriorsTemploMayor.JPG|thumb|Close up of bas reliefs of eagle warriors in the Eagle building of the Templo Mayor complex. Some of the original paint can still be seen.]]
On the sides of the Templo Mayor, archeologists have excavated a number of palatial rooms and conjoining structures. One of the best preserved and most important is the Palace (or House) of the [[Eagle Warriors]]. This area dates back to the fourth stage of the temple, around 1469. It was excavated in 1981 and 1982 by José Francisco Hinojosa. It is a large L-shaped room with staircases decorated with sculptures of eagle heads. To enter this main room, one had to pass through an entrance guarded by two large sculpted representations of these warriors. The Eagle Warriors were a privileged class who were dedicated to the god Huitzilopochtli, and dressed to look like eagles. Adjoining this palace is the temple for these warriors—also known as the Red Temple. This temple shows clear [[Teotihuacan]] influence in its paintings (mostly in red) and the design of its altar. Almost all the interior walls of the House of the Eagles are decorated with beautiful paintings and contain long benches, which are also painted. These benches are composed of two panels. The upper one is a frieze with undulating serpents in bas-relief. The lower panel shows processions of armed warriors converging on a zacatapayolli, a grass ball into which the Mexica stuck bloody lancets during the ritual of [[Bloodletting in Mesoamerica|autosacrifice]]. This palace specifically imitates much of the style of the Burnt Palace, located in the ruins of [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]].&lt;ref name="MTMEagleHouse"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archaeology.la.asu.edu/tm/pages2/lacasa.html |title=The House of the Eagles |date=2000-11-30 |editor=Lourdes Cue |accessdate=2008-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010023531/http://archaeology.la.asu.edu/tm/pages2/lacasa.html |archivedate=10 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A number of important artifacts have been found in this area, the most important of which are two nearly identical large ceramic sculptures of [[Mictlantecuhtl]], the god of death. Despite being found in fragile pieces, they were both reconstructed and are on display at the on-site museum.&lt;ref name="MTMdiscovery"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archaeology.la.asu.edu/tm/pages2/elhallazgo.html |title= The Discovery of the Images |date= 2000-11-30 |editor= Lourdes Cue |accessdate= 2008-11-09 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081010023511/http://archaeology.la.asu.edu/tm/pages2/elhallazgo.html |archivedate= 10 October 2008 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MTMrestoration"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archaeology.la.asu.edu/tm/pages2/lostrabajos.html |title= The tasks of exploration and restoration of the sculptures |date= 2000-11-30 |editor= Lourdes Cue |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081012204700/http://archaeology.la.asu.edu/tm/pages2/lostrabajos.html |archivedate= 12 October 2008 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MTM images"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archaeology.la.asu.edu/tm/pages2/lamorfologia.html |title= The morphology and the orientation of the images |date= 2000-11-30 |editor= Lourdes Cue |accessdate= 2008-11-09 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081121203259/http://archaeology.la.asu.edu/tm/pages2/lamorfologia.html |archivedate= 21 November 2008 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another conjoining area was dedicated to the [[Ocelot]] Warriors. Their temple, dedicated to the god Tezcatlipoca, lies under the current [[Museo de la Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público]] to the south of the Templo Mayor.&lt;ref name="MexMax"/&gt;&lt;ref name="viajero"/&gt;

The Calmecac was a residence hall for priests and a school for future priests, administrators and politicians, where they studied theology, literature, history and astronomy. Its exact location is on one side of what is now Donceles Street. The Temple of Quetzalcoatl was located to the west of the Templo Mayor. It is said that during the equinox, the sun rose between the shrines dedicated to Huitzilopochtli and Tlaloc and shone directly on this temple. Due to the god’s serpentine nature, the temple had a circular base instead of a rectangular one.&lt;ref name="MexMax"/&gt;

The ball field, called the [[tlachtli]] or teutlachtli, was similar to many sacred ball fields in Mesoamerica. Games were played barefoot, and players used their hips to move a heavy ball to stone rings. The field was located west of the Templo Mayor, near the twin staircases and oriented east-west. Next to this ball field was the "huey tzompanti" where the skulls of sacrifice victims were kept after being covered in stucco and decorated.&lt;ref name="MexMax"/&gt;

The Temple of the Sun was located west of the Templo Mayor also and its remains lie under the Metropolitan Cathedral. The project to shore up the cathedral at the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st brought to light a number of artifacts.&lt;ref name="MexMax"/&gt;

==Offerings==
[[File:OfferingBoxTemploMayor.JPG|thumb|Stone offering box and contents found at the Templo Mayor.]]
Most of the objects found in the Templo Mayor were offerings. Although many are of Mexica design, there are also abundant items from other peoples, brought in as [[tribute]] or through trade. Sculptures, flint knives, vessels, beads and other sumptuary ornaments—as well as minerals, plants and animals of all types, and the [[Human trophy taking in Mesoamerica|remains of human sacrifice]]—were among the items deposited in offerings. All of these fulfilled a specific function within the offering, depending on the symbolism of each object. In excavations at the Templo Mayor, different types of offerings have been found and have been grouped by researchers in terms of Time (the period in which the offering was deposited); Space (the location of the offering within the structure); Container (type and dimensions of the receptacle containing the objects); internal distribution (placement of objects within the offering) and value of the items. The offerings were usually contained in cavities, in stone urns, and in boxes made of slabs. These are found under floors; in platforms, architectural bodies, stairways and in temples. These offerings were placed accompanied by complex rituals following set temporal, spatial and symbolic patterns, depending on the intention of the offering.&lt;ref name="MTMofferings"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archaeology.la.asu.edu/tm/pages2/sala2.htm |title= Ritual and Sacrifice |date= 1998-01-11 |editor= Lourdes Cue |accessdate= 2008-11-09 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081209005122/http://archaeology.la.asu.edu/tm/pages2/sala2.htm |archivedate= 9 December 2008 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest Mexica objects, located in the second temple, are two urns which contain the remains of incinerated bones; one of the urns was made of obsidian and the other of alabaster. A small silver mask and a gold bell were found inside one urn, and second gold bell and two green stone beads were placed in the other.&lt;ref name="MTMofferings"/&gt;

Images of the gods [[Huehueteotl]]-[[Xiuhtecuhtli]], together with Tlaloc, presided over most of the offerings found in the Templo Mayor. Representing fire and water respectively, this pair of deities probably symbolized the concept of "burning water," a metaphor for warfare.&lt;ref name="MTMofferings"/&gt;

Another theme exhibited in this hall is autosacrifice, a ritual that was conducted in private as a personal act of communication with the gods. Widespread throughout the entire population, this practice was performed by perforating certain fleshy parts of the body—such as the [[earlobe]]s, lips, tongue, chest, calves, et cetera—with obsidian blades, [[agave]] needles or bone perforators. Once the implement was covered with blood, it was inserted in straw balls called Zacatapayoli. The entirety was probably placed in ceremonial boxes—tepetlacalli—as an offering to the gods. Objects associated with human sacrifice are the "face blades" or knives decorated with eyes and teeth, as well as skull masks. Other ceremonial items include musical instruments, jewelry, and braziers for the burning of [[copal]].&lt;ref name="MTMofferings"/&gt;

==Museum==

The museum of the Templo Mayor was built in 1987 to house the Templo Mayor Project and its finds—a project which continues work to this day. In 1991, the Urban Archeology Program was incorporated as part of the Templo Mayor Project whose mission is to excavate the oldest area of the city, around the main plaza.&lt;ref name="viajero"/&gt; The museum building was built by architect [[Pedro Ramírez Vázquez]], who envisioned a discreet structure that would blend in with the colonial surroundings. The museum has four floors, three of which are for permanent exhibitions and the fourth houses offices for the director, museum administration and research staff. Other departments are located in the basement, where there is also an auditorium.&lt;ref name="MTMmuseum"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archaeology.la.asu.edu/tm/pages2/mtm01.htm |title= Templo Mayor Museum |date= 1998-01-14 |editor= Lourdes Cue |accessdate= 2008-11-09 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080928013802/http://archaeology.la.asu.edu/tm/pages2/mtm01.htm |archivedate= 28 September 2008 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum has eight main exhibition halls, called "salas", each dedicated to a different theme. Room 1 is dedicated to the goddesses Coatlicue and Coyalxauhqui, mother and sister to Huitzlipochtli, respectively. Here are displayed the first finds associated with the temple, from the first tentative finds in the 19th century to the discovery of the huge stone disk of Coyolxauhqui, which initiated the Templo Mayor Project.

Room 2 is dedicated to the concepts of ritual and sacrifice in Tenochtitlan. This room contains urns where dignitaries where interred, funerary offerings, as well as objects associated with self and human sacrifice—such as musical instruments, knives and skulls.

Room 3 demonstrates the economics of the Aztec empire in the form of tribute and trade, with examples of finished products and raw materials from many parts of Mesoamerica. Sala 4 is dedicated to the god Huitzilopochtli. His shrine at the temple was the most important and largest. This room contains various images of him as well as offerings. Also located here are the two large ceramic statues of the god Mictlantecuhtli which were found in the House of the Eagle Warriors who were dedicated to Huitzilopochtli.

Room 5 is dedicated to Tlaloc, the other principal deity of the Aztecs and one of the oldest in Mesoamerica. This room contains various images of the god usually worked in green or volcanic stone or in ceramic. The most prized work is a large pot with the god’s face in high relief that still preserves much of the original blue paint.
Room 6 is dedicated to the flora and fauna of Mesoamerica at this time, as most contained divine aspects for the Aztecs. Also many of the offerings found at the Templo Mayor were or were made from various plants and animals. Related to Room 6, Room 7 contains exhibits of the agricultural technology of the time, especially in the growing of corn and the construction of ''chinampas'', the so-called "floating gardens". The last room is Room 8, which is dedicated to the archeology and history of the site.&lt;ref name="viajero"/&gt;

== Reception ==
The ''[[New York Times]]'' says, "20th Century Fox Home Entertainment has been turning out some first-rate discs lately, but something has gone horribly wrong with “The Alice Faye Collection,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/20/movies/20dvd.html|title=New DVDs: The Cuban Masterworks Collection|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[San Diego Reader]]'' wrote that "The Alice Faye Collection has four of the great Fox musical star's best films: On the Avenue, Lillian Russell, That Night in Rio, and The Gang's All Here. My favorites are the last two because they are brightened by the Brazilian bombshell Carmen Miranda. Miss Faye exuded the charm and innocence our boys were fighting for in [[World War II]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2007/nov/01/funny-face-meet-me-st-louis-alice-faye-collection/#|title=Funny Face, Meet Me in St. Louis, The Alice Faye Collection|publisher=[[San Diego Reader]]|accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''trivium''' is the lower division of the [[seven liberal arts]] and comprises [[grammar]], [[dialectic]], and [[rhetoric]].&lt;ref name="english-ety"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology |editor1=Onions, C.T. |year=1991 |page=944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trivium is implicit in ''De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii'' ("On the Marriage of Philology and Mercury") by [[Martianus Capella]], but the term was not used until the [[Carolingian Renaissance]], when it was coined in imitation of the earlier [[quadrivium]].&lt;ref&gt;Marrou, Henri-Irénée (1969). "Les arts libéraux dans l'Antiquité classique". pp. 6–27 in ''Arts libéraux et philosophie au Moyen Âge''. Paris: Vrin; Montréal: Institut d'études médiévales). pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Grammar, logic, and rhetoric were essential to a classical education, as explained in [[Plato]]'s dialogues. The three subjects together were denoted by the word ''trivium'' during the [[Middle Ages]], but the tradition of first learning those three subjects was established in [[Education in ancient Greece|ancient Greece]]. Contemporary iterations have taken various forms, including those found in certain British and American universities (some being part of the [[Classical education movement]]) and at the independent [[Oundle School]] in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.martinrobinson.net/writing.html. Each of these iterations was discussed in a conference at King's College London on the future of the liberal arts at schools and universities; see http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/liberal/conference.aspx and http://www.boarding.org.uk/media/news/article/2352/Oundle-School-Improving-Intellectual-Challenge&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Etymologically, the Latin word '''trivium''' means "the place where three roads meet" (tri + via); hence, the subjects of the trivium are the foundation for the [[quadrivium]], the upper division of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] education in the [[liberal arts]], which comprised [[arithmetic]] (number), [[geometry]] (number in space), [[music]] (number in time), and [[astronomy]] (number in space and time). Educationally, the trivium and the quadrivium imparted to the student the seven liberal arts of [[classical antiquity]].&lt;ref name="english-ety" /&gt;

== Description ==

'''[[Grammar]]''' teaches the mechanics of language to the student. This is the step where the student "comes to terms," defining the objects and information perceived by the five senses. Hence, the [[Law of Identity]]: ''a tree is a tree, and not a cat''.

'''[[Logic]]''' (also [[dialectic]]) is the "mechanics" of [[thought]] and of [[analysis]], the process of identifying [[Fallacy|fallacious arguments]] and statements and so systematically removing contradictions, thereby producing factual knowledge that can be trusted.

'''[[Rhetoric]]''' is the application of language in order to instruct and to persuade the listener and the reader. It is the knowledge (grammar) now understood (logic) and being transmitted outwards as wisdom (rhetoric).

[[Sister Miriam Joseph]], in ''The Trivium: The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric'' (2002), described the trivium as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Grammar is the art of inventing symbols and combining them to express thought; logic is the art of thinking; and rhetoric is the art of communicating thought from one mind to another, the adaptation of language to circumstance.

'''. . .'''

Grammar is concerned with the thing as-it-is-symbolized. Logic is concerned with the thing as-it-is-known. Rhetoric is concerned with the thing as-it-is-communicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Joseph |first=Sister Miriam |title=The Trivium: The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric |publisher=Paul Dry Books |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lg0a-RJcn4gC&amp;pg=PA3 |pages=3, 9 |chapter=1, The Liberal Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

John Ayto wrote in the ''Dictionary of Word Origins'' (1990) that study of the trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) was requisite preparation for study of the quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy). For the medieval student, the trivium was the curricular beginning of the acquisition of the seven [[liberal arts]]; as such, it was the principal undergraduate course of study. The word ''[[wikt:trivial|trivial]]'' arose from the contrast between the simpler trivium and the more difficult quadrivium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ayto |first=John |title=Dictionary of Word Origins |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=1990 |page=542 |isbn=1-55970-214-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''twelve sacred hills of Imerina''' are hills of historical significance to the [[Merina people]] of Madagascar.  Located throughout [[Imerina]], the central area of the highlands of Madagascar, the sites were often ancient capitals, the birthplaces of key public figures, or the tomb sites of esteemed political or spiritual leaders.  The first set of sacred sites was designated by early 17th-century king [[Andrianjaka]].  The notion was re-sanctified under late 18th-century king [[Andrianampoinimerina]], who replaced several of the earlier sites with new ones.  More than 12 sites were thus designated as sacred over time, although the notion of twelve sacred hills was perpetuated because of the significance of the number 12 in Malagasy cosmology. Today, little concrete evidence of the former importance of many of these sites remains, but the significant archeological and cultural heritage of several of the sites has been preserved. The historic significance of the sites is best represented by the [[Rova of Antananarivo]] at Analamanga, the ancient [[Architecture of Madagascar#Earth-based construction|fortified city]] at Alasora, the [[Architecture of Madagascar#Merina aristocratic tradition|houses]] and [[Architecture of Madagascar#Highlands traditions|tombs]] of the [[andriana]] (noble class) at Antsahadinta and the [[Architecture of Madagascar#Earth-based construction|ancient fortifications]] and [[Architecture of Madagascar#Merina aristocratic tradition|palaces]] at [[Ambohimanga]], protected as a [[UNESCO]] [[List of World Heritage Sites in Madagascar|World Heritage Site]] since 2001.

==History==
According to popular legend, King [[Andrianjaka]] (1610–1630) declared twelve hills in [[Imerina]] (the central region of the Highlands of Madagascar) to be sacred due to their historical, political or spiritual significance to the [[Merina people]]. King [[Andrianampoinimerina]] (1787–1810) designated twelve hills in his turn, including several of those first identified by Andrianjaka.  Most of these hills served as locations of the capitals of rival kingdoms conquered by Andrianampoinimerina and united under his rule, and many are also the seat of power of historic kings and queens of the [[Merina Kingdom|Merina dynasty]].

==Key sites==
Twelve is a sacred number in [[Merina]] cosmology and it is commonly said that Andrianampoinimerina had twelve wives and installed one on each of the twelve sacred hills throughout [[Kingdom of Madagascar|his kingdom]].&lt;ref name="Notes"&gt;Administration coloniale.

Ruling from Imerimanjaka, [[vazimba]] Queen [[Rangita]] (1500–1520) and her brother Andrianamponga gave the site its current name.  Under Rangita's daughter, Queen [[Rafohy]] (1520–1540), the capital of the region was moved from Imerimanjaka to Alasora.  Some of the [[architecture of Madagascar#Earth-based construction|monumental features]] of the site were added upon the orders of her son, King [[Andriamanelo]] (1540–1575), including the ''hadivory'' and ''hadifetsy'' (defensive trenches around the town), as well as the ''vavahady'', a town gate protected by a large rolled stone disc acting as a barrier and shaded by ''aviavy'' (fig trees), symbolic of royalty. This town model was subsequently adopted throughout Imerina. Andriamanelo's tomb is located here.&lt;ref&gt;[http://madatana.com/colline-alasora.php Alasora.] Madatana.com Accessed November 5, 2010. {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Valley of the Wolves''''' ({{lang-tr|Kurtlar Vadisi}}) is a [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[media franchise]] created by [[Osman Sınav]], which has been very popular obtaining high ratings for the television series and one of the highest [[box office]] returns in the history of the [[Turkish cinema]] for the first film.

==Production history==
'''''Valley of the Wolves''''' ({{lang-tr|Kurtlar Vadisi}}) is the original series created by Osman Sınav, which followed a Turkish agent working under the assumed identity of Polat Alemdar ([[Necati Şaşmaz]]) attempting to infiltrate the Turkish mafia. It ran for 97 episodes from 2003 to 2005.

{{main|Valley of the Wolves: Iraq}}

'''''Valley of the Wolves: Iraq''''' ({{lang-tr|Kurtlar Vadisi: Irak}}) is a controversial 2006 spin-off film directed by [[Serdar Akar]], which follows Polat Alemdar (Necati Şaşmaz) and his team as they go to [[Governorates of Iraq|northern Iraq]] during the [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)|Occupation of Iraq]] to avenge the death of a Turkish soilder. Its perceived [[anti-Americanism]] and [[anti-semitism]] generated interest among American and European media and other organizations, such as the Anti-Defamation League. It went on general release across Turkey on {{start date|2006|02|03}} and was one of the highest grossing Turkish film of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/PresRele/IslME_62/5689_62.htm Anti-Defamation League: ADL Continues to Voice Concern About Anti-Jewish and Anti-Israel Climate in Turkey]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Valley of the Wolves: Terror''===

'''''Valley of the Wolves: Terror''''' ({{lang-tr|Kurtlar Vadisi: Terör}}) is a short-lived spin-off television series, which followed Polat Alemdar in his attempts to infiltrate Kurdish separatist militant networks in Turkey. The first episode of the program aired on the night of February 8, 2007 and earned considerable ratings, but the political reflection of the painful issues of Turkey and the violence shown in the first episode triggered a harsh response from [[RTÜK]] (Radio and Television Supreme Council). As a result, the series was cancelled after its first episode, creating a controversy about [[censorship in Turkey]].

=== ''Valley of the Wolves: Ambush'' ===

'''''Valley of the Wolves: Ambush''''' ({{lang-tr|Kurtlar Vadisi: Pusu}}) is the current spin-off television series, which was launched by Pana Film some time after the cancellation of the previous series, and has been running on [[Show TV]] since April 20, 2007. It has not faced any responses from RTÜK yet and it attracts high ratings.

The new series deals with the relations between the state, mafia, business circles, and the [[Deep state in Turkey|deep state]] phenomenon in Turkey. According to the plot, Polat Alemdar decides to wage a vigilante struggle against four powerful Turkish families that control the national economy, helping Ahu Toros, a young businesswoman who lost her father in a conspiracy by the said families. Polat Alemdar's biggest rival is "Alexander the Great" (Iskender Buyuk), who trails him at all times. Polat marries Ebru Duru and lives happily, but things take a turn for the worse in the ensuing episodes. The two other protagonists are Memati and Abdulhey. Memati is a former specialized Mafia (working for Suleyman Cakir at the time) but now Memati is converted into a good person with a brave heart and a patriot like Polat, he always follows Polat's orders. Abdullhey is like Polat, an agent working for Turkey intelligence and serving his country like a real patriot.
The main antagonist arrives after the third season and is named Aron Feller, an ex agent of CIA and working in Turkey (or controlling Turkey in some ways). Iskender Büyük is considered like an anti-hero, instead of Aron Feller being the main antagonist. After a long fight-relation against Iskender Büyük, Polat finally manages to kill his main enemy Iskender Büyüük, but he loses his wife Ebru and his little daughter is taken by Aron Feller to be raised as a Christian in the USA. After the death of Iskender Büyük, Polat and his team are facing a new wage of enemies, they try to fight against Kurdish terrorism, by the same time a new character appears, his name is Ersoy Ulubey, Ersoy wants to take the deep state of Turkey by the "force". His methods are : terrorism and many relations with big familie leaders like Hasim aga, Izzet aga, Yasar aga etc. He creates a secret fraternity to take upon Turkey, but Polat and his team must now take him down. By the same time, Polat keeps his relations with the "Ihtiyarlar", they give him new missions and Polat is chosen as the "protector" of Turkey. After many episodes Polat kills Ersoy and the main antagonist Aron Feller, by this way almost destroying "Gladio". Through upcoming episodes Suleyman Cakir's family returns after 10 years and new character "Kara" is being introduced, he was the "old" Polat Alemdar before Polat Alemdar, he too worked for the "Ihtiyarlar" and will bring big help to the team of Canpolat! As the series goes on, many new characters are making appearance such as : Beyefendi, Mete bey, Memduh Baba, Seref Zazaoglu, Mete Aymar etc. In the episode 161 Memati is killed by a mysterious group, the "white elder" of the Ihtiyarlar is killed too by the same mysterious group. Polat and his friends are in shock after Memati's death, they are lost and they cannot take his revenge. The Ihtiyarlar must now choose a new "white elder", so Adil Esrefoglu is chosen, Adil bey is the brother of Dogu Esrefoglu, Adil, Dogu and Aslan Akbey were the ones who created the secret mission : Kurtlar Vadisi. After this Polat will have to deal with Adil bey. Adil bey tells him everything about his past and he also tells him, that he used to be like Polat in his youth services. He says that he formed with his brother Dogu bey the created KGT (Turkey's intelligence agency), he also tells Polat that he was the one who "formed" Aslan Akbey. A new youth team comes in Turkey to help Polat to finish his mission : Kurtlar Vadisi. Memati's death shocked too much everyone. After that, Polat said to one of his helpers to kill himself because he had some secrets and he meant that if he killed himself, it would be the best for the state.

==Cultural impact==

"''Kurtlar Vadisi'' became an instant hit with its references to Turkish politics, its unabashed abuse of social sensitivities on patriotism, and with unprecedented scenes of violence that included assassination and torture on television", [[Hürriyet Daily News]] reviewer Emrah Güler. "Not unlike [[John Woo]]’s ''[[Face/Off]]'' an undercover Turkish agent goes through a set of plastic surgeries to infiltrate the mafia, along with a gunman who walks surefooted in this muddy underworld", Güler continues, "the two go through ordeals of every kind for Polat to become the next baron so that he can break them apart." "The hype eventually got so big that the final episodes featured [[Andy Garcia]] as the big American mafia boss and [[Sharon Stone]] as his wife, eventually lending a kiss to our hero."&lt;ref name="VWG04" /&gt;

Lead character Polat Alemdar (Necati Şaşmaz) "established in the image of a mafia-macho Turkish guy", according to Hürriyet Daily News reviewer Emrah Güler, and was "admired by the unemployed and frustrated young men all over Turkey". Güler describes him as “the Turkish equivalent of ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]''’s [[Jack Bauer]], entangled in the deep state, disguised as a mafia boss”. "Short and ordinary looking," according to Güler, "Polat has a self-defined sense of justice that included hanging traitors in the city center of Istanbul." "The series had reached such a cult status that many young men officially changed their names to Polat Alemdar", Güler concludes.&lt;ref name="VWG04" /&gt;

The show has been dubbed into [[Syria|Syrian]] [[Arabic]] dialect and proved one of the most popular Turkish drama to be dubbed into Arabic.

==Controversies==
An episode of ''Valley of the Wolves: Ambush'' that depicted Israeli [[Mossad]] agents spying inside Turkey and kidnapping Turkish babies was roundly criticized by the Israeli government and media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/01/12/turkey.israel/index.html CNN.com: Israel criticizes Turkey over television series]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Turkish government's refusal to act on Israeli requests to more strictly censor the show had contributed to a deepening of a row between the two countries, culminating in Turkey's threat to recall ambassador to Israel Ahmet Oguz Celikkol after a controversial diplomatic meeting with Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon in January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8453694.stm BBC News: Israel rebukes Turkey over a television series]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Victorian burlesque''', sometimes known as '''travesty''' or '''extravaganza''',&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'',  "the various genre terms were always applied freely", and by the 1860s their use had become "arbitrary and capricious": see [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque,"] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}.  In an 1896 article on Burlesque in ''The Theatre'', the three terms are used interchangeably: see Adams, W. Davenport. "Burlesque: Old ''v.'' New", ''The Theatre'', 1 March 1896, pp. 144–45&lt;/ref&gt; is a genre of theatrical entertainment that was popular in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] England and in the New York theatre of the mid 19th century. It is a form of [[parody music|parody]] in which a well-known opera or piece of classical theatre or ballet is adapted into a broad comic play, usually a musical play, usually risqué in style, mocking the theatrical and musical conventions and styles of the original work, and often quoting or [[pastiche|pastiching]] text or music from the original work. Victorian burlesque is one of several forms of [[burlesque]].

Like [[ballad opera]], burlesques featured musical scores drawing on a wide range of music, from popular contemporary songs to operatic arias, although later burlesques, from the 1880s, sometimes featured original scores.  Dance played an important part, and great attention was paid to the staging, costumes and other spectacular elements of stagecraft, as many of the pieces were staged as [[extravaganza]]s.  Many of the male roles were played by actresses as [[breeches role]]s, purposely to show off their physical charms, and some of the older female roles were taken by male actors.

Originally short, one-act pieces, burlesques were later full-length shows, occupying most or all of an evening's programme. Authors who wrote burlesques included [[J. R. Planché]], [[H. J. Byron]], [[G. R. Sims]], [[F. C. Burnand]], [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Fred Leslie]].

==History==
Burlesque theatre became popular around the beginning of the [[Victorian era]]. The word "burlesque" is derived from the Italian ''burla'', which means "ridicule or mockery".&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', which defines the word as "That species of literary composition, or of dramatic representation, which aims at exciting laughter by caricature of the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects; a literary or dramatic work of this kind."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baldick&gt;Baldick, Chris. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t56.e153 "Burlesque",] ''The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms'', Oxford University Press, 2008. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', Victorian burlesque was "related to and in part derived from [[pantomime]] and may be considered an extension of the introductory section of pantomime with the addition of gags and 'turns'."&lt;ref name=grove&gt;[[Erich Schwandt|Schwandt, Erich]] et al. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque",] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another antecedent was [[ballad opera]], in which new words were fitted to existing tunes.&lt;ref&gt;Moss,  Harold Gene. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/830406 "Popular Music and the Ballad Opera",] ''Journal of the American Musicological Society'', Vol. 26, No. 3 (Autumn, 1973), pp. 365–82, University of California Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:1831 Royal Olympic.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Olympic Theatre]], for which Planché wrote ''Olympic Revels'']]
[[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris|Madame Vestris]] produced burlesques at the [[Olympic Theatre]] beginning in 1831 with ''Olympic Revels'' by [[J. R. Planché]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, W. Davenport. ''A Book of Burlesque'' (London: Henry and Co., 1891), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;  In these pieces, comedy stemmed from the incongruity and absurdity of the grand classical subjects, with realistic historical dress and settings, being juxtaposed with the everyday modern activities portrayed by the actors. For example, ''Olympic Revels'' opens with the gods of Olympus in classical Greek dress playing [[whist]].&lt;ref&gt;Reinhardt, p. 541&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early burlesques, the words of the songs were written to popular music, as had been done earlier in ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]''.  Later in the Victorian era, burlesque mixed [[operetta]], [[music hall]] and [[revue]], and some of the large-scale burlesque spectacles were known as [[extravaganza]]s.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[H. J. Byron]]'s 1863 ''Il trovatore'' parody, which was labelled "a burlesque extravaganza": see Marvin, Roberta Montemorra. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3878318 "Verdian Opera Burlesqued: A Glimpse into Mid-Victorian Theatrical Culture",] ''Cambridge Opera Journal'', Vol. 15, No. 1 (March 2003), p. 42, Cambridge University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The English style of burlesque was successfully launched in New York in the 1840s by the manager and comedian William Mitchell, who had opened his Olympic Theatre in December 1839. Like the London prototypes, his burlesques included characters with nonsensical names such as Wunsuponatyme and The King of Neverminditsnamia, and made fun of all kinds of music currently being presented in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Delmer D. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/779924 "Public Music Performances in New York City from 1800 to 1850",] ''Anuario Interamericano de Investigacion Musical'', Vol. 6 (1970), pp. 5–50, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike pantomime, which aimed at all ages and classes, burlesque was aimed at a narrower, highly literate audience;&lt;ref name=tls/&gt; some writers, such as the Brough brothers,&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Barnabas Brough]] and his brother [[William Brough (writer)|William Brough]] wrote successful burlesques, sometimes jointly and sometimes alone. Their burlesques include ''The Enchanted Isle'' (1848), ''Medea'' (1856), ''Masaniello'' (1857), ''The Sphinx'' (1849) and ''The Last Edition of Ivanhoe'' (1850). See Dereli, Cynthia. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3577 "Brough, Robert Barnabas (1828–1860)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; aimed at a conservative middle class audience, and [[H. J. Byron]]'s success was attributed to his skill in appealing to the lower middle classes.&lt;ref name=tls&gt;Speaight, George. "All froth and bubble", ''The Times Literary Supplement'', 1 October 1976, p. 1233&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most frequent subjects for burlesque were the plays of Shakespeare and grand opera. From the 1850s onwards, burlesquing of Italian, French and, later in the century, German opera was popular with London audiences. [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Il trovatore]]'' and ''[[La traviata]]'' received their British premieres in 1855 and 1856 respectively; British burlesques of them followed quickly.  ''Our Lady of the Cameleon'' by [[Leicester Silk Buckingham]] and ''Our Traviata'' by William F. Vandervell (both 1857) were followed by five different burlesque treatments of ''Il trovatore'', two of them by H. J. Byron: ''Ill Treated Trovatore, or the Mother the Maiden and the Musicianer'' (1863) and ''Il Trovatore or Larks with a Libretto'' (1880).&lt;ref name=marvin&gt;Marvin,  Roberta Montemorra. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3878318 "Verdian Opera Burlesqued: A Glimpse into Mid-Victorian Theatrical Culture",] ''Cambridge Opera Journal'', Vol. 15, No. 1 (March 2003), pp. 33–66, Cambridge University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operas of [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]], [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]], [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]], [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] and [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]] were burlesqued.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;&lt;ref name=marvin/&gt; In a 2003 study of the subject, Roberta Montemorra Marvin noted:

By the 1880s, almost every truly popular opera had become the subject of a burlesque. Generally appearing after an opera's premiere or following a successful revival, they usually enjoyed local production runs, often for a month or longer. The popularity of stage burlesque in general and operatic burlesque in particular seems to have stemmed from the many ways in which it entertained a diverse group, and the manner in which it fed and fed on the circus-like or carnivalesque atmosphere of public Victorian London.&lt;ref name=marvin/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[W. S. Gilbert]] wrote five opera burlesques early in his career, beginning with ''[[Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack]]'' (1866), the most successful of which was ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'' (1868).&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1870s, [[Lydia Thompson]]'s burlesque troupe, with [[Willie Edouin]], became famous for their burlesques, by such authors as [[H. B. Farnie]] and [[Robert Reece]], both in Britain and the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, W. J., rev. J. Gilliland.

The Shakespeare scholar [[Stanley Wells]] notes that although parodies of Shakespeare had appeared even in Shakespeare's lifetime, the heyday of Shakespearean burlesque was the Victorian era.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Stanley. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2867735 "Shakespearian Burlesques",] ''Shakespeare Quarterly'', Vol. 16, No. 1 (Winter, 1965), pp. 49–61, Folger Shakespeare Library in association with George Washington University, accessed 2 February 2011  {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wells observes that the typical Victorian Shakespeare burlesque "takes a Shakespeare play as its point of departure and creates from it a mainly comic entertainment, often in ways that bear no relation to the original play."&lt;ref name=Wells55&gt;Wells, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;  Wells gives, as an example of the puns in the texts, the following: Macbeth and Banquo make their first entrance under an umbrella.  The witches greet them with "Hail! hail! hail!": Macbeth asks Banquo, "What mean these salutations, noble thane?" and is told "These showers of 'Hail' anticipate your 'reign'".&lt;ref name=Wells55/&gt;  Musically, Shakespearean burlesques were as varied as the others of the genre.  An 1859 burlesque of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' contained 23 musical numbers, some from opera, such as the serenade from ''[[Don Pasquale]]'', and some from traditional airs and popular songs of the day including "[[Buffalo Gals]]", and "Nix my Dolly".&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs,  Henry E., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2869557 "The Bard Debunked",] ''Shakespeare Quarterly'', Vol. 31, No. 2 (Summer, 1980), pp. 294–96, Folger Shakespeare Library in association with George Washington University, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Faustupto.jpg|right|thumb|Sheet music from ''[[Faust up to Date]]'']]
The dialogue for burlesques was generally written in rhyming couplets, or, less often, in other verse forms, such as blank verse; it was notable for its bad [[pun]]s.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;  For example, in ''[[Faust up to Date]]'' (1888), a couplet reads:
:Mephistopheles: "Along the Riviera dudes her praises sing."
:Walerlie: "Oh, did you Riviera such a thing?"&lt;ref&gt;Lubbock, Mark.  [http://www.theatrehistory.com/british/lightopera001.html "History of British musical theatre",] ''The Complete Book of Light Opera'', New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1962, pp. 467–68&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Grove'', although "an almost indispensable element of burlesque was the display of attractive women dressed in tights, often in [[Breeches role|travesty roles]] ... the plays themselves did not normally tend to indecency."&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;  Some contemporary critics took a sterner view; in an 1885 article, the critic Thomas Heyward praised Planché ("fanciful and elegant") and Gilbert ("witty, never vulgar"), but wrote of the genre as a whole, "the flashy, 'leggy', burlesque, with its 'slangy' songs, loutish 'breakdowns', vulgar jests, paltry puns and witless grimacing at all that is graceful and poetic is simply odious. … Burlesque, insensate, spiritless and undiscriminating, demoralizes both the audience and the players. It debases the public taste."&lt;ref&gt;Heyward, Thomas, "Burlesque: Its Uses and Abuses", ''Tinsley's Magazine'', November 1885,  p. 477&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert expressed his own views on the worth of burlesque:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The question whether burlesque has a claim to rank as art is, I think, one of degree. Bad burlesque is as far removed from true art as is a bad picture. But burlesque in its higher development calls for high intellectual power on the part of its professors. [[Aristophanes]], [[Rabelais]], [[George Cruikshank|Geo Cruikshank]], the authors of the ''[[Rejected Addresses]]'', [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]], Planché were all in their respective lines professors of true burlesque.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, W. S., Letter to Blanche Reives, ''quoted'' in "Modern Burlesque", ''The Orchestra'', November 1880, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his 1859 [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow]] burlesque ''Hi-A-Wa-Tha'', the American playwright Charles Walcot encapsulated the character of burlesque in the epilogue, addressed to the audience by [[Mrs. John Wood]] as Minnehaha:
:Ye who love extravaganza,
:Love to laugh at all things funny,
:Love the bold anachronism.
:And the work of paste and scissors,
:And "the unities" destruction,
:Nigger airs, old glees, and catches,
:Interspersed with gems of Op'ra,
:Jokes and puns, good, bad, and so-so, –
:Come and see this mutilation,
:This disgraceful Hiawatha, Mongrel, doggerel Hiawatha!&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in Hewitt, Barnard. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3204686  "Mrs. John Wood and the Lost Art of Burlesque Acting",] ''Educational Theatre Journal'', Vol. 13, No. 2 (May, 1961), pp. 82–85, Johns Hopkins University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar vein, ten years later, Gilbert gave an English viewpoint on burlesque, in his epilogue to ''[[The Pretty Druidess]]'':
:So for burlesque I plead. Forgive our rhymes;
:Forgive the jokes you've heard five thousand times;
:Forgive each breakdown, cellar-flap, and clog,&lt;ref&gt;Three types of dance popular in burlesque&lt;/ref&gt;
:Our low-bred songs – our slangy dialogue;
:And, above all – oh, ye with double barrel –
:Forgive the scantiness of our apparel! &lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender reversal and female sexuality==
[[File:The_High_Rollers_Extravaganza_Co._-_Bend_Her_-_c.1900.jpg|thumb|300px|American burlesque on ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ|Ben Hur]]'', c. 1900.]]
Actresses in burlesque would often play [[breeches role]]s, which were male roles played by women; likewise, men eventually began to play older female roles.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;Hall, Edith. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30222456 "Classical Mythology in the Victorian Popular Culture"], ''International Journal of the Classic Tradition'', 1999, vol. 5, issue 3, pp. 336–366, accessed 4 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  These reversals allowed viewers to distance themselves from the morality of the play, focusing more on joy and entertainment than catharsis, a definitive shift away from neoclassical ideas.&lt;ref name=Hall /&gt;

The depiction of female sexuality in Victorian burlesque was an example of the connection between women as performers and women as sexual objects in Victorian culture.&lt;ref name="Buszek"&gt;Buszek, Maria-Elena.  [http://ehis.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=394dd17c-6070-4982-a2c4-2e5723826ac7%40sessionmgr104&amp;vid=5&amp;hid=115 "Representing 'Awarishness': Burlesque, Feminist Transgression, and the 19th-Century Pin-up"]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''The Drama Review'', 1999, vol. 43, issue 4, pp. 141–162, accessed 4 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the history of theatre the participation of women on stage has been questioned.  Victorian culture viewed paid female performance as being closely associated with prostitution, “a profession in which most women in the theatre dabbled, if not took on as a primary source of income.”&lt;ref name=Buszek /&gt;

==Gaiety Theatre==
[[Image:Florence St. John.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Florence St. John]] in ''[[Carmen up to Data]]'']]
Burlesque became the specialty of London's [[Royal Strand Theatre]] and [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] from the 1860s to the early 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Sherson, Erroll, "Lost London Playhouses", ''The Stage'', 28 June 1923, p. 21, one of a series of articles later published in a 1925 book of same name.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1860s and 1870s, burlesques were often one-act pieces running less than an hour and using [[pastiche]]s and parodies of popular songs, opera [[aria]]s and other music that the audience would readily recognize. [[Nellie Farren]] starred as the Gaiety Theatre's "principal boy" from 1868, and [[John D'Auban]] choreographed the burlesques there from 1868 to 1891.&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;"Mr. D'Auban's 'Startrap' Jumps". ''The Times'', 17 April 1922, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tm&gt;Biographical file for John D'Auban, list of productions and theatres, [[The Theatre Museum]], London (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward O'Connor Terry]] joined the theatre in 1876. Early Gaiety burlesques included ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'' (1868, by Gilbert), ''The Bohemian G-yurl and the Unapproachable Pole'' (1877), ''Blue Beard'' (1882), ''Ariel'' (1883, by [[F. C. Burnand]]) and ''[[Galatea, or Pygmalion Reversed]]'' (1883).

Beginning in the 1880s, when comedian-writer [[Fred Leslie]] joined the Gaiety, composers like [[Meyer Lutz]] and [[Osmond Carr]] contributed original music to the burlesques, which were extended to a full-length two- or three-act format.&lt;ref&gt;"Theatrical Humour in the Seventies", ''[[The Times]]'', 20 February 1914, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; These later Gaiety burlesques starred Farren and Leslie.  They often included Leslie's [[libretti]], written under his pseudonym, "A. C. Torr",&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Maurice. 'The spark that lit the bonfire', in ''Gilbert and Sullivan News'' (London) Spring 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and were usually given an original score by Lutz: ''[[Little Jack Sheppard]]'' (1885), ''[[Monte Cristo Jr.]]'' (1886), ''Pretty Esmeralda'' (1887), ''[[Frankenstein, or The Vampire's Victim]]'' (1887),&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead, pp. 14 and 55&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mazeppa'' and ''[[Faust up to Date]]'' (1888).  ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blase Roue|Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]'' (1889) made fun of the play ''[[Ruy Blas]]'' by [[Victor Hugo]].&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead, pp. 57–58&lt;/ref&gt;  The title was a pun, and the worse the pun, the more Victorian audiences were amused.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Donald J., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3825187 "The Uses of Victorian Laughter",] ''Victorian Studies'', Vol. 10, No. 2 (December 1966), pp. 145–76,  Indiana University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last Gaiety burlesques were ''[[Carmen up to Data]]'' (1890),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Archive/August/prog1detail1.htm |title=Programme for ''Carmen up to Data'' |access-date=10 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210092757/http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Archive/August/prog1detail1.htm |archive-date=10 December 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, pp. 254–55&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Cinder Ellen up too Late]]'' (1891), and ''Don Juan'' (1892, with lyrics by [[Adrian Ross]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead, pp. 63–64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cuttings&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Gaiety.htm Arthur Lloyd Music Hall site (on Gaiety) ''Cuttings''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080104132022/http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Gaiety.htm |date=4 January 2008 }} accessed 01 Mar 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1890s, Farren retired, Leslie died, and musical burlesque went out of fashion in London, as the focus of the Gaiety and other burlesque theatres changed to the new genre of [[Edwardian musical comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, Kurt. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/38669 "Edwardes, George Joseph (1855–1915)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, [[Seymour Hicks]] declared that burlesque "is dead as a doornail and will never be revived." From her retirement, Nellie Farren endorsed this judgment.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, W. Davenport. "Burlesque: Old ''v.'' New", ''The Theatre'', 1 March 1896, pp. 144–45&lt;/ref&gt;

* {{Harvcoltxt|Booij|1989}} argues that the rising diphthongs {{IPA|/jɪ, jɛ, wa, wo/}} (he also lists the rare {{IPA|/jø/}}) are in fact glide-vowel sequences, not real diphthongs.{{sfnp|Booij|1989|pp=319–320}} This view is supported by {{Harvcoltxt|Hoekstra|Tiersma|2013}} who transcribe them as {{IPA|/jɪ, jɛ, wa, wo/}},{{sfnp|Hoekstra|Tiersma|2013|pp=509–510}} which is the convention used in this article.
* In Southwestern dialects, {{IPA|/wa, wo/}} are monophthongized to short central {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɞ}}, {{IPA link|ɵ}}]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hoekstra|2003|p=202}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Hof|1933|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The closeness of either of the elements of {{IPA|/ɛi̯/}} is somewhat variable, so that its phonetic realization is {{IPA|[æi̯ ~ æɪ̯ ~ ɛi̯ ~ ɛɪ̯]}}.{{sfnp|Tiersma|1999|p=12}}
* The first element of {{IPA|/œy̑/}} is more like {{IPAblink|œ}} than {{IPAblink|ø}}.{{sfnp|Tiersma|1999|p=12}} Many scholars&lt;ref&gt;For instance {{Harvcoltxt|Tiersma|1999}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Keil|2003}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Hoekstra|Tiersma|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; transcribe this sound as {{IPA|/øy̑/}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Booij|1989}} transcribes it as {{IPA|/ʌy̑/}}, yet this article transcribes it {{IPA|/œy̑/}} to show that it is clearly distinct from the common diphthongal realization of {{IPA|/øː/}} (having a much lower starting point) and that it is virtually identical to {{IPA|/œy̑/}} in Standard Dutch.

* {{IPA|/m, p, b/}} are bilabial, whereas {{IPA|/f, v/}} are labiodental.{{sfnp|Sipma|1913|pp=8, 15–16}}
** {{IPA|/v/}} has two allophones: an approximant {{IPAblink|ʋ}}, which appears word-initially, and a fricative {{IPAblink|v}}, which occurs elsewhere.{{sfnp|Keil|2003|p=7}}
** In some cases, {{IPA|/d/}} alternates with {{IPA|/r/}}.{{sfnp|Keil|2003|p=8}}
** {{IPA|/r/}} is silent before other alveolar consonants.{{sfnp|Keil|2003|p=8}}{{sfnp|Tiersma|1999|pp=28–29}} An exception to this rule are recent loanwords from Standard Dutch (e.g. ''sport''), which may or may not be pronounced with {{IPA|[r]}}.{{sfnp|Tiersma|1999|p=29}}
* {{IPA|/ŋ, k, x, ɣ/}} are velar, whereas {{IPA|/j/}} is palatal.{{sfnp|Sipma|1913|pp=8, 15–17}}
** {{IPA|/ɣ/}} has two allophones: a plosive {{IPAblink|ɡ}}, which appears word-initially and syllable-initially (the latter only when stressed), and a fricative {{IPAblink|ɣ}}, which occurs elsewhere.{{sfnp|Hoekstra|2001|p=86}}{{sfnp|Sipma|1913|pp=15, 17}}
* The syllabic sonorants {{IPA|[m̩, n̩, ŋ̍, l̩, r̩]}} occur in the following circumstances:
** In the ending {{angle bracket|en}}, which in careful speech is pronounced {{IPA|[ən]}}:{{sfnp|Sipma|1913|p=36}}
*** It is realized as {{IPA|[m̩]}} when preceded by {{IPA|/m, p, b/}}.{{sfnp|Sipma|1913|p=36}}
*** It is realized as {{IPA|[n̩]}} when preceded by {{IPA|/f, v, n, t, d, s, z, r, l/}}.{{sfnp|Sipma|1913|p=36}}
*** It is realized as {{IPA|[ŋ̍]}} when preceded by {{IPA|/k, x, ɣ/}}.{{sfnp|Sipma|1913|p=36}}
** In the endings {{angle bracket|el}} and {{angle bracket|er}} (in careful speech: {{IPA|[əl]}} and {{IPA|[ər]}}, respectively), which after consonants are realized as {{IPA|[l̩]}} and {{IPA|[r̩]}}, respectively.{{sfnp|Sipma|1913|p=36}}
** In some other cases. See {{Harvcoltxt|Sipma|1913|p=36}} for more information.
** {{IPA|/j/}} and the {{IPA|[ʋ]}} allophone of {{IPA|/v/}} are the only sonorants which cannot be syllabic.
* The sequences {{IPA|/nj, tj, dj, sj, zj/}} coalesce to {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɲ}}, {{IPA link|tɕ}}, {{IPA link|dʑ}}, {{IPA link|ɕ}}, {{IPA link|ʑ}}]}}.
* Glottal stop {{IPAblink|ʔ}} may precede word-initial vowels. In careful speech, it may also occur between unstressed and stressed vowel or diphthong.{{sfnp|Sipma|1913|p=15}}
* Among fricatives, neither {{IPA|/x/}} nor any of the voiced fricatives can occur word-initially.{{sfnp|Sipma|1913|pp=16–17}}
* {{IPA|/l/}} is velarized {{IPAblink|ɫ}} in all environments except before the close front vowels {{IPA|/i, iː, y, yː/}}, where it is realized as clear {{IPAblink|l}}.

=== Final devoicing ===
Word-final {{IPA|/b, d/}} are realized as voiceless {{IPA|[{{IPA link|p}}, {{IPA link|t}}]}}.{{sfnp|van der Veen|2001|p=104}} Note, however, that final {{IPA|/b/}} is rare,{{sfnp|Tiersma|1999|p=21}} and that in loanwords from Standard Dutch, final {{IPA|/ɣ/}} can also appear, and is also devoiced to {{IPAblink|x}}.

WFP.org. Retrieved 2018-11-19&lt;/ref&gt; From its headquarters in [[Rome]] and from more than 80 country offices around the world, the WFP works to help people who cannot produce or obtain enough food for themselves and their families. It is a member of the [[United Nations Development Group]] and part of its executive committee.&lt;ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:Sede WFP Roma.jpg|thumb|WFP Headquarters in [[Rome]]]]

WFP was first established in 1961&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=World Food Program |title=About |url=http://www.wfp.org/about |accessdate=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the 1960 [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) Conference, when [[George McGovern]], director of the US [[Food for Peace]] Programmes, proposed establishing a multilateral food aid programme. The WFP was formally established in 1963 by the FAO and the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on a three-year experimental basis. In 1965, the programme was extended to a continuing basis.

===Goals and strategies===
[[File:Armored vehicle from the UN World Food Program.JPG|thumb|A WFP armoured vehicle.]]
The WFP strives to eradicate [[hunger]] and [[malnutrition]], with the ultimate goal in mind of eliminating the need for food aid itself.

The objectives that the WFP hopes to achieve are to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=WFP |title=Our Work |url=http://www.wfp.org/our-work |publisher=WFP |accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

# "Save lives and protect livelihoods in emergencies"
# "Support food security and nutrition and (re)build livelihoods in fragile settings and following emergencies"
# "Reduce risk and enable people, communities and countries to meet their own food and nutrition needs"
# "Reduce undernutrition and break the intergenerational cycle of hunger"
# "Zero Hunger in 2030"

WFP food aid is also directed to fight [[micronutrient]] deficiencies, reduce [[child mortality]], improve maternal health, and combat disease, including [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]].  Food-for-work programmes help promote environmental and economic stability and agricultural production.

=== Funding ===

The WFP operations are funded by voluntary donations from governments of the world, corporations and private donors. The organization's administrative costs are only seven percent—one of the lowest and best among [[aid agency|aid agencies]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} 
From 2008-2012, private voluntary donors donated around $500 million.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
In 2016, WFP received from donors in total US$ 5,933,529,247. The USA were the major donor of WFP with 2 billion US$, followed by the European Commission (894 million US$) and Germany (884 million US$)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wfp.org/funding/year/2016&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Organization==
The WFP is governed by an executive board which consists of representatives from 36 member states. [[David Beasley]] is the current executive director, appointed jointly by the [[UN Secretary General]] and the director-general of the FAO for a five-year term. He heads the secretariat of the WFP. The [[European Union]] is a permanent observer in the WFP and, as a major donor, participates in the work of its executive board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/rome/eu_united_nations/work_with_3_un_agencies_rome/index_en.htm|title=European Union|publisher=|accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its vision is a "world in which every man, woman and child has access at all times to the food needed for an active and healthy life."

The WFP has a staff of about 15,000 people,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wfp.org/world-humanitarian-summit/using-technology-leave-no-one-behind&lt;/ref&gt; the majority of whom work in remote areas.

=== Logistics Cluster ===
The [[Logistics Cluster]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logcluster.org/|publisher=Logistics Cluster|title=Logistics Cluster|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Inter-Agency Standing Committee]] (IASC) humanitarian coordination mechanism whose primary role is supporting emergency responses. One of eleven sectoral coordination bodies, it was set by [[United Nations|UN]] [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] resolution 46/182 in December 1991 and extended in the Humanitarian Reform of 2005, with new elements adopted to improve capacity, predictability, accountability, leadership and partnership.

The Logistics Cluster provides coordination and information management services to support operational decision-making and improve the predictability, timeliness and efficiency of humanitarian emergency responses. Where necessary, the Logistics Cluster also facilitates access to common [[logistics]] services. Due to its expertise in the field of [[Humanitarian Logistics|humanitarian logistics]], the World Food Programme (WFP) was chosen by the IASC as the lead agency for the Logistics Cluster. WFP hosts the Global Logistics Cluster support team in its headquarters in Rome. WFP also acts as a ‘provider of last resort’ offering common logistics services, when critical gaps hamper the humanitarian response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://logcluster.org|title=Logistics Cluster|website=logcluster.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
[[File:Un c-130 food delivery rumbek sudan.jpg|thumb|United Nations [[C-130 Hercules]] transports deliver food for the [[Rumbek]] region of southern [[Sudan]] (2004).]]

In 2013, the WFP reached 80.9 million people in 75 countries and provided 3.1 million tonnes of food,&lt;ref&gt;[http://publications.wfp.org/en/apr/2013/ The World Food Programme's Achievements in 2013]. WFP.org. Retrieved 2015-04-08.&lt;/ref&gt; including nutritionally enriched Ready-to-use [[therapeutic food]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wfp.org/nutrition/special-nutritional-products Special Nutritional Products]. World Food Programme. Retrieved 2015-04-08.&lt;/ref&gt; 7.8 million malnourished children received special nutritional support in 2013, and 18.6 million children received school meals or take-home rations.

In 2015, the WFP reached 76.7 million people in 81 countries. In emergencies, more than 50 million people were reached in order to improve their nutrition and food security. School meals were provided to 17.4 million children helping retain children in schools, supporting uninterrupted access to education.&lt;ref&gt;http://publications.wfp.org/en/annual-report/2015/?_ga=2.249509895.1874197627.1495936135-1834641711.1495319110&lt;/ref&gt;

The WFP has scaled up its use of cash and vouchers as food assistance tools. 7.9 million people received assistance through cash or voucher programmes in 2013. In the same year, the WFP purchased food in 91 countries; 86% of that food came from developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.wfp.org/stellent/groups/public/documents/newsroom/wfp261411.jpg All about the World Food Programme].

Launched in September 2008, P4P assists smallholder farmers by offering them opportunities to access agricultural markets and to become competitive players in the marketplace. The project spanned across 20 countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America and trained 800,000 farmers in improved agricultural production, post-harvest handling, quality assurance, group marketing, agricultural finance and contracting with the WFP. The project resulted in 366,000 metric tons of food produced and generated more than $148 million in income for its smallholder farmers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wfp.org/sites/default/files/P4P%20-%20Reflections%20on%20the%20pilot%2C%20February%202015.pdf Purchase for Progress: Reflections on the pilot, February 2015]. WFP.org. Retrieved 2015-04-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

The WFP focuses its food assistance on those who are most vulnerable to hunger, which most frequently means women, children, the sick and the elderly. In fact, part of the response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake consisted of distributing food aid only to women as experience built up over almost 5 decades of working in emergency situations has demonstrated that giving food only to women helps to ensure that it is spread evenly among all household members. School-feeding and/or take-home ration programmes in 71 countries help students focus on their studies and encourage parents to send their children, especially girls, to school.&lt;ref&gt;https://docs.wfp.org/api/documents/3f66543adf5c482a95810d57a2b1518b/download/?_ga=2.212632660.1762357695.1495937773-1834641711.1495319110&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emergency Response Classifications ===
The WFP has a system of classifications known as the Emergency Response Classifications designated toward situations that require immediate response. 

This response is activated under the following criteria:

# When human suffering in which domestic governments do or can not respond to adequately
# The United Nations reputation is under scrutiny
# When there is an obvious need for aid from the WFP

The Emergency Response Classifications are divided as follows, with emergency intensity increasing with each level:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://documents.wfp.org/stellent/groups/public/documents/resources/wfp264770.pdf|title=WFP Emergency Response Classifications|last=|first=|date=8 May 2014|website=World Food Programme|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Level 1''' – Response is activated. Resources are allocated to prepare for the WFP's local office to respond
* '''Level 2''' – A country's resources require regional assistance with an emergency across one or multiple countries/territories
* '''Level 3''' – The emergency overpowers the WFP's local offices and requires a global response from the entire WFP organization

==== Current Level 3 emergencies ====
Listed countries are currently classified as Level 3:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wfpusa.org/articles/understanding-l3-emergencies/|title=Understanding L3 Emergencies|website=World Food Program USA|language=en|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Iraq]] (Level 3)
* [[Nigeria]] (Level 3)
* [[South Sudan]] (Level 3)
* [[Syria]] (Level 3)
* [[Yemen]] (Level 3)

== Official partnerships and initiatives ==

The WFP coordinates and cooperates with a number of official partners in emergencies and development projects. These partners include national government agencies such as [[DFID]], [[ECHO (European Commission)|ECHO]], [[EuropeAid Development and Cooperation|EuropeAid]], [[USAID]]; UN agencies such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD); [[non-governmental organizations]] such as [[Save the Children]], [[Catholic Relief Services]] and [[Norwegian Refugee Council]]; as well as corporate partners such as [[Boston Consulting Group]], [http://www.dsm.com DSM N.V.], and [[Cargill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wfp.org/partners/private-sector/meet-our-partners |title=WFP's Partners |publisher=World Food Programme |accessdate=2014-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Grassroots efforts ===

In 2004, the WFP tasked [[Auburn University]] in [[Auburn, Alabama|Auburn]], [[Alabama]] with heading the first student-led War on Hunger effort, after a 2002 [[Northwestern University]] pilot. Auburn founded the [[Committee of 19]], which has not only led campus and community hunger awareness events but also developed a War on Hunger model for use on campuses across the country.

The WFP has launched a global advocacy and fundraising event called [[Walk the World]]. On one single day each year, hundreds of thousands of people in every time zone all over the world walk to call for the end of child hunger. In 2005, more than 200,000 people walked in 296 locations. In 2006, there were 760,000 participants in 118 countries all over the world. This event is part of the campaign to achieve the [[Millennium Development Goals]], specifically to halve the number of people who suffer from hunger and poverty by 2015.

A growing number of grassroots global events and celebrations such as [[International Day of Peace]], [[World Party Day]] participants, and [[Peace One Day]] recommend the WFP on radio broadcasts as an immediate reach out action, putting help within reach of anyone with the information that a quarter feeds a child for a day. [[Fill the Cup]] campaign takes just 25 US cents to fill one of the "red cups" that the World Food Programme uses to give hungry children a regular school meal of porridge, rice or beans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wfp.org/node/222 Fill the cup: turning hunger into hope for millions of children].

=== World Hunger Relief Week ===

In 2007, the WFP joined with [[Yum! Brands]], the world’s largest restaurant company, to launch the first annual World Hunger Relief Week, a global campaign to increase awareness about hunger, engage volunteers, and raise critically needed funds to help the WFP serve the world's areas of greatest need. World Hunger Relief Week 2007 leveraged the power of nearly 35,000 restaurants around the world, sparking a global movement to end hunger and generating an overwhelming outpouring of support from millions of customers, employees, franchisees and their families. Nearly one million Yum!, KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, Long John Silver's and A&amp;W All American Food employees, franchisees and their families volunteered close to 4 million hours to aid hunger relief efforts in communities worldwide, while helping to raise $16 million throughout the World Hunger Relief Week initiative for the World Food Programme and other hunger relief agencies around the world. The initiative has been repeated every year since.

=== World Food Program USA ===
World Food Program USA, before 2010 known as Friends of the World Food Program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wfp.org/stories/wfp%E2%80%99s-us-partner-organisation-new-name-new-site-new-online-tools|title=WFP’s USA Partner Organisation: New Name, New Site, New Online Tools|author=UN World Food Programme|date=16 July 2010|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; works to solve global hunger, building a world where everyone has the food and nutrition needed to lead healthy, productive lives. WFP USA raises support for these efforts in the United States by engaging individuals, organizations and businesses, shaping public policy and generating resources for WFP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wfpusa.org/wfp-usas-mission/|title=Our Mission – A world without hunger|author=World Food Program USA|work=World Food Program USA|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

[[Kenya]]n economist [[James Shikwati]] says in an interview with ''[[Der Spiegel]]'': "aid to Africa does more harm than good".&lt;ref name="DS Interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,363663,00.html|title=SPIEGEL Interview with African Economics Expert: "For God's Sake, Please Stop the Aid!"|author1=SPIEGEL ONLINE|author2= Hamburg|author3= Germany|date=3 July 2005|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to him, the food aid increases [[corruption]] as local politicians have the opportunity to steal some of the aid to [[bribery|bribe]] voters or to sell the aid in the [[black market]]s killing the [[Subsistence agriculture|local agriculture]].&lt;ref name="AP Sell Aid"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/9798947|title=Removed: news agency feed article|work=the Guardian|accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that the WFP people as an organization "are in the absurd situation of, on the one hand, being dedicated to the fight against hunger while, on the other hand, being faced with unemployment were hunger actually eliminated". He suggests that WFP answers too easily to the calls of the corrupted governments, and supplies too much of food aid leading to reduction of the production of [[local farming|local farmers]] as "no one can compete with the UN's World Food Programme". 

The World Food Programme was also criticized by José Ciro Martínez and Brent Eng in their essay "The Unintended Consequences of Emergency Food Aid: Neutrality, Sovereignty and Politics in the [[Syrian Civil War]], 2012-15."  due to an interview conducted with an employee of the organization who stated: "Most aid is still subject to strict control measures by the government, who also requests that it be distributed through state approved bodies such as [[Syrian Arab Red Crescent|SARC]]. I believe the government closely oversees if not completely controls these organizations." This statement was expanded upon by the authors as they noted that food aid given in Syria would go to the military and its men first.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martinez, Eng|first=Jose, Brent|year=2015|title="The Unintended Consequences of Emergency Food Aid: Neutrality, Sovereignty and Politics in the Syrian Civil War, 2012-15."|url=https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/publications/ia/INTA92_1_08_MartinezEng.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
