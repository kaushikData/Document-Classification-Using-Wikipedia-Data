Historically, dislike or hatred toward the [[Netherlands]]. The [[Dutch people]] and their culture has arisen from the [[colonization]] undertaken by the Netherlands, and from the roles it has played in European wars. This sentiment is reflected in various expressions that have entered the English language.

==Dutch colonies==

===Southeast Asia===
Most of present-day Indonesia was a Dutch colony &amp;ndash; the [[Dutch East Indies]] &amp;ndash; from 1800 until the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese invasion]] during World War II. After the defeat of the Japanese, when the Dutch attempted to reassert control, anti-Dutch feeling developed among the native population, encompassing anything associated with the Dutch.&lt;ref name="Laksana2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Albertus Bagus Laksana|title=Muslim and Catholic Pilgrimage Practices: Explorations Through Java|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y34WDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT177|date=29 April 2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-09123-3|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FreyPruessen2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marc Frey|author2=Ronald W.

Sharpe|isbn=978-0-7656-3185-5|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome was the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], culminating in 1949 in the independence of Indonesia.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, following the [[Boer War]] (1899-1902) between the British government and settlers of Dutch descent, anti-Dutch sentiments were present within the English-speaking population&lt;ref name="Barnouw2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Adriaan J. Barnouw|title=Language and race problems in South Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lugsBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49|year=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-011-9255-2|pages=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were identified with the [[Unionist Party (South Africa)|Unionist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Statesman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rt9IAQAAMAAJ|year=1921|publisher=Statesman Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South America and the Caribbean===
A growing nationalist movement gave rise to anti-Dutch sentiment during the 1950s in the then colony of [[Surinam (Dutch colony)|Surinam]].&lt;ref name="Dew2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Dew|title=The Difficult Flowering of Surinam: Ethnicity and Politics in a Plural Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KIYJBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA97|year=2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-017-3278-9|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suriname became self-governing in 1954 and fully independent in 1975.

==European wars==

===Anglo-Dutch Wars===
From the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] of the 17th to 19th centuries date expressions conveying varying degrees of hostility or mockery towards the Dutch, such as "[[Dutch courage]]", "[[Dutch uncle]]", "[[Going Dutch]]", "Dutch treat", "[[Double Dutch (disambiguation)|Double Dutch]]" and "I'm a Dutchman". Anti-Dutch feeling grew up in England during the three wars against the Dutch Republic between 1652 and 1674, and continued during and after the reign of [[William III of England|William of Orange]].&lt;ref name="HoakFeingold1996"&gt;Jonathan Israel, "England, the Dutch, and the Struggle for Mastery of World Trade in the Age of the Glorious Revolution (1682-1702)", in {{cite book|author1=Dale Hoak|author2=Mordechai Feingold|title=The World of William and Mary: Anglo-Dutch Perspectives on the Revolution of 1688-89|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8g9Xj7C-q9YC&amp;pg=PA86|year=1996|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-2406-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First World War===
The [[Neutral country|neutrality]] maintained by the Netherlands during the [[World War I|First World War]] evoked unfavourable comment in Britain, epitomised by a remark in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'': {{Quote|text=Holland is a low country, in fact it is such a very low country that it is no wonder that it is dammed all round. |author=Various |source=&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29669/29669-h/29669-h.htm "Charivaria"], ''Punch'', Vol. 147, 30 December 1914&lt;/ref&gt;
 }}

===Second World War===
During [[World War II]], [[Germany|German]] occupiers in [[Belgium]] were promoting the use of [[Dutch language]] in communities of [[French language|French]]-speakers, which lead to strong Dutchphobia among those people.&lt;ref name="State2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul F.

==The artwork==

The Arbre à Palabre by [[Frédéric Keiff]] is a [[wikt:palaver|palaver]] tree whose trunk and branches are made of painted [[iron]] rods, while attached fragments of colored [[glass]] represent leaves. The installation is more than 5 meters tall with a canopy circumference of 7 meters, and it is equipped with wooden slabs embedded in the trunk, serving as benches. It is a passageway installation.

Initially conceived to substitute the former palaver tree of Douala, a huge [[baobab]] located in the district of [[Bonaberi]], which fell down in 1993, the symbolic meaning of the installation forced some changes in the process. Traditionally, around the palaver tree, the chief of the village and the council members (the so-called notables) meet and seat in order to take the most important political and social decisions concerning the community, and it is there that tradition values were orally transmitted through generations.

This artwork became the subject of a long discussion between the chief of the village and the notables, who finally decided to forbid a foreign artist to place his artwork next to the rest of the former palaver tree. However, it was important that Keiff’s installation was positioned in a public space, easily accessible to inhabitants in order to guarantee that the contemporary palaver tree would keep on holding its symbolic function as a meeting, discussion, and sharing point. The superior chief of Douala, the Prince [[René Duala Manga Bell]], offered one of his properties in Bonanjo for repositioning the Arbre à Palabre that was inaugurated for [[c:Category:SUD Salon Urbain de Douala 2007|SUD 2007]] and officially donated to the city of Douala.

The park where the Arbre à Palabre is located belongs to the Bell family, even if the installation itself is in the public domain. This area is surrounded by three historical monuments of Douala: to the North, the [[Vault of kings Bell]], where today the same René Douala Manga Bell lies; to the South, the Espace [[doual'art]] (funding agency of the project) from which one can clearly see the [[Palace of the Kings Bell]], commonly known as “La Pagode”, built in 1905 by German colonizers for the king [[Auguste Manga Ndoumbe]]; and, finally, to the West, the [[Former palace of Justice of Douala|Old law court building]].

[[File:Ballochmyle Cup and Ring marked stone - 2.JPG|thumb|250px|Cup-and-ring mark stone at Ballochmyle, [[Mauchline]]]]
The '''Ballochmyle cup and ring marks''' were first recorded at Ballochmyle (NS 5107 2552), [[Mauchline]], [[East Ayrshire]], Scotland in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Love|first=|year=2003|title=Ayrshire : Discovering a County.|publisher=|isbn=|page= 152}}&lt;/ref&gt; very unusually carved on a vertical red sandstone cliff face, forming one of the most extensive areas of such carvings as yet found in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stevenson|first=|year=2010|title=Cup-and-Ring Markings at Ballochmyle, Ayrshire|publisher=|isbn=|page= 33}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been designated a [[scheduled ancient monument]]. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://portal.historicenvironment.scot/designation/SM4484|title=Ballochmyle Viaduct,rock carvings 280m NE of - SM4484|publisher= Historic Environment Scotland|accessdate= 10 September 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
These carvings or [[petroglyph]]s were first recorded in 1986 (although a '1751' carved date suggests an earlier discovery) when the [[Kingencleugh Castle|Kingencleugh Estate]] decided to clear an area of vegetation along the north side of the Liddell Burn that is a minor tributary stream of the [[River Ayr]] in an area famous for its quarrying of red sandstone. The removal of vegetation exposed the carvings that are distributed across two faces of a vertical outcrop of rock and they were reported to the Dick Institute in [[Kilmarnock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detailed Survey of Ballochmyle Cup and Ring Marks, Ayrshire|url=http://www.aocarchaeology.com/news/article/ballochmyle-survey/|publisher=AOC Archaeology Group|access-date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of possible medieval carvings, the extensive quarrying with numerous workmen employed in the area, especially during the construction of the Ballochmyle Viaduct, emphasises how surprising it is that these [[glyph]]s were overlooked for so long, especially as they are only about 2&amp;nbsp;km south-east of [[Mauchline]]'s town centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stevenson|first=|year=2010|title=Cup-and-Ring Markings at Ballochmyle, Ayrshire|publisher=|isbn=|page= 33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The rock here is described as being a "''pink dessert sandstone from the [[Permian]] age showing clear signs of dune bedding''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stevenson|first=|year=2010|title=Cup-and-Ring Markings at Ballochmyle, Ayrshire|publisher=|isbn=|page= 33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cup and ring marks are composed of two 'panels' with several hundred '[[Cup and ring mark|cup and ring]]' and other [[glyph]]s or carvings in a range of styles, ranging from single shallow cups through to deeper cups with multiple rings. Less common, but unique in the Scottish context are ‘square with cup’ carvings; ‘ringed stars’ are also present. Three deer-like carvings and some other inscriptions with Lombardic style letters&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stevenson|first=|year=2010|title=Cup-and-Ring Markings at Ballochmyle, Ayrshire|publisher=|isbn=|page= 38}}&lt;/ref&gt; were also carved into the rockface and these are thought to be medieval in date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detailed Survey of Ballochmyle Cup and Ring Marks, Ayrshire|url=http://www.aocarchaeology.com/news/article/ballochmyle-survey/|publisher=AOC Archaeology Group|access-date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several feet of soil were removed from the bottom of the corner that divides the two main halves of the site and this uncovered three '[[Trilithon|trilithon-like]]' carvings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cup and Ring Marked Rock (Prehistoric)|url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/43557/ballochmyle|publisher=RCAHMS|access-date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Campbell|first=|year=2003|title=Ayrshire. A Historical Guide.|publisher=|isbn=|page= 138}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others may await discovery where the soil has not been removed. The carvings were protected by the vegetation and began to deteriorate after this was removed and in addition vandalism and theft of a panel has taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stevenson|first=|year=2010|title=Cup-and-Ring Markings at Ballochmyle, Ayrshire|publisher=|isbn=|page= 33}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that they were historically hidden from direct view by trees and shrubs.

The Ballochmyle [[glyph]]s or motifs are carved on red sandstone, however they are found elsewhere on other sedimentary rocks such as [[Millstone Grit]]s, as well as the harder [[igneous]] and [[Metamorphic|metamorphic rocks]] such as [[granite]]s and [[schist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The basic 'cup' is the most common carving however a wide range of glyphs exist with single to multiple concentric circles that are sometimes cut through in various ways by channels, etc. Where concentric rings exist the central cup often appears to dominate in depth and size&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that they were subject to repeated reworking over a period of time. Some incomplete or poorly formed glyphs exist here suggesting that different persons were involved in making them and frequent overlays of existing glyphs with either 'cups' or 'cup rings' suggests that they were created over an extended period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies suggest that distinct stylistic groupings may be present with one panel area having simple cups and cups with grooves, whilst another area has predominately bold cups with multiple concentric rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 35 &amp; 36}}&lt;/ref&gt; An area with an apparent Lombardic style lettering may read 'ASAID' with two or three unreadable leading letters and a likely lost section. The final element is a date '1751' that is considered authentic but did not lead to further recorded investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence suggests that cup and ring art was created from the [[Neolithic]] through to the [[Bronze Age]], that is approximately 4000 BC to 1500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cup and ring mark]] stones are frequently found throughout Britain, with over 2500 sites in England alone,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; however an unusual feature of those at Ballochmyle is that they have been carved on nearly or actual vertical surfaces rather than horizontal and often 'altar-like' exposed stone outcrops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cup and Ring Marked Rock (Prehistoric)|url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/43557/ballochmyle|publisher=RCAHMS|access-date=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of carvings were created using 'hammerstones' or 'peckers', examples of these have been found elsewhere, hitting the surface of the rock repeatedly or using a grinding motion until the desired design was formed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the long grooves appear to be a series of cups that were then joined together. The soft nature of the stone at Ballochmyle gives insights into how the [[glyphs]] were created with many small holes that could not have been formed by a hammering action.

The contrast with the original rock surface and the effect of shadow and rain usually makes the markings stand out however hints of the use of coloured pigments have been found at other sites&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and such things as animal fat, charcoal, plants dyes, etc. could have been used during various types of ceremonies to enhance the glyphs or as part of their cultural use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The frequency and widespread use of the same glyphs or motifs indicates that they had definite interpretive meanings and significance to the cultures that created them and these developed and then persisted over thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The locations indicate that these carvings were mostly for public display and not usually intended as part of secret practices where the fact that they were hidden was important.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It may be relevant that the Ballochmyle area has both spectacular geological formations and geographical features in addition to the presence of a significant [[Liminal deity|liminal]] zone in the form of a major watercourse, the [[River Ayr]]. Carvings into rocks can have deeper meanings such as with the carved footprint [[Petrosomatoglyph]]s at [[Dunadd]] in [[Argyll]], linking a person literally to the land. The concept of the [[Anima locus]] is pertinent here, that is the 'soul' of a place, its essential personality as perceived in the imagination and emotions of visitors. A concept linked to the belief in supernatural spirits of nature as residing in stones, springs, mountains, islands, trees, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pennick|first=|year=1996|title=Celtic Sacred Landscapes|publisher=|isbn=|pages= 13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A form of religious significance linked to life and death, past and present, real and spiritual worlds, etc. has been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant factor is that, as previously stated, they were created from [[Neolithic]] through to the [[Bronze Age]], that is approximately 4000 BC to 1500 BC&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they ceased when the [[Celts|Celtic Culture]] began to dominate and suppress older cultural practices. During this time smaller nomadic groups that might visit certain sites seasonally developed into sedentary communities with hierarchical leadership structures and specific communal religious practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cupandring.JPG|thumb|left|250px|A facsimile of an unusual cup and ring mark stone from [[Dalgarven]], [[North Ayrshire]] ]] 
[[File:Sardinia mamoiada perda pinta.jpg|250px|thumb|A cup and ring mark stone from [[Sardinia]] ]]
Many 'galleries' of [[cup and ring mark]] art are in prominent places within the landscape, such as river gorges, waterfalls, outcrops, caves, etc. and it has been suggested that they may have defined territorial boundaries, either for a locality or for a significant land holding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few prehistoric track ways have been positively identified however some link with the more practical aspects of [[Ley line]]s may be indicated by the observation that cup and ring art is sometimes found overlooking natural harbours, on prominent natural landscape features, in mountain passes, along valley sides, at the entrances to inland routes, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought that natural features of the rock faces may influence the cup and ring mark sizes, distribution and type in addition to 'framing' the carvings. Fissures, grooves, wind erosion marks, cracks, dune bedding, etc. may all have been regarded by the [[Cup and ring mark]] carvers as significant and meaningful in their own right to be copied, enhanced, removed or incorporated as possibly the work of their 'ancestors' or even the works of the gods themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cup and ring mark panels may have only been used seasonally and the varying level of complexity at sites has been interpreted as being both more and less significant in terms of the level of meaning present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sharpe|first=|year=2008|title=England's Rock Art|publisher=|isbn=|page= 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The universality of [[cup and ring mark]]ings suggest a commonality of the origins of such [[glyph]]s that may relate to natural phenomena that are deemed significant, such as the concentricles that form on water when an object or offering is placed in it and although this may have been interpreted differently by the many cultures involved, the [[liminality]] with associated themes of thresholds and communication with the 'other side' may be one explanation for the use of cup and rings rather than the extensive use of glyphs such as ovals, boxes, triangles, star-shapes, etc.

==Surveys of the markings==
In 2015 AOC Archaeology group were employed by the Forestry Commission Scotland to carry out a survey of laser scanning and [[photogrammetry]] on the Ballochmyle cup and ring marks. Laser scanning recorded the glyphs in 3D in minute detail, taking millions of measurements. The Photogrammetry involved photographing the site from many different angles and then bringing the data together to create a 3D model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detailed Survey of Ballochmyle Cup and Ring Marks, Ayrshire|url=http://www.aocarchaeology.com/news/article/ballochmyle-survey/|publisher=AOC Archaeology Group|access-date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RCAHMS carried out a survey on behalf of Historic Scotland in 1987 and a series of drawings were lodged with what is now [[Historic Environment Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cup and Ring Marked Rock (Prehistoric)|url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/43557/ballochmyle|publisher=RCAHMS|access-date=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known Bohemisms, entered into virtually all languages, are "[[robot]]", "[[polka]]" and "[[pistol]]". See [[List of English words of Czech origin]] for Bohemisms in English.

Many Bohemisms related to church and liturgy entered the [[Polish language]] in the [[Middle Ages]] during the [[Christianization of Poland]], under the influence of [[Moravia]]n and [[Bohemia]]n traditions.&lt;ref&gt;See: [http://bazhum.muzhp.pl/media//files/Historia_Slavorum_Occidentis/Historia_Slavorum_Occidentis-r2012-t2(3)/Historia_Slavorum_Occidentis-r2012-t2(3)-s210-233/Historia_Slavorum_Occidentis-r2012-t2(3)-s210-233.pdf Marzena Matla, Czeskie wpływy kulturowe w języku i piśmiennictwie państwa piastowskiego (od X do XIV wieku) w świetle historiografii polskiej] (in Polish)&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them ultimately originated from  [[Latin language|Latin]], the language of liturgy. 

The analysis of Bohemisms is a significant argument of the [[Edward L. Keenan]]'s hypothesis about the authorship of ''[[The Tale of Igor's Campaign]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward L.

==1960s popularity==
The Breton had a revival of popularity in the 1960s, with high-profile wearers helping to make it fashionable. During this era it also appeared in more extreme styles, with oversized turned-back brims. After British model [[Jean Shrimpton]] caused a scandal at the Melbourne Cup Carnival in  Australia in 1965 by attending Derby Day hatless, bare legged and in a short summer frock, she returned three days later to the [[Melbourne Cup]] in a sober tailored suit with a large ice-blue straw Breton hastily created by local milliner Adele Chapeaux of [[South Yarra]].&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite web|title=Hat's on, hat's off|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/11/01/sport/jean-shrimpton-melbourne-cup-fashion/|website=edition.cnn.com|publisher=CNN|accessdate=27 October 2014|ref=slide 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, a neat straw version was worn right on the back of the head by [[Mia Farrow]] in the horror film ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]''.&lt;ref name="Nylon Hoffman"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hoffman|first1=Ali|title=Private Icon/Rosemary's Baby|url=http://www.nylon.com/stories/8250|accessdate=27 October 2014|publisher=Nylon|date=3 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028052643/http://www.nylon.com/stories/8250|archivedate=28 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Toni Frissell, Swim fashion, 1950.jpg|thumb|160px|left|1950 swim fashion by photographer [[Toni Frissell]], showing a Breton-style sunhat with upturned brim]]
Such was the hat's popularity that ''[[The Times]]'' fashion editor [[Prudence Glynn]] singled it out in 1966 as part of the British 'uniform' at official summer events. In a feature warning of the perils of choosing an expensive occasion outfit in a country where the weather could not be relied upon, she said: "Look at the photographs taken at the Derby. The weather couldn't have been more unpromising, yet there were the British ladies staunchly parading the British Special Occasion Outfit (Subsection: Race Meetings) – Sling back shoes, wind-torn Bretons clapped onto untidy damp hair, nodding and smiling away under tons of artificial pansies and draped tulle."&lt;ref name="The Times Glynn 56648"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Glynn|first1=Prudence|title=Dressing down for the occasion|issue=56648|publisher=The Times|date=3 June 1966|ref=pg.15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as coming in a variety of sizes, Bretons may feature additional details such as feathers, flowers and ribbon trims.

===Variations===
In 1955, [[Christian Dior S.A.|Christian Dior]] introduced the wide-brimmed Breton – also known as the padre hat – for its resemblance to ecclesiastical headgear. Unlike the more traditional tipped back Breton, this model was worn flat on the head.&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune 300855"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Fall News in Headlines|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1955/08/30/page/27/article/the-fall-news-in-headlines|accessdate=18 November 2014|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=30 August 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Montreal Gazette Meehan"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meehan|first1=Hilda|title=New hat perks up old dress|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&amp;dat=19580314&amp;id=mkwwAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=d6gFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6096,2393408|accessdate=18 November 2014|publisher=Montreal Gazette|date=14 March 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brighton Science Festival''' is a yearly [[science festival]] held in [[Brighton]], on the [[UK]]'s South Coast since at least 2007. The festival is the brainchild of organiser [[Richard Robinson (puppeteer)|Richard Robinson]].  

Traditionally the festival has been held in February, but since 2017 the festival has been split across the year, with one set of events held in February and another set in September.

A '''chariot clock''' is a type of [[Mantel clock|mantel]]/table figural [[clock]] in the form of a [[chariot]] whose dial is set into the wheel or elsewhere, its origins date back to the second half of the 16th century southern Germany.&lt;ref name="Drouot catalogue"&gt;[http://catalogue.drouot.com/ref-drouot/lot-ventes-aux-encheres-drouot.jsp?id=2141796 Drouot catalogue]&lt;/ref&gt; Normally of classical mythology subject matter, it has been made in different periods and styles such as Renaissance, Louis XV, Louis XVI, Empire, Napoleon III, Art Deco, etc.

==History==
===Renaissance===
In the historical context of the [[Renaissance]], the so-called chariot clocks born in South Germany, a centre for clockmaking in Europe that flourished between 1550-1650, the leading cities being [[Augsburg]], [[Nuremberg]] and [[Munich]]. They were selfmoving wheeled tabletop clocks that included [[Automaton|automata]] figurines and some a musical movement too. The German examples have not the dial inserted in the wheel, but in the seat or some other place.

Most of them were fabricated in Augsburg, although several existing clocks cannot be located due to the lack of inscriptions or hallmarks and are therefore ascribed only to South German workshops. These rare and at those days very costly pieces were only afforded by the nobility and royal courts.

===The Golden Age: Empire style===

[[File:Austrian chariot clock.jpg|thumb|right|A rare Austrian chariot clock, which usually had cases made out of wood, not bronze, c. 1810. [[National Watch and Clock Museum]].]]
In the 18th century France, during the [[Louis XV]] and [[Louis XVI]] reigns a small number of models,&lt;ref name="Richard Redding Antiques"&gt;[http://www.richardreddingantiques.com/collection/horology/a-superb-empire-apollo-clock-attributed-to-p-p-thomire Richard Redding Antiques] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220130553/http://www.richardreddingantiques.com/collection/horology/a-superb-empire-apollo-clock-attributed-to-p-p-thomire |date=December 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; following their respective styles, were made, but it was not until the late 1790s and particularly during the first quarter of the 19th century that this type of clock found true popularity.&lt;ref name="Drouot catalogue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Richard Redding Antiques"/&gt; Its revival was largely inspired by [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon Bonaparte’s]] conquers and victories in battles,&lt;ref name="Richard Redding Antiques"/&gt; though it continued to be in vogue after his definitive fall in 1815, specifically until the mid 1820s.

Its popularity in much of Europe&lt;ref&gt;Yves and Marcel Gay and [[André Lemaire]], "Les Pendules au char", Bulletin of ANCAHA, No. 66, Spring 1993: p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; gave rise to a wide diversity of models (and variations within each model), allowing the fullest opportunity for the sculptor and bronzier to express their creativity and the brilliance of their craft. The freedom of trade initiated by the [[French Revolution]] allowed many casters, who during the [[ancien régime]] worked in workshops strictly limited to making [[bronze]], to develop large factories. They took advantage of this opportunity to execute all stages of bronze making within one factory and drew, cast, gilded, assembled and sold objects of their own workshops.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/20079738 Charlotte Vignon, ''Deverberie &amp; Cie: Drawings, Models, and Works in Bronze'' (2003): p. 170. Cleveland Studies in the History of Art. Vol. 8]&lt;/ref&gt; Artisans still benefited from pre-Revolution training and worked according to the standards of a luxury art from the ancien régime, but they had better means of production and organization. Once freed from the technical constraints, the artists were able to give free rein to their imagination and their fantasy to create a multitude of models.

This coincided in time with the golden age of the decorative bronze using the [[ormolu]] technique, with a whole series of celebrated bronziers creating masterpieces of design, craftsmanship and good taste, one of the most famous being [[Pierre-Philippe Thomire]]. All followed the same basic design, featuring an ancient chariot (two or four wheeled) on top of a rectangular or oblong base made out of bronze or [[marble]], carrying figures of [[classical mythology]] deities, with the majority of them having the dial set into the wheel.

In common with the rest of the [[French Empire mantel clock|French Empire style mantel clocks]] of the period, the allegorical ''pendules au char'' (chariot clocks) also had a meaning, served a political ideology and often exalted moral values:&lt;ref name="artaujourdhui.info"&gt;[http://www.artaujourdhui.info/a5332-the-king-the-emperor-and-the-clock-masterworks-from-the-mobilier-national-at-the-musee-du-temps-in-besancon.html The King, the Emperor and the Clock Masterworks from the Mobilier National at the musée du Temps in Besançon]&lt;/ref&gt; Heroism, bravery, military virtues, love and fidelity, study and encouragement of arts and sciences, etc. They also have an educational power&lt;ref name="artaujourdhui.info"/&gt; with evocative themes and narrative scenes in relief at the base.

Apart from France, in the first quarter of the 19th century, although to a much lesser extent, Empire style chariot clocks were also fabricated in Austria, England and Italy.

===Variety of styles (second half of the 19th century until the present)===

During the second half of the 19th century and early 20th, this type of clock was produced again in France, some were replicas/versions of Empire and Louis XVI style preexisting models, while others were new designs crafted in the style of the day, like Napoleon III, or inspired in styles of the past, such as Louis XV or Rococo.

In the United States, the New Haven clock company produced a model in the early 20th century.

Among the range of models of the French company Berlot-Mussier (they used the trade name ODYV between 1927-1940) there were one in the [[Art Deco]] style with the case made out of [[faience]] they sold in the 1930s.

[[File:North Korea-Pyongyang Embroidery Institute-01.jpg|thumb|At the Pyongyang Embroidery Institute]]
[[File:Pins aus Nordkorea.jpg|thumb|Lapel pins from North Korea]]
The contemporary '''culture of North Korea''' is based on [[traditional Korean culture]], but developed since the establishment of the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea|Democratic People's Republic]] in 1948.

''[[Juche]]'' ideology asserts [[Korea]]'s cultural distinctiveness and creativity as well as the productive powers of the [[Working class|working masses]].&lt;ref name=Savada1994/&gt;

[[Korean art|Art]] in North Korea is primarily didactic; cultural expression serves as an instrument for inculcating ''Juche'' [[ideology]] and the need to continue the struggle for revolution and reunification of the Korean Peninsula. Foreign governments and citizens, especially the Japanese and the Americans, are depicted negatively as imperialists; revolutionary heroes and heroines are seen as saintly figures who act from the purest of motives. The three most consistent themes are martyrdom during the revolutionary struggle (depicted in literature such as ''[[The Sea of Blood]]''), the happiness of the present society, and the genius of the leader.&lt;ref name=Savada1994/&gt;

[[Kim Il-sung]] has been described as a writer of "classical masterpieces" during the anti-Japanese struggle. Novels created under his direction include ''[[The Flower Girl]]'', ''The Sea of Blood'', ''[[The Fate of a Self-Defense Corps Man]]'', and ''[[The Song of Korea]]''; these are considered "prototypes and models of ''Juche'' literature and art." A 1992 newspaper report describes Kim in semi-retirement as writing [[With the Century|his memoirs]]—"a heroic epic dedicated to the freedom and happiness of the people."&lt;ref name=Savada1994/&gt;

The population has little or no exposure to foreign cultural influences apart from performances by song-and-dance groups and other entertainers brought in periodically for limited audiences. These performances, such as the [[Spring Friendship Art Festival]] held annually in April, are designed to show that the peoples of the world, like the North Koreans themselves, love and respect the country's leader. During the 1980s and the early 1990s, the North Korean media gave [[Kim Jong-il]] credit for working ceaselessly to make the country a "kingdom of art" where a cultural renaissance unmatched in other countries was taking place. Indeed, the younger Kim was personally responsible for cultural policy.&lt;ref name=Savada1994/&gt;

[[Pyongyang]] and other large cities offer the broadest selection of cultural expression. "[[Art Propaganda]] squads" travel to production sites in the provinces to perform poetry readings, one-act plays, and songs in order to "congratulate workers on their successes" and "inspire them to greater successes through their artistic agitation." Such squads are prominent in the countryside during the harvest season and whenever "speed battles" to increase productivity are held.&lt;ref name=Savada1994/&gt;

North Korean society and culture through the lens of theater, film, and everyday performance [make up] an ideology-shaping matrix that not only entertains but also essentially organizes and mobilizes society. The socialist culture has had a tremendous influence on daliy life of people in North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kim |first1=Suk-young |title=Illusive Utopia: Theater, Film, and Everyday Performance in North Korea. |journal=University of Michigan Press |date=2010 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guidance and control==
The state and the [[Korean Workers' Party]] control the production of literature and art. In the early 1990s, there was no evidence of any underground anti-regime literary or cultural movements such as the [[samizdat]] in the [[Soviet Union]] or those that exist in the [[People's Republic of China]]. The party exercises control over culture through its [[Propaganda and Agitation Department]] and the [[Culture and Arts Department]] of the KWP's [[Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea|Central Committee]]. The KWP's [[General Federation of Korean Literature and Arts Unions]], the parent body for all literary and artistic organizations, also directs cultural activity.&lt;ref name=Savada1994/&gt; Due to widespread media control, some analysts have characterized North Koreans as ''censorees''.&lt;ref&gt;Kang, Ji-Hae. "Recontextualization of news discourse: A case study of translation of news discourse on North Korea." The translator 13.2 (2007): 219-242.&lt;/ref&gt;
These media of paintings, songs, movies, and mass games not only tell the story of Kim Il-sung as the father of the nation, but also provide guidance on how to behave as "model citizens".&lt;ref name=Kang&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kang |first1=David C. |title=They Think They're Normal: Enduring Questions and New Research on North Korea- A Review Essay |journal=International Security |volume=36 |issue=3 |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural expression==
A central theme of cultural expression is to take the best from the past and discard capitalist elements. Popular, vernacular styles and themes in literature, art, music, and dance are esteemed as expressing the truly unique spirit of the Korean nation. Ethnographers devote much energy to restoring and reintroducing cultural forms that have the proper proletarian or folk spirit and that encourage the development of a collective consciousness. Lively, optimistic musical and choreographic expression are stressed. Group folk dances and choral singing are traditionally practiced in some but not all parts of Korea and were being promoted throughout North Korea in the early 1990s among school and university students. Farmers' musical bands have also been revived.&lt;ref name=Savada1994/&gt;

==Literature, music, and film==
{{Main|North Korean literature|Cinema of North Korea|Music of North Korea}}
[[File:HamhungOpera.jpg|thumb|The [[Hamhŭng]] Grand Theatre, one of the biggest in North Korea, completed in 1984]]

Literature and music are other venues for expressing the country's ideology. Kim Jong-il shows interest or perhaps even obsession with cinema. The North Korean leader reportedly has a huge library of Western and Asian movies. In the 1980s, he even ordered the kidnapping of two South Korean movie-makers and forced them to make films for the North Korean state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kang |first1=David C |title=They Think They're Normal: Enduring Questions and New Research on North Korea-A Review Essay |journal=International Security |date=2011 |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=142–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A series of historical novels—''Pulmyouui yoksa'' (''[[Immortal History]]'')—depict the heroism and tragedy of the preliberation era. The [[Korean War]] is the theme of ''[[Korea Fights]]'' and ''[[The Burning Island (North Korean film)|The Burning Island]]''. Since the late 1970s, five "great revolutionary plays" have been promoted as prototypes of the party's literature: ''[[The Shrine for a Tutelary Deity]]'', a theatrical rendition of ''The Flower Girl'', ''[[Three Men, One Party]]'', ''[[A Letter from a Daughter]]'', and ''Hyolbun mangukhoe'' (''[[Resentment at the World Conference]]'').&lt;ref name=Savada1994/&gt;

[[Korean revolutionary opera]], derived from traditional Korean operas, known as ''ch'angguk'', often utilize variations on Korean [[folk songs]]. Old fairy tales have also been transformed to include revolutionary themes. As part of the party's policy of preserving the best from Korea's past, moreover, premodern vernacular works such as the ''Sasong kibong'' (''[[Encounter of Four Persons]]'') and the ''Ssangch'on kibong'' (''[[Encounter at the Two Rivers]]'') have been reprinted.&lt;ref name=Savada1994/&gt;

Musical compositions include the "[[Song of General Kim Il Sung]]", "Long Life and Good Health to the Leader," and "We Sing of His Benevolent Love"—[[hymns]] that praise the nation's leader. According to a North Korean writer,{{Who|date=July 2010}} "Our musicians have pursued the party's policy of composing orchestral music based on famous songs and folk songs popular among our people and produced numerous instrumental pieces of a new type." This music includes a [[symphony]] based on the theme of ''The Sea of Blood'', which has also been made into a revolutionary opera.&lt;ref name=Savada1994/&gt;

In February 2008, The [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]] became the first U.S. orchestra [[2008 New York Philharmonic visit to North Korea|to perform in North Korea]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/02/26/nyphilharmonic.nkorea/index.html |title=Americans in Pyongyang Perform |accessdate=26 February 2008 |work=CNN | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080227042528/http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/02/26/nyphilharmonic.nkorea/index.html| archivedate = 27 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; albeit for a handpicked "invited audience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ben-rosen/letter-from-north-korea-_b_88413.html |title=Letter From North Korea – Update |accessdate=1 December 2008 |author=Ben Rosen |work=Huffington Post |date=25 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concert was broadcast on national television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKSEO3031620080226 |title=Musical diplomacy as New York Phil plays Pyongyang| publisher=Reuters| date=26 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Christian rock]] band [[Casting Crowns]] played at the annual Spring Friendship Arts Festival in April 2007, held in Pyongyang.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cmspin.com/newsmanager/anmviewer.asp?a=4222&amp;z=26 |title=Casting Crowns Performs in North Korea |accessdate=16 November 2010 |work=CMSpin |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228133518/http://www.cmspin.com/newsmanager/anmviewer.asp?a=4222&amp;z=26 |archivedate=28 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Film|Motion pictures]] are recognized as "the most powerful medium for educating the masses" and play a central role in social education. According to a North Korean source, "films for children contribute to the formation of the rising generation, with a view to creating a new kind of man, harmoniously evolved and equipped with well-founded knowledge and a sound mind in a sound body." One of the most influential films, ''[[An Jung-geun Shoots Ito Hirobumi]]'', tells of the assassin who killed the Japanese resident-general in Korea in 1909. An is depicted as a courageous patriot, but one whose efforts to liberate Korea were frustrated because the masses had not been united under "[[Kim Il-sung|an outstanding leader who enunciates a correct guiding thought and scientific strategy and tactics.]]" Folk tales such as "[[The Tale of Chun Hyang]]", about a nobleman who marries a servant girl, and "The Tale of [[On Dal]]" have also been made into films.&lt;ref name=Savada1994/&gt;

Australian filmmaker [[Anna Broinowski]] gained access to North Korea's film industry through British filmmaker Nick Bonner, who facilitated meetings between Broinowski and prominent North Korean filmmakers to assist Broinowski with the production of ''[[Aim High in Creation!]]'', a film project based on [[On the Art of the Cinema|Kim Jong-il's manifesto]]. Broinowski explained in July 2013, prior to the screening of the film at the [[Melbourne International Film Festival]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A friend gave me Kim Jong Il's manifesto on how to make the 'perfect socialist film', The Cinema and Directing (1987). I was immediately fascinated by his often counter-intuitive (for a Westerner at least) filmmaking rules. And I began to wonder: what would a film by Westerners, strictly adhering to Kim Jong Il's rules, be like? Could it have the same power over western audiences that North Korean films have over Kim Jong Il's 23 million citizens? ... I wanted to humanise the North Koreans in the minds of viewers constantly bombarded by the mainstream Western media's depiction of North Koreans as victimised, brainwashed automatons.&lt;ref name="Anna"&gt;{{cite web|title=Q&amp;A with Anna Broinowski (Aim High in Creation!)|url=http://miff.com.au/annabroinowski|work=Melbourne International Film Festival|publisher=Melbourne International Film Festival|accessdate=29 July 2013|date=July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806030902/http://miff.com.au/annabroinowski|archivedate=6 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A version of Broinowski's work was screened in Pyongyang, but the director believes that the documentary version of the film will not be allowed into the country.&lt;ref name="Anna" /&gt;

A study commissioned by the [[United States Department of State|U. S.

==Visual arts==
Historically, graphic design in North Korea was influenced by the [[Soviet bloc]] and by Korean tradition. It has tended to use a "Korean palette" of bright colours. In around 2005, digital design replaced hand-drawn graphics, and the Western influence became stronger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nknews.org/2017/10/made-in-north-korea-dprk-graphics-from-candy-to-postcards|title="Made in North Korea"": DPRK graphics, from candy to postcards|author=Dagyum Ji|publisher=NK News|date=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ryugyong Hotel 4 Sep 2011.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The incomplete [[Ryugyong Hotel]] in 2011.]]
The most distinct and impressive form of contemporary cultural expression in North Korea is architecture and city planning. [[Pyongyang|P'yongyang]], almost completely destroyed by the [[United States]] during the [[Korean War]], has been rebuilt on a grand scale. Many new buildings have been constructed during the 1980s and 1990s in order to enhance P'yongyang's status as a capital.&lt;ref name=Savada1994/&gt;

Major structures are divided architecturally into three categories: monuments, buildings that combine traditional Korean architectural motifs and modern construction, and high-rise buildings of a modern design. Examples of the first include the [[Chollima|Ch'ollima]] Statue; a twenty-meter high bronze statue of Kim Il-sung in front of the [[Museum of the Korean Revolution]] (itself, at 240,000 square meters, one of the largest structures in the world); the [[Arch of Triumph (Pyongyang)|Arch of Triumph]] (similar to [[Arc de Triomphe|its Parisian counterpart]], although a full ten meters higher); and [[Juche Tower|Chuch'e Tower]], 170 meters high, built on the occasion of Kim's seventieth [[Day of the Sun|birthday]] in 1982.&lt;ref name=Savada1994/&gt;

The second architectural category makes special use of traditional tiled roof designs and includes the [[People's Culture Palace]] and the [[Grand People's Study House]], both in P'yongyang, and the [[International Friendship Exhibition Hall]] at [[Myohyang-san]]. The latter building displays gifts given to Kim Il-sung by foreign dignitaries. In light of North Korea's current close relationship to China, and during the [[Choson Dynasty]], it is significant that the section of the hall devoted to gifts from China is the largest.&lt;ref name=Savada1994/&gt;

The third architectural category includes high-rise apartment complexes and hotels in the capital. The most striking of these buildings is the [[Ryugyong Hotel]], unfinished as of now (with construction halted from 1992 - April 2008). Described as one of the world's tallest hotel at 105 stories, its triangular shape looms over north-central P'yongyang. The [[Koryo Hotel]] is an ultramodern, twin-towered structure forty-five stories high.&lt;ref name=Savada1994/&gt;

Much construction occurred before celebrations of Kim Il-sung's eightieth birthday, including the building of grand apartment complexes and the [[Reunification Highway]], a four-lane road connecting the capital and the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|Demilitarized Zone]]. According to a journalist writing in the ''Far Eastern Economic Review'', the highway is "an impressive piece of engineering" that "cuts a straight path through mountainous terrain with 21 tunnels and 23 bridges on the 168 kilometers route to P'anmunjm." As in many other construction projects, the military provided the labor.&lt;ref name=Savada1994&gt;{{Loc|article=''North Korea: A Country Study''|url=https://archive.org/details/PAM550-81 |author=Savada, Andreas Matles, ed. (1994) |accessdate=27 July 2013}} Fourth ed. Washington: Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress. {{ISBN|0-8444-0794-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; North Korea has stated its hope that upon eventual reunification the highway will carry back-and-forth traffic.

==Mass games==

North Korea is famous for its "[[mass games]]". Mass games are the culminating annual celebrations of the state leader's birthdays and the rituals commemorating the foundation of the state: On the birthdays of Kim Il-sung (April 15, 1912), the founding father of North Korea, and [[Kim Jong-il]] (born February 16, 1942, the former leader of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kim |first1=Suk-Young |title=Illusive Utopia: Theater, Film, and Everyday Performance in North Korea |journal=University of Michigan press |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These are exhibitions where thousands of North Koreans perform highly choreographed dances, especially traditional dances and gymnastics, often engaging in simultaneous rhythms of movement. The performers sing and chant their loyalties to Kim il-sung, the KWP, and to the principle of Juche.

The "business case for '''diversity'''" stems from the progression of the models of diversity within the workplace since the 1960s. The original model for diversity was situated around affirmative action drawing strength from the law and a need to comply with [[equal opportunity employment]] objectives. This compliance-based model gave rise to the idea that [[tokenism]] was the reason an individual was hired into a company when they differed from the dominant group.

The social justice model evolved next and extended the idea that individuals outside the dominant group should be given opportunities within the workplace, not only because it was instituted as a law, but because it was the right thing to do. Kevin Sullivan an ex-vice president of Apple Inc. said that "diversity initiatives must be sold as business, not social work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jean Helms-Mills|author2=Kelly Dye|author3=Albert J Mills|title=Understanding Organizational Change|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OpsiOSigPJ8C&amp;pg=PA162|date=10 September 2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-25316-6|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model still revolved around the idea of tokenism, but it also brought in the notion of hiring based on a "good fit".

In the deficit model, it is believed that organizations that do not have a strong diversity inclusion culture will invite lower productivity, higher [[absenteeism]], and higher [[Turnover (employment)|turnover]] which will result in higher costs to the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harvey|first=Carol P.|title=Understanding and Managing Diversity|year=2012|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|location=New Jersey|isbn=0-13-255311-2|pages=51–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification of workplaces==

In a journal article entitled "The multicultural organization" by Taylor Cox, Jr., Cox talks about three organization types that focus on the development of cultural diversity. The three types are: the monolithic organization, the plural organization, and the multicultural organization. In the monolithic organization, the amount of structural integration (the presence of persons from different cultural groups in a single organization) is minimal. This type of organization may have minority members within the workforce, but not in positions of leadership and power.&lt;ref name="Cox 1991"&gt;Cox, Jr., Taylor (1991). "The Multicultural Organization".  ''Academy of Management Executive, 5''(2), 34-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plural organization has a more heterogeneous membership than the monolithic organization and takes steps to be more inclusive of persons from cultural backgrounds that differ from the dominant group. This type of organization seeks to empower those from a [[marginalized]] standpoint to encourage opportunities for [[Promotion (rank)|promotion]] and positions of [[leadership]].&lt;ref name="Cox 1991"/&gt;

The workplace diversity can be categorized into single-gender and mix genders.  The study from Joseph and Selvaraj (2015), found out the organization with different genders can provide a better performance than the single-gender workplace environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=R|first=Darwin Joseph|last2=Selvaraj|first2=Palanisamy Chinnathambi|date=2015-02-20|title=The Effects of Work Force Diversity on Employee Performance in Singapore Organisations|url=http://www.sciedu.ca/journal/index.php/ijba/article/view/6528|journal=International Journal of Business Administration|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|pages=17|doi=10.5430/ijba.v6n2p17|issn=1923-4015}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Gender diversity]] turns into a discussion topic to study. 

The multicultural organization not only contains many different cultural groups or different genders, but it values this diversity. It encourages healthy conflict as a source of avoiding groupthink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harvey|first=Carol P.|title=Understanding and Managing Diversity|year=2012|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|location=New Jersey|isbn=0-13-255311-2|pages=41–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of leadership==
A study of successful multicultural organizations (as opposed to monolithic and plural organizations) can be understood{{by whom|date=May 2017}} by applying theories of [[leadership]] which have evolved over time. [[Trait leadership|Trait-leadership]] theory suggests that leadership is dependent on physical and social attributes of the individual and greatly based on European cultures.&lt;ref name=Eisenberg&gt;{{cite book|last= Eisenberg|first= Eric M.|title= Organizational Communication|year= 2010|publisher= Bedford|location= St. Martin's|isbn= 978-0-312-57486-4|pages= 250–58|edition= 6th|author2= H.L. Goodall, Jr. |author3= Angela Trethewey}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Situational leadership theory|Situational leadership]], where the balance of managing relationship behavior and the tasks at hand,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Center for Leadership Studies, Inc.|url=  http://www.situational.com|accessdate= 14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; underscore multicultural organizations.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The combination of "[[transformational leadership]]" and "discursive leadership" allows and encourages mid-level managers to use diversity as an influential resource in order to enhance organizational effectiveness. In the ''Journal of Applied Behavioral Science,'' C.L. Walck defines managing diversity in the workplace as "Negotiating interaction across culturally diverse groups, and contriving to get along in an environment characterized by cultural diversity".&lt;ref&gt;
Walck, C.L. (1995). Editor's introduction: "Diverse approaches to managing diversity". ''Journal of Applied Behavioral Science,'' 31, 119-23).
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
On one hand, there is a genuine lack of documented evidence for the claimed benefits to the organization and the individual.

On the other hand, advocates of diversity claim (without presenting evidence) that diversity will bring substantial potential benefits such as better decision making and improved problem solving, greater creativity and innovation, which leads to enhanced product development, and more successful marketing to different types of customers.&lt;ref name="Cox 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harvey&gt;{{cite book|last=Harvey|first=Carol P.|title=Understanding and Managing Diversity|year=2012|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|location=New Jersey|isbn=0-13-255311-2|pages=xii-393|edition=5th|author2=M. June Allard}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also claimed that diversity provides organizations with the ability to compete in global markets.&lt;ref name="Fine, Marlene G. 1996"&gt;Fine, Marlene G. (1996). "Cultural Diversity in the Workplace: The State of the Field". ''Journal of Business Communication, 33''(4), 485-502.&lt;/ref&gt; Simply recognizing diversity in a corporation is also said to help link the variety of talents within the organization.&lt;ref&gt;De Pree, Max. ''Leadership is an Art''. New York: Doubleday Business, 1989. print&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://onlinemasters.ohio.edu/public-administration-building-more-diverse-public-organizations-and-businesses/&lt;/ref&gt; The act of recognizing diversity is also said to allow for those employees with these talents to feel needed and have a sense of belonging, which in turn increases their commitment to the company and allows each of them to contribute in a unique way.&lt;ref&gt;De Pree, Max. ''Leadership is an Art''. New York: Doubleday Business, 1989. print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Standpoint theory]] suggests that marginalized groups bring a different perspective to an organization that challenges the status quo since their socially constructed world view will differ from that of the dominant group.&lt;ref name="Allen 1995 143–55"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Brenda J.|title=Diversity and Organizational Communication|journal=Journal of Applied Communication Research|date=September 1995|volume=23|pages=143–55|doi=10.1080/00909889509365420}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the standpoint of the dominant group will often carry more weight, encouraging conflicting standpoints to coexist within an organization which will create a forum for sanctioned conflict to ensue. Standpoint theory gives a voice to those in a position to see patterns of behavior that those immersed in the culture have difficulty acknowledging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Brenda J.|title=Feminist Standpoint Theory: a Black Woman's Review of Organizational Socialization|journal=Communication Studies|date=December 1996|volume=47|issue=4|pages=257–71|doi=10.1080/10510979609368482}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, these unique and varying standpoints help to eradicate [[groupthink]] which can develop within a homogenous group.&lt;ref name=Harvey /&gt;

mathematical modeling research of team work reflects this view. His models demonstrated that heterogeneous teams consistently out-performed homogeneous teams on a variety of tasks. Page points out, however, that diversity in teamwork is not always simple and that there are many challenges to fostering an inclusive environment in the workplace for diversity of thought and ideas.

One of the greatest challenges an organization has when trying to adopt a more inclusive environment is [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] for any member outside the dominant group. The interplay between power, ideology, and discursive acts which reinforce the [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] structure of organizations is the subject of much study.&lt;ref name=Mumby&gt;{{cite book|last=Mumby|first=Dennis|title=Communication and Power in Organizations|year=1988|publisher=Ablex Publishing|location=New York|isbn=978-1-56750-160-5|pages=1–210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everything from organizational symbols, rituals, and stories serve to maintain the position of power held by the dominant group.&lt;ref name=Mumby /&gt;

When organizations hire or promote individuals that are not part of this dominant group into management positions, a tension develops between the socially constructed organizational norm and acceptance of cultural diversity. Often these individuals are mentored and coached to adopt the necessary traits for inclusion into the privileged group as opposed to being embraced for their differences.&lt;ref name=Harvey /&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen 1995 143–55"/&gt; According to the journal article "Cultural Diversity in the Workplace: The State of the Field", Marlene G. Fine explains that "those who assimilate are denied the ability to express their genuine selves in the workplace; they are forced to repress significant parts of their lives within a social context that frames a large part of their daily encounters with other people". Fine goes on to mention that "People who spend significant amounts of energy coping with an alien environment have less energy left to do their jobs. Assimilation does not just create a situation in which people who are different are likely to fail, it also decreases the productivity of organizations".&lt;ref name="Fine, Marlene G. 1996"/&gt; That is, with a diverse workforce, management may have to work harder to reach the same level of productivity as with a less diverse workforce.

Another challenge faced by organizations striving to foster a more diverse workforce is the management of a diverse population. Managing diversity is more than simply acknowledging differences in people.&lt;ref&gt;

A major challenge is miscommunication within an organization. Fine reported a study of "work groups that were culturally diverse and found that cross-cultural differences led to miscommunication".&lt;ref&gt;p. 494. Fine, Marlene G. (1996). "Cultural Diversity in the Workplace: The State of the Field". ''Journal of Business Communication, 33''(4), 485-502.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, a diverse workforce led to challenges for management. The meaning of a message can never be completely shared because no two individuals experience events in exactly the same way. Even when native and non-native speakers are exposed to the same messages, they may interpret the information differently.&lt;ref name="Brownell, Judi 2003"&gt;Brownell, Judi (2003). "Developing Receiver-Centered Communication in Diverse Organizations". ''Listening Professional, 2''(1), 5-25&lt;/ref&gt; There are competencies, however, which help to develop effective communication in diverse organizational environments. These skills include [[self-monitoring]], [[empathy]], and strategic decision-making.

Maintaining a culture which supports the idea of [[employee voice]] (especially for marginalized group members) is another challenge for diverse organisation. When the organizational environment is not supportive of dissenting viewpoints, employees may choose to remain silent for fear of repercussions,&lt;ref name="Milliken 2003 1453–76"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milliken|first=Frances J. |author2=Elizabeth W.

==Strategies to achieve diversity==
Three approaches towards corporate diversity management can be distinguished: Liberal Change, Radical Change, and Transformational Change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tatli|first=Ahu|author2=M. Ozbilgin|title=Understanding Diversity Managers' Role in Organizational Change: Towards a Conceptual Framework|journal=Canadian Journal of Administrative Sciences|date=22 July 2009|volume=26|pages=244–58|doi=10.1002/CJAS.107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberal change===
The liberal concept recognizes equality of opportunity in practice when all individuals are enabled freely and equally to compete for social rewards. The aim of the liberal change model is to have a fair [[labor market]] from which the best person is chosen for a job based solely on performance. To support this concept, a framework of formal rules has been created and policymakers are responsible for ensuring that these rules are enforced on all so none shall be [[Discrimination|discriminated]] against. The liberal-change approach centers on law, compliance, and legal penalties for non-compliance.

One weakness of the liberal view is that the formal rules cannot cover every aspect of work life, as there is almost always an informal aspect to work such as [[affinity group]]s, hidden transcripts, and alternative informal communication channels.&lt;ref&gt;Jewson, Nick; Mason, David. ''Sociological Review'', May 1986, Vol. 34 Issue 2, p307-34, 28p&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cynthia Cockburn 1989"&gt;Cynthia Cockburn, 1989, "Equal Opportunities: the short and long agenda", ''Industrial Relations Journal'', 20 (3): 213-25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radical changes===
In contrast to the liberal approach, radical change seeks to intervene directly in the workplace practices in order to achieve balanced workforces, as well as a fair distribution of rewards among employees. The radical approach is thus more outcome focused than focused on the forming the rules to ensure equal treatment.&lt;ref name="Cynthia Cockburn 1989"/&gt; One major tool of radical change is quotas which are set by companies or national institutions with the aim to regulate diversity of the workforce and equal opportunities.

Arguments for and against quota systems in companies or public institutions include contrasting ideas such as quotas
* compensating for actual barriers that prevent marginalized members from attaining their fair share of managerial positions
* being against equal opportunity for all and imply that a marginalized member only got the position to fill the quota.&lt;ref&gt;N. Jewson and D. Mason, 1986, "The theory of equal opportunity policies: liberal and radical approaches", ''Sociological Review'', 34 (2)&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden’s quota system for parliamentary positions is a positive case for radical change through quota setting.&lt;ref&gt;"Increasing Women’s Political Representation: New Trends in Gender Quotas", in Ballington and Karam, eds. ''International IDEA. 2005: Women in Parliament.  Beyond Numbers'' (revised edition) and Drude Dahlerup, ed., ''Women, Quotas and Politics''. Routledge 2006 7Drude Dahlerup &amp; Lenita Freidenvall, "Gender Quotas in politics — A Constitutional Challenge", in Susan H. Williams, ed., ''Constituting Equality. Gender Equality and Comparative Constitutional Law''. Cambridge University Press 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 
A quota system was introduced at the Swedish parliament with the aim of ensuring that women constitute at least a ‘critical minority’ of 30 or 40 percent of all parliament seats. Since the introduction of the system, women representation in parliament has risen dramatically even above the defined quota. Today, 47% of parliamentary representatives are women, a number which stands out compared to the global average of 19%.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===Transformational change===
Transformational change covers an equal opportunity agenda for both the immediate need as well as long-term solutions.&lt;ref&gt;C. Cockburn, 1989, "Equal Opportunities: the short and long agenda", ''Industrial Relations Journal'', 20 (3): 213-25&lt;/ref&gt; For the short term it implements new measures to minimize bias in procedures such as [[recruitment]], promotion, and [[Bias-free communication|communication]]. The long term, however, is seen as a project of transformation for organizations. This approach acknowledges the existence of power systems and seeks to challenge the existing hegemony through implementation of equality values.

One illustrative case for transformational change is ageing management;&lt;ref&gt;V. Pahl, "Altern und Arbeit – Chancengleichheit für alle Altersgruppen", in C. von Rothkirch, ''Altern und Arbeit: Herausforderung für Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft'', Sigma Rainer Bohn Verlag, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Younger employees are seen as more innovative and flexible, while older employees are associated with higher costs of [[salary]], [[Employee benefit|benefits]], and healthcare needs.&lt;ref&gt;L. Brooke, "Human resource costs and benefits of maintaining a mature-age workforce", ''International Journal of Manpower'', 24 (3): 260-83&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, companies may prefer young workers to older staff. Through application of the transformational concept an immediate intervention provides needed relief while a longer-term culture shift occurs.

For the short-term, an organization can set up legislation preventing [[Ageism|discrimination based on age]] (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[Age Discrimination in Employment Act]]). However, for the long-term solution, negative stereotypes of older employees needs to be replaced with the positive realization that older employees can add value to the workplace through their experience and knowledge base.&lt;ref&gt;J. Ilmarinen, "Die Arbeitsfähigkeit kann mit dem Alter steigen", in C. von Rothkirch, ''Altern und Arbeit: Herausforderungen für Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft'', Sigma Rainer Bohn Verlag, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; To balance this idea with the benefit of innovation and flexibility that comes with youth, a mixture of ages in the workforce is ideal.&lt;ref&gt;R. Guest &amp; K. Shacklock, "The impending shift to an older mix of workers: perspectives from the management and economics literature", ''International Journal of Organisational Behaviour'', 10 (3): 713-728&lt;/ref&gt; Through transformational change, the short-term solution affords the organization the time necessary to enact deep rooted culture changes leading to a more inclusive environment.

== Implementation ==
Intentional "diversity programs" can assist organisations facing rapid demographic changes in their local consumer market and labor pool by helping people work and understand one other better.&lt;ref name=Harvey /&gt; Resources exist through best practice cases of organizations that have successfully created inclusive environments supporting and championing diversity. An example such resources is MentorNet,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mentornet.net&lt;/ref&gt; a nonprofit online mentoring organization that focuses on women and under-represented minorities in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields.

Implementing diversity inclusion initiatives must start with the commitment from the top. With a commitment from top leaders in an organization to change the existing culture to one of diversity inclusion, the diversity change management process can succeed. This process includes analyzing where the organization is currently at through a diversity audit, creating a strategic action plan, gaining support by seeking stakeholder input, and holding individuals accountable through [[Performance measurement|measurable results]].&lt;ref name=Harvey /&gt;

A '''dress''' (also known as a '''[[frock]]''' or a '''[[gown]]''') is a garment consisting of a [[skirt]] with an attached [[bodice]] (or a matching bodice giving the effect of a one-piece garment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Condra|first1=Jill|title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Clothing Through World History: 1801 to the present|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313336652|page=59|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=q6FI2czFz6MC&amp;pg=PA59|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of a top piece that covers the torso and hangs down over the legs. A dress can be any one-piece garment containing a skirt of any length. Dresses can be formal or informal. In many cultures, dresses are more often worn by women and girls.

The [[hemline]]s of dresses vary depending on the [[fashion]] of the time period and the [[modesty]] or personal taste of the wearer.&lt;ref name="Davis2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Michael|title=Art of dress designing|year=2007|publisher=Global Media|location=Delhi|isbn=81-904575-7-8|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== About ==
Dresses are outer garments made up of a [[bodice]] and a [[skirt]] and can be made in one or more pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/dress|title=The definition of dress|last=|first=|date=|website=Dictionary.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Picken|1957|p=101}} Dresses are generally suitable for both general and [[formal wear]] in the West for women and children.{{Sfn|Picken|1957|p=101}}

Historically, dresses could also include other items of clothing such as [[corset]]s, [[kirtle]]s, [[partlet]]s, [[petticoat]]s, smocks and [[stomacher]]s.{{Sfn|Edwards|2017|p=20}}{{Sfn|Cunningham|2003|p=20}}{{Sfn|Edwards|2017|p=30}}

==History==

=== 11th century ===
In the 11th century, women in [[Europe]] wore dresses that were similar to men's tunics and were loose, with a hemline reaching to below the knees or lower.{{Sfn|Newman|2001|p=113}} By the end of the century, these dresses featured a tighter fit on the arms and women's upper bodies.{{Sfn|Newman|2001|p=113}} Dresses were made snug by featuring slits on the sides of the dress that were pulled tight in order to fit a woman's figure.{{Sfn|Newman|2001|p=114}}

=== 16th century ===
Starting in the 1550s, middle- and upper-class women in Europe wore dresses which included a smock, stays, [[kirtle]], [[gown]], forepart, sleeves, ruff and a [[partlet]].{{Sfn|Edwards|2017|p=20}} Undergarments were not worn underneath.{{Sfn|Edwards|2017|p=20}} In England, [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] dictated what kinds of dresses women were allowed to wear.{{Sfn|Edwards|2017|p=21}} French women were inspired by Spanish-style [[bodice]]s and also wore [[Ruff (clothing)|ruffs]].{{Sfn|Edwards|2017|p=21}} French dresses were known as ''marlottes''.{{Sfn|Bigelow|1970|p=110}} In Italy, dresses were known as ''ropa'' and ''semarra.''{{Sfn|Bigelow|1970|p=110}} Dresses in the 16th century also displayed surface decoration such as [[embroidery]], with [[blackwork]] being especially popular.{{Sfn|Edwards|2017|p=23}}

Women's dresses in [[Russia]] during both the 16th and 17th centuries identified a woman's place in society or their family.{{Sfn|Pushkareva|1997|p=120}}

=== 17th century ===
[[Holland]], as a center of textile production, was a particularly noted area of innovation in dress during this time period.{{Sfn|Edwards|2017|p=30}} During this time period, in Spain and Portugal, women wore [[stomacher]]s.{{Sfn|Edwards|2017|p=30}} However, in England and France, dresses became more "naturally" shaped.{{Sfn|Edwards|2017|p=30}} Lace and slashing were popular decorations.{{Sfn|Edwards|2017|p=30}} Skirts were full, with regular folds and the overskirt allowed the display of an underskirt of contrasting fabric.{{Sfn|Edwards|2017|p=30}} Necklines became lower as well.{{Sfn|Edwards|2017|p=30}} Embroidery that reflected scientific discoveries, such as new animals and plants discovered were popular.{{Sfn|Edwards|2017|p=34}} In the [[British colonization of the Americas|British Colonies]], the multiple-piece dresses were also popular, though less luxurious.{{Sfn|Staples|Shaw|2013|p=222}} Wealthy women living in the Spanish or Dutch colonies in the Americas copied the fashions that were popular from their homelands.{{Sfn|Havelin|2012|p=27}}

The three-piece dress, which had a bodice, petticoat and gown, were popular until the last 25 years, in which the [[Mantua (clothing)|mantua]], or a one-piece gown, became more popular.{{Sfn|Edwards|2017|p=35}} [[Corset]]s became more important in dresses by the 1680s.{{Sfn|Bigelow|1970|p=126}}

Working women, and women in [[Slavery in the United States|slavery in the Americas]], used simple patterns to create shifts, wool or linen petticoats and gowns and cotton dresses.{{Sfn|Havelin|2012|p=26}} The bottoms of the skirts could be tucked into the waistband when a woman was near fire when near a cooking or heating source.{{Sfn|Havelin|2012|p=26}}

=== 18th century ===
[[File:Vestido,_Século_XIX_(1870-80),_MN_Traje.tif|thumb|Dress, (1870-1880) from the [[National Museum of Costume and Fashion]] in Portugal.]]
Large, triangular silhouettes were favored during the 18th century, skirts were wide and supported by hoop underskirts.{{Sfn|Bigelow|1970|p=135}}{{Sfn|Bigelow|1970|p=137}} One-piece gowns remained popular until the middle of the century.{{Sfn|Edwards|2017|p=49}} During the 1760s in France, hoop petticoats were reduced in size.{{Sfn|Pietsch|2013|p=400}} Lighter colors and lighter fabrics were also favored.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=funk&amp;AN=CO225700&amp;site=ehost-live|title=Funk &amp; Wagnalls New World Encyclopedia|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Costume|subscription=yes|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Colonial America, women most often wore a gown and petticoat, in which the skirt of the gown opened to reveal the [[petticoat]] underneath.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.org/history/clothing/women/wglossary.cfm|title=A Colonial Lady's Clothing: A Glossary of Terms|last=|first=|date=|website=Colonial Williamsburg|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women also had [[riding habit]]s which consisted of the petticoat, jacket and a waistcoat.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

French fashion regarding dresses became very fast-changing during the later part of the 18th century.{{Sfn|Pietsch|2013|p=397-398}} Throughout this period, the length of fashionable dresses varied only slightly, between ankle-length and floor-sweeping.&lt;ref name="Davis2007" /&gt; Between 1740 and 1770, the ''[[Sack-back gown|robe à la française]]'' was very popular with upper-class women.{{Sfn|Delpierre|1997|p=15-16}} In France, the [[Empire style]] became popular after the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.makers.com/blog/brief-history-womens-fashion-photo-gallery|title=A Brief History of Women's Fashion|last=|first=|date=7 September 2016|work=Makers|access-date=2018-01-24|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style was more simple and was also favored by [[Empress Joséphine|Josephine Bonaparte]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other types of dresses that were popular during the revolution included tunic dresses and the ''negligée à la patriot,'' which featured the red, white and blue colors, symbolic of the revolution.{{Sfn|Bigelow|1970|p=157}}

===19th century===
[[File:Dress_(AM_11988-3).jpg|alt=Early 19th century dress.|left|thumb|Early 19th century dress.]]
Women's dresses in the 19th century began to be classified by the time of day or purpose of the dress.{{Sfn|Bigelow|1970|p=183}} High-waisted dresses were popular until around 1830.{{Sfn|Bigelow|1970|p=183}}

Early nineteenth century dresses in Russia were influenced by [[Classicism]] and were made of thin fabrics, with some dresses being semi-transparent.{{Sfn|Pushkareva|1997|p=242}} [[Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun|Elizabeth Vigée Le Brun]] wore these types of dresses with a short skirt (reaching to her ankles) when she lived in Russia between 1785 and 1801.{{Sfn|Pushkareva|1997|p=242}} Many Russian women copied her style.{{Sfn|Pushkareva|1997|p=242}} By the 1840s, Russian women were turning to what was in fashion in Europe.{{Sfn|Pushkareva|1997|p=244}}

Europeans styles in dresses increased dramatically to the [[hoopskirt]] and [[crinoline]]-supported styles of the 1860s,{{Sfn|Krohn|2012|p=36}} then fullness was draped and drawn to the back.{{Sfn|Bigelow|1970|p=188}} Dresses had a "day" bodice with a high [[neckline]] and long sleeves, and an "evening" bodice with a low neckline ([[decollete]]) and very short sleeves. In Russia, metal hoopskirts were known as "malakhovs."{{Sfn|Pushkareva|1997|p=244}} Skirts of the 1860s were heavily decorated.{{Sfn|Bigelow|1970|p=188}}

To sleep, women in the American West wore floor-length dresses of white [[cotton]] with high collars displaying decoration.{{Sfn|Krohn|2012|p=37}} Various [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] people, such as the [[Navajo]] and the [[Mescalero|Mescalero Apache]] began to adapt the designs of their dresses to look more like the European Americans they came in contact with.{{Sfn|Parezo|Jones|2009|p=384}} Navajo women further adapted the European designs, incorporating their own sense of beauty, "creating ''hózhó."''{{Sfn|Parezo|Jones|2009|p=384-385}}

Paper [[Pattern (sewing)|sewing patterns]] for women to sew their own dresses started to be readily available in the 1860s, when the [[Butterick Publishing Company]] began to promote them.{{Sfn|Darnell|2000|p=27}} These patterns were graded by size, which was a new innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://butterick.mccall.com/our-company/butterick-history|title=Butterick History|last=|first=|date=|website=Butterick Patterns|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Victorian era|Victorian era's]] dresses were tight-fitting and decorated with pleats, [[Gather (knitting)|rouching]] and frills.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Women in the United States who were involved in [[Victorian dress reform|dress reform]] in the 1850s found themselves the center of attention, both positive and negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oIro7MtiFuYC&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;pg=PA72&amp;q=women's%20dress%20history|title=Encyclopedia of Women's History in America|last=Cullen-DuPont|first=Kathryn|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2014|isbn=9781438110332|location=|pages=71–72|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1881, the [[Rational Dress Society]] had formed in reaction to the restrictive dress of the era.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===20th century===

In the early twentieth century, the look popularized by the [[Gibson Girl]] was fashionable.{{Sfn|Darnell|2000|p=9}} The upper part of women's dresses in the [[Edwardian era]] included a "pigeon breast" look that gave way to a corseted waist and an s-shaped silhouette.{{Sfn|Darnell|2000|p=9}} Women called their dresses "waists" if one-piece, or "[[Shirtdress|shirtwaists]]," if it consisted of a skirt and a blouse.{{Sfn|Darnell|2000|p=11}} The bodice of the dresses had a boned lining.{{Sfn|Darnell|2000|p=11}} Informally, wealthy women wore [[tea gown]]s at home.{{Sfn|Darnell|2000|p=13}} These garments were looser, though not as loose as a "wrapper," and made of expensive fabric and laces.{{Sfn|Darnell|2000|p=13}}

By 1910, the Edwardian look was replaced with a straighter silhouette.{{Sfn|Darnell|2000|p=49}} French designer, [[Paul Poiret]], had a huge impact on the look of the time.{{Sfn|Darnell|2000|p=49}} Designs developed by Poiret were available in both boutiques and also in [[department store]]s.{{Sfn|Darnell|2000|p=50}} Popular dresses of the time were one-piece and included [[lingerie dress]]es which could be layered.{{Sfn|Darnell|2000|p=53}} At around the same time, in the United States, the [[American Ladies Tailors' Association]] developed a dress called the [[suffragette suit]], which was practical for women to work and move around in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://onlinemba.unc.edu/blog/Feminist-History-in-Womens-Work-Suits/|title=100 Years of Feminist History Explained in 10 Women’s Work Suits|last=Greenberg|first=Molly|date=2017-03-01|work=UNC|access-date=2018-01-24|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mariefranceasia.com/my/fashion-my/trends-and-tips-my/trend-guide-my/history-of-pantsuit-218771.html#item=1|title=The fascinating history and evolution of the female pantsuit|last=Khan|first=Sarah|date=2016-11-16|work=Marie France Asia|access-date=2018-01-24|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another innovation of the 1910s was the ready availability of factory-made clothing.{{Sfn|Richards|2010|p=100}}

Waistlines started out high and by 1915 were below the natural waist.{{Sfn|Darnell|2000|p=53}} By 1920, waistlines were at hip-level.{{Sfn|Darnell|2000|p=53}} Between 1910 and 1920 necklines were lower and dresses could be short-sleeved or sleeveless.{{Sfn|Darnell|2000|p=57}} Women who worked during [[World War I]] preferred shorter dresses, which eventually became the dominant style overall.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition to the shorter dresses, waistlines were looser and the dominant colors were black, white and gray.{{Sfn|Richards|2010|p=100-101}}

By 1920, the "new woman" was a trend that saw lighter fabrics and dresses that were easier to put on.{{Sfn|Darnell|2000|p=73}} Younger women were also setting the trends that older women started to follow.{{Sfn|Darnell|2000|p=73}} The dresses of the 1920s could be pulled over the head, were short and straight.{{Sfn|Darnell|2000|p=77}} It was acceptable to wear sleeveless dresses during the day.{{Sfn|Darnell|2000|p=77}} [[Flapper]] dresses were popular until end of the decade.{{Sfn|Darnell|2000|p=105}}

During [[World War II]], dresses were slimmer and inspired by military uniforms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After WWII, the New Look, promoted by [[Christian Dior]] was very influential on fashion and the look of women's dresses for about a decade.{{Sfn|Parezo|Jones|2009|p=383}}

Since the 1970s, no one dress type or length has dominated fashion for long, with short and ankle-length styles often appearing side-by-side in fashion magazines and catalogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://womenshistorynetwork.org/blog/?p=2804|title=The History of Hemlines|date=2013-09-01|work=Women's History Network|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
{{Western dress codes}}
In most varieties of [[formal wear|formal]] [[dress code (Western)|dress codes]] in Western cultures, a dress of an appropriate style is mandatory for women. They are also very popular for special occasions such as [[prom]]s or [[wedding]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pundir|first=Nirupama|title=Fashion technology : today and tomorrow|year=2007|publisher=Mittal Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-8324-203-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; For such occasions they, together with [[blouse]] and [[skirt]], remain the de facto standard attire for many girls and women.

{{Anthropology}}
'''Ethnography at the British Museum''' describes how [[ethnography]] has developed at the [[British Museum]].

==Within the Department of Natural History and Curiosities==
The ethnographical collection was originally linked to the Department of Natural History and Curiosities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anthropology.ac.uk/Era_Resources/Era/Pitt_Rivers/musantob/histmus6.html Pitt Rivers' attitude to the British Museum] W. Chapman's unpublished D.Phil thesis, accessed 21 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The addition of material gathered by Captain [[James Cook]] and his companions between 1767 and 1780, and presented to the British Museum by the [[Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty]], Cook himself and [[Joseph Banks]], were a substantial addition to the material previously collected by Sir [[Hans Sloane]]. But much of this collection was dispersed. Some material found its way to [[Göttingen]],&lt;ref&gt;'History of Ethnography in the Museum after 1753 (pt1)' by HJ Braunholtz, ''The British Museum Quarterly'', 1953&lt;/ref&gt; where [[August Ludwig Schlözer]] was developing his concepts of ''[[Völkerkunde]]'' and ''ethnographie''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.leidenuniv.nl/legacy/vermeulen_summary.pdf  ''Early History of Ethnography and Ethnology in the German Enlightenment: Anthropological Discourse in Europe and Asia, 1710–1808''], PhD Thesis by Han F. Vermeulen, accessed 13 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; However additional material was transferred from the "artificial curiosities" held by the museum of the [[Royal Society]] until 1781. In 1817 this was supplemented by material from [[West Africa]] collected by [[Thomas Edward Bowdich]] during his 'Mission to Ashantee', in 1825 by [[Aztec]] sculptures collected by [[William Bullock (collector)|William Bullock]] in Mexico and Captain [[William Edward Parry]]'s [[Eskimo]] material from his second [[Arctic]] voyage of 1829.&lt;ref&gt;'History of Ethnography in the Museum after 1753 (pt1)' by HJ Braunholtz, ''The British Museum Quarterly'', 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

==Within the Department of Antiquities==
In 1836 the Department of Antiquities was established and the ethnographic collection was transferred there. When [[Christian Jürgensen Thomsen]] visited the British Museum in 1843, he did not hide his disappointment: he was unimpressed ‘by the British antiquities everywhere covered in dust and not much esteemed’ and complained that the artefacts were displayed without indication of their [[provenance]].&lt;ref&gt;''Institutionalising Antiquity: Learned Societies and Museums after 1859'', by David Gaimster available at [http://www.sal.org.uk/newsandevents/evanscommemoration/ Society of Antiquaries website]&lt;/ref&gt; An Ethnological Gallery was opened in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anthropology.ac.uk/Era_Resources/Era/Pitt_Rivers/musantob/histmus6.html Pitt Rivers' attitude to the British Museum] W. Chapman's unpublished D.Phil thesis, accessed 21 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 1851 there were 3,700 artefacts in the ethnographic collection, displayed in a single gallery. In 1852 this consisted of seventy four cases of material from outside Europe: nine containing [[China|Chinese]] and [[India]]n material, 4 [[Africa]]n material, 29 material from the [[Americas]] with remaining 32 cases containing material from [[Oceania]] and [[South East Asia]]. [[Polynesia]] alone accounted for 15 cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anthropology.ac.uk/Era_Resources/Era/Pitt_Rivers/musantob/histmus6.html Non-field Collecting (2): Ethnography in the British Museum] W. Chapman's unpublished D.Phil thesis, accessed 21 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Within the Department of British and Mediaeval Antiquities==
In 1866, the Department of British and Medieval Antiquities was formed under the superintendence of [[Augustus Wollaston Franks]], as Keeper. It included the ethnographic collections. Franks maintained the view that the Museum's collections "should illustrate the manners and customs of such races as have not been subjected directly to European civilisation, so as to furnish the student with the means of examining the affinities and differences between such races and also to reconstruct some of the last pages of the history of the world". ''The Handbook of the Ethnographical Collection'' was published in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/africa,_oceania_and_americas/history_of_the_collection.aspx History of the collection and department], accessed 13 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Department of Ethnography==
The Department of Ethnography was set up as a separate department in 1946. In 1964 the department received 15,000 items from the [[Wellcome Foundation]], the biggest single acquisition from which they ever benefited.&lt;ref&gt;''The Story of the British Museum'' by Marjorie Caygill, British Museum Press, 2nd edition 1992, p4574&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museum of Mankind==
[[File:Museum of Mankind, London, in 1987.jpg|thumb|The Museum of Mankind in 1987]]

From 1970 to 2004 the Department of Ethnography of the British Museum was housed at [[6 Burlington Gardens]], displaying collections from the [[Americas]], [[Africa]], the [[Pacific]] and [[Australia]], as well as [[tribal]] [[Asia]] and [[Europe]]. This was due to lack of space in the Museum's main building in [[Bloomsbury]]. Between 1970 and 1997, the department was known as the Museum of Mankind.  75 exhibitions were hosted, including many famous ones such as ''Nomad and City'' (1976), and ''Living Arctic'' (1987). It was created by Keeper of Ethnography Adrian Digby in the 1960s, and opened by his successor [[William Buller Fagg|William Fagg]]. Fagg was succeeded by Malcolm Mcleod in 1974, and by John Mack in 1990. The museum ceased exhibiting at Burlington Gardens in 1997 and the Department of Ethnography moved back to the British Museum in Bloomsbury in 2004.

'''''F.E.A.R. 3''''' (stylized as '''''F.3.A.R.''''') is a [[first-person shooter]] horror [[video game]] developed by [[Wargaming Chicago-Baltimore|Day 1 Studios]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]]. It is the sequel to ''[[F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin]]'', and the third installment of the [[F.E.A.R. (series)|''F.E.A.R.'' series]]. It was announced on April 8, 2010, and was stated to include [[John Carpenter]] helping on the cinematics as well as writer [[Steve Niles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/04/08/fear-3-announced-john-carpenter-crafting-cinematics|title=F.3.A.R. announced, John Carpenter crafting cinematics|last=Mitchell|first=Richard|date=2010-04-08|publisher=Joystiq|accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the only ''F.E.A.R.'' game to have offline multiplayer, and co-op.&lt;ref name=cn&gt;{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
Players control their characters from a first-person perspective. The player can carry two weapons at a time, and replenish ammo picked up from dead soldiers and weapon crates. The series' [[cover system]] uses a "peeking" rather than a "tilting" mechanic, wherein players peer and fire around the edges of their cover. Damage displays as a red vignette overlay. When the screen fills, the character [[game over|dies]]. In [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] and multiplayer modes, the player enters a "Final Stand" on their death, which lets teammates try to revive the downed player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/108/1082353p1.html|title=F.3.A.R. Approaching|last=Clements|first=Ryan|date=2010-04-08|publisher=IGN|accessdate=13 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campaign===
In the Campaign, the player controls either [[Point Man|the Point Man]] or [[Paxton Fettel]]. As the Point Man, the player can use weapons, throw grenades, etc.&lt;ref name=ignLive_e32010&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgYG2Bx-iwk|title=F.E.A.R. 3 - IGN Live E3 2010|date=17 June 2010|work=[[YouTube]]|publisher=IGN|accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most characters, the player can use the Point Man's slow motion ability to slow down time, allowing the player to shoot targets with accuracy.&lt;ref name=cn /&gt; As Fettel, the player cannot use any conventional weapons by default; however, they can use Fettel's psychic powers and [[telekinesis]] to suspend and throw objects, [[Spirit possession|possess enemy soldiers]], crush suspended enemies, and more.&lt;ref name=ignLive_e32010 /&gt; In addition to these abilities, the player also has access to the abilities and weapons of any character Fettel possesses, such as Cultists and Phase Commanders.&lt;ref name=ignLive_e32010 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3hurGfqph8 |title=F.E.A.R. 3 - Paxton Fettel Singleplayer Trailer |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-02-14 |accessdate=2013-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In co-op mode, Fettel can also use the Shield ability to briefly protect the Point Man. Both characters' abilities are gauged by a meter in the reticle, which depletes during use. Both characters' gauges slowly refills when not in use; Fettel, meanwhile, must collect Souls to replenish his Possession Meter. Players have the ability to access and control Armacham technology, such as mech suits.&lt;ref name=ignLive_e32010 /&gt; Also, the game has both online and offline co-operative play.

The game's campaign mode is split into eight "Intervals" that can be played in either single-player or co-op. In single-player, when the player completes an Interval as the Point Man, they will unlock the ability to play as Fettel for that Interval.&lt;ref name=cn /&gt; While playing alone or with a friend, the player can complete challenges to raise their rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RGti2exqC4|title=F.E.A.R. 3 - Scoring|author=|authorlink=|date=|work=[[YouTube]]|publisher=GamerSpawn|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perks include increases to the slow motion and possession meters and new melee attacks.&lt;ref name=cn /&gt;

===Multiplayer===
[[File:F.E.A.R. 3 - MP - F**king Run! screenshot.jpg|275px|thumb|right|A screenshot from the game mode "Fucking Run!". Here, the player is backing away from the Wall of Death.]]
''F.E.A.R. 3'' offers four different multiplayer modes, each allowing up to 4 players:
*'''Fucking Run!''' (see right): in this mode, players must fight their way through waves of enemies, all while running from [[Alma Wade|Alma]]'s massive "Wall of Death." The players start off in a safe area and proceed through a series of connected maps, killing enemies that stand in their way.&lt;ref name=K-ralz&gt;{{cite web|last=Gesualdi|first=Vito|title=Game Preview for F.3.A.R.

*'''Contractions''': a round-based survival mode, where players must barricade and stock up weapons against a total of 20 waves of enemies, including Armacham forces, Cultists, and more. Waves become increasingly tougher by thickening fog, making the map much more dangerous, especially with Alma wandering the field. If a player gets Alma's attention, either by attacking her or staying in her sight for too long, it is game over for that player.&lt;ref name=cn /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHTP56Oh2Bo|title=FEAR 3: Contractions Multiplayer Trailer|date=|work=[[YouTube]]|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2013-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Soul Survivor''': Here, players must fight to survive or hunt. When the game starts, Alma will turn one player into a "Spectre", a ghost which can possess enemies. The Spectre player's goal is to kill the other three players and turn them into Spectres before time runs out. Players killed by the Spectre player do not get a game over; instead, they turn into Spectres themselves.&lt;ref name=cn /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiRvHWE5L7k|title=FEAR 3: Soul Survivor Multiplayer Trailer|date=|work=[[YouTube]]|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2013-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Soul King''': though similar to Soul Survivor, Soul King is a competitive mode with all players as Spectres. To win, players must possess enemies to kill each other and collect dropped souls. The player with the most souls earns the title of "Soul King"; however, this also means that said player will be made visible to other players via a glowing outline. If a Soul King is killed, that player will drop half of their souls.&lt;ref name=cn /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-521sd7XAw|title=FEAR 3: Soul King Multiplayer Trailer|date=|work=[[YouTube]]|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2013-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==

Nine months after the events of both games,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ign.com/games/fear-3/xbox-360-45906 ''F.E.A.R. 3'' on IGN&lt;/ref&gt; the Point Man has been captured by Armacham soldiers and interrogated at a prison in [[Brazil]]. Paxton Fettel ([[Peter Lurie]]), now a "Spectre", interrupts the interrogation and helps free the Point Man. The two form an uneasy alliance and escape the prison through the slums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The game|url=http://www.fear3.co.uk/the-game.html|work=F.E.A.R. 3|publisher=[[Day 1 Studios]]|accessdate=|quote=Eight months ago, Point Man and his F.E.A.R. squad were tapped to stop an unknown man who had commandeered a secret battalion of telepathically-controlled supersoldiers at the Armacham research facility in the Northwestern US city of Fairport. During the mission Point Man learned that the man wasn't working alone. In fact, the very people Point Man was working to destroy were his telepathic, cannibalistic brother, Paxton Fettel, and his tortured and psychically powerful mother, Alma Wade—products of Armacham's perverse paranormal experiments. Despite this revelation, Point Man moved forward with the standing F.E.A.R. team orders to stop the targets at any cost. In a last-ditch attempt to end the pair's homicidal rampage, the F.E.A.R. team set in motion an explosive series of events that seemingly accomplished their goal but at the cost of ravaging the city, its inhabitants and almost all of Point Man's squad mates.&lt;br/&gt;For months following the blast, events in Fairport have made it clear that Alma's psychic influence survived—and worse, her paranormal power is growing and spilling into reality. Now her supernatural agony repeatedly rocks the city as she attempts to secure the survival of her bloodline and reunite her family. Armacham's security force remains violently focused on eliminating all evidence of the events in the city, and the remaining F.E.A.R squad carries on the mission to stop Alma.&lt;br/&gt;With the chain of command broken and Point Man calling his own shots, where will his allegiance lie? With his brother Paxton Fettel, back from the dead, arriving with an unclear agenda and refusing to leave Point Man's side? With his pregnant mother Alma and her horrifically twisted, yet immensely powerful paranormal existence? Or with his remaining F.E.A.R. squad brethren who are hell bent on saving the world, but at the cost of destroying the only blood ties Point Man has ever had?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=F.E.A.R. 3|developer=[[Day 1 Studios]]|publisher=[[Warner Bros.

Amid growing distrust, the brothers assault the local airport to intercept Becket, killing the remnants of the Armacham personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=F.E.A.R. 3|developer=[[Day 1 Studios]]|publisher=[[Warner Bros.

After destroying a monstrous apparition of the Creep, the brothers finally reunite with Alma, whose body has changed drastically due to her pregnancy. The Point Man aims his pistol at Alma's belly, where her third child resides, and Fettel angrily asks him if he is willing to throw his own blood away for orders. As they set themselves at each other's throats, one of two endings occur, depending on multiple factors (such as whether the player has played as the Point Man or Fettel, or in co-op, who has made the most points in 5 different sections of the game's combat.)

In the Point Man's ending, he shoots Fettel in the head again, forcing him to vanish; then aims his gun at Alma, who gives birth before peacefully vanishing. The Point Man then learns from Jin that everything has returned to normal before taking Alma's baby away with him to safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=F.E.A.R. 3|developer=[[Day 1 Studios]]|publisher=[[Warner Bros.

In a post-credits scene, video footage is shown of the Synchronicity Event; the moment when Alma — in a coma at the time — linked telepathically to Fettel ([[Jeremy Shada]]) when he was ten years old. The event causes Fettel to go into a hysterical rage, in which he gruesomely kills several ATC security members using telekinetic attacks before finally being subdued. Fettel is heard in a voiceover saying, "They deserved to die. They all deserved to die." and vowing it won't stop until Armacham is completely destroyed in the never ending quest for revenge of his mother.

The '''gates of hell''' are various places on the surface of the [[World (theology)|world]] that have acquired a legendary reputation for being entrances to the [[underworld]]. Often they are found in regions of unusual geological activity, particularly volcanic areas, or sometimes at lakes, caves or mountains.

== Gates in the Greco-Roman world ==

Legends from both ancient [[Greece]] and Rome record stories of mortals who entered or were abducted into the [[underworld|netherworld]] through such gates. [[Aeneas]] visited the underworld, entering through a cave at the edge of [[Lake Avernus]] on the [[Bay of Naples]].&lt;ref name="medieval culture"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3RtpCgAAQBAJ|title=Handbook of Medieval Culture|last=Classen|first=Albrecht|date=August 31, 2015|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG|isbn=978-3-11-026730-3|page=664|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hercules entered the Underworld from this same spot.

In the middle of the Roman Forum is another entrance, [[Lacus Curtius]], where according to legend, a Roman soldier, named Curtius, bravely rode his horse into the entrance in a successful effort to close it, although both he and his horse perished in the deed.&lt;ref&gt;''The Marvels of Rome'' (NewYork: Italica Press, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lerna]] Lake was one of the entrances to the Underworld.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Places/Lerna/lerna.html|title=Lerna|website=www.greekmythology.com|access-date=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gini-graham-scott/trump-and-the-many-headed_b_9545452.html|title=Trump and the Many Headed Monsters|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Odysseus]] visited the Underworld, entering through river [[Acheron]] in northwest Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=igrUAgAAQBAJ|title=History of Toxicology and Environmental Health: Toxicology in Antiquity|last=Wexler|first=Philip|date=May 22, 2014|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-800463-0|page=95|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Orpheus]] traveled to the [[Greek underworld]] in search of [[Eurydice]] by entering a cave at [[Taenarum]] or Cape Tenaron on the southern tip of the [[Peloponnese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewsnews.co.il/2014/04/13/archeologists-discover-gates-of-hell-in-turkey/|title=Archeologists Discover 'Gates of Hell' in Turkey|website=JEWSNEWS|access-date=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pluto's Gate]], ''[[Ploutonion]]'' in [[Greek language|Greek]], ''Plutonium'' in [[Latin]], in modern-day [[Turkey]] unearthed by Italian archaeologists is said to be the entry gate to the Underworld; it is linked to the [[Classical mythology|Greco-Roman mythology and tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://science.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/04/01/17554605-plutos-gate-to-hell-uncovered-in-turkey|title=Pluto's 'Gate to Hell' uncovered in Turkey|website=NBC News|access-date=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rivers [[Cocytus]], [[Lethe]], [[Phlegethon]] and [[Styx]] were also entrances to the Underworld.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2952186/Together-eternity-6-000-year-old-skeletons-locked-embrace-inside-Greek-underworld-caves.html|title=Skeletons found locked in embrace for 6,000 in Greek cave|website=Mail Online|access-date=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The god [[Hades]] kidnapped the goddess [[Persephone]] from a field in [[Sicily]] and led her to the Underworld through a cleft in the earth so he could marry her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mythmaniacs.com/homewk08.htm|title=Homework Page Eight|website=mythmaniacs.com|access-date=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medieval gates ==
Into the medieval period, [[Mount Etna]] on Sicily was considered to be an entryway to hell.&lt;ref name="medieval culture" /&gt;

The gates of hell were commonly depicted as jaws, forming the [[Hellmouth]], which was simultaneously the entrance to hell and the mouth of a huge monster.

== Art ==
[[Auguste Rodin]] was commissioned to make a pair of bronze doors to symbolize the gates of hell. He received the commission on August 20, 1880 for a new art museum in Paris, to exhibit at the 1889 Exposition Universelle, which ultimately did not open; however in 1900, some of them were part of his first solo exhibition in Paris. Rodin spent seven years making the doors, with over 200 figures appearing on it. He was first inspired by Dante's [[Inferno (Dante)|''Inferno'']] but focused more on universal human emotions. During his lifetime the model was never cast and it was first cast in 1925. ''[[The Gates of Hell]]'' was described as one of the defining works of Rodin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rodinmuseum.org/collections/collectiontheme/4.html|title=Rodin Museum : The Collection|last=Museum|first=Rodin|website=www.rodinmuseum.org|access-date=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert Alhadeff, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3048395 "Rodin: A Self-Portrait in the Gates of Hell"] ''Art Bulletin'' 48(3/4)(September–December 1966): 393–395. doi: 10.2307/3048395&lt;/ref&gt; Having hoped to exhibit his ''Gates'' at the 1889 Exposition Universelle, but probably too busy to finish them, the sculptor stopped working on them circa 1890.

== Religious contexts ==

In 1878, Rev. [[Thomas De Witt Talmage]] delivered a widely reprinted sermon titled "The Gates of Hell" at the [[Brooklyn Tabernacle]], based on the [[Bible|scripture]] [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 16:18, message by Jesus to [[Saint Peter|Peter]] "...on this rock, I will build my church, and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it."  Talmage's gates were metaphorical, including "infamous literature," "dissolute dance," "indiscreet apparel," and "alcoholic beverage".&lt;!-- per [[WP:LQ]] --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4754364/talmages_gates_of_hell_sermon_1878/ "The Gates of Hell; Talmage on Both Sides of Them"] ''The Times'' (October 28, 1878): 1. via [[Newspapers.com]]{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SeveranceSeverance2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gordon Severance|author2=Diana Severance|title=Against the Gates of Hell: The Life &amp; Times of Henry Perry, A Christian Missionary in a Moslem World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=op9NAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2|date=October 22, 2012|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|isbn=978-1-62032-525-4|pages=2–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient Indian [[Hindu]] tradition the [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] constellation where the [[vernal equinox]] is stated to occur, the [[Milky Way]] and the [[Canis]] were considered to form the border between [[Devaloka]] (heaven) and [[Naraka (Hinduism)|Yamaloka]] (hell); the Milky Way forming the dividing river between heaven and hell and the [[Canis Major]] and [[Canis Minor]] representing dogs that guarded the Gates of Hell.&lt;ref name="Sen2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joydeep Sen|title=Astronomy in India, 1784–1876|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0OA5CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA160|date=July 22, 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-31843-9|pages=160–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gymnosophists''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|γυμνοσοφισταί}}, ''gymnosophistai'', i.e. "naked philosophers" or "naked wise men")&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|gumnosofistai/|γυμνοσοφισταί|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pk/&gt; is the name  given by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] to certain ancient [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophers]] who pursued [[asceticism]] to the point of regarding food and clothing as detrimental to purity of thought. They were noted to have been vegetarian by several Greek authors.&lt;ref name=pk/&gt; There were also gymnosophists in upper Egypt who were called Ethiopean Gymnosophists by [[Apollonius of Tyana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/aot/aot/aot11.htm Apollonius of Tyana, SECTION X, THE GYMNOSOPHISTS OF UPPER EGYPT,  by G.R.S.

In Greek literature they are mentioned in association with the Persian magi, the Chaldaeans of the Assyrians or the Babylonians, the druids of the Celts and the priests of Egypt etc. &lt;ref&gt;[https://grbs.library.duke.edu/article/viewFile/1451/1541  The Gymnosophist Riddle Contest (Berol.

They are mentioned by  authors such as Philo, Lucian, Clement, Philostratus, and Heliodorus  and are thought to have served as models to Cynics as well as Christian ascetics. Many authors have discussed the purported questions by Alexander and answers by the Gymnosophists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eos.uni.wroc.pl/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/7_EOS-2011-1-Szalc.pdf   Alexander's Dialogue with Indian Philosophers.

==Ancient accounts==
The term was used by [[Plutarch]]  (c. CE 46 – CE 120) in the 1st century CE, when describing an encounter by [[Alexander the Great]] with ten gymnosophists near the banks of the [[Indus]] river in what is now Pakistan.

{{quote|He (Alexander) captured ten of the Gymnosophists who had done most to get Sabbas to revolt, and had made the most trouble for the Macedonians. These philosophers were reputed to be clever and concise in answering questions, and Alexander therefore put difficult questions to them, declaring that he would put to death him who first made an incorrect answer, and then the rest, in an order determined in like manner; and he commanded one of them, the oldest, to be the judge in the contest. The first one, accordingly, being asked which, in his opinion, were more numerous, the living or the dead, said that the living were, since the dead no longer existed. The second, being asked whether the earth or the sea produced larger animals, said the earth did, since the sea was but a part of the earth. The third, being asked what animal was the most cunning, said: "That which up to this time man has not discovered." The fourth, when asked why he had induced Sabbas to revolt, replied: "Because I wished him either to live nobly or to die nobly." The fifth, being asked which, in his opinion, was older, day or night, replied: "Day, by one day"; and he added, upon the king expressing amazement, that hard questions must have hard answers. Passing on, then, to the sixth, Alexander asked how a man could be most loved; "If," said the philosopher, "he is most powerful, and yet does not inspire fear." Of the three remaining, he who was asked how one might become a god instead of man, replied: "By doing something which a man cannot do"; the one who was asked which was the stronger, life or death, answered: "Life, since it supports so many ills." And the last, asked how long it were well for a man to live, answered: "Until he does not regard death as better than life." So, then, turning to the judge, Alexander bade him give his opinion. The judge declared that they had answered one worse than another. "Well, then," said Alexander, "thou shalt die first for giving such a verdict." "That cannot be, O King," said the judge, "unless thou falsely saidst that thou wouldst put to death first him who answered worst." These philosophers, then, he dismissed with gifts...|Plutarch, ''Life of Alexander,'' "The parallel lives", 64-65.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Alexander*/9.html#64 Life of Alexander, 64-65]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Diogenes Laertius]] (fl. 3rd century AD) (ix. 61 and 63) refers to them, and reports that [[Pyrrho]] of Elis, the founder of pure scepticism, came under the influence of the Gymnosophists while travelling  to India with Alexander, and on his return to Elis, imitated their habits of life; however, the extent of their influence is not described.

[[Strabo]] (64 or 63 BC – c. AD 24) says that gymnosophists were religious people among the Indians (XVI,I), and otherwise divides Indian philosophers into [[Brahmin]]s and [[Śramaṇa]]s (XV,I,59-60), following the accounts of [[Megasthenes]]. He further divides the Sramanas into "Hylobioi" (forest hermits, c.f. [[Aranyaka]]) and "Physicians."

{{Quote|Of the Sarmanes, the most honourable, he says, are the Hylobii, who live in the forests, and subsist on leaves and wild fruits: they are clothed with garments made of the bark of trees, and abstain from commerce with women and from wine.|Strabo XV|I,60}}

{{Quote|Of the Sarmanes (...) second in honour to the Hylobii, are the physicians, for they apply philosophy to the study of the nature of man. They are of frugal habits, but do not live in the fields, and subsist upon rice and meal, which every one gives when asked, and receive them hospitably. (...) Both this and the other class of persons practise fortitude, as well in supporting active toil as in enduring suffering, so that they will continue a whole day in the same posture, without motion.|Strabo XV|I,60}}

Philo Judaeus (c. 20 BCE – c. 50 CE), also called  mentions the Gymnosophists twice in the course of listing foreign ascetics and philosophers who are, in his estimation, "prudent, and just, and virtuous" and therefore truly free:

{{Quote|And among the Indians there is the class of the gymnosophists, who, in addition to natural philosophy, take great pains in the study of moral science likewise, and thus make their whole existence a sort of lesson in virtue.|[[Philo Judaeus]]|''Every Good Man is Free'', 74}}

{{Quote|But it is necessary for us...to bring forward as corroborative testimonies the lives of some particular good men who are the most undeniable evidences of freedom. [[Calanus (person)|Calanus]] was an Indian by birth, one of the gymnosophists; he, being looked upon as the man who was possessed of the greatest fortitude of all his contemporaries, and that too, not only by his own countrymen, but also by foreigners, which is the rarest of all things, was greatly admired by some kings of hostile countries, because he had combined virtuous actions with praiseworthy language.|[[Philo Judaeus]]|''Every Good Man is Free'', 92-93.}}

In the 2nd century CE, the Christian theologian [[Clement of Alexandria]] distinguishes the Gymnosophists, the philosophers of the Indians, from the Sramanas, "the philosophers of the Bactrians":

{{Quote|Philosophy, then, with all its blessed advantages to man, flourished long ages ago among the barbarians, diffusing its light among the [[gentiles]], and eventually penetrated into Greece. Its [[hierophant]]s were the prophets among the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], the [[Chaldea]]ns among the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], the [[Druids]] among the [[Galatia]]ns, ''the [[Sramana]]s of the [[Bactrians]]'', and the philosophers of the [[Celts]], the [[Magi]] among the [[Persian people|Persians]] who announced beforehand the birth of the Saviour, being led by a star till they arrived in the land of [[Judea|Judaea]], and ''among the Indians the Gymnosophists'', and other philosophers of barbarous nations.|[[Clement of Alexandria]]|''[[Stromata]]'' 1.15.71 (ed. Colon. 1688 p. 305, A, B).}}

The Greeks encountered the gymnosophists in the third century BCE at the town of [[Taxila (ancient)|ancient Taxila]] in [[Ancient India]], which was an ancient centre of Indian learning.

'''''Harmonie universelle''''' (Complete title: ''Harmonie universelle, contenant la théorie et la pratique de la musique'') is the work of [[Marin Mersenne]], published in Paris in 1636. It represented the sum of musical knowledge during his lifetime.

This was a major work since it represented the most complete description of music theory near the middle of the 17th century in France. It covers all aspects including theoretical, practical, stylistic, organological, mathematics, acoustics, and theological.

==Content==

The title page specifies the scope of the topics covered by the book including the nature of sounds, movements, consonance, dissonance, genres, modes of composition, voice, singing, and all kinds of harmonic instruments. This monumental treatise is abundant in illustrations (including musical engravings), and in systematic tables. It also remains the only source of certain musical works from [[Jacques Mauduit]], [[Eustache Du Caurroy]], Antoine de Sewn, or Pierre de La Barre in particular.

==Synopsis==
Jack ([[Henry Rollins]]) has developed a routine for his life that he sticks to in order to avoid giving into the impulse to engage in [[cannibalism]]. He stays away from society other than regular trips to a local diner, [[Bingo (U.S.)|bingo games]], and to the hospital, where he purchases blood from a hospital intern, Jeremy ([[Booboo Stewart]]). After returning from one trip, Jack is confronted by mobsters Steve and Short, who are looking for Jeremy.

Jack's routine is further interrupted by a phone call from his ex-girlfriend, Gillian, who asks him to find their daughter, Andrea ([[Jordan Todosey]]), who tried to contact him earlier that day. Unhappy, Jack agrees to locate Andrea, but stresses that he wants no further contact with Gillian. He finds Andrea and takes her with him to the diner he frequents, where she meets Cara (Kate Greenhouse), a waitress with a crush on Jack. While Jack slowly bonds with Andrea he sees visions of an old man with a goatee, wearing a porkpie hat, and also manages to foil Steve and Short's attempt to kidnap Jeremy. Jack is surprised when he discovers that Andrea can also see the man, as previously only Jack could see him.

Out for vengeance, Short and Steve try to murder Jack, only for Jack to kill Short by tearing out his throat with his bare hands and eating it. Afraid that he'll do the same to Andrea, Jack forces her to leave the apartment. Shortly afterwards Jack kills and eats an obnoxious neighbor. Later, he goes out and tries to pick fights with various people, who turn out to be nice. Eventually, he comes across three young men spoiling for a fight, culminating in him killing one or more of them. Jack ultimately receives a phone call from the mobsters, who inform him that they have killed Gillian and kidnapped Andrea and will kill her if he does not surrender. Jack tries to confront Alex ([[Steven Ogg]]), a local crime boss, and the man he believes is responsible, only for Alex to deny that he had anything to do with the kidnapping.

Upset, Jack goes to the diner, where he bribes Cara into helping him save Andrea by offering her a million dollars. She discovers that Jack is actually the Biblical figure [[Cain and Abel|Cay'in (Cain)]], doomed to live as a seeming immortal cannibal, perhaps  for killing Haq'bal (whom the [[Hebrew Bible]] identifies as his brother, Abel). Jack ultimately discovers the reason why the mobsters were after Jeremy: he had borrowed a large sum of money to pay off his student loans, without repaying it. He also learns of Andrea's whereabouts and goes to rescue her. Alex reveals that he kidnapped Andrea as revenge for Jack killing Alex's father, a mobster Jack once worked for. Just as Jack is about to murder Alex, the man with the goatee arrives, prompting Jack to angrily confront him over his punishment for murdering Abel. Jack demands to know why the man won't let him die, with the implication that the old man is either Death, or Satan because God is referred to as She during Jack's confrontation with the man. Jack ends up choosing to spare Alex in favor of helping Andrea seek medical attention. Before leaving with Cara and Andrea, Jack promises Alex that one day he will see the goateed man. After they have left, the goateed man appears to the very injured Alex, greeting him with a resonant otherworldly-sounding voice.

[[File:LondonSmog.jpg|thumb|{{largethumb}}|2004 filming of a 19th-century film scene set in [[London]]]]
The term '''historical period drama''' (also '''historical drama''', '''period drama''', '''costume drama''', and '''period piece''') refers to a work set in a past time period, usually used in the context of [[film]] and [[television]]. It is an informal crossover term that can apply to several [[genre]]s and is often heard in the context of [[historical fiction]] and [[romance film|romance]]s, [[adventure film]]s, and [[swashbuckler]]s. A period piece may be set in a vague or general era such as the [[Middle Ages]] or a specific period such as the [[Roaring Twenties]]. A religious work can qualify as period drama but not as historical drama.

==Historical accuracy==
Some works attempt to accurately portray historical events or persons, to the degree that the available historical research and the length of the work will allow. These types of works are also known as [[docudrama]], examples being ''[[Cinderella Man]]'', ''[[Schindler's List]]'', and ''[[Lincoln (film)|Lincoln]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZcGNAQAAQBAJ|title=Inspired by True Events: An Illustrated Guide to More Than 500 History-Based Films, 2nd Edition: An Illustrated Guide to More Than 500 History-Based Films|last=Niemi|first=Robert|date=2013-10-17|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781610691987|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other works are fictionalized stories based on actual people or events, such as ''[[Braveheart]]'' and ''[[Les Misérables (2012 film)|Les Misérables]]''.

==Examples==

'''Igbo''' ({{Lang-ig|Ásụ̀sụ̀ Ị̀gbò}}; {{IPA-all|ásʊ̀sʊ̀ ɪ̀ɡ͡bòː|Igbo|Ig Igbo.ogg}}; {{IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|ɪ|ɡ|b|oʊ}};&lt;ref name=Bauer&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student's Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;), is the principal native language of the [[Igbo people]], an ethnic group of southeastern [[Nigeria]]. The language has approximately 24 million speakers, who live mostly in [[Nigeria]] and are primarily of [[Igbo people|Igbo]] descent. Igbo is written in the [[Latin script]], which was introduced by [[British Empire|British colonialists]].
Igbo has over 20 dialects, though [[dialect levelling]] appears to be occurring.&lt;!--need more info on this--&gt; A standard literary language was developed in 1972 based on the [[Owerri]] (Isuama) and [[Umuahia]] (such as Ohuhu) dialects, though it omits the [[nasal vowel|nasalization]] and [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]] of those varieties. Related [[Igboid languages]] such as [[Ika language (Nigeria)|Ika]], [[Ikwerre language|Ikwerre]] and [[Ogba language|Ogba]] are sometimes considered dialects of Igbo;&lt;ref name="www.rogerblench.info2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/Niger-Congo/VN/Igboid/Ogba%20Dictionary.pdf|title=A DICTIONARY OF ỌGBÀ, AN IGBOID LANGUAGE OF SOUTHERN NIGERIA|date=August 11, 2013|publisher=Roger Blench, Kay Williamson Educational Foundation, Cambridge, UK|author=Ọgba Language Committee|work=www.rogerblench.info|p=3|accessdate=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most divergent of these is [[Ekpeye language|Ekpeye]]. Igbo is also a recognised minority language of Equatorial Guinea.

== History ==
The first book to publish Igbo words was ''History of the Mission of the Evangelical Brothers in the Caribbean'' ({{Lang-de|Geschichte der Mission der Evangelischen Brüder auf den Carabischen Inseln}}), published in 1777.&lt;ref name=Oraka21&gt;{{cite book |last=Oraka |first=L. N. |year=1983 |title=The foundations of Igbo studies |publisher=University Publishing Co. |page=21 |isbn=978-160-264-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; Shortly afterwards in 1789, ''[[The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano]]'' was published in London, England, written by [[Olaudah Equiano]], a former slave, featuring 79 Igbo words.&lt;ref name=Oraka21/&gt;&amp;nbsp; The narrative also illustrated various aspects of Igbo life in detail, based on Olaudah Equiano's experiences in his hometown of Essaka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Equiano |first=Olaudah |page=9 |year=1789 |isbn=1-4250-4524-3 |title=The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FXVkAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language was standardized in church usage by the Union Ibo Bible (1916), shortly after completion [[Thomas John Dennis]] died in a shipping accident off the Welsh coast, but the Bible manuscript he was working on was reportedly washed ashore and found by a fisherman.

Central Igbo, the dialect form gaining widest acceptance, is based on the dialects of two members of the [[Ezinihitte]] group of Igbo in Central Owerri Province between the towns of Owerri and Umuahia in Eastern Nigeria. From its proposal as a literary form in 1939 by Dr. [[Ida C. Ward]], it was gradually accepted by missionaries, writers, and publishers across the region. In 1972, the [[Society for Promoting Igbo Language and Culture]] (SPILC), a nationalist organisation which saw Central Igbo as an imperialist exercise, set up a Standardisation Committee to extend Central Igbo to be a more inclusive language. Standard Igbo aims to cross-pollinate Central Igbo with words from Igbo dialects from outside the "Central" areas, and with the adoption of [[loan words]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Oraka |first=L. N. |year=1983 |title=The foundations of Igbo studies |publisher=University Publishing Co. |page=35 |isbn=978-160-264-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vocabulary ==

=== Word classes ===
Lexical categories in Igbo include nouns, pronouns, numerals, verbs, adjectives, conjunctions, and a single preposition.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Green, M.M. and G.E. Igwe. 1963. ''A Descriptive Grammar of Igbo.'' Deutsche Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin: Institut für Orientforschung.&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of ''na'', the single  preposition, is flexible and must be ascertained from the context. Examples from Emenanjo (2015) illustrate the range of meaning:

(1) O bì '''n''''Enugwū.

: 3sg live '''PREP''' Enugwū
: 'He lives '''in''' Enugwū.'

(2) O bì ebe à '''n''''ogè agha.

: 3sg live here this '''PREP''' time war
: 'He lived here '''during''' the time of the war.'

(3) Ndị Fàda kwènyèrè '''n''''atọ̀ '''n''''ime otù.

: people Catholic believe '''PREP''' three '''PREP''' inside one
: 'The Catholics believe in the Three-in-One.'&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Igbo has an extremely limited number of [[adjective]]s in a [[closed class]]. Emenanjo (1978, 2015)&lt;ref&gt;Emenanjo, Nolue. 1978. Elements of Modern Igbo Grammar - a descriptive approach. Ibadan, Nigeria: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Emenanjo, Nolue. ''A Grammar of Contemporary Igbo: Constituents, Features and Processes.'' Oxford: M and J Grand Orbit Communications, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; counts just eight, which occur in pairs of opposites: ''ukwu'' 'big', ''nta'' 'small'; ''oji'' 'dark', ''ọcha'' 'light'; ''ọhụrụ'' 'new', ''ochie'' 'old'; ''ọma'' 'good'; ''ọjọọ'' 'bad' (Payne 1990).&lt;ref&gt;JR Payne, 1990, "Language Universals and Language Types", in Collinge, ed., ''An Encyclopedia of Language''&lt;/ref&gt; Adjectival meaning is otherwise conveyed through the use of stative verbs or abstract nouns.

Verbs, by far the most prominent category in Igbo, host most of the language's morphology and appear to be the most basic category; many processes can derive new words from verbs, but few can derive verbs from words of other classes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Non-compositional compounds ===
Many names in Igbo are actually fusions of older original words and phrases. For example, one Igbo word for vegetable leaves is ''akwụkwọ nri'', which literally means "leaves for eating" or "vegetables". Green leaves are called ''akwụkwọ ndụ'', because ''ndụ'' means "life". Another example is train (''ụgbọ igwe''), which comes from the words ''ụgbọ'' (vehicle, craft) and ''igwe'' (iron, metal); thus a locomotive train is vehicle via iron (rails); a car, ''ụgbọ ala''; vehicle via land and an aeroplane ''ụgbọ elu''; ''vehicle via air''.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

=== Polysemy ===
Words may also take on multiple meanings. Take for example the word ''akwụkwọ''. ''Akwụkwọ'' originally means "leaf" (as on a tree), but during and after the colonization period, ''akwụkwọ'' also came to be linked to "paper", "book", "school", and "education", to become respectively ''akwụkwọ édémédé'', ''akwụkwọ ọgụgụ'', ''ụlọ akwụkwọ'', ''mmụta akwụkwọ''.  This is because printed paper can be first linked to an organic leaf, and then the paper to a book, the book to a school, and so on. Combined with other words, ''akwụkwọ'' can take on many forms; for example, ''akwụkwọ ego'' means "printed money" or "bank notes", and ''akwụkwọ ejị éjé njem'' means "passport."{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

== Phonology ==
[[Image:Igbo vowel chart.svg|thumb|The oral vowel phonemes of Igbo, based on {{Harvcoltxt|Ikekeonwu|1999}}]]
Igbo is a [[tone (linguistics)|tonal language]] with two distinctive tones, high and low. In some cases a third, [[downstep]]ped high tone is recognized. The language's tone system was given by [[John Goldsmith (linguist)|John Goldsmith]] as an example of [[autosegmental]] phenomena that go beyond the linear model of [[phonology]] laid out in ''[[The Sound Pattern of English]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith, John A. 1976. ''Autosegmental Phonology''. Ph.D. dissertation, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Accessed at &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/dm/theses/goldsmith76.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Igbo words may differ only in tone. An example is ''ákwá'' "cry", ''àkwà'' "bed", ''àkwá'' "egg", and ''ákwà'' "cloth". As tone is not normally written, these all appear as {{angbr|akwa}} in print.

In many cases, the two (or sometimes three) tones commonly used in Igbo dictionaries do not help users pronounce words correctly. This indicates that the Igbo may have several other tones, possibly up to 8 in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Okporoko |first1=Igbo Dictionary |title=Okporoko Igbo Dictionary |url=https://okporokodictionary.com |website=OID |publisher=OID |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the imperative form of the word bia "come" has a different tone to that used in statement O bia "he came". That imperative tone is also used in the second syllable of abuo "two". Another distinct tone appears in the second syllabus of asaa"seven" and another in the second syllabus of aguu"hunger".

The language features [[vowel harmony]] with two sets of oral vowels distinguished by [[human pharynx|pharyngeal]] cavity size described in terms of [[retracted tongue root]] (RTR). These vowels also occupy different places in vowel space: {{IPA|[i ɪ̙ e a u ʊ̙ o ɒ̙]}} (the last commonly transcribed {{IPA|[ɔ̙]}}, in keeping with neighboring languages). For simplicity, phonemic transcriptions typically choose only one of these parameters to be distinctive, either RTR as in the chart at right and Igbo orthography (that is, as {{IPA|/i i̙ e a u u̙ o o̙/}}), or vowel space as in the alphabetic chart below (that is, as {{IPA|/i ɪ e a u ʊ o ɔ/}}). There are also [[nasal vowel]]s.

Adjacent vowels usually undergo [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] during speech. The sound of a preceding vowel, usually at the end of one word, merges in a rapid transition to the sound of the following vowel, particularly at the start of another word, giving the second vowel greater prominence in speech. Usually the first vowel (in the first word) is only slightly identifiable to listeners, usually undergoing [[Vowel reduction|centralisation]]. /kà ó mésjá/, for example, becomes /kòó mésjá/ "goodbye". An exception to this assimilation may be with words ending in /a/ such as /nà/ in /nà àlà/, "on the ground", which could be completely assimilated leaving /n/ in rapid speech, as in "nàlà" or "n'àlà". In other dialects however, the instance of /a/ such as in "nà" in /ọ́ nà èrí ńrí/, "he/she/it is eating", results in a long vowel, /ọ́ nèèrí ńrí/.&lt;ref name="welmers74"&gt;Welmers, William Everett (1974). ''African Language Structures''. University of California Press. pp. 41-42. {{ISBN|0520022106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Igbo does not have a contrast among voiced occlusives (between voiced stops and nasals): the one precedes oral vowels, and the other nasal vowels. Only a limited number of consonants occur before nasal vowels, including {{IPA|/f, z, s/}}.

In some dialects, such as Enu-Onitsha Igbo, the doubly articulated {{IPA|/ɡ͡b/}} and {{IPA|/k͡p/}} are realized as a voiced/devoiced bilabial [[implosive]]. The approximant {{IPA|/ɹ/}} is realized as an [[alveolar tap]] {{IPAblink|ɾ}} between vowels as in ''árá''. The Enu-Onitsha Igbo dialect is very much similar to Enuani spoken among the Igbo-Anioma people in Delta State.

To illustrate the effect of phonological analysis, the following inventory of a typical Central dialect is taken from Clark (1990). Nasality has been analyzed as a feature of consonants, rather than vowels, avoiding the problem of why so few consonants occur before nasal vowels; {{IPA|[CjV]}} has also been analyzed as {{IPA|/CʲV/}}.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Clark, 1990.

Syllables are of the form (C)V (optional consonant, vowel) or N (a [[syllabic nasal]]). CV is the most common syllable type. Every syllable bears a tone. Consonant clusters do not occur. The semivowels {{IPAslink|j}} and {{IPAslink|w}} can occur between consonant and vowel in some syllables. The semi-vowel in {{IPA|/CjV/}} is analyzed as an underlying vowel "ị", so that ''-bịa'' is the phonemic form of ''bjá'' 'come'. On the other hand, "w" in {{IPA|/CwV/}} is analyzed as an instance of labialization; so the phonemic form of the verb ''-gwá'' "tell" is {{IPA|/-ɡʷá/}}.

== Morphological typology ==
Igbo is an [[Agglutinative language|agglutinating]] language that exhibits very little [[Fusional language|fusion]]. The language is predominantly [[suffix]]ing in a hierarchical manner, such that the ordering of suffixes is governed [[Semantics|semantically]] rather than by fixed position classes. The language has very little [[inflection]]al morphology but much [[Derivational morpheme|derivational]] and extensional morphology. Most derivation takes place with verbal roots.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Extensional suffixes, a term used in the Igbo literature, refer to morphology that has some but not all characteristics of derivation. The words created by these suffixes always belong to the same lexical category as the root from which they are created, and the suffixes' effects are principally semantic. On these grounds, Emenanjo (2015) asserts that the suffixes called extensional are bound lexical compounding elements; they cannot occur independently, though many are related to other free morphemes from which they may have originally been derived.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition to affixation, Igbo exhibits both partial and full [[reduplication]] to form [[gerund]]s from verbs. The partial form copies on the initial consonant and inserts a high front vowel, while the full form copies the first consonant and vowel. Both types are then prefixed with ''o-''. For example, ''-go'' 'buy' partially reduplicates to form ''ògigo'' 'buying,' and ''-bu'' 'carry' fully reduplicates to form òbubu 'carrying. Some other noun and verb forms also exhibit reduplication, but because the reduplicated forms are semantically unpredictable, reduplication in their case is not synchronically productive, and they are better described as separate lexical items.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Grammatical relations ==
Igbo does not mark overt case distinctions on nominal constituents and conveys grammatical relations only through [[word order]]. The typical Igbo sentence displays subject-verb-object (SVO) ordering, where subject is understood as the sole argument of an intransitive verb or the agent-like (external) argument of a transitive verb. Igbo thus exhibits [[Nominative–accusative language|accusative]] [[Morphosyntactic alignment|alignment]].

It has been proposed, with reservations, that some Igbo verbs display ergativity on some level, as in the following two examples:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

(4) Nnukwu mmīri nà-ezò n'iro.

: big water AUX-fall at outside
: 'Heavy rain is falling outside.'

(5) Ọ nà-ezò nnukwu mmīri n'iro.

: it AUX-fall big water at outside
: 'Heavy rain is falling outside.'

In (4), the verb has a single argument, ''nnukwu mmīri'', which appears in subject position, and in the transitive sentence (5), that same argument appears in the object position, even though the two are semantically identical. On this basis, authors such as Emenanjuo (2015) have posited that this argument is an absolutive and that Igbo therefore contains some degree of ergativity.

However, others disagree, arguing that the relevant category is not alignment but underlying argument structure; under this hypothesis, (4) and (5) differ only in the application of a transformation and can be accounted for entirely by the [[Unaccusative verb|unaccusative]] hypothesis and the [[Extended Projection Principle]];&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nwachukwu|first=P. Akujuoobi|year=1987|title=The Argument Structure of Igbo Verbs|url=|journal=Lexicon Project Working Papers|volume=18|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the nominal argument is generated in object position, and either it is raised to the subject position, as in (4), or the subject position is filled with a [[Pleonastic pronoun|pleonastic]] pronoun, as in (5).

== Relative clauses ==
Igbo relative clauses are externally headed and follow the head noun. They do not employ overt relative markers or resumptive pronouns, instead leaving a gap in the position of the relativized noun. Subjects and objects can be relativized. Examples include (relative clauses bracketed):&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

(6) Ọ zụ̀-tà-rà àkwa [mā-ra mmā].

: 3sg buy-SUFF-PRF egg [be.good-PRF goodness]
: 'She bought eggs that are good.'

(7) Àkwa [ọ zụ̀-tà-rà] mà-rà mmā.

: egg [3sg buy-SUFF-PRF] good-PRF goodness
: 'The eggs that she bought are good.'

== Voice and valence ==
Igbo lacks the common valence-decreasing operation of [[passivization]], a fact which has led multiple scholars to claim that "voice is not a relevant category in Igbo."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The language does, however, possess some valence-increasing operations that could be construed as [[Voice (grammar)|voice]] under a broader definition

Among the more common valence-changing operations is causativization, which can be expressed in multiple ways. The most common is the verbal root ''mé'' 'do, make,' which forms a compound with the causativized verbal root, as in the (7) below, the causativized form of (6):{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

(8) Ógù a-vó-ọ-la

: Ogu PREF-be.open-SUFF-PRF
: 'Ogu has become disgraced.'

(9) Íbè e-mé-vọ-ọ-la Ogù.

: Ibe PREF-make-be.open-SUFF-PRF Ogu
: 'Ibe has disgraced Ogu.'

A few stative verbs can also be transitivized with the inchoative suffix ''-wa/we'':{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

(10) Àfe isé kò-ro n'ezí.

: clothes five hang-PRF PREP compound
: 'Five items of clothing are hanging in the compound.'

(11) Ókwu kò-we-re afe isé n'ezi.

: Okwu hang-INCH-PRF clothes five PREP compound
: 'Okwu hung five items of clothing in the compound.'

Igbo also possess an applicative construction, which takes the suffix ''-rV'', where ''V'' copies the previous vowel, and the applicative argument follows the verb directly. The applicative suffix is identical in form with the past tense suffix, with which it should not be confused.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

(12) Íbè nye-re-re m Ógù ákwụkwọ.
: Ibe give-PRF-APPL 1sg Ogu book
: 'Ibe gave the book to Ogu for me.'

(12) also illustrates Igbo ditransitive word order. Only a double object construction, wherein the indirect object precedes the direct object, is available, to the exclusion of a prepositional dative alternative. Nwachukwu (1987) speculates for this reason that the critical distinction in Igbo is not, therefore, between direct and indirect objects, but rather between primary and secondary objects.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

== Verb serialization ==
Igbo permits [[Serial verb construction|verb serialization]], which is used extensively to compensate for its paucity of prepositions. Among the meaning types commonly expressed in serial verb constructions are instruments, datives, accompaniment, purpose, and manner. (13) and (14) below illustrate instrumental and dative verb series, respectively:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

(13) Ọ nà-èji mmà à-bacha jī.

: 3sg AUX-PREF-use knife PREF-peel yam
: 'He peels yams with a knife.'

(14) Ọ zụ̀-tà-rà akwụkwọ nye m̄.

: 3sg buy-SUFF-PRF book give 1sg
: 'He bought a book and gave it to me.'

== Writing system ==

[[File:Indomie Igbo Advert, Abia.JPG|thumb|Advertisement in Igbo in [[Abia State]]. Note the use of the letter '''[[ụ]]'''.]]
The Igbo people have long used [[Nsibidi]] [[ideogram]]s, invented by the neighboring [[Ekoi people]], for basic written communication.&lt;ref name="nsibidi"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nmafa.si.edu/exhibits/inscribing/nsibidi.html | work=National Museum of African Art | publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] | title=Nsibidi |quote=Nsibidi is an ancient system of graphic communication indigenous to the Ejagham peoples of southeastern Nigeria and southwestern Cameroon in the Cross River region.

N. |year=1983 |title=The foundations of Igbo studies |publisher=University Publishing Co. |pages=17, 13 |isbn=978-160-264-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nsibidi, however, is not a full writing system, because it cannot transcribe the Igbo language specifically. In 1960 a rural land owner and dibia named Nwagu Aneke developed a syllabary for the Umuleri dialect of Igbo, the script, named after him as the [[Nwagu Aneke script]], was used to write hundreds of diary entries until Aneke's death in 1991. The Nwagu Aneke Project is working on translating Nwagu's commentary and diary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Chukwuma |last=Azuonye |journal=Africana Studies Faculty Publication Series |issue=13 |title=The Nwagu Aneke Igbo Script: Its Origins, Features and Potentials as a Medium of Alternative Literacy in African Languages |publisher=[[University of Massachusetts Boston]] |year=1992 |url=http://scholarworks.umb.edu/africana_faculty_pubs/13/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History of Igbo orthography ===
Before the existence of any official system of orthography for the Igbo language, travelers and writers documented Igbo sounds by utilizing the orthologies of their own languages in transcribing them, though they encountered difficulty representing particular sounds, such as implosives, labialized velars, syllabic nasals, and non-expanded vowels. In the 1850s, German philologist [[Karl Richard Lepsius]] published the [[Standard Alphabet by Lepsius|Standard Alphabet]], which was universal to all languages of the world, and became the first Igbo orthography. It contained 34 letters and included digraphs and diacritical marks to transcribe sounds distinct to African languages.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ohiri-Aniche|first=Chinyere|date=2007|title=Stemming the tide of centrifugal forces in Igbo orthography|url=https://link-springer-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10624-008-9037-x.pdf|journal=Dialect Anthoropol|volume=31|pages=423–436|via=Hollis|doi=10.1007/s10624-008-9037-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lepsius Standard Alphabet contained the following letters:
* a b d e f g h i k l m n o p r s t u v w y z gb gh gw kp kw n̊ nw ny o̥ s ds ts{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}
The Lepsius orthography was replaced by the Practical Orthography of African Languages (Africa Orthography) in 1929 by the colonial government in Nigeria. The new orthography, created by the [[International Institute of African Languages and Culture|International Institute of African Languages and Cultures (IIALC)]], had 36 letters and disposed of diacritic marks. Numerous controversial issues with the new orthography eventually led to its replacement in the early 1960s.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The Africa Orthology contained the following letters:
* a b c d e ɛ f g gb gh h i j k kp l m  n ŋ ny o ɔ ɵ p r s sh t u v w y z gw kw nw{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}
In the early 1960s, a Nigerian government committee created the ''Ọ́nwụ́'' ({{IPA|/oŋwu/}}) orthography, named after committee chairman S.E. O̥nwu̥, to replace the Africa Orthography as the official Igbo orthography. ''Ọ́nwụ́'' ({{IPA|/oŋwu/}}) consists of 28 consonants and 8 vowels. Up until the present, it has been utilized in government publications, academic environments, journalistic mediums, and literary works.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

A variety of issues have made agreement on a standardized [[orthography]] for the Igbo language difficult. In 1976, the Igbo Standardization Committee criticized the official orthography in light of the difficulty notating diacritic marks using typewriters and computers; difficulty in accurately representing tone with tone-marking conventions, as they are subject to change in different environments; and the inability to capture various sounds particular to certain Igbo dialects. Calls for reform have been based in part on the rogue use of alphabetic symbols, tonal notations, and spelling conventions that deviate from the standard orthography.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt; The current ''Ọ́nwụ́'' ({{IPA|/oŋwu/}}) alphabet, a compromise between the older [[Standard Alphabet by Lepsius|Lepsius alphabet]] and a newer alphabet advocated by the [[International Institute of African Languages and Cultures]] (IIALC), is presented in the following table, with the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] equivalents for the characters:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Igbo Dictionary &amp; Phrasebook|last=Awde|first=Nicholas|last2=Wambu|first2=Onyekachi|publisher=Hippocrene Books|year=1999|isbn=0781806615|location=New York|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=April 2017|reason=In the past this used to link to Omniglot, which is a rich source, but not a reliable one. It definitely had wrong information about the alphabet itself. The current source is a published dictionary, and it has reliable information about the letters of the alphabet, but no comprehensive information about the phonology in IPA. A source for the IPA pronunciations must be added.}}

The graphemes {{angle bracket|gb}} and {{angle bracket|kp}} are described both as coarticulated {{IPAslink|ɡ͡b}} and {{IPAslink|k͡p}} and as implosives, so both values are included in the table.

{{angle bracket|m}} and {{angle bracket|n}} each represent two phonemes: a nasal consonant and a syllabic nasal.

Tones are sometimes indicated in writing, and sometimes not. When tone is indicated, low tones are shown with a grave accent over the vowel, for example {{angle bracket|a}} → {{angle bracket|à}}, and high tones with an acute accent over the vowel, for example {{angle bracket|a}} → {{angle bracket|á}}.

There are also some modern movements to restore the use of and modernize nsibidi as a writing system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.nsibiri.org/|title=Nsibidi|website=blog.nsibiri.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sugabellyrocks.com/2013/01/update-on-the-ndebe-igbo-writing-system.html|title=Update on the Ndebe Igbo Writing System - Sugabelly|website=sugabellyrocks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which mostly focus on Igbo as it is the most populous language that used to use nsibidi.

== Proverbs ==
[[Proverb]]s and idiomatic (ilu in Igbo) expressions are highly valued by the Igbo people and proficiency in the language means knowing how to intersperse speech with a good dose of proverbs. [[Chinua Achebe]] (in ''[[Things Fall Apart]]'') describes proverbs as "the [[palm oil]] with which words are eaten". Proverbs are widely used in the traditional society to describe, in very few words, what could have otherwise required a thousand words. Proverbs may also become euphemistic means of making certain expressions in the Igbo society, thus the Igbo have come to typically rely on this as avenues of certain expressions.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== Usage in the diaspora ==
As a consequence of the [[Atlantic slave trade]], the Igbo language was spread by enslaved Igbo people throughout slave colonies in the Americas. These colonies include the [[United States]], [[Cuba]], The [[Dominican Republic]], [[Jamaica]], [[Belize]], [[Barbados]], and the [[Bahamas]]. Examples can be found in [[Jamaican Patois]]: the pronoun {{IPA|/unu/}}, used for 'you (plural)', is taken from Igbo, ''Red eboe'' refers to a fair-skinned black person because of the reported account of a fair or yellowish skin tone among the Igbo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Dictionary of Jamaican English |first=Frederic Gomes |edition=2nd |last=Cassidy |author2=Robert Brock Le Page |publisher=University of the West Indies Press |year=2002 |page=168 |isbn=976-640-127-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_lmFzFgsTZYC&amp;pg=PA168 |accessdate=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Soso'' meaning ''only'' comes from Igbo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Missing Spanish Creoles: Recovering the Birth of Plantation Contact Languages | first=John H. | last=McWhorter |page=77 | isbn=0-520-21999-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=czFufZI4Zx4C&amp;pg=PA77 | publisher=University of California Press | year=2000 |accessdate=2008-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  See [[List of Jamaican Patois words of African origin#Igbo language]] for more examples.

The word ''Bim'', a name for Barbados, was commonly used by enslaved [[Barbadian people|Barbadians]] ([[Barbados|Bajan]]s). This word is said to derive from the Igbo language, derived from ''bi mu'' (or either ''bem'', ''Ndi bem'', ''Nwanyi ibem'' or ''Nwoke ibem'') ({{lang-en|My people}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Caribbean English Usage |first=Richard |last=Allsopp |author2=Jeannette Allsopp |page=101 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PmvSk13sIc0C&amp;pg=PA101 |publisher=University of the West Indies Press |year=2003 |others=Contributor Richard Allsopp |isbn=976-640-145-4 |accessdate=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Carrington, Sean |title=A~Z of Barbados Heritage |year=2007 |publisher=Macmillan Caribbean Publishers Limited|pages=25 |isbn=0-333-92068-6|&lt;!--accessdate=2008-11-23--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it may have other origins (see: [[Barbados#Etymology|Barbados etymology]]).

In [[Cuba]], the Igbo language (along with the [[Efik language]]) continues to be used, albeit in a creolized form, in ceremonies of the [[Abakuá]] society, equivalent or derived from the [[Ekpe]] society in modern Nigeria.

In modern times, Igbo people in the diaspora are putting resources in place to make the study of the language accessible.

== Present state ==
There are some discussions as to whether the Igbo language is in danger of extinction, advanced in part by a 2006 [[UNESCO]] report that predicted the Igbo language will become extinct within 50 years.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Asonye|first=Emma|date=2013|title=UNESCO Prediction of the Igbo Language Death: Facts and Fables|url=http://www.academix.ng/documents/papers/1463491669_1870.pdf|journal=Journal of the Linguistic Association of Nigeria|volume=16| issue =  1 &amp; 2|pages=91–98|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor of African and African Diaspora Literatures at University of Massachusetts, Chukwuma Azuonye, emphasizes indicators for the endangerment of the Igbo language based on criteria that includes the declining population of monolingual elderly speakers; reduced competence and performance among Igbo speakers, especially children; the deterioration of idioms, proverbs, and other rhetorical elements of the Igbo language that convey the cultural aesthetic; and code-switching, code-mixing, and language shift.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Azuonye|first=Chukwuma|date=2002|title=Igbo as an Endangered Language|url=http://scholarworks.umb.edu/africana_faculty_pubs/17|journal=Africana Studies Faculty Publication Series|volume=17|pages=41–68|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

External and internal factors have been proposed as causes of the decline of Igbo language usage. Preference for the English language in post-colonial Nigeria has usurped the Igbo language's role and function in society,&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; as English is perceived by Igbo speakers as the language of status and opportunity.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This perception may be a contributor to the negative attitude towards the Igbo language by its speakers across the spectrum of socio-economic classes.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;  Igbo children's reduced competence and performance has been attributed in part to the lack of exposure in the home environment, which impacts intergenerational transmission of the language.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; English is the official language in Nigeria and is utilized in government administration, educational institutions, and commerce. Aside from its role in numerous facets of daily life in Nigeria, globalization exerts pressure to utilize English as a universal standard language in support of economic and technological advancement.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; A 2005 study by Igboanusi and Peter demonstrated the preferential attitude towards English over the Igbo language amongst Igbo people in the communication, entertainment, and media domains. English was preferred by Igbo speakers at 56.5% for oral communication, 91.5% for written communication, 55.5–59.5% in entertainment, and 73.5–83.5% for media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Igboanusi|first=Herbert|date=2008|title=Is Igbo an endangered language?|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/mult.2006.25.issue-4/multi.2006.023/multi.2006.023.xml|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural and Interlanguage Communication|volume=25.4|pages=443–452|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of English on Igbo languages amongst bilingual Igbo speakers can be seen by the incorporation of English loanwords into Igbo and code-switching between the two languages. English loanwords, which are usually nouns, have been found to retain English semantics, but typically follow phonological and morphological structures of Igbo. Lexical items conform to the vowel harmony intrinsic to Igbo phonological structures. For example, loanwords with syllable-final consonants may be assimilated by the addition of a vowel after the consonant, and vowels are inserted in between consonant clusters, which have not been found to occur in Igbo.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This can be seen in the word ''sukulu'', which is a loanword derived from the English word school that has followed the aforementioned pattern of modification when it was assimilated into the Igbo language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ikekeonwu|first=Clara I.|date=Winter 1982|title=Borrowings and Neologisms in Igbo|journal=Anthropological Linguistics|volume=24:4|pages=480–486|jstor=30027647}}&lt;/ref&gt; Code-switching, which involves the insertion of longer English syntactic units into Igbo utterances, may consist of phrases or entire sentences, principally nouns and verbs, that may or may not follow Igbo syntactic patterns. Igbo affixes to English verbs determine tense and aspectual markers, such as the Igbo suffix -i affixed to the English word check, expressed as the word CHECK-i.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Akere|first=Funso|date=1981|title=Sociolinguistic consequences of language contact: English versus Nigerian Languages|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0388000181800034|journal=Language Sciences|volume=3:2|pages=283–304|via=|doi=10.1016/S0388-0001(81)80003-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standardized Igbo language is composed of fragmented features from numerous Igbo dialects and is not technically a spoken language, but it is used in communicational, educational, and academic contexts. This unification is perceived by Chukwuma Azuonye as undermining the survival of Igbo by erasing diversity between dialects.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Each individual dialect possesses unique untranslatable idioms and rhetorical devices that represent Igbo cultural nuances that can be lost as dialects disappear or deteriorate.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  Newly coined terms may fail to conform to a dialect's lexical formation in assimilating loan words.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Proverbs are an essential component of the Igbo language that convey cultural wisdom and contextual significance to linguistic expression. Everyday usage of Igbo proverbs has declined in recent generations of speakers, which threatens loss in intergenerational transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Obadan|first=Maria I.|date=2015|title=Language Endangerment: Issues of Igbo Proverbs|url=http://www.sciedu.ca/journal/index.php/elr/article/view/7283|journal=English Linguistics Research|volume=4.3|pages=1–12|via=|doi=10.5430/elr.v4n3p1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study of the Ogwashi dialect of Igbo demonstrated a steep decline in youth's knowledge and use of proverbs compared to elder speakers.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In this study, youths employed simplified or incomplete proverbial expressions, lacked a diverse proverbial repertoire, and were deficient in their understanding of proper contextual usages as compared to elders who demonstrated competence to enhance linguistic expression with a diverse vocabulary of proverbs.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39965">'''Immersion''' into [[virtual reality]] is a perception of being physically [[Presence (telepresence)|present]] in a non-physical world. The perception is created by surrounding the user of the VR system in images, sound or other [[Stimulation|stimuli]] that provide an engrossing total environment.

The name is a metaphoric use of the experience of [[wikt:submerge|submersion]] applied to representation, fiction or simulation. Immersion can also be defined as the state of consciousness where a "visitor" ([[Maurice Benayoun]]) or "immersant" ([[Char Davies]])'s awareness of physical self is transformed by being surrounded in an artificial environment; used for describing partial or complete [[suspension of disbelief]], enabling action or reaction to stimulations encountered in a virtual or artistic environment. The degree to which the virtual or artistic environment faithfully reproduces reality determines the degree of suspension of disbelief. The greater the suspension of disbelief, the greater the degree of presence achieved.

[[File:Head-mounted display and wired gloves, Ames Research Center.jpg|right|thumb|Classic [[Virtual reality]] HMD]]
According to [[Ernest W. Adams]], author and consultant on [[game design]],&lt;ref name=ernest&gt;{{cite web | last =Adams | first =Ernest | title =Postmodernism and the Three Types of Immersion | publisher =[[Gamasutra]] | date =July 9, 2004 | url =http://designersnotebook.com/Columns/063_Postmodernism/063_postmodernism.htm | accessdate =2007-12-26 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071024225651/http://www.designersnotebook.com/Columns/063_Postmodernism/063_postmodernism.htm | archivedate =October 24, 2007 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; immersion can be separated into three main categories:

;Tactical immersion
:Tactical immersion is experienced when performing tactile operations that involve skill. Players feel "in the zone" while perfecting actions that result in success.

;Strategic immersion
:Strategic immersion is more cerebral, and is associated with mental challenge. Chess players experience strategic immersion when choosing a correct solution among a broad array of possibilities.

;Narrative immersion
:Narrative immersion occurs when players become invested in a story, and is similar to what is experienced while reading a book or watching a movie.

Staffan Björk and Jussi Holopainen, in ''Patterns In Game Design'',&lt;ref name=bjork&gt;{{cite book | last =Björk | first =Staffan |author2=Jussi Holopainen | title =Patterns In Game Design | publisher =Charles River Media | year =2004 | page =206 | url = {{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=IFQfyODK4wAC }} | isbn =1-58450-354-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; divide immersion into similar categories, but call them '''sensory-motoric immersion''', '''cognitive immersion''' and '''emotional immersion''', respectively. In addition to these, they add a new category:

;Spatial immersion
:Spatial immersion occurs when a player feels the simulated world is perceptually convincing. The player feels that he or she is really "there" and that a simulated world looks and feels "real".

Presence, a term derived from the shortening of the original "[[telepresence]]", is a phenomenon enabling people to interact with and feel connected to the world outside their physical bodies via technology. It is defined as a person's '''subjective sensation''' of being there in a scene depicted by a medium, usually virtual in nature.&lt;ref name=barfield&gt;{{cite book | last=Barfield | first=Woodrow | last2=Zeltzer | first2=David | last3=Sheridan | first3=Thomas | last4=Slater | first4=Mel | editor1-last=Barfield | editor1-first=Woodrow | editor2-last = Furness, III | editor2-first=Thomas A. | title=Virtual Environments and Advanced Interface Design | chapter=Presence and Performance Within Virtual Environments | publisher = Oxford University Press | year=1995 | page=473 | url = {{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=OLE-4j3tHi0C}} | isbn=0195075552}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most designers focus on the technology used to create a high-fidelity virtual environment; however, the human factors involved in achieving a state of presence must be taken into account as well. It is the subjective perception, although generated by and/or filtered through human-made technology, that ultimately determines the successful attainment of presence.&lt;ref name=Thornson&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Thornson | first1=Carol | last2=Goldiez |first2=Brian | date=January 2009 | title=Predicting presence: Constructing the Tendency toward Presence Inventory | url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2008.08.006 |journal=International Journal of Human Computer Studies | volume=67 | issue=1 | pages=62-78 | doi=10.1016/j.ijhcs.2008.08.006 | access-date= 19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtual reality glasses can produce a visceral feeling of being in a simulated world, a form of spatial immersion called Presence. According to [[Oculus VR]], the technology requirements to achieve this visceral reaction are low-latency and precise tracking of movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/oculus-rift-dev-kit-2-now-on-sale-for-350/|title=Oculus Rift Dev Kit 2 now on sale for $350|author=Seth Rosenblatt|date=19 March 2014|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328041627/http://www.cnet.com/news/oculus-rift-dev-kit-2-now-on-sale-for-350/|archivedate=28 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashgear.com/oculus-rift-dk2-hands-on-and-first-impressions-19321282/|title=Oculus Rift DK2 hands-on and first-impressions|work=SlashGear}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oculusvr.com/blog/announcing-the-oculus-rift-development-kit-2-dk2/|title=Announcing the Oculus Rift Development Kit 2 (DK2)|author=|date=|website=oculusvr.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913045405/http://www.oculusvr.com/blog/announcing-the-oculus-rift-development-kit-2-dk2/|archivedate=13 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[http://media.steampowered.com/apps/abrashblog/Abrash%20Dev%20Days%202014.pdf What VR could, should, and almost certainly will be within two years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320175550/http://media.steampowered.com/apps/abrashblog/Abrash%20Dev%20Days%202014.pdf |date=2014-03-20 }}''&lt;/ref&gt; According to the VR research team at [[Valve Corporation|Valve]], all of the following are needed to establish presence.
* A wide field of view (80 degrees or better)
* Adequate resolution (1080p or better)
* Low pixel persistence (3 ms or less)
* A high enough refresh rate (&gt;60&amp;nbsp;Hz, 95&amp;nbsp;Hz is enough but less may be adequate)
* Global display where all pixels are illuminated simultaneously (rolling display may work with eye tracking.)
* Optics (at most two lenses per eye with trade-offs, ideal optics not practical using current technology)
* Optical calibration
* Rock-solid tracking – translation with millimeter accuracy or better, orientation with quarter degree accuracy or better, and volume of 1.5 meter or more on a side
* Low latency (20 ms motion to last photon, 25 ms may be good enough)

== Immersive virtual reality ==
[[File:CAVE Crayoland.jpg|thumb|The [[Cave Automatic Virtual Environment]]]]
'''Immersive virtual reality''' is a hypothetical future technology that exists today as [[virtual reality]] art projects, for the most part.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Nechvatal]], ''Immersive Ideals / Critical Distances''. [[LAP Lambert Academic Publishing]]. 2009, pp. 367-368&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of immersion in an [[Simulation|artificial]] environment where the user feels just as immersed as they usually feel in [[consensus reality]].

=== Direct interaction of the nervous system ===
The most considered method would be to induce the sensations that made up the [[virtual reality]] in the [[nervous system]] directly. In [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]]/conventional [[biology]] we interact with [[consensus reality]] through the [[nervous system]]. Thus we receive all input from all the senses as nerve impulses.
It gives your neurons a feeling of heightened sensation. It would involve the user receiving inputs as artificially stimulated [[nerve]] impulses, the system would receive the CNS outputs (natural nerve impulses) and process them allowing the user to interact with the [[virtual reality]]. Natural impulses between the body and [[central nervous system]] would need to be prevented. This could be done by blocking out natural impulses using nanorobots which attach themselves to the brain wiring, whilst receiving the digital impulses of which describe the virtual world, which could then be sent into the wiring of the brain. A [[feedback]] system between the user and the computer which stores the information would also be needed. Considering how much information would be required for such a system, it is likely that it would be based on hypothetical forms of computer technology.

=== Requirements ===
;Understanding of the nervous system
A comprehensive understanding of which nerve impulses correspond to which sensations, and which motor impulses correspond to which muscle contractions will be required. This will allow the correct sensations in the user, and actions in the virtual reality to occur. The [[Blue Brain Project]] is the current, most promising research with the idea of understanding how the brain works by building very large scale computer models.

;Ability to manipulate [[Central nervous system|CNS]]
The [[nervous system]] would obviously need to be manipulated. Whilst non-invasive devices using radiation have been postulated, invasive cybernetic implants are likely to become available sooner and be more accurate.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} Manipulation could occur at any stage of the nervous system – the spinal cord is likely to be simplest; as all nerves pass through here, this could be the only site of manipulation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}
[[Molecular nanotechnology]] is likely to provide the degree of precision required and could allow the implant to be built inside the body rather than be inserted by an operation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

;Computer hardware/software to process inputs/outputs
A very powerful computer would be necessary for processing virtual reality complex enough to be nearly indistinguishable from consensus reality and interacting with central nervous system fast enough.

== Immersive digital environments ==

[[File:COSMOPOLIS.jpg|right|thumb|Cosmopolis (2005), [[Maurice Benayoun]]'s Giant Virtual Reality Interactive Installation]]
An '''immersive digital environment''' is an [[Simulation|artificial]], [[interactive]], computer-created [[cut scene|scene]] or "world" within which a user can immerse themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Nechvatal]], ''Immersive Ideals / Critical Distances''. [[LAP Lambert Academic Publishing]]. 2009, pp. 48-60&lt;/ref&gt;

Immersive digital environments could be thought of as synonymous with [[virtual reality]], but without the implication that actual "reality" is being simulated. An immersive digital environment could be a model of [[reality]], but it could also be a complete fantasy [[user interface]] or [[abstraction]], as long as the user of the environment is immersed within it. The definition of immersion is wide and variable, but here it is assumed to mean simply that the user feels like they are part of the simulated "[[universe]]". The success with which an immersive digital environment can actually immerse the [[User (computing)|user]] is dependent on many factors such as believable [[3D computer graphics]], [[surround sound]], interactive user-input and other factors such as simplicity, functionality and potential for enjoyment. New technologies are currently under development which claim to bring realistic environmental effects to the players' environment – effects like wind, seat vibration and ambient lighting.

=== Perception ===
To create a sense of full immersion, the 5 senses (sight, sound, touch, smell, taste) must perceive the digital environment to be physically real.  [[Immersive technology]] can perceptually fool the senses through:
* Panoramic 3D displays (visual)
* Surround sound acoustics (auditory)
* Haptics and force feedback (tactile)
* Smell replication (olfactory)
* Taste replication (gustation)

=== Interaction ===
Once the senses reach a sufficient belief that the digital environment is real (it is interaction and involvement which can never be real), the user must then be able to interact with the environment in a natural, intuitive manner.  Various [[immersive technologies]] such as gestural controls, motion tracking, and computer vision respond to the user's actions and movements.  Brain control interfaces (BCI) respond to the user's brainwave activity.

=== Examples and applications ===
Training and rehearsal simulations run the gamut from part task procedural training (often buttonology, for example:  which button do you push to deploy a refueling boom) through situational simulation (such as crisis response or convoy driver training) to full motion simulations which train pilots or soldiers and law enforcement in scenarios that are too dangerous to train in actual equipment using live ordinance.

[[Computer games]] from simple arcade to [[massively multiplayer online game]] and training programs such as [[Flight simulator|flight]] and [[Driving simulator|driving]] simulators. Entertainment environments such as motion simulators that immerse the riders/players in a virtual digital environment enhanced by motion, visual and aural cues. Reality simulators, such as one of the [[Virunga Mountains]] in [[Rwanda]] that takes you on a trip through the jungle to meet a tribe of [[mountain gorilla]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pulseworks.com/Film_Library.html pulseworks.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505131611/http://pulseworks.com/Film_Library.html |date=2009-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Or training versions such as one which simulates taking a ride through human arteries and the [[heart]] to witness the buildup of [[Atheromatous plaque|plaque]] and thus learn about [[cholesterol]] and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usagainstathero.com/arteryexplorer/index.aspx|title=Thank You|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel with scientist, artists like [[Knowbotic Research]], [[Donna Cox]], [[Rebecca Allen (artist)|Rebecca Allen]], [[Robbie Cooper]], [[Maurice Benayoun]],
[[Char Davies]], and [[Jeffrey Shaw]] use the potential of immersive virtual reality to create physiologic or symbolic experiences and situations.

Other examples of immersion technology include physical environment / immersive space with surrounding digital projections and sound such as the [[Cave Automatic Virtual Environment|CAVE]], and the use of [[virtual reality headset]]s for viewing movies, with head-tracking and computer control of the image presented, so that the viewer appears to be inside the scene. The next generation is VIRTSIM, which achieves total immersion through motion capture and wireless head mounted displays for teams of up to thirteen immersants enabling natural movement through space and interaction in both the virtual and physical space simultaneously.

==== Use in medical care ====

New fields of studies linked to the immersive virtual reality emerges every day. Researchers see a great potential in virtual reality tests serving as complementary interview methods in psychiatric care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/a0036240| title = The use of immersive virtual reality (VR) to predict the occurrence 6 months later of paranoid thinking and posttraumatic stress symptoms assessed by self-report and interviewer methods: A study of individuals who have been physically assaulted| journal = Psychological Assessment| volume = 26| issue = 3| pages = 841| year = 2014| last1 = Freeman | first1 = D. | last2 = Antley | first2 = A. | last3 = Ehlers | first3 = A. | last4 = Dunn | first4 = G. | last5 = Thompson | first5 = C. | last6 = Vorontsova | first6 = N. | last7 = Garety | first7 = P. | last8 = Kuipers | first8 = E. | last9 = Glucksman | first9 = E. | last10 = Slater | first10 = M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Applications in the built environment ====
In the domain of architectural design and [[building science]], immersive virtual environments are adopted  to facilitate architects and building engineers to enhance the design process through assimilating their sense of scale, depth,&amp;nbsp;and [[spatial awareness]].

== Detrimental effects ==

[[Simulation sickness]], or simulator sickness, is a condition where a person exhibits symptoms similar to motion sickness caused by playing computer/simulation/video games (Oculus Rift is working to solve simulator sickness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/8/19/4636508/oculus-rift-is-working-to-solve-simulator-sickness|title=Oculus Rift is working to solve simulator sickness|publisher=Polygon|date=|accessdate=2015-05-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924142134/http://www.polygon.com/2013/8/19/4636508/oculus-rift-is-working-to-solve-simulator-sickness|archivedate=2015-09-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Motion sickness]] due to virtual reality is very similar to simulation sickness and motion sickness due to films. In virtual reality, however, the effect is made more acute as all external reference points are blocked from vision, the simulated images are three-dimensional and in some cases stereo sound that may also give a sense of motion. Studies have shown that exposure to rotational motions in a virtual environment can cause significant increases in nausea and other symptoms of motion sickness.&lt;ref&gt;So, R.H.Y. and Lo, W.T. (1999) "Cybersickness: An Experimental Study to Isolate the Effects of Rotational Scene Oscillations." Proceedings of IEEE Virtual Reality '99 Conference, March 13–17, 1999, Houston, Texas. Published by IEEE Computer Society, pp.&amp;nbsp;237–241&lt;/ref&gt;

Other behavioural changes such as stress, [[Virtual Reality Addiction|addiction]], isolation and mood changes are also discussed to be side-effects caused by immersive virtual reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agocg.ac.uk/reports/virtual/37/37.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218043150/http://www.agocg.ac.uk/reports/virtual/37/37.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''James Bond''''' series focuses on a fictional [[Secret Intelligence Service|British Secret Service]] agent created in 1953 by writer [[Ian Fleming]], who featured him in twelve novels and two short-story collections. Since Fleming's death in 1964, eight other authors have written authorised Bond novels or novelizations: [[Kingsley Amis]], [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]], [[John Gardner (British writer)|John Gardner]], [[Raymond Benson]], [[Sebastian Faulks]], [[Jeffery Deaver]], [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]] and [[Anthony Horowitz]]. The latest novel is ''[[Trigger Mortis]]'' by Anthony Horowitz, published in September 2015. Additionally [[Charlie Higson]] wrote a series on [[Young Bond|a young James Bond]], and [[Samantha Weinberg|Kate Westbrook]] wrote three novels based on the [[The Moneypenny Diaries|diaries of a recurring series character]], [[Miss Moneypenny|Moneypenny]].

The character has also been adapted for television, radio, comic strip, video games and film. The films are the longest continually running film series of all time and have grossed over $7.040 billion in total, making it the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing franchises and film series|fourth-highest-grossing film series]] to date, which started in 1962 with ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', starring [[Sean Connery]] as Bond. As of {{CURRENTYEAR}}, there have been twenty-four films in the [[Eon Productions]] [[James Bond in film|series]]. The most recent Bond film, ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' (2015), stars [[Daniel Craig]] in his fourth portrayal of Bond; he is the sixth actor to play Bond in the Eon series. There have also been two independent productions of Bond films: ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (a 1967 [[Parody|spoof]]) and ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' (a 1983 remake of an earlier Eon-produced film, ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]''). In 2015 the series was estimated to be worth $19.9 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adejobi|first=Alicia|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/spectre-movie-james-bond-brand-worth-13bn-off-back-monster-box-office-dvd-sales-1525914|title=Spectre movie: James Bond brand worth £13bn off the back of monster box office and DVD sales|publisher=[[International Business Times]]|date=27 October 2015|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; making ''James Bond'' one of the [[List of the highest-grossing media franchises|highest-grossing media franchises of all time]].

The Bond films are renowned for a number of features, including the musical accompaniment, with the theme songs having received [[Academy Award]] nominations on several occasions, and two wins. Other important elements which run through most of the films include Bond's cars, his guns, and the gadgets with which he is supplied by [[Q (James Bond)|Q Branch]]. The films are also noted for Bond's relationships with various women, who are sometimes referred to as "[[Bond girl]]s".

==Publication history==

===Creation and inspiration===
{{Main|James Bond (literary character)|Inspirations for James Bond}}
Ian Fleming created the fictional character of James Bond as the central figure for his works. Bond is an intelligence officer in the [[Secret Intelligence Service]], commonly known as MI6. Bond is known by his code number, 007, and was a [[Royal Naval Reserve]] [[Commander (Royal Navy)|Commander]]. Fleming based his fictional creation on a number of individuals he came across during his time in the [[Naval Intelligence Division]] during the Second World War, admitting that Bond "was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war".&lt;ref name=" Macintyre (2008)"/&gt; Among those types were his brother, [[Peter Fleming (writer)|Peter]], who had been involved in behind-the-lines operations in [[Norway in World War II|Norway]] and [[Greece in World War II|Greece]] during the war.&lt;ref name="PF Obit (1971)"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary: Colonel Peter Fleming, Author and explorer|newspaper= The Times|date=20 August 1971|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from Fleming's brother, a number of others also provided some aspects of Bond's make up, including [[Conrad O'Brien-ffrench]], [[Patrick Dalzel-Job]] and [[Wilfred Dunderdale|Bill "Biffy" Dunderdale]].&lt;ref name= " Macintyre (2008)"/&gt;

The name James Bond came from that of the American [[ornithologist]] [[James Bond (ornithologist)|James Bond]], a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive [[field guide]] ''[[Birds of the West Indies]]''. Fleming, a keen [[Birdwatching|birdwatcher]] himself, had a copy of Bond's guide and he later explained to the ornithologist's wife that "It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born".{{sfn|Caplen|2010|p=21}} He further explained that:

{{Quote|text= When I wrote the first one in 1953, I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened; I wanted him to be a blunt instrument&amp;nbsp;... when I was casting around for a name for my protagonist I thought by God, [James Bond] is the dullest name I ever heard.|sign= Ian Fleming|source=''[[The New Yorker]]'', 21 April 1962&lt;ref name="Hellman (1962)"&gt;{{cite web |last= Hellman |first=Geoffrey T. |title= Bond's Creator |url= http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1962/04/21/1962_04_21_032_TNY_CARDS_000268062 |id= section "Talk of the Town" |work= The New Yorker |accessdate=9 September 2011 |authorlink=Geoffrey T. Hellman|page=32|date= 21 April 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On another occasion, Fleming said: "I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, 'James Bond' was much better than something more interesting, like 'Peregrine Carruthers'. Exotic things would happen to and around him, but he would be a neutral figure—an anonymous, blunt instrument wielded by a government department."{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=112}}

[[File:Hoagy Carmichael - 1947.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hoagy Carmichael]]—Fleming's view of James Bond]]
Fleming decided that Bond should resemble both American singer [[Hoagy Carmichael]] and himself{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=67}} and in [[Casino Royale (novel)|''Casino Royale'']], [[Vesper Lynd]] remarks, "Bond reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael, but there is something cold and ruthless." Likewise, in [[Moonraker (novel)|''Moonraker'']], [[Special Branch]] Officer [[Gala Brand]] thinks that Bond is "certainly good-looking&amp;nbsp;... Rather like Hoagy Carmichael in a way. That black hair falling down over the right eyebrow. Much the same bones. But there was something a bit cruel in the mouth, and the eyes were cold."{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=67}}

Fleming endowed Bond with many of his own traits, including sharing the same golf handicap, the taste for scrambled eggs and using the same brand of toiletries.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=50}} Bond's tastes are also often taken from Fleming's own as was his behaviour,&lt;ref name="Cook (2004)"&gt;{{cite news |last=Cook |first=William |title=Novel man |newspaper=[[New Statesman]] |date=28 June 2004|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Bond's love of golf and gambling mirroring Fleming's own. Fleming used his experiences of his espionage career and all other aspects of his life as inspiration when writing, including using names of school friends, acquaintances, relatives and lovers throughout his books.&lt;ref name=" Macintyre (2008)"/&gt;

It was not until the penultimate novel, ''[[You Only Live Twice (novel)|You Only Live Twice]]'', that Fleming gave Bond a sense of family background. The book was the first to be written after the release of [[Dr. No (film)|''Dr. No'']] in cinemas and [[Sean Connery]]'s depiction of Bond affected Fleming's interpretation of the character, to give Bond both a sense of humour and Scottish antecedents that were not present in the previous stories.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=205}} In a fictional obituary, purportedly published in ''[[The Times]]'', Bond's parents were given as Andrew Bond, from the village of [[Glencoe, Highland|Glencoe]], [[Scotland]], and Monique Delacroix, from the canton of [[Vaud]], Switzerland.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=59}} Fleming did not provide Bond's date of birth, but [[John Pearson (author)|John Pearson]]'s fictional biography of Bond, ''[[James Bond: The Authorized Biography of 007]]'', gives Bond a birth date on 11 November 1920,{{sfn|Pearson|2008|p=21}} while a study by John Griswold puts the date at 11 November 1921.{{sfn|Griswold|2006|p=27}}

====Ian Fleming novels====
[[File:GoldeneyeEstate.jpg|thumb|right|[[Goldeneye (estate)|Goldeneye]], in Jamaica, where Fleming wrote all the Bond novels{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=208}}]]
Whilst serving in the Naval Intelligence Division, Fleming had planned to become an author&lt;ref name="Lycett (DNB)"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Lycett |first=Andrew|title=Fleming, Ian Lancaster (1908–1964) (subscription needed)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33168|work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=7 September 2011|authorlink=Andrew Lycett|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/33168|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had told a friend, "I am going to write the spy story to end all spy stories."&lt;ref name=" Macintyre (2008)"&gt;{{cite news|last=Macintyre|first=Ben|title= Bond – the real Bond|newspaper=[[The Times]]|page=36|date=5 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 February 1952, he began writing his first James Bond novel, ''Casino Royale'', at his [[Goldeneye (estate)|Goldeneye estate]] in Jamaica,{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=4}} where he wrote all his Bond novels during the months of January and February each year.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=5}} He started the story shortly before his wedding to his pregnant girlfriend, Ann Charteris, in order to distract himself from his forthcoming nuptials.{{sfn|Bennett|Woollacott|2003|p=1|loc=ch 1}}

After completing the manuscript for ''Casino Royale'', Fleming showed the manuscript to his friend (and later editor) [[William Plomer]] to read. Plomer liked it and submitted it to the publishers, [[Jonathan Cape]], who did not like it as much. Cape finally published it in 1953 on the recommendation of Fleming's older brother [[Peter Fleming (writer)|Peter]], an established travel writer.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=5}} Between 1953 and 1966, two years after his death, twelve novels and two short-story collections were published, with the last two books – ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (novel)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'' and ''[[Octopussy and The Living Daylights]]'' – published posthumously.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=75}} All the books were published in the UK through Jonathan Cape.

===Comics===

[[File:McLusky007.jpg|thumb|upright|right|John McLusky's rendition of James Bond]]
In 1957 the ''[[Daily Express]]'' approached Ian Fleming to adapt his stories into comic strips, offering him £1,500 per novel and a share of takings from syndication.{{sfn|Jütting|2007|p=6}} After initial reluctance, Fleming, who felt the strips would lack the quality of his writing, agreed.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=316}} To aid the ''Daily Express'' in illustrating Bond, Fleming commissioned an artist to create a sketch of how he believed James Bond looked. The illustrator, [[John McLusky]], however, felt that Fleming's 007 looked too "outdated" and "pre-war" and changed Bond to give him a more masculine look.{{sfn|Simpson|2002|p=21}} The first strip, ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' was published from 7 July 1958 to 13 December 1958{{sfn|Fleming|Gammidge|McLusky|1988|p=6}} and was written by Anthony Hern and illustrated by John McLusky.{{sfn|Jütting|2007|p=7}}

Most of the Bond novels and short stories have since been adapted for illustration, as well as Kingsley Amis's ''Colonel Sun''; the works were written by [[Henry Gammidge]] or Jim Lawrence with [[Yaroslav Horak]] replacing McClusky as artist in 1966.{{sfn|Fleming|Gammidge|McLusky|1988|p=6}} After the Fleming and Amis material had been adapted, original stories were produced, continuing in the ''Daily Express'' and ''[[Sunday Express]]'' until May 1977.{{sfn|Simpson|2002|p=21}}

Several [[comic book]] adaptations of the James Bond films have been published through the years: at the time of [[Dr. No (film)|''Dr. No'']]'s release in October 1962, a [[comic book]] adaptation of the screenplay, written by Norman J. Nodel, was published in Britain as part of the ''[[Classics Illustrated]]'' anthology series.{{sfn|Conroy|2004|p=293}} It was later reprinted in the United States by [[DC Comics]] as part of its ''[[Showcase (comic book)|Showcase]]'' anthology series, in January 1963. This was the first American comic book appearance of James Bond and is noteworthy for being a relatively rare example of a British comic being reprinted in a fairly high-profile American comic. It was also one of the earliest comics to be censored on racial grounds (some skin tones and dialogue were changed for the American market).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2006_12_03.html |title=Secrets Behind the Comics |first=Mark |last=Evanier |authorlink=Mark Evanier |publisher=NewsFromme.com |date=3 December 2006 |accessdate=4 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021094626/http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2006_12_03.html |archivedate=21 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Conroy|2004|p=293}}

With the release of the 1981 film [[For Your Eyes Only (film)|''For Your Eyes Only'']], [[Marvel Comics]] published a two-issue [[comic book]] adaptation of the film.{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=131}}{{sfn|Thompson|Frankenhoff|Bickford|2010|p=368}} When ''[[Octopussy]]'' was released in the cinemas in 1983, Marvel published an accompanying comic;{{sfn|Conroy|2004|p=293}} Eclipse also produced a one-off comic for ''Licence to Kill'', although Timothy Dalton refused to allow his likeness to be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bond Violence Gets Artistic 'Licence'|newspaper=[[The Palm Beach Post]]|date=28 July 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Bond stories were also drawn up and published from 1989 onwards through Marvel, [[Eclipse Comics]] and [[Dark Horse Comics]].{{sfn|Conroy|2004|p=293}}{{sfn|Thompson|Frankenhoff|Bickford|2010|p=368}}

In 1973 [[Roger Moore]] was appointed to the role of 007 for [[Live and Let Die (film)|''Live and Let Die'']] and played Bond a further six times over twelve years before being replaced by [[Timothy Dalton]] for two films. After a six-year hiatus, during which a legal wrangle threatened Eon's productions of the Bond films,{{sfn|Simpson|2002|p=81}} Irish actor [[Pierce Brosnan]] was cast as Bond in ''[[GoldenEye]]'', released in 1995; he remained in the role for a total of four films, before leaving in 2002.

====Non-Eon films====
In 1967 [[Casino Royale (1967 film)|''Casino Royale'']] was adapted into a [[parody]] Bond film starring [[David Niven]] as Sir James Bond and [[Ursula Andress]] as Vesper Lynd. Niven had been Fleming's preference for the role of Bond.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=202}} The result of a court case in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] in London in 1963 allowed [[Kevin McClory]] to produce a remake of [[Thunderball (film)|''Thunderball'']] titled ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' in 1983.&lt;ref name="Poliakoff (2000)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poliakoff |first=Keith |title=License to Copyright – The Ongoing Dispute Over the Ownership of James Bond |journal=Cardozo Arts &amp; Entertainment Law Journal |publisher=[[Benjamin N.

==Guns, vehicles and gadgets==
{{Main|List of James Bond vehicles|List of James Bond gadgets}}

===Guns===
For the first five novels, Fleming armed Bond with a [[Beretta 418]]{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=265}} until he received a letter from a thirty-one-year-old Bond enthusiast and gun expert, [[Geoffrey Boothroyd]], criticising Fleming's choice of firearm for Bond,{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=160}} calling it "a lady's gun – and not a very nice lady at that!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bond's unsung heroes: Geoffrey Boothroyd, the real Q|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/jamesbond/5320024/Bonds-unsung-heroes-Geoffrey-Boothroyd-the-real-Q.html|accessdate=6 November 2011|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=21 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boothroyd suggested that Bond should swap his [[Beretta]] for a [[Walther PP]]K 7.65mm and this exchange of arms made it to ''Dr. No''.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=132}} Boothroyd also gave Fleming advice on the [[Berns-Martin]] triple draw shoulder holster and a number of the weapons used by SMERSH and other villains.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=15}} In thanks, Fleming gave the MI6 Armourer in his novels the name Major Boothroyd and, in ''Dr. No'', M introduces him to Bond as "the greatest small-arms expert in the world".{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=132}} Bond also used a variety of [[rifle]]s, including the [[Savage Model 99]] in "For Your Eyes Only" and a Winchester .308 target rifle in "The Living Daylights".{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=265}} Other handguns used by Bond in the Fleming books included the [[Colt Detective Special]] and a long-barrelled [[Colt Single Action Army|Colt .45 Army Special]].{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=265}}

The first Bond film, ''Dr. No'', saw M ordering Bond to leave his Beretta behind and take up the Walther PPK,{{sfn|Black|2005|p=94}} which the film Bond used in eighteen films.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=265}} In ''Tomorrow Never Dies'' and the two subsequent films, Bond's main weapon was the [[Walther P99]] [[semi-automatic pistol]].{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=265}}
[[File:Aston.db5.coupe.300pix.jpg|thumb|left|An [[Aston Martin DB5]] as seen in ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]''.]]

===Vehicles===
In the early Bond stories Fleming gave Bond a battleship-grey [[Bentley 4½ Litre|Bentley {{frac|4|1|2}} Litre]] with an [[Amherst Villiers]] [[supercharger]].{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=62-63}} After Bond's car was written off by Hugo Drax in ''Moonraker'', Fleming gave Bond a Mark II Continental Bentley, which he used in the remaining books of the series.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=63}} During ''Goldfinger'', Bond was issued with an [[Aston Martin DB Mark III]] with a homing device, which he used to track Goldfinger across France. Bond returned to his Bentley for the subsequent novels.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=63}}

The Bond of the films has driven a number of cars, including the [[Aston Martin V8 Vantage (1977)|Aston Martin V8 Vantage]],{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=183}} during the 1980s, the [[V12 Vanquish]]{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=183}} and [[Aston Martin DBS V12|DBS]]{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=182}} during the 2000s, as well as the [[Lotus Esprit]];{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=202}} the [[BMW Z3]],{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=186}} [[BMW 750iL]]{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=186}} and the [[BMW Z8]].{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=186}} He has, however, also needed to drive a number of other vehicles, ranging from a [[Citroën 2CV]] to a [[AEC Routemaster|Routemaster]] Bus, amongst others.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=175}}

Bond's most famous car is the silver grey [[Aston Martin DB5]], first seen in ''Goldfinger'';{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=180}} it later featured in ''Thunderball'', ''GoldenEye'', ''Tomorrow Never Dies'', ''Casino Royale'', ''[[Skyfall]]'' and ''Spectre''.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=180-181}}&lt;ref name="Obs: french"&gt;{{cite news|last=French|first=Philip|title=Skyfall – review|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/28/skyfall-james-bond-review|date=28 October 2012|authorlink=Philip French|location=London|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The films have used a number of different Aston Martins for filming and publicity, one of which was sold in January 2006 at an auction in the US for $2,1 million to an unnamed European collector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=James Bond car sold for over £1m|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4633986.stm|accessdate=6 November 2011|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=21 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, another DB5 used in Goldfinger was sold at auction for $4.6m million (£2.6 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/classiccars/8092441/James-Bond-Aston-Martin-DB5-sells-for-2.6m.html|title=James Bond Aston Martin DB5 sells for 拢2.6m|author=Andrew English|date=28 October 2010|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gadgets===
[[File:Little Nellie.jpg|alt=Small, one man, open-cockpit helicopter on a lawn about the size of a car next to it, with a man sitting in it.|thumb|right|The ''Little Nellie'' autogyro with its creator and pilot, [[Ken Wallis]]]]
Fleming's novels and early screen adaptations presented minimal equipment such as the booby-trapped [[attaché case]] in ''From Russia with Love'', although this situation changed dramatically with the films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jenkins|first=Tricia|title=James Bond's "Pussy" and Anglo-American Cold War Sexuality|journal=The Journal of American Culture|date=September 2005|volume=28|issue=3|doi=10.1111/j.1542-734X.2005.00215.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the effects of the two Eon-produced Bond films ''Dr. No'' and ''From Russia with Love'' had an effect on the novel ''The Man with the Golden Gun'', through the increased number of devices used in Fleming's final story.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=234}}

For the film adaptations of Bond, the pre-mission briefing by Q Branch became one of the motifs that ran through the series.{{sfn|Lindner|2009|p=112}} ''Dr. No'' provided no spy-related gadgets, but a [[Geiger counter]] was used; industrial designer Andy Davey observed that the first ever onscreen spy-gadget was the attaché case shown in ''From Russia with Love'', which he described as "a classic 007 product".&lt;ref name="Davey"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davey|first=Andy|title=Left to his own devices|format=abridged from print copy|journal=[[Design Week]]|date=3 October 2002|url=http://www.designweek.co.uk/news/left-to-his-own-devices/1103407.article|accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gadgets assumed a higher profile in the 1964 film ''Goldfinger''. The film's success encouraged further espionage equipment from Q Branch to be supplied to Bond, although the increased use of technology led to an accusation that Bond was over-reliant on equipment, particularly in the later films.{{sfn|Lindner|2009|p=169}}

{{Quote box|quote="If it hadn't been for Q Branch, you'd have been dead long ago!"|source=—Q, to Bond, ''Licence to Kill''|width = 20em||align =left}}
Davey noted that "Bond's gizmos follow the [[zeitgeist]] more closely than any other&amp;nbsp;... nuance in the films"&lt;ref name="Davey"/&gt; as they moved from the potential representations of the future in the early films, through to the brand-name obsessions of the later films.&lt;ref name="Davey"/&gt; It is also noticeable that, although Bond uses a number of pieces of equipment from Q Branch, including the Little Nellie [[autogyro]],{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=200-201}} a [[Jet pack#Bell Textron Rocket Belt|jet pack]]{{sfn|Jütting|2007|p=128}} and the exploding attaché case,{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=221}} the villains are also well-equipped with custom-made devices,&lt;ref name="Davey"/&gt; including Scaramanga's golden gun,{{sfn|Jütting|2007|p=77}} Rosa Klebb's poison-tipped shoes,{{sfn|Griswold|2006|p=41}} Oddjob's steel-rimmed bowler hat{{sfn|Black|2005|p=117}} and Blofeld's communication devices in his agents' vanity case.&lt;ref name="Davey"/&gt;

Cinematically, Bond has been a major influence within the spy genre since the release of ''Dr. No'' in 1962,{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=21}} with 22 secret agent films released in 1966 alone attempting to capitalise on the Bond franchise's popularity and success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moniot|first=Drew|title=James Bond and America in the Sixties: An Investigation of the Formula Film in Popular Culture|journal=Journal of the University Film Association|date=Summer 1976|volume=28|issue=3|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|jstor=20687331|pages=25–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first parody was the 1964 film ''[[Carry On Spying]]'', which shows the villain Dr. Crow being overcome by agents who included James Bind ([[Charles Hawtrey (actor born 1914)|Charles Hawtry]]) and Daphne Honeybutt ([[Barbara Windsor]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Angelini|first=Sergio|title=Carry On Spying (1964)|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/466477/|work=BFI Screenonline|publisher=British Film Institute|accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the films that reacted against the portrayal of Bond was the [[Harry Palmer]] series, whose first film, [[The Ipcress File (film)|''The Ipcress File'']] was released in 1965. The eponymous hero of the series was what academic Jeremy Packer called an "anti-Bond",{{sfn|Packer|2009|p=26}} or what Christoph Lindner calls "the thinking man's Bond".{{sfn|Lindner|2009|p=128}} The Palmer series were produced by Harry Saltzman, who also used key crew members from the Bond series, including designer [[Ken Adam]], editor [[Peter R.

Following the release of the film ''Dr. No'' in 1962, the line "Bond&amp;nbsp;... James Bond", became a [[catch phrase]] that entered the [[lexicon]] of Western popular culture: writers Cork and Scivally said of the introduction in ''Dr. No'' that the "signature introduction would become the most famous and loved film line ever".{{sfn|Cork|Scivally|2002|p=6}} In 2001, it was voted as the "best-loved one-liner in cinema" by British cinema goers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=James Bond tops motto poll|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/1383350.stm|accessdate=4 November 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=11 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2005, it was honoured as the 22nd greatest quotation in cinema history by the [[American Film Institute]] as part of their [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes|100 Years Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Years Series: "Movie Quotes" |url=http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/quotes100.pdf?docID=242 |work=AFI 100 Years Series |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |accessdate=4 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716070844/http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/quotes100.pdf?docID=242 |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2005 [[American Film Institute]]'s '100 Years' series recognised the character of James Bond himself as the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains|third greatest film hero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=100 years series: 100 heroes and villains |url=http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/handv100.pdf?docID=246 |work=AFI 100 Years Series |publisher=American Film Industry |accessdate=8 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67oI7bsRP?url=http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/handv100.pdf?docID=246 |archivedate=20 May 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also placed at number 11 on a similar list by ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 100 Greatest Movie Characters: 11.

Television also saw the effect of Bond films, with the [[NBC]] series ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grigg|first=Richard|title=Vanquishing Evil without the Help of God: The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and a World Come of Age|journal=Journal of Communication &amp; Religion|date=November 2007|volume=30|issue=2|pages=308–339|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was described as the "first network television imitation" of Bond,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Worland|first=Rick|title=The Man From U.N.C.L.E. and TV espionage in the 1960s|journal=[[Journal of Popular Film &amp; Television]]|date=Winter 1994|volume=21|issue=4|pages=150–162|doi=10.1080/01956051.1994.9943983|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; largely because Fleming provided advice and ideas on the development of the series, even giving the main character the name [[Napoleon Solo]].{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=209}} Other 1960s television series inspired by Bond include ''[[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]]'',{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=210}} and ''[[Get Smart]]''.{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=211}}

A [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British cultural icon]], by 2012, James Bond had become such a symbol of the United Kingdom that the character, played by Craig, appeared in the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] of the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 London Olympics]] as Queen [[Elizabeth II]]'s escort.&lt;ref name="brown20120727"&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Nic|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19018666|title=How James Bond whisked the Queen to the Olympics|publisher=[[BBC News]]| date=27 July 2012|accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Action &amp; Mystery exhibition inspired by GREAT British icons|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/world-location-news/action-mystery-exhibition-inspired-by-great-british-icons|agency=Gov.uk|date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IPA notice}}
{{inline audio}}

The [[phonology]] of [[Japanese language|Japanese]] has about 15 [[consonant]] [[phoneme]]s, the cross-linguistically typical five-[[vowel]] system of {{IPA|/a, e, i, o, u/}}, and a relatively simple [[phonotactic]] distribution of phonemes allowing few [[consonant cluster]]s. It is traditionally described as having [[mora (linguistics)|mora]]s as the unit of [[Isochrony|timing]], with each mora taking up about the same length of time, so that the disyllabic {{IPA|[ɲip.poɴ]}} ("Japan") may be analyzed as {{IPA|/niQpoN/}} and dissected into four moras, {{IPA|/ni/}}, {{IPA|/Q/}}, {{IPA|/po/}}, and {{IPA|/N/}}.

Standard Japanese is a [[pitch-accent language]], wherein the position or absence of a pitch drop may determine the meaning of a word: {{IPA|/haꜜsiɡa/}} "chopsticks", {{IPA|/hasiꜜɡa/}} "bridge", {{IPA|/hasiɡa/}} "edge" (see [[Japanese pitch accent]]).

Unless otherwise noted, the following describes the standard variety of Japanese based on the [[Tokyo dialect]].

'''Notes:'''

*Voiceless stops {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} are slightly [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated]]: less aspirated than English stops, but more so than Spanish.{{sfnp|Riney|Takagi|Ota|Uchida|2007}} {{IPA|/p/}}, a remnant of [[Old Japanese]], now occurs only medially in [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese]] compounds, only medially in a few fossil words as a result of the contractions of pronunciations over time (such as [[wikt:河童|河童]] ''kappa''), as well as in [[onomatopoeia]]; as ''[[gairaigo]]'', loanwords of non-Middle Chinese origin, enter the language, {{IPA|/p/}} is increasingly used in [[Transcription into Japanese|transcription]]. {{IPA|/t, d, n/}} are [[Laminal consonant|laminal]] denti-alveolar (that is, the blade of the tongue contacts the back of the upper teeth and the front part of the [[alveolar ridge]]) and {{IPA|/s, z/}} are laminal alveolar. {{IPA|/w/}} is the [[Semivowel|semivocalic]] equivalent of {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|[ɰ]}}, with little to no rounding.
*Consonants inside parentheses are allophones of other phonemes, at least in native words. In loanwords, {{IPA|/ɸ, ɕ, ʑ, t͡s, d͡z, t͡ɕ, d͡ʑ/}} sometimes occur phonemically, outside of the allophonic variation described below.{{sfnp|Labrune|2012|p=59}}
See below for more in-detail descriptions of allophonic variation.
*Before {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/s, t/}} are [[alveolo-palatal]] {{IPA|[ɕ, t͡ɕ]}}, and {{IPA|/z, d/}} are either [[Neutralization (linguistics)|neutralized]] as [[free variation]] between {{IPA|[ʑ]}} and {{IPA|[d͡ʑ]}} or distinct as {{IPA|[ʑ, d͡ʑ]}}. Before {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} is {{IPA|[t͡s]}}, and {{IPA|/d/}} is either merged with {{IPA|/z/}} as free variation between {{IPA|[z]}} and {{IPA|[d͡z]}} or always {{IPA|[d͡z]}} distinct from {{IPA|/z/}}. When geminated, however, {{IPA|/z/}} is always {{IPA|[d͡z]}}.{{sfnp|Vance|2008|p=108}}
*{{IPA|/h/}} is {{IPAblink|ç}} before {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/j/}} {{pronunciation|Hi (Japanese).ogg|listen|(|help=no}}, and {{IPAblink|ɸ}} before {{IPA|/u/}} {{pronunciation|Ja-Fu.oga|listen|(|help=no}},{{sfnp|Okada|1999|p=118}} coarticulated with the labial compression of that vowel.
*{{IPA|/N/}} is a syllable-final [[#Moraic nasal|moraic nasal]] with variable pronunciation depending on what follows.
*Realization of the liquid phoneme {{IPA|/r/}} varies greatly depending on environment and dialect. The prototypical and most common pronunciation is an apical tap, either alveolar {{IPAblink|ɾ}} or postalveolar {{IPAblink|ɾ̠}}.{{sfnp|Labrune|2012|p=92}}{{sfnp|Vance|2008|p=89}}{{sfnp|Okada|1999|p=118}} Utterance-initially and after {{IPA|/N/}}, the tap is typically articulated in such a way that the tip of the tongue is at first momentarily in light contact with the alveolar ridge before being released rapidly by airflow.{{sfnp|Akamatsu|1997|p=106}}{{sfnp|Vance|2008|p=89}} This sound is described variably as a tap, a "variant of {{IPA|[ɾ]}}", "a kind of weak plosive",{{sfnp|Akamatsu|1997|p=106}} and "an affricate with short friction".{{sfnp|Okada|1999|p=118}} The [[Dental, alveolar and postalveolar lateral approximants|apico-alveolar or postalveolar lateral approximant]] {{IPA|[l]}} is a common variant in all conditions,{{sfnp|Okada|1999|p=118}} particularly utterance-initially{{sfnp|Akamatsu|1997|p=106}} and before {{IPA|/i, j/}}.{{sfnp|Labrune|2012|p=92}} According to {{harvcoltxt|Akamatsu|1997}}, utterance-initially and intervocalically (that is, except after {{IPA|/N/}}), the lateral variant is better described as a [[Alveolar lateral flap|tap]] {{IPA|[ɺ]}} rather than an approximant.{{sfnp|Akamatsu|1997|p=106}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Akamatsu|1997}} employs a different symbol, {{IPA|[l̆]}}, for the lateral tap.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[retroflex lateral approximant]] {{IPA|[ɭ]}} is also found before {{IPA|/i, j/}}.{{sfnp|Labrune|2012|p=92}} In Tokyo's [[Tokyo dialect|Shitamachi dialect]], the [[alveolar trill]] {{IPA|[r]}} is a variant marked with vulgarity.{{sfnp|Labrune|2012|p=92}} Other reported variants include the [[alveolar approximant]] {{IPA|[ɹ]}},{{sfnp|Okada|1999|p=118}} the [[Voiced alveolar stop|alveolar stop]] {{IPA|[d]}}, the [[retroflex flap]] {{IPA|[ɽ]}}, the [[Voiced lateral fricative|lateral fricative]] {{IPA|[ɮ]}},{{sfnp|Labrune|2012|p=92}} and the [[Voiced retroflex stop|retroflex stop]] {{IPA|[ɖ]}}.{{sfnp|Arai|Warner|Greenberg|2007|p=48}}

===Weakening===
Non-[[coronal consonant|coronal]] [[voiced consonant|voiced]] [[stop consonant|stops]] {{IPA|/b, ɡ/}} between vowels may be weakened to [[fricative]]s, especially in fast or casual speech:

| {{IPA|/b/}} &gt; [[Voiced bilabial fricative|bilabial fricative]] {{IPA|[β]}}:
| {{IPA|/abareru/}} &gt; {{IPA|[aβaɾeɾɯ]}} ''abareru'' {{lang|ja|暴れる}} 'to behave violently'
|-
| {{IPA|/ɡ/}} &gt; [[Voiced velar fricative|velar fricative]] {{IPA|[ɣ]}}:
| {{IPA|/haɡe/}} &gt; {{IPA|[haɣe]}} ''hage'' {{lang|ja|はげ}} 'baldness'
|}

However, {{IPA|/ɡ/}} is further complicated by its variant realization as a [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|[ŋ]}}. Standard Japanese speakers can be categorized into 3 groups (A, B, C), which will be explained below. If a speaker pronounces a given word consistently with the [[allophone]] {{IPA|[ŋ]}} (i.e. a B-speaker), that speaker will never have {{IPA|[ɣ]}} as an allophone in that same word. If a speaker varies between {{IPA|[ŋ]}} and {{IPA|[ɡ]}} (i.e. an A-speaker) or is generally consistent in using {{IPA|[ɡ]}} (i.e. a C-speaker), then the velar fricative {{IPA|[ɣ]}} is always another possible allophone in fast speech.

{{IPA|/ɡ/}} may be weakened to nasal {{IPA|[ŋ]}} when it occurs within words—this includes not only between vowels but also between a vowel and a consonant. There is a fair amount of variation between speakers, however. {{harvcoltxt|Vance|1987}} suggests that the variation follows social class,{{sfnp|Vance|1987|pp=110–1}} while {{harvcoltxt|Akamatsu|1997}} suggests that the variation follows age and geographic location.{{sfnp|Akamatsu|1997|p=130}} The generalized situation is as follows.

;At the beginning of words:
* all present-day standard Japanese speakers generally use the stop {{IPA|[ɡ]}} at the beginning of words: {{IPA|/ɡaijuu/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ɡaijɯɯ]}} ''gaiyū'' {{lang|ja|外遊}} 'overseas trip' (but not {{IPA|*[ŋaijɯɯ]}})

;In the middle of simple words (i.e. non-[[Compound (linguistics)|compounds]]):
* '''A'''. a majority of speakers uses either {{IPA|[ŋ]}} or {{IPA|[ɡ]}} in free variation: {{IPA|/kaɡu/}} &gt; {{IPA|[kaŋɯ]}} or {{IPA|[kaɡɯ]}} ''kagu'' {{lang|ja|家具}} 'furniture'
* '''B'''. a minority of speakers consistently uses {{IPA|[ŋ]}}: {{IPA|/kaɡu/}} &gt; {{IPA|[kaŋɯ]}} (but not {{IPA|*[kaɡɯ]}})
* '''C'''. most speakers in western Japan and a smaller minority of speakers in Kantō consistently use {{IPA|[ɡ]}}: {{IPA|/kaɡu/}} &gt; {{IPA|[kaɡɯ]}} (but not {{IPA|*[kaŋɯ]}})

'''In the middle of compound words [[morpheme]]-initially:'''
* B-speakers mentioned directly above consistently use {{IPA|[ɡ]}}.

So, for some speakers the following two words are a [[minimal pair]] while for others they are homophonous:

* ''sengo'' {{lang|ja|千五}} (&lt;span lang=ja&gt;せんご&lt;/span&gt;) 'one thousand and five' = {{IPA|[seŋɡo]}} for B-speakers
* ''sengo'' {{lang|ja|戦後}} ({{lang|ja|せんご}}) 'postwar' = {{IPA|[seŋŋo]}} for B-speakers&lt;ref&gt;Japanese academics represent {{IPA|[ɡo]}} as {{lang|ja|ご}} and {{IPA|[ŋo]}} as {{lang|ja|こ゜}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

To summarize using the example of ''hage'' {{lang|ja|はげ}} 'baldness':

* A-speakers: {{IPA|/haɡe/}} &gt; {{IPA|[haŋe]}} or {{IPA|[haɡe]}} or {{IPA|[haɣe]}}
* B-speakers: {{IPA|/haɡe/}} &gt; {{IPA|[haŋe]}}
* C-speakers: {{IPA|/haɡe/}} &gt; {{IPA|[haɡe]}} or {{IPA|[haɣe]}}

Some phonologists posit a distinct phoneme {{IPA|/ŋ/}}, citing pairs such as {{IPA|[oːɡaɾasɯ]}} {{lang|ja|大硝子}} 'big sheet of glass' vs. {{IPA|[oːŋaɾasɯ]}} {{lang|ja|大烏}} 'big raven'.{{sfnp|Shibatani|1990|p=172}}

===Palatalization and affrication===
The palatals {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/j/}} palatalize the consonants preceding them:{{sfnp|Okada|1999|p=118}}

:{| cellpadding="3"
| {{IPA|/m/}} &gt; [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] {{IPA|[mʲ]}}:

| {{IPA|/ɡjoːza/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ɡʲoːza]}} ''gyōza'' {{lang|ja|ぎょうざ}} 'fried dumpling'
|-
| etc.
|
|}

For [[coronal consonant]]s, the palatalization goes further so that [[alveolo-palatal consonant]]s correspond with dental or alveolar consonants ({{IPA|[ta]}} 'field' vs. {{IPA|[t͡ɕa]}} 'tea'):{{sfnp|Itō|Mester|1995|p=827}}

|}

{{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/j/}} also palatalize {{IPA|/h/}} to a [[Voiceless palatal fricative|palatal fricative]] ({{IPA|[ç]}}): {{IPA|/hito/}} &gt; {{IPA|[çito]}} ''hito'' {{lang|ja|人}} ('person')

Of the allophones of {{IPA|/z/}}, the [[affricate]] {{IPA|[d͡z]}} is most common, especially at the beginning of utterances and after {{IPA|/N/}}, while [[Voiced alveolar fricative|fricative]] {{IPA|[z]}} may occur between vowels. Both sounds, however, are in [[free variation]].

In the case of the {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/z/}}, and {{IPA|/t/}}, when followed by {{IPA|/j/}}, historically, the consonants were palatalized with {{IPA|/j/}} merging into a single pronunciation. In modern Japanese, these are arguably separate phonemes, at least for the portion of the population that pronounces them distinctly in English borrowings.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

The vowel {{IPA|/u/}} also affects consonants that it follows:{{sfnp|Itō|Mester|1995|p=825}}

:{| cellpadding="3"
| {{IPA|/h/}} &gt; [[Voiceless bilabial fricative|bilabial fricative]] {{IPA|[ɸ]}}:

|}

Although {{IPA|[ɸ]}} and {{IPA|[t͡s]}} occur before other vowels in loanwords (e.g. {{IPA|[ɸaito]}} ''faito'' {{lang|ja|ファイト}} 'fight'; {{IPA|[ɸjɯː(d)ʑoɴ]}} ''fyūjon'' {{lang|ja|フュージョン}} 'fusion'; {{IPA|[t͡saitoɡaisɯto]}} ''tsaitogaisuto'' {{lang|ja|ツァイトガイスト}} 'Zeitgeist'; {{IPA|[eɾit͡siɴ]}} ''eritsin'' {{lang|ja|エリツィン}} '[[Boris Yeltsin|Yeltsin]]'), {{IPA|[ɸ]}} and {{IPA|[h]}} are distinguished before vowels except {{IPA|[ɯ]}} (e.g. English ''fork'' vs. ''hawk'' &gt; ''fōku'' {{IPA|[ɸoːkɯ]}} {{lang|ja|フォーク}} vs. ''hōku'' {{IPA|[hoːkɯ]}} {{lang|ja|ホーク}}). {{IPA|*[hɯ]}} is still not distinguished from {{IPA|[ɸɯ]}} (e.g. English ''hood'' vs. ''food'' &gt; {{IPA|[ɸɯːdo]}} ''fūdo'' {{lang|ja|フード}}).{{sfnp|Itō|Mester|1995|p=826}} Similarly, {{IPA|*[si]}} and {{IPA|*[(d)zi]}} usually do not occur even in loanwords so that English ''cinema'' becomes {{IPA|[ɕinema]}} ''shinema'' {{lang|ja|シネマ}};{{sfnp|Itō|Mester|1995|p=828}} although they may be written {{lang|ja|スィ}} and {{lang|ja|ズィ}} respectively, they are rarely found even among the most innovative speakers and do not occur phonemically.{{sfnp|Irwin|2011|p=84}}{{sfnp|Hall|2013}}

==={{IPA|/d, z/}} neutralization===
The contrast between {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/z/}} is [[Neutralization (linguistics)|neutralized]] before {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}: {{IPA|[(d)ʑi, (d)zɯ]}}. By convention, it is often assumed to be {{IPA|/z/}}, though some analyze it as {{IPA|/d͡z/}}, the [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] counterpart to {{IPA|[t͡s]}}. The writing system preserves morphological distinctions, though spelling reform has eliminated historical distinctions except in cases where a mora is repeated once voiceless and once voiced, or where rendaku occurs in a compound word: {{lang|ja|つづく[続く]}} {{IPA|/tuduku/}}, {{lang|ja|いちづける[位置付ける]}} {{IPA|/itidukeru/}} from {{IPA|{{pipe}}iti+tukeru{{pipe}}}}. Some dialects retain the distinctions between {{IPA|/zi/}} and {{IPA|/di/}} and between {{IPA|/zu/}} and {{IPA|/du/}}, while others retain only {{IPA|/zu/}} and {{IPA|/du/}} but not {{IPA|/zi/}} and {{IPA|/di/}}, or merge all four (see [[Yotsugana]]).

===Moraic nasal===
The syllable-final moraic nasal, treated as an [[archiphoneme]] {{IPA|/N/}}, undergoes a variety of [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilatory]] processes. It is variously:{{sfnp|Labrune|2012|pp=133–4}}

* uvular {{IPA|[ɴ]}} at the end of utterances and in isolation. Dorsal occlusion may not always be complete.{{sfnp|Vance|2008|p=96}}
* bilabial {{IPA|[m]}} before {{IPA|/p, b, m/}}; this pronunciation is also sometimes found at the end of utterances and in isolation.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Singers are taught to pronounce all final and prevocalic instances of this sound as {{IPA|[m]}}, which reflects its historical derivation.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}
* laminal {{IPA|[n]}} before [[Coronal consonant|coronals]] {{IPA|[d, t, t͡s, n]}}; never found utterance-finally. Apical {{IPA|[n̺]}} is found before liquid {{IPA|/r/}}.{{sfnp|Vance|2008|p=97}}
* alveolo-palatal {{IPA|[ɲ]}} before alveolo-palatals {{IPA|[t͡ɕ, d͡ʑ, ɲ]}}.{{sfnp|Vance|2008|p=96}}
* velar {{IPA|[ŋ]}} before {{IPA|/k, ɡ/}}. Before palatalized consonants, it is also palatalized, as in {{IPA|[ɡẽŋʲkʲi]}}.{{sfnp|Vance|2008|p=96}}
* some sort of [[nasalized]] vowel before vowels, approximants {{IPA|/j, w/}}, liquid {{IPA|/r/}}, and fricatives {{IPA|[ɸ, s, ɕ, ç, h]}}. Depending on context and speaker, the vowel's quality may closely match that of the preceding vowel or be more constricted in articulation. It is thus broadly transcribed with {{IPA|[ɰ̃]}}, an ''ad hoc'' semivocalic notation undefined for the exact place of articulation.{{sfnp|Vance|2008|p=96}} It is also found utterance-finally.{{sfnp|Okada|1999|p=118}}

Some speakers produce {{IPA|[n]}} before {{IPA|/z/}}, pronouncing them as {{IPA|[nd͡z]}}, while others produce a nasalized vowel before {{IPA|/z/}}.{{sfnp|Akamatsu|1997}}{{Page needed|date=May 2017}}

These assimilations occur beyond word boundaries.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Gemination===
While Japanese features consonant [[gemination]], there are some limitations in what can be geminated. Most saliently, voiced geminates are prohibited in native Japanese words.{{sfnp|Labrune|2012|p=104}} This can be seen with suffixation that would otherwise feature voiced geminates. For example, Japanese has a suffix, |{{IPA|ri}}| that contains what {{Harvcoltxt|Kawahara|2006}} calls a "floating mora" that triggers gemination in certain cases (e.g. |{{IPA|tapu}}| +|{{IPA|ri}}| &gt; {{IPA|[tappɯɾi]}} 'a lot of'). When this would otherwise lead to a geminated voiced obstruent, a moraic nasal appears instead as a sort of "partial gemination" (e.g. |{{IPA|zabu}}| + |{{IPA|ri}}| &gt; {{IPA|[(d)zambɯɾi]}} 'splashing').{{sfnp|Kawahara|2006|p=550}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Labrune|2012|pp=104–5}} points out that the prefix |{{IPA|bu}}| has the same effect.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 20th century, voiced geminates began to appear in loanwords, though they are [[Markedness|marked]] and have a high tendency to devoicing.  A frequent example is loanwords from English such as ''bed'' and ''dog'' that, though they end with voiced singletons in English, are geminated (with an epethentic vowel) when borrowed into Japanese.  These geminates frequently undergo devoicing to become less marked, which gives rise to variability in voicing:{{sfn|Sano|2013|pp=245–246}}
: ''doggu'' {{lang|ja|ドッグ}} → ''dokku'' {{lang|ja|ドック}} ('dog'){{sfn|Sano|2013|p=245}}
: ''beddo'' {{lang|ja|ベッド}} → ''betto'' {{lang|ja|ベット}} ('bed'){{sfn|Sano|2013|p=245}}
&lt;!-- 
However, voiced geminates do appear in loanwords. These loanwords can even come from languages, such as English, that do not feature gemination in the first place. For example, when an English word features a coda consonant followed by a [[lax vowel]], it can be borrowed into Japanese featuring a geminate; gemination may also appear as a result of borrowing via written materials, where a word spelled with doubled letters leads to a geminated pronunciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kawahara|2006|pp=537–8}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Katayama|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because these loanwords can feature voiced geminates, Japanese now exhibits a voice distinction with geminates where it formerly did not:{{sfnp|Kawahara|2006|p=538}}
: ''suraggā'' {{lang|ja|スラッガー}} ('slugger') vs. ''surakkā'' ('slacker')
: ''kiddo'' {{lang|ja|キッド}} ('kid') vs. ''kitto'' ('kit') --&gt;

The distinction is not rigorous. For example, when voiced obstruent geminates appear with another voiced obstruent they can undergo optional devoicing (e.g. ''doreddo'' ~ ''doretto'' 'dreadlocks'). {{Harvcoltxt|Kawahara|2006}} attributes this to a less reliable distinction between voiced and voiceless geminates compared to the same distinction in non-geminated consonants, noting that speakers may have difficulty distinguishing them due to the partial devoicing of voiced geminates and their resistance to the [[#Weakening|weakening process mentioned above]], both of which can make them sound like voiceless geminates.{{sfnp|Kawahara|2006|pp=559, 561, 565}}

There is some dispute about how gemination fits with Japanese [[#Phonotactics|phonotactics]]. One analysis, particularly popular among Japanese scholars, posits a special "mora phoneme" ({{lang|ja|モーラ 音素}} ''Mōra onso'') {{IPA|/Q/}}, which corresponds to the [[sokuon]] {{angbr|{{lang|ja|っ}}}}.{{sfnp|Labrune|2012|p=135}} However, not all scholars agree that the use of this "moraic obstruent" is the best analysis. In those approaches that incorporate the moraic obstruent, it is said to completely assimilate to the following obstruent, resulting in a [[gemination|geminate]] (that is, double) consonant. The assimilated {{IPA|/Q/}} remains unreleased and thus the geminates are phonetically long consonants. {{IPA|/Q/}} does not occur before vowels or nasal consonants. This can be seen as an [[archiphoneme]] in that it has no underlying place or manner of articulation, and instead manifests as several phonetic realizations depending on context, for example:

:{| cellpadding="3"
| {{IPA|[p̚]}} before {{IPA|[p]}}:
| {{IPA|/ni'''Q'''.poN/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ɲi'''p̚'''.poɴ]}} ''nippon'' {{lang|ja|日本}} 'Japan'
|-
| {{IPA|[s]}} before {{IPA|[s]}}:
| {{IPA|/ka'''Q'''.seN/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ka'''s'''.seɴ]}} ''kassen'' {{lang|ja|合戦}} 'battle'
|-
| {{IPA|[t̚]}} before {{IPA|[t͡ɕ]}}:
| {{IPA|/sa'''Q'''.ti/}} &gt; {{IPA|[sa'''t̚'''.t͡ɕi]}} ''satchi'' {{lang|ja|察知}} 'inference'
|-
| etc.
|}

Another analysis of Japanese dispenses with {{IPA|/Q/}}. In such an approach, the words above are phonemicized as shown below:

:{| cellpadding="3"
| {{IPA|[p̚]}} before {{IPA|[p]}}:
| {{IPA|/ni'''p'''.poN/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ɲi'''p̚'''.poɴ]}} ''nippon'' {{lang|ja|日本}} 'Japan'
|-
| {{IPA|[s]}} before {{IPA|[s]}}:
| {{IPA|/ka'''s'''.seN/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ka'''s'''.seɴ]}} ''kassen'' {{lang|ja|合戦}} 'battle'
|-
| {{IPA|[t̚]}} before {{IPA|[t͡ɕ]}}:
| {{IPA|/sa'''t'''.ti/}} &gt; {{IPA|[sa'''t̚'''.t͡ɕi]}} ''satchi'' {{lang|ja|察知}} 'inference'
|-
| etc.
|}

Gemination can of course also be transcribed with a length mark (e.g. {{IPA|[ɲipːoɴ]}}), but this notation obscures mora boundaries.

===Sandhi===
Various forms of [[sandhi]] exist; the Japanese term for sandhi generally is {{Nihongo||連音|ren'on}}, while sandhi in Japanese specifically is called {{Nihongo||連声|renjō}}. Most commonly, a terminal {{IPA|/N/}} on one morpheme results in {{IPA|/n/}} or {{IPA|/m/}} being added to the start of the next morpheme, as in {{Nihongo||天皇|tennō|emperor}}, {{lang|ja|てん ＋ おう &gt; てんのう}} (ten + ō = tennō). In some cases, such as this example, the sound change is used in writing as well, and is considered the usual pronunciation, though in other cases, such as abbreviating {{Nihongo||〜の家|...-no-uchi|...'s house}} to {{lang|ja|〜んち}} (''-nchi'') this is only done in speech, and considered informal. See {{lang|ja|[[:ja:連声|連声]]}} (''in Japanese'') for further examples.

* {{IPA|/u/}} is a close near-back vowel with the lips unrounded ({{IPA|[ɯ̟]}}){{sfnp|Labrune|2012|p=25}}{{sfnp|Akamatsu|1997|p=31}} or [[Roundedness|compressed]] ({{IPA|[ɯ̟ᵝ]}}).{{sfnp|Okada|1999|p=118}}{{sfnp|Vance|2008|pp=54–6}} When compressed, it is pronounced with the side portions of the lips in contact but with no salient protrusion. In conversational speech, compression may be weakened or completely dropped.{{sfnp|Vance|2008|pp=54–6}} After {{IPA|/s, z, t/}} and palatalized consonants ({{IPA|/Cj/}}), it is centralized {{IPAblink|ɨ}}.{{sfnp|Labrune|2012|p=25}}
* {{IPA|/e, o/}} are mid {{IPA|[{{IPA link|e̞}}, {{IPA link|o̞}}]}}.{{sfnp|Okada|1999|p=117}}
* {{IPA|/a/}} is central {{IPAblink|ä}}.{{sfnp|Okada|1999|p=117}}

Except for {{IPA|/u/}}, the short vowels are similar to their [[Spanish language|Spanish]] counterparts.

Vowels have a phonemic [[vowel length|length]] contrast (i.e. short vs. long). Compare contrasting pairs of words like ''ojisan'' {{IPA|/ozisaN/}} 'uncle' vs. ''ojiisan'' {{IPA|/oziisaN/}} 'grandfather', or ''tsuki'' {{IPA|/tuki/}} 'moon' vs. ''tsūki'' {{IPA|/tuuki/}} 'airflow'.

Some analyses make a distinction between a long vowel and a succession of two identical vowels, citing pairs such as {{lang|ja|砂糖屋}} ''satōya'' 'sugar shop' {{IPA|[satoːja]}} vs. {{lang|ja|里親}} ''satooya'' 'foster parent' {{IPA|[satooja]}}. They are usually identical in normal speech, but when enunciated a distinction may be made with a pause or a [[glottal stop]] inserted between two identical vowels.{{sfnp|Labrune|2012|pp=45–6}}

Within words and phrases, Japanese allows long sequences of phonetic vowels without intervening consonants, pronounced with [[Hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]], although the [[Japanese pitch accent|pitch accent]] and slight rhythm breaks help track the timing when the vowels are identical. Sequences of two vowels within a single word are extremely common, occurring at the end of many ''i''-type adjectives, for example, and having three or more vowels in sequence within a word also occurs, as in ''aoi'' 'blue/green'. In phrases, sequences with multiple ''o'' sounds are most common, due to the direct object particle {{lang|ja|を}} 'wo' (which comes after a word) being realized as ''o'' and the honorific prefix {{lang|ja|お〜}} 'o', which can occur in sequence, and may follow a word itself terminating in an ''o'' sound; these may be dropped in rapid speech. A fairly common construction exhibiting these is {{lang|ja|「〜をお送りします」}} ''... (w)o o-okuri-shimasu'' 'humbly send ...'. More extreme examples follow:

:{| cellpadding="3"
| {{IPA|/hoo.oo.o.ou/}} {{IPA|[hoː.oː.o.oɯ]}}
| ''hōō o ou'' ({{lang|ja|鳳凰を追う}})
| 'to chase a phoenix ([[Fenghuang]])'
|-

| ''tōō o ōu'' ({{lang|ja|東欧を覆う}})
| 'to cover Eastern Europe'
|}

===Devoicing===
In many dialects, the close vowels {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} become [[Voicelessness|voiceless]] when placed between two voiceless consonants or, unless accented, between a voiceless consonant and a [[pausa]].{{sfnp|Labrune|2012|pp=34–5}}

:{| cellpadding="3"
| {{IPA|/kutu/}} &gt; {{IPA|[kɯ̥t͡sɯ]}}

| ''atsu'' {{lang|ja|圧}} 'pressure'
|-
| {{IPA|/hikaN/}} &gt; {{IPA|[çi̥kaɴ]}}
| ''hikan'' {{lang|ja|悲観}} 'pessimism'
|}

Generally, devoicing does not occur in a consecutive manner:{{sfnp|Tsuchida|2001|p=225}}

:{| cellpadding="3"
| {{IPA|/kisitu/}} &gt; {{IPA|[kʲi̥ɕit͡sɯ]}}
| ''kishitsu'' {{lang|ja|気質}} 'temperament'
|-
| {{IPA|/kusikumo/}} &gt; {{IPA|[kɯɕi̥kɯmo]}}
| ''kushikumo'' {{lang|ja|奇しくも}} 'strangely'
|}

This devoicing is not restricted to only fast speech, though consecutive voicing may occur in fast speech.{{sfnp|Tsuchida|2001|loc=fn 3}}

To a lesser extent, {{IPA|/o, a/}} may be devoiced with the further requirement that there be two or more adjacent moras containing the same phoneme:{{sfnp|Labrune|2012|pp=34–5}}

:{| cellpadding="3"
| {{IPA|/kokoro/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ko̥koɾo]}}
| ''kokoro'' {{lang|ja|心}} 'heart'
|-
| {{IPA|/haka/}} &gt; {{IPA|[hḁka]}}
| ''haka'' {{lang|ja|墓}} 'grave'
|}

The common sentence-ending [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] ''desu'' and polite suffix ''masu'' are typically pronounced {{IPA|[desɯ̥]}} and {{IPA|[masɯ̥]}}.{{sfnp|Seward|1992|p=9}}

Japanese speakers are usually not even aware of the difference of the voiced and devoiced pair. On the other hand, gender roles play a part in prolonging the terminal vowel: it is regarded as effeminate to prolong, particularly the terminal {{IPA|/u/}} as in ''arimasu''. Some nonstandard varieties of Japanese can be recognized by their hyper-devoicing, while in some Western dialects and some registers of formal speech, every vowel is voiced.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

===Nasalization===
Japanese vowels are slightly [[nasalization|nasalized]] when adjacent to nasals {{IPA|/m, n/}}. Before the moraic nasal {{IPA|/N/}}, vowels are heavily nasalized:

===Glottal stop insertion===
At the beginning and end of utterances, Japanese vowels may be preceded and followed by a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[ʔ]}}, respectively. This is demonstrated below with the following words (as pronounced in isolation):

:{| cellpadding="3"
| {{IPA|/eN/}} &gt; {{IPA|[eɴ]}} ~ {{IPA|[ʔeɴ]}}:
| ''en'' {{lang|ja|円}} 'yen'
|-
| {{IPA|/kisi/}} &gt; {{IPA|[kiɕiʔ]}}:
| ''kishi'' {{lang|ja|岸}} 'shore'
|-
| {{IPA|/u/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ɯʔ ~ ʔɯʔ]}}:
| ''u'' {{lang|ja|鵜}} 'cormorant'
|}

When an utterance-final word is uttered with emphasis, this glottal stop is plainly audible, and is often indicated in the writing system with a small letter ''tsu'' {{angbr|{{lang|ja|っ}}}}&lt;/span&gt; called a [[sokuon]]. This is also found in interjections like {{lang|ja|あっ}} and {{lang|ja|えっ}}. These words are likely to be romanized as {{angbr|a'}} and {{angbr|e'}}, or rarely as {{angbr|at}} and {{angbr|et}}.

Japanese words have traditionally been analysed as composed of [[Mora (linguistics)#Japanese|moras]]; a distinct concept from that of syllables.&lt;ref&gt;Moras are represented orthographically in [[katakana]] and [[hiragana]] – each mora, with the exception of CjV clusters, being one kana – and are referred to in Japanese as 'on' or '[[onji]]'.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Verdonschot|first=Rinus G.|last2=Kiyama|first2=Sachiko|last3=Tamaoka|first3=Katsuo|last4=Kinoshita|first4=Sachiko|last5=Heij|first5=Wido La|last6=Schiller|first6=Niels O.|title=The functional unit of Japanese word naming: Evidence from masked priming.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0024491|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|language=en|volume=37|issue=6|pages=1458–1473|doi=10.1037/a0024491}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each mora occupies one rhythmic unit, i.e. it is perceived to have the same time value.{{sfnp|Labrune|2012|p=143}} A mora may be "regular" consisting of just a vowel (V) or a consonant and a vowel (CV), or may be one of two "special" moras, {{IPA|/N/}} and {{IPA|/Q/}}. A glide {{IPA|/j/}} may precede the vowel in "regular" moras (CjV). Some analyses posit a third "special" mora, {{IPA|/R/}}, the second part of a long vowel (a [[chroneme]]).&lt;ref&gt;Also notated {{IPA|/H/}}, following the conventional usage of ''h'' for lengthened vowels in [[romanization of Japanese|romanization]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Labrune|2012|pp=143–4}} In this table, the period represents a mora break, rather than the conventional syllable break.

:{{note|1b|1}} Traditionally, moras were divided into plain and palatal sets, the latter of which entail [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]] of the consonant element.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Itō|Mester|1995|p=827}}. In such a classification scheme, the plain counterparts of moras with a palatal glide are onsetless moras.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IPA|/N/}} is restricted from occurring word-initially, and {{IPA|/Q/}} is found only word-medially.{{sfn|Aoyama|2001|p=9}} Vowels may be long, and the voiceless consonants {{IPA|/p, t, k, s, n/}} may be [[Gemination|geminate]] (doubled).{{sfn|Aoyama|2001|p=8}} In the analysis with [[archiphoneme]]s, geminate consonants are the realization of the sequences {{IPA|/Nn/}}, {{IPA|/Nm/}} and sequences of {{IPA|/Q/}} followed by a [[voiceless]] [[obstruent]], though some words are written with geminate voiced obstruents. In the analysis without archiphonemes, geminate clusters are simply two identical consonants, one after the other.

In [[English language|English]], [[stress (phonology)|stress]]ed [[syllable]]s in a [[word]] are pronounced louder, longer, and with higher pitch, while unstressed syllables are relatively shorter in duration. Japanese is often considered a [[timing (linguistics)|mora-timed]] language, as each mora [[Isochrony|tends to be of the same length]],{{sfn|Aoyama|2001|pp=1–2}} though not strictly: geminate consonants and moras with devoiced vowels may be shorter than other moras.{{sfn|Aoyama|2001|p=11}}  Factors such as pitch have negligible influence on mora length.{{sfn|Aoyama|2001|pp=7–8}}

==Accent==
{{Main|Japanese pitch accent}}
Standard Japanese has a distinctive [[pitch accent]] system: a word can have one of its moras bearing an accent or not. An accented mora is pronounced with a relatively high tone and is followed by a drop in [[pitch accent|pitch]]. The various [[Japanese dialects]] have different accent patterns, and some exhibit more complex tonic systems.

==Sound change==
As an [[agglutinative language]], Japanese has generally very regular pronunciation, with much simpler [[morphophonology]] than a [[fusional language]] would. Nevertheless, there are a number of prominent sound change phenomena, primarily in morpheme combination and in conjugation of verbs and adjectives. Phonemic changes are generally reflected in the spelling, while those that are not either indicate informal or dialectal speech which further simplify pronunciation.

===Sandhi===

====Rendaku====
{{main|Rendaku}}
In Japanese, [[sandhi]] is prominently exhibited in [[rendaku]] – [[consonant mutation]] of the initial consonant of a morpheme from unvoiced to voiced in some contexts when it occurs in the middle of a word. This phonetic difference is reflected in the spelling via the addition of [[dakuten]], as in {{nihongo||か／が|ka, ga}}. In cases where this combines with the [[yotsugana]] mergers, notably {{Nihongo||じ／ぢ|ji, dzi}} and {{Nihongo||ず／づ|zu, dzu}} in standard Japanese, the resulting spelling is [[morphophonemic]] rather than purely phonemic.

====Gemination====
The other common sandhi in Japanese is conversion of {{lang|ja|つ}} or {{lang|ja|く}} (''tsu, ku''), and {{lang|ja|ち}} or {{lang|ja|き}} (''chi, ki''), and rarely {{lang|ja|ふ}} or {{lang|ja|ひ}} (''fu, hi'') as a trailing consonant to a [[geminate consonant]] when not word-final – orthographically, the [[sokuon]] {{lang|ja|っ}}, as this occurs most often with {{lang|ja|つ}}. So that 
* {{lang|ja|一}} (''itsu'') + {{lang|ja|緒}} (''sho'') = {{lang|ja|一緒}} (''issho'')
* {{lang|ja|学}} (''gaku'') + {{lang|ja|校}} (''kō'') = {{lang|ja|学校}} (''gakkō'')

Some long vowels derive from an earlier combination of a vowel and ''fu'' (see [[onbin]]). The ''f'' often causes gemination when it is joined with another word:
* {{lang|ja|法}} (''hafu'' &gt; ''hō'') + {{lang|ja|被}} (''hi'') = {{lang|ja|法被}} (''happi''), instead of ''hōhi''.
* {{lang|ja|法}} (''bofu'' &gt; ''bō'') + {{lang|ja|師}} (''shi'') = {{lang|ja|法師}} (''botchi''), sometimes ''bōshi''.
* {{lang|ja|合}} (''kafu'' &gt; ''gō'') + {{lang|ja|戦}} (''sen'') = {{lang|ja|合戦}} (''kassen''), instead of ''gōsen''
* {{lang|ja|入}} (''nifu'' &gt; ''nyū'') + {{lang|ja|声}} (''shō'') = {{lang|ja|入声}} (''nisshō''), instead of ''nyūshō''
* {{lang|ja|十}} (''jifu'' &gt; ''jū'') + {{lang|ja|戒}} (''kai'') = {{lang|ja|十戒}} (''jikkai'') instead of ''jūkai''

Most words exhibiting this change are [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese]] words deriving from [[Middle Chinese]] morphemes ending in {{IPA|/t̚/}}, {{IPA|/k̚/}} or {{IPA|/p̚/}}, which were borrowed on their own into Japanese with a [[prop vowel]] after them (e.g. {{lang|ja|日}} MC *{{IPA|/nit̚/}} &gt; Japanese {{IPA|/niti/}} {{IPA|[ɲit͡ɕi]}}) but in compounds as assimilated to the following consonant (e.g. {{lang|ja|日本}} MC *{{IPA|/nit̚.pu̯ən/}} &gt; Japanese {{IPA|/niQ.poN/}} {{IPA|[ɲip̚.poɴ]}}).

====Renjō====
{{further2|{{lang|ja|[[:ja:連声|連声]]}}|[[Late Middle Japanese#Medial gemination]]}}
Sandhi also occurs much less often in {{Nihongo||連声|renjō}}, where, most commonly, a terminal {{IPA|/N/}} or {{IPA|/Q/}} on one morpheme results in {{IPA|/n/}} (or {{IPA|/m/}} when derived from historical ''m'') or {{IPA|/t̚/}} respectively being added to the start of a following morpheme beginning with a vowel or [[semivowel]], as in {{nihongo||天皇: てん + おう → てんのう|ten + ō → tennō}}. Examples:

;First syllable ending with {{IPA|/N/}}:
*{{lang|ja|銀杏}} (''ginnan''): {{lang|ja|ぎん}} (''gin'') + {{lang|ja|あん}} (''an'') → {{lang|ja|ぎん'''な'''ん}} (''gin'''n'''an'')
*{{lang|ja|観音}} (''kannon''): {{lang|ja|くゎん}} (''kwan'') + {{lang|ja|おむ}} (''om'') → {{lang|ja|くゎん'''の'''む}} (''kwan'''n'''om'') → {{lang|ja|かん'''の'''ん}} (''kan'''n'''on'') 
*{{lang|ja|天皇}} (''tennō''): {{lang|ja|てん}} (''ten'') + {{lang|ja|わう}} (''wau'') → {{lang|ja|てん'''な'''う}} (''ten'''n'''au'') → {{lang|ja|てん'''の'''う}} (''ten'''n'''ō'')
;First syllable ending with {{IPA|/N/}} from original {{IPA|/m/}}:
*{{lang|ja|三位}} (''sanmi''): {{lang|ja|さむ}} (''sam'') + {{lang|ja|ゐ}} (''wi'') → {{lang|ja|さむ'''み'''}} (''sam'''m'''i'') → {{lang|ja|さん'''み'''}} (''san'''m'''i'') 
*{{lang|ja|陰陽}} (''onmyō''): {{lang|ja|おむ}} (''om'') + {{lang|ja|やう}} (''yau'') → {{lang|ja|おむ'''み'''ゃう}} (''om'''m'''yau'') → {{lang|ja|おん'''み'''ょう}} (''on'''m'''yō'')
;First syllable ending with {{IPA|/Q/}}:
*{{lang|ja|雪隠}} (''setchin''): {{lang|ja|せつ}} (setsu) + {{lang|ja|いん}} (''in'') → {{lang|ja|せっ'''ち'''ん}} (''set'''ch'''in)
*{{lang|ja|屈惑}} (''kuttaku''): {{lang|ja|くつ}} (kutsu) + {{lang|ja|わく}} (''waku'') → {{lang|ja|くっ'''た'''く}} (''kut'''t'''aku)

===Onbin===
{{further|Japanese grammar#Euphonic changes (音便 onbin)}}
Another prominent feature is {{Nihongo||音便|onbin|euphonic sound change}}, particularly historical sound changes.

In cases where this has occurred within a morpheme, the morpheme itself is still distinct but with a different sound, as in {{Nihongo||箒 (ほうき)|hōki|broom}}, which underwent two sound changes from earlier {{Nihongo||ははき|hahaki}} → {{Nihongo||はうき|hauki}} (onbin) → {{Nihongo||ほうき|houki}} (historical vowel change) → {{Nihongo||ほうき|hōki}} (long vowel, sound change not reflected in kana spelling).

However, certain forms are still recognizable as irregular morphology, particularly forms that occur in basic verb conjugation, as well as some compound words.

====Verb conjugation====
{{further2|[[Japanese grammar#Verb conjugations|Onbin in verb conjugations]]}}

====Polite adjective forms====
{{further|Japanese grammar#Polite forms of adjectives}}

The [[Japanese grammar#Polite forms of adjectives|polite adjective forms]] (used before the polite copula {{nihongo||ござる|gozaru|be}} and verb {{nihongo||存じる|zonjiru|think, know}}) exhibit a one-step or two-step sound change. Firstly, these use the continuative form, {{Nihongo||-く|-ku}}, which exhibits ''onbin'', dropping the ''k'' as {{Nihongo||-く|-ku}} → {{Nihongo||-う|-u}}. Secondly, the vowel may combine with the preceding vowel, according to historical sound changes; if the resulting new sound is palatalized, meaning {{nihongo||ゆ、よ|yu, yo}}, this combines with the preceding consonant, yielding a palatalized syllable.

This is most prominent in certain everyday terms that derive from an ''i''-adjective ending in ''-ai'' changing to ''-ō'' (''-ou''), which is because these terms are abbreviations of polite phrases ending in ''gozaimasu'', sometimes with a polite ''o-'' prefix. The terms are also used in their full form, with notable examples being:
* {{nihongo||有難う、ありがとう|arigatō|Thank you}}, from {{nihongo||有難い、ありがたい|arigatai|(I am) grateful}}.
* {{nihongo||お早う、おはよう|ohayō|Good morning}}, from {{nihongo||早い、はやい|hayai|(It is) early}}.
* {{nihongo||お目出度う、おめでとう|omedetō|Congratulations}}, from {{nihongo||目出度い、めでたい|medetai|(It is) auspicious}}.

Other transforms of this type are found in polite speech, such as {{Nihongo||美味しく|oishiku}} → {{Nihongo||美味しゅう|oishū}} and {{Nihongo||大きく|ōkiku}} → {{Nihongo||大きゅう|ōkyū}}.

====''-hito''====
The morpheme {{nihongo||人 (ひと)|hito|person}} (with ''rendaku'' {{nihongo||〜びと|-bito}}) has changed to {{nihongo||うと|uto}} or {{nihongo||うど|udo}}, respectively, in a number of compounds. This in turn often combined with a historical vowel change, resulting in a pronunciation rather different from that of the components, as in {{Nihongo||仲人 (なこうど)|nakōdo|matchmaker}} (see below). These include:

* {{Nihongo||弟 (おとうと)|otōto|younger brother}}, from {{Nihongo||弟人 (おとひと)|otohito}} → {{Nihongo||おとうと|otouto}} → {{Nihongo|||otōto}}.
* {{Nihongo||妹 (いもうと)|imōto|younger sister}}, from {{Nihongo||妹人 (いもひと)|imohito}} → {{Nihongo||いもうと|imouto}} → {{Nihongo|||imōto}}.
* {{Nihongo||素人 (しろうと)|shirōto|novice}}, from {{Nihongo||白人 (しろひと)|shirohito}} → {{Nihongo||しろうと|shirouto}} → {{Nihongo|||shirōto}}.
* {{Nihongo||玄人 (くろうと)|kurōto|veteran}}, from {{Nihongo||黒人 (くろひと)|kurohito}} → {{Nihongo||くろうと|kurouto}} → {{Nihongo|||kurōto}}.
* {{Nihongo||仲人 (なこうど)|nakōdo|matchmaker}}, from {{Nihongo||仲人 (なかびと)|nakabito}} → {{Nihongo||なかうど|nakaudo}} → {{Nihongo||なこうど|nakoudo}} → {{Nihongo|||nakōdo}}.
* {{Nihongo||狩人 (かりゅうど)|karyūdo|hunter}}, from {{Nihongo||狩人 (かりびと)|karibito}} → {{Nihongo||かりうど|kariudo}} → {{Nihongo||かりゅうど|karyuudo}} → {{Nihongo|||karyūdo}}.
* {{Nihongo||舅 (しゅうと)|shūto|stepfather}}, from {{Nihongo||舅人 (しひと)|shihito}} → {{Nihongo||しうと|shiuto}} → {{Nihongo||しゅうと|shuuto}} → {{Nihongo|||shūto}}.

====Fusion====
In some cases morphemes have effectively fused and will not be recognizable as being composed of two separate morphemes.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Early life==
Perreault was born in [[Manhattan]] and raised in [[Belmar, New Jersey|Belmar]] and other towns in New Jersey.&lt;ref name=Grimes&gt;{{cite journal|title=John Perreault, Art Critic (and Artist) Who Championed the New, Dies at 78|last=Grimes|first=William|journal=The New York Times|date=8 September 2015|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/09/arts/john-perreault-critic-artist-and-poet-dies-at-78.html|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied briefly at [[Montclair State University|Montclair State Teachers College]], after which he enrolled in a poetry workshop at the [[New School for Social Research]].&lt;ref name=Grimes/&gt; His first book of poetry, ''Camouflage'', was published in 1966, followed by ''Luck'' (1969) and ''Harry'' (1974).&lt;ref name=Grimes/&gt;

==Professional work==
Perreault was an editorial associate for ''[[ARTnews]]'' in the 1960s, an art critic for ''[[Village Voice|The Village Voice]]'' (1966-74), and senior art critic for ''The Soho Weekly News'' (1975-82).&lt;ref name=Greenberger&gt;{{cite web|title=John Perreault, Noted Art Critic for The Village Voice and ARTnews, Dies at 78|last=Greenberger|first=Alex|website=ARTnews|url=http://www.artnews.com/2015/09/08/john-perreault-noted-art-critic-for-the-village-voice-and-artnews-dies-at-78/|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked briefly as the chief curator at the [[Everson Museum]] (1982).&lt;ref name=Grimes/&gt; From 1985 to 1989, he was the first professional curator at the [[Sailors' Snug Harbor|Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art]] in [[Staten Island]].&lt;ref name=Grimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fressola&gt;{{cite journal|title=John Perreault, first curator at Snug Harbor's Newhouse, dies at 78|last=Fressola|first=Michael J.|journal=The Staten Island Advance|date=8 September 2015|url=http://www.silive.com/entertainment/arts/index.ssf/2015/09/john_perreault_ex-curator_at_s.html|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also senior curator at the [[Museum of Arts and Design|American Craft Museum]] (1990-93).&lt;ref name=Grimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fressola/&gt; In later years, Perreault was interested in [[craft]] and served as the executive director of UrbanGlass.&lt;ref name=Greenberger/&gt; From 2004 until 2014, he wrote a [[blog]] called ''Artopia: John Perreault's art diary''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artopia: John Perreault's art diary|last=Perreault|first=John|url=http://www.artsjournal.com/artopia|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art and art criticism==
As an art critic, Perreault's writing was clear and accessible.&lt;ref name=Voice/&gt;&lt;ref name=Littman&gt;{{cite journal|title=John Perreault|last=Littman|first=Brett|journal=The Brooklyn Rail|date=1 November 2016|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2016/11/criticspage/john-perreault|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Deadpan humor with a point of view: Why critic John Perreault will be missed|last=Miranda|first=Carolina A.|journal=Los Angeles Times|date=20 December 2015|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/miranda/la-et-cam-why-critic-john-perreault-will-be-missed-20150909-column.html|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He championed the [[avant garde]], including [[Minimalism]], [[Land art|Land Art]], and [[Pattern and Decoration|Pattern &amp; Decoration]].&lt;ref name=Greenberger/&gt; In 1968, when several names were used to describe the art now known as Minimalism, he predicted that the term ''minimalism'' would "stick."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Plastic Ambiguities|last=Perreault|first=John|journal=The Village Voice|date=7 March 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, with the rise of the [[feminist art movement]], he frequently wrote in support of art by women.&lt;ref name=Grimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=Voice&gt;{{cite journal|title=John Perreault, Artist, Critic, and Author, 1937-2015|last=Village Voice Staff|date=9 September 2015|journal=The Village Voice|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2015/09/09/john-perreault-artist-critic-and-author-1937-2015/|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldstein&gt;{{cite web|title='It's Only Art' Proves the Late Village Voice Critic John Perreault Was Witty With the Brush as Well as the Pen|last=Goldstein|first=Andrew|website=Artnet News|date=7 July 2017|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/john-perreault-at-marquee-projects-1017152|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, for example, he praised [[Sylvia Sleigh|Sylvia Sleigh's]] recent nudes, calling them "as daring as ever, perhaps even a little bit more daring" and noting that she was "always willing to challenge herself and her viewers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Acute linoleum heartburn|last=Perreault|first=John|journal=The Village Voice|date=26 September 1974|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he responded positively to [[Shirley Gorelick|Shirley Gorelick's]] paintings of [[African-Americans|African-American]] sitters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Outrageous Black Pop|last=Perreault|first=John|journal=The Soho Weekly News|date=1 May 1975|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review of a group show at [[Soho20 Chelsea|SOHO20]] called ''Showing Off'' (1975), Perreault characterized [[Sharon Wybrants|Sharon Wybrants's]] ''Self-Portrait as Superwoman (Woman as Culture Hero)'' (1975) as "more than slightly tongue-in-cheek. But it demonstrates that women artists have egos too, sometimes just as big as any man's. And why shouldn’t they?"&lt;ref name=Perreault1&gt;{{cite journal|title=Superwoman!|last=Perreault|first=John|journal=The Soho Weekly News|date=25 September 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perreault also praised [[Alice Neel]]'s portrait of the [[art history|art historian]] [[Linda Nochlin]] (now at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Linda Nochlin and Daisy|last=Neel|first=Alice|date=1973|url=https://www.mfa.org/collections/object/linda-nochlin-and-daisy-36578|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; calling it "a knock-out" and remarking that "Nochlin looks as if she has just had about enough of [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]], whereas her daughter is the perfect imp."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Soho Weekly News|last=Perreault|first=John|title=Talking Heads: Portraiture Revived|date=19 February 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At times, Perreault served as a subject for artists,&lt;ref name=Russeth/&gt; including [[Alice Neel]], whose ''John Perreault'' (1972) is now owned by the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Perreault|last=Neel|first=Alice|date=1972|url=http://collection.whitney.org/object/2447}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two met when Perreault was working for ''ARTnews'', but the portrait was painted for ''The Male Nude'' (1973), an exhibition that Perreault curated at the [[School of Visual Arts]].&lt;ref name=Newhall&gt;{{cite journal|title=Neel Life Stories|last=Newhall|first=Edith|journal=New York Magazine|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/features/3409/|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he later recalled, Neel thought he resembled a [[faun]].&lt;ref name=Newhall/&gt; Perreault also appears with other art critics—all unclothed—in Sylvia Sleigh's ''The Turkish Bath'' (1973).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=As Portraits Became Passé, These Artists Redefined 'Face Value'|last=Stamberg|first=Susan|website=NPR|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/05/29/316408346/as-portraits-became-pass-these-artists-redefined-face-value|date=29 May 2014|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perreault was later portrayed in Sleigh's 14-panel ''Invitation to a Voyage: The Hudson River at Fishkill'' (1979-99), now owned by the [[Hudson River Museum]].&lt;ref name=Russeth&gt;{{cite web|title=Invitation to a Voyage: On Sylvia Sleigh's Other Portrait of the Late Art Critic John Perreault|last=Russeth|first=Andrew|website=ARTnews|url=http://www.artnews.com/2015/09/14/john-perreault-portrait-sylvia-sleigh/|date=14 September 2015|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, a bust-length portrait of Perreault was painted by [[Philip Pearlstein]].&lt;ref name=Greenberger/&gt; Perreault later wrote a monograph on Pearlstein's drawings and watercolors, published in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philip Pearlstein: Drawings and Watercolors|last=Perreault|first=John|publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc.|place=New York|date=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other art critics, including [[John Ruskin]] and [[Clement Greenberg]], John Perreault was also an artist.&lt;ref name=Goldstein/&gt; He created drawings, paintings, and [[found object]] constructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Element of Chance: A Celebration of John Perreault|last=Baker|first=R.C.|website=The Village Voice|date=11 July 2017|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2017/07/11/an-element-of-chance-a-celebration-of-john-perreault/|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perreault's first exhibition of paintings and sculptures was in 1965.&lt;ref name=Perreault&gt;{{cite web|title=Portfolio|last=Perreault|first=John|url=http://johnperreault.info/portfolio.html|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he aimed "to attack what he calls the art supplies racket" by using "alternate media," such as [[Colgate (toothpaste)|Colgate toothpaste]] and oil-soaked beach sand.&lt;ref name=Perreault/&gt; Another preferred medium was instant coffee grounds,&lt;ref name=Goldstein/&gt; which he used "in honor of" [[George Washington (inventor)|George Washington]], "the 'inventor' of instant coffee," who once maintained a residence near [[Bellport, New York]], where Perreault lived.&lt;ref name=Perreault/&gt;

==Personal life==
In 2008, Perreault married Jeff Weinstein, his partner of 32 years, in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]], after [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]] was legalized there.&lt;ref name=Sipher&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vows: Jeff Weinstein and John Perreault|last=Sipher|first=Devan|journal=The New York Times|date=20 December 2008|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/21/fashion/weddings/21Vows.html|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinstein, who began as a restaurant critic, has held positions as an arts editor at ''The Soho Weekly News'' (1977-79), editor of visual arts and architecture criticism at ''The Village Voice'' (1981-95), fine arts editor at ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' (1997-2006), and editor of arts and culture at [[Bloomberg News]] (2006-07).&lt;ref name=Weinstein&gt;{{cite web|title=Out There: Jeff Weinstein's Cultural Mixology|last=Weinstein|first=Jeff|url=http://www.artsjournal.com/outthere/jeff-weinstein|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kanai Yoshiko''' ('''{{lang-ja|金井淑子}}''', born 1944) is Japanese academic and feminist theorist. She explored the complexities of the feminist movements in Japan and the difficulty in launching women's studies in a society bound by [[gender binary|dualistic]] definitions of gender. Coining the phrase "housewife feminism", she addressed how Japanese society had attempted to appease women without addressing the underlying systemic problems that continued to foster inequality.

==Early life==
Kanai Yoshiko was born in 1944 &lt;!-- on 5 October 1944 --&gt; in [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Yokosuka]], [[Kanagawa Prefecture]], Japan. She graduated from the [[University of Tokyo]] (UT) with a degree in literature and philosophy in 1967 and went on to further her education at UT, earning a master's degree education and ethics.{{sfn|Women's Action Network|2016}}

==Career==
Kanai began her career at the newly established [[Nagaoka Women's Junior College]] in 1971. She was one of the first academics in Japan to focus on [[women's studies]]. She remained at Nagaoka Junior College until 1999, when she accepted a position at [[Yokohama National University]] in the Human Sciences Department. She reached the university's mandatory retirement barrier in 2010 and took a post in the philosophy and letters department at [[Rissho University]], from which she retired in 2015.{{sfn|Women's Action Network|2016}} 

Kanai was most known as a specialist in [[gender studies]] and ethics, writing numerous books analyzing the feminist movement in Japan and its limitations.{{sfn|AMPO Japan-Asia Quarterly Review|2015|p=x}}{{sfn|Chalmers|2003|p=35}} She coined the phrase "housewife feminism" to refer to a particular type of issues-based feminism, where the official response establishes quotas and training to counteract imbalances, but does nothing to address the underlying [[systemic bias]]es.{{sfn|AMPO Japan-Asia Quarterly Review|2015|pp=20-21}}{{sfn|Smith|2013|pp=160-161}} She argued that rather than giving women real power for their own development, the focus of [[identity politics]] on nationalist and traditional aims provided pacifiers, such as men taking on more household duties, and led to continued co-opting of women's ability to define themselves and direct policies which affected them.{{sfn|Loftus|1997}} In turn, she found that no radical feminist movement developed in Japan, because women readily accepted a [[binary gender]] model and succumbed to pressure to define themselves in the role of wife.{{sfn|Chalmers|2003|p=35}} By accepting traditional roles, Japanese motherhood is glorified and a one-size-fits-all approach is used to address issues.{{sfn||Liddle|Nakajimo|2000|p=11}} She has noted that the failure to grasp that "…equality of sexual power [is] a human right of women and sexual violence against women [is] a violation of human rights" was a stumbling block to women's empowerment.{{sfn|Smith|2013|p=161}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4260">{{short description|1947 essay by George Orwell}}
"'''Lear, Tolstoy and the Fool'''" is an essay by [[George Orwell]]. It was inspired by a [[Tolstoy on Shakespeare|critical essay on Shakespeare]] by [[Leo Tolstoy]], and was first published in ''[[Polemic (magazine)|Polemic]]'' No. 7 (March 1947).&lt;ref name="In Front of Your Nose"&gt;[[Orwell, Sonia]] and [[Ian Angus (librarian)|Angus, Ian]] (eds.). ''The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell Volume 4: In Front of Your Nose (1945-1950)'' (Penguin)&lt;/ref&gt;

Orwell analyzes Tolstoy's criticism of [[Shakespeare]]'s work in general and his attack on ''[[King Lear]]'' in particular. According to Orwell's detailed summary, Tolstoy denounced Shakespeare as a bad dramatist, not a true artist at all, and declared that Shakespeare's fame was due to propaganda by German professors towards the end of the eighteenth century. Tolstoy claimed that Shakespeare was still admired only because of a sort of mass hypnosis or "epidemic suggestion".

After having recapitulated Tolstoy's indictment and Tolstoy's criteria for literary merit, which Shakespeare does not meet, Orwell writes:

{{cquote|One's first feeling is that in describing Shakespeare as a bad writer he is saying something demonstrably untrue. But this is not the case. In reality there is no kind of evidence or argument by which one can show that Shakespeare, or any other writer, is 'good' ... Ultimately there is no test of literary merit except survival, which is itself an index to majority opinion. Artistic theories such as Tolstoy's are quite worthless, because they not only start out with arbitrary assumptions, but depend on vague terms ('sincere', 'important' and so forth) which can be interpreted in any way one chooses. Properly speaking one cannot ''answer'' Tolstoy's attack. The interesting question is: why did he make it? But it should be noticed in passing that he uses many weak or dishonest arguments. Some of them are worth pointing out, not because they invalidate his main charge but because they are, so to speak, evidence of malice.}}

After a detailed, itemized analysis aimed to show that a great number of Tolstoy's arguments are false, dishonest and malicious, Orwell identifies Tolstoy's chief quarrel with Shakespeare as "the quarrel between the religious and the humanist attitude towards life." The exuberance with life that characterizes Shakespeare, his interest in everything, the poetic brilliance - the very qualities for which people tend to admire Shakespeare - are precisely the qualities that make him unendurable to Tolstoy, who preached austerity and whose "main aim, in his later years, was to narrow the range of human consciousness. One's interests, one's points of attachment to the physical world and the day-to-day struggle, must be as few and not as many as possible." Since Shakespeare's attitude to life threatens Tolstoy's, Tolstoy is incapable of enjoying Shakespeare and mounts an assault on him in order to try to ensure that others cannot enjoy him either.

Orwell then proceeds to examine Tolstoy himself and notes that the special hatred Tolstoy reserved for ''King Lear'' could well be due to the curious similarity of his own story to Lear's, and to the fact that he suffered disappointments of the same nature after renouncing his estate, his aristocratic title and his copyrights.

In conclusion, Orwell mentions how little difference Tolstoy's thunderous attack on Shakespeare has made. According to Orwell, the only criterion for the merit of a work of art is that it continues to be admired, and hence, the verdict on Shakespeare must be "not guilty", since more than a hundred years after Tolstoy's pamphlet Shakespeare remains as admired as ever.

They are used in a variety of ways: as culinary herbs, landscape plants, healing herbs, teas, and worship implements. All true basils are [[species]] of the genus ''[[Ocimum]]''. The genus is particularly diverse, and includes [[annual plant|annuals]], non-woody [[perennial plant|perennials]] and [[shrub]]s native to [[Africa]] and other [[tropics|tropical]] and [[subtropics|subtropical]] regions of the [[Old World|Old]] and [[New World]].&lt;ref name="hsa"&gt;{{cite web

The Herb Garden was a gift to the United States from the [[Herb Society of America]].&lt;/ref&gt; most, but not all, culinary basils are [[cultivar]]s of ''O. basilicum'', or [[sweet basil]]. Some are cultivars of other basil species, and others are [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]]. It is particularly challenging to determine which species a basil belongs to. This is because basil cross-breeds easily, and drawing boundaries between species is particularly difficult. In fact, recent studies have led to reclassification of some portions of the genus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

Basil cultivars vary in several ways. Visually, the size and shape of the leaves varies greatly, from the large lettuce-like leaves of the ''Mammoth basil'' and ''Lettuce leaf basil'' to the tiny leaves of the ''Dwarf bush basil''. More practically, the fragrance of the basil varies due to the varying types and quantities of [[essential oil]]s contained in the plants. The most important are 1,8 [[cineol]], [[linalool]], [[citral]], methyl chavicol ([[estragole]]), [[eugenol]] and [[methyl cinnamate]], although hardly any basil contains all of these in any significant amount.&lt;ref name="katzer"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3310">'''Main tapal empat''' is a two-player [[abstract strategy]] [[board game]] from [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref name="WintherMainTapalEmpat"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Winther|first1=Mats|title=Asian Tiger games hunt games from Asia|url=http://mlwi.magix.net/bg/asiantiger.htm|website=Asian Tiger games|publisher=August 2006|accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a hunt game, and specifically a tiger hunt game (or tiger game) since it uses an Alquerque board. The tigers can move as many spaces in a straight line as a clear path allows.&lt;ref name=WintherMainTapalEmpat/&gt; Most hunt games have tigers, leopards, or foxes moving only one space at a time. In effect, the tigers in this game have the movement capability of the [[Queen (chess)|queen]] in [[chess]].

== Setup ==

The game uses a standard [[Alquerque]] board. Two tigers and eighteen goats are represented by distinguishable pieces, usually black and white respectively.

Players decide who will play the tigers and the goats.

The board is empty in the beginning.

== Rules ==

*  Players alternate their turns throughout the game.
*  The two tigers are placed on any two intersection points on the central square of the Alquerque board.
*  Goats are then dropped on the board one piece per turn on any vacant intersection point on the board.
*  The goats on the board cannot move until all 18 of their pieces are dropped on the board which requires 18 turns.  The tigers however can move and capture goat pieces from the beginning.
*  Tigers move or capture exclusively in a turn following the pattern on the board.  
**Tigers can move (in any available direction) as far as they want on a straight line as long as the path is unoccupied onto a vacant intersection point.  Only one tiger may be moved in a turn.  
**Alternatively, the tiger can capture a goat.  Tigers can capture by the short leap as in [[draughts]] and [[Alquerque]].  The leap can only be done if the tiger is already adjacent to the goat at the beginning of its turn.  The tiger cannot move (next to a goat) and then leap.  Nor can it leap over an adjacent goat, and then move.  The tiger must either move or leap exclusively on its turn.  To perform the short leap method the tiger leaps over the adjacent goat, and lands on a vacant intersection point adjacently behind the goat that was leaped over.  The leap must follow the pattern on the board, and it must be done in a straight line.  Only one goat may be captured in a turn, and is removed from the board.  Captures are not compulsory.
*  Goats move following the pattern on the board.  Only one goat may be moved per turn.  A goat moves (in any available direction) along a marked line onto a vacant adjacent intersection point.
*  The goats win if they block the movements of the tigers such that the tigers cannot perform a legal move or capture.
*  The tigers win if they capture enough of the goats so that the goats cannot effectively block the movements of the tigers, and this is usually when the number of goats are reduced to 10.&lt;ref name=WintherMainTapalEmpat/&gt;

'''''Nation Estate''''' is a 2013 [[Culture of Palestine|Palestinian]] movie directed by Larissa Sansour. It is a sci-fi short film that depicts Palestine as a skyscraper, with each floor representing a city in Palestine. An earlier version of the project garnered attention when it was removed from a competition at the [[Musée de l'Elysée]] allegedly due to its political connotations.&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite web|last=Milmo|first=Cahal|title=Lacoste accused of attempting to censor 'too pro-Palestinian' art|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/lacoste-accused-of-attempting-to-censor-too-propalestinian-art-6280082.html|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==

The film starts with a pregnant woman arriving at a train station. She makes her way up an escalator with a travel bag in hand. At the top of the escalator she uses a fingerprint and retinal scan to enter a lobby and walks over to the elevators. As she pushes the button, she looks over to a poster on the wall that reads "Nation Estate: Living the High Life". Next to the elevator is a directory for the building floors. Each floor is described as a city or area in Palestine. In the elevator, advertisements play on a television screen. The advertisements seems to address different social and political issues that Palestinians face today, such as water supply, food and travelling restrictions. The first stop the elevator makes is on the 13th floor, [[Jerusalem]]. As two other 'travelers' make their way off the elevator, you can see the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]]. The next stop is [[Bethlehem]]. As the woman steps off the elevator and walks away, the city's old architecture can be seen as the basis for the floor. She walks into a tunnel that seems to be authentic stone and mortar from the outside, but is more modern on the inside. She stops at a door, and using a keycard in the form of a Palestinian flag, she opens up the door to an apartment. She sets the keycard down, and picks up a watering can. She heads over to a window, and in front of the window, there is a tree growing out of the ground and she waters it. Afterwards, she heads over to a cabinet and opens it up, revealing multicolored cans. When she grabs one and looks at it, it has a label that says '[[Mulukhiyah|Mloukhieh]]', a food native to the Middle East and North Africa. She returns the can and reaches for another, this time it is 'Marmaon'. She heats it up using a fingerprint and pours it out into a bowl, along with other food. She sets it down on the table and makes her way to the window. After pressing a button on the wall, the view changes into one of Jerusalem. The woman holds her belly as she looks on to the city.

== Controversy ==

In 2011, a multimedia project of the same name by the film’s director, [http://www.larissasansour.com Larissa Sansour], was selected to be a part of the [[Lacoste]] Elysée Competition. However, after being shortlisted for a prize by the museum, Larissa was contacted by the museum staff, informing her that her film was deemed "too pro-Palestinian" by the people from Lacoste, allegations which the company later denied.&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt; The museum also requested that Sansour release a statement saying that she had "decided to pursue other opportunities."&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt;

After the work’s removal sparked outrage, Lacoste ended its sponsorship of the £21,000 prize while the gallery in turn suspended its relationship with the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-16299688|title=Censorship row cancels art prize|date=2011-12-22|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=November 2011}}
'''People's Houses''' ({{lang-ru|Народный дом}}) were originally leisure and cultural centres built with the intention of making art and cultural appreciation available to the working classes. The first establishment of this type appeared in [[Tomsk]], Russia in 1882. Soon people's Houses became popular in England (1887, "People's Palace"), Scotland, Turkey and other European states.

The term "people's house" (e.g., ''folkets hus'', ''casa del pueblo'', ''maison du peuple'', etc.) was used in continental Europe for working-class [[community centre]]s, and these were often associated with labor unions and parties.

==United Kingdom==
In the late 19th century, '''People's Palaces''' started being built in grim urban districts. The concept was to raise morale and morality through inspiring buildings which offered cultural nourishment. Costly, taking years to build and lavishly decorated, they were designed to provide a focal point for civic pride, venues for meetings and public events.

Notably these were built according to neo-Gothic style, as promoted by [[Augustus Pugin]] and [[John Ruskin]]: Pugin believed the harmonious style of the architecture could influence morality, while Ruskin in his book [[The Stones of Venice (book)|''The Stones of Venice'']] examined the architecture of the Italian Renaissance mercantile republics, believing it expressed the spirit of freedom. Architects adopted these ideas in their building of People's Palaces in the north of England and in Scotland, both to assert the cultural credentials of those regions and to provide an improving influence over the citizens of burgeoning industrial towns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00tq3zz BBC Four: ''People's Palaces: The Golden Age of Civic Architecture'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899 [[Joseph Rowntree (philanthropist)|Joseph Rowntree]] and [[Arthur Sherwell]] proposed that People's Houses should be built as part of a programme by the Temperance Party to provide "recreations of the simplest and least exacting kind, such as would specially appeal to those to whom the stress of their daily lives leaves little inclination for anything more than physical relaxation and cheerful intercourse":&lt;ref&gt;Stead, William Thomas. ''The Review of Reviews'', January–June 1899: p. 392 [https://books.google.com/ebooks/reader?id=5WkAAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;pg=GBS.PA392]&lt;/ref&gt; that is, a viable alternative to the [[public house]].

==Russia==
[[File:Moscow, Vvedenskaya Square, Narodny Dom, by Ivanov-Schitz, 1904.jpg|thumb|People's house in Moscow, 1904.]]

The first People's House ({{lang-ru|Народный дом}}) was built in Tomsk in 1882, and several more were erected in the capital of Russia, [[St. Petersburg]] during that decade. By the beginning of the 20th century the capital supported about 20 People's Houses: these provided entertainment, educational clubs for middle-class intelligentsia, petty officials, students, soldiers and workers etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2011-12-04 |url=http://www.musichallspb.ru/2008/03/12/istorija-teatra.html |title=Istoriya Teatra: Ot Narodnogo Doma do Myuzik-Kholla ("From People's House to Music Hall") |publisher=www.musichallspb.ru |year= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120908035909/http://www.musichallspb.ru/2008/03/12/istorija-teatra.html |archivedate=2012-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, a People's House included a library, reading room, theatre, tea rooms, a bookshop, a lecture hall with stage where activities such as Sunday school, evening classes for adults and choral singing might be held. Some included a museum with various types of visual aids used in lectures in the course of systematic training, and which were also used for travelling and permanent exhibitions.

The biggest and most famous People's House opened in Russia was built in [[Alexander Garden (Saint Petersburg)|Alexandrovsky Park]] in 1899-1900, and opened by Tsar Nicholas II, after whom it was named "Extaplishment for People's Entertainment of Emperor Nicholas II" ("Заведение для народных развлечений императора Николая II"), or, in short, "People's House of Emperor Nicholas II "("Narodny Dom Imperatora Nikolaya II").&lt;ref&gt;''Sergey Prokofiev Diaries 1907-1914'' trans.

There was a small nominal entrance charge, with the only extra being charged for a seat at the theater.&lt;ref name=sellers&gt;Edith Sellers: "The Russian Temperance Committees", originally published in ''Contemporary Review'', December 1902: reprinted in ''Public Opinion'', 25 December 1902. [https://books.google.com/ebooks/reader?id=-9gaAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;pg=GBS.PA811]&lt;/ref&gt; The English publication ''Contemporary Review'' noted these facilities, enviously commenting:"it is exactly what our People's palace was intended to be and is not".&lt;ref name=sellers/&gt;

More such People's Houses were built in Moscow and other places in Russia. As a rule, they were usually built in the working-class neighbourhoods. People's houses were subsidized by the Municipal Dumas, country councils and donations of private individuals.

After the [[Revolution of 1917]] term "people's house" was of seldom use. Most people's houses were renamed into the worker's clubs or [[Palace of Culture|Houses of Culture]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==In Western Continental Europe==
In Western Continental Europe, the "people's house" is a generic term used to refer to [[proletarian]] [[community centre]]s located in almost all cities.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

When the labour movement and [[trade union]]s began to organize towards the end of the 19th century, the workers were in great need for premises of their own where they could hold meetings without interference. Opposition against the labour movement from the [[capitalism|capitalists]] and [[landlord]]s was strong and workers were not welcome to use existing premises. [[Landowner]]s even forbade open-air meetings.

The workers in many Western European countries decided to buy their own land and build their own houses. The idea spread all over the country. Construction was funded through co-operative ventures, various forms of contribution and not least voluntary work.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Most Western European "people's houses" were built along a similar model{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} as the "''[[Maison du Peuple]]''" established in Belgium in 1899; that building was built as the headquarters of the [[Belgian Labour Party]].

===Norway===
Antecedents to the modern ''folkets hus'' in Norway were established by [[Marcus Thrane]]'s labour movement in the early 1850s. While the movement itself was short-lived and the branches were few, Thrane's attempt was succeeded by the first "workers' societies" ({{lang-no|Arbeidersamfunn}}) by parish priest [[Honoratus Halling]] in 1850, which were less politically radical. In 1864, Eilert Sundt established the Christian Workers' Society (today known as the [[Oslo Workers' Society]] ({{lang-no|Oslo Arbeidersamfunn}})).

However, when Danish agitator [[Marcus Jantzen]] came to Norway in 1873 to establish a social democratic union, he and his acolytes were prohibited from discussing politics, so meetings organized by Jantzen were held in the open air in [[Tjuvholmen]]; by this time, the labour movement in Norway had taken off and largely associated with labour or socialist parties with similar woes of space for meetings, thus increasing the demand for separate facilities. The first modern people's house was established in Vikersund in 1890, and the oldest still existing is the People's House in Spjærøy, [[Østfold]] (built 1898).

The [[People's House in Oslo]] was established in 1907, and throughout the 20th century, over 200 people's houses were established throughout Norway. The [[People's House Association]] was established in 1947 to represent these establishments, and the People's House Fund is the primary loan provider for people's houses in Norway.

===Spain===
{{main|Casa del pueblo}}
In Spain, the ''casa del pueblo'' ("people's house") is a general term for local branches of both the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|PSOE]] party (although the term has been officially retired from most PSOE offices save for those in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]) and the [[Unión General de Trabajadores]]; in addition, the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT-AIt]] trade union makes use of similar branch offices, although they are largely described as ''ateneo popular'' or ''ateneo obrero'' ("people's university" and "worker's university" respectively).

The term has been used to describe clearing houses of information for Spanish employees and workers, {{cl-span|and often served as schools|date=August 2013|reason="the term ... often served"? does this mean "the name was often used for schools [...]"? or that the peoples houses "often served as schools [...]"?}} for unskilled agricultural and industrial workers. The first was founded by [[Pablo Iglesias Posse|Pablo Iglesias]] in 1908 in Madrid; the office was created in a former ducal palace on Calle del Piemonte, and similar houses were established throughout the country afterwards, particularly in the Basque country and in [[Asturias]].

===Sweden===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}
[[File:1maj 085.jpg|thumb|Folkets hus at [[Norra Bantorget]] in [[Stockholm]]. [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic]] Prime Minister [[Göran Persson]] speaking at [[May Day]] event, 2006.]]
In Sweden "The People's House" ({{lang-sv|Folkets hus}}) is historically associated with organizations affiliated with the [[Swedish labour movement]]. The name is also used for Norwegian and Danish people's houses.

"The people's park" ('''folkets park''') is a prevalent feature of many Swedish towns, serving similar purposes.

In [[Stockholm]], the construction of the first people's house started in 1897 in [[Norra Bantorget]] square. It was opened in 1901, and by 1906 the [[Russia]]n [[Bolshevik]]s and [[Menshevik]]s were welcomed to hold their fourth congress at Stockholm Folkets hus. In 1955 the original Stockholm people's house was demolished, as was most of lower [[Norrmalm]] during the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. It was replaced by the current people's house building, which was built at the same place.

== In Turkey ==
{{main|Halkevleri}}
[[File:Atatürk Pertek Halkevi'nde (1937).jpg|thumb|[[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] visiting Pertek People's House]]
People's Houses ({{lang-tr|Halk Evleri}}) were established in Turkey in 1932, to give formal [[Adult education|education to adults]].&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Kedourie, ''Turkey Before and After Ataturk: Internal and External Affairs'', page 68&lt;/ref&gt; The  People's House developed programs on language and literature, fine arts, library and publications, history. On July 2, 1932, the first Turkish History Conference was assembled in the Ankara People's House. The activities of the people's houses were subsidized from the state treasury, and served all citizens. {{cl-span|[[Yaşar Kemal]]'s early poems to be published besides his folklore studies in the journal of the "Adana People's House".|date=August 2014|reason=besides ... does this mean "next to in the same journal"? or "he had folklore studies published and in a different edition he had poems published? Wouldn't it just be better to put "folklore studies and early poems were published in [...]"?}}

With the establishment of multi-party politics in Turkey, most of the initial initiatives supported by the [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (RPP) began to be questioned during 1945-1951. The opposition [[Democratic Party (Turkey, historical)|Democratic Party]] (DP) wanted to put an end to the People's Houses. The Democratic Party perceived the People's Houses as a strong political institution among the civilians which propagated the RPP's point of view. The DP wanted to cut public expenses to the institution from the government budget. The RPP proposed to reorganize them instead of closing, as they wanted to preserve the institution as part of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk]]'s heritage. The DP, who criticized the houses for closely identifying with the RPP, rejected the proposal; people's houses and property were confiscated once the DP gained a majority in the [[Turkish Grand National Assembly]] in 1951.

==In Italy==
The first ''Casa del Popolo'' ("House of the people") built in Italy was in Massenzatico, a small village in the nearby of Reggio Emilia, on September 9, 1893. The Casa del Popolo was inaugurated by Società Artigiana Cooperativa di Villa Massenzatico, in front of some of the most important Italian and European Socialist Party representants as Camillo Prampolini, Filippo Turati and Emile Vandervelde.  
Many Case del popolo have been retasked, though the name is sometimes used in their later names. The name is also used for businesses that were not originally a "Casa del Popolo", similar to others such as in Brussels where it is used as the name for a restaurant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whatsupin.be/fr/restaurant/10505/casa-del-popolo |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130115045125/http://www.whatsupin.be/fr/restaurant/10505/casa-del-popolo |archivedate=2013-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or in Montreal for a music bar.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.midnightpoutine.ca/city/2009/03/casa_del_popolo_food_not_tunes_an_open_letter&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plagiarism''' is the "wrongful appropriation" and "stealing and publication" of another [[author]]'s "language, thoughts, ideas, or expressions" and the representation of them as one's own [[original work]].&lt;ref name="RandomHouse95"&gt;From the 1995 ''[[Random House Dictionary of the English Language|Random House Compact Unabridged Dictionary]]'': &lt;blockquote&gt;use or close imitation of the language and thoughts of another author and the representation of them as one's own original work&lt;/blockquote&gt; qtd. in {{cite book | title = Library plagiarism policies | first = Vera | last= Stepchyshyn | first2 = Robert S. |last2= Nelson | publisher = Assoc. of College &amp; Resrch Libraries | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-8389-8416-9 | page = 65 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHamIn5dPR8C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OEDdef"&gt;From the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;The action or practice of taking someone else's work, idea, etc., and passing it off as one's own; literary theft.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Plagiarism is considered [[academic dishonesty]] and a breach of [[journalistic ethics]]. It is subject to sanctions such as penalties, suspension, and even [[Expulsion (academia)|expulsion]] from school or work. Recently, cases of "extreme plagiarism" have been identified in academia.&lt;ref name="O'Connor2015"&gt;O'Connor, Z (2015) ''Extreme plagiarism: The rise of the e-Idiot?'', International Journal of Learning in Higher Education, 20 (1), pp1-11. {{ISSN|2327-7955}} [https://www.academia.edu/9975666/Extreme_plagiarism_The_rise_of_the_e-Idiot_2015_]&lt;/ref&gt; The modern concept of plagiarism as immoral and originality as an [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] emerged in Europe in the 18th century, particularly with the [[Romantic movement]].

Plagiarism is not in itself a [[crime]], but can constitute [[copyright infringement]]. In academia and industry, it is a serious [[Ethics|ethical]] offense.&lt;ref name="Lynch02" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SSRN315562" /&gt; Plagiarism and copyright infringement overlap to a considerable extent, but they are not equivalent concepts, and many types of plagiarism do not constitute copyright infringement, which is defined by copyright law and may be adjudicated by courts. Plagiarism is not defined or punished by law, but rather by institutions (including professional associations, educational institutions, and commercial entities, such as publishing companies).

== Etymology ==
In the 1st century, the use of the Latin word ''plagiarius'' (literally "kidnapper") to denote stealing someone else's work was pioneered by the Roman poet [[Martial]], who complained that another poet had "kidnapped his verses". ''Plagiary'', a derivative of ''plagiarus'', was introduced into English in 1601 by dramatist [[Ben Jonson]] during the [[Jacobean Era]] to describe someone guilty of literary theft.&lt;ref name="Lynch02"&gt;Lynch (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Valpy05"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Valpy | first=Francis Edward Jackson | date=2005 | title=Etymological Dictionary of the Latin Language | page=345 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fsWzg7rTEa4C&amp;pg=PA345&amp;dq=etymology+plaga+net&amp;ei=JVxXSq2_GIiEywS8mPSyBw | access-date= | quote=entry for ''plagium'', quotation: "the crime of kidnapping."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The derived form ''plagiarism'' was introduced into English around 1620.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=plagiarism |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=April 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Latin]] ''plagiārius'', "kidnapper", and ''plagium'', "kidnapping", have the root ''plaga'' ("snare", "net"), based on the [[Proto-Indo-European root|Indo-European root]] ''*-plak'', "to weave" (seen for instance in [[Greek language|Greek]] ''plekein'', Bulgarian "плета" ''pleta'', and Latin ''plectere'', all meaning "to weave").

== Legal aspects ==
Although plagiarism in some contexts is considered theft or stealing, the concept does not exist in a legal sense, although the use of someone else's work in order to gain academic credit may meet some legal definitions of [[fraud]].&lt;ref name="link.springer.com"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-981-287-098-8_38|title=Handbook of Academic Integrity|first1=Philip M.|last1=Newton|first2=Christopher|last2=Lang|editor-first=Tracey|editor-last=Bretag|date=1 January 2016|publisher=Springer Singapore|pages=249–271|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1007/978-981-287-098-8_38}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Plagiarism" specifically is not mentioned in any current statute, either [[Criminal law|criminal]] or [[Civil law (common law)|civil]].&lt;ref name="Lands99"&gt;Lands, Robert (1999) [http://www.theaoi.com/articles/texts/1999/decplagiarism.html ''Plagiarism is no Crime''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101213001/http://www.theaoi.com/articles/texts/1999/decplagiarism.html |date=2011-01-01 }} published by The Association of Illustrators (AOI), December 1999. Quotation: &lt;blockquote&gt;Plagiarism may be a taboo in academia, but in art is almost essential.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SSRN315562" /&gt; Some cases may be treated as [[unfair competition]] or a violation of the doctrine of [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]].&lt;ref name="SSRN315562"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Plagiarism, Norms, and the Limits of Theft Law: Some Observations on the Use of Criminal Sanctions in Enforcing Intellectual Property Rights | first = Stuart P. | last = Green | ssrn = 315562 | journal = Hastings Law Journal | volume = 54 | issue = 1 | year = 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased availability of copyrighted material due to the development of information technology has furthered the debate as to whether copyright offences are criminal.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} In short, people are asked to use the guideline, "if you did not write it yourself, you must give credit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/02/education/02cheat.html | title = Plagiarism Lines Blur for Students in Digital Age | first = Trip | last = Gabriel | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plagiarism is not the same as [[copyright infringement]]. While both terms may apply to a particular act, they are different concepts, and false claims of authorship generally constitute plagiarism regardless of whether the material is protected by copyright. Copyright infringement is a violation of the rights of a copyright holder, when material whose use is restricted by copyright is used without consent. Plagiarism, in contrast, is concerned with the unearned increment to the plagiarizing author's reputation, or the obtaining of academic credit, that is achieved through false claims of authorship. Thus, plagiarism is considered a moral offense against the plagiarist's audience (for example, a reader, listener, or teacher).

Plagiarism is also considered a moral offense against anyone who has provided the plagiarist with a benefit in exchange for what is specifically supposed to be original content (for example, the plagiarist's publisher, employer, or teacher). In such cases,  acts of plagiarism may sometimes also form part of a claim for [[breach of contract|breach]] of the plagiarist's contract, or, if done knowingly, for a [[Tort|civil wrong]].

== In academia and journalism ==
Within [[academia]], plagiarism by students, professors, or researchers is considered [[academic dishonesty]] or academic fraud, and offenders are subject to academic censure, up to and including [[Expulsion (academia)|expulsion]]. Some institutions use [[Plagiarism detection|plagiarism detection software]] to uncover potential plagiarism and to deter students from plagiarizing. Some universities address the issue of academic integrity by providing students with thorough orientations, required writing courses, and clearly articulated honor codes{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. Indeed, there is a virtually uniform understanding among college students that plagiarism is wrong{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. Nevertheless, each year students are brought before their institutions’ disciplinary boards on charges that they have misused sources in their schoolwork."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lipson|first=Abigail|year=2003|title=The Responsible Plagiarist|url=|journal=About Campus|volume=8- issue 3|pages=7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the practice of plagiarizing by use of sufficient word substitutions to elude detection software, known as [[rogeting]], has rapidly evolved as students and unethical academics seek to stay ahead of detection software.&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grove|first1=Jack|title=Sinister buttocks? Roget would blush at the crafty cheek  Middlesex lecturer gets to the bottom of meaningless phrases found while marking essays|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/sinister-buttocks-roget-would-blush-at-the-crafty-cheek/2015027.article|accessdate=15 July 2015|publisher=Times Higher Education|date=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An extreme form of plagiarism, known as [[contract cheating]] involves students paying someone else, such as an [[essay mill]], to do their work for them.&lt;ref name="link.springer.com" /&gt;

In [[journalism]], plagiarism is considered a breach of [[journalistic ethics]], and reporters caught plagiarizing typically face disciplinary measures ranging from suspension to termination of employment{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. Some individuals caught plagiarizing in academic or journalistic contexts claim that they plagiarized unintentionally, by failing to include [[quotation]]s or give the appropriate [[citation]]. While plagiarism in scholarship and journalism has a centuries-old history, the development of the [[Internet]], where articles appear as electronic text, has made the physical act of copying the work of others much easier.&lt;ref&gt;Susan D. Blum, ''My Word!: Plagiarism and College Culture'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Predicated upon an expected level of learning/comprehension having been achieved, all associated academic accreditation becomes seriously undermined if plagiarism is allowed to become the norm within academic submissions.&lt;ref&gt;Cully, P. Plagiarism avoidance in academic submissions. Dublin Institute of Technology, 2013. Full PDF available for download at: http://arrow.dit.ie/bescharcoth/4/&lt;/ref&gt;

For professors and researchers, plagiarism is punished by sanctions ranging from suspension to termination, along with the loss of credibility and perceived integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kock | first1 = N | authorlink = Ned Kock | doi = 10.1145/306549.306594 | title = A case of academic plagiarism | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 42 | issue = 7 | pages = 96–104 |date=July 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ned Kock|Kock, N.]], Davison, R.

=== Academia ===
[[File:Example-of-Article-Plagiarism-Diagram.png|thumb|One form of academic plagiarism involves appropriating a published article and modifying it slightly to avoid suspicion.]] No universally adopted definition of academic plagiarism exists&lt;ref&gt;Eaton, S. E. (2017). [https://prism.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/handle/1880/106472/Eaton-2017.pdf?sequence=2 Comparative Analysis of Institutional Policy Definitions of Plagiarism: A Pan-Canadian University Study]. ''Interchange: A Quarterly Review of Education, 48''(3), 271-281. doi:10.1007/s10780-017-9300-7&lt;/ref&gt;; however, this section provides several definitions to exemplify the most common characteristics of academic plagiarism.

According to Bela Gipp&lt;ref name="Gipp14"&gt;{{cite book | last = Gipp | first = Bela |
url=https://www.springer.com/springer+vieweg/it+%26+informatik/k%C3%BCnstliche+intelligenz/book/978-3-658-06393-1 |title=Citation-based Plagiarism Detection: Detecting Disguised and Cross-language Plagiarism using Citation Pattern Analysis | publisher = Springer Vieweg | year = 2014 | isbn = 978-3-658-06393-1}} p.10&lt;/ref&gt;  academic plagiarism encompasses:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The use of ideas, concepts, words, or structures &lt;br /&gt; without appropriately acknowledging the source &lt;br /&gt; to benefit in a setting where originality is expected."&lt;ref name="Gipp14" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The definition by B. Gipp is an abridged version of Teddi Fishman's definition of plagiarism, which proposed five elements characteristic of plagiarism.&lt;ref name="Fishman09"&gt;{{cite news | last = Fishman | first = Teddi | url = http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/09-4apcei/4apcei-Fishman.pdf |format=PDF|title=We know it when we see it is not good enough:  toward a standard definition of plagiarism that transcends theft, fraud, and copyright | publisher = Proceedings of the 4th Asia Pacific Conference on Educational Integrity |date=Sep 28–30, 2009}} p.5&lt;/ref&gt; According to T. Fishman, plagiarism occurs when someone:
#  Uses words, ideas, or work products
#  Attributable to another identifiable person or source
#  Without attributing the work to the source from which it was obtained
#  In a situation in which there is a legitimate expectation of original authorship
#  In order to obtain some benefit, credit, or gain which need not be monetary&lt;ref name="Fishman09" /&gt;

Furthermore, plagiarism is defined differently among institutions of higher learning and universities:

* [[Stanford University|Stanford]] sees plagiarism as the "use, without giving reasonable and appropriate credit to or acknowledging the author or source, of another person's original work, whether such work is made up of code, formulas, ideas, language, research, strategies, writing or other form."&lt;ref&gt;[http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/judicialaffairs/integrity/plagiarism "What is Plagiarism"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026061453/http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/judicialaffairs/integrity/plagiarism |date=2012-10-26 }}. Stanford University. 2012-07-27.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Yale University|Yale]] views plagiarism as the "... use of another's work, words, or ideas without attribution," which includes "... using a source's language without quoting, using information from a source without attribution, and paraphrasing a source in a form that stays too close to the original."
* [[Princeton University|Princeton]] perceives plagiarism as the "deliberate" use of "someone else's language, ideas, or other original (not common-knowledge) material without acknowledging its source."&lt;ref&gt;[http://wpacouncil.org/positions/WPAplagiarism.pdf "Defining and Avoiding Plagiarism: The WPA Statement on Best Practices"]. Princeton University. 2012-07-27&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Oxford College of Emory University]] characterizes plagiarism as the use of "a writer's ideas or phraseology without giving due credit."&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxford.emory.edu/audiences/current_students/Academic/academic-success/student-honor-code/ "Student Honor Code"]. Emory: Oxford College. 2012-07-27.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Brown University|Brown]] defines plagiarism as "... appropriating another person's ideas or words (spoken or written) without attributing those word or ideas to their true source."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.lib.brown.edu/libweb/plagiarism.php "What is plagiarism?"]. Brown University Library. 2012-07-27&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[United States Naval Academy|The U.S. Naval Academy]] defines plagiarism as "the use of the words, information, insights, or ideas of another without crediting that person through proper citation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://libguides.usna.edu/c.php?g=410493&amp;p=2795948 USNA Statements on Plagiarism - Avoiding Plagiarism] US Naval Academy, Retrieved April 5, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Common forms of student plagiarism ====

According to a 2015 survey of teachers and professors by [[Turnitin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Plagiarism Spectrum |url=http://go.turnitin.com/paper/plagiarism-spectrum |publisher=Turnitin |accessdate=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are 10 main forms of plagiarism that students commit:
&lt;!--THERE ARE PUBLISHED WORKS ON THIS, WHY ARE WE CITING THIS LOCAL UNIVERSITY WEB INFORMATION? SEE LIPSON'S WORK AT https://www.amazon.com/Doing-Honest-Work-College-Plagiarism/dp/0226484777, AND OTHER SUCH SOURCES.--&gt;
# Submitting someone's work as their own.
# Taking passages from their own previous work without adding citations.
# Re-writing someone's work without properly citing sources.
# Using quotations, but not citing the source.
# Interweaving various sources together in the work without citing.
# Citing some, but not all passages that should be cited.
# Melding together cited and uncited sections of the piece.
# Providing proper citations, but fails to change the structure and wording of the borrowed ideas enough.
# Inaccurately citing the source.
# Relying too heavily on other people's work. Fails to bring original thought into the text.

==== Sanctions for student plagiarism ====
In the academic world, plagiarism by students is usually considered a very serious offense that can result in punishments such as a failing grade on the particular assignment, the entire course, or even being expelled from the institution{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. Generally, the punishment increases as a person enters higher institutions of learning{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}. The seriousness with which academic institutions address student plagiarism may be tempered by a recognition that students may not fully understand what plagiarism is. A 2015 study showed that students who were new to university study did not have a good understanding of even the basic requirements of how to attribute sources in written academic work, yet students were very confident that they understood what referencing and plagiarism are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Academic integrity: a quantitative study of confidence and understanding in students at the start of their higher education|journal = Assessment &amp; Evaluation in Higher Education|first=Philip|last=Newton|date=2 April 2016|volume=41|issue=3|pages=482–497|doi=10.1080/02602938.2015.1024199}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same students also had a lenient view of how plagiarism should be penalised.

For cases of repeated plagiarism, or for cases in which a student commits severe plagiarism (e.g., purchasing an assignment), suspension or [[Expulsion (education)|expulsion]] may occur. There has been historic concern about inconsistencies in penalties administered for university student plagiarism, and a plagiarism tariff was devised in 2008 for UK higher education institutions in an attempt to encourage some standardization of approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.plagiarismadvice.org/BTariff.pdf |title=Benchmark Plagiarism Tariff |first1=Peter |last1=Tennant |first2=Gill |last2=Rowell |year=2009–2010 |website=plagiarism advice.org |publisher=iParadigms Europe |format=PDF |accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, to impose sanctions, plagiarism needs to be detected. Strategies faculty members use to detect plagiarism include carefully reading students work and making note of inconsistencies in student writing, citation errors and providing plagiarism prevention education to students.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Colella-Sandercock, J. A., &amp; Alahmadi, H. W. (2015). Plagiarism education: Strategies for instructors. ''International Journal of Learning, Teaching and Educational Research, 13''(1), 76-84. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://ijlter.org/index.php/ijlter/article/view/395/190&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found that a significant share of (university) teachers do not use detection methods such as using text-matching software.&lt;ref name="Sattler2015"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/03075079.2015.1085007|title = The use frequency of 10 different methods for preventing and detecting academic dishonesty and the factors influencing their use| journal=Studies in Higher Education| volume=42| issue=6| pages=1126–1144|year = 2017|last1 = Sattler|first1 = Sebastian| last2=Wiegel| first2=Constantin| last3=Veen| first3=Floris van}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few more try to detect plagiarism by reading term-papers specifically for plagiarism, while the latter method might be not very effective in detecting plagiarism – especially when plagiarism from unfamiliar sources needs to be detected.&lt;ref name="Sattler2015" /&gt; There are checklists of tactics to prevent student plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Practical Prevention of Plagiarism for University Faculty &amp; Management – 14 Tactics|last=Dawes|first=John|date=20 July 2018|ssrn = 3209034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Criminal and negative behaviour by diploma mills ====
{{one source|section|date=May 2017}}
There are allegations that some diploma mills{{discuss|diploma mills (sic)}} take students' money for essays, then produce a low standard essay or close their websites without providing the purchased essay.  Students then have little time to provide an essay before a deadline.  Also diploma mills have allegedly [[blackmail]]ed students demanding more money than was originally agreed and threatening to reveal plagiarism to the university unless more money is paid.  Sorana Vieru of the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|NUS]] said, “We would urge those who are struggling to seek support through their unions and universities rather than looking to a quick fix, and be aware that using these websites could cost not only money but jeopardise their qualifications.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/may/19/students-warned-against-using-essay-mill-sites-to-write-dissertations Students warned against using 'essay mill' sites to write dissertations] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

There are calls for diploma mills to be made illegal in the United Kingdom, in New Zealand and some juristictions in the United States they are already illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-45640236 University bosses call for ban on essay-writing companies] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Plagiarism education ====
Given the serious consequences that plagiarism has for students, there has been a call for a greater emphasis on learning in order to help students avoid committing plagiarism.&lt;ref name="ireland"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264452242_Let_Them_Plagiarise_Developing_Academic_Writing_in_a_Safe_Environment|title=Let Them Plagiarise: Developing Academic Writing in a Safe Environment|first1=Chris|last1=Ireland|first2=University of|last2=Huddersfield|first3=|last3=UK|first4=John|last4=English|first5=University of|last5=Huddersfield|first6=|last6=UK|date=1 October 2011|publisher=|volume=1|issue=1|pages=165–172|doi=10.18552/joaw.v1i1.10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leung, C.

==== Factors influencing student´s decision to plagiarize ====
Several studies investigated factors that influence the decision to plagiarize. For example, a panel study with students from German universities found that academic procrastination predicts the frequency plagiarism conducted within six months followed the measurement of academic procrastination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Patrzek | first1 = J. | last2 = Sattler | first2 = S. | last3 = van Veen | first3 = F. | last4 = Grunschel | first4 = C. | last5 = Fries | first5 = S. | year = 2014 | title = Investigating the Effect of Academic Procrastination on the Frequency and Variety of Academic Misconduct: A Panel Study | url = | journal = Studies in Higher Education | volume = | issue = | pages = 1–16| doi = 10.1080/03075079.2013.854765 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that by plagiarizing students cope with the negative consequences that result from academic procrastination such as poor grades. Another study found that plagiarism is more frequent if students perceive plagiarism as beneficial and if they have the opportunity to plagiarize.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Sattler, Peter Graeff, Sebastian Willen: ''Explaining the Decision to Plagiarize: An Empirical Test of the Interplay Between Rationality, Norms, and Opportunity.'' In: ''Deviant Behavior.'' 34, 2013, S.&amp;nbsp;444–463, [[doi:10.1080/01639625.2012.735909]].&lt;/ref&gt; When students had expected higher sanctions and when they had internalized social norms that define plagiarism as very objectionable, plagiarism was less likely to occur.

=== Journalism ===
Since journalism relies on the public trust, a reporter's failure to honestly acknowledge their sources undercuts a newspaper or television news show's integrity and undermines its credibility. Journalists accused of plagiarism are often suspended from their reporting tasks while the charges are being investigated by the news organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.famousplagiarists.com/journalism.htm |title=Journalism  |website=Famous Plagiarists.com / War On Plagiarism.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226090147/http://famousplagiarists.com/journalism.htm |archivedate=26 February 2007|accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-plagiarism ===
{{See also|Duplicate publication}}
The reuse of significant, identical, or nearly identical portions of one's own work without acknowledging that one is doing so or citing the original work is sometimes described as "self-plagiarism"; the term "recycling fraud" has also been used to describe this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dellavalle | first = Robert P. | last2 = Banks | first2 = Marcus A. | last3 = Ellis | first3 = Jeffrey I. |date=September 2007 | title = Frequently asked questions regarding self-plagiarism: How to avoid recycling fraud | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology | volume = 57 | issue = 3 | page = 527 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaad.2007.05.018 | pmid = 17707155 | pmc = 2679117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Articles of this nature are often referred to as duplicate or [[multiple publication]]. In addition there can be a copyright issue if copyright of the prior work has been transferred to another entity. Self-plagiarism is considered a serious ethical issue in settings where someone asserts that a publication consists of new material, such as in publishing or factual documentation.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Attwood. [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=402598 "Allow me to rephrase, and boost my tally of articles"]. Times Higher Education. 3 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It does not apply to public-interest texts, such as social, professional, and cultural opinions usually published in newspapers and magazines.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In academic fields, self-plagiarism occurs when an author reuses portions of their own published and copyrighted work in subsequent publications, but without attributing the previous publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hexham |first=Irving |year=2005 |title=The Plague of Plagiarism: Academic Plagiarism Defined |website=UCalgary.ca |url=http://people.ucalgary.ca/~hexham/content/articles/plague-of-plagiarism.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Roig, M.

Retrieved from http://www.biochemia-medica.com/content/plagiarism-and-self-plagiarism-what-every-author-should-know&lt;/ref&gt; Identifying self-plagiarism is often difficult because limited reuse of material is accepted both legally (as [[fair use]]) and ethically.&lt;ref name="Samuelson, Pamela. (1994)"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Samuelson | first1 = Pamela | authorlink = Pamela Samuelson | doi = 10.1145/179606.179731 | title = Self-plagiarism or fair use? | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 37 | issue = 8 | pages = 21–5 |date=August 1994 | url = http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~pam/papers/SelfPlagiarism.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== A contested definition ====
Miguel Roig has written at length about the topic of self-plagiarism&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roig, M. (2005). Re-using text from one’s own previously published papers: An exploratory study of potential self-plagiarism. ''Psychological Reports, 2005''(97), 43-49. doi:10.2466/pr0.97.1.43-49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roig, M. (2011). ''Avoiding plagiarism, self-plagiarism, and other questionable writing practices: A guide to ethical writing''. U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services: Office of Research Integrity Retrieved from https://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enCA728CA728&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roig, M. (2015). On reusing our previously disseminated work. ''American Association for the Advancement of Science''. Retrieved from https://www.aaas.org/news/reusing-our-previously-disseminated-work&lt;/ref&gt; and his definition of self-plagiarism as using previously disseminated work is widely accepted among scholars of the topic. However, the "self-plagiarism" has been challenged as being self-contradictory, an [[oxymoron]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Broome | first1 = M | title = Self-plagiarism: Oxymoron, fair use, or scientific misconduct? | doi = 10.1016/j.outlook.2004.10.001 | journal = Nursing Outlook | volume = 52 | issue = 6 | pages = 273–4 |date=November 2004 | pmid = 15614263 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on other grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Andreescu | first1 = Liviu | title = Self-Plagiarism in Academic Publishing: The Anatomy of a Misnomer | doi = 10.1007/s11948-012-9416-1 | journal = Science and Engineering Ethics |date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, Stephanie J. Bird&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bird | first1 = SJ | title = Self-plagiarism and dual and redundant publications: what is the problem? Commentary on 'Seven ways to plagiarize: handling real allegations of research misconduct' | doi = 10.1007/s11948-002-0007-4 | journal = Science and Engineering Ethics | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 543–4 |date=October 2002 | pmid = 12501723 }}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that self-plagiarism is a misnomer, since by definition plagiarism concerns the use of others' material. Bird identifies the ethical issues of "self-plagiarism" as those of "dual or redundant publication." She also notes that in an educational context, "self-plagiarism" refers to the case of a student who resubmits "the same essay for credit in two different courses." As David B. Resnik clarifies, "Self-plagiarism involves dishonesty but not intellectual theft."&lt;ref&gt;See Resnik, David B. (1998). ''The Ethics of Science: an introduction'', London: Routledge. p.177, notes to chapter six, note 3. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zMn2KxPQyk8C&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=%22self-plagiarism%22&amp;lr=&amp;pg=PA177 Online via Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Patrick M. Scanlon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.5240451.0002.007 | author = Scanlon, PM | year = 2007 | title = Song from myself: an anatomy of self-plagiarism | journal = Plagiary | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–11 | accessdate=2010-08-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Self-plagiarism" is a term with some specialized currency. Most prominently, it is used in discussions of research and publishing integrity in biomedicine, where heavy publish-or-perish demands have led to a rash of duplicate and "salami-slicing" publication, the reporting of a single study's results in "[[least publishable unit]]s" within multiple articles (Blancett, Flanagin, &amp; Young, 1995; Jefferson, 1998; Kassirer &amp; Angell, 1995; Lowe, 2003; McCarthy, 1993; Schein &amp; Paladugu, 2001; Wheeler, 1989). Roig (2002) offers a useful classification system including four types of self-plagiarism: duplicate publication of an article in more than one journal; partitioning of one study into multiple publications, often called salami-slicing; text recycling; and copyright infringement.

==== Codes of ethics ====
Some academic journals have codes of ethics that specifically refer to self-plagiarism. For example, the ''Journal of International Business Studies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Lorraine Eden |url=http://palgrave-journals.com/jibs/jibs_ethics_code.html |title=JIBS Code of Ethics |publisher=Journal of International Business Studies |accessdate=2010-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723212122/http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/jibs_ethics_code.html |archivedate=2010-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some professional organizations like the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) have created policies that deal specifically with self-plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=June 2010 | title = ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism | url=http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other organizations do not make specific reference to self-plagiarism such as the American Political Science Association (APSA). The organization published a code of ethics that describes plagiarism as "...deliberate appropriation of the works of others represented as one's own." It does not make any reference to self-plagiarism. It does say that when a thesis or dissertation is published "in whole or in part", the author is "not ordinarily under an ethical obligation to acknowledge its origins."&lt;ref&gt;American Political Science Association (2008). [http://www.apsanet.org/imgtest/ethicsguideweb.pdf "A Guide to Professional Ethics in Political Science"]. Second Edition. Section 21.1. {{ISBN|1-878147-05-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The American Society for Public Administration (ASPA) also published a code of ethics that says its members are committed to: "Ensure that others receive credit for their work and contributions," but it makes no reference to self-plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;American Society for Public Administration. [http://www.aspanet.org/scriptcontent/index_codeofethics.cfm "ASPA's Code of Ethics"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124015330/http://www.aspanet.org/scriptcontent/index_codeofethics.cfm |date=2011-01-24 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Factors that justify reuse ====
[[Pamela Samuelson]], in 1994, identified several factors she says excuse reuse of one's previously published work, that make it not self-plagiarism.&lt;ref name="Samuelson, Pamela. (1994)" /&gt; She relates each of these factors specifically to the ethical issue of self-plagiarism, as distinct from the legal issue of fair use of copyright, which she deals with separately. Among other factors that may excuse reuse of previously published material Samuelson lists the following:

# The previous work must be restated to lay the groundwork for a new contribution in the second work.
# Portions of the previous work must be repeated to deal with new evidence or arguments.
# The audience for each work is so different that publishing the same work in different places is necessary to get the message out.
# The author thinks they said it so well the first time that it makes no sense to say it differently a second time.

Samuelson states she has relied on the "different audience" rationale when attempting to bridge interdisciplinary communities. She refers to writing for different legal and technical communities, saying: "there are often paragraphs or sequences of paragraphs that can be bodily lifted from one article to the other. And, in truth, I lift them." She refers to her own practice of converting "a technical article into a law review article with relatively few changes—adding footnotes and one substantive section" for a different audience.&lt;ref name="Samuelson, Pamela. (1994)" /&gt;

Samuelson describes misrepresentation as the basis of self-plagiarism.&lt;ref name="Samuelson, Pamela. (1994)" /&gt; She also states "Although it seems not to have been raised in any of the self-plagiarism cases, copyrights law's fair use defense would likely provide a shield against many potential publisher claims of copyright infringement against authors who reused portions of their previous works."&lt;ref name="Samuelson, Pamela. (1994)" /&gt;

=== Organizational publications ===
Plagiarism is presumably not an issue when organizations issue collective unsigned works since they do not assign credit for originality to particular people. For example, the [[American Historical Association]]'s "Statement on Standards of Professional Conduct" (2005) regarding textbooks and reference books states that, since textbooks and encyclopedias are summaries of other scholars' work, they are not bound by the same exacting standards of attribution as original research and may be allowed a greater "extent of dependence" on other works.&lt;ref name=AHA&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.historians.org/PUBS/Free/ProfessionalStandards.cfm | title = Statement on Standards of Professional Conduct | date = 2005-01-06 | accessdate=2009-04-16 | publisher = American Historical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even such a book does not make use of words, phrases, or paragraphs from another text or follow too closely the other text's arrangement and organization, and the authors of such texts are also expected to "acknowledge the sources of recent or distinctive findings and interpretations, those not yet a part of the common understanding of the profession."&lt;ref name=AHA /&gt;

== In the arts ==
=== The history of the arts ===
Through all of the [[history of literature]] and [[History of art|of the arts]] in general, works of art are for a large part repetitions of the [[Poetic tradition|tradition]]; to the entire history of [[artistic creativity]] belong plagiarism, literary theft, [[Appropriation (art)|appropriation]], incorporation, retelling, rewriting, recapitulation, revision, reprise, [[thematic variation]], ironic retake, [[parody]], imitation, stylistic theft, [[pastiche]]s, [[collage]]s, and deliberate [[Assemblage (art)|assemblages]].&lt;ref name="Derrida01p57"&gt; Derrida [1959] quotation: (p.40):{{full|date=April 2017}} "The boundaries between permissible and impermissible, imitation, stylistic plagiarism, copy, replica and forgery remain nebulous."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eco90"&gt;Eco (1990) p. 95 quotation:
{{quotation|Each of the types of repetition that we have examined is not limited to the mass media but belongs by right to the entire history of artistic creativity; plagiarism, quotation, parody, the ironic retake are typical of the entire artistic-literary tradition. &lt;br /&gt; Much art has been and is repetitive. The concept of absolute originality is a contemporary one, born with Romanticism; classical art was in vast measure serial, and the "modern" avant-garde (at the beginning of this century) challenged the Romantic idea of "creation from nothingness," with its techniques of collage, mustachios on the Mona Lisa, art about art, and so on.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lands99" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Alfrey"&gt;Alfrey (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Genette [1982] note 3 to ch. 7, p. 433. quotation: {{quotation|"transposition"... all the other possible terms (rewriting, rehandling, remake, revision, refection, recasting, etc.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steiner98pp437-459" /&gt; There is no rigorous and precise distinction between practices like imitation, stylistic plagiarism, [[Copying|copy]], [[replica]] and [[forgery]].&lt;ref name="Derrida01p57" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Haywood87p109Arnau"&gt;Haywood (1987) p.109, quoting Arnau&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eco87p202Arnau"&gt;Eco (1987) p.202, quoting Arnau&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arnau59p40"&gt;Arnau [1959] quotation: (p. 40) "The boundaries between permissible and impermissible, imitation, stylistic plagiarism, copy, replica and forgery remain nebulous."&lt;/ref&gt; These appropriation procedures are the main axis of a literate culture, in which the tradition of the canonic past is being constantly rewritten.&lt;ref name="Steiner98pp437-459"&gt;Steiner (1998) pp. 437, 459 quotation:
{{quotation|(p. 437) There is between 'translation proper' and 'transmutation' a vast terrain of 'partial transformation'. The verbal signs in the original message or statement are modified by one of a multitude of means or by a combination of means. These include [[Paraphrasing of copyrighted material|paraphrase]], graphic illustration, pastiche, imitation, thematic variation, parody, citation in a supporting or undermining context, false attribution (accidental or deliberate), plagiarism, collage, and many others. This zone of partial transformation, of derivation, of alternate restatement determines much of our sensibility and literacy. It is, quite simply, the matrix of culture.

(p. 459) We could, in some measure, at least, come closer to a verifiable gradation of the sequence of techniques and aims, which leads from literal translation through paraphrases, mimesis, and pastiche to thematic variation. I have suggested that this sequence is the main axis of a literate culture, that a culture advances, spiralwise, via translations of its own canonic past.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth Graham quotes [[T.S. Eliot]]—"Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal. Bad poets deface what they take."—she notes that despite the "taboo" of plagiarism, the ill-will and embarrassment it causes in the modern context, readers seem to often forgive the past excesses of historic literary offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Graham |first=Ruth |url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/article/247130 |title=Word Theft |publisher=Poetryfoundation.org |date=January 7, 2014 |accessdate=2014-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Praisings of artistic plagiarism ===
A passage of [[Laurence Sterne]]'s 1767 ''[[Tristram Shandy]]'' condemns plagiarism by resorting to plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Ford [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n23/mark-ford/love-and-theft Love and Theft] [[London Review of Books]] Vol. 26 No. 23 · 2 December 2004 pages 34–35 | 4103 words&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oliver Goldsmith]] commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sterne's Writings, in which it is clearly shewn, that he, whose manner and style were so long thought original, was, in fact, the most unhesitating plagiarist who ever cribbed from his predecessors in order to garnish his own pages. It must be owned, at the same time, that Sterne selects the materials of his mosaic work with so much art, places them so well, and polishes them so highly, that in most cases we are disposed to pardon the want of originality, in consideration of the exquisite talent with which the borrowed materials are wrought up into the new form.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oliver Goldsmith]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=qEMVAAAAYAAJ The vicar of Wakefield: a tale, Volume 5] p.xviii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== In other contexts ==

=== On the Internet ===
Free online tools are becoming available to help identify plagiarism,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-5663303-7.html "Apple accused of copyright wrongs"] CNET&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2005/08/30/copyscape-searches-for-scraped-content|title=Copyscape Searches For Scraped Content|publisher=WebProNews|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221143230/http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2005/08/30/copyscape-searches-for-scraped-content|archivedate=2007-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are a range of approaches that attempt to limit online copying, such as [[Digital rights management|disabling]] [[Right-click#Common mouse operations|right clicking]] and placing warning banners regarding copyrights on web pages. Instances of plagiarism that involve copyright violation may be addressed by the rightful content owners sending a [[DMCA]] removal notice to the offending site-owner, or to the [[ISP]] that is hosting the offending site. The term "content scraping" has arisen to describe the copying and pasting of information from websites&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2006-07-31-net-plagiarism_x.htm | title = Authorship gets lost on Web | work = [[USA Today]] | date = August 1, 2006 | first = Del | last = Jones }}&lt;/ref&gt; and blogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2006/05/08/online_plagiarism_strikes_blog_world/ | title = Online plagiarism strikes blog world | work = [[The Boston Globe]] | first = Maura | last = Welch | date = May 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13223">'''"Rabbit rabbit rabbit"''' is a [[superstition]] found in Britain and North America wherein a person says or repeats the words "[[rabbit]]", "rabbits" and/or "white rabbits" aloud upon waking on the first day of a month, to ensure good luck for the rest of it.

==Origins and history==
The exact origin of the superstition is unknown, though it was recorded in ''[[Notes and Queries]]'' as being said by children in 1909:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"My two daughters are in the habit of saying 'Rabbits!' on the first day of each month. The word must be spoken aloud, and be the first word said in the month. It brings luck for that month. Other children, I find, use the same formula."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In response to this note another contributor said that his daughter believed that the outcome would be a present, and that the word must be spoken up the chimney to be most effective; another pointed out that the word ''rabbit'' was often used in expletives, and suggested that the superstition may be a survival of the ancient belief in swearing as a means of avoiding evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

It appeared in a work of fiction in 1922:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Why," the man in the brown hat laughed at him, "I thought everybody knew 'Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit.'  If you say 'Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit'—three times, just like that—first thing in the morning on the first of the month, even before you say your prayers, you'll get a present before the end of the month."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lynd, &lt;cite&gt;Solomon in All his Glory&lt;/cite&gt; (London, 1922), p. 49. [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015048888161]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chapter 1 of the [[Trixie Belden]] story ''The Mystery of the Emeralds'' (1962) is titled “Rabbit! Rabbit!” and discusses the tradition:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Trixie Belden awoke slowly, with the sound of a summer rain beating against her window. She half-opened her eyes, stretched her arms above her head, and then, catching sight of a large sign tied to the foot of her bed, yelled out, “Rabbit! Rabbit!” She bounced out of bed and ran out of her room and down the hall. “I’ve finally done it!” she cried [...] “Well, ever since I was Bobby’s age I’ve been trying to remember to say ‘Rabbit! Rabbit!’ and make a wish just before going to sleep on the last night of the month. If you say it again in the morning, before you’ve said another word, your wish comes true.” Trixie laughed."&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Kenny, &lt;cite&gt;The Mystery of the Emeralds&lt;/cite&gt; (1962), p. 1. [http://www.trixie-belden.com/books/series/book14.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the United States the tradition appears especially well known in northern [[New England]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yankeemagazine.com/article/marysfarm/rabbit#_ |title=Saying Rabbit, Rabbit - The Luck of the English |author=Edie Clark |date= |work=Yankee |accessdate=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wdea.am/the-first-of-the-month-brings-the-luck-of-the-rabbit/ |title=The First of the Month Brings the Luck of the Rabbit |author=Chris Popper |date=September 30, 2012 |publisher=WDEA Ellsworth, Maine |accessdate=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://goodmorninggloucester.wordpress.com/2011/12/01/did-you-know-rabbit-rabbit/ |title=Did You Know?

The superstition may be related to the broader belief in the rabbit or hare being a "lucky" animal, as exhibited in the practice of carrying a [[rabbit's foot]] for luck.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book | last1 = Panati | first1 = Charles | title = Extraordinary Origins of Everyday Things | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 1989 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hI9Weq6q9dEC&amp;dq | accessdate = 2013-04-02 | isbn = 978-0060964191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mid-1990s, [[United States|U.S.]] children's [[Cable television|cable]] channel [[Nickelodeon]] helped popularize the superstition in the United States as part of its "Nick Days," where during commercial breaks it would show an ad about the significance of the current date, whether it be an actual holiday, a largely uncelebrated unofficial holiday, or a made-up day if nothing else is going on that specific day. (The latter would be identified as a "Nickelodeon holiday.") Nickelodeon would promote the last day of each month as "Rabbit Rabbit Day" and to remind kids to say it the next day, unless the last day of that specific month was an actual holiday, such as [[Halloween]] or [[New Year's Eve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rose |first=Penny |url=http://www.thecheekybunny.com/2010/12/rabbit-rabbit-day.html |title=Rabbit Rabbit Day!! |publisher=The Cheeky Bunny |date=2010-12-01 |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116191100/http://www.thecheekybunny.com/2010/12/rabbit-rabbit-day.html |archivedate=2014-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice stopped by the late 1990s.

Rabbits have not always been thought of as lucky, however. In the 19th century, for example, fishermen would not say the word while at sea,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other traditions==

There is another folk tradition which may use a variation "Rabbit", "Bunny", "I hate/love Grey Rabbits" or "White Rabbit" to ward off smoke that the wind is directing into your face when gathered around a campfire.&lt;ref&gt;http://folklore.usc.edu/?p=27779&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that this tradition may be related to the tradition of invoking the rabbit on the first of the month. Others conjecture that it may originate with a North American First Nation story about smoke resembling rabbit fur.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.quora.com/Where-does-the-I-hate-white-rabbits-campfire-tradition-come-from&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition may be more of a social tradition in a group setting than a genuine belief that certain words will change the wind direction, and may be more of a childhood tradition than an adult one. Children have sometimes adapted from Rabbit to "Pink Elephant" or other comical derivatives.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/d6eki/what_did_you_do_as_a_kid_when_campfire_smoke_blew/&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this more mutable usage, historical record of this is even more scarce than other more static meanings.

As with all folklore, its truth is made evident even in its only occasional fulfillment: should the wind then appear to change direction, others will interpret the use of such an expression as evidence of its effectiveness and will then tend to adopt and repeat its use.  That multiple instances of its ''in''effectiveness also exist is discounted in light of the "fact" that it appeared to work once.

==Variants==
&lt;!-- ############# Please only add variations for which you can cite a good reliable source! ############### --&gt;
As with most [[folklore]], which is traditionally spread by word of mouth, there are numerous variants of the superstition, in some cases specific to a certain time period or region.

The '''''Schrödinger's Cat Trilogy''''' is a [[trilogy]] of novels by American writer [[Robert Anton Wilson]] consisting of '''''The Universe Next Door''''', '''''The Trick Top Hat''''', and '''''The Homing Pigeons''''', each illustrating a different [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretation of quantum physics]]. Wilson is also co-author of ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'', and ''Schrödinger's Cat'' is a sequel of sorts, re-using several of the same characters and carrying on many of the themes of the earlier work.

The one-volume edition currently in print is significantly shorter than the original three-volume edition. This is not a difference in print size or removal of redundant "recaps"; it is missing a noticeable amount of material, including many entire chapters.

The name [[Schrödinger's Cat]] comes from a [[thought experiment]] in [[quantum mechanics]]. The first book, ''The Universe Next Door'', takes place in different universes in accord with the [[Many-worlds interpretation|many worlds interpretation]] of quantum physics; in the second, ''The Trick Top Hat'', characters are unknowingly connected through [[quantum nonlocality|non-locality]], i.e., having once crossed paths they are joined in [[quantum entanglement]]; and the third book, ''The Homing Pigeons'', places characters in an "observer-created universe" in which [[Mind-body problem|Consciousness Causes the Collapse]] of the [[wavefunction]].

Taking place in Unistat, which is the novel's [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel]] to the [[United States]], the novels have intertwining plots involving a wide array of characters, including:

* [[Epicene]] Wildeblood, a.k.a. Mary Margaret Wildeblood, a [[transsexual]] woman who throws great parties
* Frank Dashwood, president of Orgasm Research
* [[Markoff Chaney]], a prankster
* Hugh Crane, a.k.a. Cagliostro the Great, a [[mysticism|mystic]] and magician
* Furbish Lousewart V, author and President of Unistat
* Marvin Gardens, author and [[cocaine]] addict
* Eve Hubbard, scientist and alternate President of Unistat

==Series summary==
In ''The Universe Next Door'', the [[President]] of Unistat is Furbish Lousewart V; in that universe, a terrorist organization known as Purity of Essence (named after General Ripper's obsession in the film ''[[Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb|Dr. Strangelove]]'') threatens to detonate nuclear devices in major cities all over Unistat. Also mirroring ''Dr. Strangelove'', Unistat has an automated device that will send nuclear missiles to [[Russia]] in the event of such an attack. Russia has a similar device to bomb [[China]], and so on.

In ''The Trick Top Hat'', President Hubbard, promotes a scientific approach to the improvement of life: she offers rewards to anyone who can design a robot to do their job or develop methods to prolong life. Eventually Unistat becomes a [[Utopia]]. She makes the whole law system into three different laws: victimless crimes, which have no punishment; crimes against property, which involve debt and payment; and serious crimes, such as murder, which result in being sent to Hell, a place like jail but not quite. It's encased in [[laser]] shielding and is like a primitive world all its own. It is, in fact, the State of [[Mississippi]]. The original [[Pocket Books]] edition of ''The Trick Top Hat'' contains many passages, some sexually explicit, that are not included in later editions, including the Dell softcover. Much of this material first appeared in Wilson's earlier novel, ''[[The Sex Magicians]]'', published as pornography by Sheffield House in 1973.

The third volume, ''The Homing Pigeons'', features [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy|President Kennedy]], although it has very little to do with the President. Near the end of the book it keeps switching universes, some of which contain President Kennedy, others which contain President Lousewort, and still others in which Hubbard is the president. Like ''The Trick Top Hat'', ''The Homing Pigeons'' also has material in the Pocket Books edition that is not in later editions. Unlike ''The Trick Top Hat'', however, the material that was cut out did not contain particularly sexually explicit content.

The main plots throughout these books are many. One follows Markoff Chaney, a midget, and his pranks played on the world that continuously screws him over. Most of his pranks are played on Dr. Dashwood, of Orgasm Research. However, the most important plot line follows the path of one Hugh Crane which may or may not be this Universe's Hagbard Celine; a character that is an obvious representation of Wilson himself.

Another follows an "Ithyphallic Eidolon", a penis removed from a [[transsexual]] woman named Epicene (post-surgery, Mary Margaret) Wildebloode. She puts it on display on her mantelpiece, where it gets stolen. It passes through the vicinity of almost every character in the series at least once.

There are dozens of [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] theories, [[strange loops]], [[satire]] and [[paranoia]] included within those pages. In addition, there are numerous references to other works and occasional outright appropriation of characters from them (including cameos by [[Ahab (Moby-Dick)|Captain Ahab]] and [[Lemuel Gulliver]], among others). Many of the character names are either puns ([[The Birth of a Nation|Bertha van Ation refers to the film ''Birth of a Nation'']], Juan Tootrego) or references to historical personages (Blake Williams refers to the poet [[William Blake]], Francis Dashwood's name refers to [[Sir Francis Dashwood]]).


==References To Other Works==


==Tanstagi==
{{See also|Public choice theory}}
"Tanstagi", an [[acronym]] standing for "There Ain't No Such Thing As Government Interference", is the motto of the Invisible Hand Society, an originally fictional organization invented in the ''Schrödinger's Cat Trilogy''. The acronym was deliberately intended as a reference to [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s [[TANSTAAFL]] principle.

The Tanstagi principle is meant to imply that the [[invisible hand]] of the [[free market]] applies to government as well. In other words, contrary to traditional ideas of [[laissez-faire capitalism]], government interference in the free market is impossible, since governments are inextricably a part of the market as a whole. 'Government' is not a separate institution—it is a word used to describe the actions of a large number of individuals subject to the same (at least qualitatively) pressures as everyone else. Both of these ideas are part of what is known as 'economic Taoism.'

While it was first introduced in a novel, people claiming to be members or know of chapters of the Invisible Hand Society have occasionally appeared in editorial pages and on the Internet.

==Language and invented slang==
The ''Schrödinger's Cat Trilogy'' is a fictional story, with much interpersonal dialogue between characters. This dialogue frequently makes use of slang words invented by the author, as a substitute for words that were, in the 1970s, typically taboo to speak about in modern western culture. In case a censorship case was brought against the book, Wilson made use of the names of Supreme Court Justices as "stand ins" for certain words. Examples include "[[Potter Stewart]]ing", an expression used as a substitute for a common word that refers to the act of copulation, and "Burgering", referring to the act of voiding one's bowels (referring to Chief Justice of the United States from 1969–1986, [[Warren E. Burger]]), etc.

The game was published by [[Electronic Arts]] and developed by the now-defunct [[Delphine Software International]]. It features former professional [[basketball]] player [[Shaquille O'Neal|Shaquille "Shaq" O'Neal]] as the [[player character]]. ''Shaq Fu'' was met with mixed responses from critics upon release, though it has since come to be considered one of the [[List of video games notable for negative reception|worst video games of all time]].

A sequel, ''Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn'', was announced in March 2014, and was released on June 5, 2018.&lt;ref name="sequel_release"&gt;{{cite web|title=Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn Gets Official Release Date|url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/104184/shaq-fu-a-legend-reborn-gets-official-release-date|website=ShackNews|accessdate=7 April 2018|date=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
In the game's storyline, Shaquille O'Neal walks into a [[dojo]] while heading to a charity basketball game in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. After speaking with Leotsu, a martial arts master, Shaq goes to another dimension, the Second World, where he must rescue a young boy named Nezu from the evil [[mummy]] [[Set (mythology)|Sett]] [[Ra]].

== Development ==
While initially pitched as a [[Basketball]] game, ''Shaq Fu'' became a fighting game after talks with Shaq, who is a self-proclaimed fan of ''[[Mortal Kombat]]''; Delphine acknowledged that they could not compete directly with ''[[Street Fighter II: The World Warrior|Street Fighter II]]'' from a technical perspective, instead building a game that highlighted the team's strengths at computer animations. The same [[rotoscoping]] techniques were used in their 1992 title ''[[Flashback (1992 video game)|Flashback: The Quest for Identity]]'', where actors would be filmed against a [[Chroma key|Blue Screen]], the frames would be digitized with the help of a Silicon Graphics SGI workstation, and artists would touch up the results using some of the roughly 7000 original character sketches as a base for defining characters. Shaq portrays himself in the game, though many sequences were directed by a Kung Fu expert; other characters were filmed by movie stuntmen and women, and O'Neal also assisted with some of the dialogue. Roughly 40 people worked on the project in total.

To promote the game's launch, Shaq released his second studio rap album, ''Shaq Fu: Da Return'', which peaked at #67 in the US' [[Billboard 200]] chart and #19 in Billboard's Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart; those who pre-ordered or purchased the console versions of the game in its initial launch also had gotten a Promotional CD featuring the track "Stand and Deliver".

==Variations==
[[File:Shaq Fu screenshot.png|thumb|left|Shaq fighting Auroch, one of the characters excluded from the SNES version]]
The Genesis version of ''Shaq Fu'' has five more playable characters (Auroch, Colonel, Diesel, Leotsu, and Nezu) and three more stages (The Lab, The Wasteland, and Yasko Mines) than the Super NES version, thus the Genesis version has a longer story mode. The North Gate/South Gate stage is accessible in the SNES version with a cheat code, whereas the Genesis version has the North Gate/South Gate stage available by default. The Amiga version contains the same content as the Genesis version (it keeps the text "Licensed by Sega Enterprises, LTD" left over from that version on the title screen), though the backgrounds have no animation. It also only has three tunes; there is no background music during the fights.

The Game Boy version has the same seven characters as the Super NES version, whereas the Game Gear version only has six characters (Shaq, Leotsu, Mephis, Rajah, Kaori, and Sett Ra). Both the Game Boy and Game Gear versions lack a tournament mode and in-game voices.

Both the Genesis and SNES versions of the game contained a hidden button sequence that would initiate a "blood code" in the spirit of [[Mortal Kombat]]. The blood effects were subdued and minor which kept the game at its "MA-13" (known by modern rating standard as "T") rating. However, the blood code gave access to finishing moves within the game that were triggered by striking the opponent in a certain way to end the match. The finishing moves were not gory as those depicted in the fatalities of ''Mortal Kombat'', but were considerably more violent when performed against monster-type characters in the game, rather than humans. Some of the finishing moves that have been discovered include the following examples:
* Sett Ra, when struck with a high attack toward his head, would drop to his knees as his head caught fire. The body of Sett Ra would then dissolve, the wraps falling to the ground and the smoldering shoulder armor tumbling forward.
* Beast, when struck in a certain way, would have his skin dissolve away revealing a skeleton which crumbles to the ground.
* Mephis, when struck with a mid-range attack, would shatter into ghost-like shards which fade away into the air, leaving his decrepit robe behind.
* Voodoo, when struck in a certain way, would fade into smoke, leaving her clothing behind on the ground.
* Genesis-exclusive character Auroch would turn to stone and explode if struck with a mid-range attack.

==Reception==
''Shaq Fu'' received mixed reviews at the time of its release. ''[[GamePro]]'' gave the SNES version a positive review, saying that the unusually small size of the sprites is balanced off by the incredibly fast game speed. They also praised the "ultra sharp" controls and impressive digitized graphics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Shaq Fu|work=[[GamePro]]|issue=64|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=November 1994|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; They reviewed the Genesis version as superior to the SNES version due to its additional characters and improved controls, and concluded that the game is "fun once you get used to the small, fast sprites."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Shaq Fu|work=[[GamePro]]|issue=65|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=December 1994|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the multiple reviewers at ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' scored it as a 6/10, and another gave it a 4/10.&lt;ref name="Defunct Games"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.defunctgames.com/reviewcrew/5/shaq-fu-what-did-critics-think-at-the-time | title=Shaq Fu: What Did Critics Think at the Time? | publisher=Defunct Games | date=17 August 2013 | accessdate=17 February 2014 | author=Lachel, Cyril}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received a grade of D from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.&lt;ref name="Entertainment Weekly"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,304886,00.html | title=Shaq-Fu | publisher=Weekly Inc. | date=16 December 1994 | accessdate=17 February 2014 | author=Strauss, Bob}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[GamesMaster (magazine)|GamesMaster]]'' gave the Genesis and SNES versions 81% and 83% respectively.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/GamesMasterIssue023199411FuturePublishingGB300dpi/Games_Master_Issue_023_%281994-11%29%28Future_Publishing%29%28GB%29%28300dpi%29#page/n49/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mean Machines Sega Magazine'' gave the Genesis version 79%.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/mean-machines-sega-magazine-24/MMSega_24_Oct_1994#page/n77/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to their reactions to the SNES and Genesis versions, ''GamePro'' panned the Game Boy release, saying it dumbs down the gameplay, loses so much graphical detail that the characters are unrecognizable, and makes the music far too pervasive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Shaq Fu|magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=88 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] |date=January 1996|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' reviewed the Genesis version of the game, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that "''Shaq Fu'' includes everything a good fighting game needs, with the exception of good fighting."&lt;ref name="NG"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|title=Finals|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=1|publisher=[[Future US|Imagine Media]]|date=January 1995|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrospective criticism of the game has been generally negative. [[GameTrailers]] rated it number 4 Worst in their "Top Ten Best and Worst Video Games".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gametrailers.com/video/top-ten-gt-countdown/15147 Top Ten Best and Worst Games of All Time], GameTrailers.com.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the negative feedback to the game, Levi Buchanan from [[IGN]] stated it was undeserved as a result of collective exaggerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/921/921714p1.html|publisher=IGN|accessdate=October 8, 2011|author=Buchanan, Levi|title=In Defense of Shaq Fu|date=October 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the September 1997, ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' had 12 staff members vote in a list for the top 100 games of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Nintendo Power]]|title=100 Best Games of All Time|page=88|date=September 1997|volume=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; This list also included a 10 worst games of all-time list voted by the staff, which placed ''Shaq Fu'' at 3rd worst place on their list.&lt;ref name="np-reception"&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Nintendo Power]]|title=100 Best Games of All Time|page=97|date=September 1997|volume=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article stated that it was "not possible to come up with a worse idea than this."&lt;ref name="np-reception" /&gt;

== Cancelled sequel ==
In 1995, there were plans for Delphine Software to develop a sequel for the series, respectively titled ''Shaq Fu 2'', initially intended to be released for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive and Super Nintendo/Super Famicom sometime during Quarter IV of 1995 or Early 1996; the project was ultimately cancelled due to the mixed reception of the first entry, though in the years to follow, original concept art for five new characters (along with seven returning characters, those being Shaq, Rajah, Voodoo, Leotsu, Mephis, Kaori, and Sett Ra) and early stage designs that would've been a part of the game have surfaced online through the portfolio of one of the developers.

==Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn==
In March 2014, an [[Indiegogo]] [[Crowdfunding in video games|crowdfunding]] campaign was started for a sequel titled ''Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn''. The funding goal was $450,000 [[United States dollar|USD]]. If achieved, the game creators at Big Deez Productions promised that the game would be released for consoles (PC, [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], [[Wii U]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Xbox 360]]). The campaign ended on May 5, 2014, with the funding goal exceeded at $473,884.&lt;ref name="Indiegogo"&gt;[http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/shaq-fu-a-legend-reborn Indiegogo - Shaq-Fu: A Legend Reborn]&lt;/ref&gt; Big Deez announced they will be accepting Quark [[crypto-currency]] as a method of in-game payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tran|first1=Calvin|title=QuarkCoin Partners with ShaqFu 2 Team|url=http://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/news/quarkcoin-partners-moolah-shaq-fu-2-team/2014/04/12|website=CryptoCoins News|publisher=[[CryptoCoinsNews]]|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After ''A Legend Reborn'' was successfully funded, there was little significant word on its developmental status and release timetable over the next few years. In late 2016, the sequel's developers reported on Indiegogo that its development was nearly finished, but declined to provide a concrete release date.&lt;ref name="delay"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parsons|first1=Don|title=Shaq-Fu A Legend Reborn Delays Due To Licensing Issues|url=https://techraptor.net/content/shaq-fu-a-legend-reborn-delays-due-to-licensing-issues|website=TechRaptor|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over a month after [[Nintendo]] launched the [[Nintendo Switch]], a special trailer confirmed that ''A Legend Reborn'' will be available on that system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Downey|first1=Kyle|title=Shaq Fu Coming to Nintendo Switch|url=https://techraptor.net/content/shaq-fu-coming-nintendo-switch|website=TechRaptor|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Saber Interactive]] also announced that it would offer free copies of the game to early adopters of ''[[NBA Playgrounds]]'' on the console as compensation for the initial lack of online features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2017/06/nba_playgrounds_switch_early_adopters_to_get_free_copy_of_shaq_fu_a_legend_reborn |title=NBA Playgrounds Switch Early Adopters to Get Free Copy of Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn |first=Thomas |last=Whitehead |date=June 2, 2017 |publisher=[[Nintendo Life]] |accessdate=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In early 2018, it also confirmed that the game was delayed due to unexpected licensing issues that required some significant rework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McWhertor|first1=Michael|title=Shaq Fu sequel finally coming out this spring|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/2/15/17016144/shaq-fu-a-legend-reborn-release-date-switch-ps4-xbox-one-pc|website=Polygon|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was expected to come out in the second quarter of 2018, and the Wii U, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions were cancelled.&lt;ref name="delay"/&gt; The sequel was released on June 5, 2018.&lt;ref name="sequel_release"/&gt;  

''A Legend Reborn'' features gameplay that heavily differs from its predecessor, more akin to a [[beat 'em up]]; despite the fact that it was commonly advertised and publicly claimed by developers, fans, news outlets, and even Shaq himself, to be a sequel, it is purely a reboot in its truest sense, taking place in a completely different continuity than the first entry (coined by some fans as the Reborn Universe, with both its predecessor and the cancelled ''Shaq Fu 2'' being in the Delphine Universe), and both the character dialogue and area aesthetics in the levels make plentiful references and inside jokes that call back to the first entry (such as Kaori's name showing up on a Traffic Ad Banner), as well as Shaq's career, Shaq Fu Radio, and even the development phase of ''A Legend Reborn'' itself, among plentiful others. It was met with mixed reception: While some critics noted its repetitive combat, unreliable controls and [[collision detection]], as well as a lack of replay value for those who completed the main campaign,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lugo |first1=Jakejames |title=Shaq-Fu: A Legend Reborn Review – Shaq-Diesel Fights Back |url=https://thekoalition.com/reviews/shaq-fu-a-legend-reborn-review-shaq-diesel-fights-back |website=Koalition |accessdate=7 June 2018 |date=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; others praised its tongue-in-cheek humor and frantic action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/shaq-fu_a_legend_reborn|title=Review: Shaq-Fu: A Legend Reborn (Switch)|last=Life|first=Nintendo|date=2018-06-07|work=Nintendo Life|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 29, 2018, a DLC add-on titled ''Barack Fu: The Adventures of Dirty Barry'' was revealed in two Launch Trailers that were shared by multiple gaming groups and news sites alike; it was also made available for free to those who had purchased a physical copy of ''A Legend Reborn''. ''Barack Fu'' continues the story of ''A Legend Reborn'', following the ending of Shaq's campaign, with the player now taking control of a fictionalized version of former [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Barack Obama]] through two new stages (increasing the full level count of the game from six to eight) as he goes through [[France]] and [[Outer space|Outer Space]] to defeat a fictional take on rapper/singer/songwriter [[Kanye West]]. Gameplay differences for Barack in this entry, when compared to Shaq, involve him having an ability set that delivers a far wider attack range (when using a Special) and his durability in battles is noticeably stronger, which makes for an easier survival rate when playing as him; at the time of ''Barack Fu''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s initial release, players cannot choose to play through Shaq and Barack's individual campaigns as the other respective character, though the PC version of the game can have this be done through [[Mod (video gaming)|modding]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="71060">The '''spiral of silence theory''' is a [[political science]] and [[mass communication]] theory proposed by the [[Germany|German]] [[political scientist]] [[Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann]], which stipulates that individuals have a fear of [[solitude|isolation]], which results from the idea that a social group or the society in general might isolate, neglect, or exclude members due to the members' opinions. This fear of isolation consequently leads to remaining silent instead of voicing opinions. Media is an important factor that relates to both the dominant idea and people's perception of the dominant idea. The assessment of one's social environment may not always correlate with reality.{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}}

==Background==
According to Shelly Neill, "Introduced in 1974, the Spiral of Silence Theory [...] explores hypotheses to determine why some groups remain silent while others are more vocal in forums of public disclosure."{{Sfn|Neill|2009|p=42}} The spiral of silence theory suggests that "people who have believed that they hold a minority viewpoint on a public issue will remain in the background where their communication will be restrained; those who believe that they hold a majority viewpoint will be more encouraged to speak."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Applicatinon|last=West|first=Richard|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2010|isbn=978-0-07-338507-5|location=New York|pages=411|last2=Turner|first2=Lynn H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory explains the formation of social norms at both the micro and macro level. "As a micro-theory, the spiral of silence examines opinion expression, controlling for people's predispositions – such as fear of isolation, and also demographic variables that have been shown to influence people's willingness to publicly express opinions on issues, such as agricultural biotechnology."{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}} The spiral of silence occurs on a macro level if more and more members of the perceived minority fall silent. This is when public perceptions of the opinion climate begin to shift.{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}} "In other words, a person's individual reluctance to express his or her opinion, simply based on perceptions of what everyone else thinks, has important implications at the social level."{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}} As one opinion gains the interest of the majority, the minority faces threat and fear of isolation from society. As the opinion gains momentum by the majority, the minority continues to be threatened and falls deeper into their silence. It continues until the minority no longer speaks out against it, and the opinion of the perceived majority ultimately becomes a social norm.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}

===Spiral model===
The spiral model is an analogy used to visually describe the theory. The end of the [[spiral]] refers to the number of people who are not publicly expressing their opinions, due to the fear of isolation. An individual is more likely to go down the spiral if his or her opinion does not conform with the perceived majority opinion.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}} The following steps summarize how the process works:
#We can distinguish between fields where the opinions and attitudes involved are static, and fields where those opinions and attitudes are subject to changes... Where opinions are relatively definite and static – for example, "customs" – one has to express or act according to this opinion in public or run the risk of becoming isolated. In contrast, where opinions are in flux, or disputed, the individual will try to find out which opinion he can express without becoming isolated.
#Individuals who, when observing their environments, notice that their own personal opinion is spreading and is taken over by others, will voice this opinion self-confidently in public. On the other hand, individuals who notice that their own opinions are losing ground will be inclined to adopt a more reserved attitude when expressing their opinions in public.
#It follows from this that, as the representatives of the first opinion talk quite a lot while the representatives of the second opinion remain silent, there is a definite influence on the environment: an opinion that is being reinforced in this way appears stronger than it really is, while an opinion suppressed as described will seem to be weaker than it is in reality.
#The result is a spiral process which prompts other individuals to perceive the changes in opinion and follow suit, until one opinion has become established as the prevailing attitude while the other opinion will be pushed back and rejected by everybody with the exception of the hard core that nevertheless sticks to that opinion.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1977}}

This is a process of formation, change and reinforcement of public opinion. The tendency of the one to speak up and the other to be silent starts off a spiraling process which increasingly establishes one opinion as the dominant one. Over time, these changing perceptions establish one opinion as predominant one and they change from the liquid state to a solid norm.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1977}}

Further, Noelle-Neumann describes the spiral of silence as a [[Positive feedback|dynamic process]], in which predictions about public opinion become fact as mass media's coverage of the [[Majoritarianism|majority opinion]] becomes the [[status quo]], and the minority becomes less likely to speak out.{{Sfn|Miller|2005|p=278}}

==Epistemology==
===Public===
Scholars have long argued over the concept of ''public'' within "public opinion". The use of "[[public]]" and "the public" betrays multiple competing meanings.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}} There are three meanings of public. One meaning is the legal sense of public that focuses on openness. For example, a public place or path. A second meaning for the term emphasizes public rights. Lastly, within the phrase public opinion, public is said to have a related but different definition. Public, in this sense, could be characterized as social psychology. Scholars have marveled in amazement at the power public opinion has in making regulations, norms, and moral rules triumph over the individual self without ever troubling legislators, governments or courts for assistance.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}

===Opinion===
"Common [[Opinion]]" is what the Scottish social philosopher [[David Hume]] called it in his 1739 published work ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]''. Agreement and a sense of the common is what lay behind the English and French "opinion."{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}} In researching the term opinion, ''meinung'' in German, researchers were led back to [[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''. In Plato's ''Republic'', a quote from [[Socrates]] conclude that opinion takes the middle position. [[Immanuel Kant]] considered opinion to be an "insufficient judgement, subjectively as well as objectively."{{Sfn|Kant|1781|p=498}} How valuable opinion may be was left out; however, the fact that it is suggested to be unified agreement of a population, or segment of the population, was still considered.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}

===Public opinion===
The term [[public opinion]] first emerged in France during the eighteenth century. The definition of public opinion has been debated over time. There has not been much progress in locking in one classification of the phrase ''[[public opinion]].'' [[Hermann Oncken]], a German historian, stated &lt;blockquote&gt;Whoever desires to grasp and define the concept of public opinion will recognize quickly that he is dealing with a [[Proteus]], a being that appears simultaneously in a thousand guises, both visible and as a phantom, impotent and surprisingly efficacious, which presents itself in innumerable transformations and is forever slipping through our fingers just as we believe we have a firm grip on it... That which floats and flows cannot be understood by being locked up in a formula... After all, when asked, everyone knows exactly what public opinion means.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; It was said to be a "fiction that belonged in a museum of the history of ideas; it could only be of historical interest."{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}

In contradiction to that quote, the term public opinion seemed to not cease. During the early 1970s, Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann was creating the theory of the spiral of silence. She was making an effort to clarify the 1965 finding of which voting intentions would not change but yet expectations that one side would win continued to increase. Noelle-Nuemann began to question if she was indeed grabbing a handle on what public opinion actually was. "The spiral of silence might be one of the forms in which public opinion appeared; it might be a process through which a new, youthful public opinion develops or whereby the transformed meaning of an old opinion spreads."{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}

The American sociologist [[Edward Alsworth Ross|Edward Ross]] described [[public opinion]] in 1898 using the word "cheap". "The equation of 'public opinion' with 'ruling opinion' runs like a common thread through its many definitions. This speaks to the fact that something clinging to public opinion sets up conditions that move individuals to act, even against their own will."&lt;ref name="NoelleBook" /&gt;

Many possible meanings and definitions of the term have been explored. Scholars have considered the content of public opinion, assumed to consist of public affairs issues. Scholars point out that the emergence of the public opinion depends on an open public discourse rather than "on the discipline imposed by an apparent majority dominant enough to intimidate but whose views may or may not support actions that are in the common interest."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=What is this Thing we Call Public Opinion? Reflections on the Spiral of Silence|url=http://ijpor.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/3/368|journal=[[International Journal of Public Opinion Research]]|date=1 September 2012|issn=0954-2892|pages=368–386|volume=24|issue=3|doi=10.1093/ijpor/eds014|language=en|first=Kurt|last=Lang|first2=Gladys Engel|last2=Lang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have also considered whose opinion establishes public opinion, assumed to be persons of a community who are ready to express themselves responsibly about questions of public relevance. Scholars have also looked into the forms of public opinion, said to be those that are openly expressed and accessible; opinions that are made public, especially in the mass media. Controversy surrounding this term spiraled around both words combining to form the phrase.{{Sfn|Noelle-Neumann|1984}}

===Media and public opinion===
Mass media's effects on both public opinion and the perception of the public opinion are central to the Spiral of Silence Theory. One of the earliest works that called attention to the relationship between media and the formation of public opinion was [[Walter Lippmann]]'s book "Public Opinion," published in 1923.&lt;ref name="Lippmann"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lippmann|first1=W|title=Public opinion|date=1946|publisher=Transaction Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideas of Lippmann regarding the effects of media influenced the emergence of the Spiral of Silence Theory. As she is building the spiral theory, Noelle-Neumann states "the reader can only complete and explain the world by making use of a consciousness which in large measure has been created by the mass media."&lt;ref name="NoelleBook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Noelle-Neumann|first1=Elisabeth|title=The spiral of silence: Public opinion, our social skin|date=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Agenda-setting theory]] is another work that Noelle-Neumann builds on as she is characterizing media's effect on the public opinion. Agenda-setting theory describes the relationship between media and public opinion by asserting that the public importance of an issue depends on its salience in the media.&lt;ref name="AgendaSetting"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Shaw|first2=D. L|date=1972|title=The agenda-setting function of mass media|journal=[[Public Opinion Quarterly]]|volume=36|issue=2|pages=176–187|doi=10.1086/267990|last1=McCombs|first1=M. E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with setting the agenda, the media further determines the salient issues through a constant battle with other events attempting to gain place in the agenda.&lt;ref name="NoelleBook" /&gt; The media battles with these news alternatives by creating "pseudo-crises" and "pseudo-novelties."&lt;ref name="NoelleBook" /&gt;

Media's characteristics as a communication tool further affect people's perception of their own ideas in regard to the public opinion.&lt;ref name="NoelleBook" /&gt; According to Noelle-Neumann, the media is a "one-sided, indirect, public form of communication, contrasting threefold with the most natural form of human communication, the [[conversation]]."&lt;ref name="NoelleBook" /&gt; These characteristics of the media in particular further overwhelm one's individual ideas.

While some media communication theories assume a passive audience, such as the [[Hypodermic needle model|Hypodermic Needle model]],&lt;ref name="CommChar" /&gt; the spiral model assumes an active audience "who consumes media products in the context of their personal and social goals."&lt;ref name="CommChar"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ball-Rokeach|first1=S|last2=Cantor|first2=M. G|title=Media, audience, and social structure|date=1986|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge "gained from the mass media may offer ammunition for people to express their opinions and offer a rationale for their own stance."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The spiral of silence: examining how cultural predispositions, news attention, and opinion congruency relate to opinion expression|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01292986.2012.725178|journal=Asian Journal of Communication|date=2013-04-01|issn=0129-2986|pages=113–134|volume=23|issue=2|doi=10.1080/01292986.2012.725178|first=Shirley S.|last=Ho|first2=Vivian Hsueh-Hua|last2=Chen|first3=Clarice C.|last3=Sim}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ho et al. point out that "among individuals who paid high amount of media attention, those who have a low fear of isolation were significantly more likely to offer a rationale for their own opinion than were those who have a high fear of isolation."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Noelle-Neuman regards media central to the formulation of the Spiral of Silence Theory, whereas some scholars argue whether the dominant idea in one's social environment overwhelms the dominant idea that media proposes as the perceived social norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Glynn|first1=C. J|last2=McLeod|first2=J.M|title=Implications of the spiral of silence theory for communication and public opinion research|journal=Political communication yearbook|date=1984|pages=43–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennamer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kennamer|first1=J.D|title=Self-serving biases in perceiving the opinions of others: Implications for the spiral of silence|journal=Communication Research|date=1990|doi=10.1177/009365090017003006|volume=17|issue=3|pages=393–404}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some empirical research align with this perspective; suggesting that the "micro-climate" of an individual overwhelms the effects of the media.&lt;ref name="Kennamer" /&gt; Other articles further suggest that talking with others is the primary way of understanding the opinion climate.&lt;ref name="Talking"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tichenor|first1=P.

==Assumptions==
===Fear of isolation===
The fear of isolation is the centrifugal force that accelerates the spiral of silence.{{Sfn|Griffen|2009}} Essentially, people fear becoming social isolates and thus take measures to avoid such a consequence, as demonstrated by psychologist [[Solomon Asch]] in the [[Asch conformity experiments]].{{Sfn|Cherry|2012}} People feel more comfortable by agreeing with opinions that they know are wrong instead of telling others their ideas.{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}}

===Assessing the climate===
This assumption proposes that in order to avoid becoming isolated and in order not to lose popularity and esteem, people constantly observe their environment very closely. They try to find out which opinions and modes of behaviour are prevalent, and which opinions and modes of behaviour are becoming more popular. They behave and express themselves accordingly in public. Then, they try to determine whether they are in the majority: whether the public opinion tends to agree with them. If they feel they are in the minority, they tend to remain silent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weiman|first1=Gabriel|title=Communicating Unreality|date=2000|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.|location=United States of America|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Quasi-statistical sense====
Individuals use what is described as "an innate ability" or quasi-statistical sense to gauge [[public opinion]].&lt;ref name= "Miller 2005:278"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2005|p=278}}.&lt;/ref&gt; People assume they can sense and figure out what others are thinking.{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}}
{{Quote|The [[Mass media]] play a large part in determining what the dominant opinion is, since our direct observation is limited to a small percentage of the population. The mass media have an enormous impact on how public opinion is portrayed, and can dramatically impact an individual's perception about where public opinion lies, whether or not that portrayal is factual.{{Sfn|Scheufele|Moy|2000}} }}

====Pluralistic ignorance====
[[Pluralistic ignorance]] may occur in some cases, leading to the minority opinion to be accepted as a norm. Group members may be privately rejecting a norm, but may falsely assume that other group members accept it. This phenomenon may cause a group to hold on to a norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shelton|first1=J. Nicole|title=Intergroup Contact and Pluralistic Ignorance|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=2005|volume=88|issue=1|pages=91–107|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.88.1.91|pmid=15631577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evaluation of public opinion matters===
Our evaluation of a public opinion has an effect on our decision to speak up. Where opinions are relatively definite and static – customs, for example – one has to express or act according to this opinion in public or run the risk of becoming isolated. In contrast, where opinions are in flux, or disputed, the individual will try to find out which opinion he can express without becoming isolated. Individuals tend to publicly express their opinions and attitudes when they perceive their view to be dominant or on the rise. Conversely, when individuals perceive that their opinion is less popular or losing popularity, they are less likely to voice it in public. What one individual decides to do affects all of society around them.{{Sfn|Scheufele|2007}}

==Vocal minority and hardcore==
The theory explains a ''vocal minority'' (the complement of the ''[[silent majority]]'') by stating that people who are highly educated, or who have greater affluence, and the few other cavalier individuals who do not fear isolation, are likely to speak out regardless of public opinion.{{Sfn|Miller|2005|p=279}} It further states that this minority is a necessary factor of change while the compliant majority is a necessary factor of stability, with both being a product of evolution. There is a vocal minority, which remains at the top of the spiral in defiance of threats of isolation.

This theory calls these vocal minorities the hardcore nonconformist or the avant-garde. Hardcore nonconformists are "people who have already been rejected for their beliefs and have nothing to lose by speaking out."{{Sfn|Griffen|2009}} The hardcore has the ability to reconfigure majority opinion. While the [[avant-garde]] are "the intellectuals, artists, and reformers in the isolated minority who speak out because they are convinced they are ahead of the times."{{Sfn|Griffen|2009}}

==Application of the theory==
The spiral of silence has brought insight regarding diverse topics, ranging from speaking about popular culture phenomena,&lt;ref name=PopCulture&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wedel|first1=T|title=The spiral of silence in popular culture: applying a public opinion theory to radio station popularity|journal=California State University|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; to smoking.{{Sfn|Shanahan|Scheufele|Yang|Hizi|2004}} Considering that the spiral of silence is more likely to occur in controversial issues and issues with a moral component,&lt;ref name=NoelleBook /&gt; many scholars have applied the theory to controversial topics, such as [[abortion]],&lt;ref name=SpiralOnAbortion&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salmon|first1=C.T|last2=Neuwirth|first2=k|title=Perceptions of opinion "climates" and willingness to discuss the issue of abortion|journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|date=1990|volume=67|issue=3|pages=567–577|doi=10.1177/107769909006700312}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[affirmative action]],&lt;ref name=SpiralOnAffirmative&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moy|first1=P|last2=Domke|first2=D|last3=Stamm|first3=K|title=The spiral of silence and public opinion on affirmative action|journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|date=2001|volume=78|issue=1|pages=7–25|doi=10.1177/107769900107800102}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[capital punishment]].&lt;ref name=SpiralOnCapital&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hayes|first1=A.F|title=Exploring the Forms of Self-Censorship: On the Spiral of Silence and the Use of Opinion Expression Avoidance Strategies|journal=Journal of Communication|date=2007|volume=57|issue=4|pages=785–802|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2007.00368.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross cultural studies===
Existing literature prior to the spiral of silence theory suggest a relationship between social [[conformity]] and [[culture]], motivating communication scholars to conduct cross-cultural analysis of the theory. Scholars in the field of [[psychology]] in particular previously addressed the cultural variance involved in the conformity to the majority opinion.&lt;ref name=Milgram&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milgram|first1=S|title=Nationality and conformity|journal=Scientific American|date=1961|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1261-45|volume=205|issue=6|pages=45–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies confirm the link between conformity and culture: a [[meta-analysis]] regarding [[Asch conformity experiments]], for example, suggest that [[Collectivism|collectivist]] cultures are more likely to exhibit conformity than the individualistic cultures.&lt;ref name=MetaAsch&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bond|first1=Rod|last2=Smith|first2=Peter B.|title=Culture and conformity: A meta-analysis of studies using Asch's (1952b, 1956) line judgment task.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1996|volume=119|issue=1|pages=111–137|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.119.1.111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The United States and Taiwan====
''A Cross Cultural Test of the Spiral of Silence'' by Huiping Huang analyzes the results of a telephone survey done in Taiwan and the United States. The hypotheses tested were the beliefs that the United States is [[individualistic culture|an "individualistic" society]], while Taiwan is a "[[collectivist]]" society. This suggested that the spiral of silence is less likely to be activated in the United States, because individuals are more likely to put emphasis on their personal goals. They put the "I" identity over the "we" identity, and strive for personal success. Therefore, it was hypothesized that they would be more likely to speak out, regardless of if they are in the minority. On the other hand, it was predicted that individuals in Taiwan put more emphasis on the collective goal, so they would conform to the majority influence in hopes of avoiding tension and conflict. The study also tested the effect of motives, including [[self-efficacy]] and [[self-assurance]].

Telephone surveys were conducted; the citizens of the United States were questioned in regards to American involvement in [[Somalia]], and the citizens of Taiwan about the possibility of a direct presidential election. Both issues focused on politics and human rights, and were therefore comparable. Respondents were asked to choose "favor," "neutral" or "oppose" in regards to the categories of themselves, family and friends, the media, society, and society in the future about the given issue. Measurements were also taken regarding the [[individualism]] and collectivism constructs, and the "motives of not expressing opinion" based on a 1–10 and 1–5 scale respectively, in approval of given statements.

Results showed support for the original hypothesis. Overall, Americans were more likely to speak out than Taiwanese. Being incongruous with the majority lessened the motivation of the Taiwanese to speak out (and they had a higher collectivist score), but had little effect on the Americans. In Taiwan, future support and belief of society played a large role in likeliness to voice an opinion, and support that the activation of the spiral of silence is in effect. In the United States, it was hypothesized that because they were more individualistic, they would be more likely to speak out if in the minority, or incongruous group. However, this was not true, but Huang suggests that perhaps the issue chosen was not directly prevalent, and therefore, they found it "unnecessary to voice their objections to the majority opinion." Lack of self-efficacy led to lack of speaking out in both countries.{{Sfn|Huang|2005}}

====Basque nationalism====
''Basque Nationalism and the Spiral of Silence'' is an article by Spencer and Croucher that analyzes the public perception of [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] (Euskadi Ta Askatasuna, a militant separatist group) in Spain and France. This study was conducted in a similar way as above, with Basque individuals from Spain and France being questioned about their support of ETA. They were asked questions such as "How likely would you be to enter into a conversation with a stranger on a train about ETA?" Taken into consideration were the cultural differences of the two different regions in which ETA existed.

The results supported the theory of the spiral of silence. While there was a highly unfavorable opinion of the group, there was a lack of an outcry to stop it. Individuals claimed that they were more likely to voice their opinions to non-Basques, suggesting that they have a "fear of isolation" in regards to fellow [[Basques]]. Furthermore, the Spanish individuals questioned were more likely to be silent because of their greater proximity to the violent acts.{{Sfn|Spencer|Stephen|2008}}

===Perceptions in the classroom===
One study, by Henson and Denker "investigates perceptions of silencing behaviors, [[political affiliation]], and political differences as correlates to perceptions of university [[classroom climate]]s and [[communication behavior]]s."{{Sfn|Henson|Denker|2007}} They looked at whether students' view of the classroom changes whether they perceive the instructor and other classmates with a different political affiliation, with the instructor and other classmates communicating using silencing behaviors. The article stated that little has been investigated into student-teacher interactions in the classroom, and how the students are influenced.{{Sfn|Henson|Denker|2007}} The goal of the article was to "determine how political ideas are expressed in the university classrooms, and thus, assess the influence of classroom communication on the perceptions of political tolerance."{{Sfn|Henson|Denker|2007}}

The article claimed that university classrooms are an adequate place to scrutinize the spiral of silence theory because it is a place that has [[interpersonal communication|interpersonal]], [[cultural communication|cultural]], [[media (communication)|media]], and [[political communication]]. Henson and Denker said, "Because classroom interactions and societal discourse are mutually influential, instructors and students bring their own biases and cultural perspectives into the classroom."{{Sfn|Henson|Denker|2007}}

The study researched whether there was a correlation between students' perception that they were being politically silenced and their perceived differences in student-instructor political affiliation. The study also questioned whether there was any connection between the perceived climate and the similarity of the student and instructor on their political affiliations.{{Sfn|Henson|Denker|2007}} The researchers used participants from a Midwestern university's communication courses. The students answered a survey over their perceptions of political silencing, classroom climate, and the climate created by the instructor. The results of this research found that there is a positive relationship of the perceived similarities in political party and [[political ideology|ideological]] differences of the student and instructor to perceived greater political silencing.{{Sfn|Henson|Denker|2007}}

===In computer-mediated communication===
While the studies regarding the spiral of silence theory focused on [[face-to-face interaction]] before 2000, the theory was later applied to a [[computer-mediated communication]] environment. The first study in this context analyzed communication behaviors in online chat rooms regarding the issue of abortion, and revealed that minority opinion holders were more likely to speak out, whereas their comments remained neutral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McDevitt|first1=M.|title=Spiral of Moderation: Opinion Expression in Computer-Mediated Discussion|journal=[[International Journal of Public Opinion Research]]|date=1 December 2003|volume=15|issue=4|pages=454–470|doi=10.1093/ijpor/15.4.454}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study focused on the Korean bulletin board postings regarding the national election, and found a relationship between online postings and the presentation of candidates in the mainstream media.&lt;ref name=OnlineKorea&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jung Choi|first1=Yun|last2=Lee|first2=Cheolhan|last3=Hyuk Lee|first3=Jong|title=Influence of poll results on the advocates' political discourse: An application of functional analysis debates to online messages in the 2002 Korean presidential election|journal=Asian Journal of Communication|date=March 2004|volume=14|issue=1|pages=95–110|doi=10.1080/0129298042000195189}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third study focuses on the online review system, suggesting that the fear of isolation tend to reduce the willingness of members to voice neutral and negative reviews.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Silence in the crowd: The spiral of silence contributing to the positive bias of opinions in an online review system|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/17/11/1811|journal=[[New Media &amp; Society]]|date=1 December 2015|issn=1461-4448|pages=1811–1829|volume=17|issue=11|doi=10.1177/1461444814535190|language=en|first=David A.|last=Askay}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spiral of Silence Theory is extended "into the context of non-anonymous multichannel communication platforms" and "the need to consider the role of communicative affordances in online opinion expression" is also addressed.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===In social media contexts===
Current literature suggests that the spiral model can be applied to the [[social media]] context. Gearhart and Zhang conduct a study to examine whether or not the use of social media will increase people's motivation to express their opinions about political issues. The results suggest that social media users "who have received a strong negative reaction to their politically related posts are likely to censor themselves, exemplifying the spiral of silence effect".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title="Was It Something I Said?" "No, It Was Something You Posted!" A Study of the Spiral of Silence Theory in Social Media Contexts|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/cyber.2014.0443|journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking|date=2015-04-16|pages=208–213|volume=18|issue=4|doi=10.1089/cyber.2014.0443|language=en|first=Sherice|last=Gearhart|first2=Weiwu|last2=Zhang}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another research confirms the positive relationship between speaking out and issue importance on the social media context as well: individuals who view [[Gay bashing|gay bullying]] as a significant social issue are more likely to comment on Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gearhart|first1=S.|last2=Zhang|first2=W.|title=Gay Bullying and Online Opinion Expression: Testing Spiral of Silence in the Social Media Environment|journal=Social Science Computer Review|date=23 September 2013|volume=32|issue=1|pages=18–36|doi=10.1177/0894439313504261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social capital===
The spiral of silence theory can be also applied to [[social capital]] context. Recent studies see social capital as "a variable that enables citizens to develop norms of trust and reciprocity, which are necessary for successful engagement in collective activities".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=|title=Social Capital and the Spiral of Silence|last=Dalisay|first=Francis|date=2012|journal=[[International Journal of Public Opinion Research]]|doi=10.1093/ijpor/eds023|pmid=|accessdate=|last2=Hmielowski|first2=Jay D.|last3=Kushin|first3=Matthew James|last4=Yamamoto|first4=Masahiro|volume=24|issue=3|pages=325–345}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study examines three individual-level indicators of social capital--[[civic engagement]], trust and neighborliness, and the relationship between these indicators and people's willingness to express their opinions and their perception of support for one's opinions. The results suggest that civic engagement has a direct effect on people's willingness to express their opinions and neighborliness and trust had direct positive effects on people's perception of support for one's opinions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also, the study shows that "only a direct (but not indirect) effect of civic engagement on opinion expression further highlights a potential difference between bonding and bridging social capital".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Internet==
===Isolating the factors that remove isolation===
The concept of isolation has a variety of definitions, dependent upon the circumstances it is investigated in. In one instance the problem of isolation has been defined as [[social withdrawal]], defined as low relative frequencies of peer interaction.{{Sfn|O'Connor|1969}}{{Sfn|O'Connor|1972}} Other researchers have defined isolation as low levels of peer acceptance or high levels of [[peer rejection]].{{Sfn|Gottman|Gonso|Rasmussen|1975}} Research that considers isolation with regard to the Internet either focuses on how the Internet makes individuals more isolated from society by cutting off their contact from live human beings{{Sfn|Kraut|Patterson|Lundmark|Kiesler|1998}}{{Sfn|Moody|2001}}{{Sfn|Sleek|1998}} or how the Internet decreases [[social isolation]] of people by allowing them to expand their [[social network]]s and giving them more means to stay in touch with friends and family.{{Sfn|Morris|Ogan|2002}}{{Sfn|Bradley|Poppen|2003}} Since the development of the Internet, and in particular the [[World Wide Web]], a wide variety of groups have come into existence, including Web and [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC), [[newsgroup]]s, multiuser dimensions (MUDs), and, more recently, commercial [[virtual communities]].{{Sfn|Sassenberg|2002}} The theories and hypotheses about how [[Internet]]-based groups impact individuals are numerous and wide-ranging. Some researchers view these fast growing virtual chat cliques, [[online game]]s, or computer-based marketplaces as a new opportunity, particularly for stigmatized people, to take a more active part in social life.{{Sfn|Rheingold|1993}}{{Sfn|Cummings|Sproull|Kiesler|2002}}{{Sfn|McKenna|Bargh|1998}}

Traditionally, social isolation has been represented as a one-dimensional construct organized around the notion of a person's position outside the [[peer group]] and refers to isolation from the group as a result of being excluded from the group by peers.{{Sfn|Bowker|Bukowski|Zargarpour|Hoza|1998}} From children to adults, literature shows that people understand the concept of isolation and fear the repercussions of being isolated from groups of which they are a member. Fearing isolation, people did not feel free to speak up if they feel they hold dissenting views, which means people restrict themselves to having conversation with like-minded individuals, or have no conversation whatsoever.{{Sfn|Witschge|2002}} Witschge further explained, "Whether it is fear of harming others, or fear to get harmed oneself, there are factors that inhibit people from speaking freely, and which thus results in a non-ideal type of discussion, as it hinders diversity and equality of participants and viewpoints to arise fully."{{Sfn|Witschge|2002|p=8}}

The medium of the Internet has the power to free people from the fear of social isolation, and in doing so, shuts down the spiral of silence. The Internet allows people to find a place where they can find groups of people with like mindsets and similar points of view. Van Alstyne and Brynjolfsson stated that "Internet users can seek out interactions with like-minded individuals who have similar values, and thus become less likely to trust important decisions to people whose values differ from their own."{{Sfn|van Alstyne|Brynjolfsson|1996|p=24}} The features of the Internet could not only bring about more people to deliberate by freeing people of psychological barriers, but also bring new possibilities in that it "makes manageable large-scale, [[many-to-many]] discussion and deliberation."{{Sfn|Coleman|Gøtze|2001|p=17}} Unlike [[traditional media]] that limit participation, the Internet brings the characteristics of empowerment, enormous scales of available information, specific audiences can be targeted effectively and people can be brought together through the medium.{{Sfn|O'Hara|2002}}

===Online versus offline===
The Internet is a place where many [[reference group|reference]] and [[social group]]s are available with similar views. It has become a place where it appears that people have less of a fear of isolation. One research article examined individuals' willingness to speak their opinion online and offline. Through survey results, from 305 participants, a comparison and contrast of online and offline spiral of silence behaviors was determined.{{Sfn|Liu|Fahmy|2009|p=36}} Liu and Fahmy stated that "it is easy to quit from an online discussion without the pressure of complying with the majority group."{{Sfn|Liu|Fahmy|2009}} This is not to say that a spiral of silence does not occur in an online environment. People are still less likely to speak out, even in an online setting, when there is a dominant opinion that differs from their own.{{Sfn|Liu|Fahmy|2009}} But people in the online environment will speak up if someone has a reference group that speaks up for them.{{Sfn|Liu|Fahmy|2009}} In an online situation, just having one person be there to encourage a minority point of view can put an end to a spiral of silence. Another reason for why the spiral of silence theory has less of an effect online could be that studies do not acknowledge whether the person is more likely to speak out against dominant views offline as well.{{Sfn|Liu|Fahmy|2009}} The person might have characteristics that make him comfortable speaking out against dominant views offline, which make them just as comfortable speaking out in an online setting. Even though research suggests that there is a chance people will speak out with their opinions more often in an online setting, silencing of views can still occur. Another research article examined the influence of different opinion climates in [[online forum]]s (opinion congruence with the majority of forum participants vs. website source) and found personal opinion congruence was more influential than the online site in which the forum is situated in.&lt;ref name="JMCQ2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nekmat|author2=Gonzenbach|journal=JMCQ|year=2013|volume=90|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gonzenbach and Nekmat said it might be worth researching whether the factors in these studies or other factors cause people to be more comfortable when it comes to speaking their mind while online.&lt;ref name="JMCQ2013"/&gt;

===Heterogeneity and anonymity===
The nature of the Internet facilitates not only the participation of more people, but also a more heterogeneous group of people. Page stated, "The onward rush of electronic communications technology will presumably increase the diversity of available ideas and the speed and ease with which they fly about and compete with each other."{{Sfn|Page|1996|p=124}} The reason people engage in deliberations is because of their differences, and the Internet allows differences to be easily found. The Internet seems the perfect place to find different views of a very diverse group of people who are at the same time open to such difference and disagreement needed for deliberation. Noelle-Neumann's initial idea of cowering and muted citizens is difficult to reconcile with empirical studies documenting uninhibited discussion in computer-mediated contexts such as [[chat room]]s and newsgroups.{{Sfn|Wanta|Dimitrova|2000}}{{Sfn|O'Sullivan|1995}}{{Sfn|Sproull|Kiesler|1992}}{{Sfn|Hiltz|Johnson|Turoff|1986}}

The Internet provides an anonymous setting, and it can be argued that in an anonymous setting, fears of isolation and humiliation would be reduced. Wallace recognized that when people believe their actions cannot be attributed to them personally, they tend to become less inhibited by [[Convention (norm)|social conventions]] and restraints. This can be very positive, particularly when people are offered the opportunity to discuss difficult personal issues under conditions in which they feel safer.{{Sfn|Wallace|1999|pp=124–25}}

The groups' ability to taunt an individual is lessened on the Internet,{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} thus reducing the tendency to conform. Wallace goes on to summarize a number of empirical studies that do find that dissenters feel more liberated to express their views online than offline, which might result from the fact that the person in the minority would not have to endure taunts or ridicule from people that are making up the majority, or be made to feel uncomfortable for having a different opinion.{{Sfn|Wallace|1999}} Stromer-Galley considered that "an absence of [[Nonverbal communication|non-verbal]] cues, which leads to a lowered sense of social presence, and a heightened sense of anonymity" frees people from the psychological barriers that keep them from engaging in a face-to-face deliberation.{{Sfn|Stromer-Galley|2002|p=35}}

The crux of the spiral of silence is that people believe consciously or subconsciously that the expression of unpopular opinions will lead to negative repercussions. These beliefs may not exist on the Internet for several reasons. First, embarrassment and humiliation depends on the physical presence of others.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} In [[computer-mediated communication]], physical isolation often already exists and poses no further threat.{{Sfn|McDevitt|Kiousis|Wahl-Jorgensen|2003}} Second, a great deal of [[normative influence]] is communicated through nonverbal cues, such as [[eye contact]] and [[gestures]],{{Sfn|Burgoon|Buller|Woodall|1989}} but computer-mediated communication typically precludes many of these cues. Third, Keisler, Siegel, and McQuire observe that nonverbal [[social context]] cues convey formality and status inequality in [[face-to-face communication]].{{Sfn|Keisler|Siegel|McQuire|1984}} When these cues are removed, the importance of [[social status]] as a source of influence recedes. Group hierarchies that develop in face-to-face interaction emerge less clearly in a mediated environment.{{Sfn|Williams|1977}} The form and consequences of [[conformity]] influence should undergo significant changes given the interposition of a medium that reduces the [[social presence]] of participants.{{Sfn|McDevitt|Kiousis|Wahl-Jorgensen|2003}} Social presence is defined as the degree of [[salience (language)|salience]] of the other person in the interaction{{Sfn|Short|Williams|Christie|1976}} or the degree to which the medium conveys some of the person's presence.{{Sfn|Rice|Williams|1984}}

===Equality===
An important issue in obtaining heterogeneity in conversation is equal access for all the participants and [[equal opportunities]] to influence in the discussion. When people believe they are ignorant about a topic, incapable to participate in a discussion or not equal to their peers, they tend to not even become involved in a [[deliberation]]. When people do decide to participate, their participation might be overruled by [[pecking order|dominant others]], or their contribution might be valued less or more, depending on their status.{{Sfn|McDevitt|Kiousis|Wahl-Jorgensen|2003}} Dahlberg praises the Internet for its possibility to liberate people from the [[social hierarchies]] and power relations that exist offline: "The 'blindness' of [[cyberspace]] to bodily identity... [is supposed to allow] people to interact as if they were equals. Arguments are said to be assessed by the value of the claims themselves and not the [[social position]] of the poster".{{Sfn|Dahlberg|2001|p=14}}

Gastil sees this feature as one of the strongest points of the Internet: "if computer-mediated interaction can consistently reduce the independent influence of status, it will have a powerful advantage over face-to-face deliberation".{{Sfn|Gastil|2000|p=359}} While status cues are difficult to detect, perceptions about the status converge, and this lessens [[stereotyping]] and [[prejudice]].{{Sfn|Wallace|1999}}

It may be that people do feel more equal in online forums than they feel offline. [[Racism]], [[ageism]], and other kinds of [[discrimination]] against out groups "seems to be diminishing because the cues to [[Outgroup (sociology)|out-group]] status are not as obvious".{{Sfn|Wallace|1999|p=99}} Next to this, the Internet has rapidly and dramatically increased the capacities to develop, [[Information sharing|share]] and [[information organization|organize]] [[information]],{{Sfn|Warren|2001}} realizing more equality of [[information access|access to information]].{{Sfn|Gimmler|2001}}

==Methodological research approaches==
The relationship between the perception of public opinion and willingness to speak-up is mainly measured through [[Opinion poll|survey]]s&lt;ref name=Method&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neuwirth|first1=K|title=The Spiral of Silence and Fear of Isolation|journal=Journal of Communication|date=2007|volume=57|issue=3|pages=450–468|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2007.00352.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In surveys, respondents are often asked whether they would reveal their opinions given a hypothetical situation, right after their opinions about the public opinion and their opinion is received. Whether asking hypothetical questions can reflect real life cases was questioned by some communication scholars, leading to a criticism of this [[methodology]] as not being able to capture what the respondent would do in a real-life situation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Real Talk: Manipulating the Dependent Variable in Spiral of Silence Research|journal=Communication Research|date=1 June 2001|volume=28|issue=3|pages=304–324|doi=10.1177/009365001028003003|last1=Scheufele|first1=D. A.|last2=Shanahan|first2=J.|last3=Lee|first3=E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A research study addressed this criticism by comparatively testing a spiral model both in a hypothetical survey and in a [[focus group]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The findings are in line with the critic of hypothetical survey questions, demonstrating a significant increase in the spiral of silence in focus groups.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Among different approaches to survey methodology, [[cross-sectional study]] design is the leading method employed to analyze and test the theory.&lt;ref name=Method /&gt; Cross-sectional design involves the analysis of the relationship between public opinion and willingness to speak at one point in time.&lt;ref name="Method" /&gt;

While many of the researchers employ cross-sectional design, some scholars employed [[panel data]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Katz|first1=Cheryl|title=Popularity in a Freefall: Measuring a Spiral of Silence at the End of the Bush Presidency|last2=Baldassare|first2=Mark|journal=[[International Journal of Public Opinion Research]]|date=1994|volume=6|issue=1|pages=1–12|doi=10.1093/ijpor/6.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this methodology, three specific approaches have been used. Noelle-Neumann herself tested the theory from the aggregate level. Using this approach, the change process is "observed by comparing the absolute share of people perceiving a majority climate with people willing to express their views over time."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The second approach that has been used in Spiral of Silence research is conducting separate regressions for each panel survey wave. The drawback for this approach is that the individual change of climate and opinions perception is ignored.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The last approach a few scholars used in conducting Spiral of Silence researches is to use changed scores as dependent variables. However, as intuitive as this approach may be, it "leads to well-documented difficulties with respect to statistical properties, such as regression to the mean or the negative correlation of the change score with the time one state".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Criticisms==
The critics of this theory most often claim that individuals have different influences that affect whether they speak out or not.

Research indicates that people fear isolation in their small social circles more than they do in the population at large. Within a large nation, one can always find a group of people who share one's opinions, however people fear isolation from their close family and friends more in theory. Research has demonstrated that this fear of isolation is stronger than the fear of being isolated from the entire public, as it is typically measured.{{Sfn|Moy|Domke|Stamm|2001}}

Scholars have also argued that both personal characteristics and various culture among different groups will have influences on whether a person will willingly speak out. If one person "has a positive self-concept and lacks a sense of shame, that person will speak out regardless of how she or he perceives the climate of public opinion."{{Sfn|Ross|2007}} Another influence critics give for people choosing not to speak out against public opinion is culture. Open expression of ideas is forbidden in some of the cultures.{{Sfn|Ross|2007}} Some cultures are more individualistic, which would support more of an individual's own opinion, while collectivist cultures support the overall group's opinion and needs. Gender can be also considered as a cultural factor. In some cultures, women's "perception of language, not public opinion, forces them to remain quiet."{{Sfn|Ross|2007}} Scheufele &amp; Moy, further assert that certain conflict styles and cultural indicators should be used to understand these differences.{{Sfn|Scheufele|Moy|2000}}

Another criticism of the spiral of silence research is that the research designs do not observe the movement in the spiral over time. Critics propose that Noelle-Neumann's emphasis on time&lt;ref name="NoelleBook" /&gt; in the formation of the spiral should reflect on the methodology as well, and the dynamic nature of the spiral model should be acknowledged. They argue that the spiral of silence theory involves a "time factor", considering that the changes in public opinion eventually lead to change in people's assessments of the public opinion.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matthes|first1=J.|title=Observing the "Spiral" in the Spiral of Silence|journal=[[International Journal of Public Opinion Research]]|volume=27|issue=2|pages=155–176|date=2014|doi=10.1093/ijpor/edu032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, according to Spilchal, the spiral of silence theory "ignores the evidence of the historical development of public opinion, both in theory and practice, through the extension of suffrage, organisation of political propaganda groups, the establishment of pressure groups and political parties, the eligibility of ever wider circles of public officials and, eventually, the installation of several forms of direct democracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=|title=Legacy of Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann: The Spiral of Silence and Other Controversies|last=Splichal|first=Slavko|date=2015|journal=European Journal of Communication|doi=10.1177/0267323115589265|pmid=|access-date =|volume=30|issue=3|pages=353–363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars also provide understandings of the theory in the contemporary society by pointing out that "it is not so much the actual statistical majority that generates pressure for conformity as it is the climate of opinion conveyed in large measure by the media."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Under the great influence by the media coverage, the climate of opinion "is not invariably an accurate reflection of the distribution of opinions within the polity."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Further, Scheufele &amp; Moy{{Sfn|Scheufele|Moy|2000}} find problems in the operationalization of key terms, including willingness to speak out. This construct should be measured in terms of actually speaking out, not voting or other conceptually similar constructs. Conformity experiments have no moral component, yet morality is a key construct in the model. These conformity experiments, particularly those by Asch, form part of the base of the theory. Scholars question whether these conformity experiments are relevant to the development of the Spiral of Silence.{{Sfn|Scheufele|Moy|2000}}

===False dilemmas and silence of consistency===
Research indicates that while the existence of groups with other opinions than those that are supposed to be dominant in a society opens a possibility for some people to express some different opinions, fallacy assumptions in such groups that criticism of particular aspects of that group's program is support for society's mainstream views is a source of false dilemmas. This research indicates that such false dilemmas, especially when there are inconsistencies both in mainstream views and in organized opposition views, causes a spiral of silence that specifically silences logically consistent third, fourth or higher number viewpoint criticism. The research in question does not find a solution in many approaches of "recognizing cognitive bias" but instead indicate that such assumptions are part of the problem by promoting the myth of one's own group having overcome its bias by institutional means and allegations of rational critical arguments being due to bias in the minds of critics, citing evolutionary research that shows that not only would any predisposition for justification of views be selected against due to costing nutrients without improving adaptivity of behavior, but that the claim that most adult humans are irrational due to missing stimulation of rationality in early childhood is also evolutionarily indefensible as genes for potential rationality would have been totally eliminated by selection before reaching significant population fraction if they needed a society already promoting rationality to manifest themselves adaptively. The research indicates that humans are not inherently irrational but are forced to pretend irrationality by false dilemmas that claim rational criticism to be justifications for irrational resentment, and suggest that openly expressed rationality can be promoted by discussions in which no exclusion based on traditional political scales or beneficiary classifications exist but all allegations of irrational motives as well as assumptions that some opinions are linked  or that criticism of one view is defence of another specific view are excluded.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Scott Percival (2012). "The Myth of the Closed Mind: Explaining why and how People are Rational".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angelo Fusari (2014). "Methodological Misconceptions in the Social Sciences: Rethinking Social Thought and Social Processes".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Srugim''''' ({{lang-he-n|סרוגים}}; literally, "knitted" or "crocheted") is an [[Israel]]i television drama which originally aired on [[Yes (Israel)|Yes TV]] between 2008 and 2012. It was directed by Eliezer "Laizy" Shapiro, who co-created it with Havvah Deevon. The series depicted the lives of five [[Religious Zionism|national religious]] single men and women, in their 30s, who reside in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://jewishreviewofbooks.com/articles/185/no-sex-in-the-city-on-srugim/ No Sex in the City: On Srugim]&lt;/ref&gt; The title is a reference to the [[kippah#types and variation#Crocheted|crocheted skullcaps]] worn by men of that denomination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/television/2014/06/israeli_tv_series_srugim_reviewed.html The Best TV Show of 2014 Is From 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Srugim'', which dealt with controversial issues in the Religious Zionist society in Israel, caused a public uproar within that sector.

It enjoyed high ratings, from both the religious and non-religious sects in Israel,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishboston.com/an-unexpected-orthodox-television-hit-long-may-srugim-run/ An Unexpected Orthodox Television Hit: Long May Srugim Run]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as with American Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/fans-fret-over-fate-of-popular-tv-show/ Fans fret over fate of popular TV show]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the American Jews compared the issues of the characters in the show to those of the [[Upper West Side]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://forward.com/sisterhood/123571/the-women-of-israels-hit-tv-show-srugim/ The Women of Israel's Hit TV Show 'Srugim']&lt;/ref&gt; The show won five [[Israeli Academy of Film and Television]] Awards.

In 2012 it was announced that the show would not be picked up for a fourth season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4225224,00.html As 'Srugim' ends, yarmulkes disappear from prime-time TV]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

===Season 1===
{{main|Srugim (season 1)}}
Yifat and Hodaya, who went to an [[Ulpana|all-girls school]] together, now share an apartment in [[Katamon]], the hub of religious singles' social life in Jerusalem. Yifat meets Nati, a childhood friend who is now a successful doctor, and he introduces the two women to his roommate, Amir, a recently divorced teacher. Reut, a high-earning accountant who is also a [[Jewish feminism|religious feminist]], joins their small band. The five are all [[Religious Zionist]], unmarried, and in their late twenties or early thirties; they must cope with a society that expects people to get married while young.

Yifat falls for Nati, who seems oblivious. When she confesses her feelings, he admits he knew it all along but does not reciprocate. Hodaya, who is becoming less pious, meets Avri, a secular archaeologist, and they date. Amir must deal with the stigma of being divorced, which hampers his chances to enter a new relationship; when he encounters his divorcée, Na'ama, their mutual loneliness leads them to have sex. They must [[Get (Judaism)|divorce again in a Rabbinical court]]. Reut wants to [[Cantillation|cantillate]] the [[haftara]], and she convinces the initially reluctant Yochai to teach her. Though rejecting the notion of a woman chanting at first, he soon becomes enamored with her. When he cannot control himself and kisses Reut, he immediately proposes marriage. Unsure, she decides to keep dating him and sees another man simultaneously. Hodaya profanes the Sabbath for the first time in her life and then lets Avri drive her to the beach, where she tells him the truth.

Reut begins to lose interest in Yochai. Although intending to consummate her relationship with Avri, Hodaya flinches at the last moment, and she decides to end their romance, stating that the differences between them are too great. Tired of Jerusalem, Yifat moves to a quiet [[Israeli settlement|settlement]]. Amir begins visiting Yifat, and the two become close friends. Nati tries to approach her again, angering Amir. The two come to blows, but eventually they reconcile. Amir and Yifat decide to marry. After meeting up with her niece, who was [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza|evicted from Gaza]] and who consequently lost her faith, Hodaya resolves to [[Yetzia bish'eila|disaffiliate]]. Reut breaks up with Yochai and goes on a long trip to [[India]].

===Season 2===
{{main|Srugim (season 2)}}
Season 2 began approximately six months after the conclusion of season 1. Amir and Yifat get married, and now must cope with the new hardships, including fertility problems and the need to observe [[Niddah|ritual purity]]. Amir returns to his roots and begins praying in a [[Tunisian Jews|Tunisian]] synagogue with an old man named Shmuel. He is frowned upon by his [[Ashkenazi]] environment. Nati's mother dies, and his brother Roi moves in with him. Reut returns from India after six months, after missing Amir and Yifat's wedding, as well as her sister Elisheva's wedding, who is now pregnant. Reut begins to date Roi, only to have Roi later reveal that he is a homosexual, to Nati's surprise. Reut refuses to give up on them and continues to date him, however Roi eventually ends things. Nati falls in love with Dafna, a divorced mother who works in his hospital as a [[medical clown]], though he leaves her after realizing he cannot cope with raising her son. Hodaya, trying to lead a secular lifestyle, works in a pub and meets Assaf, another formerly religious man, with whom she loses her virginity. She breaks with him after discovering that he began practicing again.

===Season 3===
{{main|Srugim (season 3)}}
Yifat finally becomes pregnant. Roi has turned [[Ultra-Orthodox|ultra-orthodox]] and has an arranged marriage. Amir quits his job as a teacher, finds a new one as Reut's secretary and finally receives a lifelong tuition to study in a [[Yeshiva|seminary]]. Nati has a new roommate, a poet named Azaria, who was abandoned by his fiancée, Tehila. Nati falls in love with Tehila but cannot convince her to see him for she vowed to remain single until Azaria finds a new partner. Nati encourages Reut to date Azaria, who begins to exploit her for her money. After becoming drunk, he confesses that he does not love her and she abandons him. Tehila starts seeing Nati; he is finally ready to commit and proposes to her, and she seems to accept. Hodaya encounters Avri again. He cancels his own planned wedding and asks her to marry him instead. Hodaya backs off once more, just a few days before the ceremony, leaving him heartbroken. Amir becomes friends with a boy at his yeshiva and goes to work in a ranch in the [[Negev]] with him for a few weeks. Hodaya receives a radio show of her own, becomes stressed and quits. Yifat admonishes her for her constant wavering. Tehila speaks with Azaria, and informs Nati they decided to resume their relationship. Nati sinks into depression. Yifat delivers her baby prematurely; Reut and Hodaya stay with her while Nati drives off to fetch Amir. He must stay in the empty ranch while Amir drives back to Jerusalem. Reut comes to bring him back, and they both reconcile while staying in the desert. Hodaya, who heeded Yifat's words, gets her job back and reunites with Avri. Amir and Yifat prepare to take their newborn son home.

==Production==
Laizy Shapiro and Havvaah Deevon became acquainted while studying in the Ma'ale School of Television, Film and the Arts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122946902888612081 "This School Makes Film a Kosher Career Course," ''The Wall Street Journal,'' Dec 17, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the Gesher Multicultural Film Fund announced its intention to create a picture about religious-secular relations and held a contest for a script. Shapiro and Deevon submitted a treatment for a romantic comedy about a relationship between a bachelor living in [[Ramat Gan]] and a young settler from [[Hebron]]. Shapiro told her he had a similar idea already in his second year in Ma'ale, in 2000. Their entry was rejected, but they met Jonathan Aroch, a veteran producer, who served as their mentor during the competition. Aroch suggested they write another outline. Their second script concerned a religious single from Jerusalem named Nati, who is frustrated with dating and has resolved to give it only another year and then marry the first woman he encounters. This second entry was also declined. Shapiro and Divon returned to their regular jobs.

A year later, Aroch contacted both again, suggesting they make a television series about the religious singles scene in Jerusalem, the so-called "Katamon swamp" or "marsh".&lt;ref&gt;Reina Rutlinger-Reiner. [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/israel_studies/v016/16.3.rutlinger-reiner.html ''"Drowning in the Marsh": Israeli Orthodox Theatrical Representations of the Singles Scene'']. Israel Studies, Volume 16, Number 3, Fall 2011, pp. 73-96.&lt;/ref&gt; A real sociological phenomenon, the "swamp" is a large concentration of middle-class Religious Zionist men and women who remain unmarried at a relatively advanced age, a trend causing much strain in their society. Divon and Shapiro created a basic outline for a show, and conceived of the five main characters. They planned to name the series, ''Kovshei Katamon'' ("Conquerors of Katamon"), which is the name of one of the area's main streets and a reference to the neighborhood's "conquest" by members of the "swamp". The studios refused to accept the title. On 20 July 2006, [[Ma'ariv]] first reported about contacts between Aroch and the television companies of [[Keshet Broadcasting|Keshet]] and [[Yes (Israel)|Yes]], concerning the future purchase of the series, labeled under the working title ''Sex v'ha'Ir haQdosha'' ("Sex and the Holy City").&lt;ref&gt;Danny Spector. ''[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3559983,00.html Sex and the holy city]''. YNET, 25 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that due to the high production costs expected, the companies considered broadcasting it first on satellite and later on terrestrial television, to ensure maximal revenues.

After Yes bought the rights, Aroch hired a group of screenwriters, many of them Ma'ale alumni and residents of the "swamp" themselves. Divon, Shapiro and their team wrote a full screenplay for a first season of fifteen episodes. Shapiro was also chosen to direct it. Auditions were held in September and October 2007. Towards the end of the second month, Aroch himself selected the final name of the show, ''Srugim'' –  alluding to the crocheted skullcaps worn by national religious men, which distinguish them from other sectors.&lt;ref&gt;Elana Maryles Sztokman. ''The Men's Section: Orthodox Jewish Men in an Egalitarian World''. UPNE, 2011. {{ISBN|978-1611680799}}. p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Principal photography was held in the winter of 2008. All studio filming was carried out in Tel-Aviv, but external photography occurred in Jerusalem and in [[Nofei Prat]], which served as the fictional settlement to which Yifat moves.

The second season was shot in the summer of 2009. Principal photography for the third season began on 21 February 2010. In early May 2012, though the last season was considered the most successful so far, Shapiro and Divon announced they would not produce a fourth one, and the show was terminated.&lt;ref&gt;Yitzhak Tessler.

In February 2010, the series began to air on [[The Jewish Channel]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tjctv.com/tjc-original-programming/srugim The Jewish Channel information on Srugim.]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, all of the series is available on [[Amazon Prime]].

===Reviews===
Jeffrey Woolf, a [[Bar-Ilan University]] expert on [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] Jewish portrayals in the media, explains why this series has become popular not only with the secular "TV-watching" community, but also with many members of modern orthodoxy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's really the first time that the religious-Zionist community has been represented in a non-stereotyped way on television.... Religious characters are usually cartoon-like in their superficiality, either because of malice or because of ignorance....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He claims that the show is important for both the religious and secular elements, because while many of the modern orthodox viewers can finally see characters with whom they identify, it offers secular viewers access to "an entire [religious] world that is normally inaccessible”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejc.com/news/israel-news/26323/frum-friends-storms-israeli-primetime Frum Friends Storm Israeli TV, The Jewish Chronicle Online, Jan 21, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of writers note that the phenomenon of a growing number of Jewish singles in the religious community is one factor in the show's popularity, because it is unprecedented in Jewish history, where marriages between religiously observant men and women traditionally occurred while both partners were young.&lt;ref name="swamp"&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=165882 "Swamped with Singles," Jerusalem Post, Jan 19, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; Many reasons contribute to this change, including the financial ability of women to live on their own, rather than under the "protection" of their husband, but whatever the reasons, this change has created many new questions and challenges in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewcentral.com/article-print-476.html "A Modern Orthodox Friends," JewCentral.com, Nov 4, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yair Rosenberg]] writes in the ''[[Jewish Review of Books]]'' that the program has become an "Israeli [[popular culture|pop culture]] phenomenon."&lt;ref name="Yair"&gt;No Sex in the City: On Srugim, Yair Rosenberg, [[Jewish Review of Books]], Spring 2010, [http://www.jewishreviewofbooks.com/publications/detail/no-sex-in-the-city-on-srugim]&lt;/ref&gt; However, while he agrees that the show has become extremely popular among members of both the religious and non-religious communities, there have been some detractors, including Rabbi [[Shlomo Aviner]]:&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3582253,00.html Rabbi: It's okay to multi-date if you're old]''. YNET, 14 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;One prominent Religious Zionist rabbi went so far as to place the show under a religious ban, citing the questionable conduct of various dati characters on the show. "There is bad language and licentiousness. It is not enough to be {{'}}''shomer [[negiah]]''{{'}} [to observe the prohibition against touching someone of the opposite sex], and this is also not always followed [on the show]—one needs purity and modesty," he wrote.&lt;ref name="Yair"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[The Jewish Week]]'' wrote that the show "is attracting a growing audience here in the States," and it is being discussed in many forums, including [[Facebook]].

In [[literary criticism]], '''stream of unconsciousness''' is a [[narrative mode]] that portrays an individual's point of view by transcribing the author's [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] dialogue or ''[[somniloquy]]'' during sleep, in connection to his or her actions within a [[dream]].&lt;ref&gt;"Episode 5: Recent Sleep Works." ''Glossolalia''. [http://glossolalia-ailalossolg.blogspot.com/2010/05/episode-5.html], Resonance 104.4 FM, London. 17 May 2010. Radio.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stream of unconsciousness is characterized by disjointed leaps in ideation and story line, bizarre new word creation, loss of self-censorship, one sided conversations and punctuation that can make the prose both disturbing and difficult to follow.  Despite the name, the stream of unconsciousness occurs more in the form of waves than an actual continuous running stream of dialogue. The stream of unconsciousness is one of several forms of [[dramatic monologue]], where the speaker is addressing an audience or a third person. Such monologues are commonly used in [[poetry]] and [[drama]], but with the stream of unconsciousness, the audience or third persons are 'unknowingly' imaginary.  It is primarily a fictional device and often takes the form of a [[tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;"Razen: The Science of Sleep". [http://www.foxydigitalis.com/foxyd/?p=15396], USA. 04 Aug. 2011 Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was introduced to the field of literary studies from that of the independent music industry, where it was redefined by author and artist [[Bryan Lewis Saunders]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;"Stream of Unconconscious on Stand-Up Tragedy" [http://antonmobin.blogspot.com/2011/06/stream-of-unconscious-on-stand-up.html], France. 13 June 2011 Web.&lt;/ref&gt; For nearly a century the term has been both a misnomer and a [[malapropism]] for the [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]].

==History==
The audio recordings of [[Dion McGregor]] (1922–1994) can be perceived as one of the precursors of the 'stream of unconsciousness' (narrative mode), although his monlogues and somniloquy were never transcribed and presented as such.  "Dreams" (1995) by contemporary American artist [[Jim Shaw (artist)|Jim Shaw]] is a collection of  illustrations and extremely detailed dream descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;"Dreams".[https://www.blumandpoe.com/content/jim-shaw-dreams], Los Angeles. 2008 Web.&lt;/ref&gt; "Experiment with Dreams" by [[Leif Elggren]] and Thomas Liljenberg (Stockholm Feb. 1996) may also be attributed to the formation of this method.&lt;ref&gt;"Experiment with Dreams". [http://web.comhem.se/elggren/experiment.html], Stockholm. Feb. 1996 Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable works==

Examples of notable works employing the stream of unconsciousness narrative mode are:
*"Le Bobcat" Bryan Lewis Saunders and Raymond Dijkstra. Short Story on Cassette ([[Fragment Factory]] 2010)
*"The Reasons Why I Dream With Knives" Bryan Lewis Saunders. Nonfiction Book (Stand-Up Tragedy 2010)
*"The Confessor" is a book on tape composed of 24 album chapters on 12 audio cassettes.  With each album serving as a chapter, over 24 musicians and experimental sound artists created music for the unconscious epic poem by Bryan Lewis Saunders. "The Confessor" was created from app. 30 nights of somniloquy and dream descriptions. Poem and Book on Tape (Stand-Up Tragedy 2011)
*"Protective Geometry" [[Ed Pinsent]] and Bryan Lewis Saunders. Comic Book. (2012)

'''Tasoula Georgiou Hadjitofi''' ([[Modern Greek|Greek]]: Τασούλα Γεωργίου Χατζητοφή) was born in 1959 in [[Cyprus]] and lives in the [[Netherlands]]. She is a cultural activist  and an entrepreneur.

==Combating art trafficking ==
Hadjitofi, also known as "Icon Hunter", began her work repatriating stolen [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] in the early 1980s and is best known for orchestrating the “Munich Case”,&lt;ref name="archaeology"&gt;Rose, Mark. “From Cyprus to Munich”. Archaeological Institute of America. 20 April 1998. Web. 9 February 2012. &lt;http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/cyprus/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; one of the largest art trafficking [[sting operations]] in European history.  Her efforts led to the arrest of the Turkish art smuggler [[Aydin Dikmen]] and the confiscation of over $60 million' worth of looted artifacts from [[Cyprus]] and around the world.&lt;ref name="Bourloyannis"&gt;Bourloyannis, M. Christiane, and Virginia Morris. 1992. “Autocephalous Greek-Orthodox Church of Cyprus v. Goldberg &amp; Feldman Fine Arts, Inc”. The American Journal of International Law, 86 (1): 128-133&lt;/ref&gt;

It began when as Honorary Consul to Cyprus (a non-paid position), she was approached by Michel van Rijn, an art dealer turned informant, wishing to exchange information about [[Looted art#Cyprus Looting Overview|stolen Cypriot treasures]]&lt;ref name="news"&gt;Morris, Chris. “Shame of Cyprus’s Looted Churches”. BBC News. 18 January 2002. Web. 9 February 2012. &lt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1768274.stm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in return for payment.  Tasoula spent the next ten years of her life tracking down information and leads from both Van Rijn and her own research, culminating in the planning and execution of the Munich Case.&lt;ref name="archive.archaeology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/9807/etc/special.html |title=Special Report: Church Treasures of Cyprus - Archaeology Magazine Archive |publisher=Archive.archaeology.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, at the height of her accomplishment, Hadjitofi was removed from office because her contribution to her country was overshadowing the paid diplomats and civil servants.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Fifteen years later, due to mismanagement, the case remained in the courts. In addition to this, Aydin Dikmen, sued the Church of Cyprus for ownership of the stolen treasures&lt;ref name="cyprus-mail"&gt;Cyprus Mail {{cite web |url=http://www.cyprus-mail.com/cultural-heritage/grave-concern-stolen-religious-treasures/20130106 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323095526/http://www.cyprus-mail.com/cultural-heritage/grave-concern-stolen-religious-treasures/20130106 |archivedate=2013-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that he was convicted of stealing from Cyprus and the stolen artifacts remain in the possession of the German Police.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Meanwhile, the people of Cyprus had no access to their cultural heritage,{{clarify|date=March 2016}} until the most recent Court of Appeal of the Court of Munich. The court decision of the 18th of March 2013 made it possible for the remaining Cypriot artifacts to return to Cyprus, as they are now indisputably Cypriot.

These experiences led Tasoula Hadjitofi to create “Walk Of Truth”,&lt;ref name="cyprus-mail_a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyprus-mail.com/tasoula-hadjitofi/wheels-change/20120113 |title=The wheels of change |publisher=Cyprus Mail |date=2012-01-13 |accessdate=2013-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[non-governmental organization]] with the mission of combating art trafficking by creating reforms to protect [[cultural heritage]] in conflict areas.

== Personal Life and Career ==

Tasoula Hadjitofi was born and raised in [[Famagusta]] Cyprus. In 1974, she and her family were forced to flee their home due to the [[Turkish Invasion of Cyprus]] and the outbreak of the war.&lt;ref name="cyprusnet"&gt;“Turkish Invasion and Cyprus Occupation”. Press and Information Office, Republic of Cyprus. CyprusNet.com. 2005. Web. 12 February 2012. &lt; {{cite web |url=http://www.cyprusnet.com/content.php?article_id=2794&amp;subject=standalone |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708215339/http://www.cyprusnet.com/content.php?article_id=2794&amp;subject=standalone |archivedate=2011-07-08 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to become a successful entrepreneur, founding Octagon Professionals International, a company specializing in the provision of IT services and professional manpower to clients throughout Europe and Asia. She was the first woman (and youngest person at the age of 27) to be appointed [[Honorary Consul]] to Cyprus in her adopted country of the Netherlands. She served as Representative of the Church of Cyprus where she sought justice for the looting of Cyprus' cultural heritage through repatriation of its stolen religious artifacts. Her work with Archbishop Chrysostomos I culminated in the orchestrating the Munich Operation, which led to the arrest of art trafficker Aydin Dikmen and the recovery of over $60 million of stolen antiquities from Cyprus and around the world.

Tasoula Hadjitofi is married to Dr. Michael Hadjitofi and is a mother to son Andreas and daughters Sophia and Marina.

== Walk of Truth ==
Mrs. Hadjitofi’s non-governmental organization, ''Walk of Truth'', engages the public about the importance of protecting global heritage. Walk of Truth organizes debates about art trafficking and restitution and rallies governments, political leaders legislatures, law enforcement, museums and cultural organizations for global unity in combatting art trafficking and protecting cultural heritage in areas of conflict. Its latest initiative, Cultural Crime Watchers Worldwide (CCWW) empowers people to leave anonymous tips to do with the destruction and looting of cultural heritage. Walk of Truth connects people with cultural heritage and cultural heritage with people.

== Accolades ==

She was nominated as “Woman of Europe 2008”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.greekamericannewsagency.com/2010-01-19-17-50-12/2010-02-21-15-39-14/2010-02-21-16-57-03/2544-|title=Τασούλα Χατζητοφή - Υποψήφια ''Γυναίκα της Ευρώπης 2007''|date=10 December 2007|work=Greek American News Agency|language=Greek|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cyprus Weekly Flair Magazine"&gt;"November 2008 - Cyprus Weekly Flair Magazine p.32"&gt; &lt;http://issuu.com/annafo/docs/flair_issue_1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; for her outstanding work in fighting art trafficking.

'''''The Hippopotamus''''' (1994) is a [[comic novel]] by [[Stephen Fry]]. Written in part as an [[epistolary novel]], it is largely narrated by the main character Edward "Ted" Wallace. Wallace is an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] washed-up poet and [[theatre criticism|theatre critic]] who, having been fired from his newspaper job, accepts a lucrative commission from his [[terminal illness|terminally ill]] goddaughter to investigate rumours of [[faith healing|miracle healings]] at Swafford Hall, country mansion of Wallace's old friend Lord Logan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Traugott |first=Maggie |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/book-review--trudy-truth-frys-funny-the-hippopotamus-by-stephen-fry-hutchinson-pounds-1499-1369036.html |title=Fry's funny: The hippopotamus by Stephen Fry |date=9 April 1994 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title==
The novel's title comes from the poem of the same name by [[T. S. Eliot]], whose first verse is quoted as the epigraph:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/199/20.html Bartleby.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Blockquote|The broad-backed hippopotamus&lt;br&gt;Rests on his belly in the mud;&lt;br&gt;Although he seems so firm to us&lt;br&gt;He is merely flesh and blood.}}

The title draws comparisons between the animal as described in the poem and the main character, Ted Wallace, a slovenly man who enjoys long baths. (Hence cover designs picturing an actual hippopotamus or Fry himself in a bathtub.) The title and epigraph imply as well one of the novel's themes: the practicality of poetry and how that helps Wallace, a poet, regard the "miracles" in the story with a sceptical eye.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/markkermode/entries/8227f6fd-65a0-452e-bf7a-4c9068fa96ca BBC]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The "hippo" of the title (occasionally referred to as "the happy hippo" and given to wallowing in long baths) is Edward (Ted/Tedward) Lennox Wallace, an aging, lecherous, one-time hell-raising poet, reduced by diminishing poetic talent to working as a theatre critic. The story opens with the aftermath of Ted being fired from his job on a newspaper.

At the suggestion of a sick goddaughter, Jane (suffering from [[leukaemia]]), he goes to stay at the [[Norfolk]] country house of old schoolfriend and Army colleague from [[National Service]], Lord Michael Logan and his wife Lady Anne, to investigate unspecified mysterious goings-on.

Ted reports back to Jane regularly, in the form of long, rambling letters, apprising her of events at Swafford Hall whilst also offering his views on numerous other issues (women, art, poetry, sex, morality and modern life being favorite topics), all the time attempting to uncover the nature of the unusual events that Jane has instructed him to look out for.

Over the course of his stay it gradually becomes apparent that other house guests are ascribing [[Faith healing|healing]] powers to one of Logan's children, David (Ted's other godchild), and indeed it is in the hope that he might bestow his 'talent' upon them that they have descended upon Swafford Hall. Amongst the assembled guests are a witty and hugely camp, but rebarbative defrocked minister and TV producer, a businessman and his wife and rather gawky teenage daughter, a friend of Jane's, and Jane's mother, a woman Ted has crossed paths with disastrously many years earlier.

The life stories of the [[tycoon]] Logan and his family, as well as Ted's own, are intertwined to provide a colourful and credible back story.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} The story is run through with a stream of sexual practices, some more unusual than others, as Ted uncovers the means&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/thrill-of-the-chaste-the-truth-about-gandhis-sex-life-1937411.html Independent.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; by which David delivers his 'healing'.

The story contains several (spoof) [[poem]]s and [[Limerick (poetry)|limerick]]s.

'''''The House of Silk''''' is a [[Sherlock Holmes]] novel written by British author [[Anthony Horowitz]], published in 2011. The book was promoted with the claim it was the first time the [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Conan Doyle]] Estate had authorised a new non-Doyle [[Sherlock Holmes pastiches|Sherlock Holmes pastiche]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Driscoll|first=Molly|title=Sherlock Holmes comes back to life in "The House of Silk" |url=https://www.csmonitor.com/Books/chapter-and-verse/2011/1104/Sherlock-Holmes-comes-back-to-life-in-The-House-of-Silk|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=4 November 2011|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/12/sherlock-holmes-novel-anthony-horowitz|title=New Sherlock Holmes novel by Anthony Horowitz out in November|last=Kennedy|first=Maev|date=12 April 2011|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alexander|first=Niall|title=It’s All In The Game: Sherlock Holmes and The House of Silk|url=https://www.tor.com/2011/11/23/its-all-in-the-game-sherlock-holmes-and-the-house-of-silk/|publisher=[[Tor.com]]|date=23 November 2011|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
''The House of Silk'' begins with a brief, personal recounting of events by Watson, much like that in ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'' by the original author, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The reader is informed of the particulars regarding the first meeting of Watson and Holmes, including the circumstances of the Afghan War and a mention of the case that was "too shocking to be revealed until now."

The client of "The Flat Cap case" is introduced as a man by the name of Edmund Carstairs, an art dealer whose paintings had been destroyed by a gang of Irish robbers. After the murder of Carstairs' client, and a failure on the part of a hired detective, he turns to Sherlock Holmes, who employs the aid of the Baker Street Irregulars, and upon locating the hotel wherein the supposed Keelan O'Donaghue (one of the leaders of the gang) is currently staying, one of the newest recruits of the Irregulars, a boy named Ross, is stationed to wait outside until Holmes, Watson, and Mr. Carstairs arrive. When the group finally arrives, Ross appears inexplicably horror-stricken and is later found brutally murdered by the thugs of the House of Silk.
When Holmes makes inroads with the House of Silk case, he is framed for murder and sent to prison. Meanwhile, Watson meets with a mystery criminal, later revealed as [[Professor Moriarty]], who provides him with a key to free Holmes from prison, before the detective can be assassinated. Professor Moriarty's motives are uncertain, except that he wishes Holmes to rid the world of the House of Silk, whose activities apparently appall even him. When Watson arrives at the prison, he discovers Holmes has escaped of his own accord, disguised as an aide to the prison doctor, whom he had once helped as a client. Various leads draw them to a [[travelling funfair]], where they are ambushed, before being saved by Lestrade.

The party (Holmes, Watson, Lestrade) makes its way to the "House of Silk", a club operated by a pastor and his wife who also govern a boy's orphanage, and rent the boys to wealthy customers. The members are promptly rounded up by [[Scotland Yard]]. Despite their arrests, however, the case does not come to trial, due to a royal family member having been purportedly involved. It is eventually revealed that Mrs. Carstairs is the true person responsible for The Flat Cap case, being the second leader of the Irish gang.

==Critical reception==

Critical reports were generally positive. On Anthony Horowitz's official site a review of ''[[The Guardian]]'' was posted, stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
So, all of the elements are there: the data, the data, the data. Nothing of consequence overlooked. And yet can Horowitz, like Holmes, make from these drops of water the possibilities of an Atlantic or a Niagara? Can he astonish us? Can he thrill us? Are there "the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis" that we yearn for?  Emphatically, yes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/27/house-silk-anthony-horowitz-sherlock-holmes|title=The House of Silk by Anthony Horowitz – review|last=Sansom|first=Ian|date=27 October 2011|newspaper=Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://anthonyhorowitz.com/newscentre/sherlock-holmes/house-of-silk-the-guardian-review/322/&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Allusions to other literary works==
In chapter one there is some mention of [[C. Auguste Dupin]], a character developed by author [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and his ability to make astounding deductions based on visible emotions reflected through the physical medium. Holmes demonstrates this by uncovering Watson's anxiety and the source thereof. This mention of Dupin is in itself a reference to a reference made by Conan Doyle to the character in the first Holmes novel ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]''.

The supporting character Ephraim Hardcastle (the landlord of the Bag of Nails pub, whose name is revealed in chapter eight) is a reference to the newspaper column of the same name in ''[[The Daily Mail]]'' as written [[pseudonym]]ously by [[Nigel Dempster]] and subsequently Peter McKay.

'''''The Wedding Camels''''' is an [[ethnographic film]] directed by David and Judith MacDougall, filmed in 1974 and released in 1980 (108 min., Turkana with English subtitles), that examines the negotiations and cultural practices that surround the tradition of the [[Turkana people]] of [[Kenya]] of giving a [[Bride price|bridewealth]] before a wedding.&lt;ref&gt;Wedding Camels, VHS.  Directed by David MacDougall, Judith MacDougall, 1974, Berkeley, CA: University of California Extension Center for Media, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; The film was funded and distributed by the [[University of California]] Extension Center for Media.&lt;ref&gt;Emory University Institute of African Studies.  “African Studies Media Catalog,” Emory University. http://www.ias.emory.edu/catalog.cfm?keyword=Turkana (accessed Nov. 13, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Overview ==
The film is observational in style and the Turkana subjects speak for themselves through subtitles, rather than being spoken about through narration.  The MacDougalls' films fit into the forefront of the movement away from narration and towards observational and participatory cinema in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouw, Erik.  Documentary- A History of the Non-Fiction Film.  (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993) 330.&lt;/ref&gt;  The husband and wife team have made several ethnographic films.  ''The Wedding Camels'' is the second of three they made about the Turkana, the others being ''Lorang's Way'' and ''A Wife Among Wives''.  The trilogy is referred to as Turkana Conversations, which speaks to the fact that the McDougalls seem to specialize in forming a comfortable relationship with their subjects that allows them to enter into their private world and record not just interviews, but private conversations among families and community members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Colin|date=1982|title=MacDougall Conversations|url=|journal=RAIN|volume=50|pages=5-8|doi=10.2307/3031771|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
''The Wedding Camels'' won the Royal Anthropological Institute's first Film Award in 1980, for best ethnographic film of the past five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.berkeleymedia.com/product/the_wedding_camels/|title=Berkeley Media: The Wedding Camels|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been awarded honors at film festivals including the Berlin Film Festival, the Edinburgh Film Festival, and the Margaret Mead Film Festival.

{{Grammatical categories}}

In [[linguistics]], the '''topic''', or '''theme''', of a sentence is what is being talked about, and the '''comment''' ('''rheme''' or '''focus''') is what is being said about the topic. This opposition of the given/new information is called [[information structure]]. That the [[information structure]] of a clause is divided in this way is generally agreed on, but the boundary between topic/theme and comment/rheme/focus  depends on [[grammatical theory]]. 

The difference between "topic" and [[Subject (grammar)|grammatical subject]] is that topic is used to describe the information structure, or pragmatic structure of a clause and how it coheres with other clauses, whereas the subject is a purely grammatical category. ''Topic'' and ''subject'' must also be distinguished from ''actor'' (or ''agent''), the "doer". In English clauses with a verb in the passive voice, for instance, the topic is typically the subject, while the agent may be omitted or may follow the preposition ''by''. In some languages, word order and other [[Syntax|syntactic phenomena]] are determined largely by the topic–comment (theme–rheme) structure. These languages are sometimes referred to as [[topic-prominent language]]s. Korean and Japanese are often given as examples of this.

The distinction was probably first suggested by [[Henri Weil]] in 1844&lt;ref&gt;H. Weil, De l’ordre des mots dans les langues anciennes compares aux
langues modernes: question de grammaire gnrale. Joubert, 1844.&lt;/ref&gt;. He established the
connection between [[information structure]] and word order. [[Georg von der Gabelentz]] distinguished '''psychological subject''' (roughly topic) and '''psychological object''' (roughly focus). In the [[Prague school]], the dichotomy, termed '''topic–focus articulation''', has been studied mainly by [[Vilém Mathesius]]&lt;ref&gt;V. Mathesius and J. Vachek, A Functional Analysis of Present Day
English on a General Linguistic Basis, ser. Janua linguarum : Series
practica / Ianua linguarum / Series practica. Mouton, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Jan Firbas]], [[František Daneš]], [[Petr Sgall]] and [[Eva Hajičová]]. They have been concerned mainly by its relation to intonation and word-order. [[Mathesius]] also pointed that the topic does not provide new information but connects the sentence to the context. The work of [[Michael Halliday]] in the 1960s is responsible for developing linguistic science through his [[systemic functional linguistics]] model for English&lt;ref&gt;M.A.K.Halliday, An Introduction to Functional Grammar, 2nd ed.
London: Arnold, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Definitions ==

The sentence- or clause-level "topic", or "theme", can be defined in a number of different ways. Among the most common are
*a) the phrase in a clause that the rest of the clause is understood to be about,
*b) a special position in a clause (often at the right or left-edge of the clause) where topics typically appear.

In an ordinary English clause, the subject is normally the same as the topic/theme (example 1), even in the passive voice (where the subject is a patient, not an agent: example 2):
*(1) ''The dog'' bit the little girl.
*(2) ''The little girl'' was bitten by the dog.

These clauses have different topics: the first is about ''the dog'', and the second about ''the little girl''.

In English it is also possible to use other sentence structures to show the topic of the sentence, as in the following:
*(3) ''As for the little girl'', the dog bit her.
*(4) ''It was the little girl'' that the dog bit.

The case of [[Syntactic expletive|expletives]] is sometimes rather complex. Consider sentences with expletives (meaningless subjects), like:

*(6) It is raining.
*(7) There is some room in this house.
*(8) There are two days in the year in which the day and the night are equal in length.

In these examples the syntactic subject position (to the left of the verb) is manned by the meaningless expletive ("it" or "there"), whose sole purpose is satisfying the [[extended projection principle]], and is nevertheless necessary. In these sentences the topic is never the subject, but is determined [[Pragmatics|pragmatically]]. In all these cases, the whole sentence refers to the comment part&lt;ref&gt;Michael Gotze, Stephanie Dipper, and Stavros Skopeteas. 2007. Information Structure in Cross-Linguistic Corpora: Annotation Guidelines for Phonology, Morphology, Syntax, Semantics, and Information Structure. Interdisciplinary Studies on Information Structure (ISIS), Working papers of the SFB 632, Vol. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The relation between topic/theme and comment/rheme/focus should not be confused with the topic-comment relation in [[Rhetorical structure theory]] Discourse Treebank (RST-DT corpus) where it is defined as "a general statement or topic of discussion is introduced, after which a specific remark is made on the statement or topic" (ex. "[As far as the pound goes,] [some traders say a slide toward support at 1.5500 may be a favorable development for the dollar this week.]") &lt;ref&gt;L. Carlson and D. Marcu, “Discourse tagging reference manual,” ISI Technical Report ISI-TR-545, vol. 54, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;L. Ermakova and J. Mothe. 2016. Document re-ranking based on topic-comment structure. In X IEEE International Conference RCIS, Grenoble, France, June 1-3, 2016. 1–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Realization of topic–comment ==
Different languages mark topics in different ways. Distinct intonation and word-order are the most common means. The tendency to place topicalized constituents sentence-initially ("topic fronting") is widespread. Topic fronting refers to placing the topic at the beginning
of a clause regardless whether it is marked or not&lt;ref&gt;D. Bring, Topic and Comment. Cambridge University Press, 2011, three
entries for: Patrick Colm Hogan (ed.) The Cambridge Encyclopedia of
the Language Sciences. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Again, linguists disagree on many details. 

Languages often show different kinds of grammar for sentences that introduce new topics and those that continue discussing previously established topics. 

When a sentence continues discussing a previously established topic, it is likely to use pronouns to refer to the topic. Such topics tend to be subjects.  In many languages, pronouns referring to previously established topics will show [[pro-drop]].

=== In English ===
The topic/theme comes first in the clause, and is typically marked out by intonation as well.&lt;ref&gt;MAK Halliday (1994). ''An introduction to functional grammar'', 2nd ed., Hodder Arnold: London, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In other languages===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
* [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Korean language|Korean]]: the topic is normally marked with a [[postposition]] such as {{Nihongo||は|-wa}} or 는/은, ''-(n)eun''.
* In [[Côte d'Ivoire|Ivorian French]], the topic is marked by the postposition « là ». The topic can be a noun or a nominal group but not necessarily : « Voiture-là est jolie deh » ; « Aujourd'hui-là il fait chaud » ; « Pour toi-là n'est pas comme pour moi hein » ; « Nous qui sommes ici-là, on attend ça seulement ».
* So-called free-word order languages (e.g. Russian, [[Czech language|Czech]], to a certain extent [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[German language|German]]) use word-order as the primary means. Usually the topic precedes focus. However, for example in Czech, both orders are possible. The order with comment sentence-initial is referred as ''subjective'' ([[Vilém Mathesius]] invented the term and opposed it to ''objective'') and expresses certain emotional involvement.  The two orders are distinguished by intonation.
* In [[Hebrew language|modern Hebrew]], a topic may follow its comment. In this case, the syntactic subject of the sentence is an expletive זה ("ze", lit. "this"). For example, זה מאד מענין הספר הזה "ze meod meanyen ha-sefer ha-ze" (lit. "This is very interesting this book") means "This book is very interesting".
* In [[American Sign Language#Topic and main clauses|American Sign Language]], a topic can be declared at the beginning of a sentence (indicated by raised eyebrows and head tilt) describing the object, then the rest of the sentence describes what happens to that object.

== Practical applications ==
The main application of the topic-comment structure is in the domain of speech technology, especially the design of embodied conversational agents (intonational focus assignment, relation between information structure and posture and gesture)&lt;ref&gt;Cassell, Justine, ed. Embodied conversational agents. MIT press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;. There were some attempts to apply the theory of topic/comment for the information retrieval &lt;ref&gt;A. Bouchachia and R. Mittermeir, “A neural cascade architecture for
document retrieval,” in Neural Networks, 2003. Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on, vol. 3. IEEE, 2003, pp. 1915–1920.&lt;/ref&gt; and the automatic summarization &lt;ref&gt;L. Ermakova, J. Mothe, A. Firsov. A Metric for Sentence Ordering Assessment Based on Topic-Comment

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16398">'''Tourism carrying capacity'''  is a now antiquated approach to managing visitors in protected areas and national parks which evolved out of the fields of range, habitat and wildlife management. In these fields, managers attempted to determine the largest population of a particular species that could be supported by a habitat over a long period of time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jurassiccoast.com/downloads/WHS%20Management/purbeck_carrying_capacity_report.pdf Jurassic Coast]&lt;/ref&gt;  Many authors, such as Buckley, Wagar, Washburne, McCool, and Stankey have critiqued the concept as being fatally flawed in both the conceptual assumptions made and its limited practical application. For example, the notion of a carrying capacity assumes the world, such as the social-ecological systems in which protected areas and tourism destinations are situated, are stable. But we know they are dynamically complex and impossible to predict. We know that to implement a carrying capacity on a practical level, assumes a level of control of entries into a destination or protected area not usually found in the real world. We know that a carrying capacity, if one could be determined, requires considerable financial and technical resources to administer; and we know that when demand exceeds a limit, the ways in which scarce opportunities are allocated are contentious.

"Tourism Carrying Capacity" is defined by the [[World Tourism Organization]] as “The maximum number of people that may visit a tourist destination at the same time, without causing destruction of the physical, economic, socio-cultural environment and an unacceptable decrease in the quality of visitors' satisfaction”.   Whereas Middleton and Hawkins Chamberlain (1997) define it as “the level of human activity an area can accommodate without the area deteriorating, the resident community being adversely affected or the quality of visitors experience declining”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netcoast.nl/coastlearn/website/tourism/con_capacity.html Net Coast] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707214326/http://www.netcoast.nl/coastlearn/website/tourism/con_capacity.html |date=2007-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; what both these definitions pick up on is carrying capacity is the point at which a destination or attraction starts experiencing adverse as a result of the number of visitors.

Unfortunately, there are no studies which support this notion of visitor management. For example, in areas which have an objective of maintaining pristine conditions, any level of visitor use creates adverse or negative impacts, suggesting that the carrying capacity is zero. Fundamentally, acceptable conditions are a matter of human judgment, not an inherent quality of a particular site. Understanding these acceptable conditions is the focus of the limits of acceptable change planning process referred to later in this article.

There are number of different forms of carrying capacity referred to in tourism, however this article will focus on the four most commonly used. However, these conceptions are useful only to the extent they focus discussion and discourse, not practical application.

== Physical carrying capacity ==
This is the maximum number of tourists that an area is actually able to support. In the case of an individual tourist attraction it is the maximum number that can fit on the site at any given time and still allow people to be able to move. This is normally assumed to be around 1m per person.
“PCC per a day = area (in metres squared) x visitors per metre x daily duration"  (Mowforth and Munt)&lt;ref&gt;Mowforth, M. Munt, I. ''Tourism and sustainability; Development and new tourism in the third world'', Routledge, London&lt;/ref&gt;
This is a formula which has been used to calculate the physical carrying capacity.

== Economic carrying capacity ==
This relates to a level of acceptable change within the local economy of a tourist destination, it is the extent to which a tourist destination is able to accommodate tourist functions without the loss of local activities,&lt;ref&gt;Mathieson and Wall, 1982, ''Tourism; economic, physical and social impacts'', Longman, Harlow&lt;/ref&gt; take for example a souvenir store taking the place of a shop selling essential items to the local community. [[Economic carrying capacity]] can also be used to describe the point at which the increased revenue brought by tourism development is overtaken by the inflation caused by tourism.

== Social carrying capacity ==
This relates to the negative socio-cultural related to tourism development. The indicators of when the [[social carrying capacity]] has been exceeded are a reduced local tolerance for tourism as described by Doxey’s Index of irritation.&lt;ref&gt;G. Shaw, A Williams, 1997, ''Critical issues in tourism: a geographical perspective'', Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; Reduced visitor enjoyment and increased crime are also indicators of when the social carrying capacity has been exceeded.

== Biophysical carrying capacity ==
This deals with the extent to which the natural environment is able to tolerate interference from tourists. This is made more complicated by the fact that because it deals with ecology which is able to regenerate to some extent so in this case the carrying capacity is when the damage exceeds the habitat's ability to regenerate. 

Environmental carrying capacity is also used with reference to ecological and physical parameters, capacity of resources, ecosystems and infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;Mexa, A. Coccossis, H. 2004, ''Tourism carrying capacity assessment'', Ashgate&lt;/ref&gt;

== Weaknesses of carrying capacity ==
The main criticism of carrying capacity is that is fundamentally flawed conceptually and practically. Conceptually, the notion of an inherent carrying capacity assumes a stable and predictable world, a "J-shaped" curve in the relationship between use level and impact, and techno-scientific view of what are essential value judgments. On the practical level, it is difficult to calculate a maximum number of visitors because this is also dependent on other factors like the way in which the tourists behave ‘a large group of bird Watchers moving through a landscape will have a different impact compared to a similar sized group of school children.’&lt;ref&gt;Jurassic Coast.com&lt;/ref&gt;   In the case of natural heritage like  national parks, visitor impacts change with seasons. What is important is the acceptability or appropriateness of these impacts, an issue that is largely dependent on social and cultural value systems with science having an input.

UNESCO (the organization responsible for administrating the World Heritage list) has expressed a concern that the use of Carrying capacity can give the impression that a site is better protected than it actually is, it points out that although the whole site may be below carrying capacity part of the site may still be crowded.&lt;ref&gt;Pedersen A, ''Managing tourism at world heritage sites'', [[UNESCO]], Paris&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of tourism in wildlife sanctuaries Singh (2013) writes, ‘carrying capacity’ is a concept to be thought about when we intend for ‘sustainable versus full harvest/utilization of resource for a purpose’. In wildlife sanctuaries ‘full utilization of infrastructure or resource for tourism’ is a remote mandate, unthinkable. Hence, instead of ‘carrying capacity’ it is recommended to have a set of guidelines for regulating tourism without much disturbing the wildlife. That will perhaps be sustainable for both wildlife conservation and tourism industry.

== Limits of Acceptable Change ==
Limits of acceptable change was the first of the post carrying capacity visitor management frameworks developed to respond to the practical and conceptual failures of carrying capacity. The framework was developed by The U.S. forest service in the 1980s. It is based on the idea that rather than there being a threshold of visitor numbers, in fact any tourist activity is having an impact and therefore management should be based on constant monitoring of the site as well as the objectives established for it. It is possible that with in the Limit of acceptable change framework a visitor limit can be established but such limits are only one tool available. The framework is frequently summarised in to a nine step process.&lt;ref&gt;List from [http://www.jurassiccoast.com/downloads/WHS%20Management/purbeck_carrying_capacity_report.pdf Jurassic Coast]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Identify area concerns and issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Define and describe opportunity classes (based on the concept of ROS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Select indicators of resource and social conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Inventory existing resource and social conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Specify standards for resource and social indicators for each opportunity class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Identify alternative opportunity class allocations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Identify management actions for each alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. Evaluate and select preferred alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. Implement actions and monitor conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Jurassic Coast.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The reader should note however, that there is a difference of LAC as a concept and LAC as a planning framework{{elucidate|date=April 2013}}.

== Visitor Experience and Resource Protection ==
This framework is based on the idea that not enough attention has been given to the experience of tourists and their views on environmental quality. This framework is similar in origin to LAC, but was originally designed to meet the legislative, policy and administrative needs of the US National Park Service.

==Descriptive and evaluative==
The process of estimating Tourism Carrying Capacity (TCC) has been described as having a descriptive and evaluative part. It follows (in principle) the conceptual framework for TCC as described by Shelby and Heberlein (1986), and these parts are described as follows:

Descriptive part (A): Describes how the system (tourist destination) under study works, including physical, ecological, social, political and economic aspects of tourist development. Within this context of particular importance is the identification of:
* Constraints: limiting factors that cannot be easily managed. They are inflexible, in the sense that the application of organisational, planning, and management approaches, or the development of appropriate infrastructure does not alter the thresholds associated with such constraints.
* [[Bottleneck (production)|Bottlenecks]]: limiting factors of the system which managers can manipulate (number of visitors at a particular place).
* Impacts: elements of the system affected by the intensity and type of use. The type of impact determines the type of capacity (ecological-physical, social, etc.). Emphasis should be placed on significant impacts.

Evaluative part (B): Describes how an area should be managed and the level of acceptable environmental impacts. This part of the process starts with the identification (if it does not already exist) of the desirable condition or preferable type of development. Within this context, goals and management objectives need to be defined, alternative fields of actions evaluated and a strategy for tourist development formulated. On the basis of this, Tourism Carrying Capacity can be defined. Within this context, of particular importance is the identification of:
* Goals and/or objectives: (i.e. to define the type of experience or other outcomes which a recreational setting should provide).

===Differing definitions===

First of all, the carrying capacity can be the motivation to attract tourists visit the destination. The tourism industry, especially in national parks and protected areas, is subject to the concept of carrying capacity so as to determine the scale of tourist activities which can be sustained at specific times in different places. Various scholar over the years have developed several arguments developed about the definition of carrying capacity. Middleton and Hawkins defined carrying capacity as a measure of the tolerance of a site or building which is open to tourist activities, and the limit beyond which an area may suffer from the adverse impacts of tourism (Middleton &amp; Hawkins, 1998). Chamberlain defined it as the level of human activity which an area can accommodate without either it deteriorating, the resident community being adversely affected or the quality of visitors' experience declining (Chamberlain, 1997).  Clark defined carrying capacity as a certain threshold (level) of tourism activity, beyond which there will be damage to the environment and its natural inhabitants (Clark, 1997).

The [[World Tourism Organization]] argues that carrying capacity is the maximum number of people who may visit a tourist destination at the same time, without causing destruction of the physical, economic and socio-cultural environment and/or an unacceptable decrease in the quality of visitors' satisfaction (http://ec.europa.eu/environment/iczm/pdf/tcca_material.pdf. Date assessed 08/03/07).    In the publication, ‘Agenda 21 for the Travel and Tourism Venture: towards environmentally sustainable development’, the Secretary-General of the World Tourism Organization.

==As part of a planning system==
The definitions of carrying capacity need to be considered as processes within a planning process for tourism development which involves:
* Setting capacity limits for sustaining tourism activities in an area. This involves a vision about local development &amp; decisions about managing tourism.
* Overall measuring of tourism carrying capacity does not have to lead to a single number, like the number of visitors (http://ec.europa.eu/environment/iczm/pdf/tcca_material.pdf. Date assessed 08/03/07).
* In addition, carrying capacity may contain various limits in respect to the three components (physical-ecological, socio-demographic and political–economic).

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“Carrying capacity is not just a scientific concept or formula of obtaining a number beyond which development should cease, but a process where the eventual limits must be considered as guidance. They should be carefully assessed and monitored, complemented with other standards, etc. Carrying capacity is not fixed. It develops with time and the growth of tourism and can be affected by management techniques and controls” (Saveriades, 2000).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The reason for considering carrying capacity as a process, rather than a means of protection of various areas is in spite of the fact that carrying capacity was once a guiding concept in recreation and tourism management literature. Because of its conceptual elusiveness, lack of management utility and inconsistent effectiveness in minimising visitors' impacts, carrying capacity has been largely re-conceptualized into management by objectives approaches, namely: the limits of acceptable change (LAC), and the visitor experience and resource protection (VERP) as the two planning and management decision-making processes based on the new understanding of carrying capacity (Lindberg and McCool, 1998). These two have been deemed more appropriate in the tourism planning processes of protected areas, especially in the United States, and have over the years been adapted and modified for use in [[sustainable tourism]] and ecotourism contexts (Wallace, 1993; McCool, 1994; Harroun and Boo, 1995).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2340">A '''wapenshaw''', or ''wapinshaw'', (from the [[Old English language|Old English]] for "weapon show") was originally a gathering and review of troops formerly held in every district in [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Wapenshaw |volume=28 |page=304 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldglasgowpubs.co.uk/hielanjessie.html reference to wapinshaw at barracks in Glasgow]&lt;/ref&gt; The object was to satisfy the military chiefs that the arms of their retainers were in good condition&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; and that the men were properly trained in their use.

==Use of 'Wapenshaw' in Lawn Bowls==
The term is still in use, to describe some competitions by [[Bowls|bowling clubs]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://prestwickhowiebowlingclub.co.uk/2016/05/10/open-wappenshaw/ notice of wappenshaw competition at Prestwick Howie bowling club]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gourockpark.homestead.com/Localbowlsinfo.html report of Wapinshaw competition at Gourock Park bowling club]&lt;/ref&gt; in Scotland.

==Use of 'Wapenshaw' in Shooting==
''Wapenshaw'' is also occasionally used, in Scotland and elsewhere in the [[United Kingdom]] for rifle or other gun shows, particularly those involving historic weapons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jointservicespistolclub.com/?page_id=446 Report on Aberdeen shooting club Wapinshaw, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://galleryrifle.com/?s=wapinshaw Results of the Aberdeen Wapinshaw, 2013-2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Woodcraft Folk==
''Wapenshaw'' is also widely used in the [[Woodcraft Folk]] to describe a daily ceremony when [[camping]], which involves each camper removing all belongings from their tent and laying them out on a groundsheet in a fixed order. This serves two purposes: to air out the tent, and to ensure that no items have been lost.

'''''Winter-Telling Stories''''' is a collection of [[Kiowa]] tales written by [[Alice Marriott]] and illustrated by [[Roland Whitehorse]].

Marriott relates a number of stories told her by George Hunt. The stories all relate to Saynday, the main character in the book, and his involvement with natural events on the southern plains. The title comes from Hunt's admonition to "always tell my stories in the winter, when the outdoors work is finished."

'''''Winter: Five Windows on the Season''''' is a non-fiction book written by [[Adam Gopnik]] for the 2011 [[Massey Lectures]]. Each of the book's five chapters had been delivered as a one-hour lecture discussing artistic portrayals of winter: its impact on culture and societies, polar exploration, and winter recreation. Each lecture was held in a different Canadian city: [[Montreal]] on October 12, [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] on October 14, [[Edmonton]] on October 21, [[Vancouver]] on October 23, and ending in [[Toronto]] on October 26. The book was published by [[House of Anansi Press]] while the lectures were broadcast on [[CBC Radio One]]'s ''[[Ideas (radio show)|Ideas]]'' between November 7–11.

While Gopnik was raised in [[Montreal]], by 2011 he worked as a staff writer for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine in New York City. Gopnik selected 'winter' as his general topic and spent nearly a year preparing for the lectures.

==Background==
[[Adam Gopnik]] was selected to deliver the 2011 [[Massey Lectures]], the annual week-long series of lectures on a political, cultural or philosophical topic given in Canada by a noted scholar. Gopnik was chosen by the panel of representatives from [[Massey College]], [[House of Anansi Press]] and the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]], the organizations responsible for coordinating the lectures. This would be the 50th anniversary of the Massey Lectures and coincide with the 75th anniversary of the CBC.&lt;ref name=CBC/&gt; ''[[Ideas (radio show)|Ideas]]'' executive producer Bernie Lucht contacted Gopnik by email to inform him of the panel's decision and to ask if he would accept.&lt;ref name=OttawaCitizen&gt;{{cite news |title=A window on winter; Author Adam Gopnik explores season of snow for Massey Lectures |first= Mark |last=Medley |date=October 12, 2011 |newspaper= [[Ottawa Citizen]] |page=E7}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time Gopnik was living in [[New York City]], working as a staff writer for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine. He had previously authored several books on different topics, the most successful being ''[[Paris to the Moon]]'', a collection of essays published in 2000. Gopnik read Lucht's email while waiting for a bus on [[Madison Avenue]]. Gopnik later stated that by the end of the 20-minute bus ride he had already selected a topic and had a good idea of the issues he would address.&lt;ref name=OttawaCitizen/&gt;

Understanding the Massey Lectures were part of the Canadian culture, Gopnik, who was born in [[Philadelphia]] but lived in [[Montreal]] between the ages of 10 to 25, wanted a topic that would be relevant to Canadians but also have universal appeal: winter. Winter had appeared as a theme or setting in many of his previous writings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/books/adam-gopnik-on-the-central-sustaining-metaphor-of-the-nation/article2194476/ |title= Adam Gopnik on the 'central sustaining metaphor of the nation' |first= John |last=Barber |date=October 7, 2011 |newspaper= [[The Globe and Mail]] |accessdate= November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he especially looked forward to talking about ice hockey. Gopnik spent the next year researching and writing the book, alongside another non-fiction book he was working on at the time: ''The Table Comes First: Family, France, and the Meaning of Food''. This other book was released shortly after ''Winter'', and purposefully contained one identical sentence.&lt;ref name=OttawaCitizen/&gt;

==Content==
{{quote box | width = 27em | quote = Winter's persona changes with our perception of safety from it – the glass of the window, as I sensed in that November snowstorm, is the lens through which modern winter is always seen. The romance of winter is possible only when we have a warm, secure indoors to retreat to, and winter becomes a season to look at as much as one to live through. | source = —Adam Gopnik, ''Winter'', p. 4}}

There are five chapters, each of which consider a different aspect of winter. The first chapter, "Romantic Winter", describes how winter has been portrayed since the 1700s from the point of view of artists and writers. According to Gopnik, the view of winter has changed over time, from something that had to be overcome to something romanticized as [[hearth]]s, glass windows, and coal heating made the cold more tolerable. Other factors, such as nationalism, religion, technology, also changed the social view of winter from being portrayed as "bleak and bitter to sweet and sublime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Winter: Five Windows on the Season |last=Gopnik |first=Adam| publisher= [[House of Anansi Press]] |page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second chapter, "Radical Winter", recounts the history of polar expeditions, including [[John Ross (Arctic explorer)|John Ross]], [[John Franklin]], [[Robert Peary]], [[Robert Falcon Scott]], [[Roald Amundsen]], and [[Ernest Shackleton]].

"Recuperative Winter" reviews the cultural and social history of winter festivals and holidays. Gopnik posits that the modern Christmas is a compound holiday merging elements from numerous societies, traditions, and beliefs; that its moral foundations were established in the 1820/30s; its celebratory and commercialism elements were established in the 1870s. He also argues that stress and anxiety have been part of the holiday since the 1920s. "Recreational Winter" is about winter sports, like ice hockey. The evolution of ice skating is identified from the Dutch bringing the concept to England in the 1600s and the origin of hockey is traced back to a particular neighbourhood in Montreal in the 1800s. He portrays winter sports as being more about preparation and the pleasure of solitude, in contrast with summer sports, which are more about impulse. The final chapter, "Remembering Winter", discusses three ways that the human experience of winter is changing: through technological and architectural innovations, via global warming, and by memory.

==Style and themes==
The chapters are written so that they could be read as [[lectures]]. Though several reviewers referred to them as [[essay]]s, Gopnik made the distinction between an essay, which is written to be read silently, and a lecture, which is meant to be spoken and keeps some of the rhythm of speech.&lt;ref name=Montreal/&gt; Gopnik purposefully tried "to keep them as conversational as possible [and so] they lack the polish of his ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' essays".&lt;ref name=OttawaCitizen/&gt; The lectures' conversational tone, with both common and arcane references, was meant to appeal to a "[[middlebrow]]" audience; they were designed to be "profound and significant" but not academic.&lt;ref name=OttawaCitizen/&gt; The reviewer in ''[[The Observer]]'' described the writing as "designed to maintain a constant flame of curiosity in a lecture room shut against the cold".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Since there's no place to go... Adam Gopnik's love letter to the snowy season makes a perfect fireside companion, says Tim Adams |first=Tim |last=Adams |newspaper=[[The Observer]] |location=[[London]] |date=November 18, 2012 |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was called an "[[elegy]] for a season".&lt;ref name=CBC/&gt; Encyclopedist [[James Harley Marsh]] believes that the central theme was, as Gopnik himself writes, that "winter started as this thing we had to get through; it has ended as this time to hold on to".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |series= Culture: In Search of Lost Time, |title=Adam Gopnik's "Winter" |first= James |last=Marsh |date=October 31, 2011 |authorlink= James Harley Marsh |publisher= [[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |accessdate= November 14, 2011 |url= http://blog.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/blog/posts/adam-gopnik%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cwinter%E2%80%9D/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Edmonton Journal]]'' reviewer describes Gopnik's guiding [[metaphor]] for his approach to winter as "ice wine: sweetness made from stress", that the perceived benefits of winter come directly from the hardships it brings.&lt;ref name=Edmonton&gt;{{cite news |title=Massey Lecture series on winter blows into town; Essayist Adam Gopnik explores Canada's connection with the season |first= Todd |last=Babiak |date=October 12, 2011 |newspaper= [[Edmonton Journal]] |page=A5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian McGillis in the ''Montreal Review of Books'' identifies "two simple ideas that govern and unite the five lectures": first, that the view from inside can provide a better developed idea of what is outside, and second, that winter continues to defy the human need to consistently name and organize the world.&lt;ref name=Montreal&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.aelaq.org/mrb/feature.php?issue=34&amp;article=990&amp;cat=1 |title= Sometimes you can go home again |first= Ian |last=McGillis |date=Fall 2011 |journal= Montreal Review of Books |issue=1 |volume=15 |accessdate=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication and reception==
The book was published by [[House of Anansi Press]] and released on September 26, 2011. The five chapters/lectures were delivered by Gopnik in five locations across Canada: the first chapter was delivered in [[Montreal]] on October 12, the second in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] ([[Dalhousie Arts Centre]]) on October 14, the third in [[Edmonton]] ([[University of Alberta]]) on October 21, the fourth in [[Vancouver]] ([[Chan Centre for the Performing Arts]]) on October 23, and the final chapter in [[The Royal Conservatory of Music]] at the [[University of Toronto]] on October 26. Gopnik was in Guelph on October 25 where he recited passages and promoted the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.theontarion.com/2011/10/satellite-massey-lecture-visits-guelph/ |title= Satellite Massey Lecture visits Guelph |first= Tom |last=Beedham |date=October 27, 2011 |newspaper= The Ontarion |accessdate= November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An excerpt was published in the October 3 edition of ''[[Maclean's]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Why Hockey is the Smartest Game in the World |first= Brian |last=Bethune |date=Fall 2011 |journal= [[Maclean's]] |issue=124 |volume=38 |pages=46–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was published in the United Kingdom, in November 2012, by [[Quercus (publisher)|Quercus]], a London-based independent publishing house. The review in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' concluded that "while there are flashes of brilliance here, there's also a nagging sense that he's snatching at snowflakes. Time and time again one comes across statements that look, and sound good - these pieces were originally delivered as lectures - but which just don't stand up to analysis."&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news |title=Snatched snowflakes: John Preston finds a fondness for winter a little too extreme |first=John |last=Preston |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=[[London]] |date=November 10, 2012 |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewer cited examples, like the illustrations of the theatrics people display when coming in from the cold and the isolated feelings of downhill skiers which the reviewer rebutted with similar examples of the same that occur in temperate climates.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; Nick Rennison reviewed the book for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', writing that "any writer who can take subjects as diverse as [these]....and find something original and interesting to say about each of them, has to be worth reading."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The big chills |first=Nick |last=Rennison |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]] |location=[[London]] |date=November 18, 2012 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women's history''' is the study of the role that [[Woman|women]] have played in history and [[Historiography|the methods required]] to do so. It includes the study of the history of the growth of [[woman's rights]] throughout [[recorded history]], personal achievement over a period of time, the examination of individual and groups of women of historical significance, and the effect that historical events have had on women.  Inherent in the study of women's history is the belief that more traditional recordings of history have minimized or ignored the contributions of women to different fields and the effect that historical events had on women as a whole; in this respect, women's history is often a form of [[historical revisionism]], seeking to challenge or expand the traditional historical consensus.

The main centers of scholarship have been the United States and Britain, where [[Second-wave feminism|second-wave feminist]] historians, influenced by the new approaches promoted by [[social history]], led the way. As activists in [[women's liberation]], discussing and analyzing the oppression and inequalities they experienced as women, they believed it imperative to learn about the lives of their fore mothers—and found very little scholarship in print. History was written mainly by men and about men's activities in the public sphere especially in Africa—war, politics, diplomacy and administration. Women are usually excluded and, when mentioned, are usually portrayed in sex-stereotypical roles such as wives, mothers, daughters, and mistresses. The study of history is [[value-laden]] in regard to what is considered historically "worthy."&lt;ref&gt;[[June Purvis]], "Women's History Today," ''[[History Today]],'' Nov 2004, Vol. 54 Issue 11, pp. 40–42&lt;/ref&gt; Other aspects of this area of study is the differences in women's lives caused by race, economic status, social status, and various other aspects of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Major Problems in American Women's History|last = Norton, Alexander, Block|first = Mary Beth, Ruth M., Sharon|publisher = CENGAGE Learning|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-133-95599-3|location = Stanford, Connecticut|page = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
Changes came in the 19th and 20th centuries; for example, for women, the right to equal pay is now enshrined in law. Women traditionally ran the household, bore and reared the children, were nurses, mothers, wives, neighbours, friends, and teachers. During periods of war, women were drafted into the labor market to undertake work that had been traditionally restricted to men. Following the wars, they invariably lost their jobs in industry and had to return to domestic and service roles.&lt;ref&gt;Jutta Schwarzkopf, "Women's History: Europe" in {{cite book|author=Kelly Boyd, ed.|title=Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing, vol 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0121vD9STIMC&amp;pg=PA1316|year=1999|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|pages=1316–18|isbn=9781884964336}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen Offen, Ruth Roach Pierson, and Jane Rendall, eds.

Offen, ''European feminisms, 1700-1950: a political history'' (2000) [http://hdl.handle.net/2027/heb.04531.0001.001 onine]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Britain===
{{main|History of women in the United Kingdom}}
The history of Scottish women in the late 19th century and early 20th century was not fully developed as a field of study until the 1980s. In addition, most work on women before 1700 has been published since 1980. Several studies have taken a biographical approach, but other work has drawn on the insights from research elsewhere to examine such issues as work, family, religion, crime, and images of women. Scholars are also uncovering women's voices in their letters, memoirs, poetry, and court records. Because of the late development of the field, much recent work has been recuperative, but increasingly the insights of gender history, both in other countries and in Scottish history after 1700, are being used to frame the questions that are asked. Future work should contribute both to a reinterpretation of the current narratives of Scottish history and also to a deepening of the complexity of the history of women in late medieval and early modern Britain and Europe.

===France===
{{further|Women in the French Revolution}}
French historians have taken a unique approach: there has been an extensive scholarship in women's and gender history despite the lack of women's and gender study programs or departments at the university level. But approaches used by other academics in the research of broadly based social histories have been applied to the field of women's history as well. The high level of research and publication in women's and gender history is due to the high interest within French society. The structural discrimination in academia against the subject of gender history in France is changing due to the increase in international studies following the formation of the European Union, and more French scholars seeking appointments outside Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Thébaud, "Writing Women's and Gender History in France: A National Narrative?"

===Germany===
{{main|History of German women|Women in Germany|Feminism in Germany|History of Germany}}
Before the 19th century, young women lived under the economic and disciplinary authority of their fathers until they married and passed under the control of their husbands. In order to secure a satisfactory marriage, a woman needed to bring a substantial dowry. In the wealthier families, daughters received their dowry from their families, whereas the poorer women needed to work in order to save their wages so as to improve their chances to wed. Under the German laws, women had property rights over their dowries and inheritances, a valuable benefit as high mortality rates resulted in successive marriages. Before 1789, the majority of women lived confined to society's private sphere, the home.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth-Ellen B. Joeres and Mary Jo Maynes, ''German women in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries: a social and literary history'' (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Age of Reason did not bring much more for women: men, including Enlightenment aficionados, believed that women were naturally destined to be principally wives and mothers. Within the educated classes, there was the belief that women needed to be sufficiently educated to be intelligent and agreeable interlocutors to their husbands. However, the lower-class women were expected to be economically productive in order to help their husbands make ends meet.&lt;ref name="William W. Hagen 2012"&gt;William W. Hagen, ''German History in Modern Times'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the newly founded German State (1871), women of all social classes were politically and socially disenfranchised.  The code of social respectability confined upper class and bourgeois women to their homes. They were considered socially and economically inferior to their husbands. The unmarried women were ridiculed, and the ones who wanted to avoid social descent could work as unpaid housekeepers living with relatives; the ablest could work as governesses or they could become nuns.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Fout, ed. ''German Women in the Nineteenth Century''&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant number of middle-class families became impoverished between 1871 and 1890 as the pace of industrial growth was uncertain, and women had to earn money in secret by sewing or embroidery to contribute to the family income.&lt;ref name=" William W. Hagen 2012"/&gt;
In 1865, the Allgemeiner Deutscher Frauenverein (ADF) was founded as an umbrella organization for women's associations, demanding rights to education, employment, and political participation. Three decades later, the Bund Deutscher Frauenverbände (BDF) replaced ADF and excluded from membership the proletarian movement that was part of the earlier group. The two movements had differing views concerning women's place in society, and accordingly, they also had different agendas. The bourgeois movement made important contributions to the access of women to education and employment (mainly office-based and teaching). The proletarian movement, on the other hand, developed as a branch of the Social Democratic Party. As factory jobs became available for women, they campaigned for equal pay and equal treatment. In 1908 German women won the right to join political parties, and in 1918 they were finally granted the right to vote. The emancipation of women in Germany was to be challenged in following years.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Kolinsky and Wilfried van der Will, ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern German Culture'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have paid special attention to the efforts by Nazi Germany to reverse the political and social gains that women made before 1933, especially in the relatively liberal [[Weimar Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Renate Bridenthal, Atina Grossmann, and Marion Kaplan, ''When Biology Became Destiny: Women in Weimar and Nazi Germany'' (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;  The role of women in Nazi Germany changed according to circumstances.  Theoretically, the Nazis believed that women must be subservient to men, avoid careers, devote themselves to childbearing and child-rearing, and be helpmates to the traditional dominant fathers in the traditional family.&lt;ref&gt;Jill Stephenson, ''Women in Nazi Germany'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; But, before 1933, women played important roles in the Nazi organization and were allowed some autonomy to mobilize other women. After Hitler came to power in 1933, the activist women were replaced by bureaucratic women, who emphasized feminine virtues, marriage, and childbirth.

As Germany prepared for war, large numbers of women were incorporated into the public sector and, with the need for full mobilization of factories by 1943, all women were required to register with the employment office. Hundreds of thousands of women served in the military as nurses and support personnel, and another hundred thousand served in the [[Luftwaffe]], especially helping to operate the anti-aircraft systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=D'Ann |last=Campbell |title=Women in Combat: The World War Two Experience in the United States, Great Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union |publisher=Journal of Military History (April 1993), 57:301–323 |url=http://americanhistoryprojects.com/downloads/ww2/combat.pdf |format=PDF}} (online edition)&lt;/ref&gt; Women's wages remained unequal and women were denied positions of leadership or control.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Koonz, ''Mothers in the Fatherland: Women, the Family and Nazi Politics'' (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

More than two million women were murdered in the Holocaust. The Nazi ideology viewed women generally as agents of fertility. Accordingly, it identified the Jewish woman as an element to be exterminated to prevent the rise of future generations. For these reasons, the Nazis treated women as prime targets for annihilation in the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.yadvashem.org/yv/en/exhibitions/spots_of_light/index.asp?WT.mc_id=wiki |title=Spots of Light: Women in the Holocaust |publisher= online exhibition, [[Yad Vashem]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Europe===
Interest in the study of women's history in Eastern Europe has been delayed.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Corrin, ''Superwomen and the double burden: women's experience of change in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union'' (Scarlet Press, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maria Bucor, "An Archipelago of Stories: Gender History in Eastern Europe," ''American Historical Review,'' (2008) 113#5, pp. 1375–1389&lt;/ref&gt; Representative is Hungary, where the historiography has been explored by Petö and Szapor (2007). Academia resisted incorporating this specialized field of history, primarily because of the political atmosphere and a lack of institutional support. Before 1945, historiography dealt chiefly with nationalist themes that supported the anti-democratic political agenda of the state. After 1945, academia reflected a Soviet model. Instead of providing an atmosphere in which women could be the subjects of history, this era ignored the role of the women's rights movement in the early 20th century. The collapse of Communism in 1989 was followed by a decade of promising developments in which biographies of prominent Hungarian women were published, and important moments of women's political and cultural history were the subjects of research. However, the quality of this scholarship was uneven and failed to take advantage of the methodological advances in research in the West. In addition, institutional resistance continued, as evidenced by the lack of undergraduate or graduate programs dedicated to women's and gender history at Hungarian universities.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Petö and Judith Szapor, "The State of Women's and Gender History in Eastern Europe: The Case of Hungary," ''Journal of Women's History,'' (2007) 19#1 pp. 160–166&lt;/ref&gt;

====Russia====
{{main|Feminism in Russia}}
Women's history in Russia started to become important in the Czarist era, and concern was shown in the consciousness and writing of [[Alexander Pushkin]]. During the Soviet Era, feminism was developed along with ideals of equality, but in practice and in domestic arrangements, men often dominate.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Evans Clements, ''A History of Women in Russia: From Earliest Times to the Present'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Natalia Pushkareva, ''Women in Russian History: From the Tenth to the Twentieth Century'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1990s new periodicals, especially ''Casus'' and ''Odysseus: Dialogue with Time, Adam and Eve'' stimulated women's history and, more recently, gender history. Using the concept of gender has shifted the focus from women to socially and culturally constructed notions of sexual difference. It has led to deeper debates on historiography and holds a promise of stimulating the development of a new "general" history able to integrate personal, local, social, and cultural history.&lt;ref&gt;Lorina Repina, "Gender studies in Russian historiography in the nineteen‐nineties and early twenty‐first century." ''Historical Research'' 79.204 (2006): 270-286.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linda Edmondson, ''Gender in Russian History &amp; Culture'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

====China====
Published work generally deals with women as visible participants in the revolution, employment as vehicles for women's liberation, Confucianism and the cultural concept of family as sources of women's oppression. While rural marriage rituals, such as bride price and dowry, have remained the same in form, their function has changed. This reflects the decline of the extended family and the growth in women's agency in the marriage transaction.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Hershatter, ''Women in China's Long Twentieth Century'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; In recent scholarship in China, the concept of gender has yielded a bounty of new knowledge in English- and Chinese-language writings.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Hershatter, and Zheng Wang, "Chinese History: A Useful Category of Gender Analysis," ''American Historical Review,'' Dec 2008, Vol. 113 Issue 5, pp 1404-1421&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shou Wang “The ‘New Social History’ in China: The Development of Women’s History.” ''The History Teacher'' (2006). 39#3: 315–323&lt;/ref&gt;

''Zhongguo fu nü sheng Huo shi'' ({{zh|s=中国妇女生活史|t=中國婦女生活史|p=Zhōngguó Fùnǚ Shēnghuó Shǐ|l=Chinese Women's Life History}}) is a historical book written by Chen Dongyuan in 1928 and published by The Commercial Press in 1937. The book, the first to give a systematic introduction to women's history in China, has strongly influenced further research in this field.&lt;ref&gt;[[:zh:中國婦女生活史]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book sheds a light on [[Women in ancient and imperial China#Ancient China|Chinese women's life ranging from ancient times]] (prior to [[Zhou Dynasty]]) to the [[Republic of China]]. In the book, sections are separated based on dynasties in China. Sections are divided into segments to introduce different themes, such as marriage, feudal ethical codes, education for women, virtues, positions, the concept of chastity, foot-binding and women's rights movement in modern China. Inspired by the anti-traditional thoughts in [[New Culture Movement]], the author devoted much effort to disclosing and denouncing the unfairness and suppression in culture, institutions, and life that victimize women in China. According to the book, women's conditions are slightly improved until modern China. in the Preface of the book, the author writes: since women in China are always subject to abuse, the history of women is, naturally the history of abuse of women in China. The author revealed the motivation: the book intends to explain how the [[Women in ancient and imperial China|principle of women being inferior to men]] evolves; how the abuse to women is intensified over time; and how the misery on women's back experience the history change. The author wants to promote women's liberation by revealing the political and social suppression of women.

Mann (2009) explores how Chinese biographers have depicted women over two millennia (221 BCE to 1911), especially during the [[Han dynasty]]. Zhang Xuecheng, Sima Qian, and Zhang Huiyan and other writers often study women of the governing class, and their representation in domestic scenes of death in the narratives and in the role of [[martyrs]].&lt;ref&gt;Susan Mann, "Scene-Setting: Writing Biography in Chinese History," '' American Historical Review,'' June 2009, Vol. 114 Issue 3, pp 631-639&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Tibet=====
The historiography of women in the history of Tibet confronts the suppression of women's histories in the social narratives of an exiled community. McGranahan (2010) examines the role of women in the 20th century, especially during the Chinese invasion and [[Chinese occupation of Tibet|occupation of Tibet]]. She studies women in the Tibetan resistance army, the subordination of women in a Buddhist society, and the persistent concept of menstrual blood as a contaminating agent.&lt;ref&gt;Carole McGranahan, "Narrative Dispossession: Tibet and the Gendered Logics of Historical Possibility," ''Comparative Studies in Society and History,'' Oct 2010, Vol. 52 Issue 4, pp. 768–797&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese women's history was marginal to historical scholarship until the late 20th century. The subject hardly existed before 1945, and, even after that date, many academic historians were reluctant to accept women's history as a part of Japanese history. The social and political climate of the 1980s in particular, favorable in many ways to women, gave opportunities for Japanese women's historiography and also brought the subject fuller academic recognition. Exciting and innovative research on Japanese women's history began in the 1980s. Much of this has been conducted not only by academic women's historians, but also by freelance writers, journalists, and amateur historians; that is, by people who have been less restricted by traditional historical methods and expectations. The study of Japanese women's history has become accepted as part of the traditional topics.&lt;ref&gt;Hiroko Tomida, "The Evolution Of Japanese Women's Historiography," ''Japan Forum,'' July 1996, Vol. 8 Issue 2, pp 189-203&lt;/ref&gt;

A pioneering study was [[Patricia Grimshaw]], ''Women's Suffrage in New Zealand'' (1972), explaining how that remote colony became the first country in the world to give women the vote. Women's history as an academic discipline emerged in the mid-1970s, typified by [[Miriam Dixson]], ''The Real Matilda: Woman and Identity in Australia, 1788 to the Present'' (1976). The first studies were compensatory, filling in the vacuum where women had been left out. In common with developments in the United States and Britain, there was a movement toward gender studies, with a field dominated by feminists.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Dann, ''Up from under women and liberation in New Zealand, 1970–1985'' (Bridget Williams Books, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
{{Main|History of women in the United States}}

Apart from individual women, working largely on their own, the first organized systematic efforts to develop women's history came from the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) in the early 20th century. It coordinated efforts across the South to tell the story of the women on the Confederate home front, while the male historians spent their time with battles and generals. The women emphasized female activism, initiative, and leadership. They reported that when all the men left for war, the women took command, found ersatz and substitute foods, rediscovered their old traditional skills with the spinning wheel when factory cloth became unavailable, and ran all the farm or plantation operations. They faced danger without having menfolk in the traditional role of their protectors.&lt;ref&gt;Gaines M. Foster, ''Ghosts of the Confederacy: Defeat, the Lost Cause and the Emergence of the New South, 1865-1913'' (1985) p 30&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Jacquelyn Dowd Hall]] argue that the UDC was a powerful promoter of women's history:
{{quote|UDC leaders were determined to assert women's cultural authority over virtually every representation of the region's past. This they did by lobbying for state archives and museums, national historic sites, and historic highways; compiling genealogies; interviewing former soldiers; writing history textbooks; and erecting monuments, which now moved triumphantly from cemeteries into town centers. More than half a century before women's history and public history emerged as fields of inquiry and action, the UDC, with other women's associations, strove to etch women's accomplishments into the historical record and to take history to the people, from the nursery and the fireside to the schoolhouse and the public square.&lt;ref&gt;Jacquelyn Dowd Hall, "'You must remember this': Autobiography as social critique." ''Journal of American History'' (1998): 439–465 at p 450. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2567747 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The work of women scholars was ignored by the male-dominated history profession until the 1960s, when the first breakthroughs came.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie G. Smith, "Women's History: A Retrospective from the United States," ''Signs: Journal of Women in Culture &amp; Society,'' Spring 2010, Vol. 35 Issue 3, pp 723-747&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerda Lerner]] in 1963 offered the first regular college course in women's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Debra Taczanowsky |url=http://www.tribdem.com/opinion/editorials/debra-taczanowsky-women-making-inroads-but-still-fighting-for-equality/article_1b89971a-a842-554c-8ba8-ff4f518e5f38.html |title=Debra Taczanowsky &amp;#124; Women making inroads, but still fighting for equality - The Tribune-Democrat: Editorials |publisher=Tribdem.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field of women's history exploded dramatically after 1970, along with the growth of the new [[social history]] and the acceptance of women into graduate programs in history departments. In 1972, [[Sarah Lawrence College]] began offering a Master of Arts Program in Women's History, founded by Gerda Lerner, that was the first American graduate degree in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sarahlawrence.edu/womens-history/ |title=Master of Arts in Women's History &amp;#124; Sarah Lawrence College |publisher=Sarahlawrence.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important development was to integrate women into the history of race and slavery. A pioneering effort was [[Deborah Gray White]]'s '''Ar'n't I a Woman? Female Slaves in the Plantation South'' (1985), which helped to open up analysis of race, slavery, abolitionism, and feminism, as well as resistance, power, and activism, and themes of violence, sexualities, and the body.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Millward, "More History Than Myth: African American Women's History Since the Publication of 'Ar'n't I a Woman?'"

&lt;!--Needs some text here--&gt;

===Pre-revolution===
In the [[Ancien Régime in France]], few women held any formal power; some queens did, as did the heads of Catholic convents. In the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the writings of philosopher [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] provided a political program for reform of the ancien régime, founded on a reform of domestic mores. Rousseau's conception of the relations between private and public spheres is more unified than that found in modern sociology. Rousseau argued that the domestic role of women is a structural precondition for a "modern" society.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer J. Popiel, "Making Mothers: The Advice Genre and the Domestic Ideal, 1760-1830", ''Journal of Family History'' 2004 29(4): 339–350&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Salic law]] prohibited women from rule; however, the laws for the case of a [[regency]], when the king was too young to govern by himself, brought the queen into the centre of power. The queen could ensure the passage of power from one king to another—from her late husband to her young son—while simultaneously assuring the continuity of the dynasty.

===Education for girls===
Educational aspirations were on the rise and were becoming increasingly institutionalized in order to supply the church and state with the functionaries to serve as their future administrators.  Girls were schooled too, but not to assume political responsibility. Girls were ineligible for leadership positions and were generally considered to have an inferior intellect to their brothers. France had many small local schools where working-class children - both boys and girls - learned to read, the better "to know, love, and serve God." The sons and daughters of the noble and bourgeois elites were given gender-specific educations: boys were sent to upper school, perhaps a university, while their sisters - if they were lucky enough to leave the house - would be sent to board at a convent with a vague curriculum. The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] challenged this model, but no real alternative was presented for female education. Only through education at home were knowledgeable women formed, usually to the sole end of dazzling their salons.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn C.

==Themes==

===Rights and equality===
{{main|Women's rights}}
[[Women's rights]] refers to the social and human rights of women. In the [[United States]], the [[Abolitionism|abolition movements]] sparked an increased wave of attention to the status of women, but the [[history of feminism]] reaches to before the 18th century. (See [[protofeminism]].) The advent of the reformist age during the 19th century meant that those invisible minorities or marginalized majorities were to find a catalyst and a microcosm in such new tendencies of reform. The earliest works on the so-called "woman question" criticized the restrictive role of women, without necessarily claiming that women were disadvantaged or that men were to blame. [[Feminist history in the United Kingdom|In Britain, the Feminism movement]] began in the 19th century and continues in the present day. [[Simone de Beauvoir]] wrote a detailed analysis of women's oppression in her 1949 treatise ''The Second Sex.'' It became a foundational tract of contemporary feminism.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Lowenthal Felstiner, "Seeing 'The Second Sex' Through the Second Wave," ''Feminist Studies'' (1980) 6#2 pp. 247–276
&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s and early 1970s, [[feminist movement]]s, such as [[Feminist Movement in the United States (1963–1982)|the one in the United States]] substantially changed the condition of women in the Western world. One trigger for the revolution was the development of the [[birth control pill]] in 1960, which gave women access to easy and reliable contraception in order to conduct family planning.

===Capitalism===
Women's historians have debated the impact of capitalism on the status of women.&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor Amico, ed. ''Reader's guide to women's studies'' (1998) pp. 102–4, 306–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janet Thomas, "Women and capitalism: oppression or emancipation? A review article." ''Comparative studies in society and history'' 30#3 (1988): 534–549. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/178999 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Taking a pessimistic side, [[Alice Clark]] argued that when capitalism arrived in 17th century England, it made a negative impact on the status of women as they lost much of their economic importance. Clark argues that in the 16th century England, women were engaged in many aspects of industry and agriculture. The home was a central unit of production and women played a vital role in running farms, and in some trades and landed estates. Their useful economic roles gave them a sort of equality with their husbands. However, Clark argues, as capitalism expanded in the 17th century, there was more and more division of labor with the husband taking paid labor jobs outside the home, and the wife reduced to unpaid household work. Middle-class and women were confined to an idle domestic existence, supervising servants; lower-class women were forced to take poorly paid jobs. Capitalism, therefore, had a negative effect on many women.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Clark, ''Working life of women in the seventeenth century'' (1919).&lt;/ref&gt; In a more positive interpretation, [[Ivy Pinchbeck]] argues that capitalism created the conditions for women's emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;Ivy Pinchbeck, ''Women Workers in the Industrial Revolution'' (1930).&lt;/ref&gt;  Tilly and Scott have to Emphasize the continuity and the status of women, finding three stages in European history. In the preindustrial era, production was mostly for home use and women produce much of the needs of the households. The second stage was the "family wage economy" of early industrialization, the entire family depended on the collective wages of its members, including husband, wife and older children. The third or modern stage is the "family consumer economy," in which the family is the site of consumption, and women are employed in large numbers in retail and clerical jobs to support rising standards of consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Tilly and Joan Wallach Scott, ''Women, work, and family'' (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employment===
{{Main|Women in the workforce}}
The [[1870 US Census]] was the first to count "Females engaged in each and every occupation" and provides a snapshot of women's history.  It reveals that, contrary to popular myth, not all American women of the Victorian period were "safe" in their middle-class homes or working in sweatshops.  Women composed 15% of the total workforce (1.8 million out of 12.5).  They made up one-third of factory "operatives," and were concentrated in teaching, as the nation emphasized expanding education; dressmaking, millinery, and tailoring.  Two-thirds of [[teacher]]s were women. They also worked in iron and steel works (495), mines (46), sawmills (35), oil wells and refineries (40), gas works (4), and charcoal kilns (5), and held such surprising jobs as ship rigger (16), teamster (196), turpentine laborer (185), brass founder/worker (102), shingle and lathe maker (84), stock-herder (45), gun and locksmith (33), hunter and trapper (2).  There were five lawyers, 24 dentists, and 2,000 doctors.

===Marriage ages===
Marriage ages of women can be used as an indicator of the position of women in society. Women's age at marriage could influence economic development, partly because women marrying at higher ages had more opportunities to acquire [[human capital]].
On average, across the world, marriage ages of women have been rising. However, countries such as Mexico, China, Egypt, and Russia have shown a smaller increase in this measure of female empowerment than, for example, Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=242f|isbn=9781107507180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex and reproduction===
In the [[history of sex]], the social construction of sexual behavior—its taboos, regulation and social and political effects—has had a profound effect on women in the world since prehistoric times. Absent assured ways of controlling reproduction, women have practiced abortion since ancient times; many societies have also practice infanticide to ensure the survival of older children. Historically, it is unclear how often the ethics of abortion (induced abortion) was discussed in societies. In the latter half of the 20th century, some nations began to legalize abortion. This controversial subject has sparked heated debate and in some cases, violence, as different parts of society have different social and religious ideas about its meaning.

Women have been exposed to various tortuous sexual conditions and have been discriminated against in various fashions in history. In addition to women being sexual victims of troops in warfare, an institutionalized example was the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese military]] enslaving native women and girls as [[comfort women]] in military brothels in Japanese-occupied countries during [[World War II]].

===Clothing===
[[File:Chou Fang 004.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Beauties Wearing Flowers'', by [[Tang Dynasty]] Chinese artist [[Zhou Fang (Tang Dynasty)|Zhou Fang]], 8th century.]]
The [[social aspects of clothing|social aspects of]] clothing have revolved around traditions regarding certain items of clothing intrinsically suited different [[gender role]]s. In different periods, both women's and men's fashions have highlighted one area or another of the body for attention. In particular, the wearing of skirts and trousers has given rise to common phrases expressing implied restrictions in use and disapproval of offending behavior. For example, ancient Greeks often considered the wearing of trousers by Persian men as a sign of an [[Effeminacy|effeminate]] attitude. Women's clothing in [[Victorian fashion]] was used as a means of control and admiration. Reactions to the elaborate confections of French fashion led to various calls for reform on the grounds of both beauties (Artistic and Aesthetic dress) and health (dress reform; especially for undergarments and lingerie). Although trousers for women did not become fashionable until the later 20th century, women began wearing men's trousers (suitably altered) for outdoor work a hundred years earlier. In the 1960s, André Courrèges introduced long trousers for women as a fashion item, leading to the era of the pantsuit and designer jeans, and the gradual eroding of the prohibitions against girls and women wearing trousers in schools, the workplace, and fine restaurants. [[History of corsets|Corsets have long been used]] for fashion, and body modification, such as waistline reduction. There were, and are, many different styles and types of corsets, varying depending on the intended use, corset maker's style, and the fashions of the era.

===Status===
The [[social status]] of [[Women in the Victorian era|women in the Victoria Era]] is often seen as an illustration of the striking discrepancy between the nation's power and richness and what many consider its appalling social conditions. [[Victorian morality]] was full of contradictions. A plethora of social movements concerned with improving public morals co-existed with a class system that permitted and imposed harsh living conditions for many, such as women. In this period, an outward appearance of dignity and restraint was valued, but the usual "vices" continued, such as prostitution. In the Victorian era, the [[bathing machine]] was developed and flourished. It was a device to allow people to wade in the ocean at beaches without violating Victorian notions of modesty about having "limbs" revealed. The bathing machine was part of sea-bathing etiquette that was more rigorously enforced upon women than men.

===Roaring Twenties===
{{Main|Roaring Twenties}}
The '''Roaring Twenties''' is a term for society and culture in the 1920s in the Western world. It was a period of sustained economic prosperity with a distinctive cultural edge in the United States, Canada, and Western Europe, particularly in major cities.

[[Women's suffrage]] came about in many major countries in the 1920s, including United States, Canada, Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;The vote came years later in France, Italy, Quebec, Spain and Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt; many countries expanded women's voting rights in representative and direct democracies across the world such as the US, Canada, Great Britain and most major European countries in 1917–21, as well as India. This influenced many governments and elections by increasing the number of voters available. Politicians responded by spending more attention on issues of concern to women, especially pacifism, public health, education, and the status of children. On the whole, women voted much like their menfolk, except they were more pacifistic.&lt;ref&gt;June Hannam, Mitzi Auchterlonie, and Katherine Holden, eds. ''International encyclopedia of women's suffrage'' (Abc-Clio Inc, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1920s marked a revolution in fashion.  The new woman danced, drank, smoked and voted. She cut her hair short, wore make-up and partied. Sometimes she smoked a cigarette. She was known for being giddy and taking risks; she was a flapper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Popular Culture: 1920-1938|last=Bingham|first=Jane|publisher=Heinemann Library|year=2012|isbn=|location=Chicago Illinois|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More women took jobs making them more independent and free. With their desire for freedom and independence came as well change in fashion, welcoming a more comfortable style, where the waistline was just above the hips and loosen, and staying away from the [[Victorian fashion|Victorian style]] with a [[corset]] and tight waistline.

===Great Depression===
{{main|Great Depression#Role of women and household economics|Cities in the Great Depression}}
With widespread unemployment among men, poverty, and the need to help family members who are in even worse condition, The pressures were heavy on women during the Great Depression across the modern world.  A primary role was as a housewife. Without a steady flow of family income, their work became much harder in dealing with food and clothing and medical care. The birthrates fell everywhere, as children were postponed until families could financially support them. The average birthrate for 14 major countries fell 12% from 19.3 births per thousand population in 1930 to 17.0 in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;W.S. Woytinsky and E.S. ''World population and production: trends and outlook'' (1953) p 148&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, half of Roman Catholic women defied Church teachings and used contraception to postpone births.&lt;ref&gt;Denyse Baillargeon, ''Making Do: Women, Family, and Home in Montreal during the Great Depression'' (Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1999), p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the few women in the labor force, layoffs were less common in the white-collar jobs and they were typically found in light manufacturing work. However, there was a widespread demand to limit families to one paid job, so that wives might lose employment if their husband was employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jill Stephenson|title=Women in Nazi Germany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-rqOAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3|year=2014|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|pages=3–5|isbn=9781317876076}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan K.

Bean, "'To help keep the home going': female labour supply in interwar London." ''Economic History Review'' (2015) 68#2 pp. 441–470.&lt;/ref&gt;

In rural and small-town areas, women expanded their operation of vegetable gardens to include as much food production as possible. In the United States, agricultural organizations sponsored programs to teach housewives how to optimize their gardens and to raise poultry for meat and eggs.&lt;ref&gt;Ann E. McCleary, "'I Was Really Proud of Them': Canned Raspberries and Home Production During the Farm Depression." ''Augusta Historical Bulletin'' (2010), Issue 46, pp 14-44.&lt;/ref&gt;  In American cities,  African American women quiltmakers enlarged their activities, promote collaboration, and trained neophytes. Quilts were created for practical use from various inexpensive materials and increased social interaction for women and promoted camaraderie and personal fulfillment.&lt;ref&gt;Tari Klassen, "How Depression-Era Quiltmakers Constructed Domestic Space: An Interracial Processual Study," ''Midwestern Folklore: Journal of the Hoosier Folklore Society'' (2008) 34#2 pp. 17–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oral history provides evidence for how housewives in a modern industrial city handled shortages of money and resources. Often they updated strategies their mothers used when they were growing up in poor families. Cheap foods were used, such as soups, beans and noodles. They purchased the cheapest cuts of meat—sometimes even horse meat—and recycled the [[Sunday roast]] into sandwiches and soups. They sewed and patched clothing, traded with their neighbors for outgrown items, and made do with colder homes. New furniture and appliances were postponed until better days. Many women also worked outside the home, or took boarders, did laundry for trade or cash, and did sewing for neighbors in exchange for something they could offer. Extended families used mutual aid—extra food, spare rooms, repair-work, cash loans—to help cousins and in-laws.&lt;ref&gt;Baillargeon, ''Making Do: Women, Family and Home in Montreal during the Great Depression'' (1999), pp. 70, 108, 136–38, 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, official government policy was deflationary and the opposite of Keynesian spending. Consequently, the government launched a nationwide campaign to induce households to reduce their consumption, focusing attention on spending by housewives.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Metzler, "Woman's Place in Japan's Great Depression: Reflections on the Moral Economy of Deflation." ''Journal of Japanese Studies'' (2004) 30#2 pp. 315–352.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, the government tried to reshape private household consumption under the Four-Year Plan of 1936 to achieve German economic self-sufficiency. The Nazi women's organizations, other propaganda agencies and the authorities all attempted to shape such consumption as economic self-sufficiency was needed to prepare for and to sustain the coming war. Using traditional values of thrift and healthy living, the organizations, propaganda agencies and authorities employed slogans that called up traditional values of thrift and healthy living. However, these efforts were only partly successful in changing the behavior of housewives.&lt;ref&gt;N. R. Reagin, "Marktordnung and Autarkic Housekeeping: Housewives and Private Consumption under the Four-Year Plan, 1936–1939," ''German History'' (2001) 19#2 pp. 162–184.&lt;/ref&gt;
