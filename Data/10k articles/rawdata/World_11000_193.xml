'''Angola–Cape Verde relations''' refers to the [[bilateralism|historical and current bilateral relationship]] between the [[Angola|Republic of Angola]] and the [[Cape Verde|Republic of Cape Verde]]. Relations are based on their shared experiences as [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colonies]], both before, after and during the struggle for independence.

[[Domingos Pereira Magalhães]] is the ambassador of [[Cape Verde]] to [[Angola]].&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{cite web|author= |year=2008|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200801090915.html|title=Angola: President Dos Santos Accredits U.S., Côte D'Ivoire Ambassadors|publisher=Angola Press Agency via allAfrica|accessdate=2008-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970s==
[[Cape Verde]] signed a friendship accord with [[Angola]] in December 1975, shortly after Angola gained its independence. Cape Verde and [[Guinea-Bissau]] served as stop-over points for [[Cuban troops]] on their way to Angola to fight [[UNITA]] rebels and [[South Africa]]n troops. [[Prime Minister of Cape Verde|Prime Minister]] [[Pedro Pires]] sent [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of the People|FARP]] soldiers to Angola where they served as the personal bodyguards of [[Angolan President]] [[José Eduardo dos Santos]].&lt;ref name=b&gt;{{cite book|last=Lobban|first=Richard|year=1995|title=Cape Verde:Crioulo Colony to Independent Nation|pages=111–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two annual conferences that go by the Title of the "Asia Security Conference."  The oldest of these is held by the Indian think tank [[Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses]] (IDSA) in New Delhi, India.  This conference brings together globally renowned scholars who interact with senior members of IDSA as well as senior members of the Indian Government.  The 12th Annual Asian Security Conference was hosted by IDSA from 11–13 February.  These conferences are by invitation only.  At the 2010 Conference, the Indian Defence Minister and Indian Defence Secretary both played key roles.  The conference annually explores issues of security affecting South Asia.  Attendees for the 2010 Conference included senior academics from the United States, Pakistan, Russia, Iran, India, and the United Kingdom, among others.  Notable names included G. John Ikenberry, and Aaron Friedburg from Princeton, Summit Ganguly from the Indiana University, John Geis from Air University. More about the conference and its resulting publications can be found at the IDSA web site at  http://www.idsa.in/, where details about the Institutes many publications, events, speakers, and past "Asia Security Conferences" can be found.

There is a more recently developed '''Asia Security Conference'',' which is an annual event organised by [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] (IISS). The conference is also known as Shangri-La Dialogue. The first conference was held on 2002 and the success prompted the organisers to make it an annual event. The 8th edition of the conference&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iiss.org/conferences/the-shangri-la-dialogue/shangri-la-dialogue-2009/&lt;/ref&gt; was held from 29 to 31 May 2009 in [[Singapore]].

==2009 Conference==
Australia, Bangladesh, [[Brunei]], Cambodia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, [[Indonesia]], Japan, [[Laos]], Malaysia, [[Mongolia]], [[Myanmar]], New Zealand, [[Pakistan]], Philippines, [[Republic of Korea]], Russia, [[Singapore]], Sri Lanka, [[Thailand]], [[Timor Leste]], the United Kingdom, the United States, Vietnam are the countries that participated in the 2009 conference.

The main focus of the meet was shipping security, fighting terrorism and the [[North Korea]]'s nuclear ambition. The conference was of a particular importance in the backdrop of [[North Korea]]'s nuclear as well as missile test. There was also criticism that the meeting was organised for achieving peace in the region but the participating countries were more interested in private meetings to discuss weapons purchases.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE54U0JG20090531&lt;/ref&gt;

==2005 Conference==
The 2005&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreaherald.co.kr/index.asp The Korea Herald]&lt;/ref&gt; talks was held in [[Singapore]] and focused issues including the U.S.-led [[War on Terrorism]], the proliferation of [[weapons of mass destruction]], and the emergent roles for [[India]] and China in Asian regional security.

18 countries represented at the ministerial-level: [[Korea]], Australia, [[Cambodia]], Canada, [[India]], Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, [[Mongolia]], [[Myanmar]], New Zealand, [[Pakistan]], the [[Philippines]], Singapore, [[Thailand]], [[East Timor|Timor-Leste]], the United Kingdom and the United States.

Through this Conference, it was found that the United States might have done something wrong in "dealing with this whole terrorism mess."

It was built in the 18th century to house the city's administrative council, and it was subsequently used as the General Post Office and the Public Registry. The Banca Giuratale now houses the Ministry for the Economy, Investment and Small Business.

==History==
The Banca Giuratale was originally a house which belonged to Dr. Gio Batta Piotto, and it was taken over by the treasury of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of St. John]] in 1665. In 1721, the Università, which was the local administrative council of Valletta, acquired the building in exchange for its original premises located across the street (now the [[Monte di Pietà (Malta)|Monte di Pietà]]). The building was subsequently reconstructed during the magistracy of Grand Master [[Marc'Antonio Zondadari]]. The new building was designed by the architect Romano Carapecchia.&lt;ref name=oneworld/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.um.edu.mt/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/205549/baroqueroutes9.pdf UOM]. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=De Piro|first=Nicholas|title=Valletta: A City Built by Gentlemen for Gentlemen|date=1997|publisher=Miranda Publications|isbn=9990985006|page=85|url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=wbFQAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Monte+di+Pietà+buildings+Valletta&amp;dq=Monte+di+Pietà+buildings+Valletta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQyfeakPzOAhXDWxoKHcvbBj0Q6AEIKDAD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Banca Giuratale was renovated in 1762, during the magistracy of [[Manuel Pinto da Fonseca]]. [[Napoleon]] is said to have spent his last night in Malta, between 13 and 14 June 1798, at this building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Merchants Street – Valletta|url=http://www.culturemalta.org/49/6/Merchants-Street-Valletta|website=Culture Malta|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822055130/http://www.culturemalta.org/49/6/Merchants-Street-Valletta|archivedate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Banca Giuratale remained in use by the Università until that body was suppressed by Governor [[Thomas Maitland (British Army officer)|Thomas Maitland]] in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Gibbons Stamp Weekly|date=1908|volume=8|page=414|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vLBKAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=MARCUS+ANTONIUS+ZONDADARIUS+M.+M.+HAS&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=1762|publisher=[[Stanley Gibbons]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Banca_Giuratale_interior_Valletta.jpeg|thumb|left|150px|Interior of the Banca Giuratale]]
In 1841, the Banca Giuratale became a [[post office]] when the Packet Office was transferred there from the [[Casa del Commun Tesoro]] in [[Republic Square, Valletta|Piazza Tesoreria]]. The Island Post Office was also transferred into the Banca Giuratale on 1 April 1849, and the two were merged into the General Post Office in 1885. A year later, the GPO moved to [[Palazzo Parisio (Valletta)|Palazzo Parisio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Proud|first1=Edward B.|title=The Postal History of Malta|date=1999|publisher=Proud-Bailey Co. Ltd|location=[[Heathfield, East Sussex|Heathfield]]|isbn=1872465315|pages=186–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, the Banca Giuratale housed the Public Registry. The latter has now moved to Evans Building,&lt;ref name=publicregistry&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Registry|url=https://secure2.gov.mt/certifikati/Department.aspx|website=Ċertifikati.gov.mt|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026231204/https://secure2.gov.mt/certifikati/Department.aspx|archivedate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Banca Giuratale now houses the Ministry for the Economy, Investment and Small Business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contact Information|url=https://economy.gov.mt/en/Pages/Home.aspx|website=Ministry for the Economy, Investment and Small Business|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026231058/https://economy.gov.mt/en/Pages/Home.aspx|archivedate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The façade was restored sometimes in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gazzetta tal-Gvern ta' Malta|url=https://govcms.gov.mt/en/Government/Government%20Gazette/Documents/2015/01/Government%20Gazette%20-%2023%20January.pdf|publisher=Government Gazette|date=23 January 2015|page=585|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123220053/https://govcms.gov.mt/en/Government/Government%20Gazette/Documents/2015/01/Government%20Gazette%20-%2023%20January.pdf|archivedate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Valletta building after restoration.jpeg|thumb|Baroque façade of the Banca Giuratale]]
The Banca Giuratale is built in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style. The main portal is flanked by [[Doric order|Doric]] columns which support an open balcony.&lt;ref name=oneworld/&gt; Two [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]]s are located on either side of the doorway, above which are oval windows set in blind arches. The first floor contains five ornate windows, and an ornate centrepiece is located above the central window. This includes a bust of Grand Master Zondadari, carved figures and drapery and a marble slab with the following [[Latin]] inscription:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ciantar|first1=Giovannantonio|title=Malta illustrata ovvero descrizione di Malta isola del Mare Siciliano e Adriatico|date=1772|location=[[Malta]]|page=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mFh-zVrHHIMC&amp;pg=PA66#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;}}
The centrepiece also contained a number of coats of arms, but these were probably defaced during the French occupation of 1798–1800. The central coat of arms was later replaced by the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|British royal arms]] in the early 19th century.&lt;ref name=nicpmi/&gt;

'''Blue Shield International''', formerly the '''International Committee of the Blue Shield''', is an [[international organization]] founded  in 1996 to protect the world's [[cultural heritage]] from threats such as armed conflict and natural disasters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.icom.museum/emergency.html The International Committee of the Blue Shield (ICBS)]&lt;/ref&gt; Described as the "cultural equivalent of the [[Red Cross]], its name derives from the blue shield symbol used to signify cultural sites protected by the 1954 [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|Hague Convention on Protection of Cultural Property in Armed Conflict]] 

==History==
Following the [[Second World War]], which saw [[Art theft and looting during World War II|extensive damage and widespread theft of cultural heritage]] throughout Europe and Asia, the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO}]] was founded in 1946 with the official aim of promoting peace, development, and dialogue through cultural exchange and preservation. At the behest of the Netherlands, UNESCO helped draft and sponsor the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, the first international treaty that focuses exclusively on the protection of cultural property in armed conflict; it entered into force on 7 August 1956, obligating state parties to protect cultural property in both peacetime and war, including those located in combatant nations. 

Blue Shield International was established in 1996 as the International Committee of the Blue Shield to further the aims of UNESCO and the Convention, coordinating with organizations and institutions responsible for museums, archives, libraries, and historical sites. The Second Protocol of 1999 explicitly mentions in Articles 11 and 27 the consultative role of the International Committee of the Blue Shield in the implementation of the Agreement.

==Overview==
The ICBS consists of representatives from five organizations:
* [[International Council on Archives]]
* [[International Council of Museums]]
* [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]]
* [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]]

The interim Chair of ICBS is Hanna Pennock, who is also acting director general of the [[International Council of Museums]] (ICOM).  Since December 2008, the president of the ANCBS has been [[Karl von Habsburg]]. Since its establishment, a number of National Blue Shield Committees have been formed in various countries, leading to the December 2008 establishment of the '''Association of National Committees of the Blue Shield''' ('''ANCBS''').

In the United States, the National Committee of the Blue Shield is the [[U.S. Committee of the Blue Shield]] (USCBS).

The '''Committee of 100''' in Finland ('''Sadankomitea''' in Finnish) was founded in 1963, based on the model of the [[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)|Committee of 100]] in [[Great Britain]].

The Committee of 100 has been one of foremost organizations of the peace movement in Finland, especially in the 1960s.

Currently{{When|date=November 2010}}, the Committee of 100 publishes the magazine ''[[Ydin]]'' and the online magazine ''Pax'', organises seminars, distributes pamphlets, and lobbies for peace and human rights. It has particularly criticised Finland's refusal to participate in international treaties banning [[cluster bombs]].

Active persons in the Committee of 100 have included the former Finnish Foreign Minister [[Erkki Tuomioja]].

The '''Constitution of Eritrea''' is the [[supreme law]] of [[Eritrea]]. It provides the legal foundation for the existence of the State and source of legal authority. It sets out the rights and duties of its citizens, and defines the structure of government. Despite its ratification by the legislature, the constitution has not been implemented yet.

==Overview==
In March 1994, the [[Provisional Government of Eritrea]] established a [[Constitutional Commission]] to draft a new constitution. The drafting authority was the transitional [[National Assembly of Eritrea|National Assembly]], a body consisting of 75 members of the EPLF central committee and 75 representatives elected by regional assemblies.&lt;ref name="Widner"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~pcwcr/reports/eritrea1997.html|title=Eritrea 1997|author=Jennifer Widner|publisher=Princeton University|date=August 2005|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, a global symposium was held in [[Asmara]] for the writing of the Constitution of Eritrea. Eritrean representatives worked closely on the legislation with a number of international experts, including [[Somali people|Somali]] scholars [[Ismail Ali Ismail]] and [[Said Sheikh Samatar]]. The following year, Ismail also helped train senior government officials in the Eritrean capital.&lt;ref name="Easmoasc"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ismail|first1=Ismail Ali|title=Ethiopia and Somalia: Missed Opportunities and Some Challenges|url=http://wardheernews.com/articles/July/7_Somalia%20&amp;%20Ethiopia_Geeldoon.htm|accessdate=1 September 2014|agency=Wardheernews|date=6 July 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717051755/http://wardheernews.com/articles/July/7_Somalia%20%26%20Ethiopia_Geeldoon.htm|archivedate=17 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 27 months, the resulting constitution was introduced to the National Assembly in 1997.&lt;ref name="Widner"/&gt; Although the constitution has been ratified, it has yet to be fully implemented, and [[Elections in Eritrea|general elections]] have not been held, despite the ratification of an election law in 2002.&lt;ref name=cp&gt;{{cpref|country=Eritrea|date=September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eritrean constitution calls for legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government. According to the constitution, a 150-seat unicameral legislature, the [[National Assembly (Eritrea)|National Assembly]], decides internal and external policy, approves the budget, and elects the [[President of Eritrea|president of the country]]. However, the [[National Assembly]] has not met since 2002, Legislative as well as executive functions are now exercised by President [[Isaias Afwerki]].&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

The '''diplomatic corps''' or '''''corps diplomatique''''' is the collective body of foreign [[diplomat]]s accredited to a particular country or body.

The diplomatic corps may, in certain contexts, refer to the collection of [[Letter of Credence|accredited]] [[head of mission|heads of mission]] ([[ambassador]]s, [[high commissioner]]s, and others) who represent their [[country|countries]] in another state or country. As a body, they usually only assemble to attend state functions like a [[coronation]], [[inauguration]], [[national day]] or [[State Opening of Parliament]], depending on local custom. They may also assemble in the royal or presidential [[palace]] to give their own [[head of state]]'s New Year greeting to the head of state of the country in which they are based.

The term is sometimes confused with the collective body of diplomats ''from'' a particular country&amp;mdash;the proper term for which is ''[[diplomatic service]]''. The diplomatic corps is not always given any formal recognition by its host country, but can be referenced by official [[order of precedence|orders of precedence]].

In many countries, and especially in Africa, the heads and the foreign members of the country offices of major international organizations ([[United Nations]] agencies, the [[European Union]], the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], agencies of the [[African Union]], etc.) are considered members&amp;mdash;and granted the rights and privileges&amp;mdash;of the diplomatic corps.

Diplomatic vehicles in most countries have distinctive [[diplomatic license plates]], often with the prefix or suffix ''CD'', the abbreviation for the French ''corps diplomatique''.

==Dean of the diplomatic corps==
In some countries, the longest-serving [[ambassador]] to a country is given the title dean, or doyen, of the diplomatic corps and is sometimes accorded a high position in the [[order of precedence]]. In [[New Zealand]], for example, the dean takes precedence over figures such as the [[Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand|deputy prime minister]] and former [[Governor General of New Zealand|governors-general]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Order of Precedence in New Zealand|url=http://gg.govt.nz/sites/all/files/u15/2015%20Order%20of%20Precedence%20for%20New%20Zealand.pdf|website=Website of the Governor-General of New Zealand|publisher=New Zealand Government|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some places the role of senior diplomat is given to the head of the mission of the [[Holy See]] referred to as the [[apostolic nuncio]], see below. 

The diplomatic corps may also cooperate amongst itself on a number of matters, including certain dealings with the host government. In practical terms, the dean of the diplomatic corps may have a role to play in negotiating with local authorities regarding the application of aspects of the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]] and [[diplomatic immunity]], such as the payment of certain fees or taxes, since the receiving country is required "not to discriminate between states". In this sense, the dean has the role of representing the entire diplomatic corps for matters that affect the corps as a whole, although this function is rarely formalized.

== Role of the papal nuncio ==

In many countries that have [[Roman Catholicism]] as the official or dominant religion, the [[apostolic nuncio]] holds the decanate and is the corps' spokesman on formal occasions;&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus Eugene Cardinale, ''The Holy See and the International Order'' ({{ISBN|0-900675-60-8}}), p. 160. Quote: "The right to precedence of all permanent papal representatives regardless of their title, from 1815-1849 was generally acknowledged and admitted without contestation by the governments of all the European States and of South America, and without any objection being raised by the diplomats accredited to these States, not even on the part of the British envoys. Such, for example, was the case of the internuncios Mgr Francesco Capaccini in Holland (1829-1831), Mgr Pasquale Gizzi (1835-1837) and Mgr Raffaele Fornari (1838-1841) in Belgium, Mgr Antonio Garibaldi in France (1836-1843) and all the papal diplomatic representatives with the title of apostolic delegate and envoy extraordinary in the various South American republics."&lt;/ref&gt; in other cases, the nuncio is treated as an ordinary ambassador of the [[Holy See]] and has no special precedence. The [[Congress of Vienna]] and the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]] provided that any country may choose to give nuncios a different precedence than other ambassadors.&lt;ref name="vienna1815_en"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Regulation of Vienna on the classification of diplomatic agents|encyclopedia=Yearbook of the International Law Commission|date=1957|volume=II|language=fr|url=http://legal.un.org/docs/?path=../ilc/documentation/english/reports/a_cn4_110.pdf|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Europäische Wasserscheiden.png|thumb|300px|Main European drainage divides (red lines) separating catchments (green regions).]]

The main '''European watershed''' is the [[drainage divide]] ("watershed") which separates the [[drainage basin|basins]] of the rivers that empty into the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the [[North Sea]] and the [[Baltic Sea]] from those that feed the [[Mediterranean Sea]], the [[Adriatic Sea]] and the [[Black Sea]]. It stretches from the tip of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] at [[Gibraltar]] in the southwest to the [[endorheic basin]] of the [[Caspian Sea]] in [[Russia]] in the northeast.

==Course==
===Atlantic—Mediterranean===
[[File:140614-Autoroute-A36-02.jpg|thumb|left|Atlantic—Mediterranean watershed marker between [[Belfort]] and [[Mulhouse]] on the [[A36 autoroute]]]]
The Watershed runs northwards through [[Spain]] in the Iberian Peninsula towards the [[Bay of Biscay]] along the basins of [[Guadalquivir]], [[Guadiana]], [[Tagus]] and [[Douro]] in the west to the sources of the [[Ebro]] in [[Cantabria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.iberianature.com/material/rivers.html |title=Rivers in Spain|work=www.iberianature.com |accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It then follows the main ridge of the [[Pyrenees]] eastwards up to [[Andorra]], where it again turns to the north through [[France]] along the catchment areas of [[Garonne]] (with the summit of the [[Canal du Midi]] at [[Seuil de Naurouze]]), [[Loire (river)|Loire]] and [[Seine]] in the west and that of the [[Rhone]] in the east, marked by the [[Cévennes]] mountain range between the sources of the [[Allier (river)|Allier]] and [[Ardèche (river)|Ardèche]] tributaries. 

At the [[Belfort Gap]] south of the [[Vosges Mountains]] it separates the Rhone basin in the southwest from the drainage of [[Meuse]] and [[Rhine]] in the northeast, turns southwards to the Swiss [[Jura Mountains]] and passes between [[Lake Geneva]] and [[Lake Neuchâtel]]. It reaches the [[Bernese Alps]] where it runs along the [[Main chain of the Alps|Alpine divide]] to the [[Gotthard Pass]]. Mt. [[Witenwasserenstock]] marks the triple watershed of the Rhone, Rhine and [[Po (river)|Po]] rivers, further to the east along the [[Grison Alps]] it reaches the tripoint of the Rhine, Po and [[Danube]] basins at the "roof of Europe" [[Piz Lunghin]] west of the [[Maloja Pass]].

===Atlantic—Black Sea===
[[File:Klepý.JPG|thumb|Trójmorski Wierch - one of six places in Europe where three watersheds meet]]
[[File:Wasserscheide Rhein-Donau.jpg|thumb|left|Rhine–Danube watershed marker near [[Weitnau]], Germany]]
The divide continues northwards along the [[Albula Alps]] to [[Julier Pass]], [[Albula Pass]] and [[Flüela Pass]] south of [[Davos]] between the catchment area of the Rhine, which empties into the North Sea via the [[Netherlands]], and the [[Danube]], which flows eastward emptying into the [[Black Sea]]. It enters [[Austria]] at [[Piz Buin]] in the [[Silvretta Alps]] running along the [[Arlberg]] massif and forming the border between the [[States of Austria|states]] of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] and [[Vorarlberg]]. It reaches [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]] via the crest of the [[Allgäu Alps]] and leaves the High Alps at the [[Adelegg]] range near [[Kempten]].

Within the [[Foothills|Alpine foothills]] it runs north of the [[Schussen]] catchment area of [[Lake Constance]] towards the sources of the [[Brigach]] and [[Breg (river)|Breg]] headwaters of the Danube in the [[Black Forest]]. It then follows the main ridge of the [[Swabian Jura|Swabian]] and [[Franconian Jura]] with the crossing of the [[Rhine–Main–Danube Canal]] northeastwards up to the [[Fichtelgebirge]] and southeastwards along the [[Bohemian Forest]], forming the border between Germany and the Austrian [[Mühlviertel]] and [[Waldviertel]] regions with the [[Czech Republic]], where the large [[Bohemia]]n basin is drained by the [[Elbe]] River. It again turns northeastwards along the [[Bohemian-Moravian Highlands]]-[[Javořice Highlands (Moravia)|Javořice Highlands]] to the [[Śnieżnik Mountains]] of the Eastern [[Sudetes]] at the border with [[Poland]], where the tripoint of [[Orlice]], [[Elbe]] ([[North Sea]]) and [[Morava (river)|Morava]], [[Danube]] ([[Black Sea]]) and [[Eastern Neisse]], [[Oder]] ([[Baltic Sea]]) is located at the peak of Trójmorski Wierch (Klepý, Klappersteine, Three seas peak, 1144 m above sea level). 

The Watershed continues in eastern direction along the [[Hrubý Jeseník|Jeseníky]] Mountains down to [[Moravian Gate]] and uphill into the [[Beskids]], with the Oder and [[Vistula]] basins in the north, reaching the tripoint of Poland with [[Slovakia]] and [[Ukraine]] in the [[Bieszczady Mountains]]. Then, the Watershed goes northeast near the Poland–Ukraine border, passes through the city of [[Lviv]] and, via [[Volyn Oblast|Volyn]], enters [[Belarus]]. Then it runs east-northeast along [[Belarusian Ridge]] and continues to the [[Smolensk Oblast]] of Russia, ending at the tripoint with [[Caspian sea|Caspian]] drainage basin in the [[Sychyovsky District]], near the [[midpoint]] of Western Russia's cities [[Smolensk]] and [[Tver]].

==Characteristics==
The watershed is not a clearly defined [[Water divide|divide]]. [[Tectonics]], especially in the area that is now the [[Upper Rhine Plain]], created the River Rhine. As its [[headward erosion]] is much stronger than that of the much older River Danube (see the [[Danube#Geology|upper river geology]]) (due to the Rhine's sharper altitude gradient on its much shorter way to the North Sea), the Rhine and its tributaries intrude deeper into [[phreatic zone]]s of the Swabian [[Karst topography|Karst]] and even capture the upper Danube and its surface tributaries.

It is expected that the Danube's upper course will one day disappear entirely in favour of the Rhine ("[[stream capture]]").

'''Gjögur Airport''' {{airport codes|GJR|BIGJ}} is an airport serving the small population of the [[Árneshreppur]] district in the [[Westfjords]] of north-west [[Iceland]], on the coast of [[Húnaflói]] bay. It is staffed part-time by an AFIS controller, and only opens for [[Flugfélag Ernir]] flights, which are twice a week in the winter and once a week in the summer.

Gjögur airport is very important to the local population. In the winter, the airport is the only means of access to the entire district, as the access road is impassable. The government of Iceland requires these flights in order to supply the population with food and other goods, and provide passenger transport. Flugfélag Ernir is the only airline that flies here.  

The airport has runway lights, [[Precision Approach Path Indicator|PAPI]] lights, and taxiway lights. It has an instrument approach using the on-field Gjogur [[non-directional beacon]] (Ident: '''GJ'''), but this is only short range, e.g. it can be picked up from nearby [[Hólmavík]] airfield.&lt;ref&gt;[https://skyvector.com/?ll=65.995278,-21.3299&amp;chart=301&amp;zoom=1 SkyVector Aeronautical Charts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ourairports.com/navaids/GJ/Gjogur_NDB_IS/#lat=65.99469757080078,lon=-21.329999923706055,zoom=16,type=Satellite Gjogur NDB]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''' Alert and Coordination System''' ('''GDACS''') is a joint initiative of the [[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] (OCHA) and the [[European Commission]] that serves to consolidate and improve the dissemination of disaster-related information, in order to improve the coordination of international [[humanitarian aid|relief efforts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.gdacs.org/about |title=About GDACS |publisher=Portal.gdacs.org |accessdate=2012-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established in 2004 and is a multi-hazard disaster monitor and alert system for [[earthquake]]s, [[tsunami]]s, floods, [[volcano]]es, and [[tropical cyclone]]s. It was created to reduce the various monitor websites for the different disaster types. It started as GDAS, but was later coupled with the coordination information system of OCHA (the OCHA Virtual OSOCC). GDACS collects near real-time hazard information and combines this with demographic and socio-economic data to perform a mathematical analysis of the expected impact. This is based on the magnitude of the event and possible risk for the population. The result of this risk analysis is distributed by the GDACS website and alerts are sent via email, fax, and SMS to subscribers in the disaster relief community, and all other persons that are interested in this information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=De Groeve |first=T. |author2=Peter, T. |author3=Annunziato, A. |author4=Vernaccini, L. |title=Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of the Jews during World War II''' is almost synonymous with the Jewish persecution and murder of unprecedented scale in modern times in political Europe inclusive of European North Africa (pro-Nazi Vichy-North Africa and Italian Libya). The massive scale of [[the Holocaust]] which happened during [[World War II]] heavily affected the [[Jews|Jewish nation]] and world public opinion, which only understood the dimensions of the [[Final Solution]] after the war. The genocide, known as ''HaShoah'' in Hebrew, aimed at the elimination of the Jewish people on the European continent. It was a broadly organized operation led by [[Nazi Germany]], in which approximately six million Jews were murdered methodically and with horrifying cruelty. During [[the Holocaust in occupied Poland]], more than one million Jews were murdered in gas chambers of the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] alone. The murder of the Jews of Europe affected Jewish communities in [[The Holocaust in Albania|Albania]], [[History of the Jews in Austria#The Holocaust in Austria|Austria]], [[The Holocaust in Belarus|Belarus]], [[The Holocaust in Belgium|Belgium]], [[History of the Jews in Bosnia and Herzegovina#The Holocaust|Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina]], [[German occupation of the Channel Islands#Repressions|Channel Islands]], [[The Holocaust in the Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]], [[History of the Jews in the Czech Republic|Czech Republic]], [[The Holocaust in Estonia|Estonia]], [[The Holocaust in France|France]], [[History of the Jews in Germany#Jews under the Nazis (1933-45)|Germany]], [[History of the Jews in Greece#World War II.2C Resistance and the Holocaust|Greece]], [[History of the Jews in Hungary#The Holocaust|Hungary]], [[History of the Jews in Italy#Jews during the Fascist era|Italy]], [[The Holocaust in Latvia|Latvia]], [[The Holocaust in Italian Libya|Libya]], [[The Holocaust in Lithuania|Lithuania]], [[The Holocaust in Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], [[History of the Jews in the Republic of Macedonia#World War II and the Holocaust|Macedonia]], [[History of the Jews in Moldova#The Holocaust|Moldova]], [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands#The Holocaust|The Netherlands]], [[The Holocaust in Norway|Norway]], [[The Holocaust in Poland|Poland]], [[History of the Jews in Romania#The Holocaust|Romania]], [[The Holocaust in Russia|Russia]], [[The Holocaust in Serbia|Serbia]], [[History of the Jews in Slovakia#The Holocaust|Slovakia]], and [[The Holocaust in Ukraine|Ukraine]].&lt;ref name=LDavi&gt;{{cite book |title=A Holocaust Reader |author=[[Lucy S.

Leading to World War II, nearly all Jewish firms in Nazi Germany had either collapsed under financial pressure and declining profits, or had been forced to sell out to the Nazi German government as part of the "[[Aryanization (Nazism)|Aryanization]]" policy inaugurated in 1937. As the [[Polish September Campaign|war started]], [[Wiktionary:massacre|massacres]] of Jews took place originally as part of [[Operation Tannenberg]] [[Nazi crimes against the Polish nation|against the Polish nation]]. The much larger and methodical mass killings of Jews began with the onset of [[Operation Barbarossa]]. Led by ''[[Einsatzkommando]]s'' and the [[Orpo battalions]], the destruction of European Jews took place with the active participation of [[Schutzmannschaft|local Auxiliary Police]] including [[Belarusian Auxiliary Police|Belarusian]], [[Estonian Auxiliary Police|Estonian]], [[Latvian Auxiliary Police|Latvian]], [[Lithuanian Auxiliary Police Battalions|Lithuanian]], and [[Ukrainian Auxiliary Police|Ukrainian]] ''Schutzmannschaften''.&lt;ref name=LDavi/&gt;

Before the onset of war, the first [[pogrom]] in Nazi Germany was ''[[Kristallnacht]]'', often called ''Pogromnacht'', or "night of broken glass," in which Jewish homes were ransacked in numerous German cities along with 11,000 Jewish shops, towns and villages,&lt;ref name=Gilbert30&gt;[[Martin Gilbert|Gilbert, Martin]]. ''Kristallnacht: Prelude to Destruction''. Harper Collins, 2006, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; as civilians and [[Sturmabteilung|SA stormtroopers]] destroyed buildings with sledgehammers, leaving the streets covered in smashed windows &amp;mdash; the origin of the name "Night of Broken Glass."  Jews were beaten to death; 30,000 Jewish men were taken to [[concentration camp]]s; and 1,668 [[synagogue]]s ransacked with 267 set on fire. Following [[Operation Barbarossa]] launched on 22 June 1941, in the city of [[Lviv Ghetto|Lviv]] in the occupied territory of the [[General Government]], Ukrainian nationalists [[Lviv pogroms|organized two large pogroms]] in July 1941, in which around 6,000 Jews were murdered.&lt;ref name="Longerich194"&gt;{{cite book | last = Longerich | first = Peter | authorlink = Peter Longerich | title = Holocaust: The Nazi Persecution and Murder of the Jews | year = 2010 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford; New York | isbn = 978-0-19-280436-5 | page = 194 | url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=cxYqYIn73SgC&amp;q=Petljura+Days#v=snippet&amp;q=Petljura%20Days&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USHMM"&gt;{{cite web|author=USHMM |url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005171 |title=Lwów |format=Internet Archive |work=[[Holocaust Encyclopedia]] |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |accessdate=4 March 2015 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307103305/http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005171 |archivedate=7 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Lithuania, local [[Lithuanian Activist Front|militant groups]] engaged in anti-Jewish pogroms on July 25 and 26, 1941 around [[Kaunas pogrom|Kaunas]] even before the Nazi forces arrived, killing about 3,800 Jews and burning synagogues and Jewish shops.&lt;ref name=MacQueen&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=MacQueen |url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0253333598&amp;id=USW9-xQ85FwC&amp;pg=PA9 |editor-first=Zvi |editor-last=Gitelman |title=Bitter Legacy: Confronting the Holocaust in the USSR |chapter=Nazi Policy towards the Jews in the Reichskommissariat Ostland, June–December 1941: From White Terror to Holocaust in Lithuania |isbn=0-253-33359-8 |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=1998 |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the deadliest of these Holocaust-era pogroms was the [[Iași pogrom]] in Romania, in which as many as 14,000 Jews were killed by Romanian citizens, police, and military officials.

By December 1941, [[Adolf Hitler]] decided to completely [[Genocide|exterminate]] [[Europe]]an Jews.&lt;ref name="YB"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bauer |first=Yehuda |title=Rethinking the Holocaust |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2000 |page=5 |isbn=0300093004 |ref=harv |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=WhvShlTeqesC&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;vq=zurotten&amp;pg=PA5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1942, during the [[Wannsee conference]], several [[Nazism|Nazi]] leaders discussed the details of the "[[final solution|Final Solution of the Jewish question]]" (''Endlösung der Judenfrage''). [[Dr. Josef Bühler]] urged [[Reinhard Heydrich]] to proceed with the "Final Solution" in the [[General Government]]. They began to systematically deport Jewish populations from the ghettos and all occupied territories to the seven camps designated as ''Vernichtungslager,'' or [[extermination camp]]s: [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], Birkenau was the Extermination Camp site [[Belzec extermination camp|Belzec]], [[Chelmno concentration camp|Chelmno]], [[Majdanek]], [[Sobibór extermination camp|Sobibór]] and [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka II]]. [[Sebastian Haffner]] published the analysis in 1978 that Hitler from December 1941 accepted the failure of his goal to dominate Europe forever on his declaration of war against the [[United States]], but that his withdrawal and apparent calm thereafter was sustained by the achievement of his second goal—the extermination of the Jews.

Even as the German Nazi war machine faltered in the last years of the war, precious military resources such as fuel, transport, munitions, soldiers, and industrial resources were still being heavily diverted away from the war and towards the death camps. By the end of the war, more than half of Jewish population of Europe had been killed in the [[Holocaust]]. [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], home of the [[History of the Jews in Poland|largest Jewish community]] in Europe before the war, had over 90% of its Jewish population, or about 3,000,000 Jews, murdered by the Nazis. [[Greece]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Latvia]] each had over 70% of their Jewish population killed.&lt;ref name=LDavi/&gt;

[[Hungary]] and [[Albania]] lost around half of their Jewish populations, the Soviet Union, Germany, Austria and Luxembourg lost over one third of its Jews, Belgium and France each saw around a quarter of their Jewish populations killed.&lt;ref name=LDavi/&gt;

During the war, Spain became an unlikely haven for several thousand Jews. They were mainly from Western Europe, fleeing deportation to concentration camps from occupied France, but also Sephardic Jews from Eastern Europe, especially in Hungary. Trudy Alexy{{who|date=April 2016}} refers to the "absurdity" and "paradox of refugees fleeing the Nazis' [[Final Solution]] to seek asylum in a country where no Jews had been allowed to live openly as Jews for over four centuries."&lt;ref&gt;Trudy Alexy, ''The Mezuzah in the Madonna's Foot'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 1993. {{ISBN|0-671-77816-1}}. p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rosh Hashanah Evening (6158254119).jpg|thumb|Servicemen of the 20th Air Force stationed in Guam during World War II participate in a [[Rosh Hashanah]] service.]]
Approximately 1.5 million Jews served in the regular Allied militaries during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yadvashem.org/holocaust/about/combat-resistance/jewish-soldiers "Jewish Soldiers in the Allied Armies"]. [[Yad Vashem]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 550,000 American Jews served in the various branches of the United States armed services. Roughly 52,000 received U.S. military awards.&lt;ref name="villager"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.thevillager.com/villager_34/roleofamerican.html |title=Ours to Fight For: American Jews in the Second World War |last=Hartwick |first=Sharon |journal=The Villager |date= December 24, 2003 |origyear= Dec 24–30 |volume=73 |issue=34 |accessdate= November 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 500,000 served in the [[Red Army]], and more than 160,000 earned citations, with over 150 receiving the [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] award. Some 100,000 Jews served in the Polish Army during the German invasion, and thousands served in the [[Polish Armed Forces in the West|Free Polish Forces]], including about 10,000 in [[Anders' Army]]. Over 60,000 Jews served in the [[British Armed Forces]] (excluding dominion or colonial personnel), including 14,000 in the [[Royal Air Force]] and 15,000 in the [[Royal Navy]]. About 30,000 Jews from [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] also served in the British military.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hebrew Impact on Western Civilization'', Dagobert D. Runes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noah Klieger (11 September 2006), [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3302233,00.html Army was Polish, soldiers were Jews.] Exhibition set to open next week salutes anonymous Jewish fighters who fought with Poland’s armies.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yad Vashem, [http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/about/07/jewish_soldiers.asp The Holocaust: Combat and Resistance. Jewish Soldiers in the Allied Armies.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jewish partisans]] also fought throughout occupied Europe and were organized into groups such as the [[Bielski partisans]], [[United Partisan Organization]] and the [[Parczew partisans]]. Jewish Partisans took part in the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]], the [[Warsaw uprising]] and many other battles throughout the war.

The '''Inter-American Center of Tax Administrations''' "CIAT" is an international organization specialized in training and exchanges of information between national tax administrations.

The CIAT is a non-profit international public organization that provides specialized technical assistance for the modernization and strengthening of [[tax administration]]s. Founded in 1967, CIAT currently has 39 member countries and associate member countries from four continents; 31 countries of the Americas, 5 European countries, 2 African countries and 1 Asian country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unpan.org/tabid/456/ItemID/147/language/en-US/Default.aspx |title=United Nations Public Administration Network |publisher=Unpan.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guidelines==
*To promote  mutual cooperation programs between the tax administrations to prevent and combat all forms of fraud, tax evasion and facilitate voluntary compliance;
*To Develop and disseminate information, studies, research and development of innovative practices to improve tax policy and administration.
*To design, promote and implement training activities in coordination with the tax administrations, to help improve levels of professionalism of its staff.
*To Evaluate, support and execute the implementation of technical assistance projects to strengthen the tax administrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciat.org/index.php/en/about-ciat.html |title=About CIAT |publisher=Ciat.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===Foundation===
After the authorities of the tax administrations of countries of the Americas visited the United States in 1965 to learn about and discuss on site issues of [[tax administration]], Sheldon Cohen and Harold Moss, at the time commissioner and director, respectively, of the International Assistance Office of the US [[Internal Revenue Service]], had the vision to create an organization that could serve as a permanent forum to address tax administration issues.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

A steering committee was designated in order to lay the groundwork for a multilateral tax administrators’ organization. The members of the committee were Sheldon Cohen and Harold Moss (USA), Roberto Hoyo and Alfredo Gutiérrez (Mexico), Jaime Ross and Tomás Aguayo (Chile), Menalco Solís and Targidio Bernal (Panama) and Edison Gnazzo and Emilio Vidal (Uruguay). In the meetings held in 1965 and 1966, said Committee drafted the organization’s Bylaws.

In May 1967, in the first general assembly held in [[Panama]], the bylaws of the Inter-American Center of Tax Administrators (CIAT) were approved.

In 1997 a change in the center’s name was approved, becoming the Inter-American Center of Tax Administrations, to emphasize the organization’s institutional nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciat.org/index.php/en/about-ciat/our-history.html|title=History of CIAT|accessdate=16 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evolution of CIAT's activities ===
Until 1977, CIAT’s activities were mainly focused on the organization of international meetings (annual Assembly, conferences and technical seminars), the publication of a newsletter and the creation and maintenance of a library specialized in tax matters. That same year, a Technical Cooperation Agreement was signed with the Federal Republic of Germany, whereby said country appointed a permanent mission to CIAT, which was of great benefit to the organization and its member countries.&lt;ref&gt;M. Wit, R. von Frankenhorst, K. Gunselmann. [http://www.gtz.de/de/dokumente/en-factsheet-inter-american-center-tax-administrations.pdf Regional cooperation in tax reforms GTZ experience with the Inter-American Center of Tax Administrations (CIAT)], Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) GmbH, November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The Agreement was in place until 1997 and facilitated CIAT’s entering into the field of technical assistance.

In 1982 and 1983, technical cooperation agreements were signed with France and Spain, respectively, as a result of which permanent missions of said countries were appointed to CIAT’s headquarters in Panama.

In addition, in 1983, the Regional Technical Cooperation Project on the Single Taxpayers’ Registry and Current Account, RUC/CC (as per the Spanish acronym) was undertaken for Central America and the Caribbean, financed by the IDB and administered by CIAT. The Center then started acting as a specialized agency rendering technical assistance services for the tax administrations of Latin America and the Caribbean.

In 1987, in the General Assembly held in Uruguay, the reform of the Bylaws was approved, creating the category of Associate Member Countries. This enabled the accession under such status of Spain and Portugal in 1990, France in 1991, Italy in 1995, and The Netherlands in 1996.

The institutional evolution process continued in the course of the 1990s with, on the one hand, the increasing use of information technology and management tools like strategic planning, and, on the other, the increasing interest and commitment on the part of the European associate member countries, five of which became full members in 2001.

Another significant event in the history of CIAT was the incorporation as associate members of the Czech Republic and South Africa in the Assembly held in Bolivia in 2004, Kenya in the General Assembly held in Brazil in 2006, and India in the General Assembly held in Guatemala in 2009. The last General Assembly was held in Buenos Aires on April 22–25, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CIAT Assembly |url=http://www.ciat.org/index.php/es/cooperacion-internacional/actividades-internacionales/asambleas-generales/2462.html?goback=%2Egde_2610061_member_211792857 |year= 2013 |publisher=Ciat.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The participation of all these countries has made it possible to significantly increase and improve CIAT’s chances to meet its purpose of supporting the strengthening and modernization of the tax administrations of its member countries.

It is worth noting that the volume and scope of CIAT activities, as well as the number of member countries and associate member countries from different continents has expanded significantly since its creation, which allows us to assert that our Center is currently the largest and major world organization of tax administrations.As such, it has signed cooperation agreements with the most relevant public and private international entities specialized in tax matters.

Head-offices are located in Panama City, Republic of Panama, and its official languages are Spanish, English, Portuguese and French.

=== Training ===
Training activities are mostly in virtual mode and aim to help improve professional standards of tax administration officials through the design and implementation of training programs according to the need of the member countries tax administrations. 
On line courses are offered in the areas of international taxation, tax administration, Human Resources, political and technical aspects of taxation, tax management. 
*Provide technical assistance in the area of training.
*Promote the exchange of teachers in various areas for face-to-face or virtual training activities.

=== International cooperation ===
Among the main activities carried out by CIAT in this area:
*Working groups: For the design and development of specific products that would support the outline of tax policy and the management of taxes.
*Standing committees: Groups of specialists of tax administrations, which meet regularly and constantly communicate through a platform of virtual communication for discussion of topics of policy and tax administration and the development of products and services. The difference between a Standing Committee and a working group is that the latter ends when it fulfills its purpose.
*Seminars and workshops: To spread good practices and experiences and identify needs and/or demands for the development of future activities of international cooperation.
*Cooperation agreements: Identification of strategic partners. The "strategic partners", may be both organizations and countries, which are identified based on criteria such as the availability of resources to finance technical assistance projects, the potential generation of synergies with the design and execution of studies, training and cooperation activities.
*Study visits and internships: Training officials "in situ" in tax administrations from members countries.

== Member states ==
CIAT is composed of the tax administrations of 39 member countries and associate member countries – 31 countries from the Americas, 5 European countries, 2 African countries and 1 Asian country. South Africa and India are associate members.

The '''International Emergency Economic Powers Act''' ('''IEEPA'''), Title II of {{USStatute|95|223|91|1626|1977|10|28}}, is a [[United States federal law]] authorizing the [[President of the United States|President]] to regulate commerce after declaring a national emergency in response to any unusual and extraordinary threat to the United States which has a foreign source.

The H.R. 7738 [[legislation]] was passed by the United States 95th Congressional session and signed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Jimmy Carter]] on December 28, 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=7071 |title=Jimmy Carter: "Presidential War Powers Bill Statement on Signing H.R. 7738 Into Law.," December 28, 1977 |author1=Peters, Gerhard |author2=Woolley, John T |work=The American Presidency Project |publisher=University of California – Santa Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions==
{{wikisource|International Emergency Economic Powers Act}}
In the [[United States Code]], the IEEPA is Title 50, §§1701–1707.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/chapter-35 50 U.S. Code Chapter 35 - INTERNATIONAL EMERGENCY ECONOMIC POWERS | LII / Legal Information Institute]. Law.cornell.edu. Retrieved on 2014-06-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The IEEPA authorizes the president to declare the existence of an "unusual and extraordinary threat... to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States" that originates "in whole or substantial part outside the United States."&lt;ref&gt;50 U.S.C. §1701(a)&lt;/ref&gt; It further authorizes the president, after such a declaration, to block transactions and freeze assets to deal with the threat.&lt;ref&gt;50 U.S.C. §1702(a)(1)(B)&lt;/ref&gt; In the event of an actual attack on the United States, the president can also confiscate property connected with a country, group, or person that aided in the attack.&lt;ref&gt;50 U.S.C. §1702(a)(1)(C)&lt;/ref&gt;

The IEEPA falls under the provisions of the [[National Emergencies Act|National Emergencies Act (NEA)]], which means that an emergency declared under the act must be renewed annually to remain in effect.

==History==
===Curtailment of emergency executive powers===
Congress enacted the IEEPA in 1977 to clarify and restrict presidential power during times of declared national emergency under the [[Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917]] ("TWEA"). Under TWEA, starting with [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1933, presidents had the power to declare emergencies without limiting their scope or duration, without citing the relevant statutes, and without congressional oversight.&lt;ref&gt;H. Rep. No. 95-459, at 7 (1977) "[the TWEA] has become essentially an unlimited grant of authority for the President to exercise, at his discretion, broad powers in both the domestic and international economic arena, without congressional review.  These powers may be exercised so long as there is an unterminated declaration of national emergency on the books, whether or not the situation with respect to which the emergency was declared bears any relationship to the situation with respect to which the President is using the authorities"&lt;/ref&gt; The [[SCOTUS|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer]]'' limited what a president could do in such an emergency, but did not limit the emergency declaration power itself. A 1973 Senate investigation found (in [[Senate Report 93-549]]) that four declared emergencies remained in effect: the 1933 banking crisis with respect to the hoarding of gold,&lt;ref&gt;[[Executive Order 6102]]&lt;/ref&gt; a 1950 emergency with respect to the [[Korean War]],&lt;ref&gt;Executive Proclamation 2914, http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=13684&lt;/ref&gt; a 1970 emergency regarding the [[U.S. postal strike of 1970|postal workers strike]], and a 1971 emergency [[Nixon Shock|in response]] to the government's deteriorating economic and fiscal conditions.&lt;ref&gt;S. Rep. No. 93-549, at 2 (1973), http://www.ncrepublic.org/images/lib/SenateReport93_549.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Congress terminated these emergencies with the [[National Emergencies Act]], and then passed the IEEPA to restore the emergency power in a limited, overseeable form.

Unlike TWEA, IEEPA was drafted to permit presidential emergency declarations only in response to threats originating outside the United States.&lt;ref&gt;50 U.S.C. §1701(a)&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning with [[Jimmy Carter]] in response to the [[Iran Hostage Crisis]], presidents have invoked IEEPA to safeguard U.S. national security interests by freezing or "blocking" assets of belligerent foreign governments,&lt;ref&gt;[[Executive Order 12170]], 44 C.F.R. 65,729&lt;/ref&gt; or certain foreign nationals abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Exec. Order No. 12,978, 60 C.F.R. 54,579 (1995) (blocking the assets of certain Colombian narcotics traffickers)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since 9/11===
Following the [[9/11]] terrorist attacks, President [[George W. Bush]] issued [[Executive Order 13224]] under IEEPA to block the assets of terrorist organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Exec. Order. No. 13224, Sec. 1(a), http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2001-09-25/pdf/01-24205.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The President delegated blocking authority to federal agencies led by the [[U.S. Treasury]]. In October 2001, Congress passed the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] which, in part, enhanced the IEEPA asset blocking provisions under §1702(a)(1)(B) to permit the blocking of assets during the "pendency of an investigation." This statutory change gave the Treasury's [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] the power to block assets without the need to provide evidence of the blocking subject's wrongdoing nor to permit the blocking subject a chance to effectively respond to the allegations in court.&lt;ref&gt;''Kindhearts v. Geithner'', 647 F. Supp. 2d 857, 866, ND Ohio 2009, https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10931539635102900344&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,14&amp;as_vis=1&lt;/ref&gt; Executing these blocking actions led to a series of legal cases challenging federal authority to indefinitely prevent charitable organizations from accessing their assets held in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., id.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Litigation==
===Notable cases===
* ''[[Dames &amp; Moore v. Regan]]''
* ''[[KindHearts for Charitable Humanitarian Development]] v. Geithner''&lt;ref&gt;KindHearts v. Geithner, ''supra''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violations===
{{wikinewspar|Man arrested for broadcasting Hezbollah television in New York}}
*In 1983, financier [[Marc Rich]] was accused of violating the act by trading in Iranian oil during the [[Iran hostage crisis]]. He was one of [[List of people pardoned by Bill Clinton|many people]] [[pardon]]ed by President [[Bill Clinton]] in his last days in office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/pardon/clintonpardon_grants.htm USDOJ: Office of the Pardon Attorney: Clemency Recipients]. Justice.gov. Retrieved on 2014-06-16.&lt;/ref&gt;
*On August 23, 2006, Javed Iqbal was arrested through the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Department of the Treasury]] with a charge of [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to violate the IEEPA for airing material produced by [[al-Manar]] (The Beacon) in [[New York City]] during the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= New York Man Charged With Enabling Hezbollah Television Broadcasts | date= 2006-08-25 | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/25/nyregion/25tv.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Timothy | last1=Williams | first2=William K. | last2=Rashbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On December 16, 2009, it was announced that the [[U.S. Dept. of Justice]] reached a settlement with [[Credit Suisse]] over accusations that the bank assisted residents of IEEPA sanctioned countries to wire money in violation of the Act from 1995 to 2006. The settlement resulted in Credit Suisse forfeiting $536 million.&lt;ref&gt;Press Release, U.S. Dept. of Justice, Credit Suisse Agrees to Forfeit $536 Million in Connection with Violations of the International Emergency Powers Act and New York State Law (Dec. 16, 2009) http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2009/December/09-ag-1358.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Iron Gates Mesolithic''' is a [[Mesolithic]] [[archaeological culture]], dating to between 11,000 and 3,500 years BCE, in the [[Iron Gates]] region of the [[Danube River]], in modern [[Romania]] and [[Serbia]].

Major sites within this archaeological complex include [[Lepenski Vir]]. Stages at this site dated at [[circa|c.]] 6300–6000 BCE have been described as "the first city in Europe",&lt;ref name="Politika"&gt; Pavlović, 20 August 2017, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; due to its permanency, organisation, as well as the sophistication of its [[architecture]] and construction techniques.&lt;ref name="Politika1"&gt;Pavlović, 23 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Rusu, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Lepenski Vir consists of one large settlement with around 10 satellite villages. Numerous piscine sculptures and peculiar architecture have been found at the site.

'''Kabul Rock''', 108.0 FM is a rock station in [[Kabul]], Afghanistan, playing music ranging from 1950s' [[rockabilly]] to modern [[Rock music|rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|metal]].

==Range==
Its base stations have been attacked and threatened by [[insurgent]]s, and thus are very well hidden and not known to many.  It can be heard within greater Kabul and most of the way to [[Bagram]], where the signal fades.

The '''Kingdom of Kush''' or '''Kush''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ʊ|ʃ|,_|k|ʌ|ʃ}}) was an ancient kingdom in [[Nubia]], located at the [[Sudan]]ese and southern [[Egypt]]ian [[Nile Valley]].

The Kushite era of rule in Nubia was established after the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]] and the disintegration of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]]. Kush was centered at [[Napata]] during its early phase. After [[Kashta]] ("the Kushite") invaded Egypt in the 8th century BC, the [[List of monarchs of Kush|monarchs of Kush]] were also the [[pharaoh]]s of the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt]], until they were expelled by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] under the rule of [[Esarhaddon]] a century later.

During [[classical antiquity]], the Kushite imperial capital was located at [[Meroë]]. In early Greek geography, the Meroitic kingdom was known as [[Aethiopia]]. The Kingdom of Kush with its capital at Meroe persisted until the 4th century AD, when it weakened and disintegrated due to internal rebellion. The seat was eventually captured and burnt to the ground by the [[Kingdom of Aksum]]. Afterwards the [[Nubians]] established the three, eventually [[Christianity|Christianized]], kingdoms of [[Nobatia]], [[Makuria]] and [[Alodia]].

The native name of the Kingdom was recorded in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] as ''{{lang|egy|k3š}}'', likely pronounced /'''kuɫuʃ/''''' ''or '''/kuʔuʃ/''''' ''in [[Middle Egyptian language|Middle Egyptian]] when the term is first used for Nubia, based on the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]]-era [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] transliteration as the genitive ''kūsi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldenberg|first=David M.|chapter=|title=The Curse of Ham: Race and Slavery in Early Judaism, Christianity, and Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iTyJ3HiNOAsC&amp;pg=PA144#v=onepage&amp;q=burnt%20swarthy%20black&amp;f=false |year=2005|edition=New|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691123707|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Esarhaddon and Egypt: An Analysis of the First Invasion of Egypt|last = Spalinger|first = Anthony|date = 1974|journal = Orientalia, NOVA SERIES, Vol. 43 pp. 295-326, XI|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Ancient Egyptian Language: An Historical Study|url = https://books.google.com/?id=Gd6aAAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=ancient+egyptian+allen|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 2013-07-11|access-date = 2015-04-15|isbn = 9781107032460|first = James P.|last = Allen|page = 53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also an ethnic term for the native population who initiated the kingdom of Kush. The term is also displayed in the names of Kushite persons,&lt;ref&gt;Török, László. Der Nahe und Mittlere Osten. BRILL, 1997. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; such as King [[Kashta]] (a transcription of ''k3š-t3'' "(one from) the land of Kush"). Geographically, Kush referred to the region south of the [[first cataract]] in general. Kush also was the home of the rulers of the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|25th dynasty]].&lt;ref name="Van 2011"&gt;Van, de M. M. A History of Ancient Egypt. Chichester, West Sussex: Wiley-Blackwell, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Kush'', since at least the time of [[Josephus]], has been connected with the biblical character [[Cush (Bible)|Cush]], in the [[Hebrew Bible]] (Hebrew: כוש), son of [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]] (Genesis 10:6). Ham had four sons named: Cush, Put, Canaan and Mizraim (Hebrew name for Egypt). According to the Bible, [[Nimrod]], a son of Cush, was the founder and king of [[Babylon]], [[Uruk|Erech]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]] and [[Calneh]], in [[Shinar]] (Gen 10:10).&lt;ref name="kingjamesbibleonline.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Genesis-10-10/|title=GENESIS 10:10 KJV "And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar."|website=www.kingjamesbibleonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bible also makes reference to someone named Cush who is a [[Tribe of Benjamin|Benjamite]] (Psalms 7:1, KJV).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Psalms-Chapter-7/|title=PSALMS CHAPTER 7 KJV|website=www.kingjamesbibleonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern scholars, such as [[Friedrich Delitzsch]],&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Delitzsch, ''Wo lag das Paradies?'', 1881.&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that the biblical Cush might be linked to the [[Kassites]] of the [[Zagros Mountains]] (modern Iran).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldenberg|first=David M.|chapter=|title=The Curse of Ham: Race and Slavery in Early Judaism, Christianity, and Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iTyJ3HiNOAsC&amp;pg=PA144#v=onepage&amp;q=burnt%20swarthy%20black&amp;f=false |year=2005|edition=New|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691123707|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
=== Origins ===
[[File:Anlamani-Statue-CloseUpOfHead MuseumOfFineArtsBoston.png|thumb|upright|Statue of the Kushite pharaoh [[Aspelta]], [[Napata]] period (c. 620–580 BC)]]
[[Mentuhotep II]], the 21st century BC founder of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], is recorded to have undertaken campaigns against Kush in the 29th and 31st years of his reign. This is the earliest Egyptian reference to ''Kush''; the [[Nubia]]n region had gone by other names in the Old Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Dictionary of Ancient and Medieval Nubia'', Richard A. Lobban Jr., p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Thutmose I]], Egypt made several campaigns south.&lt;ref&gt;De Mola, Paul J. "Interrelations of Kerma and Pharaonic Egypt". Ancient History Encyclopedia: http://www.ancient.eu/article/487/&lt;/ref&gt; This eventually resulted in their annexation of Nubia circa 1504 BC. After the conquest, Kerma culture was increasingly Egyptianized, yet rebellions continued for 220 years until c. 1300 BC. During the New Kingdom, Nubia nevertheless became a key province of the New Kingdom, economically, politically and spiritually. Indeed, major Pharonic ceremonies were held at Jebel Barkal near Napata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jebelbarkal.org/|title=Jebal Barkal: History and Archaeology of Ancient Napata|accessdate=21 March 2012|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AmeGLI5N?url=http://www.jebelbarkal.org/|archive-date=19 September 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an Egyptian colony from the 16th century BC, Nubia ("Kush") was governed by an Egyptian [[Viceroy of Kush]]. With the disintegration of the New Kingdom around 1070 BC, ''Kush'' became an independent kingdom centered at [[Napata]] in modern northern Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;Morkot, Roger G. "On the Priestly Origin of the Napatan Kings: The Adaptation, Demise and Resurrection of Ideas in Writing Nubian History" in O'Connor, David and Andrew Reid, eds. ''Ancient Egypt in Africa (Encounters with Ancient Egypt) (University College London Institute of Archaeology Publications)'' Left Coast Press (1 Aug 2003) {{ISBN|978-1-59874-205-3}} p.151&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent of cultural/political continuity between the [[Kerma culture]] and the chronologically succeeding Kingdom of Kush is difficult to determine. The latter polity began to emerge around 1000 BC, 500 years after the end of the Kingdom of Kerma. By 1200 BC, Egyptian involvement in the Dongola Reach was nonexistent. By the [[8th century BC]], the new Kushite kingdom emerged from the Napata region of the upper Dongola Reach. The first Napatan king, Alara, dedicated his sister to the cult of [[Amun]] at the rebuilt [[Kawa (Sudan)|Kawa]] temple, while temples were also rebuilt at Barkal and Kerma. A Kashta [[stele]] at [[Elephantine]], places the Kushites on the Egyptian frontier by the mid-eighteenth century. This first period of the kingdom's history, the 'Napatan', was succeeded by the 'Meroitic', when the royal cemeteries relocated to Meroe around 300 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Edwards |first1=David |title=The Nubian Past |date=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location=Oxon |isbn=9780415369886 |pages=2,75,112,114-117,120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kushites buried their monarchs along with all their courtiers in mass graves. Archaeologists refer to these practices as the "Pan-grave culture".&lt;ref&gt;[http://archaeology.about.com/od/pterms/g/pangrave.htm Pan Grave Culture] – By K. Kris Hirst&lt;/ref&gt; This was given its name due to the way in which the remains are buried. They would dig a pit and put stones around them in a circle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.numibia.net/nubia/c-group2.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024115915/http://www.numibia.net/nubia/c-group2.htm |date=2013-10-24 }} – By Manfred Bietak&lt;/ref&gt; Kushites also built burial mounds and [[Nubian pyramids|pyramids]], and shared some of the same gods worshiped in Egypt, especially Ammon and Isis. With the worshiping of these gods the Kushites began to take some of the names of the gods as their throne names.&lt;ref name="Van 2011"/&gt;

The Kush rulers were regarded as guardians of the state religion and were responsible for maintaining the houses of the gods. Some scholars{{who|date=December 2013}} believe the economy in the Kingdom of Kush was a redistributive system. The state would collect taxes in the form of surplus produce and would redistribute to the people. Others believe that most of the society worked on the land and required nothing from the state and did not contribute to the state. Northern Kush seemed to be more productive and wealthier than the Southern area.&lt;ref name="Welsby, Derek A 1998"&gt;Welsby, Derek A. The Kingdom of Kush: the Napatan and Meroitic Empires.

Dental trait analysis of fossils dating from the Meroitic period in [[Semna (Nubia)|Semna]], Nubia, found that they were closely related to [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]]-speaking populations inhabiting the [[Nile]], [[Horn of Africa]], [[Maghreb]] and [[Canary Islands]]. The Meroitic skeletons and these ancient and recent fossils were also phenotypically distinct from those belonging to recent [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo]], [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] and [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan]]-speaking populations in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], as well as from the [[Mesolithic]] inhabitants of [[Jebel Sahaba]] in Nubia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Irish|first1=Joel D.|title=Dental morphological affinities of Late Pleistocene through recent sub-Saharan and north African peoples|journal=Bulletins et Mémoires de la Société d'anthropologie de Paris|date=1998|volume=10|issue=3|pages=237–272|url=http://www.persee.fr/docAsPDF/bmsap_0037-8984_1998_num_10_3_2517.pdf|accessdate=17 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conquest of Egypt ([[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|25th Dynasty]]) ===
{{Main article|Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt}}
[[File:Kushite empire 700bc.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Maximum extent of Kush in 700 BC]]
Resistance to the early eighteenth Dynasty Egyptian rule by neighbouring Kush is evidenced in the writings of [[Ahmose, son of Ebana]], an Egyptian warrior who served under Nebpehtrya Ahmose (1539-1514 BC), Djeserkara Amenhotep I (1514–1493 BC) and Aakheperkara Thutmose I (1493–1481 BC). At the end of the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]] (mid-sixteenth century BC), Egypt faced the twin existential threats—the [[Hyksos]] in the North and the Kushites in the South. Taken from the autobiographical inscriptions on the walls of his tomb-chapel, the Egyptians undertook campaigns to defeat Kush and conquer Nubia under the rule of [[Amenhotep I]] (1514–1493 BC). In Ahmose's writings, the Kushites are described as [[archery|archers]], "Now after his Majesty had slain the Bedoin of Asia, he sailed upstream to Upper Nubia to destroy the Nubian bowmen."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Writings from Ancient Egypt|last=Wilkinson|first=Toby|publisher=Penguin Classics|year=2016|isbn=978-0-141-39595-1|location=United Kingdom|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tomb writings contain two other references to the Nubian bowmen of Kush.

Egypt's international prestige had declined considerably towards the end of the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]]. Its historical allies, the inhabitants of [[Canaan]], had fallen to the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365-1020 BC), and then the resurgent [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (935–605 BC). The [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], from the 10th century BC onwards, had once more expanded from northern [[Mesopotamia]], and conquered a vast empire, including the whole of the [[Near East]], and much of [[Anatolia]], the eastern [[Mediterranean]], the [[Caucasus]] and [[History of Iran#Early Iron Age|early Iron Age Iran]].

In 945 BC, [[Shoshenq I]] and [[Libu]] princes took control of the Nile Delta and founded the [[Twenty-second Dynasty of Egypt]], also known as the Libyan or Bubastite dynasty, which would rule for some 200&amp;nbsp;years. Shoshenq also gained control of southern Egypt by placing his family members in important priestly positions. In 711, Shoshenq made [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] his northern capital.&lt;ref&gt;Van, de M. M. A History of Ancient Egypt. Chichester, West Sussex: Wiley-Blackwell, 2011. p289. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Libyan control began to erode as a rival dynasty in the delta arose in [[Leontopolis]] and Kushites threatened from the south.

[[Alara of Nubia|Alara]] founded the [[Napata#Napatan period|Napatan]], or 25th, Kushite dynasty at Napata in [[Nubia]], now Sudan. Alara's successor [[Kashta]] extended Kushite control north to [[Elephantine]] and [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] in [[Upper Egypt]]. Kashta's successor [[Piye#Piye's Conquest of Egypt|Piye seized control of Lower Egypt]] around 727&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw (2002) p. 345&lt;/ref&gt; Piye's 'Victory Stela', celebrating these campaigns between 728-716 BC, was found in the Amun temple at Jebel Barkal.

Why the Kushites chose to enter Egypt at this crucial point of foreign domination is subject to debate. Archaeologist Timothy Kendall offers his own hypotheses, connecting it to a claim of legitimacy associated with [[Jebel Barkal]].&lt;ref name="Kendall, T.K. 2002"&gt;Kendall, T.K., 2002. Napatan Temples: a Case Study from Gebel Barkal. The Mythological Nubian Origin of Egyptian Kingship and the Formation of the Napatan State. Tenth International Conference of Nubian Studies. Rome, September 9–14, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Kendall cites the Victory Stele of Piye at Jebel Barkal, which states that "[[Amun]] of Napata granted me to be ruler of every foreign country," and "Amun in Thebes granted me to be ruler of the Black Land ([[Km (hieroglyph)#km.t|Kmt]])". According to Kendall, "foreign lands" in this regard seems to include Lower Egypt while "Kmt" seems to refer to a united Upper Egypt and Nubia.&lt;ref name="Kendall, T.K. 2002"/&gt;

Piye's successor, [[Shabaqo]], defeated the Saite kings of northern Egypt between 711-710 BC, and installed himself as king in [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]. He then established ties with [[Sargon II]].&lt;ref name=David/&gt;{{rp|120}}

Piye's son [[Taharqa]] enjoyed some minor initial success in his attempts to regain Egyptian influence in the Near East. He aided King [[Hezekiah]] from attack by [[Sennacherib]] and the Assyrians (2 Kings 19:9; Isaiah 37:9), however disease among the besieging Assyrian army appears to have been the main cause of failure to take [[Jerusalem]] rather than any military setback, and Assyrian records indicate Hezekiah was forced to pay tribute. The Assyrian King Sennacherib then defeated [[Taharqa]] and drove the Nubians and Egyptians from the region and back over the Sinai into Egypt.

Taharqa initially defeated the Assyrians, when war broke out in 674 BC. Yet, in 671 BC, the Assyrian King [[Esarhaddon]], took Memphis, and Taharqo retreated to the south, while his heir and other family members were taken to Assyria as prisoners. However, the native Egyptian vassal rulers installed by Esarhaddon as puppets were unable to effectively retain full control, and Taharqa was able regain control of Memphis. Esarhaddon's 669 BC campaign to once more eject Taharqa, was abandoned when Esarhaddon died in Palestine on the way to Egypt. Yet, Esarhaddon's successor, [[Ashurbanipal]], did defeat Taharqa, and Taharqa died soon after.&lt;ref name=David/&gt;{{rp|121}}

Taharqa's successor [[Tantamani]] attempted to regain Egypt. He successfully defeated [[Necho I|Necho]], the subject ruler installed by Ashurbanipal, taking Thebes in the process. The Assyrians, who had a military presence in the north, then sent a large army southwards in 663 BC. Tantamani was routed, and the Assyrian army sacked Thebes to such an extent it never truly recovered. Tantamani was chased back to Nubia, and never threatened the Assyrian Empire again. A native Egyptian ruler, [[Psamtik I]], was placed on the throne, as a vassal of Ashurbanipal.&lt;ref name="Török, László 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux – Ancient Iraq pp. 330–332&lt;/ref&gt; The last links between Kush and Upper Egypt were severed after hostilities with the Saite kings in the 590s BC.&lt;ref name=David/&gt;{{rp|121-122}}

===Napatan period===
[[File:Reliefs in Persepolis نگاره های تخت جمشید 05.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Kushite delegation on a Persian relief from the [[Apadana]] palace ({{circa}} 500 BC)]]
[[Aspelta]] moved the capital to [[Meroë]], considerably farther south than [[Napata]], possibly in 591 BC.&lt;ref name="Ohaegbulam1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Festus Ugboaja Ohaegbulam|title=Towards an understanding of the African experience from historical and contemporary perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GX1fNzyNO5AC&amp;pg=PA66|access-date=17 March 2011|date=1 October 1990|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-8191-7941-8|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible that Meroë had always been the Kushite capital.

[[Martin Meredith]] states the Kushite rulers chose Meroë, between the [[Cataracts of the Nile|Fifth and Sixth Cataracts]], because it was on the fringe of the summer rainfall belt, and the area was rich in iron ore and hardwood for [[iron working]]. The location also afforded access to trade routes to the [[Red Sea]]. The Kush traded iron products with the Romans, in addition to gold, ivory and slaves. Yet, the [[Butana]] plain was stripped of its forests, leaving behind [[slag]] piles.&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;{{cite book |last1=Meredith |first1=Martin |title=The Fortunes of Africa |date=2014 |publisher=Public Affairs |location=New York |isbn=9781610396356 |page=43-44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shillington |first1=Kevin |title=History of Africa |date=2012 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=London |isbn=9780230308473 |pages=50-51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kushites used the animal-driven water wheel to increase productivity and create a surplus, particularly during the Napatan-Meroitic Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;William Y. Adams, Nubia: Corridor to Africa (Princeton University Press, 1977) 346-47, and William Y. Adams,&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herodotus]] mentioned an invasion of Kush by the [[Achaemenid]] ruler [[Cambyses II|Cambyses]] (circa 530 BC), who possibly succeeded in occupying the area between the [[Cataracts of the Nile|first and second Nile cataract]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dandamaev |first1=M.

===Meroitic period===
[[File:Sudan Meroe Pyramids 30sep2005 2.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|The pyramids of Meroe – [[UNESCO]] World Heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1073|title=Gebel Barkal and the Sites of the Napatan Region|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=whc.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In about 300 BC the move to Meroë was made more complete when the [[monarchs]] began to be buried there, instead of at Napata. One theory is that this represents the monarchs breaking away from the power of the priests at Napata. According to [[Diodorus Siculus]], a Kushite king, "[[Ergamenes]]", defied the priests and had them slaughtered. This story may refer to the first ruler to be buried at Meroë with a similar name such as [[Arqamani]],&lt;ref&gt;Fage, J. D.: Roland Anthony Oliver (1979) ''The Cambridge History of Africa'', Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-21592-7}} p. 228 [https://books.google.com/books?id=hb8YXTINiDMC&amp;pg=PA228&amp;dq=Ergamenes+is+Arqamani]&lt;/ref&gt; who ruled many years after the royal cemetery was opened at Meroë. During this same period, Kushite authority may have extended some 1,500&amp;nbsp;km along the Nile River valley from the Egyptian frontier in the north to areas far south of modern Khartoum and probably also substantial territories to the east and west.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, page 141&lt;/ref&gt;

Kushite civilization continued for several centuries. In the Napatan Period Egyptian hieroglyphs were used: at this time writing seems to have been restricted to the court and temples. From the 2nd century BC there was a separate Meroitic writing system. This was an alphabetic script with 23 signs used in a hieroglyphic form (mainly on monumental art) and in a cursive form. The latter was widely used; so far some 1278 texts using this version are known (Leclant 2000). The script was deciphered by Griffith, but the language behind it is still a problem, with only a few words understood by modern scholars. It is not as yet possible to connect the Meroitic language with other known languages.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/nubia/mwriting.html|title=Meroitic script|website=www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson, "The Arab Dynasty of Dar For (Darfur): Part II", ''Journal of the Royal African Society'' (Lond). XXVIII: 55–67 (October, 1928)]&lt;/ref&gt; Remarkably, the destruction of the capital of Napata was not a crippling blow to the Kushites and did not frighten Candace enough to prevent her from again engaging in combat with the Roman military. Indeed, it seems that [[Gaius Petronius|Petronius's]] attack might have had a revitalizing influence on the kingdom. Just three years later, in 22 BC, a large Kushite force moved northward with intention of attacking Qasr Ibrim.{{r|jackson2002}}{{rp|149}}
[[File:Lion temple relief, Naga (Sudan).jpg|thumb|260px|Copy of relief from [[Naqa]] depicting [[Amanitore]] (second from left), [[Natakamani]] (second from right) and two princes approaching a three-headed [[Apedemak]].]]
Alerted to the advance, Petronius again marched south and managed to reach Qasr Ibrim and bolster its defences before the invading Kushites arrived. Although the ancient sources give no description of the ensuing battle, we know that at some point the Kushites sent ambassadors to negotiate a peace settlement with Petronius. By the end of the second campaign, however, Petronius was in no mood to deal further with the Kushites.{{r|jackson2002}}{{rp|149}} The Kushites succeeded in negotiating a peace treaty on favourable terms&lt;ref name="afraf.oxfordjournals.org"/&gt; and trade between the two nations increased.{{r|jackson2002}}{{rp|149}} Some historians like [[Theodore Mommsen]] wrote that during [[Augustus]] times Nubia was a possible [[client state]] of the [[Roman Empire]].

The [[Meroitic language]] was spoken in Meroë and the Sudan during the Meroitic period (attested from 300 BC). It became extinct about 400 AD. The language was written in two forms of the [[Meroitic alphabet]]: Meroitic Cursive, which was written with a [[stylus]] and was used for general record-keeping; and Meroitic Hieroglyphic, which was carved in stone or used for royal or religious documents. It is not well understood due to the scarcity of [[bilingual]] texts. The earliest inscription in Meroitic writing dates from between 180–170 BC. These hieroglyphics were found engraved on the temple of Queen [[Shanakdakhete]]. Meroitic Cursive is written horizontally, and reads from right to left like all Semitic orthographies.&lt;ref name="Howf"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fischer|first1=Steven Roger|title=History of Writing|date=2004|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=1861895887|pages=133–134|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=iYMXnSko5QwC|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 3rd century BC, a new indigenous alphabet, the [[Meroitic alphabet|Meroitic]], consisting of twenty-three letters, replaced Egyptian script. Meroitic is an [[alphabet]] originally derived from [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] that was used to write the Meroitic language of the Kingdom of Meroë/Kush. It was developed in the Napatan Period (about 700–300 BCE), and first appears in the second century BCE. For a time, it was also possibly used to write the [[Old Nubian language]] of the successor Nubian kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/nubia/mwriting.html |title="Meroe: Writing", '&amp;#39;Digital Egypt,'&amp;#39; University College, London |publisher=Digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is uncertain to which language family the Meroitic language is related. Claude Rilly has proposed that it, like the [[Nobiin language]], belongs to the [[Eastern Sudanic languages|Eastern Sudanic]] branch of the [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authors = Rilly, Claude &amp; de Voogt, Alex | year = 2012 | title = The Meroitic Language and Writing System | location = Cambridge, UK | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 1107008662 | url = | access-date =  | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rilly, Claude | year = 2004 | url = http://www.ddl.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/projets/clhass/PageWeb/ressources/Isolats/Meroitic%20Rilly%202004.pdf | title = The Linguistic Position of Meroitic | journal = Sudan Electronic Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirsty Rowan suggests that Meroitic, like the [[Egyptian language]], instead belongs to the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] family. She bases this on its sound inventory and [[phonotactics]], which are similar to those of the Afro-Asiatic languages and dissimilar from those of the Nilo-Saharan languages.&lt;ref&gt;Rowan, Kirsty (2011). "Meroitic Consonant and Vowel Patterning".

== Kush and Egyptology ==
On account of the Kingdom of Kush's proximity to [[Ancient Egypt]] — the [[first cataract]] at [[Elephantine]] usually being considered the traditional border between the two [[Polity|polities]] — and because the 25th dynasty ruled over both states in the 8th century BC, from the Rift Valley to the Taurus mountains, historians have closely associated the study of Kush with Egyptology, in keeping with the general assumption that the complex sociopolitical development of Egypt's neighbours can be understood in terms of Egyptian models.&lt;ref name="edwards 1998"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2F22648_C6A5D4D0922E24022C27DEA7035B07DB_journals__AFH_AFH39_02_S002185379700717Xa.pdf&amp;cover=Y&amp;code=2a79b8f52131a8547fc0936b8a4b398c|title=David N. Edwards, "Meroe and the Sudanic Kingdoms", "Journal of African History" (UK). Vol. 39 No. 2 (1998), pp 175–193|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the political structure and organization of Kush as an independent ancient state has not received as thorough attention from scholars, and there remains much ambiguity especially surrounding the earliest periods of the state. Edwards&lt;ref name="edwards 1998"/&gt; has suggested that study of the region could benefit from increased recognition of Kush as a state in its own right, with distinct cultural conditions, rather than merely as a secondary state on the periphery of Egypt.

In 1951 it was purchased by King [[Zog of Albania]] for approximately $102,800. It was rumoured that Zog bought the mansion with a bucket of diamonds and rubies. Although Zog intended the estate to be his kingdom-in-exile, staffed by [[Albania]]n subjects, he never moved in.   Rumours spread of Zog's riches being hidden in the mansion, and various looters ransacked the house, it fell into total ruin.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.lioddities.com/Bygone/zogs.htm |title=King Zog's Ruins |publisher=lioddities.com |accessdate=2009-01-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080801111654/http://www.lioddities.com/Bygone/zogs.htm |archivedate=2008-08-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zog's parliament sold the estate in 1955.  The local county works department of Oyster Bay pulled down the ruins of the home in 1959, for reasons of safety.  A garden pavilion remained for many years, progressively vandalized, until it was razed to its foundation, also for safety reasons.  The most visible present remains of the estate are the remnants of a double staircase to the old formal gardens, where traces of landscaping remain, some walkways disappearing under fallen litter and leaves, the pillars and entablatures of a pair of kiosks, and the gate structure at the old entrance to the grounds.

The ruins of the mansion's gardens and grounds are now part of the Muttontown Preserve, with the gated entrance located on Jericho-Oyster Bay Road (Route 106).

'''Kontrol''' are a [[Bulgaria]]n punk band. Initially active between 1988 and 2000, they achieved stardom in the early 1990s with their first two albums, ''Bumm'' (1991) and ''Lele kako'' (1993). In 1997, their lead singer Nikolai Yordanov left and the band's popularity declined, which led to their dissolution in 2000. They reformed in their original lineup in 2009 for a short Bulgarian tour, then reformed in 2014 with a new lead singer, Ivan Gatev.

== History ==
The band was formed in 1988 and were one of the first official punk bands in the country. Their first recordings, "Tryabva vsichko da priemam" and "Nai-vazhnoto", were for the 1988 film "Pred praga" (At the Doorstep). Later that year, they released a demo tape called ''[[Stariyat dub]]''. The tape contained 8 songs.

In 1989, they were signed to Balkanton and released a split LP with [[Nova Generacia]]. The Kontrol side consisted of the first six songs from ''Stariyat dub''. They then performed at the ''Svyat - chudni hora'' festival in [[Michurina (rural locality)|Michurin]]. The first song they played, "Ima" (originally released on ''Stariyat dub'') appeared on the official compilation in 1990.

In 1990, they recorded 15 songs at the BNR Studio II. After the fall of communism, 14 of the tracks were released on the ''[[BUMM]]'' cassette in 1991.

In 1992, they recorded their second album, ''[[Lele kako]]'', released in 1993. They also released the ''[[88-92]]'' compilation. The A-side consisted of the ''Pred praga'' tracks, an unreleased track called "Bulgaria" and the six songs from the ''BG Rock I'' split. The B-side consisted of songs from ''BUMM'' and ''Lele kako''. That year, ''BUMM'' was also reissued on cassette by Lazarov Records with the ''Pred praga'' songs and an unreleased version of ''Ne umirahme ot shtastie''.

The band released their third album, ''[[LyubOFF]]'', in 1994. In 1996, they released a concert album called ''[[Punku nema'a umre]]''.

In 1998, founder Nikolai Yordanov left the band and was replaced by Petar Stanoev. With Stanoev, they released their fourth and final album, ''[[Pazete si decata]]'' in 1999. The band broke up a year later.

In 2004, the compilation ''Te t'va e'' was released, containing 22 songs from the Nikolai Yordanov period. In 2006, they recorded a song called "Urok po tanci".

In 2009, they embarked on a short tour of Bulgaria with [[Revyu]] and [[Hipodil]].

In 2014, the band reformed with new singer Ivan Gatev. Their new album ''9'' was released in April 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1016">'''Lancers''' is a brand of medium-sweet, lightly [[sparkling wine]] produced by the J. M. da Fonseca [[winery]] in [[Portugal (wine)|Portugal]]. The brand was created in 1944, when Vintage Wines of New York predicted that wine consumption in the United States would increase after [[World War II]].

A sparkling Lancers, made by the continuous method, was introduced in the late 1980s. It was originally sold in distinctive squat bottles made of rust-colored, opaque crockery rather than clear glass.

The '''Medal for Heroic Deeds''' was instituted by royal resolution on 19 August 1885 and is awarded for honorable actions in saving lives or a comparable act. There was originally three classes, but from [[1905 in Norway#Overview|1905]] the medal has been awarded in gold and silver.&lt;ref&gt;[http://snl.no/Medaljen_for_edel_d%C3%A5d Medaljen for edel dåd] ''[[Store norske leksikon]]''. Retrieved 22 October 2013 {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be awarded in gold the recipient must have committed an unusually notable rescue of life where the rescuer's life was put at risk. The medal is surmountet by the [[Crown of Norway]] and the adverse side features the portrait, name and title of the reigning monarch. At present the portrait is of King [[Harald V of Norway]] and the inscription reads «Harald den 5, Norges Konge» (''Harald the fifth, King of Norway''). The reverse features an oak reaf and the words «For edel dåd» (''For noble deed''). The ribbon is in the [[national colours]] of Norway: red, white and blue.

'''''Moseka''''' is a 1971 documentary film.

== Synopsis ==
Moseka, a young woman from [[Zaire]], travels to Europe to study. With her braided hair and traditional clothes, she is the laughingstock of her fellow students who strive to look European, adopting wigs and European clothing. The film tells of the depersonalization of young Africans when they enter into contact with the European culture. In this sense, the film fits into the "[[Authenticité (Zaire)|authenticity policy]]" of [[Mobutu]].&lt;ref name=" Ndombasi"&gt;{{cite book | title=Le cinéma du congo Démocratique | author=Ndombasi, Gansa | year=2008 | isbn=978-2-296-06204-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ts1ZNqKWqGMC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=Moseka+film&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-jBeT_3NO-jm0QHmt5SECg&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Moseka%20film&amp;f=false | chapter=Les films zairois|pages=37–40|language=French|accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was closed in 2006 because of lack of funding and a new team led by Adjiman Nandoh Chantal has been at work since February 2008 and aims to restore and renew the institution. As of October 2009, 85% of the building is still closed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1041">The '''Oddaverjar''' were among the most powerful family clans in the medieval [[Icelandic Commonwealth]]. They were based in [[Oddi]] at [[Rangárvellir]] in South Iceland. Their ascendancy was during the second half of the 12th century, but their power subsequently waned.  They play only a minor role in the Icelandic civil war during the [[Age of the Sturlungs]].  Only after the signing of the ''[[Old Covenant (Iceland)|Gamli sáttmáli]]'' ("Old Covenant") did they oppose the influence of [[Gissur Þorvaldsson]], Earl of Iceland.

The Oddverjar traced their roots to the first Icelandic settlers.  The first known Oddaverji was ''[[Sæmundur Sigfússon]] fróði''  ("Sæmundur The Knowledgeable"), an early 12th century scholar.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3953">:''This article is about the Scandinavian satellite operator.  See also [[Sirius Satellite Radio]].''

'''SES Sirius''', formerly called '''Nordic Satellite AB''' (NSAB) was the owner and operator of the two [[Sirius (satellite)|Sirius]] satellites, which provide the [[Nordic countries]] and the [[Baltic state]]s, with TV, radio, data and communications solutions. The company is today entirely owned and controlled by [[SES S.A.|SES]] and has no independent existence.

The 2004 SES Annual Report states that 16.4 million homes received broadcast and broadband services from the Sirius system, 1.5 million from the satellites directly and another 14.9 million from cable networks distributing content via Sirius.

==History==
In 1982 the governments of Sweden and Norway formed NSAB as part of a wide ranging partnership for the purpose of "telecommunication satellite cooperation". In 1989 the two governments agreed to end their partnership, the Swedish government assumed full ownership with the acquisition of Norway's 15% share.

On April 2, 1989 NSAB's first satellite, the [[Aérospatiale]] built [[Tele-X]], was launched on an [[Ariane 2]] rocket from French Guiana. The Swedish Space Corporation (SSC) was contracted to operate the TELE-X system and in 1993 the company acquired the Swedish government's shares, becoming the sole owner.

In late 1993 NSAB acquired Marco Polo 1, a [[Boeing Satellite Systems|Hughes 376]] geostationary communications satellite, from British Sky Broadcasting. Marco Polo 1 was built for and operated by [[British Satellite Broadcasting]]. However following that company's collapse it merged with Sky Television to form BSkyB. In this "merger" Sky was the dominant force and their system of transponder lease from SES' [[Astra (satellites)|Astra]] satellites was maintained. Marco Polo 1 (and its sister satellite) were gradually withdrawn from service.

In February 1994 [[Teracom]] acquired a 50% share of NSAB. The same month Marco Polo 1 re-entered service as Sirius 1 at 5°E. In July 1994 NSAB agreed the purchase of Sirius 2 from Aérospatiale (later [[Alcatel Space]]). The satellite was successfully launched on November 12, 1997 by [[Ariane 4]] rocket. Shortly after launch SES signed a lease agreement for all transponders on the satellite.

In 1996 [[Tele Danmark]] acquired a 25% share in NSAB from Teracom.

In May 1997 NSAB ordered a Hughes 376HP, the satellite was successfully launched on October 5, 1998, again by Ariane 4 rocket.

In October 2000 SES acquired the shares of Tele Danmark and Teracom to become 50-50 joint owner with SSC. SES increased its shareholding to 75% in December 2003, and renamed the company to SES Sirius on December 1, 2005.  In January 2008, SES further increased its shareholding in SES Sirius to 90%.

In March 2010 SES (as then subsidiary SES Astra) took full control and in June 2010 the company was renamed SES Astra and the only fully operational satellite, [[Sirius (satellite)#Sirius 4|Sirius 4]], renamed [[Astra 4A]].

The '''Shanghai International Settlement''' ({{zh|c=上海公共租界|p=Shànghǎi Gōnggòng Zūjiè''; &lt;small&gt;[[Shanghainese]]&lt;/small&gt;'': Zånhae Konkun Tsyga}}) originated from the 1863 merger of the [[British Concession (Shanghai)|British]] and [[American Concession (Shanghai)|American]] [[list of former foreign enclaves in China|enclaves]] in [[Shanghai]], parts of the [[Qing Empire]] held [[extraterritoriality|extraterritorially]] under the terms of a series of [[Unequal Treaties]].

The settlements were established following the defeat of the [[Qing army]] by the [[British Empire|British]] in the [[First Opium War]] (1839{{ndash}}1842). Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Nanking]], the five [[treaty ports]] including [[Shanghai]] were opened to foreign merchants, overturning the monopoly then held by the southern port of Canton ([[Guangzhou]]) under the [[Canton System]]. The British also established a base on [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] under an extensive lease. American and French involvement followed closely on the heels of the British and their enclaves were established north and south, respectively, of the British area.

Unlike the colonies of Hong Kong and Macau, where Great Britain and Portugal enjoyed full sovereignty in perpetuity, the foreign concessions in China remained under Chinese sovereignty. In 1854, the three countries created the Shanghai Municipal Council to serve all their interests, but, in 1862, the [[French concession]] dropped out of the arrangement. The following year the British and American settlements formally united to create the Shanghai International Settlement. As more foreign powers entered into treaty relations with China, their nationals also became part of the administration of the settlement, but it always remained a predominantly British affair until the growth of Japan's involvement in the late 1930s.

The international settlement came to an abrupt end in December 1941 when Japanese troops stormed in immediately following the attack on [[Pearl Harbor]]. In early 1943, new treaties signed by [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Republican government]] formally ended the extraterritorial privileges of Americans and Britons, although its terms were moot until the recovery of Shanghai following Japan's 1945 surrender. The French later surrendered their privileges in a separate 1946 agreement.

==History==

===Arrival of the Americans, British and other Europeans===

[[File:Shanghai 1884.jpg|thumb|225px|1884 map of Shanghai with foreign concessions: the ''British Concession'' in blue, [[Shanghai French Concession|''the French Concession'']] to the south in faded red and ''American Concession'' to the north in faded orange; ''Chinese part'' of the city to the south of the ''French Concession'' in faded yellow.]]

Although Europeans had shown more interest in Canton than Shanghai early on for commercial advantages, the port’s strategic position was key to British interests as the island nation declared war against China in 1839, later known as the [[First Opium War|first Anglo-Chinese Opium War]]. The first settlement in Shanghai for foreigners was the British settlement, opened in 1843 under the terms of the [[Treaty of Nanking]], one of the many unequal treaties China incurred in opposition to its European trading partners.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Darwent, Charles Ewart. ''Shanghai; a handbook for travellers and residents to the chief objects of interest in and around the foreign settlements and native city.'' Shanghai, Hongkong: Kelly and Walsh [date of publication not identified].&lt;/ref&gt;
On the orders of Sir [[Henry Pottinger]], first Governor-general of [[Hong Kong]], Captain [[George Balfour (Liberal MP)|George Balfour]] of the [[East India Company]]'s Madras Artillery arrived as Britain's first consul in Shanghai on 8{{nbsp}}November 1843 aboard the steamer ''Medusa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url = http://jds.cass.cn/Item/5719.aspx |title=A Short History of Shanghai |publisher=Institute of Modern History, [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]] |date = 4 March 2007 |accessdate=10 March 2014 |last = Hawkes |first = Francis Lister |author-link = Francis L. Hawks}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next morning Balfour sent word to the [[circuit intendant of Shanghai]], [[Gong Mujiu]] (then romanised Kung Moo-yun), requesting a meeting, at which he indicated his desire to find a house to live in. Initially Balfour was told no such properties were available, but on leaving the meeting, he received an offer from a pro-British [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] named Yao to rent a large house within the city walls for four hundred dollars per annum. Balfour, his interpreter [[Walter Henry Medhurst]], surgeon Dr. Hale and clerk A. F. Strachan moved into the luxuriously furnished 52-room house immediately.{{sfn|Hauser|1940|p=10}}

It served as the consulate during construction of a Western-style building within the official Settlement boundaries just to the south of Suzhou Creek. This was completed within a year.  This soon became the epicentre of the British settlement. Afterward both the [[France|French]] and the [[United States|Americans]] signed treaties with China that gave their citizens extraterritorial rights similar to those granted to the British, but initially their respective nationals accepted that the foreign settlement came under British consular jurisdiction. However, it must be clearly understood that Shanghai has been from the beginning a settlement, not a possession. The British Government annexed [[Hong Kong]], which became British territory, and subject to British law. The land on which the Foreign Settlement of Shanghai was created was, on the other hand, only leased to the British Government. That is proved by the fact that all the landowners still pay ground rent to the Chinese Government.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The Sino-American [[Treaty of Wanghia]] was signed in July 1844 by [[Qing Dynasty|Chinese Qing government]] official [[Qiying]], the [[Viceroy of Liangguang]], who held responsibility for the provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi, and Massachusetts politician [[Caleb Cushing]] (1800–1879), who was dispatched with orders to "save the Chinese from the condition of being an exclusive monopoly in the hands of England" as a consequence of the 1842 Nanking treaty. Under the Treaty of Wanghia, Americans gained the same rights as those enjoyed by the British in China's treaty ports. It also contained a clause that effectively carved out Shanghai as an extraterritorial zone within [[Late Imperial China|Imperial China]], though it did not actually give the American government a true legal concession.&lt;ref&gt;Sergeant, H. ''Shanghai'' (1998) at pp 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was only in 1845 that Britain followed in America's footsteps and signed a land-deal to allow Britons to rent land in Shanghai in perpetuity. The American consular presence did not create a problem for the British because it was never intended to have a post in person. Since American traders in China were prohibited from engaging in the opium trade (though almost all were active in this trade), their business transactions were conducted under the auspices of British firms. The only serious incident of political complaint against the Americans was in 1845, when the [[Flag of the United States|Stars and Stripes]] was raised by the acting US Consul, Henry G. Wolcott, who had just arrived in the city. Neither the British nor the Chinese governor approved of the display. In 1848, France established its own [[French concession]] under French consular jurisdiction, squeezed between the British settlement to the north and the Chinese walled city to the south.

During the [[Taiping Rebellion]], with the Concessions effectively landlocked by both the [[Manchu]] government and [[Small Swords Society]] rebels, the Western residents of the Shanghai International Settlement, known as "[[Shanghailander]]s", refused to pay taxes to the Chinese government except for land and maritime rates (nominally because Shanghai's customs house had been burnt down). They also claimed the right to exclude Chinese troops from the concession areas. While the Settlement had at first disallowed non-foreigners from living inside its boundaries, a large number of Chinese were allowed to move into the International Settlement to escape the Taipings or seek better economic opportunities. Chinese entry was subsequently legalised and continued to grow.

===Municipal Council===
[[File:Shanghai tram, British section, 1920s, John Rossman's collection.jpg|thumb|250px|Shanghai tram, 1920s.]]
On 11{{nbsp}}July 1854 a committee of Western businessmen met and held the first annual meeting of the '''Shanghai Municipal Council''' ('''SMC''', formally the '''Council for the Foreign Settlement North of the Yang-king-pang'''), ignoring protests of consular officials, and laid down the Land Regulations which established the principles of self-government. The aims of this first Council were simply to assist in the formation of roads, refuse collection, and taxation across the disparate Concessions.
[[File:American Settlement Boundary Stone.png|thumb|left|Boundary Stone of the American Settlement in Shanghai.]]
In 1863 the American concession—land fronting the [[Huangpu River]] to the north-east of Soochow Creek ([[Suzhou Creek]])—officially joined the British Settlement (stretching from [[Yang-ching-pang Creek]] to Suzhou Creek) to become the Shanghai International Settlement. The French concession remained independent and the Chinese retained control over the original walled city and the area surrounding the foreign enclaves. This would later result in sometimes absurd administrative outcomes, such as needing three drivers' licenses to travel through the complete city.

By the late-1860s Shanghai's official governing body had been practically transferred from the individual concessions to the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局, literally "Works Department", from the standard English local government title of 'Board of works'). The British Consul was the ''de jure'' authority in the Settlement, but he had no actual power unless the ratepayers (who voted for the Council) agreed. Instead, he and the other consulates deferred to the Council.
[[File:Shanghai 1928 Bund Cenotaph.jpeg|thumb|250px|[[The Bund (Shanghai)|The Bund]], 1928.]]
The Council had become a practical monopoly over the city's businesses by the mid-1880s. It bought up all the local gas-suppliers, electricity producers and water-companies, then&amp;nbsp;— during the 20th-century&amp;nbsp;— took control over all non-private rickshaws and the Settlement tramways. It also regulated opium sales and prostitution until their banning in 1918 and 1920 respectively.
[[File:ICBC building on the Bund, Shanghai.jpg|thumb|The Bund, 2018]]
Until the late-1920s, therefore, the SMC and its subsidiaries, including the police, power station, and public works, were British dominated (though not controlled, since Britain itself had no authority over the Council). Some of the Settlement's actions during this period, such as the [[May 30th Movement]], in which Chinese [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrators]] were shot by members of the [[Shanghai Municipal Police]], did embarrass and threaten the British Empire's position in China even though they were not carried out by "Britain" itself.
[[File:Stirling Fessenden Lord Mayor of Shanghai.png|thumb|left|150px|A caricature of [[Stirling Fessenden]], one of the longest serving chairmen of the SMC, as the "Lord Mayor of Shanghai"]]
No Chinese residing in the International Settlement were permitted to join the council until 1928. Amongst the many members who served on the council, its chairman during the 1920s, [[Stirling Fessenden]], is possibly the most notable.  An American, he served as the settlement's main administrator during Shanghai's most turbulent era, and was considered more "British" than the council's British members. He oversaw many of the major incidents of the decade, including the [[May 30th Movement]] and the [[White Terror (mainland China)|White Terror]] that came with the [[Shanghai massacre of 1927]].

Through an informal agreement, by the 1930s the British had five seats on the Council, the Japanese two and the Americans and others two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Shanghai International Settlement Elections: Japan Demand New Ballot |work=Dundee Evening Telegraph |date=26 March 1936 |accessdate = 18 November 2014 |url = http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000563/19360326/151/0010| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]] |subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1936 Council election, because of their increasing interests in the Settlement, the Japanese nominated three candidates. Only two were elected, which led to a Japanese protest after 323 uncounted votes were discovered. As a result, the election was declared invalid and a new poll held on April{{nbsp}}20-21 1936, at which the Japanese nominated only two candidates, leaving the structure of the Council unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = William Crane |last = Johnstone |title = The Shanghai Problem |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qoWaAAAAIAAJ |year=1937|publisher=Stanford University Press |page = 247 |isbn = 978-0-8047-1066-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Settlement was wholly foreign-controlled, with staff of all nationalities, including [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]], [[United States|Americans]], [[Denmark|Danes]], [[Italy|Italians]] and [[German Empire|German]]s. In reality, the British held the largest number of seats on the Council and headed all the Municipal departments (British included Australians, New Zealanders, [[Canada|Canadians]], [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]]ers, and [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]]ns whose extraterritorial rights were established by the United Kingdom treaty).

The only department not chaired by a Briton was the Municipal Orchestra, which was controlled by an Italian.

The Settlement maintained its own fire-service, [[police force]] (the [[Shanghai Municipal Police]]), and even possessed its own [[military reserve]] in the [[Shanghai Volunteer Corps]] ({{lang|zh-hant|萬國商團}}). Following some disturbances at the British concession in [[Hankow Incident|Hankow in 1927]], the defences at Shanghai were augmented by a permanent battalion of the British Army, which was referred to as the [[Shanghai Defence Force]] (SDF or SHAF),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queensroyalsurreys.org.uk/hongkong_china/hkc05_1.html|title=The Queen's join the China Station 1927|website=www.queensroyalsurreys.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[China Marines|a contingent of US Marines]]. Other armed forces would arrive in Shanghai; the French Concession had a defensive force of [[Annamite]] troops, the Italians also introduced their own marines, as did the Japanese (whose troops eventually outnumbered the other countries' many times over).

===Legal Status of the International Settlement===

Article 28 of the International Settlement's ''Land Regulations'' stated unequivocally that "the land encompassed in the territory remains Chinese territory, subject to China's sovereign rights." As expressed by legal experts, " "the self-governing International Settlement possesses no more power than the mere delegation of purely local and municipal powers and functions. Control of police, sanitation, roads, and other problems of local administration are granted to the Municipal Council simply because that body happens to be the one best equipped to deal with these matters in an area where the large majority of foreigners dwell. But the Municipal Council is in no sense a political body. Its powers, being delegated and hence limited, are subject to strict construction. What foreigners acquire is simply the delegated power of municipal administration, while the reserve powers remain in the sovereign grantor, the Chinese Government. Although under the control of the Consular Council, the area is still Chinese territory, over which China's sovereignty remains unsurrendered".&lt;ref&gt;C. F. Fraser, "The Status of the International Settlement at Shanghai", ''Journal of Comparative Legislation and International Law'', British Institute of International and Comparative Law, Vol. 21, No. 1 (1939), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fraser |first1=C.

=== Rise of Imperial Japan (20th century) ===
[[File:Hongkou Japantown.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Hongkou District|Hongkew Japantown]]]]

In the 19th century, Europeans possessed [[treaty port]]s in Japan in the same way they held those in China. However, Japan rapidly developed into a modern nation, and by the turn of the 20th century the Japanese had successfully negotiated with all powers to abrogate all unequal treaties with it.   Japan stood alongside the other European powers as part of the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] during the infamous [[Siege of the International Legations (Boxer Rebellion)|fifty five-day siege of the foreign embassy compound]] in [[Peking]]. Japan entered the 20th century as a rising world power, and with its unequal treaties with the European powers now abrogated, it actually joined in, obtaining an unequal treaty with China granting extraterritorial rights under the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] signed in 1895.

In 1915, during the [[First World War]], Japan overtook [[United Kingdom|Britain]] as the country with the largest number of foreign residents in Shanghai. In 1914 they sided with [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and France in the war and conquered all German possessions in China. By the beginning of the 1930s, Japan was swiftly becoming the most powerful national group in Shanghai and accounted for some 80% of all extraterritorial foreigners in China. Much of Hongkew, which had become an unofficial Japanese settlement, was known as ''Little Tokyo''.

In 1931, supposed "protection of Japanese colonists from Chinese aggression" in [[Hongkou District|Hongkew]] was used as a pretext for the [[Shanghai Incident]], when Japanese troops invaded Shanghai. From then until the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937–1945) Hongkew was almost entirely outside of the SMC's hands, with law and protection enforced to varying degrees by the Japanese Consular Police and Japanese members of the Shanghai Municipal Police.

==== Japanese take over rest of Shanghai (1937) ====
[[File:Japanese marines during the Battle of Shanghai, 1937.jpg|thumb|250px|Japanese soldiers in Shanghai, 1937.]]
{{Further|Battle of Shanghai}}

In 1932 there were 1,040,780 Chinese living within the International Settlement, with another 400,000 fleeing into the area after the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] broke out in 1937. For the next five years, the International Settlement and the French Concession were surrounded by Japanese occupiers and Chinese revolutionaries, with conflict often spilling into the Settlement's borders. In 1941, the Japanese launched an abortive political bid to take over the SMC: during a mass meeting of ratepayers at the Settlement Race Grounds, a Japanese official leaped up and shot [[Keswick family#Sir William Johnstone "Tony" Keswick (1903–1990)|William Keswick]], then Chairman of the Council. While Keswick was only wounded, a near riot broke out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1928&amp;dat=19400412&amp;id=bqo0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lmgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=984,980791|title=The Lewiston Daily Sun - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Japanese occupy the International Settlement (1941) ====
Anglo-American influence effectively ended after 8 December 1941, when the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] entered and occupied the British and American controlled parts of the city in the wake of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The French and Americans surrendered without a shot, while the only British riverboat in Shanghai, [[HMS Peterel (1927)|HMS ''Peterel'']], refused to surrender and was sunk although nobody was killed.

European Shanghai residents were forced to wear armbands to differentiate them, were evicted from their homes, and&amp;nbsp;— just like Chinese citizens&amp;nbsp;— were liable to maltreatment. All were liable for punitive punishments, torture and even death during the period of Japanese occupation. The Japanese sent European and American citizens to be interned at the [[Lunghua Civilian Assembly Center]], a work camp on what was then the outskirts of Shanghai. Survivors of Lunghua were released in August 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/lunghua-civilian-assembly-centre-teacher-to-reveal-grim-history-of-site-of-j-g-ballards-internment-camp-9180216.html|title=Lunghua Civilian Assembly Centre: Teacher to reveal grim history of|date=9 March 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst all this, Shanghai was notable for a long period as the only place in the world that unconditionally offered refuge for [[Jew]]s escaping from the [[Nazism|Nazi]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Wasserstein, B. ''Secret War in Shanghai'' (1999) at pp 140–150.&lt;/ref&gt; These refugees often lived in squalid conditions in an area known as the [[Shanghai Ghetto]] in [[Hongkew]]. On 21 August 1941 the Japanese government closed Hongkew to Jewish immigration.

==== Return to Chinese rule ====
In February 1943, the International Settlement was ''de jure'' returned to the Chinese as part of the [[British–Chinese Treaty for the Relinquishment of Extra-Territorial Rights in China]] and American–Chinese [[Sino-American New Equal Treaty|Treaty for Relinquishment of Extraterritorial Rights in China]] with the [[History of the Republic of China|Nationalist Government]] of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] under [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. However, because Shanghai was under Japanese control, this was unenforceable. In reply, in July 1943, the Japanese retroceded the SMC to the City Government of Shanghai, which was then in the hands of the pro-Japanese [[Wang Jingwei Government]].

Although the original treaty between [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and China (the [[Treaty of Nanking]]) was signed in 1842 on behalf of the entire British Empire, the new treaty of 1943 was only signed on behalf of the United Kingdom, colonies and [[British India]]. It was not signed on behalf of the [[British Dominions|dominions]]. Canada signed its own treaty with China the following year.

After the war and the liberation of the city from the Japanese, a Liquidation Commission fitfully met to discuss the remaining details of the handover. By the end of 1945, most westerners not actively involved in the [[Chinese Civil War]] (such as intelligence agents, soldiers, journalists etc.) or in Shanghai's remaining foreign businesses, had left the city. With the defeat of the [[Kuomintang]] in 1949, the city was occupied by Communist troops and came under the control of [[Politics of Shanghai|Mayor of Shanghai]].

The foreign architecture of the International Settlement era can still be seen today along [[the Bund (Shanghai)|the Bund]] and in many locations around the city.

== Legal system ==
[[File:Restored British Supreme Court for China Building in Shanghai.jpg|thumb|250px|The building of the [[British Supreme Court for China]] in Shanghai]]

The International Settlement did not have a unified legal system.   The Municipal Council issued Land Regulations and regulations under this, that were binding on all people in the settlement. Other than this, citizens and subjects of powers that had treaties with China that provided for [[extraterritoriality|extraterritorial rights]] were subject to the laws of their own countries and civil and criminal complaints against them were required to be brought against them to their [[consular court]]s (courts overseen by consular officials) under the laws of their own countries.

The number of treaty powers had climbed to a maximum of 19 by 1918 but was down to 14 by the 1930s: Great Britain, the United States, Japan, France, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Peru, Mexico, and Switzerland. Germany and Austria-Hungary lost their treaty rights after WWI, and Russia gave up her rights as a matter of political expediency. Belgium was declared by China to have lost her rights in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;William C. Johnstone, "International Relations: The Status of Foreign Concessions and Settlements in the Treaty Ports of China", The American Political Science Review, no 5, Oct. 1937, p. 942.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Chinese government adamantly refused to grant treaty power status to any of the new nations born in the wake of WWI, such as Austria and Hungary (formerly Austria-Hungary), Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, the Baltic States and Finland.

Chinese citizens and citizens of non-treaty powers were subject to Chinese law. Inside the Settlement, cases against them would be brought to the Mixed Court, a court established in the Settlement in the 1870s which existed until 1926.   In cases involving foreigners, a foreign [[assessor (law)|assessor]], usually a consular officer, would sit with the Chinese magistrate and in many cases acted like a judge. In 1927, a Provisional Court was established with a sole Chinese judge presiding.  In 1930, Chinese Special Courts were established which had jurisdiction over all non treaty power individuals and companies in the Settlement.

Two countries, Britain and the United States established formal court systems in China to try cases.  The [[British Supreme Court for China and Japan]] was established in 1865 and located in its own building in the [[Former Consulate-General of the United Kingdom, Shanghai|British Consulate compound]] and the [[United States Court for China]] was established in the US Consulate in 1906.  Both courts were occupied by the Japanese on 8 December 1941 and effectively ceased to function from that date.

== Currency ==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2016}}
[[File:HuangpuparkOld2.jpg|thumb|250px|"The Gardens ([[Huangpu Park]]) are reserved for the Foreign Community".]]

The currency situation in China generally was very complicated in the 19th century. There was no unified system. Different parts of China operated different systems, and the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[pieces of eight]] that had been coming from Mexico for a few hundred years on [[Manila Galleon]]s were current along the China coast. Until the 1840s these silver dollar coins were [[Spain|Spanish]] coins minted mainly in [[Mexico City]], but from the 1840s these gave way to [[Mexican dollar|Mexican republican dollars]].

In Shanghai, this complexity represented a microcosm of the complicated economy existing elsewhere along the China coast. The Chinese reckoned in weights of silver, which did not necessarily correspond to circulating coins. One important unit was a [[tael]], a measurement of weight with several different definitions. These included: Customs Taels (for foreign trade), Cotton Taels (for cotton trade), etc. Shanghai had its own [[tael]], which was very similar in weight to the Customs Tael and therefore popular for international business. China also had a mixture of coins, including Chinese [[Cash (Chinese coin)|Copper Cash]] coins and Mexican dollars. Paper money was first issued by European and North American colonial banks (one British colonial bank known as the [[Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China]] at one time issued banknotes in Shanghai that were denominated in [[Mexican dollar]]s).

European and North American currencies did not officially circulate in the International Settlement, except [[Yen]] in the Japanese district of "Little Tokyo". Until the year 1873, however, [[US dollar]] coins would have reasonably corresponded in size, shape and value to [[Mexican dollar]]s. Between 1873 and 1900, all [[silver standard]] dollars had depreciated to about 50% of the value of the [[gold standard]] dollars of the United States and Canada leading to a rising economic depression.

The Chinese themselves officially adopted the dollar unit as their national currency in 1889, and the first Chinese dollar coins, known as [[Chinese yuan|yuan]], contained an inscription which related their value to an already existing Chinese system of accounts. On the earliest Chinese dollar ([[Chinese yuan|yuan]]) coins it states the words 7 [[Mace (measurement)|mace]] and 2 [[candareen]]s. The [[Mace (measurement)|mace]] and [[candareen]] were sub-divisions of the [[tael]] unit of weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rseuLmTlEZAC&amp;pg=PA394&amp;lpg=PA394&amp;dq=7+mace+candarin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Xzyz5KgMtq&amp;sig=Wag_9eNeIrEsANKg_KRdRpz7Acs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AcNWS_6_JoqA7QOjhvmFBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=7+mace+candarin&amp;f=false|title=2008 Standard Catalog of World Coins 1901-2000|first1=Colin R.|last1=Bruce|first2=Thomas|last2=Michael|date=11 June 2007|publisher=F+W Media, Inc|via=Google Books|isbn=9780896895003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banknotes tended to be issued in dollars, either worded as such or as yuan.

Despite the complications arising from a mixture of Chinese and Spanish coinages, there was one overwhelming unifying factor binding all the systems in use: [[silver standard|silver]]. The Chinese reckoned purely in terms of [[silver]], and value was always compared against a weight of [[silver]] (hence, the reason large prices were given in tael). It was the strict adherence of the Chinese to silver that caused China and even the British colonies of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Weihaiwei under British rule|Weihaiwei]] to remain on the [[silver standard]] after the rest of the world had changed over to the [[gold standard]]. When China began producing official Republican [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] coins in 1934, they were minted in Shanghai and shipped to [[Nanking]] for distribution.

== Postal services ==
[[File:Stamp Shanghai 1877 20cash.jpg|thumb|Shanghai stamp of 1877 showing a dragon motif.]]
[[File:Stamp Shanghai 1893 1c.jpg|thumb|Shanghai stamp of 1893 with the combined coats of arms of the European powers.]]
Shanghai had developed a [[postal service]] as early as the [[Ming Dynasty]], but during the [[treaty port]] era foreign postal services were organised through their respective consulates.  For example, the [[United States Post Office Department]] maintained a United States Postal Agency at the Shanghai consulate through which Americans could use the US Post Office to send mail to and from the US mainland and US territories.  Starting in 1919 the 16 current regular US stamps were [[overprint]]ed for use in Shanghai with the city's name, "China", and amounts double their printed face values.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stampnotes.com/Notes_from_the_Past/pastnote432.htm U.S. Postal Agency in Shanghai&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1922 texts for two of the overprints were changed, thereby completing the [[Scott catalogue]] set of K1-18, "Offices in China".

The British originally used British postage stamps overprinted with the local currency amount, but from 1868, the British changed to [[Hong Kong]] postage stamps already denominated in [[dollar]]s. However, in the special case of [[Shanghai]], in the year 1865 the International settlement began to issue its own postage stamps, denominated in the local Shanghai [[tael]] unit.

The Shanghai Post Office controlled all post within the Settlement, but post coming in or going out of the [[treaty port]] was required to go through the Chinese Imperial Post Office. In 1922 the various foreign postal services, the Shanghai Post Office and the Chinese Post Office were all brought together into a single Chinese Post Office, thus extending the 1914 membership of the Chinese Post Office to the [[Universal Postal Union]] to Shanghai Post Office. Some other foreign countries refused to fall under this new postal service's remit, however: for many years, Japan was notable as sending almost all its mail to Shanghai in [[diplomatic bag]]s, which could not be opened by postal staff.

The General Shanghai Post Office was first located on Beijing Road and moved to the location on Sichuan North Road of the [[General Post Office Building, Shanghai]] that is today the Shanghai Post Museum.

== Music ==
International merchants brought with them amateur musical talent that manifested in the creation of the Shanghai Philharmonic Society in 1868 under the baton of French conductor Remusat. To remain under the instruction of Remusat, the society offered him the profits of two concerts a year, which was a reasonable deal considering the popularity of their concerts throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com/hnpchinesecollection/docview/1321172660/CF126433079944A6PQ/5?accountid=12492|title=Shanghai|last=|first=|date=6 February 1968|work=The North-China Herald and Market Report|access-date=19 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From here, the [[Shanghai Symphony Orchestra|Shanghai Municipal Orchestra]] was officially formed in 1879, also under Remusat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com/hnpchinesecollection/docview/1324910318/CF126433079944A6PQ/67?accountid=12492|title=The Philharmonic Concert at Masonic Hall|last=|first=|date=24 December 1879|work=The North - China Herald and Supreme Court &amp; Consular Gazette|access-date=19 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, the orchestra came under Italian pianist Marco Paci, and it flourished as a main cultural attraction for the public. In an interview regarding the orchestra in 1933, Paci noted that the Shanghai Municipal Orchestra was "now one of the finest symphonic orchestras in the world, comparable, if not superior to any in Europe or America."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com/hnpchinesecollection/docview/1416462159/C66DABF948244753PQ/4?accountid=12492|title=Musical Quiz Elicits Some Unusual Comments From Paci About Municipal Orchestra|last=|first=|date=20 June 1933|work=The China Press|access-date=19 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also discussed the wide audience to which the symphony performed, including the fact that the Shanghai concert audience included people of various nationalities who had a wide spectrum of pieces and composers that they enjoyed. As a result, the orchestra performed a great selection of pieces, from Beethoven to lesser-known composers such as Bargiel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com/hnpchinesecollection/docview/1320145393/CF126433079944A6PQ/75?accountid=12492|title=Amusements: Mr. Iburg's Final Concert|last=|first=|date=29 June 1880|work=The North - China Herald and Supreme Court &amp; Consular Gazette|access-date=19 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally noted musicians such as Polish pianist Ignez Friedman visited Shanghai to give guest performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com/hnpchinesecollection/docview/1371880509/C66DABF948244753PQ/1?accountid=12492|title=To Appear With Orchestra: Ignaz Friedman Booked To Play With Orchestra Noted Polish Pianist To Be Featured On Next Symphony Program|last=|first=|date=1 November 1933|work=The China Press|access-date=19 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, the Shanghai Municipal Orchestra faced disbandment as the ratepayers in the annual Municipal Council meeting considered reallocating budgets away from the orchestra, since it was "western and unnecessary." However, after much discussion, they decided to keep the orchestra, acknowledging that its educational value was much greater than the cost of keeping it up.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com/hnpchinesecollection/docview/1371344324/C66DABF948244753PQ/7?accountid=12492|title=S.M.C.

After 1938, there were several other times during which the Municipal wanted to kill off the orchestra; however, every time, the orchestra had "phoenix-like risen from the ashes."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com/hnpchinesecollection/docview/1416544495/CF126433079944A6PQ/18?accountid=12492|title=THE NEW ORCHESTRA|last=|first=|date=18 April 1936|work=The China Press|access-date=19 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further on in the article, the editor notes the great educational values of music in bring culture to the East, which was a characteristic of music unique to Shanghai. Additionally, unlike other places in the world, Shanghailanders had a consistently great genuine appreciation for music, which was a common language that brought people of all nations together in celebration.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The people in the International Settlement prided themselves in the high culture that they had even while separated ten thousand miles from home, physically manifested in the Shanghai Municipal Orchestra. After every performance, an article was released in the "Amusements" section of the newspaper, outlining the concert program, praising the success of each concert, and critiquing the musicians and the orchestra as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com/hnpchinesecollection/docview/1321190669/B4B7A2083ADD43E6PQ/1?accountid=12492|title=Shanghai Philharmonic Society's Concert|last=|first=|date=9 January 1891|work=The North - China Herald and Supreme Court &amp; Consular Gazette|access-date=19 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the string orchestra, opera and choral music were favoured forms of entertainment. Often, the orchestra would accompany singers as a part of orchestra concerts, in addition to the symphonies and other pieces that they played, or just in choral or opera concerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com/hnpchinesecollection/docview/1369467847/B4B7A2083ADD43E6PQ/156?accountid=12492|title=Professor Sternberg's Symphony Concert|last=|first=|date=23 May 1900|work=The North - China Herald and Supreme Court &amp; Consular Gazette|access-date=19 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Slovak passport''' is issued to citizens of [[Slovakia]] to enable legal international travel. Every Slovak citizen is also a [[Citizenship of the European Union|citizen of the European Union]]. The [[passport]], along with the [[Slovak identity card|national identity card]] allows for free rights of movement and residence in any of the states of the [[European Union]] and [[European Economic Area]].

Every Slovak citizen is entitled to possess two passports of the same kind, if he or she wishes to. The second passport is valid for 5 years (instead of the standard 10 years), while the fee remains the same. Passports in Slovakia are issued by the [[Law enforcement in Slovakia|police force]].

== History ==
Slovakia started issuing the current [[biometric]] passports on January 15, 2008. The biometric data consisted of the face picture. On June 22, 2009 the passports were changed to include second biometric data of the [[fingerprint]]s. Because of the nature of biometric data acquirement, passports are now issued only directly to the passport owners.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.minv.sk/?cestovne-pasy&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1 January 2017, Slovak citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 165 countries and territories, ranking the Slovak passport 12th in terms of travel freedom (tied with Latvian, Liechtenstein and Slovenian passports) according to the [[Visa (document)#Visa restrictions|Henley visa restrictions index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Ranking - Visa Restriction Index 2017|url=https://henleyglobal.com/files/download/hvri/HP_Visa_Restrictions_Index_170301.pdf|publisher=Henley &amp; Partners|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flag of the State of Judea.png|thumb|Proposed flag of the State of Judea.]] 

The '''State of Judea''' ({{lang-he-n|מְדִינַת יְהוּדָה}}, ''Medīnat Yəhuda'') is a [[Three-state solution|proposed]] [[halachic state]] in the [[West Bank]] put forward by Israeli [[Israeli settlement|Jewish settlers]]. After the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) declared the existence of a Palestinian state in 1988, some settler activists (primarily [[Kahanism|Kahanist]]s) feared that international pressure would lead [[Israel]] to withdraw from the West Bank and sought to lay the groundwork for an Orthodox Jewish state in the West Bank if this came to pass.  The establishment of this state was announced in a Jerusalem hotel on December 27. Veteran Kahanist, Michael Ben-Horin, was declared president of the state of Judea.&lt;ref name="PedahzurPerliger2009"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X5D5vKGjU2EC&amp;pg=PA93|title=Jewish Terrorism in Israel|author1=Ami Pedahzur|author2=Arie Perliger|date=1 October 2009|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-52075-1|pages=93–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1989 several hundred activists met and announced their intention to create such a state if Israel withdrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ApANDp1XzmgC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=%22state+of+judea%22+kach |title=The deadly embrace: the impact of Israeli and Palestinian rejectionism on the peace process |first1=Ilana |last1=Kass |first2=Bard E |last2=O'Neill |publisher=University Press of America |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-7618-0535-9 |page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WysT_YXvi0kC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;dq=%22state+of+judea%22 |title=Frontiers and ghettos: state violence in Serbia and Israel |first=James |last=Ron |publisher=University of California Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-520-23657-8 |page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/the-state-of-judea-1.210699 |title=The State of Judea |first=Danny |last=Rubinstein |publisher=Haaretz |date=22 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=P2sVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kuEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3492,3680069&amp;dq=michael-ben-horin+judea |title=Settlers seek new nation called Judea|newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard |date=17 January 1989 |page=3A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7DgQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=G48DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6890,1643982 |title=Right-wingers eye new jewish state in the territories |newspaper=Ellensburg Daily Record |date=17 January 1989 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The idea was revived following the [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza|unilateral disengagement plan]] which resulted in the forcible withdrawal of Jewish settlers from [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] by the Israeli Defense Force in 2005. In 2007 Rabbi [[Shalom Dov Wolpo]] suggested the establishment of a new state in the West Bank in the event of Israeli withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2007/12/07/Rabbi-threatens-secession-from-Israel/UPI-56021197065549/ |title=Rabbi threatens secession from Israel |publisher=UPI.com |date=7 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3479663,00.html |title=Rightist initiative: Picking flag and anthem for settler state |first=Efrat |last=Weiss |publisher=Ynetnews |date=6 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flag==
The flag of Judea is very similar to the flag of Israel. Like the flag of Israel, it depicts a blue symbol on a white background, between two horizontal blue stripes, but unlike the [[flag of Israel]] the symbol is a [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]] instead of a [[Star of David]]. Another version features a Star of David of a different sort than appears on the flag of Israel, together with some other symbols.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/il%7Djudea.html&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Un Blodymary'''" ({{IPA-es|un bloðiˈmeɾi}}, "A [[Bloody Mary (cocktail)|Bloody Mary]]") was the Spanish entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006]], performed in Spanish by [[Las Ketchup]].

Spain's status (along with France, Germany and the United Kingdom) as one of the "Big Four" guaranteed the song a final berth. Thus it was performed sixth on the night, following Norway's [[Christine Guldbrandsen]] with "[[Alvedansen]]" and preceding [[Malta]]'s [[Fabrizio Faniello]] with "[[I Do (Fabrizio Faniello song)|I Do]]". At the close of voting, it had received 18 points, placing 21st in a field of 24.

The song was succeeded as [[Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest|Spanish representative]] by [[D'Nash]] with "[[I Love You Mi Vida]]".
