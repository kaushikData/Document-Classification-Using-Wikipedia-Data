Incorporating various peoples of different origins and faiths, it is notable for its successful model of a centralised, bureaucratic administration (through [[satrap]]s under the [[King of Kings]]), for building infrastructure such as [[Royal Road|road systems]] and a [[Chapar Khaneh|postal system]], the use of an [[official language]] across its territories, and the development of civil services and a large professional army.

The Achaemenid Empire is noted in Western history as the antagonist of the [[polis|Greek city-states]] during the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] and for the emancipation of the [[Babylonian captivity|Jewish exiles in Babylon]]. The historical mark of the empire went far beyond its territorial and military influences and included cultural, social, technological and religious influences as well. Despite the [[Greco-Persian Wars|lasting conflict between the two states]], many [[Athens|Athenians]] adopted Achaemenid customs in their daily lives in a reciprocal cultural exchange,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Margaret Christina Miller| title = Athens and Persia in the Fifth Century BC: A Study in Cultural Receptivity| url = https://books.google.com/?id=oGXMMD5rXBQC| year = 2004| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-60758-2| page = 243}}&lt;/ref&gt; some being employed by or allied to the Persian kings. The impact of [[Cyrus's edict]] is mentioned in Judeo-Christian texts, and the empire was instrumental in the spread of [[Zoroastrianism]] as far east as [[China]].

The name "Persia" is a Greek and [[Latin]] pronunciation of the native word referring to the country of the people originating from [[Persis]] (Old Persian: [[Wikt:êé±êé†êéºêéø|êé±êé†êéºêéø]], ''PƒÅrsa''), their home territory located north of the [[Persian Gulf]] in southwestern [[Iran]].&lt;ref name=enc&gt;{{cite book| author = Jamie Stokes| title = Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East, Volume 1| url = https://books.google.com/?id=Rtr7MQEACAAJ| year = 2009| publisher = Infobase Publishing| isbn = 978-0-8160-7158-6| pages = 2‚Äì3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Achaemenid Empire was not the first Iranian empire, as by 6th century BC another group of ancient [[Iranian peoples]] had already established the short-lived [[Median Empire]].&lt;ref name=enc/&gt; The [[Medes]] had originally been the dominant Iranian group in the region, freeing themselves of Assyrian domination and rising to power at the end of the seventh century BC, incorporating the Persians into their empire.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

The [[Iranian peoples]] had arrived in the region of what is today [[Iran]] c. 1000 BC&lt;ref&gt;Mallory, J.P. (1989), In Search of the Indo-Europeans: Language, Archaeology, and Myth, London: Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; and had for a number of centuries fallen under the domination of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911‚Äì609 BC), based in northern [[Mesopotamia]]. However, the Medes (together with the [[Scythians]], [[Babylonia]]ns), [[Cimmerians]], [[Persians]], and [[Chaldea]]ns played a major role in the overthrow of the Assyrian empire and establishment of the first Persian empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/904507201|title=A history of the ancient Near East ca. 3000-323 BC|last=Van de Mieroop|first=Marc|isbn=9781118718179|edition=Third|location=Chichester, West Sussex, UK|oclc=904507201|date=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point in 550 BC, Cyrus rose in rebellion against the Medes (most likely due to their mismanagement of Persis), eventually conquering the Medes and creating the first Persian empire. Cyrus the Great utilized his tactical genius,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Simon Anglim|author2=Simon Anglim|author3=Phyllis Jestice|author4=Scott Rusch|author5= John Serrati| title = Fighting techniques of the ancient world 3,000 BC ‚Äì 500 CE: equipment, combat skills, and tactics| url = https://books.google.com/?id=HL9cPgAACAAJ| year = 2002| publisher = Macmillan| isbn = 978-0-312-30932-9| page = 145}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as his understanding of the socio-political conditions governing his territories, to eventually incorporate into the Empire neighbouring Lydia and the Neo-Babylonian Empire, also leading the way for his successor, [[Cambyses II]], to venture into Egypt and defeat the [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt]].{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Cyrus the Great's political acumen was reflected in his management of his newly formed empire, as the Persian Empire became the first to attempt to govern many different ethnic groups on the principle of equal responsibilities and rights for all people, so long as subjects paid their taxes and kept the peace.&lt;ref name=cyv&gt;{{cite book| author = Palmira Johnson Brummett |author2=Robert R.

This system of management ultimately became an issue for the Persians, as with a larger empire came the need for order and control, leading to expenditure of resources and mobilization of troops to quell local rebellions, and weakening the central power of the king. By the time of [[Darius III]], this disorganization had almost led to a disunited realm.&lt;ref name=book/&gt;

The Persians from whom Cyrus hailed were originally [[nomadic pastoralism|nomadic pastoralists]] in the western Iranian Plateau and by 850 BC were calling themselves the ''Parsa'' and their constantly shifting territory ''Parsua'', for the most part localized around Persis.&lt;ref name=book/&gt; As Persians gained power, they developed the infrastructure to support their growing influence, including creation of a capital named [[Pasargadae]] and an opulent city named [[Persepolis]].{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Begun during the rule of [[Darius I]] "the Great" and completed some 100 years later, Persepolis was a symbol of the empire serving both as a ceremonial centre and a centre of government.&lt;ref name="gov"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8aLb5pnm1j4C|title=Ancient cities: the archaeology of urban life in the Ancient Near East and Egypt, Greece and Rome|author=Charles Gates|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-415-12182-8|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had a special set of gradually progressive stairways named "All Countries" around which carved relief decoration depicted scenes of heroism, hunting, natural themes, and presentation of the gifts to the Achaemenid kings by their various subjects, possibly during the spring festival, [[Nowruz]]. The core structure was composed of a multitude of square rooms or halls, the biggest of which was called ''[[Apadana]]''.&lt;ref name=gov/&gt; Tall, decorated columns welcomed visitors and emphasized the height of the structure. Later on, Darius also utilized [[Susa]] and [[Ecbatana]] as his governmental centres, developing them to a similar metropolitan status.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Accounts of the [[Achaemenid family tree]] can be derived from either documented Greek or Roman accounts, or from existing documented Persian accounts such as those found in the [[Behistun Inscription]]. However, since most existing accounts of this vast empire are in works of Greek philosophers and historians, and since many of the original Persian documents are lost, not to mention being subject to varying scholarly views on their origin and possible motivations behind them, it is difficult to create a definitive and completely objective list. Nonetheless, it is clear that Cyrus and Darius were critical in the expansion of the empire. Cyrus is often believed to be the son of [[Cambyses I]], grandson of [[Cyrus I]], the father of [[Cambyses II]], and a relative of Darius through a shared ancestor, [[Teispes]]. Cyrus the Great is also believed to have been a family member (possibly grandson) of the Median king [[Astyages]] through his mother, [[Mandane of Media]]. A minority of scholars argue that perhaps Achaemenes was a retrograde creation of Darius in order to reconcile his connection with Cyrus after gaining power.&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;

[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] writers provide some legendary information about [[Achaemenes]] by calling his tribe the ''Pasargadae'' and stating that he was "raised by an [[eagle]]". [[Plato]], when writing about the Persians, identified Achaemenes with [[Perses (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Perses]], ancestor of the Persians in [[Greek mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = David Sacks |author2=Oswyn Murray |author3=Lisa R.

Later writers believed that Achaemenes and Perseus were different people, and that Perses was an ancestor of the king.&lt;ref name=dandamayev&gt;[[#refachaemenes-EI|Dandamayev]]&lt;/ref&gt; This account further confirms that Achaemenes could well have been a significant Anshan leader and an ancestor of Cyrus the Great. Regardless, both Cyrus the Great and Darius the Great were related, prominent kings of Persia, under whose rule the empire expanded to include much of the ancient world.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

The empire took its unified form with a central administration around [[Pasargadae]] erected by [[Cyrus the Great]]. The empire ended up conquering and enlarging the Median Empire to include many more territories, for example in [[Europe]], the [[Caucasus]], [[Asia Minor]], [[Egypt]], and [[Central Asia]]. During the reigns of [[Darius I]] and his son [[Xerxes I]] it engaged in military conflict with some of the major city-states of [[Ancient Greece]], and although it came close to defeating the Greek army, this war ultimately led to the empire's overthrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Haydn Middleton|title = Ancient Greek War and Weapons|url = https://books.google.com/?id=RNhPuKAEva0C|date = 2 October 2002|publisher = Haydn Middleton|isbn = 978-1-4034-0134-2|pages = 12‚Äì3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 559 BC, [[Cambyses I]] the Elder was succeeded as the king of An≈°ƒÅn by his son [[Cyrus The Great|Cyrus the Great]], who also succeeded the still-living [[Arsames]] as the King of Persia, thus reuniting the two realms. Cyrus is considered to be the first true king of the Persian Empire, as his predecessors were subservient to the [[Medes]]. Cyrus the Great conquered Media, Lydia, and [[Babylon]]. Cyrus was politically shrewd, modelling himself as the "saviour" of conquered nations, often allowing displaced people to return, and giving his subjects freedom to practice local customs. To reinforce this image, he instituted policies of religious freedom, and restored temples and other infrastructure in the newly acquired cities (Most notably the [[Jewish]] inhabitants of Babylon, as recorded in the [[Cyrus Cylinder]] and the [[Tanakh]]). As a result of his tolerant policies he came to be known by those of the Jewish faith as "the anointed of the Lord."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Lawrence Heyworth Mills|title = Zarathustra, Philo, the Achaemenids and Israel|url = https://books.google.com/?id=uU8XAAAAYAAJ|year = 1906|publisher = Open Court|page = 467}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Isaiah 45:1‚Äì7 (Passage)|publisher=Bible gateway (New International Version)|year=2010|accessdate=26 December 2010|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+45%3A1-7&amp;version=NIV#en-NIV-18564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His immediate successors were less successful. Cyrus' son [[Cambyses II]] conquered Egypt in 525 BC, but died in July 522 BC during a revolt led by a sacerdotal clan that had lost its power following Cyrus' conquest of Media. The cause of his death remains uncertain, although it may have been the result of an accident.&lt;ref name=camb&gt;{{cite book|author = Maria Brosius|title = The Persians: an introduction|url = https://books.google.com/?id=9vnCeA_Z73cC|year = 2006|publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn = 978-0-415-32089-4|pages = 13 (at the bottom of the page)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Herodotus]], Cambyses II had originally ventured into Egypt to take revenge for the pharaoh Amasis's trickery when he sent a fake Egyptian bride whose family Amasis had murdered,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1uQaAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA245&amp;dq=Herodotus+Amasis&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=a0o0Tb-HMdDegQfu64niCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Herodotus%20Amasis&amp;f=false Herodotus ‚Äì Volume 1, Book II]&lt;/ref&gt; instead of his own daughter, to wed Cambyses II. Additionally negative reports of mistreatment caused by Amasis, given by [[Phanes of Halicarnassus]], a wise counsellor serving Amasis, further bolstered Cambyses's resolve to venture into Egypt. Amasis died before Cambyses II could face him, but his successor [[Psamtik III]] was defeated by Cambyses II in the [[Battle of Pelusium (525 BC)|Battle of Pelusium]].{{cn|date=January 2018}}

While Cambyses II was in Egypt, the Zoroastrian priests, whom Herodotus called [[Magi]], usurped the throne for one of their own, [[Gaumata]], who then pretended to be Cambyses II's younger brother [[Bardiya]] (Greek: ''Smerdis'' or ''Tanaoxares/Tanyoxarkes''&lt;ref name=camb/&gt;), who had been assassinated some three years earlier. Owing to the strict rule of Cambyses II, especially his stance on taxation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Augustus William Ahl|title = Outline of Persian history based on cuneiform inscriptions|url = https://books.google.com/?id=OwduAAAAMAAJ|year = 1922| publisher = Lemcke &amp; Buechner|page = 56}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his long absence in Egypt, "the whole people, Perses, Medes and all the other nations," acknowledged the usurper, especially as he granted a remission of taxes for three years.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus III.68&lt;/ref&gt; Cambyses II himself would not be able to quell the imposters, as he died on the way back from Egypt.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

The claim that [[Gaumata]] had impersonated Bardiya (Smerdis), is derived from Darius the Great and the records at the [[Behistun Inscription]]. Historians are divided over the possibility that the story of the impostor was invented by Darius as justification for his coup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9068262/Smerdis|title=Britannica Online Encyclopedia|publisher=Concise.britannica.com|accessdate=7 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015232225/http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9068262/Smerdis|archivedate=15 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darius made a similar claim when he later captured Babylon, announcing that the Babylonian king was not, in fact, Nebuchadnezzar III, but an impostor named Nidintu-bel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jona Lendering|url=http://www.livius.org/ne-nn/nidintu-bel/nidintubel.htm|title=Nidintu-B√™l / Nebuchadnezzar III|publisher=Livius.org|accessdate=7 July 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100714195400/http://www.livius.org/ne-nn/nidintu-bel/nidintubel.htm| archivedate= 14 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Behistun Inscription]], Gaumata ruled for seven months before being overthrown in 522 BC by [[Darius the Great]] (Darius I) (Old Persian ''DƒÅryavu≈°'', "who holds firm the good", also known as ''Darayarahush'' or Darius the Great). The Magi, though persecuted, continued to exist, and a year following the death of the first pseudo-Smerdis (Gaumata), saw a second pseudo-Smerdis (named VahyazdƒÅta) attempt a coup. The coup, though initially successful, failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Herodotus| title = Herodotus: the text of Canon Rawlinson's translation, with the notes abridged, Volume 1| url = https://books.google.com/?id=Xe_fAAAAMAAJ| year = 1897| publisher = C.

[[Herodotus]] writes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Herodotus|title=The Histories Book 3.80‚Äì83}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the native leadership debated the best form of government for the empire. It was agreed that an [[oligarchy]] would divide them against one another, and democracy would bring about [[Ochlocracy|mob rule]] resulting in a charismatic leader resuming the monarchy. Therefore, they decided a new monarch was in order, particularly since ''they'' were in a position to choose him. Darius I was chosen monarch from among the leaders. He was cousin to Cambyses II and Bardiya (Smerdis), claiming [[Ariaramnes]] as his ancestor.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

The Achaemenids thereafter consolidated areas firmly under their control. It was [[Cyrus the Great]] and [[Darius the Great]] who, by sound and far-sighted administrative planning, brilliant military manoeuvring, and a humanistic world view, established the greatness of the Achaemenids and, in less than thirty years, raised them from an obscure tribe to a world power. It was during the reign of Darius the Great (Darius I) that [[Persepolis]] was built (518‚Äì516 BC) and which would serve as capital for several generations of Achaemenid kings. [[Ecbatana]] (''HagmatƒÅna'' "City of Gatherings", modern: [[Hamadan]]) in Media was greatly expanded during this period and served as the summer capital.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Ever since the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] king [[Amyntas I]] surrendered his country to the Persians in about 512‚Äì511, Macedonians and Persians were strangers no more as well. Subjugation of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] was part of Persian military operations initiated by [[Darius the Great]] (521‚Äì486) in 513 ‚Äì after immense preparations ‚Äì a huge Achaemenid army invaded the [[Balkans]] and [[European Scythian campaign of Darius I|tried to defeat]] the European [[Scythians]] roaming to the north of the [[Danube]] river.&lt;ref name="books.google.nl"&gt;Joseph Roisman,Ian Worthington[https://books.google.com/booksid=QsJ183uUDkMC&amp;pg=PA345&amp;lpg=PA345&amp;dq=Achaemenid+Persians+ruled+balkans&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=K7qasgPG1K&amp;sig=lkiajbVuNcHEbI5Lz3MnvIUBG1U&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sb6RVP2qHoPUaqeGgZgE&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Achaemenid%20Persians%20ruled%20balkans&amp;f=false ''A Companion to Ancient Macedonia'']. pp.&amp;nbsp;342‚Äì345.

The Balkans provided many soldiers for the multi-ethnic Achaemenid army. Many of the Macedonian and Persian elite intermarried, such as the Persian official Bubares who married Amyntas' daughter, Gygaea. Family ties the Macedonian rulers Amyntas and Alexander enjoyed with Bubares ensured them good relations with the Persian kings Darius and [[Xerxes I]]. The Persian invasion led indirectly to Macedonia's rise in power and Persia had some common interests in the Balkans; with Persian aid, the Macedonians stood to gain much at the expense of some Balkan tribes such as the Paeonians and Greeks. All in all, the Macedonians were "willing and useful Persian allies. Macedonian soldiers fought against Athens and [[Sparta]] in Xerxes' army.&lt;ref name="books.google.nl"/&gt; The Persians referred to both Greeks and Macedonians as ''[[Yona|Yauna]]'' ("[[Ionian Greeks|Ionians]]", their term for "Greeks"), and to Macedonians specifically as ''Yaun√£ Takabara'' or "Greeks with hats that look like shields", possibly referring to the Macedonian [[kausia]] hat.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Engels, "Ch. 5: Macedonians and Greeks", In: Roisman and Worthington, "A companion to Ancient Macedonia", p. 87.

The [[Ionian Revolt]] in 499 BC, and associated revolts in Aeolis, Doris, Cyprus and Caria, were military rebellions by several regions of Asia Minor against Persian rule, lasting from 499 to 493 BC. At the heart of the rebellion was the dissatisfaction of the Greek cities of Asia Minor with the tyrants appointed by Persia to rule them, along with the individual actions of two Milesian tyrants, [[Histiaeus]] and [[Aristagoras]]. In 499 BC, the then tyrant of [[Miletus]], Aristagoras, launched a joint expedition with the Persian satrap Artaphernes to conquer [[Naxos (island)|Naxos]], in an attempt to bolster his position in Miletus (both financially and in terms of prestige). The mission was a debacle, and sensing his imminent removal as tyrant, Aristagoras chose to incite the whole of Ionia into rebellion against the Persian king Darius the Great.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

The Persians continued to reduce the cities along the west coast that still held out against them, before finally imposing a peace settlement in 493 BC on Ionia that was generally considered to be both just and fair. The [[Ionian Revolt]] constituted the first major conflict between Greece and the Achaemenid Empire, and as such represents the first phase of the Greco-Persian Wars. Asia Minor had been brought back into the Persian fold, but Darius had vowed to punish Athens and Eretria for their support of the revolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Willis Mason West| title = The ancient world from the earliest times to 800 CE| url = https://books.google.com/?id=168XAAAAIAAJ| year = 1904| publisher = Allyn and Bacon| page = 137| quote = The Athenian support was particularly troubling to Darius since he had come to their aid during their conflict with Sparta}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, seeing that the political situation in Greece posed a continued threat to the stability of his Empire, he decided to embark on the conquest of all of Greece. The first campaign of the invasion was to bring the territories in the [[Balkan]] peninsula back within the empire.&lt;ref name="A companion to Ancient Macedonia"&gt;Joseph Roisman,Ian Worthington.

In 492 BC, the Persian general [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]] re-subjugated [[Thrace]] and made [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]] a fully [[subordinate]] part of the empire; it had been a vassal as early as the late 6th century BC, but retained a great deal of autonomy.&lt;ref name="A companion to Ancient Macedonia"/&gt; However, in 490 BC the Persian forces were defeated by the Athenians at the [[Battle of Marathon]] and Darius would die before having the chance to launch an invasion of Greece.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

[[File:Map Greco-Persian Wars-en.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|Map showing events of the first phases of the Greco-Persian Wars]]
[[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes I]] (485‚Äì465 BC, Old Persian ''X≈°ayƒÅr≈°a'' "Hero Among Kings"), son of [[Darius I]], vowed to complete the job. He organized a massive invasion aiming to conquer [[Greece]]. His army entered Greece from the north, meeting little or no resistance through [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and [[Thessaly]], but was delayed by a small Greek force for three days at [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]]. A simultaneous naval battle at Artemisium was tactically indecisive as large storms destroyed ships from both sides. The battle was stopped prematurely when the Greeks received news of the defeat at Thermopylae and retreated. The battle was a strategic victory for the Persians, giving them uncontested control of Artemisium and the Aegean Sea.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Following his victory at the [[Battle of Thermopylae]], Xerxes sacked the evacuated city of [[Athens]] and prepared to meet the Greeks at the strategic [[Isthmus of Corinth]] and the [[Saronic Gulf]]. In 480 BC the Greeks won a decisive victory over the Persian fleet at the [[Battle of Salamis]] and forced Xerxes to retire to [[Sardis]]. The land army which he left in Greece under [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]] retook Athens but was eventually destroyed in 479 BC at the [[Battle of Plataea]]. The final defeat of the Persians at [[Battle of Mycale|Mycale]] encouraged the Greek cities of Asia to revolt, and the Persians lost all of their territories in Europe; Macedonia once again became independent.&lt;ref name="books.google.nl"/&gt;

===Cultural phase===
After [[Xerxes I]] was assassinated, he was succeeded by his eldest son [[Artaxerxes I]]. It was during his reign that [[Elamite]] ceased to be the language of government, and Aramaic gained in importance. It was probably during this reign that the solar calendar was introduced as the national calendar. Under Artaxerxes I, [[Zoroastrianism]] became the ''de facto'' religion of state.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

After Persia had been defeated at [[Battle of Eurymedon]] (469 BC or 466 BC&lt;ref&gt;See discussion on possible dates for the battle in the article [[Battle of the Eurymedon]].&lt;/ref&gt;), military action between Greece and Persia was halted. When Artaxerxes&amp;nbsp;I took power, he introduced a new Persian strategy of weakening the Athenians by funding their enemies in Greece. This indirectly caused the Athenians to move the treasury of the [[Delian League]] from the island of [[Delos]] to the Athenian acropolis. This funding practice inevitably prompted renewed fighting in 450&amp;nbsp;BC, where the Greeks attacked at the [[Battle of Salamis in Cyprus (450&amp;nbsp;BC)|Battle of Cyprus]]. After [[Cimon]]'s failure to attain much in this expedition, the [[Peace of Callias]] was agreed between [[Athens]], [[Argos]] and [[Persia]] in 449&amp;nbsp;BC.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Artaxerxes&amp;nbsp;I offered [[Political asylum|asylum]] to [[Themistocles]], who was the winner of the [[Battle of Salamis]], after Themistocles was [[ostracized]] from [[Athens]]. Also, Artaxerxes I gave him [[Magnesia on the Maeander|Magnesia]], [[Myus]], and [[Lampsacus]] to maintain him in bread, meat, and wine. In addition, Artaxerxes I gave him [[Palaescepsis]] to provide him with clothes, and he also gave him [[Percote]] with bedding for his house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plutarch.classicauthors.net/PlutarchsLives/PlutarchsLives3.html|title=Plutarch's Lives by Plutarch: Themistocles Themistocles, Part II|last=|first=|date=2015-10-01|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001032753/http://plutarch.classicauthors.net/PlutarchsLives/PlutarchsLives3.html|archive-date=2015-10-01|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Artaxerxes died in 424 BC at [[Susa]], his body was taken to the tomb already built for him in the [[Naqsh-e Rustam]] Necropolis. It was Persian tradition that kings begin constructing their own tombs while they were still alive. Artaxerxes I was immediately succeeded by his eldest son [[Xerxes II]], who was the only legitimate son of Artaxerxes.{{sfn|Kuhrt|2013|page=880}} However, after a few days on the throne, he was assassinated while drunk by Pharnacyas and Menostanes on the orders of his illegitimate brother: [[Sogdianus]] who apparently had gained the support of his regions. He reigned for six months and fifteen days before being captured by his half-brother, [[Darius II|Ochus]], who had rebelled against him. Sogdianus was executed by being [[Suffocation in ash|suffocated in ash]] because Ochus had promised he would not die by the sword, by poison or by hunger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kitto|first= J|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wd0-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PR98-IA43|title=Palestine: the Bible History of the holy land|publisher= London|year= 1841| page=657}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ochus then took the royal name Darius II. Darius' ability to defend his position on the throne ended the short power vacuum.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

From 412 BC [[Darius II of Persia|Darius II]], at the insistence of [[Tissaphernes]], gave support first to Athens, then to Sparta, but in 407 BC, Darius' son [[Cyrus the Younger]] was appointed to replace Tissaphernes and aid was given entirely to Sparta which finally defeated Athens in 404 BC. In the same year, Darius fell ill and died in Babylon. His death gave an Egyptian rebel named [[Amyrtaeus]] the opportunity to throw off [[Twenty-seventh Dynasty of Egypt|Persian control over Egypt]]. At his death bed, Darius' Babylonian wife [[Parysatis]] pleaded with him to have her second eldest son Cyrus (the Younger) crowned, but Darius refused. Queen Parysatis favoured Cyrus more than her eldest son [[Artaxerxes II]]. [[Plutarch]] relates (probably on the authority of [[Ctesias]]) that the displaced Tissaphernes came to the new king on his coronation day to warn him that his younger brother Cyrus (the Younger) was preparing to assassinate him during the ceremony. Artaxerxes had Cyrus arrested and would have had him executed if their mother Parysatis had not intervened. Cyrus was then sent back as Satrap of Lydia, where he prepared an armed rebellion. Cyrus hired an army of [[Ten Thousand Greek mercenaries]] and made his way deeper into Persia. The army of Cyrus was stopped by the royal Persian army of [[Artaxerxes II]] at [[Battle of Cunaxa|Cunaxa]] in 401 BC, where Cyrus was killed. The [[Ten Thousand Greek Mercenaries]] including [[Xenophon]] were now deep in Persian territory and were at risk of attack. So they searched for others to offer their services to but eventually had to return to Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Whittemore Mather (ed.), Joseph William Hewitt (ed.), [[Xenophon]]: ''Anabasis, Books 1‚Äì4''. University of Oklahoma Press, 1979, {{ISBN|978-0-8061-1347-0}}, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=dQltw0UIC2UC&amp;pg=PA44 44]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Artaxerxes II]] was the longest reigning of the Achaemenid kings and it was during this 45-year period of relative peace and stability that many of the monuments of the era were constructed. Artaxerxes moved the capital back to [[Persepolis]], which he greatly extended. Also the summer capital at [[Ecbatana]] was lavishly extended with gilded columns and roof tiles of silver and copper.&lt;ref&gt;(Polybius, 27 October 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The extraordinary innovation of the Zoroastrian shrines can also be dated to his reign, and it was probably during this period that Zoroastrianism spread from [[Armenia]] throughout [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Levant]]. The construction of temples, though serving a religious purpose, was not a purely selfless act, as they also served as an important source of income. From the Babylonian kings, the Achaemenids had taken over the concept of a mandatory temple tax, a one-tenth tithe which all inhabitants paid to the temple nearest to their land or other source of income.&lt;ref&gt;(Dandamaev &amp; Lukonin, 1989:361‚Äì362)&lt;/ref&gt; A share of this income called the ''Quppu Sha Sharri'', "king's chest"‚Äîan ingenious institution originally introduced by [[Nabonidus]]‚Äîwas then turned over to the ruler. In retrospect, Artaxerxes is generally regarded as an amiable man who lacked the moral fiber to be a really successful ruler. However, six centuries later [[Ardeshir I]], founder of the [[second Persian Empire]], would consider himself Artaxerxes' successor, a grand testimony to the importance of Artaxerxes to the Persian psyche.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

[[File:Achaemenid Empire.gif|thumb|upright=1.6|Persian Empire timeline including important events and territorial evolution]]
Artaxerxes II became involved in a war with Persia's erstwhile allies, the [[Sparta]]ns, who, under [[Agesilaus II]], invaded [[Asia Minor]]. In order to redirect the Spartans' attention to Greek affairs, Artaxerxes II subsidized their enemies: in particular the [[Athens|Athenians]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebans]] and [[Corinth]]ians. These subsidies helped to engage the [[Sparta]]ns in what would become known as the [[Corinthian War]]. In 387 BC, Artaxerxes II betrayed his allies and came to an arrangement with Sparta, and in the [[Treaty of Antalcidas]] he forced his erstwhile allies to come to terms. This treaty restored control of the Greek cities of [[Ionia]] and [[Aeolis]] on the Anatolian coast to the Persians, while giving Sparta dominance on the Greek mainland. In 385 BC he [[Artaxerxes' II Cadusian Campaign|campaigned against the Cadusians]]. Although successful against the Greeks, Artaxerxes II had more trouble with the [[Egypt]]ians, who had successfully revolted against him at the beginning of his reign. An attempt to reconquer Egypt in 373 BC was completely unsuccessful, but in his waning years the Persians did manage to defeat a joint Egyptian‚ÄìSpartan effort to conquer [[Achaemenid Phoenicia|Phoenicia]]. He quashed the [[Revolt of the Satraps]] in 372‚Äì362 BC. He is reported to have had a number of wives. His main wife was [[Stateira (wife of Artaxerxes II)|Stateira]], until she was poisoned by Artaxerxes II's mother Parysatis in about 400 BC. Another chief wife was a Greek woman of [[Phocaea]] named Aspasia (not the same as the concubine of [[Pericles]]). Artaxerxes II is said to have had more than 115 sons from 350 wives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Achaemenid Empire |url=http://iranologie.com/the-history-page/the-achaemenid-empire/ |accessdate=2015-06-21 }}[http://www.iranologie.com/history/Achaemenid/chapter%20V.html &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619124220/http://www.iranologie.com/history/Achaemenid/chapter%20V.html |date=19 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 358 BC Artaxerxes II died and was succeeded by his son [[Artaxerxes III]]. In 355 BC, Artaxerxes III forced [[Athens]] to conclude a peace which required the city's forces to leave [[Asia Minor]] and to acknowledge the independence of its rebellious allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lexicorient.com/e.o/artaxerxes3.htm |title=Artaxerxes 3 |accessdate=March 5, 2008 |last=Kjeilen |first=Tore| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080225213722/http://lexicorient.com/e.o/artaxerxes3.htm| archivedate=25 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artaxerxes started a campaign against the rebellious [[Cadusii|Cadusians]], but he managed to appease both of the Cadusian kings. One individual who successfully emerged from this campaign was Darius Codomannus, who later occupied the Persian throne as [[Darius III]].{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Artaxerxes III then ordered the disbanding of all the satrapal armies of Asia Minor, as he felt that they could no longer guarantee peace in the west and was concerned that these armies equipped the western satraps with the means to revolt.&lt;ref name="PersianArmy"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Persian Army 560‚Äì330 BC: 560‚Äì330 BC |last=Sekunda |first=Nick |author2=Nicholas V.

Athens sent assistance to [[Sardis]]. [[Orontid dynasty#Orontids Kings and satraps of Armenia|Orontes of Mysia]] also supported Artabazos and the combined forces managed to defeat the forces sent by Artaxerxes III in 354&amp;nbsp;BC. However, in 353&amp;nbsp;BC, they were defeated by Artaxerxes III's army and were disbanded. Orontes was pardoned by the king, while Artabazos fled to the safety of the court of [[Philip II of Macedon]]. In around 351 BC, Artaxerxes embarked on a campaign to recover Egypt, which had revolted under his father, Artaxerxes II. At the same time a rebellion had broken out in Asia Minor, which, being supported by [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], threatened to become serious. Levying a vast army, Artaxerxes marched into Egypt, and engaged [[Nectanebo II]]. After a year of fighting the Egyptian [[Pharaoh]], Nectanebo inflicted a crushing defeat on the Persians with the support of mercenaries led by the Greek generals Diophantus and Lamius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Ancient Israel and Judah |last=Miller |first=James M. |others=John Haralson Hayes (photographer) |year=1986 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |isbn=978-0-664-21262-9 |page=465}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artaxerxes was compelled to retreat and postpone his plans to reconquer Egypt.

In 343&amp;nbsp;BC, Artaxerxes committed responsibility for the suppression of the Cyprian rebels to [[Idrieus]], prince of [[Caria]], who employed 8,000 Greek mercenaries and forty [[trireme]]s, commanded by [[Phocion]] the Athenian, and Evagoras, son of the elder [[Evagoras I|Evagoras]], the Cypriot monarch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Discoveries at Halicarnassus, Cnidus &amp; Branchid√¶ |last=Newton |first=Sir Charles Thomas |author2=R.P.

Artaxerxes initiated a counter-offensive against [[Sidon]] by commanding Belesys, satrap of Syria, and Mezseus, [[Cilicia (satrapy)|satrap of Cilicia]], to invade the city and to keep the [[Phoenicia]]ns in check. Both satraps suffered crushing defeats at the hands of Tennes, the Sidonese king, who was aided by 40,000 Greek mercenaries sent to him by [[Nectanebo II]] and commanded by [[Mentor of Rhodes]]. As a result, the Persian forces were driven out of [[Phoenicia]].&lt;ref name="Persianempire"/&gt;

After this, Artaxerxes personally led an army of 330,000 men against [[Sidon]]. Artaxerxes' army comprised 300,000 foot soldiers, 30,000 [[cavalry]], 300 triremes, and 500 transports or provision ships. After gathering this army, he sought assistance from the Greeks. Though refused aid by [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]], he succeeded in obtaining a thousand Theban heavy-armed hoplites under Lacrates, three thousand Argives under Nicostratus, and six thousand √Üolians, [[Ionians]], and Dorians from the Greek cities of Asia Minor. This Greek support was numerically small, amounting to no more than 10,000 men, but it formed, together with the Greek mercenaries from Egypt who went over to him afterwards, the force on which he placed his chief reliance, and to which the ultimate success of his expedition was mainly due. The approach of Artaxerxes sufficiently weakened the resolution of Tennes that he endeavoured to purchase his own pardon by delivering up 100 principal citizens of Sidon into the hands of the Persian king, and then admitting Artaxerxes within the defences of the town. Artaxerxes had the 100 citizens transfixed with javelins, and when 500 more came out as supplicants to seek his mercy, Artaxerxes consigned them to the same fate. Sidon was then burnt to the ground, either by Artaxerxes or by the Sidonian citizens. Forty thousand people died in the conflagration.&lt;ref name=Persianempire/&gt; Artaxerxes sold the ruins at a high price to speculators, who calculated on reimbursing themselves by the treasures which they hoped to dig out from among the ashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tomrawlinson.com/Personal/Links/RawlinsonGeorge.htm |title=Ph≈ìnicia under the Persians |accessdate=March 10, 2008 |last=Rawlinson |first=George |authorlink=George Rawlinson |year=1889 |website=History of Phoenicia |publisher=Longmans, Green |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720031359/http://www.tomrawlinson.com/Personal/Links/RawlinsonGeorge.htm |archivedate=20 July 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tennes was later put to death by Artaxerxes.&lt;ref name=Lovetoknow&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Artaxerxes |volume=2 |page=663}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artaxerxes later sent Jews who supported the revolt to [[Hyrcania]] on the south coast of the [[Caspian Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iras.ucalgary.ca/~volk/sylvia/GogAndMagog.htm |title=The Legend Of Gog And Magog |accessdate=March 10, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315084037/http://www.iras.ucalgary.ca/~volk/sylvia/GogAndMagog.htm |archivedate=15 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Acts of the Apostles: The Greek Text with Introduction and Commentary |last=Bruce |first=Frederick Fyvie |year=1990 |publisher=Wm.

===Second conquest of Egypt===

The reduction of Sidon was followed closely by the invasion of Egypt. In 343&amp;nbsp;BC, Artaxerxes, in addition to his 330,000 Persians, had now a force of 14,000 Greeks furnished by the Greek cities of Asia Minor: 4,000 under [[Mentor of Rhodes|Mentor]], consisting of the troops that he had brought to the aid of Tennes from Egypt; 3,000 sent by Argos; and 1000 from Thebes. He divided these troops into three bodies, and placed at the head of each a Persian and a Greek. The Greek commanders were Lacrates of Thebes, [[Mentor of Rhodes]] and Nicostratus of Argos while the Persians were led by Rhossaces, Aristazanes, and [[Bagoas]], the chief of the eunuchs. [[Nectanebo II]] resisted with an army of 100,000 of whom 20,000 were Greek mercenaries. Nectanebo II occupied the [[Nile]] and its various branches with his large navy.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

The character of the country, intersected by numerous canals and full of strongly fortified towns, was in his favour and Nectanebo II might have been expected to offer a prolonged, if not even a successful, resistance. However, he lacked good generals, and, over-confident in his own powers of command, he was out-manoeuvred by the Greek mercenary generals and his forces were eventually defeated by the combined Persian armies at the [[Battle of Pelusium (343 BC)]]. After his defeat, Nectanebo hastily fled to [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], leaving the fortified towns to be defended by their garrisons. These garrisons consisted of partly [[Greeks|Greek]] and partly Egyptian troops; between whom jealousies and suspicions were easily sown by the Persian leaders. As a result, the Persians were able to rapidly reduce numerous towns across Lower Egypt and were advancing upon Memphis when Nectanebo decided to quit the country and flee southwards to [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref name="Persianempire"/&gt; The Persian army completely routed the Egyptians and occupied the Lower Delta of the Nile. Following Nectanebo fleeing to Ethiopia, all of Egypt submitted to Artaxerxes. The Jews in Egypt were sent either to [[Babylon]] or to the south coast of the [[Caspian Sea]], the same location that the Jews of [[Phoenicia]] had earlier been sent.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

After this victory over the Egyptians, Artaxerxes had the city walls destroyed, started a reign of terror, and set about looting all the temples. [[Persia]] gained a significant amount of wealth from this looting. Artaxerxes also raised high taxes and attempted to weaken [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] enough that it could never revolt against Persia. For the 10&amp;nbsp;years that Persia controlled Egypt, believers in the native religion were persecuted and sacred books were stolen.&lt;ref name="Egyptloot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/prehistory/egypt/history/periods/persianii.html |title=Persian Period II |accessdate=March 6, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217023749/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/prehistory/egypt/history/periods/persianii.html |archivedate=17 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before he returned to Persia, he appointed Pherendares as [[History of Achaemenid Egypt|satrap of Egypt]]. With the wealth gained from his reconquering Egypt, Artaxerxes was able to amply reward his mercenaries. He then returned to his capital having successfully completed his invasion of Egypt.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

After his success in Egypt, Artaxerxes returned to Persia and spent the next few years effectively quelling insurrections in various parts of the Empire so that a few years after his conquest of Egypt, the Persian Empire was firmly under his control. Egypt remained a part of the Persian Empire until [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquest of Egypt.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

After the conquest of Egypt, there were no more revolts or rebellions against Artaxerxes. Mentor and [[Bagoas]], the two generals who had most distinguished themselves in the Egyptian campaign, were advanced to posts of the highest importance. Mentor, who was governor of the entire Asiatic seaboard, was successful in reducing to subjection many of the chiefs who during the recent troubles had rebelled against Persian rule. In the course of a few years Mentor and his forces were able to bring the whole Asian Mediterranean coast into complete submission and dependence.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Bagoas went back to the Persian capital with Artaxerxes, where he took a leading role in the internal administration of the Empire and maintained tranquillity throughout the rest of the Empire. During the last six years of the reign of Artaxerxes III, the Persian Empire was governed by a vigorous and successful government.&lt;ref name="Persianempire" /&gt;

The Persian forces in [[Ionia]] and [[Lycia]] regained control of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and took over much of [[Athens]]' former island empire. In response, [[Isocrates]] of Athens started giving speeches calling for a 'crusade against the barbarians' but there was not enough strength left in any of the Greek city-states to answer his call.&lt;ref name="conspiracy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranologie.com/history/Achaemenid/chapter%20V.html |title=Chapter V: Temporary Relief |accessdate=March 1, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619124220/http://www.iranologie.com/history/Achaemenid/chapter%20V.html |archivedate=19 June 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there weren't any rebellions in the Persian Empire itself, the growing power and territory of [[Philip II of Macedon]] in [[Macedon]] (against which [[Demosthenes]] was in vain warning the Athenians) attracted the attention of Artaxerxes. In response, he ordered that Persian influence was to be used to check and constrain the rising power and influence of the Macedonian kingdom.

Artaxerxes III was succeeded by [[Artaxerxes IV Arses]], who before he could act was also poisoned by Bagoas. Bagoas is further said to have killed not only all Arses' children, but many of the other princes of the land. Bagoas then placed [[Darius III]], a nephew of Artaxerxes IV, on the throne. Darius III, previously [[Orontid Dynasty|Satrap of Armenia]], personally forced Bagoas to swallow poison. In 334 BC, when Darius was just succeeding in subduing Egypt again, Alexander and his battle-hardened troops [[Wars of Alexander the Great|invaded Asia Minor]].{{cn|date=January 2018}}

[[Alexander the Great]] (Alexander III of Macedon) defeated the Persian armies at [[Battle of Granicus|Granicus]] (334 BC), followed by [[Battle of Issus|Issus]] (333 BC), and lastly at [[Battle of Gaugamela|Gaugamela]] (331 BC). Afterwards, he marched on [[Susa]] and [[Persepolis]] which surrendered in early 330 BC. From Persepolis, Alexander headed north to Pasargadae where he visited the [[tomb of Cyrus]], the burial of the man whom he had heard of from the ''[[Cyropedia]]''.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

In the ensuing chaos created by Alexander's invasion of Persia, Cyrus's tomb was broken into and most of its luxuries were looted. When Alexander reached the tomb, he was horrified by the manner in which it had been treated, and questioned the Magi, putting them on trial.&lt;ref name=Cleveland&gt;{{cite book| authors = ((grk.)

Darius III was taken prisoner by [[Bessus]], his [[Bactria]]n [[satrap]] and kinsman. As Alexander approached, Bessus had his men murder Darius III and then declared himself Darius' successor, as Artaxerxes V, before retreating into Central Asia leaving Darius' body in the road to delay Alexander, who brought it to Persepolis for an honourable funeral. Bessus would then create a coalition of his forces, in order to create an army to defend against Alexander.

The largest of these, which held sway over the Iranian plateau, was the [[Seleucid Empire]], ruled by Alexander's general [[Seleucus I Nicator]]. Native Iranian rule would be restored by the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] of northeastern Iran over the course of the 2nd century BC.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

===Descendants in later Iranian dynasties===
[[Istakhr]], one of the vassal kingdoms of the [[Parthian Empire]], would be overthrown by Papak, a priest of the temple there. Papak's son, Arda≈°ir I, who named himself in remembrance of Artaxerxes II, would revolt against the Parthians, eventually defeating them and establishing the [[Sassanid Empire]] or as it is known the second Persian Empire.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

The Achaemenid line would be carried on through the [[Kingdom of Pontus]], based in the [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] region of northern [[Asia Minor]].

The kingdom grew to its largest extent under [[Mithridates VI]] the Great, who conquered [[Colchis]], [[Cappadocia]], [[Bithynia]], the Greek colonies of the [[Chersonesus Taurica|Tauric Chersonesos]] and for a brief time the Roman province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]]. Thus, this Persian dynasty managed to survive and prosper in the [[Hellenistic world]] while the main Persian Empire had fallen.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Both the later dynasties of the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanians]] would on occasion claim Achaemenid descent. Recently there has been some corroboration for the Parthian claim to Achaemenid ancestry via the possibility of an inherited disease (neurofibromatosis) demonstrated by the physical descriptions of rulers and from evidence of familial disease on ancient coinage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ashrafian, Hutan.|title=Limb gigantism, neurofibromatosis and royal heredity in the Ancient World 2500 years ago: Achaemenids and Parthians|journal=J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg|volume=64|year=2011|page=557|doi=10.1016/j.bjps.2010.08.025|url=http://www.jprasurg.com/article/S1748-6815(10)00521-8/pdf%7C.|issue=4|pmid=20832372}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes of decline===
Part of the cause of the Empire's decline had been the heavy tax burden put upon the state, which eventually led to economic decline.&lt;ref&gt;A.T. Olmstead, ''History of the Persian Empire'', chapter XXI: "Overtaxation and Its Results", University of Chicago Press, 1948, p.&amp;nbsp;289‚Äì301&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Penguin Encyclopedia of Ancient Civilizations'', ed. Arthur Cotterell, Penguin Books Ltd., London, 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;154&lt;/ref&gt; An estimate of the tribute imposed on the subject nations was up to U.S. $180M per year. This does not include the material goods and supplies that were supplied as taxes.&lt;ref name="Will Durant p.&amp;nbsp;363"&gt;Will Durant, ''Our Oriental Heritage,'' Simon and Schuster, Inc., New York, 1935, p.&amp;nbsp;363&lt;/ref&gt; After the high overhead of government ‚Äì the military, the bureaucracy, whatever the satraps could safely dip into the coffers for themselves ‚Äì this money went into the royal treasury. According to Diodorus, at Persepolis, Alexander III found some 180,000 [[Attic talent]]s of silver besides the additional treasure the Macedonians were carrying that already had been seized in Damascus by [[Parmenion]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Robinson Jr., ''Ancient History'', 2nd ed., MacMillan Company, New York, 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;328, 338&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=citation is a rarely accepted "fact" that is based on a most unreliable account (Diodorus) who moreover himself lived two centuries later|date=October 2015}} This amounted to U.S. $2.7B.

Another factor contributing to the decline of the Empire, in the period following Xerxes, was its failure to ever mold the many subject nations into a whole; the creation of a national identity was never attempted.&lt;ref&gt;Will Durant, ''Our Oriental Heritage,'' Simon and Schuster, Inc., New York, 1935, p.&amp;nbsp;382&lt;/ref&gt; This lack of cohesion eventually affected the efficiency of the military.&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Fox, ''The Search For Alexander'', Little Brown and Co., Boston, 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;121‚Äì122&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==
[[File:Cylinder Seal, Achaemenid, modern impression 05.jpg|thumb|right|Modern impression of Achaemenid [[cylinder seal]]. The use of cylinder seals appears to have been restricted to officials of the royal administration during this period.&lt;ref&gt;Collon, Dominique, ''First Impressions, Cylinder Seals in the Ancient Near East'': p.&amp;nbsp;90, British Museum Press, 1987, 2005. {{ISBN|0-7141-1136-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Cyrus the Great]] founded the empire as a multi-[[State (polity)|state]] empire, governed from four capital cities: [[Pasargadae]], [[Babylon]], [[Susa]] and [[Ecbatana]]. The Achaemenids allowed a certain amount of regional autonomy in the form of the [[satrap]]y system. A satrapy was an administrative unit, usually organized on a geographical basis. A '[[satrap]]' (governor) was the governor who administered the region, a 'general' supervised military recruitment and ensured order, and a 'state secretary' kept the official records. The general and the state secretary reported directly to the satrap as well as the central government. At differing times, there were between 20 and 30 satrapies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSm68TxRBRo ''Engineering an Empire ‚Äì The Persians'']. Broadcast of ''[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]'', narrated by [[Peter Weller]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyrus the Great created an organized army including the [[Persian Immortals|Immortals]] unit, consisting of 10,000 highly trained soldiers&lt;ref name=army&gt;{{cite book| author = Pierre Briant| title = From Cyrus to Alexander: A History of the Persian Empire| url = https://books.google.com/?id=lxQ9W6F1oSYC| year = 2006| publisher = Eisenbrauns| isbn = 978-1-57506-120-7| page = 261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyrus also formed an innovative [[postal system]] throughout the empire, based on several relay stations called [[Chapar Khaneh]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, Herodotus, trans. A.D. Godley, vol. 4, book 8, verse 98, pp. 96‚Äì97 (1924).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Achaemenid coinage===
{{Main|Achaemenid coinage}}
[[File:Double daric 330-300 obverse CdM Paris.jpg|thumb|right|[[Daric]] of Artaxerxes II]]
The Persian [[daric]] was the first [[gold coin]] which, along with a similar silver coin, the [[siglos]], introduced the bimetallic [[monetary standard]] of the Achaemenid Persian Empire which has continued till today.&lt;ref name=iranica&gt;Michael Alram, [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/daric "DARIC"], ''[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]'', December 15, 1994, last updated November 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This was accomplished by [[Darius the Great]], who reinforced the empire and expanded [[Persepolis]] as a ceremonial capital;&lt;ref&gt;''Persepolis Recreated'', NEJ International Pictures; 1st edition (2005) {{ISBN|978-964-06-4525-3}} {{ASIN|B000J5N46S}}, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCwxJsk14e4&lt;/ref&gt; he revolutionized the economy by placing it on the silver and gold coinage.

===Tax districts===
{{see also|Districts of the Achaemenid Empire}}
Darius also introduced a regulated and sustainable tax system that was precisely tailored to each satrapy, based on their supposed productivity and their economic potential. For instance, [[Babylon]] was assessed for the highest amount and for a startling mixture of commodities ‚Äì 1000 [[Talent (measurement)|silver talents]], four months supply of food for the army. [[Hindush|India]] was clearly already fabled for its gold; [[Egypt]] was known for the wealth of its crops; it was to be the granary of the Persian Empire (as later of Rome's) and was required to provide 120,000 measures of grain in addition to 700 talents of silver. This was exclusively a tax levied on subject peoples.&lt;ref name="historyworld.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?historyid=aa65 |title=History Of Iran (Persia) |publisher=Historyworld.net |accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other accomplishments of Darius' reign included [[codification (law)|codification]] of the data, a universal legal system, and construction of a new capital at Persepolis.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Under the Achaemenids, the trade was extensive and there was an efficient infrastructure that facilitated the exchange of commodities in the far reaches of the empire. Tariffs on trade were one of the empire's main sources of revenue, along with agriculture and tribute.&lt;ref name="historyworld.net"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1902encyclopedia.com/D/DAR/darius-i-the-great.html |title=Darius I (Darius the Great), King of Persia (from 521 BC) |publisher=1902encyclopedia.com |accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The satrapies were linked by a 2,500-kilometer highway, the most impressive stretch being the [[Royal Road]] from [[Susa]] to [[Sardis]], built by command of Darius I. It featured stations and [[caravanserai]]s at specific intervals. The relays of mounted couriers (the [[angarium]]) could reach the remotest of areas in fifteen days. Herodotus observes that "there is nothing in the world that travels faster than these Persian couriers. Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night stays these courageous couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds."&lt;ref&gt;The words are actually inscribed on the [[frieze]] of the [[James A. Farley Post Office Building]] in the borough of Manhattan in New York City, New York. The inscription is based on: Herodotus with George Rawlinson, trans., ''The History of Herodotus'' (New York, New York: Tandy-Thomas Co., 1909), vol. 4, Book 8, ¬ß 98, [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x000329532;view=1up;seq=163 p. 147.]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the relative local independence afforded by the satrapy system, royal inspectors, the "eyes and ears of the king", toured the empire and reported on local conditions.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

The practice of slavery in Achaemenid Persia was generally banned, although there is evidence that conquered and/or rebellious armies were sold into captivity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Muhammad Dandamayev|M. Dandamayev]], "Foreign Slaves on the Estates of the Achaemenid Kings and their Nobles," in Trudy dvadtsat' pyatogo mezhdunarodnogo kongressa vostokovedov II, Moscow, 1963, pp. 151‚Äì52&lt;/ref&gt; The kings of Achaemenid Persia, especially the founder [[Cyrus the Great]], occasionally declined to adopt slavery, as evidenced by the freeing of the Jews at Babylon, and the construction of Persepolis by paid workers.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

==Military==
Despite its humble origins in Persis, the empire reached an enormous size under the leadership of [[Cyrus the Great]]. Cyrus created a multi-state empire where he allowed regional rulers, called the "[[satrap]]", to rule as his proxy over a certain designated area of his empire called the [[satrapy]]. The basic rule of governance was based upon loyalty and obedience of each satrapy to the central power, or the king, and compliance with tax laws.&lt;ref name=cyv/&gt; Due to the ethno-cultural diversity of the subject nations under the rule of Persia, its enormous geographic size, and the constant struggle for power by regional competitors,&lt;ref name=book/&gt; the creation of a professional army was necessary for both maintenance of the peace and to enforce the authority of the king in cases of rebellion and foreign threat.&lt;ref name=schmitt-EI-i/&gt;&lt;ref name=army/&gt; Cyrus managed to create a strong land army, using it to advance in his campaigns in [[Babylonian empire|Babylonia]], Lydia, and [[Asia Minor]], which after his death was used by his son [[Cambyses II]], in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] against [[Psamtik III]]. Cyrus would die battling a local Iranian insurgency in the empire, before he could have a chance to develop a naval force.&lt;ref&gt;A history of Greece, Volume 2, By Connop Thirlwall, Longmans, 1836, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; That task would fall to [[Darius the Great]], who would officially give Persians their own royal navy to allow them to engage their enemies on multiple seas of this vast empire, from the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Aegean Sea]], to the [[Persian Gulf]], [[Ionian Sea]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]].{{cn|date=January 2018}}

The Achaemenid infantry consisted of three groups: the [[Immortals (Persian Empire)|Immortals]], the [[Sparabara]], and the [[Takabara]], though in the later years of the Achaemenid Empire, the [[Cardaces]], were introduced.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

The [[Immortals (Persian empire)|Immortals]] were described by [[Herodotus]] as being heavy [[infantry]], led by [[Hydarnes II|Hydarnes]], that were kept constantly at a strength of exactly 10,000 men. He claimed that the unit's name stemmed from the custom that every killed, seriously wounded, or sick member was immediately replaced with a new one, maintaining the numbers and cohesion of the unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Persian Immortals |url=http://www.livius.org/ia-in/immortals/immortals.html|author=Jona Lendering|date= |website=Ancient Persia |publisher= |accessdate=6 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had wicker shields, short spears, swords or large daggers, bow and arrow. Underneath their robes they wore [[scale armour]] coats. The spear counterbalances of the common soldiery were of silver; to differentiate commanding ranks, the officers' spear butt-spikes were golden.&lt;ref name="livius.org2"&gt;[http://www.livius.org/ia-in/immortals/immortals.html]. Retrieved 16 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Surviving Achaemenid coloured glazed bricks and carved reliefs represent the Immortals as wearing elaborate robes, hoop earrings and gold jewellery, though these garments and accessories were most likely worn only for ceremonial occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Volume IX, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Fifteenth Edition 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sparabara]] were usually the first to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. Although not much is known about them today, it is believed that they were the backbone of the Persian army who formed a [[shield wall]] and used their two-metre-long spears to protect more vulnerable troops such as [[Archery|archers]] from the enemy. The Sparabara were taken from the full members of Persian society, they were trained from childhood to be soldiers and when not called out to fight on campaigns in distant lands they practised hunting on the vast plains of [[Persia]]. However, when all was quiet and the Pax Persica held true, the Sparabara returned to normal life farming the land and grazing their herds. Because of this they lacked true professional quality on the battlefield, yet they were well trained and courageous to the point of holding the line in most situations long enough for a counter-attack. They were armoured with quilted [[linen]] and carried large rectangular [[wicker]] shields as a form of light manoeuvrable defence. This, however, left them at a severe disadvantage against heavily armoured opponents such as the [[hoplite]], and his two-metre-long spear was not able to give the Sparabara ample range to plausibly engage a trained [[phalanx]]. The wicker shields were able to effectively stop arrows but not strong enough to protect the soldier from spears. However, the Sparabara could deal with most other infantry, including trained units from the East.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

The [[Takabara]] were a rare unit who were a tough type of [[peltasts]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Sekunda, ''The Persian Army 560‚Äì330 BC'', page 30, 1992, Osprey Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-85532-250-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; They tended to fight with their own native weapons which would have included a crescent-shaped light wickerwork [[shield]] and [[axe]]s as well as light linen cloth and [[leather]]. The Takabara were recruited from territories that incorporated modern Iran.

===Cavalry===

{{cquote|The armoured Persian horsemen and their death dealing chariots were invincible. No man dared face them|||[[Herodotus]]}}

The Persian cavalry was crucial for conquering nations, and maintained its importance in the Achaemenid army to the last days of the Achaemenid Empire. The cavalry were separated into four groups. The [[chariot archer]]s, [[horse cavalry]], the [[camel cavalry]], and the [[Persian war elephants|war elephants]].{{cn|date=January 2018}}

In the later years of the Achaemenid Empire, the chariot archer had become merely a ceremonial part of the Persian army, yet in the early years of the Empire, their use was widespread. The chariot archers were armed with spears, bows, arrows, swords, and [[scale armour]]. The horses were also suited with scale armour similar to scale armour of the [[Sassanian]] [[cataphract]]s. The chariots would contain imperial symbols and decorations. The horses used by the Achaemenids for cavalry were often suited with scale armour, like most cavalry units. The riders often had the same armour as Infantry units, wicker shields, short spears, swords or large daggers, bow and arrow and scale armour coats. The camel cavalry was different, because the camels and sometimes the riders, were provided little protection against enemies, yet when they were offered protection, they would have spears, swords, bow, arrow, and scale armour. The camel cavalry was first introduced into the Persian army by [[Cyrus the Great]], at the [[Battle of Thymbra]]. The elephant was most likely introduced into the Persian army by [[Darius I]] after his [[Achaemenid invasion of the Indus Valley|conquest of the Indus Valley]]. They may have been used in Greek campaigns by Darius and [[Xerxes I]], but Greek accounts only mention 15 of them being used at the [[Battle of Gaugamela]].{{cn|date=January 2018}}

===Navy===
Since its foundation by Cyrus, the Persian empire had been primarily a land empire with a strong army, but void of any actual naval forces. By the 5th century BC, this was to change, as the empire came across Greek, and Egyptian forces, each with their own maritime traditions and capabilities. [[Darius the Great]] (Darius I) was the first Achaemenid king to invest in a Persian fleet.&lt;ref name=navy&gt;{{cite book| author = Kaveh Farrokh| title = Shadows in the desert: ancient Persia at war| url = https://books.google.com/?id=p7kltwf9yrwC| year = 2007| publisher = Osprey Publishing| isbn = 978-1-84603-108-3| page = 68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even by then no true "imperial navy" had existed either in Greece or Egypt. Persia would become the first empire, under Darius, to inaugurate and deploy the first regular imperial navy.&lt;ref name=navy/&gt; Despite this achievement, the personnel for the imperial navy would not come from Iran, but were often [[Phoenicia]]ns (mostly from [[Sidon]]), [[Egyptians]] and [[Greek people|Greeks]] chosen by Darius the Great to operate the empire's combat vessels.&lt;ref name=navy/&gt;

At first the ships were built in Sidon by the Phoenicians; the first Achaemenid ships measured about 40 meters in length and 6 meters in width, able to transport up to 300 Persian [[Persian Immortals|troops]] at any one trip. Soon, other states of the empire were constructing their own ships, each incorporating slight local preferences. The ships eventually found their way to the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref name=navy/&gt; Persian naval forces laid the foundation for a strong Persian maritime presence in the Persian Gulf. Persians were not only stationed on islands in the Persian Gulf, but also had ships often of 100 to 200 capacity patrolling the empire's various rivers including the [[Karun]], [[Tigris]] and [[Nile]] in the west, as well as the [[Indus River|Indus]].&lt;ref name=navy/&gt;

[[File:Achaemenid infantry on Alexander Sarcophagus.jpg|thumb|Color reconstruction of Achaemenid infantry on the [[Alexander Sarcophagus]] (end of 4th century BC).]]
The Achaemenid navy established bases located along the Karun, and in Bahrain, Oman, and Yemen. The Persian fleet was not only used for peace-keeping purposes along the Karun but also opened the door to trade with India via the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref name=navy/&gt; Darius's navy was in many ways a world power at the time, but it would be [[Artaxerxes II]] who in the summer of 397 BC would build a formidable navy, as part of a rearmament which would lead to his decisive victory at [[Knidos]] in 394 BC, re-establishing Achaemenid power in [[Ionia]]. Artaxerxes II would also utilize his navy to later on quell a rebellion in Egypt.&lt;ref name=navi&gt;{{cite book| author = Elspeth R. M. Dusinberre| title = Aspects of empire in Achaemenid Sardis| url = https://books.google.com/?id=uWkzTBHB6ekC| year = 2002| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-81071-5| page = 42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction material of choice was wood, but some armoured Achaemenid ships had metallic blades on the front, often meant to slice enemy ships using the ship's momentum. Naval ships were also equipped with hooks on the side to grab enemy ships, or to negotiate their position. The ships were propelled by sails or manpower. The ships the Persians created were unique. As far as maritime engagement, the ships were equipped with two [[mangonel]]s that would launch projectiles such as stones, or flammable substances.&lt;ref name=navy/&gt;

[[Xenophon]] describes his eye-witness account of a massive military bridge created by joining 37 Persian ships across the Tigris. The Persians utilized each boat's buoyancy, in order to support a connected bridge above which supply could be transferred.&lt;ref name=navy/&gt; [[Herodotus]] also gives many accounts of Persians utilizing ships to build bridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia Iranica, Volume 4, Issues 5‚Äì8|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|year=1982|author=Ehsan Yar-Shater|authorlink=Ehsan Yarshater|title-link=Encyclopaedia Iranica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Persian Empire|author=John Manuel Cook|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1983|url=http://www.google.com/search?q=Achaemenid+boat+bridge&amp;tbs=bks%3A1&amp;tbo=1#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;tbo=1&amp;tbs=bks:1&amp;q=Achaemenid+boat+bridge+Bosphorus&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=f0ddf7f432501006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darius the Great, in an attempt to subdue the [[Scythia]]n horsemen north of the Black Sea, crossed over at the [[Bosphorus]], using an enormous bridge made by connecting Achaemenid boats, then marched up to the [[Danube]], crossing it by means of a second boat bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=E. V. Cernenko |author2=Angus McBride |author3=M. V. Gorelik | title = The Scythians, 700‚Äì300 BC| url = https://books.google.com/?id=ozA8d9AFiMgC| date = 1983-03-24| publisher = Osprey Publishing| isbn = 978-0-85045-478-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bridge over the Bosphorus essentially connected the nearest tip of Asia to Europe, encompassing at least some 1000 meters of open water if not more. Herodotus describes the spectacle, and calls it the "bridge of Darius":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| authors = Herodotus (Translation by George Rawlinson, Sir Henry Creswicke Rawlinson, Sir John Gardner Wilkinson); George Rawlinson; Sir Henry Creswicke Rawlinson; Sir John Gardner Wilkinson | title = The History of Herodotus: a new English version, Volume 3| url = https://books.google.com/?id=UYkOAAAAQAAJ| year = 1859| publisher = John Murray| pages = 77 (Chp. 86)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"''Strait called Bosphorus, across which the bridge of Darius had been thrown is hundred and twenty [[furlong]]s in length, reaching from the [[Euxine]], to the [[Propontis]]. The Propontis is five hundred furlongs across, and fourteen hundred long. Its waters flow into the [[Dardanelles|Hellespont]], the length of which is four hundred furlongs&amp;nbsp;...''"

Years later, a similar boat bridge would be constructed by Xerxes the Great ([[Xerxes I]]), in his invasion of Greece. Although the Persians failed to capture the Greek city states completely, the tradition of maritime involvement was carried down by the Persian kings, most notably Artaxerxes II. Years later, when Alexander invaded Persia and during his advancement into India, he took a page from the Persian art of war, by having [[Hephaestion]] and [[Perdiccas]] construct a similar boat-bridge at the Indus river, in India in the spring of 327 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Waldemar Heckel| title = Who's who in the age of Alexander the Great: prosopography of Alexander's empire| url = https://books.google.com/?id=JJ4K1wFZkrsC| year = 2006| publisher = Wiley-Blackwell| isbn = 978-1-4051-1210-9| page = 134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herodotus]], in his mid-5th century BC account of Persian residents of the [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]], reports that Persian youths, from their fifth year to their twentieth year, were instructed in three things ‚Äì ''to ride a horse, to draw a bow, and to speak the Truth''.&lt;ref name=hero&gt;{{cite book| author = Herodotus |others=Translated by George Rawlinson| title = The Histories| url = https://books.google.com/?id=YTCrx1KB3HQC| date = 2009|origyear=publication date| publisher = Digireads.Com| isbn = 978-1-4209-3305-5| pages = 43‚Äì44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He further notes that:&lt;ref name=hero/&gt;

:I was not a lie-follower, I was not a doer of wrong&amp;nbsp;... According to righteousness I conducted myself. Neither to the weak or to the powerful did I do wrong. The man who cooperated with my house, him I rewarded well; who so did injury, him I punished well.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Darius had his hands full dealing with large-scale rebellion which broke out throughout the empire. After fighting successfully with nine traitors in a year, Darius records his battles against them for posterity and tells us how it was the ''lie'' that made them rebel against the empire. At Behistun, Darius says:

:I smote them and took prisoner nine kings. One was Gaumata by name, a Magian; he lied; thus he said: I am Smerdis, the son of Cyrus&amp;nbsp;... One, Acina by name, an Elamite; he lied; thus he said: I am king in Elam&amp;nbsp;... One, Nidintu-Bel by name, a Babylonian; he lied; thus he said: I am Nebuchadnezzar, the son of Nabonidus.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

King Darius then tells us,

Then advice to his son [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]], who is to succeed him as the great king:

During the reign of Cyrus and Darius, and as long as the seat of government was still at [[Susa]] in [[Elam]], the language of the chancellery was [[Elamite language|Elamite]]. This is primarily attested in the [[Persepolis Fortification Tablets|Persepolis fortification and treasury tablets]] that reveal details of the day-to-day functioning of the empire.&lt;ref name="EIR_Dandamayev_Elamite"/&gt; In the grand rock-face inscriptions of the kings, the Elamite texts are always accompanied by [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] (Babylonian dialect) and [[Old Persian]] inscriptions, and it appears that in these cases, the Elamite texts are translations of the Old Persian ones. It is then likely that although Elamite was used by the capital government in Susa, it was not a standardized language of government everywhere in the empire. The use of Elamite is not attested after 458 BC.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Following the conquest of Mesopotamia, the [[Official Aramaic|Aramaic]] language (as used in that territory) was adopted as a "vehicle for written communication between the different regions of the vast empire with its different peoples and languages. The use of a single official language, which modern scholarship has dubbed "Official Aramaic" or "Imperial Aramaic", can be assumed to have greatly contributed to the astonishing success of the Achaemenids in holding their far-flung empire together for as long as they did."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Iranica|volume=2|year=1987|title=Aramaic&lt;!-- pp:250-261 --&gt;&lt;!-- section:Aramaic in the Achaemenid Empire pp:251/252--&gt;|last=Shaked|first=Saul|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|location=New York|pages=250‚Äì261}} p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, Richard Frye questioned the classification of Imperial Aramaic as an "[[official language]]", noting that no surviving edict expressly and unambiguously accorded that status to any particular language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frye|first=Richard N.|title=Review of G.

R.}} p. 457.&lt;/ref&gt; Frye reclassifies Imperial Aramaic as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the Achaemenid territories, suggesting then that the Achaemenid-era use of Aramaic was more pervasive than generally thought. Many centuries after the fall of the empire, [[Aramaic script]] and ‚Äì as [[huzvarishn|ideograms]] ‚Äì Aramaic vocabulary would survive as the essential characteristics of the [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi writing system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Wilhelm Geiger|Geiger, Wilhelm]] |author2=[[Ernst Kuhn]]|year=2002|title=Grundriss der iranischen Philologie: Band I.

Although Old Persian also appears on some seals and art objects, that language is attested primarily in the Achaemenid inscriptions of Western Iran, suggesting then that Old Persian was the common language of that region. However, by the reign of Artaxerxes II, the grammar and orthography of the inscriptions was so "far from perfect"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ware, James R. |author2=Kent, Roland G.|title=The Old Persian Cuneiform Inscriptions of Artaxerxes II and Artaxerxes III|journal=Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association|volume=55|year=1924|pages=52‚Äì61|doi=10.2307/283007|jstor=283007}} p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; that it has been suggested that the scribes who composed those texts had already largely forgotten the language, and had to rely on older inscriptions, which they to a great extent reproduced verbatim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gershevitch|first=Ilya|title=Zoroaster's own contribution|journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies|volume=23|issue=1|year=1964|pages=12‚Äì38|doi=10.1086/371754}} p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the occasion demanded, Achaemenid administrative correspondence was conducted in [[Old Greek|Greek]], making it a widely used [[bureaucratic]] language.&lt;ref name="Iranian, E. Tucker 2001"/&gt; Even though the Achaemenids had extensive contacts with the Greeks and vice versa, and had conquered many of the Greek-speaking areas both in [[Europe]] and [[Asia Minor]] during different periods of the empire, the native Old Iranian sources provide no indication of Greek linguistic evidence.&lt;ref name="Iranian, E. Tucker 2001"/&gt; However, there is plenty of evidence (in addition to the accounts of Herodotus) that Greeks, apart from being deployed and employed in the core regions of the empire, also evidently lived and worked in the heartland of the Achaemenid Empire, namely Iran.&lt;ref name="Iranian, E. Tucker 2001"/&gt; For example, Greeks were part of the various ethnicities that constructed [[Darius' palace in Susa]], apart from the Greek inscriptions found nearby there, and one short Persepolis tablet written in Greek.&lt;ref name="Iranian, E.

===Customs===

[[File:Persia - Achaemenian Vessels.jpg|thumb|An Achaemenid drinking vessel]]
[[Herodotus]] mentions that the Persians were invited to great [[birthday]] feasts (Herodotus, ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' 8), which would be followed by many desserts, a treat which they reproached the Greeks for omitting from their meals. He also observed that the Persians drank wine in large quantities and used it even for counsel, deliberating on important affairs when drunk, and deciding the next day, when sober, whether to act on the decision or set it aside. Bowing to superiors, or royalty was one of the many Persian customs adopted by [[Alexander the Great]].{{cn|date=January 2018}}

===Religion===
[[Religious toleration]] has been described as a "remarkable feature" of the Achaemenid Empire.&lt;ref name=Cambridge&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fisher|first1=William Bayne|last2=Gershevitch|first2=I.|title=The Cambridge History of Iran|date=1968|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521200912|page=412|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BBbyr932QdYC&amp;lpg=PA412|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As reported in the [[Old Testament]], king [[Cyrus the Great]] was believed to have released the Jews from [[Babylonian captivity|captivity]] in 539‚Äì530 BC, and permitted their return to their homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Book of Ezra {{pipe}} King James Bible |url=http://www.kingjamesbibletrust.org/the-king-james-bible/ezra |publisher=Kingjamesbibletrust.org |accessdate=March 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510013551/http://www.kingjamesbibletrust.org/the-king-james-bible/ezra |archivedate=10 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyrus the Great assisted in the restoration of the sacred places of various cities.&lt;ref name=Cambridge /&gt;

It was during the Achaemenid period that [[Zoroastrianism]] reached South-Western Iran, where it came to be accepted by the rulers and through them became a defining element of Persian culture. The religion was not only accompanied by a formalization of the concepts and divinities of the traditional Iranian [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] but also introduced several novel ideas, including that of [[Free will in theology|free will]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = A.

Under the patronage of the Achaemenid kings, and by the 5th century BC as the ''de facto'' religion of the state, Zoroastrianism reached all corners of the empire. The Bible states in the Old Testament that [[Cyrus the Great]] allowed the Jews to return to their [[homeland]] after decades of captivity by the [[Assyria]]n and [[Babylon]]ian empires.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

[[File:201312 iran Shiraz 72 (12475982935).jpg|thumb|Bas-relief of [[Farvahar]] at Persepolis]]
During the reign of Artaxerxes I and Darius II, Herodotus wrote "[the Persians] have no images of the gods, no temples nor altars, and consider the use of them a sign of folly. This comes, I think, from their not believing the gods to have the same nature with men, as the Greeks imagine."&lt;ref name="Herodotus, I.131"&gt;Herodotus, I.131&lt;/ref&gt; He claims the Persians offer sacrifice to: "the sun and moon, to the earth, to fire, to water, and to the winds. These are the only gods whose worship has come down to them from ancient times. At a later period they began the worship of [[Urania]], which they borrowed from the Arabians and Assyrians. [[Mylitta]] is the name by which the Assyrians know this [[goddess]], to whom the Persians referred as [[Anahita]]."&lt;ref name="Herodotus, I.131"/&gt; (The original name here is [[Mithra]], which has since been explained to be a confusion of Anahita with Mithra, understandable since they were commonly worshipped together in one temple).{{cn|date=January 2018}}

From the Babylonian scholar-priest [[Berossus|Berosus]], who‚Äîalthough writing over seventy years after the reign of [[Artaxerxes II|Artaxerxes II Mnemon]]‚Äîrecords that the emperor had been the first to make [[cult]] statues of divinities and have them placed in temples in many of the major cities of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Berosus, III.65&lt;/ref&gt; Berosus also substantiates Herodotus when he says the Persians knew of no images of gods until Artaxerxes II erected those images. On the means of sacrifice, Herodotus adds "they raise no altar, light no fire, pour no libations."&lt;ref name="Herodotus, I.132"&gt;Herodotus, I.132&lt;/ref&gt; This sentence has been interpreted to identify a critical (but later) accretion to Zoroastrianism. An altar with a wood-burning fire and the [[Yasna]] service at which libations are poured are all clearly identifiable with modern Zoroastrianism, but apparently, were practices that had not yet developed in the mid-5th century. Boyce also assigns that development to the reign of Artaxerxes II (4th century BC), as an orthodox response to the innovation of the shrine cults.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Herodotus also observed that "no prayer or offering can be made without a [[Magi|magus]] present"&lt;ref name="Herodotus, I.132"/&gt; but this should not be confused with what is today understood by the term ''magus'', that is a ''magupat'' (modern Persian: ''mobed''), a Zoroastrian priest. Nor does Herodotus' description of the term as one of the tribes or castes of the Medes necessarily imply that these ''magi'' were Medians. They simply were a hereditary priesthood to be found all over Western Iran and although (originally) not associated with any one specific religion, they were traditionally responsible for all ritual and religious services. Although the unequivocal identification of the ''magus'' with Zoroastrianism came later (Sassanid era, 3rd‚Äì7th century AD), it is from Herodotus' ''magus'' of the mid-5th century that Zoroastrianism was subject to doctrinal modifications that are today considered to be revocations of the original teachings of the prophet. Also, many of the ritual practices described in the [[Avesta]]'s ''[[Vendidad]]'' (such as [[exposure of the dead (Zoroastrianism)|exposure of the dead]]) were already practised by the ''magu'' of Herodotus' time.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

===Art and architecture===

{{Main article|Achaemenid architecture}}

[[File:Plaque with horned lion-griffins MET DT896.jpg|left|thumb|Plaque with horned lion-griffins]]

''Achaemenid architecture'' includes large cities, temples, palaces, and [[mausoleums]] such as the [[tomb of Cyrus]] the Great. The quintessential feature of Persian architecture was its eclectic nature with elements of Median, Assyrian, and Asiatic Greek all incorporated, yet maintaining a unique Persian identity seen in the finished products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Charles Henry Caffin| title = How to study architecture| url = https://books.google.com/?id=HnoWAAAAYAAJ| year = 1917| publisher = Dodd, Mead and Company| page = 80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Achaemenid art'' includes [[frieze]] reliefs, Metalwork such as the [[Oxus Treasure]], decoration of palaces, glazed brick masonry, fine craftsmanship (masonry, carpentry, etc.), and gardening. Although the Persians took artists, with their styles and techniques, from all corners of their empire, they produced not simply a combination of styles, but a synthesis of a new unique Persian style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Edward Lipi≈Ñski |author2=Karel van Lerberghe |author3=Antoon Schoors|author4=Karel Van Lerberghe|author5=Antoon Schoors| title = Immigration and emigration within the ancient Near East| url = https://books.google.com/?id=thIxCmwfNoMC| year = 1995| publisher = Peeters Publishers| isbn = 978-90-6831-727-5 |page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyrus the Great in fact had an extensive ancient Iranian heritage behind him; the rich Achaemenid gold work, which inscriptions suggest may have been a speciality of the Medes, was for instance in the tradition of the delicate metalwork found in [[Iron Age]] II times at [[Hasanlu]] and still earlier at [[Marlik]].{{cn|date=January 2018}}

One of the most remarkable examples of both Achaemenid architecture and art is the grand palace of [[Persepolis]], and its detailed workmanship, coupled with its grand scale. In describing the construction of his [[palace at Susa]], Darius the Great records that:
{{quote|Yaka timber was brought from [[Gandhara|Gandara]] and from [[Carmania (satrapy)|Carmania]]. The gold was brought from [[Sardis]] and from [[Bactria]]&amp;nbsp;... the precious stone lapis-lazuli and carnelian&amp;nbsp;... was brought from [[Sogdiana]]. The turquoise from [[Chorasmia]], the silver and ebony from [[Egypt]], the ornamentation from [[Ionia]], the ivory from [[Ethiopia]] and from [[Sindh]] and from [[Arachosia]]. The stone-cutters who wrought the stone, those were Ionians and [[Sardis|Sardians]]. The goldsmiths were [[Medes]] and [[Egyptians]]. The men who wrought the wood, those were Sardians and Egyptians. The men who wrought the baked brick, those were Babylonians. The men who adorned the wall, those were Medes and Egyptians.{{cn|date=January 2018}}}}

This was imperial art on a scale the world had not seen before. Materials and artists were drawn from all corners of the empire, and thus tastes, styles, and motifs became mixed together in an eclectic art and architecture that in itself mirrored the Persian empire.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

[[File:Artaxerses III tomb.jpg|thumb|left|Tomb of [[Artaxerxes III]] in [[Persepolis]]]]

===Tombs===
Many Achaemenid rulers built tombs for themselves. The most famous, [[Naqsh-e Rustam]], is an ancient necropolis located about 12&amp;nbsp;km north-west of [[Persepolis]], with the tombs of four of the kings of the dynasty carved in this mountain: [[Tomb of Darius I|Darius I]], [[Xerxes I]], [[Artaxerxes I]] and [[Darius II]]. Other kings constructed their own tombs elsewhere. [[Artaxerxes II]] and [[Artaxerxes III]] preferred to carve their tombs beside their spring capital [[Persepolis]], the left tomb belonging to [[Artaxerxes II]] and the right tomb belonging to [[Artaxerxes III]], the last Achaemenid king to have a tomb. The tomb of the founder of the Achaemenid dynasty, [[Cyrus the Great]], was built in [[Pasargadae]] (now a world heritage site).{{cn|date=January 2018}}

==Legacy==
The Achaemenid Empire left a lasting impression on the heritage and cultural identity of Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, and influenced the development and structure of future [[empire]]s. In fact, the Greeks, and later on the Romans, adopted the best features of the Persian method of governing an empire.&lt;ref&gt;"Mastering World History" by Philip L. Groisser, New York, 1970, p.&amp;nbsp;17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georg W. F. Hegel]] in his work ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of History|The Philosophy of History]]'' introduces the Persian Empire as the "first empire that passed away" and its people as the "first historical people" in history. According to his account;

:The Persian Empire is an empire in the modern sense ‚Äì like that which existed in Germany, and the great imperial realm under the sway of Napoleon; for we find it consisting of a number of states, which are indeed dependent, but which have retained their own individuality, their manners, and laws. The general enactments, binding upon all, did not infringe upon their political and social idiosyncrasies, but even protected and maintained them; so that each of the nations that constitute the whole, had its own form of constitution. As light illuminates everything ‚Äì imparting to each object a peculiar vitality ‚Äì so the Persian Empire extends over a multitude of nations, and leaves to each one its particular character. Some have even kings of their own; each one its distinct language, arms, way of life and customs. All this diversity coexists harmoniously under the impartial dominion of Light&amp;nbsp;... a combination of peoples ‚Äì leaving each of them free. Thereby, a stop is put to that barbarism and ferocity with which the nations had been wont to carry on their destructive feuds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of History|author=George W. F. Hegel|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GbxWvCCUdD8C&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Georg+W.+F.+Hegel%22|isbn=978-1-60206-438-6|date=2007-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American Orientalist [[Arthur Upham Pope]] (1881‚Äì1969) said: "The western world has a vast unpaid debt to the Persian Civilization!"&lt;ref&gt;"The History of the Persian Civilization" by Arthur Pope, P.&amp;nbsp;11&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Will Durant]], the American historian and philosopher, during one of his speeches, "Persia in the History of Civilization", as an address before the ''[[Iran‚ÄìAmerica Society]]'' in [[Tehran]] on 21 April 1948, stated:

:For thousands of years Persians have been creating beauty. Sixteen centuries before Christ there went from these regions or near it&amp;nbsp;... You have been here a kind of watershed of civilization, pouring your blood and thought and art and religion eastward and westward into the world&amp;nbsp;... I need not rehearse for you again the achievements of your Achaemenid period. Then for the first time in known history an empire almost as extensive as the United States received an orderly government, a competence of administration, a web of swift communications, a security of movement by men and goods on majestic roads, equalled before our time only by the zenith of Imperial Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Durant|first=Will|title=Persia in the History of Civilization|url=http://www.mazdapublisher.com/Documents/Persian%20Civilization.pdf|website=Addressing 'Iran-America Society|publisher=Mazda Publishers, Inc.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723072146/http://www.mazdapublisher.com/Documents/Persian%20Civilization.pdf|archivedate=23 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amrik Singh''' (1948 ‚Äì June 6, 1984) was the President of the [[Sikh Students Federation]] and was killed in the army operation in [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]], [[Amritsar]], on June 6, 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Khanna |first1=Hans |title=Terrorism in Punjab: Cause and Cure |date=1987 |publisher=Panchnad Research Institute |location=Chandigarh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amrik Singh was the son of Giani Kartar Singh Bhindranwale, the 13th leader of the [[Damdami Taksal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Akbar |first1=M. J. |title=India: The Siege Within : Challenges to a Nation's Unity |date=January 1, 1996 |publisher=UBSPD |isbn=9788174760760 |page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was well versed in Gurbani and Sikh literature, and devoted much of his life to Sikh progressive activities. He had passed his Masters in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] from Khalsa College in Amritsar after which he began research work on his Ph.D. thesis.

Amrik Singh was a prominent leader of the orthodox Sikh faction along with Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. He contested the 1979 [[Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee]] (SGPC) election, backed by Bhindranwale, but lost to [[Jiwan Singh Umranangal]].&lt;ref name="Tribune_passes_1998"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/1998/98nov08/head2.htm | title = Akali leader Umranangal passes away | publisher = The Tribune | location = Chandigarh | date = 1998-11-08 | accessdate = 2012-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On 26 April 1982, he led a campaign to get Amritsar the status of a "holy city". During the agitation, he was arrested on 19 July 1982 along with other members of the [[Damdami Taksal]]. Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale began the [[Dharam Yudh Morcha]] to implement the [[Anandpur Resolution]] which primarily requested more autonomy for the Punjabi's, arguing that they were being oppressed and treated unfairly by the Indian government. As part of the Morcha, he also demanded freedom for  Amrik Singh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Crenshaw |first1=Martha |title=Terrorism in Context |date=November 1, 2010 |publisher=Penn State Press |isbn=9780271044422 |page=383}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other prominent Sikhs.

J. |title=India: The Siege Within : Challenges to a Nation's Unity |date=January 1, 1996 |publisher=UBSPD |isbn=9788174760760 |page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manjit Singh was his younger brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chima |first1=Jugdep |title=The Sikh Separatist Insurgency in India: Political Leadership and Ethnonationalist Movements |date=August 1, 2008 |publisher=SAGE Publications India |location=New Delhi |isbn=9788132105381 |page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amrik Singh studied at [[Khalsa College, Amritsar|Khalsa College]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kumar |first1=Ram |title=The Sikh unrest and the Indian state: politics, personalities, and historical retrospective  |date=April 1, 1997 |publisher=Ajanta |isbn=9788120204539 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received his MA and was on his way to completing his PhD before pursuing promotion of Sikh teachings.

=== Work with AISSF===
Amrik Singh was made president of the AISSF on July 2 1978 at large AISSF meeting held at Tagore Theatre, Chandigarh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Singh |first1=Gurrattanpal |title=The Illustrated History of the Sikhs, 1947-78: Containing Chapters on PEPSU, AISSF, Evolution of the Demand for Sikh Homeland, and the Princess Bamba Collection |date=1979 |publisher= |location=Chandigargh |page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Building Gurdwara Shaheed Ganj in honor of the Sikhs massacred in 1978 ====
Amrik Singh contributed significantly to opposing the [[Nirankari]]s and to the building of the Gurdwara Shaheed Ganj, in B-Block Amritsar, at the spot where the [[1978 Sikh‚ÄìNirankari clashes|13 Sikh protesters]] were murdered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Walia |first1=Varinder |title=Thakur Singh: Under Jarnail's Shadow |publisher=The Tribune, Amritsar, |date=24 Dec 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the Nirankaris. When no other organization came forth and the government refused to sell the land to Amrik Singh and the [[AISSF]] the AISSF Sikhs began building the Gurdwara wall at night so they could claim the land by force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sarna |first1=Dr. Jasbir |title=Some Precious Pages Of The Sikh History |date=2012 |publisher=Unistar |isbn=978-93-5017-896-6 |page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikh youth would spend the entire night building the wall and it would be knocked down by the police the next day.  A stand off between the police and the AISSF began and the police threatened they would shoot anyone on site, they were met with resolve from Amrik Singh who said they would do anything to raise the memorial for the martyred Sikhs. Eventually the police acceded to the demands of the Sikhs and the Gurdwara remains there today.

==== Running for SPGC Elections ====
In the General House [[Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee]] (SGPC) elections of 1979, the first in 13 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chima |first1=Jugdep |title=The Sikh Separatist Insurgency in India: Political Leadership and Ethnonationalist Movements |date=2010 |publisher=SAGE Publications India |location=New Delhi |isbn=9789351509530}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amrik Singh ran and lost to [[Jiwan Singh Umranangal|Jiwan Umramangal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Appleb |first1=R. Scott |last2=Marty |first2=Martin E. |title=Fundamentalisms and the State: Remaking Polities, Economies, and Militance |date=1996 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=9780226508849 |page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amrik Singh was in the [[Dal Khalsa (International)|Dal Khalsa]] and Bhindranwale's group (who fielded about 40 candidates) running against the Akali Dal and ran for the SGPC Beas constituency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Akbar |first1=M. J. |title=India: The Siege Within : Challenges to a Nation's Unity |date=1996 |publisher=UBSPD |isbn=9788174760760 |page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably one of The Dal Khalsa aim included establishing a independent Sikh State. Some elements of the Congress party supported and backed Dal Khalsa's and Bhindranwale's group so they could undermine the Akalis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grewal |first1=J. S. |title=The Sikhs of the Punjab, II.2 |date=1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521637640 |page=217 |edition=Revised }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Strikes and agitations ====
The AISSF held a strike on October 25 1980 and another on November 14, 1980 to protest against the high bus fare increase and some other issues in such districts as [[Amritsar district|Amritsar]], [[Gurdaspur district|Gurdaspur]], [[Jalandhar district|Jalandhar]], [[Patiala]], [[Ludhiana district|Ludhiana]] with trains not being able to operate then. This resulted in student-police clashes at numerous places causing the police to open fire at Dasuya and Jhabhal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Singh |first1=Dalip |title=Dynamics of Punjab Politics |date=1981 |publisher=Macmillan |page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the November 14, 1980 strike against the bus fare increase organized by the AISSF there was jammed traffic in the province. The residents of the province provided full support for the Sikh students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sarna |first1=Dr. Jasbir |title=Some Precious Pages Of The Sikh History |date=2012 |publisher=Unistar |isbn=978-93-5017-896-6 |page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following these agitations all political parties joined the struggle against the increased bus fares. Some reports are there of police stations being attacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gandhi |first1=Indira |title=Selected Thoughts of Indira Gandhi: A Book of Quotes |date=1985 |publisher=Mittal Publications |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AISSF held numerous agitations, strikes, street riots against various causes and politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kiss |first1=Peter A. |title=Winning Wars amongst the People: Case Studies in Asymmetric Conflict |date=2014 |publisher=Potomac Books, Inc., |isbn=9781612347004 |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the time of the bus fare agitations the AISSF also held numerous demonstrations against various political leaders including the chief minister of Punjab, [[Darbara Singh]]. Some notable agitations including Sikh students besieging various Punjab ministers and lock themselves inside their offices or residences during early December of 1980. The students responsible were arrested and tortured and more subsequent agitations was launched for the release of these students with these agitations were so forceful that the police release the students within a couple of days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sarna |first1=Dr. Jasbir |title=Some Precious Pages Of The Sikh History |date=2012 |publisher=Unistar |isbn=978-93-5017-896-6 |page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the AISSF, which this time numbered to a membership of 300,000 members,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kiss |first1=Peter A. |title=Winning Wars amongst the People: Case Studies in Asymmetric Conflict |date=2014 |publisher=Potomac Books, Inc., |isbn=9781612347004 |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; at one point compelled the non-government political parties to join in and hold a demonstration in front of the state secretariat at Chandigarh from making a speech, on January 1981.
Thousands of AISSF volunteers joined the demonstration with more than a thousand being arrested and eventually police throwing tear-gas and also lathi and cane-charged them however the AISSF were successful in delaying the Punjab governor from making a speech making the government invite all the political parties for a dialogue.

==== Anti Tobacco march ====
This issue of banning tobacco in and other improvements to Amritsar also put leeway to get the Sikh issues to mainstream politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chima |first1=Jugdep |title=The Sikh Separatist Insurgency in India: Political Leadership and Ethnonationalist Movements |date=August 1, 2008 |publisher=SAGE Publications India |location=New Delhi |isbn=9788132105381}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May of 1981 The AISSF alongside Dal Khalsa put forth to pass the bill of banning tobacco in the city of Amritsar, tobacco is strictly forbidden in Sikhism, this bill was originally introduced in 1977 by the Akali Dal for the 400 years founding of Amritsar celebrations.  The AISSF gave an ultimatum to the Punjab government to ban tobacco in the city by March 30th or there would be an agitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kumar |first1=Raj |title=Punjab crisis: Role of Rightist and Leftist Parties |publisher=Dev Publications |isbn=9788187577058 |page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Government of Punjab seemed to agree with the issue but they said that technically passing such a ban would be unconstitutional and therefore could not.

On May 29 1981 thousands of Hindus marched in Amritsar to protest against the AISSF ban for tobacco demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jeffrey |first1=Robin |title=What‚Äôs Happening to India?: Punjab, Ethnic Conflict, and the Test for Federalism|page=144 |edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; They carried sticks with lit cigarettes through the Amritsar bazaar, beating up Sikhs along the way and yelling provocative slogans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kaur |first1=Harminder |title=Blue Star Over Amritsar |date=1990 |publisher=Ajanta Publications |isbn=9788120202573 |page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Bhindranwale's march =====
In response to the pro tobacco march, on May 31th 1981, the AISSF, [[Damdami Taksal]], Dal Khalsa joined together led by ''[[Sant (religion)|Sant]]'' Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and with over 20,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jeffrey |first1=Robin |title=What‚Äôs Happening to India?: Punjab, Ethnic Conflict, and the Test for Federalism|page=144 |edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; supporters put out a procession.  No major Akali leader participated in the march. The march went a route of about two and a half kilometres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Viswanathan, |first1=S. |title=Industrial Economist |date=1981 |volume=14 |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the march there were eruptions of Hindu-Sikh clashes in Amritsar with the government then initating new laws banning non-religious processions from taking place. These events died down once the government agreed to form a committee to discuss 'holy-city' status for Amritsar.

===== Outcome =====
Holy-city status was not given to Amritsar however on February 27 1983 the Prime Minister passed a law making meat, alcohol and tobacco sale prohibited in the areas around the Harimander Sahib and the Hindu [[Durgiana Temple|Durgiana temple]] in Amritsar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kamath |first1=M.V. |last2=Gupta |first2=Shekhar |last3=Kirpekar, |first3=Subhash |last4=Sethi, |first4=Sunil |last5=Singh |first5=Tavleen |last6=Singh, |first6=Khushwant |last7=Aurora |first7=Jagjit |last8=Kaur |first8=Amarjit |title=The Punjab Story |date=2012 |publisher=Roli Books Private Limited |isbn=9788174369123}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 10 2016 [[Aam Aadmi Party]] leader [[Arvind Kejriwal]] promised 'holy-city' status to Amritsar as well as [[Anandpur Sahib]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rana |first1=Yudhvir |title=Arvind Kejriwal for holy city status to Amritsar, Anandpur Sahib |agency=TNN |publisher=Times Of India |date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; on his visit to the city. He declared liquor, tobacco, cigarette and meat will be completely banned in these cities, it is notable the sales of such items are currently rampant in the city.

=== Arrest ===

On July 19, 1982 Amrik Singh was arrested for vehemently pleading the case of the arrested workers causing offense and attention to [[Marri Chenna Reddy|Chenna Reddy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grewal |first1=J.

Sant Jarnail Singh started a ''morcha'' (agitation) on July 19, 1982 for the immediate release of Bhai Amrik Singh and had popular support throughout Punjab, including support from [[Akali Dal]], [[Darbara Singh]], and the farmers of [[Majha]]'s country side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chima |first1=Jugdep |title=The Sikh Separatist Insurgency in India: Political Leadership and Ethnonationalist Movements |date=August 1, 2008 |publisher=SAGE Publications India |location=New Delhi |isbn=9788132105381 |page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harcharan Singh Longowal|Harcharan Longowal]], leader of the Akali Dal than announced that his ''morcha'' would also be for the release of Amrik Singh and the 45 original demands presented to [[Indira Gandhi]]. Upon news of Akali Dal's new ''morcha'' for the release of Bhai Amrik Singh Jarnail Singh agreed to discontinue his agitation and join the Akali Dal's planned [[Khalistan_movement#Dharam_Yudh_Morcha|Dharm Yudh Morcha]] which began in August 4, 1982.

Amrik Singh was released in the summer of 1983 and subsequently honoured at the Akal Takht with flowered garland ''saropas'' (robes of honour).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rastogi |first1=P.

The '''''Amritabindu Upanishad''''' ([[Sanskrit]]:‡§Ö‡§Æ‡•É‡§§‡§¨‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•Å ‡§â‡§™‡§®‡§ø‡§∑‡§¶‡•ç) is one of the minor [[Upanishads]] of [[Hinduism]].{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|pp=557, 713}} It is one of the five ''Bindu Upanishads'', attached to the [[Atharvaveda]],{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|p=567}} and one of twenty [[Yoga Upanishads]] in the four [[Vedas]].{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|p=vii}}&lt;ref&gt;GM Patil (1978), Ishvara in Yoga philosophy, The Brahmavadin, Volume 13, Vivekananda Prakashan Kendra, pages 209‚Äì210&lt;/ref&gt;

The text is notable for condemning "bookish learning" and emphasizing practice, as well as for presenting a six limbed [[Yoga]] system which match five stages of the eight stage Patanjali's [[Yogasutra]]s and offering a unique, different sixth stage.{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|p=691}}

The Am·πõitabindu is listed at number 20 in the serial order of the [[Muktika]] enumerated by [[Rama]] to [[Hanuman]] in the modern era [[anthology]] of 108 Upanishads.{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|p=556}} The text sometimes appears under the title ''Brahmabindu Upanishad'' or ''Amritanada Upanishad'', in some anthologies.{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|p=691}}&lt;ref name=davidwhiteyip109/&gt; It shares over 20 [[Vedanta]]-philosophy related verses with Amritanada Upanishad in compilations where these two texts are separated into independent Upanishads.&lt;ref name=davidwhiteyip109/&gt;

==Nomenclature==
[[Paul Deussen]] states that the title has two meanings, first being "the esoteric doctrine of a bindu (point) or nada (reverberation) of the word [[Om]] which signifies [[Brahman]]", while the second meaning is a drop which grants immortality.{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|p=691}}  The discussion of Om by the text, states Deussen, suggests that the former meaning may be more appropriate.{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|p=691}}  It is one of five Upanishads whose title has the suffix "bindu" meaning "drop", while ‚Äúamrita‚Äù represents nectar of immortality like [[ambrosia]] in Greek literature parlance, but here its real emphasis is on mind.{{Sfn|Easwaran|2010|p=225}} Amritabindu Upanishad, also meaning "Immortal Point," differentiates between vocal recitation of the Om syllable and its non-vocal practice.{{Sfn|Feuerstein|1989|p=233}}

The different names of similar texts may be the result of a scribal error that persisted as the text spread across India.{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|p=691}} However, the number of verses vary between the manuscripts, ranging from twenty two verses in Ayyangar translation,{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|pp=17‚Äì22}} and 38 in Deussen translation.{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|pp=691‚Äì698}}

The text, states Deussen, has also been referred to as ''Amritanada Upanishad'' by medieval Indian scholars such as [[Sayana]] of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]].{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|p=691}} David Gordon White states that Bindu and Nada Upanishads were related, deriving their nomenclature from the symbol Om and its relation to meditation on the [[Brahman]] metaphysical reality, the Nada texts "all show some similarities to the bindu texts", and may have origins in the Tantric traditions.&lt;ref&gt;David Gordon White (2011), Yoga in Practice, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691140865}}, pages 107‚Äì110, 240&lt;/ref&gt; The text of Amritabindu Upanishad, states White, appears under the title of Brahmabindu Upanishad in some older anthology.&lt;ref name=davidwhiteyip109&gt;David Gordon White (2011), Yoga in Practice, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691140865}}, pages 109‚Äì110&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronology and anthology==
Mircea Eliade suggests that Amritabindu Upanishad was possibly composed in the same period as the didactic parts of the [[Mahabharata]], the chief [[Sannyasa]] Upanishads and along with other early Yoga Upanishads: Brahmabindu (probably composed about the same time as [[Maitri Upanishad]]), Ksurika, [[Tejobindu Upanishad|Tejobindu]], [[Brahmavidya Upanishad|Brahmavidya]], [[Nada Bindu Upanishad|Nadabindu]], Yogashikha, Dhyanabindu and [[Yogatattva Upanishad]].&lt;ref name=eliadeyif128/&gt; Eliade's suggestion places these in the final centuries of BCE or early centuries of the CE. All these, adds Eliade, were likely composed earlier than the ten or eleven later Yoga Upanishads such as the [[Yoga-kundali Upanishad|Yoga-kundali]], [[Varaha Upanishad|Varaha]] and Pashupatabrahma Upanishads.&lt;ref name=eliadeyif128&gt;Mircea Eliade (1970), Yoga: Immortality and Freedom, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|0-691017646}}, pages 128‚Äì129&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Deussen states that this text may have preceded Patanjali's [[Yogasutras]] text, because it lists six instead of eight limbs for yoga, and both [[Maitri Upanishad]] in section 6.18 and Amritabindu place ''Dharana'' after ''Dhyana'', a sequence that is reverse of what is found in the Yogasutras and all later Yoga texts of Hinduism.{{Sfn|Deussen|2010|p=388}} Both Maitri and Amritabindu, adds Deussen, include the concept of ''[[Tarka sastra|Tarka]]'' in their verses, which may be important to their relative dating.{{Sfn|Deussen|2010|p=388}}

[[Gavin Flood]] dates the Amritabindu text, along with other Yoga Upanishads, to be probably from the 100 BCE to 300 CE period.{{Sfn|Flood|1996|p=96}}

This Upanishad is among those which have been differently attached to two [[Vedas]], depending on the region where the manuscript was found. Deussen states it and all Bindu Upanishads are attached to the Atharvaveda,{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|p=567}} while Ayyangar states it attached to the [[Krishna Yajurveda]].{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|p=17}}&lt;ref&gt;Alain Danielou (1991), Yoga: Mastering the Secrets of Matter and the Universe, Inner Traditions, {{ISBN|978-0892813018}}, page 168&lt;/ref&gt;

In Colebrooke's version of 52 Upanishads popular in north India, the text is listed at number 19 along with the other four Bindu Upanishads with similar theme.{{Sfn|Deussen|Bedekar|Palsule|1997|p=561}} The Narayana anthology also includes this Upanishad at number 11 in ''Bibliothica Indica''.{{Sfn|Deussen|Bedekar|Palsule|1997|p=562}} In the collection of Upanishads under the title "Oupanekhat", put together by Sultan Mohammed [[Dara Shikhoh]] in 1656, consisting of a [[Persian language|Persian]] translation of 50 Upanishads and who prefaced it as the best book on religion, it is listed at number 26 and is named ''Ambart bandeh''(also known as Amrtabindu or Brahmabindu).{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|pp=558‚Äì59}}

==Structure==
The text opens with an introduction consisting of four verses, followed by four sections of which three discuss the practice, rules and rewards of yoga, followed by a discourse on life-force (''Prana'', breath). The text ends with a one verse summary.{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|pp=691‚Äì698}}

Like almost all other Yoga Upanishads, the text is composed in verse form.{{Sfn|Deussen|2010|p=26}}

The Amritabindu Upanishad is part of a group of five Bindu Upanishads, all dedicated to Yoga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Upanishads and Its Philosophy|author=Subodh Kapoor|publisher=Genesis Publishing|page=423|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-q1vHSrs0BAC&amp;pg=PA423&amp;dq=Amritabindu+Upanishad&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wFUYU_XTFYjxrQeLn4HACw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAjge#v=onepage&amp;q=Amritabindu%20Upanishad&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; All five of Bindu Upanishads emphasize the practice of Yoga and [[Dhyana in Hinduism|Dhyana]] (meditation) with Om, to apprehend [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (soul, self).{{Sfn|Deussen|2010|p=9}}

===Introduction===
{{Quote box |width=25em | bgcolor=#FFE0BB |align=right |salign = right 
|quote='''Role of Mind'''
&lt;poem&gt;
It is indeed the mind that is the cause of men's bondage and liberation. &lt;br&gt;The mind that is attached to sense-objects leads to bondage, while dissociated from sense objects it tends to lead to liberation.&lt;br&gt;So they think.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;
|source =‚Äî ''Amritabindu Upanishad'' {{Sfn|Atmashraddhananda|2015|p=142}}
}}
The text opens stating that it is the wise, who after reading the text books repeatedly, throw away the books and proceed to the practice of yoga with meditation on the silent, invisible Om, in their pursuit of the [[Brahman]]-knowledge (ultimate unchanging reality).{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|pp=691‚Äì692}}&lt;ref name=zimmerpoi370/&gt; This lack of interest and esteem in learning or study of the [[Vedas]] is found in other Bindu Upanishads, states Deussen, and may reflect ancient trend among Yogins.{{Sfn|Deussen|2010|p=390}}
In the initial verses the Upanishad differentiates the mind under pure and impure states, and assigns its character as "bondage and liberation". Further enquiry into the crux of the matter reveals that Truth is realized within Vasudev, which is one's Self.{{Sfn|Tejomayananda|2015|p=79}}

===The practice of yoga===
The Amritabindu Upanishad states that there are six limbs of yoga, whose sequence and one limb is different from Patanjali's [[Yogasutra]]s:{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|p=691}}{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|pp=10‚Äì12}}
#[[Pratyahara]]: the withdrawal of mind and sensory organs from external objects, and redirecting them to introspection. (Verses 5‚Äì6){{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|pp=692‚Äì693}}
#[[Dhyana in Hinduism|Dhyanam]]: meditation. (Verses 5‚Äì6){{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|pp=692‚Äì693}}
#[[Pranayama]]: breathing exercises consisting of ''Rechaka'' (exhaling completely), ''Paraka'' (inhaling deeply) and ''Kumbhaka'' (retaining breath for various intervals). (Verses 7‚Äì14){{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|pp=693‚Äì694}}
#[[Dharana]]: concentrated introspection on Atman (soul, self) with one's mind. (Verse 15){{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|p=694}}
#''Tarka'': reflecting and inner reasoning between one's mind and soul.{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|p=691}}{{Sfn|Larson|Potter|1970|pp=592‚Äì593}} This is missing in the Yogasutras. (Verse 16){{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|pp=691, 694}}
#[[Samadhi]]: communion with and in one's soul. (Verse 16){{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|p=694}}

The verse 10 of the Upanishad recommends internally reciting Gayatri, Vyahrtis and Pranava (Om) mantras as counters to time the length of the breathing exercises, while the section reminds the yogi to drink water and breath deeply to cleanse the body and senses.{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|pp=693‚Äì694}}

===The rules of yoga===
{{Quote box |width=25em | bgcolor=#FFE0BB |align=right |salign = right 
|quote='''Some rules of yoga'''
&lt;poem&gt;
Against fear, against anger, against sloth,
Against too much waking, against too much sleeping,
Against too much eating, against starvation,
A [[Yogi]]n shall always be on his guard.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|source =‚Äî ''Amritabindu Upanishad'' Verse 27{{Sfn|Deussen|Bedekar|Palsule|1997|p=696}}{{Sfn|Deussen|2010|p=387}}}}
The verse 17 of the text begins the rules and recommendation for yoga practice. It begins by stating that one must pick a proper place for yoga, which translates Deussen, is "a level surface of ground, pleasant and free from faults".{{Sfn|Deussen|2010|p=387}} Place a mat, settle in, and enter an [[Asana]], states the Upanishad, such as Padmasana, Svastikasana or even Bhadrasana.{{Sfn|Deussen|Bedekar|Palsule|1997|p=695}}{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|p=13}} The yogi should face north, perform breathing exercises, alternating with the two nostrils, then in the state of comfort and being pacific, say Om and begin meditating.{{Sfn|Deussen|Bedekar|Palsule|1997|p=695}}

Close and cast your eyes within, asserts the text in verse 22, sit motionless, practice yoga.{{Sfn|Deussen|Bedekar|Palsule|1997|p=695}} Reach rhythmic breathing, concentrate, chain in the mind, reflect and reason, and proceed towards the union in the soul. It is unclear, states Deussen, whether the text implies union of individual soul with highest soul (Anquetil's interpretation), or Prana and Apana (Narayana's interpretation), or is a choice left to the yogi.{{Sfn|Deussen|Bedekar|Palsule|1997|pp=696 with footnote 3}}

The yogi should be silent, still, lost from the outer world, reflecting or remembering the sacred syllable (Om) internally.{{Sfn|Deussen|Bedekar|Palsule|1997|p=696}}{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|pp=13‚Äì14}} In verse 27, the Upanishad lists the [[Yamas]] (ethics of yogi with others) and [[Niyama]]s (ethics of yogi with one's own body).{{Sfn|Deussen|Bedekar|Palsule|1997|p=696}}{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|p=14}}

===The rewards of yoga===
Three months of dedicated yoga practice, asserts verse 28 of the text, begins to bring rewards to body.{{Sfn|Deussen|Bedekar|Palsule|1997|p=696}} In four months the yogi sees the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] within, strength marks the yogi in five months, and after six months from starting yoga there is an "absoluteness of will" and sense of blissful aloneness, independence (Kaivalya) in the yogi states verse 29.{{Sfn|Deussen|Bedekar|Palsule|1997|p=697}}{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|p=15}} The verses 30‚Äì31 describe how meditation and concentration on different moras of the Om syllable, the yogi thinks through soul and in soul alone.{{Sfn|Deussen|Bedekar|Palsule|1997|p=697; Sanskrit: ‡§è‡§ï‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§•‡§æ‡§ï‡§æ‡§∂‡•ã ‡§π‡•ç‡§Ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§ß‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§Ç ‡§§‡•Å ‡§ö‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§Ø‡•á‡§§‡•ç ‡§∏‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß‡§ø‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•É‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ ‡§§‡•Å ‡§Æ‡§®‡§∏‡§æ ‡§ö‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§Ø‡•á‡§¶‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ‡§®‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ‡§®‡§ø}}

===Theory of Prana===
In some versions of the manuscript found in India, this section is much larger or called as Amritabindu Upanishad while the yoga part is titled separately as Amritanada Upanishad. Many medieval Indian scholars considered these as one.{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|p=691}} Ayyangar has translated this as a separate Upanishad.{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|pp=17‚Äì21}} The two Upanishads when separate, states White, share over 20 similar verses.&lt;ref name=davidwhiteyip109/&gt; This section, adds White, represent exclusively classical [[Vedanta]] philosophy methods and goals.&lt;ref name=davidwhiteyip109/&gt;

To quote [[Swami Madhavananda]] ‚Äì "the ''Amritabindu Upanishad'' inculcates, first, the control of the mind in the shape of desire-less-ness for sense-objects, as the most effective way to the attainment of [[Moksha|liberation]] and the realisation of the [[Absolute (philosophy)|One who is Knowledge and Bliss Absolute]]. Then, it discusses the real nature of the [[Atman (Hinduism)|soul]] and the realisation of the highest truth which leads to unity. Thus, the central theme of all the [[Upanishads]] ‚Äì viz., "that the [[Jiva]] and [[Brahman]] are eternally one, and that all [[Dvaita|duality]] is a mere [[Adhyasa|superimposition]] due to [[Avidya (Hinduism)|ignorance]]" is described in this text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Minor Upanishads|author=Swami Madhavananda|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|page=17|url= http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/minor-upanishads-madhavananda/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the above verse, ''Amritabindu Upanishad'' states that the mind is the cause of bondage and liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Energy: The Spark of Life and Universal Goddess|author=Swami Muktibodhananda|publisher=Trafford Publishing|page=91|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XNwq87ENVwsC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mind that craves for something else is in bondage, one that doesn't is liberated.{{Sfn|Ayyangar|1938|p=17}} Spirituality is geared to obtain inner purity, calmness of the mind, and ultimately, liberation.

This section of Amritabindu text presents the Vedanta theory of non-dualism (Advaita).&lt;ref name=zimmerpoi370&gt;H Zimmer (1969), Philosophies of India, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0691017587}}, page 370 with footnote 43; Quote: "Amritabindu Upanishad 17‚Äì18: Vijnana (the plenitude of knowledge): the vi here refers to infinity, which is all comprehensive and leaves no margin wherein any not included, second entity might exist. Vijnana is therefore nondual (advaita) knowledge (jnana), and as such synonymous with the state known to Vedanta as Turiya, the Fourth."&lt;/ref&gt; It states that "there is only one Self in all creatures, that one appears many just as the moon appears many when reflected in many droplets", and the toughest connection yet most liberating connection one can make is with one's own Self (soul), which is difficult because it is concealed by [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]].&lt;ref name=easwarantu/&gt; When one successfully removes this veil, look within, one realizes the Self and its unity with the eternal, indestructible, unchanging truth that is one with the universe.&lt;ref name=easwarantu&gt;Eknath Easwaran (1987), The Upanishads, Nilgiri Press, {{ISBN|978-1586380212}}, pages 179‚Äì180, [http://www.easwaran.org/the-amritabindu-upanishad-the-hidden-self.html Amritabindu Translation Archive] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118144757/http://www.easwaran.org/the-amritabindu-upanishad-the-hidden-self.html |date=2016-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Easwaran|2010|p=225, Quote (in one version): "I am That one which is the abode of all beings and also who lives in all beings by being gracious to all.

===Conclusion===
The text concludes with a single verse, asserting that one who has realized this knowledge is never reborn again, no matter where he dies.{{Sfn|Deussen|Bedekar|Palsule|1997|p=698}}

[[Image:Wijwaterkwast.jpg|thumb|A Western-style aspergillum]]
[[Image:Vase √† eau b√©nite.jpg|thumb|Aspergillum in a silver aspersorium]]

An '''aspergillum'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aspergillum Aspergillum], ''[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]''. Retrieved on October 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; (less commonly, '''aspergilium''' or '''aspergil''') is a [[liturgy|liturgical]] implement used to sprinkle [[holy water]]. It comes in two common forms: a brush that is dipped in the water and shaken, and a silver ball on a stick.  Some have sponges or internal reservoirs that dispense holy water when shaken, while others must periodically be dipped in an '''aspersorium''' (holy water bucket, known to art historians as a [[situla (vessel)|situla]]).

==Uses==
An aspergillum is used in [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] ceremonies, including the Rite of [[Baptism]] and during the [[Eastertide|Easter Season]]. In addition, a priest will use the aspergillum to bless the candles during [[candlemas]] services and the palms during [[Palm Sunday]] Mass. At a [[requiem]], if a coffin is present, the priest will sprinkle holy water on the coffin. The aspergillum can be used in other manners where sprinkling of holy water is appropriate, as in a house blessing, in which the priest might bless the entry to the home. The name derives from the [[Latin]] verb ''aspergere'' 'to sprinkle'.

The form of the aspergillum differs in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. In the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] the aspergillum (''randistirion'') is in the form of a standing vessel with a tapering lid. The top of the lid has holes in it from which the [[Holy water in Eastern Christianity|''agiasmos'']] (holy water) is sprinkled. In the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] the aspergillum is in the form of a [[Fly-whisk|whisk]] made of cloth or hair. Sometimes, sprigs of [[basil]] are used to sprinkle holy water. In some of the [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]], no aspergillum is used, but the priest will pour holy water into the palm of his right hand and throw it on the faithful.

An aspergillum is also used in other religions, including Balinese [[Shaivism]] ([[Hinduism]]).

==Origin==
The origin is found in the [[Book of Leviticus]] Chapter 14 in the [[Old Testament]]‚Äì
[[Image:Aspergillum by Julia O'Gara.jpg|thumb|Aspergillum as described in Leviticus]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;3. ‚ÄòAnd the priest goes out of the camp and the priest looks, and beholds that the sore of the leprosy of the leper is healed.‚Äô 4. ‚ÄòAnd the priest commands, and takes, for the one healed, two unblemished live birds, cedar wood, Coccus scarlet, and hyssop.‚Äô 5. ‚ÄòAnd the priest commands, and slaughters the one bird in a pottery vessel upon living water.‚Äô 6. ‚ÄòHe takes the live bird and the cedar wood and the Coccus scarlet and the hyssop and dips them and the live bird in the blood of the bird slaughtered upon the living water.‚Äô 7. ‚ÄòAnd sprinkle seven times upon him purified of leprosy, and he is purified, and sends the live bird upon the face of the field.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Adam Clarke's commentary: Of the cedar wood, hyssop, clean bird, and scarlet wool or fillet, were made an aspergillum, or instrument to sprinkle with.  The cedarwood served for the handle, the hyssop and living bird were attached to it, by means of the scarlet wool or crimson fillet.  The bird was so bound to this handle, as that its tail should be downwards, in order to be dipped in the blood of the bird that had been killed.  The whole of this made an instrument for the sprinkling of this blood, and when this business was done, the living bird was let loose, and permitted to go whithersoever it would. (Adam Clarke, 1831, vol. I p. 52)

Clarke again, of Verse 5. Over running water ‚Äì Literally "living", that is, spring water. The meaning appears to be this; some water (about a quarter of a log, an egg shell and half full, according to the rabbis) was taken from a spring, and put in a clean earthen vessel, and they killed the bird over this water, that the blood might drop into it‚Ä¶ (A. C. I p. 529)

Further, these ceremonies conducted by the priest did not cure skin disease. According to [[The Gospel of Luke|Luke]], the diseased person came to the priest ''after'' he had been healed (Luke 5:14). The task of the priest was to make the person who had been excluded from the camp, from his people, and from God, ceremonially clean. Through these ceremonial cleansings, which took place in two stages, a week apart, the diseased individual was restored to fellowship with God and with His people.&lt;ref name="reform"&gt;[[Reformation Study Bible]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The procedure was a first stage of cleansing which took place outside the camp. The man washed himself and his clothes, and shaved. Two birds were taken. The blood of one was used to purify the man. The death of that bird portrayed the end of the man‚Äôs old life outside the camp, and the flight to freedom of the other pictured his liberation from the effects of the disease. Then the man might enter the camp again."&lt;ref name="reform" /&gt;

==Other uses==
Aspergilla are also used in [[modern paganism]], particularly to cleanse [[Magic circle|a ritual area]] in [[Wicca]], as part of a [[Magic (paranormal)#Varieties of magical practice|spell]], or during a [[Wheel of the Year]] festival in [[Witchcraft (contemporary)|contemporary Witchcraft]]. Lunarized water, saltwater, or rainwater are most typically used.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

''[[Aspergillus]]'', a [[genus]] of [[mold]], was named in 1729 by the Italian priest and biologist Pietro Antonio Micheli. When viewed under a microscope, the mold cells were said to resemble an aspergillum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bennett|first1=Joan W.|editor1-last=Machida|editor1-first=Masayuki|editor2-last=Gomi|editor2-first=Katsuya|title=Aspergillus : molecular biology and genomics|date=2010|publisher=Caister Academic|location=Wymondham, Norfolk, UK|isbn=978-1-904455-53-0|url=http://www.open-access-biology.com/aspergillus/aspergillusch1.pdf|chapter=An Overview of the Genus Aspergillus|access-date=2016-05-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617021430/http://www.open-access-biology.com/aspergillus/aspergillusch1.pdf|archive-date=2016-06-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Blasphemous Rumours'''"/"'''Somebody'''" is [[Depeche Mode]]'s twelfth UK single and first double A-side single, released on 29 October 1984.

Both A-side songs are from the album ''[[Some Great Reward]]''. "Somebody" is the first single with [[Martin Gore]] as lead vocals, one of only three (The other ones being "[[A Question of Lust]]" and "[[Home (Depeche Mode song)|Home]]".)

The music videos for both songs were directed by Clive Richardson.

==Song information==
The verses to "Blasphemous Rumours" describe a 16-year-old girl who attempts suicide but fails. She experiences a religious revival but is killed in a car accident at age 18. The chorus uses these incidents to conclude, "I don't want to start any blasphemous rumours / but I think that God's got a sick sense of humour / and when I die, I expect to find him laughing." Like other songs on ''Some Great Reward'', the song uses a dense sound with extensive sampled percussion.

When Depeche Mode announced that they were planning to release "Blasphemous Rumours" as a single, pushback from the religious community{{clarify|date=January 2017}} resulted, and consequently, the band decided as a compromise to release the single as a double-A side with "Somebody."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=Dave|title=Depeche Mode: Some Great Reward|pages=152‚Äì155|publisher=St. Martin's Press |date=15 November 1994|URL=https://books.google.com/?id=411Rjurti_QC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Somebody", which was sung by Martin Gore in the studio in the nude, includes one of Gore's "little twists," where the song builds as if it's a song about finding your perfect love, only to have him reveal at the end "though things like this make me sick / in a case like this I'll get away with it."&lt;ref name=D93&gt;{{citation | last=Shaw | first=William | title=In The Mode | journal=[[Details (magazine)|Details magazine]] |date=April 1993 | pages=90‚Äì95, 168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Body of Resurrection''' is a typical term of [[Esoteric Christianity]], used to indicate a spiritual body associated with a special enlightenment or experience.

==The Doctrine of the Spiritual Body==
Many western and Eastern traditions share a common doctrine on a spiritual and immortal body which represent the ultimate goal of many ascetical works.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Corbin]], ''Spiritual Body &amp; Celestial Earth: From Mazdean Iran to Shi'ite Iran. Princeton University Press'', 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;
This concept of a spiritual and immortal body which has to be formed has many names according to several traditions. 
Sometimes the idea of such an immortal body has been called ''the resurrection body'' and ''the glorified body'' in Christianity, 
''the most sacred body'' (wujud al-aqdas) and ''supracelestial body'' (jism asli haqiqi) in Sufism, 
''the diamond body'' in Taoism and Vajrayana, ''the light body'' or ''rainbow body'' in Tibetan Buddhism, 
''the body of bliss'' in Kriya Yoga, and ''the immortal body'' (soma athanaton) in Hermeticism.
It has to be specified that each of these names belongs to a different tradition, and every tradition has its own doctrine that differs from the others, so these terms cannot be entirely identified with one another; nevertheless, all of these currents share a common teaching which is the idea of the formation, under special ascetical or supernatural conditions, of an immortal and spiritual body.

==Properties of the Body of Resurrection==
Focusing on the resurrection body, which means a spiritual body in an [[Esoteric Christianity|Esoteric Christian]] framework, we can find some properties of these bodies which are shared by all the esoteric Christian movements. Indeed according to Biblical Scriptures, the resurrected bodies possess several properties:&lt;ref&gt;Tommaso Palamidessi, [http://www.archeosofica.org/en/index.php/Estratti-dai-Quaderni-di-Archeosofia/Propierties-and-Endowments-of-Resurrected-Bodies.html Propierties and Endowments of Resurrected Bodies]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''immortality'''&lt;ref&gt;I Corinthians, 15:53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luke, 20:35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Revelation, 21:4&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''entirety''', implying the restitution of the limbs, the distinction of the sexes and the perfection of the senses;

The resurrection bodies, according to almost all the esoteric Christian currents, will be taken for sure at the end of the time when there will be the resurrection of all the bodies of the dead, good and bad, to be judged by Jesus Christ and receive eternal reward or eternal punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew, 22:23-32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luke, 20:27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Acts, 4:1-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Acts, 3:8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tommaso Palamidessi]], [http://www.archeosofica.org/en/index.php/Estratti-dai-Quaderni-di-Archeosofia/The-Resurrection-According-to-Esoteric-Christianity.html Resurrection according to Esoteric Christianity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929094744/http://www.archeosofica.org/en/index.php/Estratti-dai-Quaderni-di-Archeosofia/The-Resurrection-According-to-Esoteric-Christianity.html |date=2007-09-29 }}, ed Archeosofica, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, most esoteric Christian traditions believe that the resurrection body or glorified body can be achieved during this lifetime with special ascetic exercises (which can vary between distinct esoteric movements) or as a supernatural gift.

==Guardian of the Threshold and the Resurrection Body==
In some modern [[Esoteric Christianity|esoteric Christian]] and [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophical]] oriented doctrines the resurrection body is related to the [[Guardian of the Threshold]].&lt;ref&gt;Franz Hartmann, ''The Dweller of the Threshold'', Reprinted from The Theosophist, Vol. XI 1889&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, ''Building Stones for an Understanding of the Mystery of Golgotha: Lectures'',Rudolph Steiner Pr, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Max Heindel, ''Gleaning of a Mystic'',Rosicrucian Fellowship, 1919&lt;/ref&gt; Although several authors spoke about both of these elements and sometimes they even relate them together (cfr. [[Rudolf Steiner]], [[Max Heindel]], etc...) the most developed theory explaining the relation between these two entities in a theosophical framework is probably due to [[Tommaso Palamidessi]]. In his, ''The Guardian of the Threshold and the evolutionary way'', Palamidessi identifies the spectral entity called the ''lesser [[Guardian of the Threshold]]'' with the ''archetype of the future resurrection body''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tommaso Palamidessi]], ''The Guardian of the Threshold and the evolutionary way'', ed Archeosofica, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; In this line of thought the ''lesser Guardian of the Threshold'' has to be purified, constructed and molded to become the resurrection body of the individual.

'''Charles Hartwell''' ({{zh|c=Â§èÂØüÁêÜ}}; [[Pinyin]]: ''Xi√† Ch√°l«ê''; [[Foochow Romanized]]: ''H√¢ Ch√°k-lƒ´''; December 19, 1825 - January 30, 1905) was an [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions|American Board]] missionary to [[Foochow]], [[China]] in the second half of the 19th century.

== Life and work ==
[[File:Hartwell with Chinese preachers and booksellers.jpg|thumb|250px|Rev. Charles Hartwell with Chinese preachers and booksellers, 1900|left]]
Hartwell was born in [[Lincoln, Massachusetts]] on December 19, 1825, and was fitted for college at [[Westford Academy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wa.westford.mec.edu/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060109014617/http://wa.westford.mec.edu/ |archivedate=2006-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2017}} in [[Westford, Massachusetts]]. After teaching several months at [[Killingly, Connecticut|West Killingly]], Hartwell studied [[theology]] at [[Amherst College]] in 1849, and received the degree of [[Master of Arts]] from the same institution three years later. He was ordained at [[Lincoln, Massachusetts]] on October 13, 1852, entered the service of the [[ABCFM]], embarked for [[China]] on November 3, and reached [[Hong Kong]] on April 16, 1853. Hartwell was located at [[Foochow]] (today [[Fuzhou]]) on June 9, 1853, and was engaged in missionary work there for the rest of his life, with only three visits to the [[United States]]: 1865 - 1867, 1877 - 1878, and 1890 - 1891, in all, four years.

Hartwell ranked high as a [[Sinologist]]. He spoke the [[Foochow dialect]] with fluency, and was one of the proposers of the [[Foochow Romanized|romanization]] of that dialect. In addition to preaching the [[Gospel]], he translated one fourth of the [[New Testament]] into the Foochow colloquial, composed the [[Three Character Classic|Three Character]] and the [[Four Character Classics]] in the same dialect, and various tracts and books (including the 2nd edition of the ''[[:s:Dictionary of the Foochow Dialect|Dictionary of the Foochow Dialect]]''). He also prepared many textbooks for schools (including one series of the so-called ''Hongkong Readers''), wrote a book on [[Meteorology]], and contributed articles on temperance to English and American journals.

[[File:Hartwell with Foochow College faculty.jpg|thumb|250px|Charles Hartwell with Foochow College faculty, 1903|left]]
The fiftieth anniversary of Hartwell's arrival at [[Foochow]] was celebrated on May 26, 1903, a full account of which was issued from the Foochow Mission Press in February, 1904, in a volume entitled ''Jubilee Notes''.

Hartwell was married twice during his life. On September 6, 1852 he married his first wife Lucy E. Stearns, who died July 10, 1883 in Foochow. In 1885 he married his second wife Hannah Louisa Plimpton Peet Hartwell. Hartwell died of [[heart failure]] in [[Foochow]] on January 30, 1905. At the time of his death he was the senior missionary of the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions#ABCFM in China|American Board in China]]. His wife died 3 years afterwards. His daughter, [[Emily Susan Hartwell]], remained in the field until 1937.

In the [[Book of Mormon]], '''Coriantumr''' ({{IPAc-en|Àå|k|…ír|i|Àà|√¶|n|t|…ô|m|…ôr}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from ¬´k≈çr-ƒì-ƒÉn¬¥ta-mer¬ª&lt;/ref&gt; is the name of three figures that appear throughout the book's narrative. Chronologically, they are one of the sons of Omer, a deposed [[Jaredite]] king who was later restored to his throne by his sons Esrom and Coriantumr; the last of the Jaredite kings, who lived to see his people destroyed and to see another people, the [[Mulekites]], live in the land; and a [[Nephite]] dissenter, who was made leader by the [[Lamanites]] over the Lamanite armies.

==Coriantumr (son of Omer)==

The first '''Coriantumr''' (chronologically) was one of the sons of [[Omer (Book of Mormon)|Omer]].  Omer had been deposed from his throne by his son Jared, who kept him imprisoned. [[Esrom (Book of Mormon)|Esrom]] and Coriantumr had been born while their father was held as a prisoner by [[Jared (Book of Mormon king)|Jared]].  Coriantumr and Esrom restored their father as the king of the Jaredites twice.  (See [[Omer (Book of Mormon)]] for more details.)

==Coriantumr (king)==

'''Coriantumr''' was one of the last [[Jaredite]]s, as well as one of their last kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Ether|chapter=12|verse=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his reign, Ether came under the direction of God to prophesy to the people, and could not be restrained.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Ether|chapter=12|verse=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, his prophecies were great and marvelous, and nobody believed because "they saw them not."&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Ether|chapter=12|verse=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, he was cast out, the prophecy of their destruction was given, and Ether remained in a cave, recording the events.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Ether|chapter=13|verse=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, Coriantumr was troubled in the same year Ether was cast out with a great war among the people.  Many rose up who were mighty men and sought to destroy him, "by their secret plans of wickedness."&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Ether|chapter=13|verse=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Coriantumr, being well-studied in war and other cunning learning, gave battle unto them. Neither he nor his house repented; neither did the house of Cohor and Corihor.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Ether|chapter=13|verse=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war took a turn for the bloodiest, and the king was wounded. Ether came to him and told him that the Lord would spare him and his household if they would repent; otherwise, they would be destroyed and another people would inherit the land and Coriantumr would be the last survivor to see them inherit the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Ether|chapter=13|verse=20-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coriantumr refused to repent and tried to kill Ether, who escaped.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Ether|chapter=13|verse=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then came Shared, who defeated the king and took him captive.  But his sons rescued him and reobtained the kingdom.  Still, there was great wickedness and robbery in the land. Afterward, the king fighting with Shared in wrath through the valley of Gilgal, then to the plains of Heshlon and back to the Valley of Gilgal, where Shared was slain.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Ether|chapter=13|verse=23-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the battle, Shared had wounded Coriantumr in the thigh and he did not go to battle for two years, leaving the people to war unrestrained.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Ether|chapter=13|verse=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The land then became cursed so badly that everything had to be kept on one's person or it would be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Ether|chapter=14|verse=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, every man sought to protect what was his. Then, Coriantumr fought with the brother of Shared, whose name was Gilead.  Gilead was beaten and chased to the [[wilderness of Akish]], where the battle was very horrid, with many thousands falling by the sword.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Ether|chapter=14|verse=2-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilead then rushed to the [[Moron (Book of Mormon)|Land of Moron]] in the night while Coriantumr's army was drunk; slaying many. He then sat on Coriantumr's throne for two years, while Coriantumr  gathered strength in the wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Ether|chapter=14|verse=5-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilead was slain by his high priest upon the throne. Lib (first referred to as a secret combination) then murdered the high priest in a secret pass and obtained the kingdom. Coriantumr came back and gave battle to Lib. Lib hurt Coriantumr's arm but that didn't stop Coriantumr. Lib fled to the borders of the seashore, where they fought again.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Ether|chapter=14|verse=9-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lib fled to the wilderness of Akish then to the plains of Agosh.  Coriantumr followed with all the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Ether|chapter=14|verse=14-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coriantumr then slew Lib but the brother of Lib, [[Shiz]], took up the cause, killing man, woman, and child.  The smell of the dead bodies was horrid and it troubled the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Ether|chapter=14|verse=16-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shiz did not stop and swore to avenge his brother. But according to Ether's words Coriantumr did not fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Ether|chapter=14|verse=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shiz pursued him eastward to the seashore and fought for the space of three days. The destruction of Shiz's armies was so great that the people began to flee before the armies. People joined one or the others's armies as they felt they would die.

After many battles with Shiz on hilltops and such and after many close calls, Coriantumr wished to end the fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Ether|chapter=14-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the people were engaged in the battles.  Coriantumr began to repent of his sins and sent an epistle to Shiz asking for him to stop the war for the people's sake.  Shiz asked for the head of Coriantumr.  His army would not allow that.  They were drunken with anger and slept upon their swords.  The numbers dwindled down until only Shiz and Coriantumr were left.  They fought until Shiz fainted for of loss of blood and Coriantumr smote off his head.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Ether|chapter=15|verse=28‚Äì33}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coriantumr then wandered off to be found later by the Mulekites (people of Zarahemla), and lived with them nine months until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Omni|chapter=1|verse=19‚Äì21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coriantumr (dissenter)==
'''Coriantumr''' is also the name of a Nephite dissenter who the [[Lamanites]] king made leader over the Lamanite armies.  Coriantumr led them into battle against the Nephites in approximately 50 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Helaman|chapter=1|verse=15-17, 19-22, 25, 30, 32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The origins of Coriantumr are described in Chapter one of the book of Helaman as a descendant of Zarahemla, the founder of the city of Zarahemla and leader of the Mulekites at the time Mosiah I had found them.
In about 51 to 50 B.C. Tubaloth, son of the Nephite apostate king Ammoron (who became king of the Lamanites after his brother, Amalickiah had died). He stirred up the people of the Lamanites to war against the Nephites after the recent upheaval over the judgement seat between the sons of Pahoran.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Helaman|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He appointed Coriantumr over his armies, supposing that because of his great wisdom and strength, he would gain victory over the Nephites.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Helaman|chapter=1|verse=15-17, 19-22, 25, 30, 32}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is described as large in stature.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Helaman|chapter=1|verse=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coriantumr came with such speed and numerous hosts, that the Nephites were left totally unprepared.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Helaman|chapter=1|verse=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He cut down the watch at the entrance of the city and marched with his whole army into the city slaying all who did oppose them.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Helaman|chapter=1|verse=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pacumeni seeing this did flee to the walls and Coriantumr pursued and slew him against the walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Helaman|chapter=1|verse=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Now, after seeing the Nephites flee and be slain, Coriantumr became courageous in his heart and went out to march against the whole land, for  he had the capital which was the stronghold of the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Helaman|chapter=1|verse=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He then marched towards the city of Bountiful, so he could have the northern lands taken with the sword. He then supposed that the Nephites' strength was in the center of the land and marched straight up it.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Helaman|chapter=1|verse=23-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Now this tactic had given advantage to the Nephite commander Moronihah even though a lot of the Nephites had been slain in the surprise attack, for they had no idea that the Lamanite would come up the center of the land and would go about securing the border cities which they had gathered to defend.  Therefore, the Nephite army was not even in the middle of the land and they then surrounded the Lamanites. (Though before they had surrounded them, the Lamanites had taken many cities and slain many people.) Moronihah did this by sending Lehi, the Nephite commander to head them off with his armies before they got to Bountiful, all the while he was coming up behind. Lehi then routed them from Bountiful and Coriantumr's armies were about to flee back to Zarahemla, where they were met by Moronihah and thus a bloody battle ensued, in which the Lamanites could neither flee south, north, east or west.  Seeing that they could not retreat the Lamanites surrendered after Coriantumr had spurred them into the Nephite armies, which got him killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Helaman|chapter=1|verse=25-32}} describes the battles.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moronihah then took back Zarahemla and then sent the Lamanite prisoners home in peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Helaman|chapter=1|verse=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Davar''''' ({{lang-he|◊ì◊ë◊®}}, lit. ''Word'') was a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew-language]] daily newspaper published in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] and [[Israel]] between 1925 and May 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1097435.html Why did Ben Gurion call Begin a 'Hitlerist type'?] Haaretz, 7 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

It was relaunched in 2016, under the name Davar Rishon, as an online outlet by the [[Histadrut]]. 

==History==
''Davar'' was established by [[Moshe Beilinson]] and [[Berl Katznelson]], with Katznelson as its first editor. The first edition was published on 1 June 1925 under the name ''Davar ‚Äì Iton Poalei Eretz Yisrael (lit. ''Davar ‚Äì Newspaper of Eretz Yisrael Workers'').

The paper was successful, and published several supplements, including ''Davar HaPoelet'' (''[Female] Worker's Davar'', a women's paper), ''HaMeshek HaShitufi'' (''Co-operative Economy''), ''Davar HaShvua'' (''Davar This Week'') and ''Davar LeYeldim'' (''Davar for Children''), as well as the union newsletter ''Va'adken'' (''Update''). By 1950 it had around 400 employees and had an extensive distribution system.

Upon Katznelson's death in 1944 [[Zalman Shazar]], later [[President of Israel]], took over as editor. [[Hana Zemer]] edited the paper between 1970 and 1990.

After the formation of the [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor Party]] by the merger of [[Mapai]], [[Ahdut HaAvoda]] and [[Rafi (political party)|Rafi]] in 1968, ''[[LaMerhav]]'', the Ahdut HaAvoda-affiliated newspaper merged into ''Davar''. Its last edition published on 31 May 1971 with ''Davar'' officially renamed "''Davar ‚Äì Meuhad Im LaMerhav''" (lit. ''Davar ‚Äì United with LaMerhav'').

By the 1980s the paper was in severe financial difficulties. After Zemer retired in 1990, the paper had joint editors [[Yoram Peri]] and [[Daniel Bloch]]. The paper was renamed ''Davar Rishon'' and [[Ron Ben-Yishai]] took over as editor. However, the [[Histadrut]] closed the newspaper in 1996. Its building on the corner of Melchett and Shenkin streets in [[Tel Aviv]] was demolished and replaced by an apartment block.

In 2016, Davar Rishon was relaunched as a web-only news publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Histadrut revives ‚ÄòDavar‚Äô socialist newspaper online|last1=Cashman|first1=Greer Fay|date=June 8, 2016|access-date=October 25, 2016|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Culture/Histadrut-revives-Davar-socialist-newspaper-online-456210|newspaper=[[Jerusalem Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dhauli''' hills ({{lang-or|[[:or:‡¨ß‡¨â‡¨≥‡¨ø|'''‡¨ß‡¨â‡¨≥‡¨ø‡¨ó‡¨ø‡¨∞‡¨ø''']]}}) are located on the banks of the river [[Daya River|Daya]], 8&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Bhubaneswar]] in [[Odisha]] ([[India]]). It is a hill with vast open space adjoining it, and has major [[Edict]]s of [[Ashoka]] engraved on a mass of rock, by the side of the road leading to the summit of the hill.

== Significance ==
Dhauli hill is presumed to be the area where the [[Kalinga War]] was fought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.indiavideo.org/text/maurya-dynasty-kalinga-war-ashoka-49.php | title= Kalinga War and its impact on Ashoks | publisher= India Video |accessdate= April 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rock Edicts]] found here include Nos. I-X, XIV and two separate [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] Edicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lahiri |first1=Nayanjot |title=Ashoka in Ancient India |date=2015 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674915251 |page=425 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JaVRCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT425 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Kalinga Edict VI, he expresses his concern for the "''welfare of the whole world''". The rock-cut elephant above the Edicts is the earliest [[Buddhist]] sculpture of Odisha. The stone elephant shows the animal's foreparts only, though it has a fine sense of form and movement.&lt;ref name=US&gt;{{cite book |last1=Singh |first1=Upinder |title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century |date=2008 |publisher=Pearson Education India |isbn=9788131711200 |page=361 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&amp;pg=PA361 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered as one of the few remains of [[Mauryan art]].&lt;ref name=US/&gt;

[[Ashoka]] had a special weakness for Dhauli, where the battle was fought. The [[Daya River|Daya river]] is said to have turned red with the blood of the many deceased after the battle, and enabled Ashoka to realize the magnitude of horror associated with war. He saw to it that Dhauli became an important centre of Buddhist activities. He built several [[chaitya]]s, [[stupa]]s and [[Column|pillars]] there. He got abodes excavated for the recluse, instructions inscribed for officials, expounded the main principles of '''dandaniti''' (strict enforcement of laws) for the public, provided special status to his new kingdom including the stupas at Dhauli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.dhauli.net/ | title= Dhauli Hills, Bhubaneswar, Odisha |publisher= |accessdate= April 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the top of the hill, a dazzling white peace pagoda has been built by the ''Japan Buddha Sangha'' and the ''Kalinga Nippon Buddha Sangha'' in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://odishatourism.gov.in/?q=node/210 | title= Dhauli | publisher= Odisha Tourism, Government of Odisha |accessdate= August 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nearby region also houses Ashokan edicts and possibly a [[Stupa]] at Bhaskareshwar temple at Tankapani road as arglars.
The Dhauligiri hills also has an ancient [[Shiva]] temple which is the place for mass gathering during [[Maha Shivaratri|Shiva Ratri]] Celebrations.

'''Lady Georgiana Fullerton''' ({{nee|Leveson-Gower}}; 23 September 1812 ‚Äì 19 January 1885) was an English novelist and school founder.

==Biography==
Georgiana Charlotte Leveson-Gower was the daughter of [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Granville]] and his wife [[Harriet Leveson-Gower, Countess Granville|Lady Harriet Cavendish]], and a sister of the prominent statesman [[Granville George Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville]]. In 1833 she married in Paris an attach√© of the embassy, Alexander George Fullerton, who came from Ireland.

She converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] in 1846 and wrote&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06318a.htm|title=Lady Georgiana Charlotte Fullerton|work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=2007-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Life of St. Frances of Rome, and Others''. She wrote several novels, some of which were very successful. They include ''[[Ellen Middleton]]'' (1844), ''[[Grantley Manor]]'' (1847), ''Lady Bird'' (1852), ''Life of St.Francis of Rome'' (1855), ''The Countess of Bonneval'' (1858), ''Rose Leblanc'' (1861), ''Laurentia, a Tale of Japan'' (1861),  ''[[Too Strange Not to Be True]]'' (1864), ''Constance Sherwood'' (1865), ''A Stormy Life'' (1867), ''Helpers of the Holy Soul'' (1868), ''Mrs. Gerald's Niece'' (1869), ''Life of Louisa de Carvajal'' (1873), ''A Will and a Way'' (1881), and ''Life of Elizabeth Lady Falkland'' (1883). She also published two volumes of verse.

She founded [[Saint Walburga's School]], in [[Bournemouth]], which survives, albeit on a new site, and a Blue Plaque to commemorate her Catholic activities can be found on the Sacred Heart church in [[Bournemouth]].

In a margin note in his copy of ''Ellen Middleton'', [[Edgar Allan Poe]] wrote: ''A remarkable work, and one which I find much difficulty in admitting to be the composition of a woman. Not that many good and glorious things have not been the composition of women ‚Äî but, because, here, the severe precision of style, the thoroughness, and the luminousness, are points never observable, in even the most admirable of their writings''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eapoe.org/works/misc/mar1244.htm Edgar Allan Poe: Marginalia]. Retrieved 2 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Greg L. Bahnsen''' (September 17, 1948&amp;nbsp;‚Äì December 11, 1995) was an American [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] [[Christian philosophy|philosopher]], [[Christian apologetics|apologist]], and debater. He was a [[minister of religion|minister]] in the [[Orthodox Presbyterian Church]] and a full-time Scholar in Residence for the Southern California Center for Christian Studies (SCCCS). He is also considered a contributor to the field of Christian apologetics, as he popularized the [[Presuppositional apologetics|presuppositional]] method of [[Cornelius Van Til]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He is the father of [[David L. Bahnsen]], an American portfolio manager, author, and television commentator.

==Early life and education==

He was the first born of two sons of Robert and Virginia Bahnsen in [[Auburn, Washington]], and grew up in [[Pico Rivera, California]]. In youth he was beset by a number of medical difficulties, the most serious of which was a lifelong [[blood platelet]] problem that made it difficult for him to stop bleeding. He also had heart trouble which came to light only during his first college admissions medical exam.

Raised in the [[Orthodox Presbyterian Church]], he actively participated in religious activities. He first began reading the apologetics of [[Cornelius Van Til]] when in high school. While attending [[Westmont College]] he began writing for the [[Chalcedon Foundation]] of [[R.J. Rushdoony|Rousas J. Rushdoony]] and soon came to admire the latter's strong Calvinistic convictions.

In 1970 Bahnsen graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' from Westmont College, receiving his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in philosophy as well as the John Bunyan Smith Award for his overall [[grade point average]]. From there he went on to [[Westminster Theological Seminary]] in [[Philadelphia]], where he studied under [[Cornelius Van Til]]. The two became close friends. When he graduated in May 1973, he simultaneously received two degrees, [[Master of Divinity]] and [[Master of Theology]], as well as the William Benton Greene Prize in apologetics and a Richard Weaver Fellowship from the [[Intercollegiate Studies Institute]]. His next academic stop was the [[University of Southern California]] (USC), where he studied [[philosophy]], specializing in the [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]]. In 1975, after receiving ordination in the Orthodox Presbyterian Church, he became an associate professor of Apologetics and Ethics at [[Reformed Theological Seminary]] in [[Jackson, Mississippi]]. While there, he completed his studies at USC, receiving his [[Ph.D.]] in 1978.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bahnsen|first1=Greg|title=Always Ready: Directiond for Defending the Faith|date=September 2011|publisher=Covenant Media Press|location=Nacogdoches|isbn=0-915815-28-1|pages=ix‚Äìx}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
==Later life==
One of the original pillars of [[Christian Reconstructionism|Christian Reconstruction]], Bahnsen was a leading proponent of [[theonomy]], [[postmillennialism]], and [[presuppositional apologetics]]. He lectured to a broad range of [[evangelical Christian]] groups at many colleges and conferences, not only throughout the [[United States]], but in [[Scotland]] and [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chalcedon.edu/featured/gentry.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040616083133/http://www.chalcedon.edu/featured/gentry.shtml|title=The Chalcedon Foundation ‚Äì Faith for All of Life|archivedate=16 June 2004|work=chalcedon.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published numerous articles and has over 1700 audio tapes, videos, articles, and books to his name.

Greg Bahnsen's vocal advocacy of Christian Reconstructionism and theonomy was highly controversial during his lifetime, and a public disputation pertaining to theonomy led to his dismissal from the [[Reformed Theological Seminary]] in Jackson, Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opc.org/OS/html/V4/2b.html|title=Theonomy: What Have We Learned?|work=opc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he was known for his public debates on [[apologetics]], theonomy, [[religion]] (such as [[Roman Catholicism]], [[Islam]], and [[Judaism]]), and a variety of socio-political issues (such as [[abortion]], [[gun control]], and [[homosexuality]]).

Bahnsen is perhaps best known for his debates with such leading [[atheism|atheists]] as [[George H. Smith]], [[Gordon Stein]], and [[Edward Tabash]]. The debate with Stein marked one of the earliest uses of a [[transcendental argument for the existence of God]] (TAG).

In 1994 a controversy emerged after atheist philosopher [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]] was informed just three weeks before a scheduled debate with Bahnsen, "that Bahnsen would not debate unless Martin gave written permission to SCCCS to tape the debate" for resale to support SCCCS.  Martin refused, because "he did not want SCCCS to profit from his participation", while SCCCS refused to let Bahnsen debate without the debate being taped. The debate was canceled.&lt;ref name='Stein_debate'&gt;{{cite news | first=Jeffery Jay | last=Lowder | title=Martin and Stein Respond to SCCCS | date=May 1996 | publisher=[[Internet Infidels]] | url =http://www.infidels.org/infidels/newsletter/1996/may.html#scccs | work =Internet Infidels Newsletter | accessdate = November 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since that time Martin has responded to Bahnsen's use of TAG, doing so in his own debates with [[Michael Butler (apologist)|Michael Butler]], [[John Frame (philosopher)|John Frame]], and Douglas Jones, and has published his "Transcendental Argument for the Non-Existence of God" in the journal of the [[New Zealand Association of Rationalists and Humanists]], as well as in essays posted on the [[Secular Web]].&lt;ref name='induction'&gt;{{cite news | first=Michael | last=Martin | title=Does Induction Presume the Existence of the Christian God?

==Death==
Due to his lifelong medical problems, Bahnsen had to undergo a third [[aortic valve]] implant surgery on December 5, 1995. After the completion of the operation, serious complications developed within twenty-four hours. He then became comatose for several days and died on [[December_11#Deaths|December 11]], 1995 at the age of forty-seven.

The '''Haredi burqa sect''' ([[Hebrew]]: ◊†◊©◊ï◊™ ◊î◊©÷∏◊ê◊ú÷¥◊ô◊ù ''Ne≈°√≥t Ha≈†√§l√≠m'', meaning "Shal(-wearing) Women"), is a religious group within [[Haredi Judaism]], primarily concentrated in [[Israel]], which claims that modesty requires a [[burqa]]-style covering of a woman's entire body, a ''shal'' (plural ''shalim'', "shawl"), including a veil covering the face. The garment, which looks more like a [[niqab]] than a burqa, is also called ''frumka'', a play of the word [[frum]] ([[Yiddish]] for "devout") and "burqa". The group, which was estimated to number around 100 in 2008 and several hundred {{as of|2011|alt=in 2011}}, is concentrated in the town of [[Beit Shemesh]].

The issue has proven controversial in Haredi circles, with vocal condemnation of the face covering veil by some Haredi organizations, including [[Edah HaChareidis]].

==History==

The frumka as a mode of dress for Haredi women was encouraged by Bruria Keren, an Israeli religious leader who taught a strict (by Orthodox standards) interpretation of Jewish scripture for female adherents. Keren, who covers herself in several layers of clothing, claims that covering women was originally a Jewish tradition, and that she has seen a 400-year-old picture of Jewish women covered from head to toe.&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=88381958|title = A Jewish Movement to Shroud the Female Form|work= NPR|date = March 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also Sephardic women, who claim that their mothers covered their bodies entirely so that one cannot discern their figures. A sect member is reported to have explained that she‚Äôs ‚Äúfollowing these rules of modesty to save men from themselves. A man who sees a woman's body parts is sexually aroused, and this might cause him to commit sin. Even if he doesn't actually sin physically, his impure thoughts are sin in themselves‚Äù.  The religious group, which was estimated to number around 100 in 2008 and may have grown to several hundred by 2011,&lt;ref name="Asianews"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Controversy-in-Israel-over-burqa-wearing-ultra-Orthodox-Jews-20726.html| title=Controversy in Israel over burqa-wearing ultra-Orthodox Jews| work=Asia News | date=September 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is concentrated in Beit Shemesh, but also has followers in [[Safed]] and [[Jerusalem]]. The majority of the women have secular backgrounds.&lt;ref name=novick&gt;Akiva Novick:[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4021877,00.html 'Taliban women': A cover story] Ynet, 02.06.11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JP96228"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=96228|title = Beit Shemesh 'Burka' cult unveiled|author = Matthew Wagner|work= Jerusalem Post|date = March 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008, Bruria Keren was arrested on charges of severely abusing her children.&lt;ref name="JP96228" /&gt; Identified in court as "B.", she was convicted by the Jerusalem District Court in 2009 on three counts of abuse of a minor or helpless person and 25 counts of assault in aggravated circumstances, and sentenced to four years in prison. Her husband, identified in court as "M." was also convicted of 10 counts of assault and three counts of abuse of a minor or helpless person, and was sentenced to six months in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.haaretz.co.il/news/law/1.1263609|title = The Trial of "Mother Taliban"|author = Tamar Rotem|work= Haaretz|date = June 1, 2009 |language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other practices==

Bruria Keren does not speak in front of men and has taken on various ascetic practices. During her prison term, she was hospitalized several times for malnutrition and other maladies as a result of her unwillingness to eat the food provided.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/130547/israel-taliban-mom-set-to-be-released-on-sunday.html Israel: Taliban Mom Set to be Released on Sunday] ''The Yeshiva World News'', June 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of the group reportedly [[vaccine controversies|do not believe in vaccination or treatments]]. On February 8, 2013, one woman's baby allegedly died from untreated flu, with the parents then fleeing from the law. On another occasion, a newborn baby had to be taken to hospital by force, after the mother had refused to go to hospital to give birth to avoid contact with hospitals and physicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART2/434/989.html?hp=1&amp;cat=402&amp;loc=1| title=◊ó◊©◊ì: ◊™◊ô◊†◊ï◊ß ◊ë◊ü ◊©◊†◊î ◊û◊™ ◊û◊©◊§◊¢◊™ ◊ú◊ê◊ó◊® ◊©◊ú◊ê ◊ó◊ï◊°◊ü |work=Maariv| date=February 7, 2013|language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cases of child abuse and neglect have been reported within the group.&lt;ref name="baby"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://failedmessiah.typepad.com/failed_messiahcom/2013/02/burka-cult-baby-found-dying-parents-nowhere-to-be-found-678.html|title=Burka Cult Baby Found Dying, Parents Nowhere To Be Found|work=Failed Messiah.com|date= February 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children have been removed from school by their mothers and in one case a woman fled with her children because of a disagreement with a school. The women have also been reported to refuse marital relations. In another case, a 15-year-old boy was married to a 23-year-old woman at the decision of two of the group‚Äôs leaders. After the wedding, the groom wanted to divorce his wife, but she refused. As a result, the boy took an additional wife, with his family‚Äôs blessing. The new marriage caused a burst of anger and led the first wife to ultimately agree to the divorce.{{CN|date=February 2018}}

==Perception in Israeli society==

The Israeli press has adopted the informal epithet "[[Taliban]] mothers" to refer to the followers of Bruria Keren's teachings on modesty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.forward.com/articles/137102|title = France‚Äôs Ban, and Israel‚Äôs Burka Problem|author = Miriam Shaviv|work=[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]|date = April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Miriam Shaviv]] the estimated 100 ‚Äúgullible and needy‚Äù Jewish women for whom Keren was a holy woman, were not forced but convinced by Keren ‚Äúthat the ideal for a woman was not to be seen in public (and not even to be heard ‚Äì she used to stop talking for days on end). Negating themselves, she was telling them, making themselves invisible, was the height of [[frumkeit]], while in fact it has no basis whatsoever in [[halachah]]‚Äù.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Miriam Shaviv|title=Should Israel Ban the Burka?|url=http://www.thejc.com/blogpost/should-israel-ban-burka|accessdate=January 25, 2011|newspaper=The Jewish Chronicle|date=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Israel National Council for the Child]] has requested the Welfare Ministry to look into the matter and make sure this behavior is not harmful to the girls.&lt;ref name=novick /&gt;

===Religious and legal reaction===

The response by other Orthodox schools has been stronger than the rest of the public, and characterized by consternation, particularly against the shal garment.&lt;ref name=novick /&gt;  An anonymous ''[[pashkevil]]'' condemning the "cult" of "[[Epikoros (Judaism)|epikoros]]" women was posted in Jerusalem in September 2011. The [[Edah HaChareidis]] issued an edict declaring the act of wearing the shawl to be a [[sexual fetish]] as deviant as scant clothing or nudity. "There is a real danger that by exaggerating, you are doing the opposite of what is intended [resulting in] severe transgressions in sexual matters,‚Äù explains Edah member Rabbi Shlomo Pappenheim. The religious court of [[Beit Shemesh]] has issued a sharp condemnation of the group, and warned Jewish women and girls not to be drawn after them or follow their customs.&lt;ref name=bloomfield&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/7919501/Israeli-rabbis-clamp-down-on-burka.html|title = Israeli rabbis clamp down on burka|author = Adrian Bloomfield|date = July 30, 2010| work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People in Beit Shemesh, which includes some of the most religiously radical sects in Orthodoxy, considered the group of women ridiculously ‚Äì even psychotically ‚Äì zealous.&lt;ref name="JP96228"/&gt; Even [[Sikrikim]] came out against the phenomenon of wearing veils, which they consider extreme. The women were regularly ostracized and humiliated by the local haredi community because of their clothing. "We pulled them off buses and yelled at them, 'Desecrators of God's name!'", one inhabitant said.&lt;ref name="JP96228" /&gt; The movement has caused severe distress among the women's husbands and relatives, although most husbands endure it. Some men accuse the covered women of being immodest, because they draw more attention to themselves with their unusual dress.&lt;ref name=npr /&gt;&lt;ref name=novick /&gt; One man went to a rabbinical court in an attempt to get a ruling to force his wife to stop wearing the burka. Instead, the court, however, found the woman's behaviour so "extreme" that it ordered the couple to undergo an immediate religious divorce.&lt;ref name=bloomfield /&gt;

In 2014, Israeli police shot a member of the sect after she walked into the [[Western Wall]] area without stopping at a security checkpoint. She survived and was taken to the hospital for treatment.&lt;ref name="shooting"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/israel/article/police_shoot_jewish_woman_at_western_wall|title=Police shoot Jewish woman at Western Wall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===

[[Yair Nehorai]], an Israeli lawyer who has represented individuals involved in the "Taliban Mother" case and other orthodox extremists, has written a book loosely based on the real-life "Taliban Mother" case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Driving Out the Darkness of the Taliban Mother | work=Ynet| date=January 25, 2012| url= http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4178976,00.html| accessdate=July 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book, "Taliban Son" has been released in Hebrew and in German translation.

'''Homer''' ({{IPAc-en|Àà|h|o ä|m|…ôr}}; {{lang-grc-gre|·ΩçŒºŒ∑œÅŒøœÇ}} {{IPA-el|h√≥m…õÀêros}}, ''H√≥mƒìros'') is the legendary author of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', two epic poems that are the central works of [[ancient Greek literature]]. The ''Iliad'' is set during the [[Trojan War]], the ten-year siege of the city of [[Troy]] by a coalition of Greek kingdoms. It focuses on a quarrel between King [[Agamemnon]] and the warrior [[Achilles]] lasting a few weeks during the last year of the war. The ''Odyssey'' focuses on the journey home of [[Odysseus]], king of Ithaca, around 20 years after the fall of Troy. Many [[ancient accounts of Homer|accounts of Homer's life]] circulated in [[classical antiquity]], the most widespread being that he was a blind [[bard]] from [[Ionia]], a region of central coastal [[Anatolia]] in present-day [[Turkey]]. Modern scholars consider them legends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Nigel|title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136788000|pages=366|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8pXhAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA366|accessdate=22 November 2016|language=en|date=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Romilly|first1=Jacqueline de|title=A Short History of Greek Literature|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226143125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y_DTllltXBQC&amp;pg=PA1|pages=1|accessdate=22 November 2016|language=en|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bgr&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graziosi|first1=Barbara|title=Inventing Homer: The Early Reception of Epic|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521809665|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vCHsh9QWzLYC&amp;pg=PA15|pages=15|accessdate=22 November 2016|language=en|date=2002-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Homeric Question]]‚Äîconcerning by whom, when, where and under what circumstances the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' were composed‚Äîcontinues to be debated. Broadly speaking, modern scholarly opinion falls into two groups. One holds that most of the ''Iliad'' and (according to some) the ''Odyssey'' are the works of a single poet of genius. The other considers the Homeric poems to be the result of a process of working and reworking by many contributors, and that "Homer" is best seen as a label for an entire tradition.&lt;ref name="bgr" /&gt; It is generally accepted that the poems were composed at some point around the late eighth or early seventh century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Croally|first1=Neil|last2=Hyde|first2=Roy|title=Classical Literature: An Introduction|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136736629|page=26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g-arAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26|accessdate=23 November 2016|language=en|date=2011-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poems are in [[Homeric Greek]], also known as Epic Greek, a [[literary language]] which shows a mixture of features of the [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] and [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolic]] dialects from different centuries; the predominant influence is Eastern Ionic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hose|first1=Martin|last2=Schenker|first2=David|title=A Companion to Greek Literature|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118885956|page=445|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DgBSCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA445|language=en|date=2015-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=D.

== Works attributed to Homer ==

Today only the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' are associated with the name 'Homer'. In antiquity, a very large number of other works were sometimes attributed to him, including the ''[[Homeric Hymns]]'', the ''[[Contest of Homer and Hesiod]]'', the ''[[Little Iliad]]'', the ''[[Nostoi]]'', the ''[[Thebaid (Greek poem)|Thebaid]]'', the ''[[Cypria]]'', the ''[[Epigoni (epic)|Epigoni]]'', the comic mini-epic ''[[Batrachomyomachia]]'' ("The Frog-Mouse War"), the ''[[Margites]]'', the ''[[Capture of Oechalia]]'', and the ''[[Phocais]]''. These claims are not considered authentic today and were by no means universally accepted in the ancient world. As with the multitude of legends surrounding Homer's life, they indicate little more than the centrality of Homer to ancient Greek culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Kelly|first1=Adrian D.|title=Homerica|journal=The Homer Encyclopedia|date=2012|doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe0606|language=en|isbn=9781405177689}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graziosi|first1=Barbara|last2=Haubold|first2=Johannes|title=Homer: The Resonance of Epic|date=2005|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9780715632826|pages=24‚Äì26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LiDUAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graziosi|first1=Barbara|title=Inventing Homer: The Early Reception of Epic|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521809665|pages=165‚Äì168|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vCHsh9QWzLYC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ancient biographies of Homer ==

{{details|Ancient accounts of Homer}}

Many traditions circulated in the ancient world concerning Homer, most of which are lost. Modern scholarly consensus is that they have no value as history. 

Some claims were established early and repeated often. They include that Homer was blind (taking as self-referential a passage describing the blind bard [[Demodocus (Odyssey character)|Demodocus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graziosi|first1=Barbara|title=Inventing Homer: The Early Reception of Epic|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521809665|pages=138|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vCHsh9QWzLYC&amp;pg=PA138|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odyssey, 8:64ff.&lt;/ref&gt;), that he was born in [[Chios]], that he was the son of the [[river Meles]] and the nymph [[Crithe√Øs]], that he was a wandering bard, that he composed a varying list of other works (the "Homerica"), that he died either in [[Ios (island)|Ios]] or after failing to solve a riddle set by fishermen, and various explanations for the name "Homer".

===Modern===
In 1488, the Greek scholar [[Demetrios Chalkokondyles]] published the ''[[editio princeps]]'' of the Homeric poems.&lt;ref name="Lamberton2010"/&gt; The earliest modern Homeric scholars started with the same basic approaches towards the Homeric poems as scholars in antiquity.&lt;ref name="Lamberton2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="West2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dickey2012"/&gt; The allegorical interpretation of the Homeric poems that had been so prevalent in antiquity returned to become the prevailing view of the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="Lamberton2010"/&gt; Renaissance humanists praised Homer as the archetypically wise poet, whose writings contain hidden wisdom, disguised through allegory.&lt;ref name="Lamberton2010"/&gt; In western Europe during the [[Renaissance]], [[Virgil]] was more widely read than Homer and Homer was often seen through a Virgilian lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Heiden|first1=Bruce|title=Scholarship, Renaissance through 17th Century|journal=The Homer Encyclopedia|date=2012|doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe1310|language=en|isbn=9781405177689}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1664, contradicting the widespread praise of Homer as the epitome of wisdom, [[Fran√ßois H√©delin, abb√© d'Aubignac]] wrote a scathing attack on the Homeric poems, declaring that they were incoherent, immoral, tasteless, and without style, that Homer never existed, and that the poems were hastily cobbled together by incompetent editors from unrelated oral songs.&lt;ref name="West2011"/&gt; Fifty years later, the English scholar [[Richard Bentley]] concluded that Homer did exist, but that he was an obscure, prehistoric oral poet whose compositions bear little relation to the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'' as they have been passed down.&lt;ref name="West2011"/&gt; According to Bentley, Homer "wrote a Sequel of Songs and Rhapsodies, to be sung by himself for small Earnings and good Cheer at Festivals and other Days of Merriment; the ''Ilias'' he wrote for men, and the ''Odysseis'' for the other Sex.

[[Friedrich August Wolf]]'s ''Prolegomena ad Homerum'', published in 1795, argued that much of the material later incorporated into the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'' was originally composed in the tenth century BC in the form of short, separate oral songs,&lt;ref name="Heiden18thcenturyscholarship"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Heiden|first1=Bruce|title=Scholarship, 18th Century|journal=The Homer Encyclopedia|date=2012|doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe1311|language=en|isbn=9781405177689}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heidennineteenth century scholarship"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Heiden|first1=Bruce|title=Scholarship, 19th Century|journal=The Homer Encyclopedia|date=2012|doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe1312|language=en|isbn=9781405177689}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="West2011"/&gt; which passed through oral tradition for roughly four hundred years before being assembled into prototypical versions of the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'' the sixth century BC by literate authors.&lt;ref name="Heiden18thcenturyscholarship"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heidennineteenth century scholarship"/&gt;&lt;ref name="West2011"/&gt; After being written down, Wolf maintained that the two poems were extensively edited, modernized, and eventually shaped into their present state as artistic unities.&lt;ref name="Heiden18thcenturyscholarship"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heidennineteenth century scholarship"/&gt;&lt;ref name="West2011"/&gt; Wolf and the "Analyst" school, which led the field in the nineteenth century, sought to recover the original, authentic poems which were thought to be concealed by later excrescences.&lt;ref name="Heiden18thcenturyscholarship"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heidennineteenth century scholarship"/&gt;&lt;ref name="West2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taplin1986"&gt;{{cite book|last=Taplin|first=Oliver|authorlink=Oliver Taplin|date=1986|chapter=2: Homer|title=The Oxford History of the Classical World|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7EloAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Homer|editor1-last=Boardman|editor1-first=John|editor2-last=Griffin|editor2-first=Jasper|editor3-last=Murray|editor3-first=Oswyn|location=Oxford, England|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0198721123|pages=50‚Äì77|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Analyst school were two camps: proponents of the "lay theory," which held that the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'' were put together from a large number of short, independent songs,&lt;ref name="West2011"/&gt; and proponents of the "nucleus theory", which held that Homer had originally composed shorter versions of the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'', which later poets expanded and revised.&lt;ref name="West2011"/&gt; A small group of scholars opposed to the Analysts, dubbed "Unitarians", saw the later additions as superior, the work of a single inspired poet.&lt;ref name="Heiden18thcenturyscholarship"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heidennineteenth century scholarship"/&gt;&lt;ref name="West2011"/&gt; By around 1830, the central preoccupations of Homeric scholars, dealing with whether or not "Homer" actually existed, when and how the Homeric poems originated, how they were transmitted, when and how they were finally written down, and their overall unity, had been dubbed "the Homeric Question".&lt;ref name="West2011"/&gt;

Most contemporary scholars, although they disagree on other questions about the genesis of the poems, agree that the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'' were not produced by the same author, based on "the many differences of narrative manner, theology, ethics, vocabulary, and geographical perspective, and by the apparently imitative character of certain passages of the ''Odyssey'' in relation to the ''Iliad''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = M.L. | year = 1999 | title = The Invention of Homer | jstor = 639863| journal = Classical Quarterly | volume = 49 | issue = 2| page = 364 | doi=10.1093/cq/49.2.364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=West|first1=Martin L.|title=Homeric Question|journal=The Homer Encyclopedia|date=2012|doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe0605|language=en|isbn=9781405177689}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Latacz|first1=Joachim|last2=Bierl|first2=Anton|last3=Olson|first3=S.

"'Homer" is a name of unknown etymological origin, around which many theories were erected in antiquity. One such linkage was to the Greek {{lang|grc|·ΩÖŒºŒ∑œÅŒøœÇ}} (''h√≥mƒìros''), "hostage" (or "surety"). The explanations suggested by modern scholars tend to mirror their position on the overall Homeric question. Nagy interprets it as "he who fits (the song) together".

{{Main|Historicity of the Homeric epics}}

Scholars continue to debate questions such as whether the Trojan War actually took place ‚Äî and if so when and where ‚Äî and to what extent the society depicted by Homer is based on his own or one which was, even at the time of the poems' composition, known only as legend. The Homeric epics are largely set in the east and center of the [[Mediterranean]], with some scattered references to [[Egypt]], [[Ethiopia]] and other distant lands, in a warlike society that resembles that of the Greek world slightly before the hypothesized date of the poems' composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Raaflaub|first1=Kurt A.|title=Historicity of Homer|journal=The Homer Encyclopedia|date=2012|doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe0601|language=en|isbn=9781405177689}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finley|first1=Moses I.|title=The World of Odysseus|date=1991|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9780140136869|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yaeBPwAACAAJ|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wees|first1=Hans van|title=War and Violence in Ancient Greece|date=2009|publisher=ISD LLC|isbn=9781910589298|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0PtODgAAQBAJ|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morris|first1=Ian|title=The Use and Abuse of Homer|journal=Classical Antiquity|date=1986|volume=5|issue=1|pages=81‚Äì138|doi=10.2307/25010840|jstor=25010840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient Greek chronology, the sack of Troy was dated to 1184 BC. By the nineteenth century, there was widespread scholarly skepticism that Troy or the Trojan War had ever existed, but in 1873 [[Heinrich Schliemann]] announced to the world that he had discovered the ruins of Homer's Troy at [[Hissarlik]] in modern [[Turkey]]. Some contemporary scholars think the destruction of Troy VIIa ''circa'' 1220 BC was the origin of the myth of the Trojan War, others that the poem was inspired by multiple similar sieges that took place over the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dowden|first1=Ken|last2=Livingstone|first2=Niall|title=A Companion to Greek Mythology|date=2011|page=440|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781444396935|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_XsN0O_BQ0cC&amp;pg=PA440|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Homeric language ==
{{Main|Homeric Greek}}
[[File:Cropped image of Homer from Raphael's Parnassus.jpg|thumb|Detail of ''[[The Parnassus]]'' (painted 1509-1510) by [[Raphael]], depicting Homer wearing a crown of laurels atop [[Mount Parnassus]], with [[Dante Alighieri]] on his right and [[Virgil]] on his left]]
The Homeric epics are written in an artificial [[literary language]] or 'Kunstsprache' only used in epic [[hexameter]] poetry. Homeric Greek shows features of multiple regional Greek dialects and periods, but is fundamentally based on [[Ionic Greek]], in keeping with the tradition that Homer was from Ionia. Linguistic analysis suggests that the ''Iliad'' was composed slightly before the ''Odyssey'', and that Homeric formulae preserve older features than other parts of the poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Willi|first1=Andreas|title=Language, Homeric|journal=The Homer Encyclopedia|date=2012|doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe0792|language=en|isbn=9781405177689}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bakker|first1=Egbert J.|title=A Companion to the Ancient Greek Language|date=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781444317404|pages=401|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oa42E3DP3icC&amp;pg=PA401|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Homeric style ==

The Homeric poems were composed in unrhymed [[dactylic hexameter]]; ancient Greek [[metre (poetry)|metre]] was quantity rather than stress-based.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=W. Edwards|first1=Mark|title=Meter|journal=The Homer Encyclopedia|date=2012|doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe0913|language=en|isbn=9781405177689}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nussbaum|first1=G.

These habits aid the extemporizing bard, and are characteristic of oral poetry. For instance, the main words of a Homeric sentence are generally placed towards the beginning, whereas literate poets like [[Virgil]] or [[John Milton|Milton]] use longer and more complicated syntactical structures. Homer then expands on these ideas in subsequent clauses; this technique is called [[parataxis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Mark W.|title=Style|journal=The Homer Encyclopedia|date=2012|doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe1377|language=en|isbn=9781405177689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The so-called '[[type scene]]s' (''typischen Scenen''), were named by [[Walter Arend]] in 1933. He noted that Homer often, when describing frequently recurring activities such as eating, praying, fighting and dressing, used blocks of set phrases in sequence that were then elaborated by the poet. The 'Analyst' school had considered these repetitions as un-Homeric, whereas Arend interpreted them philosophically. Parry and Lord noted that these conventions are found in many other cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Reece|first1=Steve T.|title=Type-Scenes|journal=The Homer Encyclopedia|date=2012|doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe1488|language=en|isbn=9781405177689}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edwards|first1=MW|title=Homer and Oral Tradition: The Type-Scene|journal=Oral Tradition|date=1992|volume=7|pages=284‚Äì330|url=http://www.citeulike.org/group/5373/article/4187736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'Ring composition' or [[chiastic structure]] (when a phrase or idea is repeated at both the beginning and end of a story, or a series of such ideas first appears in the order A, B, C... before being reversed as ...C, B, A) has been observed in the Homeric epics. Opinion differs as to whether these occurrences are a conscious artistic device, a mnemonic aid or a spontaneous feature of human storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stanley|first1=Keith|title=The Shield of Homer: Narrative Structure in the Illiad|date=2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400863372|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jz8ABAAAQBAJ|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Minchin|first1=Elizabeth|title=Ring Composition|journal=The Homer Encyclopedia|date=2012|doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe1287|language=en|isbn=9781405177689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both of the Homeric poems begin with an invocation to the [[Muse]].&lt;ref name="Adler2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adler|first1=Eve|title=Vergil's Empire: Political Thought in the Aeneid|date=2003|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|location=Lanham, Maryland|isbn=978-0-7425-2167-4|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gbUaAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;q=Homer's%20Muse}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Iliad'', the poet invokes her to sing of "the anger of Achilles",&lt;ref name="Adler2003"/&gt; and, in the ''Odyssey'', he asks her to sing of "the man of many ways".&lt;ref name="Adler2003"/&gt; A similar opening was later employed by Virgil in his ''[[Aeneid]]''.&lt;ref name="Adler2003"/&gt;

== Textual transmission ==
[[File:Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema, English (born Netherlands) - A Reading from Homer - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|''A Reading from Homer'' (1885) by [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]]]]

The orally transmitted Homeric poems were put into written form at some point between the eighth and sixth centuries BC. Some scholars believe that they were dictated by the poet; [[Albert Lord]] noted that, in the process of dictating, the Balkan bards he recorded revised and extended their lays. Some scholars hypothesize that a similar process occurred when the Homeric poems were first written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirk|first1=G. S.|title=Homer and the Oral Tradition|date=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521213097|pages=117|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IgHVXQfEzA4C&amp;pg=PA117|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Foley|first1=John Miles|title=Oral Dictated Texts|journal=The Homer Encyclopedia|date=2012|doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe1029|language=en|isbn=9781405177689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars such as [[Gregory Nagy]] hold that, after the poems were formed in the eight century, they were orally transmitted with little deviation until they were written down in the sixth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nagy|first1=Gregory|title=Poetry as Performance: Homer and Beyond|date=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521558488|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6GCHXNMeHMoC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After textualisation, the poems were each divided into 24 rhapsodes, today referred to as books, and labelled by the letters of the [[Greek alphabet]]. These divisions probably date from before 200 BC, and may have been made by Homer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=West|first1=Martin L.|title=Book Division|journal=The Homer Encyclopedia|date=2012|doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe0253|language=en|isbn=9781405177689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In antiquity, it was widely held that the Homeric poems were collected and organised in Athens in the late sixth century BC by the tyrant [[Pesistratos]] (died 528/7 BC), in what subsequent scholars have dubbed the "Pesistratean recension".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jensen|first1=Minna Skafte|title=The Homeric Question and the Oral-formulaic Theory|date=1980|publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press|isbn=9788772890968|pages=128|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xgyJoouOkyAC&amp;pg=PA128|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamberton2010"/&gt; The idea that the Homeric poems were originally transmitted orally and first written down during the reign of Peisistratos is referenced by the first-century BC Roman orator [[Cicero]] and is also referenced in a number of other surviving sources, including two ancient ''Lives of Homer''.&lt;ref name="Lamberton2010"/&gt; From around 150 BC, the texts of the Homeric poems seem to have become relatively established. After the establishment of the [[Library of Alexandria]], Homeric scholars such as [[Zenodotus]] of Ephesus, [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]] and in particular [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] helped establish a canonical text.&lt;ref name=Haslam2012&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Haslam|first1=Michael|title=Text and Transmission|journal=The Homer Encyclopedia|date=2012|doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe1413|language=en|isbn=9781405177689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first printed edition of Homer was produced in 1488 in Milan. Today scholars use medieval manuscripts, [[papyri]] and other sources; some argue for a 'multi-text' view, rather than seeking a single definitive text. The nineteenth-century edition of [[Arthur Ludwich]] mainly follows Aristarchus's work, whereas van Thiel's (1991,1996) follows the medieval vulgate. Others, such as [[Martin Litchfield West|Martin West]] (1998-2000) or T.W. Allen fall somewhere between these two extremes.&lt;ref name=Haslam2012/&gt;

{{Islam by country}}
According to 2007 statistics released by the [[U.S. Department of State]] concerning '''[[Islam]] in Nicaragua''', there are approximately 1,200 to 1,500 Muslims, mostly [[Sunnis]] who are [[resident aliens]] or [[naturalized|naturalized citizens]] from [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Libya]], and [[Iran]] or natural-born Nicaraguan citizens born to both of the two groups. The Islamic Cultural Center in [[Managua]] serves as the primary ''[[salaat]]'' (prayer) center for Muslims in the city, with approximately 320 men attending on a regular basis. Muslims from [[Granada]], [[Masaya]], [[Le√≥n, Nicaragua|Leon]], and [[Chinandega]] also travel to the Managua center for Friday prayers. Granada, Masaya, and Leon have smaller prayer centers in the homes of prominent local Muslims. In May 2007 the Sunni leader of the Managua prayer center was dismissed, due to the increase in Iranian influence in the Muslim community and was to be replaced by a [[Shi'a]] religious leader. By the end of the reporting period (May 2007) the Shi'a leader had not been identified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nicaragua.usembassy.gov/religious_2007.html International Religious Freedom 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724182039/http://nicaragua.usembassy.gov/religious_2007.html |date=24 July 2008 }} (Released October 2007, covers period of June 2006 to May 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Early Immigration===
Muslim immigration occurred in moderate numbers in [[Nicaragua]] in the late 19th century. The majority were [[Palestinian people|Palestinian Arab]] Muslims; the immigration constituted one of the largest waves of immigration to Central America. Although the exact number of Palestinians is not available, Guzm√°n writes ''"it is possible that from the end of the nineteenth century until 1917, when the [[Ottoman Empire]] entered its final decline, during [[World War I]], 40 Palestinian families arrived in Nicaragua"''.&lt;ref name=Guzman&gt;{{cite book | first=Roberto | last=Mar√≠n Guzm√°n | coauthors= | title=A Century of Palestinian Immigration into Central America: A Study of Their Economic and Cultural Contributions | year=2000 | publisher=Editorial Universidad de C.R. | url = | work = | pages =49‚Äì59 | language = |isbn = 9977-67-587-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This early wave of immigrants quickly lost their Islamic roots and blended into the local population, often by adopting a Christian heritage due to intermarrying and government pressure. At different points during the 1890s to the 1940s Nicaragua, and many other Latin American countries, established laws or issued ordinances that restricted the entry of [[Arabs]], forbade the stay of Arabs already present in the country and curtailed the expansion of their commercial activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Christina | last=Civantos | coauthors= | title=Between Argentines and Arabs: Argentine orientalism, Arab immigrants, and the writing of identity | year=2005 | publisher=SUNY Press | url = | work =  | isbn = 0-7914-6601-9| page =224 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigration: 1960s through 2000===
 [[File:Palestinian March in Nicaragua.jpg|thumb|right|Palestinians celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Nicaraguan revolution in Managua waving Palestine and [[Sandinista]] flags.]]
The second group of immigrants in the 1960s was better educated, but not any more oriented towards Islam than the first. This group was affected by two major events in Nicaragua: the [[1972 Nicaragua earthquake]], and the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]] in 1979. At that time, many of the former Palestinians immigrated to North America or returned to Palestine. Those that stayed suffered greatly and their families were further assimilated into Christianity. The latest and smallest group of √©migr√©s was in the early 1990s. Many of these were immigrants returning to Nicaragua who had since become more aware of their Muslim heritage from exposure in North America or Palestine. These immigrants also possessed a stronger Islamic identity than previous groups, enabling an Islamic reawakening by the community.&lt;ref&gt;''The Islamic Bulletin'', [http://www.islamicbulletin.com/newsletters/issue_16/nicaragua.aspx Islam in Nicaragua]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2000 it was estimated that there were 500 families of Palestine Arabs and Palestinian descendants in Nicaragua. The Palestinians that arrived in Nicaragua were mostly Christians and a small number of Muslims, the majority of which came from rural villages near [[Ramallah]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Beit Jala]] and [[Bethlehem]]. The total population of Palestinians in Nicaragua ranks as the largest Arab community in Central America.

===Recent developments===
According to Fahmi Hassan, President of the 'Asociaci√≥n Cultural Nicarag√ºense-Isl√°mica, the [[Muslim]] population consists primarily of Arabs who immigrated from [[Palestinian territories]] and [[Lebanon]], in addition to a number of indigenous converts.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin S√°nchez, [http://archivo.elnuevodiario.com.ni/2004/marzo/14-marzo-2004/nacional/nacional1.html ''Primer Im√°n de Nicaragua''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310212255/http://archivo.elnuevodiario.com.ni/2004/marzo/14-marzo-2004/nacional/nacional1.html |date=10 March 2007 }}. ''El Nuevo Diario''. Domingo 14 de Marzo de 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the first ''[[masjid]]'' (mosque) was constructed in the country on a parcel of land measuring three thousand meters in the [[San Juan del Sur|San Juan]] district (Ciudad Jardin) with a capacity for nearly one thousand people. The ''masjid'' provides introductory courses on Islamic doctrine, as well as a place for performance of the congregational Friday prayer (''[[Jumu'ah|Salaat al-Jummah]]'') and [[Ramadan]] activities. Although the small Muslim community initially lacked finances, they were assisted by contributions from a delegation of [[Islam in Panama|Panamanian Muslims]]. Besides its characteristic ''[[minar]]'', the liturgical office has a library, prayer room, administrative office, children's area, and a school. Religious seminars are offered for both men and women; Spanish language pamphlets are also distributed.&lt;ref&gt;Elhamalawy, Salma [http://www.islamonline.net/English/artculture/2003/10/article10.shtml ''Celebrating Ramadan from Chile to China'']. October 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, another new Islamic Center was recently inaugurated, called the ''Centro Cultural Isl√°mico Nicarag√ºense''. It is operated by a group of [[Shia Islam|Shiite Muslims]] and their main goal is the propagation of Islamic teachings. Population of Shiite Muslims existed in Nicaragua from migration of Iranian refugees escaping [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979 and escaping turmoil of [[Iran‚ÄìIraq War]] of the 1980s, the Iran‚ÄìNicaragua ties strengthened the influence of Shia Islam. Most Shi'ite Muslim Nicaraguans are of Iranian blood, they may still speak [[Persian language|Persian]] and/or other [[languages of Iran|Iranian language]], aside from Arabic and Spanish. in the 2018 protests in Managua there was little identified participation by the Muslim community

[[Islam]] is the religion of about 35.2% of the people of [[Tanzania]]. On the mainland, Muslim communities are concentrated in coastal areas, with some large Muslim majorities also in inland urban areas especially and along the former caravan routes. More than 99% of the population of the [[Zanzibar]] [[Zanzibar Archipelago|archipelago]] is [[Muslim]]. The majority of [[Muslim]]s in [[Tanzania]] are [[Sunni]] of [[Shafi]] school of [[jurisprudence]], with unusually significant [[Shia]] and [[Ahmadi]] minorities in sub-Saharan Africa. According to Pew research center, two-thirds of the [[Muslim]] population of [[Tanzania]] is [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]], while the rest is either [[Shia]] (20%) or [[Ahmadi]] (15%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Religious_Affiliation/Muslim/the-worlds-muslims-full-report.pdf | title=The World's Muslims: Unity and Diversity | accessdate=August 14, 2012 | date=August 9, 2012 | publisher=Pew Forum on Religious &amp; Public life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 105-DOA0232, Deutsch-Ostafrika, Arabische Moschee.jpg|thumb|The [[Great Mosque of Kilwa]] is one of the earliest surviving mosques in the [[African Great Lakes]].]]

The earliest concrete evidence of a [[Muslim]] presence in the [[African Great Lakes]] is the foundation of a mosque in [[Shanga, Pate Island|Shanga]] on [[Pate Island]], where gold, silver and copper coins dated from 830 were found during an excavation in the 1980s. Islam arrived to Tanzania with the [[Arab slave trade]]rs. The route from Ujiji at the shore of Lake Tanganyika to Bagamoyo, just opposite of Zanzibar on main land Tanzania was one of the main routes of Muslim slave routes according to UNESCO data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/2095/|title=The Central Slave and Ivory Trade Route - UNESCO World Heritage Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|date=|website=whc.unesco.org|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of Islam in the country can be traced to the establishment of the [[Kilwa Sultanate]] in the 10th century by [[Ali ibn al-Hassan Shirazi]],&lt;ref&gt;ÿ¥ÿßŸÉÿ± ŸÖÿµÿ∑ŸÅŸâ, ''ŸÖŸàÿ≥Ÿàÿπÿ© ÿØŸàÿßŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿπÿßŸÑŸÖ ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖŸä Ÿàÿ±ÿ¨ÿßŸÑŸáÿß ÿßŸÑÿ¨ÿ≤ÿ° ÿßŸÑÿ´ÿßŸÑÿ´'', (ÿØÿßÿ± ÿßŸÑÿπŸÑŸÖ ŸÑŸÑŸÖŸÑÿßŸäŸäŸÜ: 1993), p.1360&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Persian people|Persian]] prince of [[Shiraz]].&lt;ref&gt;James Hastings, ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics Part 24'', (Kessinger Publishing: 2003), p.847&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2282">'''Kayumarth III''' ({{lang-fa|⁄©€åŸàŸÖÿ±ÿ´}}), was the fifth ruler of the [[Paduspanid]] branch of [[Kojur]]. He was the son and successor of [[Ka'us III]]. 

==Biography==
During the reign of Kayumarth's father, Ka'us III, the latter had Kayumarth imprisoned for unknown reasons. After eighteen years, Kayumarth managed to flee from prison, and had his father poisoned. Kayumarth's uncle, [[Bisotun ibn Ashraf]], with the support of the Paduspanid noblemen, then ascended the Paduspanid throne. However, the people of [[Mazandaran]] quickly rose in revolt against him, and had him deposed in favor of Kayumarth. During Kayumarth's reign, his daughter married the [[Marashiyan]] Mir Qewam al-Din Marashi. Kayumarth died in 1555, and was succeeded by his brother [[Jahangir II]].

'''Mahatma''' ({{IPAc-en|m|…ô|Àà|h|…ëÀê|t|m|…ô|,_|-|Àà|h|√¶|t|-}}) is [[Sanskrit]] for "Great Soul"  (‡§Æ‡§π‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ ''mahƒÅtmƒÅ'': ‡§Æ‡§π‡§æ ''mahƒÅ'' (great) + ‡§Ü‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ‡§Ç or ‡§Ü‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ‡§® ''ƒÅtman'' [soul]).  It is similar in usage to the modern English term [[saint]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=MahƒÅtma |year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This [[epithet]] is commonly applied to prominent people like [[Basava|Basaveshwara]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archivepmo.nic.in/drmanmohansingh/speech-details.php?nodeid=333|title=PM's address on the occasion of release of Commemorative Coin in honour of Mahatma Basaveshwara :

It has also been historically used for a class of Jain scholars.

==Mohandas Gandhi's title "Mahatma"==
{{Main article|Mahatma Gandhi}}
According to  [[Rabindranath Tagore]] is said to have used on March 6, 1915, this title for Gandhi.&lt;ref&gt;Dutta, Krishna and Andrew Robinson, ''Rabindranath Tagore: An Anthology'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Some claim that he was called Mahatma by the residents of Gurukul Kangadi in April 1915,&lt;ref&gt;[http://inextlive.jagran.com/mahatma-gandhi-201210010040 ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§á‡§∏ ‡§§‡§∞‡§π ‡§ó‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ß‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡§π‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§¨‡§® ‡§ó‡§è, 01-Oct-2012]&lt;/ref&gt; and he in turn called the founder Munshiram a Mahatma (who later became [[Swami Shraddhananda]]). However, a document honoring him with the title "Mahatma" on Jan 21, 1915, in [[Jetpur, Navagadh|Jetpur]], Gujarat, by [[Nautamlal Bhagavanji Mehta|Nautamlal Bhagvanji Mehta]] is preserved at the National Gandhi Museum in New Delhi, India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gandhimuseum.org/site/sections/photo-section/ National Gandhi Museum, New Delhi]; [http://www.kamdartree.com/index.php?id=57&amp;stitle=Mahatma%20&amp;%20Kamdars KamdarTree.com]&lt;/ref&gt; This document remains the earliest record of the title "Mahatma" being bestowed upon Gandhi. The use of the term Mahatma in [[Jainism]] to denote a class of lay priests, has been noted since the 17th century. A Mahatma is someone who practices [[Trikaranasuddhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sankar R N|first1=Ajith|title=Ascertaining Linkages between Trikaranasuddhi and ‚ÄòTapping Spirituality as the Context of Leadership‚Äô|journal=IPE Journal of Management|date=Jul‚ÄìDec 2012|volume=1|issue=2|pages=81‚Äì105|ssrn=2212138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Theosophy}} Theosophy&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Order of the Star in the East]] --&gt;==
The word, used in a technical sense, was popularized in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] literature in the late 19th century, when Madame [[Helena Blavatsky]], one of the founders of the [[Theosophical Society]], claimed that her teachers were [[adept]]s (or Mahatmas) who reside in [[Asia]].

According to the Theosophical teachings, the Mahatmas are not disembodied beings, but highly evolved people involved in overseeing the spiritual growth of individuals and the development of civilizations. Blavatsky was the first person in modern times to claim contact with these Adepts, especially the "Masters" [[Koot Hoomi]] and [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]]. [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn]] wrote about mahƒÅtmƒÅs:&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn (1930), ‚Äì p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Masters whom Theosophy presents to us are simply high-ranking students in life's school of experience. They are members of our own evolutionary group, not visitants from the celestial spheres. They are supermen only in that they have attained knowledge of the laws of life and mastery over its forces with which we are still struggling.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In September and October 1880, Blavatsky visited [[Alfred Percy Sinnett|A. P. Sinnett]] at [[Shimla|Simla]] in northern India. Sinnett wrote ''[[The Occult World]]'' (1881) and [[Esoteric Buddhism (book)|''Esoteric Buddhism'']] (1883).

There has been a great deal of controversy concerning the existence of adepts. Blavatsky's critics have doubted the existence of her Masters.  See, for example, W. E. Coleman's "exposes".

After Blavatsky's death in 1891, numerous individuals have claimed to be in contact with her Adept Teachers. These individuals have stated that they are new "messengers" of the Masters and they have conveyed various esoteric teachings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blavatskyarchives.com/latermessengers.htm Madame Blavatsky &amp; the Latter-Day Messengers of the Masters].&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, various [[New Age]], [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]], and religious organizations refer to them as [[Ascended Master]]s, although their character and teachings are in several respects different from those described by Theosophical writers.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C. W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1929 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Christopher ed. ''New Religions: A Guide: New Religious Movements, Sects and Alternative Spiritualities'' Oxford University Press, USA 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some individuals{{who|date=August 2017}} believe that Mahatma Maitreya (also called World Teacher) will make contact with all Humanity in January 2017.

==Divine Light Mission==
The [[Divine Light Mission]] (DLM) was a [[Contemporary Sant Mat movements|Sant Mat]]-based movement begun in India in the 1930s by [[Hans Ji Maharaj]] and formally incorporated in 1960. The DLM had as many as 2,000 Mahatmas, all from India or Tibet, who taught the DLM's secret meditation techniques called "Knowledge".  The Mahatmas, called "realised souls",&lt;ref name="Price, Maeve 1979 Page 279-296"&gt;Price, Maeve (1979): The Divine Light Mission as a social organization. (1) Sociological Review, 27, Page 279-296&lt;/ref&gt; or "apostles",  also served as local leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[[Saul V. Levine|Levine, Saul V.]] in {{cite book |author=Galanter, Marc |title=Cults and New Religious Movements: A Report of the American Psychiatric Association |publisher=American Psychiatric Pub., Inc |location= |year=1989 |pages= |isbn=0-89042-212-5 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Hans Ji's death in 1966 his youngest son,  [[Prem Rawat]] (known then as Guru Maharaj Ji or Bagyogeshwar), succeeded him. The young guru appointed some new Mahatmas, including one from the United States.  In one incident, a prominent Indian Mahatma nearly beat a man to death in Detroit for throwing a pie at the guru.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Who's Who in Gurus|first=Dennis |last=Bartel|page= 55|work=Harper's|date=November 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 1980s, Prem Rawat replaced the Divine Light Mission organization with the Elan Vital and replaced the Mahatmas with initiators. The initiators did not have the revered status of the Mahatmas, and they were drawn mostly from Western followers.&lt;ref name="Price, Maeve 1979 Page 279-296"/&gt; In the 2000s, the initiators were replaced by a video in which Rawat teaches the techniques himself.

==In popular culture==
[[W. C. Fields#At Paramount|W.C. Fields]] used the pseudonym Mahatma Kane Jeeves when writing the script for ''[[The Bank Dick]]'' (1940), in a play on both the word "Mahatma" and a phrase an aristocrat might use when addressing a servant, before leaving the house: "My hat, my cane, Jeeves".

==Jain Mahatmas==
{{Further|Yati}}
[[File:MewarRamayanaP22MahatmaHirananda.jpg|thumb|Mewad Ramayana manuscript: The colophon in red: states text was written by the Mahatma Hirananda,  was commissioned by Acarya Jasvant for the  library of Maharana Jagat Singh I of Mewar. Finished on Friday 25 November 1650]]
Among the [[Jain]]s the term  Mahatma is used for class for scholars who are householders.

===Mahatma Hirananda of Mewad===
The Mewad Ramayana&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-26670449 In pictures: Stunning Ramayana manuscript goes digital, BBC, 21 March 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; described as "one of the most beautiful manuscripts in the world"&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/indiaatlse/2014/06/13/mewar-ramayana/ The Mewar Ramayana at the British Library: How the complete digital version came to be]&lt;/ref&gt; has been digitally reunited after being split between organisations in the UK and India for over 150 years, by the British Library and CSMVS Museum in Mumbai.  The colophon states that the text,  commissioned by Acarya Jasvant for the library of Maharana Jagat Singh I of Mewar, was written by the Mahatma Hirananda,   was finished on Friday 25 November 1650.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/ttp/ramayana/accessible/pages21and22.html#content  Ramayana - Pages 21 and 22 (British Library Add. MSS 15296-15297 and IO San 3621)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Mahatma Hirananda being a Jain scribe, incorporated traditional Jain scribal elements into the manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/ttp/ramayana/accessible/pages3and4.html#content  Ramayana - Pages 3 and 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jain Mahatmas in the [[Dabestan-e Mazaheb]]===
The famous [[Dabestan-e Mazaheb]] often attributed to one Mohsin Fani, written around 1655 CE. is a text written in the Mughal period that describes various religions and philosophies the author encountered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cxJgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=THE+DABIST%C3%81N,+OR+SCHOOL+OF+MANNERS&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q=THE%20DABIST%C3%81N%2C%20OR%20SCHOOL%20OF%20MANNERS&amp;f=false  The Dabist√°n: Or, School of Manners: The Religious Beliefs, Observances, Philosophic Opinions and Social Customs of the Nations of the East, Fani Muhsin, Translated by David Shea, Anthony Troyer, Publisher, M. Walter Dunne, 1901 p. 275-276]&lt;/ref&gt; Its Section 11 is dedicated to Jainism. It states: "Similar to the durvishes of both classes (Srivaras and [[Yati|Jatis]]) is a third sect, called Mah√°-√°tma; they have the dress and appearance of Jatis; only they do not pluck their hair with tweezers, but cut it. They accumulate money, cook their meal in their houses, drink cold water, and take to them a wife." The term Mahatma was thus used for priest/scholars who were not celibate. The present [[Persian language|Persian]] edition of the text by Rezazadeh Malik attributes it to the son and successor of [[Azar Kayvan]], 'Kay Khosrow Esfandiyar'.

==Criticism==
[[K. Paul Johnson]] in his books&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1994), Johnson (1995) ‚Äì p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; speculates that the "Masters" that [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky]] wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her [[mentor]]s. Aryel Sanat,&lt;ref&gt;"Aryel Sanat (Miguel Angel Sanabria) is currently Adjunct Professor in the Department of Philosophy and Religion at the American University in Washington, D.C." // [https://books.google.ru/books?id=0dHP2f_6k4YC&amp;dq=editions:jYIKHxJulMgC&amp;hl=ru&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s About author of ''The inner life of Krishnamurti'' in 1999.]&lt;/ref&gt; author of ''The inner life of Krishnamurti: private passion and perennial wisdom'', wrote that Johnson "claims in all of his books that there were no Masters at all in early [[Theosophical Society|[Theosophical Society]]] history, &amp; that [[Helena Blavatsky|[Helena Blavatsky]]] '''invented''' them (as others had claimed she had invented her travels)." Sanat wrote that Johnson "'''deliberately''' ignores the main sources of evidence for their real physical existence."&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.theos-talk.com/archives/200005/tt00087.html ''Theosophy World.'']&lt;/ref&gt; What Sanat thought these were is not made quite clear.

A '''Master of Theological Studies''' ('''M.T.S.''') is a [[graduate degree]], offered in theological seminary or graduate faculty of theology, which gives students lay training in [[theology|theological studies]].&lt;ref name="ATS"&gt;{{cite document|url=http://www.ats.edu/uploads/accrediting/documents/degree-program-standards.pdf#page=19|work=Standards of Accreditation|publisher=Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada|author=Commission on Accrediting of the Association of Theological Schools|pages=17-19|title=Basic Programs Oriented Toward General Theological Studies {{!}} Standard D. Master of Arts (MA), Master of Arts [academic discipline], Master of Theological Studies (MTS)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada]] (ATS) standards, programs require graduates to have earned an [[Higher education accreditation|accredited]] [[bachelor's degree]] or its equivalent.&lt;ref name=ATS /&gt; Programs usually require students to complete two years of full-time study or its equivalent to earn the degree.&lt;ref name=ATS /&gt; The degree can serve as preparation for entering a doctoral program in [[theology]] ([[Doctor of Theology|Th.D.]]), [[religion]] ([[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]]), or a related subject, such as education, counseling, social sciences, or humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aarweb.org/membership/stages-education|title=Different Stages of Becoming a Scholar in Religious Studies and Theology|last=Bauman|first=Whitney|date=|website=Stages of Education|publisher=American Academy of Religion|access-date=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MTS degree should not be confused with the [[Master of Sacred Theology]], or S.T.M./STM degree which is usually an additional year-long program of advanced study after the MTS or [[Master of Divinity]] (M.Div.) degree focusing on one area of special interest.&lt;ref name="ATS Standards for STM"&gt;{{cite web|title=ATS Degree Program Standards|url=http://www.ats.edu/uploads/accrediting/documents/degree-program-standards.pdf#page=43|website=The Association of Theological Schools, Commission on Accrediting|publisher=The Association of Theological Schools|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curriculum==
The M.T.S. may require the completion of a summative evaluation, which could be a thesis or other project.&lt;ref name=ATS /&gt;  The complete standards are listed in the [[Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada]] ATS Program Standards for the MTS degree.&lt;ref name=ATS /&gt;

The ATS standards specify that the bulk of courses in the MTS program be academic rather than professional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ATS Degree Program Standards|url=http://www.ats.edu/uploads/accrediting/documents/degree-program-standards.pdf#page=20|website=The Association of Theological Schools, Commission on Accrediting|publisher=The Association of Theological Schools|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medinet Madi''' is a site in the southwestern [[Faiyum]] region of [[Egypt]] with the remains of a Greco-Roman town where a [[Egyptian temple|temple]] of the cobra-goddess [[Renenutet]] (a harvest deity) was founded during the reigns of [[Amenemhat III]] and [[Amenemhat IV]] (1855‚Äì1799 BC). It was later expanded and embellished during the Greco-Roman period. In the Middle Kingdom the town was called Dja, in the Ptolemaic and Roman Periods it was called Narmuthis.

== The town ==
In the Middle Kingdom the town was called ''Dja'', but not much is known about the town in this period apart from the well preserved temple. The temple still functioned in the New Kingdom. King [[Merenptah]] placed a statue of himself into the temple. After the New Kingdom the place was abandoned. People settled here again in Ptolemaic times. The Ptolemaic town was laid out on a grid pattern and is about 1000 √ó 600 m big.&lt;ref&gt;Paolo Davoli: ''L'archaeologia urbana nel Fayoum id et√† ellenistica e romana'', Naples 1998, 223&lt;/ref&gt; The main temples are in the Western part of the town. There is a long processional way going north to South. The town never had walls. However under emperor [[Diocletian]] there was built a castrum north east of the town. The fortress (50 √ó 50 m)is square with the main entrance in the South. At each corner there was a tower.&lt;ref&gt;Bresciani, Giammarusti: ''I templi di Medinet Madi nel Fayum'', 31-39&lt;/ref&gt; Here was stationed the ''Cohors IV Numidarum''. In Byzantine Times the population moved to the southern part of the town. Several churches were erected. The town was still occupied after the Arab conquest of Egypt, but was abandoned after the ninth century.&lt;ref&gt;Edda Bresciani, Ali Radwan, Antonio Giammarusti, Hisham el-Leithy: ''Medinet Madi, Archaeological Guide'', Verona 2010, {{ISBN|9788887177893}}, 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Renenutet temple (temple A) ==
The dark sandstone inner part of the temple consists of a small papyrus-columned hall leading to a sanctuary comprising three chapels, each containing statues of deities. One column bears the name of Amenemhat III, the other with the name of Amenemhat IV. Both naming also Renenutet.&lt;ref&gt;Bresciani, Giammarusti: ''I templi di Medinet Madi nel Fayum'', 78&lt;/ref&gt; The central chapel incorporated a large statue of Renenutet, with Amenemhat III and Amenemhat IV standing on either side of her. In the inscriptions, the temple is simply called ''temple of Renenutet''. Renenutet is called ''The living Renenutet of Dja''.

[[File:MadinatMadiLeftCLeftWall.jpg|thumb|Scene on the East wall of the West chapel: Amenemhat III before Renenutet]]
The reliefs in the first hall are not well preserved, but they include a scene showing a king and the goddess Seshat, founding the temple.&lt;ref&gt;Bresciani, Giammarusti: ''I templi di Medinet Madi nel Fayum'', 80&lt;/ref&gt; Behind the entrance room there follows another one, that is also all around decorated with reliefs. On the South side there is a scene showing Amenemhat III in front of Renenutet. The latter is depicted as standing women with a snake head. Between both is shown in a much smaller scale the ''king's daughter'' [[Neferuptah]]. At the back of this room, on the North side, there are the three chapels. The first one, on the West side, is dedicated to Renenutet. She appears as the main deity at the back of the chapel. On the side walls are shown on the West side Sobek, and on the East side Renenutet.&lt;ref&gt;Bresciani, Giammarusti: ''I templi di Medinet Madi nel Fayum'', 91-95&lt;/ref&gt; The second chapel was dedicated to Renenutet and Sobek. Renenutet appears on the West wall and on the back (North) wall, standing  behind king Amenemhat III. The king is standing in front of Sobek, who also appears on the East wall in front of the same king. On the East wall appears Sobek again. The last chapel was again mainly dedicated to Renenutet. She appears on the West and on the back wall in front of Amenemhat III, while on the East wall Sobek is standing in front of a king.&lt;ref&gt;Bresciani, Giammarusti: ''I templi di Medinet Madi nel Fayum'', 96-102&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ptolemaic parts of the temple comprise a paved processional way passing through an eight-columned kiosk leading to a portico and transverse vestibule. It has been suggested that the unusually good preservation of this temple complex, excavated by a team of archaeologists from the [[University of Milan]] in the 1930s, may have been due simply to its relative seclusion.

==Temple B==
Temple B was built at the back of temple A with the main entrance facing to the North. The plan of this building is similar to that of temple A. There is an open broad courtyard at the front. There follows a hall and at the back there are three chapels. The central chapel has a niche at the back. The temple was dedicated to Isis-Thermouthis (Thermouthis is the Greek name for Renenutet). The temple's decoration is unfinished. There are some figures carved as reliefs on the temple walls. Two badly preserved figures flanking the entrance. On the leftside of the facade was carved a sitting figure, that was never finished.&lt;ref&gt;Bresciani, Giammarusti: ''I templi di Medinet Madi nel Fayum'', 159-167&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temple C==
[[File:MadinatMadiTempleCChapel.jpg|thumb|The main chapel of Temple C with the two naoi]]
Temple C was so called by the excavators. It was dedicated to the cult of two crocodile mummies. The temple complex was excavated from 1995 to 1999. The temple lies east of the Renenutet temple with the main entrance facing the latter temple complex. It dates to the Ptolemaic Period and was found well preserved. The walls are still up to four meters high. The temple proper consists of a small courtyard  with a chapel behind it. The chapel contains two naoi. In each of them was found the mummy of a crocodile. In front of the temple is a bigger courtyard and there are on both sides buildings. They were perhaps for economical use. North of the temple was excavated a vaulted chamber. The interior is divided into two parts by a stone wall. Attached to the wall there is a basin. In the basin where found more than thirty crocodile eggs. This might indicate that this vaulted room was once a nursery for crocodiles. The temple complex was in use till the Fourth century AD and then abounded. &lt;ref&gt;Edda Bresciani, Ali Radwan, Antonio Giammarusti, Hisham el-Leithy: ''Medinet Madi, Archaeological Guide'', Verona 2010, {{ISBN|9788887177893}}, 44-47&lt;/ref&gt;

==2006 excavations==
Medinet Madi is "the only intact temple still existing from the Middle Kingdom" according to [[Zahi Hawass]], a former Secretary-General of the [[Supreme Council of Antiquities]] (SCA).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070413171327/http://www.metimes.com/storyview.php?StoryID=20060407-033056-4219r Middle East Times: ''Egypt finds clue to ancient temple's secret''] April 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The temple's foundations, administrative buildings, granaries and residences were recently uncovered by an Egyptian archaeological expedition in early 2006.

==Coptic texts==
[[Coptic language|Coptic]] texts were uncovered near Medinet Maadi in 1928. Among them was the [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] Psalm-book that includes the [[Psalms of Thomas]].

'''Melchor Ferrer Dalmau''' (1888-1965) was a Spanish [[historian]] and a [[Carlist]] militant. He is known mostly as principal author of a massive, 30-volume series titled ''Historia del tradicionalismo espa√±ol'', considered fundamental work of reference for any student of Carlism. Ferrer is recognized also as "[[Journalist|periodista]]", chief editor of one national and few local [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalist]] dailies and contributor to a number of others. Politically he maintained a low profile, though periodically he was member of the party executive and during internal party strife of the early 1960s his support might have tipped the balance in favor of the progressist faction.

==Family and youth==
[[File:Collegio de Valldemia, around 1870.jpg|thumb|left|Ferrer Arman teaching, 1870]]
Ferrer counts among the oldest and most common names in [[Catalonia]]; one family lived in the town of [[Matar√≥]], where in the 14th century it was first noted when turning from "lo ferrer" to "lo Fferrer".&lt;ref&gt;Ramon Reixach i Puig, ''Els Ferrer de Matar√≥ i el realisme constitucional catal√°'', [in:] ''Fulls de Museu Arxiu de Santa Maria'' 81 (2005), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; They grew into prominence as traders and bankers in the 15th century, dubbed "primera familia de patricis de Matar√≥". Some of them held high posts in the [[Principality of Catalonia|Principality]], e.g. emerging as its general treasurers in the 16th century&lt;ref&gt;Reixach i Puig 2005, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and becoming key representatives of the emerging Catalan [[bourgeoisie]] in the 17th and 18th century. The family got very branched later on, also in the [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;''Los Ferrer de C√≥rdoba'', [in:] ''Historia y Genealog√≠a Sudamericana'' blog 15.12.14, available [http://geneasud.blogspot.com/2014/12/los-ferrer-de-cordoba.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; None of the sources consulted specifies which branch Melchor descended from and little is known about his grandfather, Antonio Ferrer, a cord manufacturer ("cordonero").&lt;ref&gt;a possibly related Pelegr√≠n Ferrer, following a spell in [[Cuba]] returned to Matar√≥ to become the first director of a newly founded [[Maristes Valldemia|Colegio de Valldemia]], Jaume Vellvehi i Alrimira, ''La Renaixenca a Matar√≥: el Collegi Valldemia'', [in:] ''Estudis Mataronins'' 23 (2006), p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

The father of Melchor, [[Antonio Ferrer Arman]] (1845?-1899),&lt;ref&gt;Vellvehi i Alrimira 2006, pp. 135-136&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1860s studied engineering in [[Barcelona]]&lt;ref&gt;and during his academic years was active in Ateneo Catalan de Clase Obrera, ''La Corona'' 09.10.63, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0026772867&amp;page=8 here]; he was later co-founder of Ateneo in Matar√≥ and became its treasurer, Francesc Enrich i Reg√°s, ''Josep Garc√≠a i Oliver, destacat promotor de cultura a Matar√≥'', [in:] ''Fulls de Museu Arxiu de Santa Maria'' 16 (1983), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870 he applied for a job at Instituto de Tarragona but failed,&lt;ref&gt;''La Gaceta Industrial'' 30.04.70, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0031388385&amp;page=14 here]&lt;/ref&gt; eventually he landed a teaching position in the Valldemia college, which at that time was already run by the [[Piarists]].&lt;ref&gt;''Documentaci√≥n fotogr√°fica'', [in:] ''Fulls de Museu Arxiu de Santa Maria'' 100 (2011), p. 46, available [http://www.raco.cat/index.php/FullsMASMM/article/viewFile/243864/357472 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Though during his youth he demonstrated some penchant for [[Liberalism in Spain|Liberal ideas]],&lt;ref&gt;as a student Ferrer Arman signed a public letter hailing secular education and aimed against schools run by religious orders, ''La Iberia'' 14.04.64, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001245420&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Third Carlist War]] he sided with the legitimists and volunteered to Carlist troops; details of his service are unknown, except that he grew to an officer and served under command of [[Rafael Tristany]].&lt;ref&gt;''El tatarabuelo carlista de Augusto Ferrer Delmau'', [in:] ''Somatemps'' service 24.05.17, available [https://somatemps.me/2017/05/24/el-tatarabuelo-carlista-de-augusto-ferrer-dalmau/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; Having returned to Matar√≥ in the mid-1880s he became first headmaster of the newly founded Escuela de Artes y Oficiales&lt;ref&gt;''Industria y Invenciones'' 10.12.86, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001462792&amp;page=7es here]&lt;/ref&gt; and remained at this post until his death,&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario-Riera'' 1898, p. 634, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0004961507&amp;page=666 here]&lt;/ref&gt; teaching mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Vellvehi i Alrimira 2006, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1890s he was also active as ingeniero municipal,&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario-Riera'' 1898, p. 631, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0004961507&amp;page=663 here]&lt;/ref&gt; land surveyor and tonnage inspector,&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario-Riera'' 1899, p. 656, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0004970926&amp;page=730 here]&lt;/ref&gt; co-founder of Associaci√≥ Art√≠stich-Arqueol√≥gica Mataronesa&lt;ref&gt;Vellvehi i Alrimira 2006, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; and author of semi-scientific works, like ''Geometria anal√≠tica'' (1898). He is counted among local Matar√≥ intellectuals who contributed to conservative Catholic [[Catalanism]] in the area, collaborating e.g. with [[Josep Puig i Cadafalch]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaume Vellvehi i Altimira, ''Aproximaci√≥ als or√≠gens del catalanisme al Maresme (1859-1902)'', [in:] ''Sessi√≥ d‚ÄôEstudis Mataronins'' 19 (2002), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrer Arman married Teresa Dalmau Gual, originating from [[Matanzas]] in Cuba;&lt;ref&gt;see Ferrer‚Äôs birth certificate, available [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Certificado_nacimiento_Melchor_Ferrer1.jpg here]&lt;/ref&gt; nothing is known about her family, apart from the fact that they were also of Catalan origin and may have had a [[Merchant vessel|Naviera]] business.&lt;ref&gt;which disappeared after the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Spanish loss of Cuba]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple had at least 4 children; Melchor was born among the youngest ones.&lt;ref&gt;Mar√≠a Rosa Ferrer Dalmau was born in 1880, compare ''La Naci√≥n'' 28.01.29, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0026260492&amp;page=12 here]&lt;/ref&gt; His older brothers, Antonio and Augusto, graduated as engineers and developed own textile and chemical businesses in Barcelona and Valencia.&lt;ref&gt;compare e.g. ''Industria Textil'' 1 (1936), available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0005000220&amp;page=21 here], or ''El Financiero'' 10.09.20, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0025435885&amp;page=6 here], or ''Bibliograf√≠a'' 1/3 (1919), available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0025596368&amp;page=23 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Melchor was first educated in the Matar√≥ Piarist college&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 13.06.65, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/1965/06/13/070.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; and then in Instituto de Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;R.S.H., ''Historia del Tradicionalismo Espa√±ol de Melchor Ferrer Dalmau'', [in:] ''Revista de Historia Militar'' 55 (1983), p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; Like his siblings he trained to become an engineer and received technical education at [[School of Engineering of Terrassa|Escuela de Ingenieros Industriales y Textiles]] in the nearby [[Terrassa]].&lt;ref&gt;Jos√© M.

In 1920 he married Paquita Rubio Garc√≠a; nothing is known about her except that she came from a military family.&lt;ref&gt;''La Epoca'' 08.01.20, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000926879&amp;page=2 here], also ''El Globo'' 14.01.20, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001468701&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; The couple remained childess, yet Melchor and his sister-in-law&lt;ref&gt;strictly speaking the sister of his sister-in-law; Melchor's older brother Augusto was married to Ana Bonet Basang√©; Elvira was her sister&lt;/ref&gt; Elvira Bonet had one son, Xavier Ferrer Bonet, a later Partido Carlista acitivist and writer.&lt;ref&gt;Josep Miralles Climent, ''Los heterodoxos de la causa'', Madrid 2001, {{ISBN|9788483742433}}, pp. 21, 132.

With his father a Carlist combatant and older brothers engaged in Carlist activities, Melchor followed suit in his youth. During academic years he joined the Barcelona section of Juventud Tradicionalista. From the onset he demonstrated interest in the realm of communication in general and newspapers in particular. Engaged in Secci√≥n de Prensa and becoming president of "sub-secci√≥n de ventas" he supported sales of Traditionalist papers beyond usual distribution channels;&lt;ref&gt;''La Bandera Regional'' 19.02.10, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000373167&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; he was also member of Junta Directiva of Secci√≥n de Propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;''La Bandera Ragional'' 10.12.10. available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000373204&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=6&amp;presentacion=pagina here],  ''La Defensa'' 26.02.11, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1095516&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; First contributing minor pieces to youth and party bulletins, in 1910 he formally entered the editorial board of ''[[:es:El Correo Catalan|El Correo Catalan]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''El Norte'' 06.12.10, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=3069368&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; an established Barcelona-based daily and a regional Carlist mouthpiece. It is not clear what his work consisted of and whether the young Ferrer published pieces of his own;&lt;ref&gt;''El Correo Catalan'' is not digitalised yet and its issues are not available for consultation online&lt;/ref&gt; he kept working for Correo until 1914.&lt;ref&gt;''La Cruz'' 08.03.19, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=3047603&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Ferrer delivered lectures at meetings of Carlist paramilitary organisation [[requet√©]]&lt;ref&gt;''Diario de Valencia'' 26.02.14, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000187347&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; he had no military experience himself when in 1914, heavily influenced by [[Charles Maurras|Maurras]] and admirer of [[L'Action Fran√ßaise]], he decided to join the French army and fight the Germans. The Republican press ridiculed him as a future field marshal,&lt;ref&gt;''El Pueblo'' 08.11.14, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000190608&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=4&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; though with no news of his whereabouts Ferrer was first feared dead in combat.&lt;ref&gt;''La Correspondencia de Valencia'' 10.12.14, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000241356&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact things turned out oddly, yet the entire episode is far from clear. According to contemporary press the pro-German stand of ''Correo''&lt;ref&gt;due to its perceived pro-German stand ''El Correo Catalan'' was not allowed to be distributed in France, ''El Correo Espa√±ol'' 16.01.15, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029773881&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; combined with anonymous denunciation&lt;ref&gt;anonymous denunciation was attributed to Esteban Rold√°n Oliart. Rold√°n defended himself in a separate piece, compare Esteban Roldan, ''Francia y los cat√≥licos espa√±oles'', Barcelona 1915, pp. 101-103, available [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k990628k/f103.item.r=%22melchor%20ferrer%22 here]. Ferrer fimself publicly remained silent on his (former?) friend; he noted merely that in 1920 Roldan moved to America, see his ''Historia del tradicionalismo espa√±ol'' vol. XXIX, Seville 1960, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; cost Ferrer arrest; presumed to be a spy, he was [[court-martialled]] in [[Lyon]] but spared a sentence ending up in [[L√©gion √©trang√®re]],&lt;ref&gt;''El Norte'' 13.01.15, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=3067321&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; the fate he accepted with resignation as result of his idealistic and perhaps childish ‚Äúchiquillada‚Äù.&lt;ref&gt;''El Correo Espa√±ol'' 10.01.15, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029773851&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Other accounts either deny the arrest episode or simply claim that Ferrer volunteered to the legion.&lt;ref&gt;''El Correo Espa√±ol'' 16.01.15, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029773881&amp;page=2 here], Rafael Gambra, ''Melchor Ferrer y la ‚ÄûHistoria del tardicionalismo'' [sic!] ''espa√±ol‚Äù'', Sevilla 1979, p. 3 [start page assumed as page 1, no original pagination]&lt;/ref&gt; This way or another, Ferrer served in the Foreign Legion in [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]]&lt;ref&gt;''Espa√±a'' 20.03.19, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0003384883&amp;page=7 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and grew to [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]]&lt;ref&gt;Mundet Gifre 1980, Gambra 1979, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; before being released in 1918.
[[File:Junta de Biarritz.jpg|thumb|Magna Junta de Biarritz, 1919]]
In late 1918 and early 1919 Ferrer spent some time in [[Paris]]; it is there he entered the entourage of the Carlist pretender [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid|Don Jaime]].&lt;ref&gt;''El Correo Espa√±ol'' 08.03.19, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029781213&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; The two found common ground, not unlikely given their shared [[francophilia]]. As a result, upon his return to Spain in the spring Ferrer was nominated director pol√≠tico of ''[[:es:El Correo Espa√±ol|El Correo Espa√±ol]]'',&lt;ref&gt;in May, see ''El Correo Espa√±ol'' 02.05.19, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029781451&amp;page=1 here], or in April, see ''La Correspondencia de Espa√±a'' 12.04.19, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=7141357&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=6&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; the Madrid daily serving as national Carlist mouthpiece; his task was to ensure loyalty of the newspaper, so far controlled by the dissenting [[Mellismo|Mellista faction]].&lt;ref&gt;''El Correo Espa√±ol'' 23.09.19, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029782164&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; As he was largely unknown beyond Catalonia&lt;ref&gt;"hasta entonces desconocido en las filas carlistas", Roman Oyarzun, ''La historia del carlismo'', Madrid 1979, p. 497&lt;/ref&gt; some Carlist heavyweights suspected dirty tricks on part of Don Jaime's secretary [[Francisco Mart√≠n Melgar y Rodr√≠guez|Melgar]] and asked for confirmation, which finally permitted Ferrer to assume his post.&lt;ref&gt;Melchor Ferrer, ''Historia del tradicionalismo espa√±ol'', vol. XXIX, Sevilla 1960, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; His mission proved successful; though Mellista defection decimated Carlist ranks, ''Correo'' maintained loyalty to the claimant. Ferrer remained in close touch with his king; he used to travel to Paris for consultations&lt;ref&gt;''La Correspondencia de Espa√±a'' 25.05.19, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=7140918&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=6&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and in late 1919 took part in the massive gathering known as Magna Junta de Biarritz,&lt;ref&gt;''La Correspondencia de Espa√±a'' 12.12.19, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=7142802&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=5&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; where he represented [[New Castile (Spain)|Castilla La Nueva]].&lt;ref&gt;Juan Mar√≠a Roma (ed.), ''Album hist√≥rico del carlismo'', Barcelona 1935, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; He also toured Spain, trying to save what was left of the crumbling Carlist organisation.&lt;ref&gt;''El Correo Espa√±ol'' 21.10.19, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029782294&amp;page=2 here], also ''El Correo Espa√±ol'' 21.12.19, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029782545&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrer's term in ''Correo'' lasted until mid-1920; it is not clear why he left the daily.&lt;ref&gt;in May 1920 Arsenio de Izaga became the new jefe of ''El Correo Espa√±ol'', ''El Correo Espa√±ol'' 27.05.20, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029783202&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dictatorship, Republic and War==

It does not seem that Ferrer left ''Correo'' because of discrepancies with his king; quite to the contrary, in the movement plagued by defections and by some considered dead he remained among most loyal individuals and a bulwark against the Mellistas.&lt;ref&gt;Gambra 1979, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; His position was confirmed when at unspecified time in the 1920s&lt;ref&gt;when featured in Carlist press in 1927, Ferrer was listed simply as "ex-director of ''El Correo Espa√±ol''" with no currently held function named, compare ''El Eco de Gerona'' 24.12.27, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=3062738&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=4&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrer became secretario pariculario ‚Äì sort of a personal secretary ‚Äì to Don Jaime himself. None of the sources consulted clarifies whether he moved to Paris when performing the new job, yet his contributions kept appearing in numerous dailies&lt;ref&gt;like ''El Correo Catal√°n'' (Barcelona), ''El Pensamiento Navarro'' (Pamplona) and ''Gil Blas'' (Santander), contributing also to minor titles like ''Diario de Villanueva i Geltru'', compare e.g. [http://xacpremsa.cultura.gencat.cat/pandora/cgi-bin/Pandora.exe?xslt=ejemplar;comarca=Garraf;publication_id=ac.garraf.vilanova.i.la.geltru.diario.de.vilanova.i.la.geltru;place=Vilanova%20i%20la%20Geltr%C3%BA;publication=Diario%20de%20Vilanova%20i%20la%20Geltr%C3%BA;day=16;month=04;year=1924;page=0002;id=0001320004;collection=premsa;url_high=premsa_pages/AC%20Garraf/Garraf/Vilanova%20i%20la%20Geltr%C3%BA/Diario%20de%20Vilanova%20i%20la%20Geltr%C3%BA/1924/192404/19240416/19240416-0002.pdf;lang=ca;archivo=AC%20Garraf;encoding=utf-8 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and periodicals,&lt;ref&gt;like ''La Bandera Regional'', ''La Trinchera'', ''La Naci√≥'', ''El Radical'', ''El Guerillero'', ''Patria'', ''Espa√±a'', ''Misi√≥n'', ''Iberia'', ''Gr√°fico Legitimista'', ''La Protesta'' and ''Reacci√≥'', R.S.H. 1980, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; including the French ones.&lt;ref&gt;allegedly Ferrer contributed also to ''L‚ÄôAction Francaise'' and ''La Croix'', see ''ABC'' 13.06.65, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/1965/06/13/070.html here]; however, a digital archive of both papers does not reveal any items signed by Ferrer, compare the ''Gallica'' service, available [http://gallica.bnf.fr/services/engine/search/sru?operation=searchRetrieve&amp;version=1.2&amp;query=%28gallica%20adj%20%22Melchor%20Ferrer%22%29&amp;suggest=0 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars suggest he might have been involved in efforts to animate the Requet√© organisation across Spain and that Ferrer might have also contributed to loose preparations to stage an eventually cancelled Carlist anti-primoderiverista coup in [[Seu d'urgell|Seu d‚ÄôUrgell]] in 1928;&lt;ref&gt;Eduardo Gonz√°lez Calleja, ''Paramilitaritzaci√≥ i viol√©ncia pol√≠tica a l‚ÄôEspanya del primer terc de segle: el requet√© tradicionalista (1900-1936)'', [in:] ''Revista de Girona'' 147 (1991), pp. 71, 76. In the late 1920s Ferrer allegedly formed part of an informal Jaimist nationwide network known as "La Protesta"; some scholars claim that he was active in the Barcelona cell, Jordi Canal, ''El carlismo'', Madrid 2000, {{ISBN|8420639478}}, p. 285. Formed mostly by the youth, the grouplets engaged in conspiracy against the regime. Its format emphasized mobilization and search for wider social basis rather than anti-primoderiverista activities, though at one point the Barcelona hotheads considered staging a coup in [[La Seu d'Urgell]], see Jos√© Carlos Clemente Mu√±oz, ''El carlismo en el novecientos espa√±ol (1876‚Äì1936)'', Madrid 1999, {{ISBN|8483741539}}, p. 74, Robert Vallverd√∫ i Mart√≠, El Carlisme Catal√† Durant La Segona Rep√∫blica Espanyola 1931-1936, Barcelona 2008, {{ISBN|9788478260805}}, p. 19. The Madrid cell was led by Francisco Carlos Melgar; other grouplets were active also in Vascongadas, Navarre and Aragon. "La Protesta" was somewhat at odds with generally passive policy of the Carlist executive; some authors claim that the Catalan leadership was aware of its activities but preferred not to intervene - Vallverd√∫ i Mart√≠ 2008, p. 19 - though not necessarily with position of the claimant; since 1926 openly opposing Primo, in his Paris residence  Don Jaime remained in touch with the Catalanist and liberal exiles, Canal 2000, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrer himself points rather to his older brother Antonio.&lt;ref&gt;Melchor Ferrer, ''Historia del tradicionalismo espa√±ol'', vol. XXIX, Sevilla 1960, pp. 177, 183-184&lt;/ref&gt; Another scholar claims that Ferrer remained the secretary of Don Jaime until the Carlist king passed away in late 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Mercedes V√°zquez de Prada, ''Auge y declive del tradicionalismo carlista (1957-1967)'', Madrid 2016, {{ISBN|9788416558407}}, p. 41, Jacek Bartyzel, ''Melchor Ferrer'', [in:] ''My≈õl Konserwatywna'' service 04.06.15, available [http://myslkonserwatywna.pl/melchor-ferrer/ here]&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1930 Ferrer assumed management of ''Diario Monta√±es'',&lt;ref&gt;''Heraldo de Madrid'' 03.11.30, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000958110&amp;page=4 here]&lt;/ref&gt; a conservative [[Santander, Spain|Santander]] daily strongly flavored with Traditionalism. Circumstances of his appointment are not known; it is neither clear how it could have been reconciled with alleged work for Don Jaime. Ferrer's term in Santander lasted almost 5 years and seems rather successful, at least in terms of mobilizing support for the cause; during the Republican period the [[Cantabria]]n Carlism enjoyed its revival. Ferrer contributed also by attending various meetings, where he used to give lectures.&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 04.02.32, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000494417&amp;page=4 here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931 he published one of his few theoretical booklets&lt;ref&gt;titled ''S√≠ntesis del programa de la Comuni√≥n Tradicionalista Espa√±ola'' (Santander, 1932)&lt;/ref&gt; and penned pieces to a Santanderine review ''Tradici√≥n''. Apart from those discussing ideological threads, some were also his first incursions into the field of history, like piece on aristocratic titles conceded by Carlist monarchs&lt;ref&gt;Melchor Ferrer, ''Titulos Nobiliarios Carlistas'', [in:] ''Tradici√≥n'' 28 (1934), pp. 89-91, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000208717&amp;interno=S&amp;presentacion=pagina&amp;posicion=27 here]&lt;/ref&gt; or a summary of party's political leadership during the previous half a century.&lt;ref&gt;Melchor Ferrer, ''La direcci√≥n pol√≠tica de la Comuni√≥n Tradicionalista desde 1876'', [in:] ''Tradici√≥n'' 37 (1934), pp. 296-302, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000208723&amp;interno=S&amp;presentacion=pagina&amp;posicion=14 here]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Ja√©n desde el mirador - Olga Berrios.jpg|thumb|[[Ja√©n, Spain|Ja√©n]] (current view)]]
In early 1935 Ferrer moved from the coast of [[Bay of Biscay|Biscay]] to [[Andalusia]], where he assumed management of the local daily ''Eco de Ja√©n''.&lt;ref&gt;''La Naci√≥n'' 14.01.35, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0026335891&amp;page=7 here]&lt;/ref&gt; A recently established newspaper, it was in fact successor to ''El Pueblo Cat√≥lico'', a Traditionalist daily issued since 1893; the latter underwent ownership changes and finally closed, to be reborn under a new name.&lt;ref&gt;Ram√≥n Reig Garc√≠a, ''La comunicaci√≥n en Andaluc√≠a: historia, estructura y nuevas tecnolog√≠as'', Sevilla 2011, {{ISBN|9788493907808}}, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; When Ferrer took over the daily was still shaped by its previous [[Integrism (Spain)|Integrist]] heritage; Ferrer brought it fully into Carlist orthodoxy and converted into a modern newspaper. Like in Santander, he supported the Carlist buildup by attending local meetings and mobilizing support.&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 17.11.35, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1935/11/17/034.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear whether Ferrer contributed to or was even aware of the Carlist anti-Republican conspiracy; one author claims the [[Spanish coup of July 1936|1936 coup]] caught him by surprise. ''Eco de Ja√©n'' operated until late July, when first its premises were ransacked and then the paper was turned into the mouthpiece of local [[Popular Front (Spain)|Frente Popular]].&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Checa Godoy, ''Prensa y partidos pol√≠ticos durante la II Rep√∫blica'', Salamanca 1989, {{ISBN|9788474815214}}, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; Having lost his job Ferrer was subject to unspecified persecution and harassment,&lt;ref&gt;Gambra 1979, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; yet he survived the [[Red Terror (Spain)|revolutionary terror]]&lt;ref&gt;during republican terror in Ja√©n popular tribunals sentenced 60 individuals to death and further 70 to lifetime incarceration in 1936 only; number of victims of extrajudicial repression is not known, Luis Garrido Gonz√°lez, ''Ja√©n y la guerra civil (1936-1939)'', [in:] ''Bolet√≠n. Instituto de Estudios Giennenses'' 198 (2008), p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; and following almost 3 years in the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican zone]] endured to see Ja√©n captured by the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]] in late March 1939.

==Early Francoism==
[[File:Anuncio del hotel.jpg|thumb|left|[[Seville]], early post-war period]]
Shortly after the Nationalist takeover of [[Ja√©n, Spain|Ja√©n]] Ferrer moved to [[Seville]]; the local Carlist daily ''[[:es:La Uni√≥n (Sevilla)|La Uni√≥n]]'' was subject to heavy censorship measures and its head [[:es:Domingo Tejera de Quesada|Domingo Tejera]] ceded management to Ferrer in hope to spare the newspaper. However, the [[Francoism|Francoist]] structures were determined not to tolerate dissenting party titles and ''La Uni√≥n'' closed on December 31, 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Cristina Barreiro Gordillo, ''El carlismo y su red de prensa en la Segunda Rep√∫blica'', Madrid 2003, {{ISBN|9788497390378}}, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrer's position went from bad to worse when he refused to join the new state party, [[Falange Espa√±ola Tradicionalista]], and its syndicate press structures; as a result, in 1941 he got his press license revoked.&lt;ref&gt;Bartyzel 2015&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear how Ferrer made a living; at unspecified time he assumed teaching duties in the local [[:es:Escuela de San Telmo|Escuela N√°utica San Telmo]] and at preparatory courses to entry exams to military academies.&lt;ref&gt;like Academia Militar General in Zaragoza, aviation academy and army academy, R.S.H. 1980, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; It is in the early 1940s that he started publishing ''Historia del tradicionalismo espa√±ol'',&lt;ref&gt;the title is currently referred to either as "Historia del tradicionalismo espa√±ol" or "Historia del Tradicionalismo Espa√±ol". The original title was fully capitalised, hence it is difficult to ascertain which orthographic version is original&lt;/ref&gt; a series which would become the source of income but which also in few years would earn him ‚Äì still fairly unknown in the Carlist realm across Spain ‚Äì enormous prestige nationwide.

Since the mid-1940s Ferrer was taking part in resumed meetings of Consejo Nacional Carlista, the National Carlist executive. The nature of his mandate is unclear, as he did not held formal posts in the party structures;&lt;ref&gt;Gambra 1979, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; it was probably related to his personal friendship with the Carlist leader [[Manuel Fal Conde]], also resident of Seville. Confronted with growing fragmentation and bewilderment among the Traditionalists Ferrer maintained total loyalty to the regent [[Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma|Don Javier]] and used his pen to fight off competing factions. His 1946 booklet ''Observaciones de un viejo carlista a unas cartas del Conde de Rodezno'' was aimed against those advancing [[Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona|Don Juan]] as a legitimate Carlist heir. The 1948 booklet ''Observaciones de un viejo carlista sobre las pretensiones de un Pr√≠ncipe al trono de Espa√±a'' was aimed against [[Carloctavismo]]; offering "a ultranza" defense of the regency in insulting style Ferrer ridiculed [[Archduke Karl Pius of Austria, Prince of Tuscany|Carlos VIII]] and the cause of "farsa carloenchufista que encubre un carlofascismo de ocasi√≥n".&lt;ref&gt;Francisco de las Heras y Borrero, ''Un pretendiente desconocido. Carlos de Habsburgo. El otro candidato de Franco'', Madrid 2004, {{ISBN|8497725565}}, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Confronted with apparent stabilization of the regime in 1949 Ferrer advocated change of the Carlist strategy; instead of courting potentially rebellious generals he suggested popular mobilization.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Martorell P√©rez, ''La continuidad ideol√≥gica del carlismo tras la Guerra Civil'' [PhD thesis in Historia Contemporanea, Universidad Nacional de Educaci√≥n a Distancia], Valencia 2009, p. 328&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not clear whether uncompromising position of Ferrer from the onset encompassed also suggestions to replace the regency with personal Don Javier's claim to the throne; this stand prevailed among the Carlist executive in the early 1950s and Ferrer remained in line. He co-worked to prepare documents, made public during the Eucharistic Congress in Barcelona in 1952, which acknowledged Don Javier as a legitimist monarch.&lt;ref&gt;C√©sar Alcal√°, ''D. Mauricio de Sivatte. Una biograf√≠a pol√≠tica (1901-1980)'', Barcelona 2001, {{ISBN|8493109797}}, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; Unwavering loyalty to the Borb√≥n-Parmas, which was already becoming sort of Ferrer's trademark, was further demonstrated in a booklet released in 1955; anonymous though generally attributed to Ferrer, it was distributed by the Carlist academic youth mostly in [[Madrid]]. Designed as response to earlier Franco's meeting with Don Juan and increasing prospects of [[Alfonsism|Alfonsists]] restoration,&lt;ref&gt;also as response to abusive public Franco‚Äôs comments, which reduced Carlism to a bunch of offshoots following a foreign prince, almost traitors&lt;/ref&gt; the booklet denounced such a possibility as treason to the spirit of July 1936, allegedly shaped by a pact between the Carlists and the military.&lt;ref&gt;Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 377, Javier Lavard√≠n, ''Historia del ultimo pretendiente a la corona de Espa√±a'', Paris 1976, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferrer was very uneasy about 1955 Fal's dismissal from political leadership and pro-collaborationist turn of the party.&lt;ref&gt;Mercedes V√°zquez de Prada, ''El nuevo rumbo pol√≠tico del carlismo hacia la colaboraci√≥n con el r√©gimen (1955-56)'', [in:] ''Hispania'' 69 (2009), p. 190, V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; During a 1956 meeting of the executive&lt;ref&gt;Lavardin 1976, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; he warned about a forthcoming Franco-Juanista maneuver dubbed "Plan Artajo",&lt;ref&gt;V√°zquez de Prada 2009, p. 192, V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; yet he remained totally loyal to his king, to the new strategy he sponsored and to the new party leader, [[Jos√© Mar√≠a Valiente Soriano|Jos√© Mar√≠a Valiente]]; he remained on fairly good terms with the latter.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. friendly if not intimate letters exchanged between Valiente and Ferrer, V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1950s Ferrer's historiographic production assumed already massive scope and earned him enormous prestige in the party ranks. It was reflected by his continuous presence at executive sessions; in 1960 he was even entrusted with writing sort of a rulebook for organization of Consejo Nacional sittings.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, ''El naufragio de las ortodoxias. El carlismo 1962-1977'', Pamplona 1997, {{ISBN|8431315644}}, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961 he entered a newly formed Comisi√≥n de Cultura; as censorship eased, he contributed to Comisi√≥n's mouthpiece ''Reconquista'',&lt;ref&gt;V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; bulletins of Circulos V√°zquez de Mella and other new periodicals like ''[[Montejurra (magazine)|Montejurra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;also ''Informaciones'', ''Cristiandad'' and ''Siempre'', R.S.H. 1980, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the early 1960s Ferrer's actual impact on Carlist politics remained marginal;&lt;ref&gt;Ferrer "nunca se habia metido en pol√≠tica", V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; his position was rather this of a patriarch, scarcely involved in day-to-day business. This changed when discrepancies between the old Traditionalist guard and the unorthodox Carlist youth became visible. Ferrer tended to side with the latter, guided not that much by their theoretical innovations but rather by their absolute and unconditional loyalty to the Borb√≥n-Parmas. In 1961 he opposed attempts to set up a board co-ordinating Carlist propaganda,&lt;ref&gt;it might be interesting to note that back in 1935 Ferrer supported co-ordination of Carlist print activities, Francisco Javier Capistegui, ''Parad√≥jicos reaccionarios: la modernidad contra la Rep√∫blica de la Comuni√≥n Tradicionalista'', [in :] ''Argonauta Espa√±ol'' 9 (2012), available [https://argonauta.revues.org/1409 here]&lt;/ref&gt; put forward by orthodoxes concerned with new tones advanced by periodicals like ''Azada y Asta''.&lt;ref&gt;V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrer remained also on excellent terms with leader of the youth, Don Javier's oldest son [[Carlos Hugo, Duke of Parma|Don Carlos Hugo]],&lt;ref&gt;Ferrer was "muy vinculado a Carlos Hugo e Irene", Lavardin 1976, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; though initially he was perplexed by the bachelor status of the prince.&lt;ref&gt;conscious of dynastical problems caused resulting from Jaime III‚Äôs lack of offspring, in 1961 Ferrer urged Junta Nacional to formally raise the issue with Don Carlos Hugo, V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 145, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; When the Traditionalists, led by [[Jos√© Luis Zamanillo Gonz√°lez-Camino|Jos√© Luis Zamanillo]], started to mount an opposition strategy against the Hugocarlistas, Ferrer did not hesitate to confront them. In 1962 he accused Zamanillo ‚Äì due to his requet√© past enormously respected in the party ranks ‚Äì of inactivity.&lt;ref&gt;Lavardin 1976, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Charles-Hugues de Bourbon-Parme.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Carlos Hugo]] (1964)]]
In 1963 the showdown between Zamanillo-led Traditionalists and [[Ram√≥n Mass√≥ Tarruella|Mass√≥]]-led Hugocarlistas was already in full swing. Ferrer threw his authority behind the latter and released a memorandum,&lt;ref&gt;titled ''Breves consideraciones a una posici√≥n inadecuada adoptada por carlistas disidentes del dieciocho de julio''&lt;/ref&gt; charging Zamanillo and the review ''Siempre'' with mounting a pro-Juanista plot. Dubbing himself "the bellboy of Carlism" Ferrer noted he was happy to keep the door open for Zamanillo to leave,&lt;ref&gt;Lavardin 1976, pp. 148-149&lt;/ref&gt; in aggressive and mocking tone lambasting also other dissidents like [[Maurici de Sivatte i de Bobadilla|Sivatte]] or [[Jes√∫s Cora y Lira|Cora]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. he ridiculed [[Maurici de Sivatte i de Bobadilla|Mauricio de Sivatte]] as "Su Alteza Real Don Mauricio" and mocked [[Jes√∫s Cora y Lira]] as "inventor de pretendientes m√°s conocido pos Su Excellencia Don Jes√∫s", dubbing both "pseudocarlistas". Some of those approached -  like del Mazo - backtracked, but some ‚Äì like [[Francisco El√≠as de Tejada y Sp√≠nola|El√≠as de Tejada]] - fought back, lambasting Ferrer‚Äôs paper as "chabacanas majader√≠as", Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, pp. 183-184&lt;/ref&gt; His stand might have tipped the balance; Zamanillo was expulsed and control of the party slipped to the Hugocarlistas.&lt;ref&gt;V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; Last years of Ferrer's life are marked by attempts to reinforce the position of Don Carlos Hugo. In 1964 he fathered a booklet intended to demonstrate the rights of Borb√≥n-Parmas to Spanish citizenship, a document the prince had in hand when talking to [[Francisco Franco|Franco]].&lt;ref&gt;V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 224; the document was partially based on legal opinions gathered earlier, Lavardin 1976, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; Then he drafted analysis advancing their right to the Spanish throne;&lt;ref&gt;V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; it was used during a grand Carlist gathering in 1965 in [[Attnang-Puchheim|Puchheim]], where Don Javier confirmed his royal claim.&lt;ref&gt;Lavardin 1976, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrer himself was already unable to attend;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Jes√∫s Garc√≠a Riol, ''La resistencia tradicionalista a la renovaci√≥n ideol√≥gica del carlismo (1965-1973)'' [PhD thesis UNED], Madrid 2015, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; he was rewarded by Orden de la Legitimidad Proscrita, a high Carlist honor awarded by the claimants.&lt;ref&gt;Jos√© Carlos Clemente, ''El Carlismo en la Espa√±a de Franco: Bases Documentales 1936-1977'', Madrid 1994, {{ISBN|9788424506704}}, p. 45, R.S.H. 1980, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historian==
[[File:Domingo Tejera de Quesada.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[:es:Domingo Tejera de Quesada|Domingo Tejera]]]]
Ferrer was educated to be an [[engineer]] and his professional career is usually described as this of a periodista,&lt;ref&gt;Gambra 1979, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; though perhaps not a very successful one.&lt;ref&gt;Gambra 1979, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; He demonstrated no particular interest in history until in the mid-1930s he penned a few articles discussing the Carlist past,&lt;ref&gt;Melchor Ferrer, ''Titulos Nobiliarios Carlistas'', [in:] ''Tradici√≥n'' 28 (1934), pp. 89-91&lt;/ref&gt; especially ''La direcci√≥n pol√≠tica de la Comuni√≥n Tradicionalista desde 1876''.&lt;ref&gt;Melchor Ferrer, ''La direcci√≥n pol√≠tica de la Comuni√≥n Tradicionalista desde 1876'', [in:] ''Tradici√≥n'' 37 (1934), pp. 296-302&lt;/ref&gt; According to some authors already during his idle years in Ja√©n of the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] he started gathering materials for a general history of Carlism.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 2000, p. 408&lt;/ref&gt; According to others he acted on suggestion of Fal Conde, who in 1939 proposed that in order to maintain Carlist identity in wake of political amalgamation into one Francoist state party, a general history of Carlism was badly needed.&lt;ref&gt;Mundet Gifre 1980, Gambra 1979, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; One more group of scholars claim that Ferrer and his collaborators commenced their work to counter ''Historia de la guerra civil y de los partidos liberal y carlista'' by [[:es:Antonio Pirala|Antonio Pirala Criado]], a 19th-century study which until 1939 was the only work serving as the overall history of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Jos√© Ram√≥n Barreiro Fern√°ndez, ''O liberalismo nos seus contextos: un estado da cuesti√≥n'', Santiago de Compostela 2008, {{ISBN|9788497509190}}, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939 a former Carlist militant [[Rom√°n Oyarzun Oyarzun|Roman Oyarzun]] published the first concise historiographic account of Carlism, ''Historia del Carlismo'', yet his work was greeted with mixed feelings among the Carlists. Many considered Oyarzun's book an unorthodox attempt and were near to dismissing it altogether,&lt;ref&gt;Lopezarra [Francisco L√≥pez Sanz] following a spate of criticism concluded that at least Oyarzun "made an effort and his intention was good", quoted after Oyarzun 1944, p. 502, compare also his polemics with Traditionalist critics in the section ''Autocr√≠tica y cr√≠tica de los cr√≠ticos'', Oyarzun 1944&lt;/ref&gt; still calling for sort of an "official" Carlist history.

In 1941 Ferrer and two other Seville-based authors, Jos√© F. Acedo Castilla and Domingo Tejera de Quesada, published in the local Editorial Cat√≥lica Espa√±ola&lt;ref&gt;all series except volumes XII-XIII was issued by a Sevilla publishing house Editorial Cat√≥lica Espa√±ola&lt;/ref&gt; the first volume of ''Historia del tradicionalismo espa√±ol'', intended as a general, in-depth history of Carlism. The team kept working on further volumes, though contribution of each of its members is difficult to gauge;&lt;ref&gt;in many brief references the whole series is attributed to Ferrer only, see. e.g. Mark Lawrence, ''Spain's First Carlist War, 1833-40'', London 2014, {{ISBN|9781137401755}}, p. 17. Some highligt Ferrer and refer to Tejera and Acedo as "his collaborators", see e.g. A. J. P. Taylor, ''Oxford History of Modern Europe: The Struggle for Mastery in Europe 1845-1918'', London 1966, p. 702&lt;/ref&gt; Tejera passed away in 1944 yet all 11 volumes published until 1949 were attributed to all three authors. As Acedo left orthodox Carlism, starting volume XII Ferrer was named as the sole author. He managed to keep momentum and there were 18 volumes published in 15 years until 1956; during the following 5 years Ferrer completed subsequent 11 volumes, in 1960 releasing volume XXIX and bringing the narrative to the year of 1931.
[[File:Flag of Cross of Burgundy.svg|thumbnail|Carlist standard]]
Ferrer kept working on consecutive volumes, yet he did not live to see them released.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrer was also planning to publish encyclopaedia of Carlism and the volume of material gathered is described as enormous, Canal 2000, p. 408. According to some, ''Diccionario hist√≥rico del carlismo'' by Josep Carles Clemente was a work which "ha realizado el proyecto que en su d√≠a inici√≥ Melchor Ferrer", see opinion of Manuel Martorell Perez at ''Pamiela'' publishing house website, available [http://www.pamiela.com/es/ensayo/ensayo-y-testimonio/diccionario-historico-del-carlismo-detail here]. He left also a few manuscripts: ''Musa carlista: El tema carlista en la poesia, El pensamiento pol√≠tico del Conde de Montemol√≠n, Un pensador olvidado: Fray Magin Ferrer'' and ''Los bonos del Tesoro y las emisiones carlistas de deuda'', Gambra 1979, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; According to one author, the delay was caused by problems with censorship;&lt;ref&gt;Gambra 1979, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; eventually volume XXX, covering the period of 1931-1936, was edited posthumously by Enrique Rold√°n Gonz√°lez and released in 1979, attributed to Ferrer only.&lt;ref&gt;Cain Som√© Laserna, ''El carlismo andaluz: estado de la cuesti√≥n'', [in:] Alejandra Ibarra Aguirregabiria (ed.), ''No es pa√≠s para jovenes'', Madrid 2012, {{ISBN|9788498606362}}, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In total ''Historia del tradicionalismo espa√±ol'' amounts to around 9,300 pages; each volume includes some 50-150 pages of documental appendices and a bibliography. The series clearly focuses on military history; the [[First Carlist War]] is covered in 15 volumes and the Third Carlist War is treated in 4 volumes, while 32 years in-between both conflicts deserved just 5 volumes; 33 years of 1876-1909 are discussed in just 1 volume and 22 years of 1909-1931 in another.&lt;ref&gt;I (1941): ''El pensamiento espa√±ol desde los tiempos de San Isidro hasta la sublevaci√≥n mas√≥nica de 1820''; II (1941): ''El precarlismo.

==Theorist==
[[File:Charles Maurras - avant 1922.jpg|thumb|160px|left|[[Charles Maurras]]]]
Compared to Ferrer's massive historiographic production his theoretical works seem minor and scarce; they amount to two booklets, ''S√≠ntesis del programa de la Comuni√≥n Tradicionalista Espa√±ola'' (1931) and ''Bases de la Representaci√≥n'' (1942), apart from a handful of analytical articles scattered across Carlist periodicals of the 1930s and tens of contributions to daily press, especially those formatted as editorials to ''El Correo Espa√±ol''. They demonstrate that Ferrer nurtured a penchant for political theory, yet in [[Traditionalism (Spain)|history of Traditionalist thought]] he merits attention as perhaps the most eminent case of a Carlist thinker influenced by [[integral nationalism]]; the impact of L'Action Fran√ßaise is especially evident in Ferrer's earlier writings.

From his youth Ferrer remained impressed by writings of Charles Maurras; his decision to join the French army in 1914 is at times attributed to Ferrer's admiration for the Frenchman and his concepts. In general terms they prompted Ferrer to advocate renewal of Carlism; unlike many, he totally disregarded [[Juan V√°zquez de Mella|V√°zquez de Mella]] and considered Traditionalism of the 1920s&lt;ref&gt;though some scholars see V√°zquez de Mella as one of the giants of Traditionalism and locate his most mature writings in the 1920s, at that time Ferrer was painfully aware of what he perceived a general crisis of Traditionalism, "en un momento en que el carlismo se hallaba en horas bajas, intelectual y pol√≠ticamente hablando, hasta la reemergencia en tiempos de la II Rep√∫blica, pod√≠a verse con envidia el bullicioso mundo intelectual que la Acci√≥n francesa hab√≠a logrado articular en su torno", Miguel Ayuso, ''Una visi√≥n espa√±ola de la Accion Francesa'', [in:] ''Anales de la Fundaci√≥n Francisco El√≠as de Tejada'' 16 (2010), p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; stuck in Romanticism, old esthetics and 19-th century schemes.&lt;ref&gt;compare Melchor Ferrer, ''El valor positivo del tradicionalismo espa√±ol'', [in:] ''Espa√±a'' 20.03.19, p. 7, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0003384883&amp;page=7 here]&lt;/ref&gt; His intention was to blend Traditionalism and modernity.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrer 1919, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Ferrer tried to re-define the role of nation and state in the Carlist theoretical framework. Both concepts were usually neglected if not mistrusted by Carlist thinkers;&lt;ref&gt;However, others used the terms extensively in Carlist doctrine, see [[Jaime del Burgo Torres]], ''Ideario Comuni√≥n Tradicionalista Carlista'', (1937), available [https://carlismo.es/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Ideario-CTC-1979.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrer considered them crucial for modern outlook and strove to ensure their central position within the Traditionalist ideological toolset.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrer 1919, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, some scholars consider him the disciple of [[Domingo Cirici Ventall√≥]] and follower of his "espa√±olismo Catalan".&lt;ref&gt;Cirici considered Ferrer "a man with great political intuition", Maximiliano Garc√≠a Venero, ''Otro turno sore'' [sic!] ''el enemigo'', [in:] ''Hoja oficial de la provincia de Barcelona'', 29.12.41, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000223951&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of economy Ferrer acknowledged collapse of the Liberal order, challenged by social utopias on the one hand and technocratic estatismo on another; his own recip√© was "reorganizaci√≥n corporativa".&lt;ref&gt;''El Correo Espa√±ol'' 12.03.20, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029782892&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Affiche de l'action francaise de 1938.jpeg|thumb|160px|[[L'Action francaise|L'action Francaise]] poster]]
In the 1930s Ferrer followed Maurras diagnosing that France was trapped in permanent parliamentarian crisis, longing for a strong executive.&lt;ref&gt;Melchor Ferrer, ''La inquietud Europea ante la Bancarota del Liberalismo'', part I, [in:] ''Tradici√≥n'' 15.03.33, pp. 158-160, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000208695&amp;interno=S&amp;presentacion=pagina&amp;posicion=16 here]&lt;/ref&gt; He shared anti-parliamentarian stand of the [[Nazism|Nazis]] yet deplored their ethnicity-based nationalism&lt;ref&gt;according to Ferrer ‚Äúmaking the moral unity of Europe still more distant‚Äù&lt;/ref&gt; and drive for social engineering; Ferrer sympathized rather with [[Alfred Hugenberg|Hugenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferrer appreciated Hugenburg and his party for perceived support for federative system and protection of ruralism, Ferrer 1933, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; He preferred Italian Fascism, born out of fundamental opposition to the spirit of 1789, liberalism and individual rights and offering a syndical approach of concerting all social interests. However, he noted that armed with Traditionalism, Spain needed no foreign models;&lt;ref&gt;Melchor Ferrer, ''La inquietud Europea ante la Bancarota del Liberalismo'', part II, [in:] ''Tradici√≥n'' 01.04.33, pp. 179-182, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000208696&amp;interno=S&amp;presentacion=pagina&amp;posicion=13 here]&lt;/ref&gt; some see it as Ferrer's refusal to accept "f√≠sica social" of Comtean positivism, forming the basics of Maurras‚Äô integral nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Gambra 1979, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Admirer of L'Action Fran√ßaise, Ferrer despised its Spanish copy, [[Acci√≥n Espa√±ola]], and charged Carlists involved in the project, especially [[Victor Pradera Larumbe|Pradera]], with "tradicionalismo de corto alcance".&lt;ref&gt;Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 359. Ferrer developed general disregard for Pradera; in a 1952 letter to Fal he listed many offshoots as Carlist theorists, like Aparisi, Candido Nocedal, Ram√≥n Nocedal and Vazquez de Mella, but did not mention Pradera, Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 401&lt;/ref&gt; Disdainful towards emerging Francoism, Ferrer thought it an anti-Traditionalist regime. In opposition to the new [[Cortes Espa√±olas|Cortes]], considered born out of "origen revolucionario",&lt;ref&gt;Manuel de Santa Cruz, ''Apuntes y documentos para la historia del tradicionalismo espa√±ol'', vol. 4, Sevilla 1979, pp. 43-48&lt;/ref&gt; he specified his own vision of representation. It was to be based on regional diets, each composed of 4 separate chambers and constructed in line with local tradition.&lt;ref&gt;local Cortes in Castilla y Le√≥n, Navarra, Valencia, Arag√≥n or Catalonia and Juntas Generales in Gipuzkoa, Biscay and Alava&lt;/ref&gt; They in turn were supposed to delegate members of the national diet;.&lt;ref&gt;each local diet should be composed of 4 chambers: camara ecclesiastica (specified religious men), c√°mara senatorial (specified nobles and aristocracy), c√°mara real (municipalities, aldeas, other) and c√°mara popular (all legally recognised organisations)&lt;/ref&gt; its authority was to be limited to supra-regional issues like foreign affairs, army or money.&lt;ref&gt;Santa Cruz 1979, pp. 43-48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
[[File:Urval av de bocker som har vunnit Nordiska radets litteraturpris under de 50 ar som priset funnits (3).jpg|left|thumb]]
When in 1941 volume I of ''Historia'' went to print Ferrer was scarcely known beyond the realm of Catalan and Cantabrian Carlists; when in 1960 volume XXIX reached the market among the Carlists he was already the ultimate authority on the past; though there were controversies about treatment of particular episodes, the opus was accepted as sort an "official" Carlist history.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrer‚Äôs history is still featured as sort of an official Carlist history, compare, the official site of Comuni√≥n Tradicionalista, available [https://carlismo.es/melchor-ferrer-historia-del-tradicionalismo-espanol-tomos-xiii-xviii/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; Among historians the reception of his work was mixed; massive scale of Ferrer's account earned respect, but especially the back matter raised many eyebrows. A fellow Carlist [[Jaime del Burgo Torres|Jaime del Burgo]] judged harshly that Ferrer's approach to bibliography was excessively light and that he lacked sufficient source criticism;&lt;ref&gt;"quiz√° porque en ella Ferrer se mostr√≥ poco cr√≠tico y acept√≥ datos ajenos con excesiva ligereza y sin comprobaci√≥", quoted after Mundet Gifre 1980&lt;/ref&gt; a strict inspection revealed glaring errors in documents quoted and another scholar identified 64 inaccuracies on just 4 pages of one of the appendices, in 1967 delivering a damning judgement that ''Historia'' was "a work with no scientific value".&lt;ref&gt;"una obra sin ning√∫n val√≥r cient√≠fico", Josep Fontana L√°zaro, ''Una edici√≥n inadmisible: la de las memorias de hacienda de Garay, por el padre Federico Su√°rez Verdeguer'', [in:] ''Moneda y Credito'' 100-103 (1967), p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the adjective accepted almost unanimously when describing ''Historia'' is "monumental".&lt;ref&gt;"monumental historia" ‚Äì Mundet Gifre 1980, "esta obra es el monumental trabajo" ‚Äì R.S.H. 1980, p. 161, "realmente monumental" - Gambra 1979, p. 5, "monumental obra" - Rafael Quirosa-Cheyrouze y Mu√±oz, ''Cat√≥licos, mon√°rquicos y fascistas en Almer√≠a durante la Segunda Rep√∫blica'', Almeria 1998, {{ISBN|9788482401195}}, p. 49, "monumental" - Canal 2000, p. 407, "monumentalna" - Jacek Bartyzel, ''Nic bez boga, nic wbrew tradycji'', Radzymin 2015, {{ISBN|9788360748732}} [furtherly referred as Bartyzel 2015b], p. 17, "monumental Historia" - Jos√© Luis Agud√≠n Men√©ndez, ''¬øUna libertad para todos? El Siglo Futuro, La Constancia, Tradici√≥n y Pensamiento Alav√©s tras la Sanjurjada'' [working paper Universidad de Oviedo], "monumental obra" - Francisco J. Carballo, ''Recordando a V√≠ctor Pradera.

Apart from size, all other features are acknowledged in widely different terms. To some, Ferrer is "a Carlist [[Herodotus]]".&lt;ref&gt;Bartyzel 2015b, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; According to an opinion repeated also in less definite wording,&lt;ref&gt;"ignorarlo es renunciar a seguir rutas que √©l hab√≠a dejado abiertas para siempre" ‚Äì Mundet Gifre 1980, "obra de consulta obligada para cualquier investigador que trate de acercarse al estudio del carlismo" - Som√© Laserna 2012, p. 4; "the basis for any historical study of Carlism" - Boyd D.

Carlist passion is also held against Ferrer, who is offered a dubious praise of "the greatest Carlist historian"&lt;ref&gt;"m√°s grande historiador que ha tenido el carlismo, Melchor Ferrer y Dalmau", Mundet Gifre 1980&lt;/ref&gt; or "probablamente el m√°s importante de los historiadores carlistas",&lt;ref&gt;Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 401; also "‚Äûindispensable consultar, desde la vertiente carlista, la problem√°tica y din√°stica historia espa√±ola de los siglos XIX y XX" ‚Äì R.S.H. 1980, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; his work dubbed "la principal obra surgida de las filas carlistas".&lt;ref&gt;Som√© Laserna 2012, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; He is usually stigmatized as "traditionalist historian".&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy MacClancy, ''The Decline of Carlism'', Reno 2000, {{ISBN|9780874173444}}, p. 42, also "Carlist historian" - Stanley G.

'''Mary, Mediatrix of All Grace''' ({{lang-es|Mar√≠a, Mediadora de Toda-Gracia}}; {{lang-tl|Mar√≠a, Tagapamagitan ng Lahat ng Biyaya}}; {{lang-it|Maria, Mediatrice di Tutta-Grazia}}) is a [[Marian apparition]] that allegedly took place in the [[Carmelite]] Monastery of Lipa, [[Batangas]], [[Philippines]], to a former Carmelite [[postulant]], [[Teresita Castillo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Philippine folk literature: the legends |authorlink=Damiana L. Eugenio |last=Eugenio |first=Damiana L. |page=109 |year=1996 |publisher=[[University of the Philippines]] |isbn=978-971-8729-05-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The apparition is known in the Philippines for the rose petals which allegedly fell within the vicinity of the monastery; some of these bear religious images, and are held by some to be [[Miracle|miraculous]].  The  [[Roman Catholic Church]] does not approve nor endorse the alleged apparition, which was ruled as ''non-supernatural'' by the [[Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith]] in September 2015.

Initially declared "non-supernatural" after a thorough investigation by six Filipino bishops headed by Cardinal [[Rufino Santos]]  on 11 April 1951, the case was reopened in 1991 with extensive research and investigation. In a reversal of fortune, on 12 September 2015, the [[Archdiocese of Lipa|Archbishop of Lipa]] [[Ramon Arguelles|Ram√≥n Arg√ºelles]], against explicit direction from the Holy See and the Bishops' Conference of the Philippines, formally approved the apparitions, declaring them "''supernatural in character and worthy of belief."''

On 3 March 2011, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] was presented with a statue of the apparition by Bishop Guillermo Afable during the [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines]] [[Ad Limina]] visit. On 9 March 2011, a life-sized Mediatrix statue brought by Filipino bishops was publicly displayed in the general Wednesday papal audience at [[Paul VI Audience Hall|Pope Paul VI Audience Hall]]. The original image is currently enshrined at the Lipa Carmelite Monastery, Batangas, Philippines. Devotees of Mary under this title are also closely affiliated with the movement pressuring the Holy See in to declaring the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] as [[Co-Redemptrix]].

On 11 December 2015, the [[Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith]] ruled out that the  Marian apparition are definitively non-supernatural based on the coerced negative verdict of six Filipino bishops in 1951 and the alleged confirmation of the same verdict by [[Pope Pius XII]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=inq&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zulueta|first1=Lito|title=Vatican overrules Batangas bishop; declares 1948 Marian apparitions not genuine|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/229882/vatican-overrules-batangas-bishop-declares-1948-marian-apparitions-not-genuine|accessdate=6 June 2016|agency=The Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gmanews&gt;{{cite news|title=Vatican reverses ruling on Lipa Marian apparition|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/568597/news/regions/vatican-reverses-ruling-on-lipa-marian-apparition|accessdate=June 6, 2016|agency=GMA News|date=June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Archbishop of Lipa received the official copy on May 31 of final verdict. On 1 June 2016,  Archbishop Arguelles released a public statement retracting his episcopal judgment on the controversial matter, reverting to the decision issued by the [[Holy See|Vatican]].

== Name ==
The [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] as "[[Mediatrix]]" is a proposed Marian [[dogma]] that is still debated by Catholic theologians; this is sometimes further defined by the title [[Mediatrix of all graces]]. It has its origins in [[Belgium]] where devotion under this title began, and the same Marian title was consecrated by Catholic bishops in China from 1946. The title given at Lipa was "Mediatrix of All Grace," (instead of the common 'of all graces' - plural and lower case). In Lipa, it is singular and upper case, meaning - a proper noun. Sr. Teresita has confirmed that "All-Grace" refers to Jesus or God (whom we refer too, as "All Holy," "Almighty," "All Knowing").

== Description of  the Blessed Virgin Mary  ==
According to Teresita Castillo, the Virgin Mary was slightly stooped and dressed in white, with a narrow cloth belt about her waist. Her indescribably beautiful face was radiant, and her statues often show her dark hair flowing down her back underneath her white veil. Her hands are clasped on her breast, and a golden [[rosary]] hangs from her right hand. She is shown barefoot, and resting on clouds about two feet above the ground.

== The 1948 Apparitions in Carmel, Lipa ==
[[File: AMDG_5.jpg|thumb|The garden in Carmel, Lipa with the vine on which the Virgin appeared in 1948.]]
On August 18, 1948, [[Teresita Castillo]]‚Äîthen a postulant at the monastery‚Äînoticed a heavenly [[Odour of sanctity|odour]], and upon entering her room saw a beautiful Lady in white who spoke to her: "Do not fear my daughter, He who loves above all things has sent me. I come with a message‚Ä¶" The Lady asked Sister Teresita to [[Foot washing|wash and kiss the feet]] of her [[Prior]]ess, and drink the used water afterwards. The Lady said that the washing was a "sign of humility and obedience".&lt;ref name=Villongco&gt;[http://www.marianmessenger.ph/index.php/maian-feature Villongco, Raphael M., "The Roses of Grace: The Apparitions of Mary Mediatrix of All Grace in Lipa Carmel in 1948", ''Marian Messenger'']&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the account, on September 12, 1948, Castillo was in the convent garden and noticed a vine shaking without any wind blowing. She then heard a woman's voice that instructed her to visit the garden for 15 consecutive days.&lt;ref name=Villongco/&gt; The next day, September 13, Teresita came to the spot at 5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., knelt down and intended to say the [[Hail Mary]]. In the middle of the prayer, wind came, the garden vine moved, and a beautiful Lady appeared. Castillo described the Lady as having her hands clasped in prayer and holding a golden [[Rosary]] in her right hand. The Lady asked her to pray for priests and nuns.&lt;ref name=Villongco/&gt;

On September 14, rose petals began to shower within the monastery, and some of the nuns noticed rose petals outside their hallways. Again at 5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., the Lady appeared once more at the vine and said "I wish this place to be blessed tomorrow." "At what time, Mother," asked Teresita. "Anytime your Mother Prioress wants, my child. I forbid you to forget the incidents of these fifteen days." Then the Lady vanished.

The [[Prioress]], Mother [[Mary Cecilia of Jesus]], decided to consult with [[Servant of God]] [[Alfredo Obviar|Most Reverend Alfredo Obviar]], Auxiliary Bishop of Lipa and spiritual director of the nuns. The bishop instructed the Prioress to demand proof from the Lady that she is from Heaven.

Days after the first shower of rose petals, total blindness affected Castillo. Mother Mary Cecilia of Jesus then heard a woman's voice telling her to kiss the postulant's eyes so that the latter will recover her sight. In the presence of Bishop Obviar, the Prioress lifted Castillo's veil and kissed the postulant's eyes. Immediately, the girl recovered her sight, and Bishop Obviar no longer doubted the apparitions.

=== Later events ===
According to a later interview with the Prioress, Mother Mary of the Sacred Heart and Sister Mary Balthazar were ordered to burn several boxes containing leaflefts, [[novena]] booklets, rose petals, and other paraphernalia pertaining to the apparition, including Castillo's personal [[diary]]. The sisters were also ordered by the bishop to throw the image of the Virgin into a bonfire, but they instead hid it out of piety.

Castillo herself in an interview said she had met the [[Apostolic Nunciature to the Philippines|Apostolic Nuncio to the Philippines]] [[Cardinalate|Cardinal]] [[Egidio Vagnozzi]] in 1951, and told him that she had already left the monastery to seek medical treatment. Cardinal Vagnozzi strongly disapproved, called Castillo the [[Devil]], and asked her to leave his presence, even trying to shove her out the door. Castillo burst into tears and begged for his blessing, which he withheld.&lt;ref&gt;Our Lady of Mediatrix Lipa Documentary - Interviews with Teresita Castillo and the Carmelite Nuns. Videotape 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The current Archbishop of Lipa, Ram√≥n Arg√ºelles, noted that Bishop Obviar and Bishop [[Alfredo Versoza|Verzosa]], who were on the commission, were forced to leave the investigation due to their lack of jurisdiction over Lipa. In a televised interview with [[ABS-CBN]], Arg√ºelles said no documents were compiled or even reached the [[Holy See]] in 1951, causing its immediate rejection.&lt;ref&gt;Prior to 1991, there was no record of the apparitions in the archdiocesan chanceries of Manila and Batangas, and no papers were present in the Apostolic Nunciature nor were any sent to the Vatican. The only document discovered in the records was a typewritten account of the events by the late Sister Mary Alphonse.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJpTcJraN3U|title=Archbishop lifts devotion ban on miraculous Virgin Mary image|first=|last=ABS-CBN News|date=18 November 2009|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, a petition to approve the apparition began once again.

== Ecclesiastical Investigation and Canonical Approval ==
[[File:AMDG_1.JPG|thumbnail|left|Shrine of Our Lady of Carmel of Lipa]]

An initial investigation report in 1951 was signed by six Roman Catholic bishops and declared the Lipa apparitions a [[hoax]] and "non-supernatural". One bishop later recanted on his deathbed, and a second investigation was opened in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Heintz, 1995, ''A Guide to Apparitions of Our Blessed Virgin Mary'' Gabriel Press, {{ISBN|0-9645506-0-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 May 1990, then-Lipa Archbishop Mariano G. Gaviola, allowed the venerated image of Our Lady to be exposed again, after 40 years of being banned from the public. Devotion was reinkindled and devotees increase to this day.
[[File:Decree of the Archbishop Arg√ºelles.jpg|thumb|Official document condemning the apparitions as ''non-supernatural'' citing Pontifical authority from [[Pope Francis]] overruling local episcopal judgment. ]]
On 17 April 2005, Archbishop Arg√ºelles issued a circular, stating that he found no objection to the devotion under this Marian title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marymediatrixofallgrace.com/?page=carmel&amp;sub=shorthistory|title=Mary, Mediatrix of All Grace Parish|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Archdiocese of Lipa currently endorses Marian devotion to this title, which is not expressly prohibited as long as it does not counter Church doctrine. In [[Batangas]] province, local bishops often tolerate the devotion, which has drawn adherents including Filipino celebrities and politicians.

On 12 September 2015, Archbishop Arg√ºelles formally released the canonical results of the investigation launched by the archdiocese, declaring the Marian apparitions to be "supernatural in character and worthy of pious belief". At present, a postulate for [[Canonical Coronation]] is pending submission to [[Pope Francis]] for pontifical approbation.

However, in May 2016, the Sacred Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) under Cardinal Gerhard Mueller overruled the archbishop and rejected his 2012 decree declaring that the alleged Marian apparitions in Batangas in 1948 were authentic. Arguelles himself disclosed the ruling by the CDF in an archdiocesan communiqu√© on May 31. In its decree, the Congregation stated that [[Pope Pius XII]] had made a definitive confirmation in 1951 against the supposed apparitions declaring that they "were not of supernatural origin," which the local authority had no authority to overrule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/229882/vatican-overrules-batangas-bishop-declares-1948-marian-apparitions-not-genuine#ixzz4AQp1GNGE|title=Vatican overrules Batangas bishop; declares 1948 Marian apparitions not genuine|first=Lito B.

Former [[President of the Philippines]] [[Corazon Aquino]] had a close affinity with the Lipa Carmelite Monastery, which she visited often. Her later successor, President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]], was also a frequent visitor to the convent, and on the [[Feast of the Assumption]] in 2007 signed Proclamation ‚Ññ 1362, declaring every 12 September a "[[National Day]] of Prayer for Peace and Reconciliation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marymediatrixofallgrace.com/proclamation-no-1362-by-the-president-of-the-philippines/|title=Proclamation No. 1362 by the President of the Philippines|date=15 August 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in honor of the Lipa apparitions.

The current Philippine [[Ambassador]] to the [[Holy See]], [[Mercedes Arrastia Tuason]], is a devotee of the apparitions, and displays a large statue of Our Lady Mediatrix of All Grace in her consular office in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Office of the Ambassador of the Philippines to the Vatican, Pope Paul VI residence - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4uNvPfw2lk&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emma de Guzman]], purported visionary, [[stigmata|stigmatist]] and foundress of the Church-sanctioned "La Piet√†" International Prayer Group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marymediatrixofallgrace.com/cbcp-endorsement-of-the-pilgrimage/|title=CBCP Endorsement of the Pilgrimage|date=1 August 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; said that Mary had declared herself to be "the Mediatrix standing in front of the [[Kingly office of Christ|Mediator]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/66814/messages-from-mama-mary June Keithley Castro, "Messages from Mama Mary" in ''Philippine Daily Inquirer'', 16 September 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

During his visit to [[Tacloban]] on 17 January 2015, [[Pope Francis]] venerated a replica of the image at the residence of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Palo|Archbishop of Palo]].

On 1 June 2015, a replica of the image was venerated and processed in the Church of Saint Catherine adjoining the [[Church of the Nativity]] in [[Bethlehem]], and was attended by the [[Custos of the Holy Land]], [[Pierbattista Pizzaballa]], OFM.

The '''Pagans Hill Roman Temple''' was a [[Romano-British]]-style [[Temple#Roman Temples|temple]] ([[Romano-Celtic temple]]) excavated on Pagans Hill at [[Chew Stoke]] in the [[England|English]] county of [[Somerset]].

==Excavations==
The temple was on a promontory overlooking the [[River Chew]]. It was excavated by [[Philip Rahtz]] between 1949 and 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rahtz, P. |author2=Harris, L.G. |year=1958 |title=The temple well and other buildings at Pagans Hill, Chew Stoke, North Somersetshire |journal=Proceedings of the Somersetshire Archaeological and Natural History Society |pages=25-51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rahtz, P. |author2=Watts, L. |year=1991 |title=Pagans Hill revisited |journal=The Archaeological Journal |volume=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the foundations of the temple a [[Water well|well]] (17&amp;nbsp;metres deep) and several [[ditch]]es were found which contained small [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] showing occupation of the site before the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] period including [[pottery]] of [[Iron Age]] type,&lt;ref name="hucker"&gt;{{cite book |author=Hucker, Ernest |year=1997 |title=Chew Stoke recalled in old photographs |publisher=Ernest Hucker}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Roman currency|coin]] dating from c.&amp;nbsp;335‚Äì337&amp;nbsp;CE.&lt;ref name="Boon1989"&gt;{{cite journal |quotes= |last=Boon |first=George C. |year=1989 |title=A Roman sculpture rehabilitated: The Pagans Hill dog |journal=Britannia |volume=20 |pages=201‚Äì217 |doi=10.2307/526163 |jstor=526163 |publisher=Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of continuing use after the Roman period is provided by a bucket and an exotic 7th&amp;nbsp;century [[glass]] jar found in the well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Temples in Somerset and neighbouring areas |work=Archeology Data Service |last=Gelling |first=Margaret |url=http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/cbaresrep/pdf/099/09904002.pdf |accessdate=2007-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was originally thought, on its discovery in 1830, to have been a [[beacon]], for signalling between adjoining [[hill fort]]s.

==Appearance==
It was a double-[[octagon]]al temple building comprised an inner wall, which formed the ''[[cella]]'' or sanctuary, surrounded by an outer wall forming an [[ambulatory]], or covered walkway. The outer [[portico]] measures about 56¬Ω feet in diameter, the inner cellar about 32 feet across. All walls were about 3 feet thick. Along each wall were two features described by Rahtz as [[buttresses]] but were more likely to have been [[pilasters]], as their small size would render them ineffective as wall supports. [[Warwick Rodwell]] suggests that the ambulatory would have been cross-vaulted and the pilasters used as external supports for this. This would allow for a good deal of natural light to circulate the building and give an aesthetically balanced look to the structure. The ambulatory would then give the illusion of a [[labyrinth]] of side chambers running off from the central area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rodwell |first=Warwick |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Temples, Churches and Religion: Recent Research in Roman Britain |year=1980 |publisher=British Archaeological Reports |location=Chichester |isbn=0-86054-085-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site formed a large pilgrimage centre including guest houses and priest's house as well as the octagonal temple and holy well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Narrative History of the County of Somerset |work=Britannia |last=Ford |first=David Nash |url=http://www.britannia.com/history/somerset/somhist3.html |accessdate=2007-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The temple faced east and was first built in the late-3rd&amp;nbsp;century, possibly to the god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aston |first1=Michael |authorlink=Mick Aston |first2=Rob |last2=Iles |title=The archaeology of Avon |year=1987 |publisher=Avon County Council |location=Bristol |isbn=0-86063-282-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the collapse of the original building another temple was built, which again fell into ruin. The final rebuild, after about 367&amp;nbsp;CE included the addition of an internal screen. The latest dateable coin found at the site was of [[Arcadius]] (383‚Äì408). The last building collapsed in the 5th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pagans Hill temple |work=Curse tablets from Roman Britain |url=http://curses.csad.ox.ac.uk/sites/pagansHill-history.shtml | accessdate=14 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site of the temple is on the aptly named Pagans Hill, although that name is modern&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Charles Malcolm |last1=MacInnes |first2=Walter Frederick |last2=Whittard |title=Bristol and its adjoining counties |year=1973 |page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; and any link to the site in the naming of the road has been lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dunning |first=Robert |title=A History of Somerset |year=1983 |publisher=Phillimore &amp; Co. |location=Chichester |isbn=0-85033-461-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pagans Hill Dog ==

Among the artefacts found in the well approximately 15 meters west of the temple foundations, was an unusual sculpture of a dog with collar. The statue was in four sections, measured 63&amp;nbsp;cm in height overall and was made of Doulting Stone, a limestone, as still quarried today at [[Doulting Stone Quarry]].&lt;ref name="Boon1989" /&gt;

A '''peripteros''' (a peripteral building, {{lang-grc-gre|œÄŒµœÅŒØœÄœÑŒµœÅŒøœÇ}}) is a type of [[ancient Greek]] or [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] temple surrounded by a [[portico]] with columns. It is surrounded by a colonnade (''[[pteron]]'') on all four sides of the ''[[cella]]'' (''naos''), creating a four-sided arcade ([[peristasis (architecture)|peristasis]], or  [[peristyle]]). By extension, it also means simply the perimeter of a building (typically a classical temple), when that perimeter is made up of columns.&lt;ref name="ancient"/&gt; The term is frequently used of buildings in the [[Doric order]].&lt;ref name="ancient"&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Ancient Art|first=Franz von|last=Reber|authorlink=Franz von Reber|author2=Joseph Thacher Clarke|publisher=Harper &amp;amp; Brothers|year=1882|accessdate=2007-11-06|location=University of Wisconsin - Madison|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kW1GAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA419&amp;lpg=PA419&amp;dq=peripteros&amp;source=web&amp;ots=UNB2Qw5pAg&amp;sig=5CTlFV0KY7CybvTSvmgyu7vplxM#PPA419,M1
|pages=419‚Äì420}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The peripteros can be a portico, a [[kiosk]] or a [[chapel]].  If it is made up of four columns, it is a tetrastyle; of 6, hexastyle; of 8, octastyle; of 10, decastyle; and of 12, dodecastyle. If the columns are [[engaged columns|fitted into the wall]] instead of standing alone, the building is a [[pseudo-peripteros]].{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

[[File:Pinax prothesis Louvre CA255.jpg|350px|thumb|Terracotta funerary pinax, Athens, 560-550 BC]] 
In the modern study of the culture of [[ancient Greece]] and [[Magna Graecia]], a '''''pinax''''' (œÄŒØŒΩŒ±Œæ) (plural '''''pinakes''''' - œÄŒØŒΩŒ±Œ∫ŒµœÇ), meaning "board",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpi%2Fnac œÄŒØŒΩŒ±Œæ],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; is a '''votive tablet''' of painted [[wood]], or [[terracotta]], [[marble]] or [[bronze]] [[relief]] that served as a [[votive deposit|votive object]] deposited in a [[sanctuary]] or as a memorial affixed within a [[burial chamber]].&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 127&lt;/ref&gt; 
Such ''pinakes'' feature in the classical collections of most comprehensive museums.

==Other uses==
[[File:Pinax with Persephone and Hades Enthroned, 500-450 BC, Greek, Locri Epizephirii, Mannella district, Sanctuary of Persephone, terracotta - Cleveland Museum of Art - DSC08242.JPG|thumb|left|Terracotta pinax of [[Persephone]] and [[Hades]] from [[Locri]] (Museo Nazionale di [[Reggio di Calabria]])]]

To the ancient Greeks ''pinax'' seems also to have been a general term for a plate, but this is generally not followed in modern archaeological usage.  In daily life ''pinax'' might equally denote a wax-covered [[Wax tablet|writing tablet]]. In Christian contexts,  painted [[icon]]s ("images") are ''pinakes''. In the [[theatre of ancient Greece]], they were images probably usually painted on cloth, but also carved either in stone or wood, that were hung behind, and sometimes below, the stage area as scenery, or as permanent decoration.  The term [[pinacotheca]] for a picture gallery derives from such usages.

==Materials and use==
When they are recovered by archaeologists, painted wooden ''pinakes'' have usually lost all but faint traces of their painted images - the [[Pitsa panels]] being the outstanding exception.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 69-70&lt;/ref&gt; Moulded terracotta ''pinakes'' were also brightly painted.  Marble ''pinakes'' were individually carved, but terracotta ones were impressed in molds, and bronze ones might be repeatedly cast from a model from which wax and resin impressions were made, in the technique called [[lost wax casting]]. 

A few elaborate gold plaques have survived from the 7th century BC, many made in [[Rhodes]], with deity figures, especially [[Artemis]], shown in an orientalizing [[Daedalic]] style.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 33&lt;/ref&gt;

They often have two holes for a suspension cord, and are shown in [[Pottery of ancient Greece|vase-paintings]] both hanging on temple walls, and also suspended from trees in the sanctuary area.  The Roman architect [[Vitruvius]]  mentions the ''pinakes'' in the [[cella]]s of temples, and even in the possession of private persons. Such a collection was a ''pinakothek'',&lt;ref&gt;Compare ''bibliothek'', a library, which provides the designation in several modern European languages.&lt;/ref&gt; which is a modern German term for an [[art museum]], such as the [[Alte Pinakothek]] of Munich.

[[Callimachus]], the Alexandrian poet and scholar at the [[Library of Alexandria]], formed a kind of index, or "map picture" of the library's contents, which he named ''[[Pinakes]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://dc-mrg.english.ucsb.edu/conference/2002/documents/christian_jacob.html Christian Jacob, "From Alexandria to Alexandria: Scholarly Interfaces of a Universal Library" 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt; a term that continued in use in bibliographic catalogs.

==Large finds==
[[File:Plaque Penteskouphia MNB2858.jpg|thumb|Pottery kiln, Penteskouphia]] 
At [[Locri]] in southern Italy, thousands of carefully buried ''pinakes'' have been recovered, most of them from the sanctuary of [[Persephone]] or that of [[Aphrodite]].&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 127; [http://www.naplesldm.com/pinax.htm The Pinakes of Locri] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807033135/http://www.naplesldm.com/pinax.htm |date=2016-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another large group of over 1,000 pottery pinakes was found at the site of [[Penteskouphia]], just outside [[Corinth]].  These are mostly in the [[Antikensammlung Berlin]], with some in Corinth and the [[Louvre]].  As well as the usual religious scenes, some of these show depictions of potters at work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/votive-tablet Louvre, "Votive tablet"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Berlin also has a smaller group of fragments from the [[Kerameikos]] cemetery in [[Athens]], many by the painter [[Exekias]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Pinakes_by_Exekias_at_the_Antikensammlung_Berlin Commons category "Pinakes by Exekias at the Antikensammlung Berlin"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etruscan art==
In [[Etruscan art]], rather larger terracotta plaques than are typical in Greek art have been found in tombs, some forming a series that creates in effect a portable wall-painting.  Wealthy Etruscan families often had tombs with painted walls, which the Greeks did not.  The "Boccanera" tomb at the Banditaccia [[necropolis]] at [[Cerveteri]] contained five panels almost a metre high set round the wall, which are now in the [[British Museum]].  Three of them form a single scene, apparently the [[Judgement of Paris]], while the other two flanked the inside of the entrance, with [[sphinx]]es acting as [[tomb guardian]]s. They date to about 560 BC. Fragments of similar panels have been found in city centre sites, presumably from temples, elite houses and other buildings, where the subjects include scenes of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 242-243&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hecuba.jpg|thumb|''Ecuba acceca Polimestore'' (Hecuba blinds Polymestor), painted by [[Giuseppe Maria Crespi]] ([[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|Mus√©es Royaux des Beaux-Arts]], Brussels]]

'''Polydorus''' ('''Polydoros'''; {{lang-grc|Œ†ŒøŒªœçŒ¥œâœÅŒøœÇ}}) is the youngest son of [[Priam]] and [[Hecuba]] in the mythology of the [[Trojan War]]. Polydorus is an example of the fluid nature of myth, as his role and story vary significantly in different traditions and sources.

== Mythology ==

=== In the ''Iliad'' ===

In [[Homer]]'s Greek epic the ''[[Iliad]]'', Polydorus is depicted briefly as a foe to [[Achilles]]. According to this source, Polydorus was the youngest son of Priam, and thus his father would not let him fight. Achilles, however, sees him on the battlefield showing off his great speed running through the lines and spears him, ending his life. Seeing his brother Polydorus‚Äô death causes Hector to challenge Achilles.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, and Stanley Lombardo. ''Iliad''. Indianapolis: Hackett Pub., 1997:399.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In ''Hecuba'' and ''Metamorphoses'' ===

[[File:Bauer - Polydorus Polymnestor-recoloured.jpg|thumb|Engraving illustrating Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'', showing [[Polymestor]] killing Polydorus]]

In [[Euripides]]' tragedy ''[[Hecuba (play)|Hecuba]]'', the ghost of Polydorus is a character, and his death is the cause of the main conflict of the play. Polydorus‚Äô ghost presents the prologue of the play, explaining that he was sent to [[Thrace]] under the protection of King [[Polymestor]] in case Troy fell. With his son, Priam sent gold so that if Troy should fall his son could continue to support himself. Once Troy fell, however, Polymestor killed Polydorus by throwing him into the sea and stole the gold. Polydorus laments the fact that his body is adrift in the sea without the proper death rites.

Later in the play, a slave woman tells Hecuba that Polydorus‚Äô body has been found washed up on shore. Hecuba explains that she saw the murderer of Polydorus in a dream and it is Polymestor. Aided by [[Agamemnon]] and the other captive women, Hecuba proceeds to avenge her son‚Äôs murder by killing Polymestor‚Äôs sons and blinding him.&lt;ref&gt;Euripides, (Marilyn Nelson, tr.) ''Hecuba''. U Penn Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; This same story of Polydorus is the subject of an episode in [[Ovid]]‚Äôs ''[[Metamorphoses]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ovidius, Naso Publius (Alan D. Melville, tr.) ''Metamorphoses''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1986:307‚Äì12.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the ''Aeneid'' ===

In [[Vergil]]'s Roman epic the ''[[Aeneid]]'', [[Aeneas]] lands in Thrace hoping to establish a colony for his people. The land is overgrown with various plants, and as Aeneas begins to uproot a bush of Myrtle, which he sees growing on mysterious mound, so that he can protect an altar he has just made with the boughs. The branches begin to spout blood upon being uprooted. The plant begins to speak and explains that it is Polydorus - the spears that were used to kill him stuck into the ground and took root, transforming into plants. It is explained that Priam sent Polydorus to Thrace with payment to the Thracian king&lt;ref&gt;The king is assumed to be Polymestor although he is not mentioned explicitly.&lt;/ref&gt; so that he would be protected if Troy fell. When Troy did fall, the king broke his pact with the Trojans, killed Polydorus in order to ingratiate himself with Agamemnon and kept the payment.

=== In ''Fabulae'' ===

According to the tradition of [[Hyginus]]‚Äô ''Fabulae'', Priam and Hecuba entrusted Polydorus‚Äô upbringing to his sister, [[Ilione|Iliona]],&lt;ref&gt;''Ilion'' is the alternate name of Troy.&lt;/ref&gt; who was the wife of Polymestor. In order to ensure Polydorus‚Äô safety, she raised him as her own son, while she raised her and Polymestor‚Äôs true son, Deipylus, as her brother. After the fall of Troy, the Achaeans offered Polymestor Agamemnon‚Äôs daughter [[Electra]] to be his wife if he killed Polydorus. Polymestor agreed, but because of the switch that Iliona executed, he instead killed Deipylus.

As this occurred, Polydorus went to the oracle of Apollo in order to learn of his true parentage. Here he was told that his home city had been destroyed, his father killed, and his mother captured. Upon returning home, and still believing that he was the son of Polymestor and Iliona, he asked Iliona why the oracle had been wrong, at which point she tells him the truth of his ancestry. He proceeds to blind and kill Polymestor at his sister‚Äôs advice.&lt;ref&gt;[[pseudo-Apollodorus]], R. Scott Smith, Stephen Trzaskoma, and C. Julius. Hyginus.

In [[English folklore]], '''Puck''' ({{IPAc-en|p| å|k}}),  sometimes known as '''Robin Goodfellow''', is a [[Household deity|domestic]] and [[nature]] [[sprite (creature)|sprite]], [[demon]], or [[fairy]].

==Origins and comparative folklore==

===Etymology===
The [[etymology]] of ''puck'' is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Katharine Mary Briggs, ''Anatomy of Puck''. New York: Arno, 1977c1959. {{ISBN|0405100825}} {{OCLC|2876094}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern English word is attested already in [[Old English]] as ''puca'' (with a diminutive form ''pucel''). Similar words are attested later in [[Old Norse]] (''p√∫ki'', with related forms including [[Swedish language#Old Swedish|Old Swedish]] ''puke'', [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ''p√∫ki'', and [[Frisian languages|Frisian]] ''puk'') but also in the [[Celtic languages]] ([[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''pwca'', Cornish ''[[Bucca (mythological creature)|bucca]]'' and [[Irish language|Irish]] ''[[p√∫ca]]''). Most commentators think that the word was borrowed from one of these neighbouring north-west European languages into the others, but it is not certain in what direction the borrowing went, and all vectors have been proposed by scholars. The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' favoured a Scandinavian origin, but the most recent scholarly study argues for an Irish origin, on the basis that the word is widely distributed in Irish place-names, whereas ''puck''-place-names in English are rare and late in the areas showing Old Norse influence, and seem rather to radiate outwards from the south-west of England, which arguably had Irish influence during the early medieval period.&lt;ref name="Sebo"&gt;Sebo, Erin (2017). "Does OE Puca Have an Irish Origin?", ''Studia Neophilologica'' '''87'''(2): 167-175. {{doi|10.1080/00393274.2017.1314773}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[pixie]] is in origin a diminutive of ''puck''.&lt;ref name="Sebo" /&gt;

===Alternative names===

Puck may also be called "Robin Goodfellow or "[[Hobgoblin]]",&lt;ref name=Keightley&gt;Keightley, Thomas. ''[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/tfm/tfm124.htm The Fairy Mythology]'', London, H. G. Bohn, 1870&lt;/ref&gt; in which "Hob" may substitute for "Rob" or may simply refer to the "goblin of the hearth" or hob. The name ''Robin'' is [[Middle English]] in origin, deriving from [[Old French]] ''Robin'', the pet form for the name [[Robert]]. The earliest reference to "Robin Goodfellow" cited by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' is from 1531. 
[[Anthony Munday]] mentions Robin Goodfellow in his play ''The Two Italian Gentlemen'', 1584, and he appears in ''Skialtheia, or a Shadowe of Truth'' in 1598. [[William Shakespeare]] may have had access to the manuscript of [[Lewes Lewkenor]]'s translation of ''The Spanish Mandevile of Miracles, or, The Garden of Curious Flowers'' (1600) a translation of [[Antonio de Torquemada]]'s, ''Jardin Flores Curiosas''. The following passage from ''The Spanish Mandeville'' discusses the mischievous spirits:
{{quote|Luduvico: I pray you let me somewhat understand your opinion as concerning Robingoodfellowes and Hobgoblins, which are said to be so common, that there is scarcely any man but will tell you one tale or other of them, of which for my own part, I believe none, but do make reckoning that every man forgeth herein, what pleaseth him.

Antonio: Many of them without doubt are forged, and many also true, for these kinds of Spirits are more familiar and domestical than the others, and for some causes to us unknown, abide in one place, more than in another, so that some never almost depart from some particular houses, as though they were their proper mansions, making in them sundry noises, rumours, mockeries, gawdes and jests, without doing any harm at all: and though I am not myself witness thereof, yet I have heard many persons of credit affirm that they have heard them play as it were on Gyterns &amp; Jews Harps, and ring Bells, and that they answer to those that call them, and speak with certain signs, laughters and merry gestures, so that those of the house come at last to be so familiar and well acquainted with them that they fear them not at all. But in truth, as I said before, if they had free power to put in practice their malicious desire, we should find these pranks of theirs, not to be jests, but earnest indeed, tending to the destruction of both our body and soul, but as I told you before, this power of theirs is so restrained and tied, that they can pass no farther than to jests and gawdes: and if they do any harm or hurt at all, it is certain very little, as by experience we daily see.
}}

After [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]]'s successful opera ''Robert le Diable'' (1831), neo-medievalists and occultists began to apply the name ''Robin Goodfellow'' to the Devil, with appropriately extravagant imagery.

[[File:Joseph Noel Paton - Puck and Fairies, from "A Midsummer Night's Dream" - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Noel Paton]], Puck and [[fairy|Fairies]], detail from&lt;br&gt;''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.]]

If you had the knack, Puck might do minor housework for you, quick fine needlework or butter-churning, which could be undone in a moment by his knavish tricks if you displeased him.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} He may also do work for you if you leave him small gifts, such as a glass of milk or other such treats, otherwise he may do the opposite by "make[ing] the drink[beer] to bear no barm" and other such fiendish acts. Pucks are also known to be inherently lonely creatures, and often share the goal of acquiring friends.  "Those that Hob-goblin call you, and sweet Puck, / You do their work, and they shall have good luck" said one of [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[fairy|fairies]]. Shakespeare's characterization of "shrewd and knavish" Puck in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' may have revived flagging interest in Puck.&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare's sources for Puck were assembled and analysed by Winifried Schleiner (1985). "Imaginative Sources For Shakespeare's Puck" ''Shakespeare Quarterly'' '''36'''(1): 65‚Äì68. {{doi|10.2307/2870083}}. {{JSTOR|2870083}}. &lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable]]'' (1898):

{{quote |
[Robin Goodfellow is a] "drudging fiend", and merry domestic fairy, famous for mischievous pranks and practical jokes. At night-time he will sometimes do little services for the family over which he presides. The [[Scottish people|Scots]] call this domestic spirit a [[Brownie (folklore)|brownie]]; the Germans, [[Kobold]] or [[Companions of Saint Nicholas|Knecht Ruprecht]]. [[Scandinavia]]ns called it [[Tomte|Niss√´ God-dreng]]. Puck, the [[jester]] of Fairy-court, is the same.

==In English literature==

===16th century===
* Puck, referred to as Robin Goodfellow and Hobgoblin, appears as a vassal of the Fairy King [[Oberon]] in William Shakespeare's play ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', and is responsible for the mischief that occurs.

===17th century===
* As Robin Goodfellow, Puck appears in a roughly contemporaneous play, ''[[Grim the Collier of Croydon]]'' (1600). It is unknown how Shakespeare's Puck appeared on the stage; but the figure in ''Grim'' was costumed "in a suit of leather close to his body; his face and hands coloured russet-coloured, with a flail."
* An early 17th century broadside ballad, "The Mad Merry Pranks of Robin Goodfellow" describes Puck/Robin Goodfellow as the emissary of [[Oberon]], the Fairy King of the Night, inspiring night-terrors in old women but also carding their wool while they sleep, leading travellers astray, taking the shape of animals, blowing out the candles to kiss the girls in the darkness, twitching off their bedclothes, or making them fall out of bed on the cold floor, tattling secrets, and changing babes in cradles with elflings. 
* Robin Goodfellow is the main speaker in Jonson's 1612 [[masque]] ''[[Love Restored]].''
* [[John Milton]], in ''[[L'Allegro]]'' tells "how the drudging [[Goblin]] swet / To earn his cream-bowle" by threshing a week's worth of grain in a night, and then, "Basks at the fire his hairy strength." Milton's Puck is not small and sprightly, but nearer to a [[Green Man]] or a hairy [[wild man|woodwose]]. An illustration of Robin Goodfellow from 1639 represents the influence of [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] imagery giving Puck the hindquarters, [[Cloven hoof|cloven hooves]] and horns of a goat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://internetshakespeare.uvic.ca/Library/SLT/ideas/folklore.html Folklore ‚Äì Robin Goodfellow (Puck)] University of Victoria/Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===
* Robin Goodfellow appears in an 1856 speech by [[Karl Marx]]: "In the signs that bewilder the middle class, the aristocracy and the poor profits of regression, we recognize our brave friend Robin Goodfellow, the old mole that can work the earth so fast, that worthy pioneer ‚Äì the Revolution."&lt;ref name="Marx"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1856/04/14.htm |title=Speech at anniversary of the People's Paper |last=Karl |first=Marx |year=1856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
*Puck is one of the main characters in [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling's]] ''[[Puck of Pook's Hill]]'' and ''[[Rewards and Fairies]]''.
*The name ''P√∫kel-men'', an alternative name of the [[Dr√∫edain]] peoples in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', has the same derivation as the name Puck.
*Puck also appears as a main character in the "[[Iron Fey Series]]", written by [[Julie Kagawa]] along with other characters of Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream.
*Puck sexually assaults Gabbie in [[Raymond E. Feist]]'s 1988 novel ''[[Faerie Tale]]''

Of all the '''religions in [[Denmark]]''', the most prominent is [[Christianity]] in the form of the [[Evangelical Lutheran]] [[Church of Denmark]] (Dansk Folkekirke), the [[state religion]]. Hence, Denmark is not a [[secular state]] as there is a clear link between the church and the state with a  [[Minister for Ecclesiastical Affairs (Denmark)|Minister for Ecclesiastical Affairs]]. However, pockets of other major faiths can be found among the population. In January 2017, 75.9%&lt;ref name="church stats" /&gt; of the population of Denmark were registered members of the [[Church of Denmark]] ({{lang|da|Den Danske Folkekirke}}), the [[state religion|officially established]] church, which is [[Protestant]] in classification and [[Lutheran]] in orientation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/da00000_.html Denmark ‚Äì Constitution] ‚Äì Part I ‚Äì Section 4 [State Church]: "The Evangelical Lutheran Church shall be the Established Church of Denmark, and, as such, it shall be supported by the State."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The Church of Denmark is the established church (or state religion) in Denmark and Greenland; the [[Church of the Faroe Islands]] became an independent body in 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This is down 1.0% compared to the year earlier and 1.9% down compared to two years earlier.

According to the latest Eurobarometer estimates, as of 2015, 78.2% of Danish people are Christians (67.4% are Protestant, 2.0% are Orthodox and 1.3 are Catholics), 19.7% are non-religious and 2.1% are members of other religions.&lt;ref name="EB2015"/&gt;

[[Christianity]] is the predominant religion of Denmark, with three quarters of the Danish population estimated as adherents of the ''"[[Church of Denmark|Folkekirken]]"'' ("People's Church"), Denmark's national Lutheran church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.km.dk/folkekirken/statistik-og-oekonomi/kirkestatistik.html|title=Kirkestatistik|trans-title=Church Statistics|language=da|publisher=Church of Denmark Ministry|date=2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119052707/http://www.km.dk/folkekirken/statistik-og-oekonomi/kirkestatistik.html|archivedate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from Lutheranism, there is a small [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] minority, as well as small Protestant denominations such as the [[Baptist Union of Denmark]] and the [[Reformed Synod of Denmark]].

According to official statistics from January 2017, 75.9%&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.km.dk/folkekirken/kirkestatistik/folkekirkens-medlemstal/ Fler l√§mnade kyrkan i Danmark] 3.1.2015 Kyrkans tidning&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/default.asp?w=1920 Statistics Denmark] Statistikbanken.dk&lt;/ref&gt; of the population of Denmark are members of the [[Evangelical Lutheran]] [[Church of Denmark]] ({{lang|da|Den danske folkekirke}}), the country's state church since the [[Reformation in Denmark‚ÄìNorway and Holstein]], and designated "the Danish people's church" by the 1848 [[Constitution of Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;¬ß 4, "the Evangelical-Lutheran Church is the Danish people's church and is supported as such by the State" ("den evangelisk-lutherske kirke er den danske folkekirke og underst√∏ttes som s√•dan af staten")&lt;/ref&gt;

There are around 4,000 Christians who have converted from a Muslim background in the country, most of them belonging to some form of Protestantism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnstone|first1=Patrick|last2=Miller|first2=Duane|title=Believers in Christ from a Muslim Background: A Global Census|journal=IJRR|date=2015|volume=11|page=14|url=https://www.academia.edu/16338087/Believers_in_Christ_from_a_Muslim_Background_A_Global_Census|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Judaism ===
{{Main|History of the Jews in Denmark}}
{{refimprove|date=March 2013}}
A Jewish community has been present in Denmark since the seventeenth century, when the monarchs began allowing Jews to enter the country and practice their religion on an individual basis. Emancipation followed gradually and by the end of the nineteenth century most Jews were fully assimilated into Danish society. In the early decades of the twentieth century there was an influx of more secular, [[Yiddish]] speaking, [[Eastern European Jews]]. Nearly 99% of Danish Jews survived the Holocaust, in part due to the [[Rescue of the Danish Jews|actions]] of the [[Danish resistance]], and to the Swedish authorities' offer of asylum to the Danish Jews.&lt;ref&gt;"Rescue in Denmark." U.S. Holocaust Museum  https://www.ushmm.org/outreach/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007740&lt;/ref&gt;

Today there are approximately 10,000 ethnic Jews in Denmark, and three [[synagogues]] located in Copenhagen.

====Baha'i Faith====
{{Main|Bah√°'√≠ Faith in Denmark}}
The Baha'i Faith arrived in Denmark in 1925, but it did not make much impact until the arrival of American [[Bah√°'√≠ pioneering|pioneers]] in 1946. A [[National Spiritual Assembly]] was formed in 1962. In 2005, it was estimated that there were about 1,251 Baha'is in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thearda.com/QuickLists/QuickList_40b.asp Most Baha'i Nations (2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Buddhism====
{{Main|Buddhism in Denmark}}
Buddhism in Denmark was brought back from expeditions that explored the Indian subcontinent. Initial interest was mainly from intellectuals, authors, [[Buddhology|Buddhologists]] and [[Philologists]]. In 1921, [[Christian F. Melbye]] founded the first Buddhist Society in Denmark, but it was later dissolved in 1950 before his death in 1953.&lt;ref name="Borup"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avisen.dk/danske-boern-vil-vaere-buddhister_96447.aspx |title=Article on Avisen.dk ('&amp;#39;in Danish'&amp;#39;) |publisher=Avisen.dk |date= |accessdate=2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dr.dk/Tro/Temaer/Troens+r%C3%B8dder/Damch%C3%B8+Palmo/20060810133616.htm |title=DR (Danish state news-agency), article about the History of Buddhism ('&amp;#39;In Danish'&amp;#39;) |publisher=Dr.dk |date=10 August 2006 |accessdate=2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, there was a revival in interest towards Buddhism, especially [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and [[Hannah Nydahl|Hannah]] and [[Ole Nydahl]], founded the first [[Karma Kagyu]] Buddhist centers in [[Copenhagen]].&lt;ref name="Borup"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DR"/&gt; The third wave of Buddhism came in the 1980s, when refugees from [[Vietnam]], [[Sri Lanka]] and China came to Denmark.

In 2009 Aarhus University estimated that there were 20,000 practising Buddhists in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avisen.dk/danske-boern-vil-vaere-buddhister_96447.aspx |title=Danske b√∏rn vil v√¶re buddhister |publisher=Avisen.dk |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalbuddhism.org/9/borup08.htm Journal of Global Buddhism, Article by J√∏rn Borup, Department of Study of Religion at University of Aarhus, Denmark. 2008, based on research from 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216085021/http://www.globalbuddhism.org/9/borup08.htm |date=16 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neopaganism====
A [[neopagan]] religious group, [[Forn Si√∞r ‚Äî √Åsatr√∫ and Vanatr√∫ Association in Denmark]], describes itself as a revival of the [[Norse paganism]] prevalent in Denmark before Christianization. It gained state recognition in November 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Torben|last=S√∏rensen|url=http://www.fornsidr.dk/dk/17|title=Forn Si√∞r ‚Äì the Asa and Vane faith religious community in Denmark ‚Äì Forn Si√∞r|publisher=Fornsidr.dk|date=19 April 2007|accessdate=24 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327111826/http://www.fornsidr.dk/dk/17|archivedate=27 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are about 500 registered heathens (0.01% of the population) adhering to the old Norse beliefs.

In 2016, the [[Valheim Hof]] was established in Korinth.&lt;ref name=tv2 /&gt;

== Politics and government ==
Politicians in Denmark will not generally be found making use of any religious rhetoric or arguments in their declarations, and this is especially the case for government ministers, with the possible, occasional exception of the [[Church Minister (Denmark)|Minister for Ecclesiastical Affairs]] in the course of his or her duties.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Four of Denmark's prime ministers have identified themselves as atheists.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of atheists in politics and law#Denmark]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Christian Democrats (Denmark)|Christian Democrats]] is the only major political party to regularly employ religious rhetoric and arguments, and they have not been represented in the [[Folketing]] since 2001, as they have not been able to acquire the minimum 2% of the votes needed to secure a seat.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

===Danish Constitution===
{{Wikisource|Constitutional Act of Denmark, 5 June 1953}}
The [[Constitution of Denmark]] contains a number of sections related to religion.
* ¬ß4 establishes the [[Evangelical Lutheran]] [[Church of Denmark]] as the [[state church]] of Denmark.
* ¬ß6 requires the [[Monarchy of Denmark|Danish monarch]] to be a member of the state church.
* ¬ß67 grants [[freedom of religion|freedom of worship]].
* ¬ß68 states that no one is required to personally contribute to any form of religion other than his own. As state subsidies are not considered personal contributions&lt;ref&gt;Grundloven p√• let dansk, Folketinget, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; the Church of Denmark receives subsidies - according to ¬ß4 - beyond the [[church tax]] paid by the members of the church. The Church of Denmark is the only religious group to receive direct financial support from the state. Other religious groups can receive indirect support through tax deductions on contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.km.dk/folkekirken/oekonomi/statstilskud/|title=Statstilskud: Statstilskud og grundloven|trans-title=Government subsidies: Government subsidies and the Constitution|language=da|publisher=Ministry of Ecclesiastical Affairs|date=|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ¬ß70 grants [[freedom of religion]] by ensuring civil and political rights can not be revoked due to race or religious beliefs. It further states race and religious beliefs can not be used to be exempt from civil duties.
* ¬ß71 ensures no one can be imprisoned due to religious beliefs.

'''San Pascualito''' (also known as '''San Pascualito Muerte''' and '''El Rey San Pascual''') is a [[folk saint]] associated with [[Saint Paschal Baylon]] and venerated in [[Guatemala]] and the [[States of Mexico|Mexican state]] of [[Chiapas]]. He is called "King of the Graveyard."&lt;ref name="Hart 243"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; His veneration is associated with the curing of disease, and is related to the [[Latin America]]n [[Santa Muerte|cult of death]]. The tradition may be related to the worship of a [[pre-Columbian]] [[death god]].&lt;ref name="Wright 287"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; San Pascualito is represented as a [[skeleton]], sometimes caped or wearing a crown. The veneration of San Pascualito is not approved by the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

== History ==

San Pascualito derived his name from the Spanish [[friar]], [[Paschal Baylon]], who according to historian [[Francisco Antonio de Fuentes y Guzm√°n]], is said to have appeared in 1650 in a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] of an [[Maya peoples|indigenous]] Guatemalan man in San Antonio Aguacaliente (modern day [[Ciudad Vieja]]). The man was dying from an [[epidemic]] fever called ''cucumatz'' in [[Kaqchikel language|Kaqchikel]], and had received the [[last rites]] before a tall skeleton in glowing robes appeared to him in a vision.

The figure introduced himself as "Saint Paschal Baylon," although Baylon was not [[canonized]] until 1690. (He had been [[beatified]] in 1618.) He promised to [[intercession|intercede]] to end ''cucumatz'' if he were to be adopted by the community as [[patron saint]] and his image venerated. As proof of his identity, the figure predicted that the man receiving the vision would die within nine days, at which time the epidemic would also cease. When the man died within the predicted timeframe and the epidemic ended, word of the vision spread, and images of San Pascualito became popular despite formal prohibition by the [[Spanish Inquisition]].

== Veneration ==
[[File:SanPascualitoTuxtla2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The church in Tuxtla, Chiapas.]]
A chapel in [[Olintepeque, Guatemala]] is dedicated to the veneration of El Rey San Pascual. Devotees leave [[thank you note]]s, offer [[cape]]s or burn candles. The color of the candle burned signifies the nature of the request for intercession: red for love, pink for health, yellow for protection, green for business, blue for work, light blue for money, purple for help against vices, white for the protection of children, and black for revenge. A festival is celebrated annually on May 17, the [[feast day]] of Saint Paschal Baylon.&lt;ref name="Feldman 27"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Another sacred replica, represented by a seated skeleton in a wheeled cart, is kept in the Church of San Pascualito in [[Tuxtla Guti√©rrez]] in the Mexican state of Chiapas.&lt;ref name="Wright 287"/&gt;

== Literature ==

San Pascualito is represented by a character named Pascal in the novel ''El tiempo principia en Xibalb√°'' ("Time Commences in Xibalb√°") by Guatemalan author [[Luis de Li√≥n]] (Jos√© Luis de Le√≥n D√≠az).&lt;ref name="Duran-Cogan 199"&gt;

'''Searches for [[Noah's Ark]]''' have been made from at least the time of [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] (c.275‚Äì339) to the present day. Despite many expeditions, no physical proof of the ark has been reliably identified.&lt;ref name="PlanTurk" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/09/0920_040920_noahs_ark.html Noah's Ark Quest Dead in Water] ‚Äì National Geographic&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the supposed findings and methods are regarded as [[pseudoscience]] and [[pseudoarchaeology]] by geologists and archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fagan |first1=Brian M. |author1-link=Brian M.

== Conflicting opinions ==
Modern organized searches for the ark tend to originate in [[American evangelical]] circles. According to Larry Eskridge, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;An interesting phenomenon that has arisen within twentieth-century conservative American evangelism ‚Äì the widespread conviction that the ancient Ark of Noah is embedded in ice high atop Mount Ararat, waiting to be found. It is a story that has combined earnest faith with the lure of adventure, questionable evidence with startling claims. The hunt for the ark, like evangelism itself, is a complex blend of the rational and the supernatural, the modern and the premodern. While it acknowledges a debt to pure faith in a literal reading of the Scriptures and centuries of legend, the conviction that the Ark literally lies on Ararat is a recent one, backed by a largely twentieth-century canon of evidence that includes stories of shadowy eyewitnesses, tales of mysterious missing photographs, rumors of atheistic conspiracy, and pieces of questionable "ark wood" from the mountain. (...) Moreover, it skirts the domain of pop pseudoscience and the paranormal, making the attempt to find the ark the evangelical equivalent of the search for Bigfoot or the Loch Ness monster. In all these ways, it reveals much about evangelicals' distrust of mainstream science and the motivations and modus operandi of the scientific elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eskridge|first=Larry|editor=[[David N. Livingstone]]|others=[[D. G. Hart]], [[Mark A. Noll]]|title=Evangelicals and Science in Historical Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_4K720YRj88C|year=1999|publisher=Oxford UP|isbn=9780195353969|chapter=A Sign for an Unbelieving Age: Evangelicals and the Search for Noah's Ark}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ark-seeker Richard Carl Bright considers the search for the ark a religious quest, dependent on God's blessing for its success. Bright is also confident that there is a multinational government conspiracy to hide the "truth" about the ark:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I firmly believe that the governments of Turkey, Russia, and the United States know exactly where the ark sits. They suppress the information, but (...) God is in charge. The structure will be revealed in its time. We climb the mountain and search, hoping it is, in fact, God's time as we climb. Use us, O Lord, is our prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bright|first=Richard Carl|title=Quest for Discovery: One Man's Epic Search for Noah's Ark|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ovysKv1TDcUC|year=2001|publisher=New Leaf|isbn=9781614582045|chapter=Do the Locals Know?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 8:4, the Ark came to rest "on the [[mountains of Ararat]]."
Early commentators such as [[Josephus]],{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} and authorities quoted by him, [[Berossus]],{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Hieronymus the Egyptian,{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} [[Mnaseas]], and [[Nicolaus of Damascus]],{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} record the tradition that these "mountains of Ararat" are to be found in the region then known as [[Roman Armenia|Armenia]], roughly corresponding to [[Eastern Anatolia]].

Syrian tradition of the early centuries BC had a tradition of the ark landing at [[Mount Judi]], where according to Josephus the remains of the ark were still shown in the 1st century BC. The location of the "Place of Descent" (Œ±œÄŒøŒ≤Œ±œÑŒ∑œÅŒπŒøŒΩ, i.e., ''[[Nakhichivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]]'') described by Josephus was some 100&amp;nbsp;km to the southeast of the peak now known as Mount Ararat, in what is today [[Iraqi Kurdistan]].

According to Jewish Rabbinic tradition, the Ark was looted in antiquity, the remains being used for idol worship, as related in the Talmud Tractate Sanhedrin by [[Sennacherib]] circa 705 ‚Äì 681 BC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.come-and-hear.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_96.html English translation of Sanhedrin folio 96a]&lt;/ref&gt; and as related in the Midrash anthology [[Yalkut Shimoni]] by [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]] circa 486‚Äì465 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14573&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=149 ◊ô◊ú◊ß◊ï◊ò ◊©◊û◊¢◊ï◊†◊ô ◊§◊®◊©◊™ ◊ë◊©◊ú◊ó, ◊®◊û◊ñ ◊®◊†"◊ï]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marco Polo]] (1254‚Äì1324) wrote in his book, ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo]]'':
{{quote|In the heart of the Armenian mountain range, the mountain's peak is shaped like a cube (or cup), on which Noah's ark is said to have rested, whence it is called the Mountain of Noah's Ark. It [the mountain] is so broad and long that it takes more than two days to go around it. On the summit the snow lies so deep all the year round that no one can ever climb it; this snow never entirely melts, but new snow is for ever falling on the old, so that the level rises.}}

[[Sir Walter Raleigh]], writing c. 1616, made a laborious argument taking up several whole chapters of his ''History of the World'', that the term "Mountains of Ararat" originally encompassed all the adjoining and taller ranges of Asia, and that Noah's Ark could only have landed in the Orient ‚Äì especially since Armenia is not technically east of the plain of Shinar (or Mesopotamia), but more northwest.

==19th-century expeditions==
[[File:The Structure Claimed to be the Noah's Ark near the Mount Ararat in Turkey.jpg|thumb|300px|The structure claimed to be Noah's Ark at the [[Durupƒ±nar site]], Agri, Turkey]]

*In 1829, Dr. Friedrich Parrot, who had made an ascent of Greater Ararat, wrote in his ''Journey to Ararat'' that "all the [[Armenians]] are firmly persuaded that Noah's Ark remains to this very day on the top of Ararat, and that, in order to preserve it, no human being is allowed to approach it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.home.earthlink.net/~arktracker/ark/Quotes.html#Dr.%20FriedrichParrot Dr Friedrich Parrott]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1876, [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]], historian, statesman, diplomat, explorer, and Professor of Civil Law at Oxford, climbed above the tree line and found a slab of hand-hewn timber, four feet long and five inches thick, which he identified as being from the Ark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noahsarksearch.com/BryceJames/BryceJames.htm James Bryce]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883, the ''British Prophetic Messenger'' and others reported that Turkish commissioners investigating avalanches had seen the Ark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.home.earthlink.net/~arktracker/ark/Sightings.html British Prophetic Messenger and the Turkish Commissioners]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern searches (1949 to present)==
Searches since the mid-20th century have been largely supported by evangelical, [[millenarian]] churches along with local farmers and sustained by ongoing popular interest, faith-based magazines, lecture tours, videos and occasional television specials.

*In 1949, Aaron J. Smith, dean of the People's Bible College in Greensboro, NC, led an unsuccessful expedition to locate the ark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,856222,00.html Russia: Suspicion On The Mountain, Time Magazine, 25 April 1949]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Former astronaut [[James Irwin]] led two expeditions to Ararat in the 1980s, was kidnapped once, but found no tangible evidence of the Ark. "I've done all I possibly can," he said, "but the Ark continues to elude us."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/jbirwin.htm James Irwin, from Arlington National Cemetery website]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the 1980s and 1990s, the [[Durupƒ±nar site]] was heavily promoted by [[Ron Wyatt]]. It receives a steady stream of visitors and according to the local authorities a nearby mountain is called "Mount Cudi" (or Judi), making it one of about five Mount Judis in the land of [[Kurdistan]]. Geologists have identified the Durupƒ±nar site as a natural formation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csun.edu/~vcgeo005/bogus.html bogus ark]&lt;/ref&gt; but Wyatt's Ark Discovery Institute continues to champion its claims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wyattmuseum.com/noahs-ark.htm Wyatt Archeological Research] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703023741/http://www.wyattmuseum.com/noahs-ark.htm |date=3 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2004, Honolulu-based businessman Daniel McGivern announced he would finance a $900,000 expedition to the peak of Greater Ararat in July of that year to investigate the "[[Ararat anomaly]]" ‚Äì he had previously paid for commercial satellite images of the site.&lt;ref name="PlanTurk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/04/0427_040427_noahsark.html |title=Noah's Ark Found?

The expedition was subsequently labelled a "stunt" by ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' News, which pointed out that the expedition leader, a Turkish academic named Ahmet Ali Arslan, had previously been accused of faking evidence of the Ark for a CBS documentary.&lt;ref name="NG2004"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lovgren |first1=Stefan |title=Noah's Ark Quest Dead in Water -- Was It a Stunt? |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/09/0920_040920_noahs_ark.html|publisher=National Geographic |access-date=4 March 2017 |date=20 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In June 2006, [[Bob Cornuke]] of the [[BASE Institute|Bible Archeology Search and Exploration Institute]] (or BASE Institute) took a team of 14 American "business, law, and ministry leaders" to [[Iran]] to visit a site in the [[Alborz|Alborz Mountains]], purported to be a possible resting place of the Ark. The team claimed to have visited an "object" 13,000 feet above sea level, which had the appearance of blackened petrified wooden beams, and was "about the size of a small aircraft carrier" [{{convert|400|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=mid|long}}], and supposedly consistent with the dimensions provided in Genesis of 300 cubits by 50 cubits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.news.aol.com/news/_a/has-noahs-ark-been-found/20060629173309990001?_ccc=3&amp;cid=842  Has Noah's Ark Been Found?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114165201/http://articles.news.aol.com/news/_a/has-noahs-ark-been-found/20060629173309990001?_ccc=3&amp;cid=842 |date=14 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; BASE Institute identifies this site as the site found by Ed Davis.  The team also claimed to have found fossilised sea creatures inside the petrified wood, and in the immediate vicinity of the site.&lt;ref name="forreal"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.worldviewweekend.com/secure/cwnetwork/article.php?&amp;ArticleID=813 |title=Noah's Ark?

*In 2007, a joint Turkish-Hong Kong expedition including members of Noah's Ark Ministries International (NAMI) claimed to have found an unusual cave with fossilized wooden walls on Mount Ararat, well above the vegetation line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noahsarksearch.net/eng/content05.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100518203544/http://www.noahsarksearch.net/eng/content05.php |archivedate=18 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, NAMI released videos of their discovery of the wood structures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/user/NoahsArkSearch NoahsArkSearch - YouTube&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Members of Noah's Ark Ministries International reported carbon dating suggests the wood is approximately 4,800 years old.

On their website they say they asked for the opinion of Mr. Muhsin Bulut, the Director of Cultural Ministries, Agri Province. The web site says that his response was that secretly transporting such an amount of timber to the strictly monitored area and planting a large wood structure at an altitude of 4,000 metres would have been impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noahsarksearch.net/eng/randall.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504085835/http://www.noahsarksearch.net/eng/randall.php |archivedate=4 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of April 2010, it was reported that Turkey's culture minister ordered a probe into how NAMI brought its pieces of wood samples from Turkey to China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-Issues/2010/0430/Chinese-explorers-stand-by-claim-of-Noah-s-Ark-find-in-Turkey Chinese explorers stand by claim of Noah's Ark find in Turkey], The Christian Science Monitor, 3 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A Scottish explorer investigating the NAMI claim was reported missing, on 14 October 2010, from an expedition on Ararat.

== Unsubstantiated claims==

* According to one story, [[Nicholas II of Russia]] sent an expedition to Mount Ararat in 1916‚Äì1918 to investigate the Ark. The fact that Nicholas abdicated during the [[February Revolution]] at the beginning of March 1917 ([[Gregorian calendar]]) makes the story unlikely. A few sources put the date of the expedition at 1916, ("the [[Imperial Russian Air Force|Russian imperial air force]] ... is supposed to have sent 150 men up Mount Ararat in 1916 to explore a large object said to be as long as a city block", reads one). However, this expedition was launched just as the [[Communist Revolution]] broke out in Russia. Allegedly, the reports were turned in to [[Leon Trotsky]], who destroyed them.&lt;ref name="s8int"&gt;[http://www.s8int.com/noahsark1.html ''Ancient High Technology ‚Äì Evidence of Noah's Flood?'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* 
* In 1952, Pastor Harold Williams wrote a story he claimed had been told to him by Haji Yearam, an Armenian Seventh-Day Adventist who had moved to the United States. He let Williams take down his account four years before his death in 1920. According to the story, Yearam as a boy was with his father when they guided three English scientists to the ark in 1856. Upon finding the ark sticking out of a glacier near the summit of Ararat, these scientists were however dumbfounded and angry, since they were "vile men who did not believe in the Bible". Having come to Ararat to ''disprove'' the Scriptures, they now tried to destroy the ark, but were not able to. They then took an oath to keep the discovery a secret and murder anyone who revealed it. About 1918, Williams claimed he saw a newspaper article giving a scientist's deathbed confession, which independently corroborated Yearam's story. Harold Williams said he preserved both Yearam's account and the newspaper clipping until 1940, when both were lost in a fire, leaving the story hearsay on Williams's part. Despite a diligent search, the ca. 1918 newspaper article with the scientist's "confession" has never been located. The online archive of the old [[USENET]] newsgroup talk.origins makes note of the seeming vilification of unbelievers and regards it as suggestive of "religious propaganda".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CH/CH505_1.html&lt;/ref&gt; An academic study notes "the melodrama of Haji Yearam's tale".&lt;ref&gt;''Evangelicals and Science in Historical Perspective'', edited by David N. Livingstone et al., Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1955, French explorer Fernand Navarra reportedly found a 5-foot wooden beam on Mount Ararat some 40 feet under the Parrot Glacier on the northwest slope and well above the treeline. The Forestry Institute of Research and Experiments of the Ministry of Agriculture in Spain certified the wood to be about 5,000 years old ‚Äì a claim that is disputed by [[radio carbon dating]], as two labs have dated the 1969 samples, one at 650 C.E. ¬± 50 years, the other at 630 C.E. ¬± 95 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CH/CH504_2.html TalkOrigins "Navarra's Wood"]&lt;/ref&gt; Navarra's guide later revealed the French explorer bought the beam from a nearby village and carried it up the mountain.&lt;ref name="s8int" /&gt;
* Around 1960, helicopter pilot George Greene claimed to have observed the Ark on Ararat in 1953. It was lying on the side of a vertical rock cliff at the 13,000 to 14,000&amp;nbsp;ft. level. He photographed it from the air and tried to mount an expedition, but his photographs failed to convince any investors. Greene was found drowned in a swimming pool in British Guiana in 1962, and his photographs have not been seen since. In ''The Ararat Report'', February 1990, Ark investigator Bill Crouse listed various "phantom arks" on the mountain, including a formation that "does look like the prow of a huge ship. In reality, it is a huge chunk of basalt. We believe this is also the 'ark' seen by George Greene in 1953."&lt;ref&gt;''The Ararat Report'', ed. Bill Crouse, February 1990 (http://www.christianinformation.org/Feb1990AraratReport.pdf, retrieved June 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1970,  an Armenian, Georgie Hagopian, claimed to have visited the Ark twice around 1908/1910 (1902 in another version, and 1906 according to a segment in the TV series ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]'') with his uncle. Hagopian claimed that he had climbed up onto the Ark and walked along its roof and that some of his young friends had also seen it. The online archive of talk.origins&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CH/CH505_4.html CH505.4: Hagopian and the Ark&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; notes that "[t]he apparent ease of getting to the ark conflicts with the accounts of other explorers."&lt;ref&gt;Hagopian, however, claims that he visited during drought period and that only the mountain's peak was covered in snow&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ed Davis,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noahsarksearch.com/ed-davis.htm Noah's Ark Search ‚Äì Mount Ararat&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; a US army sergeant based at [[Hamadan]] in Iran during World War II, reported that he had climbed [[Mt. Ararat]] with his driver's family in 1943. After three days' climbing, the group camped 100 feet above the Ark and was able to look down into it but not to approach closely. According to Davis's description, it had broken into two pieces, which had been pushed some distance apart by glaciers. Its description roughly matched Hagopian's, judging by [[Elfred Lee]]'s paintings. Lee also interviewed Ed Davis and created a painting based on Davis's descriptions. The structures in the paintings appear to match.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noahsarksearch.com/LeeElfred/LeeElfred.htm Mount Ararat Photo Album ]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1993, [[CBS]] aired a television special entitled ''The Incredible Discovery of Noah's Ark,'' which contained a section devoted to the claims of George Jammal, who showed what he called "sacred wood from the ark." Jammal's story of a dramatic mountain expedition which took the life of "his Polish friend Vladimir" was actually a [[Gerald A. Larue#Noah's Ark Hoax|deliberate hoax]], and Jammal ‚Äì who was really an actor ‚Äì later revealed that his "sacred wood" was wood taken from railroad tracks in [[Long Beach, California]] and hardened by cooking with various sauces in an oven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jammal|first=George|title=Hoaxing The Hoaxers: or, The Incredible (phony) Discovery of Noah's Ark|url=http://atheistalliance.org/library/jammal-hoaxing.php|publisher=Atheist Alliance International|accessdate=9 October 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911024306/http://atheistalliance.org/library/jammal-hoaxing.php|archivedate=11 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shinto''' is frequently a theme in [[Japanese popular culture]], including [[Cinema of Japan|film]], [[manga]], [[anime]], and video games. [[Shinto]] religion is at the core of Japanese culture and history and as such greatly affects the outcome of pop culture in modern Japan.

'''Shinui''' ({{lang-he-n|◊©÷¥◊Å◊ô◊†÷º◊ï÷º◊ô}}, lit. ''Change'') was a [[Zionism|Zionist]], [[secular]], and [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] [[free market]] [[Liberalism worldwide|liberal party]] and political movement in [[Israel]]. The party twice became the third-largest in the [[Knesset]], but both occasions were followed by a split and collapse; in [[Israeli legislative election, 1977|1977]], the party won 15 seats as part of the [[Democratic Movement for Change]], but the alliance split in 1978, and Shinui was reduced to two seats at the [[Israeli legislative election, 1981|next elections]]. In [[Israeli legislative election, 2003|2003]], the party won 15 seats alone, but lost them all [[Israeli legislative election, 2006|three years later]] after most of its MKs left to form new parties. The party was a member of [[Liberal International]] until 2009.

Though it had been the standard-bearer of [[Economic liberalism|liberal economic policy]] and [[Secularism|secular]] values in Israel for 30 years, the formation of [[Kadima]] robbed Shinui of its natural constituency, and in January 2006, the party split into small factions, none of which managed to overcome the 2% threshold needed to enter the Knesset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Israeli political parties |date=5 April 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4813056.stm#Shinnui |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=21 June 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622043916/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4813056.stm#Shinnui |archivedate=22 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===1970s===
As Israel made its transition from a developing nation into an economically prosperous one, a highly educated middle class emerged, tracing its historical political orientation to Labor Zionism. Many of these Israelis banded together to form Shinui.&lt;ref name=Cambridge&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TffrTUyCD6QC&amp;pg=PA304&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Cambridge Dictionary of Judaism and Jewish Culture |editor-last1=Baskin |editor-first1=Judith Reesa |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2010 |page=303 |isbn=9780521825979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shinui was established by business people and academics in 1974, following the 1973 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli [[Yom Kippur War]], which shook the Israeli public. Prior to the [[Israeli legislative election, 1977|1977 elections]], it formed an alliance with several other small liberal parties. Initially, the party was called '''Democrats-Shinui''', but was soon changed to the ''[[Democratic Movement for Change]]'', and, as with many parties in Israel, became popularly known by its acronym, ''Dash''. The new party caught the public's imagination, with over 37,000 people signing up as members within a few weeks of its foundation. It also pioneered the use of [[Primary election|primaries]] to choose its electoral list, something that was intended to show its democratic credentials and prevent cronyism. Previously, in Israel, party lists had been decided upon by the parties' committees, but since the late 1970s, almost every party in Israel (with the exception of the [[Haredi Judaism|Ultra-orthodox]] ones, [[Shas]] and [[United Torah Judaism]]) has followed Dash's lead and adopted the primaries system.

The new party won 15 seats, the best performance by the third party since the [[Israeli legislative election, 1961|1961 elections]]. This made it the third-largest party after [[Menachem Begin]]'s [[Likud]] and the Alignment, which had shrunk from 51 to 32 seats. However, Begin was still able to form a narrow 61-seat right-wing coalition with [[Shlomtzion (political party)|Shlomtzion]] ([[Ariel Sharon]]'s party), the [[National Religious Party]], and [[Agudat Israel]].

Dash were invited into the coalition in November 1977, five months after the Knesset term had started. The party picked up several ministerial portfolios: [[Meir Amit]] was made [[Transportation Minister of Israel|Minister of Transportation]] and Minister of Communications, [[Shmuel Tamir]] became [[Minister of Justice]], and [[Yigael Yadin]] was named as Deputy Prime Minister. However, the fact that Dash did not control the balance of power led to internal disagreements over its role. The alliance began to disintegrate, finally splitting in three on 14 September 1978, with seven MKs breaking away to reform Shinui, another seven founding the [[Democratic Movement (Israel)|Democratic Movement]], and [[Assaf Yaguri]] creating [[Ya'ad (political party)|Ya'ad]]. Shinui (including Amit) and Ya'ad left the coalition, whilst the Democratic Movement, which included Tamir and Yadin, remained in the government. Two Shinui MKs defected to the Alignment, leaving the party with five seats in 1981.

===1980s===
In the [[Israeli legislative election, 1981|1981 elections]], the party was reduced to two seats. In [[Israeli legislative election, 1984|1984]], they won three seats, and were invited to join the [[national unity government]], but pulled out of the coalition on 26 May 1987. Although the party gained an MK from the Alignment, it lost [[Mordechai Virshubski]] to [[Ratz (political party)|Ratz]]. The party was renamed '''Shinui ‚Äì The Centre Party''' during certain periods.

===1990s===
In the [[Israeli legislative election, 1988|1988 elections]], Shinui was reduced to two seats. Although the party gained an MK from the Alignment, they lost another to Ratz. However, in 1992, it joined with Ratz and [[Mapam]] to form the leftist alliance [[Meretz-Yachad|Meretz]]. The new party won 12 seats in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1992|1992 elections]], and were [[Yitzhak Rabin]]'s major coalition partners in his [[Labor Party (Israel)|Labour]]-led government.

In 1996, the three parties decided to officially merge to form a united Meretz party. Although Shinui leader [[Amnon Rubinstein]] supported the merger, most party members sought to distance themselves from the leftist social-democratic elements in Meretz. Two MKs (out of the nine Meretz won in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1996|1996 elections]]) broke away to re-establish Shinui as an independent party in 1997 under the leadership of [[Avraham Poraz]].

Prior to the [[Israeli legislative election, 1999|1999 elections]], the party was taken over by TV celebrity [[Tommy Lapid]], who was known for his fierce rhetoric against religious coercion. The party changed its name to '''Shinui ‚Äì the Secular Movement''', and refused to join any coalition that includes the [[Haredi Judaism|ultra-Orthodox]] parties [[Shas]] and [[United Torah Judaism]]. In the elections, Shinui won 6 seats.

===2000s===
In the [[Israeli legislative election, 2003|2003 elections]], the party won 15 seats, making it the third-largest in the Knesset. [[Ariel Sharon]] invited the party to form a secular coalition, with Shinui taking several key ministerial positions, including the [[Internal Affairs Minister of Israel|Internal Affairs ministry]], a key position in the secular-religious struggle. The party used its bargaining power to close down the Religious Affairs ministry.

Shinui presented itself as centrist on security issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=James Bennet |date=29 January 2003 |title=Israeli Voters Hand Sharon Strong Victory |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/29/world/israeli-voters-hand-sharon-strong-victory.html?pagewanted=2 |newspaper=The New York Times |page=A8 |accessdate=21 June 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622103513/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/29/world/israeli-voters-hand-sharon-strong-victory.html?pagewanted=2 |archivedate=22 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Paritzky affair====
In July 2004, a tape recording of Shinui MK and [[Infrastructure Minister of Israel|Minister of Infrastructure]] [[Yosef Paritzki]] was exposed. In the tape, Paritzki was heard to ask a private investigator to investigate the actions of his Shinui colleague Avraham Poraz. The private investigator was probably paid by the [[trade union|workers' union]] of Israel's [[electric power|Power]] Company (IPC), which wanted to prevent a law bill by Poraz denying the IPC workers many privileges they currently hold.

In response, Shinui publicly denounced and condemned Paritzki, and asked Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]] to fire Paritzki from the cabinet, and called on Paritzki to resign from the Knesset and leave Shinui. Paritzki refused, and blamed Shinui and other factors in a plot against him; he eventually formed his own party, [[Tzalash]]. A criminal investigation was ended without any indictment or any further legal proceedings.

====Religious parties join the coalition====
In August 2004, Sharon initiated coalition negotiations with several other parties after he lost the government majority required to support his [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|disengagement plan]]. Although he preferred to form a Likud‚ÄìLabor‚ÄìShinui "secular unity" government, this was thwarted by Likud MKs. Sharon then started negotiations with Shas and United Torah Judaism (UTJ). Although Shinui had vowed not to sit in a coalition with either party, after significant pressure from Sharon, and to avoid being blamed for thwarting the implementation of the disengagement plan, Lapid retracted his vow, and agreed to let UTJ join the coalition if they would agree to the government's principles.

====Shinui out of the cabinet====
On 1 December 2004, Shinui voted against Sharon's 2005 budget, which included subsidies to UTJ projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Shinui Leaves Israeli Government |publisher=Liberal International |url=http://www.liberal-international.org/editorial.asp?ia_id=861&amp;keywords=Shinui |accessdate=21 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622042926/http://www.liberal-international.org/editorial.asp?ia_id=861&amp;keywords=Shinui |archivedate=22 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Sharon fired the Shinui ministers from the cabinet. On 10 January 2005, Labour joined the coalition, replacing Shinui. However, the party continued to support the disengagement and [[Finance Minister of Israel|Finance Minister]] [[Binyamin Netanyahu]]'s financial reforms. Following its departure from the government, the party was renamed '''Shinui ‚Äì Party for the Secular and the Middle Class'''.

====Poraz affair and party split====
In June 2005, [[Avraham Poraz|Poraz]] was confronted by party activists who accused him and Lapid of dictatorial control of the party, and was recorded by them offering vacation flights out of the country and other financial favours. The tape reached [[Maariv (newspaper)|''Maariv'']], which at the time was running its "Where is the Shame" anti-corruption campaign led by its editor [[Amnon Dankner]] and top columnist [[Dan Margalit]]. However, the affair generated little publicity, as the party was outside the government. Nevertheless, the issues were brought to a head in September 2005 when Rubinstein criticized [[Tommy Lapid|Lapid]] for stifling criticism and not engaging efforts to expand the party's membership.

On 12 January 2006, the party held internal primary elections in preparation for the [[Israeli legislative election, 2006|elections that year]]. In a surprise result, [[Ron Levintal]] beat [[Avraham Poraz|Poraz]] in the contest for second place on the party's list behind Lapid (who was re-elected with 53% of the votes). This resulted in the party splitting, with five MKs ([[Avraham Poraz|Poraz]], [[Ilan Shalgi]], [[Meli Polishook-Bloch]], [[Eti Livni]], and [[Roni Brizon]]) leaving the party to form a new party they claimed would represent the "real Shinui". On 25 January, [[Tommy Lapid|Lapid]] resigned as party chairman, and left the party, declaring it no longer worthy of support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4647776.stm |title=Shinui leader resigns in Israel |publisher=BBC News |date=25 January 2006 |accessdate=21 June 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417142546/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4647776.stm |archivedate=17 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3206300,00.html |title=Lapid announces resignation from Shinui |date=25 January 2006 |publisher=Ynetnews |accessdate=21 June 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622043607/http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3206300,00.html |archivedate=22 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By then, a total of eleven MKs had left Shinui and formed a new party, the Secular Faction (later renamed [[Hetz (political party)|Hetz]]), led by [[Avraham Poraz|Poraz]] and supported by [[Tommy Lapid|Lapid]]. After [[Yigal Yasinov]] also left the party, Shinui was left with only two MKs, [[Ehud Rassabi]] and [[Ilan Leibovitch]].

Before the elections, Levintal made several conciliatory gestures toward Hetz, attempting negotiations with them, the anti-corruption [[Tafnit]] party led by [[Uzi Dayan]], and former Prime Minister [[Ehud Barak]] over the prospect of forming a united front, but to no avail. In the election, Shinui won just 4,675 votes, 0.16% of the total, well below the 2% (62,741 votes) [[electoral threshold]]. Hetz won only 10,113 votes, meaning that both parties lost their Knesset representation.

====Since the 2006 Knesset elections====
The party did not run in the [[Israeli legislative election, 2009|2009 Knesset elections]], and has not run in any subsequent national elections. It participated in combination with other parties, however, in the 2008 municipal elections in Haifa (led by Shlomo Gilboa), and won two seats.&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.haifa.muni.il/spru/doc/YB/PoliticalSystem/Municipal/Municipal2008/Stand Alone/TB-NameList.XLS {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shinui also participated in Tel Aviv-Yafo under the name Tel Avivim (led by Ron Levintal), but did not win any seats.

In 2012, Tommy Lapid's son, [[Yair Lapid]], formed [[Yesh Atid]], a secularist, centrist, liberal Zionist party that won 19 seats in the [[Israeli legislative election, 2013|2013 Knesset elections]], making it the Kneeset's second-largest party, and 11 seats in the [[Israeli legislative election, 2015|2015 Knesset elections]]. Yesh Atid is widely considered to be in the same tradition as Shinui, and has largely absorbed its electoral base.

==Ideology==

===Religion and state===
Despite nearly 30 years of public support of [[Liberalism|liberal]]-[[Capitalism|capitalist]] economic and social policies, its best known platform plank is a call for separation of [[religion]] and [[Government|state]] within the confines of Zionist ideology. It demands [[Civil marriage in Israel|civil marriage]] (although it has opposed a bill to enact it in March 2004), the operation of [[public transportation]], businesses, theaters, etc., on [[Shabbat]], removal of laws concerning selling and importing non-[[kosher]] food, drafting of ultra-Orthodox Jews into the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]], and a halt to payments to [[yeshiva]] students.

Because of such demands, and the inflammatory tone of its current leadership, it was sometimes accused of being [[Antireligion|anti-religious]] or hating the religious, and so, some, including many [[secular]] people who would otherwise agree with its platform, would not vote for it. The party's official position was that it does not oppose religion, but merely seeks to mend the inequities that exist because of religion. Their television campaign for the 2006 elections showed ultra-Orthodox Jews dragging onto secular voter, and as the secular man votes for Shinui, all the ultra-Orthodox vanish in midair.

Shinui supported [[gay rights]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3097554,00.html |title=Lapid: Shinui to fight for full equality for gays |date=10 June 2005 |publisher=Ynetnews |accessdate=21 June 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622063422/http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3097554,00.html |archivedate=22 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and conforming to its liberal orientation, Shinui adopted a unanimous resolution to create an in-party forum for [[gay]], [[lesbian]], [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], and [[transgender]] people.

===Economy===
Economically, Shinui supported a [[free market]], [[privatization]] of public assets, and a lowering of taxes, especially taxes on the [[upper class]]. The party also objected to the introduction of a [[Progressive tax|progressive]] [[estate tax]].

===Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict===
Shinui's position on [[Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict]] was in accord with the mainstream centrist consensus. It supported achieving peace with the Palestinians even at the cost of territorial concessions. Shinui also supported the anti-terrorist policies of [[Ariel Sharon]]'s government, such as the killing of [[Hamas]] leader [[Ahmed Yassin]].

Shinui supported negotiation with the Palestinians concerning the final status and a Palestinian state, which would include removal of [[Israeli settlement]]s and withdrawal from most of the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]. It asserted that both the Right and Left misled the public - the Right by claiming that only force will solve the problem, and the Left by claiming that there is a Palestinian partner for [[peace]].

Shinui strongly supported the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]] and the disengagement plan.

===Political ethics and the fight against corruption===
Shinui proclaimed itself as a defender of political purity and lawful conduct. It promised to set an example for an uncorrupted party whose members are not suspected of involvement in criminal activity or financial irregularities. Shinui saw itself as an antithesis to [[Shas]], many of whose MKs have been convicted in various corruption probes. Accordingly, Lapid requested and received the Justice and Internal Affairs ministries when in government (the latter having been formerly held by [[Shas]]). Shinui also frequently praised the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] as a guardian of the law and moral values.

[[File:Isis_priest01_pushkin.jpg|thumb|right|[[Scipio Africanus|Scipio Africanus the Elder]] (''pictured'') appears to his grandson and tells him of the universe and his destiny in the ''Somnium Scipionis''.]]
The '''''Dream of Scipio''''' ([[Latin]], '''''Somnium Scipionis'''''), written by [[Cicero]], is the sixth book of ''[[De re publica]]'', and describes a fictional [[dream vision]] of the [[Roman republic|Roman]] [[general]] [[Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus|Scipio Aemilianus]], set two years before he oversaw the destruction of [[Carthage]] in 146 BC.

== Textual history ==

The ''Somnium Scipionis'' is a portion of the sixth and final book from Cicero's ''[[De re publica]]'', but because large parts of Cicero's whole work are missing, ''Somnium Scipionis'' represents nearly all that remains of the sixth book.&lt;ref name=stahl10&gt;Stahl (1952), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason that the ''Somnium Scipionis'' survived was because in the fifth-century, the Latin writer [[Macrobius]] wrote a [[Neoplatonic]] [[Commentarii in Somnium Scipionis|commentary]] on the work, in which he excerpted large portions from Cicero.&lt;ref name=zetzel34/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drabble, Stringer, and Hahn (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many copies of Macrobius's work were amended with a copy of the ''Somnium Scipionis'' at their end.&lt;ref name=stahl10/&gt; However, during the Middle Ages, the ''Somnium Scipionis'' became so popular that its transmission was polluted by multiple copies, and today it has been impossible to establish a [[Textual criticism#Stemmatics|stemma]] for it.&lt;ref name=zetzel34&gt;Zetzel (1995), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==

Upon his arrival in [[Africa]], a guest at the court of [[Massinissa]], Scipio Aemilianus is visited by his dead grandfather-by-adoption, [[Scipio Africanus]], hero of the [[Second Punic War]].  He finds himself looking down upon Carthage "from a high place full of stars, shining and splendid". His future is [[clairvoyance|foretold]] by his grandfather, and great stress is placed upon the loyal duty of the Roman soldier, who will as a reward after death "inhabit... that circle that shines forth among the stars which you have learned from the Greeks to call the Milky Way".  Nevertheless, Scipio Aemilianus sees that [[Rome]] is an insignificant part of the earth, which is itself dwarfed by the stars.

Then, Scipio Aemilianus sees that the universe is made up of nine [[celestial spheres]]. The earth is the inner most, whereas the highest is heaven, which "contains all the rest, and is itself the supreme God" (''unus est caelestis'' [...] ''qui reliquos omnes complectitur, summus ipse deus''). In between these two extremes lie the spheres of the Moon, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus (planet)|Venus]], [[Mars (planet)|Mars]], [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]], and [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]] (which proceed from lowest to highest).&lt;ref name=intro_spheres&gt;Cicero, ''De Republica'' 6.17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cicero &amp; Keyes (1928), pp. 268{{en dash}}69.&lt;/ref&gt; As he stares in wonder at the universe, Scipio Aemilianus begins to hear a "loud and agreeable" (''tantus et tam dulcis'') sound, which Scipio Africanus identifies as the ''[[musica universalis]]'': the "music of the spheres". He explains to his grandson that because the planets are set apart at fixed intervals, a sound is produced as they move. The moon, being the lowest sphere and the one closest to Earth, emits the lowest sound of all, whereas the heaven emits the highest. The Earth, on the other hand, does not move, remaining motionless at the center of the universe.&lt;ref name=music_spheres&gt;Cicero, ''De Republica'' 6.18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cicero &amp; Keyes (1928), p. 270{{en dash}}71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Then the [[clime|climatic belts]] of the earth are observed, from the snow fields to the [[desert]]s, and there is discussion of the nature of the [[Divinity|Divine]], the [[soul]] and [[virtue]], from the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] point of view.

== Relation to other works ==

The tale is modelled on "[[The Myth of Er]]" in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Reid (1987), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the story of Er records a [[near-death experience]], while the journey of Scipio's "disembodied soul" takes place in a dream, both give examples of belief in [[astral projection]].&lt;ref&gt;Palley (1979), pp. 185{{en dash}}86.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception and influence ==

The literary and philosophical influence of the ''Somnium'' was great. [[Macrobius]]' ''Commentary upon Scipio's Dream'' was known to the sixth-century philosopher [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]], and was later valued throughout the [[Middle Ages]] as a primer of cosmology. The work assumed the astrological [[cosmos]] formulated by [[Claudius Ptolemy]]. [[Chretien de Troyes]] referred to Macrobius' work in his first [[Arthurian]] romance, ''Erec'', and it was a model for [[Dante]]'s account of heaven and hell.  [[Chaucer]] referred to the work in "[[The Nun's Priest's Tale]]" and especially in the ''[[Parlement of Foules]]''.

Some critics consider [[Raphael]]'s painting ''[[Vision of a Knight (Raphael)|Vision of a Knight]]'' to be a depiction of Scipio's Dream.

The [[composer]] [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], at the age of fifteen, wrote a short [[opera]] entitled ''[[Il sogno di Scipione]]'' ([[K√∂chel-Verzeichnis|K. 126]]), with a [[libretto]] by [[Pietro Metastasio|Metastasio]], based upon Scipio Aemilianus's 'soul-journey' through the cosmos.

[[Iain Pears]] wrote a historical novel called ''[[The Dream of Scipio (novel)|The Dream of Scipio]]'' which refers to Cicero's work in various direct and indirect ways.

Bernard Field, in the preface to his ''History of Science Fiction'', cited Scipio's vision of the Earth as seen from a great height as a forerunner of modern science fiction writers describing the experience of flying in orbit &amp;mdash; particularly noting the similarity between Scipio's realization that Rome is but a small part of the Earth with similar feeling by characters in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s works.

This story is the basis for Chris McCully's poem "Scipio's Dream" from his collection ''Not Only I'', published in 1996.

'''''The New Jerusalem''''' is a [[1920 in literature|1920]] [[book]] written by British writer [[G. K. Chesterton]].

*"On the road to Cairo one may see twenty groups exactly like that of the Holy Family in the pictures of the Flight into Egypt; with only one difference. The man is riding on the ass."
*"The real mistake of the Muslims is something much more modern in its application than any particular passing persecution of Christians as such. It lay in the very fact that they did think they had a simpler and saner sort of Christianity, as do many modern Christians. They thought it could be made universal merely by being made uninteresting. Now a man preaching what he thinks is a platitude is far more intolerant than a man preaching what he admits is a paradox. It was exactly because it seemed self-evident, to Muslims as to Bolshevists, that their simple creed was suited to everybody, that they wished in that particular sweeping fashion to impose it on everybody."

A '''theophoric name''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Œ∏ŒµœåœÜŒøœÅŒøœÇ}}, ''theophoros'', literally "bearing or carrying a god")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=theophoric|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/theophoric|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster|Merriam-Webster online dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|qeo/foros|Œ∏ŒµœåœÜŒøœÅŒøœÇ|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; embeds the name of a god, both invoking and displaying the protection of that deity. For example, names embedding [[Apollo]], such as ''Apollonios'' or ''Apollodorus'', existed in Greek antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Shendge, Malati J. ''The Language of the Harappans: From [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] to [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]'', 1997. p 24. "It may also be interpreted as theophorous names, i.e. the name of the god forming part of the name of an individual. The usage is theophorous because besides the [[eponymous]] Asura, each individual of high or low status has a [[personal name]]."&lt;/ref&gt;

Theophoric personal names, containing the name of a god in whose care the individual is entrusted (or a generic word for ''god''), were also exceedingly common in the [[ancient Near East]] and [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref&gt;Zadok, R. ''The Pre-[[Hellenistic period|hellenistic]] [[Israelite]] [[Anthroponymy]] and [[Prosopography]]'', 1988. p 16. "The Period of the Judges (J) The theophorous names constitute a sizable minority (almost 40%). Many of the hypocoristica possibly originate from compound theophorous names (e.g., Abdon, Gerd, J21 1 1 1 1, 2141 12)."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benz, Frank L. ''Personal Names in the [[Phoenicia]]n and [[Punic language|Punic]] Inscriptions''. p 233. "Any one of the three major types of elements, [[divine name]] or theophorous, nominal, or verbal can make up a Phoenician-Punic [[hypocoristic name]]. The divine name [[hypocoristic]] is the least attested. The simplest formation is that of a single ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drijvers, H. J. W. ''Cults and Behafs at Edessa'', 1980. p 21. "The proper names, which are mainly theophorous ones, may increase our knowledge of the religious feeling of the people of [[Edessa]] and of the [[cult]]s practiced by them, insofar as their theophorous elements reflect existing beliefs."&lt;/ref&gt;  Some names of theophoric origin remain common today, such as [[Theodore (given name)|Theodore]] (''theo-'', "god"; ''-dore'', origin of word compound in Greek: ''doron'', "gift"; hence "God's gift"; in Greek: ''Theodoros'') or less recognisably as ''[[Jonathan (name)|Jonathan]]'' (from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] Yonatan, meaning "Yahweh has given").

==Classical theophoric names==
* [[Demetrius]] and its derivatives mean "follower of [[Demeter]]."
* [[Dennis]], in Latin ''Dionysius'', and its relatives mean "of [[Dionysus]]."
* [[Martin (name)|Martin]] and its relatives mean "of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]."
* [[Zeno (disambiguation)|Zeno]] and Diodoros or Diodorus from [[Zeus]] (genitive of Zeus is 'dios'); Poseidonios from [[Poseidon]]; Athenodoros/Athenodora from [[Athena]] and Minervina from [[Minerva]]; Apollodoros/Apollodora and Apollonios from [[Apollo]]n; Artemisia and Artemidoros/Artemidora from [[Artemis]]; Aphrodesia from [[Aphrodite]]; Hephaistion from [[Hephaistos]]; Aria from [[Ares]]; Hermione from [[Hermes]]; Heliodoros/a from [[Helios]]; Fortunatus from [[Fortuna]]; Serapion from [[Serapis]] and Isidoros or Isidora from [[Isis]].
* Certain names of classical gods are sometimes given as personal names. The most common is [[Diana (given name)|Diana]] and its variants, such as [[Diane (given name)|Diane]]; others include [[Minerva (mythology)|Minerva]], [[Aphrodite]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], [[Isis]], or [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]. The first [[pope]] to take a [[regnal name]], [[Pope John II]], had the given name [[Mercury (god)|Mercurius]] and changed his name as he considered it inappropriate for the Pope to have the name of a pagan deity.

Some Christian saints have polytheistic theophoric names (such as [[Saint Dionysius]], [[Saint Mercurius]], [[Saint Saturninus (disambiguation)|Saint Saturninus]], [[Saint Hermes]], Saint [[Martin of Tours]], [[Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki]],).

==Germanic theophoric names==
* [[Aesir|Os]], meaning "god"
** [[Oslac (name)|Oslac]]
** [[Oswald (given name)|Oswald]]
** [[Oswine (disambiguation)|Oswin]]
* [[Thor]], the god of thunder
** [[Torsten|Thorstein]] means "Thor's stone"
** [[Thorkel]] means "Thor's craft"
** Thorulf means "Thor's wolf"
** [[Thordis]]
** [[Thora (given name)|Thora]]
* [[Yngvi|Ing]], an old name for [[Freyr]] (an epithet meaning "lord")
** [[Ingrid (given name)|Ingrid]]
** [[Ingeborg]]
** [[Inger (given name)|Inger]]
** [[Ingunn]]

Rarely, Germanic names contain the element ''[[odhr|Wod]]'' (such as ''Wo√∞u-ri√∞e''), potentially pointing to an association with the god [[Odin]]. In connection, numerous names containing ''wulf'' "wolf" have been taken as totemistic, expressing association with Odin in the earliest period, although ''-ulf'' degenerated into a mere suffix from an early time (F√∂rstemann 1856).

==Hinduism==
Some traditional Hindu names honor Hindu gods or goddesses. Often, the same name is ascribed to multiple deities.

It is not uncommon to find Hindus with names of gods. Shiva, Krishna, Ganesh, Durga, Radha, and Sita are all names of Hindu gods or goddesses as well as being personal names for Hindus. Hindu gods themselves have multiple names, so it is not always apparent if an Indian name is the name of a god or not.

* [[Abdullah (name)|Abdullah]]/Abdullahi: "servant of God"

==Judaism and biblical==
{{Main|Theophory in the Bible}}
{{contains Hebrew text}}
Much [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] theophory occurs in the [[Bible]], particularly in the [[Old Testament]]. The most prominent theophory involves
* names referring to [[El (god)|El]], a word meaning ''might'', ''power'' and (a) ''god'' in general, and hence in Judaism, ''God'' and among the Canaanites the name of the god who was the father of Baal.
* names referring to [[Names of God in Judaism#Yah|Yah]], a shortened form of [[Yahweh]].
* names referring to Levantine deities (especially the storm god, [[Hadad]]) by the [[epithet]] ''[[Baal]]'', meaning ''lord''. 

In later times, as the conflict between [[Yahweh#Origins and_adoption as "God of Israel"|Yahwism]] and the more popular pagan practices became increasingly intense, these names were censored and ''Baal'' was replaced with ''Bosheth'', meaning ''shameful one''. However the name Yahweh does not appear in theophoric names until the time of Joshua, and for the most part is very rare until the time of King Saul, when it began to be very popular.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Haughwout, "Personal Names Before Exodus 6:2-3" [http://markhaughwout.com/Bible/Prefixes_suffixes_divine_names_Genesis.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

===El===
{{See also|El (deity)}}
* [[Ariel (given name)|Ariel]]: "lion of God"
* [[Daniel]]: "God is my judge" or "justice from God"
* [[Elias]]/Elijah: "my God is Yahweh"
* [[Elisha (given name)|Elisha]]: "my God is salvation"
* [[Elizabeth (given name)|Elizabeth]]: Hebrew [[Elisheba]] = "my God is an oath" or "my God is abundance"''
* Emmanuel/[[Immanuel]]: "God is with us"
* [[Ezekiel (name)|Ezekiel]]: "God will strengthen"
* [[Gabriel]]: "God is my strength"
* [[Ishmael]]: "God has heard"
* [[Israel (name)|Israel]]: "who prevails with God"
* [[Joel (given name)|Joel]]: "Yahweh is God"
* [[Lemuel]]: "Dedicated/Devoted to God"
* [[Michael]]: "Who is like God?"
* [[Nathaniel]]: "God-given" or "gift of God"
* [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]]: "God heals"
* [[Samuel]]: "name of God"
* [[Uriel]]: "God is my light"

===Yahweh===
{{See also|Yahweh|YHWH}}
The name of the Israelite deity YHWH (usually shortened to Yah or Yahu, and Yeho or Yo) appears as a prefix or suffix in many theophoric names of the [[First Temple Period]]. For example, ''Yirme-yahu'' ([[Jeremiah]]), ''Yesha-yahu'' ([[Isaiah]]), ''Netan-yah'', ''Yedid-yah'', ''Adoni-yah'', ''Nekhem-yah'', ''Yeho-natan'' ([[Jonathan (name)|Jonathan]]), ''Yeho-chanan'' ([[John (given name)|John]]), ''Yeho-shua'' ([[Joshua]]), ''Yeho-tzedek'', ''Zekharya'' ([[Zechariah (given name)|Zechariah]]).

"Yah≈´" or "Yah" is the abbreviation of YHWH when used as a suffix in Hebrew names; as a prefix it appears as "Y&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;h≈ç-", or "Yo". It was formerly thought to be abbreviated from the [[Masoretes|Masoretic]] pronunciation "[[Yehovah]]". There is an opinion&lt;ref&gt;Anson F. Rainey, [http://members.fortunecity.com/yahuwthah/Resource-577/AnsonLetter.htm How Yahweh Was Pronounced] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202034811/http://members.fortunecity.com/yahuwthah/Resource-577/AnsonLetter.htm |date=December 2, 2011 }}, QUERIES &amp; COMMENTS.&lt;/ref&gt; that, as Yahweh is likely an [[imperfective]] verb form, "Yahu" is its corresponding [[preterite]] or [[jussive]] short form: compare ''yi≈ùt&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;hawe&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;'' (imperfective), ''yi≈ùt√°h√ª'' (preterit or jussive short form) = "do obeisance".

* Elijah/[[Elias]]: "my God is YHWH"
* [[Hezekiah]]: "YHWH strengthens"
* [[Isaias (given name)|Isaiah]]: "YHWH is salvation"
* [[Jedediah]]: "friend of YHWH"
* Jeremy/[[Jeremiah (given name)|Jeremiah]]: "YHWH will raise"
* [[Joel (given name)|Joel]]: "YHWH is God"
* [[Yohanan|John]]: "graced by YHWH"
* [[Jonathan (name)|Jonathan]]: "YHWH has given"
* [[Joseph]]: "YHWH shall increase"
* [[Josiah (given name)|Josiah]]: "healed by YHWH"
* [[Matthew (given name)|Matthew]]: "gift of YHWH"
* [[Book of Micah|Micah]]: "who is like YHWH?"
* [[Nehemiah]]: "YHWH comforts"
* [[Obadiah]]: "servant of YHWH"
* [[Tobias]]: "the goodness of YHWH"
* [[Uriah (disambiguation)|Uriah]]: "flame of YHWH"
* [[Uzziah]]: "YHWH is my strength"
* Zachary/[[Zechariah (given name)|Zechariah]]: "YHWH has remembered"
* [[Zephaniah]]: "hidden by YHWH"

However, the name [[Judah (Bible)|Judah]] (Y&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;h≈´da&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;) is not an example.  The name Judah, comes from the root word Yadah = Yud-Dalet-Hey, which means "praise".  The letter Yud is also a prefix pronoun in Hebrew, thus not every name or word beginning with Yud or Yud-Hey is theophoric.

In the table below, 13 theophoric names with "Yeho" have corresponding forms where the letters ''eh'' have been omitted. There is a theory by [[Christian Ginsburg]] that this is due to Hebrew scribes omitting the "h", changing Jeho ({{hebrew|◊ô÷∞◊î◊ï÷π}}) into Jo ({{hebrew|◊ô◊ï÷π}}), to make the start of "Y&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;ho-" names not sound like an attempt to pronounce the Divine Name.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christian Ginsburg]], Introduction To the Massoretico-Critical Edition Of The Hebrew Bible, p 369&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott Jones, [http://www.lamblion.net/Articles/ScottJones/jehovah1.htm Jehovah] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215095417/http://www.lamblion.net/Articles/ScottJones/jehovah1.htm |date=December 15, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Referring to other gods===
* [[Abijam]]: "my father is [[Yam (god)|Yam]]"
* [[Nebuchadnezzar]] (in [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]], ''[[Nabu]]-kudurri-usur'')
* [[Ishbaal]]: "man of [[Baal]]".
* [[Mark (given name)|Mark]]: "dedicated to [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]".
* [[Jezebel]]: "glory to Baal".

Theophoric names containing "[[Baal]]" were sometimes "censored" as ''-bosheth'' = "shameful one", whence [[Ishbosheth]] etc.

Some names might be controversial theological statements: ''[[Bealiah]]'' could mean ''Baal is Yahweh'' and ''[[Elijah]]'' could mean ''Yahweh is El'' (and vice versa, respectively).{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} On the other hand, as traditionally understood, these names simply mean "YHWH is Master" and "YHWH is God." {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

'''Tiphupa''' was an [[India]]n [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] teacher from the 11th and 12th century who was considered to be the [[reincarnation|rebirth]] of '''Darma Dode''', son and student of [[Tibet]]an [[lama]] [[Marpa Lotsawa]]. When young Darma Dode died in an accident his father with the special abilities of a realized lama, managed to prolong his son's life for a while. It was enough time for Marpa to teach him how to transfer his consciousness into a dead body ‚Äì in this case the body of a dead [[pigeon]]. Following the detailed instructions of the teacher, the pigeon flew to India and died next to a sixteen-year-old boy who had recently lost his life. Transferring again his consciousness, this time to the young boy‚Äôs body, gave life to the Indian teacher Tiphupa (from Ti Phi ‚Äì pigeon). When the boy returned home it was evident that Tiphupa was very different from who he had been before. He kept taking care of his aging parents as a normal son and they considered him as a [[guru]]. Tiphupa intensively practiced the methods taught by Marpa and others, and methods he received in India from [[Naropa]]‚Äôs students and other masters with the result that he reached realization as a [[mahasiddha]].  He became a famous teacher himself and gave numerous teachings to [[Milarepa]]‚Äôs student [[Rechungpa]]. Probably the most important of them for the future of the [[Kagyu]] lineage was the "nine-fold cycle of the formless [[Dakini]]s".

'''Unitarianism''' (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''unitas'' "unity, oneness", from ''unus'' "one") is a [[Christian theology|Christian theological]] [[Sociological classifications of religious movements|movement]] named for its belief that the [[God in Christianity]] is one person, as opposed to the [[Trinity]] (tri- from Latin ''tres'' "three") which defines God as three [[Hypostasis (philosophy)|persons]] in [[Homoousian|one being]]; the [[God the Father|Father]], [[God the Son|Son]], and [[Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref name=Knight&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15047a.htm |contribution=The dogma of the Trinity |title=Catholic Encyclopedia |editor-first=Kevin |editor-last=Knight |publisher=New Advent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unitarian Christians, therefore, believe that [[Jesus]] was [[Biblical inspiration|inspired by God]] in his moral teachings, and he is a savior,&lt;ref name="Miano 2003 15"&gt;{{citation |first=David |last=Miano |title=An Explanation of Unitarian Christianity |publisher=AUC |year=2003 |page=15 |url=http://americanunitarian.org/explanation.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drzymala, Daren. 2002. ''Biblical Christianity''. Xulon press. p. 122: "Classically, Unitarian Universalist Christians [and Unitarian Christians] have understood Jesus as a Savior because he was a God-filled human being, not a supernatural being."&lt;/ref&gt; but he was not a [[deity]] or [[Incarnation|God incarnate]]. Unitarianism does not constitute one single Christian denomination, but rather refers to a collection of both extant and extinct Christian groups, whether historically related to each other or not, which share a common theological concept of the oneness nature of [[God in Christianity|God]].

While the uncompromising theological [[monotheism]] at the heart of Christian Unitarianism distinguishes it from the major [[Christian denominations]] which subscribe to Trinitarian theology, Christian Unitarianism is analogous to the more austere monotheistic understandings of [[God in Judaism]], and nearer to the concept of [[ God in Islam]].

Unitarianism is also known for the rejection of several other [[Western Christianity|Western Christian]] doctrines,&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Priestley, one of the founders of the Unitarian movement, defined Unitarianism as the belief of primitive Christianity before later corruptions set in. Among these corruptions, he included not only the doctrine of the [[Trinity]], but also various other orthodox doctrines and usages (Earl Morse Wilbur, ''A History of Unitarianism'', [[Harvard University Press]] 1952, pp. 302‚Äì303).&lt;/ref&gt; including the doctrines of [[original sin]], [[Predestination in Christianity|predestination]],&lt;ref&gt;From ''The Catechism of the Hungarian Unitarian Church in Transylvanian Romania'': "Unitarians do not teach original sin. We do not believe that through the sin of the first human couple we all became corrupted. It would contradict the love and justice of God to attribute to us the sin of others, because sin is one's own personal action" (Ferencz Jozsef, 20th ed., 1991. Translated from Hungarian by Gyorgy Andrasi, published in ''The Unitarian Universalist Christian,'' FALL/WINTER, 1994, Volume 49, Nos.3‚Äì4; VII:107).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In his history of the Unitarians, David Robinson writes: "At their inception, both Unitarians and Universalists shared a common theological enemy: Calvinism." He explains that they "consistently attacked Calvinism on the related issues of original sin and election to salvation, doctrines that in their view undermined human moral exertion." (D. Robinson, ''The Unitarians and the Universalists'', Greenwood Press, 1985, pp. 3, 17).&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[biblical infallibility|infallibility of the Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;"Although considering it, on the whole, an inspired book, Unitarians also regard the Bible as coming not only from God, but also from humans&amp;nbsp;... Unitarians therefore do not believe in the infallibility of the Bible, as some other Christians do." (D. Miano, ''An Explanation of Unitarian Christianity,'' AUC, 2003, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Unitarians in previous centuries accepted the doctrine of punishment in an eternal [[hell]], but few do today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unitarian.org.uk/pages/frequently-asked-questions-faq|title=Frequently asked questions (FAQ) - Unitarians|website=www.unitarian.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unitarianism might be considered a part of [[Protestantism]], depending on one's stance or viewpoint, though usually it is excluded from that term due to its [[Nontrinitarian]] nature. Despite common origins during the [[Protestant Reformation]], it is perhaps more accurate to call it a part of [[Nontrinitarianism]]. Some consider it both Protestant and Nontrinitarian, seeing no contradiction between those two terms. Nonetheless, this is not universally accepted.

The Unitarian movement is tied to the more radical critiques of the Reformation. First organized in Eastern Europe during the Reformation, Unitarian communities have developed in Britain, South Africa, India, Canada, United States, Jamaica, Nigeria, and Japan. 

Unitarians began almost simultaneously in the [[Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth]] and in [[Principality of Transylvania (1570‚Äì1711)|Transylvania]] in the mid-16th century. Among the adherents were a significant number of Italians who took refuge in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;James Hastings ''Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics: Algonquins-Art'' p 785  ‚Äì 2001 "The first Unitarians were Italians, and the majority took refuge in Poland, where the laxity of the laws and the independence of the nobility secured for them a toleration which would have been denied to their views in other countries."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The encyclopedia of Protestantism 137 Hans Joachim Hillerbrand ‚Äì 2004 "The so-called Golden Age of Unitarianism in Transylvania (1540‚Äì1571) resulted in a rich production of works both in Hungarian and Latin".&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th Century, significant repression in Poland led many Unitarians to flee or be killed for their faith, notably [[Katarzyna Weiglowa]]. From the 16th to 18th Centuries, Unitarians in Britain often faced significant political persecution, including [[John Biddle (Unitarian)|John Biddle]], [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], and [[Theophilus Lindsey|Theophilus Lindsey]]. In England, the [[Essex Street Chapel|first Unitarian Church]] was established in 1774 on Essex Street, London, where today's [[General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches|British Unitarian]] headquarters are still located.&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Fahlbusch The encyclopedia of Christianity 5 603 2008 "Lindsey attempted but failed to gain legal relief for Anglican Unitarians, so in 1774 he opened his own distinctly Unitarian church on Essex Street, London, where today's British Unitarian headquarters are still located."&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the United States, different schools of Unitarian theology first spread in [[New England]] and the mid-Atlantic states. The first official acceptance of the Unitarian faith on the part of a congregation in America was by [[King's Chapel]] in Boston, from where [[James Freeman (clergyman)|James Freeman]] began teaching Unitarian doctrine in 1784, and was appointed rector and revised the [[prayer book]] according to Unitarian doctrines in 1786.&lt;ref&gt;''American Unitarianism: or, A Brief history of "The progress and State of the Unitarian Churches in America,'' third edition, 1815 "So early as the year 1786, Dr. Freeman had persuaded his church to adopt a liturgy, which the Rev. ... Thus much for the history of Unitarianism at the Stone Chapel. "&lt;/ref&gt; 

In India, three different schools of Unitarian thought influenced varying movements, including the [[Brahmo Samaj]], the Unitarian Church of the [[Khasi Hills]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/Unitarianism-in-Khasi-Jaintia-Hills-A-unique-movement/articleshow/16454581.cms?referral=PM|title=Unitarianism in Khasi-Jaintia Hills: A unique movement - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the Unitarian Christian Church of [[Chennai]], in Madras, founded in 1795. 

Unitarians place emphasis on the ultimate role of reason in interpreting sacred scriptures, and thus freedom of conscience and freedom of the pulpit are core values in the tradition. Reformation is an ongoing process, to be celebrated. Constant study and new experiences can lead to new insights for teachings and community practice. In varying contexts, Unitarians seek to affirm the use of reason in religion and freedom of conscience.  

In [[J. Gordon Melton]]'s ''Encyclopedia of American Religions'', the Unitarian tradition is classified among "the '[[Liberal Christianity|liberal]]' family of churches".&lt;ref&gt;ed. [[J. Gordon Melton]] ''Encyclopedia of American Religions'' (8th ed.)   "Brought together in this chapter as the 'liberal' family of churches and 'religious' organizations are those groups that have challenged the orthodox Christian dominance of Western religious life: Unitarianism, universalism, and infidelism" (p. 611).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
[[File:UnitarianUniversalistChurchsignRochesterMN.JPG|thumb|right|A sign of the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] in [[Rochester, Minnesota]]. Unitarianism in the [[English-speaking world]] largely evolved into a pluralistic liberal religious movement, while retaining its distinctiveness in continental Europe and elsewhere.]]
Unitarianism is a [[proper noun]] and follows the same English usage as other theologies that have developed within a religious movement ([[Calvinism]], [[Anabaptism]], [[Adventism]], [[Wesleyanism]], [[Lutheranism]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;L. Sue Baugh, ''Essentials of English Grammar: A Practical Guide to the Mastery of English'' ({{ISBN|9780844258218}}). Second Edition 1994, p. 59: "Religious Names and Terms: The names of all religions, denominations, and local groups are capitalized."&lt;/ref&gt; The term existed shortly before it became the name of a religious movement,  thus occasionally it is used as a common noun that would describe any [[Christology|understanding of Jesus Christ]] that denies the Trinity or which believes that God is only one person. In that case, it would be a [[Nontrinitarianism|nontrinitarian]] belief system not necessarily associated with the Unitarian religious movement.&lt;ref&gt;J. Gordon Melton, ''Encyclopedia of Protestantism'', 2005, p. 543: "Unitarianism ‚Äì The word ''unitarian'' [italics] means one who believes in the oneness of God; historically it refers to those in the Christian community who rejected the doctrine of the Trinity (one God expressed in three persons). Non-Trinitarian Protestant churches emerged in the 16th century in ITALY, POLAND, and TRANSYLVANIA."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Matthew F. Smith to Editor ''World faiths Encounter'', 7‚Äì12 World Congress of Faiths ‚Äì 1994 ‚Äì "In an otherwise excellent article by Jasbir Singh Ahluwalia, 'Sikh Spirit in an Age of Plurality' (No. 6, November 1993), the writer makes a number of pejorative remarks about 'unitarianism', associating the term with a striving for a monolithic polity and reductionism to a common denominator. This is a very unfortunate misuse of the word. A correct definition of 'unitarianism' (small 'u') is the mono-[[Hypostasis (philosophy)#Trinitarian definitions|hypo-static]] belief system of someone not directly associated with the Unitarian movement, almost always applied to a person from the Christian tradition, as the word was coined in distinction to the orthodox 'Trinitarian' doctrine of Christianity. 'Unitarians' (capital 'U') are, of course, those who follow the Unitarian approach to religion and are formally associated with the movement. In neither case can it be claimed that there is an underlying agenda towards reductionism and uniformity. Quite the reverse, in fact. Modern Unitarianism is remarkable among religions in not only welcoming the variety of faiths that there are to be found but also, as a creedless church, welcoming and encouraging acceptance of the same. We readily accept that not all our members are 'realist' theists, for example. Our long-standing commitment to interfaith understanding, evident in our practical support of the International Association for Religious Freedom, the World Congress of Faiths and the newly established International Interfaith centre in Oxford cannot be taken to mean that Unitarians are seeking the creation of a single world religion out of the old. I do not know a single Unitarian who believes or seeks that. On the contrary, we reject uniformity and cherish instead the highest degree of spiritual integrity, both of the existing religious traditions of the world and of religious persons as unique, thinking individuals. Matthew F Smith, Information Officer" ([[Essex Street Chapel]], Unitarian Church headquarters, UK)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The name originated at the time of the great dispute at Gyulafeh√©rv√°r in 1568, in the course of which M√©lius quite often concluded his argument by saying, ''Ergo Deus est trinitarius''.... Hence his party naturally came to be called Trinitarians and their opponents would naturally be called Unitarians. The name seems thus to have come into general use only gradually and it was long before it was employed in the formal proclamations of their Superintendents.... It is not found in print as the denomination of the church until 1600, when the ''unitaria religio'' is named as one of the four received religions in a decree of the Diet of L√©czfalva (cf. Magyar Eml√©kek, iv, 551) in the extreme southeastern part of Transylvania. The name was never used by the Socinians in Poland; but late in the seventeenth century Transylvanian Unitarian students made it well-known in Holland, where the Socinians in exile, who had never adopted Socinian as the name of their movement and were more and more objecting to it, welcomed it as distinguishing them from Trinitarians. It thus gradually superseded the term Socinian, and spread to England and America." Earl Morse Wilbur, ''A History of Unitarianism'', vol. 2, pp. 47‚Äì48.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Unitarian movement has never accepted the Godhood of Jesus, and therefore does not include those ''nontrinitarian'' belief systems that do, such as [[Oneness Pentecostalism]], [[United Pentecostal Church International]] and the [[True Jesus Church]] and the writings of [[Michael Servetus]], and which maintain that Jesus is God as a single person. Although these groups are unitarians in the common sense, they are not in the proper sense. To avoid confusion, this article is about Unitarianism as a religious movement (proper noun). For the generic form of unitarianism (the [[Christology]]), see [[Nontrinitarianism]]. Recently some religious groups have adopted the 19th-century term ''[[Biblical Unitarianism|biblical unitarianism]]'' to distinguish their theology from Unitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;Tuggy, Dale, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/trinity/unitarianism.html'Unitarianism' (2009). ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'']{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; These likewise have no direct relation to the Unitarian movement.

The term ''Unitarian'' is sometimes applied today to those who belong to a Unitarian church but do not hold a Unitarian theological belief.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, ''The Unitarians and the Universalists'', p. 159-184.&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, the vast majority of members of Unitarian churches were Unitarians also in theology. Over time, however, some Unitarians and Unitarian Universalists moved away from the traditional Christian roots of Unitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;AW Gomes, EC Beisner, and RM Bowman, ''Unitarian Universalism'' (Zondervan, 1998), pp. 30‚Äì79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Unitarian association, 1886. ''The Unitarian Register''. American Unitarian Association. p. 563&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rationalist Press Association Limited, 1957. ''Humanist, Volume 72''. p. III&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in the 1890s the American Unitarian Association began to allow non-Christian and [[Non-theism|non-theistic]] churches and individuals to be part of their fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;George Willis Cooke, ''Unitarianism in America'' (AUA, 1902), pp. 224‚Äì30.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, people who held no Unitarian belief began to be called ''Unitarians'' because they were members of churches that belonged to the American Unitarian Association. After several decades, the non-theistic members outnumbered the theological Unitarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = UUA |url=http://www.uua.org/documents/coa/engagingourtheodiversity.pdf | format = PDF | title = Engaging Our Theological Diversity | pages = 70‚Äì2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar, though proportionally much smaller, phenomenon has taken place in the Unitarian churches in the United Kingdom, Canada, and other countries, which remain more theistically based. Unitarian theology, therefore, is distinguishable from the belief system of modern Unitarian and [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]] churches and fellowships. This article includes information about Unitarianism as a theology and about the development of theologically Unitarian churches. For a more specific discussion of Unitarianism as it evolved into a pluralistic [[liberal religion|liberal religious]] movement, see [[Unitarian Universalism]] (and its national groups the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] in the United States, the [[Canadian Unitarian Council]] in Canada, the [[General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches]] in the United Kingdom, and the [[International Council of Unitarians and Universalists]]).

[[File:K√∂r√∂sf≈ëi-Kriesch Alad√°r Tordai orsz√°ggy≈±l√©s.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|[[Ferenc D√°vid]] holding his speech at the Diet of Torda in 1568 (today [[Turda]], [[Romania]]) by [[Alad√°r K√∂r√∂sf≈ëi-Kriesch]] (1896)]]
Unitarianism, both as a theology and as a [[Christian denomination|denominational family of churches]], was defined and developed in Poland, Transylvania, England, Wales and the United States. Although common beliefs existed among Unitarians in each of these regions, they initially grew independently from each other. Only later did they influence one another and accumulate more similarities.&lt;ref&gt;"The religious movement whose history we are endeavoring to trace...became fully developed in thought and polity in only four countries, one after another, namely Poland, Transylvania, England and America, but in each of these it showed, along with certain individual characteristics, a general spirit, a common point of view, and a doctrinal pattern that tempt one to regard them as all outgrowths of a single movement which passed from one to another; for nothing could be more natural than to presume that these common features implied a common ancestry. Yet such is not the fact, for in each of these four lands the movement, instead of having originated elsewhere, and been translated only after attaining mature growth, appears to have sprung independently and directly from its own native roots, and to have been influenced by other and similar movements only after it had already developed an independent life and character of its own." Earl Morse Wilbur, ''A History of Unitarianism'', vol. 2 (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1952), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Ecclesia minor'' or ''Minor Reformed Church of Poland'', better known today as the [[Polish Brethren]], was born as the result of a controversy that started on January 22, 1556, when [[Piotr of GoniƒÖdz]] (Peter Gonesius), a Polish student, spoke out against the [[doctrine of the Trinity]] during the general synod of the Reformed ([[Calvinist]]) churches of Poland held in the village of [[Secemin]].&lt;ref&gt;Hewett, ''Racovia'', pp. 20‚Äì1.&lt;/ref&gt; After nine years of debate, in 1565, the anti-Trinitarians were excluded from the existing synod of the [[Polish Reformed Church]] (henceforth the ''Ecclesia maior'') and they began to hold their own synods as the ''Ecclesia minor''. Though frequently called "Arians" by those on the outside, the views of [[Fausto Sozzini]] (Faustus Socinus) became the standard in the church, and these doctrines were quite removed from [[Arianism]]. So important was Socinus to the formulation of their beliefs that those outside Poland usually referred to them as [[Socinianism|Socinians]]. The Polish Brethren were disbanded in 1658 by the [[Sejm]] (Polish Parliament). They were ordered to convert to Roman Catholicism or leave Poland. Most of them went to Transylvania or Holland, where they embraced the name "Unitarian." Between 1665 and 1668 a grandson of Socinus, [[Andrzej Wiszowaty Sr.]], published ''[[Bibliotheca Fratrum Polonorum]] quos Unitarios vocant'' (''Library of the Polish Brethren who are called Unitarians'' 4 vols. 1665‚Äì69).

The Unitarian Church in Transylvania was first recognized by the [[Edict of Torda]], issued by the [[Transylvanian Diet]] under [[Rulers of Transylvania|Prince]] [[John II Sigismund Z√°polya]] (January 1568),&lt;ref name="poperamet"&gt;Earl A. Pope, "Protestantism in Romania", in Sabrina Petra Ramet (ed.), ''Protestantism and Politics in Eastern Europe and Russia: The Communist and Postcommunist Eras'', [[Duke University Press]], Durham, 1992, p.160. {{ISBN|0-8223-1241-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was first led by [[Ferenc D√°vid]] (a former [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] bishop, who had begun preaching the new doctrine in 1566). The term "Unitarian" first appeared as ''unitaria religio'' in a document of the Diet of [[Le»õ|L√©cfalva]], [[Transylvania]], on 25 October 1600, though it was not widely used in Transylvania until 1638, when the formal ''recepta Unitaria Religio'' was published.

The word ''Unitarian'' had been circulating in private letters in England, in reference to imported copies of such publications as the ''[[Bibliotheca Fratrum Polonorum|Library of the Polish Brethren who are called Unitarians]]'' (1665). [[Henry Hedworth]] was the first to use the word "Unitarian" in print in English (1673), and the word first appears in a title in [[Stephen Nye]]'s ''A brief history of the Unitarians, called also Socinians'' (1687). The movement gained popularity in England in the wake of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and began to become a formal denomination in 1774 when [[Theophilus Lindsey]] organised meetings with [[Joseph Priestley]], founding the first avowedly Unitarian congregation in the country. This occurred  at [[Essex Street Church]] in London.

The first official acceptance of the Unitarian faith on the part of a congregation in America was by [[King's Chapel]] in Boston, which settled [[James Freeman (clergyman)|James Freeman]] (1759‚Äì1835) in 1782, and revised the Prayer Book into a mild Unitarian liturgy in 1785. In 1800, [[Joseph Stevens Buckminster]] became minister of the [[Brattle Street Church]] in Boston, where his brilliant sermons, literary activities, and academic attention to the [[Historical criticism#Application|German "New Criticism"]] helped shape the subsequent growth of Unitarianism in New England. Unitarian [[Henry Ware (Unitarian)|Henry Ware]] (1764‚Äì1845) was appointed as the [[Hollis Chair of Divinity|Hollis professor of divinity]] at Harvard College, in 1805. [[Harvard Divinity School]] then shifted from its conservative roots to teach Unitarian theology (see [[Harvard Divinity School#Harvard Divinity School and Unitarianism|Harvard and Unitarianism]]). Buckminster's close associate [[William Ellery Channing]] (1780‚Äì1842) was settled over the [[Federal Street Church (Boston)|Federal Street Church]] in Boston, 1803, and in a few years he became the leader of the Unitarian movement. A theological battle with the Congregational Churches resulted in the formation of the [[American Unitarian Association]] at Boston in 1825.

== Beliefs ==

=== Christology ===
Unitarians believe that mainline Christianity does not adhere to strict [[monotheism]] but that they do by maintaining that Jesus was a great man and a [[prophet]] of God, perhaps even a [[supernatural]] being, but not God himself.&lt;ref name="Miano 2003 15"/&gt; They believe Jesus did not claim to be God and that his teachings did not suggest the existence of a [[triune God]]. Unitarians believe in the [[moral authority]] but not necessarily the [[divinity]] of Jesus. Their theology is thus opposed to the [[Trinitarianism|trinitarian]] theology of other [[Christian denomination]]s.

Unitarian Christology can be divided according to whether or not Jesus is believed to have had a pre-human existence. Both forms maintain that [[God]] is one being and one "person" and that Jesus is the (or a) [[Son of God]], but generally not God himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = James | last = Hastings | authorlink = James Hastings | title = Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics | volume = 2 | page = 785 | quote = Unitarianism started, on the other hand, with the denial of the pre-existence...  These opinions, however, must be considered apart from Arianism proper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, Unitarian [[Robert Wallace (Unitarian)|Robert Wallace]] identified three particular classes of Unitarian doctrines in history: 
*'''[[Arianism|Arian]]''', which believed in a pre-existence of the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]], but maintained that Jesus was created and lived as human only; 
*'''[[Socinianism|Socinian]]''', which denied his original divinity, but agreed that Christ should be [[worship]]ped; and 
*'''"Strict Unitarian"''', which, believing in an "incommunicable divinity of God", denied both the existence of the [[Holy Spirit]] and the worship of "the man Christ."&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Robert. 1819. ''[https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=a-orAAAAYAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s A Plain Statement and Scriptural Defence of the Leading Doctrines of Unitarianism]''.

Unitarianism is considered a factor in the decline of classical deism because there were people who increasingly preferred to identify themselves as Unitarians rather than deists.&lt;ref&gt;Mossner, Ernest Campbell (1967). "Deism". Encyclopedia of Philosophy 2. Collier-MacMillan. pp. 326‚Äì336.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Conservative Unitarian''' theology accommodates a wide range of understandings of God. 
* '''Radical Unitarian''' theology further rejects the importance of dogma, liturgy, and anything other than ethics and a gospel of love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Several tenets of Unitarianism overlap with the [[Jesus in Islam|predominant Muslim view of Jesus]] and [[Tawhid|Islamic understanding of monotheism]], although no direct link between the two is suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Setton|first1=Kenneth|title=A History of the Crusades|date=1969|page=466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Socinian" Christology ====
{{Main article|Socinianism}}
[[File:FaustusSocinus.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Fausto Sozzini]] was an Italian theologian who helped define Unitarianism and also served the [[Polish Brethren]] church]]
The Christology commonly called "[[Socinianism|Socinian]]" (after [[Fausto Sozzini]], one of the founders of Unitarian theology) refers to the belief that Jesus Christ began his life when he was born as a human. In other words, the teaching that Jesus [[pre-existence of Christ|pre-existed]] his human body is rejected. There are various views ranging from the belief that Jesus was simply a human ([[psilanthropism]]) who, because of his greatness, was adopted by God as his Son ([[adoptionism]]) to the belief that Jesus literally became the [[son of God]] when he was conceived by the [[Holy Spirit]] (see [[Virgin birth of Jesus]]).

This Christology existed in some form or another prior to Sozzini. [[Theodotus of Byzantium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first = Allan |last = Hoben | title = The virgin birth |year = 1903 |quote= Of the above-stated beliefs that of Theodotus of Byzantium is perhaps the most striking, in that, while it admits the virgin birth, it denies the deductions commonly made therefrom, attributing to Christ only pre-eminent righteousness}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Artemon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = William | last = Bright | title = Some Aspects of Primitive Church Life | page = 127 | quote = His original view was put into more definite form by Artemon, who regarded Jesus Christ as distinguished from prophets by (1) virgin-birth, (a) superior virtue}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul of Samosata]]&lt;ref&gt;Charles, Tutorial prayer book, p. 599.&lt;/ref&gt; denied the pre-existence of Christ.

Hanson]] (1916‚Äì1988), [[Lightfoot Professor of Divinity]] ''The Search for the Christian Doctrine of God: The Arian Controversy, 318‚Äì381'' (9780801031465): 1973 "Photinus' doctrine appears to have been a form of what might be called middle Marcellism, i.e. what Marcellus originally taught before his vicissitudes caused him to temper the edge of his doctrine and take account of the criticisms of his friends as well as of his enemies, a little more moderated."&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Radical Reformation]] and [[Anabaptist]] movements of the 16th century this idea resurfaced with Sozzini's uncle, [[Lelio Sozzini]]. Having influenced the [[Polish Brethren]] to a formal declaration of this belief in the [[Racovian Catechism]], Fausto Sozzini involuntarily ended up giving his name to this Christological position,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Watson | first = R. | title = A Biblical and theological dictionary | page = 999}}&lt;/ref&gt; which continued with English Unitarians such as [[John Biddle (Unitarian)|John Biddle]], [[Thomas Belsham]], [[Theophilus Lindsey]], [[Joseph Priestley]], and [[James Martineau]]. In America, most of the early Unitarians were "Arian" in Christology (see below), but among those who held to a "Socinian" view was [[James Freeman (clergyman)|James Freeman]].

Regarding the virgin birth of Jesus among those who denied the preexistence of Christ, some held to it and others did not. Its denial is sometimes ascribed to the [[Ebionites]]; however, [[Origen]] (''Contra Celsum'' v.61) and [[Eusebius]] (''HE'' iii.27) both indicate that some Ebionites did accept the virgin birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first = Geoffrey W. | last = Bromiley | title = International Standard Bible Encyclopedia |volume = E‚ÄìJ |year = 1982 | page = 9 |quote = Origen was the first to distinguish between two types of Ebionites theologically: those who believed in the Virgin Birth and those who rejected it}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Theodotus of Byzantium]], [[Artemon]], and [[Paul of Samosata]] all accepted the virgin birth.&lt;ref name="Stead"&gt;{{Citation|last=Stead|first=Christopher |title=Philosophy in Christian Antiquity |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-46955-5 |location=Cambridge |date= 1996-01-27}} 189 pp.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early days of Unitarianism, the stories of the virgin birth were accepted by most. The ''Chambers Biographical Dictionary'' (1897) incorrectly ascribes denial of the virgin birth to [[Ferenc D√°vid]], leader of the Transylvanian Unitarians.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} However, there were a number of Unitarians who questioned the historical accuracy of the Bible (such as [[Symon Budny]], [[Jacob Palaeologus]], Thomas Belsham, and [[Richard Wright (Unitarian)|Richard Wright]]), and this made them question the virgin birth story.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = R.

''American Transcendentalism: A History''. New York: Hill and Wang, 2007: 7‚Äì8. {{ISBN|0-8090-3477-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Its proponents took an intellectual and humanistic approach to religion. They embraced evolutionary concepts, asserted the "inherent goodness of man", and abandoned the doctrine of biblical infallibility, rejecting most of the miraculous events in the Bible (including the virgin birth). Notable examples are [[James Martineau]], [[Theodore Parker]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Frederic Henry Hedge]]. Famous American Unitarian [[William Ellery Channing]] was a believer in the virgin birth until later in his life, after he had begun his association with the Transcendentalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = William Carl | last = Placher | title = A history of Christian theology: an introduction | year = 1983 | page = 265 | quote = Rationalist Unitarians like William Ellery Channing had argued from the Bible and the evidence of its miracles}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = John White | last = Chadwick |title = William Ellery Channing: Minister of Religion |page = 440}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first = Jack |last = Mendelsohn |title = Channing, the Reluctant Radical: a biography |year =1971 |quote = A Suffolk County grand jury indicted him on three charges of blasphemy and obscenity: (1) he had quoted a scurrilous passage by Voltaire disparaging the virgin birth of Jesus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Arian" Christology ====
{{Main article|Arianism}}
[[File:Constantine burning Arian books (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Constantine I]] burning [[Arian]] books, illustration from a book of canon law, c. 825]]
The Christology commonly called "[[Arianism|Arian]]" holds that Jesus, before his human life, existed as the [[Logos]], a being created by God, who dwelt with God in heaven. There are many varieties of this form of Unitarianism, ranging from the belief that the Son was a divine spirit of the same nature as God before coming to earth, to the belief that he was an angel or other lesser spirit creature of a wholly different nature from God.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} Not all of these views necessarily were held by [[Arius]], the namesake of this Christology. It is still Nontrinitarian because, according to this belief system, Jesus has always been beneath God, though higher than humans. Arian Christology was not a majority view among Unitarians in Poland, Transylvania or England. It was only with the advent of American Unitarianism that it gained a foothold in the Unitarian movement.

Among early Christian theologians who believed in a pre-existent Jesus who was subordinate to God the Father were [[Lucian of Antioch]], [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], [[Arius]], [[Eusebius of Nicomedia]], [[Asterius the Sophist]], [[Eunomius]], and [[Ulfilas]], as well as [[Felix, Bishop of Urgell]]. Proponents of this Christology also associate it (more controversially) with [[Justin Martyr]] and [[Hippolytus of Rome]]. Antitrinitarian [[Michael Servetus]] did not deny the pre-existence of Christ, so he may have believed in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last = Odhner |first=CT |url=https://archive.org/details/michaelservetush00odhn |title=Michael Servetus, His Life and Teachings |page = 77 |year= 1910|quote = It will be seen from these extracts how completely without foundation is the assertion that Servetus denied the eternal pre-existence of Christ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=March 2013}} (In his "Treatise Concerning the Divine Trinity" Servetus taught that the Logos (Word) was the reflection of Christ, and "that reflection of Christ was 'the Word with God" that consisted of God Himself, shining brightly in heaven, "and it was God Himself"&lt;ref name="Servetus 1553 75"&gt;{{cite book|last=Servetus|first=Michael|title=The Restoration of Christianity ‚Äì An English Translation of Christianismi restitutio, 1553, Translated by Christopher A.

=== Other beliefs ===
Although there is no specific authority on convictions of Unitarian belief aside from rejection of the Trinity, the following beliefs are generally accepted:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Samuel Joseph | last = May | title = What Do Unitarians Believe? | place = Albany | publisher = Weed, Parsons, and Co. | origyear = 1860 | year = 1867}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = AC | last = Henderson | title = What Do Unitarians Believe? | year = 1886}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Orville | last = Dewey | title = The Unitarian Belief | place = Boston | year = 1873}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = James Freeman | last = Clarke | title = Manual of Unitarian Belief | origyear = 1885 | edition = 20th | year = 1924}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = George H | last = Ellis | title = What Do Unitarians Believe About Jesus Christ? | place = Boston | year = 1890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Jabez T | last = Sunderland | title = What Do Unitarians Believe? | place = New York | publisher = AUA | year = 1891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* One God and the oneness or unity of God.
* The life and teachings of Jesus Christ constitute the exemplar model for living one's own life.
* Reason, rational thought, science, and philosophy coexist with faith in God.
* Humans have the ability to exercise [[free will]] in a responsible, constructive and ethical manner with the assistance of religion.
* [[Human nature]] in its present condition is neither inherently corrupt nor depraved (see [[original Sin]]) but capable of both good and evil, as God intended.
* No religion can claim an absolute monopoly on the Holy Spirit or [[theological]] truth.
* Though the authors of the Bible were inspired by God, they were humans and therefore subject to human error.
* The traditional [[doctrines]] of [[predestination]], [[Hell in Christian beliefs|eternal damnation]], and the vicarious sacrifice and satisfaction theories of the [[Atonement in Christianity|Atonement]] are invalid because they malign God's character and veil the true nature and mission of Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1858|title=The Unitarian Denomination|journal=The Quarterly Journal of the American Unitarian Association|volume=5|publisher=[[American Unitarian Association]]|location=Boston|page=168|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zPgQAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA168&amp;lpg=PA168&amp;dq=%22unitarian+theory+of+atonement%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZD_gIzvbdZ&amp;sig=zwGUphU7r_IKc2aL-VAAi1sROHU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Mg5tT5zODZTciQLc44yuBQ&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22unitarian%20theory%20of%20atonement%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unitarians have [[Liberal religion|liberal]] [[Conceptions of God|views of God]], Jesus, the [[world]] and [[Meaning of life|purpose of life]] as revealed through [[reason]], [[scholarship]], [[science]], [[philosophy]], [[Religious text|scripture]] and other prophets and [[religion]]s. They believe that reason and belief are complementary and that [[Relationship between religion and science|religion and science]] can co-exist and guide them in their understanding of [[nature]] and God. They also do not enforce belief in [[creed]]s or [[dogma]]tic formulas. Although there is flexibility in the nuances of [[belief]] or basic [[truth]]s for the individual Unitarian [[Christian]], general principles of faith have been recognized as a way to bind the group in some commonality.

Unitarian Christians reject the doctrine of some Christian denominations that God chooses to [[Redemption (religious)|redeem]] or save only those certain individuals that accept the creeds of, or affiliate with, a specific church or religion, from a common ruin or corruption of the mass of humanity.

In 1938, ''The Christian leader'' attributed "''the'' religion ''of'' Jesus, not ''a'' religion ''about'' Jesus" to Unitarians,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = The Christian leader | volume = 120 | chapter = 2 | page = 1034 | year = 1938 | quote = This view finds pat expression in the dictum that Christianity is the religion of Jesus, not a religion about Jesus | author = An esteemed Unitarian minister}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the phrase was used earlier by [[Congregationalist]] [[Rollin Lynde Hartt]] in 1924&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Rollin Lynde | last = Hartt | title = The Man Himself | year = 1924}}&lt;/ref&gt; and earlier still by US President Thomas Jefferson.

== Worship ==
Worship within the Unitarian tradition accommodates a wide range of understandings of [[God]], while the focus of the service may be simply the celebration of life itself. Each Unitarian congregation is at liberty to devise its own form of worship, though commonly, Unitarians will light their chalice (symbol of faith), have a story for all ages; and include sermons, prayers, hymns and songs.  Some will allow attendees to publicly share their recent joys or concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/unitarianism/worship/worship.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Unitarianism: Unitarian worship|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This section relates to Unitarian churches and organizations today which are still specifically Christian, whether within or outside Unitarian Universalism. Unitarian Universalism, conversely, refers to the embracing of non-Christian religions.

=== International groups ===
Some Unitarian Christian groups are affiliated with the [[International Council of Unitarians and Universalists]] (ICUU), founded in 1995. The ICUU tends to contain a majority membership who express specifically Unitarian Christian beliefs, rather than the religious pluralism of the UUA, but nevertheless remain liberal, open-minded and inclusive communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icuu.net/membergroups/index.html|title=icuu.net|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828104243/http://www.icuu.net/membergroups/index.html|archivedate=2009-08-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICUU has "full member" groups in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil, Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Indonesia, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Romania, South Africa, and Sri Lanka.

The ICUU includes small "Associate groups", including Congregazione Italiana Cristiano Unitariana, [[Turin]] (founded in 2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cesnur.org/religioni_italia/p/prot_radicale_04.htm | language = Italian | title = Protestanti radicale | first = Rev.

The largest Unitarian denomination worldwide today is also the oldest surviving Unitarian denomination (since 1565, first use of the term "Unitarian" 1600);&lt;ref&gt;a the [[Diet of L√©cfalva]] 1600, in Gordon A. ''Heads of Unitarian History''&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Unitarian Church of Transylvania]] (in Romania, which is in union with the Unitarian Church in Hungary). The church in Romania and Hungary still looks to the statement of faith, the ''[[Summa Universae Theologiae Christianae secundum Unitarios]]'' (1787), though today assent to this is not required. The modern [[Unitarian Church in Hungary]] (25,000 members) and the [[Transylvanian Unitarian Church]] (75,000 members) are affiliated with the International Council of Unitarians and Universalists (ICUU) and claim continuity with the historical Unitarian Christian tradition established by [[Ferenc D√°vid]] in 1565 in [[Transylvania]] under [[John II Sigismund Z√°polya]]. The Unitarian churches in Hungary and Transylvania are structured and organized along a church hierarchy that includes the election by the synod of a national bishop who serves as superintendent of the Church. Many Hungarian Unitarians embrace the principles of rationalist Unitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = David | last = Keyes | title = Most Like An Arch |year = 1999 |page = 106 |quote = And for those [UUs] who take the time to understand Transylvanian Unitarian beliefs, there may be some surprising discoveries to be made.

Just as the UUCF and ICUU maintain formal links with the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] in the USA, so the UCA is an affiliate body of the GAUFCC in Great Britain.

The majority of Unitarian Christian publications are sponsored by an organization and published specifically for their membership. Generally, they  do not serve as a tool for missionary work or encouraging conversions.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

The Unitarian Christian Conference USA is a network of congregations and ministers in the United States identifying with the historic Unitarian Christian tradition. The Unitarian Christian Conference USA promotes the concept of the unity of God and the message and example of Jesus of Nazareth as a rational and enriching spiritual path for personal development and a guide for creating a world of justice, peace and human dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/uccusa|title=Security Check Required|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Unitarian Universalist Christian Fellowship]] (UUCF) was founded in 1945 and as such predates the consolidation of the American Unitarian Association (AUA) and [[Universalist Church of America]] (UCA) into the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] (UUA) in 1961. UUCF continues as a subgroup of UUA serving the Christian members.

The [[American Unitarian Conference]] (AUC) was formed in 2000 and stands between UUA and ICUU in attachment to the Christian element of modern Unitarianism. The American Unitarian Conference is open to non-Christian Unitarians, being particularly popular with non-Christian [[theists]] and [[deists]].&lt;ref&gt;The Connection of Deism to American Unitarianism ‚Äì Nathan De May&lt;/ref&gt; The AUC has four congregations in the United States.

Unitarian Christian Ministries International was a Unitarian ministry incorporated in South Carolina until its dissolution in 2013 when it merged with the Unitarian Christian Emerging Church.

Although raised a Quaker, Ezra Cornell, founder of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, attended the Unitarian church and was one of the founders of Ithaca's First Unitarian Church. Eramus Darwin Shattuck, a signatory to the Oregon State Constitution, founded the first Unitarian Church in Oregon in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;''The Centennial History of Oregon 1811‚Äì1912'' by Joseph Gaston, p. 582.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eleven Nobel prizes have been awarded to Unitarians: [[Robert Millikan]] and [[John Bardeen]] (twice) in Physics; [[Emily Green Balch]], [[Albert Schweitzer]], and [[Linus Pauling]] for Peace; [[George Wald]] and [[David H. Hubel]] in Medicine; [[Linus Pauling]] in Chemistry; and [[Herbert A. Simon]] in Economics.

Four presidents of the United States were Unitarians: [[John Adams]], [[John Quincy Adams]], [[Millard Fillmore]], and [[William Howard Taft]]. [[Adlai Stevenson II]], the Democratic presidential nominee in 1952 and 1956, was a Unitarian, and he was the last Unitarian to be nominated by a major party for president. Although a self-styled materialist, [[Thomas Jefferson]] was pro-Unitarian to the extent of advocating that it become the predominant religion in the United States.

British prime minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] was raised by his Unitarian statesman father, [[Joseph Chamberlain]]. Certainly, in the United Kingdom, Unitarianism ‚Äì the religion of only a small minority of the country's population ‚Äì had an enormous impact on Victorian politics, not only in the larger cities ‚Äì [[Birmingham]], [[Leeds]], [[Manchester]], and [[Liverpool]] ‚Äì but in smaller communities like [[Leicester]] where there were so many Unitarian mayors that the Unitarian Chapel was known as the "Mayors' Nest".

In Birmingham a Unitarian church was opened in 1862. The Church of the Messiah, as it was called, was more than the centre of a small sect: it was a cultural and intellectual centre of a whole society, a place where ideas about society were openly and critically discussed. Henry W. Crosskey‚Äôs Birmingham Unitarian congregation included: [[Joseph Chamberlain]], as well as Arthur, his younger brother, who was married to Louisa Kenrick; William Kenrick, his brother-in-law, who was married to Mary Chamberlain; and [[Martineau family|Sir Thomas Martineau]], who was the nephew of [[Harriet Martineau]], another outspoken public figure and author of the time. Sir Thomas Martineau (died 1893), was related to the [[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain family]] by marriage; Sir Thomas had married Emily Kenrick, the sister of Florence Chamberlain, n√©e Kenrick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Times|first1=Waikato|title=Waikato Times, Volume XXVIII, Issue 2328, 11 June 1887, Page 2|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=WT18870611.2.43.6|publisher=Waikato Times (Papers Past) 11 June 1887|accessdate=30 March 2015|quote=mr Thomas martineau....will rise "Sir Thomas"....he (Sir Thomas) is a nephew of Harriet Martineau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Lambeth, South London, another two members of the Martineau family, Caroline and Constance, worked at Morley College, the former acting as (unpaid) principal for over 11 years. Several other prominent Unitarians were involved in the development of this liberal arts college, which was founded by actors at the Old Vic theatre.&lt;ref&gt;''Offspring of the Vic'' by Denis Richards, originally published in 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

These elite British Unitarian families: the [[Joseph Nettlefold|Nettlefolds]], the [[Martineau family|Martineaus]], the [[Lupton family|Luptons]], the [[James Kitson, 1st Baron Airedale|Kitsons]] and the Kenricks, found a most significant place in the social and political history of Victorian through to mid-20th-century Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=The Parliamentary Chamberlains|url=http://www.ianchamberlain.net.au/script/03-Parliamentary%20Chamberlains.pdf|pages=57‚Äì74|title=Chapter 12 ‚Äì William Chamberlain comes to London|publisher=Ian Chamberlain ‚Äì 2003|accessdate=March 2, 2013}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holt|first=Raymond V.|title=The Unitarian Contribution to Social Progress in England|url=http://www.unitarian.org.uk/docs/publications/1952_SocialProgress.pdf|chapter=: Chapter 3, including Georgian and Victorian period.

Other Unitarians include Sir [[Tim Berners-Lee]], inventor of the [[World Wide Web]]&lt;ref&gt;Tim Berners-Lee, [http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/UU.html The World Wide Web and the "Web of Life"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lancelot Ware]], founder of [[Mensa International|Mensa]], Sir [[Adrian Boult]], the conductor, [[Ray Kurzweil]], notable inventor and futurist, and [[C. Killick Millard]], founder of the [[Dignity in Dying]] society to support voluntary euthanasia. [[Ram Mohan Roy]], an Indian reformer of the 18th century, was a Unitarian who published a book called ''Precepts of Jesus''.

{{Vaishnavism}}
'''VaikhƒÅnasa''' is one of the principal traditions of [[Hinduism]] and primarily worships [[Vishnu]] (and his associated [[Avatar]]s) as the Supreme [[God]]. The followers are mainly Brahmins of [[Krishna Yajurveda]] [[Taittiriya Shakha]] and Vaikhanasa Kalpasutra. The name ''VaikhƒÅnasa'' stands for the followers and the fundamental philosophy itself with the name derived from founder, Sage Vaikhanasa. It is  principally [[monotheistic]] in its philosophy, whilst also incorporating elements which could be described as being [[panentheistic]]. Vaikhanansas principle focuses on rituals and worship of Lord Vishnu rather than the philosophy of [[Uttara Mimamsa]], unlike [[Vaishnavism]], the larger and more prevalent form on Vishnu worship.

''Vaikhanasa bhagavath Shastra'' is the guiding principle for rituals in [[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple|Tirumala Venkateswara temple]].

==History==
{{hinduism_small}}
The Vaikhanasa Brahmins/Vaikhanasas originated as a group of ascetics. In the Manava Dharmasastra, Manu discusses vanaprastha, forest-dweller, the third of the four asramas, stages of life, and mentions a "Vaikhanasa rule." Other ancient authorities support this reference, so it seems there was a Vaikhanasa ascetic community before the common era. They are mentioned in the Narayaniya, which is a late section of the [[Mahabharata]] of uncertain date but probably no earlier than the third century CE. Surviving Vaikhanasa sutras are no older than the fourth century CE. 

Inscriptions from perhaps the eighth century CE identify Vaikhanasas as temple priests, and from the end of the tenth century they are prominently mentioned in South Indian inscriptions. Vaikhanasas were the priests of Vishnu temples. They were not merely ritual priests, but were trusted with administering the temples and their lands. 

Sri Baghavad RƒÅmƒÅnujacharya, leader of the Shri Vaishnavas and the organiser of temple administration at [[Srirangam]] Temple, replaced the Vaikhanasa system of worship which came into practice with the [[Pa√±caratra]] system {as the Pancharathra Priests who were in Srirangam relocated or moved to Melnadu [Karnataka Temples] and near Andhrapradesh due to many Muslim invasions in Srirangam - Reference Koil Ozhugu, Ganga Vijayam, Sri Araayairapadi Guruparambara Prabhavam}. During those time Vaikhanasa Priests saved the Srirangam Temple and worshipped the God with Sri Vaikanasa Agama Bagavath Shaastram.  However Sri Ramanujacharya gave importance to both Vaikhanasas and Pancharathras as it is evident that he had not changed the Agama Rituals of Tirumala Tirupathi, Thirukarambanoor[Uthamar Kovil very nearer to Srirangam], Manakkal Nambi temple [Manakkal Nambi who administered Sri Vaishnavism before Sri Alavandar - Acharya/Guru of Sri Ramanujacharya], Tiruvallikeni Temple, Mylapore Sri Peiazhwar Temple which are very famous and popular SriVaishnava temples worshipped according to Sri Vaikanasa Agama rituals.
 
Today Vaikhanasas are the chief priests in more than half of the Vaishnava temples in the South Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and parts of Karnataka. Their present-day temple activities are worthy of attention, as are their efforts to work for community integrity which is threatened by increasing social and technological changes.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Vaikhanasa-sutra belonging to the Trivandrum Sanskrit Series has been edited by Dr. W. Caland and translated into English with a learned introduction. This sutra - text forms part of the [[Krishna Yajurveda]] tradition and derives its name probably from Vaikhanas who was its author. The work contains three types of Sutras ‚Äîthe Shrauta, the Grhya and the Dharma which altogether may be designated as Smarta-sutra. There is no doubt that both the portions have definitely one author, since the style of the Grhya and Dharma-sutras is the same. Moreover, the author himself promises to continue a topic discussed in the Grhya- portion again in the books on Dharma. The work is on the whole a small one but it contains in the main the same materials as are treated by its predecessors." &amp;mdash;''Vaikhanasasmartasutram: The Domestic Rules and Sacred Laws of the Vaikhanasa School Belonging to the Krishna Yajurveda'' translated into English by W. Caland.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Adherents==
The Vaikhanasa Brahmins/Vaikhanasas are a tiny vaishnavite Brahmin community of about 4000 families widely dispersed in South India at Vaishnava temples in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and parts of Karnataka and also worldwide especially in the United States of America, Germany, Australia, UK, and some parts of Europe.

==Doctrines==
Vaikhanasas claim to be a surviving school of Vedic ritual, the Taittiriya Shakha of the [[Krishna Yajurveda]]. Vaikhanasa tradition says the sage Vikhanasa, who was a manifestation of Lord Mahavishnu, had the Upanayanam along with Brahma consecrated by His father Lord Mahavishnu and educated under Lord Mahavishnu all the Vedas and Bhagawat Saastra on how to worship SriBhagawaan in His Archaavathaara - Iconic Form. Sri Vikhanasa Maharishi came down to earth's most holy place Naimisaaranyam composed the Vaikhanasa Kalpasutra and taught Sri Vaikhanasa Bhagawat Saastra to his four disciples viz., Atri, Bhrigu, Kashyapa and Marichi, respectively the procedures of Samurtarcana, Amurtarchana, devotional service to Vishnu in images. Most Vaikhanasa literature is almost completely concerned with rituals, prescribing the rituals and their rules of performance. To the Vaikhanasas their temple worship is a continuation of Vedic fire sacrifice. Regular and correct worship of Vishnu in a temple will bring the same results as the fire sacrifice even for people who do not maintain their fires.
 
Jnana, knowledge, sections of Vaikhanasa texts are short and it is necessary to infer their doctrines from discussions in the texts on ritual. The Vaikhanasas evolved the theory of the five aspects of Vishnu: [[Vishnu]], the all-pervading supreme deity; Purusha, the principle of life; Satya, the static aspect of deity; Achyuta, the immutable aspect; and Aniruddha, the irreducible aspect. The distinction is emphasised between Vishnu in his Niskala presence, the unfigured primeval and indivisible form unperceived even by Brahma, and his Sakala presence, the figured, divisible, emanated, and movable form. In his sakala presence he responds gracefully to devotional meditation. Shri is important as nature, Prakriti, and as the power, Shakti, of Vishnu. 

The Vaikhanasa doctrine states that Moksha is release into Vishnu's heaven. The nature of a man's Moksha is dependent on a devotee's service of Japa, attentive repetition of prayer, Huta, Yaaga, sacrifice, archana, service to images, or Dhyana, Yogic meditation. Of the four the Marichi Samhita says Archana is the realisation of all aims.

==Symbols==
Temples and images with the Vaikhanasas are of more importance than perhaps any other sect of Hinduism. In accordance with Vaikhanasa doctrine of the two forms of Vishnu, the Nishkala, the unfigured, and the Sakala, the figured, two cult images are distinguished. There is the large immovable image representing Vishnu's Niskala form, which is ritually placed in a sanctuary and elaborately consecrated, and a smaller movable image representing Vishnu's Sakala form. If the devotee wishes for temporal and eternal results he should worship both forms. But if he is after only eternal results he should worship the immovable image. 

After purification and meditation to identify with Vishnu, the devotee surrenders to Vishnu and places the movable image on a bathing pedestal and elaborately bathes it. This is preparation for receiving the presence of God by immediate contact via a connecting string. The invocation starts with a Mantra, sacred utterance, saying that the Imperishable is linked to the Perishable and that the Self is released from all evil as it knows God. Flowers are presented to all the deities present. Then the hymn called the Aatmasukta is recited that identifies the body of the devotee with the cosmos, followed by meditation on Vishnu's Niskala aspect: these parts of the ritual are to request Vishnu to take his Sakala form in the movable image so that the devotee can converse with Him. A Puja ceremony takes place with God as the royal guest, followed by a Homa, offering into the fire [Homaagni], and a Bali [offering-but not animal sacrifice] with something that may be visible, touchable, audible, or eatable. An offering of [Havis - anything offered as an oblation with fire], cooked food, is important as the God's meal. Afterwards the Prasaada (Food that was offered to God) is eaten by the worshipers and devotees. The offering area is cleaned and a Bali of cooked rice sprinkled with butter is offered to Vishnu. Then comes a Pradakshina [circumambulation from left to right clockwise as a kind of worship]around the temple. After Daksina, the officiating BrahmaN's share of the Prasadam, is given, Vishnu is meditated upon as the personal manifestation of the sacrifice. Finally Puspanjali [Mantra Pushpam], i.e., offering a handful of flowers at the God's lotus feet after chanting the holy Mantraas, and the temple door is closed after Mangala Haarathi.This

"The statue of the Samian Hera, as Aethilos &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[sic]]&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The name ''Aethilos'' in the available text is thought to be a mis-spelling of ''Aethlios''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; says, was a wooden beam at first, but afterwards, when [[Prokles]] was ruler, it was humanized in form".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Clement of Alexandria |author=Clement of Alexandria |title=Protrepticus |at=40, 41, cited in Stewart}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Pausanias' travels he never mentions seeing a xoanon of a mortal man.

==Types of xoana==
Some types of archaic xoana may be reflected in archaic marble versions, such as the pillar-like "Hera of Samos" ([[Louvre Museum]]), the flat "Hera of Delos" or some archaic [[kouros]]-type figures that may have been used to represent [[Apollo]].

A different type of cult figure in which the face, hands, and feet were carved of marble and the rest of the body made of wood is called [[acrolith]]. The wooden part was usually covered either with cloth or [[gold leaf]].

==Woods and textiles==
For [[Strabo]],&lt;ref name=StraboGeog&gt;{{cite book |author=Strabo |author-link=Strabo |title=Geography}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "carved" xoanon might also be of [[ivory]];&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Thus [[Strabo]] describes the [[chryselephantine]] sculptures of [[Phidias|Phidian]] Zeus and [[Polykleitos|Polyclitan]] Hera as xoana, and even the marble Nemesis at [[Rhamnus (Greek archaeological site)|Rhamnus]], as Frazer noted (Frazer 1897).&lt;/ref&gt; Pausanias, however, always uses ''xoanon'' in its strict sense, to denote a wooden image; at [[Corinth]] Pausanias noted that "The sanctuary of Athena Chalinitis is by the theater, and near it is a naked xoanon of Herakles, said to be by Daidalos. All the works of this artist, though somewhat uncouth to look at, nevertheless have a touch of the divine in them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pausanias |title=Description of Greece |at=2.4.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Of the works of Daidalos there are two in Boeotia, a Herakles in Thebes and the Trophonios at Lebadeia. There are also two other xoana in Crete, a [[Britomartis]] at Olous and an Athena at Knossos. ... At Delos, too, there is a small xoanon of Aphrodite, its right hand damaged by time, and instead of feet its lower part is square.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Compare the image of the "Lady of Ephesus" whom the Greeks called Artemis: [[Temple of Artemis at Ephesus]].&lt;/ref&gt; I am persuaded that Ariadne got this image from Daidalos.|Pausanias, 9.40.3}}

Similar xoana were ascribed by the Greeks to the contemporary of Daedalus, the equally legendary [[Smilis]]. Such figures were often clothed in real textiles, such as the [[peplos]] that was woven and ceremonially delivered to Athena on the Acropolis of Athens into historic times.

The wood of which a xoanon was carved was often symbolic: olivewood,&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The olive is sacred to Athena.&lt;/ref&gt; pearwood, ''[[Vitex agnus-castus|Vitex]]'', oak,&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The oak is especially sacred to Zeus.&lt;/ref&gt; are all specifically mentioned.

In Athens, in the [[Erechtheum]], an ancient olivewood&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Athenagoras of Athens |author=Athenagoras |title=Legatio |at=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; effigy of [[Athena]] (the [[Palladion]]) was preserved. The Athenians believed it had fallen to earth from the heavens, as a gift to [[Athens]]; it was still to be seen in the 2nd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Pausanias (geographer) |author=Pausanias |title=Description of Greece |at=1.26.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the island of [[Icaria]] a rustic piece of wood was venerated for the spirit of [[Artemis]] it contained or represented (Burkert).&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;[[Ovid]] describes how in the cave of [[Cybele]] numerous wooden images are to be seen in {{cite book |author-link=Ovid |author=Ovid |title=[[Metamorphoses]] |at=10.693&amp;nbsp;ff}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copies of venerable images==
[[File:ArtemisEphesus.jpg|thumb|Synthesizing the Lady of Ephesus as Diana Aventina: a Roman marble copy of a Greek replica of a lost Geometric period xoanon (18th-century [[engraving]]).]]
Such an archaic image of wood of the Tauric goddess was stolen by Iphigeneia and Orestes in ''[[Iphigeneia in Tauris]]'' (line 1359). The importance of the xoanon in local cult ensured that it would be carefully copied when colonies were founded, and sent out with the colonists from the mother-city.

[[Strabo]] (4.1)&lt;ref name=StraboGeog/&gt; reports that the [[metropolis]] [[Marseilles|Massilia]] (modern [[Marseille]]) was founded by [[Phocaea]]ns. Their cult of [[Temple of Ephesus|Artemis of Ephesus]] was transferred with the colony, justified in the [[founding myth]] by a dream, and the artistic design of the cult image ‚Äî Strabo uses the term ''diathesis'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] Œ¥ŒπŒ¨Œ∏ŒµœÉŒπœÇ) ‚Äî was re-exported to Massiliote sub-colonies, "where they  keep the diathesis of the xoanon the same, and all the other usages precisely the same as is customary in the mother-city".&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], as quoted in {{cite book |first1=Daniela |last1=Dueck |first2=Hugh |last2=Lindsay |first3=Sarah |last3=Pothecary |title=Strabo's Cultural Geography: The Making of a Kolossourgia |year=2005 |page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, cementing cultural ties between the [[Phocaea]]n colony at [[Marseilles|Massilia]] and the [[Phocaea]]n community in [[Rome]], "Among the others, the Romans have consecrated Artemis' xoanon on the Aventine, taking the same model from the Massiliotes" (Strabo, 4.1.5).&lt;ref name=StraboGeog/&gt; So the cult image of the [[Artemis of Ephesus|Lady of Ephesus]], identified as [[Artemis]] in [[Interpretatio graeca|Greek understanding]], was established as [[Diana Aventina]] at Rome, of whom marble copies survive (see illustration at right).

[[File:Yeay mao cambodia.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Altar to Yeay Mao in Riem Pagoda, [[Sihanoukville (city)|Sihanoukville]].]]

'''Yeay Mao''' or '''Lok Yeay Mao''' (in [[Khmer language|Khmer]] ·ûô·û∂·ûô·ûò·üâ·üÖ - ·ûõ·üÑ·ûÄ·ûô·û∂·ûô·ûò·üâ·üÖ, Grandma Mao) is an ancient [[Mythology|mythical]] [[hero]]ine&lt;ref&gt;[http://khmerkromngo.org/heroes/Listofheroes.htm Khmer Heroes], Kampuchea Krom Community: ''Yeay [or Grandma] Mao, visitors travel to seacoast Sihanoukville and Kampong Som province must stop to pay respect.''. Link retrieved on 2nd Feb 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and a divinity in the local [[Folk religion|popular form]] of [[Buddhism]] and [[Historical Vedic religion|Brahmanism]] in [[Cambodia]]. She is venerated mainly is in the coastal provinces of the country, especially along the road from [[Phnom Penh]] to the sea port of [[Sihanoukville (city)|Sihanoukville]], as well as in [[Kampot Province|Kampot]] and [[Kep Province|Kep]]. At the [[Bokor Hill Station|Bokor Mountain]] in Kampot there is a 29 meters tall monument to Yeay Mao inaugurated in 2012, while there is a young version of Yeay Mao in the Kep Beach called ''Beautiful Lady'' (·ûü·üí·ûö·û∏·ûü·üí·û¢·û∂·ûè) or ''Sela waits for her husband'' (·ûü·û∑·ûõ·û∂·ûÖ·û∂·üÜ·ûî·üí·ûè·û∏), but that belongs to the legend of Mao looking to the west for her lost husband.  She is considered the protector of travelers and hunters. Drivers still stop at her shrine along [[National Highway 4 (Cambodia)|National Road 4]] near [[Phnom Pech Nil]] to pay their respects and wash their cars with water from the stream nearby, as well as the monument at Bokor.

== History ==

The history of Yeay Mao is unclear, being composed of several legends and interpretations. There are many popular stories surrounding her. It is said that she was a beautiful lady married to a powerful warrior. When he died, she took control of the armies against the [[Thailand|Thai]] and became a celebrity. The story is placed sometime before the [[France|French Colony]] (1863‚Äì1953).

Another version says that Yeay Mao was the wife of Ta Krohom-Koh (·ûè·û∂·ûÄ·üí·ûö·û†·ûò·ûÄ) - literally "''Grandpa Red Neck''". They lived in the forest near Pech Nil Mountain (·ûó·üí·ûì·üÜ·ûñ·üÅ·ûá·üí·ûö·ûì·û∑·ûõ). Once they went around and they met a tiger. Ta Krohom-Koh abandoned his wife and the tiger devoured her.

Since then, any traveller who passed by the place of the accident, paid respect to her spirit to avoid a similar fate.&lt;ref&gt;Seik Sopat y Sadang Tuo: Colecci√≥n de Tradiciones Camboyanas (·ûî·üí·ûö·ûá·ûª·üÜ·ûö·ûø·ûÑ·ûñ·üí·ûö·üÅ·ûÑ·ûÅ·üí·ûò·üÇ·ûö), pp.82-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

When they built the highway between Phnom Penh and the sea in what is today Sihanoukville, a small temple was built at the spot. The road was finished by the French in 1876, a fact that increased the pilgrimage to the temple. It included [[Vietnam]]ese and Chinese believers.

== Celebration ==

[[File:Kep Sela Cham P'dey.JPG|thumbnail|right|''Sela waits for her husband'' (·ûü·û∑·ûõ·û∂·ûÖ·û∂·üÜ·ûî·üí·ûè·û∏), a monument in [[Kep Province]] inspired in a version of Yeay Mao, whose husband went to the wars with Thailand and never returns, so she decided to go to the west in his search.]]

The main feast is celebrated in June. The believers go to the Temple or any place destined for the veneration, to bring sacred food, especially pig head, chicken soup, the ''sla-toa'' (·ûü·üí·ûõ·û∂·ûí·ûò·üå) - a coconut adorned with flowers and leaves and used in religious celebrations in Cambodia, the ''bay-sei'' (·ûî·û∂·ûô·ûü·û∏)- section of banana tree trunk with legs to which three to nine layers of banana leaves rolled up in finger shape have been attached. It is used also in certain ceremonies.
.&lt;ref&gt;Seik Sopat and Sadang Tuo: Collection of Cambodian Traditions (·ûî·üí·ûö·ûá·ûª·üÜ·ûö·ûø·ûÑ·ûñ·üí·ûö·üÅ·ûÑ·ûÅ·üí·ûò·üÇ·ûö), pp.80-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The place of the veneration must be set with three statues:

# '''Yeay Sau''' (·ûô·û∂·ûô·ûü·üÖ·ûö·üè): A female spirit, that is the wife of Ogn (·û¢·üä·ûª·ûÑ), the ''kabural tgnol'' (·ûÄ·û∂·ûî·üâ·ûº·ûö·üâ·û∂·ûõ·ûê·üí·ûì·ûõ·üã), guard of the paths.
# '''Ta Snong Long''' (·ûè·û∂·ûü·üí·ûì·ûÑ·û°·ûª·ûÑ): "Grandpa Snong Long", considered the son of Yeay Sau and Ogn.
# '''Long Mao''': She is the same "Yeay Mao".

== Beliefs ==

According to Seik Sopat and Sadang Tuo,&lt;ref&gt;Seik Sopat and Sadang Tuo: Collection of Cambodian Traditions (·ûî·üí·ûö·ûá·ûª·üÜ·ûö·ûø·ûÑ·ûñ·üí·ûö·üÅ·ûÑ·ûÅ·üí·ûò·üÇ·ûö), p.78.&lt;/ref&gt; the story of Yeay Mao dates from 1866, when she was a spirit of cruelty that attacked any traveller that did not pay respects to her at Pech Nil Mountain (·ûó·üí·ûì·üÜ·ûñ·üÅ·ûá·üí·ûö·ûì·û∑·ûõ).

If the person to whom the spirit sent strong pains because ignoring to pay veneration to her, repented, that person was healed. But if that person did not repent, he or she could die.

It was also believed that if a person presented his offering asking to hurt an enemy, the spirit used to fulfil the wish.&lt;ref name="Sadang Tuo p.80"&gt;Seik Sopat and Sadang Tuo: Collection of Cambodian Traditions (·ûî·üí·ûö·ûá·ûª·üÜ·ûö·ûø·ûÑ·ûñ·üí·ûö·üÅ·ûÑ·ûÅ·üí·ûò·üÇ·ûö), p.80.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, the French army destroyed the first temple and the divinity came in decadence.

During the short Japanese invasion of Cambodia in 1940, the army of that country gathered the farmers of [[Kampot Province]] and Vietnamese, Chinese and [[Cham (Asia)|Cham]] Cambodians, to dig trenches at the ancient sacred place. According to the legend, the workers desecrated the site, bringing the fury of the spirit. People started to suffer epidemics and many died. They explained these epidemics as the fury of Yeay Mao.&lt;ref&gt;Seik Sopat and Sadang Tuo: Collection of Cambodian Traditions (·ûî·üí·ûö·ûá·ûª·üÜ·ûö·ûø·ûÑ·ûñ·üí·ûö·üÅ·ûÑ·ûÅ·üí·ûò·üÇ·ûö), p.79.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to placate the spirit, the people started again to offer gifts to Yeay Mao and the veneration revived. After the villages near to Pech Nil Mountain, pray to the divinity asking for health and protection. If there was, for example, a theft, they pray to the spirit to punish the criminal.&lt;ref name="Sadang Tuo p.80" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1307">The '''Zabarima Emirate''' was a state that existed in what is today parts of [[Ghana]] and [[Burkina Faso]] from the 1860s until 1897. 

The leaders of the Zabarima Emirate originated in an area now in the nation of [[Niger]], in an area south-east of [[Niamey]] on the east side of the [[Niger River]]. 

The key moving force behind the state was [[Babatu (warlord)|Babatu]] who hailed from [[Indungu]] in Niger, a place that had been Muslim far longer than most of the other areas the Zabarima leadership came from, most of which became Muslim only in the 1850s or so.

'''Zoram''' ({{IPAc-en|Àà|z|o ä|r|…ô|m}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from ¬´z≈ç¬¥rum¬ª&lt;/ref&gt; is the name of three individuals in the [[Book of Mormon]], indexed in the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS]] edition as Zoram¬π, Zoram¬≤, and Zoram¬≥.

== Zoram¬π ==

'''Zoram¬π''' was the servant of [[Laban (Book of Mormon)|Laban]], a wealthy inhabitant of Jerusalem. According to ''[[First Nephi]]'', Zoram led [[Nephi, son of Lehi|Nephi]], disguised as Laban, into Laban's treasury. Nephi, speaking "in the voice of Laban" ({{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=1 Nephi|chapter=4|verse=20}}) commanded Zoram to take the brass plates containing "a record of the Jews" ({{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=1 Nephi|chapter=3|verse=3}}) to his brethren. Zoram, "supposing that [he] spake of the brethren of the church" ({{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=1 Nephi|chapter=4|verse=26}}) took the plates and carried them to where Nephi's brothers were waiting. When he discovered the truth, Zoram was frightened, so Nephi promised to spare his life if Zoram swore allegiance to them ({{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=1 Nephi|chapter=4|verse=32}}), and was permitted to accompany Nephi and his brethren.

== Zoram¬≤ ==

'''Zoram¬≤''' was a chief captain of the [[Nephite]] army, mentioned in only two verses in the ''Book of Mormon'' ({{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=16|verse=5|range=, 7}}). He sought the guidance of [[Alma the Elder|Alma]], the high priest, in locating Nephites that had been captured by the Lamanites, his son [[List of Book of Mormon people#L|Lehi]] joining him. He also won a victory over the [[Lamanites]] after crossing the river Sidon. ({{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=16|verse=7}})

{{succession box | before = [[Alma, son of Alma]]| title = [[Nephite]] military leader| years = the 11th-18th years of the reign of the judges, or 81-74 BC| after = [[Captain Moroni]]}}
{{S-end}}
{{-}}

== Zoram¬≥ ==

'''Zoram¬≥''' was a Nephite apostate, mentioned only briefly ({{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=30|verse=59}}, {{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=31|verse=1}}), but notable as the leader of the [[Zoramites]], an apostate group. In reaction to the possibility of his people joining the [[Lamanites]] ({{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=31|verse=4}}), [[Alma, son of Alma|Alma]] the younger led a missionary effort to bring back the people ({{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=31|verse=5|range=-7}}). Zoram was cited for leading the people to bow down to idols ({{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=31|verse=1}}).

==Book of Mormon Movie==
In ''[[The Book of Mormon Movie, Vol. 1: The Journey]]'', adapted from First and Second Nephi, Zoram¬π was played by Todd Davis. The portrayals were highly influenced by [[Arnold Friberg]] paintings of the characters.
