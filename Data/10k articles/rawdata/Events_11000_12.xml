Initially introduced on February 24, 2003 and amended on March 7, 2003, the draft set a March 17 deadline for Iraq to demonstrate "full, unconditional, immediate and active cooperation in accordance with its disarmament obligations." The draft was based on information from the iraqi defector "[[Curveball (informant)|Curveball]]," who claimed [[Saddam Hussein]] was in possession of [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]], which Curveball later admitted was untrue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/iraqi-defector-al-janabi-codenamed-curveball-admits-wmd/story?id=12922213|title=Iraqi Defector 'Curveball' Admits WMD Lies|last=News|first=A.

The '''''Bal des Ardents''''' ('''Ball of the Burning Men'''&lt;ref name="T504" /&gt;) or '''''Bal des Sauvages'''''&lt;ref name="V89–91"/&gt; ('''Ball of the Wild Men''') was a [[masquerade ball]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;Sources vary whether the event was a [[masquerade ball|masquerade]] or a [[masque]].&lt;/ref&gt; held on 28&amp;nbsp;January 1393 in [[Paris]] at which [[Charles VI of France]] performed in a dance with five members of the French [[Fiefdom|nobility]]. Four of the dancers were killed in a fire caused by a torch brought in by a spectator, Charles's brother [[Louis I, Duke of Orléans|Louis, Duke of Orléans]]. Charles and another of the dancers survived. The ball was one of a number of events intended to entertain the young king, who the previous summer had suffered an attack of insanity. The event undermined confidence in Charles's capacity to rule; Parisians considered it proof of courtly decadence and threatened to rebel against the more powerful members of the nobility. The public's outrage forced the King and his brother Orléans, whom a contemporary chronicler accused of attempted [[regicide]] and sorcery, to offer penance for the event.

Charles's wife, [[Isabeau of Bavaria]], held the ball to honor the remarriage of a [[lady-in-waiting]]. Scholars believe the dance performed at the ball had elements of traditional ''[[charivari]]'',&lt;ref name=T503/&gt; with the dancers disguised as [[wild men]], mythical beings often associated with demonology, that were commonly represented in medieval Europe and documented in revels of [[Tudor period|Tudor England]]. The event was chronicled by contemporary writers such as [[Michel Pintoin|the Monk of St Denis]] and [[Jean Froissart]], and illustrated in a number of 15th-century [[illuminated manuscripts]] by painters such as the [[Master of Anthony of Burgundy]]. The incident later provided inspiration for [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s short story ''[[Hop-Frog]]''.

== Background ==
In 1380, after the death of his father [[Charles V of France]], the 12-year-old [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]] was crowned king, beginning his minority with his four uncles acting as [[regent]]s.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Three uncles were brothers to Charles V: [[Louis I, Duke of Anjou|Louis of Anjou]], [[Philip the Bold|Philip of Burgundy]] (commonly known as Philip the Bold), and [[John, Duke of Berry|John of Berry]]. [[Louis II, Duke of Bourbon|Louis of Bourbon]] was the brother of Charles VI's mother, [[Jeanne of Bourbon]]. See Tuchman (1978), 367&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "T376"&gt;Tuchman (1978), 367&lt;/ref&gt; Within two years one of them, Philip of Burgundy, described by historian [[Robert Knecht]] as "one of the most powerful princes in Europe",&lt;ref&gt;qtd. in Knecht (2007), 42&lt;/ref&gt; became sole regent to the young king after Louis of Anjou pillaged the royal treasury and departed to campaign in Italy; Charles's other two uncles, John of Berry and Louis of Bourbon, showed little interest in governing.&lt;ref name = "T376"/&gt; In 1387, the 20-year-old Charles assumed sole control of the monarchy and immediately dismissed his uncles and reinstated the [[Marmousets]], his father's traditional counselors. Unlike his uncles, the Marmousets wanted peace with England, less taxation, and a strong, responsible central government—policies that resulted in a negotiated [[Truce of Leulinghem|three-year truce with England]], and the Duke of Berry being stripped of his post as governor of [[Languedoc]] because of his excessive taxation.&lt;ref name="Knecht" /&gt;

[[File:Couronnement de Charles VI le Bien-Aimé.jpg|thumb|Coronation of [[Charles VI of France]] depicted by [[Jean Fouquet]] in the mid-15th century ''[[Grandes Chroniques de France]]'']]

In 1392 Charles suffered the first in a lifelong series of attacks of insanity, manifested by an "insatiable fury" at the attempted assassination of the [[Constable of France]] and leader of the Marmousets, [[Olivier de Clisson]]—carried out by [[Pierre de Craon]] but orchestrated by [[John IV, Duke of Brittany]]. Convinced that the attempt on Clisson's life was also an act of violence against himself and the monarchy, Charles quickly planned a retaliatory invasion of Brittany with the approval of the Marmousets, and within months departed Paris with a force of knights.&lt;ref name="Knecht"&gt;Knecht (2007), 42–47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="T496ff"&gt;Tuchman (1978), 496–499&lt;/ref&gt;

On a hot August day outside [[Le Mans]], accompanying his forces on the way to Brittany, without warning Charles drew his weapons and charged his own household knights including his brother [[Louis I, Duke of Orléans]]—with whom he had a close relationship—crying "Forward against the traitors. They wish to deliver me to the enemy."&lt;ref&gt;qtd. in Tuchman (1978), 498&lt;/ref&gt; He killed four men&lt;ref name="Hennemanff"&gt;Henneman (1996), 173–175&lt;/ref&gt; before his [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]] grabbed him by the waist and subdued him, after which he fell into a coma that lasted for four days. Few believed he would recover; his uncles, the dukes of Burgundy and Berry, took advantage of the King's illness and quickly seized power, re-established themselves as regents, and dissolved the Marmouset council.&lt;ref name="T496ff" /&gt;

The comatose king was returned to Le Mans, where [[Guillaume de Harsigny]]—a venerated and well-educated 92-year-old physician—was summoned to treat him. After Charles regained consciousness, and his fever subsided, he was returned to Paris by Harsigny, moving slowly from castle to castle, with periods of rest in between. Late in September Charles was well enough to make a pilgrimage of thanks to Notre Dame de Liesse near [[Laon]] after which he returned again to Paris.&lt;ref name="T496ff" /&gt;

[[File:Madness of Charles VI.jpg|thumb|right|[[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]] attacking his knights, from [[Froissart's Chronicles|Froissart's ''Chronicles'']]]]

The King's sudden onset of insanity was seen by some as a sign of divine anger and punishment and by others as the result of [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]];&lt;ref name="T496ff" /&gt; modern historians such as Knecht speculate that Charles might have been experiencing the onset of [[paranoid schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name="Knecht" /&gt; Charles continued to be mentally fragile, believing he was [[glass delusion|made of glass]], and according to historian [[Desmond Seward]], running "howling like a wolf down the corridors of the royal palaces".&lt;ref name = "Seward143"&gt;Seward (1987), 143&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary chronicler [[Jean Froissart]] wrote that the King's illness was so severe that he was "far out of the way; no medicine could help him".&lt;ref name = "Seward144"&gt;qtd. in Seward (1987), 144&lt;/ref&gt; During the worst of his illness Charles was unable to recognize his wife, [[Isabeau of Bavaria]], demanding her removal when she entered his chamber, but after his recovery Charles made arrangements for her to hold guardianship of their children.  Isabeau eventually became guardian to her son, the future [[Charles VII of France]] (b. 1403), granting her great political power and ensuring a place on the council of regents in the event of a relapse.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons (1996), 57–59&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[A Distant Mirror|A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous 14th Century]]'' the historian [[Barbara Tuchman]] writes that the physician Harsigny, refusing "all pleas and offers of riches to remain",&lt;ref&gt;Tuchman (1978), p502&lt;/ref&gt; left Paris and ordered the [[courtiers]] to shield the King from the duties of government and leadership. He told the King's advisors to "be careful not to worry or irritate him&amp;nbsp;.... Burden him with work as little as you can; pleasure and forgetfulness will be better for him than anything else."&lt;ref name="T504"/&gt; To surround Charles with a festive atmosphere and to protect him from the rigor of governing, the court turned to elaborate amusements and extravagant fashions. Isabeau and her sister-in-law [[Valentina Visconti, Duchess of Orléans]], wore jewel-laden dresses and elaborate [[braid]]ed hairstyles coiled into tall shells and covered with wide double [[hennin]]s that reportedly required doorways to be widened to accommodate them.&lt;ref name="T504"/&gt;

The common people thought the extravagances excessive yet loved their young king, whom they called Charles ''le bien-aimé'' (the well-beloved). Blame for unnecessary excess and expense was directed at the foreign queen, who was brought from [[Bavaria]] at the request of Charles's uncles.&lt;ref name="T504" /&gt; Neither Isabeau nor her sister-in-law Valentina—daughter of the ruthless [[Gian Galeazzo Visconti|Duke of Milan]]—were well liked by either the court or the people.&lt;ref name="Hennemanff"/&gt; Froissart wrote in his ''[[Froissart's Chronicles|Chronicles]]'' that Charles's uncles were content to allow the frivolities because "so long as the Queen and the [[Duc d'Orléans]] danced, they were not dangerous or even annoying".&lt;ref&gt;qtd. in Tuchman (1978), 503&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Bal des Ardents'' and aftermath ==
[[File:Fire carles6.jpg|thumb|300px|''Bal des Ardents'' by the [[Master of Anthony of Burgundy]] (c. 1470s), showing a dancer in the wine vat in the foreground, Charles huddling under the Duchess of Berry's skirt at middle left, and burning dancers in the center]]
On 28&amp;nbsp;January 1393, Isabeau held a [[Masquerade ball|masquerade]] at the [[Hôtel Saint-Pol]] to celebrate the third marriage of her lady-in-waiting, Catherine de Fastaverin.&lt;ref name="V89–91" /&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Michel Pintoin|The Monk of St Denis]] claimed the woman had been widowed three times, making it her fourth marriage. See Veenstra, 90&lt;/ref&gt; Tuchman explains that a widow's remarriage was traditionally an occasion for mockery and tomfoolery, often celebrated with a ''[[charivari]]'' characterized by "all sorts of licence, disguises, disorders, and loud blaring of discordant music and clanging of cymbals".&lt;ref name="T503"&gt;Tuchman (1978), 503&lt;/ref&gt; On the suggestion of Huguet de Guisay, whom Tuchman describes as well known for his "outrageous schemes" and cruelty, six high-ranking knights performed a dance in costume as [[wild men|wood savages]]. The costumes, which were sewn onto the men, were made of [[linen]] soaked with [[resin]] to which [[flax]] was attached "so that they appeared shaggy and hairy from head to foot".&lt;ref name="T504" /&gt; Masks made of the same materials covered the dancers' faces and hid their identities from the audience. Some chronicles report that the dancers were bound together by chains. Most of the audience were unaware that Charles was among the dancers. Strict orders forbade the lighting of hall torches and prohibited anyone from entering the hall with a torch during the performance, to minimize the risk of the highly flammable costumes catching fire.&lt;ref name="T504" /&gt;

According to historian Jan Veenstra the men capered and howled "like wolves", spat obscenities and invited the audience to guess their identities while dancing in a "diabolical" frenzy.&lt;ref name="V91"&gt;Veenstra (1997), 91&lt;/ref&gt; Charles's brother Orléans arrived with Phillipe de Bar, late and drunk, and they entered the hall carrying lit torches. Accounts vary, but Orléans may have held his torch above a dancer's mask to reveal his identity when a spark fell, setting fire to the dancer's leg.&lt;ref name="T504" /&gt; In the 17th century, [[William Prynne]] wrote of the incident that "the Duke of Orleance&amp;nbsp;... put one of the Torches his servants held so neere the flax, that he set one of the Coates on fire, and so each of them set fire on to the other, and so they were all in a bright flame",&lt;ref&gt;qtd. in MacKay (2011), 167&lt;/ref&gt; whereas a contemporary chronicle stated that he "threw" the torch at one of the dancers.&lt;ref name="V89–91"&gt;Veenstra (1997), 89–91&lt;/ref&gt;

Isabeau, knowing that her husband was one of the dancers, fainted when the men caught fire. Charles, however, was standing at a distance from the other dancers, near his 15-year-old aunt [[Joan II, Countess of Auvergne|Joan, Duchess of Berry]], who swiftly threw her [[Train (clothing)|voluminous skirt]] over him to protect him from the sparks.&lt;ref name="T504"/&gt; Sources disagree as to whether the duchess moved into the dance and drew the King aside to speak to him, or whether the King moved away toward the audience. Froissart wrote that "The King, who proceeded ahead of [the dancers], departed from his companions&amp;nbsp;... and went to the ladies to show himself to them&amp;nbsp;... and so passed by the Queen and came near the Duchess of Berry".&lt;ref&gt;Stock (2004) 159–160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="H241ff"&gt;Heckscher, 241&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles VI Bal des Ardents detail.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Detail of the [[Joan II, Countess of Auvergne|Duchess of Berry]], wearing a high conical [[hennin]], covering a costumed Charles with the [[Train (clothing)|train]] of her dress]]

The scene soon descended into chaos; the dancers shrieked in pain as they burned in their costumes, and the audience, many of them also sustaining burns, screamed as they tried to rescue the burning men.&lt;ref name="T504"&gt;Tuchman (1979), 503–505&lt;/ref&gt; The event was chronicled in uncharacteristic vividness by [[Michel Pintoin|the Monk of St Denis]], who wrote that "four men were burned alive, their flaming genitals dropping to the floor&amp;nbsp;... releasing a stream of blood".&lt;ref name="V91"/&gt; Only two dancers survived: the King, thanks to the quick reactions of the Duchess of Berry, and the Sieur de [[Nantouillet]], who jumped into an open vat of wine and remained there until the flames were extinguished. The Count de [[Joigny]] died at the scene; [[Yvain de Foix]], son of [[Gaston III, Count of Foix|Gaston Fébus, Count of Foix]], and Aimery Poitiers, son of the [[Count of Valentinois]], lingered with painful burns for two days. The instigator of the affair, Huguet de Guisay, survived a day longer, described by Tuchman as bitterly "cursing and insulting his fellow dancers, the dead and the living, until his last hour".&lt;ref name="T504" /&gt;

The citizens of Paris, angered by the event and at the danger posed to their monarch, blamed Charles's advisors. A "great commotion" swept through the city as the populace threatened to depose Charles's uncles and kill dissolute and depraved courtiers. Greatly concerned at the popular outcry and worried about a repeat of the [[Harelle|Maillotin revolt]] of the previous decade—when Parisians armed with mallets turned against tax collectors—Charles's uncles persuaded the court to do penance at [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral]], preceded by an apologetic [[royal progress]] through the city in which the King rode on horseback with his uncles walking in humility. Orléans, who was blamed for the tragedy, donated funds in atonement for a chapel to be built at the [[Celestines|Celestine]] monastery.&lt;ref name="T504" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tuchman (1978), 380&lt;/ref&gt;

Froissart's chronicle of the event places blame directly on Charles's brother, Orléans. He wrote: "And thus the feast and marriage celebrations ended with such great sorrow&amp;nbsp;... [Charles] and [Isabeau] could do nothing to remedy it. We must accept that it was no fault of theirs but of the duke of Orléans."&lt;ref&gt;qtd. in Nara (2002), 237&lt;/ref&gt; Orléans' reputation was severely damaged by the event, compounded by an episode a few years earlier in which he was accused of sorcery after hiring an [[apostate]] monk to imbue a ring, dagger and sword with demonic magic. The theologian [[Jean Petit (theologian)|Jean Petit]] later testified that Orléans practiced sorcery, and that the fire at the dance represented a failed attempt at regicide made in retaliation for Charles's attack the previous summer.&lt;ref&gt;Veenstra (1997), 60, 91, 95&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Bal des Ardents'' added to the impression of a court steeped in extravagance, with a king in delicate health and unable to rule. Charles's attacks of illness increased in frequency such that by the end of the 1390s his role was merely ceremonial. By the early 15th century he was neglected and often forgotten, a lack of leadership that contributed to the decline and fragmentation of the [[House of Valois|Valois]] dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (2006), 88; Tuchman (1978), 515–516&lt;/ref&gt; In 1407, Philip the Bold's son, [[John the Fearless]], had his cousin Orléans assassinated because of "vice, corruption, sorcery, and a long list of public and private villainies"; at the same time Isabeau was accused of having been the mistress of her husband's brother.&lt;ref&gt;Tuchman (1978), 516&lt;/ref&gt; Orléans's assassination pushed the country into a [[Armagnac–Burgundian Civil War|civil war]] between the [[Burgundian (party)|Burgundians]] and the [[Armagnac (party)|Orléanists]] (known as the Armagnacs), which lasted for several decades. The vacuum created by the lack of central power and the general irresponsibility of the French court resulted in it gaining a reputation for lax morals and decadence that endured for more than 200 years.&lt;ref&gt;Tuchman (1978), 516, 537–538&lt;/ref&gt;

== Folkloric and Christian representations of wild men ==
{{main|Wild man}}

[[File:ADurerWoodwoses1499.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Wild men, or ''[[wodewose]]s'', depicted by [[Albrecht Dürer]] (1499)]]

Veenstra writes in ''Magic and Divination at the Courts of Burgundy and France'' that the ''Bal des Ardents'' reveals the tension between Christian beliefs and the latent [[paganism]] that existed in 14th-century society. According to him, the event "laid bare a great cultural struggle with the past but also became an ominous foreshadowing of the future."&lt;ref name="V91"/&gt;

[[Wild man|Wild men]] or savages—usually depicted carrying staves or clubs, living beyond the bounds of civilization without shelter or fire, lacking feelings and souls—were then a metaphor for man without God.&lt;ref name="Centerwell"&gt;Centerwell (1997), 27–28&lt;/ref&gt; Common superstition held that long-haired wild men, known as ''lutins'', who danced to firelight either to conjure demons or as part of fertility rituals, lived in mountainous areas such as the [[Pyrenees]]. In some village ''charivaris'' at harvest or planting time dancers dressed as wild men, to represent demons, were ceremonially captured and then an effigy of them was symbolically burnt to appease evil spirits. The church, however, considered these rituals pagan and demonic.&lt;ref name="Veenstra, 92ff"/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Early medieval folk festivals in Germany and Switzerland included a ritual called the "Expulsion of Death", often performed on the fourth Sunday in Lent, also known as ''Todten-Sonntag'' ("Sunday of the Dead"). An effigy was "killed" by burning, with the fragments scattered on fields as a fertility ritual. As early as the 8th century in [[Saxony]] and [[Thuringen]] in Germany a ritual was performed in which a ''pfingstl''—a leaf- and moss-clad villager representing a wild man—was ceremonially hunted and killed. Chambers (1996 ed.), 183–185&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manuscript 7 104v picture.jpg|thumb|upright|Wild men depicted in the borders of a late 14th-century [[book of hours]] ]]

Veenstra explains that it was believed that by dressing as wild men, villagers ritualistically "conjured demons by imitating them"—although at that period [[penitential]]s forbade a belief in wild men or an imitation of them, such as the costumed dance at Isabeau's event. In folkloric rituals the "burning did not happen literally but in ''effigie''", he writes,  "contrary to the ''Bal des Ardents'' where the seasonal fertility rite had watered down to courtly entertainment, but where burning had been promoted to a dreadful reality." A 15th-century chronicle describes the ''Bal des Ardents'' as ''una corea procurance demone'' ("a dance to ward off the devil").&lt;ref&gt;Veenstra (1997), 94&lt;/ref&gt;

Because remarriage was often thought to be a sacrilege—common belief (contrary to the Gospel – Luke 20:27–40 and Matthew 22:29–30) was that the sacrament of marriage extended beyond death—it was censured by the community. Thus the purpose of the Bal des Ardents was twofold: to entertain the court and to humiliate and rebuke Isabeau's lady-in-waiting—in an inherently pagan manner, which the Monk of St Denis seemed to dislike.&lt;ref name="Veenstra, 92ff"&gt;Veenstra (1997), 92–94&lt;/ref&gt; A ritual burning on the wedding night of a woman who was remarrying had Christian origins as well, according to Veenstra. The [[Book of Tobit]] partly concerns a woman who had seven husbands murdered by the demon [[Asmodeus]]; she is eventually freed of the demon by the burning of the heart and liver of a fish.&lt;ref name="Veenstra, 92ff"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Veenstra (1997), 67&lt;/ref&gt;

The event also may have served as a symbolic exorcism of Charles's mental illness at a time when magicians and sorcerers were commonly consulted by members of the court. In the early 15th century, ritual burning of evil, demonic, or [[Satan]]ic forces was not uncommon as shown by Orléans's later persecution of the King's physician Jehan de Bar, who was burned to death after confessing, under torture, to practicing sorcery.&lt;ref name="Veenstra, 92ff"/&gt;

== Chronicles ==
The death of four members of the nobility was sufficiently important to ensure that the event was recorded in contemporary chronicles, most notably by Froissart and the Monk of St Denis, and subsequently illustrated in a number of copies of [[illuminated manuscript]]s. While the two main chroniclers agree on essential points of the evening—the dancers were dressed as wild men, the King survived, one man fell into a vat, and four of the dancers died—there are discrepancies in the details. Froissart wrote that the dancers were chained together, which is not mentioned in the monk's account. Furthermore, the two chroniclers are at odds regarding the purpose of the dance. According to the historian Susan Crane, the monk describes the event as a wild ''charivari'' with the audience participating in the dance, whereas Froissart's description suggests a theatrical performance without audience participation.&lt;ref name ="Crane155ff"&gt;Crane (2002), 155–159&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bal des ardents 1483.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Miniature titled "Fire at a masked dance" from [[Froissart's Chronicles|Froissart's ''Chronicles'']], by the Master of the Getty Froissart (c. 1483, [[Bruges]])]]

Froissart wrote about the event in Book IV of his ''Chronicles'' (covering the years 1389 to 1440), an account described by scholar Katerina Nara as full of "a sense of pessimism", as Froissart "did not approve of all he recorded".&lt;ref&gt;qtd. in Nara (2002), 230&lt;/ref&gt; Froissart blamed Orléans for the tragedy,&lt;ref&gt;Nara (2002), 237&lt;/ref&gt; and the monk blamed the instigator, de Guisay, whose reputation for treating low-born servants like animals earned him such universal hatred that "the Nobles rejoiced at his agonizing death".&lt;ref&gt;Crane (2002), 157&lt;/ref&gt;

The Monk wrote of the event in the ''Histoire de Charles VI'' (''History of Charles VI''), covering about 25 years of the King's reign.&lt;ref&gt;Guenée, Bernard. (1994). [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/bec_0373-6237_1994_num_152_2_450736 "Documents insérés et documents abrégés dans la Chronique du religieux de Saint- Denis"]. ''Bibliothèque de l'école des chartes''.  Vol. 152, No. 2, 375–428. Retrieved April 18, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He seemed to disapprove&lt;ref group=note&gt;The Monk described the event as "contrary to all decency". See Tuchman (1978), 504&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds that the event broke social mores and the King's conduct was unbecoming, whereas Froissart described it as a celebratory event.&lt;ref name ="Crane155ff"/&gt;

[[File:Bal des Ardents Harley manuscript detail.jpg|thumb|Detail of the Harley Froissart manuscript (c. 1470–72), double-column French written in a [[Blackletter|Gothic script]] with decorative border&lt;ref name= "BL"/&gt;]]

Scholars are unsure whether either chronicler was present that evening. According to Crane, Froissart wrote of the event about five years later, and the monk about ten. Veenstra speculates that the monk may have been an eyewitness (as he was for much of Charles VI's reign) and that his account is the more accurate of the two.&lt;ref name ="Crane155ff"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Veenstra (1997), 22&lt;/ref&gt; The monk's chronicle is generally accepted as essential for understanding the King's court, however his neutrality may have been affected by his pro-Burgundian and anti-Orléanist stance, causing him to depict the royal couple in a negative manner.&lt;ref&gt;Adams (2010), 124&lt;/ref&gt; A third account was written in the mid-15th century by [[Jean Juvenal des Ursins]] in his biography of Charles, ''L'Histoire de Charles VI: roy de France'', not published until 1614.&lt;ref&gt;Curry (2000), 128; Famiglietti (1995), 505&lt;/ref&gt;

The Froissart manuscript dating from between 1470 and 1472 from the [[Harleian Collection]] held at the [[British Library]] includes a miniature depicting the event, titled "Dance of the Wodewoses", attributed to an unknown painter referred to as the Master of the Harley Froissart.&lt;ref name= "BL"&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/record.asp?MSID=7232&amp;CollID=8&amp;NStart=4380 "Catalogue of Illuminated Manuscripts"]. British Library.

'''Charles''' "'''Chuck'''" '''Stuart''' (December 18, 1959 – January 4, 1990) was an American suspect in a 1989 Boston area murder that generated national headlines. Stuart falsely alleged that his wife and unborn child were shot and killed by an African-American assailant. Stuart's brother confessed to police that Stuart himself killed them to collect life insurance, and Stuart subsequently died by [[suicide]].

==Murders==
In 1989, Stuart was serving as the general manager for Edward F. Kakas &amp; Sons, furriers on [[Newbury Street]]. Stuart's wife, Carol (née DiMaiti, born March 26, 1959, in Boston), was a tax attorney, and pregnant with the couple's first child.&lt;ref name=Englade02-05&gt;{{cite book|last=Englade|first=Ken|title=Murder in Boston|year=1990|publisher=Saint Martin's|location=New York|pages=2–5|isbn=0-312-92396-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 23, the couple were driving through the [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]] neighborhood after attending childbirth classes at [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]].&lt;ref name=Englade02-05/&gt; According to Stuart's subsequent statement, a black gunman with a raspy voice forced his way into their car at a stoplight, ordered them to drive to nearby [[Mission Hill, Boston|Mission Hill]], robbed them, then shot Charles in the stomach and Carol in the head. Stuart then drove away, despite his injuries, and called [[9-1-1|911]] on his car phone.

On the night of the crime, the [[CBS]] [[reality television]] series ''[[Rescue 911]]'' was riding with [[Boston Emergency Medical Services]] personnel. The crew took dramatic footage of the couple being extricated from the car: Carol can be seen "in profile, her pregnancy prominent, being wheeled to the ambulance."&lt;ref name=Englade245-249&gt;Englade, pp. 245–249.&lt;/ref&gt; Other footage included Charles Stuart straining to speak with ambulance workers, and graphic scenes of his rushed entry to the hospital's emergency room.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Carol Stuart died just hours after the shooting, at approximately 3:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. on October 24.&lt;ref name=Englade19&gt;Englade, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Her funeral took place four days later at St. James Church in her native [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]].&lt;ref&gt;Englade, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before her death, doctors delivered her baby by caesarean section, two months premature. Baptized in the intensive care unit, the child was given the name Christopher, according to Charles and Carol's prior wishes.&lt;ref name=Englade19/&gt; Christopher had suffered trauma and oxygen deprivation during the shooting, and died seventeen days later.&lt;ref&gt;Englade, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; A private funeral service was held for Christopher on November 20, 1989. Both Carol and Christopher are buried under Carol's maiden name.&lt;ref&gt;Englade, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigation===
[[Boston Police Department|Boston Police]] searched for suspects based on Stuart's description of the assailant. ''The Washington Post'' described the situation: “The city's anger seems inexhaustible. That may be because it is impossible not to feel sullied by the Stuart case. Either one was duped by a fabrication with racist overtones, or one was impotent as police focused their investigation on a succession of innocent black men.” Meanwhile, Stuart himself was hospitalized for six weeks; the severity of his injuries required two operations, and Stuart's surgeon did not suspect that the nearly fatal wounds were self-inflicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/11/us/confusion-grows-over-boston-murder.html|title=Confusion Grows Over Boston Murder|last=Butterfield|first=Fox|date=1990-01-11|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Police found a young man, Willie Bennett, who fit Stuart's description. On December 28, Stuart identified Bennett as his attacker in a lineup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=erlQKHmjZz0C&amp;lpg=PT327&amp;ots=uASz3vQ57h&amp;dq=charles%20stuart%20self-inflicted&amp;pg=PT327#v=onepage&amp;q=charles%20stuart%20self-inflicted&amp;f=false|title=The Dynamics of Murder: Kill or Be Killed|last=Flowers|first=R. Barri|date=2013-03-21|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781466588752|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case against Bennett abruptly collapsed on January 3, 1990, when Charles Stuart's brother Matthew identified Charles as Carol's killer. Matthew admitted that he had driven to meet Stuart that night to help him commit what he had been told was to be an insurance fraud. Upon arrival, Matthew said that he had seen that Carol had been shot, and that his brother had shot himself to make it appear as a carjacking. Matthew took the gun and a bag of valuables, including the couple's wedding rings, and threw them off the Pines River Bridge in [[Revere, Massachusetts|Revere]]. Some of the items, including the gun, were later recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20116595,00.html|title=A Cold Killer's Chilling Charade|author1=Bill Hewitt |author2=Dirk Mathison |author3=S. Avery Brown |author4=Gayle Verner |author5=Stephen Sawicki |author6=Sue Carswell |date=January 22, 2009| work=People}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Stuart had blamed the incident on an [[African-American]] male, and the information provided by his brother led the police to conclude this was not true, racial tensions were heightened in [[Boston]] for a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/15/us/boston-tragedy-stuart-case-special-case-motive-remains-mystery-deaths-that-haunt.html|title=Motive Remains a Mystery In Deaths That Haunt a City| first1=Fox | last1= Butterfield| first2=Constance L. |last2= Hays |date=January 15, 1990|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible motives===
Police later learned that Stuart had been upset at the prospect of becoming a father, particularly worried that his wife would not go back to work and their financial status would be diminished. Stuart had also started some sort of relationship with Deborah Allen, an employee at Kakas &amp; Sons, though Allen denied any romantic involvement.&lt;ref name=gunfound&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/10/us/gun-that-may-be-stuart-s-is-found.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|title=Gun That May Be Stuart's Is Found|publisher=The New York Times|date=January 10, 1990|accessdate=March 29, 2012|last=Butterfield|first=Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' reported that a $480,000 check was issued to Charles Stuart in payment for a life insurance policy on his wife, but no such check was ever found. The television show ''Cold Blood'' reported and confirmed that Charles received a $100,000 life insurance check which he cashed just after being discharged from the hospital. Stuart also bought a new [[Nissan Maxima]] for $16,000 in cash.

===Suicide===

On January 4, 1990, hours after his brother Matthew revealed the truth to police, Charles met with his lawyer.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}  Shortly afterward, Stuart's car was found abandoned on the [[Tobin Bridge]] in [[Chelsea, Massachusetts|Chelsea]]. A note was found in Stuart's car, stating that he was "beaten" by the "new accusations" and was "sapped of [his] strength." &lt;ref name="suicidenote"&gt;{{cite news|title=Report: Suicide note contained no confession|agency=Associated Press|date=February 1, 1993|publisher=Nashua Telegraph|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&amp;dat=19930201&amp;id=u2dKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=35MMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3691,36049|accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stuart's body was found in the [[Mystic River]] the next day.&lt;ref name=brotherindicted&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/27/us/charles-stuart-s-brother-indicted-in-murder-case.html|publisher=The New York Times|date=September 27, 1991|accessdate=March 29, 2012|title=Charles Stuart's Brother Indicted In Murder Case|last=Butterfield|first=Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators later discovered that Stuart had previously expressed a desire to kill his wife.&lt;ref name=gunfound /&gt;

In 1991, Matthew Stuart was indicted for [[obstruction of justice]] and [[insurance fraud]] for his role in covering up the crime. An associate of Matthew, John McMahon, was also indicted as an accessory to murder.&lt;ref name="brotherindicted" /&gt; Stuart pleaded guilty in 1992 and was sentenced to three to five years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guilty Plea in Fraud That Led to Boston Slaying|last=Butterfield|first=Fox|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 3, 1992|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/03/us/guilty-plea-in-fraud-that-led-to-boston-slaying.html|accessdate=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released on parole in 1997, but was later rearrested for cocaine trafficking.&lt;ref name=sheltertoinvestigate&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.boston.com/2011-09-07/news/30123884_1_charles-stuart-drug-overdose-homeless-shelter|publisher=Boston Globe|date=September 7, 2011|accessdate=March 29, 2012|title=Shelter to investigate Stuart death|last=Guilfoil|first=John}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 3, 2011, Matthew Stuart was found dead from an apparent drug overdose in Heading Home, a homeless shelter in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stuart Found Dead in Shelter|last1=Guilfoil|first1=John M.|last2=Irons|first2=Meghan|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=September 4, 2011|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2011/09/04/brother_of_charles_stuart_found_dead_at_cambridge_homeless_shelter/?p1=News_links|accessdate=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorial fund==

In Carol DiMaiti's memory, her family established the Carol DiMaiti Stuart Foundation to provide scholarship aid to Mission Hill residents.&lt;ref name=Englade231-233&gt;Englade, pp. 231–233.&lt;/ref&gt; By early 2006, the foundation had awarded $1.2 million to 220 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date =January 21, 2006 |title=Evelyn DiMaiti, reached out to help many after loss; at 74|newspaper =The Boston Globe|url  =http://www.boston.com/news/globe/obituaries/articles/2006/01/21/evelyn_dimaiti_reached_out_to_help_many_after_loss_at_74/||accessdate=February 3, 2012 | first=Gloria | last=Negri}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DiMaitis' attorney, Marvin Geller,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=White Boston Family Sets Up Scholarship to Ease Racial Tension |journal=Jet |date=February 12, 1990|page=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; explained to the press: "Carol would not want to be remembered as the victim of a sensational murder, but rather as a woman who left behind a legacy of healing and compassion."&lt;ref name=Englade231-233/&gt;

{{Christian culture}}
'''Christian drama''' is based on [[Christianity|Christian]] religious themes.

== Mystery play ==
{{Main|Mystery play}}
Through the medieval period churches in Europe frequently performed mystery plays, retelling the stories of the Bible. They developed from the representation of [[Bible]] stories in [[church (building)|churches]] with accompanying song. As these liturgical plays became more popular, more vernacular or everyday elements were introduced and non-clergy began to participate. As the dramas became increasingly secular, they began to be performed entirely in the vernacular and were moved out of the churches by the 13th or 14th century.

These religious performances were taken over by the [[guild]]s, with each guild taking responsibility for a particular piece of scriptural history. From the guild control they gained the name mystery play. The mystery play developed into a series of plays dealing with all the major events in the Christian calendar, from the [[Genesis creation narrative|Creation]] to the [[Day of Judgment]]. By the end of the 15th century, the tradition of acting these plays in cycles on festival days (such as the [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Feast of Corpus Christi]]) was established across Europe.

== Morality play ==
{{Main|Morality play}}
By the 15th and 16th century the form had developed into the morality play. These were allegories, in which the protagonists met personifications of various moral attributes, the net effect being the encouragement to live a virtuous life.

== Puritan age ==
{{further|Puritan}}{{See also|Antitheatricality}}
In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries theatre was generally seen as wicked, and the church made attempts to suppress it. In the United States condemnation of the theatre was widespread in the eighteenth century; in 1794 President [[Timothy Dwight IV]] of [[Yale College]] in his "Essay on the Stage" declared that "to indulge a taste for playgoing means nothing more or less than the loss of that most valuable treasure: the immortal soul."

== Modern ==
In the twentieth century churches, particularly evangelical churches, rediscovered the use of theatre as a form of outreach and as a valid art form.

In [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in the early twentieth century it was illegal for any human actor to portray a divine personage on stage, placing severe restrictions on Christian theatre. The groundbreaking 1941-1942 [[radio drama]] ''[[The Man Born to be King]]'' shattered this taboo by not only including [[Jesus]] as a character but giving him 'ordinary' speech rather than 'biblical' language. (Radio portrayals were not covered by the law, but the piece drew huge complaints nonetheless.)

[[T. S. Eliot]]'s play ''[[Murder in the Cathedral]]'' explored Christian themes of martyrdom and sacrifice as well as church history.

In the 1960s many plays were produced dealing with Christian subjects, notably [[Jesus Christ Superstar]] and [[Godspell]]. At approximately the same time many churches were again turning to drama as a means of outreach, and as a valid art form. Small Christian theatre companies began to spring up in Britain and America. Plays such as ''[[Heaven's Gates, Hell's Flames]]'' were used for evangelism.  [[Covenant Players]] was founded in 1963 to produce Christian plays written by its founder.

In [[law and economics]], the '''Coase theorem''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|s}}) describes the [[Efficiency (economics)|economic efficiency]] of an economic [[Economic system|allocation]] or outcome in the presence of [[externality|externalities]]. The theorem states that if trade in an externality is possible and there are sufficiently low [[transaction costs]], bargaining will lead to a [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto efficient]] outcome regardless of the initial allocation of property. In practice, obstacles to bargaining or poorly defined property rights can prevent Coasian bargaining. This "theorem" is commonly attributed to [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] winner [[Ronald Coase]] during his tenure at the [[London School of Economics]], [[SUNY at Buffalo]], [[University of Virginia]], and [[University of Chicago]].

This 1960 paper, along with his 1937 paper on [[The Nature of the Firm|the nature of the firm]] (which also emphasizes the role of transaction costs), earned [[Ronald Coase]] the 1991 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]]. In this 1960 paper, Coase argued that real-world transaction costs are rarely low enough to allow for efficient bargaining and hence the theorem is almost always inapplicable to economic reality. Since then, others have demonstrated the importance of the [[perfect information]] assumption and shown using [[game theory]] that inefficient outcomes are to be expected when this assumption is not met.

In his later writings, Coase expressed frustration that his theorem was often misunderstood.  Although some have used Coase's analysis to argue that because transaction costs are never zero it is always appropriate for a government to intervene and regulate, Coase believed that economists and politicians "tended to over-estimate the advantages which come from governmental regulation."{{sfnp|Coase|1960|p=18}}  Some mistakenly understood the theorem to mean that markets would always achieve efficient results when transaction costs were low, when in reality his point was almost the exact opposite: because transaction costs are never zero, it cannot be assumed that any institutional arrangement will necessarily be efficient. Therefore, Coase argued that it is important to always compare alternative institutional arrangements to see which would come closest to "the unattainable ideal of the (mythical) world of zero transaction costs."{{sfnp|Merrill|Smith|2017|p=38}}

Nevertheless, the Coase theorem is considered an important basis for most modern economic analyses of government [[regulation]], especially in the case of externalities, and it has been used by jurists and legal scholars to analyse and resolve legal disputes. [[George Stigler]] summarized the resolution of the externality problem in the absence of transaction costs in a 1966 economics [[textbook]] in terms of private and [[Social cost|social]] cost, and for the first time called it a "theorem." Since the 1960s, a voluminous amount of literature on the Coase theorem and its various interpretations, proofs, and criticism has developed and continues to grow.

==The theorem==
Coase developed his theorem when considering the regulation of [[radio frequencies]]. Competing radio stations could use the same frequencies and would therefore interfere with each other's broadcasts. The problem faced by regulators was how to eliminate interference and allocate frequencies to radio stations efficiently. What Coase proposed in 1959 was that as long as [[property rights]] in these frequencies were well defined, it ultimately did not matter if adjacent [[radio station]]s interfered with each other by broadcasting in the same frequency band. Furthermore, it did not matter to whom the property rights were granted. His reasoning was that the station able to reap the higher economic gain from broadcasting would have an [[incentive]] to pay the other station not to interfere. In the absence of transaction costs, both stations would strike a mutually advantageous deal. It would not matter which station had the initial right to broadcast; eventually, the right to broadcast would end up with the party that was able to put it to the most highly valued use. Of course, the parties themselves would care who was granted the rights initially because this allocation would impact their wealth, but the end result of who broadcasts would not change because the parties would trade to the outcome that was overall most efficient. This counterintuitive insight—that the initial imposition of legal entitlement is irrelevant because the parties will eventually reach the same result—is Coase’s invariance thesis.

Coase's main point, clarified in his article '[[The Problem of Social Cost]],' published in 1960 and cited when he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in 1991, was that transaction costs, however, could not be neglected, and therefore, the initial allocation of property rights often mattered. As a result, one [[normative]] conclusion sometimes drawn from the Coase theorem is that liability should initially be assigned to the actors for whom avoiding the costs associated with the externality problem are the lowest.{{Clarify|date=March 2016}} The problem in real life is that nobody knows [[ex ante]] the most valued use of a resource, and also that there exist costs involving the reallocation of resources by government. Another, more refined, normative conclusion also often discussed in [[law and economics]] is that government should create institutions that minimize transaction costs, so as to allow misallocations of resources to be corrected as cheaply as possible.
* Version 1: A clear delineation of private property rights is an essential prelude to market transactions.
* Version 2: As long as private property rights are well defined under zero transaction cost, exchange will eliminate divergence and lead to efficient use of resources or highest valued use of resources.
* Version 3: The allocation of resources is invariant to the assignment of private property rights under zero transaction cost and zero income effect.

==Efficiency and invariance==
Because Ronald Coase himself did not originally intend to set forth any one particular theorem, it has largely been the effort of others who have developed the loose formulation of the Coase theorem. What Coase initially provided was fuel in the form of “counterintuitive insight”&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Halpin, "Disproving the Coase Theorem?", 23 Econ. &amp; Phil. 321, 325–27 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; that externalities necessarily involved more than a single party engaged in conflicting activities and must be treated as a reciprocal problem. His work explored the relationship between the parties and their conflicting activities and the role of assigned rights/liabilities. While the exact definition of the Coase theorem remains unsettled, there are two issues or claims within the theorem: the results will be efficient and the results in terms of resource allocation will be the same regardless of initial assignments of rights/liabilities.

===Efficiency version: aside from transaction costs, the prevailing outcome will be efficient===
The zero transaction cost condition is taken to mean that there are no impediments to bargaining. Since any inefficient allocation leaves unexploited contractual opportunities, the allocation cannot be a contractual equilibrium.

===Invariance version: aside from transaction costs, the same efficient outcome will prevail===
This version fits the legal cases cited by Coase. If it is more efficient to prevent cattle trampling a farmer's fields by fencing in the farm, rather than fencing in the cattle, the outcome of bargaining will be the fence around the farmer's fields, regardless of whether victim rights or unrestricted grazing-rights prevail. Subsequent authors have shown that this version of the theorem is not generally true, however. Changing liability placement changes wealth distribution, which in turn affects demand and prices.&lt;ref&gt;Varian, H 1987 ''Intermediate Microeconomics''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equivalence version==
In his UCLA dissertation and in subsequent work, [[Steven N. S. Cheung]] (1969) coined an extension of the Coase theorem: aside from transaction costs, all institutional forms are capable of achieving the same efficient allocation. Contracts, extended markets, and corrective taxation are equally capable of internalizing an externality. To be logically correct, some restrictive assumptions are needed. First, spillover effects must be bilateral. This applies to the cases that Coase investigated. Cattle trample a farmer's fields; a building blocks sunlight to a neighbor's swimming pool; a confectioner disturbs a dentist's patients etc. In each case the source of the externality is matched with a particular victim. It does not apply to pollution generally, since there are typically multiple victims. Equivalence also requires that each institution has equivalent property rights. Victim rights in contract law correspond to victim entitlements in extended markets and to the polluter pays principle in taxation.&lt;ref&gt;Johansson, P. and J. Roumasset, ''Apples, Bees and Contracts: A Coase-Cheung Theorem for Positive Spillover Effects.'' World Economic Forum, Shanghai: Dec. 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding these restrictive assumptions, the equivalence version helps to underscore the [[Arthur C. Pigou#Academic work|Pigouvian]] fallacies &lt;ref&gt;Pigou, Arthur C., ''The Economics of Welfare'', 4th edition. London: Macmillan and Co. 1932&lt;/ref&gt; that motivated Coase. Pigouvian taxation is revealed as not the only way to internalize an externality. Market and contractual institutions should also be considered, as well as corrective subsidies. The equivalence theorem also is a springboard for Coase's primary achievement—providing the pillars for the New Institutional Economics. First, the Coasean maximum-value solution becomes a benchmark by which institutions can be compared. And the institutional equivalence result establishes the motive for comparative institutional analysis and suggests the means by which institutions can be compared (according to their respective abilities to economize on transaction costs). The equivalency result also underlies Coase's (1937) proposition that the boundaries of the firm are chosen to minimize transaction costs. Aside from the "marketing costs" of using outside suppliers and the [[agency cost]]s of central direction inside the firm, whether to put Fisher Body inside or outside of General Motors would have been a matter of indifference.

==Application in United States contract and tort law==
The Coase Theorem has been used by [[jurists]] and legal scholars in the analysis and resolution of disputes involving both [[contract law]] and [[tort law]].

In [[contract law]], Coase is often used as a method to evaluate the relative power of the parties during the negotiation and acceptance of a traditional or classical bargained-for contract.

In modern [[tort law]], application of economic analysis to assign liability for damages was popularized by Judge [[Learned Hand]] of the [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] in his decision, ''[[United States v. Carroll Towing Co.]]'' 159 F.2d 169 (2d. Cir. 1947). Judge Hand's holding resolved simply that [[legal liability|liability]] could be determined by applying the formula of B &lt; PL, where B = the burden (economic or otherwise) of adequate protection against foreseeable damages, P = the probability of damage (or loss) occurring and L = the gravity of the resulting injury (loss). This decision flung open the doors of economic analysis in [[tort]] cases, thanks in no small part to Judge Hand's popularity among legal scholars.

In resultant scholarship using economic models of analysis, prominently including the Coase theorem, theoretical models demonstrated that, when transaction costs are minimized or nonexistent, the legal appropriation of liability diminishes in importance or disappears completely. In other words, parties will arrive at an economically efficient solution that may ignore the legal framework in place.

==Examples==
===Damage from water runoff===
Two property owners own land on a mountainside. Property Owner A's land is upstream from Owner B and there is significant, damaging runoff from Owner A's land to Owner B's land. Four scenarios are considered:

# If a cause of action exists (i.e. B could sue A for damages and win) and the property damage equals $100 while the cost of building a wall to stop the runoff equals $50, the wall will probably exist. Owner A will  spend $50 and build the wall in order to prevent a court case where B could claim $100 in damages.
# If a cause of action exists and the damage equals $50 while the cost of a wall is $100, the wall will not exist. Owner B may sue, win the case and the court will order Owner A to pay B $50. This is cheaper than actually building the wall. Courts [[Specific performance|rarely order persons to do or not do actions]]: they prefer monetary awards.
# If a cause of action does not exist, and the damage equals $100 while the cost of the wall equals $50, the wall will exist. Even though B cannot win the lawsuit, he or she will pay A $50 to build the wall because the wall is less costly than the damages from the runoff.
# If a cause of action does not exist, and the damage equals $50 while the wall will cost $100, the wall will not exist. B cannot win the lawsuit and the economic realities of trying to get the wall built are prohibitive.

The Coase theorem considers all four of these outcomes logical because the economic incentives will be stronger than legal incentives. Pure or traditional legal analysis will expect that the wall will exist in both scenarios where B has a cause of action and that the wall will never exist if B has no cause of action.

===Planting pear trees===

The Jones family plants pear trees on their property which is adjacent to the Smith family. The Smith family gets an external benefit from the Jones family’s pear trees because they pick up whatever pears fall to the ground on their side of the property line. This is an externality because the Smith family does not pay the Jones family for utility received from gathering the fallen pears and, therefore, does not participate in the market transaction of pear production.  It results in the pears being underproduced, which means too few pear trees are planted.

Let's assume the following:

[[Image:Jonespeartree mbsch.JPG]]

Possible solutions to internalize the externality:

By applying the Coase Theorem two possible solutions arise for internalizing this externality. These solutions can occur because the positive external benefits are clearly identified and we assume that 1) transaction costs are low; 2) property rights are clearly defined.

After realizing that the Smith family gets utility from the Jones family’s pear trees, the Jones family thinks it is unfair that the Smiths get utility from picking up the pears that fall from their pear trees.  The first option to eliminate the externality could be to put up a net fence that will prevent pears from falling to the ground of the Smith’s side property line, which will automatically decrease the Smith family’s marginal benefit to 0.

The second option for the Jones could be to impose a cost on the Smith family if they want to continue to get utility from their pear trees. Say, if the Jones family has a MC of $25 for each pear tree produced, it allows them to plant 3 pear trees a year (Jones’ MB = MC). However, if the cost is imposed on the Smiths, the optimal quantity of pear trees produced a year will increase to 4  (Jones’ MB + Smiths’ MB = MC). By internalizing the externality, both the Smith family and the Jones family increase their overall utility by increasing production from 3 pear trees a year to 4. It should be noted that $5 is the maximum price the Smiths are willing to pay for an additional, fourth, pear tree, which implies their marginal benefit to plant a fifth pear tree is 0.

==Criticism==

=== Criticisms of the theorem ===
While most critics find fault with the applicability of the Coase Theorem, a critique of the theorem itself can be found in the work of the critical legal scholar [[Duncan Kennedy (legal philosopher)|Duncan Kennedy]], who argues that the initial allocation always matters in reality.&lt;ref name="DKennedy"&gt;{{Cite journal|year=1981|title=Cost-Benefit Analysis of Entitlement Problems: A Critique|url=http://duncankennedy.net/documents/Photo%20articles/Cost-Benefit%20Analysis%20of%20Entitlement%20Problems_A%20Critique.pdf|journal=Stanford Law Review|publisher=Stanford Law Review|volume=33|issue=3|pages=387–445|doi=10.2307/1228354|jstor=1228354|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|author=Kennedy, Duncan}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because psychological studies indicate that asking prices often exceed offer prices, due to the so-called [[endowment effect]]. Essentially, a person who already has an entitlement is likely to request more to give it up than would a person who started off without the entitlement. The validity of this theoretical critique in practice is addressed in a later section.

An additional critique of the theorem comes from [[New institutional economics|new institutional]] economist [[Steven N. S. Cheung]] thinks that private property rights are institutions that arise to reduce transaction costs. The existence of private property rights implies that transaction costs are non-zero. If transaction costs are really zero, any property rights system will result in identical and efficient resource allocation, and the assumption of private property rights is not necessary. Therefore, zero transaction costs and private property rights cannot logically coexist.

Lastly, using a game-theoretic model, it has been argued that sometimes it is easier to reach an agreement if the initial property rights are unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmitz|first=Patrick W.|date=2001|title=The Coase Theorem, Private Information, and the Benefits of Not Assigning Property Rights|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1008709628107|journal=European Journal of Law and Economics|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|pages=23–28|doi=10.1023/A:1008709628107|issn=0929-1261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticisms of the applicability of the theorem ===

====Transaction costs====
Ronald Coase's work itself emphasized a problem in applying the Coase theorem: transactions are "often extremely costly, sufficiently costly at any rate to prevent many transactions that would be carried out in a world in which the pricing system worked without cost." (Coase, 1960—first paragraph of section VI.) This isn't a criticism of the theorem itself, since the theorem considers only those situations in which there are no transaction costs. Instead, it is an objection to [[Applied economics|applications of the theorem]] that neglect this crucial assumption.

So, a key criticism is that the theorem is almost always inapplicable in economic reality, because real-world transaction costs are rarely low enough to allow for efficient bargaining. (That was the conclusion of Coase's original paper, making him the first 'critic' of using the theorem as a practical solution.) [[Neo-Keynesian economics|Neo-Keynesian]] economist [[James Meade]] argued that even in a simple case of a beekeeper's bees pollinating a nearby farmer's crops, Coasean bargaining is inefficient (though beekeepers and farmers do make contracts and have for some time).&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{Cite journal|year=1973|title=Meade, Bees and Externalities|journal=The Journal of Law and Economics|volume=16|issue=1|pages=35–52|doi=10.1086/466754|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|author=Johnson, David B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chicago school of economics|Chicago school]] [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalist]] economist [[David D. Friedman]] has argued that the fact that an "economist as distinguished as Meade assumed an externality problem was insoluble save for government intervention suggests...the range of problems to which the Coasean solution is relevant may be greater than many would at first guess."&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2000|title=Law's Order|publisher=Princeton Paperbacks|pages=41–42|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|author=Friedman, David D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friedman is scathing of most critical attacks on the Coase theorem.

In many cases of externalities, the parties might be a single large factory versus a thousand landowners nearby. In such situations, say the critics,  the transaction costs rise extraordinarily high due to the fundamental difficulties in bargaining with a large number of individuals.

However, transaction costs are not only a barrier for situations with large numbers of involved parties. Even in the simplest of situations, with only two individuals, social costs can increase transaction costs to  be unreasonably high so as to invalidate the applicability of Coasean bargaining. As economist [[Jonathan Gruber (economist)|Jonathan Gruber]] describes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Public Finance and Public Policy|last=Gruber|first=Jonathan|publisher=Worth Publishers|year=2016|isbn=978-1464143335|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are strong social norms that often prevent people from bargaining in most day-to-day situations. Whether it is the awkwardness of the exchange or the fear of greatly under-valuing someone else’s property rights, transaction costs can still be quite high even in the most basic interactions that could make use of the Coase Theorem.

====Assignment problem====

Gruber further describes three additional issues with attempting to apply the Coase Theorem to real-world situations. The first of these is known as the assignment problem, and stems from the fact that for most situations with externalities, it is extremely difficult to determine who may be responsible for the externality as well as who is actually affected by it. Take the case of a polluted river that reduces the fish population. How can the involved parties determine which factories may have contributed the pollution that specifically harmed the fish, or whether there were any natural factors that interfered in the process. And even if we can determine who exactly is responsible and who is harmed, it is incredibly cumbersome to accurately quantify these effects. People cannot easily translate their experiences to monetary values, and they are likely to overstate the harm they have suffered. At the same time, the polluters would likely underestimate the proportion of the externality that they are responsible for.

====Game-theoretic critique: hold-out, free-rider problems, complete information assumption====

Second, in situations where multiple parties hold the property rights, Coasean bargaining often fails because of the holdout problem. Once all the property owners except for one have accepted the Coasean solution, the last party is able to demand more compensation from the opposing party in order to part with the property right. Knowing this, the other property owners have the incentive to also demand more, leading to the unraveling of the bargaining process.

Lastly, if the side with only one party holds the property rights (so as to avoid the holdout problem), Coasean bargaining still fails because of the free-rider problem. When the multiple parties on the other side all benefit fairly equally from the results of the negotiations, then each of the parties has the incentive to free-ride, to withhold their payments and withdraw from the negotiations because they can still receive the benefits regardless of whether or not they contribute financially. Ellingsen and Paltseva (2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ellingsen|first=Tore|last2=Paltseva|first2=Elena|date=2016-04-01|title=Confining the Coase Theorem: Contracting, Ownership, and Free-Riding|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdw001|journal=The Review of Economic Studies|language=en|volume=83|issue=2|pages=547–586|doi=10.1093/restud/rdw001|issn=0034-6527}}&lt;/ref&gt; model contract negotiation games and show that the only way to avoid the free-rider problem in situations with multiple parties is to enforce mandatory participation (such as through the use of court orders).

In 2009, in their seminal JEI article, Hahnel and Sheeran highlight several major misinterpretations and common assumptions, which when accounted for substantially reduce the applicability of Coase's theorem to real world policy and economic problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hahnel|first=Robin|last2=Sheeran|first2=Kristen A.|date=2009|title=Misinterpreting the Coase Theorem|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2753/JEI0021-3624430110|journal=Journal of Economic Issues|volume=43|issue=1|pages=215–238|doi=10.2753/JEI0021-3624430110|issn=0021-3624}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, they recognize that the solution between a single polluter and single victim is a negotiation—not a market. As such, it is subject to the extensive work on [[Bargaining Problem|bargaining games]], [[negotiation]], and [[game theory]] (specifically a "divide the pie" game under incomplete information). This typically yields a broad range of potential negotiated solutions, making it unlikely that the efficient outcome will be the one selected. Rather it is more likely to be determined by a host of factors including the structure of the negotiations, discount rates and other factors of relative bargaining strength (cf. [[Ariel Rubenstein]]).

If the negotiation is not a single shot game, then reputation effects may also occur, which can dramatically distort outcomes and may even lead to failed negotiation (cf. [[David M. Kreps]], also the [[chainstore paradox]]). Second, the information assumptions required to apply Coase's theorem correctly to yield an efficient result are [[complete information]]—in other words that both sides lack private information, that their true costs are completely known not only to themselves but to each other, and that this knowledge state is also [[common knowledge]]. When this is not the case, Coasean solutions predictably yield highly inefficient results because of [[perverse incentive]]s—not "mere" transaction costs.

If the polluter has the ownership rights, it is incentivized to overstate its benefits from polluting, if the victim has the ownership rights, (s)he has the incentive to also misrepresent her/his damages. As a result, under incomplete information (probably the only state of knowledge for most real world negotiations), Coasean bargaining yields predictably inefficient results.

Hahnel and Sheeran emphasize that these failures are not due to behavioral issues or irrationality (although these are quite prevalent ([[ultimatum game]], [[cognitive biases]])), are not due to transaction costs (although these are also quite prevalent), and are not due to absorbing states and inability to pay. Rather, they are due to fundamental theoretical requirements of Coase's theorem (necessary conditions) that are typically grossly misunderstood, and that when not present systematically eliminate the ability of Coaseian approaches to obtain efficient outcomes—locking in inefficient ones. Hahnel and Sheeran conclude that it is highly unlikely that conditions required for an efficient Coaseian solution will exist in any real-world economic situations.

Unconstrained Coasean bargaining ex post may also lead to a [[hold-up problem]] ex ante. Thus, even though it is often claimed that Coasean bargaining is an alternative to Pigouvian taxation, it has been argued that in a hold-up situation Coasean bargaining may actually justify a [[Pigouvian tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenkranz|first=Stephanie|last2=Schmitz|first2=Patrick W.|date=2007|title=Can Coasean Bargaining Justify Pigouvian Taxation?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0335.2006.00556.x/abstract|journal=Economica|language=en|volume=74|issue=296|pages=573–585|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0335.2006.00556.x|issn=1468-0335}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Antràs|first=Pol|last2=Staiger|first2=Robert W|date=2012|title=Offshoring and the Role of Trade Agreements|url=http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/abs/10.1257/aer.102.7.3140|journal=American Economic Review|volume=102|issue=7|pages=3140–3183|doi=10.1257/aer.102.7.3140|issn=0002-8282}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it may be efficient to forbid renegotiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tirole|first=Jean|date=1999|title=Incomplete Contracts: Where do We Stand?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0262.00052/abstract|journal=Econometrica|language=en|volume=67|issue=4|pages=741–781|doi=10.1111/1468-0262.00052|issn=1468-0262|citeseerx=10.1.1.465.9450}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, there are situations in which a ban on contract renegotiation is not desirable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmitz|first=Patrick W.|date=2005|title=Should Contractual Clauses that Forbid Renegotiation Always be Enforced?|url=http://jleo.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/2/315|journal=Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization|language=en|volume=21|issue=2|pages=315–329|doi=10.1093/jleo/ewi019|issn=8756-6222}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Endowment Effect and Coase.jpg|right|369x369px]]

=== Behavioral criticisms of the Coase theorem ===
Unlike Hahnel and Sheeran, the economist [[Richard Thaler]] highlights the importance of [[behavioral economics]] in explaining the inability to effectively use the Coase Theorem in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Misbehaving|last=Thaler|first=Richard|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|year=2015|isbn=978-0393352795|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thaler modified his experiments with the Ultimatum game and showed that people were more likely to be concerned with ensuring fairness in negotiations when negotiating over their own tangible property rather than in an abstract sense. This suggests that in practice, people would not be willing to accept the efficient outcomes prescribed by the Coasean bargaining if they deem them to be unfair. So, while the Coase theorem suggests that parties who lose out on property rights should then pursue the property according to how much they value it, this does not often happen in reality. For example, Professor Ward Farnsworth has described how in the aftermath of twenty observed legal [[nuisance]] cases, none of the parties ever attempted to engage in Coasean bargaining (as would be expected to reach the most efficient outcome) because of anger at the unfairness of having to bargain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farnsworth|first=Ward|date=1999-01-01|title=Do Parties to Nuisance Cases Bargain after Judgment? A Glimpse inside the Cathedral|jstor=1600470|journal=The University of Chicago Law Review|volume=66|issue=2|pages=373–436|doi=10.2307/1600470}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that Coase and his defenders would simply view this as a non-pecuniary transaction cost, but that may be an unreasonable extension of the concept of transaction costs.

Thaler has also provided experimental evidence for the argument that initial allocations matter, put forth by Duncan Kennedy (as previously noted), among others. When students were trading cash-equivalent tokens, the negotiations resulted in the students who would receive the most cash from a token (as told by the researchers) holding the tokens, as would be predicted by the Coase Theorem. However, when the students were trading property (mugs in this case) that were not directly equivalent to cash, proper Coasean bargaining did not occur as depicted in the adjacent diagram. This is because people generally exhibit an [[endowment effect]], in which they value something more once they actually have possession of it. Thus, the Coase Theorem would not always work in practice because initial allocations of property rights would affect the end result of the negotiations.

The '''Damascus International Film Festival''' ({{lang-ar|مهرجان دمشق السينمائي الدولي}}) is a biannual November [[film festival]] hosted by the government of [[Syria]] since 1979. The festival was established by the late Syrian film director [[Muhammad Shahin]]. It alternates with the [[Carthage Film Festival]]. Up to 1999, the festival's competition focused on films from Arab countries, Latin America and Asia. Since 2001 the festival has an international focus.

They were rebellions by the [[Earl of Desmond]] – head of the [[FitzGerald dynasty]] in Munster – and his followers, the [[FitzGerald dynasty|Geraldines]] and their allies, against the threat of the extension of their South Welsh [[Rhys ap Tewdwr|Tewdwr]] cousins of [[Elizabethan Era|Elizabethan]] English government over the province. The rebellions were motivated primarily by the desire to maintain the independence of [[feudal]] lords from their monarch, but also had an element of religious antagonism between [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] Geraldines and the [[Protestant]] English state. They culminated in the destruction of the Desmond dynasty and the [[Plantations of Ireland|plantation]] or [[colonisation]] of Munster with English Protestant settlers. 'Desmond' is the [[Anglicisation]] of the [[Irish language|Irish]] ''Deasmumhain'', meaning 'South Munster'

==Causes==
The south of Ireland (the provinces of [[Munster]] and southern [[Leinster]]) was dominated, as it had been for over two centuries, by the [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]] [[Butler dynasty|Butlers]] of [[Earl of Ormond (Ireland)|Ormonde]] and the FitzGeralds of Desmond. Both families raised their own armed forces and imposed their own law, a mixture of Irish and English customs independent of the English government imposed on Ireland. Beginning in the 1530s, successive English administrations tried to expand English control over Ireland (See [[Tudor conquest of Ireland]]). By the 1560s, their attention had turned to the south of Ireland and [[Henry Sidney]], as [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], was charged with establishing the authority of the English government over the independent lordships there. His solution was the formation of "lord presidencies"—provincial military governors who would replace the local lords as military powers and keepers of the peace.

The dynasties saw the presidencies as intrusions into their sphere of influence. Their interfamilial competition had seen the Butlers and FitzGeralds fight a pitched battle against each other at [[battle of Affane|Affane]] in [[County Waterford]] in 1565&lt;ref name=Hull&gt;[http://www.libraryireland.com/HullHistory/DesmondRebellion1.php Hull, Eleanor. "The Desmond Rebellion", ''A History of Ireland'', 1931]&lt;/ref&gt; in defiance of English law. [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] summoned the heads of both houses to London to explain their actions. However, the treatment of the dynasties was not even-handed. [[Thomas Butler, 10th Earl of Ormonde]] — "Black Tom" Butler, Queen Elizabeth's cousin and friend – was pardoned, while both Gerald FitzGerald, 14th Earl of Desmond (in 1567) and his brother, John of Desmond, widely regarded as the real military leader of the FitzGeralds, (in 1568) were arrested and detained in the [[Tower of London]] on Ormonde's urging.

This decapitated the natural leadership of the Munster Geraldines and left the Desmond earldom in the hands of a soldier, [[James FitzMaurice FitzGerald]], the captain general of the Desmond military. FitzMaurice had little stake in a new demilitarised order in Munster, with abolition of the Irish lords' armies. A factor that drew wider support for FitzMaurice was the prospect of land confiscations, which had been mooted by Sidney and [[Peter Carew (died 1575)|Peter Carew]], an English claimant to lands granted to an ancestor just after the [[Norman conquest of Ireland]] that had been lost soon afterwards.

This ensured FitzMaurice the support of important Munster clans, notably MacCarthy Mór, O'Sullivan Beare and O'Keefe, and two prominent Butlers, brothers of the Earl. Fitzmaurice himself had lost the land he had held at Kerricurrihy in [[County Cork]], which had been taken and leased to English colonists. He was a devout Catholic, influenced by the [[counter-reformation]], and saw the Protestant Elizabethan governors as his enemies.

To discourage Sidney from going ahead with the Lord Presidency for Munster and to re-establish Desmond primacy over the Butlers, FitzMaurice planned rebellion against the English presence in the south, and against the Earl of Ormonde. FitzMaurice had wider aims than simply the recovery of FitzGerald supremacy within the context of the English [[Kingdom of Ireland]]. Before the rebellion, he secretly sent Maurice MacGibbon, Catholic [[Archbishop of Cashel]], to seek military aid from [[Philip II of Spain]].

FitzMaurice first attacked the English colony at Kerrycurihy south of [[Cork (city)|Cork]] city in June 1569, before attacking Cork itself and those native lords who refused to join the rebellion. FitzMaurice's force of 4,500 men went on to besiege [[Kilkenny]], seat of the Earls of Ormonde, in July. In response, Sidney mobilised 600 English troops, who marched south from Dublin and another 400 landed by sea in Cork. Thomas Butler, Earl of Ormonde, returned from London, where he had been at court, brought the Butlers out of the rebellion and mobilised Gaelic Irish clans antagonistic to the Geraldines.

Together, Ormonde, Sidney and [[Humphrey Gilbert]], appointed as governor of Munster, devastated the lands of FitzMaurice's allies in a [[scorched earth]] policy. FitzMaurice's forces broke up, as individual lords had to retire to defend their own territories. Gilbert, a half-brother of [[Sir Walter Raleigh]], was the most notorious for terror tactics, killing civilians at random and setting up corridors of severed heads at the entrance to his camps.

Sidney forced FitzMaurice into the mountains of [[County Kerry|Kerry]], from where he launched guerrilla attacks on the English and their allies. By 1570, most of FitzMaurice's allies had submitted to Sidney. The most important, Donal MacCarthy Mór, surrendered in November 1569. Nevertheless, the guerrilla campaign continued for three more years. In February 1571, [[John Perrot]] was made [[Lord President of Munster]]. He pursued FitzMaurice with 700 troops for over a year without success. FitzMaurice had some victories, capturing an English ship near [[Kinsale]] and burning the town of [[Kilmallock]] in 1571, but by early 1573 his force was reduced to less than 100 men. FitzMaurice finally submitted on 23 February 1573, having negotiated a pardon for his life. However, in 1574, he became landless, and in 1575 he sailed to France to seek help from the Catholic powers to start another rebellion.&lt;ref name=Hull/&gt;

Gerald FitzGerald, Earl of Desmond, and his brother, John, were released from prison to reconstruct their shattered territory. Under a settlement imposed after the rebellion, known as "composition", the Desmonds' military forces were limited by law to just 20 horsemen; their tenants were made to pay rent to them rather than supply military service or quarter their soldiers. Perhaps the biggest winner of the first Desmond Rebellion was the Earl of Ormonde, who established himself as the most powerful lord in the south of Ireland due to siding with the English crown.

All of the local chiefs had submitted by the end of the rebellion. The methods used to suppress it provoked lingering resentment, especially among the Irish mercenaries; ''gall óglaigh'' or ''[[gallowglass]]'' as the English termed them, who had rallied to FitzMaurice. William Drury, Lord President of Munster from 1576, executed around 700 of these men in the years after the rebellion.

In the aftermath of the uprising, [[Gaels|Gaelic]] customs such as [[Brehon Laws]], Irish dress, bardic poetry and the maintaining of "private armies" were again outlawed and suppressed – things that were deeply valued in traditional Irish society. FitzMaurice had emphasised the Gaelic character of the rebellion, wearing Irish dress, speaking only Irish and referring to himself as the ''taoiseach'' of the Geraldines. Irish landowners continued to be threatened by the arrival of English colonists to settle on land confiscated from the Irish. All of these factors meant that, when FitzMaurice returned from Europe to start a new rebellion, plenty of people in Munster were willing to join him.

In late 1569 the Catholic [[Northern Rebellion]], broke out in England, but was crushed. This and the Desmond Rebellion caused [[Pope Pius V]] to issue ''[[Regnans in Excelsis]]'', a bull excommunicating Elizabeth and depriving her of the allegiance of her Catholic subjects. Elizabeth's regime had previously accepted Catholic worship in private; now it suppressed organised Catholicism savagely.

==Second Desmond Rebellion==
{{Main article|Second Desmond Rebellion}}
The second Desmond rebellion was sparked when James FitzMaurice FitzGerald launched an invasion of Munster in 1579. During his exile in Europe he had declared himself as a soldier of the [[counter-reformation]], arguing that since the [[Pope Pius V|Pope]]'s excommunication of Elizabeth I Irish Catholics did not owe loyalty to a heretic monarch. The Pope granted FitzMaurice an [[indulgence]] and supplied him with troops and money. FitzMaurice landed at [[Smerwick]], near [[Dingle]] (modern [[County Kerry]]) on 18 July 1579 with a small force of Spanish and Italian troops. He was joined on 1 August by [[John FitzGerald (Tudor nobleman)|John of Desmond]], a brother of the earl, who had a large following among his kinsmen and the disaffected swordsmen of Munster. Other Gaelic clans and Old English families also joined in the rebellion.

FitzMaurice was killed in a skirmish with the Clanwilliam Burkes on 18 August, and John FitzGerald assumed leadership of the rebellion.

[[File:Carrigafoyle Castle - geograph.org.uk - 12549.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Carrigafoyle Castle]]]]
Gerald, the Earl of Desmond, initially resisted the call of the rebels and tried to remain neutral but gave in once the authorities had proclaimed him a [[traitor]]. He joined the rebellion by sacking the towns of [[Youghal]] (on 13 November) and [[Kinsale]], and devastated the country of the English and their allies.

In the summer of 1580 English troops under [[William Pelham (lord justice)|William Pelham]] and locally raised Irish forces under the Earl of Ormonde retook the south coast, destroyed the lands of the Desmonds and their allies and killed their tenants. They captured [[Siege of Carrigafoyle Castle|Carrigafoyle]], the principal Desmond castle at the mouth of the [[River Shannon|Shannon]]  at Easter 1580, cutting off the Geraldine forces from the rest of the country and prevented a landing of foreign troops into the main Munster ports.

In July 1580 the rising spread to [[Leinster]], under the leadership of [[Fiach MacHugh O'Byrne]] and his client [[the Pale]] lord [[James Eustace, 3rd Viscount Baltinglass]]. They ambushed and massacred a large English force under the [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]] [[Arthur Grey, 14th Baron Grey de Wilton|Lord Grey de Wilton]] at the [[battle of Glenmalure]] on 25 August.

On 10 September 1580, 600 papal troops landed at Smerwick in Kerry to support the rebellion. They were besieged in a fort at [[Dún an Óir]]. They surrendered after two days of bombardment and were then massacred. Through the relentless scorched-earth tactics of the English, who killed animals and razed crops and homes to deprive the Irish of any food or shelter, the rebellion was crushed by mid-1581. By May 1581, most of the minor rebels and FitzGerald allies in Munster and Leinster had accepted Elizabeth I's offer of a general pardon.  John of Desmond was killed north of [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in early 1582.

The Geraldine earl was pursued by English forces until the end. From 1581 to 1583, his supporters evaded capture in the mountains of [[County Kerry|Kerry]]. On 2 November 1583 the earl was hunted down and killed near [[Tralee]] in Kerry by the O'Moriarty family. The clan chief, Maurice, received 1,000 pounds of silver and a pension of 20 pounds a year from the English government for Desmond's head, which was sent to Queen Elizabeth. Desmond's body was displayed on the walls of Cork. (Maurice O'Moriarty ended his life by being hanged at Tyburn.)

==Aftermath==

After three years of scorched earth warfare by the English, Munster was racked by [[famine]]. In April 1582, the provost marshal of Munster, Sir [[Warham St. Leger (1525?-1597)|Warham St Leger]], estimated that 30,000 people had died of hunger in the previous six months. Plague broke out in [[Cork (city)|Cork city]], to where the country people had fled to avoid the fighting. People continued to die of starvation and plague long after the war had ended, and it is estimated that by 1589 one-third of the province's population had died. Grey was recalled by Elizabeth I for his excessive brutality. Two famous accounts tell us of the devastation of Munster after the Desmond rebellion. The first is from the Gaelic [[Annals of the Four Masters]]:

{{cquote|''... the whole tract of country from [[Waterford]] to [[Lothra]], and from Cnamhchoill (a wood close to [[Tipperary (town)|Tipperary]]) to the county of Kilkenny, was suffered to remain one surface of weeds and waste… At this period it was commonly said that the lowing of a cow or the whistle of the ploughboy could scarcely be heard from [[Dunquin|Dun-Caoin]] to Cashel in Munster.''}}

The second is from the '''View of the Present State of Ireland''', written by English poet [[Edmund Spenser]], who fought in the campaign, approved the scorched earth method, and suggested it as a useful method of enforcing English ways:

{{cquote|''In those late wars in Munster; for notwithstanding that the same was a most rich and plentiful country, full of corn and cattle, that you would have thought they could have been able to stand long, yet ere one year and a half they were brought to such wretchedness, as that any stony heart would have rued the same. Out of every corner of the wood and glens they came creeping forth upon their hands, for their legs could not bear them; they looked Anatomies [of] death, they spoke like ghosts crying out of their graves; they did eat of the carrions, happy where they could find them, yea, and one another soon after, in so much as the very carcasses they spared not to scrape out of their graves; and if they found a plot of water-cresses or shamrocks, there they flocked as to a feast for the time, yet not able long to continue therewithal; that in a short space there were none almost left, and a most populous and plentiful country suddenly left void of man or beast.''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/E500000-001/&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The wars of the 1570s and 1580s marked a watershed in Ireland. The southern Geraldine axis of power was annihilated, and Munster was "planted" with English colonists given land confiscated from those who fought for their country.  After a survey begun in 1584 by [[Sir Valentine Browne]], [[Surveyor General]] of Ireland, the thousands of English soldiers and administrators who had been imported to suppress the rebellion were given land in the [[Plantations of Ireland|Munster Plantation]] of Desmond's confiscated estates. The [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Elizabethan conquest of Ireland]] followed the subsequent [[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Nine Years War]] in [[Ulster]] and the extension of plantation policy to other parts of the country.

An '''elephants' graveyard''' (also written '''elephant graveyard''' or '''elephant's graveyard''') is a mythical place where, according to legend, older [[elephant]]s instinctively direct themselves when they reach a certain age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/quora/2013/11/15/elephant_graveyards_do_they_exist.html |title=Do Elephant Graveyards Exist? |last=Young |first=Rory |date=November 15, 2013 |website= |publisher=Slate |access-date=February 3, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They would then die there alone, far from the group.

==Origin==
Several theories are given about the myth's origin. One theory involves people finding groups of elephant skeletons together, or observing old elephants and skeletons in the same habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Armitage | first = Kenneth B. | title = The Great Beast&amp;nbsp;— Elephant Life: Fifteen Years of High Population Density | journal = BioScience | volume = 42 | issue = 3 | pages = 196–197 | date = March 1992 | doi = 10.2307/1311827 | publisher = BioScience, Vol. 42, No. 3 | last2 = Buss | first2 = Irven O. | jstor = 1311827}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others suggest the term may spring from group die-offs, such as one excavated in [[Saxony-Anhalt]], which had 27 ''[[Straight-tusked Elephant|Palaeoloxodon antiquus]]'' skeletons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last1 = Brühl | first1 = Enrico | last2 = Mania | first2 = Dietrich | title = Neumark-Nord: a middle Pleistocene lake shore with synchronous sites of different functional character | booktitle = Données récentes sur les modalités de peuplement en Europe au Paléolithique inférieur et moyen | publisher = Université de Rennes | date = 22–25 September 2003 | location = Rennes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In that particular case, the tusks of the skeletons were missing, which indicated either hunters killed a group of elephants in one spot, or else opportunistic scavengers removed the tusks from a natural die-off.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

Other theories focus on elephant behaviour during lean times, suggesting starving elephants gather in places where finding food is easier, and subsequently die there.&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;Iain Douglas-Hamilton, Richard Barnes, Hezy Shoshani, A. Christy Williams, A. J. T. Johnsingh, Robin Beck, Katy Payne "Elephants"  The Encyclopedia of Mammals. Ed. David W. Macdonald. Oxford University Press, 2007. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press.28 August 2007  &lt;http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t227.e47&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The myth was popularised in films such as ''[[Trader Horn (1931 film)|Trader Horn]]'' and MGM's [[Tarzan the Ape Man (1932 film)|Tarzan]] movies, in which groups of greedy explorers attempt to locate the elephants' graveyard, on the fictional Mutia Escarpment, in search of its riches of ivory.&lt;ref name="Earnheart"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Earnhart | first = Brady | title = A Colony of the Imagination: Vicarious Spectatorship in MGM's Early Tarzan Talkies | journal = Quarterly Review of Film and Video | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 341–352 | date = 1 July 2007 | doi = 10.1080/10509200500526778}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Osamu Tezuka]]'s ''[[Kimba the White Lion]]'' episode "A Friend in Deed" centred around it.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

More recently, the 1994 Disney animated film ''[[The Lion King]]''; as well as the Broadway/West End [[The Lion King (musical)|musical]] adaptation; referred to the motif.{{cn|date=October 2015}} In "[[Fearful Symmetry (The X-Files)|Fearful Symmetry]],"  an episode from ''[[The X-Files]]'' which revolves around a mysterious invisible elephant, a character refers to the mythical concept as fact.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

Prolific elephant hunter [[W. D. M. Bell|Walter "Karamojo" Bell]] discounted the idea of the elephant's graveyard, stating that bones and "tusks were still lying about in the bush where they had lain for years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Walter|title=Karamojo Safari|year=1949|publisher=Harcourt, Brace|isbn=1-57157-358-5|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Oberhausen - Gasometer - Sternstunden 33 ies.jpg|thumb|An ExoMars rover as an exhibit at [[Gasometer Oberhausen]], Germany]]
Since its inception, ExoMars has gone through several phases of planning with various proposals for landers, orbiters, launch vehicles, and international cooperation planning,&lt;ref name="ExoMars"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/exomars_2016.html |title=ExoMars |date= |accessdate=22 October 2013 |work=Russian Space Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the defunct 2009 [[Mars Exploration Joint Initiative]] (MEJI) with the United States.&lt;ref name="CNet"&gt;{{cite news |first=William |last=Harwood |title=NASA budget boosts manned space, cuts Mars exploration |date=13 February 2012 |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-19514_3-57377062-239/nasa-budget-boosts-manned-space-cuts-mars-exploration/ |work=C Net News |quote="Tough choices had to be made," Bolden said.

Originally, the ExoMars concept consisted of a large robotic rover being part of ESA's [[Aurora Programme]] as a ''Flagship mission'' and was approved by the European Space Agency ministers in December 2005. Originally conceived as a rover with a stationary ground station, ExoMars was planned to launch in 2011 aboard a Russian [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz]] [[Fregat]] rocket.&lt;ref name="Europe's ExoMars rover"&gt;{{cite web |title=Europe's ExoMars rover... |date=28 August 2005 |url=http://www.spacetoday.org/SolSys/Mars/MarsExploration/MarsEuroRover.html |work=Space Today Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ExoMars begun in 2001 as part of the ESA Aurora program for the human exploration of Mars.&lt;ref name="esa.int"&gt;[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/ExoMars/ExoMars_frequently_asked_questions]&lt;/ref&gt; That initial vision called for rover in 2009 and later a [[Mars sample-return mission]].&lt;ref name="esa.int"/&gt; Another mission intended to support the Aurora program is a Phobos sample return mission.&lt;ref name="esa.int"/&gt; In December 2005, the different nations composing the ESA gave approval to the Aurora program and to ExoMars.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Exploration/European_ministers_approve_the_Aurora_Exploration_Programme_and_give_green_light_for_the_ExoMars_mission ''European ministers approve the Aurora Exploration Programme and give green light for the ExoMars mission''], ESA, 12 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Aurora is an optional program and each state is allowed to decide which part of the program they want to be involved in and to what extent (e.g. how much funds they want to put into the program).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The Aurora program was initiated in 2002 with support of twelve nations: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Canada&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 2007, Canadian-based technology firm MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates Ltd. (MDA) was selected for a one-million-euro contract with [[EADS Astrium]] of Britain to design and build a prototype Mars rover chassis for the European Space Agency. Astrium was also contracted to design the final rover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/globaltv/national/story.html?id=67e4d15d-5ecc-4db8-9fe3-f5d904694950&amp;k=48686 |title=B.C. robotics firm lands Martian contract |publisher=CanWest News Service |date=18 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124024833/http://www.canada.com/globaltv/national/story.html?id=67e4d15d-5ecc-4db8-9fe3-f5d904694950&amp;k=48686 |archivedate=24 November 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 2009 NASA and ESA signed the [[Mars Exploration Joint Initiative]], which proposed to utilise an Atlas rocket launcher instead of a Soyuz, which significantly altered the technical and financial setting of the ExoMars mission. On 19 June, when the rover was still planned to piggyback the [[Mars Trace Gas Orbiter]], it was reported that a prospective agreement would require that ExoMars lose enough weight to fit aboard the Atlas launch vehicle with a NASA orbiter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spacenews.com/civil/nasa-could-take-role-european-exomars-mission.html |title=NASA Could Take Role in European ExoMars Mission |work=Space News |date=19 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MAX-C-Rover.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Mars Astrobiology Explorer-Cacher]] (MAX-C) rover]]
Then the mission was combined with other projects to a multi-spacecraft mission divided over two [[Atlas V]]-launches:&lt;ref name="oct-proposal"&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael A. |last=Taverna |authorlink= |title=ESA Proposes Two ExoMars Missions |date=19 October 2009 |publisher=[[Aviation Week]] |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=space&amp;id=news/Exomars101909.xml&amp;headline=ESA%20Proposes%20Two%20ExoMars%20Missions |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oct-proposal"/&gt;&lt;ref name=oct12 &gt;{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Amos |authorlink= |title=Europe's Mars plans move forward |date=12 October 2009 |publisher= |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8302876.stm |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter]] (TGO) was merged into the project, piggybacking a stationary meteorological lander slated for launch in January 2016. It was also proposed to include a second rover, the [[Mars Astrobiology Explorer-Cacher|MAX-C]].

In August 2009 it was announced that the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] (now Roscosmos) and ESA had signed a contract that included cooperation on two Mars exploration projects: Russia's [[Fobos-Grunt]] project and ESA's ExoMars. Specifically, ESA secured a Russian [[Proton (rocket)|Proton rocket]] as a "backup launcher" for the ExoMars rover, which would include Russian-made parts.&lt;ref name=avio &gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Agreement between ESA and Roscosmos signed at "MAKS 2009" |date=20 August 2009 |publisher=Avio News |url=http://www.avionews.com/index.php?corpo=see_news_home.php&amp;news_id=1108379&amp;pagina_chiamante=index.php |work=WAPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=red &gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=ESA, Roscosmos Strike Mars Deal |date=20 August 2009 |publisher= |url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/space/1740298/esa_roscosmos_strike_mars_deal/ |work=Red Orbit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 December 2009, the ESA governments gave their final approval to a two-part Mars exploration mission to be conducted with NASA, confirming their commitment to spend €850 million ($1.23 billion) on missions in 2016 and 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter B. |last=de Selding |title=ESA Approves Collaborative Mars Program with NASA |date=18 December 2009 |url=http://www.space.com/news/091218-exomars-mission.html |work=Space News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, because of a budgeting crisis, a proposal was announced to cancel the accompanying [[Mars Astrobiology Explorer-Cacher|MAX-C]] rover, and fly only one rover in 2018 that would be larger than either of the vehicles in the paired concept.&lt;ref name="single rover"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Amos |title=US and Europe mull single 2018 Mars rover |date=7 April 2011 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13002214 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; One suggestion was that the new vehicle would be built in Europe and carry a mix of European and U.S. instruments. NASA would provide the rocket to deliver it to Mars and provide the [[Mars Science Laboratory#Sky crane landing|sky crane landing system]]. Despite the proposed reorganisation, the goals of the 2018 mission opportunity would have stayed broadly the same.&lt;ref name="single rover" /&gt;

Under the FY2013 Budget President Obama released on 13 February 2012, NASA terminated its participation in ExoMars due to budgetary cuts in order to pay for the cost overruns of the [[James Webb Space Telescope]].&lt;ref name="Feb 14"&gt;{{cite news |first=Frank |last=Morring, Jr. |title=NASA Units Hope For Robotic Mars Mission in 2018 |date=14 February 2012 |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=/article-xml/asd_02_14_2012_p01-02-424988.xml |work=Aviation Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ken |last=Kremer |title=Experts React to Obama Slash to NASA's Mars and Planetary Science Exploration |date=1 February 2012 |url=http://www.universetoday.com/93512/experts-react-to-obama-slash-to-nasas-mars-and-planetary-science-exploration/ |work=Universe Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; With NASA's funding for this project completely cancelled, most of these plans had to be restructured.&lt;ref name="cancellation" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Wall |title=When Exploring Other Planets, International Cooperation Is Key |date=22 August 2012 |publisher=Space.com |url=http://www.space.com/17225-planetary-exploration-international-cooperation.html |work=Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 March 2013, representatives of the ESA and the [[Russian Federal Space Agency|Russian space agency]] (Roscosmos), signed a deal in which Russia became a full partner. Roscosmos will supply both missions with [[Proton (rocket)|Proton launch vehicles]] with [[Briz-M]] upper stages and launch services,&lt;ref name="Proton+BrizM"&gt;{{cite news |work=Staff |title=Russian-European spacecraft to go on Martian mission in Jan 2016 |date=10 February 2014 |url=http://voiceofrussia.com/news/2014_02_10/Russian-European-spacecraft-to-go-on-Martian-mission-in-Jan-2016-9740/ |publisher=The Voice of Russia}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as an additional entry, descent and landing module for the rover mission in 2018.&lt;ref name="ESA signed" /&gt; Under the agreement, Roscosmos was granted three asking conditions:&lt;ref name="Gazeta"&gt;{{cite news |first=Nikolai |last=Podorvanyuk |title=Insurance from "Phobos-Grunt" to fly to Mars |date=30 March 2012 |url=http://www.gazeta.ru/science/2012/03/30_a_4111965.shtml |work=Gazeta |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ESA had originally cost-capped the ExoMars projects at €1 billion, ([[USD]] 1.3 billion) but the withdrawal of the U.S. space agency ([[NASA]]) and the consequent reorganisation of the ventures will probably add several hundred million euros to the sum so far raised.&lt;ref name="still keen" /&gt; So on March 2012, member states instructed the agency's executive to look at how this shortfall could be made up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter B. |last=de Selding |title=ESA Eyeing Hodgepodge of Funding Sources To Save ExoMars Mission |date=31 May 2012 |url=http://www.spacenews.com/civil/120531-hodgepodge-funding-save-exomars.html |work=Space News}}&lt;/ref&gt; One possibility is that other science activities within ESA may have to step back to make ExoMars a priority.&lt;ref name="still keen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spacenews.com/civil/120516-exomars-one-month-reprieve.html |title=ExoMars Wins One-month Reprieve |work=Space News |date=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 2012 it was announced that new ESA members, Poland and Romania will be contributing up to €70 million to the ExoMars mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter B. |last=de Selding |title=Poland Tripling Space Spending in Bid To Boost Economy |date=19 September 2012 |url=http://www.spacenews.com/civil/120919-poland-tripling-space-spending.html |work=Space News}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESA has not ruled out a possible partial return of NASA to the 2018 portion of ExoMars, albeit in a relatively minor role.&lt;ref name="still keen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Selding" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morning"&gt;{{cite news |first=Frank |last=Morring, Jr. |title=Appropriators Blocking Mars Mission Move |date=8 March 2012 |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=space&amp;id=news/awx/2012/03/08/awx_03_08_2012_p0-434301.xml&amp;headline=Appropriators%20Blocking%20Mars%20Mission%20Move |work=[[Aviation Week]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia's financing of ExoMars could be partially covered by insurance payments of 1.2 billion rubles ($40.7 million USD) for the loss of [[Fobos-Grunt]],&lt;ref name="Gazeta" /&gt; and reassigning funds for a possible coordination between the [[Mars-NET]] and ExoMars projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/marsnet.html |title=The Mars-NET project |date= |accessdate=18 April 2012 |quote=Possible coordination between Mars-NET and European ExoMars project.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mars-Grunt&gt;{{cite news |first=Ilya |last=Kramnik |title=Russia takes a two-pronged approach to space exploration |date=18 April 2012 |url=http://indrus.in/articles/2012/04/18/russia_takes_a_two-pronged_approach_to_space_exploration_15511.html |work=Russia &amp; India Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 January 2013, Roscosmos fully funded the development of the scientific instruments to be flown on the first launch, the [[Trace Gas Orbiter]] (TGO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff |title=Roskosmos funds creation of instruments for ExoMars mission |date=25 January 2013 |url=http://english.ruvr.ru/2013_01_25/Roskosmos-funds-creation-of-instruments-for-Exomars-mission/ |work=The Voice of Russia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission profile ==

ExoMars is a joint programme of the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) and the Russian space agency [[Roscosmos]]. According to current plans, the ExoMars project will comprise four spacecraft: two stationary landers, one orbiter and one rover. All mission elements will be sent in two launches using two heavy-lift [[Proton (rocket)|Proton]] rockets.&lt;ref name="still keen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Selding" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Svitak"&gt;{{cite news |first=Amy |last=Svitak |title=Europe Joins Russia on Robotic ExoMars |date=16 March 2012 |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=space&amp;id=news/awx/2012/03/15/awx_03_15_2012_p0-437120.xml&amp;headline=Europe%20Joins%20Russia%20on%20Robotic%20ExoMars |work=Aviation Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First launch (2016) ===

==== Trace Gas Orbiter ====
{{Main article|ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter}}

The Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) is a Mars telecommunications orbiter and atmospheric gas analyzer mission that was launched on 14 March 2016.&lt;ref name="Sputnik"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sputniknews.com/science/20150918/1027214512.html |title=Russian, EU Space Agencies Propose to Delay Joint Mission to Mars |work=Sputnik News |location=Moskow |date=18 September 2015 |accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Clark |first=Stephen |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/2015/09/20/launch-of-european-mars-mission-delayed-two-months/ |title=Launch of European Mars mission delayed two months |work=Spaceflight Now |date=20 September 2015 |accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spacecraft arrived in the Martian orbit in October 2016. It delivered the ExoMars Schiaparelli EDM lander and then proceed to map the sources of [[Atmosphere of Mars#Methane|methane on Mars]] and other gases, and in doing so, help select the landing site for the ExoMars [[Rover (space exploration)|rover]] to be launched in 2020. The presence of methane in Mars' atmosphere is intriguing because its likely origin is either present-day life or geological activity. Upon the arrival of the rover in 2021, the orbiter would be transferred into a lower orbit where it would be able to perform analytical science activities as well as provide the Schiaparelli EDM lander and ExoMars rover with telecommunication relay. NASA provided an ''Electra'' telecommunications relay and navigation instrument to ensure communications between probes and rovers on the surface of Mars and controllers on Earth.&lt;ref name="ESA signed" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter B. |last=de Selding |title=U.S., Europe Won't Go It Alone in Mars Exploration |date=26 September 2012 |url=http://www.spacenews.com/civil/120926-us-europe-mars-exploration.html |work=Space News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TGO would continue serving as a telecommunication relay satellite for future landed missions until 2022.&lt;ref name="June 2011"&gt;{{citation |first=Mark |last=Allen |first2=Olivier |last2=Witasse |contribution=2016 ESA/NASA ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter |title=MEPAG June 2011 |publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory |date=16 June 2011 |contribution-url=http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/meeting/jun-11/13-EMTGO_MEPAG_June2011_presentation-rev2.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Schiaparelli'' EDM lander ====
{{main article|Schiaparelli EDM lander}}

=== Second launch (2020) ===

==== Russian landing system ====

The second mission, scheduled for launch in July 2020, will have an 1800&amp;nbsp;kg Russian-built landing platform system derived from the 2016 Schiaparelli EDM lander, to place the [[ExoMars rover]] on the surface of Mars.&lt;ref name="On track" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LaunchMoved2020"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LanderAmos"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jonthan |last=Amos |title=Looking forward to Europe's 'seven minutes of terror' |date=21 June 2013 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-23010103 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lander platform will be built 80% by the Russian company [[Lavochkin]], and 20% by ESA.&lt;ref name="Selding" /&gt; Lavochkin will produce most of the landing system's hardware, while ESA will handle elements such as the guidance, radar and navigation systems.&lt;ref name="still keen" /&gt; Lavochkin's current landing strategy is to use two parachutes; one will open while the module is still moving at supersonic speed, and another will deploy once the probe has been slowed down to subsonic velocity. The heat shield will eventually fall away from the entry capsule to allow the ExoMars rover, riding its retro-rocket-equipped lander, to come for a soft landing on legs or struts. The surface platform lander will then deploy ramps for the rover to drive down.&lt;ref name="LanderAmos" /&gt;

Critics have stated that while Russian expertise may be sufficient to provide a launch vehicle, it does not currently extend to the critical requirement of a landing system for Mars.&lt;ref name="LanderAmos" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NASA drops ExoMars missions in 2013 budget |url=http://optics.org/news/3/2/23 |work=Optics |date=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/mar/16/spacewatch-nasa-mars-exomars |title=Uncertainties for ExoMars |first=Alan |last=Pickup |work=Spacewatch |publisher=Guardian News and Media |date=16 March 2012 |deadurl=no |archivedate=17 March 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317113819/http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/mar/16/spacewatch-nasa-mars-exomars}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Surface platform ====
{{main article|ExoMars 2020 surface platform}}

After landing on Mars in 2021, the rover will descend from the platform via a ramp. The platform is expected to image the landing site, monitor the climate, investigate the atmosphere, analyse the radiation environment, study the distribution of any subsurface water at the landing site, and perform geophysical investigations of the internal structure of Mars.&lt;ref name="2018 lander payload"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/European_payload_selected_for_ExoMars_2018_surface_platform |title=European payload selected for ExoMars 2018 surface platform |work=European Space Agency (ESA) |date=27 November 2015 |accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a March 2015 request for the contribution of scientific instruments for the landing system,&lt;ref name="2018Platform"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://exploration.esa.int/jump.cfm?oid=55672 |title=Announcement of Opportunity for European payload elements on the Surface Platform of the ExoMars 2018 mission |work=European Space Agency (ESA) |date=31 March 2015 |accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; there will be 13 instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://exploration.esa.int/mars/56933-exomars-2020-surface-platform/|title=ExoMars 2020 surface platform|website=exploration.esa.int|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of the instruments on the lander include the [[HABIT (HabitAbility: Brine, Irradiation and Temperature)]] package, the METEO meteorological package, the MAIGRET magnetometer, and the LaRa radio-science experiment.

The platform is expected to operate for at least one Earth year, and its instruments will be powered by solar arrays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iss-reshetnev.com/media/news/news-231116|title=ISS-Reshetnev chosen for ExoMars-2020 project|last=JSC ISS–Reshetnev|first=|date=|website=|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ExoMar's rover includes the Pasteur instrument suite, including the [[Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer]] (MOMA), [[MicrOmega-IR]], and the [[Raman Laser Spectrometer]] (RLS). Examples of external instruments on the rover include:
*[[Mars Multispectral Imager for Subsurface Studies]]
*[[Infrared Spectrometer for ExoMars]]
*[[ADRON-RM]]

== Landing site selection ==
[[File:NASA-OxiaPlanum-GeologicalContext-Morphology-20140514.jpg|thumb|300px| [[Oxia Planum]], near the equator, is the selected landing site for its potential to preserve biosignatures and smooth surface ]]

A primary goal when selecting the rover's landing site is to identify a particular geologic environment, or set of environments, that would support —now or in the past— microbial life. The scientists prefer a landing site with both morphologic and mineralogical evidence for past water. Furthermore, a site with spectra indicating multiple [[Mineral hydration|hydrated minerals]] such as [[clay minerals]] is preferred, but it will come down to a balance between engineering constraints and scientific goals.&lt;ref name="site selection 2014"&gt;{{cite news |last=Grindrod |first=Peter |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2014/mar/26/life-mars-exomars-spacecraft-landing-site |title=Searching for life on Mars: where should the ExoMars rover land? |work=The Guardian |date=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engineering constraints call for a flat landing site in a latitude band straddling the equator that is only 30° latitude from top to bottom because the rover is solar-powered and will need best sunlight exposure.&lt;ref name="site selection 2014" /&gt; The landing module carrying the rover will have a landing ellipse that measures about 105&amp;nbsp;km by 15&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="Sites March 2014"&gt;{{cite news |last=Amos |first=Jonathan |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-26743089 |title=Europe begins Mars site selection |work=BBC News |date=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Scientific requirements include landing in an area with 3.6 billion years old [[sedimentary rock]]s that are a record of the past wet habitable environment.&lt;ref name="site selection 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exploration.esa.int/mars/53462-call-for-exomars-2018-landing-site-selection/ |title=Call for ExoMars 2018 Landing Site Selection |publisher=ESA |date=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The year before launch, the European Space Agency will make the final decision.&lt;ref name="site selection 2014" /&gt; By March 2014, the long list was:&lt;ref name="Sites March 2014" /&gt;
{{div col|colwidth=10em}}

* [[Coogoon Valles]]
* [[Hypanis Vallis]]
* [[Mawrth Vallis]]
* [[Oxia Planum]]
* [[Simud Valles]]
* [[Southern Isidis]]
{{div col end}}
Following additional review by an ESA-appointed panel, four sites, all of which are located relatively near the equator, were formally recommended in October 2014 for further detailed analysis:&lt;ref name="4 candidate sites"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://spaceref.com/mars/four-candidate-landing-sites-for-exomars-2018.html |title=Four Candidate Landing Sites for ExoMars 2018 |work=ESA |publisher=Space Ref |date=1 October 2014 |accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exploration.esa.int/jump.cfm?oid=54707 |title=Recommendation for the Narrowing of ExoMars 2018 Landing Sites |work=ESA |date=1 October 2014 |accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{div col|colwidth=10em}}
* [[Oxia Palus quadrangle|Aram Dorsum]]
* [[Hypanis Vallis]]
* [[Mawrth Vallis]]
* [[Oxia Planum]]
{{div col end}}
On 21 October 2015, [[Oxia Planum]] was reported to be the preferred landing site for the [[ExoMars rover]].&lt;ref name="BBC-20151021"&gt;{{cite news |last=Amos |first=Jonathan |title=ExoMars rover: Landing preference is for Oxia Planum |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-34584214 |date=21 October 2015 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UT-20151021"&gt;{{cite web |last=Atkinson |first=Nancy |title=Scientists Want ExoMars Rover to Land at Oxia Planum |url=http://www.universetoday.com/123018/scientists-want-exomars-rover-to-land-at-oxia-planum/ |date=21 October 2015 |work=[[Universe Today]] |accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The delay of the rover mission to 2020 from 2018 meant that Oxia Planum was no longer the only favourable landing site due to changes in the possible [[Landing footprint|landing ellipse]]. Both Mawrth Vallis and Aram Dorsum, surviving candidates from the previous selection, could be reconsidered. ESA convened further workshops to re-evaluate the three remaining options and in March 2017 selected two sites to study in detail;
{{div col|colwidth=10em}}
* [[Mawrth Vallis]]
* [[Oxia Planum]]
{{div col end}}
The final selection is scheduled to occur approximately a year before launch.&lt;ref name="2 sites"&gt;{{cite web|title=Final two ExoMars landing sites chosen |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/ExoMars/Final_two_ExoMars_landing_sites_chosen |date=28 March 2017 |work=[[European Space Agency]] |accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Feis''' ({{IPA-ga|fʲɛʃ}}) or '''Fèis''' ({{IPA-gd|feːʃ}}) is a traditional [[Gaels|Gaelic]] arts and culture festival. The plural forms are '''feiseanna''' ({{IPA-ga|ˈfʲɛʃənə|lang}}) and '''fèisean''' ({{IPA-gd|ˈfeːʃən|lang}}). The term "feis" is commonly used referring to Irish dance competitions and, in Scotland, to immersive teaching courses, specialising in traditional music and culture. In Scottish Gaelic, the accent is important because there is a difference of meaning and pronunciation between 'feis' and 'fèis' - the word 'feis' means sexual intercourse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faclair.com/ViewEntry.aspx?ID=94D66994E7EC5FEADEF255BD7F628F8E|website=Am Faclair beag}}&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=feis|url=https://learngaelic.scot/dictionary/index.jsp?abairt=feis&amp;slang=both&amp;wholeword=false|website=Learn Gaelic}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In [[Early history of Ireland|Ancient Ireland]] communities placed great importance on local festivals, where [[Gaels]] could come together in song, dance, music, theatre and sport. The largest of these was the ''Aonach'', the great festival at [[Hill of Tara|Tara]], which was then the city of [[Ireland]]'s ''Ardrí'', or "[[List of High Kings of Ireland|High King]]".

These feiseanna were a rich opportunity for storytellers to reach a large audience, and often warriors would recount their exploits in combat, clansmen would trace family genealogies, and bards and balladeers would lead the groups in legends, stories, and song.

These gatherings eventually gave rise to athletic and sporting competitions, including [[horse racing|horse]]- and [[Chariot racing|chariot-racing]], as well as feats of strength and endurance.

==Modern Feiseanna==
Today the Feis has experienced something of a rebirth, both for ethnic Gaels and for enthusiasts of the [[Gaels|Gaelic culture]] in Ireland and [[Scotland]], as well as throughout the world.

Feiseanna are generally centred on [[Irish dance|Irish dancing]].

When competitors begin to dance in these competitions, they traditionally wear a dance costume decided on by their dance school. When these students reach a competition level decided on by the dance school, they have can design or choose a costume of their own. Girls wear ornate dresses with long sleeves and short skirt. The skirt panels are sometimes stiffened with cardboard inserts, but ballet-like "soft-skirts" have become the norm. They usually wear their hair curled, in a wig, in a bun wig or just down. Boys usually wear a dress shirt, tie and/or vest, and dress pants or a kilt.

The most important Feiseanna in Irish Dance are the "[[Oireachtas (Irish dance)|Oireachtas]]"(pronounced oh-rok-tis) competitions. There are regional Oireachtas competitions in Eastern and Western Canada, Northeast, Midwest, Southern and Western US,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northamericanfeiscommission.org/ North American Feis Commission], NAFC website, accessed January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; plus locations in Europe (Especially GB and Ireland) and Australia. Regional Oireachtas are open only to dancers from their defined region, and serve as qualifying competitions for National and World Oireachtas. Important National Oireachtas include North American Nationals (NANs), All Irelands, and All Great Britains.

The most prestigious competition for top dancers is the [[Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne]] (the World Championships), held each Easter Week and in a different city each year.

==Dance competition==
Feiseanna are held all over the world, Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, England, Scotland, Wales, all over Europe, South Africa,  Australia, the USA and Canada. Feiseanna are held by all the organisations which oversee Irish dance, with most feisanna being confined to only those dancers who take lessons with a teacher certified by that particular organisation. However, there are a number of organisations (primarily CRN and WIDA along with its affiliated organisations) who organise 'open feisanna', which are open to any dancer regardless of their teacher's organisation (or if they are self-taught). The organisers of 'closed feiseanna' frown upon dancers from their organisation competing at such open competitions, and there are rumours that organisations may sanction competitors/teachers found to participate in such open feiseanna. This, however, has never been confirmed by any organisations, teachers or dancers and could be construed as a way to keep teachers/dancers within one organisation.

There are different levels of competition offered at all feiseanna, however the number of levels, and the names of each level vary by country (and even region within that country). Competitions are offered for both solo and team dancing, and are separated based upon the age of the competitors. At some competitions, ceili categories are offered for teams of 4 or 8 dancers, the ceili dances performed must be done so as espoused in the book 'Ar Rince Foirne' which lays down 30 of the traditional Irish ceili dances. Competitions for teams of 2, 3 and 8–16 dancers, called figure dances, may also be offered, choreography for these dances is made up by the teacher and/or dancers themselves, though must adhere to certain rules and parameters, a notable rule for figure dances being that 'any move in which a dancer is thrown across the stage is prohibited'.

The commonly competed dances are reel, slip jig, light jig and single jig, in soft shoe, and heavy/treble jig and hornpipe in hard shoe. Treble reels (hard shoe reels) may be offered as 'special dances', as may traditional set dances and special trophy dances in soft and hard shoe in addition to the regular competition. Grade dances are when competitors dance, are judged and are placed in each dance separately. Championships consist of three rounds, an initial soft (reel or slip jig) round and a heavy (heavy/treble jig or hornpipe) round danced by all entrants, the scores from the soft and heavy round are combined, and a percentage (usually circa 50%) of dancers with the highest combined score dance a third round of a modern set dance, the winner is the dancer with the highest combined score across all three rounds. Championships must be judged by a minimum of three judges, preliminary championships in the UK may offer a recall of the heavy dance not danced in the initial heavy round instead of a modern set dance upon recall. Modern set dances are of the teacher and/or dancers own choreography and are danced to a specific set dance chosen from a list compiled by the overseeing organisation. Modern set dances are rarely offered to dance outside of championship competitions, though may occasionally be present as a 'special' competition. Slip jig is only danced by girls, with the exception of male dancers from the CRN organisation.

In CLRG affiliated competitions in the USA, Canada and Mexico these levels of competition are offered: beginner, advanced beginner, novice, open/prizewinner, preliminary championship, and championship. The names of categories vary by region. In some regions of the USA there are also special categories for adults, to be eligible the adult dancers must not have competed in the standard age-defined competitions for a stipulated amount of time (usually circa 4 years). Some feiseanna in the US also offer a 'first feis' category for the youngest dancers, to give them a more gentle introduction into the world of competitions.

In the UK, Europe, Australia and New Zealand almost all of the organisations separate the competitions into beginner (sometimes referred to as novice), primary, intermediate and open levels. In recent years a preliminary championship level has begun to be introduced at many feiseanna, unlike in the US this level is not compulsory, and is an optional level to bridge the gap between placing out of intermediate and entering the open level. Apart from in the younger age groups, the majority of feiseanna in the UK operate only an open championship competition, rather than open grade dances.

The most common way for dancers to advance between levels is through winning a dance when there are 6 or more competitors in the competition, although this depends on organisation.

However, in many regions a dancer can only win 3 competitions with fewer than 6 dancers before they must move up to the next level. Teachers may also choose to move a dancer up a level. Once a dancer has met the requirements to move up a level they are no longer allowed to compete at the lower level of competition, however in the UK if a dancer in the open level has not placed in the top 5 for a period of more than a year, they may return to the intermediate level of competition.

===Competition scoring===
Competitions for each individual dance are scored on a 100-point system, which indicate the subjective opinion of each different judge. Most scores seem to be in the 60–95 point range, and can vary wildly depending upon the judge. However, each competition is judged in its entirety by the same judge(s), so what really matters is the relative placing of each dancer.

'''Placing of dancers'''
For Individual dance competitions, placing is based entirely on a single judges subjective opinion. Ties are common, and can result in slightly skewed final results. For instance, a tie at 2nd place would result in the 4th best dancer receiving 3rd place (1st, 2nd, 2nd, 3rd, instead of 1st, 2nd, 2nd, 4th).

===Irish Points===
Preliminary and Open Championship competitions are judged by at least 3 adjudicators (Judges) and at regional, national and world "Oireachtas" competitions, there can be 5 or more. Because of the subjective nature of judging, the varying scales used by each judge, and fact that the scores of 3 dances must be combined to determine overall placing, an additional [Irish Points] method of scoring is used. Each individual adjudicator derives from their own scoring, a final placing. Ties in these placings are discouraged but do happen. Each of the placings from 1st to 50th are assigned an Irish Point Value, which when combined with the other adjudicators, determines final placing. The Irish Points per individually judged place are vaguely logarithmic, in that 1st == 100 points, 2nd == 75, 3rd == 65 etc., until 50th == 1. This gives higher marks by single judges more weight than average marks by more judges.

Complete List of Irish Points:
* 1st 100 11th 41 21st 30 31st 20 41st 10
* 2nd 75 12th 39 22nd 29 32nd 19 42nd 9
* 3rd 65 13th 38 23rd 28 33rd 18 43rd 8
* 4th 60 14th 37 24th 27 34th 17 44th 7
* 5th 56 15th 36 25th 26 35th 16 45th 6
* 6th 53 16th 35 26th 25 36th 15 46th 5
* 7th 50 17th 34 27th 24 37th 14 47th 4
* 8th 47 18th 33 28th 23 38th 13 48th 3
* 9th 45 19th 32 29th 22 39th 12 49th 2
* 10th 43 20th 31 30th 21 40th 11 50th 1

In a 3 judge competition it is almost impossible to '''Not''' get first with 2 judges agreeing that 1st place is warranted, since with 200 Irish points, the 3rd judge would need to place a dance 7th or worse to overcome the 25 point bonus between 1st and 2nd. This scoring method helps ensure that a single bad adjudicator does not unfairly ruin the results. At a standard 3 judge Feis competition, a unanimous 1st place score is 300 (100 from each judge). At Regional Oireachtas competitions, there are 5 judges who rate all three dance programs, creating the possibility of a perfect score of 500. At the CLRG World Championship Oireachtas (Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne), there are 7 judges, which means that 700 would be perfect if all 7 judges agree that one dancer performed the best.

Most schools in North America, are registered with An Coimisiun le Rince Gaelacha and its subsidiary the Irish Dance Teacher's Association of North America. However WIDA and Rince Tuatha Nua are also present as are CRN.

It has also been labelled a "pro-Mandarin, anti-Cantonese" legislation (废粤推普 or 推普废粤).&lt;ref&gt;http://big5.xinhuanet.com/gate/big5/news.xinhuanet.com/fortune/2011-12/24/c_111293618.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The law was signed and came into effect on March 1, 2012.&lt;ref name="occ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orientaldaily.on.cc/cnt/china_world/20111218/00178_008.html |script-title=zh:廣東廢粵語滅繁體 - 東方日報 |language=zh |publisher=Orientaldaily.on.cc |date= |accessdate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://club.dayoo.com/view-171298550-1-1.html |title=粤语将何去何从？广东省国家通用语言文字规定明年实行_大洋社区 |publisher=Club.dayoo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/zhongwen/trad/chinese_news/2011/12/111218_guangdong_dialect_putonghua.shtml |title=BBC中文網 - 兩岸三地 - 廣東頒布規定限制使用方言 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ban==

==Responses==
The signing has triggered massive negative responses in [[Guangzhou]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]. There were talks of raising movements.&lt;ref name="world1" /&gt;  The law is said to have effects equal to the elimination of the autochthonous  Cantonese culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tw.nextmedia.com/applenews/article/art_id/33897761/IssueID/20111219 |title=粵語播音須報准 民轟「弱智」 &amp;#124; 國際新聞 &amp;#124; 蘋果日報 |publisher=Tw.nextmedia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
On December 24, the Guangdong government held a press conference stating that the regulation does not in fact ban Cantonese;&lt;ref name=programs/&gt; one official stating that such a ban will never occur.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5897">'''Heinz Leymann''' (17 July 1932 in [[Wolfenbüttel]], [[Germany]] - 1999 in [[Stockholm]])  was a German-born [[Sweden|Swedish]] academic, famous for his studies on [[mobbing#Mobbing as human bullying behaviour|mobbing]] among humans. He held a degree in [[pedagogical psychology]], and another one in [[psychiatry]] and worked as a psychologist. He was a professor at [[Umeå University]].

== Academic background ==
Leymann, who became a Swedish citizen in the mid-1950s, was awarded his [[Ph.D.]] in pedagogical psychology from [[Stockholm University]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Leymann, Heinz, ''Kan arbetslivet demokratiseras?: om vikten av att se demokratiseringen som en inlärningsprocess = [Is democracy on the job possible?] : [the significance of the learning process underlying democratic participation]'', Pedagogiska inst., Stockholms univ., Diss. Stockholm : Univ.,Stockholm, 1978 - [http://libris.kb.se/bib/7608100 LIBRIS record]&lt;/ref&gt; He then went on to get another research doctorate (''doktor i medicinsk vetenskap'', "doctor of medical science," typically translated into English as Ph.D.) in psychiatry in 1990 from [[Umeå University]].&lt;ref&gt;Leymann, Heinz, ''Psychological reactions to violence in working life: bank robberies'', Umeå, 1990 (Umeå University medical dissertations, 0346-6612 ; N.S., 289) - [http://libris.kb.se/bib/1014154 LIBRIS record]&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhat unusually, his doctorate in psychiatry was based on his clinical background as a psychologist; he did not go through medical training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leymann.se/English/frame.html The Mobbing Encyclopaedia: A presentation of Professor Heinz Leymann, PhD, MD sci] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927110132/http://leymann.se/English/frame.html |date=2013-09-27 }}, accessed 2010-06-07&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leymann's work on mobbing ==
Leymann pioneered research into [[mobbing]] in the 1980s. His initial research in the area was based on detailed case studies of a number of nurses who had committed or tried to commit [[suicide]] due to events at the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maciej Zaremba]], [http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/fritt-fram-i-sverige-men-brottsligt-i-frankrike-1.1115968 Fritt fram i Sverige. Men brottsligt i Frankrike] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606155029/http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/fritt-fram-i-sverige-men-brottsligt-i-frankrike-1.1115968 |date=2010-06-06 }}, [[Dagens Nyheter]] 2010-06-03 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He developed the [[Leymann Inventory of Psychological Terror]] (LIPT), a questionnaire of 45 mobbing actions.

Although he preferred the term [[bullying]] in the context of school children, some have come to regard mobbing as a form of group bullying. As professor and practicing psychologist, Leymann also noted one of the side-effects of mobbing is [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] and is frequently misdiagnosed.

He survived being shot down eight times during his 1,000 combat missions.{{sfn|Spick|2006|pp=231–232}}

Born in [[Pniewo, Złotów County|Pinnow]], Ihlefeld volunteered for military service in the ''[[Reichswehr]]'' of [[Nazi Germany]] in 1933.{{refn|From 1919, Germany's national defense force was known as the ''Reichswehr''. That name was dropped in favor of ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' on 16 March 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |work= |title=Proklamation der Reichsregierung an das deutsche Volk bezüglich der Einführung der allgemeinen Wehrpflicht |trans-title=Proclamation of the German Government to the German people regarding the introduction of compulsory military service |url=http://www.documentarchiv.de/ns/1935/allgemein-wehrpflicht-einfuehrung_prokl.html |language=German |accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Note"}} Initially serving in the ''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]'' (Army), he transferred to the ''Luftwaffe'' (Air Force) in 1935. Following flight training, he volunteered for service with the [[Condor Legion]] during the Spanish Civil War where he was assigned to [[Jagdgruppe 88|''Jagdgruppe'' 88]] (J/88—88th Fighter Group). From February–July 1938, he claimed nine aerial victories, two remained unconfirmed. For his service in Spain he was awarded the [[Spanish Cross]] in Gold with Swords.

Following service in Spain, Ihlefeld was posted to [[Lehrgeschwader 2|''Lehrgeschwader'' 2]] (LG&amp;nbsp;2—2nd Demonstration Wing. With this unit he participated in the [[Invasion of Poland]] and [[Battle of France]]. During the height of the [[Battle of Britain]] on 13 September 1940, he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] after 21 aerial victories in World War II. Ihlefeld, who had been appointed ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' (group commander) of I.

During [[Operation Barbarossa]], the German invasion of the Soviet Union, he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] on 27 June 1941. Ten months later, following his 101st aerial victory of the war, Ihlefeld was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]] on 24 April 1942.

On 22 June 1942, Ihlefeld was appointed ''[[Geschwaderkommodore]]'' (wing commander) of [[Jagdgeschwader 52|''Jagdgeschwader'' 52]] (JG&amp;nbsp;52—52nd Fighter Wing). He was injured in combat on 22 July 1942 and after convalescence, he was given command of [[Jagdfliegerschule|''Jagdfliegerschule'' 3]] (3rd Fighter Pilot School). On 21 July 1943, he was tasked with leadership of a high flying [[de Havilland Mosquito]] intercept unit called [[Jagdgeschwader 25|''Jagdgeschwader'' 25]] (JG&amp;nbsp;25—25th Fighter Wing) in [[Defense of the Reich]]. This unit failed to achieve its objective and Ihlefeld was assigned to the ''[[Stab (Luftwaffe designation)|Stab]]'' (headquarters unit) of the [[30th Fighter Division (Germany)|30th Fighter Division]]. On 20 May 1944, he took command of [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War II)|''Jagdgeschwader'' 1]] "Oesau" (JG&amp;nbsp; 1—1st Fighter Wing) and participated in [[Operation Bodenplatte]]. Ihlefeld died on 8 August 1995 in [[Wennigsen]], [[Lower Saxony]].

==Early life and career==

''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933–45)#Gruppe|Gruppe]]'' (1st group) of [[Jagdgeschwader 132|''Jagdgeschwader'' 132]] "Richthofen" (JG&amp;nbsp;32—132nd Fighter Wing).{{sfn|Obermaier|1989|p=31}}&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;For an explanation of ''Luftwaffe'' unit designations see [[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933–45)|Organization of the ''Luftwaffe'' during World War II]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Legion-Condor-Badge-2nd-Squadron-Fighter-Group-88.jpg|thumb|right|2. ''Staffel'' insignia]]
With outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in July 1936, Germany supported the [[National faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]] and asked for volunteers which organized in the [[Condor Legion]] ({{lang|de|Legion Condor}}). ''[[Unteroffizier]]'' (Staff Sergeant) Ihlefeld joined 2. ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933–45)#Staffel|Staffel]]'' (2nd squadron) of [[Jagdgruppe 88|''Jagdgruppe'' 88]] (J/88—88th Fighter Group) in late 1937. Flying with this unit until July 1938, he claimed nine and was credited with seven aerial victories over Spain and was awarded the [[Spanish Cross|Spanish Cross in Gold with Swords]] (''Spanienkreuz in Gold mit Schwertern''). There, he was issued one of the first [[Messerschmitt Bf 109 variants#Bf 109 A/B/C/D|Messerschmitt Bf&amp;nbsp;109&amp;nbsp;B-1]]'s sent to the Condor Legion.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=48}} A [[Polikarpov I-16]] fighter aircraft shot down on 21 February 1938 was his first aerial victory of the war.{{sfn|Forsyth|2011|p=90}} On 13 March 1938, Ihlefeld was credited with his second victory, a [[Polikarpov I-15]] biplane fighter aircraft followed by his third, a I-16, on 11 May 1938. A week later, on 18 May, he claimed another I-16, the victory was unconfirmed. A [[Tupolev SB|Tupolev SB-2]] bomber from a force attacking [[La Sénia]], shot down on 2 June 1938, became his fifth victim.{{sfn|Forsyth|2011|p=94}} He claimed another unconfirmed victory on 25 June 1938 over a I-16. On 12 July 1938, he was credited with a victory over a I-15. Two I-15s shot down on 15 July 1938 were his last victories in Spain.{{sfn|Forsyth|2011|p=103}}

On 1 August 1938, he was assigned to I. (''[[Jagdwaffe|Jäger]]'') ''Gruppe'' (1st fighter group) of [[Lehrgeschwader 2|''Lehrgeschwader'' 2]] (LG&amp;nbsp;2—2nd Demonstration Wing), an operational training unit tasked with the evaluation of new types of aircraft and tactics. The unit was later redesignated to I. ''Gruppe'' of [[Jagdgeschwader 77|''Jagdgeschwader'' 77]] (JG&amp;nbsp;77—77th Fighter Wing). On 20 August 1938, he was promoted to ''[[Leutnant]]'' (second lieutenant).{{sfn|Stockert|1996|p=122}}

==World War II==
World War II in Europe began on Friday, 1 September 1939, when German forces [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]]. Ihlefeld flew his first [[Military operation|combat missions]] over Poland and was awarded the [[Iron Cross]] 2nd Class ({{lang|de|Eisernes Kreuz zweiter Klasse}}) on 26 September 1939.{{sfn|Stockert|1996|p=122}} On 10 May 1940, the [[Battle of France]], the German invasion of France and the [[Low Countries]], began and Ihlefeld claimed his first victory of the war on 29 May 1940.{{sfn|Obermaier|1989|p=31}} The combat took place at an altitude of {{convert|2500|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} near [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne|Saint-Quentin]] during the [[Battle of Dunkirk]] (26 May&amp;nbsp;– 4 June 1940), the defense and evacuation of British and allied forces from France to England, on a [[combat air patrol]]. On this mission, 11 [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]s encountered two ''[[French Air Force|Armée de l'air]]'' (French Air Force) [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406]] fighter aircraft. Ihlefeld was credited with shooting one of them down at 20:15, the other Morane was credited to ''[[Hauptmann]]'' (Captain) Hanns Trübenbach.{{sfn|Prien|1992|p=304}} On 30 June 1940, he was credited with two victories over [[Bristol Blenheim]] light bombers shot down at 12:45 and 15:30, his second and third of the war.{{sfn|Prien|1992|p=327}} Although Ihlefeld was unhurt, damage to his Bf&amp;nbsp;109&amp;nbsp;E sustained in one of these encounters, resulted in a [[forced landing]] near [[Saint-Omer]].{{sfn|Prien|1992|p=329}}

Ihlefeld received an early promotion to ''[[Oberleutnant]]'' (first lieutenant) on 1 June 1940 followed by his appointment to ''[[Staffelkapitän]]'' (squadron leader) of 2 ''Staffel'' in I.(J)/LG&amp;nbsp;2.{{refn|According to Prien, the appointment to ''[[Staffelkapitän]]'' (squadron leader) of 2 ''Staffel'' of I.(J)/LG&amp;nbsp;2 occurred sometime in June 1940.{{sfn|Prien|1995|p=2372}} According to Obermaier, this happened on 1 July 1940.{{sfn|Obermaier|1989|p=31}}|group="Note"}} He was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class ({{lang|de|Eisernes Kreuz erster Klasse}}) on 4 July 1940.{{sfn|Stockert|1996|p=122}} On 9 July 1940, I.(J)/LG&amp;nbsp;2 was tasked with flying [[escort fighter]] missions for [[Kampfgeschwader 2|''Kampfgeschwader'' 2]] (KG&amp;nbsp;2—2nd Bomber Wing) attacking British shipping in the [[English Channel]]. These types of missions were referred to as ''[[Kanalkampf]]'' by the Germans and resulted in a series of air battles between the ''Luftwaffe'' and the British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF). On the third mission of the day (16:25&amp;nbsp;– 17:20), escorting a flight of [[Dornier Do 17]] bombers to their targets, Ihlefeld claimed his fourth victory of the war, a [[Hawker Hurricane]] fighter aircraft shot down at 16:30.{{sfn|Prien|1992|p=334}}

===Battle of Britain and Channel Front===
On 10 July 1940, seven RAF bombers attacked the [[Amiens – Glisy Aerodrome]], all of which were shot down by the ''Luftwaffe''. On this day, 47 Do&amp;nbsp;17 bombers from I. and III. ''Gruppe'' of KG&amp;nbsp;2, supported by one [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] [[heavy fighter]] and two single-engined fighter ''Gruppen'' attacked British shipping in the English Channel. In the resulting aerial combat, ''Luftwaffe'' pilots initially claimed 23 victories, 10 of these were later confirmed by the ''Luftwaffe''. Actual RAF losses that day were three aircraft shot down, further seven made forced landings and were severely damaged. RAF pilots claimed the destruction of 16 German aircraft, actual losses were four Do&amp;nbsp;17s and three Bf&amp;nbsp;110s shot down plus further four damaged aircraft. These events marked the beginning of the [[Battle of Britain]] (10 July&amp;nbsp;– 31 October 1940).{{sfn|Prien|1992|p=335}}

On 11 July 1940, I.(J)/LG&amp;nbsp;2 was ordered to relocate to [[Jever]] in northern Germany. In the following four weeks, the Gruppe received a period of rest and the aircraft were given a maintenance overhaul prior to moving back to the Channel Front, to an airfield at [[Marck, Pas-de-Calais|Marck]], east of [[Calais]], on 8 August.{{sfn|Prien|1992|pp=336, 343}} [[Adolf Hitler]] had issued [[Führer Directives|Führer Directive]] no. 17 (''Weisung Nr.'' 17) on 1 August 1940; the strategic objective was to engage and defeat the RAF so as to achieve [[air superiority]] in preparation for [[Operation Sea Lion]] (''Unternehmen Seelöwe''), the proposed amphibious invasion of Great Britain.{{sfn|Prien|1992|p=338}} On 13 August 1940, during [[Operation Eagle Attack]] (code name ''[[Adlertag]]''), I.(J)/LG&amp;nbsp;2 was tasked with providing fighter escort for [[Junkers Ju 87]] [[dive bomber]]s from IV. ''Gruppe'' of [[Lehrgeschwader 1|''Lehrgeschwader'' 1]] (LG&amp;nbsp;1—1st Demonstration Wing) and II.

On 22 August 1940, I.(J)/LG&amp;nbsp;2 flew a combat air patrol over [[Southern England]]. Taking his total to seven victories, Ihlefeld had claimed two [[Supermarine Spitfire]] fighters shot down in the vicinity of [[Dover]]. Five Spitfires were lost by [[Fighter Command]] on this day.{{sfn|Mason|1969|p=292}} Weather conditions improved over Southern England on 24 August 1940 and I.(J)/LG&amp;nbsp;2 was ordered to fly a combat air patrol over [[Kent]].{{sfn|Prien|1992|p=357}} The ''Gruppe'' flew three missions that day and claimed ten aerial victories, all of which over Spitfires, two of which were credited to Ihlefeld. Ihlefeld's first victory was claimed at 12:30 and the second at 17:00.{{sfn|Prien|1992|p=359}} Fighter Command lost five Spitfires and one damaged on 24 August. Two losses roughly match Ihlefeld's claim. [[No. 54 Squadron RAF|No. 54 Squadron]] lost one; Pilot Officer C. Stewart bailed out in the afternoon, the time unknown. Pilot Officer D. Mc Gray was shot down at 11:15 GMT and bailed out of the [[No. 610 Squadron RAF|No. 610 Squadron]] Spitfire ''X4067''. Both men were shot down near Dover.{{sfn|Mason|1969|pp=298–299}}

On 30 August 1940, Ihlefeld claimed his tenth victory of the war, another Spitfire probably shot down over the English Channel near Calais. On this day, ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' (group commander) of I.(J)/LG&amp;nbsp;2, ''Hauptmann'' Bernhard Mielke, was [[killed in action]]. Later that day, Ihlefeld was appointed his successor as ''Gruppenkommandeur''.{{sfn|Prien|1992|p=363}} The next day, I.(J)/LG&amp;nbsp;2 flew fighter escort missions for II.(S)/LG&amp;nbsp;2, the ground attack ''Gruppe'' of LG&amp;nbsp;2. On two separate missions they attacked the airfield at [[London Biggin Hill Airport|Biggin Hill]] on their first mission (10:25&amp;nbsp;– 11:20), and in the evening [[Croydon Airport|Croydon]] airfield. The German flight believed they encountered Hurricanes from [[No. 303 Polish Fighter Squadron]] on the second mission. The Germans claimed four victories, one of which by Ihlefeld, for the loss of two in combat.{{sfn|Prien|1992|p=368}} 303 Squadron, if engaged during this day, suffered no fighters damaged or destroyed on this day. Their likely opponents were from [[No. 17 Squadron RAF|No. 17 Squadron]] which lost one Hurricane. The pilot Sergeant G.A Steward was unhurt. I./LG&amp;nbsp;2 lost one Bf&amp;nbsp;109 destroyed and one sixty percent damaged. ''Oberleutnant'' von Perthes was shot down and killed by Flying Officer T. Bird-Wilson.{{sfn|Mason|1969|p=331}}

On 2 September 1940, he increased his total to 13 aerial victories, claiming two Spitfires, on a mission against the [[RAF Hornchurch|Hornchurch]] airfield.{{sfn|Prien|1992|p=373}} No Spitfires were lost in the battle over Hornchrch though two Spitfires belonging to [[No. 222 Squadron RAF|No. 222 Squadron]] were damaged.{{sfn|Mason|1969|p=340}} Three day later, Detling airfield was the target, and Ihlefeld again claimed two Spitfires shot down.{{sfn|Prien|1992|p=374}} On 6 September, I.(J)/LG&amp;nbsp;2 escorted [[Schnellkampfgeschwader 210|''Erprobungsgruppe'' 210]] to various airfields in the greater London area. Again Ihlefeld claimed two victories, two Hurricanes shot down took his total to 17 aerial victories.{{sfn|Prien|1992|p=377}} 19 Hurricanes were destroyed to all causes and two damaged on this date in intensive air battles.{{sfn|Mason|1969|pp=355–356}}

[[File:Heinkel over Wapping.jpg|thumb|left|[[Heinkel He 111]] bomber over the [[Surrey Commercial Docks|Surrey docks]] and [[Wapping]] in the East End of London on 7 September 1940]]
On 7 September 1940, I.(J)/LG&amp;nbsp;2 participated in [[The Blitz#Loge and Seeschlange|Operation "Loge"]], 350 bombers escorted by 648 fighters, attacked various targets in the greater London area. Ihlefeld's ''Gruppe'' protected those bombers heading for the [[Dock (maritime)|docks]] in the [[East End of London]]. On this mission, Ihlefeld claimed a Hurricane shot down at 18:05 and another one at 18:10.{{sfn|Prien|1992|p=382}} 17 Hurricanes were destroyed and 7 damaged this day. Up to 19 of these aircraft were hit or destroyed in the time-frame of the claim.{{sfn|Mason|1969|pp=365–366}} The ''Luftwaffe'' flew another large scale attack on 11 September. In total, 280 bombers, 96 of which headed for London, supported by 750 fighter aircraft, headed for England. Ihlefeld claimed a Spitfire destroyed at 17:05 and a Hurricane at 17:10 that day.{{sfn|Prien|1992|p=385}} This took his total to 21 aerial victories in World War II, for which he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] ({{lang|de|Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes}}) on 13 September 1940. The presentation was made by Hitler personally on 16 September 1940.{{sfn|Stockert|1996|p=122}} One day before the presentation, the [[Battle of Britain Day]], Ihlefeld had claimed the 22nd aerial victory, a Hurricane.{{sfn|Prien|1992|p=387}} At 10:00 on 24 September 1940, Ihlefeld engaged Spitfire's in combat over [[Maidstone]], claiming one shot down.{{sfn|Prien|1992|p=394}} There were four Spitfires lost and two damaged in combat on this date. None were shot down at the time of the claim or in this district.{{sfn|Mason|1969|p=410}} Three days later, on a fighter escort to mission to London, he claimed two Hurricanes, taking his total to 25 aerial victories. On this mission, Ihlefeld lost his 1. ''Staffel'' commander, ''Oberleutnant'' Adolf Buhl.{{sfn|Prien|1992|p=396}} Responsible for his loss was ''[[Fähnrich]]'' (Officer Candidate) [[Hans-Joachim Marseille]] who had abandoned Buhl. Ihlefeld was forced to give Marseille a stern rebuke for his conduct in combat and eventually dismissed Marseille from LG&amp;nbsp;2.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2012|pp=18–20}} He was promoted to ''Hauptmann'' on 1 October 1940.{{sfn|Stockert|1996|p=122}}

The war of attrition against the RAF had cost I.(J)/LG&amp;nbsp;2 dearly, and the entire ''Gruppe'' had to be moved back to the home airfield [[Cologne Butzweilerhof Airport|Köln-Butzweilerhof]] to reform and re-equip on 5 November 1940. From 30 June to end of October 1940, the ''Gruppe'' had claimed 92 aerial victories for the loss of 10 pilots either killed or missing in action, further 4 pilots had been taken prisoner of war. In the same timeframe, 38 aircraft were damaged or lost.{{sfn|Prien|1992|p=420}} I.(J)/LG&amp;nbsp;2 was ordered back to the Channel Front on 26 December 1940. That day, it flew to the airfield at Calais-Marck and was subordinated to the [[Stab (Luftwaffe designation)|''Stab'']] (headquarters unit) of [[Jagdgeschwader 52|''Jagdgeschwader'' 52]] (JG&amp;nbsp;52—52nd Fighter Wing).{{sfn|Prien|1992|p=450}} Ihlefeld claimed his 26th victory of the war at 15:50 on 17 January 1941 northwest of [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]].{{sfn|Prien|1992|p=457}}

On 5 February 1941, the RAF began the [[Circus offensive]] against the ''Luftwaffe'', a series of attacks flown by heavily escorted bombers targeted the coastal region in northern France. Ihlefeld claimed a Spitfire destroyed at 17:35 on 10 February. The RAF had sent a Circus against various targets in the vicinity of [[Pas-de-Calais]].{{sfn|Prien|1992|pp=460, 462–463}} Four days later, he claimed two Spitfires shot down on a combat air patrol over [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]] and [[Canterbury]].{{sfn|Prien|1992|p=467}} On 26 February 1941, Ihlefeld shot down Sergeant Howard Squire, his 30th victory of the war, in his Spitfire from No. 54 Squadron on Circus No.&amp;nbsp;5 mission.{{sfn|Prien|1992|pp=471–472}} Twelve Blenheim bombers from [[No. 139 Squadron RAF|No. 139 Squadron]] had targeted harbor installations at Calais.

The [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkan Campaign]] began on 6 April 1941, with multiple objectives. [[Operation Marita]] was the codename for the German invasion of Greece, while I.(J)/LG&amp;nbsp;2 was committed to the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]]. Based at [[Radomir (town)|Radomir]] in Bulgaria, the unit was subordinated to ''[[Generaloberst]]'' (Colonel General) [[Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen]]'s [[8th Air Corps (Germany)|VIII. ''Fliegerkorps'']] (8th Air Corps).{{sfn|Prien|1992|p=488}} I.(J)/LG&amp;nbsp;2 primary targets in this campaign were various ''[[Yugoslav Royal Air Force|Jugoslovensko Kraljevsko Ratno Vazduhoplovstvo]]'' (JKRV—Yugoslav Royal Air Force) airfields in the greater [[Skopje]] area. The ''Gruppe'', together with the ground attack unit II.(S)/LG&amp;nbsp;2, flew five combat missions on the first day of the campaign. During one of these missions, [[strafing]] the railway up the [[Vardar]] valley and an airfield near [[Niš]], Ihlefeld was shot down in his Bf&amp;nbsp;109&amp;nbsp;E-7 (''Werknummer'' 2057—factory number) by [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft artillery]] and was captured by Yugoslavian soldiers.{{sfn|Prien|1992|pp=496, 498}}{{refn|1=According to Ciglic, Weal and Savic, Ihlefeld shot down a JKRV [[Potez 25]] on the landing approach, Shortly after, he was hit by a lucky shot fired from the ground by Serbian kap Vlastimir Belic, forcing him to [[Parachute|bail out]] near [[Donji Dušnik]].{{sfn|Ciglic|Weal|Savic|2013|p=27}}|group="Note"}} The airfield at Niš was practically deserted and Ihlefeld had been hit by small arms fire and was slightly wounded in the head.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=194}} While in their custody, he was allegedly severely beaten, and threatened with execution by firing squad. On 14 April 1941, he was rescued by German troops of the [[5th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|5th Panzer Division]] after eight days in captivity, and returned to Germany to recover.{{sfn|Stockert|1996|p=122}}{{sfn|Prien|1992|pp=498, 514}}

The invasion of Yugoslavia ended when an armistice was signed on 17 April 1941.{{sfn|Prien|1992|p=522}} That day, I.(J)/LG&amp;nbsp;2 relocated to [[Ptolemaida]], Greece and to [[Larissa]] three days later.{{sfn|Prien|1992|pp=523, 531}} On 21 April, I.(J)/LG&amp;nbsp;2 flew missions against the port of [[Piraeus]] and [[Athens]] .{{sfn|Prien|1992|p=533}} I.(J)/LG&amp;nbsp;2 then moved to [[Eleusis]] on 27 April.{{sfn|Prien|1992|p=547}} The [[Battle of Greece]] ended on 30 April 1941 and the ''Gruppe'' was granted a period of rest which ended on 2 May 1941.{{sfn|Prien|1992|p=551}} In preparation for the [[Battle of Crete]] (20 May&amp;nbsp;– 1 June 1941), I.(J)/LG&amp;nbsp;2 flew reconnaissance missions over Crete on 13 May 1941.{{sfn|Prien|1992|p=566}} Missions against Crete were flown from an airfield at [[Molaoi]].{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=338}} One day later, the unit flew its first ground attack mission against various targets.{{sfn|Prien|1992|p=566}} On 22 May 1941, I.(J)/LG&amp;nbsp;2 successfully attacked {{HMS|Fiji|58|6}} off of Crete, damaging her severely.{{sfn|Prien|1992|p=566}} Ihlefeld was credited with his only aerial victory over Crete on 26 May 1941. His 36th victory was claimed over [[Maleme]] against a Hurricane fighter.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=383}}{{sfn|Prien|1992|p=606}} Actions over Crete ended for I.(J)/LG&amp;nbsp;2 on 31 May 1941. By this date, the ''Gruppe'' had claimed six aerial victories in this campaign. I.(J)/LG&amp;nbsp;2 was then withdrawn and relocated to [[Belgrad]] in preparation for [[Operation Barbarossa]], the German invasion of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Prien|1992|pp=614, 616}}

===Eastern Front===
On 18 June 1941, I.(J)/LG&amp;nbsp;2 was moved to [[Bucharest]] and placed under the command of JG&amp;nbsp;77. The ''Geschwader'' was located in the sector of [[Army Group South|''Heeresgruppe Süd'']] (Army Group South).{{sfn|Prien|1993|p=628}} Three days later, I.(J)/LG&amp;nbsp;2 moved to [[Roman, Bulgaria|Roman]].{{sfn|Prien|1993|p=630}} That evening, the pilots and ground crews were briefed of the upcoming invasion of the Soviet Union, which opened the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].{{sfn|Prien|1993|p=632}} At 3:20 on 22 June 1941, 70 Bf&amp;nbsp;109s of JG&amp;nbsp;77 and I.(J)/LG&amp;nbsp;2 crossed into Soviet airspace and attacked airfields and provided fighter protection for III. ''Gruppe'' of [[Kampfgeschwader 27|''Kampfgeschwader'' 27]] (KG&amp;nbsp;27—27th Bomber Wing).{{sfn|Prien|1993|p=635}} Ihlefeld claimed his first two victories, both SB-2 bombers, on the Eastern Front on 23 June 1941. JG&amp;nbsp;77 and I.(J)/LG&amp;nbsp;2 flew seven combat missions that day. On the first mission of the day, 34 Bf&amp;nbsp;109 provided fighter escort for two ''Gruppen'' of KG&amp;nbsp;27 in support of the advancing German ground forces. At 5:50, Ihlefeld claimed his 37th victory of the war.{{sfn|Prien|1993|p=628}} On the seventh mission, which began at 19:10, he claimed the second bomber in the area of [[Chernivtsi]].{{sfn|Prien|1993|p=644}} Two [[Ilyushin DB-3]] bombers shot down on 26 June 1941 took his total to 40 aerial victories in World War II.{{sfn|Prien|1993|p=651}} This achievement earned him the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] ({{Lang|de|Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub}}) on 27 June 1941. He was the 16th member of the German armed forces to be so honored.{{sfn|Stockert|1996|p=123}} That day, he was also mentioned in the ''[[Wehrmachtbericht]]'' radio report, the first of six such mentions.{{sfn|The Wehrmacht Reports 1939–1945 Volume 1|p=591}}

Ihlefeld, on a combat air patrol in the vicinity of [[Iași]], claimed a I-16 fighter aircraft shot down on 28 June.{{sfn|Prien|1993|p=654}} The next day I.(J)/LG&amp;nbsp;2 moved to an airfield at [[Uzhhorod]] and to [[Tudora, Ștefan Vodă|Tudora]] on 1 July 1941.{{sfn|Prien|1993|pp=657, 660}} On 2 July, I.(J)/LG&amp;nbsp;2 flew five combat missions and Ihlefeld achieved his 42nd aerial victory over a [[Polikarpov I-153]] biplane fighter.{{sfn|Prien|1993|p=663}} On a Stuka escort mission to [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]] on 4 July, he shot down a I-15.{{sfn|Prien|1993|p=666}} On 6 July, I.(J)/LG&amp;nbsp;2 flew seven combat missions, on two of which they had enemy contact. On the sixth mission of the day, the unit encountered five SB-2 bombers escorted by seven I-16 fighters. In the resulting aerial combat, Ihlefeld shot down one I-16, his 44th victory.{{sfn|Prien|1993|pp=669–670}}

On 30 August 1941 he became an "[[Aviators who became ace in a day|ace-in-a-day]]" by shooting down five Soviet aircraft, his 48th to 52nd aerial victories.{{sfn|Stockert|1996|p=123}}
In the spring of 1942, a series of multiple victories (five aircraft on 24 March, seven on 30 March and seven on 20 April), saw Ihlefeld become the fifth pilot on 22 April 1942 to reach 100 victories during World War II.{{sfn|Obermaier|1989|p=243}} During the period of Ihlefeld's leadership, ''I./JG 77'' was credited with the destruction of 323 enemy aircraft while losing only 17 [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]s.

===Wing Commander===
On 10 May 1942, Ihlefeld was replaced by ''Hauptmann'' [[Heinrich Bär]] as ''Gruppenkommandeur'' of I. ''Gruppe''. Ihlefeld had been selected to take over JG&amp;nbsp;52 as ''[[Geschwaderkommodore]]'' (Wing Commander). Prior to this appointment, he was sent to the ''Geschwaderstab'' of [[Jagdgeschwader 51|''Jagdgeschwader'' 51]] (JG&amp;nbsp;51—51st Fighter Wing) as a commander-in-training under ''Hauptmann'' [[Karl-Gottfried Nordmann]].{{sfn|Prien|1993|p=999}} In June 1942, Ihlefeld was promoted to ''[[Major (Germany)|Major]]'' (major) and on 26 June took command of JG&amp;nbsp;52.{{sfn|Stockert|1996|p=123}} On 22 July 1942, whilst flying over the front in his [[Fieseler Fi 156|Fieseler Fi&amp;nbsp;156 ''Storch'']], a small [[liaison aircraft]], he was shot down and badly wounded by Soviet fighters,{{sfn|Hayward|1998|p=146}} this took him out of the front line until July 1943, when he joined the newly formed [[Jagdgeschwader 25|''Jagdgeschwader'' 25]] (JG&amp;nbsp;25—25th Fighter Wing) as ''Geschwaderkommodore'', leading the group's high-altitude Bf 109s in ultimately unsuccessful operations against RAF [[de Havilland Mosquito]]s, and later [[United States Air Force]] (USAAF) heavy bomber formations in [[defense of the Reich]] missions.

On 1 February 1944, Ihlefeld was promoted to ''[[Oberstleutnant]]'' (lieutenant colonel).{{sfn|Stockert|1996|p=124}} In May 1944, he briefly became ''Geschwaderkommodore'' of [[Jagdgeschwader 11|''Jagdgeschwader'' 11]] (JG&amp;nbsp;11—11th Fighter Wing), before taking command of [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War 2)|''Jagdgeschwader'' 1]] "Oesau" (JG&amp;nbsp;1—1st Fighter Wing) on 20 May 1944. Ihlefeld replaced Bär as ''Geschwaderkommodore'' who had led the ''Geschwader'' since the death in combat of ''Oberst'' [[Walter Oesau]] on 11 May 1944.{{sfn|Mombeek|1992|pp=232–233}} On 14 July 1944, Ihlefeld claimed a [[North American P-51 Mustang]] and a Spitfire shot down.{{sfn|Mombeek|1992|p=251}} He was credited with his next victories on 25 July, claiming the destruction of a [[Avro Lancaster]] [[heavy bomber]] and a Spitfire.{{sfn|Mombeek|1992|p=252}}

===Operation Bodenplatte and end of war===
Ihlefeld participated and led JG&amp;nbsp;1 in [[Operation Bodenplatte]], the failed attempt to cripple [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] air forces in the Low Countries. The objective of Bodenplatte was to gain air superiority during the stagnant stage of the [[Battle of the Bulge]] and dates back to meeting held on 16 September 1944. That day, Hitler informed ''[[General der Flieger]]'' (Lieutenant General) [[Werner Kreipe]], acting Chief of the [[General Staff]] of the ''Luftwaffe'', about the planned offensive.{{sfn|Manrho|Pütz|2010|p=1}} Ihlefeld probably learned of this operation on 5 December 1944.{{sfn|Manrho|Pütz|2010|p=12}} ''[[Luftwaffenkommando West]]'' (Air Command West) had ordered every wing commander of all the ''[[Jagdgeschwader]]s'' destined to participate in the operation to attend a meeting at the headquarters of [[2nd Fighter Corps (Germany)|II. ''Jagdkorps'']] (2nd Fighter Corps) at [[Flammersfeld]] near [[Koblenz]].{{sfn|Manrho|Pütz|2010|p=2}} At the time, Ihlefeld was faced with a very challenging leadership situation. Prior to the operation, JG&amp;nbsp;1 had lost the commander of I. ''Gruppe'', ''Hauptmann'' [[Hans Ehlers]] who was killed in action on 27 December, and the commander of III. ''Gruppe'', ''Hauptmann'' [[Erich Woitke]] who had been killed in action on 24 December. The commander of II. ''Gruppe'', ''Hauptmann'' [[Hermann Staiger]], had landed his combat damaged aircraft at Frankfurt and had not yet returned to his unit.{{sfn|Manrho|Pütz|2010|p=12}} On the early afternoon of 31 December 1944, Ihlefeld summoned his three new ''Gruppenkommandeure'' to [[Twente]] for the mission briefing. The new I. ''Gruppe'' commander was ''Hauptmann'' Georg Hackbarth, II. ''Gruppe'' was led by ''Oberleutnant'' Fritz Wegner and III. ''Gruppe'' was now headed by ''Hauptmann'' Harald Moldenhauer.{{sfn|Manrho|Pütz|2010|p=13}}

On 1 January 1945, the ''Geschwaderstab'' and I. ''Gruppe'', both based at Twente, took off at 8:10 and joined up with and III. ''Gruppe'', based at [[Rheine-Bentlage Air Base|Rheine]], which had taken off at 8:15. Their designated targets were the airfields at [[Maldegem]] and [[Ursel Airfield|Ursel]]. The formation was led by four [[Junkers Ju 88]] [[night fighter]]s from [[Nachtjagdgeschwader 1|''Nachtjagdgeschwader'' 1]] (NJG&amp;nbsp;1—1st Night Fighter Wing); they were the pathfinders for the single-engined fighters.{{sfn|Manrho|Pütz|2010|p=5}} The formation of 20 [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190|Focke&amp;nbsp;Wulf Fw&amp;nbsp;190&amp;nbsp;A-8]]s and 30 Bf&amp;nbsp;109&amp;nbsp;G-14s, flying at an altitude of {{Convert|50|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}, headed west. As the flight approached [[The Hague]], they came under heavy and precise German anti-artillery fire. The German anti-artillery units had not been informed of the ''Luftwaffe'' operation. Several aircraft were hit, including the aircraft of Ihlefeld who had to make a forced landing near [[Rotterdam]]. II. ''Gruppe'', based at Drope, between [[Lengerich, Lower Saxony|Lengerich]] and [[Bawinkel]], had also taken off at 8:15 and headed for the airfield at [[Ghent]]/Sint-Denijs-Westrem. ( Polish Fighter Wing No 131, Sq 301/308/317 Spitfire IX/XVI ){{sfn|Mombeek|1992|p=290}}{{sfn|Manrho|Pütz|2010|p=19}} JG&amp;nbsp;1 continued with their mission without Ihlefeld leading the decisive phase of the attack. The result of the attack can be described as [[Pyrrhic victory]] at best. JG&amp;nbsp;1 claimed the destruction of around 60 enemy aircraft, of which 54 were destroyed on the ground, for the loss of 25 pilots and 29 aircraft.{{sfn|Manrho|Pütz|2010|p=39}}

[[File:Heinkel He 162 in France 1945.jpg|thumb|right|He&amp;nbsp;162&amp;nbsp;A-2 (''Werknummer'' 120230) in France, brought to the USA by [[Operation Lusty]]]]
Following of Operation Bodenplatte, and failing to maintain air superiority over the Ardennes area, a severely weakened II. ''Gruppe'' transferred to [[Insterburg]] in [[East Prussia]], present-day [[Chernyakhovsk]] in Russia. I. ''Gruppe'' faced RAF fighters over [[Hengelo|Hengelo-Twente]] on 14 January 1945. JG&amp;nbsp;1 lost 12 pilots with 7 being killed, 3 wounded and 2 missing. Spitfires shot down the entire 1. and 2. ''Staffeln'' of JG&amp;nbsp;1 at [[Enschede Airport Twente|Twente airport]] as they took off, for the loss of two. Ihlefeld threatened to [[court martial]] ''Major'' Günther Capito, the new commander of I. ''Gruppe'', for such a disastrous loss but was unable to during the transferring to the Eastern Front. In Poland JG&amp;nbsp;1 were briefly assigned to ''[[Luftflotte Reich]]'' (Air Fleet Reich).

He was promoted to ''[[Oberst]]'' (colonel) on 30 January 1945.{{sfn|Stockert|1996|p=124}} Late in the war, elements of the ''Geschwader'' were equipped with the [[Heinkel He 162|He 162 ''Volksjäger'']], a single-engine, jet-powered fighter aircraft. He&amp;nbsp;162&amp;nbsp;A-2 (''Werknummer'' 120230), Ihlefeld flew this aircraft during the war, is currently in possession of the [[National Air and Space Museum]] collection.{{sfn|Skaarup|2009|p=248}}

==Later life==
In 1984, Winston Ramsey, the editor of ''[[After the Battle]]'' magazine, contacted both Ihlefeld and Squire, who Ihlefeld had shot down on 26 February 1941, and arranged a meeting. Subsequently, Ihlefeld and Squire met at Calais.{{sfn|Price|2012|loc=chptr. 18 "Act of Chivalry"}} Ihlefeld died on 8 August 1995 in [[Wennigsen]], [[Lower Saxony]]. His ashes were buried on the [[urn]] field near the chapel on the old cemetery in [[Kirchheim unter Teck]], [[Baden-Württemberg]].{{sfn|Stockert|1996|p=124}}

==Summary of career==

===Aerial victory claims===
Matthews and Foreman, authors of ''Luftwaffe Aces — Biographies and Victory Claims'', researched the [[German Federal Archives]] and found documentation for 122 aerial victory claims, plus five further unconfirmed claims. This number includes nine claims during the Spanish Civil War, 48 on the Western Front, including three four-engined bombers, and 65 on the Eastern Front.{{sfn|Matthews|Foreman|2015|pp=570–572}}

Victory claims were logged to a map-reference (PQ = ''Planquadrat''), for example "PQ 05 Ost S/ET-1". The ''Luftwaffe'' grid map ({{lang|de|Jägermeldenetz}}) covered all of Europe, western Russia and North Africa and was composed of rectangles measuring 15 [[Minute of arc|minutes]] of [[latitude]] by 30 minutes of [[longitude]], an area of about {{Convert|360|sqmi|sqkm}}. These sectors were then subdivided into 36 smaller units to give a location area 3 × 4&amp;nbsp;km in size.{{sfn|''Planquadrat''}}

'''Waltz''' is one of the five dances in the Standard (or Modern) category of the [[Glossary_of_partner_dance_terms#International_Standard|International Style]] [[ballroom dance]]s. It was previously referred to as '''Slow Waltz''' or '''English Waltz'''.

Waltz is usually the first dance in the [[Dancesport]] competition rounds.  It is danced exclusively in the [[closed position]], unlike its [[American Style]] counterpart.

==History==

The Waltz [[Waltz|originated as a folk dance from Austria]]. Predecessors include the "Matenick" and a variation called the "[[Furiant]]" that were performed during rural festivals in Bohemia. The French dance, "Walt", and the Austrian [[Ländler]] are the most similar to the waltz among its predecessors.

The "king of dances" acquired different national traits in different countries. Thus there appeared the English Waltz, the Hungarian Waltz, and the Waltz-[[Mazurka]].  The "Waltz" is derived from the old German word "walzen" meaning "to roll, turn", or "to glide".  Waltz was danced competitively since 1923 or 1924.

==Music==

International Standard Waltz is a [[Waltz]] dance and danced to slow [[waltz music]], preferably 28-30 bars per minute (84-90 beats per minute).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worlddancesport.org/doc/competition/rules%20and%20bidding/2010/IDSF_Competition_Rules_2010-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wddsc.com/granted-titles/rules/index08e.htm WDC Competition Rules]&lt;/ref&gt;  Waltz music is in 3/4 [[time (music)|time]] and the 1st [[beat (music)|beat]] of a [[bar (music)|measure]] is strongly accented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ballroomdancers.com/Dances/dance_overview.asp?Dance=WAL BallroomDancers.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character==

Like all Standard category dances, Waltz is a [[Glossary of partner dance terms#Progressive dance|progressive dance]], meaning that dancers travel along a path known as the [[Glossary of partner dance terms#Line of dance|line of dance]]. It is characterized by [[pendulum swing]] movements and incorporates general elements of ballroom technique such as foot parallelism, rise and fall, [[contra body movement]] and [[sway (dance)|sway]].

Most of the {{clarify span|basic figures|date=November 2014}} have one step per beat (three per measure), whereas {{clarify span|advanced figures|date=November 2014}} have four to six steps per measure. The faster pace of the advanced figures, especially when combined with [[dance turns]], results in fast-paced, dynamic dancing despite the relatively slow music tempo. Slow steps and elegant poses are often used to contrast fast-paced dance segments, resulting in what is sometimes referred to as ''light and shade''.

==Syllabus==

This is the [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing|ISTD]] [[International_Standard_(dance)#International_Standard|International Standard]] syllabus.&lt;ref&gt;The Ballroom Technique; Moore, Alex (2006). Published by [[Imperial_Society_of_Teachers_of_Dancing|ISTD]] ASIN: B000PH46KI.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court also concluded that the Israeli régime violates the basic human rights of the Palestinians by impeding the liberty of movement of the inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory (with the exception of Israeli citizens) and their exercise of the right to work, to health, to education and to an adequate standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;See the Judgment in "Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory", para 120, 134, and 142 {{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1671.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706021237/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1671.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-06 |df= }} and PAUL J.

In Hebron, where 500-600 settlers live among 167,000 Palestinians, B'Tselem argues that there have been "grave violations" of Palestinian human rights because of the "presence of the settlers within the city". The organization cites regular incidents of "almost daily physical violence and property damage by settlers in the city", curfews and restrictions of movement that are "among the harshest in the Occupied Territories", and violence by Israeli border policemen and the IDF against Palestinians who live in the city's [[Hebron#Post Oslo Accord|H2 sector]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.btselem.org/English/Publications/Summaries/200308_Hebron_Area_H2.asp |title=Hebron, Area H-2: Settlements Cause Mass Departure of Palestinians }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2001/04/11/isrlpa241.htm |title=Mounting Human Rights Crisis in Hebron}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=331234&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=1&amp;sbSubContrassID=0&amp;listSrc=Y |title=Israeli human rights group slams Hebron settlers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human Rights Watch]] reports on physical violence against Palestinians by settlers, including, "frequent[ly] stoning and shooting at Palestinian cars. In many cases, settlers abuse Palestinians in front of Israeli soldiers or police with little interference from the authorities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2001/02/27/isrlpa254.htm |title=Israel: Palestinian Drivers Routinely Abused}}&lt;/ref&gt;

B'Tselem also says that settler actions include "blocking roadways, so as to impede Palestinian life and commerce. The settlers also shoot solar panels on roofs of buildings, torch automobiles, shatter windowpanes and windshields, destroy crops, uproot trees, abuse merchants and owners of stalls in the market. Some of these actions are intended to force Palestinians to leave their homes and farmland, and thereby enable the settlers to gain control of them."&lt;ref name="NotV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btselem.org/english/Settler_Violence/Nature_of_the_Violence.asp |title=The Nature of Settler Violence |accessdate=2008-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes of violence==
One of the causes of violence is [[vigilante]] action caused by Palestinians violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-dRUGqwLSE4C&amp;pg=PA158|title=The Israeli-Palestinian War: Escalating to Nowhere|last=Cordesman|first=Anthony H.|last2=Moravitz|first2=Jennifer|date=2005-01-01|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780275987589|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pedahzur|first=Ami|last2=Perliger|first2=Arie|date=2003-09-01|title=The causes of vigilante political violence: The case of Jewish settlers|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13698240308402542|journal=Civil Wars|volume=6|issue=3|pages=9-30|doi=10.1080/13698240308402542|issn=1369-8249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights group [[B'Tselem]] says that the violence is "a means to harass and intimidate Palestinians" and that the evacuations are a necessary part of the peace process. According to B'Tselem, when a building is evacuated by the Israeli government, settlers lash out at Palestinians because they're "easy victims" and as a means to widen the area under settler control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.coxwashington.com/hp/content/reporters/stories/2008/07/8/17/2008/08/25/ISRAEL_SETTLERCRIME17_COX.html |title=Settlers Increase Attacks On Palestinians In West Bank |first=Robert W. |last=Gee |date=2008-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ghassan Daghlas, a Palestinian Authority official who deals with the settlements issue in the northern West Bank, said, ''These groups of settlers are organised and support each other...If there’s an outpost evacuation, they call people from Hebron to Jenin to stop the Palestinians working on their lands''. Michael Sfard, a lawyer with [[Yesh Din]], an Israeli human rights group which monitors the violation of human rights in the [[Palestinian territories]], stated that there are between a few dozen and a few hundred extremist settlers using a tactic called ''[[Price tag policy|Price Tagging]]'': if the Government sends police or soldiers to dismantle an outpost that is being built, the settlers make the Palestinian population pay the price. While people in the outpost are confronting the security forces, others start harassing Palestinians, forcing commanders to divert men from the outpost and making them think twice about launching future operations. ''It’s such a big headache that many of the relevant authorities give up without trying'' and the outposts are quickly rebuilt once the army gives up and leaves.&lt;ref name="Price Tag"&gt;{{cite news | last = Hider | first = James | date = October 15, 2009 | title = West Bank settlers use ‘price tag’ tactic to punish Palestinians | work = [[The Times]] | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6875304.ece | accessdate = October 16, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of violence by settler leaders==
The violence by extremist settlers against Palestinians has been condemned by leading religious, political and municipal figures in the West Bank, including Rabbi [[Menachem Fruman]] of [[Tekoa, Gush Etzion|Tekoa]], who said: "Targeting Palestinians and their property is a shocking thing, (...) It's an act of hurting humanity. (...) This builds a wall of fire between Jews and Arabs."&lt;ref name="ynetnews.com"/&gt; According to Israeli Defense Minister [[Moshe Ya'alon]], "most of those extreme right wing activists" are not settlers and do not represent the settlements community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ya'alon: we know who are the assailants at Duma|issue=994|publisher=Makor Rishon|date=September 11, 2015|page=8|quote=It is necessary to know that most of those extreme right wing activists are not residents of Judea and Samaria and they definitely don't represent the settler-communities over there.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Yesha Council]] and former Knesset member [[Hanan Porat]] has also condemned violence against Palestinians. "The 'price tag' response is immoral", Porat said. "It's unheard of that one needs to burn the vineyards and fields of Arabs. It's immoral ... and it gives legitimacy to those who are interested in undermining the outpost issue. It's a very grave matter."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vosizneias.com/32682/2009/06/02/israel-rabbi-harshly-condemns-violence-by-jewish-hooligans-against-arabs/ Israel - Rabbi Harshly Condemns Violence by Jewish Hooligans Against Arabs, 2 June 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yesha Council]] is the umbrella organization of municipal councils of Jewish settlements in the West Bank. Council chairman [[Dani Dayan]] said that settlers must not use violence to advance their means. He said that such actions were "[[morally bankrupt]]" and serve only to "hinder the settlers' struggle".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=162620 Yesha Council chair Dayan condemns recent settler violence], Jerusalem Post 12/08/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justifications of settler violence==
When an 11-year-old Palestinian girl from Nablus was killed by settlers in 1983, in their defense, the chief rabbi of the Sephardic community reportedly cited a [[Talmud]]ic text justifying killing an enemy on occasions when one may see from a child’s perspective that he or she will grow up to become your enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Ghada Talhani, 'The Homeless Palestinians in Israel and the Arab world', in Robert J. Kelly,Jess Maghan (eds.) https://books.google.com/books?id=u1Kn7P_x6_gC&amp;pg=PA94 ''Hate Crime: The Global Politics of Polarization'', Southern Illinois University Press, 1998 pp. 83-110, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbis have been asked by settler militants to provide rulings to justify acts that are aimed to block peace with, or the return of land to, Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Byman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mYppAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA289 ''A High Price: The Triumphs and Failures of Israeli Counterterrorism,''] Oxford University Press, 2011 p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; The theft of Palestinian olive harvests has been justified by some rabbis. Former chief rabbi [[Mordechai Eliyahu]] stated that: "Since the land is the inheritance of the People of Israel, planting on this land by gentiles is planting on land that does not belong to them. If someone puts a tree on my land, both the tree and the fruit it yields belongs to me."&lt;ref&gt;[[Cheryl Rubenberg]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=NmXBmOGbHL4C&amp;pg=PA385 ''The Palestinians: In Search of a Just Peace''], Lynne Rienner Publishers, 2003 p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; Some rabbinical extremists cite the biblical edict to exterminate the [[Amalekites]] to justify both expelling Palestinians from the land and killing Arab civilians in wartime.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nur Masalha]],[https://books.google.com/books?id=vgGJo3wR6sQC&amp;pg=PA118 ''Imperial Israel and the Palestinians: The Politics of Expansion,''] Pluto Press, 2000 p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differing legal status and treatment of Israeli settlers and Palestinians==
Unlike Palestinians, Israeli civilians living in the Palestinian Territories are not subject to military or local law, but are prosecuted according to Israeli penal law. This originates in the Emergency Regulations bill enacted in 1967 and extended since which gives [[Extraterritoriality|extraterritorial rights]] to Israelis in the occupied territories. B'Tselem has said that the difference in legal status of Israelis and Palestinians in the territories has led to a double standard in which Israelis are given more legal rights and are punished more lightly than the Palestinians who are subject to military and local law. B'Tselem notes the system violates the principles of equality before the law and territoriality.&lt;ref name="btselem2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.btselem.org/english/Settler_Violence/Dual_Legal_System.asp |title=Settler violence: The dual system of law in the Occupied Territories |publisher=[[B'Tselem]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Referring to settler violence during the police evacuation of the "Federman Farm" near [[Kiryat Arba]], Haaretz has stated in an editorial "Israeli society has become accustomed to giving lawbreaking settlers special treatment", noting that no other group could similarly attack Israeli law enforcement agencies without being severely punished.&lt;ref name="haaretz2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1031614.html |title=Defeat settler terror |publisher=[[Haaretz]] |date=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Haaretz]] has characterized settler violence on soldiers and policemen who participated in the evacuation of the "Federman Farm" as "terrorism".&lt;ref name="haaretz2"/&gt;

In response to the violence directed towards Israeli security forces, Israel declared it would no longer fund any illegal outposts from November, 2008.&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite news |title=Israel cuts aid to outposts over settler violence |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=2009-10-03 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/11/03/2408502.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the evacuation of settlers from [[Hebron]] in December 2008, a riot ensued and a Jewish settler, Ze'ev Braude, was recorded on video shooting two unarmed Palestinians after Palestinians had hurled rocks at him. The victims were shot on their own property, which Braude had entered, and later needed surgery. The [[Israeli State Prosecutor's Office]] decided to abandon the prosecution of Braude after the [[Israeli High Court of Justice]] ruled that the prosecution must give the defendant access to "sensitive information". The prosecutor's office had earlier said that some of the evidence against Braude was classified for security reasons, due to "the Shin Bet's sources and methods of operation, and identifying details about its units and people". Braude had petitioned the High Court for access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1102478.html |title=When security trumps justice |date=2009-07-23 |publisher=[[Haaretz]] |first=Yair |last=Nevo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/after-controversial-release-settler-who-shot-2-palestinians-to-be-charged-today-1.259265 |title=After controversial release, settler who shot 2 Palestinians to be charged today |date=2008-12-11 |publisher=[[Haaretz]] |first=Jonathan |last=Lis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law enforcement action against settlers==
The [[United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict]] reported on rioting and violence in the [[West Bank]] in the period preceding the Israeli military operations in Gaza. The report said "Little if any action is taken by the Israeli authorities to investigate, prosecute and punish violence against Palestinians, including killings, by settlers and members of the security forces, resulting in a situation of impunity. The Mission concludes that Israel has failed to fulfil its obligations to protect the Palestinians from violence by private individuals under both international human rights law and international humanitarian law.&lt;ref name="Gaza Conflict 2009"&gt;See Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict, A/HRC/12/48, 25 September 2009, para 85&lt;/ref&gt; The report also stated that the International Court of Justice advisory opinion and "a number of United Nations resolutions have all affirmed that Israel’s practice of constructing settlements - in effect, the transfer by an occupying Power of parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies - constitutes a breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention".&lt;ref&gt;See Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict, A/HRC/12/48, 25 September 2009, para 198&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Amos Harel, attempts by the security forces to bring violent right-wing zealots to justice have suffered from two main problems: investigating Israelis as opposed to Palestinians is subject to more restrictions, and courts have proved to be lenient.&lt;ref&gt;Amos Harel, [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/analysis-why-did-the-attack-on-a-well-known-leftist-professor-happen-now-1.254656 'ANALYSIS / Why did the attack on a well-known leftist professor happen now?,'] in [[Haaretz]], 26 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Human rights nonprofit [[Yesh Din]] has produced a report, "A Semblance of Law", which found problems with law enforcement actions against Israelis in the West Bank. According to Yesh Din's study, which was conducted in 2005, among complaints against Israelis, more than 90% were closed without indictments mainly due to perpetrators not being found, 5% were lost and never investigated, and 96% of trespassing cases (including sabotage of trees) and 100% of vandalism and other property offense complaints led to no indictment.&lt;ref name="yeshdin1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yesh-din.org/userfiles/file/Reports-English/SemblanceofLawfullreportEng.pdf |title=Law Enforcement upon Israeli Civilians in the West Bank, Semblance of Law |publisher=[[Yesh Din]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as collecting statistics, Yesh Din examined 42 closed investigation files and found a number of shortcomings, including the use of Hebrew to record testimonies given in Arabic; frequent failure to check the scene where the alleged offense took place; often not taking down eye-witness testimonies; widespread lack of recourse to live identification line-ups with suspected Israeli civilians; hardly any confrontations between complainants and suspects; failure to check alibis; hasty closure of files shortly after the complaint was registered: closing of files even when evidence was sufficient to indict suspects: police refusing to register complaints, and pressure from the Civilian Administration being used to avoid filing complaints.&lt;ref name="yeshdin1"/&gt;

8% of complaints resulted in indictments. The Israeli Justice Ministry responded by stating that legal authorities were closely following specific cases, but said that it was not in its authority to deal with every case.&lt;ref name="haaretz_yesh_din"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1033864.html |title=''Yesh Din report: Only 8% of Palestinian complaints against settlers result in indictment'' |publisher=Haaretz |date=2008-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli security sources have said that it has become customary for some settlers to take the law into their own hands in the wake of Palestinian terror attacks in the West Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1076122.html |title=Israel fears Jewish extremists will avenge settlement murder |publisher=[[Haaretz]] |date=2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008-2009, the defense establishment began taking a harder line against unruly settlers.&lt;ref name="Pfeffer"/&gt;

In 2012, two EU heads of mission reports stated that Israel's security operations in the occupied territories had failed to protect the Palestinian population; it accused Israel of setting up its operations to minimize the impact on settlers of an ongoing campaign of settler violence. The reports noted that, "Over 90% of monitored complaints regarding settler violence filed by Palestinians with the Israeli police in recent years have been closed without indictment", and further added that, "discriminatory protections and privileges for settlers compound these abuses and create an environment in which settlers can act with apparent impunity".&lt;ref name="GnIT"/&gt;

===Administrative detention===
Following an attack by settlers on an IDF army base on December 13, 2011,&lt;ref name=Attack&gt;{{cite news|title=Settlers Riot, Attacking Israeli Base and Post|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/14/world/middleeast/radical-jewish-settlers-clash-with-israeli-troops.html|accessdate=December 15, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 13, 2011|author=Ethan Bronner}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Israeli government authorized administrative detention and military trial for settlers who engaged in violent actions, similar to the treatment accorded Palestinian activists who engage in similar behavior. The IDF was granted the power to arrest violent settlers and plans were announced to increase security on the West Bank and restrict access by known troublemakers. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu characterized the situation as a handful of extremists in a population of generally law-abiding settlers.&lt;ref name=Detention&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel Leader Sets Curbs on Settlers for Violence|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/15/world/middleeast/netanyahu-sets-new-curbs-on-violent-settlers-in-israel.html|accessdate=December 15, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 14, 2011|author=Ethan Bronner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five West Bank Israelis who are alleged to have planned and participated in the attack on the army base were indicted by the [[Israeli judicial system#District courts in Israel|District Court of Jerusalem]] on January 8, 2012.&lt;ref name=NYT5&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel Charges 5 Settlers in West Bank Army Base Clash|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/09/world/middleeast/israel-charges-5-settlers-in-clash-at-army-base.html|accessdate=January 8, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 8, 2011|author=Isabel Kershner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Settler riots==
Israeli withdrawals from [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] (in 2005) and an eviction in [[Hebron]] (in 2008) triggered settler rioting in protest. There is also continual conflict between settlers and Palestinians over land, resources and perceived grievances.
In August 2007, soldiers clashed with settlers during a raid in Hebron. Paint and eggs were thrown at the soldiers.&lt;ref name="Hider"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article2217951.ece |title=Mutinous soldiers are jailed as Israeli army evicts 200 religious settlers after court order |publisher=The Times |date=2007-08-08 |first=James |last=Hider | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A violent settler protest at the Palestinian village of [[Funduk]] occurred in November 2007, in which hundreds of extremist settlers converged at the entrance of the village and rampaged after 29-year-old local settler, Ido Zoldan, was shot dead in his car by Palestinian gunmen at the entrance to Funduk. The settlers smashed the windows of houses and cars. According to Funduk villagers, Israeli soldiers and police accompanied the protesters but mostly stood aside while the settlers rampaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/08/world/middleeast/08westbank.html?hp |title=Young Israelis Resist Challenges to Settlements |publisher=New York Times |date=2007-12-07 | first=Isabel | last=Kershner | accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, [[Hebron]] settlers angry at the eviction of settlers from a disputed house rioted, shooting three Palestinian rock-throwers and burning Palestinian homes and olive groves. Video footage of the attacks was recorded, leading to widespread condemnation in Israel. The attacks were characterized as "a [[pogrom]]" by then Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] who said he was ashamed "as a Jew".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7770384.stm |title=Olmert condemns settler 'pogrom' |publisher=BBC | date=2008-12-07 | accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1043795.html |title=Hebron settler riots were out and out pogroms |first=Avi |last=Issacharoff |date=2008-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local Palestinians claimed that once the disputed house was evicted, the IDF and the police were "indifferent" to the violence against the Palestinians, and have made no real attempt to stop the settlers from rioting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3633603,00.html |title=Hebron burning: Settler fire injures Palestinians |first=Ali |last=Waked |date=2008-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some settlers have publicly adopted what they refer to as a "price tag" policy whereby settlers attack Palestinian villages in retaliation after settler outposts are removed by the Israeli government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6721173.ece |title=Israeli settlers burn olive groves in ‘price tag’ retaliation attack |date=2009-05-21 |publisher=The Times | location=London | first=Sheera | last=Frenkel | accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, dozens of settlers from [[Bat Ayin]] rampaged through the West Bank village of [[Khirbet Safa|Safa]], smashing car windows, damaging homes and wounding 12 Palestinians. An Israeli army spokeswoman said the violence started when Palestinians threw stones at Bat Ayin settlers praying on a nearby hill before the Jewish Passover holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL837104020090408 |title=Jewish settlers rampage through West Bank village |date=2009-04-08 |publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations has warned that up to 250,000 Palestinians in 83 villages are "highly or moderately" vulnerable to settler retaliation if the [[Israeli outpost|unauthorized outposts]] in the West Bank are removed by the Israeli government. 75,900 Palestinians in 22 villages are "highly vulnerable". The report also warns that a number of roads around Palestinian villages may become dangerous for the Palestinians to travel on. The settlements [[Havat Gilad]], [[Kedumim]], [[Itamar]], [[Yitzhar]], [[Ma'aleh Levona]], [[Shilo, Mateh Binyamin|Shilo]], [[Adei Ad]], [[Nokdim]], [[Bat Ayin]], [[Negohot]], [[Kiryat Arba]], [[Beit Haggai]], [[Carmel, Har Hebron|Carmel]], and [[Susya]] are considered as possible threats to nearby Palestinians. The report criticizes "the inadequate level of law enforcement by the Israeli authorities" and "the ambiguous message delivered by the Government of Israel and the IDF top officials to the security forces in the field regarding their authority and responsibility to enforce the law on Israeli settlers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1143281.html |title=UN warns 250,000 Palestinians 'vulnerable' to settler violence |publisher=[[Haaretz]] |date=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement of youths==
Some settlers who attacked or harassed Palestinians are disaffected youths, referred to in the Israeli media as [[Hilltop Youth]].

Olive farming is a major industry and employer in the Palestinian West Bank and olive trees are a common target of settler violence. According to [[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|OCHA]] roughly 10,000 Palestinian West Bank olive trees and saplings have suffered either uprooting or damage from Israeli attacks in 2013, a rise from about 8,500 trees damaged in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amira Hass]], [http://www.haaretz.com/news/middle-east/1.560819 'Germany and Britain block Palestinian bid to join international olive trade group,'] at [[Haaretz]] 19 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; B'Tselem alleges that "olive pickers in areas near certain settlements and outposts in the West Bank have been a target of attacks by settlers, who have cut down and burned olive trees and stolen the crops", and that "security forces have not taken suitable action to prevent the violence". The IDF barred olive picking in extensive areas of land, stating that the closures were to protect the olive pickers. The case went to the [[Israeli High Court]] in 2006 which found that, as a rule, lands are not to be closed because of settler violence, and that the IDF must enforce the law. According to B'Tselem the IDF has worked around this by saying the lands are closed to protect the settlers.&lt;ref name="btselem5"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.btselem.org/english/Settler_Violence/20061029_Olive_Harvest.asp |title= 29 Oct. 06: B'Tselem Urges the Security Forces to Prepare for the Olive Harvest |publisher=[[B'Tselem]] |date=2006-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amnesty International has said that scores of Palestinian-owned sheep as well as gazelles and other animals were poisoned with [[fluoracetamide]] near Tuwani on 22 March 2005, depriving Palestinian farmers of their livelihood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde15/027/2005/en/ |title=Israeli authorities must put an immediate end to settler violence |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |date=25 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, a group of Israeli settlers riding horses and carrying torches raided Palestinian areas, burning 1,500-2,000 olive trees and stoning cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0720/breaking50.htm |title=Israelis torch 1,500 olive trees - report |publisher=[[Irish Times]] |date=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, two EU heads-of-mission reports detailed a tripling of violent settler attacks over three years. The report found that the attacks were especially aimed at Palestinian farmers and their livelihood in a systematic campaign of violence and intimidation which included the destruction of over 10,000 olive trees in the preceding year. The report noted that the Israeli state had "so far failed to effectively protect the Palestinian population".&lt;ref name="GnIT"/&gt;
2013. According to a confidential IDF document for just the period from Sept. 11 - October 20, 2013, the following Palestinian olive groves, near Israeli settlements near [[Elon Moreh]], [[Karnei Shomron]], [[Kedumim]], [[Ma'on, Har Hebron|Ma'on]], and the Ma'on Farm, [[Susya]], [[Shavei Shomron]], [[Zayit Ra'anan]], the [[Havat Gilad|Gilad Farm]], [[Shilo, Mateh Binyamin|Shilo]], and [[Yitzhar]], and all under IDF guard, were damaged, but were not reported in the media:

===Claims of staged vandalism===
A settler group named Tazpit Unit stated to have documented Palestinians destroying trees with the intention of blaming settlers for the destruction. Photos taken by the group allegedly show Palestinians and left-wing activists cutting down Palestinian olive trees using an electric saw. The settlers stated that many of the reported "price tag" operations by settlers were actually carried out by Palestinians with the aim of tarnishing the settlers' image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Yair Altman | url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3976976,00.html |title=Settlers: Arabs, leftists staged 'price tag' act Palestinians, leftwing activists documented while sawing trees in bid to accuse settlers |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |date=2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli settlers were accused by an Arab farmer of having gathered his sheep into an area thick with brush and setting fire to the bushes, burning alive his 12 pregnant ewes.&lt;ref name="Hz" &gt;{{cite web|title=Farmer: Settlers burned my sheep alive|url=http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=343201|publisher=Maan News Agency|accessdate=2010-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police questioned the farmer's description of religious settlers wearing [[Kippah|skullcaps]] driving a car on [[Shabbat|Sabbath]], as Orthodox Jews do not drive on this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Issacharoff|first=Avi|title=Police question Palestinian claim settlers burned his herd of sheep|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/police-question-palestinian-claim-settlers-burned-his-herd-of-sheep-1.331714|publisher=Haaretz|accessdate=2010-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caroline Glick writing in the [[Jerusalem Post]] reported that the farmer later admitted that he lost control of a brush fire that was responsible for the damage.

In March 2012, two Arab males of Beit Zarzir confessed, after being arrested, to damaging a local school for Arab and Jewish students.

The school was sprayed twice in February with the slogans "price tag", "Death to Arabs", and "Holocaust to the Arabs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=ראב"ד|first=אחיה|title=חשד: נערים ריססו על קיר בית ספר בצפון "מוות לערבים"|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4202214,00.html|publisher=Ynet News|accessdate=2012-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arab Youths Confessed to Spraying ‘Death to Arabs’|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/news/breaking-news/arab-youths-confessed-to-spraying-death-to-arabs/2012/03/13/|publisher=Jewish Press|accessdate=March 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Well contamination and water access===
{{Main|Well poisoning}}
On 13 July 2004, residents of Hirbat Atwana near Hebron found rotting chicken carcasses in their well after four Jewish settlers were seen in the village. Israeli police said they suspected militant Jews from a nearby settlement outpost called Havat Maon. Settlers blamed the action on "internal tribal fight between the Palestinians;" Israeli police spokesman Doron Ben-Amo said it was "unlikely" that the Palestinians would contaminate their own well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3891531.stm |title=Settlers suspected of well attack |publisher=BBC News, |date=2004-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040822135907/http://www.maarivintl.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=article&amp;articleID=9734 Settlers suspected of polluting wells], Maariv, 13 July 2004, retrieved from [[Digital time capsule|Wayback Machine]] on 18 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 December 2007, members of [[Christian Peacemaker Teams]], an American NGO, reported to have observed a group of Israelis stop next to a cistern in Humra Valley, open the lid, and raise the bucket.

A United Nations survey released in March 2012 documented the increasing use of threats, violence and intimidation to deny Palestinians access to their water resources in the West Bank. The survey stated that Israeli settlers have been acting systematically to gain control of some 56 springs most of which are located on private Palestinian land. The report noted that settler actions included "trespass, intimidation and physical assault, stealing of private property, and construction without a building permit". The report criticized the Israeli authorities for having "systematically failed to enforce the law on those responsible for these acts and to provide Palestinians with any effective remedy".&lt;ref name=UNreport&gt;{{cite web|title=Seizure of springs by settlers greatly limits Palestinian access to water - UN report|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=41579|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AFPwell&gt;{{cite news|title=Settlers taking over Palestinian springs: UN report|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gz7BqzSN6l9Ij93N85wTZwj3xtHg?docId=CNG.1b8f7ac940bf7703a478ec2514dd94e4.141|accessdate=5 June 2012|newspaper=AFP|date=Mar 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news|last=Spencer|first=Richard|title=Israeli settlers using 'acts of intimidation' to take over water supplies on Palestinian land|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/9153690/Israeli-settlers-using-acts-of-intimidation-to-take-over-water-supplies-on-Palestinian-land.html|accessdate=5 June 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=19 Mar 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacks on mosques===
In December 2009, suspected settler extremists attacked a mosque in the northern West Bank village of [[Yasuf]] near [[Nablus]] according to Palestinian officials and Israeli police. The people forced their way into the mosque and burned about 100 holy books including [[Korans]], [[Hadiths]], prayer carpets as well as spray painted anti-Palestinian slogans on the floor, some of which referred to the settlers' "price tag" policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6953281.ece |title=Settlers attack West Bank mosque and burn holy Muslim books |date=2009-12-11 |publisher=The Times | location=London | first=James | last=Hider | accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, Israeli security officers raided the settlement of [[Yitzhar]], forcibly entered the settlement's synagogue and [[yeshiva]] buildings and arrested ten settlers, including the [[Rosh yeshiva]], for alleged involvement in the mosque attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1143391.html |title=Police arrest 10 in raid on West Bank settlement |publisher=[[Haaretz]] |date=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; All were released by the court due to lack of evidence and the court reprimanded the police for arresting the rabbi.

===Attacks on churches and monasteries===
The growing ascendency of the right wing in politics over the past decades has led to increasing attacks on non-Jewish religious properties, associated with "price tag" attacks by settlers and their sympathizers, with a rise in attacks on churches throughout the West Bank and Jerusalem, extending even to Israel.[[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|The Patriarch of the Holy City of Jerusalem and all Palestine]], [[Patriarch Theophilos III of Jerusalem|Theophilos III]] has decried, "repeated" attacks on Christian and Muslim places of worship in the Palestinian territories by extremist Jewish settlers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/news/middle-east/17216-greek-orthodox-church-decries-attacks-by-jewish-settlers 'Greek Orthodox Church decries attacks by Jewish settlers,'] [[Middle East Monitor]] 26 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Settler extremism==
Many settlers want to be regarded as part of the Israeli mainstream. Only a small minority among them is violent.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2010/09/01/negotiating-with-the-israeli-settlers/likuds-advantage-with-the-settlers] Yossi Klein Halevi, The New York Times, September 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The number of settlers involved in violent activities is estimated to have grown from a few dozen individuals into a few hundred, out of a total population of about 500,000 Jewish settlers.&lt;ref name="bbc1"/&gt;

Extremist groups associated with the settler movement included the [[Gush Emunim Underground]], which existed from 1979 to 1984 as a militant organization linked to the settler activist group [[Gush Emunim]]. They carried out attacks against Jewish students and Palestinian officials, attempted to bomb a bus and planned an attack on the [[Dome of the Rock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Friedman|first=Robert L.|title=Zealots for Zion: Inside Israel's West Bank Settler Movement|year=1992|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=0394580532|pages=25-32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New York Times has noted that the religious, ideological wing of the settler movement is growing more radical. It is widely suspected that a pipe-bomb attack on settler critic [[Zeev Sternhell]] was perpetrated by settler radicals, who left fliers at the scene offering 1 million shekels to anyone who "kills a member of anti-settlement group [[Peace Now]]".&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/26/world/middleeast/26settlers.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;ref=middleeast&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Radical Settlers Take On Israel |publisher=New York Times |date=2008-09-25 |first=Isabel |last=Kershner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jta1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://jta.org/news/article/2008/10/08/110707/jextreme |title=Radical settlers using violence against Jews |date=2008-10-08 |first=Dina |last=Kraft}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public Security Minister [[Avi Dichter]] condemned the attack, calling it a "nationalistic terror attack".&lt;ref name="haaretz_attack"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1024412.html |title=Dichter: Prof attack takes us back to days of Rabin assassination |publisher=Haaretz |date=2008-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shin Bet security chief [[Yuval Diskin]] warned that he has "found a very high willingness among this public to use violence - not just stones, but live weapons - in order to prevent or halt a diplomatic process".

==International reactions==
In December 2011, following a briefing to the [[United Nations Security Council]], all of the regional and political groupings seated at the council issued statements expressing dismay at violence by settlers and right-wing activists, naming the issue as an obstacle to the resumption of peace talks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/12/20111221222731546.html | title=Israel condemned at UN over settlements | publisher=Al jazeera | date=22 Dec 2011 | accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-16279947 | title=UN groupings criticise Israeli settlement activities | publisher=BBC | date=2011-12-20 | accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of a number of statements on the issue, the EU expressed "deep concern regarding settler extremism and incitement by settlers in the West Bank". The statement further added that "the EU condemns continuous settler violence and deliberate provocations against Palestinian civilians. It calls on the government of Israel to bring the perpetrators to justice and to comply with its obligations under international law."&lt;ref name="HzEU"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/eu-israel-s-policies-in-the-west-bank-endanger-two-state-solution-1.430421 |title=EU: Israel's policies in the West Bank endanger two-state solution |publisher=[[Haaretz]] |date=May 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ynet1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3615844,00.html |title=EU condemns settler violence |publisher=[[Israel News]] |date=2008-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
Annual statistics suggest settler violence against Palestinians and their property in the West Bank is on the rise.
*2009. Number of assaults 168
*2010. Number of assaults 312
*2011. Number of assaults 411
*2012 (Jan-June) 154.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amira Hass]],['The anti-Semitism that goes unreported. Tens of thousands of people live in the shadow of terror.'] at [[Haaretz]], 18 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to B'Tselem, 49 Palestinians were killed by Israeli civilians between 2000 and 2010.&lt;ref name="btselem6"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.btselem.org/english/Statistics/Casualties.asp |title=Statistics |publisher=[[B'Tselem]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of these killings are settler-related, because a significant portion of the dead were killed while attempting to infiltrate settlements or attacking Israelis.&lt;ref name="btselem7"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.btselem.org/english/Statistics/Casualties_Data.asp?Category=3&amp;region=TER |title= Palestinians killed by Israeli civilians in the Occupied Territories, 29.9.2000 - 31.7.2010 |publisher=[[B'Tselem]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; B'Tselem also keeps a record of incidents of settler violence.&lt;ref name="btselem8"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.btselem.org/english/OTA/?WebbTopicNumber=01&amp;image.x=14&amp;image.y=7 |title= Settler Violence |publisher=[[B'Tselem]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A UN report cited 222 incidents of settler violence in the first half of 2008, compared to 291 in all of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Greenberg, 'Militant Jews living near outposts increasing attacks on Palestinians', in [[Chicago Tribune]], October 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] observed 207 incidents involving settler violence against Palestinians in the period between September 2008 and March 2009. The number of settler attacks peaked on the 4th of December when the evacuation of the [[Beit HaShalom]] in [[Hebron]] took place.&lt;ref name="UnitedNationsMay2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ochaopt.org/documents/ocha_opt_movement_and_access_2009_05_25_english.pdf |date=2009-05-25 |accessdate=2010-03-31 |publisher=[[United Nations]] |title=West Bank Movement and Access Update May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Italian Republic''' ({{lang-it|'''Repubblica Italiana'''}}) was a short-lived (1802–1805)  [[republic]] located in [[Northern Italy]]. [[Napoleon]] served as [[President]] and its capital was [[Milan]].

==The republic==
[[File:MonsiauConsultaRepubliqueCsalpine1808.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The ''[[Consulte de Lyon|Consulta of the République cisalpine]]'' receives the [[Napoleon|First Consul]], 26 January 1802, [[Nicolas-André Monsiau]], 1806–08]]
The Italian Republic was the successor of the [[Cisalpine Republic]], which changed its constitution to allow the French [[First Consul]] Napoleon to become its president. The new constitution changed the name of the state to the "Italian Republic"; it consisted of the same areas that had comprised the Cisalpine Republic, primarily [[Lombardy]] and [[Romagna]].

The republic had a territory of more than {{convert|42,500|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, and a population of 3,240,000 in 12 ''[[département]]s''. [[Milan]] was the capital city, the main center having 124,000 inhabitants in 1764. The country was prosperous despite the plundering experienced in preceding centuries. Its economy was based on [[cereal]] [[agriculture]] and [[cattle|cattling]], plus flourishing small industries, notably the production of [[silk]].

The flag of the Italian Republic maintained the three Italian-Milanese [[national colours]], but with a new, less revolutionary, pattern. The coat of arms was specified in a decree on May 13, 1802. A treaty of friendship and commerce with the [[Republic of San Marino]] was signed on June 10, 1802, the Concordat with the [[Holy See]] on September 16, 1803.

The government created the [[Carabinieri|National Guard]] of Italy, a National [[Gendarmerie]], and a [[Guardia di Finanza|finance police]]; the [[metric system]] was introduced and a national currency was planned, although never minted during the republican era.

In 1805, following Bonaparte's assumption of the title of Emperor of the French, the Italian Republic was transformed into the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] (''Regno d'Italia''), with Napoleon as king and his stepson [[Eugène de Beauharnais]] as [[viceroy]].

==Institutional form==
According to the Italian constitution of 1802, sovereignty resided in three electoral colleges of three to two hundred members: the College of Owners (''il Collegio dei possidenti''), the College of Scholars (''il Collegio dei dotti''), and the College of Traders (''il Collegio dei mercanti''), the first having its seat in [[Milan]], the second in [[Bologna]], and the third in [[Brescia]]. All the colleges elected a commission of control and supreme rule, called the Censorship (''la Censura''), composed of twenty-one members and based in [[Cremona]].

[[File:Melzi.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Vice-President of Italy, citizen [[Francesco Melzi d'Eril]]]]
The head of state was the president of the republic (''il Presidente della repubblica''), [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], elected for 10 years. The president had full executive powers, appointed the vice-president (''il Vicepresidente'') and the secretary of state, took legislative and diplomatic initiative, chose the ministers, public agents, ambassadors, and chiefs of the army, summoned the executive councils, and prepared the budget. The vice-president, [[Francesco Melzi d'Eril]], acted for the president during his absence. Melzi was described as a gentleman, and effectively ruled over the state's domestic affairs during the three years of the republic's life. Never submitting to Napoleon, Melzi was demoted after the monarchy's proclamation in favour of more controllable men; however, Melzi's character ensured him Napoleon's deep private respect during all the years of the French empire. Melzi also introduced obligatory conscription to Italy.

The Consulta (''la Consulta di Stato'') was a commission of eight members led by the president of the republic and in charge of foreign policy. The commissioners were appointed by the Censorship upon nomination by the three colleges: many former members of the [[Directory (political)|Directory]] of the [[Cisalpine Republic]] entered into office. The Consulta ratified treaties, approved any special decrees concerning state security, and in the event of the death or resignation of the president, appointed the successor. The minister of foreign affairs was chosen from among the commissioners.

The Legislative Council (''il Consiglio legislativo'') was a commission of at least ten members appointed by the president for three years. Its mission was to allow the president to submit legislation, helping him in the elaboration of laws and being present when they were discussed in parliament. The secretary of state (''il segretario di Stato'') was the chief of the public administration. He promulgated the laws, guarded the state's seal, and countersigned presidential acts. The first secretary was Diego Guicciardi, soon followed by Pellegrino Nobili and, finally, by Luigi Vaccari.

The government comprised seven ministers (''i ministri''). The [[Minister of War]] was at first Alessandro Trivulzi and then, from 1804, General Domenico Pino; [[Minister of Interior]] was at first [[Luigi Villa]] and then, from 1803, Daniele Felici; [[Minister of Foreign Affairs]] was [[Ferdinando Marescalchi]]; [[Minister of Justice]] and Great Judge was Bonaventura Spannocchi; [[Minister of Finance|Minister of Treasury]] was Antonio Veneri; [[Minister of Finance]] was [[Giuseppe Prina]]; [[Minister of Worship (France)|Minister of Religion]] was [[Giovanni Bovara]]. To draw up its budgets, the government was assisted by a Commissionership for National Accountancy.

The parliament of the republic was the Legislative Body (''il Corpo Legislativo'') with limited powers. It was composed of 75 members elected in each department by the three colleges. It was summoned by the president of the republic and could only approve or reject a law, the discussion being reserved to a more restricted Chamber of orators or Chamber of speakers (''Camera degli oratori'', a committee of fifteen speakers). First appointed at the Meetings of Lyon, one third of the parliament had to be renewed every two years.

The tribunals were divided into tribunals of first instance (''tribunali di prima istanza''), courts of appeal (''corti d'appello''), courts of revision (''corti di revisione''), and a court of cassation (''corte di cassazione''). The judges of the first two were appointed by the Consulta, the latter two by the three colleges.

==Local administration==
Following the French system, The state was divided into 12 ''[[départements]]'' (''[[départements|dipartimenti]]''). The chief of the department was the [[prefect]] (''[[prefetto]]''), an office created on May 6, 1802. The prefect was the state's representative in each province (dipartimento), and had two main functions: the first was to implement the administrative decisions of the central government and to control the local authorities, the second was leadership of the police. The local legislative body was the [[General councils (France)|General Council]] (''Consiglio generale''), composed of representatives of the communes. The government appointed the Central Departmental Administration (''Consiglio della prefettura''), composed of five or seven members chosen from nominations submitted by the General Council: the Administrations had powers over taxes and public works and, generally, represented local interests.

The departments were divided into districts (''distretti'') equivalent to the French ''[[arrondissements]]''. The chief of the district was the vice-prefect, which had powers similar to those of the prefect, but for a smaller area. However, the structure of the districts was not uniform over all the territory of the republic, and some districts were administered by a district council and a chancellor.

The districts were divided into ''[[Communes of Italy|communes]]''. Communes with more than 3,000 inhabitants had a [[city council]] (''[[municipal council|consiglio comunale]]'') of thirty or forty members, chosen by the General council from nominations submitted by the same city council. In the smaller communes, all the taxable citizens were councillors. The council elected a municipality{{cfn|date=July 2018}} of three to nine members, helped in its executive functions by a city secretary. All city offices were held only by owners and traders, and the leadership of the owners was assured. Each commune had a tax collector.

==Fashion and promotion==

Within three months of their launch, the jeans were featured on the cover of ''[[Women's Wear Daily]]'', have also been featured on [[MTV]], ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' and ''[[Good Morning America]]''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} She has designed hats for [[Pamela Anderson]],&lt;ref name=nypost2&gt;{{cite news|title=Tommy Lee's Latest Love|work=New York Post|date=July 23, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carmen Electra]], [[Snoop Dogg]],&lt;ref name=MJS&gt;{{cite news|title=Note Worthy|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=September 14, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]], among others.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;&lt;ref name=nypost&gt;{{cite news|first=George|last=Rush|title=Liam Finds Oasis in Ivy League|work=Daily News|location=New York|date=June 20, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivysupersonic.com/hats/ IVY Supersonic - HATS Collection &amp; Gallery&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reality television|Reality TV]] star [[Omarosa Manigault]] wore a hat designed by Ivy on the season finale of'' [[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|The Apprentice]]''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Supersonic has held parties for ''Mira! Magazine'' and adult actress [[Gina Lynn]].&lt;ref name=NYP&gt;{{cite news|title=Simmons In All-Night Prowl|work=The New York Post|date=July 14, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She had a cartoon character of herself tattooed on her by [[Kat Von D]] for the TV show ''[[Miami Ink]]''. She originated the Ivy Supersonic cartoon at Universal Music Group, but bought it back in 2002, when Universal had a high staff turn over.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prwebdirect.com/releases/2006/10/prweb445793.htm PR: Miami Ink TV Commercial with Ivy Supersonic&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061114040835/http://www.prwebdirect.com/releases/2006/10/prweb445793.htm |date=2006-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ivy had 17 tattoos done in 30 days to protest the Sqrat case.

==Feuds, provocations and incidents==
===Sqrat===
In one of her many "public feuds" Ivy claims that the idea for the character [[Scrat]] from the movie ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'' was stolen from her after she pitched her character ''Sqrat'', a cross between a [[squirrel]] and a [[rat]] that she claims to have seen in Madison Square Park to [[20th Century Fox]] movie executives. Ivy claims she created the character in 1999 and has the trademark to prove it. A [[CNN]] report by [[Jeanie Moos]] of Ivy claims was aired in 2000, two years before ''Ice Age'' went into development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivysupersonic.com/ivid/cnn2000.shtml Videos on IvySupersonic.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ivy claims she was offered a $300,000 settlement by Fox but turned it down, and subsequently lost the case at both the trial and appellate level.&lt;ref&gt;242 Fed. Appx. 720 (2d Cir. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  Ivy has continued her "Make Rupert Murdoch Pay" campaign in hopes of still receiving damages for her perceived infringement.

===Plumm Nightclub===
On October 27, 2007, Ivy started another public feud with New York nightclub, Plumm, over $1000. Ivy claims she is owed for a party she claims she hosted at the nightclub. Supersonic admitted to defacing the club after Plumm refused to pay her the money she claimed to be owed. Supersonic faced felony vandalism charges, but through a plea did minimal jail  time and community service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Foxley|title=Ivy Supersonic Update|publisher=New York Observer|url=http://www.observer.com/2007/ivy-supersonic-update|date=November 12, 2007|accessdate=2007-12-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217051607/http://www.observer.com/2007/ivy-supersonic-update|archivedate=December 17, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ivy Supersonic: 'I Don't Want to Go to Jail I'm 95 lbs'|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlny/pop_culture/ivy_supersonic_i_donat_want_to_go_to_jail_im_95_lbs_71085.asp|date=November 14, 2007|accessdate=2007-12-01}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Tyra Banks Show''===
Supersonic was thrown off ''[[The Tyra Banks Show]]'' on October 26, 2007, after producers did not like her tattoos showing through her dress. Ivy was given a shirt to cover the tattoos up but instead ripped the shirt and threw it on the floor and was subsequently asked to leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Johnson|title=Tattoos Get Tyra Bounced|publisher=New York Daily News|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/10282007/gossip/pagesix/tattoos_get_tyra_bounced.htm|date=October 28, 2007|accessdate=2007-12-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224162655/http://www.nypost.com/seven/10282007/gossip/pagesix/tattoos_get_tyra_bounced.htm|archivedate=December 24, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Supermodel thrown off Banks' show|publisher=Indo-Asian News Service|date=October 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tabloid Tidbits|publisher=msnbc.com|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21518413/|date=October 29, 2007|accessdate=2007-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bernie Madoff===
In 2009 she was summonsed after sneaking a recording device into the sentencing portion of the trial of infamous financier [[Bernie Madoff]].&lt;ref name="daily"&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/howard-stern-wack-packer-ivy-supersonic-bellevue-police-article-1.401560&lt;/ref&gt; In the act she was arrested by the [[Federal Protective Service (United States)|Federal Protective Service]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/how-howard-stern-tried-to-hack-the-madoff-sentencing-2009-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent years==
Ivy Supersonic does not appear to have been publicly visible during the 2010s.  Her website was still up as of 2017 but its news page had no entries past 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://ivysmedia.com/gallery2/main.php?g2_page=3&lt;/ref&gt;

However in 2017 as Ivy Silberstein she had a show of her artwork, particularly her watercolors, in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_58f4ef23e4b015669722514e&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Agastya ([[Akshay Kumar]]) is a scientist, working on the development of a communication system, to communicate with aliens. But Agastya loses the faith of his seniors and is allotted with a deadline of one month to conclude his project with some substantial results.

In the mean time Agastya is informed by his girlfriend Diva ([[Sonakshi Sinha]]) about his father's illness. On hearing this they both reaches his native village Paglapur, whose colourful inhabitants include a man who speaks in gibberish, another who thinks he is a lamp post and everyone else who think that the World War II is still going on.

Soon after reaching there, Agastya finds that he was called on a false pretext of illness by his father.

On getting apprised about truth, Agastya decides to move back to US, but after hearing the plight of the inhabitants of Paglapur, due to the brushing aside of the village by the government because of its being absent from the demarcated map of India, he makes his mind to come out with some solution for the problem.

As the story proceeds, Agastya comes up with a quaint idea pertaining to the crop circle and arrival of aliens in his village, in order to fetch a recognition for his otherwise isolated village undergoing a plight of neglect ever since the independence.

With frames moving ahead, Agastya along with other villagers creates crop circle in Paglapur and spreads rumour about arrival of aliens in the village. And from there, amid tremendous media hype, takes over some hilarious sequences knitted around UFO and fictitious man made aliens.

In the end, the whole joke about the fake aliens is found out and at the end of the movie real aliens come and give the village the gift of oil.

===Casting===
[[Shrish Kunder]] wanted to cast [[Asin Thottumkal]] as the female lead but, she was not able to adjust the dates for the film so, producers cast [[Sonakshi Sinha]] opposite [[Akshay Kumar]]. [[Shreyas Talpade]] and [[Minisha Lamba]] were later cast in pivotol roles.

==Reception==
''Joker'' received negative reviews from critics. Based on 16 reviews, review aggregate site ''desimartini.com'' gave the film the verdict, "Apart from an interesting concept and a handful of funny moments, ''Joker'' is drag and doesn't work as a comedy or as a sci-fi caper.

===Audio review===
''Music Aloud'' said: "He may or may not have composed the tunes for the controversy-ridden soundtrack of Jaanemann, but when GV Prakash Kumar actually got to do a credited debut in Bollywood, it turned out to be a rather uninventive one" and rated it 5/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.musicaloud.com/2012/07/31/joker-music-review/ |title=Joker – Music Review |date=31 July 2012 |work=Music Aloud |accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Score Magazine'', gave it 2 out of 5 stars stating, "You know something is wrong with an album when the instrumental tracks immensely outshine the vocal tracks. I must mention that each of the songs has a strong underlying melody but gross injustice is done to them by Shirish Kunder's lyrics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highonscore.com/music-review-joker |title=Music Review – Joker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An international incident occurred on 25 November 2018 when Russian [[Federal Security Service]] (FSB) [[Border Service of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation|border service]] [[Coast Guard (Russia)|coast guard boats]] fired upon and captured three [[Ukrainian Navy]] vessels that had attempted to pass from the [[Black Sea]] into the [[Sea of Azov]] through the [[Kerch Strait]] while on their way to the port of [[Mariupol]].&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;&lt;ref name="Osborn-Polityuk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-russia/russia-blocks-ukrainian-navy-from-entering-sea-of-azov-idUSKCN1NU0DL|title=Russia seizes Ukrainian ships near annexed Crimea after firing on them|first1=Andrew|last1=Osborn|first2=Pavel |last2=Polityuk|agency=Reuters|date=25 November 2018|accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Russia [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexed the nearby Crimean Peninsula]], which is internationally recognised as Ukrainian territory, and later constructed the [[Crimean Bridge]] across the strait. Under [[Agreement between the Russian Federation and the Ukraine on cooperation in the use of the sea of Azov and the strait of Kerch|a 2003 treaty]], the strait and the Azov sea are intended to be the shared territorial waters of both countries.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Agreement between the Russian Federation and the Ukraine on cooperation in the use of the sea of Azov and the strait of Kerch. |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/shared/faolextrans.jsp?xp_FAOLEX=LEX-FAOC045795&amp;xp_faoLexLang=E&amp;xp_lang=en |website=Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations Database |date=24 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the flotilla, which consisted of two gunboats and a tugboat, approached declared Russian territorial waters enroute the Crimean Strait, the Russian coast guard said they repeatedly asked the Ukrainian vessels to leave what they referred to as "Russian territorial waters", saying that the vessels failed to comply with the formal procedure for passage through the strait, that the Ukrainian ships had been manoeuvring "dangerously", and that they were not responding to radio communications.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;&lt;ref name=fsb_report /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Russian forces fulfilled 'military duty' in stopping Ukraine ships: Putin |url=https://www.nst.com.my/world/2018/11/435456/russian-forces-fulfilled-military-duty-stopping-ukraine-ships-putin |work=New Straits Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ukraine said that it had given advance notice to the Russians that the vessels would be moving through the strait, said that the ships had made radio contact with the Russians, but received no response, and cited the 2003 treaty in asserting freedom of passage through the strait.&lt;ref name="KIe1490c51b9"/&gt;&lt;ref name=rfel3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2018/11/28/the-sea-of-azov-wont-become-the-new-south-china-sea-and-russia-knows-it/ |title=The Sea of Azov won’t become the new South China Sea (and Russia knows it) |last=Bodner |first=David Larter, Matthew |date=28 November 2018 |work=Defense News |access-date=2 December 2018 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Ukrainian Navy refused to halt their journey, and continued toward the bridge, Russian Coast Guard vessels fired on them and, following a chase, seized the vessels off the coast of Crimea while they were attempting to return to Odessa.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;&lt;ref name=reuters25nov&gt;{{cite news |title=Russia fires on and seizes Ukrainian ships near annexed Crimea |url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-ukraine-crisis-russia/russia-fires-on-and-seizes-ukrainian-ships-near-annexed-crimea-idUKKCN1NU0DY |agency=Reuters|date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six Ukrainian crew members were injured in the clash, and twenty-four Ukrainian sailors from the captured ships were detained by Russia.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc34/&gt;

The Ukrainian government labelled the incident a potential precursor to a Russian invasion, and declared [[Martial law in Ukraine|martial law]] along the border with Russia and in Black Sea coastal areas.&lt;ref name="bbcmartiallaw"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/26/europe/ukraine-russia-kerch-strait-intl/index.html|title=Ukrainian lawmakers approve martial law as tensions with Russia escalate|first1=Nathan|last1=Hodge|first2=Josh |last2=Berlinger|publisher=CNN|date=26 November 2018|access-date=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident took place a few days before the [[2018 G20 Buenos Aires summit]] and was mentioned by Western leaders when they spoke of [[International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis|sanctions against Russia]].

The [[Kerch Strait]] connects the [[Sea of Azov]] with the [[Black Sea]], and is formed by the coasts of the Russian [[Taman Peninsula]] and disputed Crimea. It is the point of access for ships travelling to and from Ukraine's eastern port cities, most notably [[Mariupol]].

On 23 September 2018, two Ukrainian navy vessels successfully completed the journey from [[Odessa]] to [[Mariupol]] through the strait.&lt;ref name="2551703-dmytro-kovalenko"/&gt; According to Ukrainian Navy Captain 1st rank Dmytro Kovalenko, they had passed the Crimean Bridge without officially requesting permission.

When the Ukrainians refused, citing the [[Agreement between the Russian Federation and the Ukraine on cooperation in the use of the sea of Azov and the strait of Kerch|2003 Russo-Ukrainian treaty]] on freedom of navigation in the relevant area, the Russian boats attempted to intercept them, and rammed ''Yany Kapu''.

===Aftermath===

On the morning of 26 November, photographs of the captured Ukrainian ships laid up in the Crimean port of [[Kerch]] were published.

According to Ukrainian intelligence, the state of health of the Ukrainian Naval Forces servicemen who were injured in the attack in the Kerch Strait is satisfactory. The injured Ukrainian sailors were being treated at Pirogov Kerch City Hospital No. 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-ato/2587735-troh-poranenih-ukrainskih-morakiv-prooperuvali-u-kerci-rozvidka.html |title=Трьох поранених українських моряків прооперували у Керчі - розвідка |date=26 November 2018 |agency=[[Ukrinform]] |access-date=26 November 2018 |language=uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other photographs showed significant damage inflicted to the Berdyansk gunboat, including a hole in the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]], where crewmembers steer the boat.

On the evening of 28 November, Ukrainian Infrastructure Minister [[Volodymyr Omelyan]] said that vessels bound for the ports of Berdyansk and Mariupol awaited entrance to the Sea of Azov and vessels were also waiting to go southbound.  He characterised this as a virtual blockade. No vessels were identified as Ukrainian. &lt;ref name=Kerchclosed /&gt;

On 26 November 2018, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine held a briefing, where they announced that they viewed the actions of the Russian Federation during the incident as an act of armed aggression in violation of a number of international norms and treaties, including:&lt;ref name="%E2%80%93-general-major-radion"/&gt; the [[Agreement between the Russian Federation and the Ukraine on cooperation in the use of the sea of Azov and the strait of Kerch|Agreement between Ukraine and the Russian Federation on cooperation in the use of the Azov Sea and the Kerch Strait]], article 17 of the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]], part 1 of article 36 of the UN Convention, articles 32 and 95 of the United Nations Convention, article 30 of the UN Convention, and article 2 of the [[UN Charter]].&lt;ref name="%E2%80%93-general-major-radion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mil.gov.ua/news/2018/11/26/normi-mizhnarodnogo-prava-ta-naczionalnogo-zakonodavstva-dayut-pidstavi-klasifikuvati-dii-rf-yak-akt-zbrojnoi-agresii-%E2%80%93-general-major-radion-timoshenko/|title=Норми міжнародного права та національного законодавства дають підстави класифікувати дії РФ як акт збройної агресії, – генерал-майор Радіон Тимошенко|website=Міністерство оборони України|access-date=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 November, a day after the incident, lawmakers in the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian Parliament]] overwhelmingly backed the imposition of [[Martial law in Ukraine|martial law]] in the country's coastal regions, and those bordering Russia and unrecognised [[Transnistria|Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic]].

On 28 November 2018, Ukrainian President Poroshenko said that the incident was provoked by Russia in order to force Ukraine to declare martial law and therefore to prevent Ukraine from receiving its ''tomos'' of [[autocephaly]] for the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church]] (see: [[2018 Moscow–Constantinople schism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.unian.info/politics/10356345-poroshenko-explains-timing-of-russia-s-attack-on-ukrainian-ships-near-kerch-strait.html|title=Poroshenko explains timing of Russia's attack on Ukrainian ships near Kerch Strait|date=28 November 2018|agency=Ukrainian Independent Information Agency|access-date=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://espreso.tv/news/2018/11/28/poroshenko_skazav_chomu_putin_napav_v_kerchenskiy_protoci_same_zaraz|title=Порошенко сказав, чому Путін напав в Керченській протоці саме зараз|date=28 November 2018|website=espreso.tv|dead-url=|access-date=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Poroshenko during an interview told the German tabloid ''[[Bild]]'' that Germany should support Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ukraine's leader asks Nato to send ships |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46381166 |work=BBC News|date=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poroshenko also told ''Bild'' that Putin saw Ukraine as a Russian colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ukrainian leader says Putin wants his whole country, asks for NATO help |url=https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/ukraine-calling-on-nato-to-deploy-ships-to-site-of-ongoing-standoff-with-russia-1.6699524 |website=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 November, Ukraine banned all Russian men between 16 and 60 from entering the country, claiming this is a security measure. It was reported that Russian women were denied entry as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Roth |first1=Andrew |title=Ukraine bans entry to Russian men ‘to prevent armies forming’ |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/30/ukraine-bans-russian-men-from-entering-the-country |accessdate=30 November 2018 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
Russia's FSB blamed Ukraine for sparking the clashes, saying their "irrefutable" evidence "will soon be made public".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.euronews.com/2018/11/25/ukraine-slams-russian-aggression-after-boat-is-rammed-in-sea-standoff|title=Ukrainian president summons war cabinet after Russia 'fires on ships'|date=25 November 2018|publisher=Euronews|accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 November, the FSB published its detailed chronology of the events of 25 November on its website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsb.ru/fsb/press/message/single.htm ]{{dead link|date=December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chronology indicated that the Ukrainian vessels failed to follow the advance notification procedures for passage through the Kerch Strait and that Russia did not contest the 2003 Treaty right to freedom of navigation through the strait. Foreign Minister [[Sergey Lavrov]] said on the next day that Ukraine had violated international legal norms by failing to obtain authorisation for its vessels.&lt;ref name="apnews.com"/&gt; [[List of Deputy Chairmen of the State Duma|Deputy Chairman]] of the [[State Duma]] [[Pyotr Olegovich Tolstoy|Pyotr Tolstoy]] warned of the danger of a war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thejournal.ie/russia-ukraine-sea-of-azov-4359513-Nov2018/|title='Unleashing conflict': Ukraine says Russia opened fire on navy ships|agency=Agence France-Presse|via=thejournal.ie|date=26 November 2018|accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the declaration of martial law in Ukraine, Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] expressed "serious concern".&lt;ref name="bbcmartiallaw"/&gt; He later called the event "a provocation" and accused Ukraine's President of staging the incident in order to improve his popularity ahead of the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2019|2019 presidential election]].&lt;ref name=bbc28nov/&gt;

According to the state-run [[RIA Novosti]], Russia's military planned to send additional [[S-400 missile system|S-400 ''Triumf'']] missile batteries to Crimea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chappell |first1=Bill |title=Russia Plans To Deploy More S-400 Missiles To Disputed Crimea Peninsula |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/11/28/671466911/russia-plans-to-deploy-more-s-400-missiles-to-disputed-crimea-peninsula |publisher=NPR |accessdate=29 November 2018  |date=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3929">The '''London Conference of 1832''' was an international conference convened to establish a stable government in [[First Hellenic Republic|Greece]]. Negotiations between the three Great Powers ([[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], [[July Monarchy|France]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]]) resulted in the establishment of the [[Kingdom of Greece]] under a [[Otto of Greece|Bavarian Prince]]. The decisions were ratified in the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1832)|Treaty of Constantinople]] later that year. The treaty followed the [[Akkerman Convention]] which had previously recognized another territorial change in the [[Balkans]], the [[suzerainty]] of [[Principality of Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Background==

[[Greece]] had won its independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the [[Greek War of Independence]] (1821–1829) with the help of Britain, France and Russia. In the London Protocol of 3 February 1830, the three powers had assigned the borders of the new state. However, when the governor of Greece, [[John Capodistria]] (Ioannis Kapodistrias) (Καποδíστριας) was assassinated in 1831 in [[Nafplion]], the Greek peninsula plunged into confusion. The Great Powers sought a formal end of the war and a recognized government in Greece.

[[Image:Palmerston.jpg|frame|thumbnail|right|15px|As Foreign Secretary, Viscount Palmerston was deeply interested in Greece]]

==Conference of London==
In May 1832, British [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Palmerston]] convened with French and Russian diplomats, and, without consultation of the Greeks, decided that Greece should be a monarchy. The convention offered the throne to the [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]]n Prince, [[Otto of Greece|Otto]]. They also established the line of succession which would pass the crown to Otto's descendants, or his younger brothers should he have no issue. It was also decided that in no case would the crowns of Greece and Bavaria be joined. As co-guarantors of the monarchy, the Great Powers also empowered their ambassadors in [[Constantinople]], the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] capital, to secure the end of the [[Greek War of Independence]].

On 21 July 1832 British ambassador Sir [[Stratford Canning, 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe|Stratford Canning]] and the other representatives concluded the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1832)|Treaty of Constantinople]], which set the boundaries of the new [[Kingdom of Greece]] at a line running from [[Arta, Greece|Arta]] (Αρτα) to [[Volos]] (Βολος).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5800">[[File:FDC-MeskelFestivities.jpg|thumb|[[Postmark]]s commemorating Ethiopian First Day Cover, Meskel festivities, December 17, 1974]]
'''Meskel''' ({{lang-gez|መስቀል}}, ''mäsqäl'') is an annual [[religious holiday]] in the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]] and [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahdo Church|Eritrean Orthodox]] churches, which commemorates the discovery of the [[True Cross]] by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] Empress Helena ([[Helena of Constantinople|Saint Helena]]) in the fourth century. Meskel occurs on the 17 Meskerem in the [[Ethiopian calendar]] (September 27, [[Gregorian calendar]], or on 28 September in [[leap year]]s).&lt;ref name="rough"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rough Guides|first=|authorlink=Rough Guides|title=The Rough Guide to Ethiopia|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-XqKBgAAQBAJ|series=Rough Guide to...|year=2015|isbn=9780241181850|chapter=Festivals}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Meskel" (or "Meskal" or "Mesqel", there are various ways to [[Transliteration|transliterate]] from Ge'ez to Latin script) is [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] for "cross".

The festival is known as [[Feast of the Cross|Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross]] in other Orthodox, [[Catholic]] or [[Protestant]] churches. The churches that follow the Gregorian calendar celebrate the feast yearly on September 14.

The feast is held in Meskel Square, named after the festival, in the capital city of Addis Ababa. Religious and civil leaders preside over the celebration,and public figures give speeches and reference biblical themes and stories. Many Ethiopians who live in cities return to their villages to celebrate the national event. When it gets darker, the Demera is burned.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M Landy, [https://www.catholicsandcultures.org/ethiopia/meskel "Meskel"], ''Catholics &amp; Cultures'' updated June 19, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
==Overview==  
[[File:Meskel Celebration.jpg|thumb|Meskel celebration at [[Meskel Square]], [[Addis Ababa]] (2016)]]
The Meskel celebration includes the burning of a large bonfire, or ''Demera'', based on the belief that Queen Eleni, as she is known, had a revelation in a dream. She was told that she should make a bonfire and that the smoke would show her where the true cross was buried. So she ordered the people of Jerusalem to bring wood and make a huge pile. After adding frankincense to it the bonfire was lit and the smoke rose high up to the sky and returned to the ground, exactly to the spot where the Cross had been buried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Walta Information Center | work=Meskel Being Celebrated Across The Nation | url=http://www.telecom.net.et/~walta/ennews/html/sep/ed270900/html/newsitem_2.html | accessdate=September 14, 2005 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319160802/http://www.telecom.net.et/~walta/ennews/html/sep/ed270900/html/newsitem_2.html | archivedate=March 19, 2006 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to local traditions, this ''Demera''-procession takes place in the early evening the day before Meskel or on the day itself.  The firewood is decorated with [[Asteraceae|daisies]] prior to the celebration. Charcoal from the remains of the fire is afterwards collected and used by the faithful to mark their foreheads with the shape of a cross (compare [[Ash Wednesday]]). [[Edward Ullendorff]] records a number of beliefs of the meaning of ''Demera'', with some believing that it "marks the ultimate act in the cancellation of sins, while others hold that the direction of the smoke and the final collapse of the heap indicate the course of future events – just as the cloud of smoke the Lord raised over the [[Tabernacle]] offered guidance to the children of Israel (''[[Book of Exodus|Exod.]]'' 40:34–38)."&lt;ref name="ullen-114"&gt;Ullendorff, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Demera engulfed in flame Meskel 2013.JPG|thumb|''Demera'' engulfed in flames, 2013.]]
One explanation for the high rank this festival has in the church calendar is that it is believed that a part of the true Cross has been brought to Ethiopia from Egypt. It is said to be kept at [[Amba Geshen]], which itself has a cross-shaped plan.

According to the Ethiopian  Orthodox Church, the discovery of the True Cross is traditionally believed to have been in March, but Meskel was moved to September to avoid holding a festival during [[Lent]], and because the church commemorating the True Cross in [[Jerusalem]] was dedicated during September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Amanuel Sahle | title=The Byzantine Origin of Meskel | work=Shaebia.org | url=http://www.shaebia.org/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi?archive=3&amp;num=167 | accessdate=September 14, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ullendorff speculates that Meskel replaced an older festival, with pagan and Hebraic associations, which he believes received its Christian sanction around the reign of Emperor [[Amda Seyon I of Ethiopia|Amda Seyon]] in the fourteenth century. "The most ancient meaning of these feasts – as was also the case in Israel – was no doubt seasonal: the month of Maskaram marked the end of the rains, the resumption of work, and the reopening of communications."&lt;ref name="ullen-114"/&gt;

Developed by Mission Street Development LLC, an affiliate of Millennium Partners,&lt;ref name="SFGATE3"/&gt; the {{US$|350 million}} project was designed by [[Handel Architects]], engineered by [[DeSimone Consulting Engineers]] and constructed by [[Webcor Builders]].

==History==
[[File:Millennium Tower, San Francisco, in August 2016.jpg|thumb|The Millennium Tower in August 2016]]
Millennium Partners first proposed the development in 2002 with 163 condominiums, 108 rentals and a 136-unit "extended stay" hotel rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/58-story-skyscraper-seeking-S-F-approval-2834584.php |title = 58-story skyscraper seeking S.F. approval / Proposal for city's fourth-highest tower |first = Gerald D. |last = Adams |date = May 18, 2002 |access-date = December 28, 2013 |newspaper = San Francisco Chronicle }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was approved in 2003 by the S.F. Planning Commission 4–1 and construction began in 2005. The only against vote came from Planning Commissioner Sue Lee.&lt;ref name="SFGATE"/&gt; The development was the first high rise built downtown in 20 years. According to ''Modern Luxury'', a proposed 52-story skyscraper at nearby 80 Natoma by developer Jack Myers which would also have a similar poured concrete construction, was rejected by the city's Department of Building Inspections (DBI) after an outside peer review. The Millennium Tower received no such scrutiny, since Millennium Partners would not submit to a peer review, as that study would have potentially delayed construction by years.&lt;ref name="modernluxury.com"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/the-big-sink |title = The Big Sink |work = Modern Luxury |access-date = November 5, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Treadwell &amp; Rollo, the geotechnical engineer for Millennium Tower, were also the geotechnical engineer for the scrapped project at 80 Natoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Troubles-Plaguing-Leaning-Sinking-Millennium-Tower-Could-Have-Been-Avoided-New-Documents-Show-391468911.html|title=Millennium Tower's Sinking Foretold by Earlier Project|work=NBC Bay Area|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On September 6, 2010, [[Dan Goodwin]], also known as ''SpiderDan'' and ''Skyscraperman'', scaled the outside of the tower using suction cups. Following the climb, Goodwin was arrested by the San Francisco police, who charged him with trespassing and creating a public nuisance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Bob |last = Egelko |first2 = Kevin |last2 = Fagan |title = Man scales S.F. tower to publicize his message |url = http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Man-scales-S-F-tower-to-publicize-his-message-3175821.php |work = San Francisco Chronicle |date = September 7, 2010 |access-date = September 29, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the building sold its final unit, generating US$750 million in total sales, a 25 percent return on the estimated US$600 million in development costs.&lt;ref name="BIZRETURN"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/print-edition/2013/04/05/millennium-tower-in-san-francisco-is.html |title = Millennium Tower in San Francisco is a $750M sellout |newspaper = San Francisco Business Times |first = J.

==Sinking and tilting problem==
[[File:Millennium tower and construction in SF 10.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Transbay Transit Center|TTC]] construction next to the tower]]
After developers apparently disclosed in 2015 that the building was sinking and tilting, &lt;ref name="reuters1"/&gt; the public was notified of the problem in 2016.&lt;ref name="NYT2" /&gt; Treadwell &amp; Rollo's geotechnical design for the foundation of the main tower consists of a concrete slab built on {{convert|60|–|90|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} [[Deep foundation#Driven foundations|concrete friction piles]] through the fill and [[young bay mud]], and embedded into dense [[Colma Formation|Colma]] sand. A number of other buildings in 301 Mission Street’s area have used similar systems, although due to varying earth conditions, others have pushed piles directly into the [[bedrock]] {{convert|200|ft|m}} below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Associated |first1 = Press |title = Leaning San Francisco tower seen sinking from space |url = http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/11/28/leaning-san-francisco-tower-seen-sinking-from-space.html |publisher = [[Fox News]] |access-date = November 29, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://wolfstreet.com/2016/10/04/condo-owners-leaning-tower-of-san-francisco-knock-value-to-zero-millennium-tower/ |title = Owners at “Leaning Tower of San Francisco” Knock Condo Values to Zero |date = October 4, 2016 |website = Wolf Street }}&lt;/ref&gt; An examination in 2016 showed the building had sunk {{convert|16|in|cm}} with a {{convert|2|in|cm|adj=on|spell=in}} tilt at the base and an approximate {{convert|6|in|cm|adj=on|spell=in}} tilt at the top of the tower.&lt;ref name="BigSink"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1 = Smiley |first1 = Lauren |last2 = Eskenazi |first2 = Joe |title = The Big Sink |magazine = San Francisco Magazine |date = October 21, 2016 |url = http://modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/the-big-sink |access-date = October 24, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The building is leaning toward the northwest,&lt;ref name="BigSink"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Gecker |first = Jocelyn |url = http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/tilting-sinking-san-francisco-high-rise-raises-alarm-43006857 |title = Tilting, Sinking San Francisco High-Rise Raises Alarm |publisher = [[ABC News]] |agency = [[Associated Press]] |date = October 24, 2016 |access-date = October 24, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first = Phillip |last = Matier |first2 = Andrew |last2 = Ross |date = August 1, 2016 |newspaper = San Francisco Chronicle |url = http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/SF-s-landmark-tower-for-rich-and-famous-is-8896563.php?t=1ef0887a20 |title = SF's landmark tower for rich and famous is sinking and tilting |access-date = August 2, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has caused cracks in the building's basement and the pavement surrounding the tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/06/large-crack-in-san-francisco-millennium-tower-window-is-latest-in-engineering-woes|title=San Francisco's sinking, leaning tower adds cracked window to list of woes|last=Wong|first=Julia Carrie|date=2018-09-06|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, the sinking has increased to 18 inches with a lean of 14 inches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Why-sinking-SF-tower-is-now-a-top-tourist-13231133.php|title=Why San Francisco's sinking Millennium Tower is now a top tourist destination|last=King|first=John|date=2018-09-15|website=San Francisco Chronicle|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The developer blames the sinking problem on the [[Transbay Joint Powers Authority]] (TJPA), who were responsible for construction of the neighboring [[Transbay Transit Center]] (TTC).&lt;ref name="BigSink"/&gt; However, the sinking problem had reportedly started before TTC construction even broke ground,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and TJPA asserted the building had already settled {{convert|10|in|cm}}, well past the original maximum vertical settling prediction of {{convert|5.5|in|cm}} in 20 years, by the time TJPA began removing the timber piles under the prior [[Transbay Terminal]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="TBJA"&gt;{{cite press release |url = http://www.transbaycenter.org/uploads/2016/09/TJPA-Press-Statement-Millennium-Towers-Sept-20-2016.pdf |title = Evidence does not support Millennium Partners' claim that the TJPA's dewatering is the cause of the excessive vertical settlement and tilting of the Millennium Tower |last = Boule |first = Scott |date = September 20, 2016 |publisher = Transbay Joint Powers Authority |access-date = June 15, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The building's homeowners association, represented by general counsel Adrian Adams of Adams Stirling PLC, retained Dan Petrocelli of O’Melveny &amp; Myers, to sue Webcor, Millennium Partners, and the TJPA.&lt;ref&gt;Dorsey, Matt. [https://www.omm.com/our-firm/media-center/press-releases/millennium-tower-homeowners-tap-petrocelli-as-lead-counsel/?sc_lang=en “Millennium Tower Homeowners Tap Petrocelli as Lead Counsel, Rounding Out All-Star Legal Team Prior to Lawsuit”], ‘’O’Melveny &amp; Meyers Press Release’’, San Francisco, February 7, 2017. Retrieved August 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the homeowners association had hired David Casselman to sue the TJPA instead of developer Millennium Partners, as Casselman noted that "inverse condemnation law allows residents to collect legal fees on top of any award, whereas suing the developer will steer up to 40 percent of any award to lawyers".&lt;ref name="BigSink"/&gt;&lt;ref name="modernluxury.com"/&gt; 

Another group of tenants who disagree with the homeowners association, led by resident and patent litigator Jerry Dodson, is suing Millennium Partners, the City of San Francisco, and the TJPA.&lt;ref name="WhoWillPay"&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Tarmy |first1 = James |last2 = Mehrotra |first2 = Kartikay |title = Who Will Pay for San Francisco's $750 Million Tilting Tower? |url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-01/who-will-pay-for-san-francisco-s-tilting-sinking-millennium-tower |access-date = February 2, 2017 |work = Bloomberg Pursuits |publisher = Bloomberg |date = February 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BigSink"/&gt; In breaking with Casselman and the homeowners association, Dodson has regarded Millennium Partners as the responsible culprit.&lt;ref name="modernluxury.com"/&gt;

Sage Engineers has been hired by Millennium Partners to provide an engineering study on the sinking problem. Some experts have prognosticated that the cost to fix the tilt could exceed the liability insurance held by Millennium Partners and the building's various construction vendors. If the TJPA is found to be at fault, San Francisco taxpayers could end up paying for the repairs.&lt;ref name="WhoWillPay"/&gt;

{{As of|2017}}, a city inspection has found that the building is still safe to occupy, though there has been damage to the foundation and electrical system.&lt;ref name="SFCsafe"&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Dineen |first1 = J.

In March 2017, the homeowners association filed suit against Millennium Partners, Webcor, Handel Architects, Treadwell &amp; Rollo, Langan, DeSimone Consulting Engineers, Arup, and Transbay Joint Powers Authority. They are seeking $200 million to cover repairs and damages.&lt;ref name="BUZZ"&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://news.buzzbuzzhome.com/2017/04/millennium-tower-sf-homeowners-lawsuit.html |title = Millennium Tower San Francisco homeowners strike back with $200 million lawsuit |date = April 5, 2017 |work = BuzzBuzzHome News |access-date = April 18, 2017 |language = en-US }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early September 2018, residents reported hearing various "creaking sounds". At around 2:30 a.m. on the morning of Saturday, September 8, 2018, residents reported hearing a loud "popping sound". On Sunday, the following day, a resident located in a corner unit on the 36th floor discovered a cracked window. The glass used in the building's windows and facade is rated to withstand hurricane force winds, leading to concern that the crack was a symptom of a much larger structural failure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Millennium-Tower-s-managers-say-cracked-window-13213528.php?t=3ed01f73e2 Millennium Tower window crack could signal bigger problem, report says]. ''San Francisco Chronicle'', September 7, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; On October 2, 2018 after an investigation by an architectural engineering firm hired by the homeowners association, it was announced that the cracked window was caused by an "exterior impact" and not related to the building sinking and movement.&lt;ref&gt;https://media.nbcbayarea.com/documents/MTcoverletter+100218.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|the country that existed from 1949 until 1990|East Germany}}
{{New federal states labelled map}}
{{History of Germany|expanded=Contemporary}}
The '''new federal states of Germany''' ({{lang-de|die neuen Bundesländer}}) are the five re-established [[States of Germany|states]] in the former [[East Germany]] that acceded to the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] with its [[Old states of Germany|10 states]] upon [[German reunification]] on 3 October 1990.

The new states, which [[East German Administrative Reform of 1952|were dissolved]] by the [[Government of East Germany|East German government]] in 1952 and were re-established in 1990, are [[Brandenburg]], [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], [[Saxony]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]] and [[Thuringia]]. The state of [[Berlin]], the result of a merger between [[East Berlin|East]] and [[West Berlin]], is usually not considered one of the new states, although many of its residents are former East Germans.

Since the reunification, Germany thus consists of 16 states with equal legal statuses. Yet the process of the "[[inner reunification]]" between the former East and West Germany is still ongoing.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Culture==
{{See also|Ostalgie}}
[[File:Ampelmaenner.jpg|thumb|The [[Ampelmännchen]], symbol of the East German culture]]
Persisting differences in culture and mentality among the old [[East Germany]] and old [[West Germany]] are often referred to as the "wall in the head" ("Mauer im Kopf").&lt;ref name="dw1004"&gt;{{Cite web|author= |title=Breaking Down the Wall in the Head |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,1564,1344803,00.html |work= |publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=2004-10-03 |accessdate=2009-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Ossis" ("Easties") are stereotyped as racist, poor and largely influenced by [[Russia]]n culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Cameron Abadi |title=The Berlin fall |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/06/18/the_berlin_fall?page=0,2 |work= |publisher=Foreign Policy |date=2009-08-07 |accessdate=2009-10-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809203430/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/06/18/the_berlin_fall?page=0,2 |archive-date=2009-08-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Wessi]]s" ("Westies") are usually considered snobbish, dishonest, wealthy, and selfish. The terms can be considered disparaging.

In 2009, twenty years after the fall of the wall, a poll found that 22% of former East Germans (40% of under-25s) considered themselves "real citizens of the Federal Republic".&lt;ref name="bz"/&gt; 62% feel in a kind of limbo, no longer citizens of East Germany but not fully integrated into the unified Germany. Around 11% would have liked to have East Germany back.&lt;ref name="bz"&gt;{{Cite web|author= |title=Noch nicht angekommen - Survey of 2900 adults in the New Länder in summer 2008 |url=http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/archiv/.bin/dump.fcgi/2009/0121/politik/0022/index.html |work= |publisher=Berliner Zeitung |date=21 January 2009 |accessdate=2009-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 poll found that 25% of West Germans and 12% of East Germans wished reunification had not happened.&lt;ref name="dw1004"/&gt;

Some East German brands have been revived, appealing to former East Germans who are nostalgic for the goods they grew up with.&lt;ref name="dw1003"/&gt; Brands revived in this manner include [[:de:Rotkäppchen Sektkellerei|Rotkäppchen]], which holds about 40% of the German sparkling wine market, and [[:de:Zeha Schuhfabrik Hohenleuben|Zeha]], the sport shoe maker that supplied most of East Germany's sports teams and also the [[Soviet Union national football team]].&lt;ref name="dw1003"&gt;{{Cite web|author= |title=East German brands thrive 20 years after end of Communism |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4752593,00.html |work= |publisher=Deutsche Welle |date=2009-10-03 |accessdate=2009-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pornography]] and [[prostitution]] were outlawed in the GDR as forms of exploitation, and West Germans commonly believe that those who grew up in the GDR are more sexually inhibited than their western counterparts. Nonetheless, better access to higher education and jobs along with free abortion, contraception and generous family policies made East German women generally more promiscuous with respect to their sex life.&lt;ref name="tel"&gt;{{cite news |author= |title='Women's love lives were better in East Germany before the Berlin Wall fell' |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/6373531/Womens-love-lives-were-better-in-East-Germany-before-the-Berlin-Wall-fell.html |work= |publisher=Telegraph |date=2009-10-19 |accessdate=2009-10-11 | location=London | first=Etienne | last=Balmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable difference is the attitude towards [[naturism]] or FKK (short for ''[[Freikörperkultur]]'') in German. While it existed in both East and West, only in the East was it a mass cultural phenomenon in which almost everybody participated. This can still be seen at beaches of former East Germany compared to their West German counterparts.

More children are born out of wedlock in eastern Germany than in western Germany. In 2009, in eastern Germany 61% of births were to unmarried women, while in western Germany 27% were. The states of Saxony-Anhalt and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania had the highest rate of birth outside wedlock, each with 64%, followed by Brandenburg with 62%. The state of Baden-Württemberg had the lowest rate with 22%, followed by Hesse and Bavaria, each with 26%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.de/society/20110812-36923.html#.UTLa0Dcce0Q|title=One third of children born out of wedlock|date=12 August 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pro Reli====
On 26 April 2009, a referendum ([[:de:Volksentscheid über die Einführung des Wahlpflichtbereichs Ethik/Religion|de]]) was held on whether Berlin pupils should be allowed to choose between the ethics class, a compulsory class introduced in all Berlin schools in 2006, and a religion class.&lt;ref name="Verbij"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.trouw.nl/home/berlijn-blijft-een-heidense-stad~a6c1bb85/ |title=Berlijn blijft een heidense stad |author=Antoine Verbij |work=[[Trouw]] |date=27 April 2009 |accessdate=24 January 2018 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SPD, the Left Party and Greens supported the "Pro Ethics" camp for a "No" vote, stressing that the ethics class should remain compulsory, and pupils could voluntarily take an extra religion class alongside it if they so chose; the CDU and FDP supported the "Pro Reli" camp for a "Yes" vote, wanting to give pupils a free choice.&lt;ref name="Verbij"/&gt; In East Berlin, an overwhelming majority&lt;ref name="Verbij"/&gt; of 74.62%{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} voted against the introduction of religious education.

The [[economic reconstruction]] of eastern Germany ({{lang-de|Aufbau Ost}}) is proving to be longer-term than originally foreseen.&lt;ref name="tatsachen"/&gt; The [[standard of living]] and average annual income remain significantly lower in the new federal states.&lt;ref name="FR"&gt;{{Cite web|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |title=The Price of a Failed Reunification |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,373639,00.html |work= |publisher=Spiegel International |date=2005-09-05 |accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infrastructure==
The "German Unity Transport Projects" ([[:de:Verkehrsprojekte Deutsche Einheit|Verkehrsprojekte Deutsche Einheit]], VDE) is a programme launched in 1991 and meant to upgrade the infrastructure of eastern Germany, and modernise transport links between the old and new federal states.&lt;ref name="fgc"&gt;{{Cite web|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |title=Infrastructure for unified Germany |url=http://www.bmvbs.de/en/Federal-Government-Commissione/-,2577/Infrastructure-for-unified-Ger.htm |work= |publisher=Federal Government Commissioner for the New Federal States |date= |accessdate=2009-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090915215944/http://www.bmvbs.de/en/Federal-Government-Commissione/-,2577/Infrastructure-for-unified-Ger.htm |archivedate=September 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme consists of nine railway and seven motorway projects, as well as one [[waterway]] project, with a total funding of €38.5 billion. As of 2009, all 17 projects are either under construction or have already been completed.&lt;ref name="unece"&gt;{{Cite web|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |title=Draft Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan |url=http://www.unece.org/trans/doc/transsitdocs/Germany%20-%20Transport%20infrastructure%20plan.pdf |work= |publisher=United Nations Economic Commission for Europe |date= |accessdate=2009-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of new railway lines and high-speed upgrades of existing lines reduced journey times between Berlin and [[Hanover]] from over four hours to 96 minutes.&lt;ref name="fgc"/&gt; Due to increasing car usage and depopulation since reunification, many railway lines (branches and main lines) have been closed by the unified [[Deutsche Bahn]] (German Railways). Some main lines are still not finished or upgraded according to the VDE, with the Leipzig-Nuremberg line (via Erfurt and part of the Munich-Berlin route) scheduled to come on-line in December 2017, almost three decades after reunification. Some lines, even those connecting large cities, are still in a worse state then they were in the 1930s, with travel time from Berlin to Dresden slower in 2015 than in 1935.

"DEGES" (''Deutsche Einheit Fernstraßenplanungs- und -bau GmbH'', German Unity Road Construction Company) is the state-owned project management institution responsible for the construction of approximately 1,360&amp;nbsp;km of federal roads within the VDE, with a total investment of €10.2 billion. It is also involved in other transport projects, including 435&amp;nbsp;km of roads costing about €1,760 million as well as a city tunnel in [[Leipzig]], at the cost of €685 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=|first1=|last2=|first2=|title=Firmenprofil|url=http://www.deges.de/deges.html|work=|publisher=DEGES|date=|accessdate=2009-10-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525090448/http://deges.de/deges.html|archivedate=2009-05-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan 2003 includes plans for the extension of the [[Bundesautobahn 14|A14 motorway]] from [[Magdeburg]] to [[Schwerin]] and construction of the [[Bundesautobahn 72|A72]] from [[Chemnitz]] to [[Leipzig]].&lt;ref name="unece"/&gt;

Private ownership rates of cars have markedly increased since 1990: in 1988, 55% of East German households had at least one car, in 1993 this had already risen to 67%, and to 71% in 1998. This compares to the West German rates of 61% in 1988, 74% in 1993 and 76% in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wz-berlin.de/publikation/pdf/mit91/wzbmit91-31-35.pdf Wilhelm Hinrichs: ''Die Ostdeutschen in Bewegung – Formen und Ausmaß regionaler Mobilität in den neuen Bundesländern''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040829002111/http://www.wz-berlin.de/publikation/pdf/mit91/wzbmit91-31-35.pdf |date=2004-08-29 }} (PDF-Dokument)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpb.de/publikationen/05049451825358354051911907431409,2,0,Die_DDR_in_den_siebziger_Jahren.html bpb: Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung: ''Die DDR in den siebziger Jahren'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The socialist party [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] (''Die Linke'', successor to the ''Party of Democratic Socialism'', the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|GDR state party]]'s successor) has been successful throughout eastern Germany, perhaps as a result of the continued disparity of living conditions and salaries compared with western Germany, and high unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://die-linke.de/wahlen/positionen/themen_az/io/ostdeutschland/| title=DIE LINKE: Ostdeutschland}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its association with the [[Labour and Social Justice – The Electoral Alternative|WASG]], The Left mostly loses in state elections, and has been losing members since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/austritte-und-nachwuchsprobleme-linke-verliert-massiv-mitglieder/5864836.html| title=Linke verliert massiv Mitglieder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Already in the German Empire and the Weimar Republic the strongholds of the [[German Conservative Party]] (DKP), [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP) and [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) they were Pomerania, Lower Silesia, East Prussia and Brandenburg. (Prussia)

The Far-right party [[German People's Union]] (DVU) was since [[Saxony-Anhalt state election, 1998|1998]] in Saxony-Anhalt and in Brandenburg sice [[Brandenburg state election, 1999|1999]]. A study of the University of Berlin from 1998/99 comes to 13% for the whole of Germany, and 12% for the West and 17% for the East for right-wing extremist recruitment potential.&lt;ref&gt;Nach Iris Huth: ''Politische Verdrossenheit'', Band&amp;nbsp;3, 2004, S.&amp;nbsp;226.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2001, the Düsseldorf Federal Party Congress of the FDP decided the strategy, the "Strategy 18" which is premised by [[Jürgen Möllemann]] as a goal. Jürgen Möllemann stood behind Jamal Karsli who is criticized as anti-Semitic,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zentralratdjuden.de/de/article/194.html ''Möllemanns und Westerwelles unerträgliche Angriffe gegen Friedman''], Zentralrat der Juden in Deutschland, 22 May 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Möllemann was criticized by the then FDP leader [[Guido Westerwelle]] that he wanted to make the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] a right-wing populist party&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article273430/FDP-wirft-Moellemann-Rechtspopulismus-vor.html| title=FDP wirft Möllemann Rechtspopulismus vor}}&lt;/ref&gt; and got the backing of [[Jörg Haider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/antisemitismus-streit-moellemann-bekommt-beifall-von-haider-160367.html| title=Möllemann bekommt Beifall von Haider}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name referred to the election goal of tripling the share of electoral votes from 6 to 18%. In the midst of controversy over a possibly associated right-wing populist orientation, the FDP ultimately achieved 7.4% and moved away from the course after the election, but gained in all new states in [[German federal election, 2002|2002]] between 3.6% in Saxony and 2.4% in East Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author= |title=Veränderung der Zweitstimmenanteile der FDP in den Ländern bei der Bundestagswahl 2002 im Vergleich zu 1998|url=https://www.fdp-bw.de/docs/btw02_ver_zw_bund.JPG|work= |publisher=FDP/DVP Baden-Württemberg|accessdate=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author= |title=Bundestagswahlen – Berlin-Ost|url=https://www.wahlen-in-deutschland.de/buBerlinOst.htm|work= |publisher=wahlen-in-deutschland.de|accessdate=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[Junge Landsmannschaft Ostdeutschland]], which is supported by the NPD, organized a march on the anniversary of the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II]].

The election slogans of the DVU in the regional elections in Saxony-Anhalt in 1998 were directed primarily against the already represented in parliament politicians: "Not the people - the political bigwigs will dole!" And "German let's not make the sow you. DVU - The protest in the election against dirty things from above ". In particular, politically dissatisfied people were advertised with the slogan "vote protest - vote German".&lt;ref name="Kailitz 44"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=[[Steffen Kailitz]]|Title=Politischer Extremismus in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland.

==Demographic development==
{{See also|Demographics of Germany}}
[[Image:Pop density of Germany.png|thumb|The population density of the new German states is lower than that of the old states.]]
The former East German states have experienced significant depopulation and extremely low birth rates since 1990, with a recovery in recent years. About 1.7 million people have left the new federal states since the fall of the Berlin Wall, or 12% of the population.&lt;ref name="nyt0609"/&gt; A disproportionately high number of them were women under 35.&lt;ref name="sp07"&gt;{{Cite web|author= |title=Lack of Women in Eastern Germany Feeds Neo-Nazis |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,485942,00.html |work= |publisher=Spiegel International |date=2007-05-31 |accessdate=2009-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact about 500,000 women aged under 30 have left for western Germany in the past 15 years.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

After 1990, the fertility rate in the East dropped to 0.77. In 2006, the rates in the new states (1.30) was approaching those in the West (1.34), and is now higher (1.64 vs 1.60 in West, year 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.destatis.de/EN/FactsFigures/SocietyState/Population/Births/Tables/BirthRate.html|title=State &amp; society - Births - Average number of children per woman - Federal Statistical Office (Destatis)|first=|last=publisher|website=www.destatis.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destatis.de/jetspeed/portal/cms/Sites/destatis/Internet/DE/Navigation/Statistiken/Bevoelkerung/GeburtenSterbefaelle/GeburtenSterbefaelle.psml|title=Startseite - Statistisches Bundesamt (Destatis)|work=destatis.de|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1989, about 2,000 schools have closed because of a paucity of children.&lt;ref name="nyt0609"/&gt;

In some regions the number of women between the ages of 20 and 30 has dropped by more than 30 percent.&lt;ref name="nyt0609"/&gt; In 2004, in the age group 18-29 (statistically important for starting families) there were only 90 women for every 100 men in the new federal states (including Berlin).&lt;ref name="berins"&gt;{{Cite web|author= |title=The Demographic State of the Nation |url=http://www.berlin-institut.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Studien/Kurzfassung_demografische_lage_englisch.pdf |work= |publisher=[[Berlin Institute for Population and Development]] |year=2006 |accessdate=2009-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In parts of the state of [[Thuringia]], there are 82 women for every 100 men.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Slow death of a small German town as women pack up and head west |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/27/germany.jasonburke |work= |publisher=The Guardian |date=2008-01-27 |accessdate=2009-10-11 | location=London | first=Jason | last=Burke}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town of [[Königstein, Saxony|Königstein]] has the biggest demographic imbalance in Europe between young men and women.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; This is in contrast to many areas in Europe as many cities across the continent suffer an imbalance of younger women to men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://one-europe.info/eurographics/where-do-young-european-women-go|title=Where do young European women go?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to the concern to local leaders, as a large imbalance of males to females is usually linked to historical social instabilities and increased [[crime rate]]s.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

In 1995, it became the only new state to experience population growth, aided by the vicinity of Berlin.&lt;ref name="bpb"&gt;{{Cite web|author= |title=Abwanderung aus den neuen Bundesländern von 1989 bis 2000 |url=http://www.bpb.de/publikationen/78LEGD,3,0,Abwanderung_aus_den_neuen_Bundesl%25E4ndern_von_1989_bis_2000.html |work= |publisher=Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung |year=2001 |accessdate=2009-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] had a population of 1,970,000 in 1989, and 1,598,000 in March 2013,&lt;ref name="saemt"/&gt; with the lowest population density in Germany. The [[Landtag of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|local Landtag]] held several inquiries over population trends, the opposition has requested an annual report on the topic.&lt;ref name="bpb"/&gt;

[[Saxony]] had a population of 5,003,000 in 1989, which fell to 4,044,000 in March 2013.&lt;ref name="saemt"/&gt; It still remains the most populous among the five new states. The proportion of the population under 20 fell from 24.6% in 1988 to 19.7% in 1999.&lt;ref name="bpb"/&gt; [[Dresden]] and [[Leipzig]] are among the fastest growing cities in Germany both rising their population over half a million inhabitants again and in strong contrast to the other districts of Saxony.

[[Saxony-Anhalt]] had a population of 2,960,000 in 1989, and 2,253,000 in March 2013.&lt;ref name="saemt"/&gt; The state has a long history of demographic decline: its current territory had a population of 4,100,000 in 1945. The emigration already began during the GDR years.&lt;ref name="bpb"/&gt;

[[Thuringia]] had a population of 2,680,000 in 1989, and 2,166,000 in March 2013.&lt;ref name="saemt"/&gt; In Thuringia, the migration has less of an impact than the decrease of the fertility rate. Former Minister-President [[Bernhard Vogel (politician)|Bernhard Vogel]] called for a stop to the exodus of skilled workers and young people.&lt;ref name="bpb"/&gt;

'''Opération Nez rouge''' (literally, "Operation Red Nose"), founded in 1984, is an escorting service offered in [[Quebec]] and several [[francophone]] countries, as well as other places in [[Canada]] using both the French name and '''Operation Red Nose''' during the [[Christmas]] holiday season.

==Description==
The escorting service is offered to anyone who does not feel capable of driving due to [[alcohol consumption]], [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], or any reason. Although it is a free service, [[donations]] are accepted. 

Each year during the holiday season, an advertising campaign reminds the public to use the service if necessary.

When needing a ride, the client first calls the [[organization]]. The client must have his/her own car—it is not a taxi service. An escort team of three volunteers arrives. One volunteer, the 'escort driver', uses his or her own car to drive the other two volunteers to the client's location. The 'designated driver' volunteer then drives the client home in the client's own car. The third volunteer is the 'navigator', and drives with the designated driver and client, collecting any donation that the client should want to make, giving the client a receipt, and making conversation with the client so the client does not bother the driver. When the ride is over, the escort driver picks up the designated driver and the navigator.

Originally donations went to the swimming team of [[Université Laval]], but the organization became so successful that today donations go to 150 organizations. The costs of Operation Nez Rouge are covered by [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsors]] (such as insurance companies.)

==History==
Operation Nez Rouge was started in 1984 in Quebec City by [[Jean-Marie De Koninck]], who had two goals. He wanted to finance Université Laval's swimming team and he wanted to do something to fight driving under the influence. He knew that drivers leaving bars refused [[taxis]] to bring them home when intoxicated, not because of the cost, but because they wanted to have their own cars the next day. Thus came the idea to simply offer an escorting service.

The service was used 1,205,894 times between 1984 and 2004.

'''''Osawatomie Brown''''' is a play, by Kate Edwards, about [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]'s struggle with pro-[[slavery]] forces in [[Kansas]] which brought him national attention and made him a hero to many Northern abolitionists. With only two dozen men he successfully defended the free-soil town of [[Osawatomie, Kansas]] (on August 30) against an attack of about 400 men, earning him the nickname "Osawatomie Brown." Brown's play premiered just two weeks after Brown's execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.kancoll.org/khq/1937/37_1_edwards.htm |title=An Old Play on John Brown, by Kate Edwards. |first1=Ihn |last1=Stafford |first2=Susan |last2=Stafford |work=Kansas Historical Quarterly| volume=6 |issue=1 |page=34&amp;ndash;59|date=February 1937 |accessdate=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Paris Conference on Passports &amp; Customs Formalities and Through Tickets''' was a conference organised by the [[League of Nations]] in 1920&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.indiana.edu/~league/1920.htm |title= League of Nations Photo Archive - Timeline - 1920| date=  | publisher= Indiana University | location=  | accessdate=  July 13, 2013 |archiveurl=  | archivedate= |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; which agreed, for the first time, on a set of standards for all [[passport]]s issued by members of the League. Prior to that time, there were no internationally agreed standards for passports because they were not generally required for travel until [[World War I]].

== Approaches ==
Through actions of [[tactical media]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://zararah.net/blog/2015/03/15/digital-rights-play-parody/ Zara Rahman: Claiming back digital rights through play and subversion]&lt;/ref&gt; the Peng Collective wants to inspire other activists and civil society organisations to be more courageous in their campaigning methods. "Let's learn from our enemies," one of their members says in an interview. "If you look at the economics of corporations, their state of mind is: 'let's look at every possible gray area of laws and use them.' And NGOs just don't do that."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobilisationlab.org/google-nest-parody-pushes-limits-of-ngo-tactics/ Mobilisation Lab: Google Nest parody pushes limits of NGO tactics]&lt;/ref&gt; They are known for wearing animal masks as sign of biological appropriation whenever they are on stage and to break the law "whenever necessary for the greater good. And yes, the arts can be a greater good."

They got international media attention, when they held a presentation called "Your data, our future" in the Name of [[Google]] at Europe's largest tech conference [[re:publica]] in 2014. All presented products were designed to gather more data from the consumers, claiming that this is in their best interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fastcocreate.com/3030418/how-activists-fooled-the-internet-with-these-convincing-new-google-nest-products Fast Company: How Activists Fooled The Internet With These Convincing New Google Nest Products]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2014/05/07/google-nest-spoof-by-german-activists-promises-eerie-data-driven-future/ Forbes Magazine: Google Nest Spoof By German Activists Promises Eerie, Data-Driven Future]&lt;/ref&gt; After Google threatened them to take down their parody website,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/google-nest-parody-taken-down-2014-5?IR=T Business Insider: Google Got A Parody Site That Made Fun Of Its Privacy Policies To Take Everything Down]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) supported them legally:

{{quote|Unfortunately, Google's skin was not thick enough to withstand this relatively gently ribbing. The company wrote a polite note to the collective, expressing their sincere respect for political commentary—but nonetheless demanding that Peng! revise the site and assign the domain name to Google. Note to Google: polite trademark bullying is still bullying.

EFF responded to Google on Peng's behalf, explaining what should be obvious: the site was pure noncommercial political commentary. Trademark owners should not and cannot punish activists simply because they happen to use trademarks in the course of that kind of commentary.|''Corynne Mcsherry in an EFF letter to Google: Parody Is Not Trademark Infringement''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/05/dear-google-parody-not-trademark-infringement]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Slamshell ===
Invited as fake persona to a conference of the oil company [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], they created an oil spill on stage instead of the expected presentation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/14/shell-berlin-science-slam-video_n_4440676.html Shell's Berlin 'Science Slam' Event Reportedly Disrupted By Anti-Drilling Activists (Huffington Post)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/151440-oil-spill-nigeria-activists-prank-shell-hijack-science-slam-berlin-slamshell.html Premium Times Nigeria: Activists prank Shell, hijack “Science Slam” in Berlin]&lt;/ref&gt; The evening was a public relations event organized by [[Burson Marsteller]] in Berlin, where one member of the Collective could enter the stage because he claimed to have created a car that is cleaning the air.

=== Cooperation with the Yes Men and Pussy Riot ===
In 2015, the group infiltrated the [[Cinema for Peace]] Gala in Berlin with a fake polar bear and [[The Yes Men]] to go on stage and insist that divestment from fossil fuels is helping more against climate change than charity projects. [[Pussy Riot]], who was invited as speaker to the [[Charity (practice)|charity]] gala came to support them, when the organizers of the event tried to silence them with security guards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://taz.de/Cinema-for-Peace-Eklat-naechste-Runde-/!156929/ German article about the event in the newspaper taz]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://apologytonatalieportman.com/ Letter of apology to Natalie Portman for hijacking her stage and the video of the evening]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zero Trollerance ===
In May 2015, they developed a bot script that scans [[Twitter]] for abusive and sexist language. Once detected, plenty of automated Twitter profiles would reply to those tweets with an invitation to a self-help program for trolls to become [[feminist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/social-media/11535405/How-do-you-stop-Twitter-trolls-Unleash-a-robot-swarm-to-troll-them-ba Daily Telegraph Article "How do you stop Twitter trolls? Unleash a robot swarm to troll them back"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intelexit ===
In September 2015, the Peng Collective staged an association named [[Intelexit]] helping anyone working for [[Intelligence agency|secret services]] to quit their jobs and transition to civil life, be it for ethical or psychological reasons. A spokesman of the British secret service [[GCHQ]] responded to the launch of the association, that GCHQ doesn't actually do anything illegal or immoral, and that staff can report any concerns they do have to managers or to GCHQ's own counselors. Furthermore, they responded to the Intelexits critique of their lack of ethical standards that the GCHQ "has several formal lines of accountability and a culture and ethos of high ethical standards among our workforce." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2015/09/campaign-help-surveillance-agents-quit-nsa-gchq/ Wired US article "This New Campaign Wants To Help Surveillance Agents Quit NSA or GCHQ"]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the launch of the campaign, they rallied with an advertising trucks and mobile billboards in front of several secret services workplaces around the world like the German BND, the GCHQ Headquarters in the UK, the US military bases in Germany [[Dagger Complex]] and [[Lucius D. Clay Kaserne]] and the [[NSA]]'s Headquarters in the USA, Maryland, where they also drove to the employees lunch place [http://cafejoe.homestead.com/ Café Joe]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/09/30/these-german-artists-tried-to-convince-nsa-employees-to-quit/?postshare=8101443594963254 Washington Post article "These German artists tried to persuade NSA employees to quit"]&lt;/ref&gt; They also performed an [[Airborne leaflet propaganda|airborne leaflet operation]] over the [[Dagger Complex]] with a drone advertising for the exit program.&lt;ref&gt;[https://theintercept.com/2015/10/05/drone-flies-over-nsa-complex-in-germany-dropping-pamphlets/ The Intercept article "Drone Flies Over NSA Complex in Germany, Dropping Leaflets"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intelexit now operates phone booth installations in arts and journalists venues where participants can call up secret service employees such as the [[FBI]], [[NSA]], [[CIA]] and private subcontractors like [[Trovicor]] or [[Booz Allen Hamilton]] in the USA, but also officers from Germany, France, Canada and Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2016/03/15/peng-le-collectif-qui-veut-aider-les-espions-a-raccrocher_4883226_4408996.html Le Monde article about the Call a Spy launch]&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation invites people to set up the call installation all over the world to create an ongoing dialogue between civil society and the intelligence community.

=== Artikel 26 ===
In Schwenke (Halver), Peng! had founded a fictitious CDU local association, which appealed to party leader Angela Merkel to campaign against the export of small arms in the next legislative period. This appeal was also reported in international media. Later the communication guerrilla action was confirmed by Peng!

In the same week, Peng! started an alleged recall of small arms from the manufacturer Heckler &amp; Koch by sending letters to US arms dealers on its behalf. The web pages of Heckler &amp; Koch in the USA and Germany were then provided for several days with the news that they had been the victims of a hacker attack and fake news.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mic.com/articles/176439/anonymous-art-collective-trolls-hundreds-of-heckler-and-kochs-us-gun-vendors-with-bogus-recall-prank#.ocoh91DVr Mic article about the weapon prank]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same week, the group released a video documenting how they awarded a peace prize for the arms industry and how Thyssen Krupp Marine Systems only left shortly before the alleged award ceremony.

As part of this series of actions, Peng! published five legislative proposals for the renewal of the War Weapons Control Act and for the "Rescue of Article 26 GG".

=== Deutschland Geht Klauen ===
With this Campaign PENG called people to snatch goods in supermarkets and to pay unions of the producers in the global south instead. They created an online-system with which it is possible to do so through their website, seemingly an online-shop. You can thus pay eight unions fighting for the rights of the workers while PENG is fighting for the introduction of a law in Germany with which you can take German companies accountable for the violation of human rights abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[https://deutschlandgehtklauen.de/en Deutschlandgehtklauen website]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mask.ID ===
PENG created a photo-booth in which you could create portraits that contain your own face and from someone else by morphing them together. The technology was based on neural networks by OpenAI and megapixels by Adam Harvey.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/PengBerlin/status/1043529657168089088 Tweet from Peng revealing the sources]&lt;/ref&gt; They themselves created a German passport that contained both one member from their team and [[Federica Mogherini]]. They also sent five passports to co-artists in Libya with whom they morphed the faces to let them enter Europa as both real and symbolic gesture of civil disobedience against the border regime.&lt;ref&gt;[https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pa9vyb/peng-collective-artists-hack-german-passport article by Motherboard, "German Art Activists Get Passport Using Digitally Altered Photo of Two Women Merged Together" Oct 9 2018, 6:09pm]&lt;/ref&gt;. The photo booth was further shown in Vienna and Munich on art exhibitions.

=== Civil Financial Regulation Office ===
On the [[Athens Biennale]] 2018 named "ANTI", Peng contributed by installing a call center with six Greek employees payed by German tax money on minimum wage who are calling the [[Financial_regulation | financial regulation institutions]] for six weeks. They ask tem questions that are being posted on their website and try to get them to explain the logic of financial argumentation in understandable language. &lt;ref&gt;[https://cfro.eu Project Website]&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''''Peter Pan''''' is a 1976 American [[television film|made-for-television]] [[musical (film)|musical]] [[film adaptation]] of [[J. M. Barrie|J.M. Barrie]]'s ''[[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up]]'' starring [[Mia Farrow]] as [[Peter Pan]] and [[Danny Kaye]] as [[Captain Hook]], and with Sir [[John Gielgud]] narrating.  [[Julie Andrews]] sang one of the songs, "Once Upon a Bedtime", off-camera over the opening credits.&lt;ref name="eugene" /&gt; It aired as a presentation of ''[[Hallmark Hall of Fame]]'' on [[NBC]] at 7:30pm on Sunday, December 12, 1976, capping off the program's 25th year on the air.&lt;ref name="eugene"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19761211&amp;id=x7URAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JOgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5074,3569459 Google newspaper cache of [[Associated Press]] story, printed in ''Eugene Register-Guard'', Dec 11, 1976]&lt;/ref&gt;

The program did not use the score written for the highly successful [[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|Mary Martin version]] which had previously been televised many times on NBC. Instead, it featured 14 new and now forgotten songs, written for the production by [[Anthony Newley]] and [[Leslie Bricusse]].  The story was adapted by [[Andrew Birkin]] (who would subsequently become a leading Barrie scholar) and [[Jack Burns]].  Although it was an American production with two American stars, most of the cast was British.

This version of ''Peter Pan'' won an [[Emmy]] for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Children's Programming for [[Jenn de Joux]]'s and [[Elizabeth Savel]]'s visual effects, and was nominated for Outstanding Children's Special, however it was not rebroadcast. But it was featured in 2011 at the [[Paley Center]] in New York City as part of the [[New York Musical Theatre Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/article/paley-center-will-screen-the-twice-told-tales-of-cinderella-and-peter-pan-as-part-of-nymf-com-182843 Paley Center Screens the Twice-Told Tales of "Cinderella" and "Peter Pan" Beginning Oct. 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phone cloning''' is the copying of identity from one [[cellular device]] to another.

== AMPS cloning ==
{{seemain|Advanced Mobile Phone System#Cloning}}
Analogue mobile telephones were notorious for their lack of security. Casual listeners easily heard conversations as plain [[frequency modulation|narrowband FM]]; eavesdroppers with specialized equipment readily intercepted handset [[Electronic Serial Number]]s (ESN) and Mobile Directory Numbers (MDN or CTN, the Cellular Telephone Number) over the air. The intercepted ESN/MDN pairs would be cloned onto another handset and used in other regions for making calls. Due to widespread fraud, some carriers required a [[Personal identification number|PIN]] before making calls or used a system of [[radio fingerprinting]] to detect the clones.

== CDMA cloning ==
[[Image:Several mobile phones.png|thumb|right|A selection of mobile phones that can be cloned.]]
[[Code division multiple access|Code Division Multiple Access]] (CDMA) mobile telephone cloning involves gaining access to the device's embedded [[file system]] /nvm/num directory via specialized software or placing a modified [[EEPROM]] into the target mobile telephone, allowing the [[Electronic serial  number]] (ESN) and/or [[Mobile equipment identifier|Mobile Equipment Identifier]] (MEID) of the mobile phone to be changed. To obtain the MEID of your phone, simply open your phone's dialler and type *#06# to get its MEID number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Bader | first = Daniel | title = How to make sure your phone works on a prepaid alternative carrier | url = https://www.imore.com/how-make-sure-your-phone-works-prepaid-alternative-carrier | work = iMore | date = March 21, 2017 | accessdate = October 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ESN or MEID is typically transmitted to the cellular company's [[Mobile Telephone Switching Office]] (MTSO) in order to authenticate a device onto the mobile network. Modifying these, as well as the phone's [[Preferred Roaming List]] (PRL) and the [[mobile identification number]], or MIN, can pave the way for fraudulent calls, as the target telephone is now a clone of the telephone from which the original ESN and MIN data were obtained.

== GSM cloning ==&lt;!--[[SIM cloning]] redirects here--&gt;
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}
Cloning has been shown to be successful on CDMA, but rare on [[GSM]]. However, cloning of a GSM phone is achieved by cloning the SIM card contained within, but not necessarily any of the phone's internal data.  GSM phones do not have ESN or MIN, only an [[International Mobile Station Equipment Identity]] (IMEI) number.  There are various methods used to obtain the IMEI. The most common methods are to hack into the cellular company, or to eavesdrop on the cellular network.

A GSM SIM card is copied by removing the SIM card and placing a device between the handset and the SIM card and allowing it to operate for a few minutes and extracting the [[Subscriber_Identity_Module#Authentication_key_(Ki)|K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;]], or secret code.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-clone-a-SIM-card&lt;/ref&gt;  This is normally done with handsets that have the option of an "extended battery" by placing the normal size battery in the handset and the K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in the now vacant extra space.  This is done by allowing the device to log the interaction between the mobile telephone switching office and the handset.

== Effectiveness and legislation ==
Phone cloning is outlawed in the [[United States]] by the Wireless Telephone Protection Act of 1998, which prohibits "knowingly using, producing, trafficking in, having control or custody of, or possessing hardware or software knowing that it has been configured to insert or modify telecommunication identifying information associated with or contained in a telecommunications instrument so that such instrument may be used to obtain telecommunications service without authorization."&lt;ref&gt;http://beta.congress.gov/bill/105th/senate-bill/493&lt;/ref&gt;

The effectiveness of phone cloning is limited. Every mobile phone contains a [[Radio fingerprinting|radio fingerprint]] in its transmission signal which remains unique to that mobile despite changes to the phone's ESN, IMEI, or MIN. Thus, cellular companies are often able to catch cloned phones when there are discrepancies between the fingerprint and the ESN, IMEI, or MIN.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9772">The '''Prebilovci massacre''' was an atrocity perpetrated by the [[Croat]]ian [[Ustaše]] in the [[Independent State of Croatia]] during the [[World War II persecution of Serbs]]. On 6 August 1941, the Ustaša killed around 600 women and children from the village of Prebilovci, [[Herzegovina]], by throwing them alive into the Golubinka pit, near [[Šurmanci]]. 

During the summer of 1941, the Ustaša continued with mass murders of Serbs – of 1,000 inhabitants of Prebilovci, 820 of them were killed, while in the neighbouring places of the lower basin of the Neretva river, including Šurmanci, around 4000 Serbs were killed. The Golubinka pit was covered with concrete in 1961.

==Persecution==
During the [[Second World War]] the Serb inhabitants of Prebilovci, a small village near [[Čapljina]], fell victim to genocide. At the beginning of 1941, the village had a population of 1,000. Earlier, it had given volunteers to join the Bosnian-Herzegovinian uprising against the Turks in 1875-78, and contributed 20 volunteers to the Serbian Army in [[Salonica]] during World War I. 

Many villagers died as prisoners in the Austro-Hungarian Empire concentration camps. Croat nationalists reportedly harboured hatred at Prebilovci's contribution to the World War I Serbian army.&lt;ref&gt;Dulić, Tomislav. ''Utopias of Nation: Local Mass Killing in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 1941-42'', Uppsala University Library (2005), page 162&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Prebilovci was surrounded on the night of 4 August 1941 by some 3,000 Ustaša made up of the village's Croats.

==Massacre==
In August 1941, some 650 women and children were taken away from their homes, moved to  [[Šurmanci]] where they were later thrown into natural pits around that area — either dead or half-dead according to accounts – together with a thousand or so other Serbs from the Čapljina and [[Mostar]] municipalities. The men were in the mountains, hiding, in the deluded belief that the Croats would not harm their women and children.&lt;ref name="Copley"&gt;Copley, Gregory (editor-in-chief). ''The Balkan Conflict: The Psychological Strategy Aspects Defense &amp; Foreign Affairs Strategic Policy Volume XX, Number 12'', 31 December 1992, pp. 4–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Serbs of Prebilovci were herded together with other Serbs from the western part of Herzegovina and eventually six carloads of them were sent off on a train that was supposedly to take them to Belgrade. They were ordered out of the six cars they occupied at a town called Šurmanci, on the west bank of the [[Neretva]], and marched off into the hills never to return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.culturewars.com/CultureWars/Archives/cw_feb98/surmanci.html|title=The Ghosts of Surmanci: Queen of Peace, Ethnic Cleansing, Ruined Lives|author=[[E.

Atrocities began in the villages including the killing of 50 infants who were swung by their legs so that their heads could be dashed against the school wall. There was continuous rape of young girls both there and at other locations. On 6 August, 150 Ustaša under Ivan Jovanović (known as "Blacky") were joined by another 400 Ustaša from Čapljina, and took the prisoners in rail cattle-cars to Vranac, some 500 to 1,000 m from the Golubinka pit, one of many such natural, near-vertical cave formations in the region, where some 550 Ustaša took small groups of prisoners to the pit and, family-by-family, pushed them into it. The initial vertical fall was some 27 m, followed by a 100 m steep slope to the base of the pit. Small children were thrown up into the air before falling into the pit. One woman is known to have given birth as she fell into the pit. The newborn infant died with her under the crush of bodies.&lt;ref name="Copley"/&gt;

Here is how the Catholic Bishop of Mostar, [[Alojzije Mišić]], described this and other massacres perpetrated by the Ustasha around the city of Mostar, in his letter to Bishop Alojzije Stepinac, dated 7 November 1941:
:People were captured like animals. Slaughtered, killed - thrown alive into the abyss. Women, mothers with children, adult girls, women and children, both male and female were thrown into the pits. The Vice Mayor of Mostar Mr. Baljić, proclaimed publicly, as a clerk, he should be silent instead of talking, that in the town of Ljubinje, into only one pit, 700 Orthodox Christians were thrown. From Mostar and Čapljina six full rail wagons transported wives, mothers and girls younger than ten, to the station at Šurmanci, where they were taken to the hills, living mothers with children thrown down steep cliffs. Everyone was tossed down the cliffs and killed. In the parish Klepci, from surrounding villages N. N., 3,700 Orthodox Christians were killed. The poor souls, they remained peaceful. I won't enumerate further. I'd go too far. In the city of Mostar, hundreds were tied, taken outside the town and killed like animals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vukušić|first=Tomo|title=MOSTARSKI BISKUP ALOJZIJE MIŠIĆ ZA VRIJEME DRUGOGA SVJETSKOG RATA|publisher=Vrhbosanska katolička teologija u Sarajevu|quote=Ljude se hvatalo ko zvjerinje.

Od Mostara i Čapljine odvezla je željeznica šest punih vagona žena, majka i djevojaka, djece ispod deset godina do stanice Šurmanci, gdje su izvagonirani, odvedeni u brda, žive matere s djecom bacali u duboke propunte. Sve je strmoglavljeno i ubijeno. U župi Klepci iz okolnih sela N. N. 3.700 pravoslavaca ubijeno je. Jadnici, bili su mirni. Dalje ne nabrajam. Predaleko bih otišao. U samom gradu Mostaru na stotine ih je vezalo, odvodilo izvan grada pa ko živine ubijali"''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One entire clan of 78 persons died in the crush of the Golubinka pit near the village of Šurmanci. And after all were pushed into it, the Ustaša sat around drinking and celebrating. Only 170 villagers survived. Forty-five survived the crush of the pits and escaped later to tell of the disaster.&lt;ref name="Copley"/&gt; 300 children and infants were massacred that day alone.{{sfn|Vojinović|1991}}

==Aftermath==
A group of 170 villagers, which primarily consisted of men, survived the massacre. Two Roman Catholic priests, Ilija Tomas and Marko Hovko, were among the murderers. Few of the Ustaša who took part were tried after the [[Yugoslav People's Liberation War|war]] had ended.{{sfn|Vojinović|1991}} Only 14 of the 550 known Ustaša were brought to trial after the war, and one of the judges &lt;!-- name? --&gt;was himself an Ustaša close to the crime. Six were sentenced to death,&lt;!--names?; were the sentences carried out? --&gt; the remainder received prison sentences, the majority around three years.&lt;ref name="Copley"/&gt;

The Golubinka pit was opened in 1990 when Serbian priests headed by patriarch Pavle entered it and held a memorial service over the remnants of the victims. Around 1550 remnants were taken out from the pit. In 1991, on the 50th anniversary of the massacre, some 4000 victims, taken out from the Golubinka and from the surrounding 15 pits, were buried in the crypt of the Church of the Synaxis of Serbian Saints and Martyrs of [[Prebilovci]]. In June 1992, members of the Army of the Republic of Croatia burnt the village and destroyed the crypt and the church. The remnants of the holy relics are today held in the crypt of the temple under reconstruction.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

'''Prometheus''' (recorded as '''WPN-114''') was the [[list of long-living organisms|oldest]] known non-[[clonal colony|clonal]] organism, a [[Pinus longaeva|Great Basin bristlecone pine]] (''Pinus longaeva'') tree growing near the [[tree line]] on [[Wheeler Peak (Nevada)|Wheeler Peak]] in eastern [[Nevada]], [[United States]]. The tree, which was at least 4,862 years old and possibly more than 5,000, was cut down in 1964 by a graduate student and [[United States Forest Service]] personnel for research purposes.&lt;ref name=Currey1965&gt;{{cite journal|last=Currey|first=DR|authorlink=Donald Rusk Currey|title=An Ancient Bristlecone Pine Stand in Eastern Nevada (subscription required|journal=Ecology|volume=46|issue=4|pages=564–6|year=1965|jstor=1934900|doi=10.2307/1934900|url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/1934900}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those involved did not know of its world-record age before the cutting, but the circumstances and decision-making process remain controversial.

The tree's name refers to the mythological figure [[Prometheus]], who stole fire from the gods and gave it to man.&lt;ref&gt;Aeschylus, ''[[Prometheus Bound]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The designation WPN-114 was given by the original researcher, [[Donald Rusk Currey]], and means it was the 114th tree he sampled in his research in Nevada's [[White Pine County, Nevada|White Pine County]].

==About the tree==
 [[Image:Prometheus Wheeler.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Grove (nature)|grove]] in which Prometheus grew, with the [[headwall]] of [[Wheeler Peak (Nevada)|Wheeler Peak]] in the distance]]

Prometheus was a living member of a population of [[bristlecone pine]] trees near the tree line on the [[Moraine#Lateral moraines|lateral moraine]] of a former [[glacier]] on Wheeler Peak, in [[Great Basin National Park]], eastern Nevada. Wheeler Peak is the highest mountain in the [[Snake Range]], and the highest mountain entirely in the state of Nevada. The bristlecone pine population on this mountain is divided into at least two distinct sub-populations, one of which is accessible by a popular interpretive trail.

Prometheus, however, grew in an area reachable only by off-trail hiking. In either 1958 or 1961, a group of [[Natural history|naturalists]] who admired Prometheus's [[Grove (nature)|grove]] gave names to a number of the largest or most distinctive trees, including Prometheus.&lt;ref name=cohen&gt;[http://www.terrain.org/essays/14/cohen.htm "Oldest Living Tree Tells All"], Michael Cohen, Terrain.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currey originally estimated the tree was at least 4844&amp;nbsp;years old. A few years later, this was increased to 4862&amp;nbsp;by Donald Graybill of the [[University of Arizona]]'s [[Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research]]. These [[Dendrochronology|ring counts]] were done on a trunk cross-section taken about 2.5&amp;nbsp;m (8&amp;nbsp;feet) above the original [[germination]] point of the tree, because the innermost rings were missing below that point. Adjusting Graybill's figure by adding the estimated number of years required to reach that height, plus a correction for the estimated number of missing rings (not uncommon in trees at the tree line), it is probable that the tree was at least 5000&amp;nbsp;years old when felled. That made it the oldest known unitary (i.e. non-[[Cloning#Horticultural|clonal]]) organism at the time, exceeding even the [[Methuselah (tree)|Methuselah tree]] of the [[White Mountains (California)|White Mountains]]' [[Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest|Schulman Grove]], in [[California]], though Methuselah was later redated to 4845 years old.&lt;ref name="rmtrr.org"&gt;[http://www.rmtrr.org/oldlist.htm Rocky Mountain Tree Ring Research, OldList database of ancient trees]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 a bristlecone pine in California's White Mountains was measured by Tom Harlan to be 5062 years old,&lt;ref name="rmtrr.org"/&gt; making it the oldest known tree in North America and the oldest known individual tree in the world.

Whether Prometheus should have been considered the oldest organism ever known depends on the definition of "oldest" and "[[organism]]". Certain sprouting (clonal) organisms, such as [[Larrea tridentata|creosote bush]] or [[aspen]], may have older individuals if the entire clonal organism is considered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSL1190625120080411 Swedish spruce may be world's oldest living tree|Science|Reuters]&lt;/ref&gt; By that standard, the oldest living organism is a grove of [[Populus tremuloides|quaking aspens]] in [[Utah]] known as [[Pando (tree)|Pando]], at perhaps as much as 80,000&amp;nbsp;years old. In a clonal organism, however, the individual clonal [[Plant stem|stems]] are not nearly so old, and no part of the organism is particularly old at any given time. Until 2012, Prometheus was thus the oldest ''non-clonal'' organism yet discovered, with its innermost, extant rings exceeding 4862&amp;nbsp;years of age.

==Cutting of the tree==
{{refimprove|section|date=August 2017}}&lt;!--3 paragraphs without citations--&gt;
[[Image:Prometheus tree1.jpg|thumb|The cut stump of the Prometheus tree]]

In the 1950s [[Dendrochronology|dendrochronologists]] were making active efforts to find the oldest living tree species in order to use the analysis of the rings for various research purposes, such as the evaluation of former climates, the dating of archaeological ruins, and addressing the basic scientific question of maximum potential lifespan. Bristlecone pines in California's White Mountains and elsewhere were discovered by [[Edmund Schulman]] to be older than any species yet discovered. This spurred interest in finding very old bristlecones, possibly older than the [[Methuselah tree]], aged by Schulman in 1957 at over 4,700 years.

[[Donald R. Currey]] was a graduate student at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] studying the climate dynamics of the [[Little Ice Age]] using [[dendrochronology]] techniques. In 1963 he became aware of the bristlecone populations in the Snake Range in general, and on Wheeler Peak in particular. Based on the trees' size, growth rate and growth forms, he became convinced that some were very old, [[Core sample|cored]] some of them, and found trees exceeding 3,000 years in age, but Currey was not able to obtain a continuous series of overlapping cores from WPN-114.

Here, stories diverge. It is not clear whether Currey requested, or Forest Service personnel suggested, that he cut down and section the tree in lieu of coring it. There is also some uncertainty as to why a core sample could not be obtained. One version has it that he broke or lodged his only long increment borer and could not obtain another before the end of the field season;&lt;ref name=Radiolab&gt;"[http://www.radiolab.org/2010/jun/28/be-careful-what-you-plan-for/ Be Careful What You Plan For]", ''[[Radiolab]],'' June 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; another claims he broke two of them, while another implies that a core sample was too difficult to obtain and also would not provide as much definitive information as a full cross-section of the tree.&lt;ref name=hall&gt;"[http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Staying-Alive-High-in-California-s-White-2995266.php Staying Alive]", Carl Hall, ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', August 23, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there are conflicting views of Prometheus's uniqueness in the Wheeler Peak grove. It is reported that Currey and/or the Forest Service personnel who authorized the cutting believed the tree was just one of many large, very old trees in the grove. Others, at least one of whom was involved in the decision-making and tree cutting, believe that the tree was clearly unique&amp;nbsp;— obviously older than other trees in the area.

At least one person involved says that Currey knew that to be true at the time, although there is no known admission from Currey that he did, and others have disputed that the tree, based on observation alone, was obviously much older than the others.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt;&lt;ref name=hall/&gt;

Another uncertainty is that it is not clear why the felling of such an old tree was necessary given what Currey was studying. Since the [[Little Ice Age]] had started no more than 600 years ago, many trees could presumably have provided the information he was seeking for that time period. In Currey's original report in the journal ''Ecology'' (Currey, 1965), however, he refers to the Little Ice Age as encompassing the period from 2000 BC to the present, thus defining the Age over a much longer time period than is currently accepted. Whether this was a common view at the time is not known. In the article, Currey indicates that he sectioned the tree as much to determine whether the oldest bristlecones were necessarily confined to California's White Mountains (as some dendrochronologists had been claiming) as from its usefulness in regard to studies of the Little Ice Age.&lt;ref name=hall/&gt;

Whatever the rationale, the tree was cut down and sectioned in August 1964, and several pieces of the sections were hauled out to be processed and analyzed, first by Currey, then by others in later years. Sections or pieces of the tree have ended up in various places, some of them publicly accessible, including the [[Great Basin National Park]] visitor center ([[Baker, Nevada]]), the Ely Convention Center ([[Ely, Nevada]]), the University of Arizona Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research ([[Tucson, Arizona]]), and the U.S. Forest Service's [[Institute of Forest Genetics]] ([[Placerville, California]]).

==Repercussions==
It has been argued that the cutting down of Prometheus was an important factor in the movement to protect bristlecones in general, and the Wheeler Peak groves in particular.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.sonic.net/bristlecone/Martyr.html The Martyred One]", Leonard Miller, The Bristlecone Site.&lt;/ref&gt; There had been a movement to protect the mountain and contiguous areas as a national park before the incident, and 22 years later the area gained national park status.

==Contemporary references==
In August 2014, marking the fiftieth anniversary of the tree's cutting, a two-day memorial for Prometheus was held in [[Great Basin National Park]] by artist Jeff Weiss.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/la-et-cam-c1-prometheus-jeff-weiss-20150227-story.html#page=1 THE GHOST OF PROMETHEUS: A LONG-GONE TREE AND THE ARTIST WHO RESURRECTED ITS MEMORY]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rudolph Fentz''' (also spelled as '''Rudolf Fenz''') is the focal character of "I'm Scared", a 1952 [[science fiction]] [[short story]] by [[Jack Finney]], which was later reported as an [[urban legend]] as if the events had truly happened. The story tells of a 19th-century-looking young man possessing items of that period who is found confused in the middle of 1951 Times Square before being hit by a car and killed, suggesting that he had, perhaps involuntarily, time travelled about a century forwards. 

The story of Rudolph Fentz became one of the more significant urban legends of the 1970s and has been repeated occasionally since; with the spread of the Internet in the 1990s, it has been reported more often as a reproduction of facts and presented as evidence for the existence of [[time travel]].

==Urban legend==
The Fentz legend describes how one evening in mid-June 1951, at about 11:15&amp;nbsp;p.m., passersby at [[New York City]]'s [[Times Square]] noticed a man of about 20&amp;nbsp;years of age, dressed in the fashion of the late 19th century. No one observed how he had arrived there, and he was disoriented and confused standing in the middle of an intersection. He was hit by a taxi and fatally injured, before people were able to intervene.

The officials at the morgue searched his body and found the following items in his pockets:
*A copper token for a beer worth 5&amp;nbsp;cents, bearing the name of a saloon, which was unknown, even to older residents of the area;
*A bill for the care of a horse and the washing of a carriage, drawn by a [[livery stable]] on [[Lexington Avenue (Manhattan)|Lexington Avenue]] that was not listed in any address book;
*About 70&amp;nbsp;dollars in old [[banknote]]s;
*Business cards with the name Rudolph Fentz and an address on Fifth Avenue;
*A letter sent to this address, in June 1876 from Philadelphia;
*A medal for coming 3rd in a three legged race.
None of these objects showed any signs of aging.
Captain Hubert V. Rihm of the Missing Persons Department of [[NYPD]] tried using this information to identify the man. He found that the address on Fifth Avenue was part of a business; its current owner did not know Rudolph Fentz. Fentz's name was not listed in the address book, his fingerprints were not recorded anywhere, and no one had reported him missing. Rihm continued the investigation and finally found a Rudolph Fentz Jr. in a telephone book from 1939. Rihm spoke to the residents of the apartment building at the listed address who remembered Fentz and described him as a man about 60&amp;nbsp;years who had worked nearby. After his retirement, he moved to an unknown location in 1940. Contacting the bank, Rihm was told that Fentz died five years before, but his widow was still alive but lived in Florida. Rihm contacted her and learned that her husband's father (Rudolph Fentz) had disappeared in 1876, aged 29. He had left the house for an evening walk and never returned. All efforts to locate him were in vain and no trace remained.

Captain Rihm checked the missing persons files on Rudolph Fentz in 1876. The description of his appearance, age, and clothing corresponded precisely to the appearance of the unidentified dead man from Times Square. The case was still marked unsolved. Fearing he would be held mentally incompetent, Rihm never noted the results of his investigation in the official files.

==Short story==
Since 1972, the unexplained disappearance and reappearance of Rudolph Fentz has been mentioned in books (such as those by [[Viktor Farkas (author)|Viktor Farkas]]) and articles, and later on the Internet, portrayed as a real event. The story has been cited as evidence for various theories and assumptions about the topic of time travel.

In 2000, after the Spanish magazine ''Más Allá'' published a representation of the events as a factual report, folklore researcher [[Chris Aubeck]] investigated the description to check its veracity. His research led to the conclusion that the people and events of the story were fictional. Aubeck found that the Fentz-story appeared for the first time in the 1972 May/June issue of the ''[[Journal of Borderland Research]]'', which published it as a factual report. The magazine was published by the Borderland Sciences Research Foundation, a society that addressed UFO sightings with esoteric explanations. The magazine sourced the story to the book published in 1953, ''A Voice from the Gallery'' by Ralph M. Holland. Aubeck believed the origin of the fictional story had been found.

In August 2001, after Aubeck had published his research in the ''[[Akron Beacon Journal]]'', Pastor George Murphy contacted him to explain that the original source was older still. Ralph M. Holland had either taken the story about Rudolph Fentz completely from either a 1952 [[Robert Heinlein]] science fiction anthology, entitled ''[[Tomorrow, the Stars]]'' or the ''[[Collier's]]'' magazine from 15 September 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.unz.com/print/Colliers-1951sep15-00024/ |title= I'm Scared |journal= Collier's Magazine |date= 15 Sep 1951 |issue= 16 |pages= 24–25 |format= pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The true author was the renowned science fiction writer [[Jack Finney]] (1911–1995), and the Fentz episode was part of the short story "I'm Scared", which was published in ''Collier's'' first. The story describes a character called Rudolph Fentz behaving as described in the urban legend, with the narrator Captain Hubert V. Rihm giving his opinions of the case.

'''Sandwich City Hall''', which is also known as the '''Sandwich City Hall &amp; Opera House''', is the government center for the city of [[Sandwich, Illinois]] in [[DeKalb County, Illinois|DeKalb County]]. The first floor of the building is occupied by city government while the second floor of the historic building houses an active [[opera house]]. Sandwich City Hall &amp; Opera House is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and has been since 1979.

==History==

===Construction and early years===
Sandwich City Hall was constructed in 1878. This building reflects the post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] style, meant to evoke the spirit of the early years after a war that broke apart the purer architectural styles and mingled together in a mixture of revival styles. The construction was funded by a [[Bond (finance)|bond]] issue of $10,000 approved by the mayor and city [[alderman|aldermen]] in Sandwich. Eventually, a $2,000 cost overrun required additional bond issues. The city turned over the design of the structure to local [[architect]]s Enos and Israel Doan. The building was completed on schedule in January 1879. The finished product was 48 by 80 feet. The first floor had 12 foot ceilings while the second floor included a [[balcony]] and 22 foot ceilings.&lt;ref name=sandwich&gt;[http://www.sandwich.il.us/cityhall.html City Hall &amp; Opera House] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229085652/http://www.sandwich.il.us/cityhall.html |date=2006-12-29 }}, Community Information, City of Sandwich, Official site.&lt;/ref&gt;

The building became a complete community center when it was completed. The first floor housed the [[mayor]]'s office, the [[city clerk]]'s office, council room, visiting [[judge]]'s chambers, engine room and a [[Marshal#United States|marshall's]] office. The marshall's office had five jail cells. The upper floor of the building became the opera house. The opera house became an all-purpose theatre. It featured shows of all types, [[vaudevillian]], [[Shakespearean]], lectures, [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]] meetings, recitials, high school plays and graduations, church gatherings, firemen's ball and many other events. As other facilities became available to clientele the Opera House was left idle following [[World War II]]. City government offices continued to function within building despite the dormant theater above.&lt;ref name=sandwich/&gt;

===New life===
[[Image:Sandwich City Hall8.jpg|thumb|right|Sandwich City Hall from its east side.]]
A community group was responsible for Sandwich City Hall's placement on the National Register in 1979. A few years later in 1982 the group, the Association to Restore City Hall, was given tax-exempt status and received a grant of nearly $1.3 million from the [[Illinois Department of Commerce|Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs]] in 1983. The grant covered 75% of restoration and construction costs and the restoration was completed in 1986.&lt;ref name=sandwich/&gt; The restoration provided new offices for many city government officials including the mayor, City Clerk, Assistant City Clerk, and City Engineer. In addition it provided for a public area where residents could pay bills or conduct other business.&lt;ref name=ipo&gt;[http://www.lib.niu.edu/ipo/1987/im870810.html City of Sandwich Rededicates City Hall and Opera House] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910161425/http://www.lib.niu.edu/ipo/1987/im870810.html |date=2006-09-10 }}, ''Illinois Municipal Review'', August 1987, page 10, Illinois Periodicals Online.&lt;/ref&gt;

The restoration also included an addition on the rear of the building. The addition provided for a community room on the first floor and on the second floor allowed for additional facilities for the opera house, including make up rooms and storage. Other areas to be restored and renovated included the [[foyer]]s, the main entrance, the original [[walnut]] [[staircase]] on the west side of the building and a custom made stairway for the east are of the second floor was constructed.&lt;ref name=ipo/&gt; The police department and jail area ceased to be used in 1977 but the restoration incorporated it into the revamped structure. Though the jail area is now a women's restroom it still bears the old iron bars of the original jail cells, albeit fastened open.&lt;ref name=ipo/&gt;

When the restoration was completed in 1986 the city of Sandwich held a rededication ceremony that was attended by several state level political officials including then [[Lieutenant Governor]] [[George H. Ryan]]. The rededication was attended by numerous local officials as well.&lt;ref name=ipo/&gt;

The once dormant Opera House portion of the city hall building is once again fully operational. With city government still operating on the first floor the opera house has a full season. Sandwich City Hall's second floor has become home to [[classical music]] performances, [[country-western]] ensembles, student recitals, [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] performances, dance, [[drama]] by the Indian Valley Theatre, [[pop (music)|pop]] performances, and numerous other events. The facility is available for rent based upon scheduling.&lt;ref name=sandwich/&gt; In the first year following the 1986 restoration 18,725 people attended performances and programs of all types at the opera house.&lt;ref name=ipo/&gt;

A '''street fair''' is a [[fair]] that celebrates the character of a [[neighborhood]]. As its name suggests, it is usually held on the main street of a neighborhood.

The principal component of street fairs are booths used to sell goods (particularly food) or convey information; sometimes they have carnival rides and parades, as well. Many have live music and dance demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://runawaydinosaur.com/2008/05/16/friday-food-ninth-avenue-international-food-festival-this-sunday-518/ Ninth Avenue International Food Festival]&lt;/ref&gt;

They are usually no more than a few blocks long, although some fairs, such as the  [http://www.ninthavenuefoodfestival.com 9th Avenue International Food Festival] in [[New York City]] and the [[Solano Stroll]] in [[Northern California]] extend more than a mile.  A fair only one block long is commonly called a [[block party]].

==Variety==
[[Image:Ballard Fest 2006 5.jpg|thumb|left|A street fair in the historically seafaring neighborhood of [[Ballard, Seattle, Washington]]]]
Street fairs vary greatly in character, even within one city. Annual street fairs in [[Seattle]], for example, include the [[University District, Seattle, Washington|University District]] Street Fair, featuring the work of numerous [[craft]]speople, and requiring that the person who actually made the goods that are for sale must be present in their own booth; the [[Fremont, Seattle, Washington|Fremont]] Fair features crafts from around the world, as well as the [[Summer Solstice Parade and Pageant]], famed for its [[Solstice Cyclists|painted naked cyclists]]. In the same city, the [[Capitol Hill, Seattle, Washington|Capitol Hill]] [[Capitol Hill Block Party|Block Party]] fences off several blocks, charges admission, and features many of the city's best known [[rock music|rock bands]] while the [[International District, Seattle, Washington|Chinatown-International District]] Summer Fair has a distinctly [[Asian-American]] and [[Pacific Islander]] flavor, with [[taiko]] drummers, [[martial arts]] demonstrations, and [[Hawaiian dance]].

In [[Belgium]], street fairs are known as [[braderie]]s, which translates to ''roasting''; a reference to the frequent roasting of meat at these events.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7492">'''The Columbia Threadneedle Prize''' (formerly '''The Threadneedle Prize)''' is a major art prize, which showcases contemporary figurative art. It was launched by the [[Mall Galleries]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="FT 2009" /&gt; The prize is open to any artist, eighteen or over, who is living or working in the UK or Continental Europe.

==Background==
The Threadneedle Prize was launched in 2008 to support the popular interest in [[figurative art]]. It was organised by the Federation of British Artists and offered a prize of £25,000.&lt;ref name="FT 2009" /&gt; The new competition coincided with a move by the rival [[Turner Prize]] away from painting and sculpture and, in some eyes, becoming "trivial and dull".&lt;ref name="FT 2009" /&gt; Art critic [[Brian Sewell]] welcomed the new prize, though complained that the majority of entries were disappointing, concluding that the "new prize is capable of achieving a greater good than any other, but it must, without becoming quite as predictable as the Turner Prize... achieve next year a far higher level of distinction."&lt;ref name="ES 2008" /&gt;

In 2009 almost half of the 80 final exhibits at the [[Mall Galleries]] were portrait paintings, in a wide variety of styles.&lt;ref name="FT 2009" /&gt;

By 2013 the number of exhibits had increased to 111, chosen from over 3,500 entries.&lt;ref name="CLife 2013" /&gt;

== Prizes ==
In the first year of the competition there was a single prize of £25,000. In 2010 the Visitors’ Choice Prize, worth £10,000, was introduced.&lt;ref name="BBC 2010" /&gt; The two major prizes available are the Threadneedle Prize and the Visitor’ Choice Prize. In 2012 the Threadneedle Prize was increased from £25,000 to £30,000 making it the largest prize for single work of art in the UK. For the Threadneedle Prize, a panel of selectors shortlist six works and then choose the winner of the £30,000 prize. Two finalists for the Visitors' Choice Prize are awarded £500. Each of the five finalists for the Threadneedle Prize receives £1,000. In 2013 there are eight prizes totalling £46,000.

Selectors have included artists, critics and curators [[Peter Randall-Page]], [[Ed Vaizey]], [[Michael Sandle]], [[Jock McFadyen]], [[Daphne Todd]], [[Richard Cork]] and [[Desmond Shawe-Taylor]].

In 2016, the £20,000 winner - ''Salt in Tea'' by Lewis Hazelwood-Horner - was also named the winner of the £10,000 Visitors' Choice Award.

Following the 2016 exhibition at Mall Galleries, London, selected works from the Prize toured to Palazzo Strozzi in Florence, Italy.

'''Tony Marryatt''' (born 1954) is a senior manager employed by local government in New Zealand.  Between 2007 and 2013, he was the [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) of [[Christchurch City Council]], succeeding Lesley McTurk. He lost his position over the city council being stripped of its building consent accreditation.

==Professional career==
Marryatt served as the [[CEO]] of [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton City Council, New Zealand]] from 1996 to 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hamilton.co.nz/news/pageid/2145834348 |title=Hamilton City Council - CEO resigns to take up job in Christchurch |date=15 Feb 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525003331/http://hamilton.co.nz/news/pageid/2145834348 |archivedate=May 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marryatt's predecessor at Christchurch City Council, Dr Lesley McTurk, resigned in January 2007 to take up the CEO-role at [[Housing New Zealand Corporation|Housing New Zealand]]. Marryatt's appointment as CEO in Christchurch was announced by mayor Garry Moore on 15 February 2007.&lt;ref name="CCC 2007 appointment"&gt;{{cite news |title=Christchurch Council Chief Executive appointed |url= http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/AK0702/S00160.htm |accessdate=7 January 2012 |newspaper=Press Release: Christchurch City Council (via Scoop)|date=15 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Maryatt's local government tenure has not been without controversy. He has been held responsible for the loss-making [[Hamilton 400|Hamilton V8 Supercars]] event by his opponents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/ceo-defends-part-in-v8-fiasco-4490034 |title=CEO defends part in V8 fiasco |newspaper=[[One News (New Zealand)|One News]] |date=31 October 2011 |accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; notably then-mayor of Hamilton [[David Braithwaite]], who frequently clashed with Marryatt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/waikato-times/news/769274/Citys-CEO-went-too-far |newspaper=[[Waikato Times]] |date=19 December 2008 |title=City's CEO 'went too far' |accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2011 he, along with the [[Bob Parker (mayor)|Bob Parker]]-led Christchurch City Council, garnered controversy for accepting a $70,000 pay rise as the council's CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/christchurch-protest-over-city-chief-s-pay-rise-4666796 |newspaper=[[One News (New Zealand)|One News]] |date=22 December 2011 |title=Christchurch protest over city chief's pay rise |accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated in a protest rally attended by some 4,000 people in February 2012. In late August of that year, it emerged that Marryatt had taken a personal grievance against city councillors. Whilst the case was settled before it went to court, the city council reimbursed his legal costs, which were between NZ$10,000 to NZ$30,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mathewson |first=Nicole |title=Marryatt's legal action criticised |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/7597953/Marryatts-legal-action-criticised |accessdate=23 September 2012|newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=3 September 2012|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maryatt was also condemned by the Canterbury Employers Chamber of Commerce for his decision to grant council staff an extra 11 days leave a year without first seeking approval from elected city councillors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1= Cairns |first1 =Lois |title=Council leave inquiry sought  |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/7945347/Council-leave-inquiry-sought |accessdate=21 October 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With effect from 8 July 2013, Christchurch City Council has been stripped of its accreditation for issuing building consents. This comes in the middle of a rebuild period following the devastating February [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]].&lt;ref name="CCC stripped"&gt;{{cite news |last1= Cairns |first1 =Lois |last2 =Young |first2 =Rachel |title=Council to be banned from issuing consents |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/8862238/Council-to-be-banned-from-issuing-consents |accessdate=1 July 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; City councillors found out earlier in June through the media that [[International Accreditation New Zealand]] (IANZ) had written to council and threatened to withdraw accreditation, with Marryatt replying that Parker and other councillors were kept in the dark because he was confident staff were addressing issues raised by IANZ, and that the June 28 deadline would be met."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1 =Cairns |first1 =Lois  |last2 =Young |first2 =Rachel |title=Marryatt regrets letter surprise |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/8799213/Marryatt-regrets-letter-surprise |accessdate=1 July 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[The Crown|Crown]] manager, Doug Martin, has been installed to reform the council's consenting department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last2 =Conway |first2 =Glenn |last1 =Young |first1 =Rachel |title='Major challenges' ahead &lt;!-- Online version has different title: "Council consents backlog is growing" --&gt; |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/9127157/Council-consents-backlog-is-growing |accessdate=21 October 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=5 September 2013 |page=A2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marryatt lost his job over the affair, but stayed on the payroll until November 2013 and  received a total of $500,000 on departure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last =Conway |first =Glenn |title=Controversial Marryatt to leave Christchurch council |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/local-body-elections/9161306/Controversial-Marryatt-to-leave-Christchurch-council |accessdate=21 October 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=13 September 2013 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parker, who had backed the controversial CEO over the years, took his part of the responsibility and decided not to stand for re-election for a [[Christchurch mayoral election, 2013|third term as mayor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Conway |first=Glenn |title='This happened on my watch' - Parker |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/local-elections-2013/8887205/This-happened-on-my-watch-Parker |accessdate=6 July 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Buddhism}}
The '''Uposatha''' ({{lang-sa|Upavasatha}}) is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] day of observance, in existence from the Buddha's time (600 BCE), and still being kept today in Buddhist countries.&lt;ref&gt;For a description of the contemporary practice of the Uposatha in Thailand, see Khantipalo (1982a), which is also excerpted in this article below. 
Kariyawasam (1995), ch. 3, also underlines the continuity of the ancient ''uposatha'' practice in Sri Lanka: "The ''poya'' [Sinhala for ''uposatha''] observance, which is as old as Buddhism itself, has been followed by the Sinhala Buddhists up to the present day, even after the Christian calendar came to be used for secular matters. Owing to its significance in the religious life of the local Buddhists, all the full-moon days have been declared public holidays by the government."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The uposatha day is sometimes likened to the Judeo-Christian notion of the Sabbath.  Pali English dictionaries that define "Uposatha" as "Sabbath," are Buddhadatta (2002), p. 63,  and PED(Rhys-Davids &amp; Stede,1921-25), p. 151. 
For an example of the Uposatha being equated with Sabbath by a modern Buddhist master, see Mahasi (''undated''), p. 2, where he writes: "For lay people, these rules [of discipline] comprise the [[The Eight Precepts|eight precepts]] which Buddhist devotees observe on the Sabbath days (uposatha) and during periods of meditation."  Harvey (1990), p. 192, also refers to the ''uposatha'' as "sabbath-like."&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha taught that the Uposatha day is for "the cleansing of the defiled mind," resulting in inner calm and joy.&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro (1997b); Anguttara Nikaya 3.70: Muluposatha Sutta.&lt;/ref&gt; On this day, both lay and ordained members of the sangha intensify their practice, deepen their knowledge and express communal commitment through millennia-old acts of lay-monastic reciprocity. On these days, the lay followers make a conscious effort to keep the [[Five Precepts]] or (as the tradition suggests) the [[Five Precepts#Eight Precepts|Eight Precepts]]. It is a day for practicing the Buddha's teachings and meditation.

==Observance days==

Depending on the culture and time period, uposatha days have been observed from two to six days each lunar month.

===Theravada countries===

In general, Uposatha is observed about once a week in [[Theravada]] countries&lt;ref&gt;, with the full moon being the most important one, followed by the new moon. Each lunar month has eight days after both the new moon and full moon Uposatha days and then either six or seven days after the other two quarter moon Uposatha days. Thus, in relation to the [[Gregorian calendar]]'s seven-day week, sometimes there are two uposatha days in a week (such as occurred the week of August 17, 2006, when uposatha days fell on August 17 and August 23, 2006) and sometimes there are none (such as occurred the week of January 15, 2006, which fell between uposatha days on January 14 and January 22, 2006).  Nonetheless, there are four uposatha days a month and the average solar month's week has one uposatha day.&lt;/ref&gt; in accordance with the four [[lunar phase]]s: the [[new moon]], the [[full moon]], and the two quarter moons in between.&lt;ref&gt;More specifically, using a [[Buddhist calendar]], Uposatha is observed on the following four days of the lunar month (PTS, 1921-25, pp. 151-2): 
*first (new moon)
*eighth (first quarter or waxing moon)
*fifteenth (full moon)
*twenty-third (last quarter or waning moon)
According to the ''Pali English Dictionary'' (Rhys Davids and Stede, 1921-25, pp. 16, 152), the lunar month's eighth day (that is, the eighth day after the new moon) and twenty-third day (which is the eighth day after the full moon) are called in Pali ''atthama,'' which literally means the "eighth," that is, the eighth day of the lunar half-month.&lt;/ref&gt; In some communities, such as in Sri Lanka, only the new moon and full moon are observed as uposatha days.&lt;ref&gt;Nyanaponika &amp; Bodhi (1999), pp. 24, 307 ''n''. 26.  Nyanaponika &amp; Bodhi refers to the quarter-moon days as "semi-Uposatha." Harvey (1990), p. 192, states that the ''uposatha'' is observed "at the full-moon, new-moon and, less importantly, two half-moon days."  He goes on to state: "Except at times of major festivals, observance [''uposatha''] days are attended only by the more devout, who spend a day and night at their local monastery." [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/kariyawasam/wheel402.html#ch3 Kariyawasam (1995), ch. 3], makes a similar observation in regards to modern Sinhalese society: "The popular practice is to observe [the Eight Precepts] on full-moon days, and, among a few devout lay Buddhists, on the other phases of the moon as well."&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Buddhism in Myanmar|Burmese Buddhism]], Uposatha (called {{my|ဥပုသ်နေ့}} ''ubot nei'') is observed by more pious Buddhists on the following days: waxing moon ({{my|လဆန်း}} ''la hsan''), full moon ({{my|လပြည့်နေ့}} ''la pyei nei''), waning moon ({{my|လဆုတ်}} ''la hsote''), and new moon ({{my|လကွယ်နေ့}} ''la kwe nei'').&lt;ref name="spiro"&gt;{{cite book |title=Buddhism and Society: A Great Tradition and its Burmese Viscittudes |last=Melford |first=Spiro |year=1970 |publisher=Harper and Row |isbn= |pages=214–228 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common days of observance are the full moon and the new moon. In precolonial Burma, Uposatha was a legal holiday that was observed primarily in urban areas, where secular activities like business transactions came to a halt.&lt;ref name="spiro"/&gt; However, since colonial rule, Sunday has replaced Uposatha as the legal day of rest. All major Burmese Buddhist holidays occur on Uposathas, namely [[Thingyan]], the beginning of [[Vassa]] (beginning in the full moon of Waso, around July, to the full moon of Thadingyut, around October). During this period, Uposatha is more commonly observed by Buddhists than during the rest of the year. During Uposatha days, Buddhist monks at each monastery assemble and recite the [[prātimokṣa|patimokkha]], a concise compilation of the [[Vinaya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Buddhism: An Illustrated Review|publisher=Hanthawaddy Printing Works|location=Rangoon, Burma|date=1905|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mahayana countries===

In [[Mahayana]] countries that use the [[Chinese calendar]], the Uposatha days are observed ten times a month, on the 1st, 8th, 14th, 15th, 18th, 23rd, 24th and final three days of each lunar month. Alternatively, one can only observe Uposatha days six times a month; on the 8th, 14th, 15th, 23rd  and final two days of each lunar month.&lt;ref&gt;http://ftp.budaedu.org/ebooks/pdf/CE002.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, these six days are known as the {{nihongo|'''roku sainichi'''|六斎日|Six Days of Fasting}}.

=== Names of Full Moon Uposatha Days ===
The Pali names of the uposatha days are based on the Sanskrit names of the ''[[Nakshatra|nakśatra]]'' (Pali: ''nakkhatta''), the constellations or lunar mansions through which the moon passes within a lunar month.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Nakshatra]], [[Hindu calendar]], ''Sanskrit English Dictionary'' by Monier Williams, s.v. 'nakśatra'.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The word "uposatha" is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word "upavasatha," which refers to the pre-Buddhistic fast day that preceded sacrifices in the [[historical Vedic religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Khantipalo (1982a); Ñanavara (1993), question No.&amp;nbsp;1 [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nanavara/uposatha.html#qa]; and the Pali English Dictionary(Rhys-Davids &amp; Stede,1921-25, p. 151).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khantipalo (1982a) also translates "uposatha" as literally meaning "entering [a monastery] to stay" but no other source supports this.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Dutt|1988|p=73}}

In the Buddha's time, some ascetics used the new and full moon as opportunities to present their teachings.  The Uposatha Day was instituted by the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] at the request of King [[Bimbisara]], and the Buddha instructed the monks to give teachings to the laypeople on this day, and told the monks to recite the [[Patimokkha]] every second Uposatha day.&lt;ref&gt;Rhys Davids &amp; Oldenberg (1881), pp. 240-41. Also see Khantipalo (1982a) and Pali English Dictionary(Rhys Davids &amp; Stede, 1921-25, p. 152).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practice ==

=== Lay practice ===

On each uposatha day, devout [[Upāsaka and Upāsikā]] practice the [[Five Precepts#Eight Precepts|Eight Precepts]],&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Kariyawasam (1995), Khantipalo (1982b), Ñanavara &amp; Kantasilo (1993) and Thanissaro (1997b).&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps echoing the Buddha's teaching that laypeople should "imitate" [[arhat]]s on Uposatha days.&lt;ref&gt;"The Uposatha Observance Discourse" in Nyanaponika &amp; Bodhi, 1999, pp. 216-18 or, using comparable wording, in Nanavara &amp; Khantasilo, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|The Eight Precepts are modelled after the [[Five Precepts#Ten Precepts|Ten Precepts]] observed by [[śrāmaṇera|novice monks]], except that the seventh and eighth precepts for the novices are combined, the ninth novice precept becomes the eighth, and the tenth novice precept (non-acceptance of gold and silver, use of money) is excluded as being impracticable for a lay person.&lt;ref&gt;Nyanaponika &amp; Bodhi (1999), p. 307, ''n''. 26&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For lay practitioners who live near a [[vihara]], Uposatha is an opportunity for them to visit it, make [[Offering (Buddhism)|offerings]], listen to dhamma talks by monks and participate in [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]] sessions.

For lay practitioners unable to participate in the events of a local monastery, the uposatha is a time to intensify one's own meditation and Dhamma practice,&lt;ref&gt;Bullitt (2005); and, Khantipalo (1982a).&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, meditating an extra session or for a longer time,&lt;ref name="Khantipalo 1982a"&gt;Khantipalo (1982a).&lt;/ref&gt; reading or [[Buddhist chant|chanting]] special [[Buddhist texts]],&lt;ref&gt;Khantipalo (1982a), for instance, suggests reading one of the following:
*Visakhuposatha Sutta ("Discourse to Visakha on the Uposatha with the Eight Practices," AN 8.43) (Khantipalo, 1982b).
*[[Metta Sutta|Karaniya-metta Sutta]] ("Discourse on Loving-kindness," [[Sutta Nipata|Sn]] 1.8) (Piyadassi, 1999a).
*[[Mangala Sutta|Maha-mangala Sutta]] ("Discourse on Blessings," Sn 2.4) (Narada, 1985).
*[[Ratana Sutta]] ("Jewel Discourse," Sn 2.1) (Piyadassi, 1999b).
*[[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta]] ("Discourse on Setting the Wheel of Dhamma in Motion," [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 56.11) (Thanissaro, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; [[anussati|recollecting]]&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, the "Muluposatha Sutta" (AN 3.70) (Thanissaro, 1997b) regarding Uposatha-specific recollections and Thanissaro (1999) for the general Buddhist practice of recollections.  In the Muluposatha Sutta, the Buddha recommends practicing recollection of the [[Three Jewels]] as well as of one's own virtue (''[[Śīla|sila]]'') and of the wholesome qualities that leads to rebirth as a [[Deva (Buddhism)|deva]].  In this sutta, if one spends the Uposatha engaged in such a recollection, then that Uposatha acquires the name of the recollection, such as Dhamma-Uposatha or virtue-Uposatha.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Dāna|giving]] in some special way.&lt;ref name="Khantipalo 1982a"/&gt;

=== Monastic practice ===

On the new-moon and full-moon uposatha, in monasteries where there are four or more [[bhikkhu]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Rhys Davids &amp; Oldenberg (1881), p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; the local Sangha will recite the [[Patimokkha]]. Before the recitation starts, the monks will confess any violations of the disciplinary rules to another monk or to the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Buddhadatta (2002), p. 63, and Bullitt (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the speed of the Patimokkha chanter (one of the monks), the recitation may take from 30 minutes to over an hour. Depending on the monastery, lay people may or may not be allowed to attend.&lt;ref name="Khantipalo 1982a"/&gt;

Describing his experience of Uposatha day in Thailand, Khantipalo (1982a) writes:
{{quote|Early in the morning lay people give almsfood to the bhikkhus who may be walking on almsround, invited to a layman's house, or the lay people may take the food to the monastery. Usually lay people do not eat before serving their food to the bhikkhus and they may eat only once that day.... Before the meal the laity request the Eight Precepts [from the bhikkhus] ..., which they promise to undertake for a day and night. It is usual for lay people to go to the local monastery and to spend all day and night there.... [In monasteries where] there is more study, [lay people] will hear as many as three or four discourses on Dhamma delivered by senior bhikkhus and they will have books to read and perhaps classes on Abhidhamma to attend....  In a meditation monastery ..., most of their time will be spent mindfully employed – walking and seated meditation with some time given to helping the bhikkhus with their daily duties. So the whole of this day and night (and enthusiastic lay people restrict their sleep) is given over to Dhamma.}}

== Special Uposatha days ==

In Thailand five full-moon Uposatha days are of special significance and are called [[puja (Buddhism)|puja]]:&lt;ref&gt;Bullitt (2005). Bullitt orders these special uposatha days in accordance with the Gregorian calendar, where Magha Uposatha thus starts the calendar year.  However, in accordance with Asian lunar calendars, where the new year starts in mid April, Visakha Uposatha is the first special uposatha day of the year.  The lunar calendar ordering of these days is maintained in this article for primarily two reasons: Visakha Uposatha is the most important of the uposatha festivals; and, ordering these uposatha days in this manner (i.e., Visakha Uposatha [Buddha Day], Asalha Uposatha [Dhamma Day], Magha Uposatha [Sangha Day]) celebrates the [[Triple Gem]] (Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha) in the order in which it is traditionally enumerated.  Also see [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/kariyawasam/wheel402.html#ch3 Kariyawasam, ch. 3, "Poya Days,"] where he identifies the relevance of all twelve full-moon uposatha days in contemporary Sinhala culture.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Visakha Puja or Visakha Uposatha '''&lt;ref&gt;"[[Vaisakha|Vesākha]]" (Pali) is the second month of the Buddhist lunar year, usually occurring in the [[Gregorian calendar]]'s February. In Thailand this day is called 'Visakha Puja.' The word ''puja'' means "veneration" or "offering" and in Thailand is suffixed to all Uposatha days. (Pali month names are from the ''Pali English Dictionary'' (Rhys Davids &amp; Stede,1921-25, p. 531 s.v. "māsa").&lt;/ref&gt; or '''[[Vesak]]''' ("Buddha Day"):
is the most sacred Buddhist holiday. It is the anniversary of the Buddha's birth, awakening and [[parinirvana|parinibbana]].&lt;ref&gt;For Mahayana Buddhists, the celebration of the [[Buddha's Birthday|Buddha's birthday]] is independent of recognitions of his awakening and parinibbana and is celebrated on the waxing moon of the fourth Chinese lunar month.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Asalha Puja]]''' or Asalha Uposatha.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Aashaadha|Āsālha]]" (Pali) is the fourth lunar month, usually around July.&lt;/ref&gt; ("Dhamma Day"):
:anniversary of the Buddha's delivering his first discourse, which is collected as the ''[[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta]]''. The three-month-long [[Vassa]] retreat starts the following day.
* '''[[Pavarana]]''':&lt;ref&gt;Pavarana Day is in the seventh lunar month of [[Asvina|Assayuja]] (Pali), usually in October.&lt;/ref&gt;
:the end of the Rains Retreat residence during which time each monk atones before the Sangha for any offense they may have committed.&lt;ref&gt;Rhys Davids &amp; Oldenberg (1881), pp. 329-30.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Anapanasati Day''':&lt;ref&gt;Anapanasati Day is the eighth lunar month of Kattika (Pali), usually in November.&lt;/ref&gt;
Anniversary of the Buddha's delivering the ''[[Anapanasati Sutta]]''. This event is not connected to an Uposatha (Poya) day in Sri Lanka and perhaps is particular to Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;The Anapanasati Sutta ("Mindfulness of Breathing Discourse," [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 118) (Thanissaro, 2006) opens on Pavarana Day in the town of Savatthi where the Buddha declares to an assembly of monks that he is so happy with the assembly's practice that he would stay in Savatthi another month.  After that month passes, the Buddha delivers the core instructions of the Anapanasati Sutta, instructions which have guided lay people and monastics to higher achievement for millennia.  Thus, given this canonical chronology,  Anapanasati Day is celebrated a lunar month after Pavarana Day.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Magha Puja]]''' or Magha Uposatha.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Maagha|Māgha]]" (Pali) is the eleventh lunar month, usually around February.&lt;/ref&gt; ("Sangha Day"):
Anniversary of the assembling of 1250 monks in the Buddha's presence during which time he delivered the "Ovada-Patimokkha Gatha."&lt;ref&gt;The three-line Ovada-Patimokkha Gatha (Pali: "Patimokkha Exhortation Verse") (translated in [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/dhammayut/chanting.html#ovada Dhammayut Order in the United States of America, 1994)] includes the Buddha's famous dictum: "Not doing any evil, doing what is skillful, purifying one's own mind, this is the Buddha's teaching."  This verse is familiar to many Westerners because it is rehashed in the widely popular [[Dhammapada]], chapter XIV, verses 183-85 [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/dhp/dhp.14.than.html#dhp-183 (Thanissaro, 1997a)].&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sri Lanka, three full moon Uposatha or [[Poya]] days are of special significance.&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight.org"&gt;See http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/kariyawasam/wheel402.html#ch3 Kariyawasam, ch. 3, "Poya Days."&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Vesak|Vesak Poya]]''', which is described above.
* '''Poson Poya''' corresponds to the Jeṭṭhā uposatha, which falls in June. It is of special significance in Sri Lanka because the monk [[Mahinda (Buddhist monk)|Mahinda]], [[Asoka]]'s son, officially introduced Buddhism to Sri Lanka on this day in the 3rd century B.C. 
* '''[[Asalha Puja|Esala Poya]]''' corresponds to ''Āsāḷhā uposatha'', the full moon of July, and is described above. This day has special significance in Sri Lanka because it was the day that 56 nobles, headed by Prince Ariṭṭha, became the first Sri Lankans to be fully ordained as a bhikkhus at Cetiyagiri in [[Mihintale]] by Mahinda and his companions. It therefore marks the founding of the Lankan Bhikkhu Sangha.&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight.org"/&gt;

In Tibet and Bhutan, there are four full moon Uposatha days that are of importance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astraltraveler.com/calendars/buddhist.html|title=.:. Buddhist Calendar .:. ASTRAL TRAVELER .:.|first=Danyel|last=Seagan|date=|website=www.astraltraveler.com|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Chotrul Duchen''' 
* '''[[Vesak|Saga Dawa Duchen]]'''
* '''Chokhor Duchen'''
* '''[[Lhabab Duchen]]'''

'''UppCon''' was a Swedish [[anime]] and [[manga]] convention held annually in [[Uppsala]]. The event, which was arranged by the nonprofit organization Uppsalakai, was the largest event of its type in the Nordic countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unt.se/uppsala/nedrakning-infor-uppcon-1362826.aspx Nedräkning infer UppCon] ''[[UNT]]'' 2 Juni 2011, retrieved 22 September 2011 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;. During the 1990s the name had been used by a now defunct [[gaming convention]].

The first of the conventions was held in 2002, at the vintage cinema Slottsbiografen. Over the years the event had grown and in 2009 it had more than 3,000 attendants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unt.se/kultur/mangafantasterna-invaderar-894061.aspx Mangafantasterna invaderar] ''[[Upsala Nya Tidning]]'' 9 April 2010, retrieved 4 February 2011 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The conventions usually lasted for three days, from Friday to Sunday, where people with similar interests for example met up to watch [[anime]], compete in [[cosplay]]-contests and play videogames.

Many organizations had put up tables to display products they had for sale. Most of them sold imported goods from [[Japan]], such as [[manga]], [[anime]], figures, dolls, clothes and candy such as [[Pocky]].

The eleventh UppCon was held on June 3–5, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uppcon.se&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012 it was reported that the UppCon: 12-event would be the last UppCon arranged by its founders.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unt.se/uppsala/sista-aret-for-uppcon-1758249.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Commission on Orders of Chivalry]] (ICOC) includes a list of ''ecclesiastical decorations'' in its Register since 1998, which only "possess full validity as awards of merit or honours within the respective Churches which have instituted them" but excludes bodies "which are often created as a purely private initiative, and which subsequently place themselves under the 'protection' of a Patriarchal See or Archbishopric."&lt;ref name="ICOC"&gt;{{cite book|location=[s.l.]|publisher=[s.n.]|author=International Commission for Orders of Chivalry|authorlink=International Commission on Orders of Chivalry|title=Register of Orders of Chivalry|year=2006|type=pamphlet|chapter=Ecclesiastical Decorations|url=http://www.icocregister.org/2006ecclesiasticaldecorations.htm|accessdate=2013-06-27|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120190731/http://www.icocregister.org/2006ecclesiasticaldecorations.htm|archivedate=2008-11-20|deadurl=no}} Also {{cite book|location=[s.l.]|publisher=[s.n.]|author=International Commission for Orders of Chivalry|authorlink=International Commission on Orders of Chivalry|title=Register of Orders of Chivalry|year=2007|type=pamphlet|at=xiv, xix–xx|url=http://www.icocregister.org/2007ICOCRegister.pdf|accessdate=2013-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the {{abbr|OCT|Order of the Crown of Thorns}} or {{abbr|OLBC|Order of the Lion and the Black Cross}} are found in the {{abbr|ICOC|International Commission on Orders of Chivalry}} Register.

==Order of the Crown of Thorns==

The awards associated with Vilatte include those named ''The Chivalrous and Religious Order of the Crown of Thorns'' (OCT) (''{{lang|fr|L'Ordre Souverain, Chevaleresque, Nobilaire et Religieux de la Couronne d'Epines}}''), ''The Sovereign, Knightly and Noble Order of the Lion and the Black Cross'' (OLBC) (''{{lang|fr|L'Ordre Souverain, Chevaleresque, et Noble du Lion et de Croix Noire}}'' (OLCN)).

Louis-François Girardot and Vilatte originated a pair of {{abbr|OCT|Order of the Crown of Thorns}} groups. The two separately founded {{abbr|OCT|Order of the Crown of Thorns}} ''orders'' had the same name but different origins and were combined, although it is not clear what that meant. The San Luigi organization says that the orders were inspired by the ''{{lang|fr|Ordre du Genest}}'', founded by King [[Louis IX of France]], and also that "it is not asserted that there is a continuous and historically verifiable link between the present-day Order and these bodies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|location=London|publisher=Abbey-Principality of San Luigi|work=Orders|title=Statutes of the Order of the Crown of Thorns|url=http://san-luigi.org/orders/statutes-of-the-order-of-the-crown-of-thorns/|accessdate=2013-03-30|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FWGRqCgK?url=http://san-luigi.org/orders/statutes-of-the-order-of-the-crown-of-thorns/|archivedate=2013-03-31|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|location=Paris|publisher=Hachette et cie|encyclopedia=Dictionnaire historique des institutions, moeurs et coutumes de la France|language=French|year=1884|edition=6|volume=1|last=Chéreul|first=Pierre Adolphe|title=Chevalerie (Ordres de)|pages=147|url=https://archive.org/download/dictionnairehist01chre/dictionnairehist01chre.pdf|accessdate=2012-03-21|archiveurl=https://archive.org/details/dictionnairehist01chre|archivedate=2012-03-21|deadurl=no}} Also: {{cite encyclopedia|title=Genest ou Genêt (Ordre du)|page=485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two separate foundation stories for the {{abbr|OCT|Order of the Crown of Thorns}}; one in 1883, the other in 1891. These foundation stories were not believed by some during Vilatte's lifetime; Guénon wrote that "dignitaries of this Church have a mania for titles of nobility as others have for fantastic decorations; thus [... Vilatte] invented the 'Order of the Crown of Thorns'."&lt;ref name="Guenon2004"&gt;{{cite book|location=Hillsdale, NY|publisher=Sophia Perennis|last=Guénon|first=René|authorlink=René Guénon|others=translated by Alvin Moore, Jr.|title=Theosophy: History of a Pseudo-Religion|year=2004|origyear=First published 2003|isbn=0-900588-79-9|chapter=The Old Catholic Church|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7_WwVFntyFwC&amp;lpg=PA216}} Translation of {{cite book|location=Paris|publisher=Nouvelle librairie nationale|last=Guénon|first=René|authorlink=René Guénon|title=Le théosophisme: histoire d'une pseudo-religion|year=1921|language=French|oclc=|chapter=L'Église vieille-catholique|url=https://archive.org/download/lethosophismeh00gu/lethosophismeh00gu.pdf|accessdate=2013-06-26|archiveurl=https://archive.org/details/lethosophismeh00gu|archivedate=2010-10-14|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=216}} The organization acknowledges the lack of verifiable facts about the monastery but says that some documents were destroyed in a house fire in 1918 and other documents were seized by the Vatican in 1929 after Vilatte's death.&lt;ref name="SanLuigi3" /&gt;

===1883 foundation story===

The {{abbr|OCT|Order of the Crown of Thorns}} was reputedly founded in 1883. According to the San Luigi organization, after the [[French protectorate of Tunisia]] was established in 1881, France sought to colonize the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s [[Fezzan]] province as part of the [[Scramble for Africa]]. A small group of French and [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[Benedictine]] monks settled in [[Ghadames]] on {{date|1883-08-25|mdy}}. Ghadames society in the 1800s is described by Ulrich Harmann, in ''{{lang|de|Die Welt des Islams}}'', as a city with "customary law and administration" with "the norms" established and observed "by the assemblies of the various sub-tribes and codified in ittifaqat" and [[sharia]].&lt;ref name="Harmann1998"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The organization says that there is no documentation and that, "It is possible that some had been associated with the former [[Ligugé Abbey]], which had been closed in 1880 with most of the members of the community then moving to [[Abbey of Santo Domingo de Silos|Silos Abbey]] in [[Spain]]."&lt;ref name="SanLuigi3" /&gt; It is unclear if the monastery was a satellite of a mother [[abbey]], if it was ever considered stable enough and large enough to be elevated to the rank of an abbey, if they had the canonically required number of twelve monks to elect an [[abbot]], if his election received the approbation of their provincial prior, if after his ecclesiastical confirmation he received abbatial blessing from any bishop in communion with the Holy See, or even if any of their actions were sanctioned at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic|inline=1|volume=12|last=Ott|first=Michael|authorlink=|wstitle=Priory}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic|inline=1|volume=12|last=Ott|first=Michael|authorlink=|wstitle=Prior}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic|inline=1|volume=1|last=Oestereich|first=Thomas|authorlink=|wstitle=Abbot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the monks called their monastery the ''Abbey-Principality of San Luigi'' and they claimed sovereignty, as a [[theocracy]], over the surrounding secular territory. Disease was endemic; attempts to convert the local [[Muslim]] population to Catholicism were rejected; and in less than a year, on {{date|1884-08-02|mdy}}, the monastery was sacked and at least one monk was murdered. Five monks, including what the organization calls their third abbot, José Mendoza, survived and were exiled. Mendoza was somehow elected by less than the canonically required twelve monks. Without mentioning the [[Sahara]] and [[Sahel]] situated between Ghadames and the [[Sudd]], the organization says that the monks traveled across the Sudd and arrived in the Kingdom of [[Bunyoro]]-Kitara on {{date|1885-03-15|mdy}}. There, the organization says, [[Omukama of Bunyoro|Omukama]] [[Kabarega of Bunyoro]] granted territory to the monks to settle and establish a monastery. The organization says that Kabarega conferred a title, Mukungu of the Chieftainship of the Ancient Abbey-Principality of San Luigi, upon Mendoza. In 1888, all the monks, except for Mendoza, died from an epidemic; Mendoza abandoned the monastery in Bunyoro and returned to Europe. The organization says that "legalization by a French government official established the recognition of the Abbey-Principality by the French state"{{elucidate|reason=What does legalization mean in this context? Is it notarizing something? Is it recording something in a logbook? Is it registering a name?|date=May 2013}} when [[Mayor]] Eugène Clairet of [[Seine-Port]] in [[Île-de-France]], was apparently involved in some way with some type of transfer of titles from Mendoza to Girardot.&lt;ref name="SanLuigi3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SanLuigi1"&gt;{{cite web|location=London|publisher=Abbey-Principality of San Luigi|work=History|title=Part 1&amp;nbsp;– Fezzan, Bunyoro and the pre-Vilatte era|url=http://san-luigi.org/history/|accessdate=2013-03-23|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FLMwEMQ6?url=http://san-luigi.org/history/|archivedate=2013-03-23|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On {{date|1899-05-07|mdy}}, Girardot transferred those Mendoza titles to Vilatte, with Clairet somehow involved again.&lt;ref name="SanLuigi2"&gt;{{cite web|location=London|publisher=Abbey-Principality of San Luigi|work=History|title=Part 2&amp;nbsp;– The Vilatte era and beyond|url=http://san-luigi.org/history/history-part-2/|accessdate=2013-03-23|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FLNKjlBz?url=http://san-luigi.org/history/history-part-2/|archivedate=2013-03-23|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization says that the monastery, of at least seven monks, "was constitutionally independent as a theocratic state" and a "colonising power" under which "the local population had no political rights whatsoever" and "were to be subjugated under the absolute rule" of the monastery.&lt;ref name="SanLuigi3" /&gt; The organization confers reputed titles of nobility&lt;ref name="SanLuigi2" /&gt; The organization also describes itself as an Old Catholic church.&lt;ref name="SanLuigi4"&gt;{{cite web|location=London|publisher=Abbey-Principality of San Luigi|work=Ecclesia|title=The Ecclesial Jurisdiction of San Luigi|url=http://san-luigi.org/ecclesia/the-ecclesial-jurisdiction-of-san-luigi/|accessdate=19 April 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FzzJ2V3w?url=http://san-luigi.org/ecclesia/the-ecclesial-jurisdiction-of-san-luigi/|archivedate=19 April 2013|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization believes itself to be the legitimate ''[[de jure]]'' government-in-exile of its former territory in the Fezzan. "The Abbey-Principality aims ultimately to secure the territorial restoration of the original Abbey-Principality in Libya, but is aware that political and related considerations are likely to preclude this objective for the time being".&lt;ref name="SanLuigi3" /&gt; The organization also believes that it is also theoretically empowered to open embassies although it has not done so as yet.&lt;ref name="SanLuigi3" /&gt;

"Protection is an attribute of Sovereignty, which none of these Sees actually posses," according to the {{abbr|ICOC|International Commission on Orders of Chivalry}}.&lt;ref name="ICOC" /&gt; Ignatius Peter IV intended this order, according to Paul Schultz's 1977 pamphlet about the history of the group, to be like the [[Knights of Columbus]].&lt;ref&gt;

Valensi deceived many people. ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' described how the town of [[Lille]] had been "hoaxed in the most complete and amusing manner" by Valensi and two accomplices, who duped the authorities into thinking that they were Moorish notables. Valensi advertised the visit of [[Qaid|Kaid]] Said Garda to Lille, described as a representative of the [[Sultan of Morocco]]. The Kaid and another "Moorish official" appeared, each wearing a [[burnous]], and with them Valensi, in a red [[fez (hat)|fez]]. They were received at the railway station by the local authorities and a number of Lille adherents of the "Order of the Golden Crescent of Morocco". The affair created great excitement in the town. At Valensi's hotel the [[Flag of Morocco]] was flown from the balcony. Speeches were made at a banquet by the Kaid in broken French and Valensi, and subsequently a number of decorations were distributed. The prefect of police in the town was nominated an officer of the "Golden Cross of Italy". Some well-known politicians were implicated in the scandal.&lt;ref name="NewZealandHerald1911-06-03" /&gt; It was revealed during the trial, that while in Lille, "the 'ambassadors' invited a couple of ladies whose language and gestures were so highly Parisian that the effect of the 'Mission' was spoilt. This story made everyone in Court laugh [...]" according to ''The North-China Herald and Supreme Court &amp; Consular Gazette''.&lt;ref name="NCH1912-08-17" /&gt;

Vilatte was also implicated in the Valensi affair by being identified as the Marie Timothée of the Principality of San Luigi, whose signature appeared on diplomas of the Order of the Lion and the Black Cross trafficked by Valensi, who was described as a propagator of honorary and bizarre distinctions.&lt;ref name="LaCroix1911-05-16"&gt;{{cite news|location=Paris|newspaper=La Croix|issn=0242-6412|language=French|date=1911-05-16|page=1|title=La vertu récompensée|trans-title=The virtue rewarded|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k257996p/f1|accessdate=2013-10-04|quote={{lang|fr|Marie-Timothée, Archevêque, Prince-Grand Maître des Ordres de la Couronne d'Epines, du Lion et de la Croix-Noire de l'Ex-Abbaye-Principautè de San-Luigi}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vilatte responded to ''{{lang|fr|Le Catholique Français}}'' article, based on ''{{lang|fr|Le Matin}}''{{'}}s article, about the diploma by stating that the story discredited him by incorrectly identifying him as the signatory. He declared that he had nothing to do with the published diploma, with Valensi, or with the Order of the Lion and the Black Cross and that his authentic {{abbr|OCT|Order of the Crown of Thorns}} had nothing in common with the diploma from the Principality of San Luigi. "I do not bear the title of Marie Timothée, much less that of Prince, Grand Master of the Order of the Lion and the Black Cross", asserted Vilatte. He wrote that he never signed any document as Marie Timothée or Mar Timothée and made clear that he was given the religious name of Mar Timothéus I and not Marie Timothée.&lt;ref name="LeCatholiqueFrancais1911"&gt;{{cite news|location=Paris|newspaper=Le catholique français: organe de l'église catholique gallicane|language=French|oclc=420108020|volume=[volume unknown]|issue=[issue unknown]|year=1911|pages=105–106

Neither ''{{lang|fr|La Croix}}'' nor ''{{lang|fr|Le Matin}}'' mentioned the name "Vilatte" or "Timothéus"; the diploma, which was printed in both ''{{lang|fr|La Croix}}'' and ''{{lang|fr|Le Matin}}'', also did not mention the name "Vilatte" or "Timothéus".&lt;ref name="LaCroix1911-05-16" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LeMatin1911-05-15"&gt;{{cite news|location=Paris|newspaper=Le Matin|issn=1256-0359|date=1911-05-15|page=2|title=Pour célébrer les vertus de l'amie de Valensi|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k569794q/f2.image|accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''{{lang|fr|Le Catholique Français}}'' asked Vilatte about the identity of the Mar Timothée, diploma signatory, but he did not respond.&lt;ref name="LeCatholiqueFrancais1911" /&gt;{{rp|page=106}}

In 1913 ''{{lang|fr|La Revue critique des idées et des livres}}'' printed an article about the Valensi affair based on [[Maurice Pujo]]'s ''{{lang|fr|Pourquoi l'on a étouffé l'affaire Valensi}}''.&lt;ref name="LaRevueCritique1913"&gt;{{cite journal|location=Paris|publisher=Nouvelle librairie nationale|journal=La revue critique des idées et des livres|language=French|issn=2017-6775|volume=20|issue=114|date=1913-01-13|pages=80–91|last=P.

E. Deyber. Brassard was a wine merchant, a [[Radical Party (France)|Radical Party]] executive committee delegate affiliated with Freemasonry and director of {{lang|fr|l'Agence spéciale parisienne}}.&lt;ref name="LaRevueCritique1913" /&gt;{{rp|pages=81–82}} Deyber was a dismissed {{lang|fr|Sûreté Générale}} Police Commissioner.&lt;ref name="LaRevueCritique1913" /&gt;{{rp|page=82}}

Brassard and Deyber, added Pujo, provided houses for white slave trade and prostitution.&lt;ref name="LaRevueCritique1913" /&gt;{{rp|page=83}}

Pujo listed eight societies which mushroomed from Brassard's conglomerate or Republican policy as:
*National League for Civic Education (''{{lang|fr|la Ligue nationale d'Education civique}}''),&lt;ref name="LaRevueCritique1913" /&gt;{{rp|page=85}}

Pujo included an excerpt from a letter written by Collet, secretary of most Brassard companies, to Adolphe Brézet, "president of the Free State of Counani", stated that Brézet would receive, among several blank diplomas sent to him, a blank "officer of San Luigi" diploma.&lt;ref name="LaRevueCritique1913" /&gt;{{rp|page=86}}

==Condemnation by the Catholic Church==
The Holy See had stated twice, first in 1953 and again in 1970, that it does not recognize either of the orders.&lt;ref name="SanLuigi3" /&gt; [[Guy Stair Sainty]] wrote that an "increasing number of such bodies" troubled the Holy See which "issued statements condemning such 'Orders'" in 1935, 1953, 1970 and 1976. He noted that the "most complete recent condemnation" was included in ''Orders of Knighthood, Awards and the Holy See'', by Archbishop [[Igino Eugenio Cardinale]].&lt;ref name="Sainty"&gt;{{cite web|location=|publisher=|work=

While they "[[self-proclaimed|style themselves]] as autonomous," these "private initiatives" qualify their names, according to the statement, with terms "which belong exclusively to authentic Orders duly approved by the Holy See" but are used by these "private initiatives" to "increase the confusion of those who are not aware of the true history of Orders of Knighthood and of their juridical condition." For example, "these alleged Orders claim for themselves [...] such titles as [...] Chivalric, [...] Sovereign, Nobiliary, Religious, [...]" "Among these private initiatives, which in no way are approved of or recognized by the Holy See, one can find alleged Orders such as" ''Saint John the Baptist'', ''The Crown of Thorns'' and ''Lion of the Black Cross''.&lt;ref name="Cardinale1985" /&gt;{{rp|page=232}} The statement explains that, "to avoid equivocations [...] because of the abuse of pontifical and ecclesiastical documents, [...] and to put an end to the continuation of such abuses, entaling harmful consequences for people in good faith, we [...] declare that the Holy See does not recognize the value of the certificates and insignia conferred to the above-named alleged Orders."&lt;ref name="Cardinale1985" /&gt;{{rp|page=233}} According to the {{abbr|ICOC|International Commission on Orders of Chivalry}}, the "only recognised order with the style of 'Sovereign' existing nowadays" is the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] and "whose international diplomatic 'status' as an independent non-territorial power is recognised officially by the Holy See and by many other Governments."&lt;ref name="ICOC" /&gt;

According to [[Robert Gayre]] these "Orders" are "clearly recent creations grafted on to old traditions. Such fantasies are not Orders of chivalry no matter how they may ape chivalric insignia and styles."&lt;ref&gt;''The knightly twilight'',Robert Gayre, Lochore Enterprises Valletta 1973, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nikita Khrusjtsjov.jpg|thumb|Nikita Khrushchev (1961)]]
'''"We will bury you!"''' ({{lang-ru|«Мы вас похороним!»|translit="My vas pokhoronim!"}}) is a phrase that was used by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|First Secretary]] [[Nikita Khrushchev]]  while addressing Western ambassadors at a reception at the [[Embassy of Poland in Moscow|Polish embassy in Moscow]] on November 18, 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,867329,00.html "We Will Bury You!"], ''[[Time Magazine]]'', November 26, 1956&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Khrushchev Tirade Again Irks Envoys", ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 19, 1956, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="quote"&gt;The quote, cited on [http://www.bartleby.com/63/83/183.html Bartleby.com] and  [http://www.quotationspage.com/quotes/Nikita_Khrushchev/ QuotationsPage.com].&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was originally translated into English by Khrushchev's personal interpreter [[Viktor Sukhodrev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.kp.ru/online/news/1737040/| script-title=ru:Умер личный переводчик Хрущева и Брежнева Виктор Суходрев|publisher =''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]''| language=Russian|accessdate =May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
While addressing [[Western World|Westerners]] at the embassy on November 18, 1956, in the presence of [[Polish United Workers' Party|Polish Communist]] statesman [[Władysław Gomułka]], First Secretary Khrushchev said: "About the [[capitalist state]]s, it doesn't depend on you whether or not we exist. If you don't like us, don't accept our invitations, and don't invite us to come to see you. Whether you like it or not, history is on our side. We will bury you!"&lt;ref name="MS"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&amp;dat=19561119&amp;id=HWtQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gBAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6057,4980504&amp;hl=ru |title=Envoys Stalk Again As Nikita Rants|work=[[The Milwaukee Sentinel]]| date=Nov 19, 1956| accessdate =April 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speech prompted the envoys from twelve [[NATO]] nations and Israel to leave the room.&lt;ref name="MS"/&gt;

During [[1959 Khrushchev visit to the United States|Khrushchev's visit to the United States]] in 1959, the Los Angeles mayor [[Norris Poulson]] in his address to Khrushchev stated: "We do not agree with your widely quoted phrase 'We shall bury you.' You shall not bury us and we shall not bury you. We are happy with our way of life. We recognize its shortcomings and are always trying to improve it. But if challenged, we shall fight to the death to preserve it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.lawac.org/About-Us/LAWAC-History |title=Founding and history|publisher=[[Los Angeles World Affairs Council]]|accessdate =November 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Americans meanwhile interpreted Khrushchev's quote as a [[nuclear weapons|nuclear threat]].&lt;ref&gt;James Stuart Olson, ''Historical dictionary of the 1950s'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2000, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

In another public speech Khrushchev declared: "[...] We must take a shovel and dig a deep grave, and bury [[colonialism]] as deep as we can".&lt;ref&gt;Nikita Sergeevich Khrushchev, Sergeĭ Khrushchev, George Shriver, Stephen Shenfield. ''Memoirs of Nikita Khrushchev: Statesman, 1953–1964'', Penn State Press, 2007, p. 893&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1961 speech at the [[Institute of Marxism–Leninism]] in Moscow, Khrushchev said, that "[[peaceful coexistence]]" for the Soviet Union means "intense, economic, political and ideological struggle between the [[proletariat]] and the aggressive forces of [[imperialism]] in the world arena".&lt;ref name="birkby"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.aulibrary.au.edu/multim1/ABAC_Pub/Galaxy-The-English-Department-Journal/n2-6-2013.pdf|title='We will bury you' How Mistranslation Heightened Cold War Tensions|work=Galaxy|author=Dr. Stuart J. Birkby| accessdate =April 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, on August 24, 1963, Khrushchev remarked in his speech in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], "I once said, 'We will bury you,' and I got into trouble with it. Of course we will not bury you with a shovel. Your own [[working class]] will bury you,"&lt;ref name="kh-explanation"&gt;[http://www.quotationspage.com/quotes/Nikita_Khrushchev/ Nikita Khrushchev] on QuotationsPage.com&lt;/ref&gt; a reference to the [[Marxist]] saying, "The proletariat is the undertaker of [[capitalism]]", based on the concluding statement in Chapter 1 of  the ''[[Communist Manifesto]]'': "What the [[bourgeoisie]] therefore produces, above all, are its own grave-diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable". In his memoirs, Khrushchev stated that "enemy propaganda picked up the slogan and blew it all out of proportion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Arnold Beichman| title =The Long Pretense: Soviet Treaty Diplomacy from Lenin to Gorbachev| publisher =Transaction Publishers|page =96| isbn =1412837685}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors suggest that an alternative translation is "We shall be present at your funeral" or "We shall outlive you".&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Lewin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ETQpY-32DysC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;dq=%22we+shall+outlive+you%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rBmUU5mPIevJsQSz64LADg&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22we%20shall%20outlive%20you%22&amp;f=false The Soviet Century]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bill Swainson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Af84fBmzmVYC&amp;pg=PA518&amp;dq=%22we+shall+outlive+you%22+bury&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FRqUU9v_DIqlsQSxroBo&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22we%20shall%20outlive%20you%22%20bury&amp;f=false The Encarta Book of Quotations]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Legvold, [https://books.google.com/books?id=e8j0uy37Wg8C&amp;pg=PT256&amp;dq=%22We+shall+be+present+at+your+funeral%22+bury&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ihqUU4qzAbLFsAS8qYGYBQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22We%20shall%20be%20present%20at%20your%20funeral%22%20bury&amp;f=false Russian Foreign Policy in the Twenty-first Century and the Shadow of the Past]&lt;/ref&gt; Authors have suggested the phrase, in conjunction with Khrushchev's overhead hand clasp gesture meant that Russia would take care of the funeral arrangements for capitalism after its demise.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Handbook of Conflict Resolution: Theory and Practice|editors=[[Morton Deutsch]], [[Peter T. Coleman (academic)|Peter T. Coleman]], Eric C. Marcus|chapter=Culture and Conflict|publisher=Wiley|year=2011|isbn=9781118046906|p=630|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rw61VDID7U4C&amp;pg=PA630}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2018, translator Mark Polizzotti suggested that the phrase was mistranslated at the time and should properly have been translated as "We will outlast you," which gives an entirely different sense to Khrushchev's statement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/28/opinion/sunday/why-mistranslation-matters.html  "Why Mistranslation Matters; Would history have been different if Khrushchev had used a better interpreter? by Mark Polizzotti, New York Times, July 28, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

First Secretary Khrushchev was known for his emotional public image. His daughter admitted that "he was known for strong language, interrupting speakers, banging his fists on the table in protest, pounding his feet, even whistling".&lt;ref name="birkby"/&gt; She called such behavior a "manner, which suited his goal... to be different from the hypocrites of the West, with their appropriate words but calculated deeds".&lt;ref name="birkby"/&gt; [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] suggested in his book ''Perestroika and New Thinking for our Country and the World'' that the image used by Khrushchev was inspired by the acute discussions among Soviet [[agrarian scientist]]s in the 1930s, nicknamed "who will bury whom", the bitterness of which must be understood in the [[Politics of the Soviet Union|political context]] of the times.

==In popular culture==
* Khrushchev's phrase was used as the title of [[Jan Šejna]]'s book on communist [[Cold War]] strategies and of a [[We Will Bury You (comics)|comic book]].
* The phrase also appears in [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]'s song "[[Russians (song)|Russians]]".
* It provided the title to a 1962 documentary ''We'll Bury You'' released by Columbia Pictures.
* The quote, paraphrased as "We will bury them!", was used as a taunt in the video game ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/476890-command-and-conquer-red-alert-2-yuris-revenge/faqs/20018|title=Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2 – Yuri's Revenge|publisher=[[GameFAQs]]| accessdate =November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Soviet Union wages [[World War III]] against the Western Allies.
* This event inspired a card&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://twilightstrategy.com/2012/10/10/we-will-bury-you/|title=We Will Bury You}}&lt;/ref&gt; in favor of the U.S.S.R. in the Cold War themed boardgame [[Twilight Struggle]].
* In issue #12 of Brian K. Vaughan's "Y: The Last Man," a Russian character shouts the phrase when she believes she's being attacked by enemies.
* This is also referenced by a worm in the ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' episode entitled "Rock-a-Bye Bivalve"
* In the 2017 film ''[[The Death of Stalin]]'', Khrushchev shortly after [[Lavrentiy Beria|Beria]]'s execution delivers a similar statement to the later speech by telling his corpse that he'll bury Beria in history.

==Background==
[[File:Tupoutoʻa ʻUlukalala and Sinaitakala Fakafanua.jpg|thumb|Ulukalala and Fakafanua at an Asia Pacific event in London in 2012.]]
Tupouto'a 'Ulukalala became Crown Prince of [[Tonga]] and first in line in royal succession in March 2012 following the death of King [[George Tupou V]] and the ascension of [[Tupou VI]] to the throne.&lt;ref name=rnzi/&gt; The wedding ceremony marked the end of Tonga's one-hundred-day mourning period marking the death of George Tupou V, who died in March.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; The Crown Prince is the son of Tupou VI and the nephew of the late King George Tupou V.&lt;ref name=tvnz2/&gt;

All royal marriages in Tonga are arranged.&lt;ref name=stuff&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title= Tongan Queen Mother absent from wedding |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/south-pacific/7271036/Tongan-Queen-Mother-absent-from-royal-wedding |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |publisher=|date=12 July 2012 |accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Tongan [[royal protocol]] and tradition, members of the royal family may only marry members of Tongan nobility to maintain the royal [[bloodline]].&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;&lt;ref name=rnzi2&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title= Upcoming Tongan royal wedding of cousins prompts controversy |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=69394 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |publisher=|date=8 July 2012 |accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bride, Sinaitakala Fakafanua, is also a member of the royal family and 26th person in the [[line of succession]] to inherit the throne.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

Queen [[Nanasipau'u Tuku'aho]], the wife of the current king, personally arranged the marriage between Crown Prince Tupouto'a 'Ulukalala and Sinaitakala Fakafanua.&lt;ref name=stuff2&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Field|title=Holiday for royal grandchildren wedding in Tonga  |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/south-pacific/7241818/Holiday-for-royal-grandchildren-wedding-in-Tonga |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |publisher=|date=8 July 2012 |accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The queen pushed for a July wedding, even though the royal family must continue to wear black until February 2013 to mark George Tupou V's death.&lt;ref name=stuff2/&gt; The queen's arrangement was opposed by her husband, King Tupou VI, who questioned whether it was appropriate for second cousins to marry.&lt;ref name=stuff2/&gt;

The Prince was 27 years old at the time of the 2012 wedding, while the bride was 25 years old.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

==Ceremony==
Earlier in the week, a Ma'utohi ceremony was held to mark the issuance of their marriage license.&lt;ref name=rnzi/&gt; The Ma'utohi was followed by a reception, held at Fakafanua's home.&lt;ref name=rnzi/&gt;

The [[wedding ceremony]] was held at the Centenary Church of the [[Free Wesleyan Church of Tonga]] in [[Nuku'alofa]] on 12 July 2012.&lt;ref name=rnzi/&gt; Tupouto'a 'Ulukalala became the first Crown Prince to marry in sixty-five years. The groom wore grey and black [[morning dress]], while the bride wore a long sleeve, [[lace]] [[wedding gown]] with a [[Wedding veil|veil]] that reached the floor of the church.&lt;ref name=tvnz/&gt;

More than 2,000 guests attended the ceremony, including chiefly families from [[Samoa]] and [[Fiji]].&lt;ref name=rnzi/&gt; Noticeably absent from the ceremony were [[Queen Mother]] [[Halaevalu Mataʻaho ʻAhomeʻe]] and her daughter ([[Tupou VI|king's]] sister), [[Salote Mafile'o Pilolevu Tuita|Princess Pilolevu]], who disapproved of the marriage.&lt;ref name=stuff/&gt;

Members of the international media visiting Tonga to cover the wedding were given detailed instructions on how to behave during the ceremony. Photography was banned in sacred areas, with the government warning that it would confiscate or delete any photos taken in prohibited places.&lt;ref name=stuff2/&gt; Photographers were asked to sit on the ground and "stand up quickly" to take a photo before sitting back down.&lt;ref name=stuff2/&gt; Female journalists could not wear sleeveless dresses or shirts and men were to wear suits and ties.&lt;ref name=stuff2/&gt; Umbrellas, hats, and sunglasses were banned throughout the wedding, while gum, food and drinks were not allowed at the [[Royal Palace, Tonga|Tongan Royal Palace]].&lt;ref name=stuff2/&gt;

==Controversy==
The marriage between the Crown Prince and Fakafanua caused much controversy over the practice of marrying closely related cousins.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;&lt;ref name=tvnz/&gt; The two of them are [[Cousin#Additional terms|double second cousins]] (that is, Fakafanua's father and mother are each the first cousin of the prince's father).&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;&lt;ref name=tvnz2&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title= Tongan royals to wed as nation struggles with economic crisis |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/world-news/royal-wedding-comes-tonga-struggles-economic-crisis-4963710 |work=[[One News (New Zealand)|One News]] |publisher=[[TVNZ]] |date=10 July 2012 |accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wedding between the cousins was openly criticised by members of Tongan political and royal circles.&lt;ref name=tvnz/&gt; A leader of New Zealand's Tongan community noted that there is no word for cousin in the [[Tongan language]]; cousins are considered and called "brother" or "sister", which reinforces the controversy among ordinary [[Tongan people|Tongans]].&lt;ref name=ra/&gt;

According to royal sources, [[King Tupou VI]] opposed the marriage due to their close relations and made his disapproval known to members of the royal family.&lt;ref name=stuff2/&gt;&lt;ref name=ra/&gt; (The king's wife, Queen [[Nanasipau'u Tuku'aho|Nanasipau'u]], had arranged the royal wedding.)&lt;ref name=stuff2/&gt; Two prominent members of the Tongan royal family, [[Queen Mother]] [[Halaevalu Mataʻaho ʻAhomeʻe]] and the [[Tupou VI|king's]] sister, [[Salote Mafile'o Pilolevu Tuita|Princess Pilolevu]] refused to attend the ceremony.&lt;ref name=stuff/&gt; Daughter of Princess Pilolevu, Hon. Frederica Tuita, who is ninth in line to the throne, openly condemned the union, calling the royal [[arranged marriage]] "extremely arrogant and only perpetuated the motive behind social climbers."&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

Political figures and members of the Tongan community also weighed in on the controversy. [[Pro-democracy]] leader [['Akilisi Pohiva]] criticised the wedding, telling [[TVNZ]], "They are too close...I do not know about biological effects of two close bloods mixed together, but I think they need new blood from outside."&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; A leader of Tongans living in [[New Zealand]], [[Will Ilolahia]], stated that many Tongans opposed the second cousins' marriage, but were unwilling to speak out publicly.&lt;ref name=ra&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title= Opposition to Tongan royal cousins marriage |url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/radio/program/pacific-beat/opposition-to-tongan-royal-cousins-marriage/977288 |work=[[Radio Australia]] |publisher=|date=11 July 2012 |accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speculation also centred on possible [[genetic disorder]]s that may result from a marriage of two close relatives.&lt;ref name=tvnz2/&gt;&lt;ref name=ra/&gt;

[[ʻAlipate Tuʻivanuavou Vaea|Lord Vaea]], an uncle of the Crown Prince, defended the marriage saying, "It's a new beginning for the royal household. They are both in their 20s, we are looking at that to preserve that [[constitutional monarchy]] within Tonga."&lt;ref name=stuff/&gt; A New Zealand geneticist noted that there is "only a slight risk" of genetic disorders for the offspring of cousins who marry.&lt;ref name=stuff3&gt;{{cite news|first=Anna|last=Turner|title= 'Only slight risk' in cousins marrying |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/7245220/Only-slight-risk-in-cousins-marrying |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |publisher=|date=9 July 2012 |accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the controversy over royal genetics, the wedding took place amid economic and political uncertainty.&lt;ref name=tvnz2/&gt; Tonga was projected to have the slowest economic growth in the Pacific Islands region during 2012.&lt;ref name=tvnz2/&gt; The royal family agreed to pay for the costs of the wedding; past weddings had been covered by the Tongan government.&lt;ref name=tvnz2/&gt; The government of Tonga may also face a potential vote of [[no confidence]] in the week following the wedding, adding to the country's political and economic woes.&lt;ref name=tvnz2/&gt;

[[File:Sekttag 1805.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|First page of the manifesto printed for the "Sekttag" of 1805]]
The '''Internationaler Sekttag''', '''Weltsekttag''' or '''Sekttag''' is celebrated on '''9 April''', occasionally also upon other days, mainly amongst German-speaking students and members of [[German Student Corps]] and [[Studentenverbindung]]en in general.

The tradition of the '''Weltsekttag''' was founded in the short interim period separating the wars of the Second and Third Coalition, and was initiated amongst others by the German poet [[Ludwig Achim von Arnim]] as a sign of unity against the tyranny of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].

== History ==

=== The Sekttag of 1805 ===
[[File:Ludwig Achim von Arnim.jpg|thumb|Achim von Arnim as a student in the year 1804.]]

German student and poet [[Ludwig Börne|Carl Ludwig Börne]] was the first to propose the celebration of a ''Weltsekttag'' during an academic conference held at [[Gießen]] upon the 4th of March 1805, without favouring a particular date, however. The idea was inspired by attempts in the previous years by French vintners to initiate collective day of marked resistance to the coalition wars and the resulting economic conditions which had had a strongly negative effect upon the wine trade. These attempts were largely unsuccessful. Ludwig Achim von Arnim brought the idea to [[Halle an der Saale]], one of the oldest and most important German universities and a centre of the literary movement of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in the late 18th and early 19th century, where it was picked up by academic "Kränzchen" ("little circles") and "Convente" ("conventions") of similar corporations.

While it was the poet [[Ludwig Achim von Arnim]] who carried the original idea to Halle, it were the German poets Ludwig Börne and [[Clemens Brentano]] who were responsible for the foundation of the actual tradition of the fixed ''Sekttag'' during the 1805 conference of Gießen, where the decision was accepted.

The ''Beschluss'' (decision) of Gießen read as follows:

{{Quote|Im Einvernehmen mit den politischen und freiheitlichen Organisationen der Studenten in ihrem Lande veranstalten die der Freiheit liebenden Sektgenießer aller Länder jedes Jahr einen Sekttag, oder mehrere, der in erster Linie der Agitation gegen den französischen Tyrannen dient. […] Der Sekttag muß einen Charakter tragen der alle Menschen und Völker repräsentirt und ist sorgfältig vorzubereiten.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Wilhelm: ''Die Beschlüsse von Gießen 1805 im Kontext der Koalitionskriege'', S. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|''In accordance with the political and free organizations of the [[student]]s in their respective [[States of Germany|countries]] the freedom-loving enjoyers of good wine will celebrate yearly a Sekttag as an open sign of protest and agitation against the [[Napoleon Bonaparte|French tyrant]]. […] The ''Sekttag'' must represent in its character all men and all peoples and must be prepared with the greatest care.''}}

The first Sekttag was subsequently celebrated upon the 9th of April 1805 in [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]]. The choice of the date was intended to symbolically represent and underline the happy and open-minded character of the Sekttag.

== Situation today ==
Today, more than 200 years after the original celebrations, students gather yearly upon the 9th of April (and also occasionally upon other days, varying from university city to university city) either under more organized forms of tradition or in less formal gatherings, to drink sparkling wine and honour the memory of the great poets and students. Academic drawings and paintings from the first half of the 19th century not rarely depicts a drinking student who stands upon a table with a glass in his hand, which is a telling reference to the popularity which the tradition would soon come to enjoy. Achim von Arnims immortal "Sektlied" is still sung around the world by German-speaking celebrants:

: ''Schafft her den Sekt! - Ein brav Student''
: ''Zecht fest bis er verreckt''
: ''Voll bis zum Rand, doch eloquent''
: ''Den Vollrausch er bezweckt!''

: ''So stürmen wir mit Saus und Braus''
: ''In die verlog'ne Welt hinaus''
: ''Und wer da bleibt allein zuhaus''
: ''Den holen wir beim Teufel raus!''

: ''Vivallera! Vivallera!''

The '''World Wrestling Peace Festival''' was a [[professional wrestling]] [[supercard]] produced by [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[professional wrestler]] [[Antonio Inoki]], which took place on June&amp;nbsp;1, 1996 at the [[Los Angeles Sports Arena]] in [[Los Angeles, California]]. The event was organized by Inoki to promote [[world peace]] with an interpromotional event involving major promotions from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.puroresu.com/history/?decade=1990s#1996 |title=1990s: 1996 |author= |work=History of Puroresu |publisher=Puroresu.com |accessdate=May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty wrestlers from six countries ended up taking part in the event.&lt;ref name="PT"&gt;{{cite news |title=WRESTLING FANS MEET IN NAME OF PEACE |author=Monteagudo, Luis |newspaper=[[Press-Telegram]] |date=June 1, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inoki's home promotion [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW), as well as smaller independent groups, represented Japan, while [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) and the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) took part on behalf of the United States. The [[World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) and [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) were the only major promotions in North America not to participate in the show although this was not unexpected given their tense relationships with WCW during the [[Monday Night Wars]]. Both of Mexico's top promotions [[Asistencia Asesoría y Administración]] (AAA) and [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) participated in the event, which was considered unlikely by many in the industry given their own heated rivalry.&lt;ref name="PWI"&gt;Rosenbaum, Dave. "Multi-Promotional Supercard! World Wrestling Peace Festival Unites The World!." ''[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]]''. Fort Washington, Pennsylvania: London Publishing Company. (November 1996): pg. 26–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Card (sports)#Main event|main attraction]] on the event [[Card (sports)|card]] was a [[tag team]] match with Antonio Inoki and [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|NWA World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Dan Severn]] wrestling [[Yoshiaki Fujiwara]] and [[Oleg Taktarov]]. Inoki and Severn won the match when Severn pinned Fujiwara with a [[keylock]]. One of the featured bouts on the [[Card (sports)|undercard]] was a title match between [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship|WCW World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Big Show|The Giant]] and [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]], which The Giant won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/bigshow.html |title=The Big Show |author=Milner, John M. |author2=Richard Kamchen  |date=October 6, 2004  |work=SLAM!

Wrestling Bios |publisher=[[Canoe.ca|SLAM! Sports]] |accessdate=May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a tag team match pitting [[Perro Aguayo]] and [[La Parka]] against [[Pierroth Jr.]] and [[Cibernetico]].

The event had an attendance of 5,964, far less than the 17,000 promoters were expecting, which was attributed to a poor choice of venue and lack of advertising. Though not as financially successful as Inoki's ''[[Collision in Korea]]'' show the previous year, he was widely praised for his efforts. This was the first-ever wrestling show that Inoki promoted in the United States. The event, which also helped raise money for [[high school wrestling|wrestling]] and [[judo]] programs in [[Los Angeles Unified School District|Los Angeles-area high schools]], was supported by then [[Los Angeles Mayor]] [[Richard Riordan]] and [[Los Angeles County Supervisor]] [[Michael D. Antonovich]].&lt;ref name="PT"/&gt; A few days before the show, Inoki was made honorary [[chief of police]] of [[Little Tokyo, Los Angeles|Little Tokyo]]. At the show's conclusion, Inoki was also awarded a special "PWI Lifetime Achievement Award" by ''[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]]'' [[senior editor]] [[Bill Apter]].&lt;ref name="PWI"/&gt;

In addition, it received positive reviews from publications such as ''Pro Wrestling Illustrated'' and the ''[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]''. This was supported by the [[internet wrestling community]] when it was released on DVD, albeit without matches featuring WCW wrestlers, years later. Arnold Furious of the professional wrestling section of [[411mania.com]] rated the event a 7.0 out of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/video_reviews/61849 |title=The Furious Flashbacks&amp;nbsp;– World Wrestling Peace Festival 1996 |author=Furious, Arnold |date=December 10, 2007 |work=Video Reviews |publisher=411mania.com |accessdate=May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review, Kevin Wilson of PuroresuCentral.com called Inoki's Peace Festival "probably the biggest show to ever take place in America" featuring international talent and that "the majority of the matches were good and a few were near excellent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.puroresucentral.com/OtherPeaceFestival.html |title=World Wrestling Peace Festival 1996 |author= |work=Special Event Reviews |publisher=PuroresuCentral.com |accessdate=May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show is credited, along with AAA's ''[[AAA When Worlds Collide|When Worlds Collide]]'' show two years earlier, with helping introduce [[lucha libre]] to mainstream American wrestling fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lucharan.tripod.com/wwc.htm |title=Cuando Los Mundos Chocan |author= |work=When Worlds Collide |publisher=Lucharan.com |accessdate=May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Bischoff]], who appeared with representatives from AAA and CMLL to open the show, later brought [[Rey Misterio Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Jeremy and [[Rey Mysterio Jr.]].

[[Terry Funk]] was scheduled to face [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]] and [[Brian Pillman]] in a three-way match, but pulled out of the show on May 8 after Pillman was sidelined following an automobile accident and Sabu was removed from the show after being booked for [[Big Japan Pro Wrestling]] (BJW) on the same date.

==Plot==
When [[Huckleberry Hound]] and his friends [[Hokey Wolf]], [[Snagglepuss]], [[Quick Draw McGraw]], [[Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy]], and [[Snooper and Blabber]] visit Jellystone Park for Christmas, they discover Yogi Bear and [[Boo-Boo Bear|Boo-Boo]] have escaped from Jellystone and hidden out in a department store, where Yogi is posing as a Santa Claus. Along the way, he helps a little girl named Judy Jones rediscover her faith in Christmas when her father, a billionaire named J. Wellington Jones, is too busy for her. Yogi says that many parents have to work hard to support their kids, and since her father is not home, Yogi and Boo-Boo propose escorting Judy through the city to bring her to her dad.&lt;ref name="BCDB"/&gt; Ranger Smith and the others look for Yogi when they learn he and Boo-Boo are in the city. Yogi reunites with his friends, who help to look for Judy's father. 

In his search, [[Snagglepuss]] encounters [[Fred Flintstone]] and [[Barney Rubble]] as [[Street Santas]], who tell him to ask a passing lady his question. When the old lady screams in fear of Snagglepuss, Fred and Barney attack him, claiming it to be an entertainment purpose. Snooper and Blabber go to the police. Quick Draw has no luck, as [[Pixie and Dixie and Mr. Jinks|Mr. Jinks]] hasn't seen Mr. Jones; Pixie and Dixie leave a present for Mr. Jinks (which contains a bulldog). [[Magilla Gorilla]], [[Wally Gator]], and [[Yakky Doodle]] haven't seen Mr. Jones either, and since Yogi hasn't had any luck locating her dad's office, they take Judy to Jellystone to try to figure out a plan there. At Judy's home, J. Wellington Jones is troubled when his daughter isn't there, so he calls the police to help find her. Also working with the police is Ranger Smith, who is looking for Yogi and Boo-Boo. The police are at the department store where Judy was last seen, and [[interrogation|interrogate]] all the men who work as Santas. When they realize Judy went off with a Santa who wasn't a department store employee, they assume she was kidnapped. This accusation concerns Ranger Smith (despite having past problems with Yogi's antics,  he can't believe Yogi would commit such a grave act). 

Snooper and Blabber were speaking to the Chief of Police at the time when word comes that Judy was seen in the park by a patrol car, and the Chief heads out to personally see the arrest of Judy's kidnapper. At the park, Yogi and his friends celebrate Christmas when the police arrive with Mr. Jones, accusing Yogi Bear of kidnapping his daughter. Yogi tells Mr. Jones that he needs to spend more time with Judy before she becomes an adult, but Mr. Jones denies it because he's busy all the time and is never home, only to then realize that Yogi is right. Guilty over his failure of being a good father to Judy, Mr. Jones tells the police to release Yogi by telling the Chief that it was really his fault that Judy ran off with Yogi, taking full responsibility for the whole debacle that's happened today, and Ranger Smith takes care of sorting out anything else the police would charge Yogi with. The special then ends with everyone singing Christmas carols around a campfire in the park.
