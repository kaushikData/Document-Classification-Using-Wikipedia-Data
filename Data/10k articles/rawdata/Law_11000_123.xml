In the [[United States]], adoption is permanently placing a person under the age of 18 with a parent or parents other than the birth parents.

==Overview==
Adoptions in the United States may be either domestic or from another country. Domestic adoptions can be arranged either through a state agency, an adoption agency, or independently.&lt;ref&gt;Adopting in America: How To Adopt Within One Year, by Randall Hicks, WordSlinger Press 2005&lt;/ref&gt; 

Adoption agencies must be licensed by the state in which they operate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adoption101.com/agency_adoption.html&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. government maintains a website, [http://www.childwelfare.gov/nfcad/ Child Welfare Information Gateway], which lists each state's licensed agencies. There are both private and public adoption agencies. Private adoption agencies often focus on infant adoptions, while public adoption agencies typically help find homes for waiting children, many of them presently in foster care and in need of a permanent loving home.&lt;ref&gt;ADOPTION: The Essential Guide to Adopting Quickly and Safely, by Randall Hicks, Perigee Press 2007&lt;/ref&gt; To assist in the adoption of waiting children, there is a U.S. government-affiliated website, AdoptUSKids.org, assisting in sharing information about these children with potential adoptive parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adoptuskids.org/|title=Adopt US Kids|publisher=Adoption Exchange Association|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The North American Council on Adoptable Children provides information on financial assistance to adoptive parents (called [[Adoption tax credit|adoption subsidies]]) when adopting a child with special needs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nacac.org/adoptionsubsidy/adoptionsubsidy.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

Independent adoptions are usually arranged by attorneys and typically involve newborn children. Approximately 55% of all U.S. newborn adoptions are completed via independent adoption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adoption101.com/independent_adoption.html Independent adoptions]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]] was the first census in which adoption statistics were collected. The estimated number of children adopted in the year 2000 was slightly over 128,000, bringing the total U.S. population of adopted children to 2,058,915.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/censr-6.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the number of children adopted increased to nearly 136,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/adopted0708.pdf#Page=26&amp;view=Fit&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foster care system==
[[File:Haley-Singleton.jpg|thumb|A young girl is adopted out of the foster care system]]
The United States [[foster care]] system enables adults to care for minor children who are not able to live with their biological parents. In fiscal year 2000, 150,703 [[foster children]] were adopted in the United States, many by their foster parents or relatives of their biological parents. The enactment of the [[Adoption and Safe Families Act]] in 1997 has approximately doubled the number of children adopted from foster care in the United States.
If a child in the U.S. governmental foster care system is not adopted or returned to the custody of their birth parents by the age of 18 years, they are [[Aging out|aged out]] of the system on their 18th birthday. To help encourage the adoption of children presently in foster care, adoption exchanges were created, so the county adoption agencies around the country could have  central data base to help waiting children find homes. This allows prospective adoptive parents to not only see children waiting for adoption in their own region, but throughout the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adoption from Foster Care|url=http://adoptuskids.org/adoption-and-foster-care/overview/adoption-from-foster-care|website=adoptuskids.org|publisher=Adoption Exchange Assoc / Children's Bureau|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central adoption exchange is adoptuskids.org, created through a grant of the Children's Bureau, U.S. Office of Administration of Children and Families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who We Are|url=http://adoptuskids.org/about-us/who-we-are|website=adoptuskids.org|publisher=Adoption Exchange Association|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wide impact==
Adoption is changing the way people form families, as well as affecting the way society perceives the fundamental concepts of life such as [[nature and nurture]] and the role of biological relations with an adoptive family member.  Because of changes in adoption over the last few decades – changes that include [[open adoption]], [[LGBT adoption|gay adoption]], [[international adoption]]s and trans-racial ([[racial transformation]]) adoptions, and a focus on moving children out of the [[foster care]] system into adoptive families – the impact of adoption on the basic unit of society and the family, has been enormous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adoptioninstitute.org/survey/survey_summary.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051023123449/http://www.adoptioninstitute.org/survey/survey_summary.html |archivedate=2005-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adoption is often thought of as a beautiful process. The transfer of parental rights grants birth parents a second chance at fulfilling life goals while placing their child into the arms of someone who not only longs for a precious infant but is prepared for raising them. The adoptee also grows up knowing that they have parents who chose them and birth parents who loved them enough to choose life and also place them for adoption so that they could have a chance at a better life. The adoption triad or the relationship between the birth parents, adoptive parents, and the adoptee seemingly all benefit from adoption. Evidently all outcomes of adoption seem wonderful, however, a closer look reveals adoption is the cause of many lifelong issues for the birth parents, the adoptive parents, and the adoptee. 
Adoption research scholars have reported seven core issues to consistently be associated with the unnatural processes of adoption. Problems with loss, grief, rejection, guilt and shame, identity, intimacy, and control uniquely affect each member of the adoption triad. It is important to be mindful of the realities of adoptions as they permanently impact those involved. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/adoption/intro/issues/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trans-racial adoption==
The adoption of children of one race by parents of another race, which began officially in the United States in 1948, has always generated controversy.&lt;ref&gt;H. Fogg-Davis (2002). The Ethics of Transracial Adoption&lt;/ref&gt; The argument often comes down to opposing views as to who gets to decide what is the "best interest" of children. Critics of transracial adoption question whether [[white American]] parents can effectively prepare children of color to deal with racism. Others wonder where the children raised by white parents will find social acceptance as adults. Testimony from many transracially adopted adults who grew up in white families illustrates the "in-between" status many adoptees feel, not belonging to or feeling comfortable in communities of color or among white society.&lt;ref&gt;Simon &amp; Roorda (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Another source of controversy is the history of the widespread removal of children from families and communities of color, which has been shown by historians to have been a tool to regulate families and oppress communities, dating back to slavery times and during the now-discredited Indian Boarding School movement of the early twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Shin, Oparah, &amp; Trenka (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Given this history of child removal, the National Association of Black Social Workers (NABSW) condemned transracial adoptions in 1972 in their historic Position Statement. In that paper, the NABSW equated the removal of African American children from their families of origin—and their placement in white homes—with "[[cultural genocide]]."&lt;ref&gt;Source: Robert H. Bremner, Children and Youth in America: A Documentary History, Vol. 3, Parts 1-4 (Harvard University Press, 1974):777-780.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pro-transracial adoption advocates argue that there are more [[White people|white]] families seeking to adopt than there are minority families; conversely, there are more minority children available for adoption. For example, in 2009, 41% of children available for adoption were African American, 40% were white children, and 15% were Hispanic children.&lt;ref&gt;[[Foster care]]&lt;/ref&gt; This disparity often results in a lower cost to adopt children from ethnic minorities - usually through special adoption grants rather than fee discrimination. Many critics decry the exchange of money for children, whether as "fees for service" or otherwise, arguing that no children of any race should ever be for sale. Proponents point out practicality in the current systems.  This situation is morally difficult because the adoptive families see adoption as a great benefit to trans-racially adopted children, while some minorities see it as an assault on their culture.  In 2004, 26 percent of African-American children adopted from foster care were adopted trans-racially.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/17/us/17adopt.html ''Overcoming Adoption’s Racial Barriers''] by Lynette Clemets and Ron Nixon, [[The New York Times]], August 17, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Government agencies have varied over time in their willingness to facilitate trans-racial adoptions.  "Since 1994, white prospective parents have filed, and largely won, more than two dozen [[Racial discrimination|discrimination]] lawsuits, according to state and federal court records."&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; There is also a great need to place these children; in 2004 more than 45,000 African-American children were waiting to be adopted from foster care.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

Americans have adopted more than 200,000 children from overseas in the past 15 years, half of whom come from Asia.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;  This trend has helped lower the resistance to trans-racial adoptions in the United States, at least for Asian and Hispanic children, although there is still high demand for Caucasian children, who usually come from [[Eastern Europe]].

As the children adopted in the early days of the transracial adoption experiment have reached middle age, a growing chorus of voices from adult transracial adoptees has emerged. Their collective experience can be found in films,&lt;ref&gt;"Hoard, D. (1998) "Struggle for Identity: Issues in Transracial Adoption"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bertelsen, Phil. Outside Looking In: Transracial Adoption in America&lt;/ref&gt; scholarly articles, memoirs,&lt;ref&gt;John. J/ Black Baby, White Hands: A View from the Crib&lt;/ref&gt; blogs,&lt;ref&gt;[John Raible Online], Harlow's Monkey, Twice the Rice&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous books on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Shin, Oparah, and Trenka (eds.) Outsiders Within: Writing on Transracial Adoption. Boston: South End Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simon, R. &amp; Roorda, R. In Their Own Voices: Transracial Adoptees Tell Their Stories.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adoption reform==
No sooner were US adoptions made secretive with original birth records sealed, than those adopted began to seek reform.  Jean Paton, author of Breaking Silence and founder of Orphan Voyage in 1954, is regarded as the mother of adoption reform and reunification efforts. Jean Paton mentored adoptee Judith Land, "Adoption Detective: Memoir of an Adopted Child" during her adoption search. Florence Fisher organized The ALMA Society (Adoptees Liberation Movement Association) in 1972, Emma May Vilardi created International Soundex Reunion Registry (ISRR) in 1975, Lee Campbell and other birthmothers joined the fight for Open Records forming [[Concerned United Birthparents]] (CUB) in 1976, and by the spring of 1979 representatives of 32 organizations from 33 states, Canada and Mexico gathered together in DC to establish the American Adoption Congress (AAC). The Triadoption Library began keeping records in 1978 showing 52 search/support/reform organizations, by 1985 there were over 550 worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.triadoption.com/ TRIADOPTION Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;

Adoption Reform encompasses [[family preservation]], adoptees' access to original birth certificates, birth and adoptive families having direct access to each other ([[open adoption]]) and all related records (open records).

As of July 2014, 28 U.S. states and the District of Columbia have legal provisions for enforceable open adoption contact agreements, and an additional six states have provisions for enforceable agreements with some limitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iheartadoption.org/blog/2014/5-questions-about-adoption-contact-agreements/|title=5 Questions about Adoption Contact Agreements|last=Siino|first=Jackie|date=11 July 2014|accessdate=29 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810065550/http://www.iheartadoption.org/blog/2014/5-questions-about-adoption-contact-agreements/|archive-date=2014-08-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year additional states consider law changes that give persons separated by adoption access to information about themselves and each other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/state/ State laws]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, over 85% of adoptions in the US are either semi- or completely open.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adoptimist.com/adoption-blog/why-you-should-consider-open-adoption#.UtrpHhDTm4Q|title=Why You Should Consider Open Adoption|last=Grant|first=Amanda|date=2 August 2013|publisher=Adoptimist|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cost of Adoption ==

=== Prohibitive Cost ===
Adoption costs can range from almost nothing for foster care adoptions to over $50,000 for international adoptions, in 2015 U.S average adoption costs is $37,000.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.adoptivefamilies.com/resources/adoption-news/adoption-cost-and-timing-2015-2016/|title=How Much Does It Cost to Adopt a Child? Financial and Timing Report|date=2017-02-21|work=Adoptive Families|access-date=2018-10-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; High costs negatively impact the demand for adoption, as fewer prospective adoptive families can afford to adopt, but the number of children that need adopted stays the same or increases. As a result, prospective adopters may seek less cost prohibitive alternatives to adoption like fertility treatments or privately arranged adoptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2d1b/773425c1f3f82af9098718b4bdf4809d52aa.pdf|title=The Economics of Adoption of Children from Foster Care|last=Hansen|first=Mary Eschelbach|date=September 2005|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Source of Costs ===
The cost of adoption varies widely based on the method of adoption. Almost all the different forms of adoptions have costs related to home study, documentation, adoption agency fees, consultant fees, attorney fees, travel expenses, birth family expenses, foster care costs, early childhood medical costs, and relocation costs.

Public foster care adoptions frequently incur zero costs, though the U.S. average is $2,622 according to a 2015 survey done by Adoptive Families Magazine. Independently-arranged adoptions, orchestrated by a private attorney, can vary greatly in costs. The arrangements are generally setup between prospective adopters and an expecting mother. While some independent adoption arrangements may stay low cost due to nature of the agreement, costs still average $31,890. Independent-arranged adoptions can defer costs by staying in-state, sharing prenatal and child birth medical costs with the birth parents, finding a birth parent by word-of-mouth or by offer to avoid "shopping" for an adoption-willing parent. Private adoption agencies are the most expensive option, with an average cost of $42,337. Out-of-state adoptions can drastically increase adoption costs due to complex legal challenges and travels costs. Costs vary between states due to differing regulations and fees that can cause additional expenses. Medical costs were also frequently cited as an unexpected expense for both the birth mothers and the children. "False starts," when a mother decides not to give up their baby after it is born, can cost up to $2,500 each time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== International Adoption Costs ====
International adoptions can vary in cost, depending on the country, and average between $30,000 and $50,000 dollar. In some countries, costs can be equivalent to domestic adoption. According to Adoptive Families Magazine, Ethiopia to U.S. adoptions in 2015 averaged $30,633, while South Korea to U.S. adoptions averaged $40,000 to $50,000. Disparities in country's adoption costs can be attributed by the differences in their regulation and requirements. Both Ethiopia and South Korea require two trips by prospective adopters, which increases overall costs. South Korea's advanced pre-adoption care and medical system costs can also increase costs passed down to adoptive parents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to the potential of challenging political and cultural climates of adoption origin countries, undisclosed costs such as "required donations," facilitating or origin country agency fees, and other extrajudicial pay-offs to the children's guardians or origin country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shura|first=Robin|last2=Rochford|first2=Elle|last3=Gran|first3=Brian K|date=2016-06-13|title=Children for sale? The blurred boundary between intercountry adoption and sale of children in the United States|url=https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/IJSSP-03-2015-0034|journal=International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy|language=en|volume=36|issue=5/6|pages=319–334|doi=10.1108/ijssp-03-2015-0034|issn=0144-333X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Physical Characteristics as a Cost Factor ====
The physical characteristics of children being considered for adoption; such as race, age, and physical or developmental disability; can cause a 74% variation in adoption costs. Adopting parents may have a desire for specific characteristics in their adoptive child, for which they are willing to pay extra costs to obtain. In international adoptions, children with brown skin color cost $8,200 less to adopt, and dark skin color $14,700 less to adopt, compared to Caucasian children. In domestic adoptions, adoptions cost $600 less per every additional year of age. Additionally, African American children cost $4,400 less than their Caucasian counterparts to adopt. Children with physical disabilities cost $4,000 less.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skidmore|first=Mark|last2=Anderson|first2=Gary|last3=Eiswerth|first3=Mark|date=2014-11-12|title=The Child Adoption Marketplace|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1091142114547412|journal=Public Finance Review|language=en|volume=44|issue=2|pages=163–196|doi=10.1177/1091142114547412|issn=1091-1421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subsidies and Tax Credits ===
Adopters can claim most expenses through the [[adoption tax credit]]. For foster system adoptions, the adoption tax credit may cover the entire cost of adoption. Foster children may also qualify for monthly government stipends, Medicaid health insurance, and even college tuition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Search and reunion==
Many adopted children who were separated from their birth parents by adoption have a desire to reunite, and most would like [[Access_to_US_Adoption_Records|family medical history information]] and access to any documents where they are mentioned. Often, birth parents who placed their infants want to reunite as well. In states which practice or have practiced confidential adoption, this has led to the creation of [[Adoption reunion registry|adoption reunion registries]], and efforts to establish the right of adoptees to access their sealed records (for example, the [[American Adoption Congress]], [[Concerned United Birthparents]], and [[Bastard Nation]]).  Others join search and support groups, most of which are non-profit, or some hire investigative companies to locate birth families and adopted children.

==International adoption==
Prospective American adoptive parents may use [[international adoption]] (also called intercountry adoption) to adopt a child from another country. American citizens, including American citizens who have emigrated from countries they wish to adopt from, represent the majority of international adoptive parents, followed by [[Europe]]ans and those from other developed nations such as Australia.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The laws of different countries vary in their willingness to allow international adoptions.  Some countries, such as [[China]], [[South Korea|Korea]] and [[Vietnam]], have very well established rules and procedures for foreign adopters to follow, while others, the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE) for example, expressly forbid it. International adoptions by Americans became much more common after the [[Korean War]] when American servicemen fathered interracial children with Korean women.  China is the leading country for international adoptions by Americans.

The U.S. Department of State has designated two accrediting entities for organizations providing inter-country adoption services in the United States that work with sending countries that have ratified the [[Hague Adoption Convention]], which specifies by international treaty requirements for adoption between countries that have ratified the treaty. They are the Council on Accreditation and the Colorado Department of Health and Human Services. [https://web.archive.org/web/20101006051314/http://adoption.state.gov/hague/accreditation/process.html]  The U.S. Department of State maintains a list of all accredited international adoption providers.

===Facilitators===
There are also individuals who act on their own and attempt to match waiting children, both domestically and abroad, with prospective parents, and in foreign countries provide additional services such as [[translation]] and local [[transport]]. They are commonly referred to as [[facilitator]]s. Since in many [[jurisdiction]]s their legal status is uncertain (and in some U.S. states they are banned outright), they operate in a legal gray area.

Where the law does not specifically allow them to, all they can do is make an introduction, leaving the details of the placement to those legally qualified to do so. But in practice, their role as gatekeepers can give them a great deal of power to direct a particular child to a particular client, or not, and some have been accused of using this power to [[fraud|defraud]] prospective adoptive parents.

'''William Ball Sutch''' (27 June 1907 – 28 September 1975) was a New Zealand economist, historian, writer, [[public servant]], public intellectual.  He was suspected of being a Soviet spy and in 1974, he was charged with trying to pass New Zealand Government information to the [[Soviet Union]]. He was acquitted, an outcome that was the subject of much debate since then.  Although, there were subsequent disclosures from the KGB which indicated that he may have been a spy, no definitive proof that he was has ever been uncovered. 

==Early life==
Sutch was born in [[Southport]], England in 1907, but his family moved to New Zealand when he was only eight months old. His father, Ebenezer (Ted) Sutch, was a journeyman carpenter, and his mother, Ellen Sutch (née Ball), a dressmaker. He grew up in the [[Methodism|Methodist]] faith, which was to have a strong influence on him throughout his life.&lt;ref name="DNZB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/5s54/sutch-william-ball |title=Story: Sutch, William Ball |author=Easton, Brian|date=26 February 2014|work=Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He went to [[Wellington College (New Zealand)|Wellington College]], then the [[Wellington College of Education]] and [[Victoria University College]] (later [[Victoria University of Wellington]]) where he gained a [[Master's degree|MA]] and [[Bachelor of Commerce|B.Com]].&lt;ref name="DNZB" /&gt; His field of interest at University, particularly, was in the [[English Poor Law]], and it is this work that led to a fellowship being offered to [[Columbia University]], the offer effectively a prize for his work up till then.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Before taking this up he had taught at [[Nelson College]] (he did much of his degrees part-time, while teaching) and [[Wanganui Technical College]]. At Columbia he was awarded a PhD in Economics in 1932 on "Price fixing in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="DNZB" /&gt; After some travel he then returned to New Zealand which was experiencing the [[Great Depression]]. The Depression, and his families position also, deeply affected his personal philosophy.

In April 1933, Sutch was one of four people that included Morva Williams, his future wife, who were reported missing in the [[Tararua Range]] during an attempt to be the first people to follow a particular route during the winter season. Despite plans to complete the trip within two days, they were held up when two of the members suffered a fall and subsequent injuries, and were then forced to travel very slowly through some of the most persistently bad weather experienced in the range until that time, before finally making their way out more than two weeks later. Once noticed to be missing, the resulting search became the largest search and rescue operation within New Zealand up until that time, involving roughly 200 people.&lt;ref name="MacLean1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris MacLean|title=Tararua: The Story of a Mountain Range|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CMVHAAAACAAJ|accessdate=13 January 2012|date=December 1994|publisher=Whitcombe Press|isbn=978-0-473-02613-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Politically, Sutch was generally on the left, although his wide network of friends included people of all political persuasions, and perhaps the person he most admired was the centre-right politician [[Gordon Coates]]. He was involved in a number of left-leaning organisations and associations, and helped edit and publish literature connected with them. In 1939, he assisted the publication of Psycho-pathology in politics, written by Labour Party dissident John A. Lee which was an attack on the party's leader, [[Michael Joseph Savage]]. Sutch wrote numerous books. Among the first were: ''Poverty and Progress in New Zealand'' (1941, 1969), which echoed the work ''Progress and Poverty'', by the Californian [[Henry George]] (1879), known as the "single [land] taxer"; and ''The Quest for Security in New Zealand'' (1942, 1966).{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}, which to Sutch was a related topic.

===Early career===
In 1933, following some teaching in [[Palmerston North Boys' High School]], Sutch took up a position in the office of Gordon Coates, who was [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]]. When the government changed, he continued on in the office of Coates's successor, [[Walter Nash]] of the [[First Labour Government of New Zealand|First Labour Government]]. He had considerable input into economic policy at the time. Eventually, Sutch's political activities were deemed incompatible with his official role, and he was transferred out of the economic sphere. He left the civil service to join the army, becoming an instructor. He returned to the Ministry of Supply arranging equipment and finance.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Work overseas===
At the end of the war, he took up a position with the new [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] (UNRRA), working in Sydney and then in London, covering war-devastated Europe. As a result of this work, he was selected to head the New Zealand delegation to the United Nations, where he held positions with the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Commission]] and [[United Nations Children's Fund|UNICEF]]. He played a crucial role in a UN decision to continue with [[UNICEF]], despite a United States desire to close it down. Ben Alpers has said that some of the credit for UNICEF's [[Nobel Prize for Peace]] should go to Sutch and New Zealand.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}.  Soviet documents claim he was recruited as a spy in 1950.&lt;ref name="stuff.co.nz"&gt;http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/10369208/Fresh-twist-in-40-year-old-Cold-War-spy-mystery&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to New Zealand===
Upon returning to New Zealand in 1951, Sutch worked for the Department of Industries and Commerce, eventually in 1958 rising to be its Secretary. There he promoted the development of the [[New Zealand economy]] using the policy instruments of the day, including [[price controls]], subsidies and import controls. He concluded that pastoral exports by themselves would not generate enough foreign exchange to maintain full employment, and would continue to make the economy highly vulnerable to fluctuations in international conditions. So he sought import substitution, the further processing of agricultural production for export, and the exporting of non-pastoral agricultural exports, manufacturing and services (such as tourism). As such he foresaw, championed and laid the foundations of the great export diversifications of the 1970s.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Sutch's promotion of industrialisation was anathema to much of the farming community, though many in the business community supported him. In March 1965 he was forced to retire after 40 years of public service employment and at the age of 57 he became a consultant.  Among his many further publications were the books, ''Colony or Nation?'', ''The Responsible Society in New Zealand'', ''Takeover New Zealand'', and ''Women with a Cause''. His [[festschrift]], ''Spirit of an Age'', was published in 1975. Sutch became active in the arts and architectural communities, including the [[Wellington Architectural Centre]]. He was an early and active promoter of [[New Zealand design]], asserting that quality design was central to economic and social development. He helped to set up the Wellington Architectural Centre, provided the intellectual framework that led to the formation of the New Zealand Industrial Design Council and chaired the [[Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council]] (now [[Creative New Zealand]]).&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Thompson, 'Modernizing for trade: institutionalizing design promotion in New Zealand, 1958-1967', ''Journal of Design History'', vol 24, no 3 (2011), pp. 223-239. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
Sutch's writing provides one of the most comprehensive accounts of, and visions for, New Zealand. While his views were often original and independent, many that were rejected at the time are now accepted. He was a nation-builder who wanted to see an economically strong and socially fair New Zealand, free from colonial ties, whether economic or political. He was a committed nationalist, and on many matters ahead of his times.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Economist Brian Easton has argued that: "The events surrounding the trial overshadowed the significance of what went before, and have muted subsequent recognition of his intellectual contributions."&lt;ref name="DNZB" /&gt; The trial also overshadowed his role in the establishment of UNICEF.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Sutch's daughter, Helen Sutch, said after the declassification of New Zealand SIS documents in 2008 said: "Our family hopes that justice can now be done to that historic legacy, which has been overshadowed for so long by events in the last year of his life".&lt;ref name="SIS file vindication" /&gt;

==Controversy==

===Charges under the Official Secrets Act===
In September 1974, Sutch was arrested and charged under the [[Official Secrets Act#New Zealand|Official Secrets Act 1951]] following a series of clandestine meetings with KGB agent Dimitri Rasgovorov, an official of the Soviet Union's embassy in Wellington.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_478632"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-star-times/features/feature-archive/478632/Was-Bill-Sutch-a-spy |title=Was Bill Sutch a spy? |date=7 June 2008 |work=[[The Sunday Star-Times]] |accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/content/1832665/423466.xhtml |title=SIS reopens Sutch spy debate |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sutch was the only New Zealander ever to stand trial under the espionage provisions of the Official Secrets Act, based on the British Act of 1951 and repealed in 1983.

The SIS aimed to catch Sutch passing on information during a meeting at night in a public park, but did not detain Sutch until after Rasgovorov had left.  They assumed Sutch would co-operate once caught red handed.  When he did not, they could not provide specific details of what information Sutch had passed to the Soviet diplomat (hence the curious charge that he faced, under the Official Secrets Act, of passing unspecified information to the Soviet Union). Sutch claimed his meetings with Soviet officials were after the Russian ostensibly approached him in his capacity as a stalwart of the NZ Friends of Israel, for information about who were the Zionists in New Zealand, and to discuss China.

At trial the [[New Zealand Security Intelligence Service|Security Intelligence Service]] (SIS) claimed that the retired Sutch had obtained official government information to give to the Soviets but was unable to provide details of what information. Following a high-profile trial, a jury acquitted Sutch of the charges in February 1975.

Sutch began to suffer ill health at about the same time as he was arrested and died from liver cancer six months after the trial on 28 September 1975 at Wellington, shortly after holding his just-born first grandson, Piers.&lt;ref name="DNZB" /&gt;

===Subsequent contemporary debate===
Debate over his guilt or innocence continued long after his death. A book published in 2006 by C.H (Kit) Bennetts, the SIS officer who had first observed Sutch, reasserted the claim that he was guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10403873 |title=Sutch was a traitor, insists agent who exposed him |date=2 October 2006 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Spy-catcher-reveals-his-cover-in-Qld/2006/11/12/1163266398478.html |title=Spy catcher reveals his cover in Qld|work=The Age|date=12 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an editorial, the ''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' applauded the publication of the book, and said "Bennetts' unauthorised account has done the SIS a service".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10404171 |work=New Zealand Herald| title=Editorial: Enduring study in treachery|date=4 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 May 2008, most of the SIS file on the Sutch and the trial were declassified. The files contained no new material information. On the other hand a Top Secret 1976 report by chief ombudsman Sir [[Guy Powles]] found that SIS actions had been unlawful when they burgled and bugged his office.&lt;ref name="SIS file vindication"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10514769 |title=SIS file on Cold War spy scandal vindicates Sutch |date=6 June 2008 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, [[Cambridge university]] released details from the KGB files from the Wellington Embassy that they held in archives that had been provided by Soviet defector [[Vasili Mitrokhin]] in 1992 . According to Phil Kitchen of ''[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]]'', "The documents don't name Sutch but the details clearly identify him and state he was recruited [by the KGB] in 1950." If the person was indeed Sutch, he was recruited while representing New Zealand at the United Nations, and continued contact with the KGB for 24 years, including 15 years when he was employed in high Government office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/10369208/Fresh-twist-in-40-year-old-Cold-War-spy-mystery | title=Fresh twist in 40-year-old Cold War spy mystery | work=The Dominion Post | date=11 August 2014 | accessdate=10 January 2016 | author=Kitchen, Phil}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sutch's daughter did not accept the evidence, stating: "It is well known that KGB agents in general were desperate to talk up any contacts they had because they were under pressure from their superiors".&lt;ref name="Sutch file appears to be the Smoking Gun, Dominon Post 12 August 2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/comment/editorials/10372205/Editorial-Sutch-file-appears-to-be-the-smoking-gun |title=Sutch file appears to be the Smoking Gun |date=12 August 2014 |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] |accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
On 12 January 1934 at Wellington, Bill Sutch married Morva Milburn Williams, a schoolteacher. There were no children of the marriage. His marriage to Morva was dissolved on 2 February 1944, and he married Shirley Hilda Stanley Smith (1916–2008), a lecturer and later a lawyer, in Auckland on 2 June that year. They had one daughter, Helen, who was economic adviser to Prime Minister [[David Lange]] and rose to a prominent position with the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wellington-girls.school.nz/hall-of-fame/helen-sutch&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15403">[[Malaysia]] curbs [[blasphemy]] and any insult to religion or to the religious by rigorous control of what people in that country can say or do. Government-funded schools teach young Muslims the principles of [[Sunni Islam]], and instruct young non-Muslims on morals. The government informs the citizenry on proper behavior and attitudes, and ensures that Muslim civil servants take courses in Sunni Islam. The government ensures that the broadcasting and publishing media do not create disharmony or disobedience. If someone blasphemes or otherwise engages in deviant behavior, Malaysia punishes such transgression with [[Sharia]] or through legislation such as the Penal Code.

==Penal Code==
Articles 295-298A of the Malaysian Penal Code provide penalties for those who commit offenses against religion. The penalties range from {{Clarify|date=February 2012}} up to three years in prison or a fine of up to US$1,000 (approximately).&lt;ref name="AsiaMedia"&gt;{{cite web

==The judicial system==
The Malaysian Federation's [[Courts of Malaysia|judicial system]] is based upon [[English law]].&lt;ref name = "USSD2009"&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Background Note: Malaysia

  | accessdate = 31 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The system has two types of courts. Secular courts deal with civil and criminal law. Sharia courts deal with matters that involve Islamic law: marriage, inheritance, apostasy, religious conversion, and custody among others.&lt;ref name = "AsiaMedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "IRF2008"&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 31 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malaysia's judicial system has a [[Federal Court of Malaysia|Federal Court]], a [[Malaysian Court of Appeal|Court of Appeal]], [[High Courts of Malaysia|High Courts]] (secular and Sharia in some states), [[Sessions_Court#Malaysia|Sessions Courts]], Magistrate's Courts, and Juvenile Courts. The Federal Court reviews decisions referred from the Court of Appeal, and the Federal Court has original jurisdiction in constitutional matters and in disputes between states or between the federal government and a state.&lt;ref name = "USSD2009"/&gt;

In May 2007, the Federal Court ruled that Muslims are not entitled to freedom of worship, even though such freedom is guaranteed by Malaysia's Constitution. By a two-to-one decision, the Court held that the secular courts have no jurisdiction over any Islamic matter even if non-Muslims are involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Government maintains an official list of fifty-six sects of Islam which the government considers "deviant" and a threat to national security. Muslims who deviate from accepted Sunni principles may be detained and subjected to mandatory "rehabilitation" in centers that teach and enforce government-approved Islamic practices. Muslims generally may not convert to another religion, although members of other religions may convert to Islam.&lt;ref name = "IRF2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Malaysia requires every citizen (from age twelve) to be issued with a national identity card, the [[MyKad]]. This card has a microchip which contains, among other information, the name of the cardholder’s religion. All Malays (an ethnic group comprising more than fifty percent of the population)—of whatever religion—have cards with the word "ISLAM" on the card's face.&lt;ref name = "IRF2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Anak"/&gt; The identity cards enable "religious police" to identify Muslims who are violating Islamic precepts.&lt;ref name = "IRF2008"/&gt;

==Education==
Government-sponsored schools require Muslim children to receive Islamic religious instruction. The schools require non-Muslim children to take morals or ethics courses.&lt;ref name = "IRF2008"/&gt; Student assemblies frequently commence with recitation of a Muslim prayer.&lt;ref name = "IRF2008"/&gt; The Government requires all Muslim civil servants to attend government-approved religion classes.&lt;ref name = "IRF2008"/&gt;

==The media==
The government strictly controls what is broadcast and published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  }} &lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the government banned sixty-two books that touched upon religion. In 2008, customs authorities seized six titles of Christian children's books because the books contain words that—according to Islamic authorities—belong to Islam. The Publications and Al-Quran Texts Control Department contended that "Allah" (God), "Baitullah" (House of God), and "Solat" (prayer) are lawfully used by Muslims only.&lt;ref name = "IRF2008"/&gt;

==Selected cases==
In August 2009, a state court sentenced a Muslim woman to six strokes of the cane and a RM 5,000 ($1,400) fine after she was caught drinking beer in a hotel in the Malaysian state of Pahang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In November 2008, the Malaysian National [[Fatwa]] Council told Muslims to refrain from doing yoga because is it blasphemous. The condemnation of yoga followed upon the Council's condemnation of females who wear trousers.

In 2008, religious authorities were seeking [[Ayah Pin]], the leader of a banned, nonviolent religious group known as the [[Sky Kingdom]], and one of his four wives for supporting "deviant" religious practices. On 3&amp;nbsp;March 2008, a Sharia Court sentenced Kamariah Ali, 57, who converted from Islam to the banned group, to two years imprisonment for apostasy.&lt;ref name = "IRF2008"/&gt;

On February 12, 2008, the Internal Security Ministry issued a directive to the Catholic Church to stop using the word "Allah" in its weekly publication, ''[[The_Herald_(Malaysian_Catholic_Weekly)|The Herald]]''.&lt;ref name = "IRF2008"/&gt; On 16&amp;nbsp;February 2009, the Ministry revised its directive to permit the word "Allah" in Christian publications if each publication bore a notice which indicated the publication was not for Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In January 2008, officials from the Ministry of Internal Security seized Christian children's books from several bookshops. The books contained drawings representing [[Moses]] and [[Noah]]. The officials deemed the drawings "caricatures of prophets," and said the drawings were offensive to Muslim sensibilities. The Malaysian Council of Churches accused ministry officials of overstepping their authority by confiscating literature that was not meant for Muslims. The Ministry returned the books.&lt;ref name = "IRF2008"/&gt;

In August 2007, the government of Malaysia suspended for one month the operations of a daily ''Makkal Osai'' (in the Tamil language) for violating the Printing Presses and Publications Act 1984. On 21&amp;nbsp; August 2007, the daily had published a caricature of [[Jesus Christ]] clutching a cigarette and a can of beer.&lt;ref name = "IslamOnline"/&gt;

On 23 January 2006, the National Fatwa Council, Malaysia's highest Islamic authority, banned Muslims from taking part in the activities associated with Black Metal music. Datuk Mustafa Abdul Rahman, the director-general of the Islamic Development Department, told a press conference on 27 January 2006, that Black Metal often led its followers to worship Satan, rebel, kill, and incite hatred. Nevertheless, the government favored counseling rather than a ban upon the musical genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On or about 23 May 2002, a French missionary was arrested on blasphemy charges after distributing a pamphlet about Quranic plagiary. Though he could have been sentenced to two to five years in jail for "acting in a manner which could lead to disharmony between Christians and Muslims," a judge ordered that he be deported.&lt;ref name = "PO"/&gt;

In 2000, the Sharia High Court in the state of Kelantan sentenced four persons to three years in prison for disregarding a lower court's order to recant their deviant beliefs and "return to the true teachings of Islam." The High Court rejected the argument that Sharia has no jurisdiction over people who have ceased to be Muslims. In dismissing the appeal, the Court of Appeal ruled (in August 2002) that only the Sharia court has jurisdiction to determine whether a person has ceased to be a Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

As such, he is head of the [[Politics of Zimbabwe#Judicial|Zimbabwe judiciary]]. 

Per Section 168 of the [[Constitution of Zimbabwe|Zimbabwean Constitution]], the Chief Justice is assisted by a [[Deputy Chief Justice of Zimbabwe|Deputy Chief Justice]] and no fewer than two other associate justices. The Chief Justice leads the business of the Supreme Court and presides over oral arguments. He is also the most senior of the three members of the Zimbabwe Court of Appeals. The Chief Justice also administers the oath of office to the [[President of Zimbabwe]]. Like other Supreme Court justices, he is obligated to retire at age 70.

Since the court was established in 1927, 14 men have served as Chief Justice. This includes eight chief justices during the [[Southern Rhodesia]] and [[Rhodesia]] periods. The first Chief Justice was Sir [[Murray Bisset]]. Since Zimbabwe's independence in 1980, six men have served as Chief Justice. Of these six, three have been [[White Zimbabweans|White]] and three Black. The current Chief Justice since 2017 is Luke Malaba.

A '''civil rights referendum''' or '''human rights referendum''' is any act of [[direct democracy]] which allows for a vote on the granting or amendment of current civil rights, liberties or associations as recognized by a government. Such referenda have frequently been proposed as a means by which the majority of the voting public in a polity, rather than the judicial or legislative chambers of government, could determine what the state should recognize or carry out, while such referenda have been strongly criticized by civil rights organizations and professional bodies as means by which the majority of the public could vote on the rights of a vulnerable minority according to contemporary prejudices.

==United States==

===LGBT rights and Same-sex marriage===
Civil rights referenda have been frequently proposed by those in ideological rejection against lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender rights, most often due to Abrahamic religious objections against homosexuality. In countries where governments have passed, activists have frequently sought to put either a repeal of the new LGBT-affirmative law or a (constitutional or statutory) ban on LGBT-affirmative activities or relationships, and often rely upon a core religious constituency in order to drive the advocacy for such a referendum.

In the United States, civil rights referenda were held in the latter 1900s in order to prohibit same-sex unions (including marriage) and repeal amendments to human rights ordinances which included sexual orientations and gender identities as protected classes. The climax of such legislation was the passage of a record number of [[U.S. state constitutional amendments banning same-sex unions]] by referendum in 2004, which coincided with a large turnout for the re-election of [[George W. Bush]] to the presidency and Republican legislators to control of both houses of Congress.

Among those who advocate for LGBT rights, the delegation of marriage and other rights to the "will of the people" has propelled the notion of preventing civil rights-related laws and proposals from going to the ballot. This notion was underscored in the aftermath of the passage of [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|California Proposition 8]] in California.

===Race relations===
In a 2000 Alabama referendum on repealing the 1901 state constitutional ban on [[interracial marriage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/03/us/national-news-briefs-interracial-marriage-ban-up-for-vote-in-alabama.html|title = National News Briefs; Interracial Marriage Ban Up for Vote in Alabama|date = June 3, 1999|publisher = New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://articles.cnn.com/1999-03-12/us/9903_12_interracial.marriage_1_interracial-house-panel-samesex-marriage?_s=PM:US|title = Alabama considers lifting interracial marriage ban|date = March 12, 1999|publisher = CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; over 40% of the participating electorate voted against repealing the ban. While the ban was rendered unenforceable following ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'', the 40.51% of the populace voting against the repeal . In 1998, South Carolina voters voted 61.95%-38.05% in favor of repealing their own constitutional ban. Harvard University professor [[Werner Sollors]] intimated that the laws took so long after ''Loving'' to be repealed because of the complex clauses which required large majorities in order to repeal them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.salon.com/2001/03/08/sollors/singleton|title = Mixing it up|date = Mar 8, 2001 &lt;!-- 3:14 PM --&gt; |publisher = Salon|author = Suzy Hansen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 26, 2012, in remarks accompanying his decision to veto the legalization of same-sex marriage by the State Legislature and call for a referendum on the matter, New Jersey governor [[Chris Christie]] remarked that "The fact of the matter is, I think people would have been happy to have a referendum on civil rights rather than fighting and dying in the streets in the South. It was our political institutions that were holding things back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://videos.nj.com/star-ledger/2012/01/video_christie_thinks_people_w.html|title = Video: Christie thinks people would have been happy to have referendum on civil rights|publisher = New Jersey Star-Ledger|date = January 25, 2012 &lt;!-- , 7:16 PM --&gt; |author = Adya Beasley}}&lt;/ref&gt;" He was strongly criticized by politicians and activists of both African-American and other ancestries from both inside and outside of New Jersey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.newjerseynewsroom.com/state/christie-says-civil-rights-movement-could-have-been-settled-through-a-ballot-referendum|date = 25 January 2012 &lt;!-- 16:08 --&gt; |publisher = Newsroom New Jersey|title = Christie says like same-sex marriage, civil rights movement could have been settled through ballot referendum|author = TOM HESTER SR.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/01/georgia_civil_rights_leader_jo.html|title = Georgia civil rights leader John Lewis to appear with Sheila Oliver, Rush Holt at gay marriage news conference|publisher = New Jersey Star-Ledger|date = January 30, 2012 &lt;!-- , 8:20 AM --&gt; |author = Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Newark mayor [[Cory Booker]] stating "...dear God, we should not put civil rights issues to a popular vote to be subject to the sentiments and passions of the day.

===Women's suffrage===
[[Women's suffrage]] was first brought forward as proposed legislation in the [[Kansas women's suffrage referendum, 1867]]. The proposal was defeated twice before passing.

[[File:Pope John XXIII - Time Magazine Cover - January 4, 1963.jpg|thumb|[[Time (magazine)|Time]] cover from 1963. Copyright was not renewed, so the collective work is in the public domain. The artist, [[Bernard Safran]] (1924–95), created 73 covers for Time.{{sfn|Bernard Safran: Paintings – safran-arts}}]]
A '''collective work''' is a work that contains the works of several authors assembled and published under the direction of one natural or legal person who owns the [[copyright]] in the work as a whole. 
Definitions vary considerably from one country to another, but usually treat ownership of the work as a whole as distinct from ownership of the individual contributions, so the individual authors may retain the right to publish their work elsewhere.
It is common for publication of articles on the Internet, when isolated from the context of the overall work, to be considered to be outside of the standard agreement between the author and the owner of the collective work.

==General==

===International agreements===

Many countries have agreed to be bound by the terms of the [[Berne Convention]] and/or the [[TRIPS Agreement]].

Article 2.5 of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (Paris Text 1971) specifies: "Collections of literary or artistic works such as encyclopaedias and anthologies which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations shall be protected as such, without prejudice to the copyright in each of the works forming part of such collections."{{sfn|Berne Convention ... 1971}}

Section 10.2 of the TRIPS Agreement, to which members of the [[World Trade Organization]] are bound, states, "Compilations of data or other material, whether in machine readable or other form, which by reason of the selection or arrangement of their contents constitute intellectual creations shall be protected as such. Such protection, which shall not extend to the data or material itself, shall be without prejudice to any copyright subsisting in the data or material itself."{{sfn|Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights – WTO}}

===Limitation on publisher rights===

In general, the author of a contribution to a collective work retains the copyright, and the publisher does not have the right to reuse the contribution in some context other than the collective work without the express consent of the author. 
In England it has been held that exploiting the work of a freelance newspaper photographer in a back numbers website was a use that had not been contemplated in the original license and was not covered by the license.
Such reuse would also infringe the journalist's copyright in the United States.
In a 1997 case in the Netherlands it was held that reuse of newspaper articles on a website and CD-ROM went beyond the implied license.
In Germany any attempt by the author to grant rights to exploit their work in a way that was unknown when the contract was made is null and void under the law.
In France, online publication is considered fundamentally different from print publication.{{sfn|Stokes|2014|p=138}}

===Creative Commons===

The Creative Commons legal code for Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0 (CC2.0) defines a collective work as:
{{quote|"'''Collective Work'''" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.{{sfn|Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0 – Creative Commons}} }}
The license for a CC2.0 work allows the user to incorporate the CC2.0 work in a collective work in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The collective work does not have to be released under a Creative Commons license, but access to the incorporated CC2.0 work must be consistent with the CC2.0 license, and the author must be credited.{{sfn|Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0 – Creative Commons}}

==Common law countries==

The British [[Statute of Anne]] (1710) was the first copyright law in the world.{{sfn|Tallmo|2014}}
The statute is considered a "watershed event in Anglo-American copyright history ... transforming what had been the publishers' private law copyright into a public law grant".{{sfn|Patterson|Joyce|2003|p=916}}  
Under the statute, copyright was for the first time vested in authors rather than publishers; it also included provisions for the public interest, such as a [[legal deposit]] scheme. The Statute was an influence on copyright law in several other nations, including the [[United States]], and even in the 21st century is "frequently invoked by modern judges and academics as embodying the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] underpinnings of copyright law".{{sfn|Alexander|2010|p=17}}

===Australia===

In Australia a collective work is a work composed of separate parts that each attract their own copyright.
An example would be a song in which the author of the music and the author of the lyrics each have copyright in their contribution.{{sfn|Caenegem|2010|p=36}}
The authors have a moral right to be attributed, but only if they are author of a substantial part and it is reasonable to identify the author.{{sfn|Sainsbury|2003|p=50}}
It may be unreasonable to attribute each author in a collective work such as an encyclopedia.{{sfn|Sainsbury|2003|p=51}}

===Canada===

Under Canadian copyright law, a collective work means{{sfn|Copyright Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-42)|pp=2–3}} 
:(a) an encyclopaedia, dictionary, year book or similar work,
:(b) a newspaper, review, magazine or similar periodical, and
:(c) any work written in distinct parts by different authors, or in which works or parts of works of different authors are incorporated; 

When the author of a work is the first owner of copyright, any rights granted by the author revert to his estate.
However, this does not apply to the assignment of the copyright in a collective work or a licence to publish a work or part of a work as
part of a collective work.{{sfn|Copyright Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-42)|loc=14 (1)}}

''[[Robertson v Thomson Corp]]'', {{lexum-scc3|2006|43|2 |363}} is a 2006 [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision on the ownership of copyright in published text that are stored in databases.  The ruling held that though a newspaper held the copyright in the collection and the arrangement of freelance articles and in its newspaper, it could not publish the articles within a database.  Publication within the database would remove the articles from the context of the collective work and therefore their publication as such was not within the rights held by the newspaper.{{sfn|Robertson v. Thomson Corp., [2006]}}
Robertson decided that freelance journalists' copyright can stop the republication of their articles onto databases which display one article at a time but not onto CD-ROMs featuring whole newspapers. The court decided that a CD-ROM in which individual articles may only be viewed in the context of a whole newspaper is not a republication of an individual article as an individual work, but is rather a reproduction of the newspaper as a whole as a work.

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom section 178 of the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]] (CDPA) defines a collective work as either “(a) a work of joint authorship or (b) a work in which there are distinct contributions by different authors or in which works or parts of works of different authors are incorporated.”{{sfn|Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 UK|loc=s.178}}
The general principle is that authors who contribute to a collective work have the right to control future exploitation in their works unless this is expressly waived in the contract.{{sfn|D'Agostino|2010|p=262}}
The editor receives a separate copyright in the collective work for their efforts as long as they meet the originality standard set by the government.{{sfn|Goldstein|Hugenholtz|2012|pp=254}}
The copyright law related to collective works does not provide an exception to the general European term of protection of 70 years following death, which would apply to death of the last surviving author.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=8}}

The [[Copyright Act 1842]] stated that the authors of contributions to collective works did not retain full copyright control over their works. However, they had the right to be paid, the right to refuse consent for additional uses of their work, reversion of copyright after 28 years and (if agreed with the owner of the collective work) the ability to publish their own work.{{sfn|D'Agostino|2010|p=262}}
The 1911 Act, which replaced the 1842 Act, stated that the owner of a collective work would only gain ownership of the copyright of contributions where they had given or promised some valuable consideration and there was no agreement to the contrary.
The author would retain copyright if this could be inferred from the mutual intention of the parties.{{sfn|D'Agostino|2010|p=262}}
Under the [[Copyright Act 1911]], no copyright vests in the proprietor of a collective work unless the author is employed under a contract of service or apprenticeship, or there is an assignment in writing; and when the copyright vests in the proprietor of a periodical by reason of a contract of service or apprenticeship, the author may restrain separate publication.{{sfn|Macgillivray|1912}}

With the 1911 Act the author of a contribution would regain copyright after 25 years, but this would be concurrent with the publisher's right in the collective work. 
It was argued that reversion of full rights to the author would have been "a great hardship to proprietors of collective works, particularly of those permanent in nature, such as ecyclopaedias, if they could not have acquired from the author an unfettered right to produce the work at any future time as part of the collective work."
The author could, however, restrain the publisher from transferring or licensing their work to others.{{sfn|D'Agostino|2010|p=60}}
Under the [[Copyright Act 1956]] employees retained copyright in their work unless there was an agreement to the contrary.{{sfn|D'Agostino|2010|p=262}}
The  CDPA removed the waiver on employee rights.{{sfn|D'Agostino|2010|p=262}}

===United States===

{{main|Collective work (US)}}

In the [[Copyright law of the United States]], the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], section 101, defines a collective work as "a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology, or encyclopedia, in which a number of contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole". 
It is protected as long as the "author" can show that the selection and organization of the contributions is original, and that these contribution can themselves be protected, as opposed to being mere facts such as statistical data.{{sfn|Bruguiere|2017}}

Article 201 (c) states, "Copyright in each separate contribution to a collective work is distinct from copyright in the collective work as a whole, and vests initially in the author of the contribution. In the absence of an express transfer of the copyright or of any rights under it, the owner of copyright in the collective work is presumed to have acquired only the privilege of reproducing and distributing the contribution as part of that particular collective work, any revision of that collective work, and any later collective work in the same series".{{sfn|Bruguiere|2017}}
The compiler, or author of the collection, owns copyright in the expression he or she contributed, which is primarily the selection and arrangement of the separate contributions, but may include such things as a preface, advertisements, etc., that the collective author created.{{sfn|Barrett|2012|loc=PT449}}
The contributions remain the property of the authors by default, but the property may be passed to the owner of the collective work by contract.
They may also obtain ownership of the contributions if they are [[Work for hire|works made for hire]].{{sfn|Bruguiere|2017}}

The Supreme Court case of ''[[New York Times Co. v. Tasini]]'' (2001) concerned free-lance journalists who had been paid for their contributions to paper editions of newspapers and magazines, but their contracts had not covered digital rights for reproduction on CD-ROMs or publication on the Internet.
When the articles were distributed in electronic form a few years later, the court ruled that this did not constitute a revision of the work, because the articles could be accessed individually.
A revision must maintain the articles in their context of origin.{{sfn|Bruguiere|2017}}
In ''Faulkner v. National Geographic Enterprises Inc.'' (2005), a Court of Appeal ruled that an electronic version of a newspaper was a revision of the collective work if it reproduced the paper version identically, including advertisements and photographs.{{sfn|Bruguiere|2017}}

==European countries==

"The New Renaissance", the report of the ''Comité des Sages'' Reflection Group on Bringing Europe’s Cultural Heritage Online, published on 10 January 2011, stated that the public sector had a duty to digitize their cultural heritage. Under the heading of "Ensuring wide access to and use of digitised public domain material" the report stated:{{sfn|European Union|Comité des Sages|2011}}
{{blockquote|
* Cultural institutions should make public domain material digitised with public funding as widely available as possible for access and re-use. This cross-border access should be part of the funding conditions for digitisation across Europe. The use of intrusive watermarks or other means that limit the use of the material should be avoided.{{sfn|European Union|Comité des Sages|2011}}
* The European Commission should consider ways and means to eliminate the differences in the rights status of digitised material between the Member States in a context where cross-border access and use is the norm. In principle the mere digitisation process should not generate any new rights.{{sfn|European Union|Comité des Sages|2011}}}}
The [[Copyright Term Directive]] of 2006 was intended to address the second concern, but has not been effective in harmonizing the terms and definitions.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=2}}
It does state that the term of protection for works whose right-holder is a legal person, as well as for collective works, is 70 years after the work is made available to the public.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=3}}
It also states that where "the natural persons who have created the [collective] work are identified as such in the versions of the works which are made available to the public" the duration of protection is 70 years after the death of the last surviving author.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=8}}
However, there is no standard European definition of the terms "works of joint authorship" and "collective works", so each country must define laws and make legal decisions over when a work with multiple authors is a work of joint authorship, collective work or simply a collection of separate works.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=4}}

=== Czech Republic===

In the Czech Republic a collective work is a work that is created with the participation of more than one authors at the initiative and under the management of a natural person or of a legal entity and made available to the public under that person’s or entity’s name and where the individual contributions involved in the work are not capable of independent use. The work is protected for 70 years after it was made publicly available.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=7}}

===France===
{{main|Collective work (France)}}

The concept of a collective work (''œuvre collective'') in the [[copyright law of France]] is complex, and case law and scholarly views do not always agree.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=7}}
Bernard Edelman, in his ''l’œuvre collective : une définition introuvable'' (1998), describes the legal definition of collective works as "obscure and tangled".{{sfn|Jacobacci Avocats|2014}}
However, all authorities agree that the concept of an ''oeuvre collective'' in France covers dictionaries, encyclopaedias and periodical works such as newspapers or magazines.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=7}}

A "collective work" in France is a work created at the initiative of a natural or legal person who edits it, publishes it and discloses it under his direction and name and in which the personal contributions of the various authors who participated in its production are merged in the overall work for which they were conceived, without it being possible to attribute to each author a separate right in the work as created.
"A collective work shall be the property, unless proved otherwise, of the natural or legal person under whose name it has been disclosed.  The author’s rights shall vest in such person."{{sfn|Intellectual Property Code – Legifrance|p=2–3}}
"In the case of ... collective works, the term of the exclusive right shall be 70 years from January 1 of the calendar year following that in which the work was published."{{sfn|Intellectual Property Code – Legifrance|p=7}}

It does not matter whether the contributors are identified or remain anonymous.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=7}}{{sfn|Bermann|Picard|2008|p=179}}
The ''maître'' takes all the ownership rights in a collective work, and these rights are directly vested in the ''maître'' rather than transferred from the contributors, as long as the ''maître'' directed the creative process enough for it to be considered a collective work.{{sfn|Sutherland Asbill &amp; Brennan LLP|2004|p=9}}
In a 22 March 2012 decision the [[Court of Cassation (France)|French Supreme Court]] (''Cour de cassation'') stated that "the natural or legal person at the initiative of a collective work is vested with the author's rights over this work and, in particular, the moral rights prerogatives".{{sfn|Bretonnière|2012}}
Each contributor to the collective work retains the moral rights to their contribution.{{sfn|Bouche|2011|p=86}}

The rise of the Internet has opened new questions about the rights of the authors of contributions to a collective work.{{sfn|France: Industrial Relations ... Press Reference}}
When a newspaper is reproduced in its entirety the reproduction falls under the collective work regime.
Publication in successive editions of a newspaper during the course of the day, each of which reproduces a large part of the previous edition, is not seen as publication in another newspaper.
Electronic publication of the entire newspaper could therefore be seen as an edition of the same collective work.
However, partial or selective reproduction may require the agreement of the contributors.
Further, the contributors to a newspaper may have the right to separately publish a thematic selection of articles without infringing the rights of the owner of the collective work.{{sfn|Ader|1997}}

===Germany===

The main relevant law in Germany is the Copyright Act of 9 September 1965, the ''Gesetz über Urheberrecht und verwandte Schutzrechte '' (UrhG).
German copyright law defines collective works as collections of works, data, or other independent elements, provided that the collection itself is a personal intellectual creation (UrhG, sec. 4 para 1), in other words: a work as defined by UrhG, sec. 2 para 2.
The authors grant the rights of exploitation to a third party who decides what works to include in the collection.
The difference from a work of joint authorship is that it is practical to separately exploit the parts of a collective work, while that cannot be done with parts of a work of joint authorship. 
It is possible to distinguish between the collection as a work and the parts as different works.{{sfn|Engelhardt|Jaeger}}

Since the authors retain copyright in their contributions, both the authors and the creator of the collective work must consent to its exploitation.
The creator and the authors of the contributions may enforce their rights separately.{{sfn|Engelhardt|Jaeger}}
The copyright term of each contribution is measured from the death of the author of the contribution.{{sfn|Goldstein|Hugenholtz|2012|p=253}}
The collective work resembles a joint work in that the author of each contribution may require the consent to alteration or exploitation of all the contributors "if such consent may reasonably be demanded of them."{{sfn|Goldstein|Hugenholtz|2012|pp=253-254}}
Two years after granting an exploitation right to an editor, or after delivering the work to the editor, the author can revoke the grant if the work has not been published and the author has been harmed as a result.{{sfn|Goldstein|Hugenholtz|2012|p=269}}

===Hungary===

In Hungary a work shall be regarded as a collective work if the contributions of the authors co-operating in the creation of the work are combined in the product of joint creation in a manner which makes the separate determination of the individual authors' rights impossible.  In the case of a collective work ... the copyright shall be transferred by legal succession to the natural or legal person,   business company or legal entity at whose initiative and under whose instructions the work was created and who published it in his own name.{{sfn|Act No. LXXVI of 1999 on copyright – Hungary|loc=Art 6}}
The term of protection of a collective work shall be seventy years counted from the first day of the year following the first disclosure of the work.{{sfn|Act No. LXXVI of 1999 on copyright – Hungary|loc=Art 31}}

===Italy===

Article 3 of the Italian Copyright Law defines collective works as formed by “the assembling of works or parts of works possessing the character of a self-contained creation resulting from selection
and coordination with a specific literary, scientific, didactic, religious, political or artistic aim, such as encyclopaedias, dictionaries, anthologies, magazines and newspapers”. The collective work as a whole is protected for 70 years from publication. For magazines, newspapers and other periodical works, each individual part or issue is given an independent term.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=7}}
The collective works shall be protected as original works, independently and without prejudice to the copyright on the works or parts of works of which they are composed."

Article 7 of the Copyright Law considers the author as the one who organizes and directs the creation of the work: "The author of a collective work is considered to be the person who organizes and directs its creation itself."
What characterizes the collective work is not so much the structural element as the creative coexistence of two levels: that of individual contributions that make up the work and the total ideation of the work and the choice and coordination of contributions or of organization and direction of creative activity carried out by employees.

The individual parts of the collective work are deemed creative works, so the rights to them are retained by their individual creators. This is stated in paragraph 2 of Article 38 of the Copyright Law stating: "The right to use their own contributions separately is reserved for the individual employees of the collective work, in compliance with the agreed terms, and failing that, the following standards."
Moreover, the Article 38 also provides that: "With a collective work, unless otherwise agreed, the right to economic use is with the publisher of the same" where "publisher" means the natural or legal person who assumes the economic risk and bear the costs imposed by the creation and publication of the work.

As part of these works we must therefore distinguish three distinct holders of rights: the author (who organizes and directs its creation), the publisher (who owns only the economic rights) and individual authors. 
Article 42 allows the use of a fragment from the collective work by the author provided it indicates the collective work from which it was taken, and the date of publication:
"The author of the article or other work that is reproduced in a collective work shall be entitled to reproduce it in separate publications or collected in a volume, provided that it indicates the collective work from which it is taken and the date of publication."

===Kosovo===

In Kosovo the copyright in the collective work lasts for seventy years after the lawful disclosure of the work, unless the natural persons who have created the work are identified as such in the versions of the work which are disclosed to the public. 
In case of identification of the authors, copyright will last for seventy years from the date of death of the last surviving author.{{sfn|Law No. 04/L-065 of 30 November 2011 – Kosovo|loc=Art 61}}
Property rights and other copyrights pertaining to a database or collective work created during employment are considered to have passed to the employer exclusively and without limitations, unless the contract provides otherwise,{{sfn|Law No. 04/L-065 of 30 November 2011 – Kosovo|loc=Art 128}} 

A collective copyright work is a work created by collaboration of several authors, by combining their contribution separately into a whole such as encyclopedias, lexicons, databases, computer programs, collections and similar works at the initiative and under the direction of a natural or legal person as the ordering party. 
It is considered that the authors transfer unlimited and exclusive rights to all the material and other copyright in the collective work, unless otherwise provided by contract. 
The principal of the collective copyright work has the right to publish and use the work in its own name, but every copy of the work must contain a list of authors participating in 
the creation of collective work.{{sfn|Law No. 04/L-065 of 30 November 2011 – Kosovo|loc=Art 106}}

===Netherlands===

Under Dutch copyright law Article 5 states that “if a literary, scientific or artistic work consists of separate works by two or more persons, the person under whose guidance and supervision the work as a whole has been made or, if there is no such person, the compiler of the various works, shall be deemed the author of the whole work, without prejudice to the copyright in each of the works separately”. This could apply to works such as anthologies or encyclopedias.
The term of protection is not specified, so by default the collective work may be assumed to be protected until 70 years after the death of the person deemed to be author of the whole work. If this person is a legal person, protection would be for 70 years after publication.{{sfn|Angelopoulos|2012|p=8}}

===Norway===

In Norway a work is protected for 70 years following the year of death of the author. 
In a collective or joint work, this is counted from the death of the longest surviving author. 
For a motion picture, the following are considered authors: main director, scriptwriter, dialogue author, and composer of original musical score.{{sfn|Hannemyr|2009|p=2}}

===Spain===

Under the 1987 [[copyright law of Spain]] collections of other works, such as anthologies, and other elements or data that by the selection or arrangement of materials constitute intellectual creations, are considered protected works without prejudice to the rights of the authors of the original works.{{sfn|Juan Carlos I|1987|loc=Art. 12}}
A collective work is a work created by the initiative and under the coordination of a natural or legal person who edits and publishes it under their name and consists of the collection of contributions from different authors whose personal contributions are based on autonomous creation, and for whom it is not possible to attribute separately a right over the whole of the work. Unless otherwise agreed, the rights to the collective work belong to the person who publishes and disseminates it under their name.{{sfn|Juan Carlos I|1987|loc=Art. 9}}
The duration of rights over a collective work shall be sixty years from the date of its disclosure.{{sfn|Juan Carlos I|1987|loc=Art. 28}}
Article 28 of the 1996 revision to this law grants collective works protection for 70 years following  lawful disclosure of the work.{{sfn|Real Decreto Legislativo 1/1996 – Spain|loc=Art. 28}}

==Other countries==

===Algeria===

In Algeria a collective work is protected for 50 years from publication, 50 years from the time it was made accessible to the public if unpublished, or 50 years from the time it is realized that it has not been made available to the public within 50 years of creation.{{sfn|DZ001: Droits d'auteur, Ordonnance ... Algeria|loc=Art. 56}}

===China===

Chinese law is in some ways closer to that of common law countries than to European civil law. 
It follows the general principle that ownership is originally vested in the author, but makes an exception with collective works.
Article 11 of the Chinese copyright code states that when a legal entity or organization directs creation of a work and bears responsibility for the work, that entity is considered the author of
the work. All rights vest in the organizational author.{{sfn|Sutherland Asbill &amp; Brennan LLP|2004|p=11–12}}

===Philippines===

Under the [[copyright law of the Philippines]], a "collective work" is a work which has been created by two or more natural persons at the initiative and under the direction of another with the understanding that it will be disclosed by the latter under his own name and that contributing natural persons will not be identified.{{sfn|Intellectual Property Code of the Philippines - Part Four|loc=171.2}}
When an author contributes to a collective work, his right to have his contribution attributed to him is deemed waived unless he expressly reserves it.{{sfn|Intellectual Property Code of the Philippines - Part Four|loc=196}}

===Vanuatu===

In Vanuatu a "collective work" is a work created by 2 or more individuals at the initiative and under the direction of another person on the understanding that (a) the work will be disclosed by that other person under that person’s own name; and (b) the identity of the contributing individuals will not be indicated.{{sfn|Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 ... Vanuatu|p=3}}
The person who initiated and directed the creation of a collective work is the original owner of the economic rights.{{sfn|Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 ... Vanuatu|p=13}} 
A "work of joint authorship" is a work created by 2 or more authors and in which the contribution of each author is not separate from the contribution of the other author or the contributions of the other authors, but does not include a collective work.{{sfn|Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 ... Vanuatu|p=5}} 
For a collective work (other than an work of applied art) and an audiovisual work protection extends for 50 years on and after the date on which the work: was made; or first made available to the public; first published; whichever date is the latest.{{sfn|Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 ... Vanuatu|p=12}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2635">'''Consular courts''' were law courts established by foreign powers in countries where they had [[extraterritoriality|extraterritorial rights]]. They were presided over by consular officers.  

==Extraterritoriality==
[[File:United States Consular Court Constantinople.png|thumb|Trying a divorce suit in the United States Consular Court at [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], 1922]]
Western powers when establishing diplomatic relations with countries they considered to have underdeveloped legal systems would demand [[extraterritorial rights]].  Treaty provisions provided that the laws of the local country did not apply to citizens of the treaty powers and that local courts did not have jurisdiction over them.  Consular courts were established to handle civil and criminal cases against citizens and subjects of the subjects of the country.&lt;ref&gt;C Lobingier, Extraterritorial Cases, Vol I, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–5&lt;/ref&gt;   The British had the widest system of consular courts run by the [[Foreign Office]].   British consular courts could be found in Africa, the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Egypt]], China, Japan, Korea and Siam.&lt;ref&gt;Turan Kayaoğlu, Legal Imperialism, Sovereignty and Extraterritoriality in Japan, the Ottoman Empire, and China&lt;/ref&gt;

==China and Japan==

In China and Japan under the "[[unequal treaty|unequal treaties]]" signed in the mid-19th century many countries established consular courts in cities open to foreign trade (called [[treaty ports]]).   

Britain established a fully fledged court system in China and Japan.  In 1865, the [[British Supreme Court for China and Japan]] was established in [[Shanghai International Settlement|Shanghai]], China as a first instance consular court for cases in the Shanghai region as well as an appellate court for cases heard by consular courts in the rest of China, Japan and, from the 1880s Korea.   In 1879, a British Court for Japan was established in [[Yokohama]] to replace the Kanagawa Consular Court to hear first instance cases for Yokohama region as well as to act as an appellate court for cases from consular courts in other Japanese cities.  

In Japan [[extraterritoriality]] came to an end on 4 August 1899 and the [[British Court for Japan]] and other consular courts closed soon after that after finalising pending cases.   

In 1906, the United States established the [[United States Court for China]] modelled on the [[British Supreme Court for China and Japan]].

In China, consular courts operated up until the 1940s when [[extraterritoriality]] for most nations came to an end then.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3606">The '''Consultative Assembly''' ({{lang-fr|Assemblée Consultative}}) of [[Luxembourg]] was established in 1945 towards the end of [[World War II]], when it became clear that the [[Chamber of Deputies (Luxembourg)|Chamber of Deputies]] could not fulfill its constitutional role. The point of the Consultative Assembly was to exercise those rights accorded to the Chamber by the constitution and laws, with the exception of legislative powers.&lt;ref&gt;''Arrêté grand-ducal du 22 février 1945 ayant pour objet l´institution d'une assemblée consultative'', published in [http://www.legilux.public.lu/leg/a/archives/1945/0008/a008.pdf#page=1 Mémorial Nr 8 of 27 February 1945, p. 65]{{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II ended in Luxembourg on 10 September 1944, a session of the Chamber was called for 6 December 1944. Out of the 55 Deputies of the pre-war Chamber, only 25 were present. 9 Deputies had died, 10 were still in German prisons or [[concentration camp]]s, and 9 were under suspicion of collaboration with the German occupation. As fewer than half the Deputies were there, there was no [[quorum]], as demanded by the constitution. Therefore, the Chamber was not capable of functioning and taking decisions. 

At the urging of the [[Unio'n]], the umbrella organisation of the Resistance, a Consultative Assembly was established by Grand-Ducal decree on 22 February 1945, in order for the [[Liberation Government (Luxembourg)|Liberation Government]] to be advised in its duties. The members of the Assembly were appointed by another decree on 12 March 1945. It started its activities just days after the last Luxembourgish villages, near Echternach, had been liberated.  

From 20 March 1945 to 16 August 1945, 18 sessions of the Assembly took place.

The '''Decree of Nectanebo I''' was issued by Pharaoh [[Nectanebo I]] of the [[Thirtieth dynasty of Egypt|30th dynasty]] of [[Ancient Egypt]]. It regards payments to the local temple, and was recorded on two [[steles]].

The location of the temple was near the [[Canopus, Egypt|Canopic branch]] of the [[Nile River]], in the eastern [[Nile Delta]] of [[Lower Egypt]]. Accordingly, steles were erected at two locations as statements to curry political favor with the priesthood, and possibly the populace.

The twin steles are identical in 14 columns of hieroglyphs except in column 13, where the stele's location is named. The steles were erected shortly after Nectanebo came to power, ca 380 BC.

==Stele description==
The stele's purpose was to use a 10 percent portion of the waterway-use tax (unspecified import tax) for the services of the priests in charge of the temples of the goddess [[Neith]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.franckgoddio.org/Sitemap/Project/ProjectArticel.aspx?ProjectName=CanopicRegion&amp;Layout=B&amp;XmlDocument=0002.xml Heracleion, Decree of Nectanebo I]&lt;/ref&gt;

A finely engraved  [[lunette]] adorns the upper third of the steles; the engravings and hieroglyphs are all incised in moderate sunken [[bas relief]]. The lunette focusses on two versions of the Goddess Neith, being offered a food offering on the right, and a [[usekh collar]] on the left, by the presenter Nectanebo.

==History of the steles==
The first stele, the '''Stele of Naukratis''' was uncovered at [[Naukratis]] in 1899, and was subsequently translated.

Only recently, its twin stele was recovered from the underwater site of [[Heracleion]], an ancient Egyptian city that was discovered by archaeologists in 2000. Heracleion was also located on the Canopic branch of the Nile.

Herakleion is also mentioned on the steles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/online_research_catalogues/ng/naukratis_greeks_in_egypt/introduction/naukratis_a_city_and_port.aspx Naukratis: a city and trading port in Egypt], British Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Disney on Parade''', was a series of touring [[arena]] [[stage show|stage shows]] produced by NAWAL Productions, a [[joint venture]] between [[NBC]] and [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]]. Aimed primarily at children and families, the shows featured live performers portraying the roles of Disney characters in performances derived from various Disney films.

==History==
The initial idea for ''Disney on Parade'' was convinced by Thomas Sarnoff, youngest son of Robert Sarnoff. The elder Sarnoff had served as the president of NBC and CEO of [[RCA]]. &lt;ref name=Kober&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kober|first1=Jeff|title=Leading Disney on Parade|url=https://www.mouseplanet.com/8678/Leading_Disney_on_Parade|date=January 22, 2009|accessdate=August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;NBC at the time aired Walt Disney Productions' [[Walt Disney anthology television series|weekly anthology series]]. To produce the show, Disney teamed with the network to create NAWAL Productions, with NBC being the [[general partner]] and Disney the limited partner.

Following a trial run in [[Long Beach, California]], the first edition of ''Disney on Parade'' launched in [[Chicago, Illinois]] on December 25, 1969 and was an instant success. However, the show suffered from an overabundance of props, inexperienced performers, high costs and a run time of nearly three hours, so NBC replaced producer [[Bob Jani]] with Michel M. Grilikhes, who made effective changes, including rearranging or removing acts, to reduce costs and time without affecting the show's quality. Grilikhes, affectionately known to the cast and crew as "Mr. G", would executive-produce and direct further editions of ''Disney on Parade''.&lt;ref name=Kober&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kober|first1=Jeff|title=Leading Disney on Parade|url=https://www.mouseplanet.com/8678/Leading_Disney_on_Parade|date=January 22, 2009|accessdate=August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four editions of ''Disney on Parade'', each with a different set of acts, would tour across the United States and around the world, including runs in South America, Europe, Asia and Australia; a performance in [[Adelaide, Australia]] was videotaped and broadcast as a one-hour special on NBC's ''The Wonderful World of Disney'' in December 1971. By 1976, the shows ceased performing internationally.

==Format==
Each edition of ''Disney on Parade'' typically began with [[Mickey Mouse]] and a cavalcade of Disney characters dancing on the stage and personally greeting members of the audience. The show would then present lavish musical segments, depicting characters and scenes from Disney films, alongside smaller comedy routines with characters like [[Donald Duck]], [[Goofy]] and [[Herbie|Herbie the Love Bug]]. Finally, the characters appeared together for a grand finale and bid the audience farewell. Each show was divided into two acts with one 15-minute [[intermission]].

The arena stages typically sported a giant [[curtain]], from which characters and sets would emerge, and a circular motion picture screen that would present clips from Disney features and shorts at the beginning of major acts.

==Reception==
''Disney on Parade'' was well-received by audiences and critics. The first edition's run at [[Madison Square Garden]] made a record $400,000 in advanced ticket sales, and a run in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]] booked 77,255 people in nine days, some 38% of the population. It later toured Europe, Australia, Asia and Latin America, making $64 million worldwide.&lt;ref name=Kober/&gt;

== Technical details ==
The technique works by using different [[Domain name|domain names]] at different layers of communication. The domain name of an innocuous site is used to initialize the connection. This domain name is exposed to the censor in [[Plaintext|clear-text]] as part of the [[Domain Name System|DNS request]] and the [[Server Name Indication|TLS Server Name Indication]]. The domain name of the actual, blocked endpoint is only communicated after the establishment of an encrypted HTTPS connection, in the [[List of HTTP header fields|HTTP Host header]], making it invisible to censors. This can be done if the blocked and the innocuous sites are both hosted by the same large provider, such as [[Google App Engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/12/21/signal-egypt-uae-censorship-block-domain-fronting/|title=Encrypted chat app Signal circumvents government censorship|website=Engadget|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/12/encryption-app-signal-fights-censorship-clever-workaround/|title=Encryption App ‘Signal’ Is Fighting Censorship With a Clever Workaround|last=Greenberg|first=Andy|newspaper=WIRED|access-date=2017-01-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.attackzero.net/2015/11/domain-fronting-and-you.html?m=1|title=Domain Fronting and You|website=blog.attackzero.net|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For any given domain name, censors are typically unable to differentiate circumvention traffic from legitimate traffic. As such, they are forced to either allow all traffic to the domain name, including circumvention traffic, or block the domain name entirely, which may result in expensive collateral damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek|title=doc/meek – Tor Bug Tracker &amp; Wiki|website=trac.torproject.org|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://whispersystems.org/blog/doodles-stickers-censorship/|title=Open Whisper Systems &gt;&gt; Blog &gt;&gt; Doodles, stickers, and censorship circumvention for Signal Android|website=whispersystems.org|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==
In the "Factual and Procedural Background" section of its ruling, the appellate court found the following facts:

Between 1997 and 2001, former police officer Gene Colello received treatment from David Goldstein.  One of reasons for seeking treatment was the depression that Colello was experiencing after breaking up with his girlfriend and learning that she had become involved with Keith Ewing. In June 2001, Colello told his father that he was "considering causing harm" to Ewing.  Colello's father relayed this statement to Goldstein. Goldstein encouraged Colello's [[voluntary hospitalization]], which was done.  When learning that Colello was going to be discharged from the hospital the next day, Goldstein urged the hospital psychiatrist to reconsider that decision.  The hospital discharged Colello and, one day later, he murdered Ewing and then committed suicide.

Ewing's parents brought suit against Goldstein (as well as Collello's parents and the hospital psychiatrist) alleging professional negligence for failing to warn either Ewing or law-enforcement agencies about the "risk of harm his patient posed to their son's safety".

==Ruling==
The court ruled that the case should be heard by the lower court. They determined that the duty to protect was not sufficiently discharged by initiating involuntary commitment and could be discharged only by warning the identifiable victims.

==Implications==
This case created a clear distinction between the duty to protect and the subordinate [[duty to warn]] and made communications by a third party indicating threatening statements equivalent to statements made directly by that person.

'''''Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Peabody''''' was a 1994 [[High Court of Australia]] tax case concerning certain transactions made by the Peabody family business.  The [[Australian Taxation Office]] (ATO) sought to apply the [[Income Tax Assessment Act 1936#Part IVA|Part IVA]]
general anti-avoidance provisions of the
[[Income Tax Assessment Act 1936]].

The case was decided in favour of the taxpayer Mary Peabody, on the slightly technical grounds that there wasn't a reasonable expectation she would have received the income in question (from the family trust) in the year and under the interpretation asserted by the ATO.

The significance of the case today, and the reason it's frequently cited, is principally its place in judicial interpretation of Part IVA.  The ATO in particular didn't regard the case as a complete loss, they took remarks in the judgements as confirming their interpretation of that legislation.

== Transaction ==

The Peabody family and Ray Kleinschmidt owned a business producing [[fly ash]], also known as [[pozzolan]], used in [[concrete]].  It was a set of four companies, called the Pozzolanic Group.  Kleinschmidt owned 38%, and the Peabody family owned 62%, through a family trust.  The trustee was a company of which husband and wife Terence and Mary Peabody were directors, and the beneficiaries were Mary Peabody and their two sons.

Terence Peabody had planned for some time to buy Kleinschmidt's share then float 50% of the total business on the [[Australian Stock Exchange]].  In late 1985 he and Kleinschmidt reached an agreement where Kleinschmidt would sell his shares for $8.6 million, an amount which was based on a business valuation and which was to remain confidential.  Instead of Terence Peabody or the family trust buying out Kleinschmidt directly, the transaction was structured as follows.

The Peabody trust bought a [[shelf company]] called Loftway and Kleinschmidt sold his shares to it for the agreed $8.6 million.  The Peabodys (now 100% owners) then had the Pozzolanic group companies convert those shares to "Z class" and restrict their rights, rendering them worthless.  The shares the Peabody trust owned were then all that remained, a 100% interest in the business (apart from a few owned by Terence Peabody in his own name).

The money to pay Kleinschmidt was provided by [[Westpac Bank]] subscribing for $8.6 million worth of Loftway preference shares.  The [[interest]] on them was obtained from the Pozzolanic companies paying [[dividend]]s to Loftway, which in turn paid dividends to Westpac.  The capital was repaid after the float when the Peabody trust lent $8.6 million from the float proceeds to Loftway in order for it to redeem Westpac's shares.  That loan was subsequently forgiven by the trust.

This indirect structure had three apparent purposes,

* Kleinschmidt's shares "disappeared", so when Pozzolanic floated it was not necessary to disclose how much Kleinschmidt was paid.  This had two motivations,
** It respected Kleinschmidt's wish for confidentiality.
** It wouldn't make the new investors wonder why they were being asked to pay a higher price after just a short period of time.  Kleinschmidt's sale valued the total business at $24 million, the float price valued it at $30 million.
* If the Peabody trust bought shares from Kleinschmidt then sold them to the public, it would have incurred [[Capital gains tax in Australia|capital gains tax]] on the price difference.
* The money borrowed (from Westpac) to pay Kleinschmidt could be obtained at lesser cost by paying interest with dividends, because dividends were eligible for intercorporate rebates in Westpac's hands.

The last point is a little unclear.  Perhaps it was that Loftway's ownership of Pozzolanic shares was not an income producing purpose, so plain interest payments would not be tax deductible.  If so then that would be in a sense a consequence of using Loftway, rather than an independent rationale for the structure.

== Assessment and court ==

The [[Australian Taxation Office]] (ATO) took the view that the mechanism was a [[tax avoidance]] scheme, a scheme which came under [[Income Tax Assessment Act 1936#Part IVA|Part IVA]] of the ''[[Income Tax Assessment Act 1936]]''.  The ATO treated the transaction as Kleinschmidt selling to the Peabody trust, and then on-selling to the public in the float, making a profit of the difference.  This was a capital gain, and the 1/3 of that attributable to Mary Peabody as trust beneficiary was $888,005.  The ATO added that to her return for the year ending 30 June 1986.

Mary Peabody lodged an objection to the ATO assessment, which the ATO disallowed.  She then asked the ATO to refer it to the [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] (as any taxpayer may do).  Her argument was that the transaction was structured as it was for the commercial reasons of confidentiality and the cost of financing, as described above.

Justice O'Loughlin in the [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] agreed with the ATO that the devaluation to Z-class shares was a scheme, and considered the argument about non-disclosure to be a "red herring".

Mrs Peabody appealed to the full bench of the court, and they instead considered the transfer, financing and float together, and found for her.  The ATO went to the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]], which upheld the full bench decision.

'''''Gallagher v. Crown Kosher Super Market of Massachusetts, Inc.''''', 366 U.S. 617 (1961), is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case that declared that a [[kosher]] butcher store had to abide by the state laws that banned them from selling on Sunday.

==Background==
The owners of the Crown Kosher Super Market of Massachusetts were [[Orthodox Jews]] whose religion forbids them to shop or sell [[Shabbat|from sundown on Friday until sundown on Saturday]] and requires them to eat only [[kosher foods|kosher food]], were keeping their store open on Sunday at times when it was against the Massachusetts state law.

The lawsuit was in a [[Federal District Court]] to make certain sections of the [[Massachusetts]] Sunday Closing Laws [[unconstitutional]]. Specifically, "the selling or delivering of kosher meat by any person who, according to his religious belief, observes Saturday as the [[Lord's day]] by closing his place of business during the day until six o'clock in the afternoon, or the keeping open of his shop on the Lord's day for the sale of kosher meat between the hours of six o'clock and ten o'clock in the forenoon."

The store had formerly been open for business all day on Sundays and had done about a third of its weekly business then. It was closed from sundown on Fridays until sundown on Saturdays. The store had claimed that it was economically impractical for it to keep open on Saturday nights and until 10 a.m. on Sundays. Many who bought at the store would not have been able to get meat from Friday afternoon until Monday.

==Counsel of Record==

[[ACLU]] Side: Herbert B. Ehrmann, with Samuel L. Fein on the brief.

Opposing Side: Joseph H. Elcock, Jr., Asst. [[Attorney General of Massachusetts]]. With him on the brief were [[Edward J. McCormack, Jr.]], John Warren McGarry, [[Arthur E. Sutherland, Jr.]], and S. Thomas Martinelli.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aclu.procon.org/view.additional-resource.php?resourceID=003326 See case summary and details on the ProCon site.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion of the Court==
The court 6-3 approved the [[state law]], due to the laws not being exclusively religious.
"An examination of recent [[Massachusetts]] legislative history bolsters the State's position that these statutes are not religious.

"In general, Sunday laws protect the public by guaranteeing one day in seven to provide a period of rest and quiet. [[Health]], [[peace]] and good order of society are thereby promoted. Such provision is essentially civil in character, and the statutes are not regarded as religious ordinances."

Also on the issue of free exercise of religion they stated: "Secondly, appellees Orthodox Jewish customers allege that, because their religious beliefs forbid their shopping on the Jewish Sabbath, the statutes' effect is to deprive them, from Friday afternoon until Monday of each week, of the opportunity to purchase the kosher food sanctioned by their faith. The orthodox [[rabbi]]s allege that the statutes' effect greatly complicates their task of supervising the condition of kosher meat, because the meat delivered on Friday would have to be kept until Monday. Furthermore, appellees contend that, because of all this, the statutes discriminate against their religion.

These allegations are similar, although not as grave, as those made by appellants in ''[[Braunfeld v. Brown]]'', ante, p. 366 U.S. 599. Since the decision in that case rejects the contentions presented by these appellees on the merits, we need not decide whether appellees have standing to raise these questions."

Justices [[William O. Douglas]], [[William J. Brennan, Jr.]] and [[Potter Stewart]] dissented from the opinion.

==Subsequent developments==
This was one of the four cases decided in 1961 that declared [[blue law]]s to be [[constitutional]]. The other three were ''[[Braunfeld v. Brown]]'', ''Two Guys from Harrison-Allentown, Inc., v. McGinley''&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Two_Guys_from_Harrison-Allentown,_Inc._v._McGinley Case in Wikisource]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[McGowan v. Maryland]]''

'''GeBIZ''' is a [[Government-to-business]] (G2B) [[Public eProcurement]] business centre where suppliers can conduct [[electronic commerce]] with the [[Singapore]] Government. All of the public sector's invitations for quotations and tenders (except for security-sensitive contracts) are posted on GeBIZ. Suppliers can search for government procurement opportunities, retrieve relevant procurement documentations and submit their bids online.

== History ==
Singapore's GeBIZ, or the Government Electronic Business Centre, was set up in June 2000 to simplify government procurement and tender activities. It was part of the programmes for businesses under the e-Government Action Plan (eGAP I) (2000–2003) in Singapore.&lt;ref name=eGAP&gt;{{cite web|title=e-Government Action Plan I|url=http://www.egov.gov.sg/egov-masterplans/egap-i/programmes|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905083529/http://www.egov.gov.sg/egov-masterplans/egap-i/programmes|archivedate=2011-09-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a one-stop centre for suppliers to have access to all procurement opportunities in the public sector and to trade electronically with the government, GeBIZ would create an entry point for businesses to access G2B services in an enterprise-centric manner instead of an agency-centric manner.&lt;ref name=IDB&gt;{{cite web|title=The Singapore E-Government Procurement Experience|url=http://idbdocs.iadb.org/wsdocs/getdocument.aspx?docnum=2258378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
The end-to-end public e-procurement [[solution]] acts a stimulus to the development of e-commerce in Singapore. On one hand, public agencies enjoy the benefits of making electronic purchases of commonly used items; on the other hand, suppliers and tender bidders enjoy broader access to government tenders and quotations.&lt;ref name=UNDP-APDIP&gt;{{cite book|title=E-Government|year=2003|url=http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/E-government|author=Patricia J. Pascual|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a platform supports the procurement regime that is underpinned by the following fundamental principles:&lt;ref name="Singapore Procurement Regime"&gt;{{cite web|title=Value for Money in Singapore's Government Procurement Regime|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTECACOSUPROC/Resources/776023-1271709540888/Singapore-Govt-Proc-Regime.pdf|author=Civil Service College, Singapore|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Transparency;
:* Fair and Open Competition; and
:* Value for Money

Beyond direct efficiency and cost savings, having a common [[e-procurement]] system for the entire public sector in Singapore resulted in transactions that accordance with government procurement policies (including [[World Trade Organization|World Trade Organisation]] - Agreement to Government Procurement).&lt;ref name=IDB /&gt;

Other than having clear and comprehensive regulations (including legal and institutional framework) for the conduct of public procurement, it is also noted that GeBIZ enables greater transparency as all procurement operations, beginning with the announcement of a tender to the awarding of the contract, are published online.&lt;ref name=UNDP-APDIP /&gt; As such, local citizens and entrepreneurs benefit from the Singapore government's one-stop e-procurement portal since it helps level the competition to allow small and medium businesses to compete with established vendors whenever an agency issues an invitation to quote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnetasia.com/strong-e-govt-services-startup-support-define-spore-it-62301560.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Innovations ==
The e-procurement platform used in Singapore has been commercialised by [[IDA International]].&lt;ref name=Market-GeBIZ&gt;{{cite web|title=GeBIZ platform to be marketed|url=http://www.enterpriseinnovation.net/content/crimsonlogic-ida-international-partner-market-gebiz-platform}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new commercialised GeBIZ platform will serve as a one-stop e-business solution tool that will facilitate trading between organisations and their local and overseas suppliers.

For non-government agencies and business that want to adopt the Singapore Government's procurement best practices, the new GeBIZ platform will operate on a Software-as-a-Service platform, enabling businesses to pay according to specified preferences.&lt;ref name=Market-GeBIZ /&gt;

The '''Gender Expression Non-Discrimination Act''' ('''GENDA''') is a proposed New York law which adds gender identity and [[Gender expression]] as a protected class in the state's human rights and [[hate crime]]s laws, prohibiting discrimination in employment, housing, public accommodations and other areas, and providing enhanced penalties for bias-motivated crimes. It was first introduced in both the Assembly and Senate in 2003&lt;ref&gt;2003 Bill Numbers: A8319 ([[Richard N. Gottfried|Gottfried]])/S4457 (Duane)&lt;/ref&gt; and has been passed for the 8th time in the Assembly since 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2014/06/n-y-state-assembly-passes-gender-expression-non-discrimination-act-again/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/breaking-new-york-state-assembly-passes-gender-expression-non-discrimination-act/politics/2014/06/10/88972]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silver, Sheldon, News Release, Assembly Approves Gender Expression Non-Discrimination Act, 2012-04-30&lt;/ref&gt; but has never come to a vote on the floor of the [[New York State Senate|State Senate]]. It was promoted as a priority of [[Empire State Pride Agenda]], which previously promoted the [[Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Act|SONDA]] law, which was enacted into law in 2003.

==History==
GENDA has been introduced in nearly every legislative session in New York since it was first introduced in 2003.

In 2009, Senator [[Thomas Duane]] introduced the bill to the 2009-2010 session of the New York Senate.&lt;ref name="09-11 Senate"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2009/s2406/amendment/a |title=Senate Bill S2406A |publisher=[[New York State Senate]] |accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bill was referred to the Committee on Investigations and Government Operations on 19 February 2009 and then to the Committee on the Judiciary on 21 May 2010.&lt;ref name="09-11 Senate"/&gt;  On 8 June 2010, the bill was defeated in the Judiciary Committee by a vote of 11-12.&lt;ref name="09-11 Senate"/&gt;

In 2012, New York State Senator [[Daniel Squadron]] introduced the bill to the 2011-2012 session of the New York Senate.&lt;ref name ="12-13 Senate"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2011/s6349/amendment/original |title=Senate Bill S6349 |publisher=[[New York State Senate]] |accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Senator Duane had resigned earlier that year. The bill was referred to the Committee on Investigations and Government Operations on 31 January 2012 and then to the Committee on Rules on 16 Mar 2012, where it did not receive a vote.&lt;ref name ="12-13 Senate"/&gt;

== Separation of Space for Transgender People  ==
Actress, producer and transgender advocate [[Laverne Cox]] has traveled to Albany, N.Y. in March 2013 to speak with New York State legislators to encourage them to pass GENDA. One major concern has been bathroom safety, and whether or not transgender people should have access to sex-segregated spaces that are consistent with their gender identities. In Rochester and Albany N.Y., there have been no instances of a transgender person abusing the law and using a segregated bathroom or locker room to harass or perform illegal acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Laverne|title=Transgender Freedom Riders: The Fight for Transgender Equality in New York State|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/laverne-cox/transgender-freedom-riders-the-fight-for-transgender-equality-in-new-york-state_b_3129833.html|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=2014-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Government of India v Taylor''''' [1955] AC 491 (sometimes called '''''Re Delhi Electric Supply &amp; Traction Co Ltd''''') is a judicial decision of the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] relating to the enforceability of foreign tax claims under [[English law]].  The House of Lords unanimously upheld the general rule at [[common law]] that [[Rule against foreign revenue enforcement|foreign tax claims]] are non-justiciable in England under the [[Act of state doctrine]].  Accordingly, a claim with respect to foreign taxes was not an admissible claim in the [[liquidation]] of a United Kingdom company.  The English courts may not, directly or indirectly, enforce the tax claims of another sovereign state.&lt;ref name=Dicey&gt;{{cite book|title=''[[Dicey Morris &amp; Collins|Dicey Morris and Collins on the Conflict of Laws]]''|publisher=[[Sweet &amp; Maxwell]] |edition=14th |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-421-88360-4|at=para 5R-019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cheshire&gt;{{cite book|title=Cheshire &amp; North's Private International Law|author=P.M. North and J.J. Fawcett |publisher=Butterworths |edition=12th |year=1992 |isbn=0406530815 |page=114 |quote=Although it has been generally accepted, at any rate since the time of Lord Mansfield, that no action lies in England for the enforcement of a foreign revenue law, authority for the proposition long remained a little nebulous ... All doubts were, however, stilled in 1955 by the decision of the House of Lords in ''Government of India v Taylor''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==
The Delhi Electric Supply &amp; Traction Co Ltd was an English company which was formed in 1906.  It was incorporated for the purpose of operating an electricity supply and tramway under an operating licence granted by the [[Municipal Corporation of Delhi|Municipality of Delhi]].  The company carried on business in India until approximately 1947 when it sold the whole of its undertakings to the [[Government of India]] on 2 March 1947.&lt;ref name=Cheshire /&gt;  On 18 April 1947 India passed the Indian Income Tax and Excess Profits Tax (Amendment) Act 1947.  On 25 May 1949 the company went into [[voluntary liquidation]].  Samuel Taylor and John Lovering&lt;ref&gt;Lovering would later die, and on 9 July 1953 was replaced by William Hume as joint liquidator&lt;/ref&gt; were appointed as [[liquidator (law)|liquidators]], having previously acted as [[board of directors|directors]] of the company.  On 24 October 1951 the Commissioner of Income Tax at Delhi served a notice claiming tax on the surplus from the sale of undertaking.&lt;ref&gt;[1955] AC 491 at 492-493&lt;/ref&gt;

The liquidators rejected the claim, and sought directions from the court as to whether the claim was an admissible claim in the liquidation.

==Decision==

The case came before [[Harry Vaisey|Vaisey J]] at first instance who dismissed the claim.  That decision was upheld by the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] ([[Raymond Evershed, 1st Baron Evershed|Lord Evershed MR]], [[David Jenkins, Baron Jenkins|Jenkins LJ]] and [[John Morris, Baron Morris of Borth-y-Gest|Morris LJ]]).  The Government of India then appealed to the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]].

All five members of the House of Lords were unanimous that the claim must fail.  Viscount Simonds gave the lead judgment.  He commenced his speech by saying "My Lords, I will admit that I was greatly surprised to hear it suggested that the courts of this country would and should entertain a suit by a foreign State to recover a tax."  He summarised the general prohibition at common law, citing various earlier cases on point, including ''King of Hellenes v Broston'' (1923) 16 Ll L Rep 190, ''Re Visser'' [1928] Ch 877 and ''Sydney Municipal Council v Bull'' [1909] 1 KB 7.  Having cited the general rule, he then discussed the two alternative grounds upon which counsel for the Government of India was arguing that an exception should be made:
* Firstly, that as India was a realm under the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], recognising the Queen as head of state, it should not be treated in the same way as other wholly foreign countries; and
* Secondly, that the general rule applied to natural persons and personal claims - neither consideration should apply to a company in winding-up, which is required to make provision for all claims made against it.

Viscount Simonds rejected both arguments, describing them as "frail weapons with which to attack a strong fortress".&lt;ref&gt;[1955] AC 491 at 506&lt;/ref&gt;  He noted that the general common law had tacit Parliamentary approval in the passing of the [[Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1933]], section 1(2)(b).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/23-24/13|title=Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1933|accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He ultimately summarily rejected both arguments.

Lord Keith gave a short concurring judgment, specifically endorsing the recent judgment in ''Peter Buchanan Ltd v McVey'' [1954] Ir 89&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uniset.ca/other/taylor/1955AC516.html |title=''Peter Buchanan Ltd v McVey'' (21 July 1950)|accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (unreported at the time).

Lord Somervell also gave a short concurring speech, affirming the general statement of [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield CJ]] in ''[[Holman v Johnson]]'' (1775) 1 Cowp 341 at 343 that "no country ever takes notice of the revenue laws of another."  He then went on to state that "after considerable research no case of any country could be found in which taxes due to State A had been enforced in the courts of State B."

==Authority==

''Government of India v Taylor'' remains good law today.  It forms the central basis of Rule 3 of [[Dicey Morris &amp; Collins]] on ''The Conflict of Laws'', and is one of the primary authorities cited in support of that rule:

{{cquote|'''RULE 3 - English courts have no jurisdiction to entertain an action (1) for the enforcement, either directly or indirectly, of a penal, revenue or other public law of a foreign State; or (2) founded upon an act of state.'''&lt;ref name=Dicey /&gt;}}

However it has been qualified by subsequent authorities.  In ''QRS 1 Aps v Frandsen'' [1999] 1 WLR 2169 it was held that to uphold a contractual indemnity for the payment of taxes would not constitute indirect enforcement of a foreign tax claim.

It has also been noted that in practice the effect of the rule is widely circumvented by international treaties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1107&amp;context=djcil|title=The Revenue Rule: A Common Law Doctrine For The Twenty First Century|author=Brenda Mallinak|publisher=Duke Journal of Comparative &amp; International Law|accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''High Times Freedom Fighters''' was a [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] legalization group started by ''[[High Times]]'' Editor-in-Chief [[Steven Hager]] in 1987. The group was famous for marching into marijuana rallies dressed in psychedelic Colonial-style outfits while playing drums. They injected some life into what had become a slowly dying legalization movement. They forged a new generation of activists, and created a number of events around the country, the largest being the Boston [[Freedom Rally]], which drew 100,000 people to Boston Common in the 1990s. The Freedom Fighters published a national newsletter for four years edited by Linda Noel (who also founded the Boston Freedom Rally). The Freedom Fighters also created free kitchens at the summer National [[Rainbow Family]] Gatherings, and the winter Regional Gatherings in [[Ocala, Florida|Ocala]], [[Florida]].

In 1990, ''High Times'' released the documentary film ''Let Freedom Ring'', detailing the activities of the group. The film was directed by Bob Brandel and featured music by the original Soul Assassins. In 1993, the mailing list was given to the [[NORML]] and the organization was disbanded. Members of the group went on to create The Cannabis Action Network and The Green Panthers, among other groups. Even after the group disbanded, ''High Times'' continued to name a Freedom Fighter of the Month in every issue of the magazine, as well as an annual Freedom Fighter of the Year, who was always crowned at the [[Cannabis Cup]] in Amsterdam.

According to Steven Hager's Myspace blog:
&lt;blockquote&gt;John Howell hired me as ''High Times'' executive editor around 1987. For amusement I started writing a column called "Ed Hassle" in the news section. The column was a parody of "[[Ed Anger]]," a hilarious right-winger who was appearing in the Weekly World News. Ed Anger columns were being read over the airwaves by my favorite deejay, Bill Kelly of WFMU. But instead of being a rightwing lunatic, my Ed Hassle was a hippie fascist who grew pot and believed in alien abductions. I eventually worked the concept into a cartoon strip drawn by Flick Ford. One day ''High Times'' got an invitation to the Hash Bash in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]. Apparently the event was about to die, and some local stoners were hoping ''High Times'' could help resurrect it. Ed Hassle made a plea for all marijuana activists to attend the Hash Bash in Ann Arbor to hold a convention to create a national group called the Freedom Fighters. Hassle suggesting bringing drums and dressing in Colonial-style outfits. (This was a publicity ploy for news cameras and opened the door for interviews about hemp in Colonial times.) My band, The Soul Assassins, drove to the event in a psychedelic bus, marched into the Diag at the [[University of Michigan]] with a fife and drum corps of psychedelic pirates. That night, the Soul Assassins performed to a standing room crowd at a local bar. The Freedom Fighters organized free campgrounds for many rallies and provided free food to activists. The biggest supporter was a West Virginian named Rodger Belknap, who was also the first person to be voted Freedom Fighter of the Year. Eventually it became clear the group had been targeted for surveillance and many leaders dropped out while others were railroaded into jail with unusually harsh sentences, including Rodger Belknap.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;After the Freedom Fighters were about a year old, I decided to drop the "Ed Hassle" persona because it had gotten confused with another ''High Times'' columnist, Ed Rosenthal. In order to re-write the history off the origins of the group, I asked my friend Allegra to interview me for my own magazine. Unfortunately, the interview was perceived as signs of a messianic power trip and very quickly led to serious problems. I'd naively set out to throw a party and suddenly found myself in the center of a cultural tidal wave. The pressure got so intense I turned the Freedom Fighter mailing list over to NORML, and that was the end of the Freedom Fighters and also the end of any attempts at political activism or organizing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36979">'''Inheritance and gift taxes in Canada''' have a complex history dating back to [[Canadian Confederation]]. They are beginning to see a return to prominence in the provincial sphere.

==Provincial succession duties==
[[Inheritance|Succession]] duties have been held to be valid "direct taxation within the province," and can apply in the following scenarios:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Attorney General of British Columbia v. Canada Trust Co. et al.|link=|year=1980|court=scc|num=221|format=canlii|pinpoint=pp. 485{{en dash}}486|parallelcite=[1980] 2 SCR 466|date=1980-06-27|courtname=auto|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#property of a deceased person, whether he was at the time of his death domiciled in the Province or domiciled elsewhere, situate within the Province passing to any person for any beneficial interest
#property of a deceased situate outside the Province at the time of the death of the deceased, and the beneficiary of any of the property of the deceased was a resident at the time of the death of the deceased
#where the deceased person was at the time of his death domiciled in the Province, and where the property of the deceased comprises any personal property situate without the Province in respect of which any beneficial interest passes under the law of the Province to a person who is domiciled or resident in the Province

Succession duties came into effect in the various provinces at the following times:

Many incidents involving [[double taxation]] arose from liability to duty in different provinces, as well as other jurisdictions abroad, which were dealt with inconsistently among the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Goodman|first= Wolfe D.|date= 1974|title= International and Interprovincial Death Duty and Gift Tax Problems|url= http://digitalcommons.osgoode.yorku.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2599&amp;context=ohlj|journal= [[Osgoode Hall Law Journal]]|volume= 12|issue= 1|pages= 191{{en dash}}205|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ontario was especially notable in its pursuit of duties. [[Mitchell Hepburn]], in his capacity as [[Treasurer of Ontario]], adopted a more aggressive approach in their collection on large estates, which resulted in millions of dollars in extra government revenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Mitchell F. Hepburn, Ontario ex-premier dies|pages = 1, 3|newspaper= [[Toronto Daily Star]]|date= January 5, 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made no apologies for doing so, as he noted in a speech in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech |title=Present Day Problems |author=Mitchell Hepburn |date=December 15, 1938 |location=[[Empire Club of Canada]] |url=http://speeches.empireclub.org/60541/data?n=1 |accessdate=October 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, legislation was passed that allowed for reexamination of estates for deaths that had occurred back to the beginning of 1916, and also included many gifts ''[[inter vivos]]'' within the duty's scope.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title = The Succession Duty Amendment Act, 1937|abbr = S.O.|year = 1937|chapter = 3|link = https://archive.org/stream/statutesofprovin1937onta#page/8/mode/2up|linkloc = archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hepburn consequently ordered that all files relating to estates worth $500,000 or more, together with those of smaller estates where evasion was suspected, were to be reopened, with the expectation of raising further duties anywhere from $70 million to $100 million.&lt;ref name="McEachernFP1938"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ontario's Death Duty Inquisition|first = R.A.|last= McEachern|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PWg_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7lMMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4168,578348&amp;dq=hepburn+succession+duty+g:loccanada&amp;hl=en|newspaper= [[Financial Post]]|date= January 22, 1938|pages = 11{{endash}}12|accessdate=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection tactics employed included the seizure of books and records without a warrant, different methods for valuing assets, and the assessment of penalties that could amount to double or triple the amount of the duty involved.&lt;ref name="McEachernFP1938"/&gt;

One estate of particular focus in this campaign was that of the late [[John Rudolphus Booth]], who had died in 1925. Although succession duties of $4.28 million were paid in 1927,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Claims Booth Duties Paid|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KplTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QzgNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1208,1689121&amp;dq=booth+succession+duty+g:loccanada&amp;hl=en|newspaper= [[Regina Leader-Post]]|date= September 18, 1937|accessdate=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hepburn subsequently claimed more in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Ontario Assembly Prorogues Today|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UXctAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qJgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6552,331650&amp;dq=hepburn+succession+duty+act+amendment+g:loccanada&amp;hl=en|newspaper= [[Montreal Gazette]]|date= December 3, 1937|accessdate=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Booth's heirs eventually paid another $3 million in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ottawa Estates Pay Additional Duties to Govt.|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZvIuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vNsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7028,1797999&amp;dq=booth+succession+duty+g:loccanada&amp;hl=en|newspaper= [[Ottawa Citizen]]|date= September 23, 1939|accessdate=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal estate taxes==
[[Image:James Lorimer Ilsley1.jpg|thumb|right| [[James Lorimer Ilsley]], Minister of Finance in 1941]]
Death taxes, which were not subject to the territorial limitations that affected provincial taxation, were first introduced at the federal level under the ''Dominion Succession Duty Act'' passed in 1941.({{lang-fr|Loi fédérale sur les droits successoraux}}) in 1941,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =The Dominion Succession Duty Act|abbr =S.C.|year =1940-41|chapter = 14|link= https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl194041v01cana#page/58/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his Budget speech that year, Minister of Finance [[James Lorimer Ilsley]] explained why the federal government was entering in this area of revenue:

{{cquote|
Death duties, in general, are a very good type of tax, second only to income tax in their essential fairness and the possibilities of adjusting them progressively to ability to pay. They are even better than income tax in so far as they do not have as much tendency to reduce an individual's incentive to hard work and initiative. It is reasonable and just that one should be able to provide something for his wife and children, and others, after his death. It is also reasonable and just, however, that the state should share in what one leaves, at a rate dependent upon the amount of wealth being transferred. Indeed, I find this view so generally held in this country that it is not necessary to do more than call it to mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |jurisdiction= Canada|title= The Budget|url= http://www.lop.parl.gc.ca/ParlInfo/Documents/Budgets/English/1941-04-29.pdf|house= House of Commons|date= April 29, 1941|page_start= 2349|page_end= 2350|speaker= James Lorimer Ilsley|position=Minister of Finance}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

It was later replaced by the ''Estate Tax Act'' ({{lang-fr|Loi de l'impôt sur les biens transmis par décès}}) in 1958,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =Estate Tax Act|abbr =S.C.|year =1958|chapter =29|link =https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl1958v01cana#page/190/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was repealed at the end of 1971.

The succession duty focused on the succession being transferred, as opposed to the estate itself,{{sfn|Pozer|1959|p=90}} which made it similar in scope to the UK's ''Succession Duty Act 1853''.{{sfn|Goodman|1998|p=1362}} The estate tax, in comparison, was modelled more along the line of the [[Estate tax in the United States|US estate tax]].{{sfn|Goodman|1998|p=1362}}

At the introduction of each tax, the property that was subject to each was identified as follows:
{{-}}
{| class="wikitable"

|style="text-align:left;"|every succession, being every past or future disposition of property by which another person obtains the beneficial interest in property or the income thereof, either immediately or after any interval, certainly or contingently, originally or by way of substantive limitation, including those operating by devolution of law||{{aye}} ||

==Gift tax==
[[Gift tax]] was introduced as part of [[R.B. Bennett]]'s New Deal in 1935. It was framed as an antiavoidance measure, as explained by [[Edgar Nelson Rhodes]] in that year's Budget speech:

{{cquote|
This form of tax, adopted by many countries, is being imposed primarily to operate as a deterrent to transfers of property as a gift, chiefly within family groups which would have the effect of reducing personal income to lower brackets and thus securing income tax assessments at rates lower than would otherwise be applicable. It is particularly expedient to introduce this measure at this time in view of the higher rates of taxation provided for in the new surtax on investment income. Not only should this tax put our income tax structure on a more secure foundation but it should operate in a like manner with regard to succession and inheritance taxes levied by the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |jurisdiction= Canada|title= The Budget|url= http://www.lop.parl.gc.ca/ParlInfo/Documents/Budgets/English/1935-03-22.pdf|house= House of Commons|date= March 22, 1935|page= 1986|speaker= Edgar Nelson Rhodes|position=Minister of Finance}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

As a consequence, it was imposed by the Parliament of Canada later that year as part of the ''Income War Tax Act''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =An Act to amend the Income War Tax Act|abbr =S.C.|year =1935|chapter =40|section =14|link=https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl1935v01cana#page/222/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tax was wide in its scope:&lt;ref&gt;IWTA, s. 88 (as inserted by the 1935 amendment)&lt;/ref&gt;

:* it applied to any property (whether situated inside or outside Canada) transferred by way of gift or donation
:* it applied "whether the transfer is in trust or otherwise, or direct or indirect, or whether the property is real or personal, tangible or intangible, and shall extend to gifts made by personal corporations"
:* several classes of gifts or donations were exempt from tax: those in any year that totalled $4000 or less; those taking effect upon death; those made to charitable or educational institutions, Canada or any province, and certain ones not recognized for income tax purposes{{efn|the last class of exempt gifts was repealed in 1941}}
:* where a gift is made to a minor aged 13 to 18 years, liability for tax will not arise until the 19th birthday, provided that the donor has supplied a [[Surety bond|bond]] securing the payment of the tax{{efn|repealed in 1941}}
:* the donor is liable to pay the tax, otherwise there is joint and several liability by both the donor and donee

==Post-war involvement in revenues==
===Federal-provincial revenue-sharing arrangements (1947-1971)===
From 1947 to 1971, there was a complicated set of federal-provincial revenue-sharing arrangements, where:{{sfn|Goodman|1995|pp=1365{{en dash}}1366}}

:* In Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Manitoba, the federal government collected estate taxes at full rates, but remitted 75% of the revenues derived from each of those provinces;
:* In Alberta and Saskatchewan, the federal government collected estate taxes at full rates, but remitted 75% of the revenues derived from each of those provinces, which was rebated back to the estate;&lt;ref&gt;in Alberta, through {{Cite canlaw|short title  =The Estate Tax Rebate Act|abbr =S.A.|year =1967|chapter = 18|link= http://www.ourfutureourpast.ca/law/page.aspx?id=2973155}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* In British Columbia, the federal government collected estate taxes at only 25% of the full rate, and the province continued to levy its own succession duty;
:* In Ontario and Quebec, the federal government collected estate taxes at only 50% of the full rate, and remitted 50% of such collections to such provinces,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|link= http://www.lois-laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-57-216/page-1.html
|type= reg|regtitle = Dominion Succession Duty (1957) Regulations|regnumber= SOR/57-216}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the provinces continued to levy their own succession duties.

When [[Edgar Benson]]'s [[white paper]] on tax reform was issued in 1969, his original intention was to retain estate and gift taxes in conjunction with introducing [[capital gains tax]], with appropriate relief to avoid [[double taxation]].{{sfn|Benson|1969|loc=par. 3.42}} After [[public consultation]]s were held through [[hearing (law)|hearing]]s by parliamentary committees, he announced that, as "it is no longer possible to establish a uniform national system of death duties through federal legislation," the federal government would vacate the estate and gift tax field on December 31, 1971.{{sfn|Benson|1971|p=33}} At that time, only British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec were still levying duties of their own.{{sfn|Bale|1972|p=555}} Most of the other provinces revived their succession duties, and also started levying gift taxes, on January 1, 1972.

==Recent conversion of provincial probate fees into probate taxes==
The provinces have moved in recent years to convert fees for the granting of [[probate|letters probate]] and [[letters of administration]] from [[flat rate]]s to ones based on the value of the estate. In 1992, Ontario introduced fees at a level higher than in any other province.&lt;ref&gt;O.Reg. 293/92&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] declared that the method by which it was introduced was unconstitutional, as its basis had not been the subject of appropriate legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Re Eurig Estate|link=|year=1998|court=scc|num=801|format=canlii|parallelcite=[1998] 2 SCR 565|date=1998-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, the provinces{{efn|with the exception of Quebec, which never had such a regime}} passed legislation to legitimate the fees already in effect:

===Expansion of scope in Ontario (2015)===
Ontario already had the highest rates relating to probate taxes, but is still faced with large [[budget deficit]]s.&lt;ref name="Dollar2014"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.sunnet.sunlife.com/files/advisor/english/PDF/Changes_coming_to_Ontarios_Estate_Administration_Tax.pdf|title= Changes for Ontario’s Estate Administration Tax|last= Dollar|first= Stuart L.|date= April 2014|website= sunlife.com|publisher= Sun Life Financial}}&lt;/ref&gt; The provincial 2011 budget speech stated that there was still a compliance problem with respect to the Estate Administration Tax,&lt;ref name="Dollar2014"/&gt; and it accordingly passed amending legislation that year,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/s11009 ''Better Tomorrow for Ontario Act (Budget Measures), 2011], S.O. 2011, c. 9, Schedule 14&lt;/ref&gt; coming into effect on January 1, 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw

:* in addition to the requirement to pay a deposit on tax that was already in place in order to receive an estate certificate,{{efn|a term that covers letters probate and letters of administration}} an estate representative must file an estate information return within 90 days of the date the certificate was issued, together with any balance of tax still owing
:* where a later statement under the ''Estates Act'' discloses any property that was not previously disclosed on the estate information return, the estate representative must file an amended return within 30 days of the statement date
:* the Minister of Finance has similar powers to examine the information as he has under the ''Retail Sales Tax Act''
:* there is no procedure for the estate to receive a clearance certificate with respect to closing off any further liability&lt;ref name="Brennan2015"/&gt;

The changes have been viewed as "put[ting] undue pressure on executors{{em dash}}often family members{{em dash}}faced with balancing their grief with trying to make the Finance Ministry happy."&lt;ref name="Brennan2015"&gt;{{cite news |last= Brennan|first= Richard|date= September 24, 2015|title= Ontario government wants estate tax paid sooner|url= https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2015/09/24/ontario-liberal-government-wants-estate-tax-paid-sooner.html|newspaper= [[The Toronto Star]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4566">'''International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1994''' (ITTA, 1994 or ITTA2) was drafted to ensure that by the year 2000 exports of [[tropical timber]] originated from [[sustainability|sustainably]] managed sources and to establish a fund to assist tropical timber producers in obtaining the resources necessary to reach this objective.
It defined the mandate of the [[International Tropical Timber Organization]].

The agreement was opened for signature on January 26, 1994, and entered into force on January 1, 1997.

It replaced the [[International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1983]], and was superseded by the [[International Tropical Timber Agreement, 2006]].

==Parties==
Sixty-two parties ultimately ratified the agreement:

[[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Myanmar|Burma]], [[Cambodia]], [[Cameroon]], [[Canada]], [[Central African Republic]], [[People's Republic of China]], [[Colombia]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Republic of the Congo]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Denmark]], [[Ecuador]], [[Egypt]], [[European Union]], [[Fiji]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Gabon]], [[Germany]], [[Ghana]], [[Greece]], [[Guatemala]], [[Guyana]], [[Honduras]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Liberia]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mexico]], [[Nepal]], [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Nigeria]], [[Norway]], [[Panama]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Peru]], [[Philippines]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Suriname]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[Thailand]], [[Togo]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]], [[Uruguay]], [[Vanuatu]], [[Venezuela]]

'''Jaime Milans del Bosch y Ussía''' (8 June 1915&amp;nbsp;– 26 July 1997) was a lieutenant general in the [[Spanish Army]] who was dismissed and imprisoned in 1981 for his role in the failed [[23-F|coup d'état of 23 February 1981]].&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-general-jaime-milans-del-bosch-1247790.html |title=Obituary: General Jaime Milans del Bosch |author=Nick Caistor |date=1997-09-29 |publisher=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Milans del Bosch was born into a noble family whose members had held many senior military ranks. He was the grandson of [[Joaquín Milans del Bosch]]. Jaime Milans del Bosch is reported to have repeatedly boasted of how many of his ancestors had participated in coups d'état. 

In 1934, he entered the military academy of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. As a cadet, he fought in the [[Spanish Civil War]] at the [[Alcázar of Toledo]], where he was injured during a republican bombing.  Shortly afterwards, he received his officer's commission in the [[Spanish Foreign Legion]]. In 1941, Bosch joined the [[Blue Division]] to fight against the Soviet Union under German command.    

After the war, he held successive positions as military attaché in Spanish embassies in Latin American countries, including Argentina, Uruguay, Chile and Paraguay.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;

Promoted to brigadier general in 1971 and major general in 1974, he was appointed commander of the 3rd military district (headquartered in [[Valencia]]) in 1977, at the rank of lieutenant-general.

== ''Coup d'état'' of February 1981 ==
Milans del Bosch was the only senior army commander who supported the coup without reservation and conducted offensive operations of importance. On 23 February 1981, shortly after [[Antonio Tejero]] had stormed the [[Spanish Congress of Deputies]], he ordered tanks onto the streets of Valencia and decreed a state of emergency. 

After the televised message of King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos I]], those in the military who had not yet committed themselves decided to remain on the side of the government, causing the coup to fail. Despite the lack of support, Milans del Bosch only surrendered at 5 a.m. on the next day, 24 February.

== Court-martial and dishonorable discharge ==
Milans del Bosch was court-martialled on 8 March 1981.  On 3 June 1982, he was sentenced to 26 years and 8 months imprisonment and expelled from the army.  Barely nine years later, in 1991, he was pardoned and released due to advanced age.  He never expressed remorse for his involvement in the coup.  

He returned to live in his native Madrid, where he died of a brain tumor in 1997.  He is buried at the [[Alcázar of Toledo]].

'''John Perry Barlow''' (October 3, 1947 &amp;ndash; February 7, 2018) was an American [[poet]] and [[essayist]], a [[cattle rancher]], and a [[cyberlibertarian]]{{Sfn | Goldsmith | Wu | 2006 | p = 17}} [[political activist]] who had been associated with both the Democratic and Republican parties. He was also a [[lyricist]] for the [[Grateful Dead]] and a founding member of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] and the [[Freedom of the Press Foundation]]. He was Fellow Emeritus at [[Harvard University]]'s [[Berkman Center for Internet and Society]], where he had maintained an affiliation since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/emeritus|title=People &amp;#124; Berkman Klein Center|website=Cyber.law.harvard.edu|accessdate=March 21, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814002735/https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/emeritus |archivedate=August 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raised as a "devout Mormon", he was prohibited from watching television until the sixth grade, when his parents allowed him to "absorb [[televangelists]]".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0tMVBQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=heads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbo4__q6nTAhWGQyYKHUpnClAQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=barlow&amp;f=false|title=Heads: A Biography of Psychedelic America|first=Jesse|last=Jarnow|date=March 29, 2016|publisher=Da Capo Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tipjarmag.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tipjarmag.com/2016/04/keeping-up-with-john-perry-barlow|title=Keeping Up with John Perry Barlow - TipJar|date=April 14, 2016|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170417070423/http://www.tipjarmag.com/2016/04/keeping-up-with-john-perry-barlow/|archivedate=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Barlow's academic record was erratic throughout his secondary education, he "had his pick of top eastern universities... simply because he was from Wyoming, where few applications originated."&lt;ref name="whowhatwhy.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://whowhatwhy.org/2018/02/13/john-perry-barlows-last-words|title=John Perry Barlow's Last Words - WhoWhatWhy|date=February 13, 2018|website=whowhatwhy.org|accessdate=April 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, he graduated with high honors in [[comparative religion]] from [[Wesleyan University]] in [[Middletown, Connecticut]]. He claimed to have served as the University's student body president until the administration "tossed him into a [[Sanatorium|sanitarium]]" following a drug-induced attempted [[suicide attack]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="whowhatwhy.org"/&gt; Following two weeks of rehabilitation, he successfully returned to his studies.&lt;ref name="whowhatwhy.org"/&gt;

Prior to receiving his degree, Barlow was admitted to [[Harvard Law School]] and contracted to write a novel by [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] at the behest of his mentor, the autodidactic [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning novelist and historian [[Paul Horgan]].&lt;ref name="salon.com"&gt;McEnteer, James (June 2, 2018).

==Career==
===Grateful Dead===
At age 15, Barlow became a student at the [[Fountain Valley School]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]. While there, he met [[Bob Weir]], who would later join the [[jam band]] the [[Grateful Dead]]. Weir and Barlow maintained their close friendship through the years. 

As a frequent visitor during college to [[Timothy Leary]]'s facility in [[Millbrook, New York]], Barlow was introduced to [[LSD]]; he later claimed to have consumed the substance on over one thousand occasions throughout his life.&lt;ref name="whowhatwhy.org"/&gt; These transformative experiences led Barlow to distance himself from Mormonism. He went on to facilitate the first meeting between the Grateful Dead and the Leary organization (who recognized each other as kindred souls in spite of their respective philosophical approaches) in June 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=of4J2dbKvMoC&amp;pg=PA642&amp;dq=john+barlow+leary&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj54M_U06nUAhUByoMKHVrdCH0Q6AEIRDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=john+barlow+leary&amp;f=false|title=Timothy Leary: A Biography|first=Robert|last=Greenfield|date=February 7, 2018|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While on his way to [[California]] to reunite with the Grateful Dead in 1971, he stopped at his family's ranch, though had not intended to stay. His father had suffered a debilitating stroke in 1966 before dying in 1972, resulting in a $700,000 business debt. Barlow ended up changing his plans, and began practicing [[animal husbandry]] under the auspices of the Bar Cross Land and Livestock Company in [[Cora, Wyoming]], for almost two decades. To support the ranch, he continued to write and sell [[spec scripts]].&lt;ref name="whowhatwhy.org"/&gt; In the meantime, Barlow was still able to play an active role in the Grateful Dead while recruiting many unconventional part-time ranch hands from the mainstream as well as the [[counterculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cookephoto.com/jpb.html|title=John Perry Barlow Portfolio|website=Cookephoto.com|accessdate=March 29, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417115103/http://www.cookephoto.com/jpb.html|archivedate=April 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his death in 2017, [[John Byrne Cooke]] intended to produce a documentary film (provisionally titled ''The Bar Cross Ranch'') that documented this era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Byrne Cooke|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pub/john-byrne-cooke/99/962/182|title=John Byrne Cooke|publisher=LinkedIn|accessdate=March 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WikipediaBarlow20060529.png|thumb|Barlow orating at the [[European Graduate School]] of [[Leuk|Leuk, Switzerland]] in 2006]]
Barlow became interested in collaborating with Weir at a Grateful Dead show at the [[Capitol Theatre (Port Chester, New York)|Capitol Theatre]] in [[Port Chester, New York]], in February 1971. Until then, Weir had mostly worked with resident Dead lyricist [[Robert Hunter (lyricist)|Robert Hunter]]. Hunter preferred that those who sang his songs stick to his "canonical" lyrics rather than improvising additions or rearranging words. A feud erupted backstage over a couplet in "[[Sugar Magnolia]]" from the band's most recent release (most likely "She can dance a Cajun rhythm/Jump like a Willys in four-wheel drive"), culminating in a disgruntled Hunter summoning Barlow and telling him "take [Weir]—he's yours".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=McNally|first=Dennis|title=A Long Strange Trip: The Inside History of the Grateful Dead|page=394|publisher=Broadway|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1971, with a deal for [[Ace (Bob Weir album)|a solo album]] in hand and only two songs completed, Weir and Barlow began to write together for the first time. They co-wrote such songs such as "[[Cassidy (song)|Cassidy]]", "[[Mexicali Blues (song)|Mexicali Blues]]" and "[[Black-Throated Wind]]", all three of which would remain in the repertoires of the Grateful Dead and of Weir's varied solo projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/ace-mw0000195158|title=Ace - Bob Weir|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=February 8, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170717041823/http://www.allmusic.com/album/ace-mw0000195158|archivedate=July 17, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barlow subsequently collaborated with Grateful Dead keyboardist [[Brent Mydland]], a partnership that culminated in four songs on 1989's ''[[Built to Last]]''. He also wrote one song ("The Devil I Know") with [[Vince Welnick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/built-to-last-mw0000198496|title=Built to Last - Grateful Dead|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=February 8, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823095811/http://www.allmusic.com/album/built-to-last-mw0000198496|archivedate=August 23, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet activism===
[[File:Nicholas Negroponte and John Perry Barlow.jpg|thumb|Barlow with [[Nicholas Negroponte]]]]
In 1986, Barlow joined [[The WELL]], an online community then known for a strong [[Deadhead]] presence. He served on the company's board of directors for several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2018/02/07/technology/john-perry-barlow-obit/index.html|title=Internet rights advocate John Perry Barlow dies|work=CNN|date=7 February 2018|accessdate=8 February 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180208014251/http://money.cnn.com/2018/02/07/technology/john-perry-barlow-obit/index.html|archivedate=February 8, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Barlow founded the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) along with fellow digital-rights activists [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gilmore]] and [[Mitch Kapor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/about/history|title=A History of Protecting Freedom Where Law and Technology Collide|website=The Electronic Frontier Foundation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180104113542/https://www.eff.org/about/history|archive-date=January 4, 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=February 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a founder of EFF, Barlow helped publicize the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] raid on [[Steve Jackson Games]]. His involvement is later documented in ''[[The Hacker Crackdown: Law and Disorder on the Electronic Frontier]]'' (1992) by [[Bruce Sterling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Gutenberg|bullet=none|no=101|last=Sterling|first=Bruce|year=1992|name=The Hacker Crackdown, law and disorder on the electronic frontier}}&lt;/ref&gt; EFF later sponsored the ground-breaking case ''[[Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service]]'' in support of Steve Jackson Games. Steve Jackson Games won the case in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/5801427/the-day-the-secret-service-raided-a-role-playing-game-company|title=The Day the Secret Service Raided a Role-Playing Game Company|first=Luke|last=Plunkett|date=May 13, 2011|accessdate=February 7, 2018|work=[[Kotaku]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028051101/http://kotaku.com/5801427/the-day-the-secret-service-raided-a-role-playing-game-company|archivedate=October 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Barlow was invited to speak about his work in [[cyberspace]] to a middle school classroom at [[North Shore Country Day School]]. This event was highly influential upon the life of then-student [[Aaron Swartz]]: Swartz's father Robert recalls Aaron coming home that day a changed person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaronswartzday.org/john-perry-barlow-recalls-a-12-year-old-aaron-swartz|title=John Perry Barlow Recalls A 12 year-old Aaron Swartz|website=Aaronswartzday.org|accessdate=March 29, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329162813/http://www.aaronswartzday.org/john-perry-barlow-recalls-a-12-year-old-aaron-swartz/|archivedate=March 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/JPBarlow/status/574421283431043072|title=John Perry Barlow|work=Twitter|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180208090408/https://twitter.com/JPBarlow/status/574421283431043072|archivedate=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Barlow met the recently appointed Brazilian Minister of Culture [[Gilberto Gil]] at the event Tactic Media Brazil to discuss the perspectives of digital inclusion and political participation, which in the following years would help shape Brazilian governmental policy on intellectual property and digital media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culturadigital.br/braziliandigitalculture/gilberto-gil-and-john-perry-barlow-will-meet-again-at-the-brazilian-digital-culture-forum/|title=Gilberto Gil and John Perry Barlow will meet again at the II Brazilian Digital Culture Forum|website=Culturadigital.br|accessdate=March 29, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327195952/http://culturadigital.br/braziliandigitalculture/gilberto-gil-and-john-perry-barlow-will-meet-again-at-the-brazilian-digital-culture-forum/|archivedate=March 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/11/arts/music/11roht.html|title=Gilberto Gil Hears the Future, Some Rights Reserved|date=March 11, 2007|work=The New York Times|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150605045115/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/11/arts/music/11roht.html|archivedate=June 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the two began working together to expand the availability and variety of Brazilian music to remix and share online. At the same time, being one of the "[[digerati]]", Barlow was among the very first users of the invitation-only social network [[Orkut]] at its inception. He decided to send all of his 100 invitations to friends in Brazil; two years later, some 11 million internet users in that country (out of 14 million total) were on the social network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/jruv/why-brazil-is-actually-winning-the-internet#.dk20AqxXD|title=Why Brazil Is Actually Winning The Internet|work=BuzzFeed|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017043349/https://www.buzzfeed.com/jruv/why-brazil-is-actually-winning-the-internet#.dk20AqxXD|archivedate=October 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===
From 1971 to 1995, Barlow wrote lyrics for the Grateful Dead, mostly through his relationship with Bob Weir. Barlow's songs include "Cassidy" (about [[Neal Cassady]] and Cassidy Law),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barlow|first=John Perry|title=Cassidy's Tale|url=http://www.litkicks.com/Topics/BarlowOnNeal.html|publisher =Literary Kicks: Beat Connections in Music|accessdate =November 12, 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023062542/http://www.litkicks.com/Topics/BarlowOnNeal.html|archivedate =October 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Estimated Prophet", "Black-Throated Wind", "Hell in a Bucket", "Mexicali Blues", "The Music Never Stopped" and "Throwing Stones".

Barlow wrote extensively for ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine, as well as ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Nerve (website)|Nerve]]'', and ''[[Communications of the ACM]]''. In his writings, he explained the wonder of the Internet. The Internet to him was more than a computer network; he called it an "electronic frontier."{{Sfn|Goldsmith|Wu|2006|p=17}} "He frequently wrote in language that echoed [[Henry Morton Stanley]]'s African diary. 'Imagine discovering a continent so vast that it may have no end to its dimensions. Imagine a new world with more resources than all our future greed might exhaust, more opportunities than there will ever be entrepreneurs enough to exploit, and a peculiar kind of real estate that expands with development. Imagine a place where trespassers leave no footprints, where goods can be stolen infinite number of times and yet remain in the possession of their original owners, where business you never heard of can own the history of your personal affairs.'"{{Sfn|Goldsmith|Wu|2006|pp=17–18}}

His writings include "[[A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace]]", which was written in response to the enactment of the [[Communications Decency Act]] in 1996 as the EFF saw the law as a threat to the independence and sovereignty of cyberspace. He argued that the cyberspace legal order would reflect the ethical deliberation of the community instead of the coercive power that characterized real-space governance.{{Sfn|Goldsmith|Wu|2006|p=20}} Since online "identities have no bodies", they found it inappropriate to obtain order in the cyberspace by physical coercion.&lt;ref name="declaration"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w2.eff.org/Censorship/Internet_censorship_bills/barlow_0296.declaration|title=A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace|accessdate=February 9, 2007|last=Barlow|first=John Perry|author-link=John Perry Barlow|date=February 8, 1996|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028001921/http://w2.eff.org/Censorship/Internet_censorship_bills/barlow_0296.declaration |archivedate=October 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, ethics, [[enlightened self-interest]] and the commonwealth were the elements they believed to create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace.{{Sfn|Goldsmith|Wu|2006|p=20}}

In his 1990 piece "Crime and Puzzlement: in advance of the law on the electronic frontier", Barlow wrote about his first-hand experience with Phiber Optik ([[Mark Abene]]) and Acid Phreak ([[Elias Ladopoulos]]) from the hacker group [[Masters of Deception]], and mentioned [[Kevin Mitnick]]—all of whom were engaged in [[phone phreaking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/John_Perry_Barlow/HTML/crime_and_puzzlement_1.html|title=Crime and Puzzlement: in advance of the law on the electronic frontier.|work=Whole Earth Review (Fall 1990): 44–57|accessdate=March 10, 2015|last=Barlow|first=John Perry|author-link=John Perry Barlow|date=June 8, 1990|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024192834/http://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/John_Perry_Barlow/HTML/crime_and_puzzlement_1.html|archivedate=October 24, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title alludes to ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insecure.org/stf/HackersEncyclope2.0.html|title=Hacker's Encyclopedia|website=Insecure.org|accessdate=March 29, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527042429/http://insecure.org/stf/HackersEncyclope2.0.html|archivedate=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barlow is credited with popularizing of the concept of [[Pronoia (psychology)|pronoia]] (defined as the opposite of [[paranoia]]) and was considered a celebrity ally of the [[Zippy Pronoia Tour]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pronoia.net/def.html|title=Pronoia (definition)|website=Pronoia.net|accessdate=March 29, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402211916/http://pronoia.net/def.html|archivedate=April 2, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pronoia.net/tour/faq/faq_zippies.html|title=Zippy Pronoia Tour /Zippy FAQ|website=Pronoia.net|accessdate=March 29, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329092556/http://www.pronoia.net/tour/faq/faq_zippies.html|archivedate=March 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Barlow wrote the article "Africa Rising: Everything You Know About Africa Is Wrong" for ''Wired'', which documented the start of his extensive travels as he worked to expand Internet access across the continent: "I went from Mombasa to Tombouctou, experiencing various parts of [[Kenya]], [[Ghana]], the [[Ivory Coast]], [[Mali]], [[Uganda]], and the [[Virunga Mountains|Virunga volcano area]] where Uganda, [[Rwanda]], and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|the Congo]] meet. Part of the idea was that I would attempt to email ''Wired'' a series of dispatches on my travels. The act of finding a port into cyberspace would be part of the adventure… Before I left, I believed Africans could proceed directly from the agricultural epoch into an information economy without having to submit to the dreary indignities and social pathologies of industrialization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/6.01/barlow.html|title=Africa Rising|author=John Perry Barlow|date=January 1, 1998|work=WIRED|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112234857/http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/6.01/barlow.html|archivedate=January 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barlow also returned to writing lyrics, most recently with [[The String Cheese Incident]]'s mandolinist and vocalist [[Michael Kang (musician)|Michael Kang]], including their song "Desert Dawn". Barlow was seen many times with [[Carolyn Garcia]] (whose monologue is dubbed on the eponymous track "Mountain Girl"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jambase.com/Articles/4071/STRING-CHEESE-INCIDENT-UNTYING-THE-NOT|title=Music News &amp; Concert Review|work=JamBase|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402134035/http://www.jambase.com/Articles/4071/STRING-CHEESE-INCIDENT-UNTYING-THE-NOT|archivedate=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) at their concerts mixing with the fans and members in the band, and was a close friend of String Cheese Incident producer [[Jerry Harrison]]. He also participated with the [[Chicago]]-based [[jam band]] [[Mr. Blotto]] on their release ''Barlow Shanghai''. Barlow was a spiritual mentor and student of [[Kemp Muhl]] and [[Sean Lennon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegoastt.com/bio.html|title=THE GOASTT|website=Thegoastt.com|accessdate=March 29, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328145016/http://thegoastt.com/bio.html|archivedate=March 28, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; collaborating with their band [[The Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger]] and making a cameo in their 2014 music video "Animals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhcR4rdzzoM|title=[HD] The GOASTT (The Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger) – "Animals"|date=April 10, 2014|publisher=YouTube|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120182629/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhcR4rdzzoM|archivedate=November 20, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Barlow's writings that has remained in circulation is his "Principles of Adult Behavior", which he penned in 1977 on the eve of his 30th birthday and which he continued to use to describe his approach to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/7/16988568/john-perry-barlow-internet-pioneer-obituary-electronic-frontier-foundation | title = Internet pioneer John Perry Barlow is dead at 70 | first = Russell | last = Brandom | date = February 7, 2018 | accessdate = February 7, 2018 | work = [[The Verge]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180208090408/https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/7/16988568/john-perry-barlow-internet-pioneer-obituary-electronic-frontier-foundation | archivedate = February 8, 2018 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1kgmes/i_am_john_perry_barlow_cofounder_of_the/|title=I am John Perry Barlow, cofounder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, lyricist for the Grateful Dead.

Seek to define your mission and pursue that", since that was counter to prevailing thought and "un-American". Barlow saw this more as a way to challenge how one perceived their life, their job, and their goals in life, and to not see achieving happiness as "an obligation [one owes] to Jefferson, the United States, or God Itself".&lt;ref name="forbes asap"/&gt;

===Politics===
Barlow was a former chairman of the [[Sublette County, Wyoming|Sublette County]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and served as western Wyoming campaign coordinator for [[Dick Cheney]] during his 1978 Congressional campaign. Although he had lauded Cheney as "the smartest man I've ever met [with] the possible exception of [[Bill Gates]]", Barlow subsequently renounced Cheney prior to his Vice Presidency, owing to his perceived repudiation of environmental and civil-rights issues in Congress. Barlow opined that "Dick's votes… were parts of complex deals aimed at enhancing his own power… [H]e has the least interest in human beings of anyone I have ever met."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://washingtonmonthly.com/2003/11/09/a-profile-of-dick-cheney|title=A Profile of Dick Cheney|publisher=Washington Monthly|accessdate=March 21, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104193002/http://washingtonmonthly.com/2003/11/09/a-profile-of-dick-cheney|archivedate=January 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=T.D.

Barlow was president of the [[Wyoming Outdoor Council]] from 1978 to 1984. He was chairman of the Sublette County Master Plan Design Commission and served on the Sublette County Planning and Zoning Commission for many years; in the latter capacity, he was one of five ranchers who administered water distribution in the New Fork Irrigation District, an area of nearly 100,000 acres serving about 35 ranchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Conference|contribution = New York city speakers: Barlow|format=PDF|date=June 2010|url=http://personaldemocracy.com/pdf-conference-2010-june-3-5-new-york-city-speakers#barlow|publisher=Personal democracy|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120527042208/http://personaldemocracy.com/pdf-conference-2010-june-3-5-new-york-city-speakers%23assange#barlow|archivedate=May 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 2000s, Barlow was unable to reconcile his ardent [[libertarianism]] with the prevailing [[neoconservative]] movement, and "didn't feel tempted to vote for Bush"; in 2004, he said that he was "voting for [[John Kerry]], though with little enthusiasm".&lt;ref name="reason"/&gt; Contemporaneously, he characterized cocaine derogatorily as a "Republican drug" that "makes its users self-obsessed, aggressive, and greedy".&lt;ref&gt;https://shift.newco.co/barlows-turn-of-phrase-d018c997b4f7&lt;/ref&gt; However, Barlow subsequently declared that he remained a Republican, most notably during an appearance on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' on March 26, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Colbert Report|date=March 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecolbertreport.cc.com/videos/a19udk/john-perry-barlow|title=John Perry Barlow – Video Clip|website=Thecolbertreport.cc.com|accessdate=March 29, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703153131/http://thecolbertreport.cc.com/videos/a19udk/john-perry-barlow|archivedate=July 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also claimed on many occasions to be an [[anarchist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barlow|first1=John Perry (interviewee)|last2=Jayakar|first2=Roshni (interviewer)|title=What stops free flow of information is dangerous|url=http://www.india-today.com/btoday/20001206/interview.html|work=Business Today|publisher=Living Media India|date=December 6, 2000|accessdate=November 12, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009235727/http://www.india-today.com/btoday/20001206/interview.html|archivedate=October 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barlow said he voted for [[Natural Law Party]] [[President of the United States|Presidential]] candidate [[John Hagelin]] in [[United States Presidential Election, 2000|2000]] after discovering in the voting booth that his friend [[Nat Goldhaber]] was Hagelin's [[running mate]].&lt;ref name="reason"&gt;{{cite news|title=Who's Getting Your Vote?|work=Reason|date=November 2004|url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/29304.html|accessdate=October 27, 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029233711/http://www.reason.com/news/show/29304.html|archivedate=October 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said in 2004: "I'm embarrassed for my country that in my entire voting life, there has never been a major-party candidate whom I felt I could vote for. All of my presidential votes, whether for [[George Wallace]], [[Dick Gregory]], or John Hagelin, have been protest votes."&lt;ref name="reason"/&gt; Barlow condemned [[Donald Trump]] in November 2016, characterizing him as a "thorough creep" and "toxic asshole" in a [[Facebook]] "micromanifesto".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://i.redd.it/n30qu08k4twx.png|title=Archived copy|accessdate=November 21, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121234713/https://i.redd.it/n30qu08k4twx.png|archivedate=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later work===
Barlow, until his death, served on the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]]'s board of directors, where he was listed as a co-founder after previously serving as vice chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/about/board |title=&amp;#124; Electronic Frontier Foundation|website=Eff.org|accessdate=March 21, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314024331/https://www.eff.org/about/board|archivedate=March 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EFF was designed to mediate the "inevitable conflicts that have begun to occur on the border between Cyberspace and the physical world". They were trying to build a legal wall that would separate and protect the Internet from territorial government, and especially from the US government.{{Sfn|Goldsmith|Wu|2006|pp=18-19}}

He was listed as Vice President at Algae Systems, a Nevada-based company with a working demo-scale pilot plant in [[Daphne, Alabama]], dedicated to commercializing novel methods at the [[water-energy nexus]] for growing microalgae offshore as a [[second-generation biofuels]] feedstock and converting it to useful [[Petroleum|crude]] via [[hydrothermal liquefaction]], while simultaneously treating [[wastewater]], reducing [[carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere]], and producing [[biochar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://algaesystems.com|title=Algae Systems|website=Algaesystems.com|accessdate=March 29, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328081255/http://algaesystems.com/|archivedate=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Startup Grind Jackson Hole on March 13, 2015, Barlow said that he was motivated to team up with Algae Systems after undergoing back surgery to address pain from an old ranching injury, while he had been an advisor to [[Herbert M. Allison|Herb Allison]] (president of [[Merrill Lynch]] at the time) and working to completely "electronify" financial transactions and speculative asset assembly 
Barlow was named "One of the 25 Most Influential People in Financial Services" in the June 1999 issue of ''FutureBanker Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egs.edu/faculty/john-perry-barlow/biography|title=Archived copy|accessdate=March 16, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318145952/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/john-perry-barlow/biography|archivedate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surgery successfully alleviated the pain and catalyzed Barlow to change his focus from building wealth to building infrastructure in order to do something about the "amount of alterations we are already enacting on Planet Earth… We are not necessarily making it warmer, but weirder." At Startup Grind Jackson Hole, Barlow also explained how once over tea with "Grandmother of the Conservation Movement" [[Margaret Murie|Mardy Murie]], he was inspired by her words, "Environmentalists can be a pain in the ass… But they make great ancestors." Adopting this philosophy, he stated, "I want to be a good ancestor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://startupgrind.com/2015/03/john-perry-barlow-a-good-ancestor|title=John Perry Barlow: A Good Ancestor|website=Startupgrind.com|accessdate=March 29, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520235726/http://startupgrind.com/2015/03/john-perry-barlow-a-good-ancestor|archivedate=May 20, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:John Perry Barlow serving as wedding minister at Mount Tamalpais.jpg|thumb|Barlow serving as wedding minister at [[Mount Tamalpais]] on July 11, 2014]]

He was engaged to Cynthia Horner, a doctor whom he met in 1993 at the [[Moscone Center]] in [[San Francisco]] while she was attending a [[psychiatry]] conference and Barlow was participating in a [[Steve Jobs]] comedy [[Roast (comedy)|roast]] at a convention for the [[NeXT Computer]]. She died unexpectedly in 1994 while asleep on a flight from Los Angeles to New York City, days before her 30th birthday, from a [[heart arrhythmia]] apparently caused by undetected viral [[myocarditis]]. Barlow describes this period in his life in the ''[[This American Life]]'' episode "Conventions", from August 29, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/74/conventions|title=Conventions|last=Glass|first=Ira|date=August 29, 1997|work=This American Life|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930160205/http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=74|archive-date=September 30, 2007|dead-url=no|access-date=February 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barlow had been a good friend and mentor to [[John F. Kennedy Jr.]], ever since his mother [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]] had made arrangements for her troublesome son to be a wrangler at the Bar Cross Ranch for six months in 1978. The two men later went on many double dates in New York City with Kennedy's then-girlfriend [[Daryl Hannah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/entertainment/slideshow/Iconic-80s-actresses-51412/photo-3650367.php|title=Darryl Hannah worked a lot in the ‘80s, as a mermaid in...

In his piece "A Ladies' Man and Shameless", Barlow professed his love of many women at the same time, and summarized the relationships in his personal life, "I doubt I'll ever be monogamous again… I want to know as many more women as time and their indulgence will permit me… There are probably twenty-five or thirty women—I certainly don't count them—for whom I feel an abiding and deep emotional attachment. They're scattered all over the planet. They range in age from less than half to almost twice my own. Most of these relationships are not actively sexual. Some were at one time. More never will be. But most of them feel as if they could become so. I love the feel of that tension, the delicious gravity of possibilities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brainwaving.com/2010/07/13/a-ladies-man-and-shameless|title=Archived copy|accessdate=April 16, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211003304/http://www.brainwaving.com/2010/07/13/a-ladies-man-and-shameless|archivedate=December 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kakavas v Crown Melbourne Ltd &amp; Ors''''' [2013] HCA 25 is a [[Lists of landmark court decisions#Landmark decisions in Australia|landmark]] [[Australian]] [[Judgment (law)|judgment]] of the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]].&lt;ref&gt;''Kakavas v Crown Melbourne Limited'' {{Cite AustLII|HCA|25|2013}} [http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/judgment-summaries/2013/hca25-2013-06-05.pdf judgement summary] at High Court of Australia Website.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[court case|matter]] related to claims that [[casino]] had taken unfair or unconscientious advantage of the opportunity created by a patron's special disadvantage, being a [[problem gambling|gambling problem]].&lt;ref&gt;''Kakavas v Crown Melbourne Limited'' {{Cite AustLII|HCA|25|2013}} at [5].&lt;/ref&gt;

Harry Kakavas a known problem gambler who had a gambling turnover of $1.5 billion and losses of $20.5 million claimed [[Melbourne]]'s [[Crown Melbourne|Crown Casino]] had engaged in unconscionable conduct by "luring" him into the casino with incentives and the use of the casino's [[private jet]].&lt;ref&gt;''Kakavas v Crown Melbourne Limited'' {{Cite AustLII|HCA|25|2013}} at [3] and [27].&lt;/ref&gt; In earlier proceedings it had also been claimed that a [[duty of care]] was owed by Crown to a patron with a gambling problem&lt;ref&gt;''Kakavas v Crown Melbourne Ltd'' {{Cite AustLII|VSC|559|2009}}at [436].&lt;/ref&gt; and that Crown lured or enticed him into its casino.&lt;ref&gt;''Kakavas v Crown Melbourne Limited'' {{Cite AustLII|HCA|25|2013}} at [5].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aston&gt;{{cite news|author=Heath Aston|title=Casino did not exploit man who spent $1.5b, rules High Court|publisher=[[Brisbane Times]]|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/casino-did-not-exploit-man-who-spent-15b-rules-high-court-20130605-2npe5.html|date=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The High Court, in a joint judgement, approved the observation by the primary judge that "[i]n the absence of a relevant legislative provision, there is no general duty upon a casino to protect gamblers from themselves."&lt;ref&gt;''Kakavas v Crown Melbourne Limited'' {{Cite AustLII|HCA|25|2013}} at [26].&lt;/ref&gt; The Court found that Mr Kakavas wasn't at a special disadvantage which made him susceptible to exploitation by Crown and was able to make rational decisions in his own interests, including deciding from time to time to refrain from gambling altogether. Crown did not knowingly victimise Mr Kavakas by allowing him to gamble at its casino.&lt;ref&gt;''Kakavas v Crown Melbourne Limited'' {{Cite AustLII|HCA|25|2013}} at [135].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Birmingham CC''''' [1996] 4 All ER 733 is an [[English unjust enrichment law]] case, concerning to what extent enrichment of the defendant must be at the expense of the claimant. It rejected a defence of "passing on" the gain against a claim of unjust enrichment.

==Facts==
[[Kleinwort Benson Ltd]], a bank, paid [[Birmingham City Council]] money under [[Swap_(finance)#Interest_rate_swaps|interest rate swap agreements]] that were later declared to be ''[[ultra vires]]'' and [[void (law)|void]] by the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham LBC]]'' [1992] 2 AC 1&lt;/ref&gt; The Council argued it did not have to repay the money because the bank had passed on its losses through hedging transactions long before.

==Judgment==
The [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] rejected that there could be a passing on defence. It rejected that there was any analogy to compensating for loss, so that it could be avoided or passed on. First, the payments received by the bank under the hedge contract were not causally connected with the payments of the bank under the swap contract. Second, the claims in unjust enrichment are not subject to a restriction on the defendant’s gain that it must correspond with loss.&lt;ref&gt;[[Goff &amp; Jones]] (2011) 6-73, argues the second part was not the ratio, the first was obiter).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Evans (judge)|Evans LJ]] gave the leading judgment, referring to American, Australian and Canadian authority outlining the problems of a passing on defence. [[Mark Saville, Baron Saville of Newdigate|Saville LJ]] gave the second judgment.

{{Cquote|He does not cease to be unjustly enriched because the payer for one reason or another is not out of pocket. His obligation to return the money is not based on any loss the payer may have sustained, but on the simple ground that it is unjust...

[The phrase "at the expense of" describes] the need for the payer to show that his money was used to pay the payee... What this expression does not justify is the importation of concepts of loss or damage with their attendant concepts of mitigation, for these have nothing whatever to do with the reason why our law imposes an obligation on the payee to repay to the payer what he has no right to retain.}}

[[Andrew Morritt|Morritt LJ]] concurred.

{{Cquote|[The words at the expense of] ... do no more than point to the requirement that the immediate source of the unjust enrichment must be the plaintiff... [Subtraction relates to] ...the plaintiff’s gross wealth. The suggested defence of passing on would involve the different concept of a reduction in the net worth of the plaintiff.}}

'''[[Law]] in [[Asia]]''' is undergoing rapid change and modernisation{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}, especially given the economic growth in [[China]] and [[India]]. Asian countries share a substantial heritage with European law{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}, whilst keeping their own distinct identity.

==History==
[[Image:Constitution of India.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The [[preamble]] of the '''Constitution of India''']]
[[History of China|Ancient China]] and [[History of India|ancient India]] had historically independent schools of legal theory and practice such as the ''[[Manusmriti|Laws of Manu]]'' or the ''[[Arthashastra]]'' in India and [[traditional Chinese law]] in China. Because [[Germany]] was a rising power in the late 19th century, and codified [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] is more 'exportable' than large bodies of common law jurisprudence, the German Civil Code has been highly influential for most oriental legal systems, and forms the basis of civil law in [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} In [[China]], the German Civil Code was introduced in the later years of the [[Qing Dynasty]] and formed the basis of the law of the [[Republic of China]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} which remains in force in [[Taiwan]]. The current legal infrastructure in the [[People's Republic of China]] reflects influences from the German-based civil law, English-based common law in Hong Kong, Soviet-influenced [[Socialist law]], United States-style banking and securities law, and [[traditional Chinese law]]. In India, and other previous members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], English common law forms the basis of private law.

The '''Legislative Council of the Gambia''' was the [[legislature]] of the [[Gambia Colony and Protectorate]] from 1843 to 1866, and from 1888 to 1960.

== History ==
The Gambia had formed part of the British crown colony known as the [[Senegambia Confederation|Province of Senegambia]], however this was revoked in 1821 and for legislative affairs The Gambia had to turn to [[Sierra Leone]]. In 1843, a Legislative Council in The Gambia consisting of the Governor and no less than two other public officials was created.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/africa/gm-history-06.htm|title=British Gambia - 19th Century Colony|last=|first=|date=|website=GlobalSecurity.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1866, opinion back in Britain was in favour of withdrawing from Africa, and all British West African colonies were placed under the control of Sierra Leone again, per Colonel [[Harry Ord]]'s suggestion. The Legislative Council established in 1843 was abolished, and a small council, consisting of the Administrator, the Collector of Customs, and the Chief Magistrate was created in its place. It was merely advisory and important legislative decisions were made in Sierra Leone. Nevertheless, over its lifetime it was gradually expanded, and by its supersedence by the Legislative Council again, it consisted of five officials and four unofficial members, of whom two were Africans.&lt;ref&gt;Darboe, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gambia was detached from Sierra Leone in 1888, and the Legislative Council was re-established. It consisted of the Governor, the Treasurer, the Chief Magistrate, the Collector of Customs, and other people who held office in the colony as ex-officio members. Provision also existed for the appointment of unofficial members, who could hold office for five years and be re-appointed.&lt;ref&gt;Darboe, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

The Legislative Council was established along with the Executive Council in 1901 as part of a progression towards self-government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/gambiathe/191336.htm|title=Gambia, The|last=|first=|date=15 November 2011|website=US Department of State|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1940s, the Legislative Council had three or four unofficial members who were natives of the Gambia nominated by the Governor to serve on the council, but could not vote. In 1944, it was announced that proposals allowing for the direct election of one member had been put forward and were being implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1944/mar/29/legislative-council-african|title=Legislative Council (African Representation)|last=|first=|date=29 March 1944|website=Hansard|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
The Governor of the Gambia acted as the president of the Legislative Council, as well as of the Executive Council. They had the power to make law by proclamation, as well as to veto any law passed by the Legislative Council.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The unelected members of the Legislative Council were the Colonial Secretary, the Financial Secretary, the Attorney General, the Senior Commissioner, the Director of Medical Services and two members appointed by the Governor from a list of nine names submitted by Bathurst Town Council and the Kombo Rural Authority.

== Elections ==
The first direct election for a seat on the Legislative Council took place in [[Gambian legislative election, 1947|1947]], where [[Edward Francis Small]] was elected. Three seats were up for election in [[Gambian legislative election, 1951|1951]]. John Colley Faye (Democratic Party) and Ibrahima Momodou Garba-Jahumpa (Muslim Congress Party) were elected in Bathurst, while Henry Madi (Independent) was elected in Kombo St Mary.

'''Lian''' is an recreational area located west of the city centre of [[Trondheim]] in [[Trøndelag]] county, [[Norway]]. It is situated on the border between the neighborhood of [[Byåsen]] and the forested area of [[Bymarka]]. The site came into popular recreational use in 1933 when the [[Gråkallen Line]]  (''Gråkallbanen'') of the [[Trondheim Tramway]] was extended.  [[Lian (station)|Lian Station]] remains the terminus of Gråkallbanen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://snl.no/Lian |title =Lian|publisher =    Store norske leksikon|author=  Knut A Rosvold|accessdate= December 1,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://snl.no/Bymarka|title =Bymarka|publisher =    Store norske leksikon|author=  Knut A Rosvold
|accessdate= December 1,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://snl.no/Gr%C3%A5kallbanen  |title =Gråkallbanen|publisher =    Store norske leksikon|author=  Tor Wisting|accessdate= December 1,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the arrival of the tramway, a [[ski jump]] was built and Lian Restaurant was opened at the end of the line.  The area became a primary location for winter sports in the city. [[Lianvannet]] was an important swimming place during the summer and was also possible to rent row boats. A dancing area was also built. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kjenstad, Rune |title=På skinner i Bymarka |year=1994 |publisher=Baneforlaget |pages=56–57 |isbn=82-91448-01-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.trondheim.com/lian-restaurant|title = Lian Restaurant|publisher =       trondheim.com|accessdate= December 1,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1925, the frozen lake was used for [[trotting]], with up to 6,000 watchers. In 1927,  [[A/S Graakalbanen]] offered the trotting association 100 [[hectare]] of land for a harness racing course, although the association did not except the deal since the tramway was not yet built. Instead they established  [[Leangen Travbane]]  at [[Leangen]]. During [[World War II]], the new field was confiscated by the German occupation forces.&lt;ref&gt;Kjenstad, 1994: 58&lt;/ref&gt;

The area around Lian has many cabins and some houses. About sixty cabins are illegally permanently occupied; only those buildings occupied from before 1967 may legally be permanently lived in. In 2008, the city suggested giving an amnesty for those who live in illegal houses, but have suggested changing reconstruction regulations for all houses in the area. This will in essence decrease the house value of legal housing (which come under restrictions) to illegal housing (which now may be sold as permanent housing). This created a local controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adressa.no/nyheter/dokument/article1190190.ece |title=Mot sluttstrek for et splittet Lian |author=Hansen, Hermann |date=2008-11-13 |accessdate=2008-01-19 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Liland affair''' was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[murder]] [[trial]] which gave rise to a [[miscarriage of justice]].&lt;ref&gt;Flock, Hans, et al (1 July 1996) [https://www.regjeringen.no/contentassets/f0e6cfe33ff045ab887dcd9e8b4cfe41/no/pdfa/nou199619960015000dddpdfa.pdf Lilandsaken (the Liland case)] (in Norwegian) Norwegian State Management Service, Oslo, Accessed 28 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The affair became a grave{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} embarrassment to the Norwegian criminal justice system.

==The crime and initial arrests==

At about 10:45 am on [[Christmas Eve|24 December]] 1969, two men, John Oval Larsen and Håkon Edvard Johansen were found [[murder]]ed  at Glemmengata 73 in the Norwegian town [[Fredrikstad]]. Both had severe head injuries and there was a lot of blood at the scene.  It was assumed that an axe was the murder weapon.  The address was known to be frequented by people who abused drugs or alcohol and was referred to locally as "little hell".  Three substance abusers were arrested on their way to the scene of the crime.  Two of them were later freed, while the third, Per Kristian Liland, was imprisoned and in 1970 convicted of the crime.  Liland always maintained his innocence.  After serving his entire sentence he was finally acquitted in 1994 after it became clear that he was a victim of a miscarriage of justice.  The case remains unsolved and is now subject to Norway's statute of limitations.

==Prosecution and judgement==
Per Kristian Liland was a known substance abuser in Fredrikstad and was arrested near the scene of the crime on 24 December 1969, just before midday. He was charged with the murders and remanded in custody on 27 December. He remained on remand until his conviction at [[Eidsivating Court of Appeal]] on 3 July 1970.  He was convicted of the premeditated murder of Larsen and the murder of Johansen (in an attempt to conceal a punishable offence).  He was sentenced to life imprisonment (at the time that meant 12 years) with an additional sentence of up to 10 years if it was considered he could repeat the crime due to mental disorders. (The sentences (''livsvarig fengsel'' and ''sikiring'') no longer exist in that form in Norwegian law.)

The time the murders were carried out was an important point in the case.  Per Liland could only be connected to the murders if they had been committed on the afternoon or evening of 22 December.  A local GP, Mikael Frestand, was called to the scene before the [[National Criminal Investigation Service (Norway)|Norwegian police unit which deals with serious crime]] arrived in Fredrikstad.  He arrived at the scene shortly after midday and testified that the bodies were "cold and stiff".  He entered 24 December 1969 as the date of death for both victims' death certificates which were issued several days later.  In the section on the form which dealt with when the injuries had taken place, he entered "23/12-24/12?".  At the start of the investigation it was assumed that the murders had taken place at some time between 19:30 on 23 December and 02:00 on 24 December.

Court-appointed experts claimed that the murders could have taken place on 22 December.  Even though several witnesses also claimed that the murder victims had been seen and that activity had been registered at the address at a later point in time, the court decided to ignore this testimony and found that Per Liland had committed the murders on 22 December. Alf Nordhus, the lawyer who represented Liland appealed against the handling of the case and the sentencing at the [[Supreme Court of Norway|Supreme Court]].  The appeal was rejected on 28 November 1970.

==Initial attempts to have the case reviewed==
Liland, through Alf Nordhus sought to have the case reviewed on 27 December 1971.  The application included 1700 pages of documents collected by Sten and Vibeke Ekroth and which also included sound recordings of witnesses who stated that the victims had been seen alive after the murders were supposed to have taken place.  Sten Ekroth, a Swedish pop music manager was on an engagement trip with his wife-to-be Vibeke and by chance came to play an important role in the case. The documentation the Ekroths provided formed the basis of the application to have the case looked at again.  The couple was newly in love and wanted to document everything they experienced. For that reason they smuggled a tape recorder with them into court.  They followed the case closely and had the impression that Liland was innocent.  The application to have the case reopened was rejected by Eidsivating Court of Appeal on 7 May 1975.  The decision was appealed to the Supreme Court but was rejected by the Court's Appeal committee on 5 March 1976.

==Imprisonment==
Per Liland served out his sentence until 22 June 1983. At the time Norwegian law allowed sentences of prisoners who were considered a danger to society to be extended by a maximum of ten years. His sentence was extended to the maximum permitted and he remained in prison until 22 June 1993.

==Further attempts to have the case reopened==
On 23 June 1993, the day after his sentence ended, Liland started a new attempt to have the case reopened.  The case was advanced by Ole Jakob Bae and Cato Schiøtz, who later were appointed to the defence in the reopened case.

==Basis for review==
A decisive factor in Liland's conviction was that the murders were deemed to have taken place on 22 December. There were several indications that they had actually taken place on 23 December or 24 December, when Per Liland could not be connected to the crime scene.

==New medical experts==
Analysis of the victim's blood showed that Larsen had a [[Blood alcohol content|blood alcohol level]] of 0.023% at the time of death, while no alcohol was detected in Johansen's blood.  There had been a party at the scene of the crime on 22 December and much alcohol had been consumed.  Both murder victims were characterised as alcoholics and it was assumed that both were drunk during the party.  The original medical experts Jon Lundevall and Johan Chr. Giertsen which the prosecution had relied on therefore concluded that Johansen must have lived for at least 13 hours after having been injured.  Testimony from new medical experts did not support this theory.  It was also revealed that the two original experts had disagreed but that this had not been revealed during the original court case.  It also emerged that blood was found at the scene which had not solidified.

==Witness statements==
At the original trial several witnesses claimed to have seen the two murder victims alive after 22 December.  The court decided to ignore these statements. Sten and Vibeke Ekroth had, after the trial, questioned several witnesses who made similar claims.  During the reopening of the case further witnesses confirmed that the murder victims had been alive after 22 December.

==Coupon in Larsen's pocket==
It came to light that police officers Hageløkke and Restad, who investigated the scene of the murder had found a food coupon in Larsen's back pocket.  The coupon had been issued by Fredrikstad municipality and had a value of 65 kroner.  The report detailed that the coupon had the number 121013 and that it was dated 23 December.  The prosecution had neglected to present this evidence to the court. It could have, by itself, been enough to acquit Per Liland in the first instance.

Further examination revealed that dates in the report had been changed from 23 December to 22 December and that the coupon number had been changed from 121013 to 121031. The coupon itself disappeared and Fredrikstad municipality was also unable to find a copy of the coupon.

==Review==
On 29 April 1994 Eidsivating Court of Appeal ruled that the case should be reviewed.  The prosecution appealed against the decision, but the appeal was rejected by the Supreme Court on 2 September 1994.

==Acquittal==
New charges were brought against Liland.  Before the main proceedings, the prosecution informed that court that it intended to drop its objection to a full acquittal.  The case proceeded on 21 November 1994. Without any evidence being presented, the court acquitted Liland.

==Compensation==
Per Liland immediately applied for compensation under Norwegian trial law.  The court awarded him 2,900,000 kroner for lost income, 840,000 for lost future income and 10,000,000 kroner for non-economic loses, a total of 13,740,000 kroner.

Per Liland died in 1996.

The '''Limited Liability Act 1855''' (18 &amp; 19 Vict c 133) was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that first allowed [[limited liability]] for [[corporation]]s that could be established by the general public in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Mayson, French and Ryan (2005) 55&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Under the Act, [[shareholder]]s were still liable directly to [[creditor]]s, for the unpaid portion of their [[share (finance)|share]]s. The modern principle that shareholders are liable to the corporation was introduced by the [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1844]].

The 1855 Act allowed limited liability to companies of more than 25 members (shareholders). [[Insurance]] companies were excluded from the act, though it was standard practice for insurance contracts to exclude action against individual members. Limited liability for insurance companies was allowed by the [[Companies Act 1862]].

==Debate==
In the House of Lords, a considerable amount of opposition existed to the idea that companies should have the advantage of limited liability. Many peers objected to what appeared to them as the government rushing through the bill as if its urgency was connected to the effort in the [[Crimean War]]. [[Henry Grey, 3rd Earl Grey|Earl Grey]] was one of these. He said,&lt;ref&gt;HL Debs, vol ? col 1904 (7 August 1855)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|It proposes to depart from the old-established maxim that all the partners are individually liable for the whole of the debts of the concern.}}

[[Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville|Earl Granville]] replied to these concerns as follows.&lt;ref&gt;HL Debs, vol ?, col 1903 (7 August 1855)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|it appears to me that a time of war is the very time which you ought to free commerce from restrictions, and, therefore that the reason he mentioned is an especial reason for pressing on the Bill instead of retarding it.}}

'''Malaysian nationality law''' is the law of [[Malaysia]] that deals with [[citizenship]] and other forms of nationality. Nationality law is mentioned in the [[Constitution of Malaysia]].

==History==
Citizenship law was first implemented in several Malaysian states before the country achieved independence and sovereignty. The [[Straits Settlements]], consisting of [[Crown Colony of Penang|Penang]], [[Crown Colony of Malacca|Malacca]], [[Colony of Singapore|Singapore]] and later [[Crown Colony of Labuan|Labuan]], was the first entity to introduce nationality laws in the region. The Naturalization Act of 1867 stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
any person, whilst actually residing in the Colony, may present a memorial to the Governor in Council, praying that the privileges of naturalisation may be conferred upon him.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It also provided that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
such memorial shall state to the best of the knowledge and belief of the memorialist, his age, place of birth, place of residence, profession, trade or occupation, the length of time during which he has resided within the Colony, that he is permanently settled in the Colony, or is residing within the same, with attempt to settle therein.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Requirements==
The criteria to be a [[Malaysians|Malaysian citizen]] are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commonlii.org/my/legis/const/1957/3.html|title=Constitution of Malaysia 1957|publisher=CommonLii|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Every person born before Malaysia Day (16 September 1963) who is a citizen of Malaysia by virtue of these provisions
# Every person who immediately before [[Hari Merdeka|Merdeka Day 1957]] (31 August), was a citizen of Malaysia by virtue of any of the provisions of the Federation of Malaya Agreement, 1948, whether by operation of law or otherwise
# Every person born within Malaysia on or after Merdeka Day and before October 1962
# Every person born within Malaysia after September 1962, of whose, at least, one parent was at the time of the birth either a citizen or a permanent resident in Malaysia, or who was not born a citizen of any other country
# Every person born outside Malaysia on or after Merdeka Day whose father&lt;ref&gt;It is  starting on 1 June 2010, for a child was born outside Malaysia or inside Malaysia, the child would acquire Malaysian citizenship as long as the child's father or mother is Malaysian citizen at the time of birth. http://www.kln.gov.my/web/chn_guangzhou/birth_marriage_cert&lt;/ref&gt; was a citizen at the time of his birth and either was born in Malaysia or was at the time of the birth in service under the Government of Malaysia or of a State
# Every person born outside Malaysia on or after Merdeka Day whose father was a citizen at the time of the birth if the birth was, or is, within 1 year of its occurrence or within such longer period as in any particular case was or is allowed by the Malaysian Government, registered at a consulate of Malaysia or, if it occurred in Singapore, [[Sarawak]], [[Brunei]] or [[North Borneo]], registered with the Federal Government
* Every person born on or after Malaysia Day, and having any of the qualifications specified below''
# Every person born within Malaysia of whose parents one at least is at the time of the birth either a citizen or permanently resident in Malaysia and
# Every person born outside Malaysia whose father is at the time of the birth a citizen and either was born in Malaysia or is at the time of the birth in the service of the Federation or of a State and
# Every person born outside Malaysia whose father is at the time of the birth a citizen and whose birth is, within 1 year of its occurrence or within such longer period as the Malaysian Government may in any particular case allow, registered at a consulate of Malaysia or, if it occurs in Brunei or in a territory prescribed for this purpose by order of the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]], registered with the Malaysian Government and
# Every person born in Singapore of whose parents one at least is at the time of the birth a citizen and who is not born citizen otherwise than by virtue of this paragraph and
# Every person born within Malaysia who is not born a citizen of any country otherwise than by virtue of this paragraph

===Gaining citizenship===
A person can become a citizen of Malaysia either by ''registration'' or ''naturalisation''. In cases by registration, where a person is by operation of law is a citizen but have yet to be registered, such person is entitled to citizenship upon application and be registered as a citizen of Malaysia. For cases by naturalisation, this refers to the process of admitting a person not a citizen of Malaysia to citizenship. This is subjected to the requirements and conditions of the Federal Government. Any person holding Malaysian citizenship is also disallowed to hold any other country's citizenship. Malaysia does not allow [[dual citizenship]].

Those applying for citizenship by registration must have "an elementary knowledge of the [[Malay language]]". Those applying to become naturalised citizens must have "an adequate knowledge of the Malay language" and have resided in the country for ten of the past twelve years, including the twelve months immediately preceding the application. These requirements are set out by Part III of the [[Constitution of Malaysia|Constitution]]; however, as there is no objective definition of what constitutes elementary or adequate knowledge of Malay, in practice, the tests are often subjective, sometimes even varying in whether a written knowledge of Malay is required.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, Min Aun &amp; Hickling, R. H. (2003). ''Hickling's Malaysian Public Law'', p. 33. Petaling Jaya: Pearson Malaysia. {{ISBN|983-74-2518-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Permanent residency in Sabah and Sarawak===
Permanent residency in the states of [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] are distinct from the other 11 Malaysian states. While Sabah and Sarawak each has [[autonomy]] in immigration affairs (which includes imposing immigration restrictions on [[Peninsular Malaysia]] residents), permanent residents of Sabah and Sarawak are exempted from the immigration controls of their own states. A Malaysian citizen born to a Sabah or Sarawak permanent resident would have Sabah or Sarawak permanent residency, regardless of where the person was born. Birth in Sabah or Sarawak alone does not make a person a permanent resident unless one of his/her parents is a permanent resident. A person may become a Sabah or Sarawak permanent resident by obtaining Permanent Residence (PR) status issued by the respective state immigration departments. The permanent residency status of a person is indicated by a letter on his/her [[MyKad]] below the photo, with ''H'' for Sabahans, ''K'' for Sarawakians, and none for Peninsular Malaysians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=72917 NRD: 'H' indicates holder is a Sabahan], Daily Express, 5 June 2010  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621233951/http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=72917 |date=21 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar scheme is also used in [[Malaysian passport]]s, differentiated by the letter prefix of the passport number:''H'' for Sabahans, ''K'' for Sarawakians, and ''A'' for Peninsular Malaysians.

===Commonwealth citizenship===
All Malaysian citizens are [[Commonwealth citizen]]s and are entitled to certain rights in Britain and other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries. For example, they can vote in all elections (including for the [[European Parliament]]), hold public office and serve on juries in the UK. Malaysians are entitled to consular assistance from British embassies in non-Commonwealth countries without a Malaysian representative.

These rights include:
* the right, unless otherwise disqualified (e.g. imprisoned), to vote in all elections (i.e., parliamentary, local and European &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://curia.europa.eu/en/actu/communiques/cp06/aff/cp060070en.pdf |format=PDF|title=Judgments of the Court in Cases C-145/04 and C-300/04 – Kingdom of Spain v United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland |publisher=The Court of Justice of the European Communities |date=12 September 2006 |accessdate=18 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; elections) as long as they have [[Elections in the United Kingdom#Registration procedure|registered to vote]] (they must possess valid [[leave to enter]]/remain or [[Right of abode (United Kingdom)|not require such leave]] on the date of their electoral registration application&lt;ref&gt;Representation of the People Act 1983, Section 4(6)&lt;/ref&gt;)
* the right, unless otherwise disqualified, to stand for election to the [[British House of Commons]] as long as they possess [[indefinite leave to remain]] or [[Right of abode (United Kingdom)|do '''not''' require leave]] under the Immigration Act 1971 (c. 77) to enter or remain in the UK&lt;ref&gt;[[Electoral Administration Act 2006]], Section 18&lt;/ref&gt;
* the right, if a qualifying peer or bishop, to sit in the [[House of Lords]]
* eligibility to hold public office (e.g., as a judge, magistrate, minister, police constable, member of the armed forces, etc.)

==== Penang and Malacca ====
Several early independence acts did not contain any provision for the loss of citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies by citizens of the newly independent states. A notable case is that of the former Settlements (colonies) of [[Crown Colony of Penang|Penang]] and [[Crown Colony of Malacca|Malacca]] in what is now [[Malaysia]]. These were combined in 1948 with the nine [[Malay states]] (which were protected states rather than colonies) to form the [[Federation of Malaya]]. On independence on 31 August 1957, British protected persons (BPP) from the Malay states lost their BPP status. However, as a result of representations made by the [[Straits Chinese]], known as the "Queen's Chinese", it was agreed by the Governments of the United Kingdom and Malaya that no provision should be made for the withdrawal of Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKC) status from the inhabitants of Penang and Malacca, who would consequently be allowed to remain CUKCs as well as citizens of Malaya.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1972/nov/13/malaysian-citizens ''Hansard'', HC Deb 13 November 1972. vol. 846, cc. 24-5W]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 September 1963, the colonies of [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|North Borneo]], [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|Sarawak]] and Singapore were joined with Malaya to form Malaysia (Singapore subsequently left Malaysia in 1965). CUKC was withdrawn from those acquiring Malaysian citizenship in 1963, but this did not affect existing citizens of the Federation.

Hence, persons connected with Penang and Malacca prior to 31 August 1957, together with those born before 1983 in legitimate descent to fathers so connected, form the largest group of British Overseas citizens (estimated at over 1 million).  Most also hold Malaysian citizenship.

==Travel freedom==

Republic of Zimbabwe'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SAFLII|litigants=Mike Campbell (Pvt) Ltd and Others v Republic of Zimbabwe|link=|court=SADCT|year=2008|num=2|parallelcite=|date=28 November 2008|courtname=auto|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a case decided by the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC) Tribunal (hereinafter "the Tribunal"). The Tribunal held that the [[Zimbabwe]]an government violated the organisation's treaty by denying access to the courts and engaging in racial discrimination against [[White people in Zimbabwe|white]] farmers whose lands had been confiscated under the [[Land reform in Zimbabwe|land reform program in Zimbabwe]].

==Background==
Land reform in Zimbabwe began after the signing of the [[Lancaster House Agreement]] in 1979 in an effort to more equitably distribute land between the historically disenfranchised blacks and the minority whites. Government-orchestrated land invasions began in February 2000.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;[http://www.swradioafrica.com/Documents/Campb040609.pdf Zimbabwean Farm Test Case timeline]&lt;/ref&gt; The Zimbabwean government formally announced a "fast track" resettlement program in July 2000, stating that it would acquire more than 3,000 farms for redistribution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/2002/zimbabwe/ZimLand0302-02.htm#P112_20168 ''Fast Track Land Reform in Zimbabwe, Human Rights Watch'', March 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1970s Campbell, a [[South African Army]] captain, had been involved in the [[Rhodesian Bush War]] that pitted [[Rhodesia]]'s mostly white government—50 of the 66 parliamentary seats were reserved for whites—against black nationalist guerrillas. He moved to Mount Carmel farm in 1974. He added a neighbouring plot of land in 1980, following Zimbabwean independence. As well as farming, Campbell set up an extensive nature reserve on the property, replete with giraffes, [[impala]] and other indigenous animals. He also created the Biri River Safari Lodge, which became a popular tourist attraction.&lt;ref name=campbellobituary&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/politics-obituaries/8439131/Mike-Campbell.html Mike Campbell Obituary – ''The Telegraph'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell purchased Mount Carmel from himself after independence. (The full title was vested in 1999, when the Zimbabwean government declared no interest in the land.)&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2001, amid large-scale land invasions by "war veterans", Campbell received a government notice to acquire Mount Carmel in the district of [[Chegutu]], but the notice was declared invalid by the High Court.&lt;ref name="hudleston2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The High Court is a superior court of record and has original jurisdiction over all criminal matters in Zimbabwe. [https://www.hrw.org/en/node/76100/section/5#_ftn16 Human Rights Watch, "Our Hands Are Tied", November 19, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2004, a new notice of intent to acquire Mount Carmel was published in the official Government Gazette, but no acquisition notice was actually issued. However, two months later, according to court filings, "persons purported to occupy the farm on behalf of [[Zanu PF]] spokesman Nathan Shamuyarira, claiming the former minister had been allocated the farm."&lt;ref name="hudleston2008"&gt;[http://www.zimbabwesituation.com/mar23_2008.html ''The Zimbabwe Situation'', "SADC to rule on farm seizure", March 22, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; After three more preliminary notices to take the farm were published in 2004, Campbell applied to the High Court for a protection order.&lt;ref name="hudleston2008" /&gt;

Amendment 17 was added to Zimbabwe's constitution on 14 September 2005 to vest ownership of certain categories of land on the Zimbabwean government and to eliminate the courts' [[jurisdiction]] to hear any challenge to the land acquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aceproject.org/regions-en/eisa/ZW/Constitution%20of%20Zimbabwe%201980.pdf Constitution of Zimbabwe as amended on February 1, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="saflii2008"&gt;[http://www.saflii.org/sa/cases/SADCT/2008/2.html Mike Campbell (Pvt) Ltd and Others v. Republic of Zimbabwe]&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell initiated proceedings in court on 15 May 2006, challenging the validity of Amendment 17.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt;&lt;ref name="saflii2008" /&gt; In December 2006 the Gazetted Land (Consequential Provisions) Act passed into law, requiring all farmers whose land was compulsorily acquired by the government and who were not in possession of an official offer letter, permit, or lease, to cease to occupy, hold, or use that land within 45 days and to vacate their homes within 90 days.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt; On 11 October 2007, before the Supreme Court of Zimbabwe had delivered its judgment in the case, Campbell filed an application with the SADC Tribunal challenging the acquisition by the Zimbabwean government. Subsequently, 77 other persons joined as parties in the proceedings against the government of Zimbabwe.

Mike Campbell, his wife Angela, and their son-in-law [[Ben Freeth]] were kidnapped, taken to an indoctrination camp and beaten by thugs on 29 June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zimbabwesituation.com/jun30a_2008.html "Farmer who exposed terror is kidnapped with family"], The Zimbabwe Situation, 30 June 2008. (Fourth article from the top of the page)&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell died on 6 April 2011; his family stated he died from complications of the 2008 beating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Decision by the Supreme Court of Zimbabwe==
The Supreme Court of Zimbabwe issued a decision in the case on 22 January 2008, dismissing Campbell's challenge.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.saflii.org/zw/cases/ZWSC/2008/1.html Mike Campbell (Pvt) Ltd. and Another v Minister of National Security Responsible for Land, Land Reform and Resettlement]'' (124/06) [2008] [[ZWSC]] 1 (22 January 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The Court held that: (1) race was not an issue in the case, because neither the relevant provisions of Section 16B of the Constitution nor the land acquisitions made reference to race or color; (2) the Government of Zimbabwe has an inherent right to compulsorily acquire property, and (3) the legislature has full power to change the Constitution.&lt;ref name="zimsupct"&gt;Mike Campbell (Private) Limited v. The Minister of National Security Responsible for Land, Land Reform and Resettlement, Supreme Court of Zimbabwe, 22 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The Court also stated that an "application to a court of law to challenge a lawful acquisition would in effect be an abuse of the right to protection of law."&lt;ref name="zimsupct" /&gt;

==The SADC Tribunal==
The Tribunal was established by the SADC treaty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sadc.int/index/browse/page/119#article16 Declaration and Treaty of the SADC.]&lt;/ref&gt; The SADC has been in existence since 1980, when it was formed as a loose alliance of nine majority-ruled States in Southern Africa known as the Southern African Development Coordination Conference (SADCC), with the main aim of co-ordinating development projects to lessen economic dependence on the then apartheid South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sadc.int/index/browse/page/52 SADC Profile]&lt;/ref&gt; The Tribunal ensures adherence to, and the proper interpretation of, the provisions of the Treaty and the subsidiary instruments made under it, and adjudicates upon disputes referred to it.&lt;ref name="saflii2008" /&gt;

==Decisions by the SADC Tribunal==
{{More footnotes|section|date=May 2012}}
The Tribunal concluded that it had jurisdiction to hear the case because the dispute concerned "human rights, democracy and the rule of law", which are binding principles for members of the SADC.&lt;ref name="saflii2008" /&gt;

'''17 December 2007'''&lt;br /&gt;
The Tribunal granted an [[interim]] measure ordering the government of Zimbabwe to take no steps, directly or indirectly, to evict Campbell from the farm or interfere with his use of the land.

'''28 November 2008'''&lt;br /&gt;
The Tribunal's decision on this date addressed four main issues: (1) Whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction to hear the case; (2) whether the plaintiffs had been denied access to domestic courts in violation of the SADC Treaty; (3) whether the Zimbabwean government had discriminated against the plaintiffs on the basis of race, and (4) whether the plaintiffs were entitled to compensation. (1) The Tribunal held that it had jurisdiction to hear the case, because Amendment 17 had eliminated the plaintiffs' access to the domestic courts, and the plaintiffs were therefore entitled to seek remedy before the Tribunal. (2) The Tribunal found that the plaintiffs had been deprived of their right to a fair hearing before being deprived of their rights. (3) On the racial discrimination issue, the Tribunal held that the actions of the Zimbabwean government constituted indirect or "de facto" discrimination because implementation of Amendment 17 affected white farmers only. (4) Finally, the Tribunal held that the plaintiffs were entitled to compensation for the expropriation of their lands.

'''5 June 2009'''&lt;br /&gt;
After Campbell and another applicant, Richard Thomas Etheredge, filed a new application to declare the Government of Zimbabwe in [[contempt]], the Tribunal held that the Government of Zimbabwe had failed to comply with the Tribunal's previous decision.&lt;ref&gt;In the Matter Between William Michael Campbell, Richard Thomas Etheredge and The Republic of Zimbabwe, SADC Tribunal, 5 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tribunal stated that it would report its finding to the Summit of the SADC.

==Post-decision developments==
'''Non-enforcement of the Tribunal's judgment''' &lt;br /&gt;
Mike Campbell applied to register the Tribunal's judgment of 28 November 2008 in the High Court on 23 December 2008, but the application was not accepted with no reasons given. Over a hundred prosecutions of white farmers continue because they remain on their lands.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt; The High Court issued orders in April 2009 to evict the invaders on Mount Carmel, but nothing was done by the police to enforce the orders.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt; No mention of the Tribunal's decision was made at the SADC's summit in early September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/middleeast-africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14465671 "Out with those white farmers"], ''The Economist'', 17 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Threats, intimidation and fires''' &lt;br /&gt;
After February 2009, Campbell and Freeth's families received threats from invaders. Campbell and his wife were eventually forced from their home and Mount Carmel was invaded.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt; Ben Freeth's&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article6817665.ece "Farm owned by Ben Freeth, critic of Robert Mugabe, destroyed in fire"], ''Times Online'', 2 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and Mike Campbell's&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/zimbabwean-farmer-besieged-but-defiant/article1273872 "Zimbabwean farmer besieged but defiant"], ''The Globe and Mail'', 17 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; homesteads were destroyed in fires on 30 August 2009 and 2 September 2009, respectively.

'''Zimbabwe denies the legitimacy of the Tribunal''' &lt;br /&gt;
Zimbabwe's Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa wrote to the Tribunal to inform of Zimbabwe's withdrawal from the Tribunal in a letter written on 7 August 2009, arguing that it did not have jurisdiction over Zimbabwe because the Tribunal's Protocol has not yet been ratified by two-thirds of the total members of the SADC, as required by the organisation's treaty,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thezimbabwetimes.com/?p=22107 "Zimbabwe withdraws from SADC Tribunal"], ''The Zimbabwe Times'', 2 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.amnestyusa.org/justice/sadc-tribunal-struggles-for-legitimacy "SADC Tribunal Struggles for Legitimacy"], Amnesty International USA Web Log, 3 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that Zimbabwe would no longer be bound by any of the Tribunal's past or future judgments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thezimbabwean.co.uk/2009090324142/weekday-top-stories/chinamasa-pulls-zim-out-of-sadc-tribunal-without-cabinet-approval.html "Chinamasa pulls Zim out of SADC tribunal without cabinet approval"], ''The Zimbabwean'', 3 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2011}}

'''Decision by the High Court not to register the SADC Tribunal's judgement in Zimbabwe''' &lt;br /&gt;
Judge Patel of the High Court issued a decision&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kubatana.net/docs/landr/high_court_patel_gramara_goz_100126.pdf Text of Judge Patel's decision (High Court)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swradioafrica.com/pages/sadctribunal250110.htm#summary Summary of Judge Patel's decision.]&lt;/ref&gt; on 26 January 2010 in which he held that the SADC Tribunal was properly constituted and had jurisdiction to hear Campbell's case, but its decision could not be registered for purposes of enforcement. Judge Patel's decision relied on two main reasons. First, the Supreme Court of Zimbabwe had confirmed the constitutionality of the land reform program, and registering the SADC Tribunal's judgment in Zimbabwe would challenge the Supreme Court's decision and undermine its authority; this would be contrary to public policy. Second, if the Zimbabwean government complied with the SADC Tribunal's decision, it would contravene section 16B of the Constitution (introduced by Amendment 17 in 2005, see [[Mike Campbell (Pvt) Ltd and Others v Republic of Zimbabwe#Background|above]]); this could not be allowed because the Constitution is the supreme law of Zimbabwe.

'''The SADC Summit orders a review of the role, functions and terms of the SADC Tribunal''' &lt;br /&gt;
On 17 August 2010 the Summit of the SADC heads of state and government decided "that a review of the role functions and terms [sic] of reference of the SADC Tribunal should be undertaken and concluded within 6 months."&lt;ref name="ST"&gt;{{cite news

In a draft report&lt;ref&gt;''Review of the Role, Responsibilities and Terms of Reference of the SADC Tribunal'', WTI Advisors, Dr. Lorand Bartels, 14 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;commissioned by the SADC and dated 14 February 2011, WTI Advisors (an affiliate of the World Trade Institute) recommended, among other things, the following: SADC Member States should ensure that they give the force of law to SADC law by amending national law; Member States should consider amending the SADC Treaty to state that SADC law is supreme over national law, including constitutional law; the Tribunal should be given power to determine its own Rules of Procedure; the Tribunal's Protocol should be amended to provide that membership and rights of Member States may be suspended, with the Summit taking account of the possible consequences of suspension; the Tribunal should be able to order remedies (including fines) for non-compliance.

'''Legal action against heads of State''' &lt;br /&gt;
In April 2011 Mike Campbell, his company Mike Campbell (Pvt) Ltd, and another farmer, Luke Tembani, applied to the courts for an order against the 'Summit of the Heads of State or Government of SADC' and the presidents of 15 member countries, the Council of Ministers of SADC, and the Republic of Zimbabwe, demanding that ''the [SADC] Tribunal continues to function in all respects as established by Article 16 of the Treaty''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zimbabwereporter.com/politics/2959.html Evicted Zimbabwean farmers sue SADC leaders for dissolving Tribunal] Zimbabwe Reporter, published 2011-04-04&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SADC Tribunal suspended''' &lt;br /&gt;
On 20 May 2011, an Extraordinary Summit of Heads of State and Government of SADC, held in Namibia, decided not to reappoint or replace SADC Tribunal members, effectively suspending the tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/08/11/sadc-qa-tribunal SADC: Q&amp;A on The Tribunal – Regional Court’s Future Hangs in the Balance] [[Human Rights Watch]], published 2011-08-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zimbabwedemocracynow.com/2011/05/26/sadc-tribunal-rights-watch-statement/ SADC Tribunal Rights Watch – Statement] zimbabwedemocracynow.com, published 2011-05-26&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Minimum harmonisation''' is a term used in [[European Union law]].

If a piece of law (usually a [[Directive (European Union)|directive]], but also a [[Regulation (European Union)|regulation]] on occasion), is described as minimum harmonisation, that means that it sets a threshold which national legislation must meet.  However, national law may exceed the terms of the legislation if desired.  

It is usually easier to reach agreement on legislation drafted on this basis, as it allows existing national legislation on issues such as [[consumer protection]] or [[environment (biophysical)|the environment]] to remain in place.  Therefore, most European legislation has been implemented on this basis.  In more recent years, however, the burden of EC law has led to calls for [[deregulation]], and accusations that some member states still indulge in [[protectionism]] when implementing directives into national law through [[Gold-plating (European Union law)|gold-plating]].  Therefore, a growing minority of EU law contains [[maximum harmonisation]] provisions.

It is quite common for a directive or recommendation to consist of a mixture of maximum harmonisation and minimum harmonisation clauses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8003">[[File:Mikolas Burokevicus.jpg|thumb|Burokevičius in February 2006]]

'''Mykolas Burokevičius''' (October 7, 1927 – January 20, 2016) was a communist political leader in [[Lithuania]]. After the [[Communist Party of Lithuania]] separated from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU), he established alternative pro-CPSU Communist Party of Lithuania in early 1990, and led it as the First Secretary of Central Committee until its ban in 1991. He was the only Lithuanian to serve in the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee]], and did so from 1990 until its ban in 1991.

== Biography ==
He was born in [[Alytus]], Lithuania  in 1927. In 1942, a young Burokevičius was employed as a carpenter and a machinist at a plant in [[Udmurtia]]. In 1944 he became a member of the Lithuanian Communist Party where he worked as a chief of department and instructor. He graduated from the Vilnius Pedagogical Institute (now the [[Lithuanian University of Educational Sciences]]) in 1955 and the [[Lithuanian Academy of Sciences]] in 1963.

In 1963 he became a research fellow at the Institute of the History of the Party of the Central Committee of the Lithuanian Communist Party. He died in [[Vilnius]], Lithuania in 2016, aged 88.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lietuvosdiena.lrytas.lt/aktualijos/mire-perversmininkas-mykolas-burokevicius.htm |title=Mirė perversmininkas Mykolas Burokevičius &amp;#124; Aktualijos &amp;#124; LIETUVOS DIENA&amp;#124; LIETUVOS NAUJIENOS |publisher=Lietuvosdiena.lrytas.lt |date= |accessdate=2016-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political activities ==
After the Communist Party of Lithuania voted to separate from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in December 1989, he became the Secretary General of the Moscow-backed communist party and on March 4, 1990 he gained the title of the First Secretary.

His party's political programme stated that one of its goals was to maintain Lithuania as part of the USSR. Seven members of Burokevičius' party were elected during the [[Supreme Council of Lithuania]] elections on 24 February 1990. The Supreme Council declared [[Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania|reinstantment of Lithuania's independence]] during its first session in March.

On 11 January 1991 the pro-CPSU CPL sent an ultimatum to the Government of Lithuania, ordering it to comply with USSR President [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s public requirement that the Supreme Council would immediately reinstate the legal force of the USSR and [[Lithuanian SSR]] Constitutions. The requirement was voiced one day earlier. The party added that failing that it might create the "Lithuanian National Rescue Committee" ({{lang-lt|Lietuvos nacionalinio gelbėjimo komitetas}}), "which would take care of the matters of the future of the LSSR" - and eventually did so. During its lifetime, the party established several organizations meant to be alternative ministries.

The [[January Events|Soviet Army assault on the Vilnius TV tower and station]] on January 13, 1991 followed, during which 14 people were killed. During the period of 11 to 19 January 1991, the pro-CPSU party also made five more public declarations urging the forceful overthrow of the Government and other authorities of independent Lithuania. Burokevičius took part preparing those declarations.

== Lawsuit ==
Burokevičius was indicted by Lithuanian prosecutors as a suspect in a criminal with regard to the [[January Events]] case on 22 August 1991. He was eventually arrested on January 15, 1994 in [[Belarus]] (on Lithuanian orders). Burokevičius and five other members of the Lithuanian Communist Party were tried for their involvement in the January Events from October 1996 to August 1999. In August 1999, he was sentenced in Vilnius to 12 years' imprisonment for organizing murders and grievous bodily harm and also for establishing organizations which intended to overthrow the state. In early 2000, President [[Valdas Adamkus]] proposed the chief of colony to prepare documents that granted Burokevičius eligibility for pardon. Burokevičius refused this request, pleading innocent and stating that he was not guilty in his actions.&lt;ref name="nashsovr"&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.komunist.com.ua/article/15/2247.htm Быть достойным своих убеждений (Беседа Александра Казинцева с доктором исторических наук профессором Миколасом Бурокявичюсом)]&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the sentence and was released on January 13, 2006.

On January 5, 2006, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] declared admissible &lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=791734&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 European Court of Human Rights decision]&lt;/ref&gt; Burokevičius' case against Lithuania on three counts of possible [[Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]] violations and joined it with two other cases against Lithuania for its January Events lawsuits ([[Juozas Kuolelis]] and [[Leonas Bartoševičius]]). Burokevičius also sought compensation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neurope.eu/article/jailed-former-communist-leader-thanks-lucky-stars Jailed former communist leader thanks lucky stars]. New Europe. 19 October 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, the court examined whether Lithuania violated these articles of the convention:

* [[Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms#Article 6 - right to a fair trial|Article 6]] - i.e. spent more than a "reasonable time" awaiting court proceedings
* [[Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms#Article 7 - No punishment without law|Article 7]] - i.e. sentenced a person for actions which were not crimes at the time under Lithuanian law (Burokevičius holds that Lithuanian state came into existence only after the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991]], and cannot apply its judiciary system for earlier events)
* Articles [[Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms#Article 9 - right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion|9]], [[Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms#Article 10 - right to freedom of expression|10]] and [[Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms#Article 11 - right to freedom of assembly and association|11]] and [[Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms#Article 14 - prohibition of discrimination|14]] (Burokevičius and others claim that they had been unjustly punished in the exercise of their beliefs as communists, their legitimate work as journalists, their right of association with other individuals, and their support for the idea of Lithuania's continuing membership of the USSR during the politically turbulent times of 1990-1991)

In 2008, the Court delivered judgment deciding that no violations took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=829153&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 |title=HUDOC - European Court of Human Rights |publisher=Cmiskp.echr.coe.int |date= |accessdate=2016-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Evidence law}}
'''Physician–patient privilege''' is a legal concept, related to [[confidentiality|medical confidentiality]], that protects communications between a patient and his or her [[Physician|doctor]] from being used against the patient in court. It is a part of the rules of [[evidence]] in many [[common law]] jurisdictions. Almost every jurisdiction that recognizes physician–patient privilege not to testify in court, either by statute or through case law, limits the privilege to knowledge acquired during the course of providing medical services. In some jurisdictions, conversations between a patient and physician may be privileged in both criminal and civil courts.

==Scope==
The privilege may cover the situation where a patient confesses to a psychiatrist that he or she committed a particular crime. It may also cover normal inquiries regarding matters such as injuries that may result in civil action. For example, any [[defendant]] that the patient may be suing at the time cannot ask the doctor if the patient ever expressed the belief that his or her condition had improved. However, the rule generally does not apply to confidences shared with physicians when they are not serving in the role of medical providers.

The rationale behind the rule is that a level of trust must exist between a physician and the patient so that the physician can properly treat the patient. If the patient were fearful of telling the truth to the physician because he or she believed the physician would report such behavior to the authorities, the treatment process could be rendered far more difficult, or the physician could make an incorrect diagnosis.

For example, a below-[[age of consent]] patient came to a doctor with a [[sexually transmitted disease]]. The doctor is usually required to obtain a list of the patient's sexual contacts to inform them that they need treatment. This is an important health concern. However, the patient may be reluctant to divulge the names of his/her older sexual partners, for fear that they will be charged with [[statutory rape]]. In some jurisdictions, the doctor cannot be forced to reveal the information revealed by his patient to anyone except to particular organizations, as specified by law, and they too are required to keep that information confidential. If, in the case, the police become aware of such information, they are not allowed to use it in court as proof of the sexual conduct, except as provided by express intent of the legislative body and formalized into law.&lt;ref&gt;American / English Encyclopedia of the Law Page 611, Paragraph 27, 8th Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

The law in [[Ontario]], Canada, requires that physicians report patients who, in the opinion of the physician, may be unfit to drive for medical reasons as per Section 203 of the [[Highway Traffic Act (Ontario)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/dandv/driver/medical-review/physicians.shtml|title=Medical Review - Physicians' Reporting Requirements|first=Government of Ontario, Ministry of|last=Transportation|website=www.mto.gov.on.ca|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law in New Hampshire places physician–patient communications on the same basis as attorney–client communications, except in cases where law enforcement officers seek blood or urine test samples and test results taken from a patient who is being investigated for driving while intoxicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/XXX/329/329-26.htm|title=Section 329:26 Confidential Communications.|website=www.gencourt.state.nh.us|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the [[United States]], the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] do not recognize doctor–patient privilege.

At the state level, the extent of the privilege varies depending on the law of the applicable jurisdiction. For example, in [[Texas]] there is only a limited physician–patient privilege in criminal proceedings, and the privilege is limited in civil cases as well.&lt;ref&gt;Texas Occupations Code section 159.003 and Texas Rules of Evidence, Rule 509(b)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
In some{{Which|date=November 2018}} [[Australian States]] a privilege exists for'' "communication made by a person in confidence to another person .... in the course of a relationship in which the confidant was acting in a professional capacity".''{{Quote without source|date=November 2018}} This is often interpreted as being between a health professional and their patient.{{By}}

In some [[jurisdiction]]s in [[Australia]] privilege may also extend to [[lawyer]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/xref/inforce/?xref=Type%3Dact%20AND%20Year%3D1995%20AND%20no%3D25&amp;nohits=y NSW Evidence Act 1995 s117].&lt;/ref&gt; some Victims&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/xref/inforce/?xref=Type%3Dact%20AND%20Year%3D1995%20AND%20no%3D25&amp;nohits=y NSW Evidence Act 1995].&lt;/ref&gt;  [[journalist]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/xref/inforce/?xref=Type%3Dact%20AND%20Year%3D1995%20AND%20no%3D25&amp;nohits=y  Evidence Act 1995 No 25 s126K].&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Shield law|Shield Law]]s), and [[Catholic priest|priest]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/xref/inforce/?xref=Type%3Dact%20AND%20Year%3D1995%20AND%20no%3D25&amp;nohits=y  [[NSW Evidence Act]] 1995 s127].&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be invoked in a [[Public interest]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/xref/inforce/?xref=Type%3Dact%20AND%20Year%3D1995%20AND%20no%3D25&amp;nohits=y Evidence Act 1995 s129].&lt;/ref&gt; or Settlement Negotiations&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/xref/inforce/?xref=Type%3Dact%20AND%20Year%3D1995%20AND%20no%3D25&amp;nohits=y NSW Evidence Act 1995 s131].&lt;/ref&gt;  may also be [[privilege (evidence)|privileged]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/xref/inforce/?xref=Type%3Dact%20AND%20Year%3D1995%20AND%20no%3D25&amp;nohits=y|title=NSW Evidence Act 1995 section 126A.|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Relfo Ltd (in liq) v Varsani''''' [2014] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2014/360.html EWCA Civ 360] is an [[English unjust enrichment law]] case, concerning to what extent enrichment of the defendant must be at the expense of the claimant.

==Facts==
The liquidator of Relfo Ltd sued Varsani, a friend of the former director Mr Gorecia, who got money from the company. HMRC had sued Relfo Ltd for outstanding tax, whereupon Relfo Ltd put the £500,000 it had in its bank account to pay $890,050 into a [[Latvia]]n account of Mirren Ltd, and then coincidentally an entity called Intertrade paid $878,469 from a Lithuanian bank account to Varsani. Shortly after Mr Varsani gave Mr Gorecia $100,000 The liquidator argued this was all connected, and the $100,000 was Mr Gorecia’s reward for diverting Relfo’s funds for Varsani’s benefit. Therefore, Relfo Ltd retained a title in equity over the funds that Mr Varsani held, that Varsani was on notice of the facts at all times and so was a constructive trustee, and that even if tracing was not possible the payments were connected enough to base an unjust enrichment claim.

==Judgment==

===High Court===
Sales J held the liquidator could recover the money. A proprietary argument against Varsani failed because the funds were dissipated and the liquidator had not applied for an order (which could have been done) to disclose where the funds went, which would be necessary for a tracing exercise. However, Varsani was a knowing recipient, it was a fair inference that all the transactions were linked, there was no reason for the Intertrade payment. His conscience would be affected as a constructive trustee because it was high probable that Gorecia had explained Mr Varsani the whole arrangement, cf ''[[Re Montagu’s ST]]'' [1987] Ch 264. He was liable to account for the whole Intertrade payment without any reduction for the $100,000 transferred. And, even if the Intertrade payment could not be traced from the payment between Relfo Ltd and Mirren Ltd, Varsani was enriched at Relfo’s expense, as the payments were made in breach of Mr Gorecia’s fiduciary duty, without authority and established an in personam claim against Mr Varsani. Liability was strict and did not depend on knowledge or conscience. Mr Varsani had given no defence, and so he received the money as a volunteer.

===Court of Appeal===
The Court of Appeal held that the liquidator of Relfo Ltd was entitled to be repaid money that had ended up in Versani’s hands because the sums were causally linked through various transactions.

[[Arden LJ]] held that Sales J was right to draw the inference that Relfo Ltd’s money passed into Intertrade’s account, and this made the source of money paid to Varsani, as in El-Ajou, based on the amounts and the timing of  the payment to Mirren and the Intertrade payment, because the amount Varsani received was the same as the Relfo Ltd to Mirren payment, because no consideration was given, and because this is what Gorecia had intended. An intention alone would not be enough under the tracing rules, but could be relevant for drawing an inference. What mattered was that value was exchanged, in a chain of substitutes.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Foskett v McKeown]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Payments did not need to occur in chronological or any other particular order. Although not necessary, in a claim for [[unjust enrichment]], it did not matter that Varsani had not received the Intertrade payment directly from Relfo Ltd. In substance and economic reality Varsani had been a direct recipient.&lt;ref&gt;cf ''[[ITC v HMRC]]'' [2012] EWHC 458 (Ch)&lt;/ref&gt; Arden LJ said the following.

{{Cquote|74. On this appeal, Mr Salter submits that, if Relfo has no [[Tracing in English law|tracing]] claim, it likewise has no claim in [[unjust enrichment]]. Mr Salter submits that the cases show that normally the defendant has to be a person to whom the claimant directly transferred the benefit. Mr Salter accepts that there are a number of exceptions, for example, where a tracing claim is available. The present position, submits Mr Salter, is that there is no general principle. He relies on section 8 of A Restatement of the English Law of Unjust Enrichment by Professor [[Andrew Burrows]], (Oxford, 2012) ("the Restatement"). This valuable work presents the position in the following way:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"8 At the claimant's expense: general

        (1) The defendant's enrichment is at the claimant's expense if the benefit obtained by the defendant is-

            (a) from the claimant and

            (b) directly from the claimant rather than by way of another person.

        (2) In any of the following cases, it does not matter that the benefit obtained by the defendant (D) is from the claimant (C) by way of another person (X) –

            (a) where X transfers as an asset to D but C has a better right to that asset than X;

            (b) where X transfers an asset to D but X was holding the asset on trust for C;

            (c) where X is acting as C's agent in respect of the benefit;

            (d) where X charges and receives from C an amount representing tax on X's supply of goods and services to C and pays or accounts for that amount to D (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) as tax due;

            (e) where C is subrogated to X's (or another's) present or former rights against D in a situation where the benefit was supplied to D by X;

            (f) where X was under a legal obligation to supply the benefit to C but instead supplied the benefit to D and –

            (i) the supply to D discharged X's obligation to C, or

            (ii) the supply to D was in breach of X's fiduciary duty to C but C's claim against X has been exhausted.

        (3) In a contract for the benefit of a third party, the third party's benefit is to be treated as obtained directly from the contracting party who required the benefit to be supplied rather than from the contracting party who supplied it.

        (4) Even if the benefit obtained by the defendant is directly from the claimant, the enrichment is generally not at the claimant's expense if the benefit is merely incidental to the furtherance by the claimant of an objective unconnected with the defendant's enrichment."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

75. Professor Burrows calls the principle now set out in section 8 "the direct providers only" rule, though he accepts there are exceptions to it. I will therefore refer to it as "the DPR". Section 8 is a very useful point of reference but I must not be taken as accepting that, if there is a DPR, section 8 contains an exhaustive list of the exceptions.

76. Mr Salter also accepts that some writers have favoured a wider principle than the DPR, such as the editors of Goff &amp; Jones on ''The Law of Unjust Enrichment'' (8th ed, 2011) at paras 6-18 and 6-25, Stephen Watterson, ''Direct Transfers in the Law of Unjust Enrichment'', Current Legal Problems 64 (2011), pp 435-470, [[Charles Mitchell (professor)|Charles Mitchell]], "Liability Chains" in ''Unjust Enrichment in Commercial Law'', ed. Degeling and Edelman (2008) and Professor [[Peter Birks]], ''Unjust Enrichment'' (2nd ed) pp 94-5.

77. Mr Salter accepts that Mr Bhimji Varsani cannot rely on any defence: in particular he does not now claim that he was a bona fide purchaser of the Intertrade payment.

78. The DPR raises some immediate questions. Why should the law impose a rule that there can be no claim in unjust enrichment unless the defendant happens to receive the benefit directly from the claimant rather than from the claimant via a third party, and then allow a long list of what might be called ad hoc exceptions? The answer to this question is that DPR is a rule about limiting the substitution of new property or rights for the property which leaves the claimant's hands. It may be very unjust to allow the claimant to recover the new property or rights if he has no tracing claim, for example, where the immediate recipient made a gift to the defendant of an amount equal to what he had received from the claim and this transaction of gift was independent of his transaction with the claimant. The claimant may, moreover, end up being able to recover his property from a number of defendants at different stages in the chain.

79. On this basis, the "exceptions" represent the boundaries (thus far ascertained) of recoverability for indirect unjust enrichment. It is not enough for the claimant to show the defendant is better off by the amount by which the claimant is worse off. That does not even satisfy a "but for" test of causation. Some greater link is required to be shown.

80. Likewise the list of exceptions raises questions. The exceptions are a motley collection. Some of them are principles from other areas of law, such as trust law, and some of them are remedies, such as subrogation, which do not constitute a basis of liability. They are not, therefore, principles for imposing liability for unjust enrichment carved out of the DPR.

81. Mr Salter's submissions involve the analysis of a large number of authorities, including ''[[Filby v Mortgage Express (No 2) Ltd]]'' [2004] EWCA Civ 759, ''[[Banque Financière de la Cité v Parc Battersea Ltd]]'' [1991] 1 AC 221 and ''[[Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Birmingham City Council]]'' [1997] QB 380. We were also taken for completeness to ''[[Gibbs v Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust]]'' [2010] EWCA Civ 678, and ''[[Uren v First National Home Finance Ltd]]'' [2005] EWHC 2529 (Ch) but they do not significantly assist on the question of whether a principle exists which defines when a claimant can succeed on his claim in unjust enrichment against an indirect recipient.

82. Mr Salter accepts that the decision of Henderson J in ''[[Investment Trust Companies v HMRC]]'' [2012] EWHC 458 (Ch); [2012] STC 1150 ("ITC") is the first case in which the question of the nature of the connection has been squarely addressed. In that case, clients of Investment Management Companies sought to recover overpaid VAT from the HMRC, to whom it was paid by their investment managers, on the basis that the HMRC had been unjustly enriched, indirectly at their expense. The managers had not reclaimed this VAT. Henderson J held:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[68] The real question, therefore, is whether claims of the present type should be treated as exceptions to the general rule. So far as I am aware, no exhaustive list of criteria for the recognition of exceptions has yet been put forward by proponents of the general rule, and I think it is safe to assume that the usual preference of English law for development in a pragmatic and step-by-step fashion will prevail. Nevertheless, in the search for principle a number of relevant considerations have been identified, including (in no particular order):

    (a)     the need for a close causal connection between the payment by the claimant and the enrichment of the indirect recipient;

    (b)     the need to avoid any risk of double recovery, often coupled with a suggested requirement that the claimant should first be required to exhaust his remedies against the direct recipient;

    (c)     the need to avoid any conflict with contracts between the parties, and in particular to prevent 'leapfrogging' over an immediate contractual counterparty in a way which would undermine the contract; and

    (d)     the need to confine the remedy to disgorgement of undue enrichment, and not to allow it to encroach into the territory of compensation or damages."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

83. Henderson J came to his conclusion that the weight of authority was in favour of the DPR with a limited number of exceptions after very careful consideration of all but two of the authorities cited by Mr Salter. Little purpose would be served by my performing the same exercise as I agree with his analysis of those cases.

84. Faced with that authority, Henderson J concluded that there was no authority which required him to hold that there was any general principle which allowed unjust enrichment claims against indirect recipients. He held that such guidance as was available to him suggested that there was no general principle, so far as claims against indirect recipients were concerned. There was only a list of exceptions. He did not regard that as a closed list but went on to identify the criteria in paragraph 68, which I have set out above. He effectively created the exception now found in section 8(2)(d) of the Restatement.

[...]

88. For reasons which I develop below, I consider that the judge's ultimate conclusion was correct notwithstanding the withdrawal of the concession in this court. Furthermore, in my judgment, Menelaou supports the argument that, where the defendant is not the direct recipient of the benefit provided by the claimant, and the claimant has no proprietary right to any asset in the defendant's hands, unjust enrichment may be available on the basis of a general principle rather than on the basis of bringing the case within (say) one of the specific situations in section 8 of the Restatement.

[...]

90. This court found particular support for this approach in two of the cases cited to us. The first was ''Banque Financière''. In that case, as Floyd LJ explains, in order to circumvent disclosure obligations a bank lent money first to the general manager (Mr Herzig) of the bank who in turn lent the money to another company who used it to discharge a loan from RTB, another bank. The Appellate Committee of the House of Lords was unimpressed by the fact that Mr Herzig was interposed as borrower and lender. [[Lord Hoffmann]], with whom a majority of the House agreed, held that to allow the interposition of Mr Herzig to alter the substance of the transaction would be pure formalism. He further held:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I think it should be recognised that one is here concerned with a restitutionary remedy and that the appropriate questions are therefore, first, whether the defendant would be enriched at the plaintiff's expense; secondly, whether such enrichment would be unjust and thirdly, whether there are nevertheless reasons of policy for denying a remedy. An example of a case which failed on the third ground is Orakpo v Manson Investments Ltd. [1975] AC 95, in which it was considered that restitution would be contrary to the terms and policy of the Moneylenders Acts."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

91. The second case was Filby v Mortgage Express. In that case, again as Floyd LJ explains, Mr and Mrs Filby's matrimonial home was subject to a mortgage in favour of the Halifax. They also had an unsecured development loan account with the Midland Bank. Mr Filby sought to remortgage the matrimonial home with Mortgage Express. The mortgage advance was paid to solicitors who used part of it to redeem the Halifax mortgage and another part in the reduction of the debit balance on the development loan account with the Midland. However, Mrs Filby had not signed the mortgage, and so, as against her, it was void. Mortgage Express claimed to be subrogated, amongst other things, to the rights of the Midland Bank against Mrs Filby to the extent that the joint debt to them had been discharged with their money. This court considered the unjust enrichment claim obiter. At [62] May LJ stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Accordingly so far as is relevant to this appeal, the remedy of equitable subrogation is a restitutionary remedy available to reverse what would otherwise be unjust enrichment of a defendant at the expense of the claimant. The defendant is enriched if his financial position is materially improved, usually as here where the defendant is relieved of a financial burden – see Peter Birks, An Introduction to The Law of Restitution page 93. The enrichment will be at the expense of the claimant if in reality it was the claimant's money which effected the improvement. Subject to special defences, questions of policy or exceptional circumstances affecting the balance of justice, the enrichment will be unjust if the claimant did not get the security he bargained for when he advanced the money which in reality effected the improvement, and if the defendant's financial improvement is properly seen as a windfall. The remedy does not extend to giving the claimant more than he bargained for. The remedy is not limited to cases where either or both the claimant and defendant intended that the money advanced should be used to effect the improvement. It is sufficient that it was in fact in reality so used. The remedy is flexible and adaptable to produce a just result. Within this framework, the remedy is discretionary in the sense that at each stage it is a matter of judgment whether on the facts the necessary elements are fulfilled."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

92. I agree with Henderson J that the "reality" which May LJ was invoking was not confined to strictly legal reality, but could in appropriate circumstances include a broader underlying commercial or economic reality (judgment, [65]).

93. This court accepted in ''Menelaou'' that the bank had released the charge over the parents' house with a view to its obtaining security over the daughter's house. The majority relied on economic reality. Moses LJ, however, did not think it was necessary to rely on economic reality as such on the grounds that this test was uncertain and that a decision-maker might use this concept because he was unable to articulate his real reasoning.

94. This court also relied on the fact that there had been a transfer of value, but given that there had been no transfer of value in law, this does not detract from the reasoning based on economic reality. In all the circumstances, Floyd LJ concluded at [42] of his judgment:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whilst the precise range of relevant factors which are relevant may require consideration in other cases, for my part I would hold that there was a sufficiently close causal connection in the present case between the Bank's agreement to part with its estate in Rush Green Hall and the enrichment of Melissa to hold that Melissa was enriched at the Bank's expense."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

95. Menelaou is, of course, a case about subrogation and thus one only of the exceptions listed in section 8(2) of the Restatement. Nonetheless, particularly read with the passage from the speech of Lord Hoffmann in ''Banque Financière'' and the dictum of May LJ set out above, the decision strongly supports the view that the law is moving towards identification of a general principle. Overall the court must find that there is a sufficient link between the formation of the transaction whereby the claimant conferred a benefit on the direct recipient (or was entitled to receive a benefit) and the transaction under which the defendant obtained a benefit to make the enrichment unjust. I do not read the judgments of Gloster and Floyd LJJ as taking any different view on that point. Moreover, in deciding whether there is a sufficient link, the court will look at the substance and not the form.

96. Any principle for unjust enrichment against indirect recipients will have to be refined in later cases. For now, the criteria identified by Henderson J will no doubt be of assistance. They identify important policy considerations for the application of the law in this area. As I see it, they are consistent with there being some ultimate general principle.}}

[[Gloster LJ]] concurred.

[[Floyd LJ]] concurred, and said the following.

{{Cquote| [...] Short of applying the rigid exclusionary rule based on direct transfers only, the judge was bound to conclude on these particular facts that there was a sufficient causal connection between Relfo's loss and Bhimji Varsani's gain to provide for a remedy in unjust enrichment. I cannot accept the suggestion that the intervening and meaningless arrangements orchestrated by Mr Gorecia, which had no other purpose than to disguise the source of the funds diverted from Relfo, changed what would otherwise have been a direct payment into one which the law will not recognise as sufficiently proximate.}}

'''Rudolf Callmann''' (29 September 1892 – 12 March 1976&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/03/15/archives/rudolph-callmann-83-dies-lawyer-aided-jewish-refugees.html |title=Rudolph Callmann, 83, Dies; Lawyer Aided Jewish Refugees |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=15 March 1976 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[German American]] legal scholar. He was preeminent in the field of German and American [[competition law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baums |first=Theodor |chapter=Rechtsnorm und richterliche Entscheidung im Wettbewerbsrecht – Der Beitrag Rudolf Callmanns zur deutschen und amerikanischen Rechtsentwicklung |title=Der Einfluß deutscher Emigranten auf die Rechtsentwicklung in den USA und in Deutschland |editor-last=Lutter |editor-first=Marcus |year=1993 |location=Tübingen |publisher=Mohr |isbn=3-16-146080-4 |pages=63–84 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Cologne]] into a wealthy [[Ashkenazi Jew|Jewish]] family, Callmann earned a [[doctorate]] in law from the [[University of Freiburg]] in 1919. His studies had been interrupted by frontline service in [[World War I]]. In 1923, he entered his father's law firm in Cologne, and established himself as a leading authority on [[unfair competition]] and [[antitrust law]]. As a [[German Jewish military personnel of World War I|World War I veteran]] he was [[Anti-Jewish legislation in prewar Nazi Germany|allowed]] to practice even after the [[Machtergreifung]] in 1933, but in 1936 decided to emigrate to the [[United States]]. He was offered a research fellowship at [[Harvard Law School]], where he worked with [[Zechariah Chafee]], while getting accustomed to American [[common law]], and in 1939 he passed the [[bar exam]]. Between 1939 and 1945 he completed the American edition of his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] on unfair competition, now (in revised edition) known as ''Callmann on Unfair Competition, Trademarks, and Monopolies''.

In 1949, Callmann founded the [[boutique law firm]] [[Greene, Callmann &amp; Durr]] in [[New York City]], along with Orville N. Greene (1908–1997) and Frank L. Durr (1904–1990), where he practiced until 1971.

{{nihongo|'''Sakae Menda'''|免田栄|Menda Sakae|extra=born November 4, 1925}} is a [[Japan]]ese man who was convicted of a double [[homicide]], in 1948, but was later [[exonerated|exonerated by retrial]] in 1983. This was the first time anyone was ever released from [[death penalty|death row]] by retrial in Japan. He is now a leading figure in Japan for the movement to abolish the death penalty.&lt;ref name=JapanTimes&gt;McNeill, David; Mason, C. M. (August 4, 2007). [http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20070408x2.html "One who has lived to tell the tale"]. ''[[The Japan Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
On December 30, 1948, an unknown killer broke into the house of a 76-year-old [[Buddhist]] priest and his 52-year-old wife in [[Kumamoto Prefecture]] on [[Kyushu]] and murdered them using an axe and a knife. The killer also wounded their two young daughters, aged 12 and 14. During the same period, Sakae Menda, a poor and uneducated farmhand, was arrested on the charge of stealing rice.&lt;ref name=JapanTimes/&gt;

==Arrest and trial==
[[Law enforcement in Japan|Police]] held Menda for three weeks, without allowing him access to a lawyer, until they extracted a confession. During [[interrogation]], he was starved of food, water and sleep, and beaten with [[bamboo]] sticks while being suspended upside down from a ceiling. The police eventually coerced Menda into signing a written statement. He was tried and was convicted of double homicide despite pleading innocent. On March 23, 1950, Judge Haruo Kinoshita sentenced him to death. The [[Supreme Court of Japan]] upheld his sentence on December 25, 1951. A [[lawyer]] only came to see Menda once before the trial. The lawyer, a Buddhist monk, came to pray for him, but offered no professional expertise to help him fight the charges, but instead told Menda to accept his fate. His trial did not include any physical evidence or the witness accounts that proved Menda had an [[alibi]]. He was wrongly convicted of murder and robbery based on the extorted confession.&lt;ref name=JapanTimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&amp;dat=19830716&amp;id=eiETAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TAYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1835,2966610 "Free After 12,598 Days"]. ''[[Ocala Star Banner]]'' July 16, 1983. p. 1B. [[Google News]]. Retrieved March 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incarceration==
Menda was incarcerated at the [[Fukuoka]] Detention Center in [[solitary confinement]]. He was held in a 5 square meter unheated cell that was lit day and night and monitored constantly.&lt;ref name=JapanTimes/&gt;

Under the Japanese 1907 penal code, death row inmates, unless they are involved in legal appeals, could be taken away for execution at prison [[gallows]] at any time, with little notice. Executions in Japan are typically held in secret, and prisoners are either not warned of their impending execution or are notified only on the morning of the day of the execution. Their families are informed later so they can collect the corpse for cremation.&lt;ref&gt;Pilkington, Ed (November 16, 2007). [http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2007/11/16/2003388123 "Three stories of innocents on death row"]. ''[[Taipei Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In prison, Menda converted to [[Christianity]] and began reading the [[Bible]] and transcribing books into [[Braille]].&lt;ref name=JapanTimes/&gt;

==Retrial==
Menda submitted six petitions for retrial although initially he did not have access to a lawyer. The Fukuoka District High Court ruled on the reopening of the case in 1979.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

The retrial began on September 27, 1979. The retrial allowed records that proved his alibi to be submitted, as well as a statement from a witness saying that she had lied under duress.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

On July 15, 1983, after 80 judges had been involved, the court delivered the verdict of an acquittal based on determination that he had falsely confessed and that the prosecution had failed to disclose [[exculpatory evidence]] to Menda's lawyers prior to his trial. The court acknowledged that the police had concealed his alibi showing he was not at the scene of the crime. Menda was released after 34 years on death row at the age of 54. He was the first person in Japan’s history to be released from death row.&lt;ref&gt;McGue, Kevin (June 15, 2009). [http://www.japantoday.com/category/features/view/hung-jury "Hung jury"].

'''Tangible property''' in law is, literally, anything which can be touched, and includes both [[real property]]  and [[personal property]] (or moveable property), and stands in distinction to [[intangible property]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In [[English law]] and some [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] legal systems, items of tangible property are referred to as ''choses in possession'' (or a ''chose in possession'' in the singular). However, some property, despite being physical in nature, is classified in many legal systems as intangible property rather than tangible property because the rights associated with the physical item are of far greater significance than the physical properties.  Principally, these are documentary intangibles.  For example, a [[promissory note]] is a piece of paper that can be touched, but the real significance is not the physical paper, but the legal rights which the paper confers, and hence the promissory note is defined by the legal debt rather than the physical attributes.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

A unique category of property is [[money]], which in some legal systems is treated as tangible property and in others as intangible property.  Whilst most countries legal tender is expressed in the form of intangible property ("The Treasury of Country X hereby promises to pay to the bearer on demand...."), in practice [[Banknote|banknotes]] are now rarely ever redeemed in any country, which has led to banknotes and coins being classified as tangible property in most modern legal systems.

'''Theodore Frank Thomas Plucknett''' (2 January 1897 – 14 February 1965&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Frederick Bernays Wiener|title = Studies in English Legal History. By T.F.T. Plucknett. Hambledon Press; London. $40.00. (ABA members, $30.00.) 352 pages.|publisher = ABA Journal|date = April 1984|url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a British legal historian who was the first ever chair of legal history at the [[London School of Economics]].

Plucknett was born on 2 January 1897 in Bristol. Plucknett completed his early education at [[Alderman Newton's School]] in Leicester and then [[Bacup and Rawstenstall]] school in [[Newchurch, Lancashire]]. He completed his degree in History at [[London University]] and graduated with second class honours.&lt;ref name="ONDB"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Milsom  | first = S. F.

He was also awarded the Alexander prize of the [[Royal Historical Society]]. For his masters Plucknett's speciality was the fifteenth-century council; he would later go on to write his PhD thesis on ''Statutes and their Interpretation in the First Half of the Fourteenth Century''. He received his PhD from [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]] and studied under the tutorship of [[Harold Hazeltine|H. D. Hazeltine]].&lt;ref name="ONDB"/&gt;

With Plucknett's PhD came an LLB degree, which helped him get into [[Harvard Law School]].&lt;ref name="ONDB"/&gt; Whilst studying at Harvard he took no courses, and instead only studied. He arrived at the school as a student in 1920 and by 1923 was an instructor.&lt;ref name="ONDB"/&gt; By 1926 he had graduated to an assistant professor; a position he held until 1931.&lt;ref name="ONDB"/&gt;

Plucknett then left Harvard for the London School of Economics&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Chafee Jr.  | first = Zechariah   | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = Colonial Courts and the Common Law  | journal = Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society  | volume = 68  | issue =  | pages = 149  | publisher = Massachusetts Historical Society  | date =  | jstor = 25080378  | issn =  | doi =}}&lt;/ref&gt; after he received a recommendation from [[Harold Laski]], who had been impressed by Plucknett's recent publication, ''Concise History of the Common Law''. The book had been dictated and edited in a matter of weeks.&lt;ref name="ONDB"/&gt; When Plucknett arrived at the London School of Economics, he became the first ever holder of the school's chair of legal history. He was to remain in that position until his retirement in 1963.&lt;ref name="ONDB"/&gt; He succeeded [[William Searle Holdsworth|William Holdsworth]] as Literary Director of the [[Selden Society]] and was followed by [[S. F. C. Milsom]].

Though Plucknett remained at the London School of Economics, he also held the presidency of the [[Royal Historical Society]] from 1948 to 1952, and the presidency of the [[Society of Public Teachers of Law]] from 1953 to 1954.&lt;ref name="ONDB"/&gt; In 1950 Plucknett was awarded a fellowship at University College London and in 1950 he was made an honorary fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge.&lt;ref name="ONDB"/&gt; He also received honorary degrees from both [[Glasgow University]], [[Birmingham University]] and Cambridge.&lt;ref name="ONDB"/&gt;

In later life colleagues would describe Plucknett as 'distant'. He maintained the history of law had nothing to do with its practical application and was quoted as saying that "It is still too often said that English law can only be understood historically. Now English law may be bad, but is it really as bad as that?"&lt;ref name="ONDB"/&gt;

Plucknett officially retired from teaching in 1963 due to poor health and died at his home in Crescent Road, [[Wimbledon, London]] SW19 on 14 February 1965.&lt;ref name="ONDB"/&gt;

''Evidence Under the Rules: Text, Cases, and Problems, Sixth Edition.''  Aspen Publishers, New York.  2008, p. 563.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factual background==
The defendant Morlang was on trial for a [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to bribe the director of the [[Federal Housing Administration]] to approve the Hanna Drive development in [[Charleston, West Virginia]].  The prosecutor called Morlang's co-conspirator Wilmoth to the stand to testify that Morlang had admitted the scheme to him.  Before trial, Wilmoth told the prosecutor that he would deny that Morlang made such an admission.  During the trial, Wilmoth did deny hearing an admission from Morlang.  The prosecutor called Crist, Wilmoth's cellmate, to testify that Wilmoth told him about an admission about the scheme from Morlang.  Morland was convicted and appealed to the Fourth Circuit.&lt;ref&gt;''Morlang'', 531 F.2d at 185-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision==
===Majority opinion===
The Fourth Circuit reversed Morlang's conviction in an opinion by Judge Widener.  Even though calling Crist was an ostensibly permissible way to impeach the credibility of Wilmoth, the court understood the tactic as a way to present otherwise inadmissible [[hearsay]] to the jury.  Because the prosecutor knew that Wilmoth planned to only give adverse testimony, the court reasoned that the prosecution's only reason to call him was to impeach him with the statement about Morlang's admission.  The court noted that it is often difficult for juries to distinguish between using a statement only to undermine the credibility of a witness and using the statement to prove what it says.  The court held that impeaching Wilmoth was simply a tactic to get Morlang's admission in front of the jury, and it would be difficult for the jury to ignore its substantive value.&lt;ref&gt;''Morlang'', 531 F.2d at 188-92&lt;/ref&gt;

===Butzner's dissent===
In his dissent, Judge Butzner noted that the prosecutor had other reasons for calling Wilmoth to the stand, like to corroborate other aspects of the crime.  Butzner noted that proponents are no longer thought to vouch for the complete credibility of their witnesses.  Because the prosecutor had some good faith reasons to call Wilmoth to the stand, Butzner would affirm the conviction.&lt;ref&gt;''Morlang'', 531 F.2d at 192-93&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The decision in ''Morlang'' has been adopted as a standard for identifying abuse of [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] Rule 607, which allows the party calling a witness to impeach that witness's credibility.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller &amp; Kirkpatrick, p. 563-64&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Morlang'' standard was followed by the [[D.C. Circuit]] in the case ''United States v. Johnson''&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Johnson'', 802 F.2d 1459 (D.C. Cir. 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[Ninth Circuit]] in the case ''United States v. Gomez-Gallardo''.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Gomez-Gallardo'', 915 F.2d 553, 555 (9th Cir. 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Morlang'' has been limited in some circuits to apply only in cases of bad faith.  In cases where the proponent has a [[good faith]] belief that the witness will at least give some favorable testimony, abuse of FRE 607 has not been found.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Webster'', 734 F.2d 1191 (7th Cir. 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wikisource|Universal Declaration of Human Rights}}

The '''Universal Declaration of Human Rights''' ('''UDHR''') is a historic document that was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] at its third session on&amp;nbsp;10 December 1948 as [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 217|Resolution 217]] at the [[Palais de Chaillot]] in [[Paris]], [[France]]. Of the then 58 members of the United Nations, 48 voted in favor, none against, eight [[abstentions|abstained]], and two did not vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unbisnet.un.org:8080/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=14O243550E15G.60956&amp;profile=voting&amp;uri=full=3100023~!909326~!676&amp;ri=1&amp;aspect=power&amp;menu=search&amp;source=~!horizon|title=A/RES/217(III)|publisher=UNBISNET|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Declaration consists of 30 articles affirming an individual's [[rights]] which, although not legally binding in themselves, have been elaborated in subsequent international treaties, economic transfers, regional [[human rights]] instruments, national constitutions, and other laws. The Declaration was the first step in the process of formulating the [[International Bill of Human Rights]], which was completed in 1966, and came into force in 1976, after a sufficient number of countries had ratified them.

Some legal scholars have argued that because countries have constantly invoked the Declaration for more than 50 years, it has become binding as a part of [[customary international law]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry J Steiner and Philip Alston, International Human Rights in Context: Law, Politics, Morals, (2nd ed), Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hurst Hannum, [https://cdn2.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2014/04/16-Hannum.pdf The UDHR in National and International Law], p.145&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the United States, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain]]'' (2004), concluded that the Declaration "does not of its own force impose obligations as a matter of international law."&lt;ref&gt;''Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain'', 542 U.S. 692, 734 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Courts of other countries have also concluded that the Declaration is not in and of itself part of domestic law.

The underlying structure of the Universal Declaration was introduced in its second draft, which was prepared by [[René Cassin]]. Cassin worked from a first draft, which was prepared by [[John Peters Humphrey]]. The structure was influenced by the ''[[Napoleonic Code|Code Napoléon]]'', including a preamble and introductory general principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glendon|2002|pp=62–64}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cassin compared the Declaration to the [[portico]] of a Greek temple, with a foundation, steps, four columns, and a [[pediment]].

The Declaration consists of a preamble and thirty articles:
* The preamble sets out the historical and social causes that led to the necessity of drafting the Declaration. 
* Articles 1–2 established the basic concepts of dignity, liberty, equality, and brotherhood. 
* Articles 3–11 established other individual rights, such as the [[right to life]] and the prohibition of [[slavery]], as well as a universal freedom of speech.
* Articles 6–11 refer to the fundamental legality of human rights with specific remedies cited for their defence when violated. 
* Articles 12–17 established the rights of the individual towards the community (including such things as [[freedom of movement]]). 
* Articles 18–21 sanctioned the so-called "constitutional liberties", and with spiritual, public, and political freedoms, such as freedom of [[freedom of thought|thought]], opinion, religion and [[conscience]], word, and [[freedom of association|peaceful association]] of the individual.
* Articles 22–27 sanctioned an individual's economic, social and cultural rights, including [[Right to health#Universal Declaration of Human Rights|healthcare]]. Article 25 states: "Everyone has the [[right to an adequate standard of living|right to a standard of living]] adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services." It also makes additional accommodations for security in case of physical debilitation or disability, and makes special mention of care given to those in motherhood or childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|year=1948|publisher=United Nations|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Articles 28–30 established the general ways of using these rights, the areas in which these rights of the individual can not be applied, and that they can not be overcome against the individual.

These articles are concerned with the duty of the individual to society and the prohibition of use of rights in contravention of the purposes of the United Nations Organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glendon|2002}}, Chapter 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] adopted the [[Four Freedoms]]—[[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of religion]], [[freedom from fear]], and [[freedom from want]]—as their basic war aims.&lt;ref name="speech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voicesofdemocracy.umd.edu/fdr-the-four-freedoms-speech-text/ |title=FDR, "The Four Freedoms," Speech Text &amp;#124; |publisher=Voicesofdemocracy.umd.edu |date=January 6, 1941 |accessdate=April 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bodnar, John 2010"&gt;Bodnar, John, The "Good War" in American Memory.

When the atrocities committed by [[Nazi Germany]] became fully apparent after [[World War II]], the consensus within the world community was that the [[United Nations]] Charter did not sufficiently define the rights to which it referred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.udhr.org/history/overview.htm#Cataclysm%20and%20World%20Response Cataclysm and World Response] in [http://www.udhr.org/history/overview.htm Drafting and Adoption : The Universal Declaration of Human Rights], [http://www.udhr.org udhr.org].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.udhr.org/Introduction/question4.htm |title=UDHR50: Didn't Nazi tyranny end all hope for protecting human rights in the modern world? |publisher=Udhr.org |date=1998-08-28 |accessdate=2012-07-07 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120525091118/http://www.udhr.org/history/overview.htm |archive-date=2012-05-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A universal declaration that specified the rights of individuals was necessary to give effect to the Charter's provisions on human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.universalrights.net/main/creation.htm |title=UDHR&amp;nbsp;– History of human rights |publisher=Universalrights.net |accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Creation and drafting === &lt;!--Note: Linked from article's infobox--&gt;
{{Main|Drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights}}

In June 1946, the [[UN Economic and Social Council]] established the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|Commission on Human Rights]], comprising 18 members from various nationalities and political backgrounds. The Commission, a standing body of the [[United Nations]], was constituted to undertake the work of preparing what was initially conceived as an [[International Bill of Rights]].&lt;ref name=morsink1999p4&gt;{{harvnb |Morsink |1999 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=w8OapwltI3YC&amp;pg=PA4 4]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission established a special Universal Declaration of Human Rights Drafting Committee, chaired by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], to write the articles of the Declaration. The Committee met in two sessions over the course of two years.

Canadian [[John Peters Humphrey]], Director of the Division of Human Rights within the United Nations Secretariat, was called upon by the [[United Nations Secretary-General]] to work on the project and became the Declaration's principal drafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Morsink |1999 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=w8OapwltI3YC&amp;pg=PA5 5]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Humphrey was newly appointed as Director of the Division of Human Rights within the [[United Nations Secretariat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Morsink |1999 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=w8OapwltI3YC&amp;pg=PA133 133]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other well-known members of the drafting committee included [[René Cassin]] of France, [[Charles Malik]] of [[Lebanon]], and [[P. C. Chang]] of the [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Republic of China]].&lt;ref name="RoC rep"&gt;The Declaration was drafted during the [[Chinese Civil War]]. P.C. Chang was appointed as a representative by the [[Republic of China]], then the recognised government of China, but which was driven from [[mainland China]] and now administers only [[Taiwan]] and nearby islands ([http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/chinese-nationalists-move-capital-to-taiwan history.com]).&lt;/ref&gt; Humphrey provided the initial draft that became the working text of the Commission.

According to [[Allan C. Carlson|Allan Carlson]], the Declaration's pro-family phrases were the result of the [[Christian Democratic]] movement's influence on Cassin and Malik.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, Allan: [http://www.profam.org/docs/acc/thc.acc.globalizing.040112.htm Globalizing Family Values] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120525091122/http://www.profam.org/docs/acc/thc.acc.globalizing.040112.htm |date=2012-05-25 }}, 12 January 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the Committee finished its work in May 1948, the draft was further discussed by the Commission on Human Rights, the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]], the Third Committee of the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] before being put to vote in December 1948. During these discussions many amendments and propositions were made by UN Member States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://research.un.org/en/undhr|title = Drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights|accessdate = 2015-04-17|website = Research Guides|publisher = United Nations.

[[British government|British]] representatives were extremely frustrated that the proposal had moral but no legal obligation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=''Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Final authorized text''|url=http://www.bl.uk/collection-items/universal-declaration-of-human-rights|date=September 1952|publisher=The British Library|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (It was not until 1976 that the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] came into force, giving a legal status to most of the Declaration.)

=== Adoption ===
The Universal Declaration was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] as [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 217|Resolution 217]] on 10&amp;nbsp;December 1948. Of the then 58 members&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/sections/member-states/growth-united-nations-membership-1945-present/index.html|title=Growth in United Nations membership, 1945-present|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the United Nations, 48 voted in favour, none against, eight [[abstentions|abstained]]&lt;ref name="ccnmtl-10"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/mmt/udhr/udhr_general/drafting_history_10.html |title=default |accessdate=2013-07-12 |author=CCNMTL |website =  Center for New Media Teaching and Learning (CCNMTL)  |publisher = [[Columbia University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unac-qaa"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.unac.org/rights/question.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120912162219/http://www.unac.org/rights/question.html |archivedate=2012-09-12 |title=Questions and answers about the Universal Declaration of Human Rights |author=UNAC |publisher=United Nations Association in Canada (UNAC) |page="Who are the signatories of the Declaration?"}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Honduras]] and [[Yemen]] failed to vote or abstain.&lt;ref name="tagesspiegel-menschenrechte"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/international/menschenrechte-die-maechtigste-idee-der-welt/1392182.html |title=Menschenrechte: Die mächtigste Idee der Welt |accessdate=2013-07-12 |author=Jost Müller-Neuhof |date=2008-12-10 |work=Der Tagesspiegel |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Africa's position can be seen as an attempt to protect [[Apartheid in South Africa|its system of apartheid]], which clearly violated several articles in the Declaration.&lt;ref name="ccnmtl-10" /&gt; The Saudi Arabian delegation's abstention was prompted primarily by two of the Declaration's articles: Article 18, which states that everyone has the right "to change his religion or belief"; and Article 16, on equal marriage rights.&lt;ref name="ccnmtl-10" /&gt; The six communist countries abstentions centred around the view that the Declaration did not go far enough in condemning fascism and Nazism.&lt;ref name="danchin"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/mmt/udhr/udhr_general/drafting_history_10.html|accessdate=2015-02-25 |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: Drafting History - 10.

== International Human Rights Day ==
{{main|Human Rights Day}}
The Declaration of Human Rights Day is commemorated every year on&amp;nbsp;December 10, the anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration, and is known as [[Human Rights Day]] or International Human Rights Day. The commemoration is observed by individuals, community and religious groups, human rights organizations, parliaments, governments, and the United Nations. [[Decade|Decadal]] commemorations are often accompanied by campaigns to promote awareness of the Declaration and human rights. 2008 marked the 60th anniversary of the Declaration, and was accompanied by year-long activities around the theme "Dignity and justice for all of us".&lt;ref name="udhr60"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.un.org/events/humanrights/udhr60/ |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: 1948–2008 |publisher=[[United Nations]] |accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, the [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 217|UN Resolution A/RES/217(III)[A]]] adopted the Declaration on a bilingual document in [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]], and official translations in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A/RES/217(III)|url=http://unbisnet.un.org:8080/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=14O243550E15G.60956&amp;profile=voting&amp;uri=full=3100023~!909326~!676&amp;ri=1&amp;aspect=power&amp;menu=search&amp;source=~!horizon|publisher=UNBISNET|accessdate=13 Jun 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' described the Declaration as the world's "Most Translated Document" (370 different languages and dialects).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-translated-document|title=Most translated document|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/pages/WorldRecord.aspx |title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights |publisher=United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Unicode]] Consortium stores 431&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unicode.org/udhr/translations.html "UDHR in Unicode - Translations"], [[Unicode]], retrieved 8-6-2017&lt;/ref&gt; of the 503&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Pages/SearchByLang.aspx "Search by Translation"], UDHR Translation Project, [[United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]], retrieved 13-8-2017.&lt;/ref&gt; official translations available at the [[OHCHR]] ({{as of|2017|June|lc=y}}).

In its preamble, governments commit themselves and their people to progressive measures that secure the universal and effective recognition and observance of the human rights set out in the Declaration. [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] supported the adoption of the Declaration as a declaration rather than as a treaty because she believed that it would have the same kind of influence on global society as the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] had within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Timmons |first1=Eric J. |title=Mspy and USA declaration |url=https://www.spysoftwarecoupon.com/mspy-promo-code/ |website=4everY |publisher=SpySoft |accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this, she proved to be correct. Even though it is not legally binding, the Declaration has been adopted in or has influenced most national constitutions since 1948. It has also served as the foundation for a growing number of national laws, international laws, and treaties, as well as for a growing number of regional, sub national, and national institutions protecting and promoting human rights.

For the first time in international law, the term “the rule of law” was used in the preamble of the Declaration. The third paragraph of the preamble of the Declaration reads as follows: "Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal effect ===
While not a treaty itself, the Declaration was explicitly adopted for the purpose of defining the meaning of the words "[[fundamental freedoms]]" and "human rights" appearing in the United Nations Charter, which is binding on all member states. For this reason, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a fundamental constitutive document of the United Nations. In addition, many international lawyers&lt;ref name="Ramcharan1979"&gt;{{cite book | last  = John Peters | first = Humphrey | author-link  = John Peters Humphrey | chapter  = The universal declaration of human rights, Its history, impact andjuridical character | pages = 37  | editor-last  = Bertrand G. | editor-first = Ramcharan | editor-link = Bertrand Ramcharan |title=Human Rights: Thirty Years After the Universal Declaration : Commemorative Volume on the Occasion of the Thirtieth Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=favRCKyN-_IC&amp;pg=PA21 |date=23 May 1979  | publisher=Nijhoff |location = The Hage |isbn=90-247-2145-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sohn1977"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The human rights law of the charter |journal=Texas International Law Journal |year=1977 |last=Sohn |first=Louis B. |authorlink=Louis B.

The 1968 United Nations International Conference on Human Rights advised that the Declaration "constitutes an obligation for the members of the international community" to all persons. The Declaration has served as the foundation for two binding UN human rights covenants: the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]]. The principles of the Declaration are elaborated in international treaties such as the [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]], the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women|International Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women]], the [[United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child]], the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]], and many more. The Declaration continues to be widely cited by governments, academics, advocates, and constitutional courts, and by individuals who appeal to its principles for the protection of their recognised human rights.

The Universal Declaration has received praise from a number of notable people. The [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] philosopher and diplomat [[Charles Malik]] called it "an international document of the first order of importance",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/law/AVLpilotproject/udhr_audio.html|title=Statement by Charles Malik as Representative of Lebanon to the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly on the Universal Declaration|date=6 November 1948 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080928133214/http://www.un.org/law/AVLpilotproject/udhr_audio.html |archivedate=28 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]—first chairwoman of the [[Commission on Human Rights]] (CHR) that drafted the Declaration—stated that it "may well become the international [[Magna Carta]] of all men everywhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Michael E.

[[Turkey]]— which was a secular state with an overwhelmingly Muslim population—signed the Declaration in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mfa.gov.tr/universal-declaration-of-human-rights.en.mfa | title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights | accessdate=2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same year, [[Saudi Arabia]] abstained from the ratification vote on the Declaration, claiming that it violated [[Sharia|Sharia law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Nisrine Abiad |title=Sharia, Muslim states and international human rights treaty obligations: a comparative study |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dex7TKuoUhgC |year=2008 |publisher=BIICL |ISBN = 978-1-905221-41-7 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dex7TKuoUhgC&amp;pg=PA60 60–65]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pakistan]]—which had signed the declaration—disagreed and critiqued the Saudi position.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Price |1999 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=YgF58rl4tCkC&amp;pg=PA163 163]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistani minister [[Muhammad Zafarullah Khan]] strongly argued in favor of including freedom of religion.&lt;ref name=Hashemi/&gt; In 1982, the [[Iran]]ian representative to the United Nations, Said Rajaie-Khorassani, said that the Declaration was "a [[Secularism|secular]] understanding of the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition" which could not be implemented by [[Muslim]]s without conflict with Sharia.&lt;ref name="Littman1999"&gt;{{cite news |last=Littman |first=D |title=Universal Human Rights and Human Rights in Islam |work=Midstream |date=February–March 1999 |url = http://mypage.bluewin.ch/ameland/Islam.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060501234759/http://mypage.bluewin.ch/ameland/Islam.html |archivedate=2006-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 June 2000, members of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (now the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]]) officially resolved to support the [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]],&lt;ref name="OIC Resolution on CDHRI"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.oic-oci.org/english/conf/fm/27/27th-fm-political(3).htm#60 |title=Resolution No 60/27-P |date=2000-06-27 |accessdate=2011-06-02 |publisher=Organisation of the Islamic Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt; an alternative document that says people have "freedom and right to a dignified life in accordance with the Islamic Shari'ah", without any discrimination on grounds of "race, colour, language, sex, religious belief, political affiliation, social status or other considerations".

Some Muslim diplomats would go on later to help draft other UN human rights treaties. For example, Iraqi diplomat [[Bedia Afnan]]'s insistence on wording that recognized gender equality resulted in Article 3 within the [[ICCPR]] and [[ICESCR]]. Pakistani diplomat [[Shaista Suhrawardy Ikramullah]] also spoke in favor of recognizing women's rights.&lt;ref name=Hashemi&gt;Hashemi, Nader and Emran Qureshi. "Human Rights." In ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World. Oxford Islamic Studies Online''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of scholars in different fields have expressed concerns with the Declaration's alleged [[Western world|Western]] bias. These include Irene Oh, [[Abdulaziz Sachedina]], [[Riffat Hassan]], and [[Faisal Kutty]]. Hassan has argued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What needs to be pointed out to those who uphold the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to be the highest, or sole, model, of a charter of equality and liberty for all human beings, is that given the Western origin and orientation of this Declaration, the "universality" of the assumptions on which it is based is{{spaced ndash}}at the very least{{spaced ndash}}problematic and subject to questioning. Furthermore, the alleged incompatibility between the concept of human rights and religion in general, or particular religions such as Islam, needs to be examined in an unbiased way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.religiousconsultation.org/hassan2.htm |title=Are Human Rights Compatible with Islam? |publisher=religiousconsultation.org |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Irene Oh argues that one solution is to approach the issue from the perspective of [[Descriptive ethics|comparative (descriptive) ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://press.georgetown.edu/book/georgetown/rights-god |title=The Rights of God |publisher=Georgetown University Press, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kutty writes: "A strong argument can be made that the current formulation of international human rights constitutes a cultural structure in which western society finds itself easily at home ... It is important to acknowledge and appreciate that other societies may have equally valid alternative conceptions of human rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/6294545?versionId=7270568 |title=Non-Western Societies Have Influenced Human Rights |publisher=in Jacqueline Langwith (ed.), ''Opposing Viewpoints: Human Rights'', Gale/Greenhaven Press: Chicago, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironically, a number of Islamic countries that {{as of|2014|lc=on}} are among the most resistant to UN intervention in domestic affairs, played an invaluable role in the creation of the Declaration, with countries such as Syria and Egypt having been strong proponents of the universality of human rights and the right of countries to self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;Professor Susan Waltz: Universal Rights Group, ''[http://www.universal-rights.org/blogs/94-syria-calls-for-greater-un-intervention-in-domestic-human-rights-situations Syria calls for greater UN intervention in domestic human rights situations...]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "The Right to Refuse to Kill" ====
Groups such as [[Amnesty International]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/EUR01/004/1997/en Out of the margins: the right to conscientious objection to military service in Europe: An announcement of Amnesty International's forthcoming campaign and briefing for the UN Commission on Human Rights], 31 March 1997. Amnesty International.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[War Resisters International]]&lt;ref name="War Resisters International"&gt;[http://www.wri-irg.org/books/co-guide-un.htm A Conscientious Objector's Guide to the UN Human Rights System], Parts 1, 2 &amp; 3, Background Information on International Law for COs, Standards which recognise the right to conscientious objection, War Resisters' International.&lt;/ref&gt; have advocated for "The Right to Refuse to Kill" to be added to the Universal Declaration. War Resisters International has stated that the right to [[Conscientious objector|conscientious objection]] to military service is primarily derived from—but not yet explicit in—Article 18 of the UDHR: the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion.&lt;ref name="War Resisters International" /&gt;

[[Conscientious objector#Universal Declaration of Human Rights|Steps have been taken within the United Nations to make this right more explicit]], but{{as of|2017|alt=—to date (2017)—}}those steps have been limited to less significant United Nations documents. [[Sean MacBride]]—Assistant [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate—has said: "To the rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights one more might, with relevance, be added. It is 'The Right to Refuse to Kill'."&lt;ref&gt;Sean MacBride, [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1974/macbride-lecture.html The Imperatives of Survival], Nobel Lecture, 12 December 1974, [https://www.nobelprize.org/index.html The Nobel Foundation]&amp;nbsp;– Official website of the [[Nobel Foundation]]. (English index page; hyperlink to Swedish site.) From [https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_organizations/nobelfoundation/publications/lectures/peace.html Nobel Lectures in Peace] 1971–1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== American Anthropological Association ====
The [[American Anthropological Association]] criticized the UDHR while it was in its drafting process. The AAA warned that the document would be defining universal rights from a [[Western Culture|Western]] paradigm which would be unfair to countries outside of that scope. They further argued that the West's history of [[colonialism]] and [[evangelism]] made them a problematic moral representative for the rest of the world. They proposed three notes for consideration with underlying themes of [[cultural relativism]]: "1. The individual realizes his personality through his culture, hence respect for individual differences entails a respect for cultural differences", "2. Respect for differences between cultures is validated by the scientific fact that no technique of qualitatively evaluating cultures has been discovered", and "3. Standards and values are relative to the culture from which they derive so that any attempt to formulate postulates that grow out of the beliefs or moral codes of one culture must to that extent detract from the applicability of any Declaration of Human Rights to mankind as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://franke.uchicago.edu/aaa1947.pdf | title=Statement on Human Rights | accessdate=2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bangkok Declaration ====
During the lead up to the [[World Conference on Human Rights]] held in 1993, ministers from Asian states adopted the Bangkok Declaration, reaffirming their governments' commitment to the principles of the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They stated their view of the interdependence and indivisibility of human rights and stressed the need for universality, [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]], and non-selectivity of human rights. However, at the same time, they emphasized the principles of [[sovereignty]] and non-interference, calling for greater emphasis on economic, social, and cultural rights—in particular, the right to economic development over civil and political rights. The Bangkok Declaration is considered to be a landmark expression of the [[Asian values]] perspective, which offers an extended critique of human rights [[Moral universalism|universalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://law.hku.hk/lawgovtsociety/Bangkok%20Declaration.htm |title=Final Declaration Of The Regional Meeting For Asia Of The World Conference On Human Rights |publisher=Law.hku.hk |accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizations promoting the UDHR ==
{{Overly detailed|section|date=November 2017}}

=== International Federation for Human Rights ===
The [[International Federation for Human Rights]] (FIDH) is [[nonpartisan]], [[nonsectarian]], and independent of any government, and its core mandate is to promote respect for all the rights set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sustainable-business/files/csr/documents/stakeholder_forum/fidh_en.pdf Contribution to the EU Multi-stakeholder Forum on CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024132638/http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sustainable-business/files/csr/documents/stakeholder_forum/fidh_en.pdf |date=2012-10-24 }}, 10 February 2009; accessed on 9 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/partners.html Information Partners], web site of the [[UNHCR]], last updated 25 February 2010, 16:08 GMT (web retrieval 25 February 2010, 18:11 GMT)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Amnesty International ===
In 1988, director [[Stephen R. Johnson]] and 41 international [[animator]]s, musicians, and producers created a 20-minute video for [[Amnesty International]] to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration. The video was to bring to life the Declaration's 30 articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UDHR film |work=Amnesty International |accessdate=2013-07-19 |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights-anniversary/udhr-film |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614070441/http://www.amnesty.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights-anniversary/udhr-film |archive-date=2013-06-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amnesty International celebrated Human Rights Day and the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration'' all over the world by organizing the "Fire Up!" event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fire Up! |work=Amnesty International |accessdate=2013-07-19 |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights-anniversary/fire-up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unitarian Universalist Service Committee ===
The [[Unitarian Universalist Service Committee]] (UUSC) is a non-profit, nonsectarian organization whose work around the world is guided by the values of Unitarian Universalism and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It works to provide disaster relief and promote human rights and social justice around the world.

=== Quaker United Nations Office and American Friends Service Committee ===
The [[Quaker United Nations Office]] and the [[American Friends Service Committee]] work on many human rights issues, including improving education on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They have developed a curriculum to help introduce High School students to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = UNHCR Partners |url = http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?page=partners |publisher=UNHCR |accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = AFSC Universal Declaration of Human Rights web page |url = https://afsc.org/category/topic/universal-declaration-human-rights|publisher=American Friends Service Committee |accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American Library Association ===
In 1997, the council of the [[American Library Association]] (ALA) endorsed Article 19 from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ala.org/offices/iro/awardsactivities/resolutionifla|title=Resolution on IFLA, Human Rights and Freedom of Expression |website = ala.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Article 19, Article 18 and 20 are also fundamentally tied to the ALA Universal Right to Free Expression and the [[Library Bill of Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/librarybill/interpretations/universalright |title = The Universal Right to Free Expression:|work=ala.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Censorship]], the [[invasion of privacy]], and interference of opinions are human rights violations according to the ALA. 

In response to violations of human rights, the ALA asserts the following principles:

{{cquote| The American Library Association opposes any use of governmental prerogative that leads to intimidation of individuals that prevents them from exercising their rights to hold opinions without interference, and to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas. We urge libraries and librarians everywhere to resist such abuse of governmental power, and to support those against whom such governmental power has been employed.

The American Library Association condemns any governmental effort to involve libraries and librarians in restrictions on the right of any individual to hold opinions without interference, and to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas. Such restrictions, whether enforced by statutes or regulations, contractual stipulations, or voluntary agreements, pervert the function of the library and violate the professional responsibilities of librarians.

The American Library Association rejects censorship in any form. Any action that denies the inalienable human rights of individuals only damages the will to resist oppression, strengthens the hand of the oppressor, and undermines the cause of justice.

The American Library Association will not abrogate these principles. We believe that censorship corrupts the cause of justice, and contributes to the demise of freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Universal Right to Free Expression|url=http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/librarybill/interpretations/universalright|website=American Library Association|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Youth for Human Rights International ===
[[Youth for Human Rights International]] (YHRI) is a non-profit organization founded in 2001 by Mary Shuttleworth, an educator born and raised in apartheid South Africa, where she witnessed firsthand the devastating effects of discrimination and the lack of basic human rights. The purpose of YHRI is to teach youth about human rights, specifically the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and inspire them to become advocates for tolerance and peace. YHRI has now grown into a global movement, including hundreds of groups, clubs and chapters around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Youth for Human Rights|url=http://www.youthforhumanrights.org|publisher=Youth for Human Rights|accessdate=13 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1345">'''Unlicensed Personal Communications Services''' or '''UPCS band''' is the 1920–1930 [[MHz]] [[frequency band]] allocated by the United States [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) for short range [[Personal Communications Services]] (PCS) applications in the [[United States]], such as the [[Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications]] (DECT) wireless protocol. 

== History ==
Prior to an FCC rules change in April 2005, the band also included the frequencies 1910-1920 MHz and 2390–2400 MHz.  These were used for a variety of short range communications, including point-to-point [[microwave]] links.  

== Allocation ==
These allocation rules are described in Title 47, [http://www.fcc.gov/oet/info/rules/part15/part15-5-4-07.pdf Part 15] of the [[Code of Federal Regulations]].

''Licensed'' PCS, although not necessarily distinguished as such from UPCS, is used for digital [[mobile phone]] services.

Note that DECT devices designed to operate in this band (in the US) use the designator [[DECT 6.0]].
