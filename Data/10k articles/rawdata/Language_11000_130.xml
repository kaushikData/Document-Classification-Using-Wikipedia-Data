      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3010">The '''Chalcis Decree''' was an oath of loyalty that the people of the city of [[Chalcis]] on the island of [[Euboea]] were forced to swear after the failure of a revolt from the [[Athenian Empire]] in 446/5 BC. The decree is difficult to date but it followed the revolt of the cities of Euboea in 446. The islanders were angered by the increasingly harsh imperialism of Athens and attempted to take advantage of the defeat of Athens in the [[Battle of Coronea (447 BC)|Battle of Coronea]] in neighbouring [[Boeotia]] (c. 447 BC) which resulted in the loss of the Athenian “land empire”. The revolt was crushed by the Athenians led by [[Pericles]]. Other cities on Euboea, such as [[Eretria]], had decrees with exactly the same provisions passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Terry Buckley|title=Aspects of Greek History|year=1996|page=180|publisher=Routledge|ISBN=0-415-54976-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The decree is considered a point at which there was no longer any doubt of the imperial power held by Athens over its allies in the [[Delian League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pamela Bradley|title=Ancient Greece - Using Evidence|year=2001|page=177|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|ISBN=0 521 79646 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''I will not revolt from the people of Athens by any means or device whatsoever, neither in word or in deed, nor will I obey anyone who does revolt, and if anyone revolts I will denounce him to the Athenians.'' and ''I will be the best and fairest ally I am able to be and will help and defend the Athenian people, in the event of anyone wronging the Athenians people, and I will obey the Athenian people.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Terry Buckley|title=Aspects of Greek History|year=1996|page=191|publisher=Routledge|ISBN=0-415-54976-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Athens also expected to be involved in the judicial proceedings of the city of Chalcis resulting in the actions of local courts being severely restricted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pamela Bradley|title=Ancient Greece - Using Evidence|year=2001|page=183|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|ISBN=0 521 79646 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decree allowed the people of Chalcis to punish their own citizens, except in cases that involved death, exile, or the loss of rights as citizens. The right of appeal to the [[Heliaia]] in Athens was allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pamela Bradley|title=Ancient Greece - Using Evidence|year=2001|page=282|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|ISBN=0 521 79646 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Terry Buckley|title=Aspects of Greek History|year=1996|page=191|publisher=Routledge|ISBN=0-415-54976-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was largely aimed at the oligarchic wealthy who hoped to gain the assistance of [[Sparta]] or [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]] in their revolts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Terry Buckley|title=Aspects of Greek History|year=1996|page=292|publisher=Routledge|ISBN=0-415-54976-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daka''' (Dakka, Dekka, rarely Deng or Tikk) is one of two languages spoken by the [[Chamba people]] in [[Nigeria]], the other being [[Chamba Leko]].

==Varieties==
Daka is a [[dialect cluster]]. The Chamba dialect is called '''Chamba Daka''' (or ''Samba, Tsamba, Tchamba, Sama, Jama Daka''; also Nakanyare) and constitutes 90% of speakers. Other dialects are ''Dirim'' (Dirin, Dirrim), ''Lamja, Dengsa,'' and ''Tola''. Dirim and Lamja–Dengsa–Tola have separate [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] coding, but ''Ethnologue'' notes that they are 'close to Samba Daka and may be a dialect' or 'may not be sufficiently distinct from Samba Daka to be a separate language', and actually lists Dirim as a dialect under Daka. Blench (2011) lists Dirim as coordinate with other Daka varieties: Nnakenyare, Mapeo, Jangani, Lamja, Dirim, suggesting that if Lamja and Dirim are considered separate languages, as in ''Ethnologue'', then Samba Daka itself needs to be broken up into three additional languages.

==Classification==
[[Joseph Greenberg|Greenberg]] placed Samba Daka within his [[Adamawa languages|Adamawa]] proposal, as group G3, but Bennett (1983) demonstrated to general satisfaction that it is a [[Benue–Congo language]], though its placement within Benue–Congo is disputed. Blench (2011) considers it to be Bantoid. Boyd (ms), however, considers Daka an isolate branch within Niger–Congo (Blench 2008). Blench (2011) lists [[Taram language|Taram]] as a separate, though closely related, language.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9244">In [[linguistics]], '''determiner spreading''' ('''DS'''), also known as Multiple or Double Determiners &lt;ref&gt; Santelmann, L. 1993:1 &lt;/ref&gt; is the appearance of more than one [[Determiner (linguistics)|determiner]] associated with a [[noun phrase]], usually marking an [[adjective]] as well as the [[noun]] itself &lt;ref&gt; Martinis, T. 2003:165-190 &lt;/ref&gt;.
The extra determiner has been called an adjectival determiner &lt;ref&gt;Rivero, M. L., Rallē, A., &amp; MyiLibrary. 2001:165-166, 191-192 &lt;/ref&gt; because determiner spreading is most commonly found in adjectival phrases. Typical examples involve multiple occurrences of the definite article or definiteness marking, such is found in (but not limited to) the languages listed below. The structure of such phrases is widely discussed and there is not one conclusive analysis. Because of this, the example languages below each show unique structure where different proposed analyses have been used.

Researchers have found when a language shows ellipsis within a [[Determiner phrase]], and in particular those with adjective phrases, determiner spreading does not occur. Due to this, we do not find determiner spreading in languages such as [[Romance Languages]] as well as [[English Language|English]] &lt;ref&gt; Phoevos Panagiotidis, E. &amp; Marinis, T. 2011:285 &lt;/ref&gt;.

==Languages with determiner spreading==

===Determiner spreading in Albanian===

Determiner spreading is found in [[Albanian language|Albanian]] where two definite articles are used for just one referent ''boy'' &lt;ref&gt; Alexiadou, A., et al. 2007:73 &lt;/ref&gt;. As shown in (1) and (2), the ordering of the noun and the adjective does not matter, as long as the determiner falls before the adjective.
{| class="wikitable" border="1"

In Albanian, either of these sentence constructions in (1) and (2) are grammatical to mean ''the good boy''. In both of the sentences the determiner ''i'' marks the referent ''boy''. It is noted that the determiner ''i'' is a morphological entity to mark the adjectival class rather than definiteness of the noun, as is found in Greek below &lt;ref&gt; Alexiadou, A., et al. 2007:73 &lt;/ref&gt;.

===Modern Greek===

In [[Modern Greek]], determiner spreading is not obligatory, and it contrasts with a non-spreading example in (3)&lt;ref&gt; Alexiadou, A., et al. 2007:368 &lt;/ref&gt;:

(3) 
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
| i
| orea
| xoreftria
|-
| the
| beautiful
| dancer
|}
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
| i.  'the dancer is beautiful'
|-
| ii. 'the dancer who dances beautifully' &lt;ref&gt; Alexiadou, A., et al. 2007:368 &lt;/ref&gt;
|}

The sentence above has an ambiguous meaning explained by the last two lines in the sentence above in (3). Both the meanings (i) and (ii) are grammatical with non-determiner spreading. However when DS is introduced, the sentence no longer takes on an ambiguous meaning.
Determiner spreading in the example in (4) has eliminated the ambiguity, rendering the second meaning in (ii) to be ungrammatical.

(4) 
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
| i

| i

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
| i.  the dancer who is beautiful
|-
| ii. *the dancer who dances beautifully &lt;ref&gt; Alexiadou, A., et al. 2007:368 &lt;/ref&gt;
|}

The question that is being posed in (5) requires an answer to differentiate which kind of pen, silver or gold. The response in (6) shows determiner spreading occurring because the adjective is a "restrictive modifier" &lt;ref&gt;  Alexiadou, A., et al. 2007:366 &lt;/ref&gt;.

{| class="wikitable" border="1"

|}
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
| 'But which pen; the gold or the silver?'
|}

|}

Researchers believe that determiner spreading only occurs when the phrase has an "intersective reading"  &lt;ref&gt; Alexiadou, A., et al. 2007:368 &lt;/ref&gt;. Meaning that the focus of the sentence is the kind of pen rather than the pen itself. The determiner spreading is syntactically how a speaker can give stress to a phrase in Modern Greek. It has been suggested that the same result of focus on the type of pen can be acquired [[Semantics|semantically]] by giving focus to the adjective, as marked by capital letters in (7).

|}

A commonality between the Greek examples we have seen thus far is that determiner spreading is obligatorily definite [[Article (grammar)]] in Greek. Another language specific observation is that the determiner precedes the adjective. Researchers suggest that in order for an adjective to appear post-nominally, the determiner must precede the adjective to be grammatical in Greek. The examples below in (8) and (9) reinforce this observation showing (8) to be ungrammatical where ''meghalo'' follows ''spiti'' with no determiner intervening.

[[File:To spiti to meghalo.png|thumb|"the big house" adapted from Phoevos Panagiotidis, E., &amp; Marinis, T. 2011:290 drawn using [http://mshang.ca/syntree// mshang] syntax tree generator.]]

(9)

|}

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
| 'The big stone house'
|}

An alternative structure to the tree above (see "the silver pen" tree), is shown to the right in "the big house". Researchers have described this structure as a [[Predicative expression|predicative]] configuration in which the DP in SpecDP ''to spiti'' is acting as the subject of the higher DP &lt;ref&gt; Phoevos Panagiotidis, E., &amp; Marinis, T. 2011:283 &lt;/ref&gt;.

===Swedish===
[[File:Den_stora_bil-en.png|thumb|299x299px|"the big car" adapted from Santelmann, L. 1993:174 drawn using [http://mshang.ca/syntree// mshang] syntax tree generator. ]]

In contrast with the optional DS in Greek, [[Swedish language|Swedish]] phrases that have an adjective show obligatory determiner spreading &lt;ref&gt; Santelmann, L. 1993:174 &lt;/ref&gt;. Example (10) is marked as ungrammatical because it is monadic with respect to DS - there is only one determiner. By suffixing the noun with the determiner ''-en'' in example (11), the phrase becomes grammatical.

(10)
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
| *den 
| stora
| bil
|-
| the
| big
| car &lt;ref&gt; Santelmann, L. 1993:174 &lt;/ref&gt;
|}
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
| 'The big car'
|}

(11)
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
| den 
| stora
| bil-en
|-
| the
| big
| car-the &lt;ref&gt; Santelmann, L. 1993:174 &lt;/ref&gt;
|}
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
| 'The big car'
|}

One proposed analysis of the structure of DS in Swedish suggests that ''den''-support, is used to support definite DPs when D cannot be satisfied in any other way. It is used as a type of feature support for definiteness; when the definite noun carries stress, ''den'' is inserted for support to the DP. The determiner ''den'' and the determiner suffix ''-en'' are in complementary distribution. This proposed structure is shown in the syntactic tree to the right; where the ''den'' has already been inserted and the ''-en'' is experiencing downward movement to suffix the noun ''bil'' &lt;ref&gt; Santelmann, L. 1993:174 &lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Dissertation Abstracts''', '''Dissertation Abstracts International''' ('''DAI''') or the '''[[ProQuest Dissertations and Theses]]''' ('''PQDT''') database is a [[bibliography]] of American (and international) [[dissertation]]s published since 1938 by [[University Microfilms International]] (UMI) / [[ProQuest]], Ann Arbor. UMI has had an agitated life and the bibliographical data have often shifted owner and name, and therefore appears under different labels. It covers doctoral dissertations accepted at accredited American institutions since 1861. Selected Masters theses have been included since 1962; since 1988, the database includes citations for dissertations from 50 British universities that are available at The British Document Supply Centre.&lt;ref&gt;Dialog Bluesheet #35: http://library.dialog.com/bluesheets/html/bl0035.html&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it covers a limited number of dissertations from the rest of the world.

The print version is published monthly and cumulated annually and it is available both in softcover and on microfiche. It is divided in three sections:
*Section A, Humanities and Social Sciences ({{ISSN|0419-4209}})
*Section B, Sciences and Engineering ({{ISSN|0419-4217}})
*Section C (DAI-C),(formerly ''European Dissertations'') ({{ISSN|1042-7279}}) covers non-North American materials, most of them unavailable for purchase from ProQuest. As of 2008, ProQuest no longer offers DAI-C as a separate product.

==Form or content==
The usability of dissertation abstracts depends largely on their content.  Many journals within the medical community have settled on a seven sentence structure, which is also gaining acceptance in the social sciences, education and business.  In it, the purpose of the study and methodological choices are outlined succinctly, allowing the reader or researcher to quickly scan and evaluate a number of studies to easily choose ones that meet their particular demands.  The structure contains variations on the following seven sentence stems: "The purpose of this study is...." "The scope of this study...." "The methodology...." "The Findings..." "Conclusions reached are ..." "Limitations of this study include...."  "This study contributes...."  Abstracts of dissertation proposals contain the same seven concepts, substituting data collection and analysis in place of findings and conclusions.  Abstracts are limited in the United States by the UMI to 350 words.

==Historical notes==
In 1962, the [[Xerox Corporation]] bought UMI. Xerox introduced some changes and in 1971 UMI changed its name to Xerox University Microfilms, but in 1976 reverted to University Microfilms International. In 1985, UMI was sold to [[Bell &amp; Howell]], who changed the name to Bell &amp; Howell Information and Learning in 1999. In 2001 Bell and Howell created the [[ProQuest]] Company. December 2006, the [[Cambridge Information Group]] (CIG) bought the unit of ProQuest called ProQuest Information and Learning (which included UMI).&lt;ref&gt;Center for Research Libraries (2011). ''Profile: UMI Dissertation Publishing, ProQuest, LLC''. http://www.crl.edu/profile/umi-dissertation-publishing-proquest-llc#Summary&lt;/ref&gt;

Former titles and print titles: From 1969: ''Dissertations Abstract International''; from 1951: ''Dissertations Abstracts'';  from  ''Microfilm Abstracts'' (an annual catalog of the dissertations available for sale from UMI), ''American Doctoral Dissertations'' (ADD), (until 1964): ''Index to American Doctoral Dissertations'', (until 1956): ''Doctoral Dissertations Accepted by American Universities''. ''Masters Abstracts International'' (MAI).

There are different versions in print and online. The online version is '''Dissertation Abstracts Online''' while the print bibliography is termed '''Dissertation Abstracts International'''. Material except the abstracts themselves were issued also on CD-ROM under the title: '''Dissertation abstracts ondisc'''.

'''Durga Narayan Bhagwat''' (10 February 1910 - 7 May 2002), popularly known as '''Durga Bhagwat''', was an [[India]]n scholar, socialist and writer. She studied Sanskrit and Buddhist literature and spent time in the jungles of [[Madhya Pradesh]] to study tribal life. She later returned to [[Mumbai]] as a researcher and wrote books in [[Marathi language|Marathi]]. She highly opposed Government during [[The Emergency (India)]] and was subsequently imprisoned. She also refused to accept literary honours like [[Padma Shree]] and [[Jnanapeeth]].

==Early years==
Durga Bhagwat was born in 1910 in a [[Karhade Brahmin]] family settled in the then princely state of Baroda. The veteran Sanskrit scholar and social activist Rajaram Shastri Bhagwat was the brother of her grandmother. Her sister [[Kamala Sohonie]] went on to become the first woman scientist of India.{{cn|date=June 2017}} Her father was a scientist who discovered the procedure of making [[ghee]] from oil.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

Durgabai was attracted to Gandhism and took part in Indian freedom movement for a very short time. When she realised that she cannot do it for a longer time she left that and completed her studies from [[St. Xavier's College, Mumbai|St. Xavier's College]]. But she continued to wear Khadi in that period. Her paternal aunt, Seetabai Bhagwat, had a great influence on Durgabai. Durgabai went to Madhya Pradesh for studying tribal culture where she had an [[idiosyncratic reaction]] to yam (Elephant foot) for which she was bed-ridden for six years. She could not complete her doctorate course.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

==Later years==
Durga Bhagwat was elected President of the 51st [[Marathi Sahitya Sammelan]], held in [[Karad]], in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://72.78.249.126/esakal/20130815/4761246431974434785.htm|title=President of Marathi Sahitya Sammelan, Durga Bhagwat|accessdate=2014-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the second woman President of the Sammelan, after [[Kusumavati Deshpande]] since its inception in 1878. Durgabai publicly opposed the state of [[Emergency in India|Emergency]] imposed by [[Indira Gandhi]] and the arrest of [[Jaiprakash Narayan]] and was jailed by the government. After the emergency was lifted, she campaigned against the ruling [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]] in the [[Indian general election, 1977|1977 general election]], and remained opposed to it for the rest of her life. After the Emergency, she was offered an influential government seat by the then ruling [[Janata Party]] which she declined. She decided not to accept any state-sponsored honours and declined the [[Jnanpith Award|Dnyan Peeth Award]].

Before chairing the [[Marathi Sahitya Sammelan]], she was elected chairperson of the [[Tamasgir]] Meet and considered it a great honour.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

Durga Bhagwat never married. Her idols throughout her life had been [[Vyasa]], [[Gautama Buddha]], [[Adi Sankara|Adi Shankaracharya]], American philosopher [[Henry David Thoreau]], and Indian writer [[Shridhar Venkatesh Ketkar]].

==Her contribution==
Durga Bhagwat's notable works include a biography of Rajaram Shastri Bhagwat, ''Pais'', a collection of articles based around religions, their literature and practises and ''Vyas Parva'', a book about her study of [[Mahabharat]]. She studied religious literature, particularly Buddhist, works of Marathi saints from [[Dnyaneshwar]] to [[Tukaram]], major Sanskrit works of Vyas and Adi Shankaracharya. Her book ''RRitu-chakra'', detailing the nature (particularly trees and flowers) in each Indian month, is perhaps her most famous work. During her prolonged recuperation after being food poisoned in Madhya Pradesh, she observed the changes in the nature over the 12-month cycle and spurred her to write articles on each season.

Bhagwat wrote many articles on cooking and crafts and was known as the 'Marathi Saraswatachi Sarswati'.

== Freud ==
In ''[[Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality]]'' (1905), Freud distinguished the fixations of the libido on an incestuous object from a fixation upon a specific, partial ''aim'', such as [[voyeurism]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (Penguin Freud Library 7) pp.&amp;nbsp;68–70 and p.&amp;nbsp;151&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud theorized that some humans may develop psychological fixation due to one or more of the following:
#A lack of proper gratification during one of the [[Psychosexual development|psychosexual stages of development]].
#Receiving a strong impression from one of these stages, in which case the person's personality would reflect that stage throughout adult life.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Sexuality'' p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;
#"An excessively strong manifestation of these instincts at a very early age [which] leads to a kind of partial ''fixation'', which then constitutes a weak point in the structure of the sexual function".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Five Lectures on Psycho-Analysis'' (Penguin 1995) p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

As Freud's thought developed, so did the range of possible 'fixation points' he saw as significant in producing particular neuroses.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Richards, "Editor's Note", Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (Penguin Freud Library 10) p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; However, he continued to view fixation as "the manifestation of very early linkages – linkages which it is hard to resolve – between instincts and impressions and the objects involved in those impressions".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Psychopathology'' pp. 137–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychoanalytic [[therapy]] involved producing a new [[transference]] fixation in place of the old one.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Fink, ''A Clinical Introduction to Lacanian Psychoanalysis'' (Harvard 1999) p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; The new fixation – for example a father-transference onto the analyst – may be very different from the old, but will absorb its energies and enable them eventually to be released for non-fixated purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (Penguin Freud Library 1) p. 509&lt;/ref&gt;

===Objections===
*Whether a particularly obsessive attachment is a fixation or a defensible expression of [[love]] is at times debatable. Fixation to intangibles (i.e., ideas, ideologies, etc.) can also occur. The obsessive factor of fixation is also found in symptoms pertaining to [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], which psychoanalysts linked to a mix of early (pregenital) frustrations and gratifications.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;
*Fixation has been compared to [[Imprinting (psychology)|psychological imprinting]]&lt;ref&gt;Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988) p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; at an early and sensitive period of development.&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Gregory ed, ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind'' (Oxford 1987) p. 356&lt;/ref&gt; others object that Freud was attempting to stress the looseness of the ties between libido and object, and the need to find a specific cause any given (perverse or neurotic) fixation.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen A. Mitchell, ''Relational Concepts in Psychoanalysis'' (1988) p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-Freudians ==
[[Melanie Klein]] saw fixation as inherently pathological&lt;ref&gt;C. Geissmann-Chambon/P. Geissmann, ''A History of Child Psychoanalysis'' (Routledge 1998) p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; – a blocking of potential [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]] by way of [[Psychological repression|repression]].&lt;ref&gt;Lyndsey Stonebridge/John Phillips, ''Reading Melanie Klein'' (1998) p. 243n&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erik H. Erikson]] distinguished fixation to zone – oral or anal, for example – from fixation to mode, such as taking in, as with his instance of the man who "may eagerly absorb the 'milk of wisdom' where he once desired more tangible fluids from more sensuous containers".&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, ''[[Childhood and Society]]'' (Penguin 1973) p. 72 and p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eric Berne]], developed his insight further as part of [[transactional analysis]], suggesting that "particular games and scripts, and their accompanying physical symptoms, are based in appropriate zones and modes".&lt;ref&gt;Erik Berne, ''What Do You Say After You Say Hello?'' (Corgi 1975) p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heinz Kohut]] saw the [[Grandiosity|grandiose self]] as a fixation upon a normal childhood stage;&lt;ref&gt;Akhtar, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; while other [[post-Freudian]]s explored the role of fixation in aggression and criminality.&lt;ref&gt;Jo Brunas-Wagstaff, ''Personality: A Cognitive Approach'' (1998) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*Coleridge's ''[[Christabel (poem)|Christabel]]'' has been seen as using witchcraft as a vehicle to explore psychological fixation.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bloom, ''Samuel Taylor Coleridge'' (2010) p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Tennyson]] has been considered to show a [[Romanticism|romantic]] fixation on days of old.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Ledbetter, ''Tennyson and Victorian Periodicals'' (2007) p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[historical linguistics]], the [[German language|German]] term '''''{{lang|de|grammatischer Wechsel}}''''' ("grammatical alternation") refers to the effects of [[Verner's law]] when they are viewed [[synchrony (linguistics)|synchronic]]ally within the paradigm of a [[Germanic verb]].

==Overview==
According to [[Grimm's law]], the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) [[voiceless]] [[stop consonant|stops]] *p, *t, *k and *kʷ usually became Proto-Germanic *f, *θ ([[dental fricative]]), *x and *xʷ ([[Voiceless velar fricative|velar fricative]]). [[Karl Verner]] identified the principle that these instead become the [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] consonants *b, *d, *g, *gʷ if they were word-internal and immediately preceded by an unaccented vowel in PIE. Furthermore, PIE *s, which usually came into Germanic unchanged, became *z in this position; Proto-Germanic *z later became North- and West Germanic *r.

Consequently, five pairs of consonants emerged, each pair representing a single PIE phoneme. The following table shows the precise developments from [[Proto-Indo-European]] through [[Proto-Germanic]] and [[West Germanic]] to [[Old English]], [[Old High German]] and [[Middle Dutch]]. It is mainly in the dentals that these languages show significant differences in the patterns of ''{{lang|de|grammatischer Wechsel}}''. Note that this table lists only the outcome of word-internal consonants, since word-initial consonants were generally not affected by Verner's law.

In Old English, the fricatives took the voiced allophones {{IPA|[ð]}}, {{IPA|[v]}} and {{IPA|[z]}} when they were word-internal, and in Middle Dutch also when word-initial; see: [[Pronunciation of English ⟨th⟩]]. In Old High German, the stops were moved according to the [[High German consonant shift]]. In Dutch, the idiosyncrasies of this shift mean that Dutch (like German) experiences the shift þ→d but (like English) does not experience the shift d→t; thus the dental variety of ''{{lang|de|grammatischer Wechsel}}'' is eliminated in Dutch by the normal operation of sound laws. Likewise, {{IPA|[f]}} and {{IPA|[v]}} merged in almost all Germanic languages (except Gothic and German), eliminating this variety early on. In Old Norse, {{IPA|[θ]}} and {{IPA|[ð]}} likewise merged altogether.

==Within verb paradigms==
''{{lang|de|Grammatischer Wechsel}}'' is the phenomenon that a verb which in PIE had a stem ending in one of these phonemes displays a differing reflex in different parts of the paradigm, a result of the movable nature of accent in PIE. The Germanic past tense derives from the PIE perfect aspect, which was always [[athematic]] and therefore almost always had a shift of accent between the singular indicative (where it was on the root syllable) and the remaining forms including the past participle (where it was on the ending). However, the perfect aspect was only present in primary, underived verbs, and any derived verbs therefore lacked perfect forms altogether. These latter verbs formed the base of the [[Germanic weak verb]]s, and did not inherit the accent shift, so the alternation itself only affects [[Germanic strong verb]]s.

A process of [[paradigm levelling|levelling]] has meant that there are only few examples of this in the modern languages. In East and North Germanic, this levelling was almost complete before the earliest records, though [[Gothic language|Gothic]] and [[Old Norse]] did have traces of ''{{lang|de|grammatischer Wechsel}}''. In Old English, too, the levelling had already begun to the extent that in some verbs the [[preterite]] singular had taken the consonant of the preterite plural. The only surviving example in Modern English is ''was:were'', but a trace can also be seen in the adjective ''forlorn'', which reflects the old participle of the verb ''to lose'', or ''sodden'', which is originally a participle of ''seethe''. This latter is parallelled by German ''sieden, sott, gesotten''. German also features d:t in ''leiden, litt, gelitten'' ("to suffer") and ''schneiden, schnitt, geschnitten'' ("to cut"). One example of h:g is ''ziehen, zog, gezogen'' ("to pull"). All other cases have been levelled. Apart from the English copula mentioned above, the only occurrences of s:r in the modern languages are in Dutch: for example ''verliezen, verloor, verloren'' ("to lose") and ''verkiezen, verkoos, verkoren'' ("to choose").&lt;ref&gt;Franck. ''Etymologisch woordenboek der Nederlandsche taal''.[http://www.etymologiebank.nl/trefwoord/uitverkoren] Dutch also has the participle ''verkozen'', showing [[paradigm levelling]], though the older form ''verkoren'' remains more formal.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples:

; '''*f ~ *b''' (no examples in the modern languages) {{citation needed|reason=for "no examples in the modern languages". In Low German one can find verbs where in the written form ''v'' and ''b'' change like ''lȩben'' ([to] live) and ''lȩv'' ([I] live) in Low German from Dithmarschen. That's at least a change of letters or a "grammatical alternation" (NB: Germans explain their "grammatischer Wechsel" as "Wechsel der Buchstaben" or "Buchstabenwechsel", that is "change of letters" or "letter change"). And ''v'' and ''b'' rather resemble ''f'' and ''b'' than e.g. ''h'' and ''g''.|date=January 2017}}
: Old English: ''he'''bb'''an – hō'''f''' hō'''f'''on ha'''f'''en'' ("to lift", cf. ''heave'')

; '''*þ ~ *d''' (survives in modern German)
: Old English: ''cwe'''þ'''an (cwi'''þþ''') cwæ'''þ''' – cwǣ'''d'''on cwe'''d'''en'' ("to say", cf. ''quoth'')
: Old English: ''sēo'''þ'''an (sīe'''þþ''') sēa'''þ''' – su'''d'''on so'''d'''en'' ("to boil", cf. ''seethe'')
: Modern German: ''schnei'''d'''en – schni'''tt''' geschni'''tt'''en'' ("to cut")

; '''*h ~ *g''' (survives in modern Dutch and modern German)
: Middle High German: ''zî'''h'''en zê'''ch''' – zi'''g'''en gezi'''g'''en'' ("to upbraid")
: Old English: ''þeon (þīe'''h'''þ) þā'''h''' – þi'''g'''on þi'''g'''en'' ("to prosper", cf. German ''gedeihen'')
: Modern Dutch: ''slaan sla - sloe'''g''' gesla'''g'''en'' ("to hit", Dutch lost intervocalic ''h'')
: Modern German: ''zie'''h'''en - zo'''g''', gezo'''g'''en'' ("to pull", the intervocalic ''h'' is not pronounced)

; '''*hw ~ *gw/w/g''' (survives in modern Dutch)
: Old English: ''sēon sea'''h''' – sā'''w'''on se'''w'''en'' ("to see", Old English lost intervocalic ''h'')
:: (Remnant in Modern English spelling: ''see – sa'''w''''')
: Old High German: ''se'''h'''an sa'''h''' – sā'''g'''un gise'''h'''an/gise'''w'''an''
: Modern Dutch: ''zien zie gezien – za'''g''' za'''g'''en'' ("to see", Dutch lost intervocalic ''h'')
: Modern Swedish: ''se ser – så'''g'''''

; '''*s ~ *z''' (survives in modern Dutch, and in the English and Dutch copula)
: Old English: ''we'''s'''an, wæ'''s''' – wǣ'''r'''on'' ("to be")
:: Modern English: ''wa'''s''' – we'''r'''e''
: Old English: ''cēo'''s'''an, cēa'''s''' – cu'''r'''on co'''r'''en'' ("to choose")
: Old English: ''frēo'''s'''an, frēa'''s''' – fru'''r'''on fro'''r'''en'' ("to freeze")
: Old Norse (early): ''ve'''s'''a, va'''s''' – vá'''r'''u'' ("to be", the -''s''- was soon replaced by -''r''- analogically)
: Old Norse: ''frjó'''s'''a, frý'''ss''' – fru'''r'''u, fro'''r'''inn'' ("to freeze")
: Modern Dutch: ''we'''z'''en, wee'''s''', wa'''s''' – wa'''r'''en'' ("to be")
: Modern Dutch: ''verlie'''z'''en, verlie'''s''' – verloo'''r''', verlo'''r'''en'' ("to lose") 
: Modern Dutch: ''vrie'''z'''en, vrie'''s''' – vroo'''r''', gevro'''r'''en'' ("to freeze")

NB. Not all consonant apophony in Germanic verbs is caused by ''{{lang|de|grammatischer Wechsel}}''. The consonant [[alternation (linguistics)|alternation]] in certain [[Germanic weak verb|weak verbs]] which typically goes along with the ''{{lang|de|[[Germanic umlaut|Rückumlaut]]}}'' phenomenon (''think:thought'', German ''denken:dachte'') is a result of a later development in Germanic known as the [[Germanic spirant law]]. Likewise, the [[terminal devoicing]] which produces a [[fortis-lenis]] alternation in Dutch (''wrijven:wreef'') is an unrelated historical phenomenon.

==Between strong verbs and derived causatives==
In PIE, [[causative]] verbs (meaning "to cause to") were derived from verb roots with a suffix *''-éye-'', and the root vowel was changed to the [[Ablaut grades|''o''-grade]]. Verbs with this suffix eventually became part of the first weak class (*''-jan'' verbs). This suffix always bore the accent, and the verb root never did, while in regular strong verbs the verb root was accented in the present tense. This caused Verner alternation between the original verbs and the causative verbs derived from them.

Examples are numerous in the older languages but are less frequent today, because some levelling has occurred, and in some cases, one verb or the other was lost.

; '''*f ~ *b'''
: Although technically not a strong verb - causative pair, modern Dutch shows the alternation in a verb with the same underlying Proto-Germanic shape.  
''heffen'' ("to lift/raise", from the strong verb *''habjanan'') - ''hebben'' ("to have", from the weak verb *''habjanan'')

; '''*þ ~ *d'''
: Modern German: ''leiden'' ("to suffer, to undergo", originally "to go", from *''līþanan'') – ''leiten'' ("to lead", from *''laidijanan'')

; '''*h ~ *g'''
: Modern Icelandic: ''hlæja'' ("to laugh", from *''hlahjanan'') – ''hlægja'' ("to make laugh", from *''hlōgijanan'')

; '''*hw ~ *gw/w/g''' (No attested examples within a single language)
: Gothic ''þreihan'' ("to press", from *''þrinhwanan'') – German ''drängen'' ("to push", from *''þrangwijanan'')

; '''*s ~ *z'''
: Modern English: ''rise'' (from *''rīsanan'') – ''rear'' (from *''raizijanan'')
: Modern Dutch: ''genezen'' ("to heal", from *''ganesanan'') – ''generen'' ("to take care of oneself", from *''nazjanan'')
: Modern German: ''genesen'' ("to heal", from *''ganesanan'') – ''nähren'' ("to feed", from *''nazjanan'')

==In other parts of speech==
''{{lang|de|Grammatischer Wechsel}}'' was originally applied to any pair of etymologically-related words that had different accent placement, including also Proto-Indo-European [[athematic]] nouns. The alternations in nouns were largely eliminated early on in Germanic, but a few cases exist of parallel forms being still preserved in different Germanic languages (such as [[English language|English]] ''glass'' and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ''gler'', an example of the s-z alternation). No attested language, old or modern, shows any alternation in noun paradigms, however.

The term '''internal code''' is a word-for-word translation of the Chinese term '''neima''' (內碼, 内码; [[pinyin]]: nèimă; [[jyutping]]: noi6 maa5). The term is primarily used by [[China|Chinese]] people.

Originally referring to the encoding used “internally” by a [[Chinese system]], it refers to the encoding of a [[character (computing)|character]] in some [[character set]], or to the [[character encoding]] being used. It is not an encoding in itself, and the actual encoding being referred to has to be determined by context.

On any computer system, the internal code is the native encoding being used. For example, in a Big5-based system (e.g., [[Microsoft Windows]] 3.1 localized for traditional Chinese), the internal code is [[Big5]]; similarly, in a [[GB2312|GB]]-based system (e.g., [[MS-DOS|DOS]] running CCDOS), the internal code would be GB2312. On early computers, the [[Chinese language card]] takes the internal codes and renders the corresponding Chinese characters on the screen &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=朱|first=巧明|title=中文信息处理技术教程|date=2005|isbn=9787302117612|url=https://book.douban.com/subject/1689879/|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;. On many modern operating systems (such as all modern Microsoft Windows systems), the internal code is a form of [[Unicode]].

Within a particular encoding, the internal code of a certain character simply means the value of the [[code point]] used to represent that character. For example, in the Big5 encoding, the character "一" (Chinese, lit. ''one'') has the internal code of A440 ([[hexadecimal]]); in the GB encoding, the same character has the internal code of D2BB.

==The "neima method"==
:''For more examples when the internal code is Unicode, see [[Unicode#Input methods|Unicode]].''

The internal code can be used as an [[input method]] for inputting [[Han characters]]. This input method is usually called 內碼 in Chinese and is usually provided for Big5 and GB internal codes; in English, it may be variously called “neima”, “internal code”, “raw code”, or other similar names.

For example, in a Big5-based system, one can input the character 一 by typing “A440” using the “internal code” input method. On the other hand, in a GB-based system, to input the character one would itype “D2BB”.

NeiMa expects the user to input the desired character by providing its value within the user-chosen [[character set]].

For example, to input the Chinese character "不" ([[Pinyin]] "bù" - English "not") one can start the Neima editor, switch to [[Unicode]] character encoding mode and then type "bù"'s [[hexadecimal]] value within Unicode's table, which is '''4E0D'''. 
NeiMa is a very awkward way of typing in characters, as a user would need to know the code points of all needed characters.

More generally speaking, NeiMa in Unicode mode accepts any code point within the Unicode table, so users are not limited to inputting Chinese characters, but also any other character that can be found within the Unicode table. For example, '''Latin Capital Letter A''', '''''A''''', may be inputted with NeiMa using A's Unicode code point, which is '''0041'''.

On a Unicode-based system, one might be able to input a character by typing its Unicode number in hexadecimal. Such an input method might also be called “neima”, or it might be called “Unicode”.

On a JIS-based system (Japanese), there might be a ''kuten'' input method that  allows characters to be input using a form of the internal code called the "kuten form"; this kind of input method is called ''quwei'' on GB-based systems (Chinese). Although the kuten (quwei) form is related to the internal code, such input methods are not usually referred as “internal code” input methods.

The use of an “internal code” input method to input characters would not be normally very practical. However, it is useful for inputting special symbols that may otherwise be impossible to input using other input methods. However, the user would need to have a table of characters with their internal codes.

'''Inverted question marks''' ('''¿''') and '''exclamation marks''' ([[English in the Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth English]]) or '''exclamation points''' ([[American English]]) ('''¡''') are [[punctuation]] marks used to begin interrogative and exclamatory sentences (or clauses), respectively, in written [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and sometimes also in languages which have cultural ties with Spanish, such as in older standards of [[Galician language|Galician]] (now it is optional and not recommended){{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} and the [[Waray language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=De Veyra|first=Vicente I.|title=Kandabao: Essays on Waray language, literature, and culture|date=1982|chapter=Ortograpiya han Binisaya}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can also be combined in several ways to express the combination of a question and surprise or disbelief. The initial marks are normally mirrored at the end of the sentence or clause by the common marks ('''?''', '''!''') used in most other languages. Unlike the ending marks, which are printed along the [[Baseline (typography)|baseline]] of a sentence, the inverted marks (¿ and ¡) [[Descender|descend below the line]].

Inverted marks were originally recommended by the ''[[Royal Spanish Academy|Real Academia Española]]'' (Royal Spanish Academy) in 1754, and adopted gradually over the next century.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

On computers, inverted marks are supported by various standards, including [[ISO/IEC 8859-1|ISO-8859-1]], [[Unicode]], and [[SGML entity|HTML]]. They can be entered directly on keyboards designed for Spanish-speaking countries, or via alternative methods on other keyboards.

==Usage==
{{main|Spanish orthography}}
The inverted [[question mark]] (¿) is a [[punctuation]] mark written before the first letter of an interrogative sentence or clause to indicate that a question follows. It is a rotated form of the standard symbol "?" recognized by speakers of languages written with the [[Latin alphabet]]. In most languages, a single question mark is used, and only at the end of an interrogative sentence: "How old are you?" This was once true of the Spanish language.

The inverted question mark was adopted long{{specify|date=October 2017}} after the [[Royal Spanish Academy|Real Academia]]'s decision, published in the second edition of the {{lang|es|Ortografía de la lengua castellana}} (Orthography of the Castilian language) in 1754&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.rae.es/sites/default/files/Tabla_ediciones_Ortografia.pdf|title=Ediciones de la Ortografía Académica|publisher=Real Academia Española}}&lt;/ref&gt; recommending it as the symbol indicating the beginning of a question in written Spanish—e.g. {{lang|es|"¿Cuántos años tienes?"|italic=yes}} ("How old are you?"). The Real Academia also ordered the same inverted-symbol system for statements of exclamation, using the symbols "¡" and "!". This helps to recognize questions and exclamations in long sentences.  "Do you like summer?" and "You like summer." are translated respectively as {{lang|es|"¿Te gusta el verano?"|italic=yes}} and {{lang|es|"Te gusta el verano."|italic=yes}} (There is not always a difference between the wording of a [[yes–no question]] and the corresponding statement in Spanish.) These new rules were slowly adopted; there exist nineteenth-century books in which the writer does not use either opening symbol, neither the "¡" nor the "¿".

In sentences that are both declarative and interrogative, the clause that asks a question is isolated with the starting-symbol inverted question mark, for example: {{lang|es|"Si no puedes ir con ellos, ¿quieres ir con nosotros?"|italic=yes}} ("If you cannot go with them, would you like to go with us?")

Some writers omit the inverted question mark in the case of a short unambiguous question such as: {{lang|es|"Quién viene?"|italic=yes}} ("Who comes?"). This is the criterion in [[Catalan language|Catalan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter=Els signes d'interrogació i d'admiració (Acord de l'11 de juny de 1993) |title=Documents de la Secció Filològica |volume=III |year=1996 |author=[[Institut d'Estudis Catalans]] |pages=92–94 |url=http://www.iecat.net/institucio/seccions/Filologica/llenguacatalana/documentsnormatius/docsf2.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906173859/http://www.iecat.net/institucio/seccions/Filologica/llenguacatalana/documentsnormatius/docsf2.htm |archivedate=2011-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain Catalan-language authorities, such as [[Joan Solà i Cortassa]], insist that both the opening and closing question marks be used for clarity.

Some Spanish-language writers, among them Nobel laureate [[Pablo Neruda]] (1904–1973), refuse to use the inverted question mark.&lt;ref&gt;Pablo Neruda, {{cite web |url= http://www.pehuen.cl/docman/neruda/antlogia-fundamental/download.html |title= ''Antología Fundamental'' |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120425154155/http://www.pehuen.cl/docman/neruda/antlogia-fundamental/download.html |archivedate= 2012-04-25 |df=  }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(556&amp;nbsp;KB)}}, (June 2008). {{ISBN|978-956-16-0169-7}}. p. 7 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common in Internet chat rooms and instant messaging now to use only the single "?" as an ending symbol for a question, since it saves typing time. Multiple closing symbols are used for emphasis: {{lang|es|"Por qué dices eso??"|italic=yes}}, instead of the standard {{lang|es|"¿Por qué dices eso?"|italic=yes}} ("Why do you say that?"). Some may also use the ending symbol for both beginning and ending, giving {{lang|es|"?Por qué dices eso?"|italic=yes}} Given the informal setting, this might be unimportant; however, teachers see this as a problem, fearing and claiming that contemporary young people are inappropriately and incorrectly extending the practice to academic homework and essays.

== History  ==
{{missing information|how inverted punctuation came about in the languages of Spain|date=October 2014}}
In 1668, [[John Wilkins]] proposed using the inverted exclamation mark "¡" as a symbol at the end of a sentence to [[irony punctuation|denote irony]]. He was one of many, including [[Desiderius Erasmus]], who felt there was a need for such a punctuation mark, but Wilkins' proposal, as was true of the other attempts, failed to take hold.&lt;ref name="Houston2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Keith Houston|title=Shady Characters: The Secret Life of Punctuation, Symbols, and Other Typographical Marks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3R2SAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA214|date=24 September 2013|publisher=W.

Although it has now become rare, it is correct usage in Spanish to begin a sentence with an opening inverted [[exclamation mark]] ("¡") and end it with a question mark ("?"), or vice versa, for statements that are questions but also have a clear sense of exclamation or surprise such as: {{lang|es|¡Y tú quién te crees?}} ("Who do you think you are?!"). Normally, four signs are used, always with one type in the outer side and the other in the inner side (nested) (''{{lang|es|¿¡Y tú quién te crees!?}}'', ''{{lang|es|¡¿Y tú quién te crees?!}}''&lt;ref&gt;[[Real Academia Española|RAE]]'s [http://lema.rae.es/dpd/srv/search?id=Ivs8zvWdED6bQUncsG|bH8aKhoE1D6eF5Wp4C] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[Unicode#Versions|Unicode 5.1]] also includes {{unichar|2E18|INVERTED INTERROBANG}}, which is an [[Interrobang#Inverted interrobang|inverted version of the interrobang]] (also known as a "gnaborretni"), a nonstandard punctuation mark used to denote both excitement and a question in just one glyph.

==Computer usage==
===Encodings===
"¡" and "¿" are both located within the Unicode Common block, and are both inherited from ISO-8859-1.  "¡" has Unicode code point U+00A1 (decimal entity reference &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#161;&lt;/code&gt;) and HTML named entity reference &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;iexcl;&lt;/code&gt;.  "¿" has Unicode code point U+00BF (decimal entity reference &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#191;&lt;/code&gt;) and has HTML named entity reference &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;iquest;&lt;/code&gt;.  In both cases, the "i" in the named entity reference is an initialism for "inverted".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/sgml/entities.html Character entity references in HTML 4], W3C. {{year missing|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Input methods===
[[File:Left side of modern US-International keyboard.JPG|thumb|350px|The ¡ character is accessible using [[AltGr]]+1 on a modern [[US-International]] keyboard. It is also available using a standard US keyboard by switching to the US-International keyboard layout.]]
====Microsoft Windows====
"¿" is available in all [[keyboard layout]]s for Spanish-speaking countries.

Users of English (US) keyboards under [[Microsoft Windows]] can obtain the inverted question mark "¿" using the [[Alt code]] method by holding down the Alt key and pressing 0191 or any multiple of 256 + 168 on the number pad and the inverted exclamation mark "¡" with number pad code 0161 or 173. In [[Microsoft Word]], the inverted question and exclamation marks can be typed by holding down the Ctrl, Alt, and shift keys while typing a normal question or exclamation mark, or by typing either mark at the start of the sentence whilst in the Spanish language mode.

Windows users with a US keyboard layout are able to switch to the US-International layout. Among other changes, this converts the {{keypress|Alt}} key to the right of the space bar into the {{keypress|Alt Gr}} (graphics) key. (The left Alt key remains unchanged.) When the right {{keypress|Alt}} key is held down and other keys are pressed, the combination produces other characters not found on the standard US keyboard. For instance, the keystroke {{keypress|right Alt|1}} produces an inverted exclamation mark, while {{keypress|right Alt|/}} yields the inverted question marks.

====macOS====
On the macOS platform (or when using the "US International"/us-intl keyboard layout on Windows and Linux), "¡" and "¿" can be entered by pressing {{keypress|Alt}}/{{keypress|option|1}} and {{keypress|Shift|Alt}}/{{keypress|option|/}} respectively. With a [[compose key]], for example, &lt;LEFT SHIFT&gt; + &lt;RIGHT CTRL&gt;, they can be entered by pressing the compose key and {{keypress|!}} or {{keypress|?}} twice.
And for AZERTY keyboards, the shortcut is: fn + alt + ! (number 8).

====LaTeX====
In [[LaTeX]] documents, the "¿" is written as &lt;code&gt;?`&lt;/code&gt; (question mark, backtick) or &lt;code&gt;\textquestiondown&lt;/code&gt;, and "¡" as &lt;code&gt;!`&lt;/code&gt; (exclamation point, backtick) or &lt;code&gt;\textexclamdown&lt;/code&gt;.   (This may require including "\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}" at the top of the document.) [[XeTeX|XeLaTeX]] and [[LuaTeX|LuaLaTeX]] have full Unicode support, and literal ¿ and ¡ characters may be input.

===Use in filenames===
In Windows, an inverted question mark is valid in a file or directory name, whereas the normal question mark is a [[reserved character]] which cannot be so used.

'''Joxe Azurmendi Otaegi''' (born 19 March 1941) is a Basque writer, [[Philosophy|philosopher]], [[essay]]ist and [[Poetry|poet]]. He has published numerous articles and books on [[ethics]], [[politics]], the philosophy of [[language]], [[Technology|technique]], [[Basque literature]] and [[philosophy]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.euskadi.net/harluxet/hiztegia.asp?sarrera=Azurmendi "Azurmendi, Joxe"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123081027/http://www1.euskadi.net/harluxet/hiztegia.asp?sarrera=Azurmendi |date=23 November 2015 }}. Harluxet Hiztegi Entziklopedikoa (Encyclopedia Online in Basque)(Retrieved 29 October 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

He is member of ''[[Jakin (magazine)|Jakin]]'' and the director of ''Jakin irakurgaiak'', a publishing house which has published over 40 books under his management. He also collaborated with the ''Klasikoak''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ei.ehu.es/p289-content/en/contenidos/informacion/euskara_inst_erdaretan/en_erdaret/klasikoak.html ''Klasikoak''], Collection of translations into the Basque language of the classics of universal thought (website of EHU)&lt;/ref&gt; publishing firm in the Basque translations of various philosophical works and was one of the founders of ''Udako Euskal Unibertsitatea'' (The Basque Summer University).&lt;ref&gt;Andoni Olariaga: "Joxe Azurmendi. Askatasunaren pentsalaria" in Alaitz Aizpuru, ''Eukal Herriko pentsamenduaren gida'', Bilbo: UEU, 2012. p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently a Professor of Modern Philosophy and a lecturer at [[Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea]] (The University of the Basque Country).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ehu.es/ehg/literatura/idazleak/?p=195 Joxe Azurmendi] at The University of the Basque Country (EHU)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 he was awarded the title "honorary academic" by [[Euskaltzaindia]] (The Basque Language Academy).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euskaltzaindia.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=56&amp;Itemid=404&amp;lang=eu Joxe Azurmendi] at The Basque Language Academy&lt;/ref&gt;

Azurmendi is an intellectual who studies the problem more than the solution. Azurmendi's essays cover modern European topics in great depth and knowledge. He has incorporated the philosophy and thinking of European thinkers, especially German ones. He often adopts a polemic tone.&lt;ref&gt;Altzibar, Xabier. "The Essay in Basque" in Mari Jose Olaziregi (ed.), ''Basque Literary History'', Reno, Center for Basque Studies/University of Nevada, pp.&amp;nbsp;283–84&lt;/ref&gt;

Joxe Azurmendi is, in the opinion of many, one of the most prolific and erudite thinkers in the [[Euskal Herria|Basque Country]].&lt;ref&gt;Altzibar, Xabier. "The Essay in Basque" in Mari Jose Olaziregi (ed.), ''Basque Literary History'', Reno: Center for Basque Studies/University of Nevada, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iturriotz, Ander (2010). "Zergatik Azurmendi?", ''Hegats'', 45: 9-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Joxe Azurmendi studied [[philosophy]] and [[theology]] at [[Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea|The University of the Basque Country]], [[Rome]] and [[Münster]].&lt;ref&gt;Preface of Gandiaga in Joxe Azurmendi: ''Hitz berdeak'', Oñati: EFA, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 1960s he joined the cultural movement which grew up around the magazine ''[[Jakin (magazine)|Jakin]]'', and was in fact the director of the publication when it was prohibited for the first time by [[Francisco Franco|Franco's regime]]. He has collaborated closely and uninterruptedly with the magazine since its restoration. In that publication he has raised the problems of Basque society in the context of European thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;Sudupe, Pako: ''50eko hamarkadako euskal literatura II'', Donostia: Utriusque Vasconiae, 2011. p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; During the early 1970s he focused his attention on disseminating basic literature in the [[Euskara|Basque language]] on subjects which were being hotly debated at the time in the Basque Country: [[nationhood]], [[socialism]], [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]],&lt;ref&gt;Joxe Azurmendi: ''Arana Goiri-ren pentsamendu politikoa'', Donostia: Hordago Lur, 1979. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; etc. In the 1980s he began teaching at [[Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea|The University of the Basque Country]], and in 1984 he submitted his thesis on [[Jose Maria Arizmendiarrieta]], the founder of the [[Mondragon Corporation|Mondragon cooperative movement]], in which he argued that Arizmendiarrieta's project aimed to unite [[Person|individuals]] and [[society]] under an organisation which combined both [[socialism]] and French [[personalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Andoni Olariaga: "Joxe Azurmendi. Askatasunaren pentsalaria" in Alaitz Aizpuru, ''Euskal Herriko pentsamenduaren gida'', Bilbo: UEU, 2012. p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 he published what was to become his best-known work: ''Espainolak eta euskaldunak'' (The Spanish and the Basques). The work, published by Elkar, was written in response to a text by [[Claudio Sánchez-Albornoz|Sánchez-Albornoz]] which claimed that "The Basques are the last people to be civilised in Spain; they have a thousand years less civilisation than any other people&amp;nbsp;... They are rough, simple people who nevertheless consider themselves to be the children of God and the heirs to his glory. But they are really nothing more than un-Romanised Spaniards."&lt;ref&gt;Joxe Azurmendi: ''Espainolak eta euskaldunak'', Donostia: Elkar, 1992. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Azurmendi's essay refuted and dismantled the stereotypes maintained about the Basques by certain Spanish intellectuals.

It was on the threshold of the new millennium, however, that Azurmendi's work reached its height. During the early years of the 21st century he published the trilogy formed by ''Espainiaren arimaz'' (About the soul of Spain) (2006, Elkar), ''Humboldt. Hizkuntza eta pentsamendua'' (Humboldt. Language and Thought) (2007, UEU) and ''Volksgeist. Herri gogoa'' (Volksgeist. National Character) (2008, Elkar). In this trilogy, Joxe Azurmendi reveals some of his most significant thinking.

==Philosophical work==
His work emerged and developed during a period marked by a crisis of culture, politics and values. But it was a crisis that he understood not as something negative, but rather something that opened up a whole new range of possibilities. Consequently, all his thinking is centred around the defence of [[Liberty|freedom]] in every field, but especially in relation to [[conscience]] and [[thinking]].

Far from fleeing the crisis, then, his work tries to outline how we can live in this situation. To this end, he adopts a [[relativism|relativist]] perspective, and given that [[modernity]] has left us with no solid base, he fights against the last vestiges of the [[dogmatism]] towards which our society tends to lean when in crisis:
{{quote|" ''The proclamation of relativism is provocative.&amp;nbsp;... I am not particularly interested in being an apostle of relativism. But as I come from a dogmatic culture [Franco's regime], I'm allergic to some things. Truth, Reason and absolute correction were Catholic in that culture. Now I hear that postmodern relativism is the cause of the moral misery and the loss of values. It is seen that there is a nostalgia of dogmatic culture, disguised with some democratic and enlightened discourse. That dogmatic culture has relativism as its enemy, for that reason I claim this convicted relativism. But it is not an absolute relativism.''"&lt;ref&gt;Joxe Azurmendi: "The Basques are Argonauts with very fragile ships", Interview in ''Hegats'' (45), p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In this sense, for example, he is critical of the modern [[State (polity)|state]], which he accuses of being the new [[Christian Church|church]] seeking to control our consciences.&lt;ref&gt;Joxe Azurmendi: ''Barkamena, kondena, tortura'', Donostia: Elkar, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He also criticises the exploitation of [[morality]], or in other words, how politicians, instead of solving the problems facing them in their various areas or fields, flee instead to moral ground in order to hide their responsibilities under the cloak of supposedly absolute moral principles:
{{quote|"''In the mean time, what is the point of repeating the old tale as to what the state is becoming? Once the sour critical analysis of sometime ago ([[Herbert Marcuse]]: ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]''), the dark negative utopias ([[Aldous Huxley]], [[George Orwell]]) and the protest cries ([[May 68]]) are forgotten, and with a near lack of the slightest sense of resistance in civil society, the cobweb of power spins peacefully over our heads, all over the place. Even the dressing room.''"&lt;ref&gt;Joxe Azurmendi: ''Demokratak eta biolentoak'',Donostia: Elkar, 1997. p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He has also made an important contribution in questioning the canonical interpretations which have been constructed regarding different issues. Of particular interest, due to his erudition and training in Germany, is his interpretation of the German [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. In this context he deconstructs the apparent opposition between the French [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and German [[Romanticism]] and proposes a new way of thinking about the different aspects which stem from this opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Joxe Azurmendi: ''Volksgeist. Herri gogoa'', Donostia: Elkar, 2008. p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, he defies certain Spanish and French intellectuals ([[Alain Finkielkraut]]&lt;ref&gt;Joxe Azurmendi: ''Euskal Herria krisian'', Donostia: Elkar, 1999. p.119&lt;/ref&gt;) and argues that [[nationalism]] in fact arose in France ([[Montesquieu]], [[Voltaire]], [[Rousseau]], [[Ernest Renan]]) and was later reinterpreted by the German thinkers and romantics. By doing this, he questions the way in which authors such as [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] or [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldt]] are viewed as the fathers of [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] nationalism. In this field, the opposition between [[civic nationalism]] and [[ethnic nationalism]] is deconstructed.&lt;ref&gt;Joxe Azurmendi: ''Historia, arraza, nazioa'', Donostia: Elkar, 2014. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Azurmendi criticizes the [[Essentialism|essentialist]] basis of Spanish nationalism&lt;ref&gt;Joxe Azurmendi: ''Espainiaren arimaz'', Donostia: Elkar, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and French nationalism&lt;ref&gt;Joxe Azurmendi: ''Historia, arraza, nazioa'', Donostia: Elkar, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; that operates under these [[nation state]]s.

Some of the topics Azurmendi deeply develops in his essays first appeared in his poetry of youth. Azurmendi is within the Basque poetry of the 60s which shows the fight against the tradition, the old faith and the dogmatic certainties:&lt;ref&gt;Estankona, I. 2010: "Artean gazte eta berde: Azurmendiren ''Hitz berdeak'' eta ''Manifestu atzeratua''", ''Hegats'', 45: 71-83&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em;"&gt;
But we wish to be free
is that my fault?
They tried to give us a tree from [[Gernikako Arbola|Gernika]],
a false blank check,
as if the desire to be free were a sin,
but despite that, we, quite simply, wish to be free.
That is what we want, that is all.
This is the latest deception:
they have led us to believe
before from outside and now from within
that it is our responsibility to justify our wish to be free.

''Manifestu atzeratua'' (Belated Manifesto) (1968)
&lt;/poem&gt;

He also dedicates a large part of his work to recovering and reinterpreting Basque thinkers, breaking through and dismantling numerous stereotypes. Of particular interest is his research into [[Jon Mirande]], [[Nikolas Ormaetxea|Orixe]], [[Unamuno]]&lt;ref&gt;Joxe Azurmendi: "Unamunoren atarian" in ''Euskal Herriko pentsamenduaren gida'', Bilbo: UEU, 2012. p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joxe Azurmendi: ''Bakea Gudan. Unamuno, historia eta karlismoa'', Tafalla: Txalaparta, 2012. Azurmendi delves into the thinking of Unamuno, under the pretext of the novel ''Paz en la guerra'' by Unamuno, which deals with the last Carlist War and especially with the site of Bilbo. It therefore turned out in an interpretive essay on the conflict [[Carlism]] vs. [[liberalism]], or in other words, in an interpretive essay on Basque Country and Modernity. According to Azurmendi Unamuno analyzed and rejected the Basque problem from a 19th-century point of view&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Interview on Unamuno: [https://archive.is/20131030100225/http://paperekoa.berria.info/plaza/2012-05-31/032/001/unamuno_ez_da_inoiz_liberala_izan_antiliberala_zen_azken_fasean_ere.htm «Unamuno ez da inoiz liberala izan; antiliberala zen azken fasean ere»], ''Berria'', 31 May 2012 (Retrieved 29 October 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; and others. He is an author who has worked from within and for Basque culture. He claims to have been influenced by Basque authors&lt;ref&gt;Joxe Azurmendi: "Kierkegaard-en 'egunkari ezkutua'", in J.L. Ormaetxea, ''Txillardegi lagun giroan'', Bilbo: UEU, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; from the post-war period, for example, in questions of language. In this field, he has researched other authors also, including [[Heidegger]], [[Wittgenstein]], [[George Steiner]] and [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldt]]. The fact that his vast oeuvre is all written in the [[Basque language]] is clearly consistent with his thinking.

==Writing style==
In his language Joxe Azurmendi combines an educated register with colloquial expressions, and his prose is fast, incisive, and ironic. Azurmendi's [[Basque language|Basque]] is modern and standard and he demonstrates great knowledge of the language, and richness and variety of expression.&lt;ref&gt;Altzibar, Xabier 2012.

'''Kata Kolok''' (literally "deaf talk"), also known as '''Benkala Sign Language''' and '''Balinese Sign Language''', is a [[village sign language]] which is indigenous to two neighbouring villages in northern [[Bali]], Indonesia. The main village, [[Bengkala]],  has had high incidences of deafness for over seven generations. Notwithstanding the biological time depth of the recessive mutation that causes deafness, the first substantial cohort of deaf signers did not occur until five generations ago, and this event marks the emergence of Kata Kolok (de Vos 2012). 

Kata Kolok is unrelated to [[Balinese language|spoken Balinese]] and lacks certain [[contact sign]] phenomena that often arise when a sign language and an oral language are in close contact, such as [[fingerspelling]] and [[mouthing]]. It is also unrelated to other sign languages. It differs from other known sign languages in a number of respects: Signers make extensive use of cardinal directions and real-world locations to organize the signing space, and they do not use a metaphorical “time line” for time reference. Kata Kolok is the only known sign language which predominantly deploys the absolute Frame of Reference.

Deaf people in the village express themselves using special cultural forms such as deaf dance and [[martial arts]] and occupy special ritual and social roles, including digging graves and maintaining water pipes. Deaf and hearing villagers alike share a belief in a deaf god. 

The sign language has been acquired by at least five generations of deaf, native signers and features in all aspects of village life, including political, professional, educational, and religious settings. The Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics (MPI) and the International Institute for Sign Languages and Deaf Studies have archived over 100 hours of Kata Kolok video data. The metadata of this corpus are accessible online (see www.mpi.nl).

This novel not only gave him international recognition but he was also awarded the Maharashtra Gourav Puraskar, and the [[Sahitya Akademi]] award for this novel. Considered a masterpiece in [[Marathi literature]], his novel for the first time brings to the world of literature the trials and tribulations of his tribe, Uchalya, literally the pilferers, a term coined by the British who classified the tribe as a criminal tribe. This book also brings in the problems faced by the [[Dalits]] in [[India]].

Other notable novels written by him include ''Dubang'', ''Chini Mathachi Divas'', ''Samaj Sahitya Ani Swathantra'', ''Wadar Vedna'', ''Vakila Pardhi'', ''Utav'' and ''A Swathantra Konasat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/acq/ovop/delhi/salrp/laxmanmarutigaikwad.html |title=Laxman Maruti Gaikwad - Marathi Writer: The South Asian Literary Recordings Project (Library of Congress New Delhi Office) |publisher=Loc.gov |date=1956-07-23 |accessdate=2013-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social services==
Gaikwad has been associated with social services for a long time. Since 1986, he was the President of the Jankalyan Vikas Sanstha and since 1990, he has been the President of the Denotified and Nomadic Tribes Organization, an organization associated with the welfare of Tribes. He has actively participated in the [[Labor Movement]] and worked for the welfare of the [[farmers]], slum-dwellers and the other weaker-sections of the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samanvayindianlanguagesfestival.org/2012/laxman-gaikwad/ |title=Laxman Gaikwad |publisher=Samanvayindianlanguagesfestival.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within [[Cosa Nostra]] a '''mandamento''' is traditionally a district of three geographically contiguous [[Sicilian Mafia|Mafia]] [[Cosca|cosche]]
(families controlling a single land feud, or a city ward) in [[Sicily]]. A '''capo mandamento''' representing the mandamento is usually entitled to be part of the provincial [[Sicilian Mafia Commission|Mafia Commission]].&lt;ref name=paoli53&gt;Paoli, ''Mafia Brotherhoods'', p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of Mandamenti==
[[Palermo]] - The city of Palermo is divided into 8 local mandamenti: [[Porta Nuova, Palermo|Porta Nuova]], [[Brancaccio]], [[Boccadifalco]], [[Passo di Rigano]], [[Santa Maria di Gesù]], Noce, [[Pagliarelli]], [[Resuttana]] and San Lorenzo.

[[Province of Palermo]] - The province of Palermo is divided into 7 mandamenti: [[Camporeale]] (born from the merger of the mandamenti of [[Partinico]] and [[San Giuseppe Jato]]), [[Corleone]], [[Cinisi]], [[Bagheria]], [[Trabia]], [[Belmonte Mezzagno]], [[San Mauro Castelverde]].

[[Province of Agrigento]] - The province of Agrigento consists of 10 mandamenti: [[Agrigento]], [[Santa Elisabetta]], [[Porto Empedocle]], [[Canicattì]], [[Cianciana]], [[Ribera, Agrigento|Ribera]], [[Sambuca di Sicilia]], [[Casteltermini]], [[Palma di Montechiaro]] and [[Campobello di Licata]].

[[Province of Trapani]] - The province of Trapani consists of 4 mandamenti: [[Castelvetrano]], [[Trapani]], [[Mazara del Vallo]] and [[Alcamo]].

[[Province of Caltanissetta]] - The province of Caltanissetta consists of 4 mandamenti: [[Gela]], [[Vallelunga]], [[Riesi]] and [[Mussomeli]].

'''Maninka''' (Malinke), or more precisely '''Eastern Maninka''', is the name of several closely related languages and dialects of the southeastern [[Manding languages|Manding]] subgroup of the [[Mande languages|Mande]] branch of the [[Niger–Congo languages]]. It is the mother tongue of the [[Malinké|Malinké people]] and is spoken by 3,300,000 speakers in [[Guinea]], where it is the main language in the [[Upper Guinea]] region, and [[Mali]], where the closely related [[Bambara language|Bambara]] is a [[national language]], as well as in [[Liberia]], [[Senegal]], [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Ivory Coast]], where it has no official status. It was the language of court and government used during the [[Mali empire]].

==Phonology==

The Wudala dialect of Eastern Maninkaka, spoken in the central highlands of Guinea and comprehensible to speakers of all dialects in that country, has the following phonemic inventory.&lt;ref&gt;Mamadou Camara (1999) ''Parlons Malinké''&lt;/ref&gt; (Apart from tone, which is not written, sounds are given in orthography, as IPA values are not certain.)

;Tones
There are two moraic tones, high and low, which in combination form rising and falling tones. 

The marker for definiteness is a falling [[floating tone]]: {{IPA|/kɔ̀nɔ̀/}} 'a bird' (LL), {{IPA|/kɔ̀nɔ᷈/}} 'the bird' (LLHL, perhaps {{IPA|[kɔ̌nɔ̂]}}); {{IPA|/kɔ́nɔ̀/}} 'a belly' (HL), {{IPA|/kɔ́nɔ᷈/}} 'the belly' (HLHL, perhaps {{IPA|[kɔ̂nɔ̂]}}). 

;Vowels
Vowel qualities are {{IPA|/i e ɛ a ɔ o u/}}. All may be long or short, oral or nasal: {{IPA|/ii ee ɛɛ aa ɔɔ oo uu/}} and {{IPA|/in en ɛn an ɔn on un/}}. (It may be that all nasal vowels are long.) Nasal vowels nasalize some following consonants. 

;Consonants

{|class=wikitable
|+Maninkaka consonants&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Alphabets des langues africaines|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1993|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|||g~gb
|-

|||
|}

/d/ typically becomes a flap [ɾ] between vowels. /ty/ (also written "c") often becomes /k/ before the vowels /i/ or /ɛ/. There is regional variation between /g/ and the [[labial&amp;ndash;velar]] /gb/. /h/ occurs mostly in Arabic loans, and is established. /p/ occurs in French and English loans, and is in the process of stabilizing. 

Several voiced consonants become nasals after a nasal vowel. /b/ becomes /m/, /y/ becomes /ny/, and /l/ becomes /n/. For example, nouns ending in oral vowels take the plural in ''-lu''; nouns ending in nasal vowels take ''-nu''. However, /d/ remains oral, as in /nde/ "I, me".

==Writing==
Maninka in Guinea is written in an official Latin-based script, an [[Guinean languages alphabet|older official orthography]] (also Latin-based), and the [[N'Ko alphabet]].

'''MateCat''' is a web-based computer-assisted translation (CAT) tool, of which there are several on the current market. MateCat is released as open source software under the Lesser General Public License (LGPL) from the Free Software Foundation.

== The project ==
MateCat, acronym of Machine Translation Enhanced Computer Assisted Translation, is a 3-year research project (11/2011-10/2014) funded by the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under grant agreement #287688.&lt;ref&gt;José, M., &amp; Machado, B. (2014). Free and open-source software — a translator’s good friend, 3. Retrieved from http://ec.europa.eu/translation/portuguese/magazine&lt;/ref&gt; It  has received already over €2,500,000 of European funds.&lt;ref&gt;EUROPEAN COMMISSION. (2017). ''EUROPEAN COMMISSION STAFF WORKING DOCUMENT INTERIM EVALUATION of  HORIZON 2020 ANNEX 2''. Brussels. Retrieved from http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/10102/2017/EN/SWD-2017-221-F1-EN-MAIN-PART-12.PDF

&lt;/ref&gt;

The project consortium is led by FBK (''Fondazione Bruno Kessler''), an international research center based in Trento, Italy.

== CAT tools  ==
The objective of MateCat is to create a tool to edit machine translation results and manage localization workflow. The system is able to learn from mistakes, automatically improve over time and specialize in field-specific language (for example, legal terminology) to provide the user the most accurate translation suggestions in a completely automatic and transparent manner.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fbk.eu/en/result/matecat/&lt;/ref&gt;

A TM is basically a repository of translated segments. During translation, the CAT tool queries the TM to search for exact or fuzzy matches of the current source segment. These matches are proposed to the user as translation suggestions. Once a segment is translated, its source and target texts are added to the TM for future queries. The integration of suggestions from an MT engine as a complement to TM matches is motivated by recent studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Marcello Federico|author2=Alessandro Cattelan|author3=Marco Trombetti|date=2012|title=Measuring user productivity in machine translation enhanced computer assisted translation. In ''Proceedings of the Tenth Conference of the Association for Machine Translation in the Americas (AMTA)''|url=http://amta2012.amtaweb.org/AMTA2012Files/papers/123.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Amta2012.amtaweb.org|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Spence Green|author2=Jeffrey Heer|author3=Christopher D Manning|date=2013|title=The efficacy of human post-editing for language translation.

== Technology ==

=== Statistical MT ===
The MateCat tool runs as a web-server accessible through Chrome. The CAT web-server connects with other services via open APIs: the TM server MyMemory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MyMemory is the world’s largest Translation Memory (TM) built collaboratively via MT and human contributions|url=http://mymemory.translated.net/|publisher=Mymemory.translated.net|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the commercial Google Translate (GT) MT server, and a list of Moses &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statmt.org/moses/|title=Moses is the most popular open source statistical MT toolkit|publisher=Statmt.org|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;-based servers specified in a configuration file. While MyMemory’s and GT’s servers are always running and available, customized Moses servers have to be first installed and set-up. Communication with the Moses servers extends the GT API in order to support self-tuning, user-adaptive and informative MT functions. XLIFF &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.oasis-open.org/xliff/v1.2/os/xliff-core.html|title=Docs.oasis-open.org|publisher=Docs.oasis-open.org|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the file format natively supported by the open source version of the MateCat tool; however external file converters can be added in the MateCat configuration file. The tool supports Unicode (UTF-8) encoding, including non-Latin alphabets and right-to-left languages, and handles texts embedding mark-up tags.

MateCat leverages the growing interest and expectations in statistical MT by advancing the state-of-the-art along three directions: Self-tuning MT, User adaptive MT, Informative MT.

Research along these three directions has converged into a new generation CAT software, which is both an enterprise level translation workbench as well as an advanced research platform for integrating new MT functions, running post-editing experiments and measuring user productivity. These include: i) an advanced API for the Moses Toolkit, customizable to languages and domains, ii) ease of use through a clean and intuitive web interface that enables the collaboration of multiple users on the same project, iii) concordances, terminology databases and support for customizable quality estimation components and iv) advanced logging functionalities.

=== MT support ===
The tool supports Moses-based servers able to provide an enhanced CAT-MT communication. In particular, the GT API is augmented with feedback information provided to the MT engine every time a segment is post-edited as well as enriched MT output, including confidence scores, word lattices, etc. The developed MT server supports multi-threading to serve multiple translators, handles text segments including tags and adapts from the post-edits performed by each user &lt;ref&gt;Nicola Bertoldi, Mauro Cettolo, and Marcello Federico. 2013. Cache-based Online Adaptation for Machine Translation Enhanced Computer Assisted Translation. In ''Proceedings of the MT Summit XIV'', pages 35–42, Nice, France, September.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Context-aware translation ===
MateCat also provides suggestions by MT which are consistent with respect not only to the already edited segments but also, in theory, to the whole document. This context information will be embedded in the statistical models and should enable better disambiguation, for instance, between lexical alternatives. The context-based models will combine information about recurring terms and expressions extracted during the document analysis with the corresponding chosen and confirmed translations as soon as they become available. In particular, translation constraints related to inter-sentence and intra-sentence anaphoric expressions, to syntactic concordances, and to lexical coherence will be taken into account by means of specific statistical models.

=== Real-time processing ===
The core components of traditional MT systems, that is, the translation and the language models, are generally static: they never change after an initial training phase. This means that they are unsuitable for a dynamic environment like the one that MateCat is designing for translators. In order to model the dynamic changes depicted in the two previous tasks, MateCat developed innovative data-structures that can be rapidly and effectively updated as soon as a new translation is supplied by the user, and innovative, efficient algorithms for performing this adaptation in such a way that the whole process takes place in real time and is transparent to the translator. Moreover, efficiency will be improved by taking advantage of single CPU multithreading, as well as distributed computing facilities running on private clusters or computer clouds.

=== Edit log ===
[[File:Figure 1 The MateCat Tool edit log page.png|thumb|Figure 1 - The MateCat Tool edit log page.]]
During post-editing the tool collects timing information for each segment, which is updated every time the segment is opened and closed. Moreover, for each segment, information is collected about the generated suggestions and the one that has actually been post-edited. This information is accessible at any time through a link in the Editing Page, named Editing Log. The Editing Log page (Figure 1) shows a summary of the overall editing performed so far on the project, such as the average translation speed and post-editing effort and the percentage of top suggestions coming from MT or the TM. Moreover, for each segment, sorted from the slowest to the fastest in terms of translation speed, detailed statistics about the performed edit operations are reported. This information, with even more details, can be also downloaded as a CSV file to perform a more detailed post-editing analysis. While the information shown in the Edit Log page is very useful to monitor progress of a translation project in real time, the CSV file is a fundamental source of information for detailed productivity analyses once the project is ended.

== Applications ==
MateCat has been exploited by the MateCat project to investigate new MT functions&lt;ref&gt;Bertoldi et al., 2013; Cettolo et al., 2013; Turchi et al., 2013; Turchi et al., 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and to evaluate them in a real professional setting, in which translators have at their disposal all the sources of information they are used to working with. Moreover, taking advantage of its flexibility and ease of use, the tool has been recently exploited for data collection and education purposes (a course on CAT technology for students in translation studies). An initial version of the tool has also been leveraged by the CasmaCat project &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casmacat.eu|title=Casmacat.eu|publisher=Casmacat.eu|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to create a workbench,&lt;ref&gt;Vicent Alabau, Ragnar Bonk, Christian Buck, Michael Carl, Francisco Casacuberta, Mercedes Garca-Martiınez,, Jesus Gonzalez, Philipp Koehn, Luis Leiva, Bartolomé Mesa-Lao, Daniel Oriz, Hervé Saint-Amand, German Sanchis, and Chara Tsiukala. 2013. Advanced computer aided translation with a web-based workbench. In ''Proceedings of Workshop on Post-editing Technology and Practice'', pages 55–62.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly suitable for investigating advanced interaction modalities such as interactive MT, eye tracking, and handwritten input. Currently the tool is employed by the translation agency Translated.net for their internal translation projects and is being tested by several international companies, both language service providers and IT companies. This has made possible to collect continuous feedback from hundreds of translators, which besides helping us to improve the robustness of the tool is also influencing the way new MT functions will be integrated to supply the best help to the final user.

'''Mawayana''' (Mahuayana), also known as '''Mapidian''' (Maopidyán), is a moribund [[Arawakan language]] of [[Guyana]].

== Classification ==
{{harvcoltxt|Aikhenvald|1999}} lists Mawayana (and possibly Mawakwa as a dialect) together with [[Wapishana language|Wapishana]] under a Rio Branco (North-Arawak) branch of the Arawakan family. {{harvcoltxt|Carlin|2006|p= 314}} notes that Mawayana "is closely related to Wapishana" and according to {{harvcoltxt|Ramirez|2001|p= 530}} they share at 47% of their lexicon.

== Phonology ==
Mawayana has, among its consonants, two [[implosive consonant|implosives]], {{IPA|/ɓ/}} and {{IPA|/ɗ/}}, and what has been described as a "retroflex fricativised rhotic", represented with {{angbr|rž}}, that it shares with [[Wapishana language|Wapishana]]. The vowel systems contains four vowels ({{IPA|/i-e, a, ɨ, u-o/}}), each of which has a nasalised counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Carlin|2006|p= 320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Morphosyntax ==
Mawayana has a polysynthetic morphology, mainly head-marking and with suffixes, although there are pronominal prefixes. The verbal arguments are indexed on the verb through subject suffixes on intransitive verbs, while agent prefixes and object suffixes on transitive verbs {{harvcol|Carlin|2006|page= 319}}.

'''Mayo''' is an [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]] language. It is spoken by about 40,000 people, the Mexican [[Mayo people|Mayo]] or ''Yoreme'' Indians, who live in the South of the [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Mexican state|state]] of [[Sonora]] and in the North of the neighboring state of [[Sinaloa]]. Under the [[Ley General de Derechos Lingüísticos de los Pueblos Indígenas|General Law of Linguistic Rights of the Indigenous Peoples]]"Law of Linguistic Rights, it is recognized as a "national language" along with 62 other indigenous languages and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] which all have the same validity in Mexico. The language is considered 'critically endangered' by UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/|title=UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in danger|website=www.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mayo language is partially intelligible with the [[Yaqui language]], and the division between the two languages is more political, from the historic division between the Yaqui and the Mayo peoples, than linguistic.

Programming in both Mayo and Yaqui is carried by the [[National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples|CDI]]'s radio station [[XEETCH]], broadcasting from [[Etchojoa, Sonora]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4019">'''Mortido''' is a term used in [[Freudian theory|Freudian]] [[psychoanalysis]] to refer to the energy of the [[death drive|death instinct]], formed on analogy to the term [[libido]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Rycroft, ''A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'' (London 1995) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the early 21st century, the term has been used more rarely, but still designates the destructive side of psychic energy.&lt;ref&gt;Jadran Mimica, ''Explorations in Psychoanalytic Ethnography'' (2007) p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins: Federn==

Mortido was introduced by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s pupil [[Paul Federn]] to cover the psychic energy of the death instinct, something left open by Freud himself:&lt;ref&gt;[[Salman Akhtar]], ''Comprehensive Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'' (2009) p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edoardo Weiss]] preferred  to use [[destrudo]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis'' (Middlesex 1976), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Providing what he saw as clinical proof of the reality of the death instinct in 1930, Federn reported on the self-destructive tendencies of severely melancholic patients as evidence of what he would later call inwardly-directed mortido.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Alexander et al, ''Psychoanalytic Pioneers'' (1995) p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Freud himself favoured neither term – mortido or destrudo. This worked against either of them gaining widespread popularity in the psychoanalytic literature.&lt;ref&gt;Akhtar, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eric Berne==
{{Main|Eric Berne}}
Eric Berne, who was a pupil of Federn's, made extensive use of the term mortido in his pre-[[transactional analysis]] study, ''The Mind in Action'' (1947). As he wrote in the Foreword to the third edition of 1967, "the historical events of the last thirty years...become much clearer by introducing Paul Federn's concept of mortido".&lt;ref&gt;Berne, ''A Layman's Guide'', p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; 

Berne saw mortido as activating such forces as hate and cruelty, blinding anger and social hostilities;&lt;ref&gt;Berne, ''A Layman's Guide'', p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; and considered that inwardly directed mortido underlay the phenomena of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and self-punishment, as well as their clinical exacerbations in the form of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] or melancholia.&lt;ref&gt;Berne, ''A Layman's Guide'' p. 95 and p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;

Berne saw sexual acts as gratifying mortido at the same time as libido; and recognised that on occasion the former becomes more important sexually than the latter, as in [[sadomasochism]] and destructive emotional relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Berne, ''A Layman's Guide'' p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

Berne's concern with the role of mortido in individuals and groups, social formations and nations, arguably continued throughout all his later writings.&lt;ref&gt;Petrushka Clarkson, ''Transactional Analysis Psychotherapy'' (1993) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laplanche and the death drive==

[[Jean Laplanche]] has explored repeatedly the question of mortido,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/destrudo Bernard Golse "Destrudo"]&lt;/ref&gt; and of how far a distinctive instinct of destruction can be identified in parallel to the forces of libido.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Laplanche/John Fletcher, ''Essays on Otherness'' (1999) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wider applications==

The importance for the individual of integrating mortido in their life, as opposed to [[Splitting (psychology)|splitting]] it off and disowning it, has been taken up by figures like [[Robert Bly]] in the men's movement.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Tudor, in B. J. Brother, ''Power and Partnership'' (1995) p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has also been applied in contemporary expositions of the [[Cabbala]].&lt;ref&gt;Z. B. S. Halevi, ''Introduction to the Cabbala'' (1991) p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="966">In [[telecommunications]], the '''Network Effectiveness Ratio (NER)''' measures the ability of a [[telecommunications network|network]] to deliver a call to the called terminal. Busy signals and other call failure due to user behaviour are counted as "successful call delivery" for NER calculation purposes. Unlike [[Answer/Seizure ratio|ASR]], NER excludes the effects of customer and terminal behaviour.  NER is a measure of network quality defined by the [[ITU]].&lt;ref&gt;ITU-T Recommendation E.425&lt;/ref&gt;


&lt;math&gt;NER = 100  \ \frac {Answered\ Calls \ + \ User\ Busy \ + \ Ring\ No\ Answer \ + \ Terminal\ Reject }{Seizures} &lt;/math&gt;

In general, the Network Effective Ratio is used to calculate the effectiveness of the internal interconnect routes.

'''Paite''' is a [[Kuki-Chin languages|Zomi-Chin language]] spoken by the [[Paite people]]. There are different Paite [[dialect]]s.  The language exhibits mutual intelligibility with the other languages of the region including [[Thadou language|Thadou]], [[Hmar language|Hmar]], [[Vaiphei language|Vaiphei]], [[Simte language|Simte]], [[Kom language (India)|Kom]], [[Gangte language|Gangte]] and other languages.&lt;ref name=Singh1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singh|first1=Chungkham Yashawanta|title=The linguistic situation in Manipur|journal=Linguistics of the Tibeto-Burman Area|date=1995|volume=18|issue=1|pages=129–134|url=http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/singh1995linguistic.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Paite literally means 'Go-people' and can be translated as 'Leavers' , 'Marchers' or 'simply the people who went.'

==Paite alphabet (Paite laimal)==
The alphabet is propounded by Shri T Vialphung in 1903 which is extract from the Roman alphabets and has 18 consonants and 6 vowels. Out of 18 consonant phomemes in Paite, 11 of them are glottal stops,  4 fricatives,  2 nasal and 1 lateral.

This version of the Paite alphabet is called 'Paite Laimal'. This alphabet is used since 1903 to till today.

==Sample text==
The following is a sample text in Paite of the Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:

{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
!Paite pau!!English
|-
|Mi tengteng zalena piang ihi ua, zahomna leh dikna tanvou ah kibangvek ihi. Sia leh pha theihna pilna neia siam ihihziakun imihingpihte tungah unauna lungsim feltak iputngai ahi. 
  
|All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience. Therefore, they should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.
|-
|}

There are two  major dialects of Paite in [[Manipur]], namely Lousau, Lamjang and Dapjar.&lt;ref name="Singh2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Naorem Saratchandra Singh|title=A Grammar of Paite|date=2006|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=978-8183240680|page=xviii|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=450Jzejep0AC&amp;pg=PR18&amp;dq=Paite+language+dialects&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiAwY-f8f_PAhWECcAKHZhUCEoQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Paite%20language%20dialects&amp;f=false|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grammar ==
Paite grammar is fairly complex because of a number of word modification and a bit complex noun structure.

=== Word order ===
Paite's declarative word structure is [[Object–subject–verb|Object]]-[[Object–subject–verb|subject]]-[[verb]].

{|class="wikitable"
|-
|Vasa&lt;br&gt;''bird''||ka&lt;br&gt;''I''||mù&lt;br&gt;''see||Vasa Ka mu&lt;br&gt;''I see a bird''
|-
|Sing&lt;br&gt;''firewood''||a&lt;br&gt;''he''||puá&lt;br&gt;''carries''||Sing a puá&lt;br&gt;''He carries wood''
|-
|}
But even if the word order and grammar isn't followed, sentences and phrases do not lose their meaning.

Example: "Lai a gelh", which means "He writes", can also be written as "Gelh a Lai" without losing its meaning.

Five prominent tones in Paite are rising (Tungkal)(á), rising-falling (Tungkal-niamkiak)(â)￼, falling (Niamkiak)(à), falling-rising (Niamkiak-tungkal)(ã), and flat/levelled (Pheipai)(ā). The number of tones varies with variations in region and dialect.

==Geographical distribution==
Paite is spoken mainly in the following locations (''Ethnologue'').

*[[Manipur]]: CCpur Bazar(Lamka Bazar), Khuga valley(Lamka phaizang), [[Churachandpur district]]
*[[Mizoram]]: 20 villages of Champhai subdivision, [[Aizawl district]]
*[[Tripura]]
*[[Assam]]
*[[Meghalaya]]
*[[Nagaland]]
*[[Chin State|ChinState]] , [[Myanmar]]
*Nor

The '''PoolParty Semantic Suite''' is a technology platform provided by the Semantic Web Company. The EU-based company belongs to the early pioneers of the Semantic Web movement ([https://www.w3.org/News/2005#entry-7525 Reference]). The software supports enterprises in knowledge management, data analytics and content organisation. The product uses standards-based technologies as defined by W3C, which prevents vendor lock-in ([https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/validation Reference]). Reference customers are among others [[Boehringer Ingelheim]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://de.slideshare.net/semwebcompany/aleksandar-kapisoda-the-semantic-approach-for-tracking-scientific-publications|title=Aleksandar Kapisoda: The semantic approach for tracking scientific publications|last=|first=|date=12 October 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Credit Suisse]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nolde.at/demo/poolparty/|title=POOLPARTY|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[European Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/semic/event/enterprise-semantics-use-cases-and-applications-webinar|title=Enterprise Semantics: Use Cases and Applications Webinar|last=Di Giacomo|first=Debora|date=November 21, 2012|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership|REEEP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20141128005071/en/Climate-Tagger-REEEP-Launches-Automatic-Tagging-Drupal#.ViDDchDhD-Q|title=Climate Tagger: REEEP Launches Automatic Tagging for Drupal CMS|last=Tkacik|first=John|date=28 November 2014|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wolters Kluwer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vocabulary.wolterskluwer.de/|title=Wolters Kluwer Thesauri|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[World Bank Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vocabulary.worldbank.org/thesaurus.html|title=WBG Thesaurus|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The PoolParty Semantic Suite is commercialising Semantic Web technologies. In 2009, the first release of the PoolParty Semantic Software entered the market. Since then, the product has evolved from a taxonomy management tool to a feature-rich semantic software platform that enables companies to deploy enterprise knowledge graphs to integrate structured and unstructured data. The product is developing fast due to a strong R&amp;D focus and is integral part of multiple EU research projects of the [[Horizon 2020]] initiative ( [http://aligned-project.eu/ Reference], [http://www.big-data-europe.eu/ Reference]).

== Product ==
The PoolParty Semantic Suite is a modular and flexible software package. It differentiates nine modules, which can be individually combined depending on the business challenge:
* [[Corporate taxonomy|Taxonomy &amp; Thesaurus Management]] 
* [[Text mining|Text Mining &amp; Entity Extraction]] 
* [[Ontology (information science)|Ontology Management]]
* [[Meta-data management|Concept Tagging]]
* [[Data integration|Data Integration]] 
* [[Linked data|Linked Data Management]] 
* [[Semantic search|Semantic Search]] 
* [[Recommender system|Recommender System]]
* [[Data analysis|Analytics &amp; Visualization]]
Content assets get semantically enriched and are put into context by being matched against a knowledge graph. This is the foundation for semantic applications as search or linked data portals.

== Technologies ==
PoolParty Semantic Suite is deploying Semantic Web technologies as promoted by W3C. The backbone of the information architecture is built by applying [[Simple Knowledge Organization System|SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System)]], [[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]] and [[Linked data|Linked Data principles]]. Any data processed within PoolParty is transformed into [[RDF query language|RDF graphs]] and can be queried with [[SPARQL]].

An essential advantage of this approach is that taxonomy projects developed in PoolParty can be linked with data from virtually any repository. Companies benefit from an automatic entity linking between resources from the graph-based semantic layer and knowledge assets from data repositories like document management systems.

Critics argue that the technology hasn't yet become mainstream as it is relative complex. As the demand and requirements for smarter enterprise applications are undamped, the Semantic Web technology stack becomes continuously more attractive to developers.

{{short description|The reconstructed proto-language of the Germanic branch of the Indo-European languages }}
{{PIE notice}}
[[File:Pre-roman iron age (map).PNG|right|upright=1.1|thumb|Map of the [[pre-Roman Iron Age in Northern Europe]] showing cultures associated with Proto-Germanic, {{circa}} 500&amp;nbsp;BC. The red shows the area of the preceding [[Nordic Bronze Age]] in [[Scandinavia]]; the  magenta-colored area towards the south represents the [[Jastorf culture]] of the [[North German Plain]].]]
'''Proto-Germanic''' (abbreviated '''PGmc'''; also called '''Common Germanic''') is the [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] [[proto-language]] of the [[Germanic languages|Germanic branch]] of the [[Indo-European languages]].

Proto-Germanic developed from pre-Proto-Germanic into three branches during the first half of the first millennium of the [[Common Era]]: [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]], [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]] and [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]], which however remained in [[language contact|contact]] over a considerable time, especially the [[Ingvaeonic languages]] (including [[History of English|English]]), which arose from West Germanic dialects and remained in continued contact with North Germanic.

A defining feature of Proto-Germanic is the completion of [[Grimm's law]], a set of sound changes that occurred between its status as a dialect of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] and its gradual divergence into a separate language. As it is probable that the development of this sound shift spanned a considerable time (several centuries), Proto-Germanic cannot adequately be reconstructed as a simple node in a [[tree model]] but rather represents a phase of development that may span close to a thousand years. The end of the Common Germanic period is reached with the beginning of the [[Migration Period]] in the fourth century.

The alternative term "[[Germanic parent language]]" may be used to include a larger scope of linguistic developments, spanning the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] and [[Pre-Roman Iron Age in Northern Europe]] (second to first millennia&amp;nbsp;BC) to include "Pre-Germanic" (PreGmc), "Early Proto Germanic" (EPGmc) and "Late Proto-Germanic" (LPGmc).&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. {{cite book |first=Leonard |last=Bloomfield |authorlink=Leonard Bloomfield |title=Language |publisher=The University of Chicago Press | location=Chicago and London |year=1984 | isbn=0-226-06067-5 |pages= 298–299}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Proto-Germanic refers only to the most recent reconstruction of the common ancestor of Germanic languages, the Germanic parent language refers to the entire journey that the dialect of Proto-Indo-European that would become Proto-Germanic underwent through the millennia.

The Proto-Germanic language is not directly attested by any coherent surviving texts; it has been [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] using the [[Comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method]]. Fragmentary direct attestation exists of (late) Common Germanic in early [[runic inscriptions]] (specifically the second-century AD [[Vimose inscriptions]] and the second-century BC [[Negau helmet]] inscription),&lt;ref name="Comrie"&gt;{{cite book|last=Comrie|first=Bernard (editor)|authorlink=Bernard Comrie |title=The World's Major Languages|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, New York|year=1987|isbn=0-19-506511-5|pages= 69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Roman Empire]] era transcriptions of individual words (notably in [[Tacitus]]' ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', {{circa}} 90&amp;nbsp;CE&lt;ref&gt;this includes common nouns such as ''framea'' "[[Migration Period spear]]", mythological characters such as ''[[Mannus]]'' and tribal names such as ''[[Ingaevones]]''&lt;/ref&gt;).

The Proto-Germanic language developed in southern Scandinavia (Denmark, south Sweden and southern Norway), the ''Urheimat'' (original home) of the Germanic tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Andrew |last=Bell-Fialkoll (Editor) |title=The Role of Migration in the History of the Eurasian Steppe: Sedentary Civilization v. "Barbarian" and Nomad |year=2000 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=0-312-21207-0 |page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that Indo-European speakers first arrived in southern Scandinavia with the [[Corded Ware culture]] in the mid-3rd millennium BC, developing into the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] cultures by the early 2nd millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kortlandt.nl/publications/art111e.pdf] Frederik Kortlandt: The spread of the Indo-Europeans, 1989 : "It is possible [...] that Germanic grew out of a later component of the Corded Ware horizon."&lt;/ref&gt; Proto-Germanic developed out of [[Germanic parent language|pre-Proto-Germanic]] during the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]] of Northern Europe. According to the [[Germanic substrate hypothesis]], it may be influenced by non-Indo-European cultures, such as the [[Funnelbeaker culture]], but the sound change in the Germanic languages known as [[Grimm's law]] points to a non-substratic development away from other branches of Indo-European.{{refn|group=note|It is open to debate whether the bearers of the [[Neolithic Europe|Neolithic]] [[Funnelbeaker culture]] or the [[Pitted Ware culture]] should also be considered Indo-European&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Penguin atlas of world history |first=Hermann |last=Kinder |author2=Werner Hilgemann |translator=Ernest A.

'Barbarian' and Nomad''], Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Does this suggest that Indo-European culture and language may have arrived at Scandinavia through these cultures? If so, which source says so?--&gt;}} Proto-Germanic itself was likely spoken after {{circa}} 500&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref&gt;Ringe (2006), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Proto-Norse]] from the 2nd century AD and later is still quite close to reconstructed Proto-Germanic, but other common innovations separating Germanic from [[Proto-Indo-European]] suggest a common history of pre-Proto-Germanic speakers throughout the [[Nordic Bronze Age]].

Early Germanic expansion in the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]] (5th to 1st centuries BC) placed Proto-Germanic speakers in contact with the [[Continental Celtic]] [[La Tène culture|La Tène horizon]].

A number of Celtic loanwords in Proto-Germanic have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;see, for example, Ringe, ''From Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic'', OUP (2006), 296.&lt;/ref&gt;
By the 1st century AD, Germanic expansion reached the [[Danube]] and the [[Upper Rhine]] in the south and the [[Germanic peoples]] first entered the [[Roman historians|historical record]]. At about the same time, extending east of the [[Vistula]] ([[Oksywie culture]], [[Przeworsk culture]]), Germanic speakers came into contact with early [[Slavs|Slavic]] cultures, as reflected in early Germanic [[Proto-Slavic borrowings#Slavic and Germanic|loans in Proto-Slavic]].

By the 3rd century, LPGmc speakers had expanded over significant distance, from the [[Rhine]] to the [[Dniepr]] spanning about {{cvt|1200|km|-2}}. The period marks the breakup of Late Proto-Germanic and the beginning of the (historiographically-recorded) [[Germanic migrations]]. The first coherent text recorded in a Germanic language is the [[Gothic Bible]], written in the later 4th century in the language of the [[Thervingi]] [[Gothic Christians]], who had escaped [[Gothic persecution of Christians|persecution]] by moving from Scythia to [[Moesia]] in 348.

The earliest available coherent texts (conveying complete sentences, including verbs) in [[Proto-Norse]] begin in c. 400 in [[runic inscriptions]] (such as the [[Tune Runestone]]). The delineation of Late Common Germanic from Proto-Norse at about that time is largely a matter of convention. Early West Germanic text is available from the 5th century, beginning with the [[Frankish language|Frankish]] [[Bergakker inscription]].

==Evolution==
The evolution of Proto-Germanic from its ancestral forms, beginning with its ancestor [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], began with the development of a separate common way of speech among some geographically nearby speakers of a prior language and ended with the dispersion of the proto-language speakers into distinct populations with mostly independent speech habits. Between the two points, many sound changes occurred.

===Theories of phylogeny===

====Solutions====
[[Phylogenetic tree|Phylogeny]] as applied to [[historical linguistics]] involves the evolutionary descent of languages. The phylogeny problem is the question of what specific tree, in the [[tree model]] of language evolution, best explains the paths of descent of all the members of a language family from a common language, or proto-language (at the root of the tree) to the attested languages (at the leaves of the tree). The [[Germanic languages]] form a tree with Proto-Germanic at its root that is a branch of the Indo-European tree, which in turn has [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] at its root. Borrowing of lexical items from contact languages makes the relative position of the Germanic branch within Indo-European less clear than the positions of the other branches of Indo-European. In the course of the development of historical linguistics, various solutions have been proposed, none certain and all debatable.

In the evolutionary history of a language family, philologists consider a genetic "tree model" appropriate only if communities do not remain in effective contact as their languages diverge. Early Indo-European had limited contact between distinct lineages, and, uniquely, the Germanic subfamily exhibited a less treelike behaviour, as some of its characteristics were acquired from neighbours early in its evolution rather than from its direct ancestors. The internal diversification of West Germanic developed in an especially non-treelike manner.&lt;ref&gt;

Proto-Germanic is generally agreed to have begun about 500&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ringe|2006|p=67}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Its hypothetical ancestor between the end of Proto-Indo-European and 500&amp;nbsp;BC is termed [[Germanic parent language|Pre-Proto-Germanic]]. Whether it is to be included under a wider meaning of Proto-Germanic is a matter of usage.

[[Winfred P. Lehmann]] regarded [[Jacob Grimm]]'s "First Germanic Sound Shift", or Grimm's law, and [[Verner's law]],&lt;ref&gt;Described in this and the linked articles, but see Kleinman.&lt;/ref&gt; (which pertained mainly to consonants and were considered for many decades to have generated Proto-Germanic) as pre-Proto-Germanic and held that the "upper boundary" was the fixing of the accent, or stress, on the root syllable of a word, typically on the first syllable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= W. P. |last= Lehmann |authorlink= Winfred P. Lehmann |title= A Definition of Proto-Germanic: A Study in the Chronological Delimitation of Languages |journal= Language |volume= 37 | number= 1 |date= January–March 1961 |pages= 67–74 |doi=10.2307/411250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proto-Indo-European had featured a moveable [[pitch-accent]] comprising "an alternation of high and low tones"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= William H. |last= Bennett |title= The Stress Patterns of Gothic |journal= PMLA | volume= 85 | number= 3 |date= May 1970 |pages= 463–472 |doi= 10.2307/1261448 |jstor= 1261448}} First page and abstract no charge.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as stress of position determined by a set of rules based on the lengths of a word's syllables.

The fixation of the stress led to sound changes in unstressed syllables. For Lehmann, the "lower boundary" was the dropping of final -a or -e in unstressed syllables; for example, post-PIE ''*wóyd-e'' &gt; Gothic ''wait'', "knows". Antonsen agreed with Lehmann about the upper boundary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= Elmer H. |last= Antonsen |title= On Defining Stages in Prehistoric German |journal= Language |volume= 41 | number= 1 |date= January–March 1965 |pages= 19–36 |doi= 10.2307/411849}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later found [[Runes|runic evidence]] that the -a was not dropped: ''ékwakraz … wraita'', "I, Wakraz, … wrote (this)". He says: "We must therefore search for a new lower boundary for Proto-Germanic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Elmer H. |last= Antonsen |title= Runes and Germanic Linguistics |publisher= Walter de Gruyter |year= 2002 |pages= 26–30 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=gvSi3JVNRFQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |isbn= 3-11-017462-6}} That presentation also summarizes Lehmann's view.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antonsen's own scheme divides Proto-Germanic into an early stage and a late stage. The early stage includes the stress fixation and resulting "spontaneous vowel-shifts" while the late stage is defined by ten complex rules governing changes of both vowels and consonants.&lt;ref&gt;Antonsen (2000) page 28 table 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phonological stages from Proto-Indo-European to end of Proto-Germanic===
{{See also|Germanic Parent Language}}
The following changes are known or presumed to have occurred in the history of Proto-Germanic in the wider sense from the end of Proto-Indo-European up to the point that Proto-Germanic began to break into mutually unintelligible dialects. The changes are listed roughly in chronological order, with changes that operate on the outcome of earlier ones appearing later in the list. The stages distinguished and the changes associated with each stage rely heavily on {{harvnb|Ringe|2006|loc=Chapter 3, "The development of Proto-Germanic"}}. Ringe in turn summarizes standard concepts and terminology.

====Pre-Proto-Germanic (Pre-PGmc)====
This stage began with the separation of a distinct speech, perhaps while it was still forming part of the Proto-Indo-European dialect continuum. It contained many innovations that were shared with other Indo-European branches to various degrees, probably through areal contacts, and mutual intelligibility with other dialects would have remained for some time. It was nevertheless on its own path, whether dialect or language.

====Early Proto-Germanic====
This stage began its evolution as a dialect of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] that had lost its laryngeals and had five long and six short vowels as well as one or two overlong vowels. The consonant system was still that of PIE minus palatovelars and laryngeals, but the loss of syllabic resonants already made the language markedly different from PIE proper. Mutual intelligibility might have still existed with other descendants of PIE, but it would have been strained, and the period marked the definitive break of Germanic from the other Indo-European languages and the beginning of Germanic proper, containing most of the sound changes that are now held to define this branch distinctively. This stage contained various consonant and vowel shifts, the loss of the contrastive accent inherited from PIE for a uniform accent on the first syllable of the word root, and the beginnings of the reduction of the resulting unstressed syllables.

====Late Proto-Germanic====
By this stage, Germanic had emerged as a distinctive branch and had undergone many of the sound changes that would make its later descendants recognisable as Germanic languages. It had shifted its consonant inventory from a system that was rich in plosives to one containing primarily fricatives, had lost the PIE mobile pitch accent for a predictable stress accent, and had merged two of its vowels. The stress accent had already begun to cause the erosion of unstressed syllables, which would continue in its descendants. The final stage of the language included the remaining development until the breakup into dialects and, most notably, featured the development of nasal vowels and the start of [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]], another characteristic Germanic feature.

===Lexical evidence in other language varieties===
Loans into Proto-Germanic from other (known) languages or from Proto-Germanic into other languages can be dated relative to each other by which Germanic sound laws have acted on them. Since the dates of borrowings and sound laws are not precisely known, it is not possible to use loans to establish absolute or calendar chronology.

====Loans from adjoining Indo-European groups====

Most loans from [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] appear to have been made before or during the [[Grimm's Law|Germanic Sound Shift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ringe|2006|p=296}}; {{cite journal | last=Lane | first=George S | title=The Germano-Celtic Vocabulary | journal=Language | year=1933 | volume=9 | pages=244–264 | doi=10.2307/409353}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, one specimen *''rīks'' 'ruler' was borrowed from Celtic *''rīxs'' 'king' (stem *''rīg-''), with ''g'' → ''k''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Calvert |last=Watkins |authorlink=Calvert Watkins |title=Appendix I: Indo-European Roots: reg- | encyclopedia=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is clearly not native because PIE *''ē'' → ''ī'' is typical of not Germanic but Celtic languages. Another is *''walhaz'' "foreigner; Celt" from the Celtic tribal name ''Volcae'' with ''k'' → ''h'' and ''o'' → ''a''. Other likely Celtic loans include *''ambahtaz'' 'servant', *''brunjǭ'' 'mailshirt', *''gīslaz'' 'hostage', *''īsarną'' 'iron', *''lēkijaz'' 'healer', *''laudą'' 'lead', *''Rīnaz'' 'Rhine', and *''tūnaz, tūną'' 'fortified enclosure'.&lt;ref&gt;The etymologies are to be found mainly in {{cite book | first=Dennis Howard | last=Green | title=Language and History in the Early Germanic World | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2000 | pages=149–164}} One is in {{harvnb|Ringe|2006|p=296}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These loans would likely have been borrowed during the Celtic [[Hallstatt Culture|Hallstatt]] and early [[La Tène culture|La Tène]] cultures when the Celts dominated central Europe, although the period spanned several centuries.

From [[East Iranian]] came *''hanapiz'' 'hemp' (compare [[Saka language|Khotanese]] ''kaṃhā'', [[Ossetic language|Ossetian]] ''gæn(æ)'' ‘flax’),&lt;ref&gt;Martin Schwartz, "Avestan Terms for the Sauma Plant", ''Haoma and Harmaline'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1989), 123.&lt;/ref&gt; *''humalaz'', ''humalǭ'' 'hops' (compare Osset ''xumællæg''), *''keppǭ'' ~ ''skēpą'' 'sheep' (compare Pers ''čapiš'' 'yearling kid'), *''kurtilaz'' 'tunic' (cf. Osset ''k&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;əræt'' 'shirt'), *''kutą'' 'cottage' (compare Pers ''kad'' 'house'), *''paidō'' 'cloak',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Orel|2003|loc=*paido-}}. That word gave Old English ''pād'', Old Saxon ''pēda'', Old High German ''pfeit'', Bavarian ''Pfoad'', Gothic ''paida'' 'coat'.&lt;/ref&gt; *''paþaz'' 'path' (compare [[Avestan]] ''pantā'', gen. ''pathō''), and *''wurstwa'' 'work' (compare Av ''vərəštuua'').&lt;ref&gt;The preceding etymologies come from {{harvnb|Orel|2003}}, which is arranged in alphabetic order by root.&lt;/ref&gt; The words could have been transmitted directly by the [[Scythian]]s from the [[Ukraine]] plain, groups of whom entered Central Europe via the Danube and created the [[Vekerzug Culture]] in the Carpathian Basin (6th to 5th centuries BC), or by later contact with Sarmatians, who followed the same route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Barry | last=Cunliffe | title=Europe Between the Oceans 9000 BC – AD 1000 | year=2008 | location=New Haven | publisher=Yale University Press | pages=303–7, 352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unsure is *''marhaz'' 'horse', which was either borrowed directly from [[Scytho-Sarmatian]] or through Celtic mediation.

====Loans into non-Germanic languages====
{{expand section|date=October 2017}}
Numerous loanwords believed to have been borrowed from Proto-Germanic are known in the non-Germanic languages spoken in areas adjacent to the Germanic languages.

The heaviest influence has been on the [[Finnic languages]], which have received hundreds of Proto-Germanic or pre-Proto-Germanic loanwords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1-first=A.D.|author1-last=Kylstra|author2-first=Sirkka-Liisa|author2-last=Hahmo|author3-first=Tette|author3-last=Hofstra|author4-first=Osmo|author4-last=Nikkilä|title=Lexikon der älteren germanischen Lehnwörter in den ostseefinnischen Sprachen|year=1991–2012|publisher=Rodopi|location=Amsterdam–Atlanta}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-first=Petri|author-last=Kallio|contribution=The Prehistoric Germanic Loanword Strata in Finnic|title=A Linguistic Map of Prehistoric Northern Europe|year=2012|publisher=[[Suomalais-Ugrilainen Seura]]|series=Suomalais-Ugrilaisen Seuran Toimituksia|issue=266|ISBN=978-952-5667-42-4|url=http://www.sgr.fi/sust/sust266/sust266_kallio.pdf|accessdate=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Well-known examples include PGmc *''druhtinaz'' 'warlord' (compare Finnish ''ruhtinas''), *''hrengaz'' (later *''hringaz'') 'ring' (compare Finn ''rengas'', Estonian ''rõngas''),&lt;ref name="ringe 2006"&gt;{{harvnb|Ringe|2006|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; *''kuningaz'' 'king' (compare Finn ''kuningas''),&lt;ref name="Comrie" /&gt; *''lambaz'' 'lamb' (compare Finn ''lammas''),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ringe|2006|p=278}}&lt;/ref&gt; *''lunaz'' 'ransom' (compare Finn ''lunnas'').&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Orel, ''A Handbook of Germanic Etymology'' (Leiden, Netherlands: Brill, 2003), 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

Loanwords into the [[Samic languages]], [[Baltic languages]] and [[Slavic languages]] are also known.

===Non-Indo-European substrate elements===
{{Main article|Germanic substrate hypothesis}}
The term [[substratum|substrate]] with reference to Proto-Germanic refers to lexical items and phonological elements that do not appear to be descended from Proto-Indo-European. The substrate theory postulates that the elements came from an earlier population that stayed amongst the Indo-Europeans and was influential enough to bring over some elements of its own language. The theory of a non-Indo-European substrate was first proposed by [[Sigmund Feist]], who estimated that about a third of all Proto-Germanic lexical items came from the substrate.{{refn|group=note|Feist was proposing the idea as early as 1913, but his classical paper on the subject is {{cite journal |first=Sigmund |last=Feist |authorlink=Sigmund Feist |title=The Origin of the Germanic Languages and the Europeanization of North Europe |journal=Language |year=1932 |volume=8 |pages= 245–254 |doi=10.2307/408831}} A brief biography and presentation of his ideas can be found in {{citation |first=Bernard |last=Mees | editor-first=Henning | editor-last=Andersen | contribution=Stratum and Shadow: The Indo-European West: Sigmund Feist |title=Language Contacts in Prehistory: Studies in Stratigraphy |year=2003 |publisher=John Benjamin Publishing Company |isbn=1-58811-379-5 |pages= 19–21}}}}

[[Theo Vennemann]] has hypothesized a [[Basque language|Basque]] substrate and a [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] superstrate in Germanic; however, his speculations, too, are generally rejected by specialists in the relevant fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cls.psu.edu/pubs/pubs/LINGUA1158.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140411204014/http://cls.psu.edu/pubs/pubs/LINGUA1158.pdf |archivedate=2014-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in Germanic etymology continues, and many Germanic words whose origins were previously unclear or controversial now have plausible explanations in terms of reconstructed Indo-European words and morphology. Thus, the proportion of Germanic words without any plausible etymological explanation has decreased over time. Estimates of that proportion are typically outdated or inflated, as many of these proposals were unknown when scholars were compiling lists of unexplained Germanic words.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

==Phonology==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Grimm's law]] --&gt;
{{hatnote|See also the [[#Phonological stages from Proto-Indo-European to end of Proto-Germanic|Phonological stages]] section above.}}

===Transcription===
The following conventions are used in this article for transcribing Proto-Germanic reconstructed forms:
* Voiced obstruents appear as ''b'', ''d'', ''g''; this does not imply any particular analysis of the underlying phonemes as plosives {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/ɡ/}} or fricatives {{IPA|/β/}}, {{IPA|/ð/}}, {{IPA|/ɣ/}}. In other literature, they may be written as [[grapheme]]s with a [[Bar (diacritic)|bar]] to produce ''[[B with stroke|ƀ]]'', ''[[D with stroke|đ]]'', ''[[ǥ]]''.
* Unvoiced fricatives appear as ''f'', ''þ'', ''h'' (perhaps {{IPA|/ɸ/}}, {{IPA|/θ/}}, {{IPA|/x/}}). {{IPA|/x/}} may have become {{IPA|/h/}} in certain positions at a later stage of Proto-Germanic itself. Similarly for {{IPA|/xʷ/}}, which later became {{IPA|/hʷ/}} or {{IPA|/ʍ/}} in some environments.
* Labiovelars appear as ''kw'', ''hw'', ''gw''; this does not imply any particular analysis as single sounds (e.g. {{IPA|/kʷ/}}, {{IPA|/xʷ/}}, {{IPA|/ɡʷ/}}) or clusters (e.g. {{IPA|/kw/}}, {{IPA|/xw/}}, {{IPA|/ɡw/}}).
* The yod sound appears as ''j'' {{IPA|/j/}}. Note that the normal convention for representing this sound in [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] is ''y''; the use of ''j'' does not imply any actual change in the pronunciation of the sound.
* Long vowels are denoted with a macron over the letter, e.g. ''ō''. When a distinction is necessary, {{IPA|/ɛː/}} and {{IPA|/eː/}} are transcribed as ''ē¹'' and ''ē²'' respectively. ''ē¹'' is sometimes transcribed as ''æ'' or ''ǣ'' instead, but this is not followed here.
* Overlong vowels appear with circumflexes, e.g. ''ô''. In other literature they are often denoted by a doubled macron, e.g. ''ō̄''.
* Nasal vowels are written here with an [[ogonek]], following Don Ringe's usage, e.g. ''ǫ̂'' {{IPA|/õːː/}}. Most commonly in literature, they are denoted simply by a following n. However, this can cause confusion between a word-final nasal vowel and a word-final regular vowel followed by {{IPA|/n/}}, a distinction which was phonemic. Tildes (''ã'', ''ĩ'', ''ũ''...) are also used in some sources.
* Diphthongs appear as ''ai'', ''au'', ''eu'', ''iu'', ''ōi'', ''ōu'' and perhaps ''ēi'', ''ēu''.&lt;ref&gt;On ''eu'' and ''iu'' see {{harvnb|Cercignani|1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when immediately followed by the corresponding semivowel, they appear as ''ajj, aww, eww, iww''. ''u'' is written as ''w'' when between a vowel and ''j''. This convention is based on the usage in {{harvnb|Ringe|2006}}.
* Long vowels followed by a non-high vowel were separate syllables and are written as such here, except for ''ī'', which is written ''ij'' in that case.

===Consonants===
The table below&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; lists the consonantal phonemes of Proto-Germanic classified by their reconstructed pronunciation. The slashes around the phonemes are omitted for clarity. When two phonemes appear in the same box, the first of each pair is voiceless, the second is voiced. Phones written in parentheses represent [[allophone]]s and are not independent phonemes. For descriptions of the sounds and definitions of the terms, follow the links on the headings.{{refn|group=note|While the details of the reconstructed pronunciation vary somewhat, this phonological system is generally agreed upon; for example, coronals are sometimes listed as [[Dental consonant|dentals]] and [[Alveolar consonant|alveolars]] while velars and labiovelars are sometimes combined under [[Dorsal consonant|dorsals]].}}

Notes:
# {{IPA|[ŋ]}} was an allophone of {{IPA|/n/}} before velar obstruents.
# {{IPA|[ŋʷ]}} was an allophone of {{IPA|/n/}} before labiovelar obstruents.
# {{IPA|[β]}}, {{IPA|[ð]}} and {{IPA|[ɣ]}} were allophones of {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} in certain positions (see below).
# The phoneme written as ''f'' was probably still realised as a bilabial fricative ({{IPA|/ɸ/}}) in Proto-Germanic. Evidence for this is the fact that in Gothic, word-final ''b'' (which medially represents a voiced fricative) devoices to ''f'' and also Old Norse spellings such as ''aptr'' {{IPA|[ɑɸtr]}}, where the letter ''p'' rather than the more usual ''f'' was used to denote the bilabial realisation before {{IPA|/t/}}.

====Grimm's and Verner's law====
{{Main article|Grimm's law|Verner's law}}
Grimm's law as applied to pre-proto-Germanic is a [[chain shift]] of the original Indo-European [[plosives]]. Verner's Law explains a category of exceptions to Grimm's Law, where a voiced fricative appears where Grimm's Law predicts a voiceless fricative. The discrepancy is conditioned by the placement of the original Indo-European word accent.

''p'', ''t'', and ''k'' did not undergo Grimm's law after a fricative (such as ''s'') or after other plosives (which were shifted to fricatives by the Germanic spirant law); for example, where Latin (with the original ''t'') has ''stella'' "star" and ''octō'' "eight", Middle Dutch has ''ster'' and ''acht'' (with unshifted ''t'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Colette M. |last=Van Kerckvoorde |title=An Introduction to Middle Dutch |publisher=Mouton de Gruyter | location=Berlin and New York |year=1993 |isbn=3-11-013535-3 |page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; This original ''t'' merged with the shifted ''t'' from the voiced consonant; that is, most of the instances of /t/ came from either the original /t/ or the shifted /t/.

(A similar shift on the consonant inventory of Proto-Germanic later generated [[High German]]. McMahon says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=April M. S. |last=McMahon |title=Understanding Language Change |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1994 |isbn=0-521-44665-1 |page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Grimm's and Verner's Laws&amp;nbsp;... together form the First Germanic Consonant Shift. A second, and chronologically later Second Germanic Consonant Shift&amp;nbsp;... affected only Proto-Germanic voiceless stops&amp;nbsp;... and split Germanic into two sets of dialects, [[Low German]] in the north&amp;nbsp;... and [[High German]] further south&amp;nbsp;...")&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Verner's law is usually reconstructed as following Grimm's law in time, and states that unvoiced fricatives: {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/ɸ/}}, {{IPA|/θ/}}, {{IPA|/x/}} are voiced when preceded by an unaccented syllable. The [[Accent (phonology)|accent]] at the time of the change was the one inherited from Proto-Indo-European, which was free and could occur on any syllable. For example, PIE {{PIE|*bʰréh₂tēr}} &gt; PGmc. *''brōþēr'' "brother" but PIE {{PIE|*meh₂tḗr}} &gt; PGmc. *''mōdēr'' "mother". The voicing of some {{IPA|/s/}} according to Verner's Law produced {{IPA|/z/}}, a new phoneme.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Sometime after Grimm's and Verner's law, Proto-Germanic lost its inherited contrastive accent, and all words became stressed on their root syllable. This was generally the first syllable unless a prefix was attached.

The loss of the Proto-Indo-European contrastive accent got rid of the conditioning environment for the consonant alternations created by Verner's law. Without this conditioning environment, the cause of the alternation was no longer obvious to native speakers. The alternations that had started as mere phonetic variants of sounds became increasingly grammatical in nature, leading to the grammatical alternations of sounds known as [[Grammatischer Wechsel]]. For a single word, the grammatical stem could display different consonants depending on its grammatical case or its tense. As a result of the complexity of this system, significant levelling of these sounds occurred throughout the Germanic period as well as in the later daughter languages. Already in Proto-Germanic, most alternations in nouns were leveled to have only one sound or the other consistently throughout all forms of a word, although some alternations were preserved, only to be levelled later in the daughters (but differently in each one). Alternations in noun and verb endings were also levelled, usually in favour of the voiced alternants in nouns, but a split remained in verbs where unsuffixed (strong) verbs received the voiced alternants while suffixed (weak) verbs had the voiceless alternants. Alternation between the present and past of strong verbs remained common and was not levelled in Proto-Germanic, and survives up to the present day in some Germanic languages.

====Allophones====
Some of the consonants that developed from the sound shifts are thought to have been pronounced in different ways (allophones) depending on the sounds around them. With regard to original {{IPA|/k/}} or {{IPA|/kʷ/}} Trask says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert Lawrence |last=Trask |title=The Dictionary of Historical and Comparative Linguistics |publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn | location=Chicago, London |year=2000 |isbn=1-57958-218-4 |page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The resulting {{IPA|/x/}} or {{IPA|/xʷ/}} were reduced to {{IPA|/h/}} and {{IPA|/hʷ/}} in word-initial position."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many of the consonants listed in the table could appear lengthened or prolonged under some circumstances, which is inferred from their appearing in some daughter languages as doubled [[grapheme|letters]]. This phenomenon is termed [[gemination]]. Kraehenmann says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Astrid |last=Kraehenmann |title=Quantity and Prosodic Asymmetries is Alemannic: Synchronic and Diachronic |publisher=Mouton de Gruyter |location=Berlin and New York |year=2003 |isbn=3-11-017680-7 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Then, Proto-Germanic already had long consonants … but they contrasted with short ones only word-medially. Moreover, they were not very frequent and occurred only intervocally almost exclusively after short vowels."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The voiced phonemes {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/ɡ/}} and {{IPA|/ɡʷ/}} are reconstructed with the pronunciation of stops in some environments and fricatives in others. The pattern of allophony is not completely clear, but generally is similar to the patterns of voiced obstruent allophones in languages such as Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ringe|2006|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The voiced fricatives of Verner's Law (see above), which only occurred in non-word-initial positions, merged with the fricative allophones of {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/ɡ/}} and {{IPA|/ɡʷ/}}. Older accounts tended to suggest that the sounds were originally fricatives and later "hardened" into stops in some circumstances. However, Ringe notes that this belief was largely due to theory-internal considerations of older phonological theories, and in modern theories it is equally possible that the allophony was present from the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ringe|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the three voiced phonemes {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} had a slightly different pattern of allophony from the others, but in general stops occurred in "strong" positions (word-initial and in clusters) while fricatives occurred in "weak" positions (post-vocalic). More specifically:
* Word-initial {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} were stops {{IPA|[b]}} and {{IPA|[d]}}.
* A good deal of evidence, however, indicates that word-initial {{IPA|/ɡ/}} was {{IPA|[ɣ]}}, subsequently developing to {{IPA|[ɡ]}} in a number of languages. This is clearest from developments in [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian]] and other [[Ingvaeonic languages]]. Modern Dutch still preserves the sound of {{IPA|[ɣ]}} in this position.
* Plosives appeared after [[homorganic]] nasal consonants: {{IPA|[mb]}}, {{IPA|[nd]}}, {{IPA|[ŋɡ]}}, {{IPA|[ŋʷɡʷ]}}. This was the only place where a voiced labiovelar {{IPA|[ɡʷ]}} could still occur.
* When geminate, they were pronounced as stops {{IPA|[bb]}}, {{IPA|[dd]}}, {{IPA|[ɡɡ]}}. This rule continued to apply at least into the early West Germanic languages, since the [[West Germanic gemination]] produced geminated plosives from earlier voiced fricatives.
* {{IPA|/d/}} was {{IPA|[d]}} after {{IPA|/l/}} or {{IPA|/z/}}. Evidence for {{IPA|/d/}} after {{IPA|/r/}} is conflicting: it appears as a plosive in Gothic ''waurd'' "word" (not *''waurþ'', with devoicing), but as a fricative in Old Norse ''orð''. {{IPA|/d/}} hardened to {{IPA|[d]}} in all positions in the [[West Germanic languages]].
* In other positions, fricatives occurred singly after vowels and diphthongs, and after non-nasal consonants in the case of {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}}.

====Labiovelars====

Numerous additional changes affected the labiovelar consonants.
# Even before the operation of [[Grimm's law]], they were reduced to plain velars next to {{IPA|/u/}} due to the [[boukólos rule]] of PIE. This rule continued to operate as a [[surface filter]], i.e. if a sound change generated a new environment in which a labiovelar occurred near a {{IPA|/u/}}, it was immediately converted to a plain velar. This caused certain alternations in verb paradigms, such as *''singwaną'' {{IPA|[siŋʷɡʷɑnɑ̃]}} ‘to sing’ versus *''sungun'' {{IPA|[suŋɡun]}} ‘they sang’. Apparently, this delabialization also occurred with labiovelars following {{IPA|/un/}}, showing that the language possessed a labial allophone {{IPA|[ŋʷ]}} as well. In this case the entire clusters {{IPA|[uŋʷxʷ]}}, {{IPA|[uŋʷkʷ]}} and {{IPA|[uŋʷgʷ]}} are delabialized to {{IPA|[uŋx]}}, {{IPA|[uŋk]}} and {{IPA|[uŋɡ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ringe|2006|pp=92, 215}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# After the operation of [[Verner's law]], various changes conspired to almost completely eliminate voiced labiovelars. Initially, {{IPA|[ɡʷʰ]}} became {{IPA|[b]}}, e.g. PIE *{{PIE|gʷʱédʱyeti}} &gt; PGmc. *''bidiþi'' ‘asks for’. The fricative variant {{IPA|[ɣʷ]}} (which occurred in most non-initial environments) usually became {{IPA|[w]}}, but sometimes instead turned into {{IPA|[ɣ]}}. The only environment in which a voiced labiovelar remained was after a nasal, e.g. in *''singwaną'' {{IPA|[ˈsiŋʷɡʷɑnɑ̃]}} ‘to sing’. These various changes often led to complex alternations, e.g. *''sehwaną'' {{IPA|[ˈsexʷɑnɑ̃]}} ‘to see’, *''sēgun'' {{IPA|[ˈsɛːɣun]}} ‘they saw’ (indicative), *''sēwīn'' {{IPA|[ˈsɛːwiːn]}} ‘they saw’ (subjunctive), which were reanalysed and regularised differently in the various daughter languages.

====Consonant gradation====
Kroonen (2011) posits a process of [[consonant mutation]] for Proto-Germanic, under the name ''consonant gradation''.&lt;ref&gt;Kroonen, Guus. 2011. ''The Proto-Germanic ''n-''stems : a study in diachronic morphophonology''. Amsterdam/New York.&lt;/ref&gt; (This is distinct from the consonant mutation processes occurring in the neighboring [[Samic languages|Samic]] and [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] languages, also known as [[consonant gradation]] since the 19th century.) The Proto-Germanic consonant gradation is not directly attested in any of the Germanic dialects, but may nevertheless be reconstructed on the basis of certain dialectal discrepancies in root of the ''n''-stems and the ''ōn''-verbs.

Diachronically, the rise of consonant gradation in Germanic can be explained by [[Kluge's law]], by which geminates arose from stops followed by a nasal in a stressed syllable. Since this sound law only operated in part of the paradigms of the ''n''-stems and ''ōn''-verbs, it gave rise to an alternation of geminated and non-geminated consonants. However, there has been controversy about the validity of this law, with some linguists preferring to explain the development of geminate consonants with the idea of "expressive gemination". The origin of the Germanic geminate consonants is currently a disputed part of historical linguistics with no clear consensus at present.

The reconstruction of ''grading'' paradigms in Proto-Germanic explains root alternations such as Old English ''steorra'' 'star' &lt; *''sterran-'' vs. Old Frisian ''stera'' 'id.' &lt; *''steran-'' and Norwegian (dial.) ''guva'' 'to swing' &lt; *''gubōn-'' vs. Middle High German ''gupfen'' 'id.' &lt; *''guppōn-'' as generalizations of the original allomorphy. In the cases concerned, this would imply reconstructing an ''n''-stem nom. *''sterō'', gen. *''sterraz'' &lt; PIE *''h₂stér-ōn'', *''h₂ster-n-ós'' and an ''ōn''-verb 3sg. *''guppōþi'', 3pl. *''gubunanþi'' &lt; *''gʱubʱ-néh₂-ti'', *''gʱubʱ-nh₂-énti''.

===Vowels===
Proto-Germanic had four short vowels,&lt;ref&gt;On ''i'' and ''e'' see {{harvnb|Cercignani|1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt; five or six long vowels, and at least one "overlong" or "trimoric" vowel. The exact phonetic quality of the vowels is uncertain.

Notes:

# {{IPA|/e/}} could not occur in unstressed syllables except before {{IPA|/r/}}, where it may have been lowered to {{IPA|/ɑ/}} already in late Proto-Germanic times.
# All nasal vowels except {{IPA|/ɑ̃ː/}} and {{IPA|/ũː/}} occurred word-finally. The long nasal vowels {{IPA|/ɑ̃ː/}}, {{IPA|/ĩː/}} and {{IPA|/ũː/}} occurred before {{IPA|/x/}}, and derived from earlier short vowels followed by {{IPA|/nx/}}.

PIE ''ə'', ''a'', ''o'' merged into PGmc ''a''; PIE ''ā'', ''ō'' merged into PGmc ''ō''. At the time of the merger, the vowels probably were {{IPA|[ɑ]}} and {{IPA|[ɑː]}}, or perhaps {{IPA|[ɒ]}} and {{IPA|[ɒː]}}. Their timbres then differentiated by raising (and perhaps rounding) the long vowel to {{IPA|[ɔː]}}{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}. It is known that the raising of ''ā'' to ''ō'' can not have occurred earlier than the earliest contact between Proto-Germanic speakers and the Romans. This can be verified by the fact that Latin ''Rōmānī'' later emerges in Gothic as ''Rumoneis'' (that is, ''Rūmōnīs''). It is explained by Ringe that at the time of borrowing, the vowel matching closest in sound to Latin ''ā'' was a Proto-Germanic ''ā''-like vowel (which later became ''ō''). And since Proto-Germanic therefore lacked a mid(-high) back vowel, the closest equivalent of Latin ''ō'' was Proto-Germanic ''ū'': ''Rōmānī'' &gt; *''Rūmānīz'' &gt; *''Rūmōnīz'' &gt; Gothic ''Rumoneis''.

A new ''ā'' was formed following the shift from ''ā'' to ''ō'' when intervocalic {{IPA|/j/}} was lost in ''-aja-'' sequences. It was a rare phoneme, and occurred only in a handful of words, the most notable being the verbs of the third weak class. The agent noun suffix *''-ārijaz'' (Modern English ''-er'') was likely borrowed from Latin around or shortly after this time.

====Diphthongs====
The following diphthongs are known to have existed in Proto-Germanic:
* Short: {{IPA|/ɑu/}}, {{IPA|/ɑi/}}, {{IPA|/eu/}}, {{IPA|/iu/}}
* Long: {{IPA|/ɔːu/}}, {{IPA|/ɔːi/}}, (possibly {{IPA|/ɛːu/}}, {{IPA|/ɛːi/}})

Note the change {{IPA|/e/}} &gt; {{IPA|/i/}} before {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/j/}} in the same or following syllable. This removed {{IPA|/ei/}} (which became {{IPA|/iː/}}) but created {{IPA|/iu/}} from earlier {{IPA|/eu/}}.

Diphthongs in Proto-Germanic can also be analysed as sequences of a vowel plus an approximant, as was the case in Proto-Indo-European. This explains why {{IPA|/j/}} was not lost in *''niwjaz'' ("new"); the second element of the diphthong ''iu'' was still underlyingly a consonant and therefore the conditioning environment for the loss was not met. This is also confirmed by the fact that later in the [[West Germanic gemination]], -''wj''- is geminated to -''wwj''- in parallel with the other consonants (except {{IPA|/r/}}).

====Overlong vowels====

Proto-Germanic had two overlong or trimoraic long vowels ''ô'' {{IPA|[ɔːː]}} and ''ê'' {{IPA|[ɛːː]}}, the latter mainly in adverbs (cf. *''hwadrê'' ‘whereto, whither’).&lt;ref name=ringe&gt;{{harvnb|Ringe|2006|p=295}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of the documented languages still include such vowels. Their reconstruction is due to the [[comparative method]], particularly as a way of explaining an otherwise unpredictable two-way split of reconstructed long ''ō'' in final syllables, which unexpectedly remained long in some morphemes but shows normal shortening in others.

Trimoraic vowels generally occurred at [[morpheme]] boundaries where a bimoraic long vowel and a short vowel in hiatus contracted, especially after the loss of an intervening [[Glottal consonants|laryngeal]] (-''VHV''-).&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin W. Fortson IV, ''Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction'', 2nd edn. (Chichester/Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell, 2010), 342.&lt;/ref&gt; One example, without a laryngeal, includes the class II weak verbs (''ō''-stems) where a -''j''- was lost between vowels, so that -''ōja'' → ''ōa'' → ''ô'' (cf. *''salbōjaną'' → *''salbôną'' → Gothic ''salbōn'' ‘to anoint’). However, the majority occurred in word-final syllables (inflectional endings) probably because in this position the vowel could not be resyllabified.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=T.A. | last=Hall | contribution=The Distribution of Trimoraic Syllables in German and English as Evidence for the Phonological Word | editor-first=T. A. | editor-last=Hall | editor2-first=Marzena | editor2-last=Rochoń | title=Investigations in Prosodic Phonology: The Role of the Foot and the Phonological Word | series=ZAS Papers in Linguistics 19 | year=2000 | publisher=ZAS, Zentrum für Allgemeine Sprachwissenschaft (ZAS) | location=Berlin | pages=41–90 | url=http://www.zas.gwz-berlin.de/fileadmin/material/ZASPiL_Volltexte/zp19/zaspil19-hall.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Germanic, like Balto-Slavic, lengthened bimoraic long vowels in absolute final position, perhaps to better conform to a word's [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] template; e.g., PGmc *''arô'' ‘eagle’ ← PIE *''{{PIE|h₃ér-ōn}}'' just as Lith ''akmuõ'' ‘stone’, OSl ''kamy'' ← *''aḱmō̃'' ← PIE *''{{PIE|h₂éḱ-mon}}''. Contrast:
* contraction after loss of laryngeal: gen.pl. *''wulfǫ̂'' "wolves'" ← *''wulfôn'' ← pre-Gmc *''wúlpōom'' ← PIE *''{{PIE|wĺ̥kʷoHom}}''; ō-stem nom.pl. *''-ôz'' ← pre-Gmc *''-āas'' ← PIE *''{{PIE|-eh₂es}}''.
* contraction of short vowels: a-stem nom.pl. *''wulfôz'' "wolves" ← PIE *''wĺ̥kʷoes''.

But vowels that were lengthened by laryngeals did not become overlong. Compare:
* ō-stem nom.sg. *''-ō'' ← *''-ā'' ← PIE *''{{PIE|-eh₂}}'';
* ō-stem acc.sg. *''-ǭ'' ← *''-ān'' ← *''-ām'' (by [[Stang's law]]) ← PIE *''{{PIE|-eh₂m}}'';
* ō-stem acc.pl. *''-ōz'' ← *''-āz'' ← *''-ās'' (by [[Stang's law]]) ← PIE *''{{PIE|-eh₂ns}}'';

Trimoraic vowels are distinguished from bimoraic vowels by their outcomes in attested Germanic languages: word-final trimoraic vowels remained long vowels while bimoraic vowels developed into short vowels. Older theories about the phenomenon claimed that long and overlong vowels were both long but differed in [[tone (linguistics)|tone]], i.e., ''ô'' and ''ê'' had a “circumflex” (rise-fall-rise) tone while ''ō'' and ''ē'' had an “acute” (rising) tone, much like the tones of modern Scandinavian languages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Anatoly | last=Liberman | title=Germanic Accentology | location=Minneapolis | publisher=University of Minnesota Press | year=1982 | page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baltic, and Ancient Greek, and asserted that this distinction was inherited from PIE. However, this view was abandoned since languages in general do not combine distinctive intonations on unstressed syllables with contrastive stress and vowel length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Julius | last=Purczinsky | title=Proto-Indo-European Circumflex Intonation or Bisyllabicity | journal=Word | volume=44 | issue=1 | year=1993 | page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern theories have reinterpreted overlong vowels as having superheavy syllable weight (three [[mora (linguistics)|moras]]) and therefore greater length than ordinary long vowels.

By the end of the Proto-Germanic period, word-final long vowels were shortened to short vowels. Following that, overlong vowels were shortened to regular long vowels in all positions, merging with originally long vowels except word-finally (because of the earlier shortening), so that they remained distinct in that position. This was a late dialectal development, because the end result was not the same in all Germanic languages: word-final ''ē'' shortened to ''a'' in East and West Germanic but to ''i'' in Old Norse, and word-final ''ō'' shortened to ''a'' in Gothic but to ''o'' (probably {{IPA|[o]}}) in early North and West Germanic, with a later raising to ''u'' (the 6th century [[Salic law]] still has ''malth'''o''''' in late Frankish).

The shortened overlong vowels in final position developed as regular long vowels from that point on, including the lowering of ''ē'' to ''ā'' in North and West Germanic. The monophthongization of unstressed ''au'' in Northwest Germanic produced a phoneme which merged with this new word-final long ''ō'', while the monophthongization of unstressed ''ai'' produced a new ''ē'' which did not merge with original ''ē'', but rather with ''ē₂'', as it was not lowered to ''ā''. This split, combined with the asymmetric development in West Germanic, with ''ē'' lowering but ''ō'' raising, points to an early difference in the articulation height of the two vowels that was not present in North Germanic. It could be seen as evidence that the lowering of ''ē'' to ''ā'' began in West Germanic at a time when final vowels were still long, and spread to North Germanic through the late Germanic dialect continuum, but only reaching the latter after the vowels had already been shortened.

====''ē₁'' and ''ē₂''====

''ē₂'' is uncertain as a phoneme and only reconstructed from a small number of words; it is posited by the comparative method because whereas all provable instances of inherited (PIE) *''ē'' (PGmc. *''ē₁'') are distributed in Gothic as ''ē'' and the other Germanic languages as *''ā'',&lt;ref&gt;But see {{harvnb|Cercignani|1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; all the Germanic languages agree on some occasions of ''ē'' (e.g., Goth/OE/ON ''hēr'' ‘here‘ ← late PGmc. *''hē₂r''). Gothic makes no orthographic and therefore presumably no phonetic distinction between ''ē₁'' and ''ē₂'', but the existence of two Proto-Germanic long ''e''-like phonemes is supported by the existence of two ''e''-like [[Elder Futhark]] runes, [[Ehwaz]] and [[Eihwaz]].

Krahe treats ''ē₂'' (secondary ''ē'') as identical with ''ī''. It probably continues PIE ''ēi'', and it may have been in the process of transition from a diphthong to a long simple vowel in the Proto-Germanic period. Lehmann lists the following origins for ''ē₂'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/books/piep09.html | work=Proto-Indo-European phonology | title=The Origin of PGmc. Long Close e | first=Winfred P. | last=Lehmann | location=Austin | publisher=Linguistics Research Center | year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''ēi'': Old High German ''fiara'', ''fera'' ‘ham’, Goth ''fera'' ‘side, flank’ ← PGmc *''fē₂rō'' ← *''pēi-s-eh₂'' ← PIE *''{{PIE|(s)peh₁i}}''-.
* ''ea'': The preterite of [[Germanic strong verb|class 7 strong verbs]] with ''ai'', ''al'' or ''an'' plus a consonant, or ''ē₁''; e.g. OHG ''erien'' ‘to plow’ ← *''arjanan'' vs. preterite ''iar'', ''ier'' ← *''e-ar-''&lt;ref name=Kroonen&gt;Guus Kroonen, ''Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Germanic'' (Leiden: Brill, 2013), xxiii-iv, 225.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''iz'', after loss of -''z'': OEng ''mēd'', OHG ''miata'' "reward" (vs. OEng ''meord'', Goth ''mizdō'') ← PGmc *''mē₂dō'' ← *''mizdō'' ← PIE *''{{PIE|misdʰ-eh₂}}''.
* Certain pronominal forms, e.g. OEng ''hēr'', OHG ''hiar'' ‘here’ ← PGmc *''hiar'', derivative of *''hi''- ‘this’ ← PIE *''{{PIE|ḱi-}}'' ‘this’&lt;ref name="Kroonen"/&gt;
* Words borrowed from Latin ''ē'' or ''e'' in the root syllable after a certain period (older loans also show ''ī'').

====Nasal vowels====

Proto-Germanic developed nasal vowels from two sources. The earlier and much more frequent source was word-final ''-n'' (from PIE ''-n'' or ''-m'') in unstressed syllables, which at first gave rise to short ''-ą'', ''-į'', ''-ų'', long ''-į̄'', ''-ę̄'', ''-ą̄'', and overlong ''-ę̂'', ''-ą̂''. ''-ę̄'' and ''-ę̂'' then merged into ''-ą̄'' and ''-ą̂'', which later developed into ''-ǭ'' and ''-ǫ̂''. Another source, developing only in late Proto-Germanic times, was in the sequences ''-inh-'', ''-anh-'', ''-unh-'', in which the nasal consonant lost its occlusion and was converted into lengthening and nasalisation of the preceding vowel, becoming ''-ą̄h-'', ''-į̄h-'', ''-ų̄h-'' (still written as ''-anh-'', ''-inh-'', ''-unh-'' in this article).

In many cases, the nasality was not contrastive and was merely present as an additional surface articulation. No Germanic language that preserves the word-final vowels has their nasality preserved. Word-final short nasal vowels do not show different reflexes compared to non-nasal vowels. However, the comparative method does require a three-way phonemic distinction between word-final ''*-ō'', ''*-ǭ'' and ''*-ōn'', which each has a distinct pattern of reflexes in the later Germanic languages:

{| class="wikitable"

| -e
|-
| -ōn
| -ōn
| -a, -u

| -an
|}

The distinct reflexes of nasal ''-ǭ'' versus non-nasal ''-ō'' are caused by the Northwest Germanic raising of final ''-ō'' {{IPA|/ɔː/}} to {{IPA|/oː/}}, which did not affect ''-ǭ''. When the vowels were shortened and denasalised, these two vowels no longer had the same place of articulation, and did not merge: ''-ō'' became {{IPA|/o/}} (later {{IPA|/u/}}) while ''-ǭ'' became {{IPA|/ɔ/}} (later {{IPA|/ɑ/}}). This allowed their reflexes to stay distinct.

The nasality of word-internal vowels (from ''-nh-'') was more stable, and survived into the early dialects intact.

Phonemic nasal vowels definitely occurred in [[Proto-Norse]] and [[Old Norse]]. They were preserved in Old Icelandic down to at least {{sm|a.d.}} 1125, the earliest possible time for the creation of the ''[[First Grammatical Treatise]]'', which documents nasal vowels. The PG nasal vowels from ''-nh-'' sequences were preserved in Old Icelandic as shown by examples given in the ''First Grammatical Treatise''. For example:
* ''há̇r'' "shark" &lt; ''*hą̄haz'' &lt; PG ''*hanhaz''
* ''ǿ̇ra'' "younger" &lt; ''*jų̄hizô'' &lt; PG ''*junhizô'' (cf. Gothic ''jūhiza'')
The phonemicity is evident from minimal pairs like ''ǿ̇ra'' "younger" vs. ''ǿra'' "vex" &lt; ''*wor-'', cognate with English ''weary''.&lt;ref&gt;Einar Haugen, "First Grammatical Treatise. The Earliest Germanic Phonology", ''Language'', 26:4 (Oct–Dec, 1950), pp. 4–64 (p. 33).&lt;/ref&gt; The inherited Proto-Germanic nasal vowels were joined in Old Norse by nasal vowels from other sources, e.g. loss of ''*n'' before ''s''. Modern [[Elfdalian]] still includes nasal vowels that directly derive from Old Norse, e.g. ''gą̊s'' "goose" &lt; Old Norse ''gás'' (presumably nasalized, although not so written); cf. German ''Gans'', showing the original consonant.

Similar surface (possibly phonemic) nasal/non-nasal contrasts occurred in the West Germanic languages down through Proto-Anglo-Frisian of {{sm|a.d.}} 400 or so. Proto-Germanic medial nasal vowels were inherited, but were joined by new nasal vowels resulting from the [[Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law]], which extended the loss of nasal consonants (only before ''-h-'' in Proto-Germanic) to all environments before a fricative (thus including ''-mf-'', ''-nþ-'' and ''-ns-'' as well). The contrast between nasal and non-nasal long vowels  is reflected in the differing output of nasalized long ''*ą̄'', which was raised to ''ō'' in Old English and Old Frisian whereas non-nasal ''*ā'' appeared as fronted ''ǣ''. Hence:
* English ''goose'', [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] ''goes'', [[North Frisian language|North Frisian]] ''goos'' &lt; Old English/Frisian ''gōs'' &lt; Anglo-Frisian ''*gą̄s'' &lt; Proto-Germanic {{wikt-lang|gem-pro|*gans}}
* En ''tooth'' &lt; Old English ''tōþ'', Old Frisian ''tōth'' &lt; Anglo-Frisian ''*tą̄þ'' &lt; Proto-Germanic {{wikt-lang|gem-pro|*tanþs}}
* En ''brought'', WFris ''brocht'' &lt; Old English ''brōhte'', Old Frisian ''brōchte'' &lt; Anglo-Frisian ''*brą̄htæ'' &lt; Proto-Germanic {{wikt-lang|gem-pro|*bringaną}}.

===Phonotactics===
Proto-Germanic allowed the following clusters in initial and medial position:
* Non-dental obstruent + ''l'': ''pl'', ''kl'', ''fl'', ''hl'', ''sl'', ''bl'', ''gl'', ''wl''
* Obstruent + ''r'': ''pr'', ''tr'', ''kr'', ''fr'', ''þr'', ''hr'', ''br'', ''dr'', ''gr'', ''wr''
* Non-labial obstruent + ''w'': ''tw'', ''dw'', ''kw'', ''þw'', ''hw'', ''sw''
* Velar + nasal, ''s'' + nasal: ''kn'', ''hn'', ''sm'', ''sn''

It allowed the following clusters in medial position only:
* ''tl''
* Liquid + ''w'': ''lw'', ''rw''
* Geminates: ''pp'', ''tt'', ''kk'', ''ss'', ''bb'', ''dd'', ''gg'', ''mm'', ''nn'', ''ll'', ''rr'', ''jj'', ''ww''
* Consonant + ''j'': ''pj'', ''tj'', ''kj'', ''fj'', ''þj'', ''hj'', ''zj'', ''bj'', ''dj'', ''gj'', ''mj'', ''nj'', ''lj'', ''rj'', ''wj''

It allowed the following clusters in medial and final position only:
* Fricative + obstruent: ''ft'', ''ht'', ''fs'', ''hs'', ''zd''
* Nasal + obstruent: ''mp'', ''mf'', ''ms'', ''mb'', ''nt'', ''nk'', ''nþ'', ''nh'', ''ns'', ''nd'', ''ng'' (however ''nh'' was simplified to ''h'', with nasalisation and lengthening of the previous vowel, in late Proto-Germanic)
* ''l'' + consonant: ''lp'', ''lt'', ''lk'', ''lf'', ''lþ'', ''lh'', ''ls'', ''lb'', ''ld'', ''lg'', ''lm''
* ''r'' + consonant: ''rp'', ''rt'', ''rk'', ''rf'', ''rþ'', ''rh'', ''rs'', ''rb'', ''rd'', ''rg'', ''rm'', ''rn''

The ''s'' + voiceless plosive clusters, ''sp'', ''st'', ''sk'', could appear in any position in a word.

===Later developments===
Due to the emergence of a word-initial stress accent, vowels in unstressed syllables were gradually reduced over time, beginning at the very end of the Proto-Germanic period and continuing into the history of the various dialects. Already in Proto-Germanic, word-final {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/ɑ/}} had been lost, and {{IPA|/e/}} had merged with {{IPA|/i/}} in unstressed syllables. Vowels in third syllables were also generally lost before dialect diversification began, such as final ''-i'' of some present tense verb endings, and in ''-maz'' and ''-miz'' of the dative plural ending and 1st person plural present of verbs.

Word-final short nasal vowels were however preserved longer, as is reflected [[Proto-Norse]] which still preserved word-final ''-ą'' (''horna'' on the [[Golden Horns of Gallehus|Gallehus horns]]), while the dative plural appears as ''-mz'' (''gestumz'' on the [[Stentoften Runestone]]). Somewhat greater reduction is found in [[Gothic language|Gothic]], which lost all final-syllable short vowels except ''u''. [[Old High German]] and [[Old English language|Old English]] initially preserved unstressed ''i'' and ''u'', but later lost them in long-stemmed words and then Old High German lost them in many short-stemmed ones as well, by analogy.

Old English shows indirect evidence that word-final ''-ą'' was preserved into the separate history of the language. This can be seen in the infinitive ending ''-an'' (&lt; *''aną'') and the strong past participle ending ''-en'' (&lt; *''-anaz''). Since the early Old English fronting of {{IPA|/ɑ/}} to {{IPA|/æ/}} did not occur in nasalized vowels or before back vowels, this created a vowel alternation because the nasality of the back vowel ''ą'' in the infinitive ending prevented the fronting of the preceding vowel: *''-aną'' &gt; *''-an'', but *''-anaz'' &gt; *''-ænæ'' &gt; *''-en''. Therefore, the [[Anglo-Frisian brightening]] must necessarily have occurred very early in the history of the Anglo-Frisian languages, before the loss of final ''-ą''.

The outcome of final vowels and combinations in the various daughters is shown in the table below:

Note that some Proto-Germanic endings have merged in all of the literary languages but are still distinct in runic [[Proto-Norse]], e.g. ''*-īz'' vs. ''*-ijaz'' (''þrijōz dohtrīz'' "three daughters" in the [[Tune stone]] vs. the name ''Holtijaz'' in the [[Golden Horns of Gallehus|Gallehus horns]]).

==Morphology==
{{main article|Proto-Germanic grammar}}
Reconstructions are tentative and multiple versions with varying degrees of difference exist. All reconstructed forms are marked with an asterisk (*).

It is often asserted that the Germanic languages have a highly reduced system of inflections as compared with [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]], or [[Sanskrit]]. Although this is true to some extent, it is probably due more to the late time of attestation of Germanic than to any inherent "simplicity" of the Germanic languages. As an example, there are less than 500 years between the Gothic Gospels of 360 and the Old High German Tatian of 830, yet Old High German, despite being the most archaic of the West Germanic languages, is missing a large number of archaic features present in Gothic, including dual and passive markings on verbs, reduplication in Class VII strong verb past tenses, the vocative case, and second-position ([[Wackernagel's Law]]) clitics. Many more archaic features may have been lost between the Proto-Germanic of 200&amp;nbsp;BC or so and the attested Gothic language. Furthermore, [[Proto-Romance]] and [[Middle Indic]] of the fourth century AD—contemporaneous with Gothic—were significantly simpler than [[Latin]] and [[Sanskrit]], respectively, and overall probably no more archaic than Gothic. In addition, some parts of the inflectional systems of [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]], and [[Sanskrit]] were innovations that were not present in Proto-Indo-European.

===General morphological features===
Proto-Germanic had six cases, three genders, three numbers, three moods (indicative, subjunctive (PIE optative), imperative), and two voices (active and passive (PIE middle)). This is quite similar to the state of Latin, Greek, and [[Middle Indo-Aryan languages|Middle Indic]] of {{circa}} AD&amp;nbsp;200.

Nouns and adjectives were declined in (at least) six cases: vocative, nominative, accusative, dative, instrumental, genitive. The locative case had merged into the dative case, and the ablative may have merged with either the genitive, dative or instrumental cases. However, sparse remnants of the earlier locative and ablative cases are visible in a few pronominal and adverbial forms. Pronouns were declined similarly, although without a separate vocative form. The instrumental and vocative can be reconstructed only in the singular; the instrumental survives only in the West Germanic languages, and the vocative only in Gothic.

Verbs and pronouns had three numbers: singular, [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]], and [[plural]]. Although the pronominal dual survived into all the oldest languages, the verbal dual survived only into Gothic, and the (presumed) nominal and adjectival dual forms were lost before the oldest records. As in the [[Italic languages#Morphology|Italic languages]], it may have been lost before Proto-Germanic became a different branch at all.

===Consonant and vowel alternations===
Several sound changes occurred in the history of Proto-Germanic that were triggered only in some environments but not in others. Some of these were grammaticalised while others were still triggered by phonetic rules and were partially allophonic or [[surface filter]]s.

Probably the most far-reaching alternation was between [*f, *þ, *s, *h, *hw] and [*b, *d, *z, *g, *gw], the voiceless and voiced fricatives, known as [[Grammatischer Wechsel]] and triggered by the earlier operation of Verner's law. It was found in various environments:
* In the person-and-number endings of verbs, which were voiceless in weak verbs and voiced in strong verbs.
* Between different grades of strong verbs. The voiceless alternants appeared in the present and past singular indicative, the voiced alternants in the remaining past tense forms.
* Between strong verbs (voiceless) and causative verbs derived from them (voiced).
* Between verbs and derived nouns.
* Between the singular and plural forms of some nouns.

Another form of alternation was triggered by the Germanic spirant law, which continued to operate into the separate history of the individual daughter languages. It is found in environments with suffixal -t, including:
* The second-person singular past ending *-t of strong verbs.
* The past tense of weak verbs with no vowel infix in the past tense.
* Nouns derived from verbs by means of the suffixes *-tiz, *-tuz, *-taz, which also possessed variants in -þ- and -d- when not following an obstruent.

An alternation not triggered by sound change was [[Sievers' law]], which caused alternation of suffixal -j- and -ij- depending on the length of the preceding part of the morpheme. If preceded within the same morpheme by only short vowel followed by a single consonant, -j- appeared. In all other cases, such as when preceded by a long vowel or diphthong, by two or more consonants, or by more than one syllable, -ij- appeared. The distinction between morphemes and words is important here, as the alternant -j- appeared also in words that contained a distinct suffix that in turn contained -j- in its second syllable. A notable example was the verb suffix *-atjaną, which retained -j- despite being preceded by two syllables in a fully formed word.

Related to the above was the alternation between -j- and -i-, and likewise between -ij- and -ī-. This was caused by the earlier loss of -j- before -i-, and appeared whenever an ending was attached to a verb or noun with an -(i)j- suffix (which were numerous). Similar, but much more rare, was an alternation between -aV- and -aiC- from the loss of -j- between two vowels, which appeared in the present subjunctive of verbs: *-aų &lt; *-ajų in the first person, *-ai- in the others. A combination of these two effects created an alternation between -ā- and -ai- found in class 3 weak verbs, with -ā- &lt; -aja- &lt; -əja- and -ai- &lt; -əi- &lt; -əji-.

I-mutation was the most important source of vowel alternation, and continued well into the history of the individual daughter languages (although it was either absent or not apparent in Gothic). In Proto-Germanic, only -e- was affected, which was raised by -i- or -j- in the following syllable. Examples are numerous:
* Verb endings beginning with -i-: present second and third person singular, third person plural.
* Noun endings beginning with -i- in u-stem nouns: dative singular, nominative and genitive plural.
* Causatives derived from strong verbs with a -j- suffix.
* Verbs derived from nouns with a -j- suffix.
* Nouns derived from verbs with a -j- suffix.
* Nouns and adjectives derived with a variety of suffixes including -il-, -iþō, -į̄, -iskaz, -ingaz.

===Nouns===
The system of nominal declensions was largely inherited from PIE. Primary nominal declensions were the stems in /a/, /ō/, /n/, /i/, and /u/. The first three were particularly important and served as the basis of adjectival declension; there was a tendency for nouns of all other classes to be drawn into them. The first two had variants in /ja/ and /wa/, and /jō/ and /wō/, respectively; originally, these were declined exactly like other nouns of the respective class, but later sound changes tended to distinguish these variants as their own subclasses. The /n/ nouns had various subclasses, including /ōn/ (masculine and feminine), /an/ (neuter), and /īn/ (feminine, mostly abstract nouns). There was also a smaller class of root nouns (ending in various consonants), nouns of relationship (ending in /er/), and neuter nouns in /z/ (this class was greatly expanded in [[German language|German]]). Present participles, and a few nouns, ended in /nd/. The neuter nouns of all classes differed from the masculines and feminines in their nominative and accusative endings, which were alike.

===Adjectives===
Adjectives agree with the noun they qualify in case, number, and gender. Adjectives evolved into strong and weak declensions, originally with indefinite and definite meaning, respectively. As a result of its definite meaning, the weak form came to be used in the daughter languages in conjunction with demonstratives and definite articles. The terms "strong" and "weak" are based on the later development of these declensions in languages such as [[German language|German]] and [[Old English language|Old English]], where the strong declensions have more distinct endings. In the proto-language, as in [[Gothic language|Gothic]], such terms have no relevance. The strong declension was based on a combination of the nominal /a/ and /ō/ stems with the PIE pronominal endings; the weak declension was based on the nominal /n/ declension.

===Determiners===
Proto-Germanic originally had two demonstratives (proximal *''hi-'' ‘this’, distal *''sa''/''sō''/''þat'' ‘that’) which could serve as both adjectives and pronouns, although the proximal was obsolescent in Gothic (e.g. Goth acc. ''hina'', dat. ''himma'', neut. ''hita'') and obsolete everywhere else. Ultimately, only the distal survived, evolved into the [[definite article]], and underlies the English determiners ''the'' and ''that''. In the North-West Germanic languages (but not in Gothic), a new proximal demonstrative ('this' as opposed to 'that') evolved by appending ''-si'' to the distal demonstrative (e.g. Runic Norse nom.sg. ''sa-si'', gen. ''þes-si'', dat. ''þeim-si''), with complex subsequent developments in the various daughter languages. The new demonstrative underlies the English determiners ''this'', ''these'' and ''those''. (Originally, ''these'', ''those'' were dialectal variants of the masculine plural of ''this''.)

===Verbs===
{{See also|Germanic verb|Germanic strong verb|Germanic weak verb}}

Proto-Germanic had only two tenses (past and present), compared to 5-7 in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], [[Latin]], [[Proto-Slavic]] and [[Sanskrit]]. Some of this difference is due to [[deflexion (linguistics)|deflexion]], featured by a loss of tenses present in Proto-Indo-European. For example, [[Donald Ringe]] assumes for Proto-Germanic an early loss of the PIE imperfect aspect (something that also occurred in most other branches), followed by merging of the aspectual categories present-aorist and the mood categories indicative-subjunctive. (This assumption allows him to account for cases where Proto-Germanic has present indicative verb forms that look like PIE aorist subjunctives.)

However, many of the tenses of the other languages (e.g. future, future perfect, pluperfect, Latin imperfect) are not cognate with each other and represent separate innovations in each language.  For example, the Greek future uses a ''-s-'' ending, apparently derived from a [[desiderative]] construction that in PIE was part of the system of [[derivational morphology]] (not the inflectional system); the Sanskrit future uses a ''-sy-'' ending, from a different desiderative verb construction and often with a different ablaut grade from Greek; while the Latin future uses endings derived either from the PIE subjunctive or from the PIE verb *{{IPA|/bʱuː/}} "to be".  Similarly, the Latin imperfect and pluperfect stem from Italic innovations and are not cognate with the corresponding Greek or Sanskrit forms; and while the Greek and Sanskrit pluperfect tenses appear cognate, there are no parallels in any other Indo-European languages, leading to the conclusion that this tense is either a shared Greek-Sanskrit innovation or separate, coincidental developments in the two languages. In this respect, Proto-Germanic can be said to be characterized by the failure to innovate new synthetic tenses as much as the loss of existing tenses. Later Germanic languages did innovate new tenses, derived through [[periphrastic]] constructions, with [[Modern English]] likely possessing the most elaborated tense system ("Yes, the house will still be being built a month from now"). On the other hand, even the past tense was later lost (or widely lost) in most High German dialects as well as in [[Afrikaans]].

Verbs in Proto-Germanic were divided into two main groups, called "[[Germanic strong verb|strong]]" and "[[Germanic weak verb|weak]]", according to the way the past tense is formed.  Strong verbs use [[ablaut]] (i.e. a different vowel in the stem) and/or [[reduplication]] (derived primarily from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] perfect), while weak verbs use a dental suffix (now generally held to be a reflex of the reduplicated imperfect of PIE *''dheH&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-'' originally "put", in Germanic "do").  Strong verbs were divided into seven main classes while weak verbs were divided into five main classes (although no attested language has more than four classes of weak verbs). Strong verbs generally have no suffix in the present tense, although some have a ''-j-'' suffix that is a direct continuation of the PIE ''-y-'' suffix, and a few have an ''-n-'' suffix or infix that continues the ''-n-'' infix of PIE.  Almost all weak verbs have a present-tense suffix, which varies from class to class.   An additional small, but very important, group of verbs formed their present tense from the PIE perfect (and their past tense like weak verbs); for this reason, they are known as [[preterite-present verb]]s.  All three of the previously mentioned groups of verbs—strong, weak and preterite-present—are derived from PIE thematic verbs; an additional very small group derives from PIE athematic verbs, and one verb ''*wiljaną'' "to want" forms its present indicative from the PIE [[optative]] mood.

Proto-Germanic verbs have three moods: indicative, subjunctive and imperative.  The subjunctive mood derives from the PIE [[optative]] mood.  Indicative and subjunctive moods are fully conjugated throughout the present and past, while the imperative mood existed only in the present tense and lacked first-person forms.  Proto-Germanic verbs have two voices, active and passive, the latter deriving from the PIE [[mediopassive]] voice.  The Proto-Germanic passive existed only in the present tense (an inherited feature, as the PIE perfect had no mediopassive).  On the evidence of Gothic—the only Germanic language with a reflex of the Proto-Germanic passive—the passive voice had a significantly reduced inflectional system, with a single form used for all persons of the dual and plural.  Note that, although [[Old Norse]] (like modern [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]) has an inflected mediopassive, it is not inherited from Proto-Germanic, but is an innovation formed by attaching the reflexive pronoun to the active voice.

Although most Proto-Germanic strong verbs are formed directly from a verbal root, weak verbs are generally derived from an existing noun, verb or adjective (so-called [[denominal verb|denominal]], [[deverbal]] and [[deadjectival]] verbs).  For example, a significant subclass of Class I weak verbs are (deverbal) [[causative verb]]s.  These are formed in a way that reflects a direct inheritance from the PIE causative class of verbs.  PIE causatives were formed by adding an accented suffix ''-éi̯e/éi̯o'' to the ''o''-grade of a non-derived verb.  In Proto-Germanic, causatives are formed by adding a suffix ''-j/ij-'' (the reflex of PIE ''-éi̯e/éi̯o'') to the past-tense ablaut (mostly with the reflex of PIE ''o''-grade) of a strong verb (the reflex of PIE non-derived verbs), with [[Verner's Law]] voicing applied (the reflex of the PIE accent on the ''-éi̯e/éi̯o'' suffix).  Examples:
* ''*bītaną'' (class 1) "to bite" → ''*baitijaną'' "to bridle, yoke, restrain", i.e. "to make bite down"
* ''*rīsaną'' (class 1) "to rise" → ''*raizijaną'' "to raise", i.e. "to cause to rise"
* ''*beuganą'' (class 2) "to bend" → ''*baugijaną'' "to bend (transitive)"
* ''*brinnaną'' (class 3) "to burn" → ''*brannijaną'' "to burn (transitive)"
* ''*frawerþaną'' (class 3) "to perish" → ''*frawardijaną'' "to destroy", i.e. "to cause to perish"
* ''*nesaną'' (class 5) "to survive" → ''*nazjaną'' "to save", i.e. "to cause to survive"
* ''*ligjaną'' (class 5) "to lie down" → ''*lagjaną'' "to lay", i.e. "to cause to lie down"
* ''*faraną'' (class 6) "to travel, go"  → ''*fōrijaną'' "to lead, bring", i.e. "to cause to go", ''*farjaną'' "to carry across", i.e. "to cause to travel" (an archaic instance of the ''o''-grade ablaut used despite the differing past-tense ablaut)
* ''*grētaną'' (class 7) "to weep" → ''*grōtijaną'' "to cause to weep"
* ''*lais'' (class 1, preterite-present) "(s)he knows"  → ''*laizijaną'' "to teach", i.e. "to cause to know"

As in other Indo-European languages, a verb in Proto-Germanic could have a [[preverb]] attached to it, modifying its meaning (cf. e.g. ''*fra-werþaną'' "to perish", derived from ''*werþaną'' "to become").  In Proto-Germanic, the preverb was still a [[clitic]] that could be separated from the verb (as also in Gothic, as shown by the behavior of second-position clitics, e.g. ''diz-uh-þan-sat'' "and then he seized", with clitics ''uh'' "and" and ''þan'' "then" interpolated into ''dis-sat'' "he seized") rather than a [[bound morpheme]] that is permanently attached to the verb.  At least in Gothic, preverbs could also be stacked one on top of the other (similar to [[Sanskrit]], different from [[Latin language|Latin]]), e.g. ''ga-ga-waírþjan'' "to reconcile".

An example verb: ''*nemaną'' "to take" (class 4 strong verb).

==Schleicher's PIE fable rendered into Proto-Germanic==
[[August Schleicher]] wrote a [[Schleicher's fable|fable]] in the PIE language he had just reconstructed, which though it has been updated a few times by others still bears his name. Below is a rendering of this fable into Proto-Germanic.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The first is a direct phonetic evolution of the PIE text. It does not take into account various idiomatic and grammatical shifts that occurred over the period. For example, the original text uses the imperfect tense, which disappeared in Proto-Germanic. The second version takes these differences into account, and is therefore closer to the language the Germanic people would have actually spoken.

''Proto-Germanic'', phonetic evolution from PIE only
:{{lang|gem-x-proto|Awiz ehwōz-uh: awiz, hwisi wullō ne est, spihi ehwanz, ainą kurų wagą wegandų, ainą-uh mekǭ burą, ainą-uh gumanų ahu berandų. Awiz nu ehwamaz wiuhi: hert agnutai mek, witandī ehwanz akandų gumanų. Ehwōz weuhą: hludi, awi! hert agnutai uns witundumaz: gumô, fadiz, wullǭ awją hwurniudi sibi warmą westrą. Awją-uh wullō ne isti. Þat hehluwaz awiz akrą buki.}}

''Proto-Germanic'', with contemporary grammar and vocabulary

Awiz-uh wullǭ ne habaiþi. Þat hauzidaz awiz akrą flauh.}}

''English''
:{{lang|en|The Sheep and the Horses: a sheep that had no wool saw horses, one pulling a heavy wagon, one carrying a big load, and one carrying a man quickly. The sheep said to the horses: "My heart pains me, seeing a man driving horses". The horses said: "Listen, sheep, our hearts pain us when we see this: a man, the master, makes the wool of the sheep into a warm garment for himself. And the sheep has no wool". Having heard this, the sheep fled into the plain.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4871">'''Rolf Nyboe Nettum''' (17 June 1919 – 20 January 2010) was a Norwegian literary historian.

He grew up at Sandviksåsen in [[Sandvika]], where he was a neighbor of polar explorer [[Otto Sverdrup]],&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news|title=Rolf Nyboe Nettum til minne|last=Vinje|first=Finn-Erik|authorlink=Finn-Erik Vinje|date=1 February 2010|work=[[Budstikka]]|page=30|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; until Sverdrup's death in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Liv Frøysaa|last=Moe|title=Homewood|url=https://www.baerum.kommune.no/organisasjonen/Plan-og-miljo/Natur--og-idrettsforvaltningen/Kulturvern/Manedens-kulturminne-2007/Manedens-kulturminne-januar-2007-Homewood/|publisher=Bærum municipality|date=28 May 2008|accessdate=11 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605131230/https://www.baerum.kommune.no/organisasjonen/Plan-og-miljo/Natur--og-idrettsforvaltningen/Kulturvern/Manedens-kulturminne-2007/Manedens-kulturminne-januar-2007-Homewood/|archivedate=5 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nettum attended upper secondary school at [[Stabekk]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He later became a student, but during the [[occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany]] (1940–1945) he was arrested on 30 November 1943, as a part of the general crackdown that followed the [[1943 University of Oslo fire|University of Oslo fire]]. He was imprisoned near [[Stavern]] before being transferred to [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] on 7 January 1944. He was later transferred to [[Sennheim concentration camp]], then back to Buchenwald before being released on 20 December 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buchenwaldforeningen.no/KZ-Buchenwald/beretninger.htm|title=Tidsvitner|date=Den norske Buchenwaldforeningen|language=Norwegian|accessdate=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated in literature in 1948. He was a guest lecturer at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1951 to 1953. He then moved back to Norway and was a literary critic in the newspaper ''[[Aftenposten]]'' from 1954 to 1964. In 1958 he was also hired at the [[University of Oslo]]. He remained here until his retirement in 1986, being a professor for the last years.&lt;ref name=ntb&gt;{{cite news|title=90 år 17. juni: Professor, dr. phil.

Nettum took the [[dr.philos.]] degree in 1970 on a thesis about [[Knut Hamsun]].&lt;ref name=ntb/&gt; He came to be cited as one of the central Hamsun researchers in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hamsun-adelen får så hatten passer|last=Wandrup|first=Fredrik|date=14 October 2004|work=[[Dagbladet]]|page=48|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most important releases are ''Hans E.

In 1970 Russian was spoken as the native language by 36% inhabitants, including 6% of total population who were not Russians, and fluently as a second language by 31% of inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.csb.gov.lv/en/statistics/statistics-by-theme/population/census/search-in-theme/188-results-all-union-population-census-1970-latvian|title=Results of all-union Population Census 1970 in Latvian SSR|date=February 25, 1970|publisher=[[Central Statistical Bureau of Latvia]]|accessdate=July 31, 2018|language=Latvian, Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 Russian was the native language to 42% of population, including 8% of non-Russians, and 39% spoke it fluently as a [[foreign language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.csb.gov.lv/en/statistics/statistics-by-theme/population/census/search-in-theme/190-results-all-union-population-and-housing-census|title=Results of the all-union Population and Housing Census 1989, Latvian SSR (demographic indicators)|date=May 7, 1990|publisher=[[Central Statistical Bureau of Latvia]]|accessdate=July 31, 2018|language=Latvian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 Russian was spoken natively by 37.5% of inhabitants and by 43.7% as the [[second language]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=129&amp;id=388 Latvijas iedzīvotāju valodu prasme]. [[Latvian State Language Center]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 census 37.2% reported Russian as the language they primarily speak at home.&lt;ref name="CSB"/&gt; A 2009 research "Language situation in Latvia" found that overall proficiency of Russian as the second language is decreasing as it is losing its popularity among the youth, especially in areas with very large [[Latvian language|Latvian]] majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://valoda.lv/en/wp-content/uploads/monitorings%20eng.pdf|title=Language situation in Latvia: 2004–2010|publisher=[[Latvian Language Agency]]|date=2012|ISBN=978-9984-815-81-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 18, 2012, Latvia held a [[Latvian constitutional referendum, 2012|constitutional referendum]] on whether to adopt Russian as a second official language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.cvk.lv/pub/public/28361.html/|title=Referendum on the Draft Law 'Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia'|publisher=Central Election Commission of Latvia|year=2012|accessdate=May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Central Election Commission, 74.8% voted against, 24.9% voted for and the voter turnout was 71.1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tn2012.cvk.lv/|title=Results of the referendum on the Draft Law 'Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia'|language=Latvian|publisher=Central Election Commission of Latvia|year=2012|accessdate=May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 17, 2016 National Electronic Mass Media Council sent a letter to the administration of [[Latvian Television]] calling it to provide a translation in the state-language if needed and not to exclude representatives from invited institutions for not speaking Russian after it received a [[complaint]] from a state institution whose representative was denied participation in the state-owned [[LTV7]] Russian-language talk show ''Tochki nad i'' for wanting to speak in Latvian on the basis that "it's not technically possible to provide a translation during the broadcast, because extra resources would be required."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://neplpadome.lv/lv/sakums/padome/padomes-sedes/sedes-sadalas/neplp-aicina-ltv-risinat-situaciju-ar-valodu-lietojumu.html |title=National Electronic Mass Media Council calls LTV to resolve the situation with the use of language |date=October 17, 2016 |publisher=National Electronic Mass Media Council |accessdate=September 6, 2018 |language=Latvian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2018 ''Tochki nad i'' host Oleg Ignatiev informed [[National Alliance (Latvia)|National Alliance]] he would not allow Latvian being spoken by the party's representative on the upcoming show's episode on education in minority languages. National Alliance warned it would file a complaint to the National Electronic Mass Media Council. Soon after Ignatiev resigned saying:&lt;ref name="Mače"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mače |first=Zane |url=https://eng.lsm.lv/article/society/society/journalist-quits-following-russian-language-row.a291347/ |title=Journalist quits following Russian language row |date=September 6, 2018 |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting of Latvia]] |accessdate=September 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Greek alphabet typefaces, especially historically, have been a closer simulation of handwriting.

==Styles==
{{see also|Samples of script typefaces}}
Script typefaces are organized into highly regular formal types similar to [[cursive]] writing and looser, more casual scripts.
=== Formal scripts ===
A majority of formal scripts are based upon the letterforms of seventeenth and eighteenth century writing-masters like [[George Bickham the Elder|George Bickham]], George Shelley and George Snell. The letters in their original form are generated by a quill or metal nib of a pen. Both are able to create fine and thick strokes. Typefaces based upon their style of writing appear late in the eighteenth century and early nineteenth century. Contemporary revivals of formal script faces can be seen in [[Kuenstler Script]] and [[Matthew Carter]]'s typeface Snell Roundhand. These typefaces are frequently used for invitations and diplomas to effect an elevated and elegant feeling. They may use [[typographic ligature]]s to have letters connect. 
=== Casual scripts ===
Casual scripts show a less formal, more active hand. The strokes may vary in width but often appear to have been created by wet brush rather than a pen nib. They appear in the early twentieth century and with the advent of photocomposition in the early-1950s their number rapidly increased. They were popularly used in advertising in [[Europe]] and [[North America]] into the 1970s. Examples of casual script types include [[Brush Script]], [[Kaufmann (script)|Kaufmann]] and [[Mistral (typeface)|Mistral]]. Some may be non-connecting. 
==Technology==
[[File:Gospel Estienne 1550.jpg|thumb|Claude Garamond's famous [[grecs du roi]] typeface, intended to mimic the handwriting of Cretan scribe [[Angelo Vergecio]]. To mimic his writing, many alternate characters are needed. While this style was once very popular in printing the [[Greek alphabet]], it is no longer used due to its complexity.]]
Script typefaces place particular demands on printing technology if the letters are intended to join up and vary like handwriting. A typeface intended to mimic handwriting, such as [[Claude Garamond]]'s [[grecs du roi]] typeface, will require many [[Stylistic alternate|alternate characters]]. In digital type these (once drawn) can be substituted seamlessly through contextual [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] insertion in applications like InDesign, but this was complicated in metal. Another complexity in metal type was that [[Sort (typesetting)|sorts]] had to have delicate overhanging parts to interlock. This required careful design and casting for the sorts to fit together without gaps or the sorts breaking, or leaving gaps to be filled in by the natural spread of ink on paper.&lt;ref name="Venus Motorroller"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hardwig|first1=Florian|title=Venus Motorroller|url=http://fontsinuse.com/uses/7735/venus-motorroller|website=Fonts in Use|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Korbmacher-Verein Kranichfeld invoice, 1939"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hardwig|first1=Florian|title=Korbmacher-Verein Kranichfeld invoice, 1939|url=http://fontsinuse.com/uses/8596/korbmacher-verein-kranichfeld-invoice-1939|website=Fonts in Use|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Script typefaces have evolved rapidly in the second half of the 20th century due to developments in technology and the end of widespread use of metal type. Historically, most signwriting on logos, displays and shop frontages did not use fonts but was rather [[Lettering|custom-designed lettering]] created by signpainters and engravers.&lt;ref name="Not a font"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simonson|first1=Mark|author-link=Mark Simonson|title=Not a font|url=http://www.marksimonson.com/notebook/view/not-a-font|website=Mark Simonson Studio (blog)|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lettering is not type"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coles|first1=Stephen|title=Lettering is not type|url=https://fontbureau.typenetwork.com/news/article/clear-definitions|website=Type Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="English Vernacular"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mosley|first1=James|authorlink1=James Mosley|title=English Vernacular|url=http://typefoundry.blogspot.co.uk/2006/02/english-vernacular.html|website=Typefoundry (blog)|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Golden Age of Hand Lettering in American Advertising"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shinn|first1=Nick|title=The Golden Age of Hand Lettering in American Advertising|url=http://typeculture.com/academic-resource/articles-essays/the-golden-age-of-hand-lettering-in-american-advertising/|website=Type Culture|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[phototypesetting]] and then computers have made printing text at a range of sizes far easier than in the metal type period, it has become increasingly common for businesses to use type for logos and signs rather than hand-drawn lettering. In addition, phototypesetting made [[Kerning|overlap of characters]] relatively simple, something very complicated to achieve in metal type. [[Matthew Carter]] has cited his 1966 Snell Roundhand typeface as deliberately designed to replicate a [[Round hand|style of calligraphy]] hard to simulate in metal.&lt;ref name="ADC Hall of Fame: Matthew Carter"&gt;{{cite web|title=ADC Hall of Fame: Matthew Carter|url=http://adcglobal.org/hall-of-fame/matthew-carter/|publisher=ADC|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="snell roundhand Lawson1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander S.

Godine Publisher|isbn=978-0-87923-333-4|pages=360–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional development enabling more sophisticated script fonts has been the release of the [[OpenType]] format, which most fonts are now released in. This allows fonts to have a large character set, increasing the sophistication of design possible, and contextual insertion, in which characters that match one another are inserted into a document automatically, so fonts can convincingly mimic handwriting without the user having to choose the correct substitute characters manually.&lt;ref name="Lettercentric: Type as Writing"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shaw|first1=Paul|title=Lettercentric: Type as Writing|url=http://www.printmag.com/article/lettercentric-type-as-writing/|website=Print|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern script typefaces emulate the styles of hand-drawn lettering from different historical periods.

==Unicode==
{{see|Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols}}
In [[Unicode]] there is a script Latin alphabet for [[List of mathematical symbols#Symbols based on Latin letters|mathematical use]], with both capital and small letters. Few fonts provide support for all 52 characters, and their presentations vary in style from [[roundhand]] to [[chancery hand]] and others.

'''Section 22''' of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'' is one of several sections of the ''Charter'' relating to the [[official language]]s of [[Canada]].  The official languages, under [[Section Sixteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 16]], are [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]].  Section 22 is specifically concerned with political rights relating to [[language]]s besides English and French.

==Text==
It reads,

{{cquote|22.  Nothing in sections 16 to 20 abrogates or derogates from any legal or customary right or privilege acquired or enjoyed either before or after the coming into force of this Charter with respect to any language that is not English or French.}}

==Function==
Section 22 ensures that political rights regarding the use of other languages besides English and French are not limited by the fact that English and French are the only languages recognized as being official by the other provisions of the ''Charter''.  The political rights regarding other languages may exist by virtue of [[statute]] or simply [[Custom (law)|custom]], and the rights may predate the ''Charter'' or may be created after its enactment in 1982.  As author [[Walter Tarnopolsky]] noted in 1982, the [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada]] were the most likely people, and perhaps the only people, to have customary language rights.&lt;ref&gt;Tarnopolsky, Walter S.  "The Equality Rights."  In ''The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms:  Commentary,'' eds. [[Walter S. Tarnopolsky]] and Gérard-A. Beaudoin (Toronto:  The Carswell Company Limited, 1982), 441.&lt;/ref&gt;  The section may allow other languages to become official languages in the future, and demonstrates that having constitutional law regarding languages does not mean the law is fixed forever.&lt;ref name="Bastarache"&gt;Bastarache, Michel, André Braen, Emmanuel Didier and Pierre Foucher, ''Language Rights in Canada'', ed. Michel Bastarache, trans. Translation Devinat et Associés, Ottawa, (Montréal, Québec: Éditions Yvon Blais, 1987), p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year, Professor André Tremblay wrote that section 22 would apply to "government services."  He also points out that the ''Charter'' offers no assurances that these language rights "will be provided indefinitely."&lt;ref&gt;Tremblay, André.  "The Language Rights."  In ''The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms:  Commentary,'' eds. [[Walter S. Tarnopolsky]] and Gérard-A. Beaudoin (Toronto:  The Carswell Company Limited, 1982), 465.&lt;/ref&gt;  If those rights are not constitutionalized, the government in question can presumably abolish them at any time.

Professor [[Leslie Green (philosopher)|Leslie Green]] has argued that section 22 also justifies the English and French language rights.  The rights regarding English and French in the ''Charter'' are special rights, which raises the question of whether such rights can be justified in a [[democracy]].  However, Green writes that the special rights can be justified if this "leaves speakers of other languages no worse off than they would have been" if the special rights for English and French did not exist.  Green points to section 22 as evidence that other languages are not harmed by the rights regarding English and French.  Indeed, the fact that the ''Charter'' allows for English and French to be used in the government does not harm other languages, because the numbers of English and French Canadians mean that those languages would be used in the government anyway.  Still, Green acknowledged that "tolerance" of languages besides English and French could be improved.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Leslie. "Are Language Rights Fundamental?" ''Osgoode Hall Law Journal'' vol. 25, no. 4, 1987, p. 665.&lt;/ref&gt;  Justice Bastarache and fellow-experts also relate section 22 to upholding Canadian [[multiculturalism]].&lt;ref name="Bastarache"/&gt;

==Education rights==
In 1982, Walter Tarnopolsky speculated that section 22, combined with [[Section Twenty-seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 27 of the Charter]], which provides for a [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] framework for Charter rights, could lead to the creation of new [[minority language]] [[education in Canada|education]] rights based on those in [[Section Twenty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 23 of the Charter]], but for language groups besides the English and French-speaking populations.  However, Tarnopolsky acknowledged that if any such rights are created, it would probably be done by elected governments, and not by the courts.&lt;ref&gt;Tarnopolsky, Walter S.  "The Equality Rights."  In ''The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms:  Commentary,'' eds. [[Walter S. Tarnopolsky]] and Gérard-A. Beaudoin (Toronto:  The Carswell Company Limited, 1982), 441-442.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parliament==
Writing in 1982, constitutional scholar [[Peter Hogg]] remarked that section 22 would apply to rights in a "particular area."&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Peter W. ''Canada Act 1982 Annotated.'' Toronto, Canada: The Carswell Company Limited, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, the governments of the [[Yukon]], the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]]  allow Aboriginal languages to be spoken in their legislatures.&lt;ref name="proceedings"&gt;[http://www.parl.gc.ca/38/1/parlbus/commbus/senate/com-e/rul2-e/03eva-e.htm?Language=E&amp;Parl=38&amp;Ses=1&amp;comm_id=89 Proceedings of the Standing Committee on Rules, Procedures and the Rights of Parliament- Meeting of June 1, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, debates regarding the use of different languages in the [[Parliament of Canada]] have involved discussion of section 22.  In June 2005, a committee of [[Senate of Canada|Senators]] discussed whether speaking [[Inuktitut]], an [[Inuit]] language, in Parliament would be [[constitution]]al.  Concerns were raised about section 133 of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' and sections 16 and [[Section Seventeen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|17]] of the ''Charter'', and how these sections only recognize English and French as the languages of Parliament.  It was in turn argued section 22 was "relevant" to this debate, and that this section stated that the other Charter rights could not diminish rights regarding Inuktitut.  Senator [[Serge Joyal]], in expressing concern that "12 Aboriginal languages will have disappeared" in the year 2020 "because people are not using them," argued that section 22 provided "a foundation in the Constitution" for a "principle" that could be invoked to guard against this.  This senator argued that aboriginal languages, by custom, should have rights as to their usage.&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8429">In [[Egyptology]], the '''Standard Theory''' or '''Polotskyan Theory''', sometimes abbreviated '''ST''', is an approach to the [[verb]]al [[syntax]] of the [[Egyptian language]] originally developed by [[Hans Jakob Polotsky]] in which Egyptian verb forms are regarded as variously [[adjective|adjectival]], [[substantive|substantival]], or [[adverbial]],&lt;ref name=Niccacci&gt;Niccacci, Alviero (2009) “Polotsky’s Contribution to the Egyptian Verb-System, with a Comparison to Biblical Hebrew” in ''Egyptian, Semitic and General Grammar: Studies in Memory of H. J. Polotsky'', pages 401–465&lt;/ref&gt; with the possibility of ‘transposing’ any given verb phrase into any of these three classes.&lt;ref&gt;Depuydt, Leo (1993) ''Conjunction, Contiguity, Contingency: On Relationships between Events in the Egyptian and Coptic Verbal Systems'', page xv et seq., quoting Polotsky, Hans Jakob (1987) “Grundlagen des Koptischen Satzbaus: Erste Hälfte” in ''American Studies in Papyrology'' 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Loprieno&gt;Loprieno, Antonio (1995) ''Ancient Egyptian: A Linguistic Introduction'', pages 8–10&lt;/ref&gt; This analysis rests on the basis of systematically applying substitutional rules for syntactic nodes, whereby certain verb phrases are seen to be syntactically converted into noun phrases or adverb phrases because of the possibility of substituting such phrases in place of the verb phrase.&lt;ref name=Loprieno/&gt; This approach was widely adopted in the mid-20th century but eventually fell out of favor starting in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=Loprieno/&gt;&lt;ref name=Allen&gt;Allen, James (2010) ''Middle Egyptian: An Introduction to the Language and Culture of Hieroglyphs'', second edition, pages 417–420&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Standard Theory has its roots in the study of [[Coptic language|Coptic]], where in 1944 [[Hans Jakob Polotsky]] published a study, ''Études de syntaxe copte'', showing that the Coptic ‘Second Tense’ was consistently used in emphatic sentences, while the ‘First Tense’ was used in non-emphatic sentences.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt; Polotsky extended this same finding to earlier Egyptian, showing that many uses of the ‘imperfective’ ''sḏm.f'' form of the Egyptian verb similarly corresponded to emphatic sentences,&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt; as did many uses of the ''sḏm.n.f'' form.&lt;ref name=Niccacci/&gt; In subsequent publications, Polotsky refined his observations into a new understanding of the Egyptian verbal system.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt; The Standard Theory reached a broader reception in the 1960s,&lt;ref name=Loprieno/&gt; with some, such as [[Alan Gardiner]], arguing against its conclusions.&lt;ref name=Niccacci/&gt; The theory was revised on a more linguistic basis during the 1970s, with further analyses using [[generative grammar]].&lt;ref name=Niccacci/&gt; In 1976, Polotsky published ''Les transpositions du verbe en égyptien classique'', his most complete treatment of the theory as it applied to classical Egyptian.&lt;ref name=Loprieno/&gt; Polotsky’s ideas gained widespread acceptance,&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt; and in 1983, Egyptologist [[Leo Depuydt]] first gave them the name of ‘Standard Theory’.&lt;ref name=Niccacci/&gt;

However, while scholars of Coptic and [[Late Egyptian]] firmly adopted Polotsky’s views, they eventually came to be questioned by scholars of [[Old Egyptian|Old]] and [[Middle Egyptian]].&lt;ref name=Niccacci/&gt; The consensus surrounding the Standard Theory began to crumble at the 1986 Crossroad Conference on Egyptian Grammar.&lt;ref name=Niccacci/&gt; Heated debate emerged by the subsequent Crossroad II and Crossroad III conferences.&lt;ref name=Niccacci/&gt; Papers directly challenging some of the core assumptions of the Standard Theory began to appear, as [[Mark Collier (Egyptologist)|Mark Collier]] and others cast doubt on the adverbial nature of certain verb forms.&lt;ref&gt;Collier, Mark (1990) “The Circumstantial ''sḏm(.f)''/''sḏm.n(.f)'' as Verbal Verb-Forms in Middle Egyptian” in ''The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology'', volume 76, pages 73–85&lt;/ref&gt;

As Egyptologists became increasingly aware of new developments in general linguistics and the idiosyncrasies of the Standard Theory in the 1980s, the theory was largely superseded by interpretations of Egyptian syntax in which verbal phrases often retain their full verbal character rather than undergoing ‘transpositions’ in almost all of their uses.&lt;ref name=Loprieno/&gt;&lt;ref name=Niccacci/&gt; More recent trends also pay greater attention to [[discourse]] phenomena and [[pragmatics]] in analyzing verb forms rather than following a narrowly structural approach.&lt;ref name=Loprieno/&gt;&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Niccacci/&gt; Though the name ‘Standard Theory’ is still commonly used, the theory itself has now largely fallen out of favor as modern Egyptologists have turned to these newer approaches, variously referred to as ‘verbalist’, ‘post-Polotskyan’, or the ‘Not-So-Standard Theory’.&lt;ref&gt;Schenkel, Wolfgang (2001) “GRAMMAR: Middle Egyptian” in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt'', volume 2, page 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Loprieno/&gt;&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt; Nonetheless, a few scholars have continued to defend the ideas of the Standard Theory against their detractors, and many of Polotsky’s discoveries remain widely accepted.&lt;ref name=Niccacci/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Satzinger, Helmut and Shisha-Halevy, Ariel (1999) “The Snark is Dead” in ''Lingua Aegyptia'' volume 6, pages 167–176&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==

While there are many variants and further developments of the Standard Theory, the core of the analysis remains Polotsky’s treatment of the Egyptian verbal system. Polotsky categorized the various forms of the classical Egyptian verb on the basis of their syntactic substitutability with other kinds of phrases.&lt;ref name=Loprieno/&gt; In so doing, he arrived at three basic categories under which most of the verb forms could be classified:&lt;ref name=Niccacci/&gt;

{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
Adjectival verb forms:
* Active participle
* Passive participle
* Relative form
{{col-break}}
Substantival verb forms:
* Emphatic ''sḏm.f''
* Emphatic ''sḏm.n.f''
* Infinitive
{{col-break}}
Adverbial verb forms:
* Circumstantial ''sḏm.f''
* Circumstantial ''sḏm.n.f''
* Circumstantial passive ''sḏmw.f''
* Stative
* ''[[wikt:ḥr|ḥr]]'' + infinitive
* ''[[wikt:m#Egyptian|m]]'' + infinitive
* ''[[wikt:r#Egyptian|r]]'' + infinitive
{{col-end}}

In Polotsky’s analysis, the common particles ''[[wikt:jw#Egyptian|jw]]'', ''[[wikt:wn.jn|wn.jn]]'', ''[[wikt:ꜥḥꜥ.n|ꜥḥꜥ.n]]'', and ''[[wikt:m#Egyptian|m]]'' (this last with an attached suffix pronoun, e.g. ''[[wikt:m#Egyptian|m]][[wikt:.k#Egyptian|.k]]'', ''[[wikt:m#Egyptian|m]][[wikt:.ṯn#Egyptian|.ṯn]]'', etc.) are seen as auxiliaries. Together with a following pronoun or noun, they form a substantival element that serves as the subject of a sentence, and they combine with following adverbial verb forms and constructions to form compound verb forms at the start of a syntactic sentence.&lt;ref name=Niccacci/&gt; These compound verb forms are considered ‘First Tense’ forms by analogy with the First Tense in Coptic grammar.&lt;ref name=Niccacci/&gt; The initial clause with a First Tense verb form can then be followed by either a string of coordinate clauses sharing the same auxiliary or by subordinate clauses with circumstantial or prospective verb forms.&lt;ref name=Niccacci/&gt;

Like the First Tense forms, the Second Tenses are also analyzed as consisting of a substantival element as the subject followed by an adverbial element as the predicate.&lt;ref name=Niccacci/&gt; However, in this case the main verb is not part of the adverbial element but the substantival element, as an emphatic (substantival) verb form with a following suffix pronoun or noun.&lt;ref name=Niccacci/&gt; The Second Tense serves to highlight or emphasize the adverbial element by demoting the verb from predicate to subject, nominalizing it.&lt;ref name=Niccacci/&gt;

Another type of sentence, the so-called balanced sentence, is analyzed as two successive substantival elements containing emphatic verb forms,&lt;ref name=Niccacci/&gt; and can thus be seen as a special case of the Egyptian nominal sentence.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt;

[[Image:Top ten US stripper well states.GIF|right|thumb|200px|The top ten US stripper well states.]]
A '''stripper well''' or '''marginal well''' is an oil or gas well that is nearing the end of its economically useful life. In the United States a "stripper" ''gas well'' is defined by the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission as one that produces {{convert|60000|cuft|m3}} or less of gas per day at its maximum flow rate; the [[Internal Revenue Service]], for tax purposes, uses a threshold of {{convert|90000|cuft|m3}} per day.
''Oil wells'' are generally classified as stripper wells when they produce 10&lt;ref name=mich/&gt;-15 barrels per day or less for any twelve-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nswa.us/custom/showpage.php?id=25 |title=Stripper Well Facts - National Stripper Well Association|publisher=|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economical importance==
In the United States in 2015, 11% of [[crude oil]] produced comes from a marginal oil well,&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt;&lt;ref name=fuse/&gt; and over 85 percent of the total number of U.S. oil wells are now classified as such. There are over 420,000 of these wells in the United States, and together they produce nearly {{convert|915000|oilbbl|m3}} of oil per day, 18 percent of U.S. production.

Additionally, as of 2006, there are more than 296,000 natural gas stripper wells in the lower 48 states. Together they account for over {{convert|1.7|Tcuft|m3}} of natural gas, or about 9 percent of the natural gas produced in the lower 48 states. Stripper wells are more common in older oil and gas producing regions, most notably in [[Appalachia]], [[Texas]] and [[Oklahoma]].

A stripper well may cost between $10 to $30 per barrel [[Operating cost|to operate]], averaging $2,000 per month.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/stripper-wells-are-wild-card-in-oil-rout-1441660049 |title=‘Strippers’ Pose Dilemma for Oil Industry |first=Nicole |last=Friedman|date=7 September 2015|work=WSJ|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fuse&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energyfuse.org/production-from-stripper-wells-at-risk-in-current-price-environment/ |title=The Fuse - Production From Stripper Wells at Risk in Current Price Environment|work=The Fuse|date=6 January 2016|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxation===
In Oklahoma, the regular tax rate is 7%, but may be 1% for marginal wells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oklahomawatch.org/2016/03/30/unprofitable-wells-now-a-big-tax-break/ |title=Unprofitable Wells Now a Big Tax Break|date=30 March 2016|work=Oklahoma Watch|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Michigan, stripper well tax is 4%.&lt;ref name=mich&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.michigan.gov/taxes/0,4676,7-238-43519_43545_65133-304806--,00.html |title=Taxes - Stripper Well/Marginal Property Information|publisher=|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other tax exemptions can be 15% of gross income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usenergyassets.net/tax-advantages/ |title=Tax Advantages - U.S. Energy Assets|publisher=|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/Tax/us-tax-taxes.pdf The Tax Magazine] ''[[Deloitte]]'', 6 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 tax credit for prices below $30/barrel was rarely in effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amarillo.com/news/latest-news/2016-03-17/small-well-producers-see-tax-relief-amid-oil-price-drop |title=Small-well producers see tax relief amid oil price drop|work=Amarillo Globe-News|date=17 March 2016|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://about.bgov.com/blog/theres-one-group-not-ready-to-ditch-the-donald-ethanol-producers/ |title=There’s one group not ready to ditch the Donald: ethanol producers|work=Bloomberg Government|date=17 May 2016|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premature abandonment==

Many of these wells are marginally economic and at risk of being prematurely abandoned.  When world oil prices were in the low tens in the late 1990s, the oil that flowed from marginal wells often cost more to produce than the price it brought on the market. From 1994 to 2006, approximately 177,000 marginal wells were plugged and abandoned, representing a number equal to 42 percent of all operating wells in 2006, costing the U.S. more than $3.8 billion in lost oil revenue at the EIA 2004 average world oil price.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

When marginal wells are prematurely abandoned, significant quantities of oil remain behind. In most instances, the remaining reserves are not easily accessible when oil prices subsequently rise again: when marginal fields are abandoned, the surface infrastructure – the pumps, piping, storage vessels, and other processing equipment – is removed and the lease forfeited.&lt;ref name=fuse/&gt; Since much of this equipment was probably installed over many years, replacing it over a short period should oil prices jump upward is cost prohibitive. Oil prices would have to rise beyond their historic highs and remain at elevated levels for many years before there would be sufficient economic justification to bring many marginal fields back into production.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}{{dubious|date=June 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5116">'''Tumkur Sunandamma''' ({{lang-kn|ಟಿ. ಸುನಂದಮ್ಮ}}, born [[Tumkur]], 1917 &amp;ndash; died [[Bangalore]], 27 January 2006) was an Indian writer and humorist in the [[Kannada]] language. She was a recipient of the Karnataka Sahitya Akademi Award.

==Early life==
Sunandamma was born in Tumkur, Mysore in 1917.&lt;ref name=Lal1992/&gt; She belonged to a distinguished family of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], her father T. Ramaiah being a senior civil servant.&lt;ref name=hinduobit&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Hindu|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/t-sunandamma-is-dead/article3246507.ece|title=T. Sunandamma is dead|date=January 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite social strictures against the education of girls at the time, she studied up to high school. The lone girl in her class, she outperformed the boys, leading to considerable pressure from their parents to have her removed from the school. She was married off at the age of 11.&lt;ref name=hindu2006&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Hindu|title=Grandmom of laughter|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/article3217066.ece|author=Bageshree S.|date=February 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Sunandamma began writing poetry for a children's magazine, ''Makkala pustaka'', while still a child. At the age of 25, her articles began to appear in the newly established humour magazine ''Koravanji'', receiving critical praise.&lt;ref name="Lal1992"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Mohan Lal|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: Sasay to Zorgot|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KnPoYxrRfc0C&amp;pg=PA4224|volume=V|year=1992|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-260-1221-3|page=4224}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hindu2006/&gt;

When she moved to [[Bangalore]], her observations of the middle-class lives of her neighbours, in particular the women of [[Basavangudi]], began to inform her writings.&lt;ref name="Joseph2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ammu Joseph|title=Storylines: Conversations with Women Writers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1t1jAAAAMAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Women's World India and Asmita Resource Centre for Women|page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were lauded as ''potent and pungent''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illustrated Weekly of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O3Y6AQAAIAAJ|volume=102|date=October 1981|publisher=Bennett, Coleman &amp; Company|page=37|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunandamma wrote radio plays for [[All India Radio]].&lt;ref name=hinduobit/&gt; Several of her works were adapted by others for the theatre. ''All's well'', an English reworking from a Kannada play by Sundar based on Sunandamma's short story ''Aadaddella Olithe…?'' was directed Pramod Shiggaon and presented in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Mid-Day|url=http://archive.mid-day.com/news/2008/oct/061008-alls-well-comedy-plays-ranga-shankara-theatre-reviews.htm|title=A happy couple and time pass|author=|date=October 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Heegadre hege?'' written by K. Y. Narayana Swamy and directed by Pramod Shiggaon, was performed in Bangalore in October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/199544/in-brief.html|newspaper=Deccan Herald|title=In Brief: Kannada play|date=October 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
In 1979, Sunandamma was elected the first president of the Karnataka Lekhakiyara Sangha (Karnataka Women Writers' Association).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Bangalore Mirror|url=http://www.bangaloremirror.com/entertainment/lounge/Sangha-for-the-women-writers/articleshow/25451931.cms|date=November 8, 2013|author=Prathibha Nandakumar|title=Sangha for the women writers}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received the [[Karnataka Sahitya Academy Award]] in 1981.&lt;ref name=Lal1992/&gt; In 2004, she was awarded the Anupama Prasasti, a literary award from the Karnataka Women Writers' Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Times of India|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Sunandamma-bags-award/articleshow/679449.cms|title=Sunandamma bags award|date=May 17, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tarlach Rua Mac Dónaill''', Irish poet, fl. early 18th century.

Tarlach Rua Mac Dónaill was from the townland of Derrylasky in the parish of [[Donaghmore, County Tyrone|Donaghmore]], [[County Tyrone]], and lived in the first half of the 18th century. He was the author of ''Seachrán Charn tSiadhail'', which became extremely popular in Gaelic Ulster. It survived in numerous oral traditions, two manuscripts, and versions run to over fifty seven verses of eight lines each. The original probably was no more than six. ''Seachrán Charn tSiadhail'' describes a young man attempting to impress a young girl with an account of all the professions he has held and all the places he has visited.

According to [[Aodh Mac Dónaill]], Tarlach Rua

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"... was shot at the age of 23 by a party of soldiers of [[Altmore]] barracks. A remarkable event happened at his death. The old man, his father, came to bring home the corpse of his son. He had an ash twig in his hand and while collecting his son's brains in his cap, he struck the twig in the ground, and forgetting all about it went away carrying his son's corpse. The twig budded and grew into a very large tree. In sixty years it covered a square perch."''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54561">{{Japanese writing}}
&lt;!-- Commented out as fairly useless until those approaches are explained --&gt;
&lt;!-- When a '''transcription into Japanese''' of foreign terms is needed, historically several approaches have been used. --&gt;
In contemporary [[Japanese writing system|Japanese writing]], foreign-language loanwords and foreign names are normally written in the [[katakana]] script, which is one component of the Japanese writing system. As far as possible, sounds in the source language are matched to the nearest sounds in the Japanese language, and the result is [[transcription (linguistics)|transcribed]] using standard katakana characters, each of which represents one syllable (strictly [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]]). For example, ''America'' is written アメリカ (''A-me-ri-ka''). To accommodate various foreign-language sounds not present in Japanese, a system of extended katakana has also developed to augment standard katakana.

Katakana, like the other Japanese kana, [[hiragana]], has a one-to-one correspondence between sounds and characters. Therefore, once the "Japanese sound" of a word is established, there is no ambiguity in its katakana spelling (unlike spelling in English, for example).

A much less common form of transcription, not covered in this article, uses [[kanji]] characters for their phonetic values. For information on this method see [[Ateji]].

==Practicalities of transcription==
===Word length===
Because Japanese is written with [[kanji]], the relative complexity of its characters means Japanese generally needs to be written larger than in English for legibility. Since Japanese characters encode one syllable at a time rather than one phoneme the amount of space taken tends to be the same, but challenges arise when Japanese encounters syllables and consonant clusters that the kana system isn't designed to handle. For example, the word [[smartphone]] is rendered in Japanese as スマートフォン (su-mā-to-fo-n). The syllable ''sma'' requires three characters to write down (スマー), which although the same amount as English, does not take up the same amount of horizontal space. Thus, the word is often shortened to スマホ.

===Syllable structure===
Since Japanese has few closed syllables, syllable-final consonants in the source language are often represented using the ''-u'' (or sometimes ''-o'' or ''-i'') kanas with implicitly silent vowels – though this vowel often is pronounced in Japanese – or the [[syllable coda]] is not represented at all. For example, the name ''Jim'' is written ジム (''Ji-mu''). A similar principle applies to consonant clusters; for example ''spring'' would be transcribed as スプリング (''su-pu-ri-n-gu'').

===Diphthongs===
Japanese has only five native vowel sounds, each a pure vowel ([[monophthong]]) with a long and short form, and some degree of approximation is necessary when representing vowels from, for example, [[English vowels|English]]. [[Diphthong]]s are represented by sequences of vowels, and pronounced with [[Hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]], as a sequence of discrete monophthongs, not a diphthong, as in ブラウン ''Bu-ra-u-n'' "Brown", ナイス ''na-i-su'' "nice", ディア ''di-a'' "dear/deer", レア ''re-a'' "rare". etc. The English spelling &lt;ore&gt; (phonologically /ɔː/ ([[Received Pronunciation|RP]]) or /ɔːr/ ([[General American|GA]])) is usually "diphthongized" as ''o-a'' in Japanese (e.g. コア ''ko-a'' "core"), possibly because it is also pronounced as a diphthong (/oə/) in some accents of English. The English /eɪ/ is transcribed to either ''e-e'' (エース ''e-e-su'' "ace") or ''e-i'' (スペイン ''Su-pe-i-n'' "Spain"); similarly, /əʊ/ is transcribed to either ''o-o'' (ショー ''sho-o'' "show") or ''o-u'' (シャドウ ''sha-do-u'' "shadow").

=== Phonemes ===
Japanese does not have separate ''l'' and ''r'' sounds, and ''l-'' is normally transcribed using the kana that are perceived as representing ''r-''. For example, ''London'' becomes ロンドン (''Ro-n-do-n''). Other sounds not present in Japanese may be converted to the nearest Japanese equivalent; for example, the name ''Smith'' is written スミス (''Su-mi-su''). Foreign sounds can be difficult to express in Japanese, resulting in spellings such as フルシチョフ ''Furushichofu'' ([[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]]), アリー・ハーメネイー ''Arī Hāmeneī'' ([[Ali Khamenei]]) and イツハク・パールマン ''Itsuhaku Pāruman'' or イツァーク・パールマン ''Itsāku Pāruman'' ([[Itzhak Perlman]]).

The English [[voiceless labialized velar approximant]] /hw/ (orthographically ''wh''), which is a distinct phoneme from /w/ in some varieties of English, can be transcribed as ''ho(w)-''. For example, ''White'' is ホワイト ''Howaito'', ''whale'' is ホエール ''hoēru''.

French /w/ is typically transcribed as ''u'', but the sequence /wa/ is as ''o-(w)a'' (e.g. ポアロ ''Po-a-ro'' "Poirot").

The English /ti(ː)/ and /tɪ/ is typically transcribed to チ ''chi'' (e.g. チーム ''chīmu'' "team"), but ティ ''ti'' is also used (ティア ''tia'' "tear"). The suffix ''-tic'' can be transcribed to either チック ''-chikku'' or ティック ''-tikku''. However, ''-ty'' is almost always transcribed to ティ(ー) ''-ti(i)'', not *チ(ー) *''-chi(i)'' (e.g. パーティー ''pātī'' "party", インフィニティ ''infiniti'' "infinity").

The English schwa /ə/ is variously "transcribed" to ''a'', ''e'', ''o'', depending on the English spelling (this is more of [[transliteration]] than it is transcription). For example, デュアル ''dyu-a-ru'' "dual", デュエル ''dyu-e-ru'' "duel", テスタメント ''Te-su-ta-me-n-to'' "Testament", ロンドン ''Ro-n-do-n'' "London". There are no definite rules when it comes to the schwa, however; e.g. ランダム ''ra-n-da-mu'' "random", オープン ''o-o-pu-n'' "open", ザ ''za'' "the". The British /ə/ which is equivalent to the North American /ɚ/ is transcribed to a(-a); e.g. コンピュータ(ー) ko-n-pyu-u-ta(-a) "computer", モーター ''mo-o-ta-a'' "motor". On the other hand, the French schwa is transcribed to ''u'' or ''o'' (e.g. ソムリエ ''so-mu-ri-e'' "sommelier", ド ''do'' "de") similarly to instances where there's a lack of vowels, and the German schwa is almost always transcribed to ''e'' (e.g. アルベルト ''A-ru-be-ru-to'' "Albert", ウンディーネ ''un-di-i-ne'' "undine").

Although the diphthong /au/ across languages is usually transcribed as アウ ''a-u'', local reading transcriptions of the same sequence from Mandarin, represented in both Wade–Giles and Pinyin as ''ao'' are represented as アオ ''a-o'' instead, again in more of a manner of transliteration based on these systems - e.g. マオ・ツォートン ''ma-o tso-o-to-n'' ([[Mao Zedong]]).

The English /æ/ is typically transcribed to ''a''; e.g. マン ''ma-n'' "man", チャネル ''cha-ne-ru'' "channel". The sequences /kæ/ and /ɡæ/ are sometimes transcribed to ''kya'' and ''gya'' respectively; e.g. キャンディ ''kyandi'' "candy", ギャラクシー ''gya-ra-ku-shi-i'' "galaxy".

The older English suffix ''-age'' /-ɪdʒ/ is always transcribed to ''-e-e-ji'' as if it were pronounced as /eɪdʒ/ as in "age" or "rage"; e.g. メッセージ ''me-s-se-e-ji'' "message", パッケージ ''pa-k-ke-e-ji'' "package". The more recent ''-age'' /-ɑːʒ/ is more "properly" transcribed to ''-a-a-ju''; e.g. ミラージュ ''mi-ra-a-ju'' "mirage". However, "garage" /gəˈrɑːʒ/ is more commonly transcribed to ガレージ ''ga-re-e-ji'' as it also has /ˈgærɪdʒ/ as an alternative pronunciation in [[British English]].

The phoneme /v/ in various languages is transcribed either to ''b'' or ''v'', although it is unknown whether there is such an equivalent phoneme /v/ in Japanese. For example, ベネチア ''Benechia'' / ヴェネツィア ''Ve-ne-tsi-a'' "Venezia" (Italian for "Venice"), オーバー ''o-o-ba-a'' "over", ラブ ''ra-bu'' / ラヴ ''ravu'' "love".

The German /v/ (orthographically ''w'') can be transcribed in several ways. In long-established words, it is generally ''w''. E.g.: ''Walküre'' "valkyrie" &gt; ワルキューレ ''wa-ru-kyu-u-re''. In newer transcriptions, it can also be ''v''. E.g.: ''Schwestern'' "sisters" &gt; シュヴェスタン ''shu-ve-su-tan''.

Although several English dictionaries (Oxford's, Cambridge's, Longman's, etc.) do not endorse the notion of [[Syllabic consonant|syllabic]] /m/, transcriptions into Japanese usually do; in other words, words with sequences /Cm/ (with C for "consonant") is transcribed as if /m/ is syllabic just like /n/ in "seven" (セブン ''sebun''), /l/ in "battle" (バトル ''batoru''). For example, リズム ''ri-zu-mu'' "rhythm", ファシズム ''fa-shi-zu-mu'' "fascism".

''Wa'' is usually written as ワ, although ウァ is sometimes used in transcriptions from Ancient Greek or Latin (e.g. ミネルウァ ''Mi-ne-ru-wa'' "Minerva").

French vowels are usually [[phoneme|phonemically]] transcribed, but non-phonemic [[French phonology#Stress|stress]]ed vowels (utterance-final) are sometimes also transcribed as long vowels. Compare the examples of メゾン ''me-zo-n'' "maison" and カレー ''ka-re-e'' "Calais", in which the same vowel /ɛ/ is transcribed as ''e'' and ''e-e'' depending on whether it is stressed or not. The French schwa is ignored altogether: words are usually transcribed as if there were no schwa at all. For example, the word "le" is transcribed as ル ''ru'', as is the single sound /l/ in "cheval" &gt; シュヴァル ''shuvaru''.

Although a syllable-final /n/ is typically transcribed using the moraic ン ''n'', ン is used in French to transcribe nasalized vowels, so French words with a final /n/ often use ヌ ''nu'' instead for distinction, e.g. マドレーヌ ''Ma-do-re-e-nu'' "Madeleine".

Plain short consonants may be transcribed as geminated consonants to reflect the [[Tenseness|laxness]] of the preceding vowel, although this is not universal and there are plenty of exceptions. For example: English ''kick'' is キック ''ki-k-ku'' and ''castle'' is キャッスル ''kya-s-su-ru'', but ''extra'' is エクストラ ''e-ku-su-to-ra'' and ''battle'' is バトル ''ba-to-ru''. This practice expands to almost all English [[obstruent]]s regardless of their [[Voice (phonetics)|voicing]] (/k/, /ɡ/, /s/, /z/, /f/, etc.), also to German/Scots /x/, occasionally to /n/ and /m/ (as pseudo-geminated consonant sequences /nn/ or /nm/). For example: English ''bag'' is バ(ッ)グ ''ba-(g)-gu''; English ''Anna'' is アンナ ''A-n-na''; English ''gamma'' is ガンマ ''ga-n-ma''; English ''shuffle'' is シャッフル ''sha-f-fu-ru''; German ''Mach'' is マッハ ''ma-h-ha'', ''Masoch'' is マゾッホ ''Ma-zo-h-ho''.

German [x] is transcribed roughly as ''h-h'', accordingly to its preceding vowel, if it's not followed by a vowel (e.g. マッハ ''ma-h-ha'' "Mach", バッハ ''Ba-h-ha'' "Bach", マゾッホ ''Ma-zo-h-ho'' "Masoch"); [ç], its allophone occurring only after high vowels and consonants, are as ''h'' if not followed by a vowel (e.g. メルヘン ''me-ru-hen'' "Märchen"), or as ''hi'' if not (e.g. リヒター ''Ri-hi-ta-a'' "Richter"). Russian /x/ is transcribed as ''fu'' if not followed by a vowel (e.g. カザフスタン ''Ka-za-fu-su-ta-n'' "Kazakhstan"). Mandarin [ç] (in pinyin ''x(i)'') is transcribed as ''sh'' (e.g. シャオ ''shao'' from 小 ''xiǎo'' "little").

Geminated consonants are typically transcribed consistently and faithfully, as [[gemination]] is also featured in Japanese. The only notable exceptions are /rr/ and /ɲɲ/, although /ll/ and /ʎʎ/ are still transcribed. Examples: {{lang-ar|الله|translit=Allāh}} is アッラーフ ''A-r-ra-a-fu''; [[Italian language|Italian]] ''Donatello'' is ドナテッロ ''Do-na-te-r-ro''; Italian ''degli'' is デッリ ''de-r-ri''; but Italian ''Verrocchio'' is simply ヴェロッキオ ''Ve-ro-k-ki-o'', not *''Ve-r-ro-k-ki-o''. Italian /ɲɲ/ may be transcribed as the lengthened portion of the preceding vowel and a sequence of /nj/. For example, ''Sardegna'' is サルデーニャ ''Sa-ru-de-e-nya''.

Similar to the way speakers of English say Italian words, Japanese does not usually transcribe the Italian glide /j/ to reflect its true nature, but as /i/, perhaps for consistency and convenience. For example, ''Venezia'' is ヴェネツィア ''Ve-ne-tsi-a'', ''Sicilia'' is シチリア ''Shi-chi-ri-a''. Contemporary transcriptions of palatalized consonants from Slavic languages, however, are made using [[yōon]], e.g.: Russian ピャチゴルスク ''Pya-chi-go-ru-su-ku'' ([[Pyatigorsk]]), Polish ビェルスコ＝ビャワ ''Bye-ru-su-ko=bya-wa'' ([[Bielsko-Biała]]).

Modern English compounds are usually transcribed in a way that reflects the independent pronunciations of the individual components. That is to say, there is no phonetic linking between components. For example, "overall" is transcribed as オーバーオール ''o-o-ba-a-o-o-ru'', not *''o-o-ba-a-ro-o-ru'' as it is pronounced in English. However, there are a few exceptions, such as "pineapple", which is transcribed as パイナップル ''pa-i-na-p-pu-ru'', or "double-u", as ダブリュー ''da-bu-ryu-u''.

===Long vowels===
Long vowels are generally written with ー to indicate lengthening, as in コーラ ''kōra'' (cola), rather than writing a distinct vowel ×コウラ *''koura.'' There are two irregularities of note here. Firstly, lengthening of the final vowel may be ambiguous, and vary over time or between users. For example, in present Japan, "computer" is generally represented as コンピューター ''konpyūtā'' (long final), but in some cases, such as the computer industry, following [[Japanese Industrial Standards]], it is represented as コンピュータ ''konpyūta'' (short final).&lt;ref&gt;See [[:ja:コンピューター]]&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, in modern Chinese loanwords, notably food names, in careful transcription diphthongs are represented by separate vowels, even if in Japanese they would appear to be a long vowel; this is particularly common with ''òu,'' especially in 豆 ''dòu'' "(soy) bean", usually rendered as トウ. Further, long vowels in the Japanese transcription need not reflect Chinese pronunciation. For example, the dish 東坡肉 "[[Dongpo pork]]", in [[pinyin]] ''dōngpōròu'' (''dōng·pō·ròu''), is represented in Japanese as ドンポーロウ ''donpōrou,'' or more commonly トンポーロウ ''tonpōrou.'' Note that in Chinese pinyin ''ō'' represents a high tone, while in Japanese ''ō'' represents a long vowel, and /d/ is pronounced differently (Chinese /d/ is similar to Japanese or English /t/). This distinction is not always followed, and varies by term: the spelling トンポーロー ''tonpōrō'' is also common; and in terms such as 回鍋肉 [[twice cooked pork]], the spelling ホイコーロー is more common, despite representing diphthongs.

===Extended katakana===
In modern times, an extended katakana system has developed to cater for foreign sounds not present in Japanese. Most of these novel katakana forms are [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]], composed of standard katakana characters, but in digraph combinations not found in native words. For example, the word ''photo'' is transcribed as フォト (''fo-to''), where the novel digraph フォ (''fo'') is made up from フ (normally ''fu'') plus a novel small combining form of オ (normally ''o''). In other cases novel diacritics may be applied to create new sounds, such as ヴ for ''vu'', which consists of ウ (''u'') combined with a [[dakuten]] to indicate a [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] pronunciation.

===Interpunct===
Japanese is written without spaces between words, and, to aid understanding, foreign phrases and names are sometimes transliterated with an [[interpunct]] separating the words, called a {{nihongo|''nakaguro''|中黒||[[Interpunct#Japanese|middle dot]]}}; for example, {{nihongo2|ビル・ゲイツ}} ([[Bill Gates]]). When it is assumed that the reader knows the separate ''[[gairaigo]]'' words in the phrase, the middle dot is omitted, especially for [[wasei eigo]].  For example, the phrase {{nihongo2|コンピューターゲーム}} ''konpyūtā gēmu'' ("computer game") contains two well-known gairaigo, and therefore is not written with a middle dot; the same principle is applied for {{nihongo2|パンティストッキング}} ''panti sutokkingu'' ("pantyhose", lit. "panty stocking"), Japanese coinage.

==Katakana tables==
The following tables give the [[Hepburn romanization]] and an approximate [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] transcription for katakana as used in contemporary Japanese. Their use in transcription is, of course, in the inverse direction.

===Standard katakana===

'''Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer''' (18 June 1877 – 15 June 1949) (commonly known as ''' Ulloor''') was a [[Malayalam]] poet and historian. He was one of the [[triumvirate poets of modern Malayalam|triumvirate poets of]] [[Kerala]] in the first half of the 20th century, along with [[Kumaran Asan]] and [[Vallathol Narayana Menon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=This Ancient Lyre: Selected Poems|year=2005|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=8126017910|page=10|author=O. N. V. Kurup|editor=A. J. Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ulloor was born at the Thamarassery Illam at [[Perunna]], [[Changanassery]].&lt;ref name=Yentha/&gt; Since his ancestral home was at [[Ulloor]], he came to be known as ''Ulloor'' S. Parameswara Iyer.&lt;ref name=Yentha&gt;{{cite web|title=Statues Of Trivandrum: Mahakavi Ulloor S Parameswara Iyer|url=http://www.yentha.com/news/view/4/statues-of-trivandrum-mahakavi-ulloor-s-parameswara-iyer|website=Yentha.com|author=Mukesh|date=16 May 2012|accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father died when he was young and his mother raised him.&lt;ref name=Yentha/&gt; He graduated with [[Latin honors|Honors]] in [[Philosophy]] from Maharajas College and joined the Travancore State Services.&lt;ref name=Yentha/&gt; Later he took Degree in Law and [[Master's]] in [[Malayalam]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]].&lt;ref name=Yentha/&gt; He was later appointed as the income tax officer and then as the Chief Secretary.&lt;ref name=Yentha/&gt;

Ulloor published his [[mahakavya]] ''Umakeralam'' in 1914. Until then, only [[Pandalam Kerala Varma]]'s ''Rukmamgadacharitham'' was considered as a complete mahakavya in Malayalam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature|year=1988|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=8126011947|page=1185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poet [[K. Ayyappa Paniker]] has noted that ''Umakeralam'' is a "work of great devotion: devotion to the land, to the language, to a poetic tradition" Ulloor, like his contemporaries [[Kumaran Asan]] and [[Vallathol Narayana Menon]], also wrote a number of short narratives or ''khandakavyas'', of which the most famous are ''Karnabhooshanam'' and ''Pingala''. In the former he celebrates [[Karna]]'s infinite generosity and dedication to principles. In the latter he tries to portray the transformation of a courtesan overnight into a pious and refined character - almost a saint. Some of his other best known works were ''Bhakthideepika'', and ''Chithrasala''.&lt;ref name=Yentha/&gt; Uloor also wrote quite a large number of lyrics and shorter pieces, now available in various collections.

After Ulloor's death, the [[University of Kerala]] published one of his most noted works ''Kerala Sahitya Charithram'', which describes the history of Malayalam language, culture, and literature.&lt;ref name=Yentha/&gt; He studied ancient literature and palm leaf manuscripts to bring out old literary works such as ''Rama Charitham'' poem and ''Doothavakyam'' prose.&lt;ref name=Yentha/&gt;

==Legacy==
The [[India Posts|Indian Posts and Telegraph]] department released a [[commemorative stamp]] after Ulloor's death.&lt;ref name=Yentha /&gt;  A full size statue of Ulloor was unveiled by the [[President of India|Indian President]] [[Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy]] in [[Thiruvananthapuram]] on 15 May 1981.&lt;ref name=Yentha/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17530">Parliaments and legislative bodies around the world impose certain rules and standards during debates. Tradition has evolved that there are words or phrases that are deemed inappropriate for use in the legislature whilst it is in session. In a [[Westminster system]], this is called '''unparliamentary language''' and there are similar rules in other kinds of legislative systems. This includes, but is not limited to, the suggestion of dishonesty or the use of [[profanity]]. Most unacceptable is any insinuation that another [[Member of Parliament|member]] is [[Honour|dishonourable]]. So, for example, suggesting that another member is [[Lie|lying]] is forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oSYdxnZrzqUC|title=The Politics Today Companion to the British Constitution|author=Colin Pilkington|isbn=978-0-7190-5303-0|year=1999|pages=157–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exactly what constitutes unparliamentary language is generally left to the discretion of the [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker of the House]]. Part of the speaker's job is to enforce the assembly's debating rules, one of which is that members may not use "unparliamentary" language. That is, their words must not offend the dignity of the assembly. In addition, legislators in some places are protected from prosecution and civil actions by [[parliamentary immunity]] which generally stipulates that they cannot be sued or otherwise prosecuted for anything spoken in the legislature. Consequently they are expected to avoid using words or phrases that might be seen as abusing that immunity.

Like other rules that have changed with the times, speakers' rulings on unparliamentary language reflect the tastes of the period.

==Partial list, by country==

===Australia===
In the [[Australian Senate]], the words "liar" and "dumbo" were ordered to be withdrawn and deemed unparliamentary during a session in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/hansard/senate/dailys/ds160697.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605060847/http://www.aph.gov.au/hansard/senate/dailys/ds160697.pdf |archivedate=5 June 2011 |title=Senate Official Hansard: Thirty-eight parliament first session—fourth period |publisher=Parliament of Australia |date=16 June 1997 |page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium===
In Belgium there is no such thing as unparliamentary language. A member of parliament is allowed to say anything he or she wishes when inside parliament. This is considered necessary in Belgium to be able to speak of a democratic state and is a constitutional right. Nevertheless, on 27 March 2014, Laurent Louis, acting as an independent (not party-related), called the prime minister ([[Elio Di Rupo]]) a pedophile. The other members of parliament left the room in protest. This immunity that manifests itself in an absolute freedom of speech when in parliament does not exist when outside of parliament. In that case prosecution is possible when and if the majority of parliament decides so.

===Canada===
These are some of the words and phrases that speakers through the years have ruled "unparliamentary" in the [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] of [[Canada]], the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|Legislative Assembly]] of [[Alberta]], and the [[National Assembly of Quebec|National Assembly]] of [[Quebec|Québec]]:
* parliamentary pugilist (1875)
* a bag of wind (1878)

* coming into the world by accident (1886)
* blatherskite (1890)

The President of the [[Legislative Council (Hong Kong)|Legislative Council]] ordered out for using the following phrases:
* {{lang|zh|臭罌出臭草}} (foul grass grows out of a foul ditch), when referring to some of the members (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr96-97/english/lc_sitg/hansard/961113fe.doc |title=Official record of proceedings; Wednesday, 13 November 1996 |publisher=Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region |date=13 November 1996 |page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
In 2012, the [[Indian Parliament]] published a book of words and phrases that were considered to be unparliamentary:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vexnews.com/indian-press-amused-by-list-of-thousands-of-unparliamentary-phrases-and-words/ | title=Indian press amused by list of thousands of ‘unparliamentary’ phrases and words | work=VEXNEWS | date=January 1, 2012 | accessdate=February 15, 2017 | author=VEXNEWS}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* bad man
* badmashi
* bag of shit
* [[bandicoot]]
* communist
* double-minded
* [[goonda]]
* rat
* ringmaster
* scumbag

===Ireland===
In [[Dáil Éireann]], the lower house of the [[Oireachtas]] (Parliament) in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the [[Ceann Comhairle]] (chair) has ruled that it is disorderly for one [[Teachta Dála]] (deputy) to describe another as a:
*benny
*pair of bennies (in the case of two TDs)
*[[Spoiled child|brat]]
*[[buffoon]]
*[[wikt:chancer|chancer]]
*communist
*corner boy
*coward
*fascist
*[[wikt:gurrier|gurrier]]
*[[guttersnipe]]
*[[hypocrite]]
*rat
*[[wikt:scumbag|scumbag]]
*scurrilous speaker
*[[wikt:yahoo|yahoo]]

Or to insinuate that a TD is lying or drunk; or has violated the secrets of cabinet, or doctored an official report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Salient Rulings of the Chair|publisher=[[Dáil Éireann]]|location=Dublin|date=May 2002|edition=2nd
|pages=§408|nopp=Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the reference to "handbagging", particularly with reference to a female member of the House, has been deemed to be unparliamentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/1212/1224260596889.html |title=Dáil code: 'handbagging' not allowed |work=[[The Irish Times]] |date=12 December 2009 |accessdate=13 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025101110/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/1212/1224260596889.html |archivedate=25 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Dáil maintains a document, ''Salient Rulings of the Chair'' which covers behaviour in and out of the House by TDs; section 428 of this lists unparliamentary speech.&lt;ref name="gogarty_irishtimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/1214/1224260654123.html|title=Changes expected to Dáil code after use of 'f-word'|work=[[The Irish Times]]|date=14 December 2009|accessdate=15 December 2009|author=Marie O'Halloran}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gogarty_apology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/DDebate.aspx?F=DAL20091211.xml&amp;Node=H6#H6

In December 2009, [[Paul Gogarty]] apologised in advance for using "unparliamentary language" prior to shouting "fuck you!" at an opposition chief whip.&lt;ref name="gogarty_irishtimes"/&gt; This phrase was not one of those listed explicitly as inappropriate, prompting calls for a review.&lt;ref name="bbc_gogarty"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8413122.stm|title=Irish MP's F-word outburst sparks parliament review|work=[[BBC News]]|date=15 December 2009|accessdate=21 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seán Barrett (politician)|Seán Barrett]], [[Ceann Comhairle]] of the [[31st Dáil]] accused TDs of being like "gurriers shouting on a street at each other".

===Italy===

The use of foul language in Parliament produced jurisprudence by the constitutional court, which has implemented the libel suits.&lt;ref&gt;See Giampiero Buonomo, Lo scudo di cartone, Rubbettino Editore, 2015, p. 25 , {{ISBN|9788849844405}}; see also ((https://www.academia.edu/12695276/Autorecensione_02_dello_Scudo)).&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
The [[Parliament of New Zealand]] maintains a list of words, and particularly phrases, that the Speaker has ruled are unbecoming, insulting, or otherwise unparliamentary. These include:&lt;ref name="newzealand_parliament"&gt;[https://www.parliament.nz/en/visit-and-learn/history-and-buildings/special-topics/unparliamentary-language/ "Special topics: unparliamentary language"], Parliament of New Zealand website, dated 28 July 2006, retrieved 16 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
* idle vapourings of a mind diseased (1946)
* his brains could revolve inside a peanut shell for a thousand years without touching the sides (1949)
* energy of a tired snail returning home from a funeral (1963)

The Parliament also maintains a list of language that has been uttered in the House, and has been found not to be unparliamentary; this includes:
* commo (meaning [[communist]], 1969)
* scuttles for his political funk hole (1974)

===Norway===
In 2009, a member of the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]] was interrupted during question period by the Speaker for calling a minister a "[[highwayman|highway bandit]]".{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

===United Kingdom===
In the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]], the following words have been deemed unparliamentary over time:

In addition, accusations of 'crooked deals' or insinuation of the use of banned substances by a member are considered unparliamentary language (all attributable to [[Dennis Skinner]]).&lt;ref name="wsjskinner"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124533884172427813|title=Parliament Finally Sees Some Beauty in Britain's Beast of Bolsover |last=MacDonald|first=Alistair|date=19 June 2009|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=13 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An accusation that an MP's presence in the house has "been bought" is also unparliamentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=UK Parliament|title=Prime Minister's Questions: 21 February 2018|date=2018-02-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ubGDx03OK4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=26m22s|accessdate=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word 'dodgy' when used by [[Ed Miliband]], was not however, found to be unparliamentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2015-02-11d.769.0|title=TheyWorkForYou|website=www.theyworkforyou.com|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Northern Ireland====
The [[Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly]], [[William Hay, Baron Hay of Ballyore|William Hay MLA]], gave a ruling in the Chamber on 24 November 2009 on unparliamentary language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports2009/091124.htm#1 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613164222/http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/record/reports2009/091124.htm |archivedate=13 June 2011 |title=Official Report: Assembly Business - Speaker’s Ruling: Unparliamentary Language |publisher=Northern Ireland Assembly |date=24 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In essence rather than making judgements on the basis of particular words or phrases that have been ruled to be unparliamentary in the Assembly or elsewhere the Speaker said that he would judge Members' remarks against standards of courtesy, good temper and moderation which he considered to be the standards of parliamentary debate. He went on to say that in making his judgement he would consider the nature of Members' remarks and the context in which they were made. In 2013, Hay ruled that insinuation of MLAs being members of proscribed organizations was unparliamentary language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-25000852 | work=BBC News | title=Assembly Speaker William Hay says three MLAs 'used offensive remarks' | date=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wales====
In the [[National Assembly for Wales]] the [[Presiding Officer of the National Assembly for Wales|Presiding Officer]] has intervened when the term "lying" has been used. In December 2004, the Presiding Officer notably sent [[Leanne Wood]] out of the chamber for referring to [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as 'Mrs Windsor'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4060043.stm |title=AM expelled for 'Mrs Windsor' jibe |publisher=BBC News |date=1 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the USA, representatives were [[List of United States Representatives expelled, censured, or reprimanded|censured]] for using unparliamentary language in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] throughout its history. Other levels of government have similar disciplinary procedures dealing with inappropriate words spoken in the legislature.

==Avoiding unparliamentary language==
It is a point of pride among some British MPs to be able to insult their opponents in the House without use of unparliamentary language. Several MPs, notably Sir [[Winston Churchill]], have been considered masters of this game.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Some terms which have evaded the Speaker's rules are:

*[[Terminological inexactitude]] (lie)
*Being ''[[economical with the truth]]'' (lying by omission), since used on the floor of the house as an insult or taunt.
*[[Tired and emotional]], a euphemism for intoxicated

[[Clare Short]] implicitly accused the Employment minister [[Alan Clark]] of being drunk at the [[dispatch box]]  shortly after her election in 1983, but avoided using the word, saying that Clark was "incapable". Clark's colleagues on the Conservative benches in turn accused Short of using unparliamentary language and the Speaker asked her to withdraw her accusation. Clark later admitted in his diaries that Short had been correct in her assessment. In 1991, Speaker [[Bernard Weatherill]], adjudged that usage of "jerk" by Opposition leader [[Neil Kinnock]] was not unparliamentary language.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=1991-11-20a.269.0#g283.10 "European Community (Intergovernmental Conferences)"].

'''West Flemish''' ({{lang-nl|West-Vlaams}}, {{lang-fr|flamand occidental}}) is a dialect of the [[Dutch language]] spoken in western [[Belgium]] and adjoining parts of the [[Netherlands]] and [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;RL Trask, "Number of Languages", in ''Language and Linguistics: The Key Concepts'', 2nd ed. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

West Flemish is spoken by about a million people in the Belgian province of [[West Flanders]], and a further 120,000 in the neighbouring [[Netherlands|Dutch]] coastal district of [[Zeelandic Flanders]] (and another 220,000 if Zealandic is included), and 10,000 in the northern part of the [[France|French]] ''[[département in France|département]]'' of [[Nord (département)|Nord]].&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt; Some of the main cities where West Flemish is widely spoken are [[Bruges]], [[Kortrijk]], [[Ostend]], [[Roeselare]], and [[Ypres]]. The dialects of the rest of the Dutch province of [[Zeeland]], [[Zeelandic]], are often included in West Flemish; these are part of a [[dialect continuum]] which proceeds further north into [[Hollandic]].

West Flemish is listed as a "vulnerable" language in [[UNESCO]]'s online [[Red Book of Endangered Languages]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00206 UNESCO.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101030021439/http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00206 |date=October 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The language has its own dedicated Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia| title = Voorblad| encyclopedia = Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia| accessdate = 2018-06-08| date = 2015-07-19| url = https://vls.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Voorblad&amp;oldid=285547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
West Flemish has a phonology that differs significantly from that of Standard Dutch. The best known traits are the replacement of Standard Dutch (pre-)velar fricatives ''g'' and ''ch'' in Dutch ({{IPA|/x, ɣ/}}) with glottal  ''h'' {{IPA|[h, ɦ]}} and the overall lack of [[diphthong]]s. The following differences are listed by their Dutch spelling, as some different letters have merged their sounds in Standard Dutch but remained separate sounds in West Flemish. Pronunciations can also differ slightly from region to region.

* ''sch'' - {{IPA|/sx/}} is realised as {{IPA|[sh]}} or {{IPA|[skʰ]}} (''sh'' or ''sk'').
* ''ei'' - {{IPA|/ɛi/}} is realised as {{IPA|[ɛː]}} or {{IPA|[jɛ]}} (''è'' or ''jè'').
* ''ij '' - {{IPA|/ɛi/}} is realised as {{IPA|[i]}} (short ''ie'', also written as ''y'').
* ''au'' - {{IPA|/ʌu/}} is realised as {{IPA|[ɔw]}} (''ow'')
* ''ou'' - {{IPA|/ʌu/}} is realised as {{IPA|[ʊ]}} (short ''oe''), it is very similar to the long "oe" that is also used in Standard Dutch ({{IPA|[u]}}), which can cause confusion
* ''e'' - {{IPA|/ɛ/}} is realised as {{IPA|[æː]}} or {{IPA|[a]}}.
* ''i'' - {{IPA|/ɪ/}} is realised as {{IPA|[ɛ]}}.
* ''ie'' - {{IPA|/i/}} is longer {{IPA|[iː]}}
* ''aa'' - {{IPA|/aː/}} is realised as {{IPA|[õ]}}.

The nonexistentce of {{IPA|/x/}} and {{IPA|/ɣ/}} in West Flemish makes pronuncing them very difficult for native speakers. That often causes [[hypercorrection]] of the {{IPA|/h/}} sounds to a {{IPA|/x/}} or {{IPA|/ɣ/}}.

Standard Dutch also has many words with an ''-en'' ({{IPA|/ən/}}) suffix (mostly plural forms of verbs and nouns). While Standard Dutch and most dialects do not pronounce the final ''n'', West Flemish typically drops the ''e'' and pronounces the ''n'' inside the base word. For base words already ending with ''n'', the final ''n'' sound is often lengthened to clarify the suffix. That makes many words become similar to those of [[English language|English]]: ''beaten'', ''listen'' etc.

The short ''o''  ({{IPA|[ɔ]}}) can also be pronounced as a short ''u'' ({{IPA|[ʌ]}}). That happens spontaneously to some words, but other words keep their original short ''o'' sounds. Similarly, the short ''a'' ({{IPA|[ɑ]}}) can turn into a short ''o'' ({{IPA|[ɔ]}}) in some words spontaneously.

The diphthong ''ui'' ({{IPA|/œy/}}) does not exist in West Flemish and is replaced by a long ''u'' ({{IPA|[ʉ]}}) or a long ''ie'' ({{IPA|[i:]}}). Like for the ''ui'', the long ''o'' ({{IPA|[o]}}) can be replaced by an {{IPA|[ø]}} (''eu'') for some words but a {{IPA|[wo]}} for others. That often causes similarities to ranchers English.

Here are some examples showing the sound shifts that are part of the vocabulary:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Dutch !! West Flemish !! English
|-
| vol (short ''o'') || vul {{IPA|[vʌl]}}|| full
|-
| zon (short ''o'') || zunne {{IPA|[zʌ:nə]}}|| sun
|-
| kom (short ''o'') || kom {{IPA|[kɔm]}}|| come
|-
| boter (long ''o'') || beuter {{IPA|[bøtər]}}|| butter
|-
| boot (long ''o'') || boot {{IPA|[bwot]}} || boat
|-
| kuiken || kiek'n {{IPA|[ki:kn]}} || chicken
|-
| bruin || brun {{IPA|[bryn]}} || brown
|}

== Grammar ==
=== Plural form ===
Plural forms in Standard Dutch most often add ''-en'', but West Flemish usually uses ''-s'', like the Lower Saxon Germanic dialects and even more prominently in English in which ''-en'' has become very rare. Under the influence of Standard Dutch, ''-s'' is being used by fewer people, and younger speakers tend to use ''-en''.

=== Verb conjugation ===
The verbs ''zijn'' ("to be") and ''hebben'' ("to have") are also conjugated differently.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Dutch !! West Flemish !! English !! Dutch !! West Flemish !! English
|-
| zijn || zyn || to be || hebben || èn || to have
|-
| ik ben || 'k zyn || I am || ik heb || 'k è || I have
|-
| gij zijt || gy zyt || you are || jij hebt || gy èt || you have
|-
| hij is || ie is || he is || hij heeft || ie èt || he has
|-
| wij zijn || wydder zyn || we are || wij hebben || wydder èn || we have
|-
| jullie zijn || gydder zyt || you are || jullie hebben || gydder èt || you have
|-
| zij zijn || zydder zyn || they are || zij hebben || zydder èn || they have
|}

=== Double subject ===
West Flemish often has a double subject.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Dutch !! West Flemish !! English
|-
| Jij hebt dat gedaan. || '''G'''' è '''gy''' da gedoan. || You have done that.
|-
| Ik heb dat niet gedaan. || ''''K''' èn '''ekik''' da nie gedoan.  || I didn't do that.
|}

=== Articles ===
Standards Dutch has an indefinite article that does not depend on gender, unlike in West Flemish. However, a gender-independent article is increasingly used. Like in English, ''n'' is pronounced only if the next word begins with a vowel sound.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Dutch !! West Flemish !! English
|-
| een stier (m) || ne stier || a bull
|-
| een koe (f) || e koe  || a cow
|-
| een kalf (o) || e kolf || a calf
|-
| een aap (m) || nen oap || an ape
|-
| een huis (o) || en 'us || a house
|}

=== Conjugation of ''yes'' and ''no'' ===
Another feature of West Flemish is the conjugation of ''ja'' and ''nee'' ("yes" and "no") to the subject of the sentence. That is somewhat related to the double subject, but even when the rest of the sentence is not pronounced, ''ja'' and ''nee'' are generally used with the first part of the double subject. There is also an extra word, ''toet'' ({{IPA|[tut]}}), negates the previous sentence but gives a positive answer.

''Ja'', ''nee'' and ''toet'' can also all be strengthened by adding ''mo-'' or ''ba-''. Both mean "but" and are derived from Dutch ''but'' or ''maar'') and can be even used together (''mobatoet'').

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Dutch !! West Flemish !! English
|-
| Heb jij dat gedaan? - Ja / Nee || Èj gy da gedoan? - Joak / Nink|| Did you do that? - Yes / No
|-
| Je hebt dat niet gedaan, hé? - Maar jawel || G'èt da nie gedoan, é? - Batoet || You didn't do that, eh? - But yes I did.
|-
| Heeft hij dat gedaan? - Ja / Nee || Èt ie da gedoan? - Joaj / Nij || Did he do that? - Yes / No
|-
| Gaan we verder? - Ja / Nee || Zyn we? - Jow / Niw || Can we go? - Yes / No
|}

== Vocabulary ==
West Flemish inherited many words from Saxon settlers and later on had English loanwords from the wool and cloth trades. Both categories differ from Standard Dutch and show similarities with English and so is difficult to separate both categories.

During the [[Industrial Revolution]], the increasing trade with France caused many industrial loanwords from French.

=== False friends ===
Even when words exist in both Dutch and West Flemish, their meaning can be different. That sometimes causes confusion for native speakers who do not realise that words are used differently.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Dutch !! West Flemish !! English
|-
| achter || bachtn || after / behind (a notion of space)
|-
| na || achter || past / after (a notion of time)
|-
|}
