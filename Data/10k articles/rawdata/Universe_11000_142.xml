      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2429">The '''Ameralik Span''' is the longest [[span (architecture)|span]] of an [[Electric power transmission|electrical]] [[overhead power line]] in the world. It is situated near [[Nuuk]] on [[Greenland]] and crosses [[Ameralik Fjord]] with a span width of 5,376 metres at {{coord|64|6|18|N|51|14|16|W|display=inline,title}}.  It was built in 1993 by the Norwegian company NTE Entreprise ([[Nord-Tr√∏ndelag Elektrisitetsverk]]) and is part of a single-circuit 132 kV powerline running from [[Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant]] to Nuuk.

The span consists of four steel conductors of 40 millimeters diameter whereby one is a spare conductor. The span has a width of 190 metres and a minimum clearance of 128 metres. The pylons on each side of the span carry only one conductor and are situated on mountains 444 metres high on the north and 1013 metres at the south shore.

'''''Between Pacific Tides'''''  is a [[1939 in literature|1939]] book by [[Ed Ricketts]] and Jack Calvin that explores the [[intertidal ecology]] of the [[Pacific coast]] of the United States.  The book was originally titled "Between Pacific Tides: An Account of the Habits and Habitats of Some Five Hundred of the Common, Conspicuous Seashore Invertebrates of the Pacific Coast Between Sitka, Alaska, and Northern Mexico".

Prior to Ricketts' work, the standard descriptive text of intertidal species of the Pacific was [[Myrtle E. Johnson|Myrtle E. Johnson's]] ''Seashore Animals of the Pacific Coast'', published in 1927 (repr. 1967). 

''Between Pacific Tides'' was out of print from 1942 to 1948,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Updated and expanded sections have been added since the original edition was published, including: [[John Steinbeck]]'s Foreword to the 1948 edition; a new chapter regarding the influence on the distribution of shore organisms; an updated Annotated Systematic Index and General Bibliography comprising 2,300 entries; and the addition of 200 photographs and drawings.&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;{{cite web

The '''Broadlands Dam''' (also known as the '''Broadlands Hydropower Project''' by the developers) is a {{nowrap|35 [[Megawatt|MW]]}} [[run-of-the-river hydroelectricity|run-of-the-river]] hydroelectric complex  currently under construction in [[Kitulgala]], [[Sri Lanka]]. The project is expected to be completed in 2020, and will consist of two dams, and a power station further downstream.&lt;ref name=CeylonToday&gt;{{cite news|title=Broadlands Hydropower project work begins on Monday|url=http://www.ceylontoday.lk/16-37595-news-detail-broadlands-hydropower-project-work-begins-on-monday.html|accessdate=2 October 2013|newspaper=Ceylon Today|date=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily News"&gt;{{cite news|title=Broadlands hydro power project construction work inaugurated|url=http://www.dailynews.lk/local/broadlands-hydro-power-project-construction-work-inaugurated|accessdate=2 October 2013|newspaper=[[Daily News (Sri Lanka)|Daily News]]|date=2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With an estimated annual generation capacity of {{nowrap|126 [[GWh]]}}, the facility will be the country's last major hydroelectric project, due to the exhaustion of island-wide hydropower potential. Construction of the project was ceremonially inaugurated by the {{nowrap|[[Ministry of Power and Energy|Minister of Power and Energy]]}} {{nowrap|Mrs. Pavithra Wanniarachchi}} at the auspicious time of 11:01 on {{nowrap|17 July 2013}}.&lt;ref name=SundayObserver&gt;{{cite news|title=Broadlands hydro power project to be constructed|url=http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2013/07/14/new40.asp|accessdate=2 October 2013|newspaper=[[Sunday Observer (Sri Lanka)|Sunday Observer]]|date=2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CEB&gt;{{cite web|title=Major Projects: Broadlands Hydro Power Project|url=http://www.ceb.lk/sub/dp/majorprojects.aspx?xghGKfllumv=6|publisher=[[Ceylon Electricity Board]]|accessdate=2 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112061445/http://www.ceb.lk/sub/dp/majorprojects.aspx?xghGKfllumv=6|archivedate=12 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dams and reservoirs ==
The primary [[gravity dam]] measuring {{Convert|24|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in height and {{Convert|114|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in length is being constructed across the [[Maskeliya Oya]] at Kitulgala, and will supply water to the power station via a {{Convert|3404.7|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} [[penstock]] measuring {{Convert|5.4|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} in diameter.&lt;ref name=BHPCEB&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Broadlands Hydropower Project|url=http://www.bhpceb.lk/index_files/Page379.htm|publisher=BHPCEB.lk|accessdate=2 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004212909/http://www.bhpceb.lk/index_files/Page379.htm|archivedate=4 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A secondary [[gravity dam|gravity]] [[weir]] measuring {{Convert|19|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|48|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in height and length, is also to be built in the vicinity, over the nearby [[Kehelgamu Oya]], to provide additional hydroelectric capacity. The weir, to be called the Kehelgamu Weir, will create a catchment area of {{Convert|176|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}}, and will provide additional [[hydraulic head|head]] to the penstock of the main dam via a {{Convert|811|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} tunnel.&lt;ref name=BHPCEB /&gt;

The penstock from the main dam will feed a power station consisting of two {{Nowrap|3-phase synchronous}} [[Francis turbine|turbine]]s, each of {{nowrap|17.5 MW}} and a rated discharge of {{Nowrap|{{Convert|32|m3|ft3|0|abbr=on}} per second}}.&lt;ref name=BHPCEB /&gt;

'''''Buzz Lightyear of Star Command''''' is an American [[Animation|animated]] [[science fiction]]/[[Adventure fiction|adventure]]/[[comedy]] series produced by [[Disney Television Animation|Walt Disney Television Animation]]. The series originally aired on [[UPN]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from October 2000 to January 2001 as part of [[ABC Kids (US)#Disney's One Saturday Morning|Disney's One Saturday Morning]] programming block.&lt;ref name=bcdb&gt;"[http://www.bcdb.com/cartoons/Walt_Disney_Studios/Television/Buzz_Lightyear_of_Star_Command/ Buzz Lightyear of Star Command]". ''www.bcdb.com'',  May 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It follows the adventures of space ranger [[Buzz Lightyear]], who first appeared in the film ''[[Toy Story]]'' as an action figure and one of the film's protagonists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=GRETCHEN-MARIE | last=GOODE | url= | title=BUZZ LIGHTYEAR OF STAR COMMAND: THE ADVENTURE BEGINS | work=[[Hartford Courant]] | date=August 24, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
''Buzz Lightyear of Star Command'' takes place in the far future, and is a pastiche of ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'', ''[[Babylon 5]]'', ''[[Lost in Space]]'', ''[[Flash Gordon (1954 TV series)|Flash Gordon]]'', ''[[Buck Rogers]]'', ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]''-style science fiction. Capital Planet is the forefront of the Galactic Alliance, a peaceful union of various planets, home to various alien species that coexist in harmony with one another. Star Command is a peacekeeping organization consisting of Space Rangers, who investigate threats to galactic peace. The primary enemy of Star Command is the Evil Emperor Zurg, an intergalactic [[crime boss]] that rules an empire of heavily armed [[robot]]s and slave races forced to work in opposition to the Galactic Alliance.

The series features [[Buzz Lightyear]], a famous, experienced Space Ranger who takes a crew of rookies under his wing as he investigates criminal activity across the galaxy, and attempts to bring down Evil Emperor Zurg once and for all.

''Buzz Lightyear of Star Command'' is a [[metafictional]] series that exists within the reality of the film ''[[Toy Story]]'', where Buzz Lightyear is a highly popular toyline. One of the two lead characters in the ''Toy Story'' film series is a Buzz Lightyear action figure, voiced by [[Tim Allen]].

==Characters==
===Star Command===
====Team Lightyear====
* [[Buzz Lightyear|Captain Buzz Lightyear]] (voiced by [[Tim Allen]] in ''The Adventure Begins'', [[Patrick Warburton]] in the actual series): Famed Space Ranger known for heroism and bravery. Buzz often suggests that his arch-villain Emperor Zurg is behind every evil plot and is often proven correct. Like his ''Toy Story'' incarnation, Buzz is a stickler for procedure, but will tell a cover story if he needs to.&lt;ref&gt;In the episode "42" Buzz admits to Booster that he didn't lie to Commander Nebula by stating that he only told a cover story&lt;/ref&gt; However, he has little people skills, and at times displays a lack of common sense. He attended PS- 19&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (that's 6859) as a primary school. He wrote at least half of the regulations in the Star Command Manual. He also owns a house on Capital Planet, though as they all look alike and his duties often keep him away, he is confused over just which one is his.&lt;ref&gt;Although he is seen at his house on several episodes."Tag Team&lt;/ref&gt; To compare this animation and the ''Toy Story'' films, the button between the red and blue ones is green in the ''Toy Story'' films and yellow in this animation with the releasing of strings when pressed. He seems to have a little crush on Dr. Ozma Furbanna and vice versa.
* Princess Mira Nova (voiced by [[Nicole Sullivan]]): A rookie ranger and heir to the Tangean throne. She utilizes her people's ability to phase through walls (called "ghosting") and read minds. Buzz has a tendency to refer to her as "Princess" when he's angry with her. She acts as Buzz's co-pilot and second-in-command. She has the most common sense of the team. Mira also has an estranged relationship with her father, King Nova, who disapproves of her choice of being a Space Ranger, though deep down she still cares about him. She has [[red hair]] and turquoise skin.
* Booster Sinclair Munchapper (voiced by [[Stephen Furst]]): A huge dinosaur-like former janitor from the agricultural planet of Jo-ad (a play on the name of the Joad family, from [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]''). He has a big appetite and incredible strength, but is sweet and occasionally naive. He is in awe of Buzz Lightyear and has encyclopedic knowledge of his prior adventures.
* XR (voiced by [[Larry Miller (entertainer)|Larry Miller]] and [[Neil Flynn]]): A short robot that was originally emotionless and programmed to learn from Buzz, but was blown apart by Agent Z during his first mission. The LGMs rebuilt him, but the temporary loss of the Uni-Mind to Emperor Zurg left them off their game. They rebuilt XR with his slicker, more emotional personality and a variety of attachments. XR stands for Experimental Ranger. (The LGMs have stated that this is the official meaning of the name, though other characters on the show hold the erroneous belief that the X stands for Expendable). He gets blown apart on nearly every mission he goes on, but is easily rebuilt. He considers Commander Nebula his father (due to his signing the paperwork authorizing his creation) and is always seeking his approval.

====Other personnel====
* Commander Nebula (voiced by [[Adam Carolla]]): The Space Rangers' commander, whose left leg was replaced by a [[pegleg]]-like plasma cannon. Rather short-tempered and constantly speaks with a loud voice. He has a robotic desk that forces him to do his paperwork. He hates to do so, though, and therefore signs forms without looking at them. By doing so, he inadvertently gave permission for the creation of XR, who therefore considers him a father. (He thought the form was the LGMs' vacation request.) Nebula is frequently irritated by this, though he gives XR his due for his successes.
* LGMs, or Little Green Men (voiced by [[Jeff Pidgeon]] in Andy's Room sequence, [[Patrick Warburton]] in the actual series): The LGMs are small, three-eyed [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] (originally appeared as squeeze toy aliens in the ''Toy Story'' movies). They are the intensely loyal backbone of Star Command, keeping the station running while inventing/maintaining all of the equipment. When one of their own is kidnapped, the other LGMs will instinctively try to rescue him by any means necessary. LGMs are typically in awe of Buzz. While they generally like the other Rangers, they may not be able to tell one from another.&lt;ref&gt;In "Good Ol' Buzz", an LGM mistakenly refers to Mira as "Booster". Upon being corrected, he says the Rangers all look the same to them.&lt;/ref&gt; Several of their race are also shown to work for Santa Claus, acting as his toy builders.
* Ty Parsec (voiced by [[Steve Hytner]]): Ty is the infamous old comrade of Buzz Lightyear, who is fed up with Buzz always coming to his rescue. The Space Ranger was accidentally transformed into the robotic Wirewolf (equivalent of a [[werewolf]]) on the planet of Canis Lunis, after being bitten by the [[villain]] NOS-4-A2 while exposed to radioactive moonrock. Appeared in two episodes, with a cameo appearance in the episode "War, Peace, and War". He is ultimately cured and reinstated as a Space Ranger.
* Rocket Crocket (voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]]): Member of Star Command and leader of Team Rocket. He has been Buzz's rival since their academy days.
* Petra Hammerhold (voiced by [[Nikki Cox]]): Senator Hammerhold's daughter. She joined Star Command when her father forced her to do so (largely to keep her from her boyfriend Plasma Boy). She was initially resentful of this, but was moved by Buzz's heroism during a crisis.
* Plasma Boy (voiced by [[Michael Showalter]]): Petra's boyfriend, who has a Plasma Monster form. Booster competed against him for Petra's affection. When Mira and XR fired a laser at his Plasma Monster form, he destabilized enough to the brink of explosion. He was prevented from explosion when Booster used his suit and Ion Stabilization Matrix on him. He's now a member of Star Command.
* 42 (voiced by [[Joy Behar]]): Usually the name of Buzz Lightyear's ship, it gained A.I. from one of the encounters with the Valkyran Raiders and a new energy projector device inserted on the ship by the LGMs. 42 doesn't like what Buzz says about her and usually controls the ship herself. XR developed a crush on her. When the Valkyran Raiders were thwarted, 42's consciousness was placed into a robot body and she now helps the LGMs.

===Villains===
* [[Emperor Zurg|Evil Emperor Zurg]] (voiced by [[Wayne Knight]]): Main [[antagonist]] of the series. Rules an empire on Planet Z, and wants to rule the entire galaxy while destroying Star Command. Emperor Zurg considers Buzz his arch-enemy and often takes any opportunity to eliminate him. Most of his subjects are robots. His feet double as rockets and he can transform his arms into a variety of weapons. Despite often breaking the seriousness of otherwise purely evil statements, Zurg is widely considered the most evil person in the galaxy, especially by the other villains. He seems to have some neuroses about being touched. In some episodes is shown being comical. The episode ''War, and Peace and War'' was notably the only episode where Zurg teamed up with Buzz Lightyear to defeat the Heed, a common enemy that was trying to take over their galaxy. In ''Stranger Invasion'', he revealed himself to be Buzz's father (a parody upon ''[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back|The Empire Strikes Back]]'' and a nearly identical scene in ''[[Toy Story 2]]''), but quickly took it back, using the statement as a 'Made You Look' in order to stun Buzz and gain the upper hand.
** Grubs (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]): Zurg's equivalents to the LGMs of Star Command (though far less competent). They perform mechanical and technical duties. The Grubs work for Zurg against their will and also desire freedom, but many of them are simply too afraid to try to defect.
** Brain Pods (Various Voices for each one): [[Cybernetic]] brains in mobile jars, who serve Zurg as scientists and researchers. Although they take pride in their creations, they secretly harbor a desire to escape from Zurg's control. (Two of which are shown succeeding in doing so on-screen.)
** Hornets: The Hornets are Zurg's [[robotic]] foot soldiers, extremely expendable, lousy shots and always get vaporized in mass numbers by Lightyear's team. Hornets come in different models, but the most frequently seen are yellow and of average height.
* Warp Darkmatter (voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]]) was once Buzz's partner and friend, but he had been secretly working for Zurg since his academy days as a double agent. He eventually began working for him full-time as "Agent Z." His right arm is robotic (with various weapon attachments) and was grafted to his body after becoming Agent Z. Warp often takes on assignments for Zurg and is paid quite handsomely. (He owns a moon and a summer home.) Though Buzz has vowed to bring him in for treason, he retains some hope that there is still some good in him.
* Gravitina (voiced by [[Kerri Kenney-Silver]]): A large-headed female villain with mental control over gravity. One of Zurg's allies and once hired to destroy Star Command. She's in love with Buzz and later his evil counterpart.
* NOS-4-A2 (voiced by [[Craig Ferguson]]): NOS-4-A2 is a robotic [[vampire]] created by Zurg. He is capable of draining any system or entity driven by electrical power, as well as controlling any machine he bites. His bite (in combination with radioactive moonrock) also transformed Ty Parsec into Wirewolf. Using Wirewolf and XL, he briefly usurped control of Planet Z from Zurg and attempted to transform everyone in the galaxy into robots for him to feed on, but was defeated and destroyed. His name is a pun on the term [[Nosferatu]].
* Torque (voiced by [[Brad Garrett]]): Minor [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[villain]] who committed [[crimes]] of [[terrorism]], [[smuggling]], [[arson]], and unpaid [[parking tickets]]. After being freed from a prison transport by Zurg's Hornets, the Grubs implanted a cell-separation device upon his chest. Torque then possesses the ability to create duplicate versions of himself. They are unstable, however, as a single laser blast is enough to destroy them. In "The Taking of PC-7", he tried to turn Booster evil (and later Buzz) with a memory-altering device built by the Warden of PC-7. The same device also made Torque (temporarily at least) a heroic good guy. Torque riding a motorcycle-shaped spacecraft and his duplication abilities seem to be a reference to the character [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]] (who was also voiced by [[Brad Garrett]] in his [[DCAU]] appearances).
* XL (voiced by [[Bobcat Goldthwait]]): XR's predecessor (and technically older brother), who was shut down due to his villainous attitude. When he was reactivated by Zurg, XL rebuilt himself into a larger, more powerful robot with cutting edge (and stolen) robot parts. His head is red, whereas XR's is yellow. He infiltrates Star Command numerous times because its command codes are in his head. Like XR, he considers Commander Nebula his father, though he resents him for shutting him down. He later redeems himself and is converted into an office managing robot capable of photocopying, collating, and other office related functions. His name is a pun referring to his size (extra large).
* Wirewolf: A space ranger (Ty Parsec) that patrolled the planet Canis Lunis until an attack from NOS-4-A2. While Ty was in combat with the energy vampire, NOS-4-A2 flew himself and Ty up into the beam, that gives power to the planet from the moon's radioactive energy, and bit into Ty's skin. After NOS-4-A2 fled, Ty started to mutate into some sort of electronical canine later given the title of Wirewolf. When having discovered that this transformation only happens in the light of the Canis Lunis moon, Buzz told Booster to destroy the moon. Once the moon was destroyed, Team Lightyear believed that the Wirewolf was finished until NOS-4-A2 gave Ty a Canis Lunis moonrock. When NOS-4-A2 was destroyed, Ty was turned back to normal ending the curse of the Wirewolf.

===Galactic Alliance===
* Madam [[President]] (voiced by [[Roz Ryan]]): Head of the Galactic Alliance. Her real name is unknown.
* Senator Aarrfvox (voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]): A Shragorakian senator.
* Senator Banda (voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]]): A Bathyosian senator.
* Senator Hammerhold (voiced by [[Corey Burton]]): Petra Hammerhold's father.
* Senator Phlegmex (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]): A slime-emitting senator.

===Other characters===
* Becky (voiced by [[Russi Taylor]]): A little alien girl from the planet Roswell. She befriended Booster (who she calls Pickles) when Team Lightyear's ship crashed on her planet.
* Brent Starkisser (voiced by [[Corey Burton]]): The Galaxy's reporter.
* Cosmo (voiced by [[Paul Rugg]]): An alien that owns and runs the diner that Team Lightyear eats at. He has a mechanical arm as well as a foreign accent.
* Dr. Animus (voiced by [[Tony Jay]]): The Galaxy's therapist.
* Dr. Ozma Furbanna (voiced by [[Linda Hamilton]]): Lead (and only) naturalist on planet Karn. She favors all animals (even the lethal carnivores) and hates to have them hurt; no matter what. Has a crush on Buzz (won't admit it, though), and vice versa. Zurg once used her help to hatch the Millennial (entirely ticklish) Bugs where Zurg will use them on Capital Planet.
* Ed (voiced by [[Paul Rugg]]): A courier who somehow always knows how to track down Buzz Lightyear.
* Officer Panchex (voiced by [[Brian Doyle-Murray]]): A fish policeman who helped Buzz Lightyear fight Minister Gularis.
* Professor Triffid (voiced by [[Joel Murray]]): A scientist from Rhizome. He cares a lot for the plants there.
* Savy SL2 (voiced by [[Cree Summer]]): Her adopted robot parents were attacked by NOS-4-A2 in ''The Slayer'', which lead her to hunting him down for revenge.
* Sheriff of Roswell (voiced by [[Stephen Root]]): Becky's father and ally of Team Lightyear.
* King Nova (voiced by [[John O'Hurley]]): Mira's father and the ruler of Tangea. Being more tradition bound he clearly disapproves of his daughter being a space ranger and therefore has a complicated relationship with her as well as Buzz. But regardless of his pompous nature he still cares about his daughter and also came to her aid when she had developed a power addiction and helped her get over it, though he almost got his wish of getting his daughter back in this instance had Buzz not saved her career through a cover story.
* [[Santa Claus]] (voiced by [[Earl Boen]]): The holiday figure, who delivers presents to all the good people in the galaxy during the Holiday. He previously used a sleigh powered by belief and later time manipulation to accomplish this massive task. Zurg stole his time manipulation device to destroy the Holiday for everyone, prompting Santa to seek Team Lightyear's help.
* The Fixer (voiced by Ed Asner): A Character from Trade World. He sells robotic parts to people around Trade World, and once tricked XR into delivering a package to XL.
* Crumford Lorak (voiced by [[Jon Favreau]]): A conman, informant and criminal commonly seen on Trade World. When this guy gets the chance, he always tricks or turns on the first ranger he sees.
* Rentwhistle Swack (voiced by [[French Stewart]]): An unscrupulous conman who will do anything for money.

==Planets and moons==
There are many planets in this series. Among these planets are:

* Bathyos: An [[ocean planet]].
* Beta Bayou: A bottom-feeder hunter that Rentwhistle Swack rendezvous with is from this planet.
* Binipinardia: A planet that contained a devolution gas.
* Canis Lunis: A planet where Ty Parsec was turned into Wirewolf by NOS-4-A2. The name derives from the Latin words for "canine" and "moon."
* Capital Planet: The Galactic Alliance members meet here and the "Earth" of the galaxy.
* Gargantia: A planet inhabited by tiny aliens.
* Jo-Ad: An agricultural planet which is Booster's home planet.
* Karn: A planet that serves as a creature reserve. Dr. Ozma Furbanna works here.

* Olur 5: Zurg used this planet to hatch the Millennial Bugs in one of his plans to attack Capital Planet.
* PC-7: A prison planet.
* Planet X: A somewhat desert-like planet with no name or life. Home of an ancient city and the temple containing Natron.

* Raenok: The Raenok's self-titled planet.
* Rexon 5:
* Rhizome: A vegetation planet which is Professor Triffid's home world.
* Roswell: A planet similar to Earth in 1947. The inhabitants of Roswell are [[grey alien]]s. An incident happens there, somewhat like the real [[Roswell incident]], but with the roles of the alien and human inverted; the humans being the visitors and the aliens being the skeptical government. E.g. in it a Grey police station commander said "''... and I suppose they had big flappy mouths and little bitty eyes ...''" when querying one of his men's statement about seeing landing humans.
* Sands de Solay: A resort moon. Destroyed by an out-of-control freight ship.
* Sentilla 6: A stormy planet with lava rivers.
* Shragorak: Senator Aarrfvox's home planet.
* Sitka 7: A ski resort planet
* Tangea: Mira's home planet inhabited by two races: the Tangean Royals and Grounders. The name is based on the Royals' ability to become intangible
* Trade World: A commercial-oriented world where lesser bad guys hang out.
* Verdentia: A peaceful planet.
* Uncharted Moon: The very moon where we see Buzz and Warp in The Adventure Begins also where Buzz thought Warp was killed but later discovered that he started working for Zurg disguised as the mysterious Agent Z and that the explosion only damaged Warp's arm forcing him to get a new, robotic, arm with multiple weapons programmed in it.

==Broadcast and syndication==
The series was aired during [[UPN]]'s [[Disney's One Too]] programming block from October 2000 to August 2003. It also aired on [[Disney Channel]] from October 2000 to August 2003 and again from June 5, 2006 to May 16, 2008, when it was taken off the air in the U.S.. The show also aired on [[Toon Disney]] from 2003 to 2007.

==Awards and nominations==
*'''[[Daytime Emmy Awards]]'''
:[[28th Daytime Emmy Awards|2001]] - ''Outstanding Sound Editing - Special Class'' - Jennifer Mertens, [[Paca Thomas]], Otis Van Osten, Rick Hammel, Eric Hertsguaard, Robbi Smith, Brian F. Mars, Marc S. Perlman, and Dominick Certo (won)

==Home Video==
As of 2018, the whole show has yet to be released for home media. The promotional VHS of Buzz Lightyear of Star Command ''Planet of the Lost'' was released on VHS as a sampler tape in November 18, 2003.

==Video game==
A videogame named ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command (video game)|Buzz Lightyear of Star Command]]'' was developed by [[Traveller's Tales]] and published by [[Activision]], and released for [[PlayStation]], [[Game Boy Color]], [[Microsoft Windows]], and [[Dreamcast]] in 2000. The gameplay revolves around Buzz chasing down the various villains from the show, and defeating them using different color coded weapons.

==Cultural references==
* Buzz's house and everyone elses' houses on Capital Planet are based an attraction at [[Disneyland]] called [[Monsanto House of the Future]] which existed from 1957 to 1967, whilst Star Command is visually based on [[Space Mountain]].
* The episode "Strange Invasion", is a spoof of the [[Roswell Incident]] right down to the alien autopsy film and the "weather balloon coverup". Also keeping in line with the [[Roswell Incident]], the planet they crash on is called "Roswell" and it bears a strong resemblance to the [[American Southwest]]; its inhabitants, meanwhile, resemble the [[grey alien]]s.
* The "Roswellian" sheriff and barber are spoofs of [[Sheriff Andy Taylor]] and [[Floyd the Barber]] on ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]''.
* When Buzz and Booster return to "Roswell" in the episode "Stranger Invasion", they end up attending a tea party hosted by the little girl Booster befriended during their first visit. While Booster wears the same outfit he did in "Strange Invasion" Buzz wears the same outfit he did as "Mrs. Nesbitt" in ''[[Toy Story]]'' at Hannah Phillips' tea party.
* In the episode "Stranger Invasion", Buzz Lightyear and the Evil Emperor Zurg engage in a confrontation similar to a [[lightsaber]] battle, in which Zurg distracts Buzz by claiming he's his father. Zurg also stated that he was Buzz's father in ''[[Toy Story 2]]'', in which the scene parodied ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''.
* Both the name of the last episode and the number of Buzz's ship, 42, are almost certainly references to the [[answer to life, the universe, and everything]] from ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' series.
* In the episode "Star Crossed", one of the characters is seen ordering food from [[Pixar#Pizza Planet|Pizza Planet]], which appeared as a space-themed restaurant in ''Toy Story''. Pizza Planet was a ''Toy Story'' themed pizza restaurant in [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] from December 15, 1995 to January 19, 2016 and the Pizza Planet which was formally [[Redd Rockett's Pizza Port]].

'''Central Heat Distribution Ltd.''' (CHDL) is a private [[district heating]] company located at 720 Beatty Street in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], [[Canada]] that provides heat to the [[Downtown (Vancouver)|Downtown Core]] including the [[Vancouver Public Library]] Central Branch, [[B.C. Place]], [[GM Place]], [[Queen Elizabeth Theatre]], [[Pacific Centre]] and most major hotel/office/condo towers such as [[Shaw Tower (Vancouver)|Shaw Tower]] via a 10.5&amp;nbsp;km network of high-pressure pipes between five centimetres and 50 centimetres in diameter running anywhere from one to five metres below street surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovervancouver.com/GVB/vancouver-underground.asp Greater Vancouver Underground]&lt;/ref&gt; The world-famous [[steam clock]] in [[Gastown]] is a notable addition to the more than 180 buildings that are served by the [[natural gas]] powered boiler located in the Stadium/Entertainment district of downtown.

The company was founded on November 1, 1968, by group of engineers with a desire to lower heating bills for buildings (no boilers to buy and maintain) and to reduce the amount of pollution being created to provide heat downtown. In 2014, the company was bought by developer Ian Gillespie for $32 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vancouversun.com/technology/City+will+require+downtown+buildings+hook+district+energy+plant/10972244/story.html Vancouver Sun Article April 16, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

The massive building CHDL occupies at the west end of the Georgia Viaduct was once home to the printing plant for Pacific Press the publishers of [[The Vancouver Sun]] and [[The Province]] newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vancouverhistory.ca/sunspots_nov.htm The History of Metropolitan Vancouver]&lt;/ref&gt;

In one method, the practitioner places crystals on different parts of the body, often corresponding to [[chakra]]s; or else the practitioner places crystals around the body in an attempt to construct an energy grid, which is purported to surround the client with healing energy.&lt;ref name="ChasePawlik2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chase|first1=Pamela|last2=Pawlik|first2=Jonathan|title=Healing with Crystals|year=2001|publisher=Career Press|isbn=9781564145352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, scientific investigations have not validated claims that chakras or energy grids actually exist, nor is there any evidence that crystal healing has any greater effect upon the body than any other [[placebo]]; for these reasons it is considered a [[pseudoscience]].

==Ethnography==

Precious stones have been thought of as healing objects by a variety of cultures worldwide.&lt;ref name="McClean2010"&gt;{{cite book | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AQ2g6V8MJn4C|chapter= Crystal and spiritual healing in northern England: Folk-inspired systems of medicine | title= Folk Healing and Health Care Practices in Britain and Ireland: Stethoscopes, Wands, and Crystals |last1= McClean |first1 = Stuart | accessdate=2017-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anglosphere===

Crystal healing is heavily associated with the [[New Age]] spiritual movement: "the middle-class New Age healing activity ''par excellence''".&lt;ref name="McClean2010" /&gt; In contrast with other forms of [[complementary and alternative medicine]] (CAM), participants in crystal healing view the practice as "individuated",&lt;ref name="McClean2005a"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McClean |first=Stuart |date=2005-08-03 |title=‚ÄòThe illness is part of the person‚Äô: discourses of blame, individual responsibility and individuation at a centre for spiritual healing in the North of England |url= |journal= Sociology of health and illness|volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=628‚Äì648 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9566.2005.00459.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., dependent on extreme personalization and creative expression.&lt;ref name="McClean2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McClean2005b"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McClean |first1=Stuart |last2=Shaw |first2=Alison |date=2005-07-01 |title=From Schism to Continuum?

Practitioners of crystal healing purport that certain physical properties‚Äîe.g., shape, color, and markings‚Äîdetermine the ailments that a stone can heal; lists of such links are published in commonly distributed texts.&lt;ref name="McClean2005b" /&gt; Paradoxically, practitioners also "hold the view that crystals have no intrinsic qualities but that, instead, their quality changes according to both" participants.&lt;ref name="McClean2005b" /&gt; After selecting the stones by color or their believed metaphysical qualities, they place them on parts of the body.&lt;ref name="Regal"/&gt; Color selection and placement of stones are done according to concepts of [[grounding (metaphysics)|grounding]], ''[[chakra]]s'', or [[energy (esotericism)|energy]] grids.

===Other cultures===

Many other cultures have developed traditions of crystal healing over time, including the [[Hopi]] Native Americans of Arizona&lt;ref&gt;

==Criticism==
There is no [[peer-reviewed]] scientific evidence that crystal healing has any effect; it is considered a [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name="Regal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spellman"&gt;Spellman, Frank R; Price-Bayer, Joni. (2010). ''In Defense of Science: Why Scientific Literacy Matters''. The Scarecrow Press. p. 81. {{ISBN|978-1-60590-735-2}} "There is no scientific evidence that crystal healing has any effect. It has been called a pseudoscience. Pleasant feelings or the apparent successes of crystal healing can be attributed to the placebo effect or cognitive bias‚Äîa believer wanting it to be true."&lt;/ref&gt; Alleged successes of crystal healing can be attributed to the [[placebo effect]].&lt;ref name="Spellman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LS" /&gt; Furthermore, there is no scientific basis for the concepts of ''chakras'', being "blocked", energy grids requiring grounding, or other such terms; they are widely understood to be nothing more than terms used by adherents to lend credibility to their practices. [[Energy|Energy, as a scientific term]], is a very well-defined concept that is readily measurable and bears little resemblance to the [[energy (esotericism)|esoteric concept of energy]] used by proponents of crystal healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508003317/http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Medicine/Biofield.html |title=The Energy Fields of Life |last=Stenger |first=Victor J. |date=2016-05-08 |access-date=2018-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, researchers French and Williams conducted a study to investigate the power of crystals compared with a placebo. Eighty volunteers were asked to meditate with either a [[quartz]] crystal, or a placebo stone which was indistinguishable from quartz. Many of the participants reported feeling typical "crystal effects"; however, this was irrespective of whether the crystals were real or placebo. In 2001 Christopher French, head of the [[anomalistic psychology]] research unit at the [[University of London]] and colleagues from [[Goldsmiths College]] outlined their study of crystal healing at the [[British Psychological Society]] Centenary Annual Conference, concluding "There is no evidence that crystal healing works over and above a placebo effect.‚Äù&lt;ref name="LS" /&gt;

Crystal healing effects could also be attributed to [[cognitive bias]] (which occurs when the believers want the practice to be true and see only things that back up that desire).&lt;ref name="pmid8418412"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Campion |first= E.W. |title=Why unconventional medicine? |journal=[[The New England Journal of Medicine]] |volume=328 |issue=4 |pages=282‚Äì3 |year=1993 |pmid=8418412 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199301283280413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crystal healing techniques are also practiced on animals, although some veterinary organizations, such as the [[British Veterinary Association]], have warned that these methods are not scientifically proven and state that people should seek the advice of a vet before using alternative techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/uk/7240231.stm |title= Warning about animal 'therapies'|publisher= [[BBC News]] |date= 2008-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous accidents have occurred in the vicinity of thunderstorms. It is often said that the turbulence can be extreme enough inside a cumulonimbus to tear an aircraft into pieces. However, this kind of accident is relatively rare. Moreover, the turbulence ''under'' a thunderstorm can be non-existent and is usually no more than moderate. Actually, most thunderstorm-related crashes occur due to a [[stall (fluid mechanics)|stall]] close to the ground when the pilot gets caught by surprise by a thunderstorm-induced wind shift. Moreover, aircraft damage caused by thunderstorms is rarely in the form of structural failure due to turbulence but is typically less severe and the consequence of secondary effects of thunderstorms (e.g., denting by hail or paint removal by high-speed flight in torrential rain).

Thus, [[cumulonimbus]] are known to be extremely dangerous to air traffic, and it is recommended to avoid them as much as possible. Cumulonimbus can be extremely insidious, and an inattentive pilot can end up in a very dangerous situation while flying in apparently very calm air.

While there is a gradation with respect to thunderstorm severity, there is little quantitative difference between a significant shower generated by a [[cumulus congestus]] and a small thunderstorm with a few thunderclaps associated with a small cumulonimbus. For this reason, a glider pilot could exploit the rising air under a thunderstorm without recognising the situation - thinking instead that the rising air was due to a more benign variety of cumulus. However, forecasting thunderstorm severity is an inexact science; in numerous occasions, pilots got trapped by underestimating the severity of a thunderstorm that suddenly strengthened.

== General hazards to aircraft ==
Even large airliners avoid crossing the path of a cumulonimbus. Two dangerous effects of cumulonimbus have been put forward to explain the crash of flight [[AF447]] that sank into sea on the 31st of May 2009 about {{convert|600|km}} northeast of [[Brazil]]. It encountered a [[mesoscale convective system]] in the [[intertropical convergence zone]] (known by sailors as the "[[doldrums]]"), where cumulonimbus rise to more than {{convert|15|km|ft}} in altitude.&lt;ref name="tim_af447"&gt;{{Cite web

However, the aircraft did not disintegrate in flight. A different hypothesis was put forward and later confirmed: accumulation of ice on the aircraft's [[pitot tube]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The inconsistency between the airspeeds measured by the different sensors is one of the causes of the accident according to the final report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The US [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] recommends that aircraft (including gliders) stay at least 20 nautical miles away from a severe thunderstorm, while a glider pilot could be tempted to use the [[updraught]]s below and inside the cloud. There are two sorts of danger for this type of aircraft. One is related to the [[Wind shear|shear]] effects between [[updraught]]s and [[downdraught]]s inside the cloud - effects that can smash the glider. This shear creates a [[Kelvin-Helmholtz instability]] that can generate extremely violent sub-vortices. The second danger is more insidious: the strong updraughts below a supercell cumulonimbus can cover a large area and contain little or no turbulence as explained below. In this case, the glider can be [[cloud suck|sucked]] into the cloud, where the pilot can quickly lose visual reference to the ground, causing conditions to quickly become [[Instrument meteorological conditions|IMC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In these conditions, the aircraft (if not equipped for IMC flight and flown by a pilot experienced in IMC flight) is likely to enter a [[graveyard spiral]] and eventually break up by exceeding the wing load limit. In this situation, the cause of the disintegration of the aircraft is not [[atmospheric turbulence]] but is the inability of the pilot to control the aircraft following the loss of visual reference to the ground. In the case of an [[instrument flight]], cumulonimbus can catch a pilot by surprise when embedded in a more benign cloud mass. For example, [[nimbostratus]] can originate from the spreading of a cumulonimbus (''nimbostratus cumulonimbogenitus''), making the presence of active convective cells likely. Small private airplanes are generally not equipped with on-board [[weather radar]]s; and during an IFR approach, they can be sent accidentally by [[air traffic control]] to non-obvious active cells.

== Updraught characteristics ==

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The updraught under the cloud is mostly due to [[buoyancy]], but there is also a large pressure difference between the base and the top of the cumulonimbus (larger than would be found in this height range outside the cloud) and local low-level mechanical lifting such as the lifting generated by a [[downburst]]. The two last phenomena can overcome a stable air zone close to the surface by lifting cooler air parcels to a level where they are eventually warmer than the surrounding air. This can happen if these mechanical phenomena lift the parcel above the [[lifted condensation level]] (LCL), above which height the parcel's temperature ''T&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;(z)'' decreases less with height (due to the release of [[latent heat]] and at approximately 6.5 K/km) than the surrounding air temperature ''T&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;(z)'' decreases with height in the case of a conditionally unstable lapse rate aloft. In other words, the parcel can be lifted to a height where &lt;math&gt;\left|{dT_p(z) \over d z}\right| &lt; \left|{dT_s(z) \over d z}\right|&lt;/math&gt;, where the former is the cooling rate of the parcel and the latter is the ambient lapse rate. In these conditions, the rising parcel may eventually become warmer than the surrounding air; in other words, there may exist a level above which &lt;math&gt;T_p(z) &gt; T_s(z)&lt;/math&gt;. This scenario's conditionally unstable lapse rate aloft is relatively common when thunderstorms exist. In effect, at low level, such air parcels are sucked into the cloud as if by a [[vacuum cleaner]]. Soaring pilots refer to this near-base sucking as "[[cloud suck]]", a phenomenon known to generally be more intense the taller the cumulus cloud - and to thus be at maximum intensity with a cumulonimbus. Since the dynamic updraught is wide, the updraught velocity varies little laterally and thus the turbulence is minimised.&lt;ref name="Cotton"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cotton|1989|ref= Cotton| page= 472}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Knupp&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that the updraft air entering the base of cumulonimbi is smooth and relatively free of turbulence and remains so through a significant depth of the [[Weak echo region|WER]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cotton|2011|ref=Cotton|page= 331}}&lt;/ref&gt;''|sign=|source=}}In fact, Ellrod and Marwitz's paper&lt;ref name=Ellrod/&gt; is more general. These authors state that in general, the buoyancy beneath the cumulonimbus cloud base is often negative. This explains why updraughts underneath the base of a cumulonimbus are often ''laminar''. This phenomenon is well known by glider pilots.&lt;ref name=Musto&gt;{{Harvnb|Musto|2014|ref=Musto|page= 116}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see below). The phenomenon is enhanced under the [[weak echo region]] of a [[supercell thunderstorm]] that is ''extremely dangerous''. At approximately {{convert|4|km|feet}} these smooth updraughts become suddenly very turbulent.&lt;ref name=Knupp/&gt;&lt;ref name=Delore/&gt;

In general, updraughts reach their maximum intensity at {{convert|6|km|ft}} above the ground. At this altitude, a phase change occurs where water droplets become ice crystals and therefore release energy in the form of latent heat and thus the updraught strength increases. [[Supercell thunderstorm]]s or [[derecho]]s can have gigantic updraughts at this altitude, updraughts with speeds that can exceed {{convert|40|m/s|knot}}. Such an updraught speed corresponds to the wind speed of a small [[hurricane]]. The speed can even exceed {{convert|50|m/s|knot}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bluestein|2013|ref= Bluestein |page=
 112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum number in the [[Beaufort scale]] is 12 ("hurricane force" wind) and is assigned to wind speeds of 64&amp;nbsp;[[knot (unit)|knot]]s or greater. If the Beaufort scale were extended, these updraughts would have a Beaufort number of 14 ''in the vertical direction''. The turbulence is then ''extreme'' at this altitude.&lt;ref name=Knupp/&gt;

Moreover, the diameters of the updraught columns vary between 2&amp;nbsp;km (air mass thunderstorm) and 10&amp;nbsp;km (supercell thunderstorm).&lt;ref name="Cotton2"/&gt; The height of the cumulonimbus base is extremely variable. It varies from a few tens of metres above the ground to 4000&amp;nbsp;m above the ground. In the latter case, the updraughts can originate either from the ground (if the air is very dry - typical of deserts) or from aloft (when [[altocumulus castellanus]] degenerates into cumulonimbus). When the updraught originates from aloft, this is considered ''elevated convection''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Dangers pertaining to downbursts ==
''Detailed article: [[Downburst]]
[[File:micro-rafale.png|thumb|upright=2|'''Figure 2: ''' Spreading of a downburst close to the ground.]]
Downbursts are dangerous for many reasons.&lt;ref name=Musto2&gt;{{Harvnb|Musto|2014ref= Musto | p= 115}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, downdraughts under cumulonimbus can be severe and extensive. A sailplane flying at 50 knots in a downdraught of 15 knots has an approximate glide ratio of 3, meaning that it covers only about three metres of ground for every metre it descends. Assuming that the glider is at cloud base height at {{convert|2000|m|ft}}, if it remains in the downdraught the entire time, it will only be able to glide {{convert|6|km}} before being forced to land - likely under difficult and dangerous conditions. Even if the glider lands safely, it could be destroyed later by a wind gust. So when a rain curtain shows a downburst, it is of paramount importance to not land in this area.

Downdraughts of 50&amp;nbsp;knots are possible and can generate wind gusts of 60&amp;nbsp;knots or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bradbury|1996||ref= Bradbury
| p= 71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Safely landing a light aircraft in these conditions can be virtually impossible. Moreover, close to the ground, a glider or airplane pilot can be caught by surprise by a sudden reversal of the wind direction and transition from an upwind to a downwind situation. If the airspeed becomes too low, the aircraft will [[stall (aerodynamics)|stall]] and may crash into the ground due to the altitude lost recovering from the stall. As a consequence of famous instances of crashes of this nature in the [[United States]], a network of [[wind profiler]]s and [[Terminal Doppler Weather Radar]]s was developed in the vicinity of airports to monitor this wind shear. Based on FAA rules, every pilot must inquire about the wind speed and direction before landing.

Compared to airliners, sailplanes fly at low airspeeds. The usual approach speed of a sailplane is around 50&amp;nbsp;knots, but let's assume that the pilot is extra "careful" and flies his approach at 65&amp;nbsp;knots. William Cotton claims that the wind shear can be as high as 50&amp;nbsp;knots. In such a case, if the shear direction is such that the airspeed is reduced by the shear amount, this pilot's airspeed will drop to 15&amp;nbsp;knots, which is well below his glider's stall speed (typically 35‚Äì40 knots). If this airspeed drop occurs during the transition from the [[base leg]] to the [[final approach (aviation)|final approach]], the aircraft may enter into a [[Spin (aerodynamics)|spin]] from which there isn't enough altitude to recover. The exact quotation is the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cotton|2011|ref= Cotton | p= 340}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quotation|''Upon encountering a downburst with say a 50 kt tailwind component, airspeed can drop from say 65 kts to more like 15 kts. If the sailplane is making a turn from baseleg to final, the pilot finds himself (herself) in one of the deadliest situations a pilot can encounter, a "stall-spin" situation with no chance to recover since the aircraft is close to the ground on final approach.''}}

So when the pilot encounters benign cumulonimbus, it may be a better choice to stay aloft and use the updraughts under the [[Cumulus cloud|cumulus]] in front of the [[thunderstorm]] along the [[flanking line (meteorology)|flanking line]] (or even under the cumulonimbus itself in its laminar region) and wait for the thunderstorm to dissipate instead of attempting a landing in the presence of possible [[downburst]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pagen|1993|ref= Pagen1993 | p= 36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flight inside cumulonimbus ==

=== Soaring ===

In some countries, sailplanes are permitted to fly inside clouds. For example, during the 1972 World Soaring Championship at [[Vr≈°ac]], Yugoslavia, [[Helmut Reichmann]] attempted to use the violent updraughts associated with cumulonimbus.&lt;ref name="Reichman"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reichman|1975|ref= Reichman | p= 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, he found an updraught of +8&amp;nbsp;m/s. After half a circle, he was in a downdraught of ‚àí15&amp;nbsp;m/s. He had to land very shortly afterward. The thunderstorm was in its mature stage. In another example, Terry Delore got trapped in a severe thunderstorm. He entered a seemingly innocuous [[cumulus cloud|cumulus]] at {{convert|2000|ft|m}}. This cumulus evolved into a large cumulonimbus. At first, the flight inside the cloud was turbulence-free. Then his glider suddenly became uncontrollable. He was either inverted, in a nosedive, or in a chandelle. The airbrakes became stuck open due to hailstones blocking the orifices. When he landed, the [[airfield]] was still covered by hailstones. The wind gusts were between 30 and 40&amp;nbsp;knots. Everyone on the ground feared for the pilot's life.&lt;ref name=Delore&gt;{{Harvnb|Delore|2005|ref= Delore | p= 124}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same book, the author narrates that an Italian instructor at [[Rieti]] had his students climb {{convert|10000|m|ft}} inside cumulonimbus so that they get accustomed to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Delore|2005|ref=Delore | p= 129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned above, a climb inside a cumulonimbus can be initially very smooth (due to the negative buoyancy of the air parcel) and suddenly become horribly turbulent. As an example, a glider pilot found initially very laminar updraughts and got sucked into the cloud where he encountered accelerations of ''18&amp;nbsp;g'' and [[coma|became unconscious]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|access-date=2013-05-10
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the phase change of water droplets (to ice), the cumulonimbus top is almost always turbulent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bradbury|1996|ref= Bradbury | p= 73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the glider can become covered with ice, and the controls can freeze and remain stuck. Many accidents of this kind have occurred. If the pilot bails out and opens his parachute, he may be sucked upward (or at least held aloft) as happened to [[William Rankin]] after ejecting from an F-8 fighter jet and falling into a cumulonimbus (within which his parachute opened).&lt;ref name="cloudbook"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cloudspotter's Guide |last=Pretor-Pinney |first=Gavin |publisher=The Cloud Appreciation Society |isbn=978-0-340-89589-4 |pages=320 pg|year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[skydiver]] or [[Paraglider|paraglider pilot]] under a cumulonimbus is exposed to a potentially deadly risk of being rapidly sucked up to the top the cloud and being suffocated, struck by lightning, or frozen. If he survives, he may suffer irreversible brain damage due to lack of oxygen or an amputation as a consequence of [[frostbite]]. German paraglider pilot [[Ewa Wi≈õnierska]] barely survived a climb of more than {{convert|9000|m|ft}} inside a cumulonimbus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Musto|2014|ref=Musto|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Commercial aviation ===

Heavy transportation airplanes may occasionally have to cross a thunderstorm line associated with a [[cold front]] or a [[squall]]. They may not be able to overfly the cumulonimbus, because at 36000 feet, the aircraft may be in or near what is known as the [[coffin corner (aviation)|coffin corner]] (stall speed  = Vne), thus making it structurally dangerous to climb higher. However, some cells can rise to 70000 feet. Another option would be to navigate around the cells. This is strongly discouraged, however, because in the opening, new cells can grow very rapidly and engulf the aircraft.&lt;ref name=IMC&gt;{{Harvnb|Buck|2013|ref=Buck|page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whenever an aircraft moves to the west and crosses a thunderstorm line, the pilot will first encounter a line of powerful and laminar updraughts (that are not thermal but dynamic). The pilot should refrain from pushing the stick to try to maintain a constant altitude (similar to [[mountain wave]]s), because pushing the stick can cause his airspeed to increase to the point of hitting the yellow arc (on the airspeed indicator). An airspeed this high is not permissible in turbulent conditions and may lead to break-up of the aircraft.&lt;ref name=IMC/&gt; Indeed, when the pilot exits the updraught zone, he will encounter very strong turbulence due to the shear between rising and sinking air. If the airspeed is too high at this point, the airplane will break apart. The crash of [[Flight AF 447]] is indirectly related to this situation: the pilot, being short on fuel, opted for the shortest path while crossing the thunderstorm line associated with the [[intertropical convergence zone]], and the pitot tubes iced over. What followed is known.

On-board radars can be deceiving. Hail shafts generate weak radar echoes and are significantly more dangerous than [[cloudburst]]s. Close to the ground, heavy rain (or snow at altitude) tends to dampen turbulence (it is said that when rain comes, most of the danger is gone). So a counter intuitive recommendation exists: it is better to fly toward the zone of heavy [[precipitation]] or toward the darkest area of the thunderstorm line.&lt;ref name=IMC2&gt;{{Harvnb|Buck|2013|ref=Buck|page=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; This recommendation contradicts the usual use of on-board radars to avoid areas of strong precipitation, which is usually the best course of action. There is no "miracle" solution, and the best option is to avoid these thunderstorm systems by having enough fuel on board, thus reducing the temptation to take a more dangerous route in the interest of fuel savings.

Also, [[St Elmo's fire]]s while flying inside cumulonimbus can burn out the on-board electronic equipment and even pierce a wing by melting the metal skin.&lt;ref name=IMC2/&gt;

== Dangers pertaining to supercell thunderstorms  ==

''See detailed article'' [[supercell thunderstorm]]
[[File:Supercell-cumulonimbus fr.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|'''Figure 3 :''' Picture of a supercell with its characteristics]]
[[File:Shelfcloud.jpg|thumb|'''Figure 4 :''' Picture of the forward area of a supercell that ''seems'' usable by a glider. It is made of small cumulonimbus and an [[arcus cloud|arcus]]. This area is treacherous because the updraughts will be laminar.]]
The updraughts inside a cumulonimbus associated with a supercell thunderstorm can reach {{Convert|45|m/s|kn}}.&lt;ref name=Cotton2&gt;{{Harvnb|Cotton|1989|ref=Cotton|p= 466}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Musto2/&gt; This corresponds to the wind speed of a weak [[hurricane]]. Moreover, the [[Atmospheric turbulence|turbulence]] inside a cloud can become extreme and break apart an aircraft. Thus, it is extremely dangerous to fly inside such a monster.

The thunderstorm system can be divided into two zones in the figure to the left: the precipitation-free zone, located on the left where the airmass has a widespread up motion, and the precipitation zone, on the right where the airmass is sinking. At the point where the two zones meet, there is a [[wall cloud]] that could initiate [[tornado]]es. Moreover, even the cumulus congestus associated with a supercell thunderstorm can be very dangerous. Tornadoes can be produced up to {{convert|36|km|mi}} from the main cell.&lt;ref name="Cotton3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cotton|1989|ref= Cotton | p= 535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the updraught area, the air has a negative buoyancy and is sucked up by a low pressure zone at altitude. Turbulence is annihilated.&lt;ref name="Cotton" /&gt; In particular, in the forward area of the supercell, one can find a [[Flanking line (meteorology)|flanking line]] made of [[cumulus congestus]] or small [[cumulonimbus]]. It should be noted that the [[cloud base]] of the flanking line is higher than the base of the main cumulonimbus.

Since the updraught under these clouds (in the flanking line) is mainly dynamic, the airmass being smooth and the cloud base higher, a [[glider (aircraft)|glider]] pilot could be tempted to fly in this zone. However, conditions can rapidly become dangerous, since the [[wall cloud]] can generate a [[tornado]] that will pulverise any aircraft. Moreover, since the rising air is widespread, the glider pilot (especially if flying a low-speed, low-performance glider like a paraglider) may be unable to escape and may be sucked into the cloud up to its top. Thus, the FAA recommends that aircraft should never be closer than 20&amp;nbsp;miles from severe thunderstorms.

== Other dangers pertaining to cumulonimbus ==

=== Lightning ===

Although it rarely happens, a glider can be struck by lightning. Metal sailplanes are [[Faraday cage]]s and thus should not be destroyed by a lightning strike. However, gliders made of wood or fibreglass can be destroyed. Moreover, modern sailplanes are filled with electronic devices that can be damaged by lightning. Also, any winch launch must be prohibited when a thunderstorm is less than {{convert|20|km|mi}} away. Indeed, the air is electrified, and the cable will act as a [[lightning rod]].

=== Hail ===

Hail can shred a sailplane canopy and seriously damage the wings and fuselage. Hail is barely visible and can be encountered in the updraught zone under the cloud. On August 5, 1977, an airplane pilot was taken by surprise in the vicinity of [[Colorado Springs]] by a [[supercell thunderstorm]] that produced 20 tornadoes. The pilot was flying in eerily calm air (the updraught zone can be laminar) when he saw the sky transitioning from pale grey to inky black. The pilot heard a loud sound that reoccurred more and more frequently. Then a hailstone pierced the windshield, rendering the pilot semi-unconscious. Eventually, the pilot landed his shredded airplane in a field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== Tornadoes ===
An EF5 tornado can generate ground winds of unbelievable speed; common sense dictates that an aircraft should never be close to such a meteorological phenomenon. Indeed the wind speed can reach {{convert|130|m/s|knot}}, and one can easily guess that the aircraft can be torn into pieces in such conditions. However, airline transportation aircraft have overflown tornadoes&lt;ref name=Tornado&gt;{{Harvnb|Buck|2013|ref=Buck|page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; by more than {{convert|8000|ft|m}} without damage. The fact that an airliner does not get destroyed can be explained as follows: tornadoes are violent phenomena only close to the ground and become weaker at height. A glider dared to cross a weak tornado during a soaring contest in [[Texas]] in 1967.&lt;ref name=Tornado/&gt; The cumulonimbus base was at {{convert|12000|ft|m}}. The glider crossed an extremely turbulent zone and ended up in a turbulence-free zone inverted. The controls were not responding, and the pilot contemplated abandoning the aircraft. After some time and a big fright, the controls started to respond again, and the pilot was able to continue his flight. Pilots in the vicinity did not notice anything.

On the 6th of October 1981 a Fokker aircraft hit a tornado which occurred in a supercell near the town of Moerdijk in the Netherlands, all 17 occupants of the aircraft were killed.

An empirical criterion for tornado formation has been developed by Dan Sowa from [[Northwest Orient Airlines]] as follows: the cumulonimbus [[overshooting top]] must enter into the stratosphere by at least 10000&amp;nbsp;feet.&lt;ref name=Tornado/&gt; This criterion is, however, incorrect and the [[:fr:tornade de Sonnac du 16 septembre 2015|Sonnac tornado]] is a counter-example. It reached level EF2 while being generated by a small cumulonimbus that did not attain {{convert|9000|m|ft}}.

== Myths and truth about cumulonimbus ==
[[File: May 20, 2013 Moore, Oklahoma tornado.JPG|thumb|upright=2|'''Figure 5''' : Picture of a [[2013 Moore tornado|tornado]] in [[Oklahoma City|South Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]] shortly before it entered [[Moore, Oklahoma|Moore]] shot from a precipitation-free sunlit area. An absent-minded glider pilot would probably have found smooth and moderate updraughts in this sunlit zone.]]

=== Conventional wisdom ===

As a result of a [[faulty generalization|faulty generalisation]], it is very often incorrectly said that cumulonimbus and the updraughts under them are always turbulent. This [[fallacy]] originates from the fact that cumulonimbus are actually extremely turbulent at high altitude, and therefore, one might falsely deduce that cumulonimbus are turbulent at ''all'' altitudes. Reliable studies and glider pilots' experience have demonstrated that updraughts under cumulonimbus were generally smooth. As seen above, updraughts under a cumulonimbus are often ''dynamic'' and thus will be very smooth.  The phenomenon is enhanced under the [[weak echo region]] of a [[supercell thunderstorm]] that is ''extremely dangerous''. However, this phenomenon is little known in the aviation world. Thus, a widespread view in the aeronautical community is that cumulonimbus are always associated with very strong [[atmospheric turbulence|turbulence]] (at all altitudes) and severe thunderstorms. For example, Gil Roy, in a book endorsed by the [[:fr:F√©d√©ration fran√ßaise de vol √† voile]], claims that:

{{Quotation|''Les cumulo-nimbus [sic] sont le si√®ge de tr√®s violents orages. La partie avant, baptis√©e " front d'orage " est le th√©√¢tre de tr√®s fortes turbulences mais aussi de puissantes ascendances.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ('''Translation''': The cumulo-nimbus [sic] are always the seat of very violent thunderstorms. The forward area called thunderstorm front is the site of very strong turbulence but also of powerful updraughts.)}}

Also, the author talks about cumulo-nimbus [''sic''] of gigantic size that can reach a height of ''several thousand metres''. While the word "several" isn't very precise, a thickness of 8000 metres is fairly ''typical'' for a [[cumulonimbus]], with some as thick as 20000 metres or more. Moreover, the majority of cumulonimbus are associated with weak pulse thunderstorms or even simple showers without electric phenomena.

The reference to the thunderstorm front corresponds to the [[outflow boundary]] associated with [[downburst]]s that are indeed very dangerous and are the site of vortices associated with the [[Kelvin-Helmholtz instability]] at the junction between updraughts and downdraughts. However, in front of the thunderstorm, updraughts are generally laminar due to the negative buoyancy of air parcels (see above).

Also, the LUXORION web site&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
|language=french
|title=M√©t√©orologie √©l√©mentaire (Types d'thunderstorm II)

}}&lt;/ref&gt; states:

{{Quote|''Les cumulonimbus provoquent toujours une turbulence s√©v√®re [...] Elle peut √™tre rencontr√©e dans les basses couches et devancer le cumulonimbus de 10 √† 25&amp;nbsp;km.'' ('''Translation''': The cumulonimbus always generate a severe turbulence [...]. It can be encountered in the lower layers and get ahead of the cumulonimbus by 10 to 25&amp;nbsp;km.)}}

Such a claim is too broad and again contradicts the fact that updraughts in front of a thunderstorm are often laminar. However, it is true that the upper layers are almost always turbulent. However, in most cases, the aforesaid turbulence is not extreme. Along the same lines, Didier Morieux&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
|language=french

{{quote|''Le cumulonimbus [...] est aussi le si√®ge d'ascendances et de descendances pouvant atteindre des vitesses de 15 √† 20&amp;nbsp;m/s donnant lieu √† une turbulence consid√©rable, susceptible de mettre en p√©ril la structure des avions les plus solides.''('''Translation''': The cumulonimbus is also the site of updraughts and downdraughts of speeds of 15 to 20&amp;nbsp;m/s generating considerable turbulence, likely to imperil the structure of most robust airplanes.)}}

Dennis Pagen is even more explicit. He states:

{{Quote|sign=|source=|''All the updrafts and downdrafts in a thunderstorm create considerable turbulence due to shear. All we have to do is think of the velocities involved and you can imagine the severity of the turbulence. Thunderstorm turbulence can (and has) tear apart airplanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pagen|1992|ref= Pagen1992 | p= 245}}&lt;/ref&gt;''}}

The [[International cloud atlas]] soothes these claims: it simply states that "''la turbulence is often very strong'' " below the cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

=== Serious hazard to glider pilots ===

A glider pilot convinced that cumulonimbus are always violent risks getting a nasty surprise. If he flies under the flanking line of a [[supercell thunderstorm]] and finds that the air is very smooth and updraughts are moderate, he may falsely infer that he is safe and not under a cumulonimbus; since cumulonimbus are, officially, always turbulent. He may thus not realise when he is under a secondary cumulonimbus that can suck him inside the cloud, and he may encounter a [[wall cloud]] that could generate a [[tornado]] that could disentegrate his fragile skiff as shown in Figure 5. Dominique Musto cautions [[paraglider]] pilots (that might otherwise be swayed by the above myth) against the false sensation of safety in a region of extended updraughts that are rather weak as follows:

{{Quotation|''Pourtant malgr√© un ciel sombre et l'absence de soleil, les ascendances sont douces et g√©n√©ralis√©es dans tout le secteur. '''Quelque chose cloche !''' Si nous ne r√©agissons pas tr√®s vite pour descendre, une main invisible risque de nous happer et de nous jeter en enfer !''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

This quotation summarises in three sentences the often-insidious dangers associated with cumulonimbus, dangers that are exacerbated for paraglider pilots, as German paraglider pilot [[Ewa Wi≈õnierska]] experienced. She survived climbing above {{convert|9000|m|ft}} inside a cumulonimbus. A nearby fellow pilot caught in the same weather event wasn't so fortunate.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/lightning-killed-paraglider/2007/02/20/1171733745020.html Lightning killed paraglider]'', [[Sydney Morning Herald]], 20 f√©vrier 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CBS&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/02/16/world/main2486010.shtml ''Paraglider Cheats Death In Thunderstorm'', CBS News]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forerunners of a thunderstorm ==
The above quotation puts informally the harbingers of a thunderstorm. So a cumulonimbus acts as an enormous thermal machine that sucks up the air in the front (left side of Figure 3) and violently throws it out in the back through [[downburst]]s (right side of Figure 3). Consequently, a broad area of updraughts will be located in front of the thunderstorm. Typically, in a humid airmass, the updraughts will be on the order of 1&amp;nbsp;m/s; and in a dry air mass, they will be on the order of 2 to 3&amp;nbsp;m/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pagen|1992|ref= Pagen1992 | p= 250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, when a glider pilot is in an area where "updraughts are everywhere" and he is close to large clouds (that can be [[cumulus congestus]]), he is likely in the vicinity of a building thunderstorm.

== Associated gravity waves ==
The [[downburst]]s associated with cumulonimbus can generate [[gravity wave]]s far way from [[thunderstorms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cotton|2011|iref= Cotton | pp=352‚Äì360}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These gravity waves can be felt up to {{convert|50|km|mi}} away and in some conditions several hundreds of kilometres away. A severe thunderstorm generating these gravity waves located at more than {{convert|40|km|mi}} away (according to [[Federal Aviation Administration]] recommendations) should not affect the safety of aircraft this far from the thunderstorm. These gravity waves can be modelled in the same manner as [[mountain waves]] and can be usable by a [[glider (aircraft)|glider]] pilot.

== Utilising cumulonimbus in cross-country flight or other ==

=== Exploitation of "small" cumulonimbus ===

Small cumulonimbus can relatively safely be exploited by experienced glider pilots. They generate moderate updraughts that are generally laminar and that are pleasant and enlightening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
|title=The Soaring Pilot's Manual Second Edition
|author=Ken Stewart
|page=38
|year=2008
|publisher=The Crowood Press
|isbn= 978-1-84797-044-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, pulse-like summer thunderstorms can be used during cross-country flights,&lt;ref name=Eckey/&gt; since the glider will move away from the cumulonimbus after having (in theory) climbed up to 500&amp;nbsp;feet below the cloud base (the maximum permissible height in the [[United States]]) and the passage of the glider in the proximity of the thunderstorm will be short. For example, during an official contest of the  [[Soaring Society of America]], pilots openly played with the cumulonimbus (and even with the updraughts contiguous to [[downburst]]s) and boasted about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, a rule of thumb says that the distance between two thermals is equal to three times the height of the cloud. Consequently, a cumulonimbus that is 13&amp;nbsp;km thick will eliminate any convective activity over a radius of approximately 40&amp;nbsp;km. Most gliders cannot perform such long glides, and therefore, an encounter with a pulse-like thunderstorm in a glider will often be followed soon by the end of the flight.

=== Shear exploitation in the vicinity of a downburst ===

Figure 3.22 from this reference&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bluestein|2013|ref= Bluestein | p= 124}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows the presence of a [[Rotor (meteorology)|rotor]] outside a [[downburst]]. A more-than-foolhardy pilot could easily locate this updraught and exploit it. However, this photograph will dissuade any sensible pilot from using such monstrosities. Actually, downbursts are the most significant hazard pertaining
to thunderstorms. Moreover, if for any reason the pilot must land (hail storm or other), he will have to cross the [[downburst]] immediately above him and there will be a greatly increased chance of crashing - due to the unpredictable decrease of the airspeed. Moreover, if the glider transitions from the updraught to the downdraught, severe turbulence will occur due to the [[Kelvin-Helmholtz instability]] in the shear area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Exploitation of flanking lines ===

Reckless pilots have exploited [[squall]]s by flying in front of thunderstorm systems as if flying along a [[ridge lift|ridge]]. The pilot really must land at an [[airport]] and put the glider in a hangar; the squall line will catch him again soon and imperil the glider if it is not protected.&lt;ref name="Reichman2"&gt;{{Harvnb| Reichman|1975|ref= Reichman | p= 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dennis Pagen performed a similar flight in front of a [[Supercell thunderstorm|supercell]] cumulonimbus during the Preliminaries of the [[hang glider]] 1990 World championship in [[Brazil]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pagen|1992|ref= Pagen1992
| p= 244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pagen|1993|ref= Pagen1993 | p= 35}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he was able to fly 35&amp;nbsp;km at high speed without a turn. The author acknowledges that his achievement was dubious, since hang gliders (and even more so [[paraglider]]s) are significantly slower than [[sailplane]]s and can much more easily be [[cloud suck|sucked inside the cloud]].

== Conclusion ==
The only cumulonimbus clouds that could be usable by a glider pilot, subject to all necessary reservations,  might be isolated small cumulonimbus or at a pinch the flanking lines associated with strong thunderstorms. However, examples above show that a seemingly innocuous cloud can rapidly become very dangerous. [[Squall]]s and [[supercell thunderstorm]]s are definitely deadly hazards to uninformed pilots. Based on [[visual flight]] rules, flights in pre-storm areas must be visual; the pilots must be able to watch the evolution of a thundercloud and take the necessary actions of avoidance or to quickly land when appropriate.

The above examples demonstrate that the different phenomena associated with cumulonimbus can jeopardise any type of aircraft and its occupants when the pilot flies in the vicinity and especially inside a thundercloud. An airplane pilot should '''never''' come near a cumulonimbus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35913">The intent of this article is to highlight the important points of the '''derivation of the [[Navier‚ÄìStokes equations]]''' as well as its application and formulation for different families of [[fluid]]s.

==Basic assumptions==

The Navier‚ÄìStokes equations are based on the assumption that the fluid, at the scale of interest, is a [[Continuum (set theory)|continuum]], in other words is not made up of discrete particles but rather a continuous substance. Another necessary assumption is that all the [[Field (mathematics)|fields]] of interest like [[pressure]], [[flow velocity]], [[density]], and [[temperature]] are [[Differentiable function|differentiable]], [[Weak derivative|weakly]] at least.

The equations are derived from the basic principles of [[Continuity equation#fluid dynamics|continuity of mass]], [[Conservation of momentum|momentum]], and [[Conservation of energy|energy]]. For that matter, sometimes it is necessary to consider a finite arbitrary volume, called a [[control volume]], over which these principles can be applied. This finite volume is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; and its bounding surface &lt;math&gt;\partial \Omega&lt;/math&gt;. The control volume can remain fixed in space or can move with the fluid.

==The material derivative==
{{main|material derivative}}

Changes in properties of a moving fluid can be measured in two different ways. One can measure a given property by either carrying out the measurement on a fixed point in space as particles of the fluid pass by, or by following a parcel of fluid along its [[Streamlines, streaklines and pathlines|streamline]]. The derivative of a field with respect to a fixed position in space is called the ''Eulerian'' derivative while the derivative following a moving parcel is called the ''advective'' or ''material'' ("Lagrangian" &lt;ref&gt;Munson, Bruce R. Fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics. 7th. Jefferson City: John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;) derivative.

The material derivative is defined as the ''[[nonlinear operator]]'':

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{D}{Dt} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; is the flow velocity. The first term on the right-hand side of the equation is the ordinary Eulerian derivative (i.e. the derivative on a fixed reference frame, representing changes at a point with respect to time) whereas the second term represents changes of a quantity with respect to position (see [[advection]]). This "special" derivative is in fact the ordinary derivative of a function of many variables along a path following the fluid motion; it may be derived through application of the [[chain rule]] in which all independent variables are checked for change along the path (i.e. the [[total derivative]]).

For example, the measurement of changes in wind velocity in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] can be obtained with the help of an [[anemometer]] in a weather station or by observing the movement of a weather balloon. The anemometer in the first case is measuring the velocity of all the moving particles passing through a fixed point in space, whereas in the second case the instrument is measuring changes in velocity as it moves with the flow.

==Continuity equations==
The Navier‚ÄìStokes equation is a special [[continuity equation]]. A continuity equation may be derived from [[conservation laws|conservation principles]] of:

* [[Mass]]
* [[Momentum]]
* [[Energy]]

This is done via the [[continuity equation]], an integral relation stating that the rate of change of some integrated property &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; defined over a control volume &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; must be equal to what amount is lost or gained through the boundaries &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; of the volume plus what is created or consumed by sources and sinks inside the volume. This is expressed by the following integral continuity equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\int_{\Omega} \phi \ d\Omega = -\int_{\Gamma} \phi \mathbf{u\cdot n} \ d\Gamma - \int_{\Omega} s \ d\Omega&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; is the flow velocity of the fluid, &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{n} &lt;/math&gt; is the outward-pointing unit-normal vector, and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; represents the sources and sinks in the flow, taking the sinks as positive.

The [[divergence theorem]] may be applied to the [[surface integral]], changing it into a [[volume integral]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{d t} \int_{\Omega}  \phi \ d\Omega = -\int_{\Omega} \nabla \cdot ( \phi \mathbf u) \ d\Omega - \int_{\Omega} s \ d\Omega.&lt;/math&gt;

Applying [[Reynolds transport theorem]] to the integral on the left and then combining all of the integrals:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\Omega} \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} \ d\Omega = - \int_{\Omega}\nabla \cdot (\phi\mathbf u) \ d\Omega - \int_{\Omega} s \ d\Omega
\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad
\int_{\Omega} \left( \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\phi\mathbf u) + s\ \right) d\Omega = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The integral must be zero for '''any''' control volume; this can only be true if the integrand itself is zero, so that:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\phi \mathbf u) + s = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

From this valuable relation (a very generic [[continuity equation]]), three important concepts may be concisely written: conservation of mass, conservation of momentum, and conservation of energy. Validity is retained if  &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a vector, in which case the vector-vector product in the second term will be a [[Dyadic product|dyad]].

===Momentum equation===

A general momentum equation is obtained when the conservation relation is applied to momentum. If the intensive property &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;; considered is the [[mass flux]] (also ''momentum density''), i.e. the product of [[mass density]] and [[flow velocity]] &lt;math&gt;\rho \mathbf u&lt;/math&gt;, by substitution in the general continuum equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\rho \mathbf u) + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf u \mathbf u) =  \mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \mathbf u&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Dyadic product|dyad]], a special case of [[tensor product]], which results in a second rank tensor; the [[divergence]] of a second rank tensor is again a vector (a first rank tensor).&lt;ref name="TA"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 

Using the formula for the divergence of a dyad, 

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot (\mathbf a \mathbf b) =  (\nabla \cdot \mathbf a)\mathbf b + \mathbf a\cdot \nabla \mathbf b&lt;/math&gt;

we then have

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \rho \frac{\partial \mathbf u}{\partial t} + \mathbf u \mathbf u \cdot \nabla \rho + 
\rho \mathbf u \cdot \nabla \mathbf u + \rho \mathbf u \nabla \cdot \mathbf u = \mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the [[gradient]] of a vector is a special case of the [[covariant derivative]], the operation results in second rank tensors;&lt;ref name="TA"/&gt; except in Cartesian coordinates, it's important to understand that this isn't simply an element by element gradient. Rearranging and recognizing that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \cdot \nabla \rho + \rho \nabla \cdot \mathbf u = \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf u)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \left(\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \mathbf u \cdot \nabla \rho + \rho \nabla \cdot \mathbf u\right) + \rho \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf u}{\partial t} + \mathbf u \cdot \nabla \mathbf u\right) = \mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \left(\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf u)\right) + \rho \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf u}{\partial t} + \mathbf u \cdot \nabla \mathbf u\right) = \mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt;

The leftmost expression enclosed in parentheses is, by mass continuity (shown in a moment), equal to zero. Noting that what remains on the left side of the equation is the [[Material derivative| material derivative]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf u}{\partial t} + \mathbf u \cdot \nabla \mathbf u\right) = \mathbf{s} &lt;/math&gt;

or, with the use of the material derivative operator previously defined:

:&lt;math&gt;\qquad \rho\frac{D \mathbf u}{D t} = \mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt;

This appears to simply be an expression of [[Newton's second law]] ('''F''' = ''m'''''a''') in terms of [[body force]]s instead of point forces. Each term in any case of the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations is a body force. A shorter though less rigorous way to arrive at this result would be the application of the [[chain rule]] to acceleration:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\rho \frac{d}{dt}(\mathbf u(x, y, z, t)) = \mathbf{s} \qquad &amp;\Rightarrow \qquad \rho \left(
\frac{\partial \mathbf u}{\partial t} + 
\frac{\partial \mathbf u}{\partial x}\frac{d x}{d t} + 
\frac{\partial \mathbf u}{\partial y}\frac{d y}{d t} + 
\frac{\partial \mathbf u}{\partial z}\frac{d z}{d t} 
\right) = \mathbf{s} \\
\qquad &amp;\Rightarrow \qquad \rho \left(
\frac{\partial \mathbf u}{\partial t} + 
u \frac{\partial \mathbf u}{\partial x} + 
v \frac{\partial \mathbf u}{\partial y} + 
w \frac{\partial \mathbf u}{\partial z} 
\right) = \mathbf{s} \\
\qquad &amp;\Rightarrow \qquad \rho \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf u}{\partial t} + \mathbf u \cdot \nabla \mathbf u\right) = \mathbf{s}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf u = (u, v, w)&lt;/math&gt;. The reason why this is "less rigorous" is that we haven't shown that the choice of

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u = \left(\frac{d x}{d t}, \frac{d y}{d t}, \frac{d z}{d t}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

is correct; however it does make sense since with that choice of path the derivative is "following" a fluid "particle", and in order for [[Newton's second law]] to work, forces must be summed following a particle. For this reason the [[convective derivative]] is also known as the particle derivative.

===Conservation of mass===

Mass may be considered also. Taking &lt;math&gt;S = 0&lt;/math&gt; (no sources or sinks of mass) and putting in density:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the mass density (mass per unit volume), and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; is the flow velocity. This equation is called the '''mass continuity equation''', or simply "the" continuity equation. This equation generally accompanies the Navier‚ÄìStokes equation.

In the case of an [[incompressible fluid]], &lt;math&gt;\frac{D\rho}{Dt}=0&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the density following the path of a fluid element is constant) and the equation reduces to:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

which is in fact a statement of the conservation of volume.

==Cauchy momentum equation==
{{see also|Cauchy momentum equation}}
The generic density of the momentum source &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt; seen previously is made specific first by breaking it up into two new terms, one to describe surface forces and one for body forces, such as gravity. By examining the forces acting on a small cube in a fluid, it may be shown that

:&lt;math&gt;\rho\frac{D\mathbf u}{D t} = \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} + \mathbf{f}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Cauchy stress tensor]], and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}&lt;/math&gt; accounts for body forces present. This equation is called the [[Cauchy momentum equation]] and describes the non-relativistic momentum conservation of ''any'' continuum that conserves mass. &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; is a rank two symmetric tensor given by its covariant components. In orthogonal coordinates in three dimensions it is represented as the 3x3 [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij} = \begin{pmatrix}
\sigma_{xx} &amp;  \tau_{xy} &amp; \tau_{xz} \\
\tau_{yx} &amp;  \sigma_{yy} &amp; \tau_{yz} \\
\tau_{zx} &amp;  \tau_{zy} &amp; \sigma_{zz}
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; are [[normal stress]]es and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; [[shear stress]]es. This matrix is split up into two terms:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij} = \begin{pmatrix}
\sigma_{xx} &amp;  \tau_{xy} &amp; \tau_{xz} \\
\tau_{yx} &amp;  \sigma_{yy} &amp; \tau_{yz} \\
\tau_{zx} &amp;  \tau_{zy} &amp; \sigma_{zz}
\end{pmatrix}
=
-\begin{pmatrix}
p &amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;p &amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;p 
\end{pmatrix}
+ 
\begin{pmatrix}
\sigma_{xx}+p &amp;  \tau_{xy} &amp; \tau_{xz} \\
\tau_{yx} &amp; \sigma_{yy}+p  &amp; \tau_{yz} \\
\tau_{zx} &amp;  \tau_{zy} &amp; \sigma_{zz}+p 
\end{pmatrix}
= -p I + \boldsymbol \tau
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the 3 x 3 [[identity matrix]] and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \tau&lt;/math&gt; is the [[deviatoric stress tensor]]. Note that the mechanical [[pressure]] ''p'' is equal to minus the mean normal stress:{{sfn| Batchelor|2000|pp=141}}

:&lt;math&gt;p = -\frac{1}{3} \left( \sigma_{xx} + \sigma_{yy} + \sigma_{zz} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

The motivation for doing this is that pressure is typically a variable of interest, and also this simplifies application to specific fluid families later on since the rightmost tensor &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \tau&lt;/math&gt; in the equation above must be zero for a fluid at rest. Note that &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \tau&lt;/math&gt; is [[traceless]]. The Cauchy equation may now be written in another more explicit form:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho\frac{D\mathbf u}{D t} = -\nabla p + \nabla \cdot\boldsymbol \tau + \mathbf{f}&lt;/math&gt;

This equation is still incomplete. For completion, one must make hypotheses on the forms of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \tau&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, that is, one needs a constitutive law for the stress tensor which can be obtained for specific fluid families and on the pressure. Some of these hypotheses bring to [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)]], other ones bring to Navier-Stokes equations. Additionally, if the flow is assumed compressible an equation of state will be required, which will likely further require a conservation of energy formulation.

==Application to different fluids==

The general form of the equations of motion is not "ready for use", the stress tensor is still unknown so that more information is needed; this information is normally some knowledge of the viscous behavior of the fluid. For different types of fluid flow this results in specific forms of the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations.

===Newtonian fluid===
{{main|Newtonian fluid}}

====Compressible Newtonian fluid====
The formulation for Newtonian fluids stems from an observation made by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] that, for most fluids,

:&lt;math&gt;\tau \propto \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}&lt;/math&gt;

In order to apply this to the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations, three assumptions were made by Stokes:

:* The stress tensor is a linear function of the [[strain rate tensor]] or equivalently the velocity gradient.
:* The fluid is isotropic.
:* For a fluid at rest, &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol \tau&lt;/math&gt; must be zero (so that [[hydrostatic pressure]] results).

The above list states the classic argument&lt;ref name="morse1968"&gt;Morse, P.M. and Ingard, K.U. "Theoretical Acoustics", ''Princeton University Press'' (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; that the shear strain rate tensor (i.e. the (symmetric) shear part of the velocity gradient) is a pure shear tensor and does not include any inflow/outflow part (i.e. any compression/expansion part). This means that its trace is zero, and this is achieved by subtracting &lt;math&gt; \nabla \! \cdot \! \mathbf{u} &lt;/math&gt; in a symmetric way from the diagonal elements of the tensor. The compressional contribution to viscous stress is added as a separate diagonal tensor.

Applying these assumptions will lead to :

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_{ij} = \mu\left(\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j} + \frac{\partial u_j}{\partial x_i} \right) + \delta_{ij} \lambda \frac{\partial u_k}{\partial x_k} &lt;/math&gt;

That is, the deviatoric of the deformation rate tensor is identified to the deviatoric of the stress tensor, up to a factor ''Œº''.&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Lifshitz, Fluid Mechanics, Second Edition: Volume 6 (Course of Theoretical Physics) page 45&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]]. ''Œº'' and ''Œª'' are proportionality constants associated with the assumption that stress depends on strain linearly; ''Œº'' is called the first coefficient of [[viscosity]] or shear viscosity (usually just called "viscosity") and ''Œª'' is the second coefficient of viscosity or [[volume viscosity]] (and it is related to [[bulk viscosity]]). The value of ''Œª'', which produces a viscous effect associated with volume change, is very difficult to determine, not even its sign is known with absolute certainty. Even in compressible flows, the term involving ''Œª'' is often negligible; however it can occasionally be important even in nearly incompressible flows and is a matter of controversy. When taken nonzero, the most common approximation is ''Œª''&amp;nbsp;‚âà&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;‚Öî&amp;nbsp;''Œº''.{{sfn |Batchelor|2000|pp=144}}

A straightforward substitution of &lt;math&gt;\tau_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; into the momentum conservation equation will yield the '''Navier‚ÄìStokes equations''', describing a compressible Newtonian fluid:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf u}{\partial t} + \mathbf u \cdot \nabla \mathbf u\right) = 
-\nabla p + \nabla \cdot \left[\mu (\nabla \mathbf u + (\nabla \mathbf u)^T)\right] 
+ \nabla \cdot \left[ \lambda  \left( \nabla \cdot \mathbf u \right) \mathbf I \right]
+ \rho \mathbf{g}&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[matrix transpose|transpose]] has been used. The body force has been decomposed into density and external acceleration, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f} = \rho \mathbf{g}&lt;/math&gt;. The associated mass continuity equation is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf u) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

In addition to this equation, an [[equation of state]] and an equation for the conservation of energy is needed. The equation of state to use depends on context (often the [[ideal gas law]]), the conservation of energy will read:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho \frac{D h}{D t} = \frac{D p}{D t} + \nabla \cdot (k \nabla T) + \Phi&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific enthalpy]], &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[temperature]], and &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is a function representing the dissipation of energy due to viscous effects:

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi = \mu \left(2\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right)^2 + 2\left(\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}\right)^2 + 2\left(\frac{\partial w}{\partial z}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial w}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial z}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial z} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial x}\right)^2\right) + \lambda (\nabla \cdot \mathbf u)^2&lt;/math&gt;

With a good equation of state and good functions for the dependence of parameters (such as viscosity) on the variables, this system of equations seems to properly model the dynamics of all known gases and most liquids.

====Incompressible Newtonian fluid====
For the special (but very common) case of incompressible flow, the momentum equations simplify significantly. Taking into account the following assumptions:
*Viscosity &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; will now be a constant
*The second viscosity effect &lt;math&gt;\lambda = 0&lt;/math&gt;
*The simplified mass continuity equation &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf u = 0&lt;/math&gt;
then looking at the viscous terms of the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; momentum equation for example we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 &amp;\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(2 \mu \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \lambda \nabla \cdot \mathbf u\right) + 
 \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(\mu\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}\right)\right) + 
 \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\left(\mu\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial z} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial x}\right)\right) \\  \\
 &amp; = 
 2 \mu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + 
 \mu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} + \mu \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial y \, \partial x} + 
 \mu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial z^2} + \mu \frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial z \, \partial x} \\  \\
 &amp; = 
 \mu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + 
 \mu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} + 
 \mu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial z^2} + 
 \mu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \mu \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial y \, \partial x} + \mu \frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial z \,  \partial x} \\  \\
 &amp; = \mu \nabla^2 u + \mu \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \cancelto{0}{\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial z}\right)} = \mu \nabla^2 u
\end{align}\,&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly for the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; momentum directions we have &lt;math&gt;\mu \nabla^2 v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu \nabla^2 w&lt;/math&gt;.

The above solution is key to deriving [[Navier‚ÄìStokes equations|Navier-Stokes equations]] from Equation of motion in fluid dynamics when density and viscosity are constant.

===Non-Newtonian fluids===
{{main|Non-Newtonian fluid}}
A non-Newtonian fluid is a [[fluid]] whose flow properties differ in any way from those of [[Newtonian fluids]]. Most commonly the [[viscosity]] of non-Newtonian fluids is a function of  [[shear rate]] or shear rate history. However, there are some non-Newtonian fluids with shear-independent viscosity, that nonetheless exhibit normal stress-differences or other non-Newtonian behaviour. Many [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] solutions and molten [[polymers]] are non-Newtonian fluids, as are many commonly found substances such as [[ketchup]], [[custard]], [[toothpaste]], starch suspensions, [[paint]], [[blood]], and [[shampoo]]. In a Newtonian fluid, the relation between the [[shear stress]] and the [[shear rate]] is linear, passing through the origin, the constant of proportionality being the coefficient of viscosity. In a non-Newtonian fluid, the relation between the shear stress and the shear rate is different, and can even be time-dependent. The study of the non-Newtonian fluids is usually called [[rheology]]. A few examples are given here.

===Bingham fluid===
{{main|Bingham plastic}}

In Bingham fluids, the situation is slightly different:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = \left\{
\begin{matrix} 
0 &amp;, \quad \tau &lt; \tau_0 \\ 
(\tau - \tau_0)/ {\mu} &amp;, \quad \tau \ge \tau_0 
\end{matrix}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

These are fluids capable of bearing some shear before they start flowing. Some common examples are [[toothpaste]] and [[clay]].

===Power-law fluid===
{{main|Power-law fluid}}

A power law fluid is an idealised [[fluid]] for which the [[shear stress]], &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\tau = K \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\right)^n &lt;/math&gt;

This form is useful for approximating all sorts of general fluids, including shear thinning (such as latex paint) and shear thickening (such as corn starch water mixture).

==Stream function formulation==

In the analysis of a flow, it is often desirable to reduce the number of equations or the number of variables being dealt with, or both. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equation with mass continuity (four equations in four unknowns) can, in fact, be reduced to a single equation with a single dependent variable in 2D, or one vector equation in 3D. This is enabled by two [[vector calculus identities#Combinations of multiple operators|vector calculus identities]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times (\nabla \phi) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf{A}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

for any differentiable scalar &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; and vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;. The first identity implies that any term in the Navier-Stokes equation that may be represented as the gradient of a scalar will disappear when the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of the equation is taken. Commonly, pressure ''p'' and external acceleration '''g''' are what eliminate, resulting in (this is true in 2D as well as 3D):

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf u}{\partial t} + \mathbf u \cdot \nabla \mathbf u\right) = \nu \nabla \times (\nabla^2 \mathbf u)&lt;/math&gt;

where it's assumed that all body forces are describable as gradients (for example it is true for gravity), and density has been divided so that viscosity becomes [[kinematic viscosity]].

The second vector calculus identity above states that the divergence of the curl of a vector field is zero. Since the (incompressible) mass continuity equation specifies the divergence of flow velocity being zero, we can replace the flow velocity with the curl of some vector &lt;math&gt;\vec \psi&lt;/math&gt; so that mass continuity is always satisfied:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf u = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \vec \psi) = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

So, as long as flow velocity is represented through &lt;math&gt;\mathbf u = \nabla \times \vec \psi&lt;/math&gt;, mass continuity is unconditionally satisfied. With this new dependent vector variable, the Navier-Stokes equation (with curl taken as above) becomes a single fourth order vector equation, no longer containing the unknown pressure variable and no longer dependent on a separate mass continuity equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\nabla \times \vec \psi) + (\nabla \times \vec \psi) \cdot \nabla (\nabla \times \vec \psi)\right) = \nu \nabla \times (\nabla^2 (\nabla \times \vec \psi))&lt;/math&gt;

Apart from containing fourth order derivatives, this equation is fairly complicated, and is thus uncommon. Note that if the cross differentiation is left out, the result is a third order vector equation containing an unknown vector field (the gradient of pressure) that may be determined from the same boundary conditions that one would apply to the fourth order equation above.

===2D flow in orthogonal coordinates===

The true utility of this formulation is seen when the flow is two dimensional in nature and the equation is written in a general [[orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal coordinate system]], in other words a system where the basis vectors are orthogonal. Note that this by no means limits application to [[Cartesian coordinates]], in fact most of the common coordinates systems are orthogonal, including familiar ones like [[Cylindrical coordinates|cylindrical]] and obscure ones like [[Toroidal coordinates|toroidal]].

The 3D flow velocity is expressed as (note that the discussion has been coordinate free up till now):

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u = u_1 \mathbf e_1 + u_2 \mathbf e_2 + u_3 \mathbf e_3&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf e_i&lt;/math&gt; are basis vectors, not necessarily constant and not necessarily normalized, and &lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt; are flow velocity components; let also the coordinates of space be &lt;math&gt;(x_1, x_2, x_3)&lt;/math&gt;.

Now suppose that the flow is 2D. This doesn't mean the flow is in a plane, rather it means that the component of flow velocity in one direction is zero and the remaining components are independent of the same direction. In that case (take component 3 to be zero):

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u = u_1 \mathbf e_1 + u_2 \mathbf e_2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial u_1}{\partial x_3} = \frac{\partial u_2}{\partial x_3} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The vector function &lt;math&gt;\vec \psi&lt;/math&gt; is still defined via:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u = \nabla \times \vec \psi&lt;/math&gt;

but this must simplify in some way also since the flow is assumed 2D. If orthogonal coordinates are assumed, the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] takes on a fairly simple form, and the equation above expanded becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;u_1 \mathbf e_1 + u_2 \mathbf e_2 = 
\frac{\mathbf{e}_{1}}{h_{2} h_{3}} 
\left[
\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{2}} \left( h_{3} \psi_{3} \right) - 
\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{3}} \left( h_{2} \psi_{2} \right)
\right] + 
\frac{\mathbf{e}_{2}}{h_{3} h_{1}} 
\left[
\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{3}} \left( h_{1} \psi_{1} \right) - 
\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{1}} \left( h_{3} \psi_{3} \right)
\right] + 
\frac{\mathbf{e}_{3}}{h_{1} h_{2}} 
\left[
\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{1}} \left( h_{2} \psi_{2} \right) - 
\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{2}} \left( h_{1} \psi_{1} \right)
\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

Examining this equation shows that we can set &lt;math&gt;\psi_1 = \psi_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt; and retain equality with no loss of generality, so that:

:&lt;math&gt;u_1 \mathbf e_1 + u_2 \mathbf e_2 = 
\frac{\mathbf{e}_{1}}{h_{2} h_{3}} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{2}} \left( h_{3} \psi_{3} \right)
- \frac{\mathbf{e}_{2}}{h_{3} h_{1}} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{1}} \left( h_{3} \psi_{3} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

the significance here is that only one component of &lt;math&gt;\vec \psi&lt;/math&gt; remains, so that 2D flow becomes a problem with only one dependent variable. The cross differentiated Navier‚ÄìStokes equation becomes two 0 = 0 equations and one meaningful equation.

The remaining component &lt;math&gt;\psi_3 = \psi&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''[[stream function]]'''. The equation for &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; can simplify since a variety of quantities will now equal zero, for example:

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla \cdot \vec \psi = \frac{1}{h_{1} h_{2} h_{3}} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_3} \left(\psi h_1 h_2\right) = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

if the [[orthogonal coordinates|scale factors]] &lt;math&gt;h_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h_2&lt;/math&gt; also are independent of &lt;math&gt;x_3&lt;/math&gt;. Also, from the definition of the [[vector Laplacian]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla \times (\nabla \times \vec \psi) = \nabla(\nabla \cdot \vec \psi) - \nabla^2 \vec \psi = -\nabla^2 \vec \psi
&lt;/math&gt;

Manipulating the cross differentiated Navier‚ÄìStokes equation using the above two equations and a variety of identities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; will eventually yield the 1D scalar equation for the stream function:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\nabla^2 \psi)
 + (\nabla \times \vec \psi) \cdot \nabla(\nabla^2 \psi) = \nu \nabla^4 \psi&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\nabla^4&lt;/math&gt; is the [[biharmonic operator]]. This is very useful because it is a single self-contained scalar equation that describes both momentum and mass conservation in 2D. The only other equations that this [[partial differential equation]] needs are initial and boundary conditions.

:{| class="toccolours collapsible collapsed" width="60%" style="text-align:left"
!Derivation of the scalar stream function equation
|-
|
Distributing the [[curl (mathematics)|curl]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\nabla \times(\nabla \times \vec \psi))
 + \nabla \times\left((\nabla \times \vec \psi) \cdot \nabla (\nabla \times \vec \psi)\right)
 = \nu \nabla \times (\nabla^2 (\nabla \times \vec \psi))&lt;/math&gt;

Replacing curl of the curl with the Laplacian and expanding convection and viscosity:

:&lt;math&gt;
-\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\nabla^2 \vec \psi)
 + \nabla \times\left(
\nabla \left( \frac{(\nabla \times \vec \psi) \cdot (\nabla \times \vec \psi)}{2} \right) + \left(\nabla \times (\nabla \times \vec \psi) \right) \times (\nabla \times \vec \psi)
\right)
 = \nu (\nabla^2(\nabla(\nabla \cdot \vec \psi)) - \nabla^4 \vec \psi)&lt;/math&gt;

Above, the curl of a gradient is zero, and the divergence of &lt;math&gt;\vec \psi&lt;/math&gt; is zero. Negating:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\nabla^2 \vec \psi)
 + \nabla \times \left(\nabla^2 \vec \psi \times (\nabla \times \vec \psi)\right)
 = \nu \nabla^4 \vec \psi&lt;/math&gt;

Expanding the curl of the cross product into four terms:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\nabla^2 \vec \psi) + 
(\nabla \times \vec \psi) \cdot \nabla(\nabla^2 \vec \psi)
- (\nabla^2 \vec \psi) \cdot \nabla (\nabla \times \vec \psi)
+ (\nabla^2 \vec \psi)(\nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \vec \psi))
- (\nabla \times \vec \psi)(\nabla \cdot (\nabla^2 \vec \psi))
 = \nu \nabla^4 \vec \psi&lt;/math&gt;

Only one of four terms of the expanded curl is nonzero. The second is zero because it is the dot product of orthogonal vectors, the third is zero because it contains the divergence of flow velocity, and the fourth is zero because the divergence of a vector with only component three is zero (since it is assumed that nothing (except maybe &lt;math&gt;h_3&lt;/math&gt;) depends on component three).

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\nabla^2 \vec \psi) + (\nabla \times \vec \psi) \cdot \nabla(\nabla^2 \vec \psi)
 = \nu \nabla^4 \vec \psi&lt;/math&gt;

This vector equation is one meaningful scalar equation and two 0 = 0 equations.

The assumptions for the stream function equation are listed below:

* The flow is incompressible and Newtonian.
* Coordinates are [[orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal]].
* Flow is 2D: &lt;math&gt;u_3 = \frac{\partial u_1}{\partial x_3} = \frac{\partial u_2}{\partial x_3} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
* The first two scale factors of the coordinate system are independent of the last coordinate: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial h_1}{\partial x_3} = \frac{\partial h_2}{\partial x_3} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, otherwise extra terms appear.

The [[stream function]] has some useful properties:

* Since &lt;math&gt;-\nabla^2 \vec \psi = \nabla \times (\nabla \times \vec \psi) = \nabla \times \mathbf u&lt;/math&gt;, the [[vorticity]] of the flow is just the negative of the Laplacian of the stream function.
* The [[level curves]] of the stream function are [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamlines]].

==The stress tensor==
The derivation of the Navier-Stokes equation involves the consideration of forces acting on fluid elements, so that a quantity called the [[stress (physics)|stress tensor]] appears naturally in the [[Cauchy momentum equation]]. Since the divergence of this tensor is taken, it is customary to write out the equation fully simplified, so that the original appearance of the stress tensor is lost.

However, the stress tensor still has some important uses, especially in formulating boundary conditions at [[Capillary surface|fluid interfaces]]. Recalling that &lt;math&gt;\sigma = -\pi I + \boldsymbol \tau&lt;/math&gt;, for a Newtonian fluid the stress tensor is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_{ij} = -p\delta_{ij}+ \mu\left(\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j} + \frac{\partial u_j}{\partial x_i}\right) + \delta_{ij} \lambda \nabla \cdot \mathbf u.
&lt;/math&gt;

If the fluid is assumed to be incompressible, the tensor simplifies significantly. In 3D cartesian coordinates for example:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}

\sigma &amp;= 
-\begin{pmatrix}
p&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;p&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;p
\end{pmatrix} +

\mu \begin{pmatrix}
2 \displaystyle{\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}} &amp; \displaystyle{\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}} &amp;\displaystyle{ \frac{\partial u}{\partial z} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial x}} \\
\displaystyle{\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}} &amp; 2 \displaystyle{\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}} &amp; \displaystyle{\frac{\partial v}{\partial z} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial y}} \\
\displaystyle{\frac{\partial w}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial z}} &amp; \displaystyle{\frac{\partial w}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial z}} &amp; 2\displaystyle{\frac{\partial w}{\partial z}}
\end{pmatrix} \\

&amp;= -p I + \mu (\nabla \mathbf u + (\nabla \mathbf u)^T) = -p I + 2 \mu e\\

\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the [[strain rate]] tensor, by definition:

:&lt;math&gt;e_{ij} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j} + \frac{\partial u_j}{\partial x_i}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

In 2008 the [[Shoreline Fault]], which passes less than a mile from the plant, was discovered.&lt;ref name="sciencedaily.com"&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/06/100602215239.htm ScienceDaily:Revised Seismotectonic Model for California Central Coast: More Complex Than Previously Thought]&lt;/ref&gt; The fault has the potential of triggering a 6.5-magnitude earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;http://santamariatimes.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/article_8c1f14cc-2c11-11df-b385-001cc4c03286.html&lt;/ref&gt; Because the [[Richter magnitude scale]] is logarithmic, Diablo Canyon is designed to withstand an earthquake of shaking amplitude ten times larger than that which the Shoreline fault is capable of triggering, based on an analysis by plant owner Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E).

==Introduction==
[[Diablo Canyon Power Plant]] (DCNPP/DCPP) is located proximal to the [[Los Osos fault|Los Osos]], [[Hosgri fault|Hosgri]], San Andreas and [[Shoreline fault]]s.  The discovery of these faults required design modifications during construction of the plant.

The Shoreline Fault is described in the November 2008 PG&amp;E report as an "alignment of microseismicity subparallel to the coastline indicating the possible presence of a previously unidentified fault located about 1 km offshore of DCPP."&lt;ref name="pge.com"&gt;http://www.pge.com/includes/docs/pdfs/shared/edusafety/systemworks/dcpp/2_SFZ_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The plant's current operating license expires in 2024 and, in the aftermath of the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, there is renewed opposition due to public perception that the risk of earthquake or tsunami might make the plant unsafe. Re-licensing is contingent upon consistency with the Coastal Act and thus review by the [[California Coastal Commission]], however seismic issues are more properly within the purview of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The NRC in June 2011 announced that it had already completed its Safety Evaluation Report (SER) for the plant.&lt;ref&gt;http://pbadupws.nrc.gov/docs/ML1115/ML11153A103.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="a4nr.org"&gt;a4nr.org&lt;/ref&gt; In July, 2016 PG&amp;E announced that it does not plan on relicensing either of its two Units.

==Public controversy==
Critics contend that the Diablo Canyon (Nuclear) Power Plant was built so close to a set of geological fault lines that it is "for all practical purposes" to be regarded as built "directly over" a [[Fault (geology)|fault]].&lt;ref&gt;Protest Diablo: Living and Dying Under the Shadow of a Nuclear Power Plant  ‚Äì Living and Dying Under the Shadow of a Nuclear Power Plant|By: Paul Wolff , Dianne Conn , Judith Evered|Paperback|Createspace (12/05/2010)|{{ISBN|1-4536-3619-6}}|&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mothersforpeace.org"&gt;http://www.mothersforpeace.org&lt;/ref&gt; They refer to the Hosgri fault, which was discovered while the plant was under construction. No scientific corroboration for these opinions has been presented, and PG&amp;E maintains that "new and extensive scientific re-evaluations performed at the direction of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) continue to show that Diablo Canyon can safely withstand earthquakes, tsunamis and flooding that could potentially occur in the region."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pge.com/en/safety/systemworks/dcpp/seismicsafety/index.page&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 15, 2011, PBS aired a 17-minute video documenting the controversy over the discovery of the Shoreline fault.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/video/2056655205/&lt;/ref&gt;  It details the differences of opinion between PG&amp;E and a USGS geologist who disagrees with PG&amp;E's assessment of the length of the Shoreline fault, and the potential for shaking should slippage occur at the Hosgri/Shoreline faults simultaneously.

The documentary also prominently features former California Assemblyman [[Sam Blakeslee]], who after discovery of the Shoreline fault introduced legislation mandating 3-D seismic studies. Blakeslee, a former employee of Exxon-Mobil and an outspoken critic of the seismic evaluation undertaken in-house by PG&amp;E, has come under fire by the California Democratic Party for alleged ties to California's fossil fuel industry. The Party alleges Blakeslee "led the effort to insert offshore drilling rights along the Santa Barbara coast as part of [2009] state budget negotiations", and he "used his Assembly position to rake in more than $56,000 from his friends in Big Oil including Exxon, BP, Chevron and Valero".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cadem.org/news/press-releases/2010/cdps-oil-man-sam-site-exposes-sam-blakeslees-ties-to-big-oil-sd-15-special-election-offers-voters-clear-contrast-on-coastal-protection&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the documentary, Blakeslee authored a bill in 2006 giving the California Energy Commission (CEC) "the power to assess the safety of [California's] nuclear plants", ostensibly to provide a seismic evaluation by an organization without involved financial interest. Others dispute CEC's impartiality. CEC Chairman Robert B. Weisenmiller co-founded and maintained a 24-year association with MRW &amp; Associates, a company with areas of focus including "Fossil fuel generation", "Natural gas pipelines and storage", and "Liquified natural gas". On its website the company notes, "Because MRW maintains a singular focus on power and gas markets, we are ideally placed to help clients take advantage of the changes in market structure and industry regulation."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mrwassoc.com/about-our_focus.php&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclear energy has been perceived by many as a barrier to the expanding role of natural gas as a fuel for generating electricity, due to nuclear's lack of carbon emissions.

==Geological perspectives==
Three Pliocene-Miocene marine sedimentary units dominate the geology of Diablo Canyon: the Pismo Formation, the Monterey Formation, and the Obispo Formation.

==Seismic source characterization studies==
Various techniques are used to identify faults. These include:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* aeromagnetic survey
* marine magnetic survey
*seismic reflection profiling
* seismicity
* sub-bottom profiling
* geologic mapping
* geodetic survey
* gravity survey

===Shoreline Fault===
{{Main article|Shoreline fault}}

The Shoreline Fault is a 25&amp;nbsp;km long vertical [[strike-slip fault]]&lt;ref name="sciencedaily.com"/&gt;, identified in 2008, which lies approximately three hundred meters from the [[Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant]] in California.  According to [[Pacific Gas &amp; Electric]], the fault may produce quakes up to 6.5 magnitude. Mandated three-dimensional seismic studies have not been yet completed, and are not prerequisites for reissuance of the operating licenses for the two onsite units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= | title=In The World of Nuclear Power Crisis| url=http://www.mindfully.org/Nucs/TMI-LifeMay79.htm  | work=Life Magazine | date=May 1979 | pages=23‚Äì30 | accessdate=July 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety ==

The company asserts the facility is able to withstand a 7.5 magnitude quake,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.santamariatimes.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/article_8c1f14cc-2c11-11df-b385-001cc4c03286.html Santa Maria Times:Supervisors request delay for Diablo relicensing&lt;/ref&gt; and NRC's estimate of the risk each year of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to the reactor at Diablo Canyon was 1 in 23,810 according to an NRC study published in August 2010.&lt;ref name="Dedman"&gt;{{cite news |first= Bill |last= Dedman | authorlink= Bill Dedman |title= What are the odds? US nuke plants ranked by quake risk |publisher= msnbc.com |date= March 17, 2011 |url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42103936/ |accessdate= April 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/Sections/NEWS/quake%20nrc%20risk%20estimates.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preparedness ===
The [[Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation]] of the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] provides oversight of [[Incident response team]]s and assures provision of an appropriate [[Incident commander]] for all adverse events including [[earthquake]]s. The company does have in place the following measures:
* Severe Accident Management Guidelines (SAMG)
**Controlling reactor coolant pressure and temp, containment pressure and H concentration
**Flood containment
**emergency steam injection into generators
* Extreme Damage Mitigation Guidelines
**Spent fuel pool water replacement measures
**Depressurization of steam generators
**reduction of pressure w/o power
**start diesel w/o power

=== Design basis ===
According to information provided by PG&amp;E &lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Stricland&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DCPP Facility Review|Jearl Strickland|Presentation to Santa Barbara Board of Supervisors|May 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; the plant is designed to accommodate a [[ground acceleration]] of 0.75 g ‚Äì three quarters of gravity. By comparison, the ground tremors experienced by the Fukushima Daiichi power plant was reported as 0.2‚Äì0.51g, with the plant certified to withstand 0.18‚Äì0.36g. Subsequent inspection showed no significant damage to any of Fukushima Daiichi's four reactors from the earthquake,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/fukushima-accident.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; indicating all four reactors exceeded safety specifications by .02-.15 g.

=== Tsunami ===
Diablo Canyon is designed to exceed a maximum oceanic flood level (combined tsunami, storm wave, high tide, and storm surge) of 32.0 feet above mean sea level (MSL) / 34.6 feet mean lower-low water (MLLW). The facility recently conducted a trial application of a Probabilistic Tsunami Hazard Assessment (PTHA) to evaluate lessons learned from the 2004 Sumatra tsunami as part of PG&amp;E's Long-Term Seismic Plan (LTSP). This study shows that the hazard for tsunami waves of up to 3 meters (approximately 10&amp;nbsp;ft) is dominated by distant earthquakes around the circum-Pacific region, and is consistent with the historic record. The tsunami wave heights observed in San Luis Obispo County from the March 2011 Japanese tsunami were consistent with these results.&lt;ref&gt;http://pbadupws.nrc.gov/docs/ML0601/ML060170129.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soil liquefaction ===
[[Soil liquefaction]] resulting from earthquake activity has been raised as a concern &lt;ref&gt;NRC-PG&amp;E public forum|September 2011|San Luis Obispo, CA&lt;/ref&gt; however the plant and storage fuels are anchored on [[bedrock]].&lt;ref name="Strickland"&gt;Strickland&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-Fukushima developments ==
In April 2011, in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear incident in Japan, PG&amp;E asked the NRC not to issue license renewals until PG&amp;E can complete new seismic studies, which are expected to take at least three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On June 21, 2016, PG&amp;E announced a Joint Proposal with labor and environmental organizations to increase investment in energy efficiency, renewables and storage, while phasing out nuclear power. Specifically, the operating licenses for Diablo Canyon Units 1 and 2 will not be renewed. These are set to expire on November 2, 2024 and August 26, 2025 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pge.com/en/about/newsroom/newsdetails/index.page?title=20160621_in_step_with_californias_evolving_energy_policy_pge_labor_and_environmental_groups_announce_proposal_to_increase_energy_efficiency_renewables_and_storage_while_phasing_out_nuclear_power_over_the_next_decade&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3770">'''Diamond Alkali Company''' was an [[United States|American]] chemical company incorporated in 1910 in [[West Virginia]] by a group of glass industry businessmen from [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]].  The company soon established a large [[chemical plant]] at [[Fairport Harbor, Ohio]], which would operate for over sixty years.  In 1947, the headquarters of the company was moved from Pittsburgh to [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]].&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cnNZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zUgNAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=diamond%20alkali%20mayfield&amp;pg=6527%2C389815&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1967, Diamond Alkali and [[Shamrock Oil|Shamrock Oil and Gas]] merged to form the [[Diamond Shamrock]] Corporation. Diamond Shamrock would go on to merge with [[Ultramar|Ultramar Corporation]], and the combined company, [[Ultramar|Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corporation]], would in turn be acquired by [[Valero Energy Corporation]] in 2001.

Diamond Alkali was largely responsible for contamination leading to the creation of a Superfund Site in the [[Ironbound]] section of [[Newark, New Jersey]]. Between 1951 and 1969, Diamond Alkali in Newark produced approximately {{convert|700000|gal}} of the herbicide [[Agent Orange]]. The plant had a reputation for accidents and producing the lowest quality (most contaminated with by-products) herbicides.&lt;ref name=morren&gt;Morren, George (2007). When the Chips are Down. {{ISBN|978-1-59271-388-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the firm frequently dumped "bad" batches of the herbicide into the [[Passaic River]]. The former plant property and adjoining portions of the Lower [[Passaic River]] were declared a Superfund site in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/region02/superfund/npl/diamondalkali/ USEPA Region 2 Superfund: Diamond Alkali, Newark, NJ]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1986, the Diamond Shamrock Corporation agreed to pay $150,000 for a canvas [[tarpaulin]] to cover {{convert|3|acre|m2}} of the contaminated area.&lt;ref name=morren/&gt; Remediation efforts at Diamond Alkali began in 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sevenson.com/index.php/project-summaries/diamond-alkali-superfund-site/# |title=Diamond Alkali Superfund Site |access-date=2013-01-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927001856/http://www.sevenson.com/index.php/project-summaries/diamond-alkali-superfund-site# |archive-date=2015-09-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ecological investigation, dredging, and other cleanup activities are still underway {{as of|2012|lc=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darrp.noaa.gov/northeast/passaic/pdf/PR_NRDA_Draft_Plan_11-07.pdf Natural Resource Damage Assessment Plan]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =USACE&gt;{{cite web

In modern [[cosmology|cosmological]] theory, '''diffusion damping''', also called '''photon diffusion damping''',&lt;!--'''collisionless damping''',CAN'T FIND A SOURCE TO SUPPORT THIS--&gt; is a physical process which reduced density inequalities ([[anisotropies]]) in the early [[universe]], making the universe itself and the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMB) more uniform. Around 300,000 years after the [[Big Bang]], during the epoch of ''[[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]]'', [[Photon diffusion|diffusing photons]] travelled from hot regions of space to cold ones, equalising the temperatures of these regions. This effect is responsible, along with [[baryon acoustic oscillations]], the [[Doppler effect]], and [[gravitational redshift|the effects of gravity on electromagnetic radiation]], for the eventual formation of [[galaxies]] and [[galaxy clusters]], these being the dominant large scale structures which are observed in the universe. It is a [[damping]] ''by'' diffusion, not ''of'' diffusion.&lt;ref name=hu_physics2&gt;Hu, Sugiyama &amp; Silk (1996-04-28), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--ANOTHER (newer) STORY? Photon diffusion is one of two effects which damp small scale ''temperature'' anisotropies. The other may be termed [[statistical damping]]; it occurs when the width of the fluctuation is less than the width of the [[last scattering surface]].&lt;ref name=longair450 /&gt; 
--&gt;

The strength of diffusion damping is calculated by a mathematical expression for the ''damping factor'', which figures into the [[Boltzmann equation]], an equation which describes the amplitude of perturbations in the CMB.&lt;ref name=jungman24 /&gt; The strength of the diffusion damping is chiefly governed by the distance photons travel before being scattered (diffusion length). The primary effects on the diffusion length are from the properties of the plasma in question: different sorts of plasma may experience different sorts of diffusion damping. The evolution of a plasma may also affect the damping process.&lt;ref name=hu1213 /&gt; The scale on which diffusion damping works is called the '''Silk scale''' and its value corresponds to the size of galaxies of the present day. The mass contained within the Silk scale is called the '''Silk mass''' and it corresponds to the mass of the galaxies.&lt;ref name=madsen99101 /&gt;

Diffusion damping took place about 13.8 billion years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; during the stage of the early universe called ''[[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]]'' or matter-radiation ''decoupling''. This period occurred about 320,000 years after the [[Big Bang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; This is equivalent to a [[redshift]] of around ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1090.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ade |first1=P. A.

Prior to the recombination epoch, this ''soup'', a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], was largely [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] to the [[electromagnetic radiation]] of photons. This meant that the permanently excited photons were scattered by the protons and electrons too often to travel very far in straight lines.&lt;ref name=hu6&gt;Hu (1995-08-26), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  During the recombination epoch, the universe cooled rapidly as free electrons were captured by atomic nuclei; atoms formed from their constituent parts and the universe became transparent: the amount of photon scattering decreased dramatically. Scattering less, photons could diffuse (travel) much greater distances.&lt;ref name=hu_physics2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=liddle63120&gt;Liddle &amp; Lyth (2000-04-13), p. 63, 120&lt;/ref&gt; There was no significant diffusion damping for electrons, which could not diffuse nearly as far as photons could in similar circumstances. Thus all damping by electron diffusion is negligible when compared to photon diffusion damping.&lt;ref name=padmanabhan171172&gt;Padmanabhan (1993-06-25), p. 171&amp;ndash;2&lt;/ref&gt;

Acoustic perturbations of initial density fluctuations in the universe made some regions of space hotter and denser than others.&lt;ref name=harrison1&gt;Harrison (1970-05-15)&lt;/ref&gt; These differences in [[temperature]] and [[density]] are called ''[[anisotropies]]''. Photons diffused from the hot, overdense regions of plasma to the cold, underdense ones: they dragged along the protons and electrons: the photons pushed electrons along, and these, in turn, pulled on protons by the [[Coulomb force]]. This caused the temperatures and densities of the hot and cold regions to be averaged and the universe became less [[anisotropies|anisotropic]] (characteristically various)  and more ''isotropic'' (characteristically uniform). This reduction in anisotropy is the ''damping'' of diffusion damping. Diffusion damping thus damps temperature and density anisotropies in the early universe. With baryonic matter (protons and electrons) escaping the dense areas along with the photons; the temperature and density inequalities were ''[[adiabatically]]'' damped. That is to say the ratios of photons to baryons remained constant during the damping process.&lt;ref name=hu1213 /&gt;&lt;ref name=madsen99100&gt;Madsen (1996-05-15), p. 99&amp;ndash;100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=longair355&gt;Longair (2008-01-08), p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jetzer6&gt;Jetzer &amp; Pretzl (2002-07-31), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rich256&gt;Rich (2001-06-15), p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

Photon diffusion was first described in [[Joseph Silk]]'s 1968 paper entitled "Cosmic Black-Body Radiation and Galaxy Formation",&lt;ref name=silk&gt;Silk (1968-02-01)&lt;/ref&gt; which was published in ''[[Astrophysical Journal|The Astrophysical Journal]]''. As such, diffusion damping is sometimes also called '''Silk damping''',&lt;ref name=bonometto227228 /&gt; though this term may apply only to one possible damping scenario.&lt;ref name=padmanabhan171172 /&gt;&lt;ref name=partridge302&gt;Partridge (1995-09-29), p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bonometto55&gt;Bonometto, Gorini &amp; Moschella (2001-12-15), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Silk damping was thus named after its discoverer.&lt;ref name=madsen99101&gt;Madsen (1996-05-15), p. 99&amp;ndash;101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bonometto55"/&gt;&lt;ref name=hu_nature15&gt;Hu (1994-06-28), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Silk damping vs. diffusion damping: need in-depth section--&gt;

==Magnitude==
The magnitude of diffusion damping is calculated as a ''damping factor'' or ''suppression factor'', represented by the symbol &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{D} &lt;/math&gt;, which figures into the [[Boltzmann equation]], an equation which describes the amplitude of perturbations in the CMB.&lt;ref name=jungman24 /&gt; The strength of the diffusion damping is chiefly governed by the distance photons travel before being scattered (diffusion length). What affect the diffusion length are primarily the properties of the plasma in question: different sorts of plasma may experience different sorts of diffusion damping. The evolution of a plasma may also affect the damping process.&lt;ref name=hu1213 /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{D}(\mathit{k}) = \int_{0}^{\eta_0} \dot{\tau}e^{-[\mathit{k}/{\mathit{k}_\mathit{D}(\eta)}]^2}\; d\eta. &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=jungman24 /&gt;

Where:
*&lt;math&gt; \eta &lt;/math&gt; is the [[conformal time]].
*&lt;math&gt; \dot{\tau} &lt;/math&gt; is the "differential optical depth for Thomson scattering". [[Thomson scattering]] is the scattering of electromagnetic radiation (light) by charged particles such as electrons.&lt;ref name=jungman24 /&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; \mathit{k} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[wave number]] of the wave being suppressed.&lt;ref name=longair450&gt;Longair (2008-01-08), p. 450&lt;/ref&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; (\dot{\tau}e^{-[\mathit{k}/{\mathit{k}_\mathit{D}(\eta)}]^2})&lt;/math&gt; is the [[visibility function]].&lt;ref name=jungman24 /&gt;

The damping factor &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{D} &lt;/math&gt;, when factored into the [[Boltzmann equation]] for the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB), reduces the amplitude of perturbations:

[[File:Walk3d 0.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Three random walks in three dimensions. In diffusion damping, photons from hot regions diffuse to cold regions by random walk, so after &lt;math&gt;\mathit{N}&lt;/math&gt; steps, the photons have travelled a distance &lt;math&gt;\lambda_D=\sqrt{\mathit{N}}\lambda_C&lt;/math&gt;.]]

Mathematical calculations of the damping factor depend on &lt;math&gt; \mathit{k}_\mathit{D} &lt;/math&gt;, or the ''effective diffusion scale'', which in turn depends on a crucial value, ''the diffusion length'', &lt;math&gt; \lambda_\mathit{D} &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=hu_physics_5&gt;Hu, Sugiyama &amp; Silk (1996-04-28), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The diffusion length relates how far photons travel during diffusion, and comprises a finite number of short steps in random directions. The average of these steps is the ''Compton [[mean free path]]'', and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\lambda_\mathit{C}&lt;/math&gt;. As the direction of these steps are randomly taken, &lt;math&gt; \lambda_\mathit{D} &lt;/math&gt; is approximately equal to &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{\mathit{N}} \lambda_\mathit{C} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathit{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the number of steps the photon takes before the [[conformal time]] at decoupling (&lt;math&gt;\mathit{\eta}_\ast&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref name=hu1213&gt;Hu (1995-08-26), p. 12&amp;ndash;13&lt;/ref&gt;

The diffusion length increases at recombination because the mean free path does, with less photon scattering occurring; this increases the amount of diffusion and damping. The mean free path increases because the ''electron ionisation fraction'', &lt;math&gt; \mathit{x}_\mathit{e} &lt;/math&gt;, decreases as ionised [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] bind with the free, charged electrons. As this occurs, the mean free path increases proportionally: &lt;math&gt; \lambda_\mathit{C} \varpropto {(\mathit{x}_\mathit{e} \mathit{n}_\mathit{b})}^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;. That is, the mean free path of the photons is [[inversely proportional]] to the electron ionisation fraction and the baryon number density (&lt;math&gt;\mathit{n}_\mathit{b}&lt;/math&gt;). That means that the more baryons there were, and the more they were ionised, the shorter the average photon could travel before encountering one and being scattered.&lt;ref name=hu1213 /&gt; Small changes to these values before or during recombination can augment the damping effect considerably.&lt;ref name=hu1213 /&gt; This dependence on the baryon density by photon diffusion allows scientists to use analysis of the latter to investigate the former, in addition to the &lt;!--enigmatic?--&gt; history of ionisation.&lt;ref name=hu_physics_5 /&gt;

The effect of diffusion damping is greatly augmented by the finite width of the [[surface of last scattering]] (SLS).&lt;!--need great graph in Hu's thesis--&gt;&lt;ref name=hu137&gt;(1995-08-26), p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; The finite width of the SLS means the CMB photons we see were not all emitted at the same time, and the fluctuations we see are not all in phase.&lt;ref name=durrer5&gt;Durrer (2001-09-17), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; It also means that during recombination, the diffusion length changed dramatically, as the ionisation fraction shifted.&lt;ref name=hu156&gt;Hu (1995-08-26), pp. 156‚Äì7&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Model dependence ===
In general, diffusion damping produces its effects independent of the cosmological model being studied, thereby masking the effects of other, model-''dependent'' phenomena. This means that without an accurate model of diffusion damping, scientists cannot judge the relative merits of cosmological models, whose theoretical predictions cannot be compared with observational data, this data being obscured by damping effects. For example, the peaks in the power spectrum due to acoustic oscillations are decreased in amplitude by diffusion damping. This deamplification of the power spectrum hides features of the curve, features that would otherwise be more visible.&lt;ref name=hu136138&gt;Hu (1995-08-26), p. 136&amp;ndash;8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hu_tail568&gt;Hu &amp; White (1997-04-20), p. 568&amp;ndash;9&lt;/ref&gt;

Though general diffusion damping can damp perturbations in collisionless dark matter simply due to photon dispersion, the term ''Silk damping'' applies only to damping of adiabatic models of baryonic matter, which is coupled to the diffusing photons, not [[dark matter]],&lt;ref name=padmanabhan171172 /&gt; and diffuses with them.&lt;ref name=partridge302 /&gt;&lt;ref name=bonometto55 /&gt; Silk damping is not as significant in models of cosmological development which posit early isocurvature fluctuations (i.e. fluctuations which do not require a constant ratio of baryons and photons). In this case, increases in baryon density do not require a corresponding increases in photon density, and the lower the photon density, the less diffusion there would be: the less diffusion, the less damping.&lt;ref name=rich256 /&gt; Photon diffusion is not dependent on the causes of the initial fluctuations in the density of the universe.&lt;ref name=hu_physics_5 /&gt;

== Effects ==

=== Speed ===
Damping occurs at two different scales, with the process working more quickly over short ranges than over longer distances. Here, a short length is one that is lower than the mean free path of the photons. A long distance is one that is greater than the mean free path, if still less than the diffusion length. On the smaller scale, perturbations are damped almost instantaneously. On the larger scale, anisotropies are decreased more slowly, with significant degradation happening within one unit of [[Hubble time]].&lt;ref name=padmanabhan171172 /&gt;

=== The Silk scale and the Silk mass ===
Diffusion damping exponentially decreases anisotropies in the CMB on a scale (the '''Silk scale''')&lt;ref name=madsen99101 /&gt; much smaller than a [[degree (angle)|degree]], or smaller than approximately 3 [[parsec|megaparsecs]].&lt;ref name=bonometto227228&gt;Bonometto, Gorini &amp; Moschella (2001-12-15), p. 227&amp;ndash;8&lt;/ref&gt; This angular scale corresponds to a [[multipole moment]] &lt;math&gt;\mathit{l} \gtrsim 800&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=jetzer6 /&gt;&lt;ref name=papantonopoulos63&gt;Papantonopoulos (2005-03-24), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; The mass contained within the Silk scale is the ''silk mass''.  Numerical evaluations of the Silk mass yield results on the order of &lt;math&gt;10^{13} &lt;/math&gt; solar masses at recombination&lt;ref name=jedamzik12&gt;Jedamzik, Kataliniƒá &amp; Olinto (1996-06-13), p. 1&amp;ndash;2&lt;/ref&gt;  and on the order of the mass of a present-day [[galaxy]] or [[galaxy cluster]] in the current era.&lt;ref name=madsen99101 /&gt;&lt;ref name=padmanabhan171172 /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathit{M}_\mathit{s} \approx \frac{\mathit{m}_\mathit{p} {\mathit{t}_\mathit{rec}}^{3/2}}{\sqrt{\mathit{n}_\mathit{rec} \sigma^3}}.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!--for alternate calculation, see Longair (2008-01-08), p. 356--&gt;

Scientists say diffusion damping affects ''small'' angles and corresponding anisotropies. Other effects operate on a scale called ''intermediate'' &lt;math&gt;10 \lesssim \mathit{l} \lesssim 100&lt;/math&gt; or ''large'' &lt;math&gt;\mathit{l} \lessapprox 10 &lt;/math&gt;. Searches for anisotropies on a small scale are not as difficult as those on larger scales, partly because they may employ ground-based telescopes and their results can be more easily predicted by current theoretical models.&lt;ref name=kaiser533&gt;Kaiser &amp; Silk (1986-12-11), p. 533&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Galaxy formation ===
Scientists study photon diffusion damping (and CMB anisotropies in general) because of the insight the subject provides into the question, "How did the universe come to be?". Specifically, primordial anisotropies in the temperature and density of the universe are supposed to be the causes of later large-scale structure formation. Thus it was the amplification of small perturbations in the pre-recombination universe that grew into the galaxies and galaxy clusters of the present era. Diffusion damping made the universe isotropic within distances on the order of the Silk Scale. That this scale corresponds to the size of observed galaxies (when the passage of time is taken into account) implies that diffusion damping is responsible for limiting the size of these galaxies. The theory is that clumps of matter in the early universe became the galaxies that we see today, and the size of these galaxies is related to the temperature and density of the clumps.&lt;ref name=hu_analytic2&gt;Hu &amp; Sugiyama (1994-07-28), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sunyaev1&gt;Sunyaev &amp; Zel'dovich (Sept. 1980), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Diffusion may also have had a significant effect on the evolution of primordial [[cosmic magnetic field]]s, fields which may have been amplified over time to become galactic magnetic fields. However, these cosmic magnetic fields may have been damped by radiative diffusion: just as acoustic oscillations in the plasma were damped by the diffusion of photons, so were [[magnetosonic wave]]s (waves of ions travelling through a magnetised plasma). This process began before the era of [[neutrino decoupling]] and ended at the time of recombination.&lt;ref name=jedamzik12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=brandenburg2&gt;Brandenburg, Enqvist &amp; Olesen (January 1997), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dynamical heterogeneity''' describes the behavior of glass-forming materials when undergoing a phase transition from the liquid state to the glassy state. In dynamical heterogeneity, the dynamics of cooling to a glassy state show variation within the material.

==Polymers==

[[Polymer]] properties include [[viscoelasticity]] and may be synthetic or [[biopolymers|natural]]. When a polymeric liquid is cooled below its freezing temperature without crystallizing, it becomes a [[supercooled]] liquid. When the supercooled liquid is further cooled, it becomes a [[glass]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite book  | last1 = Rubinstein | first1 = Michael | last2 = Colby | first2 = Ralph H. |title = Polymer Physics | year = 2003 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]  | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-19-852059-7 | pages =}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[temperature]] at which a polymer becomes a glass by fast cooling is called the [[glass transition]] [[temperature]] T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;. At this temperature, [[viscosity]] reaches up to 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; poise depending upon cooling-rate.

==Phase transitions==
It is possible for a [[phase transition]] from polymer to glassy state to take place. Polymer glass transitions have many determinants including [[Relaxation_(physics)|relaxation time]], viscosity and cage size. At low temperatures the [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] become very slow (sluggish) and relaxation time increases from picoseconds to seconds, minutes, or more. At high temperatures, the correlation function has a [[wikt:ballistic|ballistic]] regime for very short times (when particles do not interact) and a [[microscopic]] regime. In the microscopic regime, the [[correlation functions]] decay exponentially at high temperatures. At low temperatures the correlation functions have an intermediate regime in which particles have both slow and fast relaxations. The slow relaxation is an indication of cages in the glassy system. In glassy state density is not homogeneous i.e. particles are localized in different density distributions in space. It means that density fluctuations are present in the system. Particle dynamics become very slow because temperature is directly proportional to kinetic [[energy]] causing the particles trapped in local regions by each other. Particles are doing rattling motion inside these cages and cooperate with each other. These regions in the glassy polymer are called cages. In the intermediate regime each particle has its own and different relaxation time.&lt;ref&gt;

Ltd  | location = Singapore | isbn = 981-256-510-8 | pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dynamics in all these cases are different, so at a small scale, there are a large number of cages in the system relative to the size of the whole system. This is known as dynamical heterogeneity in the glassy state of the system. A [[measurement]] of dynamical heterogeneity can be done by calculating [[correlation functions]] like Non-Gaussian parameter, four point [[correlation functions]](Dynamic Susceptibility) and three [[time]] [[correlation functions]].&lt;ref&gt;

An '''electrode line''' is used in some [[High-voltage direct current|high-voltage direct-current]] (HVDC) power transmission systems which use the [[Ground (electricity)|ground]] or [[sea]] as the return path for [[electric current]]. Many long-distance HVDC systems use sea or ground return for the DC neutral current since this is considerably cheaper than providing a dedicated ''metallic return'' conductor on an overhead wire or cable.

The connection into the ground requires a specially designed ''ground electrode'' (or ''earth electrode'').&lt;ref&gt;Arrillaga, Jos; High Voltage Direct Current Transmission, second edition, Institution of Electrical Engineers, {{ISBN|0 85296 941 4}}, 1998, pp190‚Äì192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kimbark, E.W., Direct current transmission, volume 1, Wiley Interscience, 1971, chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  The electrode is usually located several tens of kilometres from the [[HVDC converter station|converter station]] in order to avoid possible problems or [[corrosion]] in the converter station grounding system.  The '''electrode line''' connects the converter station to the grounding electrode. The electrode line can be implemented, depending upon the situation of the electrode (onshore or in the sea), as ground cables, as overhead line, or as a combination of ground cable and overhead line.

==Bipolar systems==
[[File:Hvdc bipolar schematic.svg|thumb|right| Block diagram of a bipolar system that also has an earth return]]
HVDC electrodes are used in most [[High-voltage direct current#Bipolar|bipolar]] HVDC transmission systems as a means to improve the reliability of the entire system. In the event that one of the poles in the bipolar system is faulted, the current path will switch to ground return, thus allowing the system to continue operating at reduced capacity and reducing the possibility that a pole fault will cause a bipolar outage. Usually these ground return paths are only used for very short durations until the faulted pole can be returned to service.  The ground current in such schemes can flow in either direction, and the electrodes have to be designed to be reversible, operating either as an [[anode]] or [[cathode]].

==Monopolar systems==
[[File:Hvdc monopolar schematic.svg|thumb|right| Block diagram of a monopole system with earth return]]
HVDC electrodes are also used in some [[High-voltage direct current#Monopole and earth return|monopolar]] HVDC systems, for example the [[HVDC Italy‚ÄìCorsica‚ÄìSardinia|Italy‚ÄìCorsica‚ÄìSardinia]] scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Compendium of HVDC schemes, [[International Council on Large Electric Systems|CIGR√â]] Technical Brochure No. 003, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;  In such systems the electrode line permanently carries the same current as the high-voltage conductor; however since the ground current is then only unidirectional, one of the electrodes (the cathode) can be of simpler design since corrosion is not a problem for cathode electrodes.

==Typical voltages==
The operating voltage of the electrode line usually is in the range of approx. 10-20kV (medium voltage range).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Padiyar|first=K.

'''''Experiment''''' was an early 19th-century [[Team boat|boat]] powered by horses and incorporating the idea of a [[Screw-propeller|screw propeller]], which was a new idea at the time.&lt;ref name="HorsePaddleBoat"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Dick |last1=Sheaff |work=Ephemera |url=http://www.sheaff-ephemera.com/list/powered_boats.html |title=Powered Boats |accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;{{cite book |publisher=[[Antiques (magazine)|Antiques Magazine]] |date=19 March 1925 |last1=Lane |first1=Gladys R.

==History==
''Experiment'' was a horse-powered [[ferry boat]]. It was a 12-ton, three-masted boat drawing a few feet of water, about {{convert|100|ft}} long by {{convert|20|ft|}} [[Beam (nautical)|beam]].&lt;ref name="Bishop"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K1YdAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA120 |last1=Bishop |first1=James Leander |first2=Edwin Troxell |last2=Freedley |first3=Edward |last3=Young |page=12 |title=A history of American manufactures from 1608 to 1860: exhibiting the origin and growth of the principal mechanic arts and manufactures, from the earliest colonial period to the adoption of the constitution and comprising annals of the industry of the United States in machinery |volume=2 |publisher=E. Young &amp; Co |year=1864|accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its driving mechanism was an in-water screw invented by David Grieve in 1801. The boat was constructed by [[David Wilkinson (machinist)|David Wilkinson]] (some sources give his name as ''Varnum''&lt;ref name="VanWyk"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.rihs.org/assetts/files/publications/1961_April.pdf |title=William Hamlin: Providence Engraver |first1=Eugene |last1=VanWyk |work=[[Rhode Island History]] |volume=20 |number=2 |date= April 1961 |page=36 |accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in 1807 to 1810, depending on the source.&lt;ref name="RIS-EDI"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BhROAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA29 |last1=Rhode Island Society for the Encouragement of Domestic Industry |first1= |title=Transactions of the Rhode Island Society for the Encouragement of Domestic Industry|volume= |publisher=Rhode Island Society for the Encouragement of Domestic Industry|year=1859 |page= |accessdate=13 December 2011}} p. 31 ''Mr. Varnum Wilkinson, now living (1859), built "The Experiment," he thinks in 1809 or 1810. ''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Field510"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4FP2GGvdI98C&amp;pg=PA510 |last1=Field |first1=Edward |title=State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations at the end of the century: a history |volume=2 |publisher=Mason Pub.

The technology to propel the boat upstream was originally invented by David Grieve and granted a patent February 24, 1801 in the category of "Boats to ascend rivers". The complete recorded patent was lost in the [[1836 U.S. Patent Office fire]].&lt;ref name="HorsePaddleBoat"/&gt; The idea of propelling vessels by a mechanical screw in the water is now referred to as [[John Ericsson#Propeller design|Ericsson's propeller]].&lt;ref name="Bishop"/&gt;

===Maiden voyage===
It is reported that ''Experiment'' made one unsuccessful voyage, as it ran aground on the return trip. The mechanism and associated parts were put together by Ephraim Southworth; little thought was put into the construction and it was poorly built.&lt;ref name="Field511"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4FP2GGvdI98C&amp;pg=PA511 Field, p. 511‚Äì512]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[maiden voyage]] was in June 1809 with a group of gentlemen from the Grand Lodge of the State.&lt;ref name="Society"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BhROAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA29 Rhode Island Society, p. 30]&lt;/ref&gt; The first attempt of the "Screw Boat" began at Jackson's Wharf on Eddy's Point near [[Providence, Rhode Island]], with a destination of [[Pawtuxet Village]].&lt;ref name="Hazard294"/&gt;  The eight horses for the "horse power" were owned by Marvin Morris; they were connected to a poorly designed contraption to make the boat move. It obtained a top speed of four [[knot (unit)|knot]]s with the help of a tide going in her direction and the wind on her back. It managed to get to Pawtuxet Village, where there was much celebration over its success. The return trip, however, resulted in humiliation when a gust of wind drove ''Experiment'' onto mud flats, causing its demise.&lt;ref name="Hazard294"&gt;Hazard, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grieve2"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofstateof08bick/historyofstateof08bick_djvu.txt|title=The Sea Trade in Rhode Island an Providence Plantations |first1=Robert |last1=Grieve |year=1920 |place=New York |publisher=[[American Historical Society]], Inc |pages=511‚Äì512 |accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial failure===
The ''Experiment'' venture had sold shares of stock from a [[Prospectus (finance)|prospectus]] to raise money to build it.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt;  There was so much confidence in the venture that tickets were engraved by [[William Hamlin]] for its anticipated voyages to ''[[Newport, Rhode Island|New-Port]]'' and Providence.&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RIHS"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j8q9csm-e3IC&amp;pg=RA1-PA96 |title=Rhode Island Historical Society collections, |volume=15‚Äì18 |publisher=[[Rhode Island Historical Society]] |page=96 |year=1922 |accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ultimately, the horse boat and all the associated items were seized by the Sheriff at the behest of Grieve's creditors and sold for lack of payments on the loans, since it was not a successful venture.&lt;ref name="Hazard294"/&gt; Wilkinson later said that "after the frolic" it was "hauled up" and allowed to go to waste and ruin.&lt;ref name="Field510"/&gt; Nevertheless, the ship was carefully studied by [[Daniel French (inventor)|Daniel French]], who did the drawings for [[Robert Fulton]]'s ''[[North River Steamboat]]'' (known as ''Clermont''), and may have benefited that enterprise.&lt;ref name="Field510"/&gt;

''Experiment'' is important as a precursor of public transportation on rivers, and it was the forerunner of a number of [[Team boat|horse-powered boats]], chiefly ferries used for more than a half-century along the eastern seaboard of the United States.  Most commonly, those were [[Paddle steamer|paddle wheel]] boats, not screw-type [[propeller]]s.&lt;ref name="Perkins"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasw.org/users/sperkins/hrsferry.html |title=When Horses Really Walked On Water: Before the steam engine was invented, there were three sources of usable power: wind, water, and animals.

The '''Fast Breeder Test Reactor''' ('''FBTR''') is a [[breeder reactor]] located at [[Kalpakkam]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igcar.ernet.in/press_releases/press15.htm |title=A creditable performance at Kalpakkam |website=Igcar.ernet.in |date=2005-10-19 |accessdate=2017-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indira Gandhi Center for Atomic Research ([[IGCAR]]) and [[Bhabha Atomic Research Centre]] (BARC) jointly designed, constructed, and operate the reactor.

==History==
It first reached criticality in October 1985, making India the seventh nation to have the technology to build and operate a breeder reactor after [[United States]], [[UK]], [[France]], [[Japan]], [[Germany]], and [[Russia]].  The reactor was designed to produce 40&amp;nbsp;[[Megawatt|MW]] of thermal power and 13.2&amp;nbsp;MW of electrical power. The FBTR has rarely operated at its designed capacity and had to be shut down between 1987 and 1989 due to technical problems. From 1989 to 1992, the reactor operated at 1&amp;nbsp;MW. In 1993, the reactor's power level was raised to 10.5&amp;nbsp;MW. The initial nuclear fuel core used in the FBTR consisted of approximately 50&amp;nbsp;kg of weapons-grade [[plutonium]]. In September 2002, fuel burn-up in the FBTR for the first time reached the 100,000 megawatt-days per metric ton uranium (MWd/MTU) mark. This is considered an important milestone in breeder reactor technology. Using the experience gained from the operation of the FBTR, a 500&amp;nbsp;MWe Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor ([[PFBR]]) is in advanced stage of construction at Kalpakkam.

==Technical details==
The reactor uses a [[plutonium]]-[[uranium]] mixed carbide fuel and liquid sodium as a coolant. The fuel is an indigenous mix of 70 percent plutonium carbide and 30 percent uranium carbide. Plutonium for the fuel is extracted from irradiated fuel in the Madras power reactors and reprocessed in [[Tarapur Atomic Power Station|Tarapur]].

Some of the uranium is created from the transmutation of thorium bundles that are also placed in the core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dst.gov.in/whats_new/press-release13/pib_27-02-2013_4.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322030151/http://dst.gov.in/whats_new/press-release13/pib_27-02-2013_4.htm |archivedate=2014-03-22 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

A '''flue-gas stack''' is a type of [[chimney]], a vertical pipe, channel or similar structure through which combustion product gases called [[flue gas]]es are exhausted to the outside air. Flue gases are produced when coal, oil, natural gas, wood or any other fuel is [[combustion|combusted]] in an industrial furnace, a [[power station|power plant's]] steam-generating boiler, or other large combustion device. Flue gas is usually composed of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and water vapor as well as [[nitrogen]] and excess [[oxygen]] remaining from the intake combustion air. It also contains a small percentage of pollutants such as [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[nitrogen oxides]] and [[sulfur oxides]]. The flue gas stacks are often quite tall, up to 400 metres (1300&amp;nbsp;feet) or more, so as to disperse the exhaust pollutants over a greater area and thereby reduce the [[concentration]] of the pollutants to the levels required by governmental environmental policy and environmental regulation.

When the flue gases are exhausted from stoves, ovens, fireplaces, or other small sources within residential abodes, restaurants, hotels, or other public buildings and small commercial enterprises, their flue gas stacks are referred to as chimneys.

==History==

The first industrial chimneys were built in the mid-17th century when it was first understood how they could improve the combustion of a furnace by increasing the [[Stack effect#The flow induced by the stack effect|draft]] of air into the combustion zone.&lt;ref&gt;Douet, James (1988).

[http://www.victoriansociety.org.uk/caserpts.html Victorian Society Casework Reports] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925221950/http://www.victoriansociety.org.uk/caserpts.html |date=2006-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, they played an important part in the development of [[reverberatory furnace]]s and a coal-based metallurgical industry, one of the key sectors of the early [[Industrial Revolution]]. Most 18th-century industrial chimneys (now commonly referred to as '''flue gas stacks''') were built into the walls of the furnace much like a domestic chimney. The first free-standing industrial chimneys were probably those erected at the end of the long condensing [[flue]]s associated with smelting [[lead]].

The powerful association between industrial chimneys and the characteristic smoke-filled landscapes of the industrial revolution was due to the universal application of the [[steam engine]] for most manufacturing processes. The chimney is part of a steam-generating boiler, and its evolution is closely linked to increases in the power of the steam engine. The chimneys of [[Thomas Newcomen]]‚Äôs steam engine were incorporated into the walls of the engine house. The taller, free-standing industrial chimneys that appeared in the early 19th century were related to the changes in boiler design associated with [[James Watt]]‚Äôs "double-powered" engines, and they continued to grow in stature throughout the Victorian period. Decorative embellishments are a feature of many industrial chimneys  from the 1860s, with over-sailing caps and patterned brickwork.

The invention of fan-assisted forced draft in the early 20th century removed the industrial chimney's original function, that of drawing air into the steam-generating boilers or other furnaces. With the replacement of the steam engine as a prime mover, first by diesel engines and then by electric motors, the  early industrial chimneys began to disappear from the industrial landscape. Building materials changed from stone and brick to steel and later reinforced concrete, and the height of the industrial chimney was determined by the need to disperse combustion flue gases to comply with governmental [[air pollution]] control regulations.

==Flue-gas stack draft==
[[Image:Chimney effect.svg|thumb|180px|right|The stack effect in chimneys: the gauges represent absolute air pressure and the airflow is indicated with light grey arrows. The gauge dials move clockwise with increasing pressure.]]
{{main|Stack effect}}

The combustion flue gases inside the flue gas stacks are much hotter than the ambient outside air and therefore less dense than the ambient air. That causes the bottom of the vertical column of hot flue gas to have a lower pressure than the pressure at the bottom of a corresponding column of outside air. That higher pressure outside the chimney is the driving force that moves the required combustion air into the combustion zone and also moves the flue gas up and out of the chimney.  That movement or flow of combustion air and flue gas is called "natural draft", [[HVAC#Natural ventilation|"natural ventilation"]], "chimney effect", or "[[stack effect]]". The taller the stack, the more draft is created.

The equation below provides an approximation of the pressure difference, Œî''P'', (between the bottom and the top of the flue gas stack) that is created by the draft:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arch.hku.hk/teaching/lectures/airvent/sect02.htm Natural Ventilation Lecture 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512181617/http://www.arch.hku.hk/teaching/lectures/airvent/sect02.htm |date=2006-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Perry, R.H.  |author2=Green, Don W.|title=Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook|edition=6th Edition (page 9-72)|publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company|year=1984|isbn=0-07-049479-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta P =Cah\bigg(\frac {1}{T_o} - \frac {1}{T_i}\bigg)&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* Œî''P'': available pressure difference, in [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]]
* ''C'' = 0.0342
* ''a'': atmospheric pressure, in Pa
* ''h'': height of the flue gas stack, in m
* ''T&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'': absolute outside air temperature, in [[kelvin|K]]
* ''T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'': absolute average temperature of the flue gas inside the stack, in K.

The above equation is an approximation because it assumes that the [[molar mass]] of the flue gas and the outside air are equal and that the pressure drop through the flue gas stack is quite small.  Both assumptions are fairly good but not exactly accurate.

== Flue-gas flow-rate induced by the draft==

As a "first guess" approximation, the following equation can be used to estimate the flue-gas flow-rate induced by the draft of a flue-gas stack. The equation assumes that the molar mass of the flue gas and the outside air are equal and that the [[friction|frictional resistance]] and heat losses are negligible:.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arch.hku.hk/teaching/lectures/airvent/sect03.htm Natural Ventilation Lecture 3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060702065714/http://www.arch.hku.hk/teaching/lectures/airvent/sect03.htm |date=2006-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Q = CA\sqrt {2gH\frac{T_i - T_o}{T_i}}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* ''Q'': flue-gas flow-rate, m¬≥/s  
* ''A'': cross-sectional area of chimney, m¬≤ (assuming it has a constant cross-section)  
* ''C'' : discharge coefficient (usually taken to be 0.65‚Äì0.70)
* ''g'': [[standard gravity|gravitational acceleration at sea level]] = 9.807&amp;nbsp;m/s¬≤ 
* ''H'' : height of chimney, m 
* ''T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' : absolute average temperature of the flue gas in the stack, [[kelvin|K]]
* ''T&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' : absolute outside air temperature, K

Also, this equation is only valid when the resistance to the draft flow is caused by a single orifice characterized by the discharge coefficient C. In many, if not most situations, the resistance is primarily imposed by the flue stack itself. In these cases, the resistance is proportional to the stack height H. This causes a cancellation of the H in the above equation predicting Q to be invariant with respect to the flue height.

Designing chimneys and stacks to provide the correct amount of natural draft involves a great many factors such as:

* The height and diameter of the stack.
* The desired amount of excess combustion air needed to assure complete combustion.
* The temperature of the flue gases leaving the combustion zone.
* The composition of the combustion flue gas, which determines the flue-gas density.
* The frictional resistance to the flow of the flue gases through the chimney or stack, which will vary with the materials used to construct the chimney or stack.
* The heat loss from the flue gases as they flow through the chimney or stack.
* The local atmospheric pressure of the ambient air, which is determined by the local elevation above sea level.

The calculation of many of the above design factors requires trial-and-error reiterative methods.

Government agencies in most countries have specific codes which govern how such design calculations must be performed. Many non-governmental organizations also have codes governing the design of chimneys and stacks (notably, the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers|ASME]] codes).

==Stack design==
The design of large stacks poses considerable engineering challenges.  [[Vortex shedding]] in high winds can cause dangerous [[oscillations]] in the stack, and may lead to its collapse.  The use of helical faring is common to prevent this process occurring at or close to the [[resonant frequency]] of the stack.

==Other items of interest==

Some fuel-burning industrial equipment does not rely upon natural draft.  Many such equipment items use large fans or blowers to accomplish the same objectives, namely: the flow of combustion air into the combustion chamber and the flow of the hot flue gas out of the chimney or stack.

A great many power plants are equipped with facilities for the removal of [[sulfur dioxide]] (i.e., [[flue-gas desulfurization]]), [[nitrogen oxides]] (i.e., [[selective catalytic reduction]], [[exhaust gas recirculation]], thermal deNOx, or low NOx burners) and particulate matter (i.e., [[electrostatic precipitator]])s. At such power plants, it is possible to use a [[cooling tower]] as a flue gas stack. Examples can be seen in Germany at the [[Power Station Staudinger Grosskrotzenburg]] and at the [[Rostock Power Station]]. Power plants without flue gas purification, would experience serious corrosion in such stacks.

In the United States and a number of other countries, [[atmospheric dispersion modeling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, Milton R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}} [http://www.air-dispersion.com www.air-dispersion.com]&lt;/ref&gt; studies are required to determine the flue gas stack height needed to comply with the local [[air pollution]] regulations. The United States also limits the maximum height of a flue gas stack to what is known as the "Good Engineering Practice (GEP)" stack height.&lt;ref&gt;''Guideline for Determination of Good Engineering Practice Stack Height (Technical Support Document for the Stack Height Regulations), Revised'' (1985), EPA Publication No. EPA‚Äì450/4‚Äì80‚Äì023R, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (NTIS No. PB 85‚Äì225241)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, Jr., R.E. and W.H. Snyder (1983). ''Determination of Good Engineering Practice Stack Height: A Demonstration Study for a Power Plant'', EPA Publication No. EPA‚Äì600/3‚Äì83‚Äì024. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (NTIS No. PB 83‚Äì207407)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of existing flue gas stacks that exceed the GEP stack height, any air pollution dispersion modelling studies for such stacks must use the GEP stack height rather than the actual stack height.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1367">A '''hydrospring''' is a [[Machine|mechanical device]] that performs a similar function to a [[Spring (device)|spring]]. The advantage of a hydrospring over a normal spring is the increased damping that it performs. The damping is achieved by [[hydraulic fluid]] (typically [[oil]]) being driven through holes in a piston, as that piston moves in response to a force.

Hydrosprings are used in a variety of applications: [[shock absorbers]], vibration dampers on train suspension, [[bulldozer]] blade shock absorbers and as recoil absorbers for [[artillery]].

An '''infrared heater''' or '''heat lamp''' is a body with a higher temperature which transfers energy to a body with a lower temperature through electromagnetic radiation. Depending on the temperature of the emitting body, the wavelength of the peak of the [[infrared radiation]] ranges from {{val|780|u=nm}} to 1&amp;nbsp;mm. No contact or medium between the two bodies is needed for the energy transfer. Infrared heaters can be operated in vacuum or atmosphere.

One classification of infrared heaters is by the wavelength bands of infrared emission.

* Short wave or near infrared for the range from {{val|780|u=nm}} to {{val|1400|u=nm}}, these emitters are also named bright because still some visible light is emitted;
* Medium infrared for the range between {{val|1400|u=nm}} and {{val|3000|u=nm}};
* Far infrared or dark emitters for everything above {{val|3000|u=nm}}.

==History==
German-British [[astronomer]] [[William Herschel|Sir William Herschel]] is credited with the discovery of [[infrared]] in 1800. He made an instrument called a [[spectrometer]] to measure the magnitude of radiant power at different [[wavelengths]]. This instrument was made from three pieces. The first was a prism to catch the sunlight and direct and disperse the colors down onto a table, the second was a small panel of cardboard with a slit wide enough for only a single color to pass through it and finally, three mercury-in-glass [[thermometers]]. Through his experiment Herschel found that red light had the highest degree of temperature change in the [[light spectrum]], however, infrared heating was not commonly used until [[World War II]]. During World War II infrared heating became more widely used and recognized. The main applications were in the metal finishing fields, particularly in the curing and drying of paints and lacquers on military equipment. Banks of lamp bulbs were used very successfully but by today's standards, the power intensities were very low. The technique offered much faster drying times than the fuel convection ovens of the time. Production bottlenecks were mitigated and military supplies to the armed forces were maintained. After World War II the adoption of infrared heating techniques continued but on a much slower basis. In the mid 1950s the motor vehicle industry began to show interest in the capabilities of infrared for paint curing and a number of production line infrared tunnels came into use.

Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Technology Guidebook for Electric Infrared Process Heating, Cincinnati: Infrared Equipment Association,1993. Battelle Columbus Division, Electric&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements==
The most common filament material used for electrical infrared heaters is [[tungsten]] wire, which is coiled to provide more surface area. Low temperature alternatives for tungsten are [[carbon]], or alloys of iron, chromium, and aluminum (trademark and brand name ''[[Kanthal (alloy)|Kanthal]]'').  While carbon filaments are more fickle to produce, they heat up much more quickly than a comparable medium-wave heater based on a FeCrAl filament.

When light is undesirable or not necessary in a heater, ceramic infrared radiant heaters are the preferred choice. Containing 8 meters of coiled alloy resistance wire, they emit a uniform heat across the entire surface of the heater and the ceramic is 90% absorbent of the radiation. As absorption and emission are based on the same physical causes in each body, ceramic is ideally suited as a material for infrared heaters.

Industrial infrared heaters sometimes use a gold coating on the quartz tube that reflects the infrared radiation and directs it towards the product to be heated. Consequently, the infrared radiation impinging on the product is virtually doubled. Gold is used because of its oxidation resistance and very high infrared reflectivity of approximately 95%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvu.com/PNextGenTFWeb.html Next Generation Transparent Furnace], Dr. Stephen C. Bates&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Infrared heaters are commonly used in infrared modules (or emitter banks) combining several heaters to achieve larger heated areas.

Infrared heaters are usually classified by the [[wavelength]] they emit:

Near infrared (NIR) or short-wave infrared heaters operate at high filament temperatures above {{val|1800|u=degC}} and when arranged in a field reach high power densities of some hundreds of kW/m{{sup|2}}. Their peak wavelength is well below the absorption spectrum for water, making them unsuitable for many drying applications. They are well suited for heating of silica where a deep penetration is needed.

Medium-wave and carbon (CIR) infrared heaters operate at filament temperatures of around {{val|1000|u=degC}}. They reach maximum power densities of up to {{val|60|u=kW/m{{sup|2}}}} (medium-wave) and {{val|150|u=kW/m{{sup|2}}}} (CIR).

Far infrared emitters (FIR) are typically used in the so-called low-temperature far [[infrared sauna]]s. These constitute only the higher and more expensive range of the market of infrared sauna. Instead of using carbon, quartz or high watt ceramic emitters, which emit near and medium infrared radiation, heat and light, far infrared emitters use low watt ceramic plates that remain cold, while still emitting far infrared radiation.

The relationship between temperature and peak wavelength is expressed by [[Wien's displacement law]].

===Metal wire element===
Metal wire heating elements first appeared in the 1920s. These elements consist of wire made from chromel. [[Chromel]] is made from [[nickel]] and [[chromium|chrome]] and it is also known as [[nichrome]]. This wire was then coiled into a spiral and wrapped around a ceramic body. When heated to high temperatures it forms a protective layer of [[chromium-oxide]] which protects the wire from burning and corrosion, this also causes the element to glow.&lt;ref&gt;Primer of Lamps and Lightning; Willard Allphin, P.E.; Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, third edition 1973; {{ISBN|0-201-00170-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heat lamps===
A [[heat lamp]] is an [[incandescent light bulb]] that is used for the principal purpose of creating heat. The spectrum of [[black body radiation]] emitted by the lamp is shifted to produce more [[infrared light]]. Many heat lamps include a red filter to minimize the amount of visible light emitted. Heat lamps often include an internal reflector.

Heat lamps are commonly used in shower and bathrooms to warm bathers and in food-preparation areas of restaurants to keep food warm before serving. They are also commonly used for [[animal husbandry]]. Lights used for poultry are often called brooding lamps. Aside from young [[bird]]s, other types of [[animal]]s which can benefit from heat lamps include [[reptile]]s, [[amphibian]]s, [[insect]]s, [[arachnid]]s, and the young of some [[mammal]]s.

The sockets used for heat lamps are usually [[ceramic]] because [[plastic]] sockets can melt or burn when exposed to the large amount of waste heat produced by the lamps, especially when operated in the "base up" position. The shroud or hood of the lamp is generally metal. There may be a wire guard over the front of the shroud, to prevent touching the hot surface of the bulb.

Ordinary household white incandescent bulbs can also be [[Heatball|used as heat lamps]], but red and blue bulbs are sold for use in brood lamps and reptile lamps. 250-[[watt]] heat lamps are commonly packaged in the "R40" (5" reflector lamp) form factor with an intermediate screw base.

Heat lamps can be used as a medical treatment to provide dry heat when other treatments are ineffective or impractical.&lt;ref Name="Hirsch"&gt;

===Ceramic infrared heat systems===
Ceramic infrared heating elements are used in a diverse range of industrial processes where long wave infrared radiation is required. Their useful wavelength range is 2‚Äì10&amp;nbsp;¬µm. They are often used in the area of animal/pet healthcare too.  The ceramic infrared heaters (emitters) are manufactured with three basic emitter faces: trough (concave), flat, and bulb or Edison screw element for normal installation via an E27 ceramic lamp holder.

===Far-infrared===
This heating technology is used in some expensive infrared saunas. It is also found in space heaters. These heaters use low watt density ceramic emitters (usually fairly big panels) which emit long wave infrared radiation. Because the heating elements are at a relatively low temperature, far-infrared heaters do not give emissions and smell from dust, dirt, formaldehyde, toxic fumes from paint-coating, etc. This has made this type of space heating very popular among people with severe allergies and [[multiple chemical sensitivity]] in Europe. Because far infrared technology does not heat the air of the room directly, it is important to maximize the exposure of available surfaces which then re-emit the warmth to provide an even all round ambient warmth.

===Quartz heat lamps===
[[File:Clear Quartz Element Example.jpg|thumb|upright=0.26|Clear quartz element]]
Halogen lamps are [[incandescent lamps]] filled with highly pressurized [[inert gas]]. This gas is combined with a small amount of  [[halogen]] gas ([[bromine]] or [[iodine]]) which causes tungsten atoms to regenerate by lessening the evaporation of the filament. This leads to a much longer life of halogen lamps than other incandescent lamps. Due to the high pressure and temperature halogen lamps produce, they are relatively small and made out of [[quartz glass]] because it has a higher melting point than standard [[glass]]. Common uses for halogen lamps are table top heaters.&lt;ref&gt;Heat-dissipating Light Fixture for Use with Tungsten-halogen Lamps. Allen R. Groh, assignee. Patent 4780799. 25 Oct. 1988. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, F. "Modelling of Infrared Heating of Thermoplastic Sheet Used in Thermoforming Process." Journal of Materials Processing Technology 143-144 (2003): 225-31. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Quartz infrared heating elements emit medium wave infrared energy and are particularly effective in systems where rapid heater response is required. Tubular infrared lamps in quartz bulbs produce infrared radiation in wavelengths of 1.5‚Äì8&amp;nbsp;¬µm. The enclosed filament operates at around {{val|2500|u=K}}, producing more shorter-wavelength radiation than open wire-coil sources. Developed in the 1950s at [[General Electric]], these lamps produce about {{val|100|u=W/in}} ({{val|4|u=W/mm}}) and can be combined to radiate 500 watts per square foot ({{val|5400|u=W/m2}}). To achieve even higher power densities, [[halogen lamp]]s were used. Quartz infrared lamps are used in highly polished reflectors to direct radiation in a uniform and concentrated pattern.

Quartz heat lamps are used in food processing, chemical processing, paint drying, and thawing of frozen materials. They can also be used for comfort heating in cold areas, in incubators, and in other applications for heating, drying, and baking.  During development of space re-entry vehicles, banks of quartz infrared lamps were used to test heat shield materials at power densities as high as 28&amp;nbsp;kilowatts/square foot (300&amp;nbsp;kW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Kane, Heinz Sell ''Revolution in lamps: a chronicle of 50 years of progress (2nd ed.)'', The Fairmont Press, Inc. 2001 {{ISBN|0-88173-378-4}} chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Most common designs consist of either a satin [[Fused quartz|milky-white quartz glass]] tube or clear [[quartz]] with an electrically resistant element, usually a [[Tungsten filament#Filament|tungsten wire]], or a thin coil of iron-chromium-aluminum alloy. The atmospheric air is removed and filled with inert gases such as [[nitrogen]] and [[argon]] then sealed. In quartz halogen lamps, a small amount of [[halogen]] gas is added to prolong the heater's operational life.

Much of the [[infrared]] and visible energy released is caused by the direct heating of the [[Fused quartz|quartz]] material, 97% of the near infrared is absorbed by the silica quartz glass tube causing the temperature of the tube wall to increase, this causes the silicon-oxygen bond to radiate far infrared rays.{{cn|date=March 2015}} Quartz glass heating elements were originally designed for lighting applications, but when a lamp is at full power less than 5% of the emitted energy is in the visible spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/research/solarthermal/solar_cooker/documents/reflectivematerialsreport.pdf Investigation of Reflective Materials for the Solar Cooker]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quartz tungsten===
[[File:Quartz heater.jpg|thumb|Quartz heater]]
Quartz tungsten infrared heaters emit medium wave energy reaching [[operating temperature]]s of up to {{val|1500|u=degC}} (medium wave) and {{val|2600|u=degC}} (short wave). They reach operating temperature within seconds. Peak wavelength emissions of approximately 1.6&amp;nbsp;¬µm (medium wave infrared) and 1&amp;nbsp;¬µm (short wave infrared).

===Carbon heater===
[[File:Carbon Fibre Heater.jpg|thumb|Carbon Fiber Heater]]
Carbon heaters use a [[Carbon (fiber)|carbon fiber]] heating element capable of producing long, medium and short wave [[far infrared]] heat. They need to be accurately specified for the spaces to be heated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heraeus|title=Understanding Infrared Heating|url=http://noblelight.net/resources/pdf_downloads/booklet/booklet.pdf|publisher=Heraeus Noblelight|accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gas-fired===
There are two basic types of infrared radiant heaters.
* Luminous or high intensity
* Radiant tube heaters
Radiant tube gas-fired heaters used for industrial and commercial building space heating burn [[natural gas]] or [[propane]] to heat a steel emitter tube. Gas passing through a control [[valve]] flows through a [[cup burner]] or a [[Venturi tube|venturi]]. The combustion product gases heat the emitter tube.  As the tube heats, radiant energy from the tube strikes floors and other objects in the area, warming them. This form of heating maintains warmth even when a large volume of cold air is suddenly introduced, such as in maintenance [[Automobile repair shop|garages]]. They cannot however, combat a cold draught.

The efficiency of an infrared heater is a rating of the total energy consumed by the heater compared to the amount of infrared energy generated. While there will always be some amount of convective heat generated through the process, any introduction of air motion across the heater will reduce its infrared conversion efficiency. With new untarnished reflectors, radiant tubes have a downward radiant efficiency of about 60%. (The other 40% comprises unrecoverable upwards radiant and convective losses, and flue losses.)

==Health effects==
In addition to the dangers of touching the hot bulb or element, high-intensity short-wave infrared radiation may cause indirect thermal burns when the skin is exposed for too long or the heater is positioned too close to the subject.  Individuals exposed to large amounts of infrared radiation (like glass blowers and arc welders) over an extended period of time may develop depigmentation of the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] and opacity of the [[aqueous humor]], so exposure should be moderated.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20060220181822/http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/0753.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efficiency==
Electrically-heated infrared heaters radiate up to 86% of their input as radiant energy.&lt;ref&gt;''2008 ASHRAE Handbook - Heating, Ventilating, and Air-Conditioning Systems and Equipment (I-P Edition)'', American Society of. Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc., 2008, Electronic {{ISBN|978-1-60119-795-5}}, table 2 page 15.3&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all the electrical energy input is converted into infrared [[radiative heat transfer|radiant heat]] in the filament and directed onto the target by reflectors. Some heat energy is removed from the heating element by [[Conduction (heat)|conduction]] or [[Convective heat transfer|convection]], which may be no loss at all for some designs where all of the electrical energy is desired in the heated space, or may be considered a loss, in situations where only the radiative heat transfer is desired or productive. 

For practical applications, the efficiency of the infrared heater depends on matching the emitted wavelength and the absorption spectrum of the material to be heated. For example, the absorption spectrum for [[water]] has its peak at around {{val|3000|u=nm}}. This means that emission from medium-wave or carbon infrared heaters is much better absorbed by water and water-based coatings than NIR or short-wave infrared radiation.  The same is true for many [[plastics]] like PVC or polyethylene. Their peak absorption is around {{val|3500|u=nm}}. On the other hand, some metals absorb only in the short-wave range and show a strong reflectivity in the medium and far infrared. This makes a careful selection of the right infrared heater type important for energy efficiency in the heating process.{{fact|date=March 2015}}

Ceramic elements operate in the temperature of {{convert|300|to|700|¬∞C|¬∞F|-1}} producing infrared wavelengths in the 2000 to {{val|10000|u=nm}} range. Most plastics and many other materials absorb infrared best in this range, which makes the ceramic heater most suited for this task.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Applications==
[[File:D√∂ner kebab slicing.jpg|thumb|upright|Infrared heater for cooking [[Doner kebab|d√∂ner kebab]]]]
IR heaters can satisfy a variety of heating requirements, including:

* Extremely high temperatures, limited largely by the maximum temperature of the emitter
* Fast response time, on the order of 1‚Äì2 seconds
* Temperature gradients, especially on [[Web (manufacturing)|material webs]] with high heat input
* Focused heated area relative to conductive and convective heating methods
* Non-contact, thereby not disturbing the product as conductive or convective heating methods do

Thus, IR heaters are applied for many purposes including:

* Heating systems
* Curing of coatings
* [[Shrink tunnel|Plastic shrinking]]
* Plastic heating prior to forming
* Plastic welding
* Glass &amp; metal [[heat treating]]
* Cooking
* Warming suckling animals or captive animals in zoos or veterinary clinics

'''Kudurru''' was a type of stone document used as [[boundary stone]]s and as records of [[land grant]]s to [[vassal]]s by the [[Kassites]] in ancient [[Babylonia]] between the 16th and 12th centuries BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The kudurrus are the only surviving artworks for the period of Kassite rule in [[Babylonia]] with examples kept in the [[Louvre]], the [[British Museum]], and the [[National Museum of Iraq]].

The kudurrus recorded the land granted by the king to his vassals as a record of his decision. The original kudurru would be stored in a temple while the person granted the land would be given a clay copy to use as a boundary stone to confirm legal ownership.

The kudurrus would contain symbolic images of the deities who were protecting the contract, the contract, and the divine curse that would be placed on a person who broke the contract. Some kudurrus also contained an image of the king who granted the land. As they contained a great deal of images as well as a contract, kudurrus were engraved on large slabs of stone.

==List of kudurrus==
Kassite-era kudurrus, in approximate chronological order:

*[[Enlil-bƒÅnƒ´ land grant kudurru]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4319">The two-seater prototype pod has been built by [[Coventry]]-based RDM Group, and was first shown to the public in February 2015.

The LUTZ (Low-carbon Urban Transport Zone)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Graeme|title=Midland firm chosen to make UK first driverless cars|url=http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/business/business-news/midland-firm-chosen-make-uk-7115011|website=Birmingham Post|accessdate=19 February 2015|date=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pathfinder pod is part of the UK Government's Transport Systems [[Catapult centres|Catapult]] Autodrive project, a {{GBP}}20 million project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burn-Callander|first1=Rebecca|title=This is the Lutz pod, the UK's first driverless car|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/businessclub/technology/11403306/This-is-the-Lutz-pod-the-UKs-first-driverless-car.html|website=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=11 February 2015|date=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three pods were tested initially in [[Milton Keynes]] during 2015 to ensure that they can comply with the [[Highway Code]].  A further trial, with a four seat vehicle developed from the LUTZ, commenced along a guided busway near [[Cambridge]] for possible use in an after hours service.&lt;ref name="cambridgetrial"&gt;{{cite web|title=Trials begin of driverless pods that could be used alongside night buses in Cambridge (but they'll only travel at 15mph)|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-5008313/Driverless-pods-replace-night-buses-Cambridge.html|accessdate=25 October 2017|date=October 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specification==
The pod is a two-seater electric car with space for luggage. It has a limited top speed of {{convert|15|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}} and has a range of {{convert|40|mi|km|0|}} or can run for eight hours.

'''Lifeline Energy''' (formerly '''Freeplay Foundation''') is a non-profit social enterprise that provides technology solutions for off-grid learning. The organization designs, manufactures and distributes solar and wind-up media players and radios for classroom and group listening and was behind the first solar and wind-up radio for humanitarian use which launched in 2003. Since it began operations in 1999 more than 550,000 wind-up and solar powered radios and media players have been distributed, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa.  Millions of listeners have been reached, as classrooms of up to 60 children or listening groups can use each radio or media player.

Lifeline Energy is a [[501 (c) (3)]] US charity and a Section 18A and 21 South African public benefit organisation, and relies on contributions from individuals, family foundations, corporate funding and government-sponsored programmes. It collaborates with governments, international relief organizations and in-country NGO partners to implement education and information projects. In 2009, it established Lifeline Technologies Trading Ltd, a for-profit new product development and trading arm that designs and develops the products that Lifeline Energy uses in its projects. This is a relatively unique hybrid business structure with '''Lifeline Technology'''‚Äôs profits accruing to the charity.

''[[The Times]]'', a UK newspaper, selected Lifeline Energy (then known as Freeplay Foundation) as a beneficiary for its 2005/2006 Christmas Charity Appeal. The organization was also awarded the first annual [[Tech Museum of Innovation Award]] in the education category in 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifelineenergy.org/ar_FF1101.html |title=Freeplay Foundation Wins Technology Benefiting Humanity Award |deadurl=yes |accessdate=11 January 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206181733/http://lifelineenergy.org/ar_FF1101.html |archivedate= 6 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and won the Energy Project award in the [[World Bank‚Äôs Development Marketplace]] in 2006.

The Lifeplayer MP3 was awarded a top prize in the inaugural SAB Foundation Innovation awards in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sulaiman |first=Uzma |url=http://www.lifelineenergy.org/SABFoundationInnovationsAwards.html |title=Lifeplayer MP3 Wins A Top Prize In SAB Foundation Innovations Awards |deadurl=yes |accessdate=11 January 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614190647/http://www.lifelineenergy.org/SABFoundationInnovationsAwards.html |archivedate=14 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also chosen as a finalist in the [[INDEX: Design to Improve Life award]] in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.designtoimprovelife.dk/index.php?option=com_content_custom&amp;view=article&amp;id=565:finalist2011&amp;catid=32:finalists-2011&amp;Itemid=302&amp;Itemid=302 |title=Lifeplayer |accessdate=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Freeplay Foundation was legally established in late 1998 by Rory Stear, the co-founder of Freeplay Energy Group. Freeplay Energy, which by then was a public company, was sold in July 2008 to Delhi-based businessman Devin Narang. Rory Stear ‚Äì along with all other directors - resigned from Freeplay Energy Group in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/rahimkanani/2011/11/01/kristine-pearson-on-the-founding-and-future-of-lifeline-energy/#1ba2c5792b66|title = Kristine Pearson on the Founding and Future of Lifeline Energy|last = Kanani|first = Rahim|website = Forbes|access-date = 2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Lifeline Energy runs under the direction of Chief Executive Officer, Kristine Pearson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20149891,00.html |title=Radio Power |author=Pam Lambert |date=19 April 2004 |accessdate=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has held this position since January 1999 when the charity became operational.

On 8 April 2010 the Freeplay Foundation changed its name to Lifeline Energy. The name change reflects the organisation‚Äôs desire to not only develop and distribute radios and other communication tools, but also a range of other practical, fit-for-purpose products for the poor.

Over the years Lifeline Energy has implemented information and education projects using solar and wind-up radios in more than a dozen countries in sub-Saharan Africa.  These include Rwanda, South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, Niger, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Burundi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Sudan and Sudan.

Donors have included [[Anglo American PLC]], [[the Body Shop]], [[Vodafone Group]] Foundation, [[Asda]], [[NASDAQ]], CARE, Vodacom, the Founders and Supporters of [http://www.thetomhanksday.com International Tom Hanks Day] and the [[World Bank]]. Gordon Roddick, co-founder and former chairman of [[The Body Shop]] International plc said in an interview with [[The Times]], London "Radio is the perfect way of getting quality education to a wide area incredibly cheaply."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/business/industries/media/article2180216.ece |title=Radio gives a lifeline to Africa's children |publisher=The Times |author=Martin Waller |date=December 26, 2005 |accessdate=11 January 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Lifeline Energy is technology agnostic and focused on finding appropriate ways to improve the lives of those it aims to assist. It seeks technology solutions to meet these challenges ‚Äì whether high or low tech. As with its Lifeplayer MP3, Lifeline Energy encapsulates known technologies (solar, battery, audio, radio, MP3) in products that are developed to meet the challenges of the environment and social contexts of their use. Products must be robust, intuitive in their function and sustainable, even for the least sophisticated users.

==The Lifeplayer MP3==

The Lifeplayer MP3 was launched to the media in September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nerenberg |first=Jenara |title=Lifeplayer, the MP3 Radio for the World's Most Forgotten |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1689361/lifeplayer-mp3-radio-worlds-most-forgotten |publisher=Fast Company |accessdate=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the world‚Äôs first MP3, 5-band radio and recorder designed specifically for humanitarian use and group listening.  Solar-powered and wind-up, it was designed to give large groups of up to 50 people sustainable listening access. Listening content is pre-loaded on a microSD card, and the Lifeplayer can record live voice or radio programmes for playback later.

In 2011, the Lifeplayer MP3 was launched in a project for farmers in Rwanda, in partnership with the multinational giant SC Johnson and a US-based NGO, Radio Lifeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SC Johnson Introduces New Radio Technology to Remote Rwanda Communities |url=http://www.scjohnson.com/en/press-room/press-releases/02-02-2012/SC-Johnson-Introduces-New-Radio-Technology-to-Remote-Rwanda-Communities.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative disseminated information on modern farming techniques, market information and health news to Rwandan pyrethrum farmers via MP3 podcasts and a monthly nationwide FM radio programme. Since then, it has been used in a number of initiatives, including school lessons for children, health information for women's listening groups, and conservation and farming skills for farmers.

The Lifeplayer was created and developed by Lifeline Energy and Lifeline Technologies. Its approach to new product development is end-user focused and based on field feedback.  The development funding was raised through private donations. 
Supporters of the Lifeplayer include James Kimonyo - Rwanda's Ambassador to the U.S. - as well as Academy Award winner Tom Hanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Leigh |first=Elizah |title=Tom Hanks-Funded Solar Digital Lifeplayer Radio Offering Link To Outside World |url=http://www.ecorazzi.com/2010/09/17/tom-hanks-funded-solar-digital-lifeplayer-radio-offering-link-to-outside-world/ |publisher=Ecorazzi |accessdate=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Prime==

The Prime radio replaced the Lifeline radio - the first solar and wind-up radio made exclusively for the humanitarian sector&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sulaiman |first=Uzma |title=Lifeline Energy's New Prime radio |url=http://lifelineenergy.org/prime-radio.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824142357/http://lifelineenergy.org/prime-radio.html |archivedate=24 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and which Lifeline Energy and Kristine Pearson innovated. Prime radios can reach up to 60 listeners and has five bands ‚Äì AM, FM and three short-wave bandwidths. It also features an LCD screen, a solar panel, a hand crank, and a DC input that can be plugged into either a wall socket or a car battery. The solar panels can charge the radio directly through a cable or can charge wirelessly.

The Prime radio improves on its predecessor, the Lifeline. In 2001, the Lifeline radio concept won the first Tech Museum of Innovation Award for Technology Benefiting Humanity for Lifeline Energy, in the education category. During the development the organisation arranged focus groups of orphaned children in South Africa, Kenya and Rwanda. The focus group findings determined that the radio needed to be a bright colour, easy to carry and robust.

==Energy poverty and lighting research==

Since its inception, Lifeline Energy has undertaken in-depth research into the effects of energy poverty, specifically how it relates to lighting and energy access, in remote areas throughout sub-Saharan Africa. 
Research was conducted in rural and peri-urban slum areas of South Africa to determine how much child and grandmother-headed families spent on candles and kerosene for lighting per month. The research involved looking at the types of tasks and activities that were used for lighting and the consequences people experienced as a result of their not having any access to electricity.

==Zambia‚Äôs Learning at Taonga Market Education Initiative==
Since 2000 Lifeline Energy has been helping to provide education access to vulnerable children taking part in the Learning at Taonga Market radio distance education initiative in Zambia. The programme offers a high quality primary school education to children who are unable to access government-run schools. Since the Zambian Ministry of Education launched it, close to 800,000 children have obtained a basic primary education.

Learning at Taonga Market is entirely free and has had a profound effect on orphaned children, who are often left out of Zambia‚Äôs education system. The informal classrooms are run by community volunteers who use Lifeline Energy‚Äôs solar and wind-up radios and Lifeplayers to access the daily radio broadcasts. Children taking part in Taonga Market performed better than conventional schools in reading, numeracy and life skills. Taonga Market students are also more likely to continue to secondary school than children in government-run schools.

==Information and Education Access in Dadaab Refugee Camps==

Since 2007 Lifeline Energy has distributed more than 1,100 solar and wind-up radios in the Dadaab refugee camps and nearby host communities, benefitting more than 15,000 Somali women directly. The radios provide access to programming on women‚Äôs rights, health and controversial issues such as female genital cutting. The radios also provide access to daily broadcasts on where refugees can attain food aid, how new refugees can register and where to locate lost relatives who have also travelled to the camps from neighboring countries.

The radios have also helped educate children. Using Lifeline Energy‚Äôs radios, children are able to access radio-based primary education lessons in Somali.

==Ambassadors==
'''Tom Hanks'''

Since 2003, Academy Award winner [[Tom Hanks]] has served as Lifeline Energy's American ambassador. He supports a range of projects including Lifeline radios for distance education in [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edc.org/newsroom/articles/tom_hanks_freeplay_foundation_donate_radios_edc_project_tanzania |title=Tom Hanks, Lifeline Energy Donate Radios to EDC Project in Tanzania |publisher=Education Development Center, Inc |date=May 31, 2005 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=11 January 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102020102/http://www.edc.org/newsroom/articles/tom_hanks_freeplay_foundation_donate_radios_edc_project_tanzania |archivedate= 2 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the organisation's Child Headed Household Lifeline radio project in [[Rwanda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/264196 |title=Lifelights Aims To Light Up Orphaned Households In Rwanda |author=K J Mullins |date=30 December 2008 |accessdate=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanks also is the primary funder behind the research and development of Lifelight.

Hanks participated in an [[eBay]] charity auction in which ten Lifeline radios autographed by Hanks were available. In addition to the radio, the highest bidder also received a personal letter and a signed photo from Hanks. During the campaign, Hanks stated that "The Lifeline radio can change the world ‚Äì one person, one house, one village at a time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tom Hanks Helps Africa with Lifeline Radios |date=23 January 2008 |url=http://www.etonline.com/news/2008/01/57772/index.html |accessdate=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a partial list of temperature phenomena that have been labeled as [[heat wave]]s, listed in order of occurrence.

== Before 1900 ==
* [[July 1757 heatwave]], Europe, hottest summer in 500 years prior to 2003.
* [[1896 Eastern North America heat wave]] killed 1,500 people in August 1896.

== 20th century ==
* 1900 ‚Äì The historical heatwave of the center of [[Argentina]] between the first eight days of February 1900 known as "the week of fire" affects the city of Buenos Aires and Rosario with temperatures of up to 37&amp;nbsp;¬∞C (98.6&amp;nbsp;¬∞F) but with a very high index of humidity that elevates the sensation of heat to 49&amp;nbsp;¬∞C (120.2&amp;nbsp;¬∞F) severely affecting the health of people causing at least more than 478 fatalities.
* [[1901 eastern United States heat wave]] killed 9,500 in the eastern United States.
* 1906 ‚Äì During the [[1906 United Kingdom heat wave]] which began in August and lasted into September broke numerous records. On the 2nd temperatures reached 36&amp;nbsp;¬∞C (96&amp;nbsp;¬∞F) which still holds the September record however some places beat their local record during September 1911 and September 2016.
* 1911 ‚Äì The [[1911 United Kingdom heat wave]] was one of the most severe periods of heat to hit the country with temperatures around 36&amp;nbsp;¬∞C (97&amp;nbsp;¬∞F). The heat began in early July and didn't let up until mid September where even in September temperatures were still up to 33&amp;nbsp;¬∞C (92&amp;nbsp;¬∞F). It took 79 years for temperature higher to be recorded in the United Kingdom during [[1990 United Kingdom heat wave]].
* 1923‚Äì1924 ‚Äì During a period of 160 such days from 31 October 1923 to 7 April 1924, the [[Western Australia]]n town of [[Marble Bar, Western Australia|Marble]] reached {{convert|100|¬∞F|¬∞C|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="climateextremes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/c20thc/temp1.htm|title=Marble Bar heatwave, 1923‚Äì1924|work=Australian Climate Extremes|publisher=[[Bureau of Meteorology]]|accessdate=21 September 2008|archiveurl=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/96122/20090317-1643/www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/c20thc/temp1.html|archivedate=17 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1936 ‚Äì  The [[1936 North American heat wave]] during the [[Dust Bowl]], followed one of the coldest winters on record‚Äîthe [[1936 North American cold wave]]. Massive heat waves across North America were persistent in the 1930s, many mid-Atlantic/Ohio valley states recorded their highest temperatures during July 1934. The longest continuous string of {{convert|100|¬∞F|¬∞C}} or higher temperatures was reached for 101 days in Yuma, Arizona during 1937 and the highest temperatures ever reached in Canada were recorded in two locations in [[Saskatchewan]] in July 1937.
* 1950s ‚Äì A prolonged severe drought and heat wave occurred in the early 1950s throughout the central and southern United States. In some areas it was drier than during the Dust Bowl and the heat wave in most areas was within the top five on record. The heat was particularly severe in 1954 with 22 days of temperatures exceeding {{convert|100|¬∞F|¬∞C}} covering significant parts of eleven states. On 14 July, the thermometer reached {{convert|117|¬∞F|¬∞C}} at [[East St. Louis, Illinois]], which remains the record highest temperature for that state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Westcott |first = Nancy E. |title = The Prolonged 1954 Midwestern U.S. Heat Wave: Impacts and Responses |journal = Wea.

* 1955 - The [[1955 United Kingdom heat wave]] was a period of hot weather that was accompanied by drought. In some places it was the worst drought on record, more severe than 1976 and 1995.
* 1960 2 January - [[Oodnadatta]], South Australia hit {{convert|50.7|¬∞C|¬∞F}} degrees, the highest temperature ever recorded in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] and Oceania.
* 1972 ‚Äì The heat waves of 1972 in New York and Northeastern United States were significant. Almost 900 people perished; the heat conditions lasted almost 16 days, aggravated by very high humidity levels.
* 1976 ‚Äì The [[1976 United Kingdom heat wave]] was one of the hottest in living memory and was marked by constant blue skies from May until September when dramatic thunderstorms signaled the heat wave's end.
* 1980 ‚Äì An estimated 1,000 people perished in the [[1980 United States heat wave]] and drought, which impacted the central and eastern United States. Temperatures were highest in the southern plains. From June through September, temperatures remained above {{convert|90|¬∞F|¬∞C}} all but two days in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. The [[Dallas/Fort Worth]] area experienced 42 consecutive days with high temperatures above {{convert|100|¬∞F|¬∞C}}, with temperatures reaching {{convert|117|¬∞F|¬∞C}} at [[Wichita Falls, Texas]] on 28 June. Economic losses were $20&amp;nbsp;billion (1980 dollars).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Billion Dollar U.S. Weather Disasters |publisher=National Climatic Data Center |url=http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/reports/billionz.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010915155936/http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/reports/billionz.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 September 2001 |accessdate=15 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1983 ‚Äì During the Summer of 1983 temperatures over {{convert|100|¬∞F|¬∞C}} were common across [[Iowa]], [[Missouri]], [[Illinois]], [[Michigan]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Indiana]], [[Ohio]], [[Minnesota]], [[Nebraska]], and certain parts of [[Kentucky]]; the summer of 1983 remains one of the hottest summers ever recorded in many of the states affected. The hundred-degree readings were accompanied by very dry conditions associated with drought affecting the [[Corn Belt]] States and [[Upper Midwest]]. The heat also affected the [[Southeastern U.S.]] and the [[Mid-Atlantic states]] as well that same summer. New York Times represented articles about the heat waves of 1983 affecting the [[Midwest|central United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=St. Louis Bears Brunt of Heat Wave as U.S. Toll Rises|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/24/us/st-louis-bears-brunt-of-heat-wave-as-us-toll-rises.html |accessdate=15 April 2009 | date=24 July 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; This heat wave was associated with the [[I-94 derecho]].
* 1983 ‚Äì The United Kingdom experienced a heatwave during July 1983. This was the hottest month ever recorded until it was beaten in 2006. The heatwave is remembered, not for its extreme heat but the relentless heat with temperatures around 32&amp;nbsp;¬∞C (90&amp;nbsp;¬∞F) every day. Temperature maxima for the month were high but not especially so. 
[[Image:Canicule Europe 2003.jpg|right|thumb|Temperature difference in Europe from the average during the [[2003 European heat wave|European heat wave of 2003]]]]
* 1987 ‚Äì prolonged heat wave from 20 to 31 July in [[Greece]], with more than 1,000 deaths in the area of [[Athens]]. The maximum temperature measured was 41.6&amp;nbsp;¬∞C at 23 July at the center of Athens and in the suburb of [[Nea Philadelphia]], 8&amp;nbsp;km northeast was 43.6&amp;nbsp;¬∞C at 27 July, and were combined with high minima, with the highest being 30.2&amp;nbsp;¬∞C in the center of Athens at 27 July and 29.9&amp;nbsp;¬∞C at 24 July at Nea Philadelfia. The lowest minimum was 25.6&amp;nbsp;¬∞C at the center of Athens. Moreover, humidity was high and wind speeds low, contributing to human discomfort, even during the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = The extreme heat wave of Athens in July 1987 from the point of view of Human Biometeorology |url = http://www.urbanclimate.net/matzarakis/papers/HEAT1987.PDF |authors = Andreas Matzarakis and Helmut Mayer | year = 1991 |journal = Atmospheric Environment |volume = 25B |number = 2| pages = 203‚Äì211|doi=10.1016/0957-1272(91)90055-j |bibcode = 1991AtmEB..25..203M }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1988 - intense heat spells in combination with the [[drought of 1988]], reminiscent of the dust bowl years caused deadly results across the United States. Some 5,000 to 10,000&amp;nbsp;people perished because of constant heat across the United States although-according to many estimates-total death reports run as high as next to 17,000 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Billion Dollar U.S. Weather Disasters |publisher=National Climatic Data Center |url=http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/reports/billionz.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010915155936/http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/reports/billionz.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 September 2001 |accessdate=14 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1990 ‚Äì Cities across the United Kingdom broke their all time temperature records in the dramatic [[1990 United Kingdom heat wave]] temperatures peaked at 37&amp;nbsp;¬∞C (99&amp;nbsp;¬∞F). This led to one of the hottest Augusts on record, records going back to 1659.
* 1995 ‚Äì The [[1995 Chicago heat wave]] produced record high dew point levels and heat indices in the [[Chicago area]] and [[Wisconsin]].

* In China from July to August 2013, the South continued to experience an unusually severe heat wave with exceptionally high temperatures. In multiple regions of [[Zhejiang]], Chongqing, Shanghai, Hunan, and other areas the temperatures soared to over 40 degrees Celsius and lasted for a long time. [[Xinchang]], Zhejiang endured extreme hot weather of 44.1 ‚ÑÉ, on 8 August [[Fenghua]], Zhejiang reached a new all-time record high temperature of 43.5 ‚ÑÉ, [[Changsha]], Hunan in July 2013 achieved a high temperature "Grand Slam", all 31 days in July set a new daily record high temperature of over 35 ‚ÑÉ. [[Hangzhou]] experienced 14 consecutive days over 40 ‚ÑÉ while Xujiahui Station of Shanghai shattered 140 years of meteorological records to set a new all-time record high temperature of 40.8 ‚ÑÉ. Sustained high temperatures caused many people, especially the elderly to get heatstroke or sunstroke, seriously affecting millions of lives. Many areas throughout China endured record high temperatures resulting in multiple continuous meteorological department issued high-temperature orange or red alerts. 2013 saw a wide range of abnormally hot temperatures not seen for the past 60 years of national meteorological records dating back to 1951.
* In July 2013, the United Kingdom experienced the [[2013 heatwave in Ireland and the United Kingdom|warmest July]] since 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/news/releases/archive/2013/warm-july-stats |title=July finishes in top three sunniest and warmest |publisher=[[Met Office]] |accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Argentina heatwave of 2013]] was a historical phenomenon that occurred from 11 December 2013 to 2 January 2014 in the north and center of the country, as well as in northern Patagonia . It was the longest heat wave experienced in [[Argentina]] since records began in 1906 affecting many cities throughout the country.For the first time since the creation of the heat alarm system, a red level alert was issued for several days consecutive for both the city of Buenos Aires and the city of Rosario, which are the cities for which the National Meteorological Service conducts heat waves. From 11 December began to register a marked increase in temperatures, especially the maximum in a vast area of the central and northern Patagonian region, affecting southern [[C√≥rdoba Province, Argentina|C√≥rdoba]], southern [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]], southern [[Entre R√≠os Province|Entre R√≠os]], much of the province of [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], [[La Pampa Province|La Pampa]], east of [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]], east of [[Neuqu√©n Province|Neuqu√©n]] and [[R√≠o Negro Province|R√≠o Negro]]. From day 19 this anomalous situation began to expand towards the north of Argentina and returned to intensify on the central part, arriving to affect to 18 provinces, yielding the same towards 30 December in the central part and between 1¬∫ and 2 January in the extreme north of the country with the passage of a cold front that produced a change of mass of air.
The long persistence of this heat wave (22 days), made the event an exceptional one, breaking several brands in regard to more consecutive days with minimum and maximum temperatures above the average in several meteorological stations of the affected zone.
The National Meteorological Service communicated, through its daily reports, reports on the development of the heat wave.
The strongest point of heat was registered in the city of [[Chamical, province of La Rioja]] with 45.5&amp;nbsp;¬∞C (113,9&amp;nbsp;¬∞F) in the city of [[Santiago del Estero]] (provincial capital) was 45&amp;nbsp;¬∞C (113&amp;nbsp;¬∞F) and in [[Buenos Aires]] (national capital) was 39&amp;nbsp;¬∞C (102,2&amp;nbsp;¬∞F).
The extensive heat wave severely affected the health of thousands of people who needed medical assistance during those days, it is believed that the historical heat wave caused hundreds of victims in different points of the center and north of the country.

*Between [[2015 India heat wave|April to May 2015]], a heat wave occurred in India, killing more than 2200 people in that country's different geographical regions. Daytime temperatures hovered between 45 and 47 ‚ÑÉ (113‚Äì116 F) in parts of two states over the weekend, 3‚Äì7 ‚ÑÉ (5-12F) above normal. Andhra Pradesh was hardest hit, with 1,636 people dying from the heat since mid-April, a government statement said.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9579">[[File:3-inch-montana-flume-stainless-steel.jpg|thumb|3-Inch stainless steel Montana Flumes]]A '''Montana flume''', is a popular modification of the standard [[Parshall flume]]. The Montana flume removes the throat and discharge sections of the Parshall flume, resulting a flume that is lighter in weight, shorter in length, and less costly to manufacture.  Montana flumes are used to measure surface waters, irrigations flows, industrial discharges, and wastewater treatment plant flows.

As a short-throated flume, the Montana flume has a single, specified point of measurement in the contracting section at which the level is measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usbr.gov/pmts/hydraulics_lab/pubs/wmm/chap08_10.html |title=USBR Water Measurement Manual - Chapter 8 - FLUMES, Section 10. Parshall Flumes |publisher=Usbr.gov |accessdate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Montana flume is described in US Bureau of Reclamation's Water Measurement Manual&lt;ref name="Water Measurement Manual"&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Measurement Manual|url=http://www.usbr.gov/pmts/hydraulics_lab/pubs/wmm/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two technical standards MT199127AG&lt;ref name=MT199127AG&gt;{{cite web|title=MT199127AG|url=http://store.msuextension.org/Products/Water-Measurement-Montana-(Short-Parshall)-Flume-(Part-1)__MT199127AG.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; and MT199128AG&lt;ref name=MT199128AG&gt;{{cite web|title=MT199128AG|url=http://store.msuextension.org/Products/Water-Measurement-Montana-(Short-Parshall)-Flume-(Part-2)__MT199128AG.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Montana State University]].

As a modification of the Parshall flume, the design of the Montana flume is standardized under ASTM D1941, ISO 9826:1992, and JIS B7553-1993.  The flumes are not patented and the discharge tables are not copyright protected.

A total of 22 standard sizes of Montana flumes have been developed, covering flow ranges from 0.005 cfs [0.1416 l/s] to 3,280 cfs [92,890 l/s].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openchannelflow.com/flumes/montana-flumes/dimensions |title=Montana Flume Dimensions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lacking the extended throat and discharge sections of the Parshall flume, Montana flumes are not intended for use under submerged conditions.   Where submergence is possible, a full length Parshall flume should be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openchannelflow.com/flumes/montana-flumes/submergence |title=Montana Flume Submergence}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Should submergence occur, investigations have been made into correcting the flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Montana Flume Flow Corrections under Submerged Flow|journal=Journal of Irrigation and Drainage Engineering|volume=138|issue=7|pages=685|doi=10.1061/(ASCE)IR.1943-4774.0000434|year=2012|last1=Willeitner|first1=Ryan P.|last2=Barfuss|first2=Steven L.|last3=Johnson|first3=Michael C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under laboratory conditions the Parshall flume - upon which the Montana is based - can be expected to exhibit accuracies to within +/-2%, although field conditions make accuracies better than 5% doubtful.

== Free-Flow Characteristics==

The Montana Flume is a restriction with free-spilling discharge that accelerates flow from a sub-critical state ([[Froude number|Fr]]~0.5) to a supercritical one ([[Froude number|Fr]]&gt;1).

The free-flow discharge can be summarized as

:&lt;math&gt;Q = C H_a^n&lt;/math&gt;

Where
* ''Q'' is flow rate
* ''C'' is the free-flow coefficient for the flume
* ''H&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the head at the primary point of measurement
* ''n'' varies with flume size (See Table 1 below)

== Free-Flow vs. Submerged Flow==

Free-Flow ‚Äì when there is no ‚Äúback water‚Äù to restrict flow through a flume. Only the single depth (primary point of measurement -Ha) needs to be measured to calculate the flow rate. A free flow also induces a hydraulic jump downstream of the flume.

Submerged Flow ‚Äì when the water surface downstream of the flume is high enough to restrict flow through a flume, the flume is deemed to be submerged.  Lacking the extended throat and discharge sections of the Parshall flume, the Montana flume has little resistance to the effects of submergence and as such it should be avoided.  Where submerged flow is or may become present, there are several methods of correcting the situation:  the flume may be raised above the channel floor, the downstream channel may be modified, or a different [[flume]] type may be used (typically a [[Parshall flume]]).  Although commonly thought of as occurring at higher flow rates, It should be noted that submerged flow can exist at any flow level as it is a function of downstream conditions.  In natural stream applications, submerged flow is frequently the result of vegetative growth on the downstream channel banks, sedimentation, or subsidence of the flume.

== Construction ==

Montana flumes can be constructed from a variety of materials:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/T0848E/t0848e-09.htm |title=Field measurement of soil erosion and runoff - Chapter 4 Streamflow |publisher=Fao.org |accessdate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Fiberglass (wastewater applications due to its corrosion resistance)
* Stainless steel (applications involving high temperatures / corrosive flow streams)
* Galvanized steel (water rights / irrigation)
* Concrete  
* Aluminum (portable applications)
* Wood (temporary flow measurement)
* Plastic (PVC or polycarbonate / Lexan)

Smaller Montana flumes tend to be fabricated from fiberglass and galvanized steel (depending upon the application), while larger Montana flumes can be fabricated from fiberglass (sizes up to 160") or concrete (160"-600").

In practice, is it usual to see Montana flumes larger than 48-inches as the need for free-spilling discharge can not usually be met, downstream scour would be excessive, or other flume types better handle the flow.

== Drawbacks ==

* Montana flumes require free-spilling discharge off the flume (for free-flow conditions).  To accommodate the drop in an existing channel either the flume must be raised above the channel floor (raising the upstream water level) or the downstream channel must be modified.
* As with [[weir]]s, [[flume]]s can also have an effect on local fauna. Some species or certain life stages of the same species may be blocked by flumes due to relatively slow swim speeds or behavioral characteristics.  The elevated nature of the Montana flume exacerbates this problem.
* In earthen channels, upstream bypass may occur and downstream scour will occur unless the channel is armored.and downstream scour may occur. 
* Montana flumes smaller than 3 inches in size should not be used on unscreened sanitary flows, due to the likelihood of clogging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Don't Get Stuck:  Sanitary Flows in Flumes|url=http://openchannelflow.com/blog/dont-get-stuck-sanitary-flows-in-flumes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Montana flume is an empirical device. Interpolation between sizes is not an accurate method of developing intermediate size Montana flumes as the flumes are not scale models of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Measurement Manual, Chapter 8, Section 10|url=http://www.usbr.gov/pmts/hydraulics_lab/pubs/wmm/chap08_10.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parshall Flumes|url=http://openchannelflow.com/flumes/parshall-flumes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Recommended Practice for the Use of Parshall Flumes and Palmer-Bowlus Flumes in Wastewater Treatment Plants|date=November 1984|volume=EPA600/2-84-186|pages=5|url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/5000141O.txt?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&amp;Client=EPA&amp;Index=1981%20Thru%201985&amp;Docs=&amp;Query=&amp;Time=&amp;EndTime=&amp;SearchMethod=1&amp;TocRestrict=n&amp;Toc=&amp;TocEntry=&amp;QField=&amp;QFieldYear=&amp;QFieldMonth=&amp;QFieldDay=&amp;UseQField=&amp;IntQFieldOp=0&amp;ExtQFieldOp=0&amp;XmlQuery=&amp;File=D%3A%5CZYFILES%5CINDEX%20DATA%5C81THRU85%5CTXT%5C00000014%5C5000141O.txt&amp;User=ANONYMOUS&amp;Password=anonymous&amp;SortMethod=h%7C-&amp;MaximumDocuments=1&amp;FuzzyDegree=0&amp;ImageQuality=r75g8/r75g8/x150y150g16/i425&amp;Display=p%7Cf&amp;DefSeekPage=x&amp;SearchBack=ZyActionL&amp;Back=ZyActionS&amp;BackDesc=Results%20page&amp;MaximumPages=1&amp;ZyEntry=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 30-inch [76.2&amp;nbsp;cm] and 42-inch [106.7&amp;nbsp;cm] sizes are examples of intermediate sizes of Montana flumes that have crept into the marketplace without the backing of published research into their sizing and flow rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Non-Standard Parshall Flume Sizes|url=http://openchannelflow.com/blog/non-standard-parshall-flume-sizes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Napakivi''' (pole/navel stone) or '''tonttukivi''' (elf stone) is a traditional [[Finland|Finnish]] name for a standing stone in the middle of a field or another central spot.

Generally speaking napakivi are unhewn stones that people have set upright. Some of them may have been erected by withdrawal of the receding ice-masses after the ice-age, in which case they will not be napakivi proper. Napakivi are usually longish and erect, and frequently have a round head. This has been interpreted by some to perhaps indicate an [[omphalos]]/[[penis|penile]] reference symbolically. Napakivi can be located in the middle of a field, or the heart of an adjacent pile of stones which will be compiled of stones which had to be removed from the field to make it cultivatable by a [[plough]]. It can also be the central stone of a burial mound.

Napakivi may have been considered facilitators of fertility or protectors of domain, or they may have been legal indidcators of ownership. It is plausible they may have been considered some kind of magical centres of force or energy accumulators; perhaps the seat of a tutelary spirits power. The name tonttukivi refers to the elfs known as [[tonttu]] and also to the Finnish language word for a plot of land "tontti". Some stones equivalent to napakivi have been referred to with the term [[Juminkeko]] or '''Jumin kurikka''',  in which case they will have been connected to the mysterious spirit known as [[Jumi]], who served as the basis for the Finnish word for [[god]].

Napakivi may have some cultural connection with [[Sami people|saami]] [[Sei√∞r|seid]]s or central European and great British [[megaliths]], although it has not been demonstrated with any scientific rigour. Megaliths too are erected by ancient folk, giant, usually over man high stones which are sole or in groups. Most megaliths as well are considered to have a connexion to the penis and fertility.

A stone in the center of a graveyard set up at the end of battle to interr the combatants is often called a napakivi, in which case the attendant mythology described above will not be attached to it.

== Description ==
[[Neodymium]] is a metal which is [[ferromagnetic]] (more specifically it shows [[antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetic]] properties), meaning that like [[iron]] it can be [[Magnetization|magnetized]] to become a [[magnet]], but its [[Curie temperature]] (the temperature above which its ferromagnetism disappears) is 19&amp;nbsp;K (‚àí254&amp;nbsp;¬∞C), so in pure form its magnetism only appears at extremely low temperatures.&lt;ref name="Chikazumi"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, compounds of neodymium with [[transition metal]]s such as iron can have Curie temperatures well above room temperature, and these are used to make neodymium magnets.

The strength of neodymium magnets is due to several factors.  The most important is that the [[tetragonal]] Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;B crystal structure has exceptionally high uniaxial [[Magnetic anisotropy|magnetocrystalline anisotropy]] (''H''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; ~7 [[tesla (unit)|T]] ‚Äì
magnetic field strength H in units of ''A/m'' versus [[magnetic moment]] in ''A¬∑m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magnetic Anisotropy|url=http://www.irm.umn.edu/hg2m/hg2m_c/hg2m_c.html|publisher=Hitchhiker's Guide to Magnetism|accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lucas" /&gt;  This means a crystal of the material preferentially magnetizes along a specific [[crystal axis]], but is very difficult to magnetize in other directions.  Like other magnets, the neodymium magnet alloy is composed of [[microcrystalline]] grains which are aligned in a powerful magnetic field during manufacture so their magnetic axes all point in the same direction.  The resistance of the crystal lattice to turning its direction of magnetization gives the compound a very high [[coercivity]], or resistance to being demagnetized.

The neodymium atom also can have a large [[magnetic dipole moment]] because it has 4 [[unpaired electron]]s in its electron structure&lt;ref name="Boysen"&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to (on average) 3 in [[iron]].  In a magnet it is the unpaired electrons, aligned so they spin in the same direction, which generate the magnetic field.  This gives the Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;B compound a high [[Magnetic saturation|saturation magnetization]] (''J''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; ~1.6 [[tesla (unit)|T]] or 16&amp;nbsp;[[Gauss (unit)|kG]]) and a remnant magnetization of typically 1.3 teslas.  Therefore, as the maximum energy density is proportional to ''J''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, this magnetic phase has the potential for storing large amounts of magnetic energy (''BH''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;~ 512&amp;nbsp;kJ/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or 64&amp;nbsp;[[Oersted#Stored energy|MG¬∑Oe]]). This magnetic energy value is about 18 times greater than "ordinary" ferrite magnets by volume, and 12 times by mass.  This magnetic energy property is higher in NdFeB alloys than in [[Samarium-cobalt magnet|samarium cobalt]] (SmCo) magnets, which were the first type of rare-earth magnet to be commercialized. In practice, the magnetic properties of neodymium magnets depend on the alloy composition, microstructure, and manufacturing technique employed.

The Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;B crystal structure can be described as alternating layers of iron atoms and a neodymium-boron compound.&lt;ref name="Lucas" /&gt; The [[diamagnetic]] boron atoms do not contribute directly to the magnetism, but improve cohesion by strong covalent bonding.&lt;ref name="Lucas" /&gt;  The relatively low rare earth content (12% by volume) and the relative abundance of neodymium and iron compared with [[samarium]] and [[cobalt]] makes neodymium magnets lower in price than [[samarium-cobalt magnet]]s.&lt;ref name="Lucas" /&gt;

==History==
[[General Motors]] (GM) and [[Sumitomo Metal Industries|Sumitomo Special Metals]] independently discovered the Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;B compound almost simultaneously in 1984.&lt;ref name="Lucas" /&gt;  The research was initially driven by the high raw materials cost of [[Samarium‚Äìcobalt magnet|SmCo]] permanent magnets, which had been developed earlier. GM focused on the development of [[Melt spinning|melt-spun]] nanocrystalline Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;B magnets, while Sumitomo developed full-density [[Sintering|sintered]] Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;B magnets.

GM commercialized its inventions of [[isotropic]] Neo powder, bonded Neo magnets, and the related production processes by founding Magnequench in 1986 (Magnequench has since become part of Neo Materials Technology, Inc., which later merged into [[Molycorp]]). The company supplied melt-spun Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;B powder to bonded magnet manufacturers.

The [[Sumitomo Group|Sumitomo]] facility became part of the [[Hitachi Ltd.|Hitachi Corporation]], and currently manufactures and licenses other companies to produce sintered Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;B magnets. Hitachi holds more than 600 patents covering neodymium magnets.&lt;!--p56--&gt;&lt;ref name=doeRem&gt;[[Steven Chu|Chu, Steven]].

Chinese manufacturers have become a dominant force in neodymium magnet production, based on their control of much of the world's sources of rare earth mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The [[United States Department of Energy]] has identified a need to find substitutes for rare earth metals in permanent magnet technology, and has begun funding such research. The [[Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy]] has sponsored a Rare Earth Alternatives in Critical Technologies (REACT) program, to develop alternative materials. In 2011, ARPA-E awarded 31.6 million dollars to fund Rare-Earth Substitute projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Research Funding for Rare Earth Free Permanent Magnets |url=http://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=arpa-e-programs/react |date= |website= |publisher= ARPA-E |accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
There are two principal neodymium magnet manufacturing methods:
* Classical powder metallurgy or sintered magnet process&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manufacturing Process of Sintered Neodymium Magnets|url=https://www.rareearth-magnets.net/manufacturing-process-of-sintered-neodymium-magnets.html|publisher=American Applied Materials Corporation|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526052106/https://www.rareearth-magnets.net/manufacturing-process-of-sintered-neodymium-magnets.html|archivedate=2015-05-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rapid solidification or bonded magnet process

Sintered Nd-magnets are prepared by the raw materials being melted in a furnace, cast into a mold and cooled to form ingots. The ingots are pulverized and milled; the powder is then sintered into dense blocks. The blocks are then heat-treated, cut to shape, surface treated and magnetized.

In 2015, [[Nitto Denko]] Corporation of Japan announced their development of a new method of sintering neodymium magnet material. The method exploits an "organic/inorganic hybrid technology" to form a clay-like mixture that can be fashioned into various shapes for sintering.  Most importantly, it is said to be possible to control a non-uniform orientation of the magnetic field in the sintered material to locally concentrate the field to, e.g., improve the performance of electric motors. Mass production is planned for 2017.&lt;ref name=Nitto&gt;{{cite web| title=World's First Magnetic Field Orientation Controlling Neodymium Magnet| url=https://www.nitto.com/jp/en/press/2015/0824.jsp| publisher=[[Nitto Denko]] Corporation| date=24 August 2015| accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AsahiNitto&gt;{{cite news| title=Potent magnet that can be molded like clay developed| url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/business/AJ201509280001| publisher=[[Asahi Shimbun]]| date=28 August 2015| accessdate=28 September 2015| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928182519/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/business/AJ201509280001| archivedate=28 September 2015| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, 50,000 [[Short ton|tons]] of neodymium magnets are produced officially each year in China, and 80,000 tons in a "company-by-company" build-up done in 2013.&lt;ref name="Benecki"&gt;{{cite web| title = The Permanent Magnet Market ‚Äì 2015| website = Magnetics 2013 Conference| publisher = Magnetics 2013 Conference| date = February 7, 2013| url = http://www.waltbenecki.com/uploads/Magnetics_2013_Benecki_Presentation.pdf| format = PDF|accessdate = November 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; China produces more than 95%&lt;!--p9--&gt; of rare earth elements, and produces about 76% of the world's total rare-earth magnets&lt;!--p68--&gt;.&lt;ref name=doeRem/&gt;

Bonded Nd-magnets are prepared by [[melt spinning]] a thin ribbon of the NdFeB alloy. The ribbon contains randomly oriented Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;B nano-scale grains. This ribbon is then pulverized into particles, mixed with a [[polymer]], and either [[compression molding|compression]]- or [[injection molding|injection-molded]] into bonded magnets. Bonded magnets offer less flux intensity than [[sintering|sintered]] magnets, but can be net-shape formed into intricately shaped parts, as is typical with [[Halbach array]]s or arcs, trapezoids and other shapes and assemblies (e.g. Pot Magnets, Separator Grids, etc.).&lt;ref name="NdFeB-Info"&gt;{{cite web

===Grades===
Neodymium magnets are graded according to their [[Oersted|maximum energy product]], which relates to the [[magnetic flux]] output per unit volume. Higher values indicate stronger magnets and range from N35 up to N52. Letters following the grade indicate maximum operating temperatures (often the [[Curie temperature]]), which range from M (up to 100&amp;nbsp;¬∞C) to EH (200&amp;nbsp;¬∞C).&lt;ref name="MagnetGradeChart"&gt;{{cite web  | title = Magnet Grade Chart|publisher = Amazing Magnets, LLC|url = http://www.amazingmagnets.com/magnetgrades.aspx|accessdate = December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetic properties===
Some important properties used to compare permanent magnets are:
;[[Remanence]] (B&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;): which measures the strength of the magnetic field
;[[Coercivity]] (''H''&lt;sub&gt;ci&lt;/sub&gt;): the material's resistance to becoming demagnetized
;Energy product (''BH''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;): the density of magnetic energy
;[[Curie temperature]] (''T''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;): the temperature at which the material loses its magnetism

Neodymium magnets have higher remanence, much higher coercivity and energy product, but often lower Curie temperature than other types. Special neodymium magnet alloys that include [[terbium]] and [[dysprosium]] have been developed that have higher Curie temperature, allowing them to tolerate higher temperatures.&lt;ref name=reu&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE57U02B20090831 As hybrid cars gobble rare metals, shortage looms], Reuters, August 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The table below compares the magnetic performance of neodymium magnets with other types of permanent magnets.

==Corrosion problems==
[[File:NdFeB corrosion.jpg|thumb|These neodymium magnets corroded severely after 5 months of weather exposure]]
Sintered Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;B tends to be vulnerable to [[corrosion]], especially along [[grain boundary|grain boundaries]] of a sintered magnet. This type of corrosion can cause serious deterioration, including crumbling of a magnet into a powder of small magnetic particles, or [[spalling]] of a surface layer.

This vulnerability is addressed in many commercial products by adding a protective coating to prevent exposure to the atmosphere. Nickel plating or two-layered copper-nickel plating are the standard methods, although plating with other metals, or polymer and lacquer protective coatings are also in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | volume = 20 | issue = 1‚Äì2 | year = 2007 | title = Corrosion of Nd-Fe-B permanent magnets | first1 = M. | last1 = Drak | first2 = L.A. | last2 = Dobrzanski | journal = Journal of Achievements in Materials and Manufacturing Engineering | url = http://www.journalamme.org/papers_vol20/1369S.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120402134024/http://www.journalamme.org/papers_vol20/1369S.pdf | archivedate = 2012-04-02 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hazards ==
The greater forces exerted by [[rare-earth magnet]]s create hazards that may not occur with other types of magnet. Neodymium magnets larger than a few cubic centimeters are strong enough to cause injuries to body parts pinched between two magnets, or a magnet and a ferrous metal surface, even causing broken bones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/03/06/how-to-remove-a-finger-with-tw/|title=How to remove a finger with two super magnets|last=Swain|first=Frank|date=March 29, 2018|website=The Sciencepunk Blog|publisher=Seed Media Group LLC|accessdate=2009-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnets that get too near each other can strike each other with enough force to chip and shatter the brittle material, and the flying chips can cause various injuries, especially [[Eye injury|eye injuries]]. There have even been cases where young children who have swallowed several magnets have had sections of the [[Gastrointestinal tract|digestive tract]] pinched between two magnets, causing injury or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = CPSC Safety Alert: Ingested Magnets Can Cause Serious Intestinal Injuries|url = http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/pubs/5221.pdf|publisher = U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission|accessdate = 13 December 2012|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130108004337/http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/pubs/5221.pdf|archivedate = 8 January 2013|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stronger magnetic fields can be hazardous to mechanical and electronic devices, as they can erase magnetic media such as [[floppy disk]]s and [[credit card]]s, and magnetize watches and the [[shadow mask]]s of [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] type monitors at a greater distance than other types of magnet.

===New applications===
[[File:NeoCube.jpg|thumb|Neodymium magnet spheres assembled in the shape of a cube]]
In addition, the greater strength of neodymium magnets has inspired new applications in areas where magnets were not used before, such as magnetic jewelry clasps, children's magnetic building sets (and other [[neodymium magnet toys]]) and as part of the closing mechanism of modern sport parachute equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unitedparachutetechnologies.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=22 |title=Options Guide |publisher=United Parachute Technologies |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717163453/http://www.unitedparachutetechnologies.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=22 |archive-date=July 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also are the main metal in the formerly popular desk-toy magnets, "Buckyballs" and "Buckycubes", though some US retailers have chosen not to sell them due to child-safety concerns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Donnell |first=Jayne |date=July 26, 2012 |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/industries/retail/story/2012-07-25/buckyballs-ban/56481316/1 |title=Feds file suit against Buckyballs, retailers ban product |work=[[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they have been banned in Canada for the same reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/health-headlines/health-canada-to-ban-the-sale-of-buckyballs-magnets-1.1240045|title=Health Canada to ban the sale of 'Buckyballs' magnets|date=2013-04-16 |work=CTVNews|access-date=2018-08-22|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; You can still buy neodymium magnets in Canada just not as toys.

The strength and magnetic field homogeneity on neodymium magnets has also opened new applications in the medical field with the introduction of open [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) scanners used to image the body in radiology departments as an alternative to superconducting magnets that use a coil of superconducting wire to produce the magnetic field.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

As intercity driving is rare in China, electric cars provide several practical advantages because commutes are fairly short and at low speeds due to traffic congestion. These particular local conditions make the range limitation of all-electric cars less of a problem, especially as the latest Chinese models have a top speed of {{convert|100|km/h|-1|abbr=on}} and a range of {{convert|200|km|abbr=on}} between charges.&lt;ref name=NYTChina/&gt; As of May 2010, Chinese automakers have developed at least 10 models of high-speed, all-electric cars with plans for volume production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chinaautoweb.com/2010/05/10-electric-cars-to-be-released-this-year/ |title=10 Electric Models To Be Released This Year? |publisher=ChinaAutoWeb.com |date=2010-05-14 |accessdate=2010-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of its commitment to promote electric vehicles, the Chinese government announced plans in September 2015 to build a nationwide [[charging infrastructure|charging-station network]] to fulfil the power demand of 5 million electric vehicles by 2020. This network will cover residential areas, [[business district]]s, public space and inter-city highways, according to a guideline released by the State Council. Also, the plan mandates that new residential complexes should build charging points or assign space for them, while public parking lots should have no less than 10% of parking spaces with charging facilities. According to the guideline, there should be at least one public charging station for every 2,000 NEVs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-10/09/c_134696278.htm|title=China to build chargers to power 5 mln electric cars by 2020|author=Xinhua|work=[[Xinhua News Agency]]|date=2015-10-09|accessdate=2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also the State Council ordered local governments not to restrict the sales or use of new energy cars.&lt;ref name=ChinaDily112015&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/motoring/2015-11/09/content_22405520.htm|title=Central govt gives a jolt to new-energy auto industry|author=Li Fusheng|work=[[China Daily]]|date=2015-11-09|accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016 the Traffic Management Bureau under the [[Ministry of Public Security (China)|Ministry of Public Security]] announced the introduction of new green license plates to identify new energy vehicles, as opposed to the country's standard blue plates. The NEV plates include a Chinese character short for the provincial region where they are issued, and seven numbers and letters, compared to six on standard plates. The objective of the special plates is to facilitate police enforcement of the preferential policies that some local authorities apply to cleaner cars to help cut emissions and ease traffic. For example, [[Road space rationing in Beijing|central Beijing]] has in place a [[road space rationing]] scheme, a driving restriction regulation that bans conventional vehicles from entering the city for one day a week, but new energy vehicles are exempted from the restriction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2016-04/18/content_24643530.htm | title=New license plates to differentiate new energy vehicles | work=[[Xinhua]] | date=2016-04-18 | accessdate=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beijing also introduced a vehicle quota system in 2011, awarding new car licenses through a lottery, with a ceiling of 6 million units for 2017.

===Low-speed vehicles and other modes===

;Low-speed electric vehicles
Sales of [[neighborhood electric vehicle|low-speed electric vehicles]] (LSEVs) have experienced considerable growth in China between 2012 and 2016 due to their affordability and flexibility because they can be driven without a driver license. Most of these low-speed electric cars are used in small cities, but they are expanding to larger cities.&lt;ref name=Outlook2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Outlook2017/&gt; These small vehicles are not accounted by the government as new energy vehicles due to safety and environmental concerns.&lt;ref name=China2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/motoring/2014-01/11/content_17229981.htm|title=New-energy vehicles 'turning the corner'|author= Jiang Xueqing|publisher=China Daily|date=2014-01-11|accessdate=2014-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; LSEVs generally have a maximum speed of between {{convert|40|to|70|km/h|abbr=on}}, have short ranges and, in some cases, use [[lead-acid battery|lead-acid batteries]] and basic motor technology.&lt;ref name=Outlook2017/&gt;

[[File:Parking Electric Scooters Chengdu.jpg|thumb|[[Electric motorcycles and scooters|Electric scooters]] in [[Chengdu]].]]

The lack of regulations for LSEV manufacturers has led to poor safety performance. Traffic safety is also at stake. LSEVs struggle in large cities due to their poor acceleration and low top speeds.  LSEVs could jeopardise the market for electric cars, one of China‚Äôs priorities for industrial policy development. For these reasons, legislation to regulate and standardize low-speed electric vehicles began to be discussed by the Chinese government in 2016, including  battery types (lead-acid versus lithium-ion batteries) and mandatory safety tests and vehicle dimensions.&lt;ref name=Outlook2017/&gt;

;Two-wheelers and three-wheelers
China continued to dominate both new registrations and the global stock of [[Electric motorcycles and scooters|electric two-wheelers]] in 2016, with about 26 million units sold. The stock of electric two-wheelers is estimated in the 200-230 million range by the end of 2016, making China the global leader in this segment.&lt;ref name=Outlook2017/&gt;

The high growth rate in electric two-wheelers is partially due to the country‚Äôs policies to limit air pollution hazards, such as its ban on gasoline-powered motorcycles, limits on the issuing of licences, and the division of lanes. In addition, two-wheelers have reached cost parity with [[internal combustion engine]] models, making them affordable and attractive to consumers.&lt;ref name=Outlook2017/&gt;

==Plot==
===Season One===
In the near future, Middle East turmoil compromises oil production. The [[United States]] achieves energy independence and subsequently withdraws from [[NATO]], causing an energy crisis. A catastrophic hurricane fueled by [[climate change]], Hurricane Maria, devastates Norway, killing thousands. The resulting chaos leads to the unprecedented rise of the [[Green Party (Norway)|Norwegian Green Party]] to power in response. The new [[Prime Minister of Norway]], Green Party leader Jesper Berg, is an idealistic politician with bold plans for [[thorium-based nuclear power]] as a viable solution to replace oil, which could help avoid further emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere causing global warming and climate change. To this end, he cuts off all fossil fuel production, intensifying the energy crisis in the continent. The [[European Union]], in desperation, acquiesces to a Russia velvet glove [[invasion]] of Norway. 

At the inauguration of a thorium plant, [[Special Forces of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces|Russian special forces]] kidnap Berg in front of his [[Norwegian Police Security Service|Norwegian Police Security Service (PST)]] bodyguard Hans Martin Djupvik and newspaper reporter Thomas Eriksen, and is flown by helicopter to a forest. There, via video chat, [[President of the European Commission|EU Commissioner]] Pierre Anselme demands that he submit to the demands of the EU or face a full-scale Russian invasion. Berg at first refuses, but after his kidnappers execute a random civilian who approached the helicopter, Berg submits, reasoning as a pacifist that nobody deserves to die. Berg is released and is picked up by Djupvik. To conceal the nature of the [[military occupation|occupation]], Berg spins the occupation as an "energy partnership", and promises the Norwegian people in an interview with Eriksen that the occupation would be a temporary measure until Norway's [[Energy in Norway|oil and gas production]] is restored by Russian working crews. This intention unravels as a series of events complicates Norwegian‚ÄìRussian interactions over the ensuing months.

The series of escalating complications begins when Stefan Christensen, a member of the [[Hans Majestet Kongens Garde|Royal Guard]], unsuccessfully attempts to assassinate the Russian ambassador, Irina Sidorova, only to be thwarted by Djupvik and the PST. The Norwegian military unit seizes two Russian officials who had been urging the Commander of the Royal Guard, Harald Vold, to surrender himself to the Russian authorities on suspicion of hatching the plot to assassinate Sidorova, inciting a hostage situation with the demands being the release of the attempted assassin from the [[Embassy of Russia in Oslo|Russian embassy]], located just across the street from a restaurant frequented by Russians since the occupation began, run by Eriksen's wife Bente Norum. Peter Eriksen, Eriksen's son and Norum's stepson, joins protests against the Russians, and soon becomes involved with anti-Russian radicals.

When a Russian agent is the victim of a hit-and-run in front of the embassy and restaurant, the Russian government demands that Norway extrajudicially extradite the driver, a suspected [[Chechens|Chechen]] terrorist named Elbek Musajev. The hit-and-run was an accident caused by his son Iljas rather than a deliberate attack, but Elbek commits suicide to avoid being deported to Russia. An insurgent group, Free Norway (''{{lang|nb|Fritt Norge}}''), emerges, led by Christensen, Vold, nationalist academic Eivind Birkeland and Iljas Musajev, and attacks police headquarters, injuring a teenager who had been detained for posting anti-Russian messages inciting opposition to the occupation. The Russian government takes this as an excuse to prolong their occupation of Norway. A gas production facility is attacked, temporarily delaying the EU production target, and killing many Russian workers, further delaying the pullout. Tensions further increase as suspicious events occur at the [[Norway‚ÄìRussia border|Norwegian‚ÄìRussian border]], where Russian troops infiltrate [[Finnmark|Lapland (Finnmark County)]], Eriksen is murdered while investigating the Russians, and a [[Russian Navy|Russian naval]] fleet exercises off the coast of [[northern Norway]]. Berg asks the EU to protect Norway's sovereignty, but the EU fails to act decisively.

Free Norway receives assistance from inside the PST by its chief Wenche Arnesen, who chose to defect after discovering that she was terminally ill. The group begins a recruitment drive of retired military personnel and prisoners. Berg has in the meantime set up an [[interim government]] under the orders of the [[King of Norway]] after losing a [[no-confidence motion]] by the Green Party, and had known Russian sleeper agents sent to internment on [[Svalbard]]; however, it is pursued by Russian jets, forcing it to turn back. In light of this internment campaign, Russian "terrorists" seemingly armed with [[explosive belt|suicide vests]] storm Berg's office and hold him hostage. Berg is rescued and evacuated to the residence of the U.S. ambassador, setting up a government in internal exile. It emerges that the oil refinery attack was actually a [[false flag|false-flag]] attack staged by the Russians. When Norum's daughter, Maja Norum, discovers that the Russians killed Eriksen, Norum expels Russian staff members from her restaurant, and provides information to Free Norway.

Berg, hiding in the U.S. ambassador's residence, takes every opportunity to attempt engaging the United States in a series of Norwegian moves to try to dislodge the Russians, but the U.S. refuses direct involvement in any conflict they have a risk of losing. Events spiral further when after calling the public to resist the Russians, Free Norway kidnaps Sidorova and one of her bodyguards, executing the latter live over the internet; in response, Russian special forces seize [[Oslo Airport, Gardermoen|Oslo Airport]].  Berg's pressure on the U.S. prompts the ambassador to poison his food and Berg is admitted to a hospital where he is captured yet again, this time by Free Norway, who also assassinate a high-ranking Russian general along with several Russian soldiers in front of the Russian embassy, using Norum's information (incurring a rebuke from her lover, a Russian agent named Nikolai). After being rescued, Sidorova calls Djupvik and tells him that Russia is now at war with Norway. Arnesen records and releases a video revealing her defection. She later commits suicide at a church to avoid capture, and its priest cremates her body. Berg is taken to a Free Norway resistance camp, and is asked by Vold if he is ready to fight for his country.

===Season Two===
After being kidnapped, Berg is proclaimed as the new leader of Free Norway, and the group carries out a [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla campaign]] against the occupation, attacking both Russian and Norwegian forces and staging terror attacks throughout the country, nearly plummeting the country into a civil war. Six months later, however, the insurgents have lost much of their strength due to Russian military and Norwegian police action. Berg is thus sent into exile in neighboring [[Sweden]], which had supported the initial Russian invasion as a member of the EU.

Berg's replacement as prime minister, fellow Green Party member Anders Knudsen, proves unable to handle the pressure and resigns. Following his exile to Sweden, Berg attempts to form a parallel [[Government in exile|government-in-exile]]. While acting as a go-between Berg and the leaders of [[Storting|Parliament]], his political adviser and lover Anita Rygh sees her political role marginalized. Rygh instead recommends to the majority party that they form a new government. The president refuses, but offers her the prime ministerial position. She accepts, severing her ties with Berg.

A [[Norwegian Coast Guard]] officer approaches Berg with news that the Russians are installing [[cruise missile]] launchers on the oil installation of [[Melk√∏ya]] in northern Norway. From his position in Sweden, Berg contacts the insurgents and orders them to get photographic evidence. A platoon of guardsmen independently confronts members of a Russian [[private military company]] stationed there under the guise of an inspection. One of the guardsmen, a naturalized [[Somalis|Somalian]] immigrant named Faisal Abdi, transmits a video of the missiles, but a gunfight breaks out and the guardsmen are captured and brought to a Russian prison. The leader of the expedition dies after being hit by gunfire. The return of the soldiers becomes a source of tension between the nations and Rygh's first true test.

Djupvik, now head of the PST, continues to walk a line between allegiances. Unable to track down Arnesen, his old boss and reported leader of Free Norway, he strong-arms the priest at the church where she died into admitting she has been dead the whole time. The Norwegian police capture Vold in an operation. The Security Service discovers Berg is using a video game to communicate with the rebels, and when they find proof that he ordered the illegal mission to Melk√∏ya, he is ordered to be arrested. Tipped off, Berg flees in the night, and emerges in [[Poland]], where he meets a reporter from Germany's [[Stern (magazine)|''Stern'' magazine]] and leaks government documents, before fleeing to [[Belgium]] and then [[France]], where he is arrested. He pursues a case in the [[European Court of Human Rights]], demanding the [[Right of return|right to return]] to Norway, which he succeeds in doing.

As the Russians are unwilling to free the guardsmen captured, Djupvik's wife Hilde, drafts a plan to have them tried in Norway but with a Russian [[lay judge]] presiding over the trial. The Russians agree and all of the soldiers are found guilty. A group of civilian government opponents, Free Our Soldiers (FOS), is created by Faisal's girlfriend, Frida Eng√∏, and her hacker friend Leon Tangen to peacefully force the government to pardon them. Christensen, one of the leaders of Free Norway who had incited the crisis with his attack on Ambassador Sidorova, becomes a straggler, kidnaps Djupvik's daughter and demands the soldiers be set free, prompting condemnation from FOS. Christensen is tracked down by the Russians and Djupvik's daughter is saved. The Russians allow him a chance to talk to Christensen. When Christensen says he regrets not killing the child, he is killed by Djupvik.

Rygh offers the rebels amnesty in return of their turning in their weapons, which is endorsed by Vold and the Russians. The government then releases the guardsmen. Vold then forms a new political party to succeed Free Norway, the Liberation Party. Rygh's mother, once an ardent supporter of her daughter, becomes despondent at how much Norway has lost. Meanwhile, EU Commissioner Anselme is succeeded by a Polish politician who is more sympathetic to Berg and his cause.

Throughout the season, Bente Norum has opened a hotel with a Russian business partner named Zoya. Similar to her previous restaurant, this venue proves to be a real hit among Russians and it is a profitable venture. A powerful Russian, Konstantin Minnikov, stays at the hotel.  Norum is approached by a Free Norway agent, Anette Kleven, to use a device to mirror Minnikov's phone. She declines, until she discovers that Minnikov is secretly buying out her partner. Minnikov's daughter Nadia replaces Zoya as Norum's business partner, and befriends Norum's daughter Maja. Minnikov finds out Norum has been spying on her, and he confronts her. She accidentally kills him during the confrontation. Afraid, she calls Nikolai who disposes of Minnikov's body. The rebels use this to blackmail her to spy on other Russians who are guests at her hotel. She keeps this a secret, and Zoya is blamed for the murder. When Norum discovers this, she goes to the police to turn herself in, only to find out that resistance fighters won‚Äôt let her confess. She meets Djupvik, and gives him information on the activities of the rebels.

After being cleared, Berg returns to Norway with a group of European politicians to support him and serve as protection. However, the European politicians are forced to leave after the Norwegian government threatens gas supplies to Europe. In response, Berg recruits Tangen to hack a Russian missile system and shoot down a [[Finnish Air Force|Finnish]] fighter jet in a false-flag attack, causing the EU to rebuke Russia. Tangen is killed by a Russian hit squad in retaliation for his role, but is able to pass proof of Berg's involvement to Eng√∏ beforehand. When Rygh orders the [[Royal Norwegian Navy|Norwegian Navy]] to detain Berg, they refuse, igniting a military coup led by Vold. Djupvik's wife leaves him over his involvement with the Russians, and Norum sells her hotel to Nadia, allowing her and Maja to leave Norway and immigrate to Russia. 

To contain the situation, Rygh and Djupvik spin the coup as a restoration of order (which marginalizes Vold), and decide to accompany Berg to Norwegian shores, where he is met by an adoring crowd. Berg proclaims Rygh as his official successor, and she announces the end of the Russian occupation. However, she is shot by Abdi, who had become radicalized by Tangen's death (egged on by Vold, who watched from the sidelines). Later that night, Berg returns to the office of the prime minister and sits in the prime minister's seat, facing an uncertain future.

==Reception==

A '''piezoelectric accelerometer''' is an [[accelerometer]] that employs the [[piezoelectric effect]] of certain materials to measure dynamic changes in mechanical variables (e.g., acceleration, vibration, and mechanical shock).

As with all [[transducer]]s, piezoelectric convert one form of energy into another and provide an electrical signal in response to a quantity, property, or condition that is being measured.  Using the general sensing method upon which all accelerometers are based, acceleration acts upon a [[seismic mass]] that is restrained by a spring or suspended on a cantilever beam, and converts a physical force into an electrical signal.  Before the acceleration can be converted into an electrical quantity it must first be converted into either a [[force]] or [[displacement (vector)|displacement]].  This conversion is done via the mass spring system shown in the figure to the right.

==Introduction==
[[File:PiezoAccel.jpg|thumb|The cross-section of a piezoelectric accelerometer.]]
The word piezoelectric finds its roots in the Greek word ''piezein'', which means to squeeze or press.  When a physical force is exerted on the accelerometer, the seismic mass loads the piezoelectric element according to [[Newtons second law|Newton's second law]] of motion (&lt;math&gt;F=ma&lt;/math&gt;).  The force exerted on the piezoelectric material can be observed in the change in the electrostatic force or voltage generated by the piezoelectric material.  This differs from a [[piezoresistive]] effect in that piezoresistive materials experience a change in the resistance of the material rather than a change in charge or voltage.  Physical force exerted on the piezoelectric can be classified as one of two types; bending or compression.  Stress of the compression type can be understood as a force exerted to one side of the piezoelectric while the opposing side rests against a fixed surface, while bending involves a force being exerted on the piezoelectric from both sides. 

Piezoelectric materials used for the purpose of accelerometers fall into two categories: single crystal and ceramic materials.   The first and more widely used are single-crystal materials (usually quartz).  Though these materials do offer a long life span in terms of sensitivity, their disadvantage is that they are generally less sensitive than some piezoelectric ceramics. The other category, ceramic materials, have a higher piezoelectric constant (sensitivity) than single-crystal materials, and are less expensive to produce. Ceramics use [[barium titanate]], lead-zirconate-lead-titanate, [[lead metaniobate]], and other materials whose composition is considered proprietary by the company responsible for their development.  The disadvantage of piezoelectric ceramics, however, is that their sensitivity degrades with time making the longevity of the device less than that of single-crystal materials.

In applications when low sensitivity piezoelectrics are used, two or more crystals can be connected together for output multiplication.  The proper material can be chosen for particular applications based on the [[sensitivity (electronics)|sensitivity]], [[frequency response]], bulk-resistivity, and thermal response.  Due to the low output signal and high [[output impedance]] that piezoelectric accelerometers possess, there is a need for amplification and impedance conversion of the signal produced.  In the past this problem has been solved using a separate (external) [[amplifier]]/[[Electrical impedance|impedance]] converter.  This method, however, is generally impractical due to the [[noise]] that is introduced as well as the physical and environmental constraints posed on the system as a result.  Today [[Integrated circuit|IC]] amplifiers/impedance converters are commercially available and are generally packaged within the case of the accelerometer itself.

==History==
Behind the mystery of the operation of the piezoelectric accelerometer lie some very fundamental concepts governing the behavior of crystallographic structures. In 1880, [[Pierre Curie|Pierre]] and [[Jacques Curie]] published an experimental demonstration connecting mechanical stress and surface charge on a crystal. This phenomenon became known as the [[Piezoelectricity|piezoelectric effect]]. Closely related to this phenomenon is the [[Curie point]], named for the physicist Pierre Curie, which is the temperature above which piezoelectric material loses spontaneous polarization of its atoms.

The development of the commercial piezoelectric accelerometer came about through a number of attempts to find the most effective method to measure the vibration on large structures such as bridges and on vehicles in motion such as aircraft. One attempt involved using the resistance strain gage as a device to build an accelerometer. Incidentally, it was Hans J. Meier who, through his work at MIT, is given credit as the first to construct a commercial [[strain gage]] accelerometer (circa 1938).&lt;ref name="history"&gt;Patrick, Walter L. ''The History of the Accelerometer 1920's-1996 Prologue and Epilogue''. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the strain gage accelerometers were fragile and could only produce low resonant frequencies and they also exhibited a low frequency response. These limitations in [[dynamic range]] made it unsuitable for testing naval aircraft structures. On the other hand, the [[piezoelectric sensor]] was proven to be a much better choice over the strain gage in designing an accelerometer. The high [[modulus of elasticity]] of piezoelectric materials makes the piezoelectric sensor a more viable solution to the problems identified with the strain gage accelerometer.

Simply stated, the inherent properties of the piezoelectric accelerometers made it a much better alternative to the strain gage types because of its high frequency response, and its ability to generate high resonant frequencies. The piezoelectric accelerometer allowed for a reduction in its physical size at the manufacturing level and it also provided for a higher [[Standard gravity|g]] (standard gravity) capability relative to the strain gage type. By comparison, the strain gage type exhibited a flat frequency response above 200&amp;nbsp;Hz while the piezoelectric type provided a flat response up to 10,000&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; These improvements made it possible for measuring the high frequency vibrations associated with the quick movements and short duration shocks of aircraft which before was not possible with the strain gage types. Before long, the technological benefits of the piezoelectric accelerometer became apparent and in the late 1940s, large scale production of piezoelectric accelerometers began. Today, piezoelectric accelerometers are used for instrumentation in the fields of engineering, health and medicine, aeronautics and many other different industries.

==Manufacturing==
There are two common methods used to manufacture accelerometers. One is based upon the principles of piezoresistance and the other is based on the principles of piezoelectricity. Both methods ensure that unwanted orthogonal acceleration vectors are excluded from detection.

Manufacturing an accelerometer that uses piezoresistance first starts with a semiconductor layer that is attached to a handle wafer by a thick oxide layer. The semiconductor layer is then patterned to the accelerometer's geometry. This semiconductor layer has one or more apertures so that the underlying mass will have the corresponding apertures. Next the semiconductor layer is used as a mask to etch out a cavity in the underlying thick oxide. A mass in the cavity is supported in cantilever fashion by the piezoresistant arms of the semiconductor layer. Directly below the accelerometer's geometry is a flex cavity that allows the mass in the cavity to flex or move in direction that is orthogonal to the surface of the accelerometer.

Accelerometers based upon piezoelectricity are constructed with two piezoelectric transducers.  The unit consists of a hollow tube that is sealed by a piezoelectric transducer on each end. The transducers are oppositely polarized and are selected to have a specific series capacitance. The tube is then partially filled with a heavy liquid and the accelerometer is excited. While excited the total output voltage is continuously measured and the volume of the heavy liquid is microadjusted until the desired output voltage is obtained. Finally the outputs of the individual transducers are measured, the residual voltage difference is tabulated, and the dominate transducer is identified.

In 1943 the Danish company [[Br√ºel &amp; Kj√¶r]] launched Type 4301 - the world's first charge accelerometer.

==Applications of piezoelectric accelerometers==
Piezoelectric accelerometers are used in many different industries, environments and applications. Piezoelectric measuring devices are widely used today in the laboratory, on the production floor, and as original equipment for measuring and recording dynamic changes in mechanical variables including shock and vibration.

Some accelerometers have built-in electronics to amplify the signal before transmitting it to the recording device. These devices usually comply with the [[IEPE]] standard or its proprietary equivalent, [[Integrated circuit piezoelectric sensor|ICP]] (see [[integrated circuit piezoelectric sensor]]).

The '''RCA Corporation''' was a major American electronics company, which was founded as the '''Radio Corporation of America''' in 1919. It was initially a wholly owned subsidiary of [[General Electric]] (GE); however, in 1932, GE was required to divest its control as part of the settlement of a government antitrust suit.

At its height as an independent company, RCA was the dominant communications firm in the United States for over five decades. Beginning in the early 1920s, RCA was a major manufacturer of [[radio receiver]]s, and also created the first national radio network, the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]] (NBC). RCA was also at the forefront in the  introduction and development of  [[television]], both black-and-white and color. During this period, the company was closely identified with the leadership of [[David Sarnoff]]. He was general manager at RCA's founding, became company president in 1930, and remained active, as chairman of the board, until the end of 1969.

Beginning in the mid 1970s, RCA's stature began to weaken, as the company attempted to diversify and  suffered major financial losses in the mainframe computer industry and other failed projects such as the [[CED videodisc]]. In 1986, RCA was reacquired by General Electric, which over the next few years liquidated most of the corporation's assets. The [[RCA (trademark)|RCA trademarks]] are currently owned by [[Sony Music Entertainment]] and [[Technicolor SA|Technicolor]], which in turn license the brand name to other companies including [[Voxx International]], Curtis International, AVC Multimedia, [[TCL Corporation]], and Express LUCK International, Ltd. for their various products.

==Establishment by General Electric==
[[File:1921 Radio Corporation of America (Worldwide Wireless) logo.jpg|right|325px|thumb|Company logo in 1921 stressed its leadership in international communication.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101051572624;view=1up;seq=538 Radio Corporation of America advertisement,] ''The Wireless Age'', August 1921, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
RCA originated as a reorganization of the [[Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America]] (commonly called "American Marconi"). In 1897, the Wireless Telegraph and Signal Company, Limited, was founded in London to promote the radio (then known as "wireless telegraphy") inventions of [[Guglielmo Marconi]]. As part of a worldwide expansion, in 1899 American Marconi was organized as a subsidiary company, holding the rights to use the Marconi patents in the United States and Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=chi.65453774;view=1up;seq=900 "A Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company for America"], ''Electrical World and Engineer'', December 2, 1899, pages 870‚Äì871.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912 it took over the assets of the bankrupt [[United Wireless Telegraph Company]], and from that point forward it had been the dominant radio communications company in the United States.

With the entry of the United States into World War One in April 1917, the government took over most civilian radio stations, to use them for the war effort. Although the overall U.S. government plan was to restore civilian ownership of the seized radio stations once the war ended, many Navy officials hoped to retain a monopoly on radio communication even after the war. Defying instructions to the contrary, the Navy began purchasing large numbers of stations outright. With the conclusion of the conflict, Congress turned down the Navy's efforts to have peacetime control of the radio industry, and instructed the Navy to make plans to return the commercial stations it controlled, including the ones it had improperly purchased, to the original owners.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112064674325;view=1up;seq=345 "Attempts to Establish a United States Government Radio Monopoly"], ''History of Communications-Electronics in the United States Navy'' by Captain L. S. Howeth, USN (Retired), 1963, pages 313‚Äì318.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to national security considerations, the Navy was particularly concerned about returning the high-powered international stations to American Marconi, since a majority of its stock was in foreign hands, and the British already largely controlled the international undersea cables. This concern was increased by the announcement in late 1918 of the formation of the Pan-American Wireless Telegraph and Telephone Company, a joint venture between American Marconi and the Federal Telegraph Company, with plans to set up service between the United States and South America.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015084536997;view=1up;seq=224 "A New Wireless Chain Between the Americas"] by John V. L. Hogan, ''Popular Science Monthly'', November 1918, pages 140‚Äì143.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RCA Tube Boxes.jpg|thumb|234x234px|Two vacuum tube cartons, displaying different generations of the RCA logo]]
The Navy had installed a high-powered [[Alexanderson alternator]], built by General Electric (GE), at the American Marconi transmitter site in New Brunswick, New Jersey. It proved to be superior for transatlantic transmissions to the spark transmitters that had been traditionally used by the Marconi companies. Marconi officials were so impressed by the capabilities of the Alexanderson alternators that they began making preparations to adopt them as their standard transmitters for international communication. A tentative plan made with General Electric proposed that over a two-year period the Marconi companies would purchase most of GE's alternator production. However, this proposal was met with disapproval, on national security grounds, by the U.S. Navy, which was concerned that this would guarantee British domination of international radio communication.&lt;ref name="formation"&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89074767138;view=1up;seq=191 ''History of Radio to 1926''] by Gleason L. Archer, 1938, pages 159‚Äì167, 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Navy, claiming it was acting with the support of President Wilson, looked for an alternative that would result in an "all-American" company taking over the American Marconi assets. In April 1919 two naval officers, [[William H. G. Bullard|Admiral H. G. Bullard]] and [[Stanford Caldwell Hooper|Commander S. C. Hooper]], met with GE's president, [[Owen D. Young]], asking that he suspend the pending alternator sales to the Marconi companies. This move would leave General Electric without a buyer for its transmitters, so the officers proposed that GE purchase American Marconi, and use the assets to form its own radio communications subsidiary. Young consented to this proposal, which, effective November 20, 1919, transformed American Marconi into the Radio Corporation of America.&lt;ref name="formation" /&gt; The new company was promoted as being a patriotic gesture. RCA's incorporation papers required that its officers needed to be U.S. citizens, with a majority of its stock held by Americans.

RCA retained most of the American Marconi staff, although Owen Young became the new company's head as the chairman of the board. Former American Marconi vice president and general manager E. J. Nally become RCA's first president. Nally's term ended on December 31, 1922, and he was succeeded the next day by [[James Harbord|Major General James G. Harbord]]. Harbord in turn resigned the presidency on January 3, 1930, replacing Owen D. Young as the company's chairman of the board. He was succeeded, as RCA's third president, by David Sarnoff, who had been the company's general manager at its founding. RCA worked closely with the federal government, and felt it deserved to maintain its predominant role in U.S. radio communications. At the company's recommendation, President Woodrow Wilson appointed Rear Admiral Bullard "to attend the stockholders' and director's meetings... in order that he may present and discuss informally the Government's views and interests".&lt;ref&gt;Archer (1938), [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89074767138;view=1up;seq=223 pages 187‚Äì188]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of its founding RCA was the largest radio communications firm in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=May 1922|title=The March Of Events: America in Control Of Its Wireless|journal=The World's Work|volume=XLIV|pages=11‚Äì13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZW0AAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA11|accessdate=1 June 2017|author1=Page |first1=Walter Hines|last2=Page|first2=Arthur W}}&lt;/ref&gt; American Marconi had been falling behind industry advances, particularly in vacuum tube technology, and GE needed access to additional patents before its new subsidiary could be fully competitive. The result was a series of negotiations and a complicated set of cross-licensing agreements between various companies. On July 1, 1920, an agreement was made with the [[AT&amp;T Corporation|American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company]] (AT&amp;T), which purchased 500,000 shares of RCA, although it would divest these shares in early 1923. The [[United Fruit Company]] held a small portfolio of radio patents, and signed two agreements in 1921. GE's traditional electric company rival, the [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Corporation]], had also purchased rights to some critical patents, including one for heterodyne receiving originally issued to [[Reginald Fessenden]], plus [[regenerative circuit]] and [[superheterodyne receiver]] patents issued to [[Edwin Armstrong]]. Westinghouse used this position to negotiate a cross-licensing agreement, effective July 1, 1921, that included a concession that 40% of RCA's equipment purchases would be from Westinghouse. Following these transactions, GE owned 30.1% of RCA's stock, Westinghouse 20.6%, AT&amp;T 10.3%, and United Fruit 4.1%, with the remaining 34.9% owned by individual shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;''The Continuous Wave'' by Hugh G. J. Aitken, 1985, pages 445‚Äì447, 454‚Äì469, 477‚Äì481.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, RCA agreed to occupy the yet-to-be-constructed landmark building of the [[Rockefeller Center]] complex, [[GE Building|30 Rockefeller Plaza]], which in 1933 became known as the RCA building (later renamed the GE Building, now the Comcast Building). This lease was critical for enabling the massive project to proceed as a commercially viable venture‚ÄîDavid Rockefeller cited RCA's action as being responsible for "the salvation of the project".&lt;ref&gt;"Rescuing the Project" section of ''Memoirs'' by David Rockefeller, New York: Random House, 2002, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

RCA's primary business objectives at its founding were to provide equipment and services for seagoing vessels, and "worldwide wireless" communication in competition with the undersea cables. To provide the international service, the company soon undertook a massive project to build a "Radio Central" communications hub at Rocky Point, Long Island, New York, designed to achieve "the realization of the vision of communication engineers to transmit messages to all points of the world from a single centrally located source". The circular Radio Central site encompassed 10 square miles (25 square kilometers), with a transmission building, located at the hub, projected to ultimately house ten Alexanderson alternator transmitters. The plan called for 12 "antenna spokes" to be built, stretching out in all directions from the center. Each spoke was nearly three miles (4.8 kilometers) long, and consisted of sixteen wires supported by a line of six 410-foot-tall (125 meter) towers topped with 150-foot-wide (45 meter) crossbars. Construction began in July 1920, and the site was dedicated on November 5, 1921, after two of the antenna spokes had been completed, and two of the 200-kilowatt alternators installed. The debut transmissions received replies from stations in 17 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101051572632;view=1up;seq=72 "The Opening of Radio Central"], ''The Wireless Age'', December 1921, pages 18‚Äì22, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the initial installation would remain in operation, the additional antenna spokes and alternator installations would not be completed, due to a major discovery about radio signal propagation. While investigating transmitter "harmonics" ‚Äì unwanted additional radio signals produced at higher frequencies than a station's normal transmission frequency ‚Äì Westinghouse's [[Frank Conrad]] unexpectedly found that in some cases the harmonics could be heard farther than the primary signal, something previously thought impossible, as high-frequency [[shortwave]] signals, which had poor groundwave coverage, were thought to have a very limited transmission range. In 1924, Conrad demonstrated to Sarnoff that a low-powered shortwave station in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania could be readily received in London by a simple receiver using a curtain rod as an antenna, matching, at a small fraction of the cost, the performance of the massive alternator transmitters. In 1926 [[Harold Beverage|Dr. Harold H. Beverage]] further reported that a shortwave signal, transmitted on a 15-meter wavelength (approximately 20&amp;nbsp;MHz), was received in South America more readily during the daytime than the 200 kilowatt alternator transmissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hard-core-dx.com/nordicdx/antenna/wire/beverage/interview1.html Dr. Harold H. Beverage interview] (hard-core-dx.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alexanderson alternators, control of which had led to RCA's formation, were now considered obsolete, and international communication would be primarily conducted using [[vacuum tube]] transmitters operating on shortwave bands. RCA would continue to operate international telecommunications services for the remainder of its existence, through its subsidiary RCA Communications, Inc., and later the RCA Global Communications Company.

International shortwave was in turn largely supplanted by communications satellites, especially for distributing network radio and television programming. In 1975, the company formed [[SES Americom|RCA American Communications]], which operated its Satcom series of geostationary communications satellites.

===Broadcasting===

The introduction of organized radio broadcasting in the early 1920s resulted in a dramatic reorientation and expansion of RCA's business activities. The development of vacuum tube radio transmitters made audio transmissions practical, in contrast with the earlier transmitters which were limited to sending the dits-and-dahs of [[Morse code]]. Since at least 1916, when he was still at American Marconi, David Sarnoff had proposed establishing broadcasting stations, but his memos to management promoting the idea for sales of a "Radio Music Box" had not been followed up at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Archer (1938), [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89074767138;view=1up;seq=140 pages 112‚Äì113]&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting around 1920 a small number of broadcasting stations began operating, and soon interest in the innovation was spreading nationwide. In the summer of 1921, a Madison Square Garden employee, Julius Hopp, devised a plan to raise charitable funds by broadcasting, from ringside, the July 2, 1921 [[Jack Dempsey versus Georges Carpentier|Dempsey-Carpentier]] heavyweight championship fight to be held in Jersey City, New Jersey. Hopp recruited theaters and halls as listening locations that would charge admission fees to be used as charitable donations. He also contacted RCA's J. Andrew White, the acting president of the National Amateur Wireless Association (NAWA), an organization originally formed by American Marconi which had been inherited by RCA. White agreed to recruit the NAWA membership for volunteers to provide assistance at the listening sites, and also enlisted David Sarnoff for financial and technical support. RCA was authorized to set up a temporary longwave radio station, located in Hoboken a short distance from the match site, and operating under the call letters [[WJY (Hoboken, New Jersey)|WJY]]. For the broadcast White and Sarnoff telephoned commentary from ringside, which was typed up and then read over the air by J. Owen Smith. The demonstration was a technical success, with a claimed audience of 300,000 listeners throughout the northeast.&lt;ref name="stirring"&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101051572624;view=1up;seq=545 "Voice-Broadcasting the Stirring Progress of the 'Battle of the Century'&amp;nbsp;"], ''The Wireless Age'', August 1921, pages 11‚Äì21.&lt;/ref&gt;

RCA quickly moved to expand its broadcasting activities. In the fall of 1921 it set up its first fulltme broadcasting station, [[WDY]], at the Roselle Park, New Jersey company plant. By 1923 RCA was operating three stations‚ÄîWJZ (now [[WABC (AM)|WABC]]) and [[WJY (New York City)|WJY]] in New York City, and WRC (now [[WTEM]]) in Washington, D.C. A restriction imposed by AT&amp;T's interpretation of the patent cross-licensing agreements required that the RCA stations remain commercial free, and they were financed by profits from radio equipment sales.

===National Broadcasting Company===
Beginning in 1922, AT&amp;T became heavily involved in radio broadcasting, and soon became the new industry's most important participant. From the beginning AT&amp;T's policy was to finance stations by commercial sponsorship of the programs. The company also created the first radio network, centered on its New York City station WEAF (now [[WFAN]]), using its long distance telephone lines to interconnect stations. This allowed them to economize by having multiple stations carry the same program.

RCA and its partners soon faced an economic crisis, as the costs of providing programming threatened to exceed the funds available from equipment profits. The problem was resolved in 1926 when AT&amp;T unexpectedly decided to exit the radio broadcasting field. RCA purchased, for $1,000,000, AT&amp;Ts two radio stations, WEAF and [[WCAP (defunct)|WCAP]] in Washington, D.C., as well as its network operations. These assets formed the core for the creation of the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), with ownership divided between RCA (50%), General Electric (30%), and Westinghouse (20%) until 1930, when RCA assumed 100% ownership. This purchase also included the right to begin commercial operations. NBC formed two radio networks that eventually expanded nationwide: the [[NBC Red Network|NBC-Red Network]], with flagship station WEAF, and [[Blue Network|NBC-Blue]], centered on WJZ. Although NBC was originally promoted as expecting to just break even economically, it soon became very profitable, which would be an important factor in helping RCA survive the economic pressures of the [[Great Depression]] that began in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$b78643;view=1up;seq=17 "Early History of Network Broadcasting"], ''Report on Chain Broadcasting: May, 1941'', Federal Communications Commission, pages 5-8, 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerned that NBC's control of two national radio networks gave it too much power over the industry, in 1941 the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) promulgated a rule designed to force NBC to divest one of them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$b78643;view=1up;seq=104 Rule 3.107], ''Report on Chain Broadcasting: May, 1941'', Federal Communications Commission, page 92.&lt;/ref&gt; This order was upheld by the U.S Supreme Court, and on October 12, 1943, the NBC-Blue network was sold to candy magnate [[Edward J. Noble]] for $8,000,000, and renamed "The Blue Network, Inc." In 1946 the name was changed to the [[American Broadcasting Company]]. The "Red" network retained the NBC name, and remained under RCA ownership.

For two decades the NBC radio network's roster of stars provided ratings consistently surpassing those of its main competitor, the [[CBS|Columbia Broadcasting System]] (CBS). But in 1948, as the transition from radio to television was beginning, NBC's leadership came under attack due to what became known as the "Paley raids", named after the president of CBS, [[William S. Paley]]. After World War II the tax rate for annual incomes above $70,000 was 77%, while capital gains were taxed at 25%. Paley worked out an accounting technique whereby individual performers could set up corporations that allowed their earnings to be taxed at the significantly lower rate. Instead of NBC responding with a similar package, Sarnoff decided that this accounting method was legally and ethically wrong. NBC's performers did not agree, and most of the top stars, including [[Amos and Andy]], [[Jack Benny]], [[Red Skelton]], [[Edgar Bergen]], [[Burns and Allen]], [[Ed Wynn]], [[Fred Waring]], [[Al Jolson]], [[Groucho Marx]] and [[Frank Sinatra]] moved from NBC to CBS. As a result, in 1949 CBS now boasted of having sixteen of the twenty top rated programs. The consequences would carry over to television, where CBS maintained its newfound dominance for decades. Paley had personally worked to woo the performers, while Sarnoff professed his indifference to the defections, stating at an annual meeting that "Leadership built over the years on a foundation of solid service cannot be snatched overnight by buying a few high-priced comedians. Leadership is not a laughing matter."&lt;ref&gt;''The General'' by Kenneth Bilby, 1986, pages 246‚Äì249.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio receivers===
RCA acted as the sales agent for a small line of Westinghouse and GE branded receivers and parts used by home constructors, originally for a limited market of [[amateur radio]] enthusiasts. By 1922, the rise of broadcasting had dramatically increased the demand for radio equipment by the general public, and this development was reflected in the title of RCA's June 1, 1922 catalog, "Radio Enters the Home". RCA began selling receivers under the "Radiola" name, marketing equipment produced by GE and Westinghouse under the production agreement that allocated a 60%‚Äì40% ratio in output between the two companies. Although the patent cross-licensing agreements had been intended to give the participants domination of equipment sales, the tremendous growth of the market led to fierce competition, and in 1925 RCA fell behind [[Atwater Kent]] as the leader in receiver sales. RCA was particularly hamstrung by the need to coordinate its sales within the limits of the GE/Westinghouse production quotas, and often had difficulty keeping up with industry trends. However, it made a key advance in early 1924 when it began to sell the first superheterodyne receivers, whose high level of performance increased the brand's reputation and popularity. Until late 1927 all the RCA receivers ran on batteries, but at that point plug-in AC sets were introduced, which provided another boost in sales.&lt;ref&gt;''Radio Manufacturers of the 1920s: Volume 3'' by Alan Douglas, 1991, pages 1‚Äì60.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vacuum tubes==
[[File:RCA OA2.JPG|thumb|125px|RCA voltage regulator vacuum tube.]]
RCA inherited American Marconi's status as a major producer of vacuum tubes, which were branded '''Radiotron''' in the United States. Especially after the rise of broadcasting, they were a major profit source for the company. RCA's strong patent position meant that the company effectively set the selling prices for vacuum tubes in the U.S., which were significantly higher than in Europe, where [[Lee de Forest]] had allowed a key patent issued to him to lapse. RCA was responsible for creating a series of innovative products, ranging from [[Octal tube|octal base]] metal tubes co-developed with [[General Electric]] before World War II, to miniaturized [[Nuvistor]] tubes used in the tuners of the New Vista series of TV sets. The Nuvistor tubes were a last major vacuum tube innovation, and were meant to compete with the newly introduced transistor. By 1975, RCA had completely switched from tubes to solid-state devices in their television sets, except for the [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) picture tube.

==Phonograph==
[[File:Revised RCA emblem from Big Spring, TX, Museum.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The Nipper "His Master's Voice" mascot trademark was acquired as part of the Victor Talking Machine purchase.&lt;ref&gt;RCA trademark exhibit at Heritage Museum in [[Big Spring, Texas|Big Spring]], [[Texas]] (2004 photograph)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The rise of radio broadcasting during the early 1920s, which provided unlimited free home entertainment, caused significant financial problems throughout the established phonograph  record industry. In 1929, RCA purchased the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]], then the world's largest manufacturer of both [[phonograph record|records]] and [[phonograph]]s, including its popular showcase "Victrola" line. This acquisition was organized as a new subsidiary called '''RCA Victor''', and included majority ownership of the [[JVC|Victor Company of Japan]] (JVC).

With this purchase, RCA acquired the western hemisphere rights to the famous [[Nipper]]/"[[His Master's Voice]]" trademark.&lt;ref&gt;The Nipper trademark was also used by the British music &amp; entertainment company [[HMV]].&lt;/ref&gt; RCA Victor popularized combined radio receiver-phonographs, and also created [[RCA Photophone]], a movie [[sound-on-film]] system that competed with [[William Fox (producer)|William Fox]]'s sound-on-film [[Movietone sound system|Movietone]] and [[Warner Bros.]]' [[sound-on-disc]] [[Vitaphone]]. The acquisition of the Victor company also gave RCA superior distribution and manufacturing capability through Victor's established and extensive network of authorized dealers and newly acquired factories in [[Camden, New Jersey]], which began manufacturing radio sets and components, in addition to Victrolas and records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historiccamdencounty.com/ccnews138.shtml|title=A Photo History of RCA's Golden Years in Camden|author=Hoag Levins|date=March 2009|publisher=historiccamdencounty.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RCA Victor began selling the first all electric phonograph in 1930. In 1931, RCA Victor introduced 33‚Öì [[revolutions per minute|revolutions-per-minute]] (rpm) records, which were a commercial failure during the [[Great Depression]], partly because the records and playback equipment were very expensive, and also because the audio performance was generally poor; the new format used the same groove size as existing 78&amp;nbsp;rpm records,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edward|first1=David|title=RCA Program Transcription Album Discography (1931-33)|url=http://bsnpubs.com/rca/rca/rca33.html|website=bsnpubs.com|publisher=Both Sides Now Publications|accessdate=August 19, 2015|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it would require the smaller-radius stylus of the later microgroove systems to achieve acceptable slower-speed performance.&lt;ref&gt;A similar attempt the previous decade by [[Edison Records]] to market a commercial long play record format had also failed. The Edison approach used a microgroove vertically recorded disc with 20 minutes playing time per side.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, during the nadir of the record business in America, RCA Victor introduced the inexpensive Duo Jr., a small, basic turntable designed to be plugged into radio sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ZmjkJwxyWcC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;dq=rca+%2B+%22duo+jr.%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=b_kYdyz9pm&amp;sig=8RDBJsuHcVfsbvMXfQHSxK_tJCg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EjzRVMmsBJCPyAT18ILACg&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=rca%20%2B%20%22duo%20jr.%22&amp;f=false|title=Sound Recording|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also during  the 1930s, RCA sold the modernistic RCA Victor M Special, a polished aluminum portable record player designed by [[John Vassos]] that has become an icon of Thirties American industrial design.&lt;ref&gt;Dominic Muren, [http://www.idfuel.com/index.php?blog=2&amp;p=293&amp;more=1&amp;c=1 "Monday Masterpieces: Streamline+Vinyl=Awesome"], IDFuel: Industrial Design Weblog, 2004. Accessed July 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, RCA Victor released the first 45&amp;nbsp;rpm "single" records, as a response to [[Columbia Records|CBS/Columbia]]'s successful introduction of its microgroove 33‚Öì&amp;nbsp;rpm "[[LP record|LP]]" format. RCA Victor began selling 33‚Öì&amp;nbsp;rpm LP records in 1950,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicinthemail.com/audiohistoryLP.html |title=LPs historic |first=Edward |last=Wallerstein|publisher=musicinthemail.com |date= |accessdate=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BUUEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=%22diskery+goes+33+in+march%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22diskery%20goes%2033%20in%20march%22&amp;f=false|title=Diskery Goes 33 in March To Service Entire Market; 45 Promotion in High Gear|magazine=Billboard|date=7 January 1950|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1951 CBS/Columbia began selling 45&amp;nbsp;rpm records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cubby.net/worldofcubby/RCR/record_history.html |title=Record Collector's Resource: A History of Records |publisher=cubby.net |accessdate=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motion pictures==
RCA also made investments in the movie industry, but they performed poorly. In April 1928 RCA Photophone, Inc., was organized by a group of companies including RCA to develop sound-movie technology. In the fall of 1927, RCA had purchased stock in Film Booking Office (FBO), and on October 25, 1928, with the help of [[Joseph P. Kennedy]], the [[RKO Pictures|Radio-Keith-Orpheum Corporation]] (RKO) studio was formed by merging FBO with Keith-Albee-Orpheum Corporation (KAO), a company whose holdings included motion picture theaters. The theaters in which RKO had an interest provided a potential market for the RCA Photophone sound systems. RCA ownership of RKO stock expanded from approximately 25% in 1930 to approximately 61% in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$b78643;view=1up;seq=25 "RCA's interest in the motion-picture industry",] ''Report on Chain Broadcasting: May, 1941'', Federal Communications Commission, pages 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the RKO studio encountered severe financial problems, going into receivership from early 1933 to 1940. RCA sold its holdings in order to raise funds for its basic operations.

==Separation from General Electric==
Following years of industry complaints that the cross-licensing agreements between RCA, GE and Westinghouse had in effect created spheres-of-influence for the participating companies, resulting in illegal monopolies, in May 1930 the U.S. Department of Justice brought antitrust charges against the three companies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1rIlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pvoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2968%2C1740678 "Government Starts Anti-Trust Suits"], ''Gettysburg Times&lt;/i&gt;, May 14, 1930, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; After a long period of negotiation, in 1932 the Justice Department accepted a consent agreement which removed the restrictions established by the cross-licensing agreements, and also provided that RCA would become a fully independent company. As a result, GE and Westinghouse gave up their ownership interests in RCA, while RCA was allowed to keep its factories.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/bigbusinessradio00archrich#page/364/mode/1up/ "The Consent Decree"], ''Big Business and Radio'' by Gleason L. Archer, 1939, pages 364-386.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to give RCA a chance to establish itself, GE and Westinghouse were required to refrain from competing in the radio business for the next two and one-half years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/broadcasting13unse#page/n959/mode/1up/ "RCA and Associates Separate Under Consent Decree Terms"], ''Broadcasting'', December 1, 1932, page 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==
[[File:1939 RCA Television Advertisement.jpg|thumb|RCA ad for the beginning, in April 1939, of regular experimental TV broadcasting by RCA-NBC over New York City station W2XBS (forerunner of today's WNBC-4), for "an hour at a time, twice a week."&lt;ref&gt;''Radio &amp; Television'' (magazine) Vol. X, No. 2, June, 1939. (inside front cover) New York: Popular Book Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

RCA began TV development in early 1929, after an overly optimistic [[Vladimir K. Zworykin]] convinced Sarnoff that a commercial version of his prototype system could be produced in a relatively short time for $100,000. Following what would actually be many years of additional research and millions of dollars, RCA demonstrated an all-electronic black-and-white television system at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]]. RCA began regular experimental television broadcasting from the NBC studios to the New York metropolitan area on April 30, 1939 via station W2XBS, channel 1 (which evolved into [[WNBC]] channel 4) from the new [[Empire State Building#Broadcast stations|Empire State Building transmitter]] on top of the structure. Around this time, RCA began selling its first television set models, including the TRK-5 and TRK-9, in various New York stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvhistory.tv/1939-RCA-Brochure-1.JPG|title=Brochure for 1939 RCA TV sets|publisher=tvhistory.tv}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the FCC had not approved the start of commercial television operations, because technical standards had not been yet been finalized. Concerned that RCA's broadcasts were an attempt to flood the market with sets that would force it to adopt RCA's current technology, the FCC stepped in to limit its broadcasts.

Following the adoption of [[National Television System Committee]] (NTSC) recommended standards, the FCC authorized the start of commercial television broadcasts on July 1, 1941. The entry of the United States into World War II a few months later greatly slowed its deployment, but RCA resumed selling television receivers almost immediately after the war ended in 1945. (''See also:'' [[History of television]])

In 1950, the FCC adopted a standard for [[color television]] that had been promoted by CBS, but the effort soon failed, primarily because the color broadcasts could not be received by existing black-and-white sets. As the result of a major research push, RCA engineers developed a method of "compatible" color transmissions that, through the use of interlacing, simultaneously broadcast color and black-and-white images, which could be picked up by both color and existing black-and-white sets. In 1953, RCA's all-electronic color TV technology was adopted as the standard for American television. At that time, Sarnoff predicted annual color TV sales would reach 1.78 million in 1956, but the sets were expensive and difficult to adjust, and there was initially a lack of color programming, so sales lagged badly and the actual 1956 total would only be 120,000.&lt;ref&gt;Bilby (1986), pages 208, 213.&lt;/ref&gt; RCA's ownership of NBC proved to be a major benefit, as that network was instructed to promote its color programming offerings; even so, it was only in 1968 that color TV sales in the U.S. surpassed black-and-white.

While lauding the technical prowess of his engineers who had developed color TV, David Sarnoff, in marked contrast to William Paley of CBS, did not disguise his dislike for popular TV programs. His authorized biography even boasted that "no one has yet caught him in communion with one of the upper dozen or so top-rated programs" and "The popular programs, to put the matter bluntly, have very little appeal for him."&lt;ref&gt;''David Sarnoff'' by Eugene Lyons, 1966, page 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

RCA [[professional video camera]]s and studio gear, particularly of the [[RCA TK-40|TK-40/41]] series, became standard equipment at many American television network affiliates, as RCA [[CT-100]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novia.net/~ereitan/Gallery/CT-100_Gallery.html|title=CT-100 Color Receiver Gallery|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060102044925/http://www.novia.net/~ereitan/Gallery/CT-100_Gallery.html|archivedate=2006-01-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("RCA Merrill" to dealers) television sets introduced color television to the public.

==Diversification==
[[File:Sarnoff RCA videotape recorder 1954.jpg|thumb|left|175px|David Sarnoff with the first RCA videotape recorder, 1954.]]
[[File:RCA Video-Aufzeichnungsger√§t.jpg|thumb|227x227px|RCA Television Quad head 2" color recorder/ reproducer used at broadcast studios in the late 1960s, 70s and early 80s.&lt;ref&gt;Based on a design originally developed by [[Ampex]] in the mid-1950s, it used a vertical scanning drum with head motion at 90¬∞ to tape direction. This [[Quadruplex videotape|method]] was developed prior to [[helical scan]]ning, used in commercial and home tape machines.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 1941, a few months before the United States entered World War II, the cornerstone was laid for a research and development facility in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] called RCA Laboratories. Led for many years by [[Elmer William Engstrom|Elmer Engstrom]], it was used to develop many innovations, including [[color television]], the [[electron microscope]], [[CMOS]]-based technology, [[heterojunction]] physics, [[Light-emitting diode#Discoveries and early devices|optoelectronic emitting devices]], [[liquid crystal display]]s (LCDs), [[videocassette recorder]]s, [[Direct-broadcast satellite|direct broadcast television, direct broadcast satellite systems]] and [[high-definition television]].

During World War II, RCA was involved in [[radar]] and radio development in support of the war effort, and ranked 43rd among United States corporations in the value of wartime military production contracts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|Peck, Merton J.]] &amp; [[Frederic M. Scherer|Scherer, Frederic M.]] ''The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis'' (1962) [[Harvard Business School]] p.619&lt;/ref&gt; During and after the war, RCA set up several new divisions for defense, space exploration and other activities. The RCA Service Corporation provided large numbers of staff for the [[Distant Early Warning Line|Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line]]. RCA units won five [[Army‚ÄìNavy "E" Award]]s for Excellence in production.&lt;ref&gt;''Radio Age'' by the Radio Corporation of America, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Also during the war, ties between RCA and JVC were severed.

In 1955, RCA sold its Estate large appliance operations to [[Whirlpool Corporation]]. As part of the transaction, Whirlpool was given the right to market "RCA Whirlpool" appliances through the mid-1960s.

RCA was one of a number of companies in the 1960s that entered the mainframe computer field in order to challenge the market leader [[IBM|International Business Machines]] (IBM) (see also: [[Computing]]). Although at this time computers were almost universally used for routine data  processing and scientific research, in 1964 Sarnoff, who prided himself as a visionary, predicted that "The computer will become the hub of a vast network of remote data stations and information banks feeding into the machine at a transmission rate of a billion or more bits of information a second... Eventually, a global communications network handling voice, data and facsimile will instantly link man to machine‚Äîor machine to machine‚Äîby land, air, underwater, and space circuits. [The computer] will affect man's ways of thinking, his means of education, his relationship to his physical and social environment, and it will alter his ways of living. ... [Before the end of this century, these forces] will coalesce into what unquestionably will become the greatest adventure of the human mind."&lt;ref&gt;Lyons (1966), page 339, from a speech delivered in October 1964 to the Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt;

RCA marketed a [[RCA Spectra 70|Spectra 70]] computer line that was hardware, but not software, compatible with IBM's [[System/360]] series. It also produced the RCA Series, which competed against the [[IBM System/370]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/RCA/RCA.SPECTRA70.1965.102646099.pdf |title=RCA Spectra 70|date=March 1965|accessdate=1 June 2017| publisher=(computerhistory.org)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technology was leased to the [[English Electric]] company, which used it for their System 4 series, which were essentially RCA Spectra 70 clones. RCA's TSOS operating system was the first mainframe, demand paging, virtual memory operating system on the market. Despite significant investment, in 1971 RCA only had a 4% market share, and it was estimated that it would cost $500 million over the next five years to remain competitive with the IBM/370 series. On September 17, 1971 the RCA Board of Directors announced its decision to close its computer systems division (RCA-CSD), which would be written off as a $490 million company loss. [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry Rand]]'s UNIVAC division took over the RCA base in January 1972.

RCA Graphic Systems Division (GSD) was an early supplier of electronics designed for the printing and publishing industries. It contracted with German company [[Rudolf Hell]] to market adaptations of the Digiset photocomposition system as the Videocomp, and a Laser Color Scanner. The Videocomp was supported by a Spectra computer that ran the Page-1 and, later the Page-II and FileComp composition systems. RCA later sold the Videocomp rights to [[Information International Inc.]]

RCA became a major proponent of the [[8-track tape|eight-track tape cartridge]], which it launched in 1965. The eight-track cartridge initially had a huge and profitable impact on the consumer marketplace. Sales of the 8-track tape format declined when consumers increasingly favored the 4-track compact cassette tape format developed by [[Philips]].

==Later years==
On January 1, 1965, Robert Sarnoff succeeded his father as RCA's president, although the elder Sarnoff remained in control as chairman of the board. In 1969, the company name was changed from "Radio Corporation of America" to the "RCA Corporation", to reflect its broader range of corporate activities and expansion into other countries. At the end of that same year David Sarnoff, after being incapacitated by a long-term illness, was removed as the company's chairman of the board. He died two years later.

RCA's exit from the mainframe computer market in 1971 marked a milestone in its transition from technology toward diversification as a business [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]. During the late 1960s and 1970s, the company made a wide-ranging series of acquisitions, including [[The Hertz Corporation|Hertz]] (rental cars), [[Banquet Foods|Banquet]] (frozen foods and [[TV dinner]]s), [[Beaulieu International Group|Coronet]] (carpeting), [[Random House]] (publishing) and [[American Greetings|Gibson]] (greeting cards). However, the company was slipping into financial disarray, with wags calling it "Rugs Chickens &amp; Automobiles" (RCA), to poke fun at its new direction.&lt;ref name=Chickens&gt;{{cite book|last=Clausing|first=Don |title=Effective Innovation|year=2004|publisher=ASME Press|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TnFRAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Rugs+Chickens+%26+Automobiles&amp;dq=Rugs+Chickens+%26+Automobiles&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZyhJT_CVMIXZ0QHx5fz_DQ&amp;redir_esc=y|author2=Victor Fey |accessdate=25 February 2012|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Sarnoff's time as president was unsuccessful, marked by falling profits. He was ousted in a 1975 "[[boardroom coup]]" led by Anthony Conrad, who became the new company president. Conrad resigned less than a year later after he admitted failing to file income tax returns for six years. His successor, Edgar H. Griffiths, proved to be unpopular and retired in early 1981. Thornton Bradshaw would be the next, and last, RCA president.

RCA maintained its high standards of engineering excellence in broadcast engineering and satellite communications equipment, but ventures such as the NBC radio and television networks declined. Around 1980, RCA corporate strategy reported on moving manufacture of its television sets to Mexico. RCA was still profitable in 1983, when it switched manufacturing of its VHS VCRs from [[Panasonic]] to [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]].

Projects attempting to establish new [[consumer electronics]] products during this era, lost money. An [[RCA Studio II]] home video game console, introduced in 1977, was canceled just under two years later due to poor sales. A [[Capacitance Electronic Disc|capacitance electronic (CED) videodisc]], marketed under the [[SelectaVision]] name, was launched in 1981 after several years of delays. The system was practically obsolete when it finally did appear, and never developed the manufacturing volumes needed to substantially bring down its price. The CED system was unable to compete against the newer cheaper, recordable videotape technology, and was abandoned in 1985, after a write-off of several hundred million dollars.

In 1981, Columbia sold its share in the home video division to RCA and outside of North America this division was renamed to "RCA/Columbia Pictures International Video". The following year, within North America, it was renamed to "RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video". In 1983, [[Arista Records]] owner [[Bertelsmann]] sold 50% of Arista to RCA. In 1985, Bertelsmann and RCA formed a joint venture called RCA/Ariola International, which took over management of [[RCA Records]].&lt;ref name="bertelsmann.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bertelsmann.com/bertelsmann_corp/wms41/customers/bmcorp/pdf/RCA_-_Now_Elvis_rocked_for_Bertelsmann__too.pdf |title=RCA: Now Elvis rocked for Bertelsmann, too |publisher=Bertelsmann Worldwide Media |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215083847/http://www.bertelsmann.com/bertelsmann_corp/wms41/customers/bmcorp/pdf/RCA_-_Now_Elvis_rocked_for_Bertelsmann__too.pdf |archivedate=2013-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, RCA Broadcast Systems Division moved from [[Camden, New Jersey]], to the site of the RCA antenna engineering facility in [[Gibbsboro, New Jersey]]. On October 3, 1985, RCA announced it was closing the Broadcast Systems Division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JMTnTBmt7F0C&amp;pg=PA212&amp;lpg=PA212&amp;dq=rca+%2B+%22broadcast+systems%22+%2B+1985&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T8WAeIglE5&amp;sig=dzT0Yo7iCCf2YVXUIN9bPdDEI5g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CilwVaaHOtGZyAS3lYBY&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=rca%20%2B%20%22broadcast%20systems%22%20%2B%201985&amp;f=false|title=The History of Television, 1942 to 2000|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years that followed, the broadcast product lines developed in Camden were terminated or sold off, and most of the buildings and factories in Camden were demolished, except for a few of the old, original  Victor buildings that had been declared national historic buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldradio.com/archives/hardware/TV/RCA-TV.htm|title=RCA TV Equipment Archive|publisher=oldradio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; For several years, RCA spinoff [[L-3 Communications]] Systems East was headquartered in the famous [[Nipper Building]], but has since moved to an adjacent building built by the city for them. The Nipper Building now houses shops and luxury loft apartments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thevictorlofts.com The Victor Lofts website], Camden, New Jersey. victorlofts.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Re-acquisition and break-up by General Electric==
In December 1985, it was announced that General Electric would reacquire its former subsidiary for $6.28 billion in cash, or $66.50 per share of stock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1985-12-12/news/mn-16152_1_general-electric-will "General Electric Will Buy RCA for $6.28 Billion"] by Paul Richer, ''Los Angeles Times'', December 12, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; The sale was completed the next year, and GE proceeded to immediately sell off most of the RCA assets. (The only RCA unit which GE ultimately retained was Government Services.) GE disposed of its 50% interest in RCA Records to its partner [[Bertelsmann]], and the company was renamed BMG Music, for [[Bertelsmann Music Group]]. In 1987, RCA Global Communications Inc., a division with roots dating back to RCA's founding, was sold to the MCI Communications Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/04/business/mci-agrees-to-acquire-rca-global-from-ge.html "MCI Agrees to Acquire RCA Global From G.E."] by Barnaby J. Feder, ''New York Times'', September 4, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The rights to make RCA and GE-branded televisions and other consumer electronics products were purchased in 1988 by the French company [[Technicolor SA|Thomson Consumer Electronics]], in exchange for some of Thomson's medical businesses. (For information on the RCA brand after 1986, see [[RCA (trademark)]].) That same year, its semiconductor business (including the former RCA Solid State unit and [[Intersil]]) was bought by [[Harris Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/09/business/company-news-harris-signs-accord-to-buy-a-unit-of-ge.html|title=Company News; Harris Signs Accord To Buy a Unit of G.E.|date=November 9, 1988|publisher = New York Times|access-date = June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, GE sold its share in RCA/Columbia to Sony Pictures which renamed the unit to "Columbia TriStar Home Video" (later further renamed to Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment, now Sony Pictures Home Entertainment). This merger surpassed the [[Capital Cities/ABC]] merger that happened earlier in 1985 as the largest non-oil merger in business history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1985/12/11/General-Electric-Co-in-the-largest-non-oil-merger-in/1818503125200/|title=General Electric Co., in the largest non-oil merger in...|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarnoff Labs was put on a five-year plan whereby GE would fund all the labs' activities for the first year, then reduce its support to near zero after the fifth year. This required Sarnoff Labs to change its business model to become an industrial contract research facility. In 1988 it was transferred to [[SRI International]] (SRI) as the [[David Sarnoff Research Center]], and subsequently renamed the [[Sarnoff Corporation]]. In January 2011 it was fully integrated into SRI.&lt;ref name="Sarnoff integration"&gt;{{Cite press release|url=http://www.sri.com/newsroom/press-releases/sri-international-completes-integration-sarnoff-corporation|title=SRI International Completes Integration of Sarnoff Corporation|publisher=[[SRI International]]|date=2011-01-01|accessdate=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GE sold all of its radio station holdings to various owners, and the [[NBC Radio Network]] to [[Westwood One (1976‚Äì2011)|Westwood One]]. In 2011, a controlling interest in the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]], by this time part of the multimedia [[NBC Universal]] venture that included TV and cable, was sold by GE to [[Comcast]], and in 2013, Comcast acquired the remaining interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/technology/articles/2013/02/12/general-electric-gets-out-of-the-tv-business?offset=20|title=General Electric gets out of the TV business|author=Scott Mayerowitz (AP Business Writer)|date=12 February 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:RCA Nipper Camden NJ A.JPG|right|250px|thumb|The historic RCA Building 17 is one of the few remaining buildings in [[Camden, New Jersey]] that once housed the vast RCA Victor complex.]]
RCA [[antique radio]]s, and early color television receivers such as the RCA Merrill/CT-100, are among the more sought-after collectible radios and televisions, due to their popularity during the [[old-time radio|golden age of radio]] and the historic significance of the RCA name, as well as their styling, manufacturing quality and engineering innovations. Most collectable are the pre-war television sets manufactured by RCA beginning in 1939, including the TRK-5, TRK-9 and TRK-12 models.

The historic RCA Victor Building 17, the "[[Nipper Building]]", in [[Camden, New Jersey]], was converted to luxury apartments in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.nj.us/dep/hpo/4sustain/awds2004.htm#4 "RCA Victor Company, 'Nipper Building' Rehabilitation"], New Jersey Historic Preservation Awards Program, 2004,.&lt;/ref&gt;

A type of plug/jack combination used in audio and video cables is still called the [[RCA connector]].

To this day, a variety of consumer electronics including 2-in-1 tablets, televisions and telephones, home appliances and more are sold under the RCA brand name.

===Environmental issues===
Numerous former RCA manufacturing sites have been reported to be polluted with industrial waste.
* A former RCA facility in Taiwan's northern county of [[Taoyuan City|Taoyuan]] (now Taoyuan City) polluted groundwater with toxic chemicals and led to a high incidence of cancer among former employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Yi |first=Matthew |url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Taiwan-workers-plead-cancer-case-Link-RCA-plant-2833443.php |title=Taiwan workers plead cancer case / Link RCA plant to disease |work=San Francisco Chronicle |publisher=Hearst Communications |date=May 24, 2002 |accessdate=2014-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ton, 1999 Ton C-D, Exposure and Health Risk Assessment of Groundwater Contamination&amp;nbsp;‚Äì A Case Study of Contamination Site of Tao-Yuan RCA.

GE and Thomson spent millions of dollars for cleanup, removing {{convert|10000|cuyd|m3}} of soil and installing municipal water treatment facilities for neighboring communities. A spokesman for RCA's current owners denied responsibility, saying a study conducted by the Taiwan government showed no correlation between the illnesses and the company's facilities, which shut down in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/news2002/0522-11.htm Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327232523/http://www.commondreams.org/news2002/0522-11.htm |date=2009-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 17, 2015, RCA lost the case and the Taipei District Court  ordered RCA's current owners to compensate its former employees with a total of NT$560 million (approximately USD18.1 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chao, Stephanie |url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/local/taipei/2015/04/18/433937/RCA-parent.htm|title=RCA parent firms to pay NT$560 mil.|date=18 April 2015|accessdate=2015-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A plant in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]] which RCA operated from the late 1940s to June 1986, released more than 250,000 pounds of [[1,1,1-trichloroethane]] pollutants per year from its exhaust stacks. Tests by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) in the late 1980s and early 1990s, found the groundwater contaminated by [[trichloroethylene]] (TCE) and [[1,2-dichloroethylene]] (1,2-DCE).&lt;ref name="epa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/reg3wcmd/ca/pa/pdf/pad003026903.pdf|title=Corrective Action Programs around the Nation - US EPA|first=US|last=EPA,OSWER,ORCR,PIID|website=US EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 and 1992, contaminants were detected in monitoring wells on the east side of the [[Conestoga River]] in Lancaster.
* The shallow and deep groundwater aquifers beneath the [[Intersil]] Facility in [[Mountaintop, Pennsylvania]], which RCA operated in the 1960s and later sold to [[Harris Corporation]], were found in 1999 to contain elevated levels of [[volatile organic compound]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Intersil Corporation, [http://sec.edgar-online.com/intersil-corpde/s-1-securities-registration-statement/1999/11/12/Section130.aspx S-1 SEC Filing, 11/10/1999]&lt;/ref&gt;
* A site in [[Burlington, Massachusetts]] which RCA used from 1958 to 1994 to make and test military electronics equipment, generated hazardous waste ([[Volatile organic compound|VOCs]], [[Trichloroethylene|TCE]], [[toluene]], [[ethylbenzene]], and [[xylene]]s).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/region1/superfund/resource/report01/remedial.pdf SUPERFUND ANNUAL REPORT 2001].

In June 2017, Centrica Storage Ltd announced that gas injection and storage would cease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cessation of Storage Operations at Rough |url=https://www.centrica.com/news/cessation-storage-operations-rough |website=www.centrica.com |accessdate=18 June 2018 |date=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Easington Natural Gas Terminal - geograph.org.uk - 304760.jpg|thumb|Easington gas terminal. From here the gas flow in and out of the Rough Field is managed.]]
Licences for the Rough Field were given in 1964. Gas was brought ashore to Easington gas processing terminal in 1975. In 1980 BG Corporation (which became [[British Gas plc]] in 1986 following privatisation) purchased the Rough field with one third of reserves depleted with the idea of converting the field into a gas storage facility to manage seasonal trends in the supply and demand of gas in the UK. In 1983 BG Corporation made the final decision to convert Rough into a natural gas storage facility. This would be the largest gas storage facility built in the UK continental shelf. In 1985 the Rough storage facility became operational.

The break up of BG Corporation in 1997 into [[BG Group]] and [[Centrica]] meant that BG Storage was created as a standalone business due to competition reasons. In 2001, BG Storage sold the Rough Facility to [[Dynegy]]. In 2002, Centrica bought the plant back from Dynergy for ¬£304m during its period of near-bankruptcy. The purchase of Rough led to the Competition Commission requesting certain undertakings being put in place due to Centrica's control of the Morecambe Bay gas fields which at the time were providing 10‚Äì15% of the UK's gas supply. In 2003 Centrica provided [[Department of Energy and Climate Change|DECC]] with a set of undertakings and Centrica Storage Ltd (a wholly owned subsidiary of Centrica Plc) was formed.

Centrica Storage Ltd still operates the Rough facility in accordance with the undertakings.

In June 2017, Centrica announced the closure of the Rough gas storage site due to safety concerns. The rundown of the plant will take up to four years to complete.&lt;ref name="TG"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Vaughan |first1=Adam |title=Closure of UK‚Äôs largest gas storage site ‚Äòcould mean volatile prices‚Äô |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/20/uk-gas-storage-prices-rough-british-gas-centrica |accessdate=18 June 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==

The facility consists of a partially depleted [[gas field]] (the Rough field) in the Southern [[North Sea]], approximately 18 miles off the east coast of [[Yorkshire]], together with an [[Onshore (hydrocarbons)|onshore]] gas processing terminal at [[Easington, East Riding of Yorkshire|Easington]], approximately 27 miles south east of [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]].

The Rough processing terminal forms a part of the larger [[Easington Gas Terminal]] which can inject upwards of 125 million [[cubic metre]]s per day (approximately 40% of the daily UK supply).

The Rough facility is operated by Centrica Storage Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Centrica]]. Nearly 200 staff and contractors are employed within the operation, both onshore and [[Offshore (hydrocarbons)|offshore]]. It has a storage capacity of 3.31 billion cubic metres which is approximately 70% of the UK's gas storage capacity (approximately nine days' supply). Rough can supply 10% of the UK's peak gas demand and as such is an important part of the UK's gas infrastructure. Operational problems lead to a partial shutdown in 2016, requiring increased imports during winter.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20160720175840/https://eandt.theiet.org/news/2016/jul/winter-gas-imports.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TG"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/564a1ec0-8288-11e7-a4ce-15b2513cb3ff&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the announcement of the rundown of the facility in June 2017, Rough facility was the only depleted UK offshore gas field reservoir that is used for gas storage and retrieval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rough to permanently close after safety concerns - BeondBeond |url=https://beondgroup.com/be-informed/rough-gas-storage-close-safety-concerns/ |website=beondgroup.com |accessdate=18 June 2018 |date=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several projects have been developed to use other depleted offshore fields but none have proved to be economically viable. Two examples are the [[Bacton Gas Terminal#Baird and Deborah gas storage|Baird and the Deborah Gas Storage]] projects.

'''RƒÅzna National Park''' ({{lang-lv|RƒÅznas nacionƒÅlais parks}}) is a [[national park]] in the [[Latgale]] region of [[Latvia]]. It was established in 2007 and covers an area of {{Convert|532|km2|abbr=on}}. The initiative to create the RƒÅzna National Park out of an already existing nature park came from the [[Daugavpils University]]. 

This national park was created to protect [[Lake RƒÅzna]], the second largest [[lake]] in Latvia, and the surrounding areas. Because of this, 14% of the surface area of the national park consists of water surfaces. Valuable ecosystems - natural deciduous forests with many rare species of plants are found on several of the 26 islands in E≈æezers lake. Of high value are also the semi-natural grasslands.

A '''scrap metal shredder''', also sometimes referred to as a metal scrap shredder, is a machine used for reducing the size of scrap metal. Scrap metal shredders come in many different variations and sizes.

==Applications==
Some examples of scrap metal materials that are commonly shredded are:

[[Automotive shredder residue|Auto shredders]] are large machines that turn a car into a large bucket of scrap steel and the rest of the car into non-ferrous materials, plastics and waste. The glass, fabric, plastic, and all other non ferrous materials are separated by eddy current magnets in place of heavy media separation. The non-ferrous materials may be referred to as "zorba."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dailygazette.com/article/2018/07/12/albany-scrap-metal-processor-to-install-massive-shredder|title=Albany scrap metal processor to install massive shredder|last=Cropley|first=John|date=July 12, 2018|website=The Daily Gazette|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the profit from the non ferrous materials covers the operating cost for the auto-shredder.

Metal scrap recycling, also called secondary metal processing, is a large industry that processes, in the U.S. alone, 56 million tons of scrap iron and steel (including 10 million tons of scrap automobiles), 1.5 million tons of scrap copper, 2.5 million tons of scrap aluminum, 1.3 million tons of scrap lead, 300,000 tons of scrap zinc and 800,000 tons of scrap stainless steel, and smaller quantities of other metals, on a yearly basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/recycling/recycling_scrap_metal.html|title=Recycling - Scrap Metal Recycling|last=|first=|date=|website=US Occupational Safety and Health Administration|language=EN-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Scrap metal shredders can be equipped with different types of cutting systems: horizontal shaft, vertical shaft, single-shaft, two-shaft, three-shaft and four-shaft cutting systems. These shredder designs can be high speed, medium speed and sometimes slow-speed systems, they always include hammermills of a vertical and horizontal shaft design, and can also include in contrast to hammer mills slow speed technology which are also used to process or shred metal and plastic and other waste materials encountered in the scrap metal industry.
 
The largest scrap metal shredders in the world often have 10,000 hp and are made by a wide range of companies which all originated their designs from the 1966 patent applications of the Newell Group and the Williams Group as the first patented vertical and horizontal designs for auto shredding or scrap metal shredding. Often cited is the 9,200 hp shredder from the Lynxs group at the Sims plant at the mouth of the [[River Usk]] in Newport [[Wales]] with access by [[road]], [[rail transport|rail]] and [[sea]]. This Lynxs shredder can eat 350 cars per hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/5893440/the-worlds-biggest-auto-shredder-eats-450-cars-an-hour/|title=The World's Biggest Auto Shredder Eats 450 Cars an Hour|last=Tarantola|first=Andrew|work=Gizmodo|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Lynxs shredders are not unique in this high hp range design. Historically the Schnitzer Steel group installed a 10,000 hp unit that they made on their own in 1980, and there are many Newell Shredders that have these high hp designs. A 9,000 horsepower Mega Shredder at Sims Metal Management's Claremont Terminal in Jersey City, New Jersey processes 4,000 tons of metal a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2013/04/behold_the_mega_shredder_jerse.html|title=Behold the Mega Shredder: Jersey City recycling plant turns cars to confetti in seconds|last=|first=|date=April 28, 2013|work=NJ.com|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1071">A '''spar''' tree is the tree used as the highest anchor point in a [[High lead logging|high lead]] [[cable logging]] setup. The spar tree is selected based on height, location and especially strength and lack of rot in order to withstand the weight and pressure required.  Once a spar tree is selected, a climber would remove the tree's limbs and top the tree (a logging term for cutting off the top of the tree).  [[Block and tackle]] is then affixed to the tree and cabling is run.

A "high climber" is the member of the logging crew who scales the tree, limbs it, and tops it.

Selecting a tree as a spar is a particularly important task, so the strength and importance of the spar came to hold symbolic meaning for early loggers of the West.

The use of spar trees in logging is now rare, having been replaced since the 1970s by portable towers, called [[yarders]], which can be erected on logging sites and moved as needed.

The '''steam digester''' (or '''bone digester''', and also known as '''Papin‚Äôs digester''') is a high-pressure cooker invented by French physicist [[Denis Papin]] in 1679. It is a device for extracting fats from bones in a high-pressure steam environment, which also renders them brittle enough to be easily ground into [[bone meal]]. It is the forerunner of the [[autoclave]] and the domestic [[pressure cooker]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/results.asp?image=10182360&amp;wwwflag=2&amp;imagepos=1 Papin‚Äôs steam digester], Science and Society ‚Äì Picture Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

The steam-release valve, which was invented for Papin's digester following various explosions of the earlier models, inspired the development of the piston-and-cylinder [[steam engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Guns, Germs and Steel|last=Diamond|first=Jared|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|year=1997|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Boyle-Papin-Digester.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Robert Boyle]] and [[Denis Papin]] inspecting Papin's digester.]]
Artificial vacuum was first produced in 1643 by Italian scientist [[Evangelista Torricelli]] and further developed by German scientist [[Otto von Guericke]] with his [[Magdeburg hemispheres]]. Guerike's demonstration was documented by [[Gaspar Schott]], in a book that was read by [[Robert Boyle]]. Boyle and his assistant [[Robert Hooke]] improved Guericke's air pump design and built their own.  From this, through various experiments, they formulated what is called [[Boyle's law]], which states that the volume of a body of an ideal gas is inversely proportional to its pressure.  Soon the [[ideal gas law]] was formulated.

Based on these concepts in 1679 a Boyle's associate, named [[Denis Papin]], built a ''bone digester'', which is a closed vessel with a tightly fitting lid that confines steam until a high pressure is generated. Later designs implemented a steam release valve to keep the machine from exploding. By watching the valve rhythmically moving up and down, Papin conceived the idea of a piston and cylinder engine. He did not, however, follow through with his design. In 1697, independent of Papin's designs, engineer [[Thomas Savery]] built the world's first steam engine.&lt;ref name="treatise"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=k89TAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA109&amp;lpg=PA109#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A Treatise on the Steam Engine], Historical Practical and Descriptive, John Farey, London 1827, page 109. The book proves that Savery's invention was independent of Papin's research, but that in French literature of the time, Papin was usually attributed as the original inventor of the steam engine, and Savery was referred to as having borrowed Papin's ideas.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1712 an improved design based on Papin's ideas was developed by [[Thomas Newcomen]].&lt;ref&gt;''A Treatise'', page 127&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyle speaks of Papin as having gone to England in the hope of finding a place in which he could satisfactorily pursue his favorite studies. Boyle himself had already been long engaged in the study of pneumatics, and had been especially interested in the investigations which had been original with Guericke. He admitted young Papin into his laboratory, and the two philosophers worked together at these attractive problems.
He probably invented his "Digester" while in England, and it was first described in a brochure written in English, under the title, "The New Digester." It was subsequently published in Paris.

This was a vessel, B, capable of being tightly closed by a screw, D, and a lid, C, in which food could be cooked in water raised by a furnace, A, to the temperature due to any desired safe pressure of steam. The pressure was determined and limited by a weight, W; on the safety valve lever, G. It is probable that this essential attachment to the steam boiler had previously been used for other purposes; but Papin is given the credit of having first made use of it to control the pressure of steam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.rochester.edu/steam/thurston/1878/Chapter1.html Growth of the Steam Engine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204034636/http://www.history.rochester.edu/steam/thurston/1878/Chapter1.html |date=2012-02-04 }} - B.C. 200 to A.D. 1650, ''Steam Engine Library'', University of Rochester.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1787, [[Antoine Lavoisier]], in his ''Elements of Chemistry'', refers to "Papin's digester" and discusses how the strong compression of water and other liquids in it, which is able to sustain a red heat, creates artificial atmospheres, which may potentially be able to soften or liquefy stones, salts, and the various parts of the earth.&lt;ref&gt;Lavoisier, Antoine. (1787). ''Elements of Chemistry''. New York: Dover Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sustainable South Bronx''' (SSBx) is a non-profit  workforce development and [[environmental justice]] solutions organization in [[New York City]]'s [[South Bronx]] neighborhood, founded by  [[Majora Carter]] in 2001.&lt;ref name=Rockwell&gt;Cynthia E. Rockwell, "Breaking the Grip of Poverty", ''Wesleyan'' ([[Wesleyan University]] alumni magazine), Issue IV 2006, 33‚Äì37.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it is a division of the Brooklyn-based workforce development organization,The HOPE Program.&lt;ref name="coolroofs"&gt;{{cite web|title=NYC CoolRoofs - NYC Business|url=https://www1.nyc.gov/nycbusiness/article/nyc-coolroofs|website=www1.nyc.gov|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization spearheaded the creation of [[Hunts Point Riverside Park]], the first piece of the projected [[South Bronx Greenway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Daniel|title=Sustainable South Bronx wins EPA award|url=https://nypost.com/2010/04/30/sustainable-south-bronx-wins-epa-award/|website=New York Post|accessdate=18 December 2017|date=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This organization also pioneered a "[[green roof]]" project in the South Bronx with its own for-profit installation company SmartRoofs, LLC, and started a "green-collar" job training program called Bronx Environmental Stewardship Program (B.E.S.T.) which prepares urban residents in areas such as ecological restoration, [[hazardous waste]] cleanup, [[green roof]] installation and maintenance, urban forestry, and landscaping; the program has a 90% placement rate after four years of operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=Emily|title=Self-gentrification: A South Bronx lesson for Portland {{!}} Street Roots|url=http://news.streetroots.org/2016/12/12/self-gentrification-south-bronx-lesson-portland|website=news.streetroots.org|publisher=Street Roots News|accessdate=18 December 2017|date=12 Dec 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also proposing a Bronx Eco-Industrial Complex as an alternative use for a piece of land where the city government currently is planning to construct a [[prison]], and are engaged in developing "a collection of businesses in which the waste and byproducts of one business are the raw materials for another one."&lt;ref name=Rockwell /&gt;

In 2005, SSBx built the "Cool and Greenroof Demonstration Project" above their offices in the historic American Banknote Building&amp;nbsp;‚Äî the first such roof in the City of New York. In 2007, SSBx launched the for-profit SmartRoofs, LLC green roof installation business.

Today, SSBx still runs a robust 12 week green jobs training program (formerly called the Bronx Environmental Stewardship Training (BEST), now called Sustainable South Bronx. Training topics range from landscaping, energy auditing, green infrastructure, OSHA and BPI certifications and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehopeprogram.org/how-it-works/|title=How It Works|website=The HOPE Program|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program aims to provide economic empowerment to the community through training, employment and career services, while contributing to the environmental sustainability of New York City. SSBx also runs two transitional employment programs, which provide participants with on the job training, valuable experience, and a fair wage for their work.

A '''symplectite''' (or '''symplektite''') is a material texture: a micrometre-scale or submicrometre-scale intergrowth of two or more crystals. Symplectites form from the breakdown of unstable phases, and may be composed of minerals, ceramics, or metals. Fundamentally, their formation is the result of slow grain-boundary diffusion relative to interface propagation rate.&lt;ref&gt;Cahn, J. W. (1959), The kinetics of cellular segregation reactions, Acta Metall., 7, 18‚Äì 28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, R. (1983), Eutectic Solidification Processing, 370 pp., Butterworths, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee, H. J. 1988"&gt;Lee, H. J., G. Spanos, G. J. Shiflet, and H. I. Aaronson (1988), Mechanisms of the bainite (non-lamellar eutectoid) reaction and a fundamental distinction between the bainite and pearlite (lamellar eutectoid) reactions, Acta Metall., 36, 1129‚Äì 1140.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a material undergoes a change in temperature, pressure or other physical conditions (e.g., fluid composition or activity), one or more phases may be rendered unstable and recrystallize to more stable constituents. If the recrystallized minerals are fine grained and intergrown, this may be termed a symplectite. A cellular precipitation reaction, in which a reactant phase decomposes to a product phase with the same structure as the parent phase and a second phase with a different structure, can form a symplectite.&lt;ref&gt;Sundquist, B. E. (1973), Cellular precipitation, Metall. Trans., 4, 1919‚Äì
1934.&lt;/ref&gt; Eutectoid reactions, involving the breakdown of a single phase to two or more phases, neither of which is structurally or compositionally identical to the parent phase, can also form symplectites.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, C. W., and D. J. Mack (1962), Eutectoid transformations in nonferrous and ferrous alloy systems, in Decomposition of Austenite
by Diffusional Processes, edited by V. F. Zackay and H. I. Aaronson, pp. 549‚Äì 606, John Wiley, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Symplectites may be formed by [[Chemical reaction|reaction]] between adjacent phases or to decomposition of a single phase. The intergrown phases may be planar or rodlike, depending on the volume proportions of the phases, their interfacial free energies, the rate of reaction, the Gibbs free energy change, and the degree of recrystallization. Lamellar symplectites are common in retrogressed [[eclogite]]. [[Kelyphite]] is a symplectite formed from the decomposition of [[garnet]].&lt;ref name=Passchier&gt;Passchier, Cees W. and Rudolph A. J. Trouw, ''Microtectonics,'' Springer, 2nd ed. 205 p. 231 {{ISBN|978-3-540-64003-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Myrmekite]] is a globular or bulbous symplectite of [[quartz]] in [[plagioclase]].&lt;ref name=Passchier/&gt;

Examples of symplectites formed in Earth materials include 
dolomite + calcite,&lt;ref&gt;Ogasawara, Y., R. Y. Zhang, and J. G. Liou (1998), Petrogenesis of
dolomitic marbles from Rongcheng in the Su-Lu ultrahigh-pressure metamorphic
terrane, eastern China, Island Arc, 7, 82‚Äì 97.&lt;/ref&gt; aragonite + calcite,&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, B.R., S.R. Bohlen, S.H. Kirby, and D.C. Rubie, Calcite --&gt; aragonite transformation in marble: textures and reaction mechanisms of an archetypal polymorphic phase transformation, Journal of Geophysical Research, 110, doi:10.1029/2004JB003302, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and magnetite + clinopyroxene.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, J. R., and A. D. Chambers (2000), Symplectic reaction in olivine and the controls of intergrowth spacing in symplectites, J. Petrol., 41, 285‚Äì304.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Terufumi Sasaki'''|‰Ωê„ÄÖÊú® ËºùÊñá|Sasaki Terufumi|lead=yes}} was a surgeon at the [[Red Cross]] hospital in [[Hiroshima]] in 1945 and was personally situated 1,650 yards from the [[hypocenter]] of the [[Little Boy]] explosion. Twenty five years old that year, out of an initial 30 interviewed,&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yale.edu/2015/08/05/chronicles-disaster-hiroshima-yale-university-library-archives ''Yale News'' Chronicles of disaster: Hiroshima in the Yale University Library archives. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; he became one of the six central [[biopics]] found in the 1946 book ''[[Hiroshima (book)|Hiroshima]]'' by [[John Hersey]]. He lived at his family home in Mukaihara district prior to the detonation and practiced medicine in communities with poor health care without a permit.&lt;ref&gt;Hersey, John (1946, 1985). ''Hiroshima''. New York: Random House. {{ISBN|9780679721031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the detonation occurred, he was one of the first to observe, document and attempt to treat "atomic bomb sickness", now known as [[acute radiation syndrome]]. Terufumi Sasaki led intensive research into the syndrome in the weeks and months post-detonation, leading to the establishment of three recorded stages of the syndrome. Within 25‚Äì30 days of the explosion, Sasaki noticed a sharp drop in white blood cell count and established this drop, along with symptoms of fever, as prognostic standards for Acute Radiation Syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carmichael |first=Ann G. |title=Medicine: A Treasury of Art and Literature |year=1991 |publisher=Harkavy Publishing Service|location=New York|isbn=0883639912 |page=376}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years afterward he would become one of the leading surgeons continuing to document and treat the ''[[Hibakusha]]'' (explosion-affected) community,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Children of the Ashes: The People of Hiroshima, the Story of a Rebirth|first=Robert|last=Jungk|isbn=9780586085028}}&lt;/ref&gt; serving as an important source of knowledge for the [[Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/TheEffectsOfTheAtomicBombOnHiroshima The effects of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan (the secret U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey report 92, Pacific Theatre)]&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[Radiation Effects Research Foundation]], who began and continue the [[Epidemiology data for low-linear energy transfer radiation#Life span studies of atomic bomb survivors|Life Span Study of atomic bomb survivors]], respectively.

'''''The Call of the Man Eater''''' is the fourth book of jungle tales and [[man-eaters]] by [[Kenneth Anderson (writer)|Kenneth Anderson]], first published in 1961 by [[George Allen and Unwin]].

==Author dedication==
Kenneth Anderson gratefully dedicates the book to the memory of his father, the late Douglas Stuart Anderson, Superintendent of Military Accounts in the former British Government of India, "who instilled in me, when very young and n the hard way, a love for the wild places and living creatures of the land, the beauties of the countryside, and a deep appreciation of the marvelous ways of Nature and of God - an example which I have imperfectly striven to emulate by passing on these precepts to my son, Donald".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Kenneth|title=The Call of the Man Eater|year=1961|publisher=George Allen and Unwin|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
'''Introduction'''

Anderson introduces his fourth book by explaining he hopes to do something different, aiming to also capture and portray to the reader's mind the background and setting to his stories as well as the exciting events themselves.

'''The Call of the Man-Eater'''

Anderson heads to a Gunjur bungalow on the trail of a man-eating tiger when the daughter of a hard working caretaker is killed. Anderson sets out to hunt the man-eater hampered by a lack of supplies, a torch with a failing battery and his caretaker friend whose nerves keep getting the better of him. It soon becomes apparent that the tiger is being led to his kills by a lone jackal, which upon seeing the tiger's next victim lets out a cry so that the tiger can locate its next kill. With limited supplies, Anderson and the caretaker improvise a bait to sit over, by making a scarecrow from the caretaker's pillows and clothes.

'''The Evil One of Umbalmeru'''

Local workers start to go missing in the Chamala Valley, plucked from the ground without any drag marks, blood or foot prints during the middle of the afternoon. Locals soon spread word that the Chamala Valley is haunted by an 'Evil One'. Anderson arrives in the valley to unravel this mystery and through some investigations he discovers a very interesting story about a local circus - which leads him to the reason why the man-eater kills during the day, and where it may be found.

'''A Night by the Camp Fire'''

Anderson takes us with him to his solitary jungle retreat, The Secret River at Kundukottai. Whilst describing his night in a jungle camp, he also tells the story of how his family acquired certain jungle pets; Bruno the [[sloth bear]], Jackie the [[striped hyena|hyena]] and Ella the [[golden jackal|jackal]].

'''The Black Rogue of the Moyar Valley'''

Anderson takes an American tourist to the [[Mysore]] area to photograph Indian wildlife, and whilst there they encounter a [[Rogue elephant|rogue]] black elephant which had reportedly killed locals. Anderson and the tourist have a narrow escape with the elephant, and later heads back out to track and kill it. The story ends with the black elephant coming to an unexpected and sad end, which leaves Anderson feeling sympathy for the rogue despite its actions.

'''Jungle Days and Nights'''

Anderson recounts a collection of events from the Indian jungles, some tragic, some humorous. Including; guiding a stubborn senior factory officer out to shoot a crocodile, a friend who refers to a local rogue elephant as his watchdog and problems faced with the local police when Anderson reports a body of murdered woman in the jungle - resulting in the police accusing him of the murder, which later on influenced a much regretted decision in his life.

'''The Creatures of the Jungle'''

Anderson shares his knowledge and experiences about various creatures of the Indian jungle; [[wild dog]], [[wild boar]], [[sloth bear]], [[Indian pangolin|pangolin]], [[striped hyena|hyena]], [[Bengal tiger|tiger]], [[Indian leopard|panther]] and [[Indian elephant|elephant]].

'''The Sulekunta Panther'''

Anderson's shikaris friend, Muniappa (previously in the story of The Maneater of Jowlagiri - [[Nine Maneaters And One Rogue]]) sends many requests for him to come and shoot a cattle lifting tiger, as he will get out of a large local debt if he can provide the skin as settlement. Eventually agreeing to shoot the tiger, Anderson ends up spending the worst night of his life on a badly made machan during a terrible storm. The exposure brings on a bought of malaria, and Anderson does not return to shoot the tiger for another month or so. Upon his return it transpires that in fact the cattle lifter is a panther and not a tiger. Anderson sits up and awaits the panther, and when it arrives and he has a clean shot - he decides at the last minute to let it go.

'''From Mauler to Man-Eater'''

This story follows on from two previously published stories:  The Mauler of Rajnagara ([[Man Eaters and Jungle Killers]]) and  The Maneater of Pegepalyam ([[The Black Panther of Sivanipalli and Other Adventures of the Indian Jungle]]). Previously a tiger in the area of Rajnagara had turned from a mauler to a man-eater, but had a curious habit of never using its teeth and only killing with its claws. Following the previous failed attempts to shoot the tiger, Anderson and his son, Donald kept watch on the newspapers for any further news. When two human kills are reported in Bejahahai, Donald travels there alone to dispatch the killer. At this point Donald takes over the writing of the story and describes his hunt for the man-eater in detail. Donald eventually kills the maneater at its cave up a steep hill. Examining the body he finds that the whole of the tiger's nose had been blown away by a shot gun, disabling it from using its jaws as a weapon.

__NOTOC__
A '''tornado outbreak''' is the occurrence of multiple [[tornado]]es spawned by the same [[Synoptic scale meteorology|synoptic scale]] weather system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Glickman |first = Todd S.

The tornadoes usually occur within the same day, or continue into the early morning hours of the succeeding day, and within the same region. Most definitions allow for a break in tornado activity (time elapsed from the end of last tornado to the beginning of next tornado) of six hours. If tornado activity indeed resumes after such a lull, many definitions consider the event to be a new outbreak. A series of continuous or nearly continuous tornado outbreak days is a [[tornado outbreak sequence]].&lt;ref name="TOS"&gt;{{Cite conference | first = Russell | last = Schneider |author2=H. E.

Tornado outbreaks do occur during other times of the year and in other parts of the world, however. A secondary less active and annually inconsistent tornado "season" in the U.S. occurs in late autumn.&lt;ref name="SLScli"&gt;{{Cite conference | first = Russell | last = Schneider |author2=H. E.

The largest tornado outbreak on record was the [[2011 Super Outbreak]], with 362 tornadoes and about $10 billion in direct damages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/docs/smith-and-matthews-2015.pdf Smith A.B. and J.

Natural Hazards, doi:10.1007/s11069-015-1678-x]&lt;/ref&gt; It surpasses the [[1974 Super Outbreak]], in which 148 tornadoes were counted. Both occurred within the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. The total number of tornadoes is a problematic method of comparing outbreaks from different periods, however, as many more smaller tornadoes, but not stronger tornadoes, are reported in the US in recent decades than in previous ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Doswell |first = Charles A., III |authorlink = Charles A.

A '''trailer skirt''' or '''side skirt''' is a device affixed to the underside of a [[semi-trailer]], for the purpose of reducing [[aerodynamic drag]] caused by air [[turbulence]]. Trailer skirts have been recognized by the U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]]'s [[SmartWay Transport Partnership]] as a verified aerodynamic technology, eligible for funding under the [[Diesel Emissions Reduction Act]].&lt;ref name="epa"&gt;{{cite web | title = Verified Aerodynamic Technologies | work = SmartWay Technology: About the SmartWay Technology Program | publisher = [[Environmental Protection Agency]] | url = http://www.epa.gov/smartway/forpartners/technology.htm | accessdate = September 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
Trailer skirts comprise a pair of panels affixed to the lower side edges of a trailer, running most of the length of the trailer and filling the gap between the forward and rear axles. Trailer skirts are typically constructed of [[aluminum]], [[plastic]], or [[fiberglass]], with plastic the most resistant to damage from side or bottom impacts.&lt;ref name="trucknews"&gt;{{cite news | title = Trailer skirts: A proven fuel-saver | newspaper = trucknews.com | publisher = Business Information Group | date = | url = http://www.trucknews.com/products/trailer-skirts-a-proven-fuel-saver | accessdate = September 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Skirts may have a [[modularity|modular]] design, allowing installation on a variety of trailer lengths.&lt;ref name="truckinginfo"&gt;{{cite web | title = New Aerodynamic Trailer Skirt Technology Introduced | publisher = Trucking Info | date = March 26, 2013 | url = http://www.truckinginfo.com/channel/drivers/product/detail/2013/03/new-aerodynamic-trailer-skirt-technology-introduc.aspx | accessdate = September 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Skirts may weigh between {{convert|70|and|160|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="nrcan"&gt;{{cite web | title = Trailer side skirts | work = On the Road to a fuel-efficient truck: A Guide for Purchasing Aerodynamics for Heavy-Duty Tractors and Trailers | publisher = [[Natural Resources Canada]] | date = September 2009 | url = http://fleetsmart.nrcan.gc.ca/index.cfm?fuseaction=rfet.5 | accessdate = September 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Installation typically requires three to five {{dfn|person-hours|the amount of work performed by the average worker in one hour}}.&lt;ref name="nrcan"/&gt;

==Cost==
{{As of|2009}}, a set of trailer skirts cost between [[Canadian dollar|C$]]1500 and C$3000 ([[United States dollar|US$]]1300 to $2700).&lt;ref name="nrcan"/&gt; Standard trailer skirts have an estimated [[payback period]] of ten to eighteen months, while "advanced" skirts (those that improve fuel efficiency by over 7%) are estimated to pay for themselves in seven to fourteen months.&lt;ref name="nrcan"/&gt;

==Performance==
A 2012 investigation by [[SAE International]] of nine trailer skirt designs found that three provided [[fuel efficiency|fuel savings]] greater than 5%, and four provided savings between 4% and 5%, compared with an unmodified trailer.&lt;ref name="sae"&gt;{{cite web | last = Wood | first = Richard | title = EPA Smartway Verification of Trailer Undercarriage Advanced Aerodynamic Drag Reduction Technology | publisher = [[SAE International]] | date = September 24, 2012 | url = http://papers.sae.org/2012-01-2043/ | accessdate = September 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Skirts with reduced ground clearance offer greater fuel savings; in one instance, reducing ground clearance from {{convert|16|in|cm|abbr=on}} to {{convert|8|in|cm|abbr=on}} resulted in an improvement in fuel savings from 4% to 7%.&lt;ref name="trucknews"/&gt; One 2008 [[Delft University of Technology]] study found fuel savings of up to 15% for the particular design studied.&lt;ref name=delft&gt;{{cite web | others = [[Delft University of Technology]] | title = Aerodynamic Truck Trailer Cuts Fuel And Emissions By Up To 15 Percent | publisher = [[Science Daily]] | date = April 22, 2008 | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080417105446.htm | accessdate = September 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sean Graham, president of a major supplier of trailer skirts, estimates that in typical use, drivers see fuel savings of 5% to 6%.&lt;ref name="trucknews"/&gt;

Trailers with skirts fitted have also demonstrated reduced [[tire spray]], and drivers have reported improved stability in [[crosswind]]s.&lt;ref name="nrcan"/&gt;

==Adoption==
As of 2018 over 60% of new trailers produced in Australia are equipped with skirts, whereas the figure is over 50% for the North American market.

A 2014 study by the [[North American Council for Freight Efficiency]] on adoption of fuel efficient technologies and practices found trailer skirts to be the most widely adopted technology of those studied, having been adopted by seven of the ten major shipping fleets in the study.&lt;ref name="ccj"&gt;{{cite web | last = Dunn | first = Jill | title = Study: Fuel efficiency efforts pay off for carriers | work = Commercial Carrier Journal ‚Äì Fleet Management Magazine | publisher = Randall-Reilly | date = September 8, 2014 | url = http://www.ccjdigital.com/study-fuel-efficiency-efforts-pay-off-for-carriers/ | accessdate = September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the wide adoption of trailer skirts, the incidences of them becoming detached and hurting other drivers on the road have increased. On October 18th, 2018 in one particular case, a trailer skirt came off of an east bound tractor trailer and ended up in the west bound lanes where it hit a car and killed it's driver Mark Elliot, 71, of St. Louis, Missouri while he was traveling through [[Knoxville, Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wbir.com/article/news/local/kpd-names-driver-killed-by-flying-metal-piece-from-tractor-trailer/51-606500165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.trucks.com/2018/08/29/fleets-adopt-trailer-fuel-efficiency-tech/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Yakisugi''''' ([[wikt:ÁÑº|ÁÑº]][[wikt:Êùâ|Êùâ]]) is a traditional [[Japanese aesthetics|Japanese]] method of [[wood preservation]]. ''Yaki''  means to heat with fire, and ''sugi''  is  [[Cryptomeria japonica|cypress]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/19/t-magazine/shou-sugi-ban.html The Latest Design Trend: Black and Burned Wood] AMANDA FORTINI, [[New York Times]], September 19, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also referred to in the West as ''sh≈ç sugi ban'' (ÁÑºÊùâÊùø),&lt;ref&gt;[http://shousugiban.co.uk/ shousugiban.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; which uses the same ''[[kanji]]'' characters but [[Kunyomi|a different pronunciation]]. The ''ban'' character means "[[plank (wood)|plank]]".

By slightly [[charring]] the surface of the wood without combusting the whole piece, the wood becomes water-proof through the carbonisation and is thus more durable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://charredwood.com/traditional-japanese-burnt-wood-shou-sugi-ban-yakisugi/ charredwood.com]&lt;/ref&gt; It also protects against insects.

'''''The Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle Under the Command of Captain Fitzroy, R.N., during the Years 1832 to 1836''''' is a 5-part book published unbound in nineteen numbers as they were ready, between February 1838 and October 1843.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Various | year=1840‚Äì1843 | title=The Zoology of the voyage of H.M.S. Beagle | publisher= Elder Smith, London | url=http://library.sl.nsw.gov.au/record=b2193567~S2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was written by various authors, and edited and superintended by [[Charles Darwin]], publishing expert descriptions of the collections he had made during the [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|''Beagle'' voyage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Dictionary of Australian Biography |First=Charles|Last=Darwin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Part 1. Fossil Mammalia'' (1838 ‚Äì 1840), by [[Richard Owen]] (''Preface'' and ''Geological introduction'' by Darwin)
* ''Part 2. Mammalia'' (1838 ‚Äì 1839), by [[George Robert Waterhouse|George R. Waterhouse]] (''Geographical introduction'' and ''A notice of their habits and ranges'' by Darwin)

Darwin also contributed notices of habits and ranges throughout the text of Mammalia and Birds, and the text of the Fish and the Reptiles included numerous notes by him that were mostly taken from his labels. The authors of these parts were as follows:

* ''Part 3. Birds'' (1838 ‚Äì 1841), by [[John Gould]]
* ''Part 4. Fish'' (1840 ‚Äì 1842), by [[Leonard Blomefield|Leonard Jenyns]]
* ''Part 5. Reptiles'' (1842 ‚Äì 1843), by [[Thomas Bell (zoologist)|Thomas Bell]]

For a small additional fee the publishers sold the completed work bound, in five volumes, and later bound in three volumes, the first incorporating Parts 1 &amp; 2, the second Part 3 and the third Parts 4 &amp; 5. An example of this arrangement can be seen in the catalogue entry for the copies held at the State Library of New South Wales. The copies published by Elder Smith, 1840-1843 has the five volumes bound into three with some plates folded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Various | year=1840‚Äì1843 | title=The Zoology of the voyage of H.M.S.
