In [[Thelemic mysticism]], the '''Abyss''' is the great gulf or void between the [[Phenomenon|phenomenal world]] of [[wikt:Special:Search/manifestation|manifestation]] and its [[noumenon|noumenal]] source.

==Theory and practice==
The founder of Thelema, author [[Aleister Crowley]], says of the Abyss in his ''[[Little Essays Toward Truth]]'':
{{quote|"This doctrine is extremely difficult to explain; but it corresponds more or less to the gap in thought between the Real, which is ideal, and the Unreal, which is actual. In the Abyss all things exist, indeed, at least in posse, but are without any possible meaning; for they lack the substratum of spiritual Reality. They are appearances without Law. They are thus Insane Delusions.

Now the Abyss being thus the great storehouse of Phenomena, it is the source of all impressions."&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Aleister. ''Little Essays Toward Truth.''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On a practical level, Crowley's published instructions on the Abyss tell the reader to consider some philosophical problem without using magic or intuition, until the mind focuses on this problem of its own accord: "Then will all phenomena which present themselves to him appear meaningless and disconnected, and his own Ego will break up into a series of impressions having no relation one with the other, or with any other thing." This prepares the student for the mystical experience that Crowley elsewhere calls Shivadarshana.&lt;ref&gt;''Liber OS Abysmi vel Daath'' pamphlet, available online at [http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/libers/lib474.html Hermetic.com]. Retrieved Dec. 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Crowley modeled these instructions on his own experiences in the year 1905.&lt;ref&gt;''Confessions'', Chapter 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sutin, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Vision and the Voice]] describes two additional methods of entering the Abyss. The first of these "concerns things of which it (was) unlawful to speak openly under penalty of the most dreadful punishment,"&lt;ref&gt;''Confessions'' Chapter 66&lt;/ref&gt; namely receptive homosexual intercourse under the desert sun that went against Crowley's social habits of conduct or his conscious self-image.&lt;ref&gt;Sutin, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; The second involves ceremonial magic and focuses more on the theory behind the Abyss.

In the [[Qabalah|Qabalistic]] system of Crowley, the Abyss contains the 11th (hidden) [[sephira]], [[Da'ath]], which separates the lower sephiroth from the supernals. This account derives from the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]'s view of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]],&lt;ref&gt;"See 4=7 ritual" for Da'ath as "the Eighth Head of the Stooping Dragon". Crowley, ''777 and other qabalistic writings of Aleister Crowley'' p. 35. Also references [[The Vision and the Voice]].&lt;/ref&gt; in which Da'ath represents the [[fall of man]] from a unified consciousness into a duality between ego and divine nature.&lt;ref&gt;Separates us from the divine "Supernals". Regardie, Israel. ''The Golden Dawn'' p. 193-194.&lt;/ref&gt; The Abyss is guarded by the demon [[Choronzon]], who manifests during the third, ceremonial method of crossing this gulf. He represents those parts of one's consciousness and unconsciousness -- "a momentary unity capable of sensation and of expression," in Crowley's terms&lt;ref&gt;[[The Vision and the Voice]], Tenth Aethyr, fn 13.&lt;/ref&gt; -- that are unwilling or unable to enter the Divine. According to [[Grant Morrison]] in the [[Richard Metzger]] ''Book of Lies'', at least, Choronzon 
&lt;blockquote&gt;is Existential Self at the last gasp...Beyond Choronzon we are no longer our Self. The "personality" on the brink of the Abyss will do anything, say anything and find any excuse to avoid taking this disintegrating step into "non-being."&lt;ref&gt;Metzger 2003, p. 24. [https://books.google.com/books?id=W6IycFk3VZ0C&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24 Google Books preview].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Crossing the Abyss" is regarded as a perilous operation, and the most important work of the magician's career. Success confers graduation into the degree of [[A∴A∴|Magister Templi]], or "Master of the Temple."

==''The Book of Lie''s==
Crowley specifically wrote his 1913 volume, ''[[The Book of Lies (Crowley)|The Book of Lies]]'', for what he called the "Babes of the Abyss" (writing at the start of the book, "It is an official publication for Babes of the Abyss").

In the [[religion]] and [[mythology]] of [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Bolivia]], '''apus''' are the [[spirit]]s of the [[mountain]]s - and sometimes solitary rocks and caves, that protect the local people in the highlands. The term dates back to the [[Inca Empire]].

==Meanings of Apu==
The word "Apu" has several possible meanings, depending on context.

Apu (A-pu) means “Lord” in Qechua. The Inka religion uses the term Apu to refer to a mountain that has a spirit that is alive. Body and energy bubble of the mountain together form his wasi (Qechua for "home" or "temple"). &lt;ref name="Inkaworld"&gt;http://www.inka-world.com/en/apu.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayllu Apu – protector of a village (like Apu Manuel Pinta)&lt;ref name="Inkaworld"&gt;http://www.inka-world.com/en/apu.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Llaqta Apu – protector of a region (Apu Mama Simona)&lt;ref name="Inkaworld"&gt;http://www.inka-world.com/en/apu.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Suyu Apu – protector of a country (like Apu Salkantay or Apu Ausangate)&lt;ref name="Inkaworld"&gt;http://www.inka-world.com/en/apu.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides mountains there are other living beings that are considered as Apus - the so-called Tekse Apus. In the Andean tradition Pachamama (Cosmic Mother), Wiraqocha (God or Cosmic Father), Father Sun (Taita Inti), Father Wind (Taita Waira), Mother Water (Mama Unu), Mother Moon (Mama Killa) and Mother Stars (Mama Ch'aska) can be seen all over the world, that is why they are called Tekse Apus, which means Global Apus. Jesus Christ and Mother Mary for the same reason are also called Tekse Apus.&lt;ref name="Inkaworld"&gt;http://www.inka-world.com/en/apu.html&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==In Fictional Literature==
According to one science-fiction novel, the natives know of extraterrestrials that claim to come from the planet Apu. Apparently they wish to keep this a secret, but the Apunians wish humanity to know all about them what this implies. An extract from this book, written by Vlado Kapetanovic;

"The stranger was silent for a moment, and then smiled at me and said: “We come from a planet we call APU, located outside the Milky Way Galaxy. We are protectors of the cells and the life. For this we are traveling through space to aid by different modes the planetary beings, but not to impress with the result that you believe in our existence and ‘extraordinary powers’”
&lt;ref name= "Vlado1960"&gt;Stevens, Wendelle;  (2012-12-30). UFO CONTACT FROM PLANET APU Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Apus==
The twelve sacred apus of [[Cusco]] are: [[Ausangate]], [[Salkantay]], [[Mama Simona]], [[Pillku Urqu]], [[Manuel Pinta]], [[Wanakawri, Cusco|Wanakawri]], [[Pachatusan]], [[Pikchu]], [[Saksaywaman]], [[Viraqochan]], [[Pukin]], and [[Sinqa]].

Other Apus in Bolivia and Peru are: [[Akamari]], [[Antikuna]], [[Chachani]], [[Kimsa Chata (La Paz)|Kimsa Chata]], [[Illampu]], [[Lady of Illimani]], [[Machu Picchu]], [[Pitusiray]], [[Putucusi|Phutuq K'usi]], [[Qullqipunku]], [[Sinaqara]], [[Tunupa]], [[Willka Wiqi]] (Wakay Willka), [[Wamanrasu]], [[Wayna Picchu|Wayna Pikchu]] and [[Yanantin]].

In [[Ayyavazhi mythology]], '''Bhima Citar''' was one of the [[Citars|five disciples]] of [[Ayya Vaikundar]]. His native place is [[Karumbattoor]], a small village in the district of [[Kanyakumari district|Kanyakumari]]. He was Bhima, the most courageous among the [[Pandavas]] in the previous [[Dwapara Yukam]], and was transmigrated and given birth in this [[Kali Yukam]] as Bhima Citar. In human history he was known as '''Pantaram''' (his name).

In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], a '''Bidental''' was a sacred spot erected on the location where [[lightning]] had struck. Any remains and scorched earth were to be burned in a hole at the location by priests called '''''bidentales'''''. Any person killed was to be buried in the earth where the lightning hit, as opposed to traditional cremation. A [[Puteal]], or sometimes plural, was then placed on the spot of burned earth. In order to further consecrate the spot, the head officiator would sacrifice a two-year-old sheep—bidens—. Finally, an altar was built, surrounded by a wall or fence to keep any trespassers away.  Considered sacred, it was not to be touched, tread on, or even looked at after completion. Occasionally when falling into a state of decay, Bidentals would be repaired or reconstructed.

Places being struck by lightning were regarded as a terrifying example of godly wrath, and not to be taken lightly. Had any person committed sacrilege, they were punished severely with frenzy. Primarily it was believed that these shows of divine power were displayed specifically by [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], King of the gods.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1591">In contrast to a usual [[chaplain]] (a priest serving a specific group of people), a '''bishop's chaplain''' or '''archbishop's chaplain''' is chaplain to a [[bishop]] only.  The office exists in the [[Anglican]] churches and the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

A bishop's chaplain also acts as his or her [[private secretary]], attends and assists the [[bishop]] at all services where the [[bishop]] wears his or her mitre and carries his or her crozier, acts as proxy on some bodies and generally ministers to and prays for him or her.

[[File:Talis02.png|frame|This design for an [[amulet]] comes from the ''Black Pullet'' grimoire. Embroider it upon [[black]] [[satin]], and say "Nades, Suradis, Maniner", and a [[djinn]] is supposed to appear; tell the djinn "Sader, Prostas, Solaster", and the djinn will bring you your true love. Say "Mammes, Laher" when you tire of her.]]
The '''''Black Pullet''''' (original French: La poule noire) also known in French as “la poule aux œufs d’or” (the hen that lays golden eggs) is a [[grimoire]] that proposes to teach the "science of magical [[amulet|talismans]] and rings", including the art of [[necromancy]] and [[Kabbalah]]. It is believed to have been written in the 18th century&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; by an anonymous [[France|French]] officer who served in [[Napoleon]]'s army. The text takes the form of a narrative centering on the French officer during the [[Egypt]]ian expedition led by Napoleon (referred to here as the "genius") when his unit is suddenly attacked by [[Arab]] soldiers ([[Bedouins]]). The French officer manages to escape the attack, but is the only survivor. An old [[Turkey|Turkish]] man appears suddenly from the [[pyramids]] and takes the French officer into a secret apartment within one of the pyramids. He nurses him back to health whilst sharing with him the magical teachings from ancient manuscripts that escaped the "burning of [[Ptolemy]]'s library".

The book itself contains information regarding the creation of certain magical properties, such as talismanic rings, amulets and the Black Pullet itself. The book also teaches the reader how to master the extraordinary powers from these magical properties. Perhaps the most interesting magical property claimed in the book is the power to produce the Black Pullet, otherwise known as the [[Hen that lays Golden Eggs]]. The grimoire claims that the person who understands and attains the power to instruct the Black Pullet will gain unlimited wealth. The notion of such a lucrative possession has been reflected throughout history in [[fable]]s, [[fairy tale]]s and [[folklore]].

This text has often been associated to two other texts, known as the ''Red Dragon'' (or ''[[The Grand Grimoire]]'') and the ''Black Screech Owl''.  The latter is also confusingly known as ''The Black Pullet'' or ''Treasure of the Old Man of the Pyramids'', and is in fact an alternate printing of the original ''Black Pullet'' with only slight changes. All three grimoires claim to possess the science of ancient magic.

[[beatification|Blessed]] '''Ceferino Namuncurá''' (August 26, 1886 - May 11, 1905) was a religious student, the object of a [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] ''cultus'' of veneration in northern [[Patagonia]] and throughout [[Argentina]].

== Early life ==
He was born at Chimpay, a small town in [[Río Negro (Argentina)#Valle Medio|Valle Medio]], [[Río Negro Province]], [[Argentina]],&lt;ref name=sdb&gt;[http://www.sdb.org/en/Salesian_Saints/Blesseds/Ceferino_Namuncura "Blessed Ceferino Namuncura", Salesians of Don Bosco] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228202725/http://www.sdb.org/en/Salesian_Saints/Blesseds/Ceferino_Namuncura |date=2013-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the sixth child of Rosario Burgos and a [[Mapuche]] ''[[cacique]]'', Manuel Namuncurá. At the age of eight, he was [[baptism|baptized]] by a [[Salesian]] missionary priest, Domingo Milanesio.&lt;ref name=va&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_20071111_zefferino_en.html "Bl. Zepherin Namuncurá (1886-1905)", Vatican News Service]&lt;/ref&gt; Namuncurá's early years were spent by the [[Río Negro (Argentina)|Río Negro river]], and it was here that he, according to legend, miraculously survived a fall into the river.

His father Manuel, Chief of the Mapuches, promoted to honorary colonel in the Argentine army, decided that his son study in Buenos Aires, in order to prepare himself "to be useful to his people."&lt;ref name=sdb/&gt; Thanks to the friendship of Manuel with General Luís María Campos, Minister of War and the Navy of [[Argentina]], the boy came to study in the National Workshops of the Navy as a carpenter's apprentice. There he would remain for three months. Being the only native Indian in the school  Ceferino found himself mistreated by the other students and he soon fell ill. He wrote to his father that he was not happy in that place and Manuel then asked former Argentine president [[Luis Sáenz Peña]]'s advice. He recommended to Colonel Manuel Namuncurá that he send the boy to the [[Salesians of Don Bosco]].&lt;ref name=va/&gt;

==Education==
On September 20, 1897, Ceferino went to study with the Salesians at the Colegio Pío IX, a technical academy in [[Almagro, Buenos Aires|Almagro]], [[Buenos Aires]].
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casapioix.org.ar/ Pio IX School]&lt;/ref&gt; There he showed himself to be an excellent student and choral musician. He enjoyed his studies, and sports and was known to due card tricks for his classmates or teach them archery.&lt;ref name=va/&gt; From April 2, 1901, [[Carlos Gardel]], afterwards a legendary [[tango music|tango]] singer and film actor, became a student at the academy and sang along with Ceferino in the chorus.

When he finished his studies, Manuel his father wanted him back home, to serve as interpreter and secretary, but Ceferino was already enthusiastic about becoming a Salesian priest.

== In Italy ==
Although his health was already generally frail, Ceferino began studying for the priesthood.&lt;ref name=sdb/&gt; In 1904, he departed for [[Italy]] accompanying Mgr. Giovanni Cagliero, a former disciple of [[Don Bosco]] who was to become an [[Archbishop]]. [[Pope Pius X]] received them in September, after which Namuncurá moved to [[Turin]] and later to the Salesian College "[[Villa Sora]]" in [[Frascati]], to continue his education. He became increasingly ill during the Italian winter and was taken to Rome, where he finally succumbed to [[pulmonary tuberculosis]] on May 11, 1905, at the [[Fatebenefratelli Hospital|''Fate bene fratelli'' hospital]].

== Back to Argentina ==
In 1924 his remains were returned to Argentina and placed in the chapel at Fortín Mercedes, in the southern part of [[Buenos Aires Province]]. In 1945, a request for his beatification was forwarded to the [[Holy See]].&lt;ref name=Patagonia&gt;[https://www.patagonia.com.ar/Chimpay/405E_Ceferino+Namuncur%E1%3A+the+saint+of+Patagonia.html "Ceferino Namuncurá: the saint of Patagonia", Patagonia.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Between May 13 and July 10, 1947, the Church officially started the process for Canonization of Ceferino Namuncurá, with 21 then-living witnesses deposing evidence in favour of his virtues. 

At his birthplace of Chimpay a small chapel was erected, where believers from Río Negro Province and beyond began to pray for his [[intercessory prayer|intercession]]. 

On June 22, 1972, [[Pope Paul VI]] promulgated the Decree of Heroism of His Virtues and Ceferino was thus proclaimed ''[[venerable]]'', becoming the first Catholic Argentine to receive that title and the first South American aborigine.

The devotion to Ceferino Namuncurá, the saintly young Mapuche, known popularly as ''The Lily of Patagonia'' ("El lirio de la Patagonia") became very extensive in [[Buenos Aires]] and throughout [[Argentina]]. In particular the indigenous people recognise him as one of their own. The affection of the people of Argentina for this selfless young man is quite touchingly sincere and images and representations of his  face are myriad. In 1991 his relics were translated from the small sanctuary chapel to the roomier Sanctuary of Mary, Help of Christians, at the same town of Fortín Mercedes.

== Blessed ==
In 2000 a committee of Vatican pathologists declared that the healing of the uterine cancer of a young mother, Valeria Herrera from [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], [[Argentina]], could not be explained medically, with which it was left to Church authorities to decree that it was a miracle due to the intercession of Ceferino Namuncurá. This opened the way for the beatification of Ceferino.

Pope [[Benedict XVI]] finally decreed his beatification on 6 July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Clarín, 6 July 2007. [http://www.clarin.com/diario/2007/07/06/um/m-01451988.htm ''El Papa declaró beato a Ceferino Namuncurá''].&lt;/ref&gt;  The ceremony of beatification was held in Chimpay, Argentina, on November 11, 2007. It was one of the few beatification ceremonies held outside the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] and in the blessed's own land; it was the first beatification of a South American aborigine. Blessed Ceferino was beatified by Cardinal [[Tarcisio Bertone]], a Salesian of Don Bosco and Vatican Secretary of State. The ceremony was attended by more than ten thousand people with the active participation of Mapuche delegations.

Ceferino's liturgical calendar memorial as a Catholic ''beatus'' was established on August 26.

== Legacy of Ceferino ==
Ceferino Namuncurá's first legacy is to his own nation and people: Argentina and the Mapuche people. There are many books and videos on the life of the young holy man, most of them in Spanish. The meaning of Ceferino is also important to the Mapuche and all South American ancestral peoples. [[Manuel Gálvez]], the prominent Argentine novelist and biographer, wrote a biography of Ceferino Namuncurá in 1947: ''El Santito de la Toldería. La vida perfecta de Ceferino Namuncurá''.

Ceferino Namuncura Park, along the Negro River, in Chimpay is named in his honor.&lt;ref name=Patagonia/&gt;

==''Zephyrin: The Musicale''==
''Zephyrin: The Musicale'' is a musical play in honor of Blessed Ceferino Namuncurá. It was shown on March 14, 15 and 16, 2008 at SM Cinema One in [[Cebu City|Cebu]], Philippines. It was written by Jude Thaddeus Gitamondoc and directed by Daisy Brilliantes Ba-ad with the help of Don Bosco Technology Center Productions.The musical was a Salesian Production made in honor of the beatification of Ceferino. The musical featured amateur actors, mostly coming from high school and elementary school. The story begin when Ceferino is only a child and ends after his death.

He directed the US government Science and Technology Advisory Committee for the Apollo lunar landing program. After becoming a professor of the University of California at Berkeley in 1967, he began an astrophysical program that produced several important discoveries, for example, the [[black hole]] at the center of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy.

Townes was religious&lt;ref&gt;http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt3199n627;NAAN=13030&amp;doc.view=frames&amp;chunk.id=d0e1739&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=d0e1210&amp;brand=calisphere&lt;/ref&gt; and believed that science and religion are converging to provide a greater understanding of the nature and purpose of the universe.

==Early life==
Townes was born in Greenville, South Carolina, the son of Henry Keith Townes (1876–1958), an attorney, and Ellen Sumter Townes (née Hard; 1881–1980).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indigobluesc.com/2010/10/09/notable-south-carolinians-dr-charles-hard-townes/ |title=Notable South Carolinians- Dr. Charles Hard Townes &amp;#124; Indigo Blue |publisher=Indigobluesc.com |date=1915-07-28 |accessdate=2013-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023063219/http://indigobluesc.com/2010/10/09/notable-south-carolinians-dr-charles-hard-townes/ |archivedate=2013-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned his B.S. in Physics and B.A. in Modern Languages at [[Furman University]], where he graduated in 1935.&lt;ref name="nobel"/&gt; Townes completed work for the [[Master of Arts]] degree in physics at [[Duke University]] during 1937,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Townes|url=https://www.aip.org/history/acap/biographies/bio.jsp?townesc|publisher=The Array of Contemporary American Physicists|accessdate=30 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160223153726/https://www.aip.org/history/acap/biographies/bio.jsp?townesc|archivedate=23 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then began graduate school at the [[California Institute of Technology]], from which he received a Ph.D. degree in 1939.&lt;ref name=phd&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Townes |first=Charles |title=Concentration of the heavy isotope of carbon and measurement of its nuclear spin |year=1939 |url=http://thesis.library.caltech.edu/4202/|publisher=Caltech|degree=PhD}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], he worked on radar bombing systems at [[Bell Labs]].&lt;ref name=nature/&gt;&lt;ref name="nobel"/&gt;

==Career and research==
[[File:Charles Townes Nobel.jpg|thumb|right|Charles Hard Townes]]
In 1950, Townes was appointed Professor at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name="nobel" /&gt; He served as Executive Director of the Columbia Radiation Laboratory from 1950 to 1952. He was Chairman of the Physics Department from 1952 to 1955.&lt;ref name="nobel" /&gt;

In 1951, Townes conceived a new way to create intense, precise beams of [[coherent radiation]], for which he invented the acronym ''maser'' (for Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation). When the same principle was applied to higher frequencies, the term ''laser'' was used (the word "light" substituting for the word "microwave").&lt;ref&gt;author=Charles Townes|title="How the lazer Happened"|accessdate=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1953, Townes, [[James P. Gordon]], and H. J. Zeiger built the first ammonia maser at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name="nobel" /&gt; This device used stimulated emission in a stream of energized [[ammonia]] molecules to produce amplification of microwaves at a frequency of about 24.0&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz#SI multiples|gigahertz]].&lt;ref name="nobel" /&gt;

From 1959 to 1961, he was on leave of absence from Columbia University to serve as Vice President and Director of Research of the Institute for Defense Analyses in Washington, D.C., a nonprofit organization, which advised the U.S. government and was operated by eleven universities.&lt;ref name="nobel" /&gt;  Between 1961 and 1967, Townes served as both Provost and Professor of Physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&lt;ref name="nobel" /&gt;  Then, during 1967, he was appointed as a Professor of Physics at the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]], where he remained for almost 50 years; his status was as professor emeritus by the time of his death during 2015.&lt;ref name="nobel" /&gt;  Between 1966 and 1970, he was chairman of the [[NASA]] Science Advisory Committee for the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] lunar landing program.

For his creation of the maser, Townes along with [[Nikolay Basov]] and [[Alexander Prokhorov]] received the 1964 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]].&lt;ref name="nobel" /&gt;  Townes also developed the use of masers and lasers for [[astronomy]], was part of a team that first discovered complex molecules in space, and determined the mass of the [[supermassive black hole]] at the centre of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Guardian|title=Laser inventor Charles Townes dies|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jan/29/laser-inventor-charles-townes-dies|date=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.13.479| title = Self-Trapping of Optical Beams| journal = Physical Review Letters| volume = 13| issue = 15| pages = 479–482| year = 1964| last1 = Chiao | first1 = R.| last2 = Garmire | first2 = E.| last3 = Townes | first3 = C.|bibcode = 1964PhRvL..13..479C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.112.1940| title = Infrared and Optical Masers| journal = Physical Review| volume = 112| issue = 6| pages = 1940–1949| year = 1958| last1 = Schawlow | first1 = A.| last2 = Townes | first2 = C.|bibcode = 1958PhRv..112.1940S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.100.703| title = Stark Effect in Rapidly Varying Fields| journal = Physical Review| volume = 100| issue = 2| pages = 703–722| year = 1955| last1 = Autler | first1 = S.| last2 = Townes | first2 = C.|bibcode = 1955PhRv..100..703A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1086/116960| title = Characteristics of dust shells around 13 late-type stars| journal = The Astronomical Journal| volume = 107| pages = 1469| year = 1994| last1 = Danchi | first1 = W.

Refer to other aspects of his life too.]

===Molecular astronomy===

When Townes failed to be promoted to President of MIT during 1967, he accepted an offer from Clark Kerr to join the University of California at Berkeley and begin an astrophysical program. Townes soon began searching for molecules in space. At the time most astronomers thought that molecules could not exist in space because ultraviolet rays would destroy them. Townes eventually discovered [[ammonia]] and water in dust clouds, which shielded them from damaging rays, by essentially doing microwave spectroscopy on the sky. This created the topic of molecular/millimeter astronomy, which continues to find many complex molecules, some the precursors to life.

===Galactic center===

The center of the Milky Way had long puzzled astronomers, and thick dust obscures the view of it in visible light. During the mid to late 1970s, Townes together with Eric Wollman, John Lacy, Thomas Geballe and Fred Baas studied [[Sagittarius A]], the [[H II region]] at the galactic center, at infrared wavelengths. They observed ionized [[neon]] gas swirling around the center at such velocities that the mass at the very center must be approximately equal to that of 3 million suns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Genzel|first=R|last2=Hollenbach|first2=D|last3=Townes|first3=C H|date=1994-05-01|title=The nucleus of our Galaxy|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0034-4885/57/5/001|journal=Reports on Progress in Physics|volume=57|issue=5|pages=417–479|doi=10.1088/0034-4885/57/5/001|issn=0034-4885|bibcode=1994RPPh...57..417G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a large mass in such a small space implied that the central object (the radio source [[Sagittarius A*]]) contains a supermassive [[black hole]]. Sagittarius A* was one of the first black holes detected; its mass has been more accurately determined to be 4.3 million solar masses.

===Shapes and sizes of stars===

Townes' last major technological creation was the Infrared Spatial Interferometer with Walt Fitelson, Ed Wishnow and others. The project combined three mobile infrared detectors aligned by lasers that study the same star. If each telescope is 10 meters from the other, it creates an impression of a 30-meter lens. Observations of [[Betelgeuse]], a red giant in the shoulder of the constellation [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], found that it is increasing and decreasing in size at the rate of 1% per year, 15% over 15 years. ISI produces extremely high angular and spatial resolution. The technology is also playing an important role in the search for extraterrestrial life in collaborations with [[Dan Werthimer]] of [[SETI]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Personal life and legacy==
Townes married Frances H. Brown, an activist for the homeless,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://youthspiritartworks.org/2016/01/16/celebrating-the-100th-birthday-of-frances-h-townes/|title=Celebrating the 100th Birthday of Frances H. Townes|last=admin|website=Youth Spirit Artworks|access-date=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; during 1941. They lived in [[Berkeley, California]] and had four daughters, Linda Rosenwein, Ellen Anderson, Carla Kessler, and Holly Townes.&lt;ref name="nobel" /&gt;

A religious man and a member of the [[United Church of Christ]], Townes believed that "science and religion [are] quite parallel, much more similar than most people think and that in the long run, they must converge".&lt;ref&gt;[[Harvard Gazette]] June 16, 2005 [http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2005/06.16/05-laser.html Laser's inventor predicts meeting of science, religion]&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote in a statement after winning the Templeton Prize during 2005: "Science tries to understand what our universe is like and how it works, including us humans. Religion is aimed at understanding the purpose and meaning of our universe, including our own lives. If the universe has a purpose or meaning, this must be reflected in its structure and functioning, and hence in science."&lt;ref name=bloomberg&gt;{{cite web|last1=Henry|first1=David|title=Pioneer of James Bond's Laser, Dies at 99|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-28/charles-townes-nobel-pioneer-of-james-bond-s-laser-dies-at-99|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=2015-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Townes died at the age of 99 in [[Oakland, California]], on January 27, 2015.&lt;ref name=nature/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/29/us/charles-h-townes-physicist-who-helped-develop-lasers-dies-at-99.html?_r=0 | title=Charles H. Townes Dies at 99; He Envisioned the Laser, Bringing It Into Daily Life | date=2015-01-29 | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | accessdate=2015-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "He was one of the most important experimental physicists of the last century," Reinhard Genzel, a professor of physics at Berkeley, said of Townes. "His strength was his curiosity and his unshakable optimism, based on his deep Christian spirituality."&lt;ref name="bloomberg" /&gt;

===Science and religion===

Townes' opinions concerning science and religion were expounded in his essays "The Convergence of Science and Religion", "Logic and Uncertainties in Science and Religion", and his book ''Making Waves''. Townes felt that the beauty of nature is "obviously God-made" and that God created the universe for humans to emerge and flourish. He prayed every day and ultimately felt that religion is more important than science because it addresses the most important long-range question: the meaning and purpose of our lives. Townes' belief in the convergence of science and religion is based on claimed similarities:
# Faith. Townes argued that the scientist has faith much like a religious person does, allowing him/her to work for years for an uncertain result.
# Revelation. Townes claimed that many important scientific discoveries, like his invention of the maser/laser, occurred as a "flash" much more akin to religious revelation than interpreting data.
# Proof. During this century the mathematician Godel discovered there can be no absolute proof in a scientific sense. Every proof requires a set of assumptions, and there is no way to check if those assumptions are self-consistent because other assumptions would be required.
# Uncertainty. Townes believed that we should be open-minded to a better understanding of science and religion in the future. This will require us to modify our theories, but not abandon them. For example, at the start of the 20th century physics was largely deterministic. But when scientists began studying the quantum mechanics they realized that indeterminism and chance play a role in our universe. Both classical physics and quantum mechanics are correct and work well within their own bailiwick, and continue to be taught to students. Similarly, Townes believes growth of religious understanding will modify, but not make us abandon, our classic religious beliefs.

'''Charles Pierre Péguy''' ({{IPA-fr|ʃaʁl peɡi|lang}}; 7 January 1873 – 5 September 1914) was a noted French poet, essayist, and editor. His two main philosophies were socialism and nationalism, but by 1908 at the latest, after years of uneasy agnosticism, he had become a believing but non-practicing [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref&gt;"Peguy's Catholicism was closely allied with his love of France. Of him, as also of Psichari, it might almost be said that they were Catholics because they were Frenchmen. A non-Catholic Frenchman seemed a monstrosity, something cut off from the true life of his country. Some Catholicism is international or indifferent to country, with almost the motto, 'What matters country so long as the Church survives?' But that is not the Catholicism of these young Frenchmen, nor the Catholicism of the recent religious revival." – Rawlinson, Gerald Christopher (1917). [https://archive.org/stream/recentfrenchtend11rawl#page/118/mode/2up "Charles Péguy,"] in ''Recent French Tendencies from Renan to Claudel''. London: Robert Scott, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In France the classic type of the fervent but non-practising Catholic was probably best represented by Charles Péguy". — Kuehnelt-Leddihn, Erik von (1952). [https://mises.org/books/liberty.pdf ''Liberty or Equality'']. Caldwell, Idaho: The Caxton Printers, Ltd., p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ralph McInerny. [http://www.nd.edu/~ndethics/inspires/documents/Charles_Peguy.pdf "Charles Péguy"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530164242/http://www.nd.edu/~ndethics/inspires/documents/Charles_Peguy.pdf |date=30 May 2010 }}, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
From that time, Catholicism strongly influenced his works.

==Biography==
Péguy was born to poverty in [[Orléans]].&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, Catriona (1937). "Charles Péguy (1873–1914)," ''The Irish Monthly'', Vol. 65, No. 770, pp. 529–541.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother Cécile, widowed when he was an infant, mended chairs for a living. His father Désiré Péguy was a cabinet maker, who died in 1874 as a result of combat wounds. Péguy studied at the [[Lycée Lakanal]] in [[Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine|Sceaux]], winning a scholarship at the [[École normale supérieure (Paris)]], where he attended notably the lectures of [[Henri Bergson]] and [[Romain Rolland]], whom he befriended. He formally left without graduating, in 1897, though he continued attending some lectures in 1898. Influenced by [[Lucien Herr]], librarian of the ''École Normale Supérieure'', he became an ardent [[Dreyfus Affair|Dreyfusard]].

In 1897, Péguy married Charlotte-Françoise Baudoin; they had one daughter and three sons, one of whom was born after Péguy's death. Around 1910 he fell deeply in love with Blanche Raphael, a young Jewish friend; however, he was faithful to his wife.

From his earliest years, he was influenced by socialism. He joined the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] in 1895. From 1900 until his death in 1914, he was the main contributor to and the editor of the literary magazine ''Les Cahiers de la Quinzaine'', which at first supported the Socialist Party director [[Jean Jaurès]]. However, Péguy ultimately ended this support after he began viewing Jaurès as a traitor to the nation and to socialism. In the ''Cahiers'', Péguy published not only his own essays and poetry, but also works by important contemporary authors such as [[Romain Rolland]].

His free-verse poem, "Portico of the Mystery of the Second Virtue", has gone through more than 60 editions in France. It was a favorite book of [[Charles de Gaulle]].

When the [[World War I|Great War]] broke out, Péguy became a lieutenant in the 19th company of the French 276th Infantry Regiment. He died in battle, shot in the forehead, near [[Villeroy, Seine-et-Marne|Villeroy]], Seine-et-Marne on the day before the beginning of the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]].&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt, Hans (1953). "Charles Péguy: The Man and the Legend, 1873–1953," ''Chicago Review'', Vol. 7, No. 1, pp. 24–37.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a memorial to Péguy near the field where he was killed.

==Influence==
[[File:Aktion 1914.jpg|thumb|200px|Cover of ''[[Die Aktion]]'' with Péguy's portrait by [[Egon Schiele]]]]
[[Benito Mussolini]] referred to Péguy as a "source" for [[Italian fascism|Fascism]]; Péguy would likely have been horrified by this appropriation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution|publisher=Princeton University Press | author=Sternhell, Zeev | year=1994 | pages=35 | isbn=0-691-03289-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zaretsky, Robert (1996). [http://www.vqronline.org/articles/1996/winter/zaretsky-fascism-wrong-idea/ "Fascism: the Wrong Idea,"] ''The Virginia Quarterly Review'', pp. 149-155.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Second World War]] both supporters and opponents of [[Vichy France]] cited Péguy. [[Edmond Michelet]] was the first of many members of the [[French Resistance]] to quote Péguy; de Gaulle, familiar with Péguy's writing, quoted him a 1942 speech. Those who opposed Vichy's anti-Semitism laws often cited him. By contrast, [[Robert Brasillach]] praised Péguy as a "French National Socialist", and Péguy's sons Pierre and Marcel wrote that their father was an inspiration for Vichy's [[National Revolution]] ideology and "above all, a racist".&lt;ref name="jackson2001"&gt;{{cite book | title=France: The Dark Years, 1940–1944 | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Jackson, Julian | year=2001 | pages=4–5 | isbn=0-19-820706-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English novelist [[Graham Greene]] alluded to Péguy in ''[[Brighton Rock (novel)|Brighton Rock]]'', while ''[[The Heart of the Matter]]'' has as its epigraph a quotation from Péguy.&lt;ref&gt;Grahame C. Jones, "Graham Greene and the Legend of Péguy". ''Comparative Literature'', '''XXI'''(2), Spring 1969, pp. 138–40.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Lawless Roads'' Greene refers to Péguy "challenging God in the cause of the damned".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Grahame C. Jones, in "Graham Greene and the Legend of Péguy", fn2, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swiss theologian [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]], in the course of describing the history of art as an ongoing, sometimes more and sometimes less successful approximation of God's creativeness, noted that Peguy's Eve was a "theological redemption of the project of Proust", meaning that where Proust was gifted with memory and charity, the Eve of Peguy – not necessarily Peguy himself – was gifted with memory, charity, and direct knowledge of the redemption of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nichols|first1=Aidan|title=The Word Has Been Abroad|pages=125}} Catholic University Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Geoffrey Hill]] published a poem in 1983 as a homage to Péguy, entitled ''The Mystery of the Charity of Charles Péguy''.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Geoffrey (1985). ''Notes – Collected Poems''. London: Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famous quotations==
"The sinner is at the very heart of Christianity. Nobody is so competent as the sinner in matters of Christianity. Nobody, except the saint." This is the epigraph to [[Graham Greene]]'s novel ''[[The Heart of the Matter]]'' (1951).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Shapeless God: Essays on Modern Fiction| publisher=[[University of Pittsburgh Press]] |author1=Mooney, Harry John  |author2=Thomas F. Staley | year=1964 | pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"It will never be known what acts of cowardice have been committed for fear of not looking sufficiently progressive." (''Notre Patrie'', 1905)

"Tyranny is always better organised than freedom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Gabay's Copywriters' Compendium: The Definitive Professional Writer's Guide| publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann]] | author= Gabay, J. Jonathan| year=2005 | pages=524 | isbn=0-7506-8320-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Christian Democracy sidebar|expanded=Ideas}}
'''Christian corporatism''' is a societal, economic, or a modern political application of the [[Christianity|Christian]] doctrine of [[Paul of Tarsus]] in [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|I Corinthians]] 12:12-31 where Paul speaks of an organic form of politics and society where all people and components are functionally united, like the human body.&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J. 1996. Pp. 28"&gt;Wiarda, Howard J., pp. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Christian corporatism has been supported by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Protestantism|Protestants]], [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]], and others.&lt;ref name="Gehler pp. 76"&gt;Gehler, Michael and Kaiser, Wolfram, pp. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J., pp. 39"&gt;Wiarda, Howard J., pp. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Economic application of Christian corporatism has promoted consultations between employers and workers and has sponsored Christian [[trade union]]ism.&lt;ref name="Gehler pp. 76"/&gt;

==Roman Catholic==
During the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Roman Catholic Church]] sponsored the creation of various institutions including brotherhoods, monasteries, religious orders, and military associations, especially during the [[Crusades]] to sponsor connection between these groups.&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J. 1996. Pp. 31"&gt;Wiarda, Howard J., pp. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1881, [[Pope Leo XIII]] commissioned theologians and social thinkers to study corporatism and provide a definition for it. In 1884 in [[Freiburg]], the commission declared that corporatism was a "system of social organization that has at its base the grouping of men according to the community of their natural interests and social functions, and as true and proper organs of the state they direct and coordinate labor and capital in matters of common interest."&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J. 1996. Pp. 35"&gt;Wiarda, Howard J., pp. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the Freiburg meeting, corporatism grew in popularity and the ''corporatist internationale'' was formed in 1890 followed by the publishing of ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' (1891) by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] that for the first time declared the Church's blessing to trade unions and called for organized labour to be recognized by politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Wiarda, Howard J., pp. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Many corporatist unions in Europe were backed by the Roman Catholic Church to challenge the rise of [[Anarchism|anarchist]], [[Marxism|Marxist]] and other radical unions, with the corporatist unions being fairly conservative in comparison to their radical rivals.&lt;ref&gt;Wiarda, Howard J., pp.38.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the fortieth anniversary of the publishing of ''Rerum novarum'', [[Pope Pius XI]] in ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'' (1931) advocated Christian corporatism as an alternative to [[Capitalism|capitalist]] [[individualism]] and [[Socialism|socialist]] [[totalitarianism]] whereby people would be organized into workers' [[guild]]s or vocational groups that would cooperate under the supervision of a neutral state.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Travis Kroeker. ''Christian ethics and political economy in North America: a critical analysis''. McGill-Queens University Press, 1995. P94.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protestant ==
In response to the rise in popularity of Roman Catholic corporatism in the 1890s, Protestant corporatism arose, especially in [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Scandinavia]].&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J., pp. 39"/&gt; However, Protestant corporatism has been far less successful in being supported by governments than its Roman Catholic counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;Wiarda, Howard J., pp. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|reason=Au contraire, source says: "Other strongly corporatist countries are Sweden and the Netherlands..."|date=July 2012}}

The [[New Testament]] frequently cites Jewish scripture to support the claim of the [[Early Christians]] that [[Jesus of Nazareth]] is the  [[Messiah]], and to support faith in Jesus as the [[Christ (title)|Christ]] and his imminent expected [[Second Coming]]. The majority of these quotations and references are taken from the [[Book of Isaiah]], but they range over the entire corpus of Jewish writings. People of the Jewish faith do not regard any of these as having been fulfilled by Jesus, and in some cases do not regard them as messianic prophecies at all.

==Prophecies considered fulfilled==

===Daniel 9:24-27===
{{Main|Prophecy of Seventy Weeks}}
{{quote|"Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy. Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.  And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined. And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate"  -  Daniel 9:24-27 (Authorized Version 1611)}}

References to "most holy", "anointed" ("Messiah") and "prince" have been interpreted as speaking of Jesus, and the phrase "anointed shall be cut off" as pointing to his crucifixion, the "people of the prince who is to come" being taken to refer to the Romans who destroyed Jerusalem and the Temple in 70 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Meadowcroft.

''Requires subscription for full content''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Gospel of Mark]], Jesus refers to the "[[abomination of desolation]]" ({{bibleverse||Mark|13:14|NASB}}, ''NASB'') and the [[Gospel of Matthew]] adds a direct reference to this as being from the [[Book of Daniel]], "Therefore when you see the {{sc|abomination of desolation}} which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet…" ({{bibleverse||Matt|24:15|NASB}}, ''NASB'').

===Deuteronomy 18:15===
{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|18|HE}} is one of the earliest prophecies which speaks of a prophet who would be raised up from among the Jewish nation.
{{quote|&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; "The LORD will raise up for you a prophet like me from among yourselves, from your own kinsmen. You are to pay attention to him ... &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their kinsmen. I will put my words in his mouth, and he will tell them everything I order him." ([[Complete Jewish Bible|CJB]])}}
In {{bibleverse|Acts|3:18-22|NIV}}, [[Saint Peter|Peter]] claimed that Jesus was the fulfillment of this promise.

===Ezekiel 37:24, 26-27===
{{quote|And David my servant [shall be] king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.|Ekeziel 37:24, KJV}}

Verses from to 15 to 24 can't be referred to King David, since the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)#Biblical narrative#End|united monarchy of Israel]] was divided in two reigns ''after'' the death of his son [[Solomon]] (999-931 BCE), son of [[David]]. Furthermore, Ezekiel (622-570) wrote in the seventh century BCE, four century after this subject of the biblical narration, nevertheless adopting a prophecy that is by its nature usually referred to future happenings. Therefore, as the "stick of Judah" stands for the House of Judah, and the "stick of Joseph" stands for his tribe (verse 19), the expression "David my servant shall be king over them" (verse 24) may be read as a prophecy about a person of the House of David, which would have ruled over one nation in one land, gathered upon the mountains of Israel on evey side of the earth.

The narration continues as follows: 
{{quote|"I will make a covenant of peace with them, an everlasting covenant. I will give to them, increase their numbers, and set my Sanctuary among them forever. My dwelling place will be with them; I will be their God, and they will be my people." ([[Complete Jewish Bible|CJB]])}}

The "dwelling place" (Hebrew ''mishkan'') recalls the wilderness [[tabernacle]]. The Sanctuary (Hebrew ''miqdash'') points rather to the Temple, in particular the renewed Temple, which will occupy  Ezekiel's attention in the last ch.s of 40-48.

Christianity believes that Ezekiel's Temple is more glorious than the Tabernacle of Moses (Exodus 25-40) and the Temple of Solomon (1 Kings 5-8), pointing forward to several beliefs:
*(1) the glory in which God dwells with man in the Messiah (John 1:14 ''The Word became a human being and lived with us, and we saw his Sh'khinah'' ([[Complete Jewish Bible|CJB]]));
*(2) The Messiah's body is the Temple (John 2:19-21 ''Yeshua answered them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again." The Judeans said, "It took 46 years to build this Temple, and you're going to raise it in three days?" But the "temple" he had spoken of was his body.'' ([[Complete Jewish Bible|CJB]]));
*(3) the messianic community as the Temple (1 Corinthians 3:16 ''Don't you know that you people are God's Temple and that God's Spirit lives in you?'', Ephesians 2:20-22 ''You have been built on the foundation of the emissaries and the prophets, with the cornerstone being Yeshua the Messiah himself. In union with him the whole building is held together, and it is growing into a holy temple in union with the Lord. Yes, in union with him, you yourselves are being built together into a spiritual dwelling-place for God!'', 1 Peter 2:5 ''...you yourselves, as living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be cohanim set apart for God to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to him through Yeshua the Messiah. '' ([[Complete Jewish Bible|CJB]]));
*(4) the body of the individual believer (1 Corinthians 6:19 ''Or don't you know that your body is a Temple for the Ruach HaKodesh who lives inside you, whom you received from God? The fact is, you don't belong to yourselves'' ([[Complete Jewish Bible|CJB]]));
*(5) the heavenly Jerusalem (Revelation [http://www.biblestudytools.com/cjb/revelation/passage.aspx?q=Revelation+21:9-27;Revelation+22:1-5 21:9-22:5])&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Judaism holds that the Messiah has not yet arrived namely because of the belief that the [[Messianic Age]] has not started yet. Jews believe that the Messiah will completely change life on earth and that pain and suffering will be conquered, thus initiating the [[Kingdom of God]] and the Messianic Age on earth. Christian belief varies, with one segment holding that the Kingdom of God is not worldly at all, while another believe that the Kingdom is both spiritual and will be of this world in a Messianic Age where Jesus will rule on the throne of David. Most Jews hold that the Kingdom of God will be on earth and the Messiah will occupy the throne of David. Christians (in particular Evangelicals) who believe that it is both/and claim that it is spiritual and within right now, and physical and outward at the return of the Messiah.

While Christians have cited the following as prophecies referencing the life, status, and legacy of Jesus, Jewish scholars maintain that these passages are not messianic prophecies and are based on mistranslations/misunderstanding of the Hebrew texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simpletoremember.com/articles/a/jewsandjesus#1|title=Why Don't Jews Believe In Jesus - The difference between Judaism and Christianity|website=www.simpletoremember.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Haggai 2:6-9===
{{quote|"6 For this is what ADONAI-Tzva'ot says: "It won't be long before one more time I will shake the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land;
7 and I will shake all the nations, so that the treasures of all the nations will flow in; and I will fill this house with glory," says ADONAI-Tzva'ot.
8  "The silver is mine, and the gold is mine," says ADONAI-Tzva'ot.
9 "The glory of this new house will surpass that of the old," says ADONAI-Tzva'ot, "and in this place I will grant shalom," says ADONAI-Tzva'ot.'" ([[Complete Jewish Bible|CJB]])}}

The [[Second Temple]] was to be filled with the glory of God and its glory would be superior to [[Solomon's temple]] despite the missing artifacts and the absence of sacred fire (God initially lighting up the altar Himself).

For some Christians, this prophecy is believed to be fulfilled in [[Jesus of Nazareth]] being present and teaching in Herod's renovated [[Herod's Temple|Temple]] and peace being granted by God for mankind in that place through the tearing of the veil of the Holy of Holies upon Christ's death. Furthermore, it is asserted that if Haggai's prophecy is to be held as true, it must have been accomplished before 70 AD since the Romans destroyed the Second Temple at that time.

On the other hand, many scholars, including evangelical Christians, understand the prophecy as being in reference to the physical splendor of the Temple (as implied by the context) and/or apply it to the yet future [[Third Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;J.

===Hosea 11:1===
{{Main|Flight into Egypt#Prophecy of Hosea}}
{{quote|"When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son."}}

In its original context, this text from [[Hosea]] referred to the deliverance of the people of Israel from bondage in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;David A. DeSilva, ''An Introduction to the New Testament'', InterVarsity Press, 2004, page 249.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gospel of Matthew applies it to the return from Egypt of Jesus and his family as a messianic prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;[[John H.

This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, ‘Out of Egypt have I called my son’" (Matthew 2: 13-15).

=== Isaiah ===

====Isaiah 7:14====
{{Main|Isaiah 7:14}}
In Isaiah 7:14 [[Isaiah|the prophet Isaiah]], addressing king [[Ahaz]] of Judah, promises the king that God will destroy his enemies; as a sign that his oracle is a true one, Isaiah predicts that a "young woman"  or "virgin" ("[[almah]]") will shortly give birth to a child whose name will be [[Immanuel]], "God is with us", and that the threat from the enemy kings will be ended before the child grows up.{{sfn|Childs|2001|p=66}} The almah has been identified as either the mother of Hezekiah or a daughter of Isaiah, although there are problems with both candidates.{{sfn|Coogan|2007|p=988}}

The [[gospel of Matthew]] presents Jesus's ministry as largely the fulfilment of prophecies from Isaiah.{{sfn|Barker|2001|p=490}} In the time of Jesus, however, the Jews of Palestine no longer spoke Hebrew, and Isaiah had to be translated into Greek and Aramaic, the two commonly used languages.{{sfn|Barker|2001|p=490}} In the original Hebrew of Isaiah 7:14 the word [[almah]] meant a young woman of childbearing age who had not yet given birth and who might or might not be a virgin, and the Greek translation rendered [[almah]] as ''parthenos'', the Greek word for "virgin".{{sfn|Saldarini|2001|p=1007}} Scholars agree that ''almah'' has nothing to do with virginity, but many conservative American Christians still judge the acceptability of new bible translations by the way they deal with Isaiah 7:14.{{sfn|Rhodes|2009|p=75-82}}{{sfn|Sweeney|1996|p=161}} The virgin birth is found only in the gospels of Matthew and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]]; there is no reference to the birth of Jesus in [[Gospel of Mark|Mark's gospel]] or the [[Gospel of John]], nor in the epistles of Paul, who says that Jesus was "born of a woman" without mentioning that the woman was a virgin.{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|p=96}}

====Isaiah 8:14====
{{quote|"But a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense"}} 

1 Peter 2:8 interprets the stone as Christ, quoting Isaiah 8:14 along with Psalm 118:22 and Isaiah 28:16 which mention a stone and a cornerstone.

====Isaiah 8:23-9:1 (9:1-2)====
{{refimprove section|date=November 2012}}

According to both Jewish and Christian interpretation, the prophet Isaiah was commanded to inform the people of Israel in a prophecy that [[Sennacherib]]'s plunder of the [[Ten Tribes]] was at hand, and that [[Nebuchadnezzar]]'s spoil of [[Jerusalem]], in later years, was coming nearer.&lt;ref name=SET-notesISA8-1&gt;

"The [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] exiled the Ten Tribes in three stages (see 2nd Kings Chs. 15,17). The first time the people were not so severely shocked and alarmed, but when Sennacherib would return and uproot the remaining population of the Northern Kingdom, the distress would be felt much more intensely. The land is called 'region of the nations', because so many peoples desired it."
&lt;/ref&gt; he dealt mildly, [exiling only] the land of [[Zebulun]] and the land of [[Naftali]], 
::&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and the last one he dealt harshly, the way of the sea, and the other side of the [[Jordan River|Jordan]], the attraction of the [[goyim|nations]]." [{{bibleref|ISA|8:23|JPR}}&amp;nbsp;(9:1)&lt;ref name=bibgatenote&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;]

After this prophetic address to the people of Israel, Isaiah interrupts his prophecy and speaks to God. According to [[Rashi#Commentary on the Tanakh|Jewish tradition]], the salvation of which he speaks is the miraculous end of Sennacherib's siege of Jerusalem (see Isaiah 36 and 37) in the days of the ''Prince of Peace'', King [[Hezekiah]], a child of King [[Ahaz]].

Opposing this idea is Rashi himself who discovers that Hezekiah was already born at the time of the prophecy so this would invalidate him as the child to be born in the future. 
Concerning Isa 7:14 you may find the following quote interesting -
"RASHI also came to the conclusion that the Immanuel prophecy could not refer to Hezekiah, because ‘if you count up the years of Hezekiah you will find that Hezekiah was born nine years before his father [Ahaz] ascended the throne.’ Hence, Hezekiah was born nine years before the prophecy was given, and yet the prophet says: ‘Behold the virgin shall (future tense) conceive...’ " (Rachmiel Frydland, What the Rabbis Know About the Messiah- A Study of Genealogy and Prophecy [Cincinnati Ohio; Messianic Publishing Co., 1993] P40)

The interpretation of {{bibleref|ISA|9:1-2|NKJV}} by the Gospel author of Matthew has led Christian authors to hint at its [[Christology|messianic applications]].&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Powis Smith [https://www.jstor.org/stable/528788 American Journal of Semitic Languages and Literatures, Vol. 40, No. 4 (Jul., 1924)]&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;"The people walking in darkness have seen a great light;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Upon those living in the land of deep darkness a light has dawned." [(9:1)&lt;ref name=bibgatenote/&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{bibleref|ISA|9:2|NIV}}]

[[Gospel of Matthew#Authorship|Matthew]] refers to this, since Jesus began his one to three years of [[Ministry of Jesus#Ministry in Galilee|ministry]] in Galilee:
:&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; "Now when Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, He departed to [[Galilee]]. &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; And leaving [[Nazareth]], He came and dwelt in [[Capernaum]], which is by the sea, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali, &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:
::&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; "The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, By the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles: &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; The people who sat in darkness have seen a great light, And upon those who sat in the region and shadow of death Light has dawned."" {{bibleverse|Matt|4:12-16|NKJV}}.

In Isaiah, this prophecy describes how [[Assyria]]n invaders from the east are increasingly aggressive as they progress westwards toward the sea, the coastline of the [[levant]]e, while [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 4:14-16 has re-interpreted the description as a prophecy stating that Jesus, the new Prince of Peace, would progress (without any hint of becoming more aggressive) toward Galilee. While Matthew loosely plagiarizes a Greek [[Septuagint]] interpretation of scripture (Isaiah 8:23-9:1-2),&lt;ref name=bibgatenote/&gt; in the [[Masoretic text]] it reads totally different and refers to the 'region of the [[goyim|nations]]'.&lt;ref name=SET-notesISA8-23/&gt;

====Isaiah 9:6,7 (9:5,6)====
{{main|Pele-joez-el-gibbor-abi-ad-sar-shalom}}
Some Christians believe that this verse refers to the birth of Jesus as [[Christ|the Messiah]]. The verse reads in Christian bible versions:
{{quote|"6. For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us;
And the government will rest on His shoulders;
And His name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, The Mighty God,
The Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace."|{{bibleverse||Isaiah|9:6|kjv}}}}

In Jewish translations of the [[Hebrew Bible]] the verse reads differently and the [[chapters and verses of the Bible|verse numbering]] is different (9:6 in the Christian Old Testament is numbered 9:5 in Hebrew Bible versions):
{{quote|"5. For a child has been born to us, a son given to us, and the authority is upon his shoulder, and the wondrous adviser, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, called his name, "the prince of peace.""&lt;ref name=SETnotesonISA9-5&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;|{{bibleverse||Isaiah|9:5|JPR}}}}

But newer Jewish versions do not translate the verse this way and the changing of the order of the words is problematic in the newer translations .  For example:

Isa 9:6  (9:5) For a child is born unto us, a son hath been given unto us, and the government is placed on his shoulders; and his name is called, Wonderful, counsellor of the mighty God, of the everlasting Father, the prince of peace, (Lesser)

Isa 9:6  (9:5) For a child is born unto us, a son is given unto us; and the government is upon his shoulder; and his name is called Pele- joez-el-gibbor-Abi-ad-sar-shalom; (JPS 1917)&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Isaac Leeser's translation 1853 and the 1917 Jewish Publication Society translation&lt;/ref&gt;

This long name is the [[throne name]] of the royal child. Semitic names often consist of sentences that describe God; thus the name [[Isaiah]] in Hebrew means "Yahweh saves"; [[Hezekiah]], "Yahweh strengthens"; in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], the name of the Babylonian king M'rodakh-Bal'adan ([http://www.biblestudytools.com/cjb/isaiah/39-1.html 39:1]) means "[[Marduk]] has provided an heir." These names do not describe that person who holds them but the god whom the parents worship.&lt;ref&gt;The Jewish Study Bible (Oxford Press); commentary on Isaiah 9.5&lt;/ref&gt;

This verse is expressly applied to the Messiah in the [[Targum]], i.e. Aramaic commentary on the Hebrew Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Edersheim The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah 1883 "and there is a very curious comment in Debarim R. 1 (ed. Warsh., p.&amp;nbsp;4a) in connection with a Haggadic discussion of Genesis 43:14, which, however fanciful, makes a Messianic application of this passage - also in Bemidbar R. 11." [http://philologos.org/__eb-lat/appen09.htm Philologos | The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah | Appendix 9]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Isaiah 11:12====
{{quote|"And he shall set up a banner for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth." {{bibleverse||Isaiah|11:12|NASB}}}}

Some commentators view this as an unfulfilled prophecy, arguing that the Jewish people have not all been gathered in Israel.&lt;ref name="JewsJudaism"&gt;[[Jews for Judaism]]: [http://jewsforjudaism.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=374&amp;Itemid=234 Messiah: The Criteria]&lt;/ref&gt; Some Christians refer to the foundation of the State of Israel as fulfillment of this prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Farzana Hassan]], ''Prophecy and the Fundamentalist Quest: An Integrative Study of Christian and Muslim Apocalyptic Religion'' (McFarland, 2008), page 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that the fulfillment is that Jesus as Messiah brings all nations to himself (cf. 11:10 "Nations will seek his counsel / And his abode will be honored.") citing John 12:32 ("And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.") and Paul in Romans 15:12 when he quotes Isaiah 11:10, emphasizing the inclusion of the [[gentiles]] into the people of God.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[ESV Study Bible]]; "History of Salvation in the OT"&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christians also believe that Isaiah 2:2 is to be understood in connection with Isaiah 11:10,12.
{{quote|"In the days to come, The Mount of the Lord’s house Shall stand firm above the mountains And tower above the hills; And all the nations Shall gaze on it with joy." {{bibleverse||Isaiah|2:2|NASB}}}}

Some Christians believe that Jesus the Messiah is the ultimate "house" or dwelling place of God, as is told in John 1:14 ("And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory") and 2:19-21 ("Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up." The Jews then said, "It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days?" But he was speaking about the temple of his body."). Through him the messianic community becomes a temple in 1 Corinthians 3:16 ("Do you not know that you all are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in you?"') and Ephesians 2:20-22 ("...built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, the Messiah Jesus himself being the cornerstone, in whom the whole structure, being joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord. In him you also are being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit."). It is through the Messiah's exaltation all nations are drawn to him, as in Luke 24:47 ("...and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.").&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Isaiah 53:5====
{{Main|Isaiah 53}}
Isaiah 53 is probably the most famous example claimed by Christians to be a messianic prophecy fulfilled by Jesus. It speaks of one known as the "[[Servant songs|suffering servant]]," who suffers because of the sins of others. Jesus is said to fulfill this prophecy through his death on the cross.&lt;ref&gt;George Dahl [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3259541 Journal of Biblical Literature Vol. 57, No. 1 (Mar., 1938) ''requires subscription for full content'']&lt;/ref&gt; The following verse from Isaiah 53:5 is understood by many Christians to speak of Jesus as the Messiah:

{{quote|"But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed." {{bibleverse||Isaiah|53:5|KJV}} ([[King James Version]])}}

|accessdate=2 January 2013}}"The well-worn claim frequently advanced by Christian apologists who argue that the noted Jewish commentator, Rashi (1040 CE – 1105 CE), was the first to identify the suffering servant of Isaiah 53 with the nation of Israel is inaccurate and misleading. In fact, Origen, a prominent and influential church father, conceded in the year 248 CE – eight centuries before Rashi was born – that the consensus among the Jews in his time was that Isaiah 53 "bore reference to the whole [Jewish] people, regarded as one individual, and as being in a state of dispersion and suffering, in order that many proselytes might be gained, on account of the dispersion of the Jews among numerous heathen nations."( Origen, Contra Celsum, Chadwick, Henry; Cambridge Press, book 1, chapter 55, page 50) The broad consensus among Jewish, and even some Christian commentators, that the "servant" in Isaiah 52-53 refers to the nation of Israel is understandable. Isaiah 53, which is the fourth of four renowned Servant Songs, is umbilically connected to its preceding chapters. The "servant" in each of the three previous Servant Songs is plainly and repeatedly identified as the nation of Israel."
&lt;/ref&gt;  as well as [[Rashi]] (1040–1105) and [[Origen]] (184/185 – 253/254 CE),&lt;ref name=RTSingerSufferingServant/&gt; view the 'suffering servant' as a reference to the whole Jewish people, regarded as one individual,&lt;ref&gt;Joel E.

One of the first claims in the [[New Testament]] that Isaiah 53 is a prophecy of Jesus comes from the [[Book of Acts]] chapter 8 verses 26-36, which describes a scene in which God commands [[Philip the Apostle]] to approach an Ethiopian eunuch who is sitting in a chariot, reading aloud to himself from the [[Book of Isaiah]]. The eunuch comments that he does not understand what he is reading (Isaiah 53) and Philip explains to him that the passage refers to Jesus: "And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? Of himself, or of some other man? Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus."

===Jeremiah 31:15===
Matthew 2:17-18 gives the killing of innocents by Herod as the fulfillment of a prophecy spoken of in Jeremiah:
:Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:
:A voice is heard in Ramah,
:weeping and great mourning,
:Rachel weeping for her children
:and refusing to be comforted,
:because they are no more.
In Jeremiah 31:15, the phrase "because her children are no more" refers to the [[Assyrian captivity|captivity]] of Rachel's children in [[Assyria]]. The subsequent verses describe their return to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 31:16-17, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Micah 5:2 (Micah 5:1 in Hebrew){{anchor|Micah 5:2}}===
{{quote|"But thou, Beth-lehem Ephrathah, which art little to be among the thousands of Judah, out of thee shall one come forth unto Me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth are from of old, from ancient days." ({{bibleverse||Micah|5:1|HE}})}}

A verse near the end of [[Micah (prophet)|Micah]]'s prophecy on the [[Babylonian captivity]]  has been interpreted by Christian apologists as a prophecy that the Messiah would be born in [[Bethlehem]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Muss-Arnolt [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3140020 Biblical World, Vol. 9, No. 6 (Jun., 1897) ''Requires subscription for full content'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The verse describes the [[clan]] of Bethlehem, who was the son of [[Caleb]]'s second wife, [[Ephrathah]]. (1 Chr. [http://www.biblestudytools.com/cjb/1-chronicles/2-18.html 2:18], [http://www.biblestudytools.com/cjb/1-chronicles/passage.aspx?q=1%20Chronicles+2:50-52 2:50-52], [http://www.biblestudytools.com/cjb/1-chronicles/4-4.html 4:4]) Bethlehem Ephrathah is the town and clan from which king [[David]] was born,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|16.18-23|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this passage refers to the future birth of a new Davidic heir.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Fitzmyer, ''The One who is to Come'', (Eerdmans, 2007), page 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke give different accounts of the birth of Jesus, both place the birth in Bethlehem.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond E. Brown, ''The Birth of the Messiah'', Anchor Bible (1999), page 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gospel of Matthew describes [[Herod the Great]] as asking the chief priests and scribes of Jerusalem where the Messiah was to be born. They respond by quoting Micah, "In Beit-Lechem of Y'hudah," they replied, "because the prophet wrote, 'And you, Beit-Lechem in the land of Y'hudah, are by no means the least among the rulers of Y'hudah; for from you will come a Ruler who will shepherd my people Isra'el.'" ({{bibleverse||Matt|2:4-6|NASB}})

The idea that Bethlehem was to be the birthplace of the Messiah appears in no Jewish source before the 4th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin D. Freed, ''The Stories of Jesus' Birth'', (Continuum International, 2004), page 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish tradition appears to have emphasised the idea that the birthplace of the Messiah was not known.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin D Freed, ''The Stories of Jesus' Birth'', (Continuum International, 2004), page 79; see {{bibleverse||John|7:26-27|131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modern scholars consider the birth stories as inventions by the Gospel writers, created to glorify Jesus and present his birth as the fulfillment of prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;Geza Vermes, ''The Nativity: History and Legend'', London, Penguin, 2006, p22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. P. Sanders, ''The Historical Figure of Jesus'', Penguin, 1993, p.85.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the birth in Bethlehem is one of the few common elements in the Gospel accounts, some scholars believe that both writers were drawing on an existing Christian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin D. Freed, ''The Stories of Jesus' Birth'', (Continuum International, 2004), page 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psalms===
Some portions of the Psalms are considered prophetic in Judaism, even though they are listed among the [[Ketuvim]] (Writings) and not the [[Nevi'im]] (Prophets).

The words Messiah and Christ mean "anointed one". In ancient times Jewish leaders were [[anointing|anointed]] with olive oil when they assumed their position (e.g. David, Saul, Isaac, Jacob). And "Messiah" is used as a name for kings in the Hebrew Bible: in {{bibleverse||2Samuel|1:14}} David finds King Saul's killer and asks, "Why were you not afraid to lift your hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?"

In many Psalms, whose authorship are traditionally ascribed to King David (i.e. ''Messiah'' David), the author writes about his life in third person, referring to himself as "the/God's/your messiah" while clearly discussing his military exploits. Thus it can be argued that many of the portions that are asserted to be prophetic Psalms may not be. Psalm 2, spoken of below, can be argued to be about David and not Jesus. {{bibleverse||Psalms|2:6}} says "I have installed [past tense] my King on Zion, my holy hill [Jerusalem, David's capital that he captured in battle in 1 Samuel]." {{bibleverse||Psalms|2:7}} says, "I [David, the author] will proclaim the decree of the LORD: He said to me [David, the person to whom God was speaking], 'You [David] are my Son; today I have become your [adopted] Father.'" If the passage was speaking about a begotten son then that person would have been born the son of that father; he wouldn't have to become it at some later point after birth. (Throughout the Bible it is common to call saints and angels the sons or children of God.)

====Psalm 2====
{{Main|Psalm 2}}
"Why do the nations conspire, and the peoples plot in vain? 2. The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD and his Anointed, saying, 3. 'Let us burst their bonds asunder, and cast their cords from us.' 4. He who sits in the heavens laughs; the LORD has them in derision. 5. Then he will speak to them in his wrath, and terrify them in his fury, saying, 6. 'I have set my king on Zion, my holy hill." 7. I will tell of the decree of the LORD: He said to me, 'You are my son, today I have begotten you. 8. Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your possession. 9. You shall break them with a rod of iron, and dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel'" ([[Psalm]] 2: 1-9).

The authors of Acts and the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] interpreted it as relating to Jesus.

Verse 2. "Anointed" – in Hebrew ''mashiah'', "anointed"; in Greek ''christos'', referring to a ruler anointed by God and not a particular person.
Verse 7. The LORD is the messiah’s father. In Judaism the phrase "Son of God" has very different connotations than in Christianity, not referring to literal descent but to [[tzadik|the righteous]] who have become conscious of God's father of mankind.

Christians cite [[Herod Antipas|Herod]] and [[Pontius Pilate]] setting themselves against Jesus as evidence that Psalm 2 refers to him. 
Acts 13: 33 interprets Jesus’ rising from the dead as confirmation of verse 7 ("You are my son, today I have begotten you").

Hebrews 1: 5 employs verse 7 in order to argue that Jesus is superior to the angels, i.e., Jesus is superior as a mediator between God and man. "For to what angel did God ever say, ''Thou art my Son, today I have begotten thee''?" However, the phrase "son of God" appears in the Hebrew Bible to describe others than the coming Messiah, including [[David]] and [[Jacob]].

Texts vary in the exact wording of the phrase beginning Psalm 2:12, with "kiss his foot", and "kiss the Son" being most common in various languages for centuries, though not in original Hebrew Manuscripts such as the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].

====Psalm 16====
The interpretation of Psalm 16 as a messanic prophecy is common among Christian [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[hermeneutics]].&lt;ref&gt;Darrell L. Bock [http://faculty.gordon.edu/hu/bi/Ted_Hildebrandt/NTeSources/NTArticles/BSac-NT/Bock_OTinNT1_BS.pdf Bibliotheca Sacra 142 (July, 1985)]&lt;/ref&gt;
"I bless the Lord who has given me understanding, because even in the night, my heart warns me. I keep the Lord always within my sight; for he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. For this reason my heart is glad and my soul rejoices; moreover, my body also will rest secure, for thou wilt not leave my soul in the abode of the dead, nor permit thy holy one to see corruption. Thou wilt show me the path of life, the fullness of joys in thy presence, and delights at thy right hand forever" (verses 7-11).

According to the preaching of Peter, this prophecy is about the messiah’s triumph over death, i.e., the resurrection of Jesus.

"God raised Jesus up, having loosed the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it. For David says concerning him, ‘I saw the Lord always before me, for he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken… For thou wilt not abandon my soul to Hades, nor let thy Holy One see corruption… Thou wilt make me full of gladness with thy presence.’ Brethren, I may say to you confidently of the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants upon his throne, he foresaw and spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption. This Jesus God raised up, and we are all witnesses of it" (Acts 2: 24-32).

Also of note is what Paul said in the synagogue at [[Antioch]]. "And as for the fact that he raised him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he spoke in this way, ‘I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.’ Therefore, he also says in another psalm, ‘Thou wilt not let thy Holy One see corruption.’ For David, after he had served the counsel of God in his own generation, fell asleep, and saw corruption; but he whom God raised up saw no corruption" (Acts 13: 34-37).

====Psalm 22====
{{See also|Sayings of Jesus on the cross|They have pierced my hands and my feet}}
Two of the Gospels ({{bibleref|Matthew|27:46|131}} and {{bibleref|Mark|15:34|131}}) quote Jesus as speaking these words from the cross;&lt;ref&gt;Mark H. Heinemann [http://faculty.gordon.edu/hu/bi/Ted_Hildebrandt/OTeSources/19-Psalms/Text/Articles/Heinemann-Ps22-BS.pdf BIBLIOTHECA SACRA 147 (July 1990)]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"From the cross, Jesus cried with a loud voice, "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"}}

The other two canonical Gospels give different accounts of the words of Jesus. Luke 23:46 quotes Psalm 31:5 ("Into your hands I commit my spirit") while John has Jesus say "It is finished" (John 19:30). Some scholars see this as evidence that the words of Jesus were not part of a pre-Gospel [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] narrative, but were added later by the Gospel writers.&lt;ref&gt;Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible, (Eerdmans, 2000), page 1012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In most Hebrew manuscripts, such as the [[Masoretic]], Psalm 22:16 (verse 17 in the [[Chapters and verses of the Bible|Hebrew verse numbering]]) reads כארי ידי ורגלי ("like a lion my hands and my feet").&lt;ref&gt;Disciples Study Bible (NIV)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2008}} Many [[Modern English]] translations render this as "[[they have pierced my hands and my feet]]", starting with the [[Coverdale Bible]] which translated [[Luther Bible|Luther]]'s ''durchgraben'' (dig through, penetrate) as ''pearsed'', with durchgraben being a variation of the [[Septuagint]]'s ωρυξαν "dug". This translation is highly controversial. It is asserted in Christian apologetics that the Dead Sea Scrolls lend weight to the translation as "[[They have pierced my hands and my feet]]", by lengthening the yud in the Hebrew word כארי (like a lion) into a vav כארו "Kaaru", which is not a word in the Hebrew language but when the aleph is omitted becomes כרו, dig, similar to the Septaguint translation.&lt;ref&gt;The Dead Sea Scrolls Bible, Translated  and with commentary by Martin Abegg Jr., Peter Flint and Eugene Ulrich. (San Francisco: HarperCollins, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; However this view is contested considering the Nahal Hever scribe's other numerous misspellings, such as one in the very same sentence, where ידיה is written instead of the correct ידי, making the Hebrew word ידי yadai "hands" into ידיה yadehah, "her hands".&lt;ref&gt;Psalm 22:17: circling around the problem again. Kristin M. Swenson. Journal of Biblical Literature. 123.4 (Winter 2004) p640.&lt;/ref&gt; Christian apologists argue that this passage refers to Jesus of Nazareth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.evidenceunseen.com/sample-page-2/?did=14&lt;/ref&gt;

====Psalm 34====
{{quote|"Many are the afflictions of the just man; but the Lord delivers him from all of them. He guards all his bones: not even one of them shall be broken." ({{bibleverse||Psalms|34:20|131}})}}

Ray Pritchard has described Psalm 34:20 as a messianic prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Pritchard ''What A Christian Believes: An Easy to Read Guide to Understanding'' chapter 3 Crossway Books {{ISBN|1-58134-016-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its account of the crucifixion of Jesus, the Gospel of John interprets it as a prophecy ({{bibleverse||John|19:36|131}}) and presents some of the details as fulfillment.
{{quote|"So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with Jesus; but when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water… For these things took place that the scripture might be fulfilled, ‘Not a bone of him shall be broken.’ And again another scripture says, ‘They shall look on him whom they have pierced’" ({{bibleverse||John|19:32-37|131}})}}

====Psalm 69====
{{quote|"They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink"}}
Christians believe that this verse refers to Jesus' time on the cross in which he was given a sponge soaked in vinegar to drink, as seen in [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2027:34;&amp;version=31; Matthew 27:34], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2015:23;&amp;version=31; Mark 15:23], and [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2019:29&amp;version=NIV; John 19:29].&lt;ref&gt;James Montgomery Boice and Philip Graham Ryken ''The Heart of the Cross'' pg 13 Crossway Books {{ISBN|1-58134-678-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Psalm 110====
Christian authors have interpreted Psalm 110 as a messianic passage in light of several New Testament passages.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert W. Bateman IV [http://faculty.gordon.edu/hu/bi/Ted_Hildebrandt/OTeSources/19-Psalms/Text/Articles/Bateman-Ps110-BS.pdf 'Psalm 110'.] ''[[Bibliotheca Sacra]]'' '''149''' (Oct. 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that this refers to Jesus of Nazareth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evidenceunseen.com/mt-2241-46-is-psalm-110-a-prophecy-of-jesus/|title=(Mt. 22:41-46) Is Psalm 110 a prophecy of Jesus? - Evidence Unseen|website=www.evidenceunseen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"A psalm of David.

1. The Lord says to my lord: ‘Sit at my right hand, till I make your enemies your footstool.’ &lt;br /&gt;
2. The Lord sends forth from Zion your mighty sceptre: ‘Rule in the midst of your foes! &lt;br /&gt;
3. With you is sovereignty in the splendor of holiness on the day of your birth: before the morning star, like the dew, I have begotten you.’ &lt;br /&gt;
4. The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind: ‘You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.’ &lt;br /&gt;
5. The Lord is at your right hand; he will shatter kings on the day of his wrath. &lt;br /&gt;
6. He will execute judgment among the nations, filling them with corpses; he will crush heads over the wide earth. &lt;br /&gt;
7. He will drink from the brook by the way; therefore he will lift up his head."

Verse 1. God speaks to David.  The first instance of "The LORD (Hebrew: YHWH)" in this verse is a translation of the Hebrew name of God, [[Yahweh]].  The second instance of "my lord (Hebrew: ADONI)" is David, from the viewpoint of the Psalmist.  The opening phrase of Psalm 110 is [[literal translation|literally]] translated as "Regarding David, a psalm," indicating that the psalm is "of" or "about" King David, not written by him.  The same introduction (τω δαυιδ ψαλμος) is used in the [[LXX]] version of Psalm 110 (which is Psalm 109 in the [[Psalm#Numbering|Greek text]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bibledatabase.net/html/septuagint/19_109.htm|title=Online Greek OT (Septuagint/LXX) UTF8 Bible. Psalms Chapter 109:1-7.|website=bibledatabase.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the New Testament, the gospel writers leave out the portion "regarding David, a psalm" and reinterprets the remaining out of context verse as a messianic prophecy: "while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question, saying, ‘What do you think of the Christ? Whose son is he?’ They said to him, ‘The son of David.’ He said to them, ‘How is it then that David in the Spirit calls him Lord, saying, ''The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand, till I put thy enemies under thy feet''? If David thus calls him Lord, how is he his son?’ And no one was able to answer him a word" (Matthew 22: 41-46). The remaining portion of this verse speaks of how David shall be seated at God's right hand, with his enemies thoroughly defeated. Although Hebrew has no capital letters, the Hebrew translation of that passage reads "The Lord said to my ''lord''" indicating that it is not speaking of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outreachjudaism.org/psalm110.html|title='The Lord Said to My Lord…' To Whom Was the Lord Speaking in Psalm 110:1? - Outreach Judaism|website=www.outreachjudaism.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"A royal psalm(see Ps.2 intro). It is quite difficult because v.3 is totally obscure, and the psalm speakers often. In Christian interpretation, it is understood as a reference to Jesus, as a messianic and sometimes eschatological psalm; Radak polemicizes against this view"
1. Here God is speaking to the king, called my ''lord''; Perhaps these are the words spoken by a prophet. The king is very proximate to God, in a position of privilege, imagined as being on His ''right hand'' in the [[Divine Council]]. The second-in-command was seated to the right of the king in the ancient Near East. Such images are rare in psalms, but see Ps45:7. If the king trods on the back of his enemies (see Josh. 10:24), they poetically become his "Footstool" 2. In contrast to v.1, God is spoken of in the third person. The Zion tradition (see Isa. 2:1-4; 60:1-22) and royal tradition are here connected. While v.1-2 express the great power of the king, they also emphasize it comes from God" (YHWH).&lt;ref&gt;The Jewish Study Bible: Featuring The Jewish Publications Society Tanakh Translation Oxford University Press / 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===II Samuel 7:14===
Hebrews 1:5 quotes this verse as, "I will be his Father, and he will be my Son.". However, the verse doesn’t end with the phrase quoted in the New Testament, but continues: "When he does wrong, I will punish him with the rod of men, with floggings inflicted by men." Christians see Jesus as taking on the sins of all humanity.  Therefore, Jesus "did wrong" by accepting the sins of the world.&lt;ref&gt;2 Cor. 5:21, 1 Peter 2:21-22&lt;/ref&gt; The Old Testament verse is referring to [[Solomon]].&lt;ref name="jewsforjudaism"&gt;[http://www.jewsforjudaism.org/web/pdf/EnglishHandbook.pdf] English Handbook Page 34 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529001843/http://www.jewsforjudaism.org/web/pdf/EnglishHandbook.pdf |date=May 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1 Chronicles 22:9-10&lt;/ref&gt; Given the reference to Solomon, Christians argue, Solomon is thus seen as prophetically typifying Jesus.

&lt;poem&gt;Let us lie in wait for the righteous man,
because he is inconvenient to us and opposes our actions;
he reproaches us for sins against the law,
and accuses us of sins against our training.
He professes to have knowledge of God,
and calls himself a child of the Lord.
He became to us a reproof of our thoughts;
the very sight of him is a burden to us,
because his manner of life is unlike that of others,
and his ways are strange.
We are considered by him as something base,
and he avoids our ways as unclean;
he calls the last end of the righteous happy,
and boasts that God is his father.
Let us see if his words are true,
and let us test what will happen at the end of his life;
for if the righteous man is God’s son, he will help him,
and will deliver him from the hand of his adversaries.
Let us test him with insult and torture,
that we may find out how gentle he is,
and make trial of his forbearance.
Let us condemn him to a shameful death,
for, according to what he says, he will be protected."–{{bibleref2|Wisdom|2:12-20|RSVCE}}&lt;/poem&gt;

The Gospel of John links this verse to the account of Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem: "took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet Him, and began to shout, "Hosanna! BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD, even the King of Israel." Jesus, finding a young donkey, sat on it; as it is written, "FEAR NOT, DAUGHTER OF ZION; BEHOLD, YOUR KING IS COMING, SEATED ON A DONKEY’S COLT." " {{bibleverse||John|12:13-15|NASB}}

The [[Synoptic Gospels]] make clear that Jesus arranged this event, thus consciously fulfilling the prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;D. A. Carson, The Gospel According to John (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1991), page 433.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gospel of Matthew]] describes Jesus' triumphant entry on [[Palm Sunday]] as a fulfillment of this verse in [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]]. Matthew describes the prophecy in terms of a [[colt (horse)|colt]] and a separate donkey, whereas the original only mentions the colt; the reference in Zechariah is a Jewish [[Parallelism (grammar)|parallelism]] referring only to a single animal, and the gospels of [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], and [[Gospel of John|John]] state Jesus sent his disciples after only one animal.&lt;ref&gt;Mark 11:1-7, Luke 19:30-35, John 12: 14-15&lt;/ref&gt; Several explanations have been suggested, such as that Matthew misread the original, the existence of the foal is implied, or he wanted to create a deliberate echo of a reference in 2 Samuel 16:1-4, where there are two asses for David's household to ride on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Matthew: a shorter commentary |last=Allison |first=Dale C. |year=2004 |publisher=Continuum International |pages=344+345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the most ancient Jewish writings Zechariah 9:9 is applied to the Messiah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feinberg|first1=Charles L|title=God Remembers: A Study of Zechariah|publisher=Wipf and Stock|isbn=1592442722|pages=167–168|url=https://bible.org/seriespage/lesson-12-rejoice-your-king-coming-zechariah-99-10-and-matthew-211-11|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Talmud, so firm was the belief in the ass on which the Messiah is to ride that "if anyone saw an ass in his dream, he will see salvation".&lt;ref&gt;Ber. 56b&lt;/ref&gt;{{request quotation|date=October 2011}} The verse is also Messianically quoted in Sanh. 98 a, in Pirqé de R. Eliez. c. 31, and in several of the [[Midrash]]im.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

====Zechariah 12:10====
[[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] 12:10 is another verse commonly cited by Christian authors as a messianic prophecy fulfilled by Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Hiers [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3262987 Journal of Biblical Literature, Vol. 90, No. 1 (Mar., 1971) ''Requires subscription for full content'']&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplication; and they shall look unto Me because they have thrust him through; and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his first-born." {{bibleverse||Zec|12:10|JPS}}}}

In some of the most ancient Jewish writings, Zechariah 12:10 is applied to the [[Messiah ben Joseph]] in the Talmud,&lt;ref&gt;Sukk. 52a&lt;/ref&gt;{{request quotation|date=October 2011}} and so is verse 12 ("The land will wail, each family by itself: The family of the House of David by themselves, and their women by themselves; the family of the House of Nathan by themselves, and their women by themselves"), there being, however, a difference of opinion whether the mourning is caused by the death of the Messiah ben Joseph, or else on account of the evil concupiscence (''[[Yetzer hara]]'').{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The [[Gospel of John]] makes reference to this prophecy when referring to the crucifixion of Jesus, as can be seen in the following account: "So the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first man and of the other who was crucified with Him; but coming to Jesus, when they saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs. But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out. And he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he is telling the truth, so that you also may believe. For these things came to pass to fulfill the Scripture, "NOT A BONE OF HIM SHALL BE BROKEN." And again another Scripture says, "THEY SHALL LOOK ON HIM WHOM THEY PIERCED." " {{bibleverse||John|19:32-37|NASB}}

==Debate about prophecy fulfillment==
Among Christian believers, opinion varies as to which Old Testament passages are messianic prophecies and which are not, and whether the prophecies they claim to have been fulfilled are intended to be prophecies. The authors of these Old Testament "prophecies" often appear to be describing events that had already occurred. For example, the New Testament verse {{bibleref|Matthew|2:14}} states, ''"So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt, 15 where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: 'Out of Egypt I called my son.'"'' This is referring to the Old Testament verse [[Hosea]] 11:1. However, that passage reads, "''When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son.''" Skeptics say that the Hosea passage clearly is talking about a historical event and therefore the passage clearly is not a prophecy.

According to modern scholarship, the suffering servant described in Isaiah chapter 53 is actually the Jewish people.&lt;ref name="j-interrupted"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beckwith2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Isbon T.

As noted above, there is some controversy about the phrase "[[they have pierced my hands and my feet]]".

For modern Bible scholars, either the verses make no claim of predicting future events, or the verses make no claim of speaking about the Messiah.&lt;ref name="ehrman-guide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="j-interrupted"/&gt;

===Response===
Different explanations are offered for why these types of passages should be considered prophecies, depending on the particular passage.

====''Remez'' interpretation method====
{{see also|Context (language use)}}
Jewish interpretive techniques often look for a "hint" at a deeper meaning; this "hint" is known as ''remez'' in Hebrew. Because the New Testament writers were fluent in [[biblical Hebrew]],{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} sometimes they are using a play on Hebrew words in the original [[Tanakh]] that is not obvious to Greek scholars and translators or to English-speaking readers. One example is Matthew saying at {{bibleref|Matthew|2:23}} "and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets: 'He will be called a Nazarene.'" The words "[[Nazareth]]" and "[[Nazarene (title)|Nazarene]]" do not occur in the Old Testament. Juster opines that Matthew is hinting at two Hebrew words: the root ''n-z-r'', meaning "branch", and "[[Nazarite]]".{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Another possible explanation offered is that such a prophecy once existed in the biblical texts but was lost. This theory is supported by the fact that such a verse exists in a copy of Samuel found among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].&lt;ref&gt;Craig S. Keener. ''A commentary on the Gospel of Matthew.'' Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1999. pg. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

In the debate on the [[Ethics of cloning|morality of human cloning]], Christians take multiple positions. Since [[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly]] the sheep was successfully cloned on 5 July 1996, and the possibility of cloning humans became a reality, Christian leaders have been pressed to take an ethical stance on its [[morality]]. While many Christians tend to disagree with the practice, such as [[Roman Catholics]] and a majority of [[fundamentalist]] pastors, including [[Southern Baptists]], the views taken by various other [[Christian denominations]] are diverse and often conflicting.&lt;ref name=Weasel&gt;Weasel, Lisa H., and Eric Jensen. "Language and Values in the Human Cloning Debate: A Web-based Survey of Scientists and Christian Fundamentalist Pastors." New Genetics and Society 24.1 (2005): 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; It is hard to pinpoint any one, definite stance of the Christian religion, since there are so many [[Christian denominations]] and so few official statements from each of them concerning the morality of human cloning.

There are certain [[Protestant denominations]] that do not disagree with the acceptability of [[human cloning]]. Mary Seller, for example, a member of the Church of England's Board of Social Responsibility and a professor of developmental genetics, states, "Cloning, like all science, must be used responsibly. Cloning humans is not desirable. But cloning sheep has its uses."&lt;ref name=Weasel/&gt; On the other hand, according to a survey of Christian fundamentalist pastors, responses indicated a "common account of human cloning as primarily reproductive in nature, proscribed by its violation of God's will and role."&lt;ref name=Weasel/&gt; Many of these pastors acknowledged the reason for this violation being rooted in the religiously motivated view that human cloning is an example of scientists 'playing God.'"&lt;ref name=Weasel/&gt; It is not only this that many Christians are concerned about, however; other concerns include whether the dignity of the human person is overlooked, as well as the role of the parents as co-creators. All of these things may contribute to why many fundamentalist Christian pastors see human reproductive cloning as simply "forbidden territory."&lt;ref name=Weasel/&gt;

==Understanding Cloning==

Some scientists do argue that the puberty of views comes from the differing understandings of what exactly [[human cloning]] is. In Weasel and Jensen's survey on "Language and Values," they found that Christian pastors used a "consistent emphasis on [[DNA]]."&lt;ref name=Weasel/&gt; Scientists describing the same processes used terminology such as, "insert an isolated [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] from the donor to produce a dividing and viable [[embryo]]" into an enulceated egg"&lt;ref name=Weasel/&gt; One reason why Christian [[fundamentalist]] pastors would be more apt to use terminology which includes "[[DNA]]" more prominently is that DNA is a "value-laden" term which carries religious significance.&lt;ref name=Weasel/&gt; Therefore, not only is DNA often equated, in religious circles, with one's genetic identity, but also with one's singular, "God-given" identity.

===Therapeutic Cloning===

Another point of misunderstanding arises in the separation of human [[reproductive cloning]] and [[therapeutic cloning]]. While most Christians do not support reproductive cloning, therapeutic cloning is a branch of cloning which has garnered slightly more support from certain denominations. Some Christian traditions, such as the [[United Church of Christ]], believe that cloning can be conducted ethically for this purpose, in order to help treat disease and improve the public health, as they do not see the fertilized [[ovum]] as constituting a person. Courtney Campbell, director of the Program for Ethics, Science and the Environment at [[Oregon State University]], says, "Some traditions and leading figures in conservative Protestantism who were opposed to human cloning for reproductive reasons have come to see that given the ambiguity about their own views about the status of embryonic life, and given the potential for health benefits, they could be opposed to reproductive cloning, but affirm therapeutic cloning.&lt;ref name=Sullivan&gt;Sullivan, Bob. "Beyond Dolly: Human Cloning; Religions Reveal Little Consensus on Human Cloning." ''msnbc.com.'' 25 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason, she says, is the tradition of emphasizing the individual choice over central dogma.

Catholic support for therapeutic cloning is conditional on the stipulation that it does not involve any kind of infringement upon human embryos. [[John Paul II]] states, "These techniques, insofar as they involve the manipulation and destruction of human embryos, are not morally acceptable, even when their proposed goal is good in itself."&lt;ref name=Delegation&gt;John Paul II. Intervention by the Holy See Delegation at the Special Committee of the 57th General Assembly of the United Nations on Human Embryonic Cloning. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, according to the Catholic ethical system, even a good that might come from therapeutic cloning would be morally unacceptable, as it would be the result of an act which, according to Catholics, is itself intrinsically immoral. This, for many Christians, is hard to abide by, for, as one Professor of Christian Ethics states, "our society is preoccupied with death and the pursuit of health seems to justify anything."&lt;ref name= Fink&gt;Fink, Rachel. “Cloning, Stem Cells, and the Current National Debate: Incorporating Ethics into a Large Introductory Biology Course.” Cell Biology Education. 1.132-144 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Church of England]] put out a statement on the Church's website which reads, "human reproductive cloning was made unlawful by the [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990]]. Few members of the Church of England would dissent from such a position. However, therapeutic cloning may be thought of as ethical, as it does not result in another human being."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.churchofengland.org/our-views/medical-ethics-health-social-care-policy/hfea/cloning.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while reproductive cloning is again discouraged, therapeutic cloning is more acceptable.

In a statement given by the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]], on the other hand, therapeutic cloning was rejected as "contrary to the Word of God and our 1998 resolution.".&lt;ref name=Lutheran&gt;Kieschnick, Rev. Gerald B. “Statement on Cloning.” Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod. http://www.nprcouncil.org/pressreleases/cloning-lutheran.htm&lt;/ref&gt; For this particular group, therapeutic cloning is assumed to involve the destruction of human embryos, and is therefore against the [[Synod]]'s resolution to "reaffirm and celebrate life," and "protect the sanctity of human life."&lt;ref name=Lutheran/&gt;

==Dignity of the Human Person==

Christian organizations are challenged to respond to a number of concerns about the issue of the [[dignity]] of the human person, especially in relation to scientific study. Much of the debate has to do with the question of at what point the [[soul]] enters the body. Catholics believe that the soul enters the body at the moment of conception when the [[sperm]] and [[egg (biology)|egg]] unite.&lt;ref name="Mlsna"&gt;

[[Online Computer Library Center|OCLC]]:{{OCLC|54703225}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Catholics and other Christian denominations that share this belief may see embryonic cloning as tantamount to live human experimentation and therefore contrary to God's will.

Most Christians believe that a person has intrinsic [[dignity]] based on his being created in the image and likeness of [[God]] and in his call to communion with God.&lt;ref name= Spes&gt;Second Vatican Council, ''Gaudium et spes'': The Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World. 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; This brings the question of the [[morality]] of [[human cloning]] into a realm beyond that of [[science]], and into that of [[religion]], as this dignity cannot be [[empirically]] proven.

===Defining Dignity===

Many Christians that do not agree on an exact definition of "[[dignity]]," which leads some scientists to ignore this concern, seeing it as a vague excuse that some Christians use to justify cloning bans&lt;ref&gt;Caulfield, Timothy. "Human Cloning Laws, Human Dignity and the Poverty of the Policy Making Dialogue." BMC Medical Ethics 3.4 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Or, if a definition is agreed upon, it may be challenged as being too weak, so that, according to Steven Pinker, a Professor of Psychology at Harvard University, it is "hardly up to the heavyweight moral demands assigned to it."&lt;ref&gt;Pinker, Steven. “The Stupidity of Dignity.” The New Republic. (2008) http://www.tnr.com/article/the-stupidity-dignity.&lt;/ref&gt;

The belief in intrinsic [[dignity]], nonetheless, leads the Christians who hold this belief to also argue that if the [[soul]] enters the body at the moment when the [[sperm]] and the [[egg (biology)|egg]] unite, producing cloned [[zygotes]] that are unlikely to survive is equivalent to murder. Therefore, if one believes, as Catholics do, that the zygotes have souls and are therefore human, in the words of [[John Paul II]], "regardless of the objective for which it was done, human embryonic cloning conflicts with the international legal norms that protect human dignity."&lt;ref name=Delegation/&gt; Some Christian conservatives even express concern that cloned embryos would have no soul, since it is, in their view, born outside of God's parameters,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spreadinglight.com/contemporary/cloning.html&lt;/ref&gt; as its creation is in a laboratory setting rather than natural conception.

Certain Christians also hold that, in the act of creating a human being, his or her dignity is also upheld by the presence of a loving union between the two partners, so that "only when love exists should the creation of other persons be envisaged."&lt;ref name= Calum&gt;MacKellar, Calum. "Creation- A Bond of Love?" Science &amp; Christian Belief 16.1 (2004), 52&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, "divine creation and co-creation are similar."&lt;ref name=Calum/&gt; In the act of scientific [[cloning]], however, the [[embryo]] is a result of the artificial union of the [[sperm]] and the [[egg (biology)|egg]], so that "the presence of love between the co-creators does not exist."&lt;ref name= Calum/&gt; Thus, according to this view, the dignity of the person is not upheld. Rev. Demetri Demopulos, [[Greek Orthodox]] [[pastor]] and [[geneticist]], states, "As an [[Orthodox Christian]], I speak out in opposition to any attempt to clone a human being because humans are supposed to be created by acts of love between two people, not through the manipulation of cells in acts that are ultimately about self-love."

===Playing God===

Much of the concern related to human cloning stems from a fear of overstepping the bounds of the natural order. Through the act of creating another human being, Christians have also posed the question as to whether this would be too much like playing God.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Peter. "The Intrepid Ethicist." Free Inquiry 20.4 (2000): 44-47&lt;/ref&gt; Not only this, but some Christian [[ethicists]] argue that human cloning would "create substantial issues of identity and individuality."&lt;ref name="Fink"/&gt; This could be seen through the confusion of the child resulting from cloning as to who his parents are, what connection he has to his genetic duplicate, etc.

===Role of Cloning in Society===

Despite the ethical gray area surrounding the act of cloning itself, most, if not all Christians, still hold that children who may result from the process should be loved and cared for as much as any other child, since they would be considered fully human&lt;ref name= Calum/&gt; and therefore reflect the [[Divine]] image, as defined by ''[[Gaudium et spes]]'', a document of the Second Vatican Council.&lt;ref name= Spes/&gt; However, according to Richard McCormick, [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]], cloning disrupts the familial order. It "would involve removing [[insemination]] and [[fertilization]] from the marriage relationship, and it would also remove one of the partners from the entire process."According to Stephen G. Post, a Catholic journalist, "[removal] of the male impregnators from the procreative [[Dyad (sociology)|dyad]] would simply drive the nail into the coffin of fatherhood, unless one thinks that biological and social fatherhood are utterly disconnected."&lt;ref&gt;Post, Stephen G. "The Judeo-Christian Case Against Human Cloning." ''America'' 176.21 (1997), 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Rev. Demetri Demopulos, [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] pastor and [[geneticist]]:

:"As an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]], I speak out in opposition to any attempt to clone a human being because humans are supposed to be created by [[sexual intercourse|acts of love]] between two people, not through the manipulation of [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s in acts that are ultimately about self-love."

Richard McCormick, a [[Jesuit]] priest and professor of Christian [[ethics]] at the [[University of Notre Dame]]:

:"I can’t think of a morally acceptable reason to clone a human being."

Mary Seller, a member of [[Church of England]]'s Board of Social Responsibility and a professor of developmental genetics:

:"Cloning, like all [[science]], must be used responsibly. Cloning humans is not desirable. But cloning [[sheep]] has its uses."

[[Pope John Paul II]]:

:"These techniques, insofar as they involve the manipulation and destruction of human embryos, are not morally acceptable, even when their proposed goal is good in itself."

[[United Church of Christ]] Committee on [[Genetics]]:

:"It is very likely that [with nuclear transfer cloning], [[scientist]]s could learn a great deal about basic human [[developmental biology]] and that this knowledge might someday lead to treatments for degenerative conditions or to counteract some forms of [[infertility|sterility]]. ... Various [[General Synod]]s of the [[United Church of Christ]] have regarded the human pre-embryo as due great respect [but not] regarded the pre-embryo as the equivalent of a person. Therefore, we ... do not object categorically to human pre-embryo research [under certain conditions]."

Ben Mitchellin, assistant professor of Christian [[ethics]] at [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] Theological Seminary:

:"The time is right for an outright ban on the production of cloned human embryos from [[fertilization]] to [[birth]], regardless of how the research is funded. The vast majority of the American public favors a ban on both privately funded and publicly funded research."

{{Catholic Ecumenical Councils}}
[[File:Saint James the Just.jpg|thumb|right|[[James, brother of Jesus|James the Just]], whose judgment was adopted in the Apostolic Decree of {{bibleverse||Acts|15:19–29}}, c. 78 AD: "we should write to them [Gentiles] to abstain only from things polluted by [[Idolatry and Christianity|idols]] and from [[Fornication#Christianity|fornication]] and from whatever has been strangled and from [[Taboo food and drink#Blood|blood]]..." ([[NRSV]])]]
{{Bible related}}

The '''Council of Jerusalem''' or '''Apostolic Council''' was held in [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] around AD 50. It is unique among the [[Ancient church councils (pre-ecumenical)|ancient pre-ecumenical councils]] in that it is considered by [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] and [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] to be a prototype and forerunner of the later [[ecumenical council]]s and a key part of [[Christian ethics]]. The council decided that [[Gentile]] converts to Christianity were not obligated to keep most of the [[Law of Moses]], including the rules concerning [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision of males]]. The Council did, however, retain the prohibitions on eating [[Taboo food and drink#Blood|blood]], [[Taboo food and drink#Blood|meat containing blood]], and meat of animals not properly slain, and on [[Porneia|fornication]] and [[Idolatry and Christianity|idolatry]], sometimes referred to as the Apostolic Decree or Jerusalem Quadrilateral.

Accounts of the council are found in [[Acts of the Apostles]] chapter 15 (in two different forms, the [[Acts of the Apostles#Manuscripts|Alexandrian and Western versions]]) and also possibly in [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]'s [[Epistle to the Galatians|letter to the Galatians]] chapter 2.&lt;ref&gt;Whether or not Galatians 2:1–10 is a record of the ''Council of Jerusalem'' or a different event is not agreed. Paul writes of laying his gospel before the others "privately", not in a Council. It has been argued that Galatians was written as Paul was on his way to the Council (see [[Paul the Apostle]]). [[Raymond E. Brown]] in his ''Introduction to the New Testament'' argues that they (Acts 15 and Galatians 2) are the same event but each from a different viewpoint with its own bias.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars dispute that Galatians 2 is about the Council of Jerusalem (notably because Galatians 2 describes a private meeting) while other scholars dispute the [[historical reliability of the Acts of the Apostles]].

==Historical background==
{{See also|Biblical law in Christianity#History and background|Circumcision controversy in early Christianity#Jewish background}}
The Council of Jerusalem is generally dated to 48 AD, roughly 15 to 25 years after the [[crucifixion of Jesus]], between [[Chronology of Jesus|26 and 36 AD]]. Acts 15 and Galatians 2 both suggest that the meeting was called to debate whether or not male Gentiles who were converting to become followers of Jesus were required to become [[religious male circumcision|circumcised]]; [[circumcision]] was considered repulsive during the period of [[Hellenization]] of the [[Eastern Mediterranean]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=514&amp;letter=C&amp;search=circumcision#2 Jewish Encyclopedia: Circumcision: In Apocryphal and Rabbinical Literature]: "Contact with Grecian life, especially at the games of the arena [which involved nudity], made this distinction obnoxious to the Hellenists, or antinationalists; and the consequence was their attempt to appear like the Greeks by [[epispasm]] ("making themselves foreskins"; I Macc. i. 15; Josephus, "Ant." xii. 5, § 1; Assumptio Mosis, viii.; I Cor. vii. 18; Tosef., Shab. xv. 9; Yeb. 72a, b; Yer. Peah i. 16b; Yeb. viii. 9a). All the more did the law-observing Jews defy the edict of [[Antiochus Epiphanes]] prohibiting circumcision (I Macc. i. 48, 60; ii. 46); and the Jewish women showed their loyalty to the Law, even at the risk of their lives, by themselves circumcising their sons." {{cite journal| last = Hodges| first = Frederick, M.| year = 2001| title = The Ideal Prepuce in Ancient Greece and Rome: Male Genital Aesthetics and Their Relation to Lipodermos, Circumcision, Foreskin Restoration, and the Kynodesme| journal = The Bulletin of the History of Medicine| volume = 75| issue = Fall 2001| pages = 375–405| url = http://www.cirp.org/library/history/hodges2/| format = PDF| accessdate = 2007-07-24| doi = 10.1353/bhm.2001.0119| pmid=11568485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, most followers of Jesus (which historians refer to as [[Jewish Christians]]) were Jewish by birth and even [[Proselyte|converts]] would have considered the [[early Christians]] as a part of [[Judaism]]. According to [[Alister McGrath]], the Jewish Christians affirmed every aspect of the then contemporary [[Second Temple Judaism]] with the addition of the belief that Jesus was the [[Messiah]].&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, Alister E., Christianity: An Introduction. Blackwell Publishing (2006). {{ISBN|1-4051-0899-1}}. Page 174: "In effect, they [Jewish Christians] seemed to regard Christianity as an affirmation of every aspect of contemporary Judaism, with the addition of one extra belief — that Jesus was the Messiah."&lt;/ref&gt; Unless males were circumcised, they could not be [[People of God|God's People]]. The meeting was called to decide whether circumcision for gentile converts was requisite for community membership since certain individuals were teaching that {{nobreak|"[u]nless}} you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Acts|15:1–2|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Circumcision as a mandate was associated with [[Abraham]] (see also [[Abrahamic covenant]]), but it is cited as "the custom of Moses" because Moses is considered the traditional giver of the Law as a whole. The circumcision mandate was made more official and binding in the [[Mosaic covenant|Mosaic Law Covenant]]. In {{bibleref2|John|7:22}} the words of Jesus are reported to be that Moses gave the people circumcision.

==Issues and outcome==
The purpose of the meeting, according to Acts, was to resolve a disagreement in [[Early centers of Christianity#Antioch|Antioch]], which had wider implications than just circumcision, since circumcision is the "everlasting" sign of the [[Abrahamic covenant|Abrahamic Covenant]] ({{bibleverse||Genesis|17:9–14}}). Some of the [[Pharisees]] who had become believers insisted that it was "needful to circumcise them, and to command [them] to keep the [[613 Mitzvot|law of Moses]]"  ([[KJV]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|15:5|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary issue which was addressed related to the requirement of [[Circumcision in the Bible|circumcision]], as the author of Acts relates, but other important matters arose as well, as the Apostolic Decree indicates. The dispute was between those, such as the followers of the "Pillars of the Church", led by [[James, brother of Jesus|James]], who believed, following his interpretation of the [[Great Commission]], that the church must observe the [[Torah]], i.e. the rules of traditional [[Judaism]],{{ref|1}} and [[Paul the Apostle]], who believed there was no such necessity. (See also [[Supersessionism]], [[New Covenant]], [[Antinomianism]], [[Hellenistic Judaism]], [[Paul the Apostle and Judaism]].)

At the Council, following advice offered by [[Simon Peter]] ({{bibleref|Acts|15:7–11|NIV}} and {{bibleref|Acts|15:14|NIV}}), Barnabas and Paul gave an account of their ministry among the gentiles ({{bibleref|Acts|15:12|NIV}}), and the apostle [[James, brother of Jesus|James]] quoted from the words of the prophet [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] ({{bibleref|Acts|15:16–17|NIV}}, quoting {{bibleref|Amos|9:11–12|NIV}}). James added his own words&lt;ref&gt;[[John Gill (theologian)|Gill, J.]], Gill's Exposition of the Whole Bible http://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/15.htm accessed 13 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; to the quotation: "Known to God from eternity are all His works"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Acts|15:18|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then submitted a proposal, which was accepted by the Church and became known as the Apostolic Decree:
{{quote|It is my judgment, therefore, that we should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God. Instead we should write to them, telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals and from blood.{{ref|4}} For the law of Moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath. ({{bibleref|Acts|15:19–21|NIV}})}}

{{bibleref||Acts|15:23–29|NIV}} sets out the content of the letter written in accordance with James' proposal.

The [[Western text-type|Western version]] of Acts (see [[Acts of the Apostles#Manuscripts|Acts of the Apostles: Manuscripts]]) adds the negative form of the [[ethic of reciprocity|Golden Rule]] ("and whatever things ye would not have done to yourselves, do not do to another").{{ref|5}}

This determined questions wider than that of circumcision, particularly dietary questions, but also fornication and idolatry and blood, and also the application of [[Biblical law]] to non-Jews. It was stated by the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] and [[Elder (Christianity)|Elders]] in the Council: "the Holy Spirit and we ourselves have favored adding no further burden to you, except these necessary things, to abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication. If you carefully keep yourselves from these things, you will prosper." (Acts 15:27–28) And this Apostolic Decree was considered binding on all the other local Christian congregations in other regions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swrb.com/newslett/actualNLs/apopresby.htm Apostolic Presbyterianism ] – by [[William Cunningham (theologian)|William Cunningham]] and Reg Barrow&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Proselyte#Rules for proselytes in the Torah|Biblical law directed at non-Jews]], [[Seven Laws of Noah]], [[Biblical law in Christianity]], and the [[Ten Commandments#Christianity|Ten Commandments in Christianity]].

The writer of Acts gives an account of a restatement by James and the elders in Jerusalem of the contents of the letter on the occasion of Paul's final Jerusalem visit, immediately prior to Paul's arrest at the temple, recounting: "When we had come to Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly. On the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present." (Acts 21:17–18, [[English Standard Version|ESV]]) The elders then proceed to notify Paul of what seems to have been a common concern among Jewish believers, that he was teaching [[Diaspora]] Jewish converts to Christianity "to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or walk according to our customs." They remind the assembly that, "as for the Gentiles who have believed, we have sent a letter with our judgment that they should abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality". In the view of some scholars, the reminder of James and the elders here is an expression of concern that Paul was not fully teaching the decision of the Jerusalem Council's letter to Gentiles,&lt;ref&gt;Robert McQueen Grant ''Augustus to Constantine: the rise and triumph of Christianity in the Roman World'' Louisville: Westminster John Knox, 2004, p.iv "According to Acts 21:25, the elders at Jerusalem were still concerned with observance of them when Paul last "&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in regard to non-strangled ''[[kosher]]'' meat,&lt;ref&gt;Paul Barnett ''Jesus &amp; the Rise of Early Christianity: A History of New Testament'' p. 292 "He chided Paul later for his failure to require the Gentiles to observe the decree (Acts 21:25). Paul delivered the letter from the Jerusalem meeting expressing James's decree, but only to churches in Syria, Cilicia and Galatia ... Paul did not impose the food requirements for the kosher-killed meat and against the idol-sacrificed meat upon the Corinthians"&lt;/ref&gt; which contrasts with Paul's advice to Gentiles in Corinth,&lt;ref&gt;1 Corinthians: a new translation Volume 32 Anchor Bible William Fridell Orr, James Arthur Walther – 1976 "Paul's openness regarding dietary restrictions raises again the question of the connection with the decrees of the council at Jerusalem (Acts 15:29; Introduction, pp. 63–65). There is no hint here of an apostolic decree involving food."&lt;/ref&gt; to "eat whatever is sold in the meat markets" (1 Corinthians 10:25).&lt;ref&gt;Gordon D. Fee ''The First Epistle to the Corinthians'' 1987 p480 "Paul's "rule" for everyday life in Corinth is a simple one: "Eat anything sold in the meat market""&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpreting the Council's decision==
{{See also|Paul the Apostle and Judaism|Early Christianity}}
{{Jewish Christianity}}

James's "Apostolic Decree" was that the requirement of circumcision for males was not obligatory for Gentile converts, possibly in order to make it easier for them to join the movement. However, the Council did retain the prohibitions against Gentile converts eating meat containing blood, or meat of animals not properly slain. It also retained the prohibitions against "fornication" and "idol worship". The Decree may have been a [[List of events in early Christianity|major act of differentiation]] of the Church from its Jewish roots.

[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=245&amp;letter=N&amp;search=New%20Testament#717 Jewish Encyclopedia: New Testament — Spirit of Jewish Proselytism in Christianity] states:

{{quote|For great as was the success of Barnabas and Paul in the heathen world, the authorities in Jerusalem insisted upon circumcision as the condition of admission of members into the church, until, on the initiative of Peter, and of James, the head of the Jerusalem church, it was agreed that acceptance of the Noachian Laws—namely, regarding avoidance of idolatry, fornication, and the eating of flesh cut from a living animal—should be demanded of the heathen desirous of entering the Church.}}

[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=142&amp;letter=G#543 Jewish Encyclopedia: Gentiles: Gentiles May Not Be Taught the Torah] states:

{{quote|[[Jacob Emden|R. Emden]], in a remarkable apology for Christianity contained in his appendix to "Seder 'Olam" (pp. 32b-34b, Hamburg, 1752), gives it as his opinion that the original intention of Jesus, and especially of Paul, was to convert only the Gentiles to the [[Seven Laws of Noah|seven moral laws of Noah]] and to let the Jews follow the Mosaic law—which explains the apparent contradictions in the New Testament regarding the [[Biblical law in Christianity|laws of Moses]] and the [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]].}}

The [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] article on [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08537a.htm Judaizers] states:

{{quote|Paul, on the other hand, not only did not object to the observance of the Mosaic Law, as long as it did not interfere with the liberty of the Gentiles, but he conformed to its prescriptions when occasion required ({{bibleref|1Corinthians|9:20|NIV}}). Thus he shortly after circumcised Timothy ({{bibleref|Acts|16:1–3|NIV}}), and he was in the very act of observing the Mosaic ritual when he was arrested at Jerusalem ({{bibleref|Acts|21:26|KJV}} sqq.)}}

[[Joseph Fitzmyer]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Acts of the Apostles (The Anchor Yale Bible Commentaries)'', Yale University Press (December 2, 1998), {{ISBN|0-300-13982-9}}, chapter V&lt;/ref&gt; disputes the claim that the ''Apostolic Decree'' is based on ''Noahide Law'' ({{bibleverse||Gen|9}}) and instead proposes {{bibleverse||Lev|17–18}} as the basis, see also [[Leviticus 18]]. He also argues that the decision was meant as a practical compromise to help Jewish and Gentile Christians to get along, not a theological statement intended to bind Christians for all time.

According to the 19th-century Roman Catholic Bishop [[Karl Josef von Hefele]], the Apostolic Decree of the Jerusalem Council "has been obsolete for centuries in the [[Western Christianity|West]]", though it is still recognized and observed by the [[Greek Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Josef von Hefele]]'s [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.viii.v.iv.ii.html commentary on canon II of Gangra] notes: "We further see that, at the time of the Synod of [[Gangra]], the rule of the Apostolic Synod with regard to blood and things strangled was still in force. With the Greeks, indeed, it continued always in force as their Euchologies still show. [[Balsamon]] also, the well-known commentator on the canons of the Middle Ages, in his commentary on the sixty-third [[Canons of the Apostles|Apostolic Canon]], expressly blames the Latins because they had ceased to observe this command. What the Latin Church, however, thought on this subject about the year 400, is shown by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] in his work [[Contra Faustum]], where he states that the Apostles had given this command in order to unite the heathens and Jews in the one ark of Noah; but that then, when the barrier between Jewish and heathen converts had fallen, this command concerning things strangled and blood had lost its meaning, and was only observed by few. But still, as late as the eighth century, [[Pope Gregory III|Pope Gregory the Third]] (731) forbade the eating of blood or things strangled under threat of a penance of forty days. No one will pretend that the disciplinary enactments of any council, even though it be one of the undisputed [[Ecumenical council|Ecumenical Synods]], can be of greater and more unchanging force than the decree of that first council, held by the Holy Apostles at Jerusalem, and the fact that its decree has been obsolete for centuries in the West is proof that even Ecumenical canons may be of only temporary utility and may be repealed by disuse, like other laws."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dispensationalism#Start of the Church Age|Acts 28 Hyperdispensationalists]], such as the 20th century Anglican [[E. W. Bullinger]], would be another example of a group that believes the decree (and everything before Acts 28) no longer applies.

'''Dal Khalsa''' was the name of the [[Sikh]] army that operated in the 18th century (1735–1780) in the [[Punjab region]].

==History==

===Mughal Rule of Punjab===
The religion of [[Sikhism]] began at the time of the [[Babur#Conquest of Northern India|Conquest of Northern India]] by [[Babur]]. His grandson, [[Akbar]], supported religious freedom and after visiting the [[Langar (Sikhism)|langar]] of [[Guru Amar Das]] had a favorable impression of Sikhism. As a result of his visit he donated land to the langar and had a positive relationship with the [[Sikh gurus]] until his death in 1605.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kalsi|2005|pages=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; His successor, [[Jahangir]], saw the Sikhs as a political threat. He arrested [[Guru Arjan Dev]] because of Sikh support for [[Khusrau Mirza]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Markovits|2004|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ordered him to be put to death by torture. Guru Arjan Dev's [[martyrdom]] led the sixth Guru, [[Guru Har Gobind ji miri piri de malak]], to declare Sikh [[sovereignty]] in the creation of the [[Akal Takht]] and to establish a fort to defend [[Amritsar]].&lt;ref name="Jestice 2004 pages=345-346"&gt;{{harvnb|Jestice|2004|pages=345–346}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jahangir]] attempted to assert authority over the Sikh by jailing Guru Har Gobind at [[Gwalior]] and released him after some time with 52 others rajpoot (hindu)kings on Guru HarGobind's orders .Sikhism did not have any further issues with the [[Mughal Empire]] until the death of Jahangir in 1627. His successor, [[Shah Jahan]] "took offense" at Guru Har Gobind's sovereignty and after a series of assaults on Amritsar forced the Sikhs  to retreat to the [[Sivalik Hills]].&lt;ref name="Jestice 2004 pages=345-346"/&gt; Guru Har Gobind's successor, [[Guru Har Rai]] maintained the guruship in the Sivalik Hills by defeating local attempts to seize Sikh land and taking a neutral role in the power struggle between [[Aurangzeb]] and [[Dara Shikoh]] for control of the [[Timurid dynasty]]. The ninth Guru, [[Guru Tegh Bahadur]], moved the Sikh community to [[Anandpur Sahib|Anandpur]] and traveled extensively to visit and preach in Sikh communities in defiance of Aurangzeb, who attempted to install [[Ramraiya|Ram Rai]] to the guruship. He aided [[Kashmiris|Kashmiri]] [[Brahmin]]s in avoiding [[conversion to Islam]] and was arrested and confronted by Aurangzeb. When offered a choice between [[conversion or death]], he chose to die rather than compromise his principles and was executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johar|1975|pages=192–210}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guru Gobind Singh]], assumed the guruship in 1675 and to avoid battles with Sivalik Hill Rajas moved the gurship to [[Paonta Sahib|Paunta]]. He built a large fort to protect the city and garrisoned an army to protect it. The growing power of the Sikh community alarmed Sivalik Hill Rajas who attempted to attack the city but the Guru's forces routed them at the [[Battle of Bhangani]]. He moved on to [[Anandpur Sahib|Anandpur]] and established the [[Khalsa]], a collective army of baptized Sikhs, on March 30, 1699. The establishment of the Khalsa united the Sikh community against various Mughal-backed claimants to the guruship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jestice|2004|pages=312–313}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1701, a combined army composed of the Sivalik Hill Rajas and the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] army under [[Wazir Khan (Sirhind)|Wazir Khan]] attacked [[Anandpur Sahib|Anandpur]] and, following a retreat by the Khalsa, were defeated by the Khalsa at the [[Battle of Muktsar]]. In 1707, Guru Gobind Singh accepted an invitation by [[Bahadur Shah I]], Aurangzeb's successor to meet in southern India. When he arrived in [[Nanded]] in 1708, he was injured by agents of Wazir Khan, the governor of [[Sirhind]].  After this incident his wounds were stitched and he began to recover.  A few days after, some Sikhs brought a very stiff bow to present to Guru Gobind Singh. As they were discussing whether anybody would ever be able to put a string on the bow, Guru Gobind Singh accepted the challenge. Though the bow was stringed, due to the force he applied on the bow the wounds which were still fresh started bleeding profusely. Guru Gobind Singh then declared that he would be leaving for heavenly abode and asked his Sikhs to prepare for the cremation.

[[Banda Singh Bahadur]] was an [[ascetic]] who converted to Sikhism after meeting [[Guru Gobind Singh]] at [[Nanded]]. A short time before his death, Guru Gobind Singh ordered him to reconquer [[Punjab (region)|Punjab]] and gave him a letter that commanded all Sikhs to join him. After two years of gaining supporters, Banda Singh Bahadur initiated an agrarian uprising by breaking up the large estates of [[Zamindar#Mughal era|Zamindar families]] and distributing the land to the poor Sikh, Hindu, and Muslim peasants who farmed the land.&lt;ref name="Singh 2008 pages=25-26"&gt;{{harvnb|Singh|2008 |pages=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banda Singh Bahadur started his rebellion with the defeat of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] armies at [[Samana, India|Samana]] and [[Sadhaura]] and the rebellion culminated in the defeat of [[Sirhind]]. During the rebellion, Banda Singh Bahadur made a point of destroying the cities in which Mughals had been cruel to Sikhs, including executing [[Wazir Khan (Sirhind)|Wazir Khan]] in revenge for the deaths of [[Guru Gobind Singh]]'s sons after the Sikh victory at Sirhind.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nesbitt |2005 |page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ruled the territory between the [[Sutlej]] river and the [[Yamuna]] river, established a capital in the [[Himalayas]] at [[Lohgarh]], and struck coinage with the faces of [[Guru Nanak]] and Guru Gobind Singh.&lt;ref name="Singh 2008 pages=25-26"/&gt; In 1716, his army was defeated by the Mughals after he attempted to defend his fort at Gurdas Nangal. He was captured along with 700 of his men and sent to [[Delhi]] where he was tortured and executed after refusing to convert to Islam.

===Sivalik hills===

After 1716, the [[Mughal emperor]] [[Muhammad Shah]] began a campaign of [[genocide]] against Sikhs through his Governor of Lahore, [[Abdus Samad Khan]]. His son and, later, successor, [[Zakariya Khan Bahadur]] led a standing army dedicated to eliminating Sikhs, executed Sikhs publicly, and offered monetary rewards for the heads of killed Sikhs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Sikhs |last=Singh |first=Patwant |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2001 |publisher=Image |location= |isbn=978-0-385-50206-1 |page= |pages=78–79 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5i3FJTOvDXEC&amp;lpg=PT83&amp;dq=mughal%20genocide%20sikhs&amp;pg=PT83#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sikhs "retaliated by killing government functionaries and plundering Mughal posts, arsenals, and treasuries"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Sikhs |last=Singh |first=Patwant |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2001 |publisher=Image |location= |isbn=978-0-385-50206-1 |page=79 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5i3FJTOvDXEC&amp;lpg=PT83&amp;dq=mughal%20genocide%20sikhs&amp;pg=PT83#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; but could not assemble an army.&lt;ref name="Browne 1788 13"&gt;{{cite book |title=India tracts: containing a description of the Jungle Terry districts, their revenues, trade, and government: with a plan for the improvement of them.

From 1718-1738, the Sikhs carried out a [[guerrilla war]] against the Mughal Empire in the area around the [[Sivalik Hills]].&lt;ref name="Browne 1788 13"/&gt; Historian Josepeh Cunningham writes of the period: "The Sikhs were scarcely again heard of in history for the period of a generation".&lt;ref name="Cunningham 1918 89"/&gt;

===Dal Khalsa===
In 1733, [[Zakariya Khan Bahadur]] attempted to negotiate a peace with the Sikhs by offering them a [[jagir]], the title [[Nawab]] to their leader, and unimpeded access to the [[Harmandir Sahib]]. After discussion at a [[Sarbat Khalsa]], [[Nawab Kapur Singh|Kapur Singh]] was elected leader of the Sikhs and took the title of Nawab. Nawab Kapur Singh combined the various Sikh militias into two groups; the [[Taruna Dal]] and the [[Budda Dal]], which would collectively be known as the Dal Khalsa. Sikh militias over 40 years of age would be part of the Budda Dal and Sikh militas under 40 years were part of the Taruna Dal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singha|first=H. S.|title=Sikh Studies, Book 6|year=2005|publisher=Hemkunt Press|isbn=8170102588|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taruna Dal was further divided in five [[jathas]], each with 1300 to 2000 men and a separate drum and banner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Narang|first1=K.

However, in 1735, the agreement between Zakariya Khan and Nawab Kapur Singh broke down and the Dal Khalsa retreated to the [[Sivalik Hills]] to regroup.
Later the command of Dal Khalsa was taken by [[Jassa Singh Ahluwalia]] who was an able and powerful administrator, even bought India ([[Red Fort]]) under [[Khalsa]] flag.
He made the foundation of Khalsa firm for future generations to lead.

====Invasion of Nader Shah====
In 1738, [[Nader Shah]] of the [[Persia]]n [[Afsharid dynasty]] invaded [[Muhammad Shah]]'s [[Mughal Empire]]. Nadir Shah defeated the Mughal Empire in the [[Battle of Karnal]] and proceeded to sack [[Delhi]]. During the panic before and after the Battle of Karnal, important functionaries of the Mughal Empire fled Delhi but were intercepted by small jathas of the Dal Khalsa and relieved of their wealth.&lt;ref name="Cunningham 1918 89"/&gt; Nadir Shah then gave Muhammad Shah back his title of [[Mughal Emperor]] but took away his royal treasury, including the [[Peacock Throne]]. When Nadir Shah began his retreat, the Sikhs who had been seeking refuge in the [[Sivalik Hills]] came down from the mountains and mercilessly plundered the treasure of the Persian Army. Afterwards the Dal Khalsa established [[Fort Dallewal|a fort]] at [[Dallewal]] near the [[Ravi River|Ravi]] river and began levying taxes in the area around [[Lahore]].&lt;ref name="Browne 1788 13"/&gt;
During this period, the Muslim historian Nur Mohammed, though full of contempt for Sikhs, was constrained to pay tribute to them of their character, in the following words:

"In no case they would slay a coward, nor would they put an obstacle in the way of a fugitive. They do not plunder the wealth and ornaments of a woman, be she a well to do lady or a maid servant. There is no adultery among these dogs, nor are they mischievous people given to thieving. Whether a woman is young or old, they call her 'buriya' and asked her to get out of the way. The word 'buriya' in Indian language means 'an old lady'. There is no thief at all among these dogs, nor is there any house breaker born among these miscreants. They do not make friends with adulterers and house breakers, though their behaviors on the whole is not commendable."

[[File:Hortus Deliciarum, Der Tanz um das goldene Kalb.JPG|thumb|''[[The Adoration of the Golden Calf]]'' – Picture from the [[Hortus deliciarum]] of [[Herrad of Landsberg]] (12th century)]]
According to the [[Bible]], the '''golden calf''' (עֵגֶּל הַזָהָב '' ‘ēggel hazāhāv'') was an [[Idolatry|idol]] (a [[cult image]]) made by the [[Israelites]] during [[Moses]]' absence, when he went up to [[biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]]. In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], the incident is known as ''ḥēṭ’ ha‘ēggel'' (חֵטְא הַעֵגֶּל) or "The Sin of the Calf". It is first mentioned in {{bibleref2|Exodus|32:4}}.

[[Bull worship]] was common in many cultures. In Egypt, whence according to the [[The Exodus|Exodus narrative]] the Hebrews had recently come, the [[Apis (Egyptian mythology)|Apis Bull]] was a comparable object of worship, which some believe the Hebrews were reviving in the wilderness;&lt;ref&gt;The early Christian ''[[Apostolic Constitutions]]'', [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume VII/Constitutions of the Holy Apostles/Book VI/Sec. IV|vi. 4]] (c. 380), mentions that "the law is the decalogue, which the Lord promulgated to them with an audible voice, before the people made that calf which represented the Egyptian Apis."&lt;/ref&gt; alternatively, some believe the God of Israel was associated with or pictured as a calf/bull deity through the process of [[religious assimilation]] and [[syncretism]]. Among the Egyptians' and Hebrews' neighbors in the [[ancient Near East]] and in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], the [[aurochs]], the wild bull, was widely worshipped, often as the [[Bull (mythology)|Lunar Bull]] and as the creature of [[El (god)|El]].

==In the Book of Exodus==

[[File:The Worship of the Golden Calf (Filippino Lippi).jpg|thumb|right|''The Worship of the Golden Calf'' by [[Filippino Lippi]] (1457–1504)]]
When [[Moses]] went up into [[Biblical Mount Sinai]] to receive the [[Ten Commandments]] ({{bibleref|Exodus|24:12-18|9}}), he left the Israelites for [[forty days and forty nights]]. The Israelites feared that he would not return and demanded that [[Aaron]] make them "gods" to go before them ({{bibleref|Exodus|32:1|9}}). Aaron gathered up the Israelites' golden earrings and ornaments, constructed a "molten calf" and they declared: "These ''[be]'' thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt." (Exodus 32:4)

Aaron built an [[altar]] before the calf and proclaimed the next day to be a feast to the {{LORD}}. So they rose up early the next day and "offered [[Korban Olah|burnt-offerings]], and brought [[Slaughter offering|peace-offerings]]; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play." (Exodus 32:6) God told Moses what the Israelites were up to back in camp, that they had turned aside quickly out of the way which God commanded them and he was going to destroy them and start a new people from Moses. Moses besought and pleaded that they should be spared ({{bibleverse||Exodus|32:11-14|HE}}), and God "repented of the evil which He said He would do unto His people."

Moses went down from the mountain, but upon seeing the calf, he became angry and threw down the two [[Tablets of Stone]], breaking them. Moses burnt the golden calf in a fire, ground it to powder, scattered it on water, and forced the Israelites to drink it. When Moses asked him, Aaron admitted collecting the gold, and throwing it into the fire, and said it came out as a calf ({{bibleverse||Exodus|32:21-24|HE}}).

===Exclusion of the Levites and mass execution===
{{main|Levite}}
The Bible records that the [[tribe of Levi]] did not worship the golden calf. When Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said: 'Whosoever is on the {{LORD}}'s side, let him come unto me.' And all the [[Levite|sons of Levi]] gathered themselves together unto him. And he said unto them: 'Thus saith the {{LORD}}, the God of Israel: Put ye every man his sword upon his thigh, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.' And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses; and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. ({{bibleverse||Exodus|32:26-28|HE}})

==Other mentions in the Bible==
[[File:Tissot Moses Destroys the Tables of the Ten Commandments.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Moses destroying the tables (watercolor circa 1896–1902 by [[James Tissot]])]]
The golden calf is mentioned in {{bibleref2|Nehemiah|9:16–21|NIV}}.
{{quote|
"But they, our ancestors, became arrogant and stiff-necked, and they did not obey your commands. They refused to listen and failed to remember the miracles you performed among them. They became stiff-necked and in their rebellion appointed a leader in order to return to their slavery. But you are a forgiving God, gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love. Therefore you did not desert them, even when they cast for themselves an image of a calf and said, 'This is your god, who brought you up out of Egypt', or when they committed awful blasphemies. "Because of your great compassion you did not abandon them in the wilderness. By day the pillar of cloud did not fail to guide them on their path, nor the pillar of fire by night to shine on the way they were to take. You gave your good Spirit to instruct them. You did not withhold your manna from their mouths, and you gave them water for their thirst. For forty years you sustained them in the wilderness; they lacked nothing, their clothes did not wear out nor did their feet become swollen."}}

The language suggests that there are some inconsistencies in the other accounts of the Israelites and their use of the calf. As the version in Exodus and 1&amp;nbsp;Kings are written by [[Deuteronomist]]ic historians based in the southern kingdom of Judah, there is a proclivity to expose the Israelites as unfaithful. The inconsistency is primarily located in Exodus&amp;nbsp;32:4 where "gods" is plural despite the construction of a single calf. When Ezra retells the story, he uses the single, capitalized God.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, 2009, pg.&amp;nbsp;116–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, a more biblically conservative view offers a tenable explanation accounting for the discrepancy between "gods" in Exodus&amp;nbsp;32 and "God" in Nehemiah&amp;nbsp;9:18. In both instances, the Hebrew ''[[elohim]]'' is used.  Since ancient Hebrew failed to distinguish ''elohim'' God (known as the majestic plural) from ''elohim'' gods, Biblical translations are either determined by (a)&amp;nbsp;context or (b)&amp;nbsp;adjacent verb(s). In the original account in Exodus&amp;nbsp;32, the verb is in the 3rd&amp;nbsp;person plural. In Nehemiah&amp;nbsp;9, the verb connected to ''elohim'' is singular. For the JEDP (i.e. Deuteronomistic) theorist, this inconsistency is confirmatory since the theory maintains a roughly equivalent date for the composition of Exodus and Nehemiah. More conservative scholarship would argue that these two texts were composed about 1000&amp;nbsp;years apart: Exodus (by Moses) ''circa'' 1500&amp;nbsp;BCE, and Nehemiah ''circa'' 500&amp;nbsp;BCE. The biblically conservative framework would therefore account for the verbal inconsistency from Exodus to Nehemiah as an evolution in the use of language over the approximate millennium separating the two books.

==Jeroboam's golden calves at Bethel and Dan==
{{main|Jeroboam}}
[[Image:Worshiping the golden calf.jpg|thumb|right|Worshiping the Golden Calf]]
According to {{bibleref2|1 Kings|12:26–30|NIV}}, after [[Jeroboam]] establishes the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|northern Kingdom of Israel]], he contemplates the sacrificial practices of the Israelites.
{{quote|
Jeroboam thought to himself, "The kingdom will now likely revert to the house of David. If these people go up to offer sacrifices at the temple of the {{LORD}} in Jerusalem, they will again give their allegiance to their lord, Rehoboam king of Judah. They will kill me and return to King Rehoboam." After seeking advice, the king made two golden calves. He said to the people, "It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Here are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt." One he set up in Bethel, and the other in [[Dan (ancient city)|Dan]]. And this thing became a sin; the people came to worship the one at Bethel and went as far as Dan to worship the other.}}

His concern was that the tendency to offer sacrifices in Jerusalem, which is in the southern [[Kingdom of Judah]], would lead to a return to King [[Rehoboam]]. He makes two golden calves and places them in [[Bethel]] and [[Dan (ancient city)|Dan]]. He erects the two calves in what he figures (in some interpretations) as substitutes for the ''[[cherub]]im'' built by [[King Solomon]] in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, pg. 117, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Elliott Friedman]] says "at a minimum we can say that the writer of the golden calf account in Exodus seems to have taken the words that were traditionally ascribed to Jeroboam and placed them in the mouths of the people." Friedman believes that the story was turned into a [[polemic]], exaggerating the throne platform decoration into idolatry, by a family of priests sidelined by Jeroboam.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Richard Elliott "Who Wrote the Bible?" 1987 pp 72–3&lt;/ref&gt;

The declarations of Aaron and Jeroboam are almost identical: 
* 'These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt' (Exod 32:4, 8);
* 'Behold your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt (1 Kings 12:28)
After making the golden calf or golden calves both Aaron and Jeroboam celebrate festivals. Aaron builds an altar and Jeroboam ascends an altar (Exod 32:5–6; 1 Kings 12:32–33).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harvey|first1=John E.|title=Retelling the Torah: the Deuteronomistic historian's use of Tetrateuchal Narratives|date=2004|publisher=T &amp; T Clark International|location=New York; London|page=2|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/retelling-the-torah-the-deuteronomistic-historians-use-of-tetrateuchal-narratives/oclc/276852204}}: "The subsequent declarations of Aaron's people and Jeroboam are almost identical: 'These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt' (Exod 32:4, 8); 'Behold your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish views==
[[File:Book of Exodus Chapter 33-8 (Bible Illustrations by Sweet Media).jpg|thumb|The Levites killed about 3,000 Israelites who worshipped the Golden Calf (1984 illustration by Jim Padgett)]]
In ''[[Legends of the Jews]]'', the Conservative rabbi and scholar [[Louis Ginzberg]] wrote that the worship of the golden calf was the disastrous consequence for Israel who took a mixed multitude in [[The Exodus|their exodus]] from Egypt. Had not the mixed multitude joined them, Israel would not have been misled to worship this molten idol. The form of calf itself came from a magical virtue of an ornament leaf with the image of the bull which is made by [[Aaron]].&lt;ref name=Ginzberg&gt;Ginzberg, Louis (1909). ''The Legends of the Jews Volume III : The Golden Calf'' (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society&lt;/ref&gt;

The devotion of Israel to this worship of the calf was partly explained by a circumstance at [[Crossing the Red Sea|passing through the Red Sea]], when they beheld the most distinct creature about the Celestial Throne which is the resemblance of ox, then they thought it was an ox who had helped God in their journey from Egypt.&lt;ref name=Ginzberg/&gt; After seeing [[Hur (Bible)|Hur]] son of [[Miriam]] who was carelessly murdered by the people following his rebuke of their ingratitude action to God, [[Aaron]] was willing rather to take a sin upon himself to make an idol than to cast the burden of an evil deed upon the people if they commit so terrible sin of killing a priest and prophet among them.&lt;ref name=Ginzberg/&gt;

Also there would be among the Israelites no [[priestly caste]], and the nation would have been a nation of priests only if Israel had not sinned through worshiping the golden calf that the greater part of the people lost the right to priesthood, except the [[tribe of Levi]] as the only tribe who remained faithful to God and did not partake in this sinful deed.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, Louis (1909) ''The Legends of the Jews Volume III : The Revelations in the Tabernacle'' (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic narrative==
{{tone|section|date=April 2012}}
{{See also|Moses in Islam|Islamic view of Aaron}}
{{Musa|related}}
The incident of the worship of the golden calf is narrated in the [[Quran]] and other Islamic literature. The Quran narrates that after they refused to enter the promised land, God decreed that as punishment the Israelites would wander for forty years. Moses continued to lead the Israelites to [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] for divine guidance. According to Islamic literature, God ordered Moses to [[fasting|fast]] for thirty days, and upon near completion of the thirty days, Moses ate a scented plant to improve the odour of his mouth. God commanded Moses to fast for ten more days, before receiving the guidance for the Israelites. When Moses completed the fasts, he approached God for guidance. During this time, Moses had instructed the Israelites that Aaron (''[[Harun]]'') was to lead them. The Israelites grew restless, since Moses had not returned to them, and after thirty days, a man the Quran names [[Samiri (Islamic figure)|Samiri]] raised doubts among the Israelites. Samiri claimed that Moses had forsaken the Israelites and ordered his followers among the Israelites to light a fire and bring him all the jewelry and gold ornaments they had.&lt;ref name="M. Th Houtsma 136"&gt;{{cite book|title=First encyclopaedia of Islam: 1913-1936|author=M.

The Quran mentions that Aaron attempted to guide and warn the people from worshipping the golden calf. However, the Israelites refused to stop until Moses had returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Stories of the Prophets - قصص الانبياء|author=IslamKotob, Sayyed Abul Hasan Ali Nadwi|page=115|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mXlHIskrYXEC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=prophets+stories+islam+musa+the+torah&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Zpv2T6LpEom8-QbZsrjcBg&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The righteous separated themselves from the pagans. God informed Moses that he had tried the Israelites in his absence and that they had failed by worshipping the golden calf.

Returning to the Israelites in great anger, Moses asked Aaron why he had not stopped the Israelites when he had seen them worshipping the golden calf. The Quran reports that Aaron stated that he did not act due to the fear that Moses would blame him for causing divisions among the Israelites. Moses realized his helplessness in the situation, and both prayed to God for forgiveness [http://al-quran.info/#7:150 (Qur'an 7:167-174]). Moses then questioned Samiri for the creation of the golden calf; Samiri justified his actions by stating that he had thrown the dust of the ground upon which Gabriel had tread on into the fire because his [[soul]] had suggested it to him.&lt;ref name="M.

In the Islamic view, the calf-worshipers' sin had been [[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]] ({{lang-ar|شرك}}), the sin of [[idolatry]] or [[polytheism]]. Shirk is the deification or worship of anyone or anything other than [[God in Islam|Allah]], or more literally the establishment of "partners" placed beside God, a most serious and unforgivable sin, with the calf-worshipers' being ultimately forgiven being a mark of special forbearance by Allah.

==Criticism and interpretation==
{{One source|section|date=April 2015}}
Despite a seemingly simplistic façade, the golden calf narrative is complex. According to [[Michael Coogan]], it seems that the golden calf was not an idol for another god, and thus a [[false god]].&lt;ref name=coogan115&gt;{{cite book |author=Coogan, M. |title=A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its context |year=2009 |page=115 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; He cites {{bibleverse||Exodus|32:4-5|HE}} as evidence:
{{quote|He [Aaron] took the gold from them, formed it in a mold, and cast an image of a calf; and they said, "These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!" When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation and said, "Tomorrow shall be a festival to the {{Lord}} ([[Yahweh]])."}} Importantly, there is a single calf in this narrative. While the people refer to it as representative of the "gods", this is a possessive form of the word Elohim ({{hebrew|אֱלֹהֶיךָ}} ''elo'hecha'', from {{hebrew|אֱלֹהִים}}), which is a name of God as well as general word for "gods". While a reference to singular god does not necessarily imply Yahweh worship, the word usually translated as 'lord' is Yahweh {{Hebrew|יהוה}} in the original, so at least it can't be ruled out.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;  It should also be noted that "in the chronology of the narrative of the Ten Commandments" the commandment against the creation of graven images had not yet been given to the people when they pressed upon Aaron to help them make the calf, and that such behavior was not yet explicitly outlawed.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;

Another understanding of the golden calf narrative is that the calf was meant to be the pedestal of Yahweh. In Near Eastern art, gods were often depicted standing on an animal, rather than seated on a throne.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt; This reading suggests that the golden calf was merely an alternative to the [[ark of the covenant]] or the [[cherubim]] upon which Yahweh was enthroned.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;

The reason for this complication may be understood as
:(1) a criticism of Aaron, as the founder of one priestly house that rivaled the priestly house of Moses, and/or
:(2) as "an attack on the northern kingdom of Israel."&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;
The second explanation relies on the "sin of [[Jeroboam]]," who was the first king of the northern kingdom, as the cause of the northern kingdom’s fall to Assyria in 722&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt; Jeroboam’s "sin" was creating two calves of gold, and sending one to [[Bethel]] as a worship site in the south of the Kingdom, and the other to [[Dan (ancient city)|Dan]] as a worship site in the north, so that the people of the northern kingdom would not have to continue to go to Jerusalem to worship (see 1&amp;nbsp;Kings&amp;nbsp;12:26–30). According to Coogan, this episode is part of the Deuteronomistic history, written in the southern [[Kingdom of Judah]], after the fall of the northern kingdom, which was biased against the northern kingdom.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt; Coogan maintains that Jeroboam was merely presenting an alternative to the [[cherubim]] of the Temple in Jerusalem, and that calves did not indicate non-Yahwehistic worship.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;

The [[documentary hypothesis]] can be used to further understand the layers of this narrative: it is plausible that the earliest story of the golden calf was preserved by [[Elohist|E]] (Israel source) and originated in the Northern kingdom. When E and [[Jahwist|J]] (Judah source) were combined after the fall of northern kingdom, "the narrative was reworked to portray the northern kingdom in a negative light," and the worship of the calf was depicted as "polytheism, with the suggestion of a sexual orgy" (see Exodus&amp;nbsp;32:6). When compiling the narratives, [[Priestly source|P]] (a later Priest source from Jerusalem) may have minimized Aaron’s guilt in the matter, but preserved the negativity associated with the calf.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;

Alternatively it could be said that there is no golden calf story in the J source, and if it is correct that the Jeroboam story was the original as stated by Friedman, then it is unlikely that the golden calf events as described in Exodus occurred at all. Friedman states that the smashing of the [[Ten Commandments]] by [[Moses]] when he beheld the worship of the golden calf, is really an attempt to cast into doubt the validity of Judah's central shrine, the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. "The author of E, in fashioning the golden calf story, attacked both the Israelite and Judean religious establishments." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Friedman, Richard Elliott |title=Who Wrote the Bible? |year=1987 |page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As to the likelihood that these events ever took place, on the one hand there are two versions of the ten commandments story, in E (Exodus&amp;nbsp;20) and J (Exodus&amp;nbsp;34), this gives some antiquity and there may be some original events serving as a basis to the stories. The Golden Calf story is only in the E version and a later editor added in an explanation that God made a second pair of tablets to give continuity to the J story.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Richard Elliott. 2003. ''The Bible with Sources Revealed'', p&amp;nbsp;177.&lt;/ref&gt; The actual Ten Commandments as given in Exodus&amp;nbsp;20 were also inserted by the redactor who combined the various sources.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Richard Elliott. 2003. ''The Bible with Sources Revealed'', p&amp;nbsp;153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologists [[Israel Finkelstein]] and [[Neil Asher Silberman]] say that while archaeology has found traces left by small bands of hunter-gatherers in the Sinai, there is no evidence at all for the large body of people described in the Exodus story: "The conclusion – that Exodus did not happen at the time and in the manner described in the Bible – seems irrefutable ... repeated excavations and surveys throughout the entire area have not provided even the slightest evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Finkelstein, Israel |author2=Silberman, Neil Asher |year=2001 |title=The Bible Unearthed |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As adoration of wealth===
A metaphoric interpretation emphasizes the "gold" part of "golden calf" to criticize the pursuit of wealth. This usage can be found in Spanish&lt;ref name="DRAE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltObtenerHtml?LEMA=becerro&amp;SUPIND=0&amp;CAREXT=10000&amp;NEDIC=No#becerro_de_oro. |title=becerro de oro |website=[[Diccionario de la Real Academia Española]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Mammon]], the Gospel personification of idolatry of wealth, is not so current.

'''''Gymnopilus aeruginosus''''', also known as the '''Magic Blue Gym''', is a mushroom which grows in clusters on dead wood and wood chip mulch. It is widely distributed and common in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. It has a rusty orange spore print and a bitter taste and contains the hallucinogen [[psilocybin]]. It was given its current name by mycologist [[Rolf Singer]] in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Singer R. |year=1951 |title=The Agaricales in modern taxonomy |journal=Lilloa |volume=22 |issue= |page=560}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
===Cap===
The cap is (2) 5–15&amp;nbsp;cm (23) across, convex with an incurved margin and expands to broadly convex to almost plane in age. The top is dry, fibrillose, and scaly, often with a blueish-green tinge when young. The color is variable, often with various bluish green, pink, or [[wine (color)|vinaceous]] patches. The cap is sometimes cracked in age. The flesh is pallid to whitish, sometimes turning buff or pinkish-buff in age. The scales are tawny or reddish becoming dark brown.

===Gills===
The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are close or crowded, and broad. They are buff to yellow-orange or ochre, and [[wikt:adnexed|adnexed]] to [[wikt:adnate|adnate]]. They are at first slightly [[Lamella (mycology)|decurrent]], often seceding. The edges are even to slightly rough.

===Spores===
Spores are 6—9&amp;nbsp;µm by 3.5—4.5&amp;nbsp;µm and have no [[germ pore]]. They are roughened and elliptical. [[Pleurocystidia]] are rare and clamp connections are present. The basidia each have four spore. ''Gymnopilus aeruginosus'' has a rusty to rusty-orange or rusty-cinnamon [[spore print]].

===Stipe===
The stipe is (3) 5 –  12&amp;nbsp;cm long, (0.4) 1.0 —  1.5&amp;nbsp;cm (4) thick, and has a more or less equal structure. It is covered with [[wikt:appressed|appressed]] fibrils, soon disappearing. It is smooth, dry, dusted with rusty orange spores and has a cottony, scanty, yellowish, partially fibrillose veil that leaves an evanescent zone of hairs near the apex of the stipe. It is colored more or less like the cap; it is flesh whitish, tinged greenish or bluish green,  becoming yellowish or pinkish brown when dry. It is solid but becomes hollow, and is sometimes striated.

==Habitat and formation==

''Gymnopilus aeruginosus'' grows gregariously to cespitosely on stumps, logs, and woodchip mulch/sawdust on hardwood and conifers; ''Gymnopilus aeruginosus'' grows in spring, fall, and winter, common in the [[Pacific Northwest]], it also grows in some of the southern states of the United States, such as [[Tennessee]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].  It is also found in [[Japan]] and [[Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;[Occurrences of ''Gymnopilus eruginosus'' ([data.gbif.org])]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Council of Unitarians and Universalists''' ('''ICUU''') is an [[umbrella organization]] founded in 1995 bringing together many [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], [[Christian Universalism|Universalist]], and [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]] organizations. 
The size of the affiliated organizations varies widely. Some groups represent only a few hundred people; while the largest, the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]], has over 160,000 members&lt;ref name=MembersDecline&gt;{{cite news|last=Deakin|first=Michelle Bates|title=UUA membership declines again|url=http://www.uuworld.org/news/articles/183612.shtml|accessdate=14 March 2014|newspaper=UUWorld.org|date=May 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and is larger than all the other groups put together.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==History==
The original initiative for its establishment was contained in a resolution of the [[General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches]] (British Unitarians) in 1987. This led to the establishment of the Advocates for the Establishment of an International Organization of Unitarians (AEIOU), which worked towards creating the council. However, the General Assembly resolution provided no funding.

The [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] (UUA) became particularly interested in the establishment of a council when it had to deal with an increasing number of applications for membership from congregations outside [[North America]]. It had already granted membership to congregations in [[Adelaide]], [[Auckland]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Pakistan]], and congregations in [[Sydney]], [[Russia]] and [[Spain]] had applied for membership. Rather than admit congregations from all over the world, the UUA hoped that they would join a world council instead. The UUA thus became willing to provide funding for the council's establishment.

As a result, the council was finally established at a meeting in [[Essex, Massachusetts]], United States on 23–26 March 1995.

==Principles and purposes==
The Preamble to the Constitution of the International Council of Unitarians and Universalists reads:

*and our commitment to democratic principles,

declare our purposes to be:
*to serve the Infinite Spirit of Life and the human community by strengthening the worldwide Unitarian and Universalist faith,
*to affirm the variety and richness of our living traditions,
*to facilitate mutual support among member organizations,
*to promote our ideals and principles around the world,
*to provide models of liberal religious response to the human condition which upholds our common values.

===Reorganizing===
*[[Kosciol Unitarianski]] (Unitarian Church in Poland), 80 attendees and friends.

Polish Unitarians have reported a need for a period of reorganization, and that at this time they are unable to maintain the level of activity needed to be full Council members, be it moved that membership of these groups be suspended. This action is taken with regret and the ICUU looks forward to welcoming Poland back into membership at the earliest possible date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icuu.net/events/ICUU_Council_Meeting_09_Minutes.pdf |title=Draft Minutes : ICUU Council Meeting, 2009 Kolozsvar |publisher=Icuu.net |accessdate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Provisional members===
Churches and religious associations which have expressed their will to become members of the Council may be admitted as "Provisional Members" for a period of time (generally two or four years), until the Council decides that they have shown their organizational stability, affinity with the ICUU principles and commitment to deserve becoming Full Members of the Council. Provisional Members are invited to Council meetings through a delegate but cannot vote.

*Kenyan Unitarians

===Emerging groups===
According to the [http://icuu.net/about/Bylaws.html Bylaws of the ICUU], Emerging Groups are ''"applicants that are deemed to be reasonable prospects for membership, but do not fulfil the conditions of either Provisional membership or Full Membership"''. These groups may be designated as Emerging Groups by the Executive Committee upon its sole discretion. Emerging Groups may be invited as observers to General Meetings.

The current list of Emerging Groups after the last meeting of the Executive Committee (London, 22–25 November 2008) is as follows:
*Congo Unitarians
*French Unitarians ([http://afcu.over-blog.org Assemblée Fraternelle des Chrétiens Unitariens])
*[http://uuhk.org Unitarian Universalists Hong Kong]—Hong Kong (China)
*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050411045142/http://italianunitarian.christian.net/index.html Italian Unitarians]
*Mexico (two groups: the [http://www.lcum.blogspot.com/ ''Free Unitarian Congregation of Mexico, (LCUM)''] and the ''Unitarian Universalists of Mexico AC'')

===Associates===
Organizations with beliefs and purposes closely akin to those of ICUU but which by nature of their constitution are not eligible for full membership or which do not wish to become full members now or in the foreseeable future, may become Associates of the ICUU. The application must be approved by the ICUU Council Meeting.

He is also the founder of the [[James Randi Educational Foundation]] (JREF). He began his career as a magician under the stage name '''The Amazing Randi''' and later chose to devote most of his time to investigating [[paranormal]], [[occult]], and [[supernatural]] claims, which he collectively calls "woo-woo".&lt;ref name="Randiwoo"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Randi |first=James |date=February 9, 2007 |title=More Geller Woo-Woo |journal=Swift |type=Newsletter |accessdate=2016-12-26 |url=http://www.randi.org/jr/2007-02/020209morebrowne.html#i7 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090710012001/http://www.randi.org/jr/2007-02/020209morebrowne.html#i7 |archivedate=July 10, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Randi retired from practicing magic at age 60, and from the JREF at 87.

Although often referred to as a "[[debunker]]", Randi has said he dislikes the term's connotations and prefers to describe himself as an "investigator".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://affect.media.mit.edu/milliondollarchallenge/ |title=One-Million-Dollar Challenge |work=MIT Media Lab: Affective Computing Group |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] |accessdate=October 9, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727062223/http://affect.media.mit.edu/milliondollarchallenge/ |archivedate=July 27, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has written about paranormal phenomena, skepticism, and the history of magic. He was a frequent guest on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', famously exposing fraudulent [[faith healer]] [[Peter Popoff]], and was occasionally featured on the television program ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!]]''

Prior to Randi's retirement, JREF sponsored the [[One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge]], which offered a prize of one million dollars US to eligible applicants who could demonstrate evidence of any paranormal, supernatural, or occult power or event under test conditions agreed to by both parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JREF Status|url=http://web.randi.org/home/jref-status|publisher=JREF|accessdate=November 12, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830152145/http://web.randi.org/home/jref-status|archivedate=August 30, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paranormal challenge was officially terminated by the JREF in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.randi.org/the-million-dollar-challenge.html |title=The Million Dollar Challenge |accessdate=2015-01-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904164131/http://web.randi.org/the-million-dollar-challenge.html |archivedate=September 4, 2017 |df=mdy-all }} James Randi Educational Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation continues to make grants to non-profit groups that encourage critical thinking and a fact-based world view.

==Early life==
Randi was born on August 7, 1928 in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada,&lt;ref name="HWWilson"&gt;[[#Moritz|Moritz 1987]], p. 455&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Marie Alice (née Paradis) and George Randall Zwinge.&lt;ref name="HWWilson" /&gt; He has a younger brother and sister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/192-swift-may#i3 |title=How Wrong Can You Get? |last=Randi |first=James |date=May 9, 2008 |work=Swift |publisher=JREF |type=Blog |accessdate=10 June 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921213014/http://archive.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/192-swift-may#i3 |archivedate=September 21, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He took up [[magic (illusion)|magic]] after seeing [[Harry Blackstone Sr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=wJMTyK0VfdY|title=James Randi at the Magic Castle: In Conversation with Max Maven|link=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reading conjuring books while spending 13 months in a [[Orthopedic cast|body cast]] following a bicycle accident. He confounded doctors who expected he would never walk again.&lt;ref name="TorontoStar1986"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Amazing Randi |first=Patricia |last=Orwen |url=http://zammoth-jamesrandi.blogspot.com/ |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |publisher=[[Torstar|Torstar Corporation]] |date=August 23, 1986 |accessdate=October 9, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106183159/http://zammoth-jamesrandi.blogspot.com/ |archivedate=November 6, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Randi often skipped classes and, at 17, dropped out of high school to perform as a conjurer in a carnival roadshow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The 'quack' hunter |first=Jeanne |last=Malmgren |others=''Times'' researcher Barbara Oliver contributed to this report. |url=http://www.sptimes.com/Floridian/41498/The__quack__hunter.html |newspaper=[[Tampa Bay Times|St. Petersburg Times]] |location=St. Petersburg, FL |date=April 14, 1998 |accessdate=August 19, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301011756/http://www.sptimes.com/Floridian/41498/The__quack__hunter.html |archivedate=March 1, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He practised as a [[Mentalism|mentalist]] in local nightclubs and at Toronto's [[Canadian National Exhibition]] and wrote for [[Montreal]]'s tabloid press.&lt;ref name="Colombo"&gt;[[#Colombo|Colombo 2004]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=OXP_OpQna4gC&amp;pg=PA182 p. 182]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his twenties, Randi posed as an [[astrologer]] and, to establish that they were actually doing simple tricks, he briefly wrote an astrological column in the Canadian tabloid ''[[Globe (tabloid)|Midnight]]'' under the name "Zo-ran" by simply shuffling up items from newspaper astrology columns and pasting them randomly into a column.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Randi 1982c|Randi 1982c]], pp. 230–231. Randi reprints two newspaper columns from the ''[[Toronto Telegram|Toronto Evening Telegram]]'' of August 28, 1950, and August 14, 1950, by Wessely Hicks about Randall Zwinge's psychic predictions. The earlier column states that "Mr. Zwinge said he first became aware that he possessed Extra Sensory Perception when he was nine years old."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Randi 1982a|Randi 1982a]], pp. 61–62&lt;/ref&gt; In his thirties, Randi worked in the UK, Europe, [[Philippines|Philippine]] nightclubs, and all across [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Randi |first=James |date=May 19, 2006 |title=Filipino Justice |journal=Swift |type=Newsletter |accessdate=June 15, 2009 |url=http://www.randi.org/jr/2006-05/051906sylvia.html#i13 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091007175115/http://www.randi.org/jr/2006-05/051906sylvia.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He witnessed many tricks that were presented as being supernatural.

==Career==

===Magician===
[[File:RandiFork.jpg|thumb|Fork bent by Randi]]
Though defining himself as a conjuror, Randi began a career as a professional stage magician&lt;ref name="takedown"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/james_randi.html |title=James Randi: Homeopathy, quackery and fraud |date=February 2007 |work=[[TED (conference)|TED]] |publisher=[[Sapling Foundation]] |location=New York |accessdate=April 24, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719111508/http://www.ted.com/talks/james_randi.html |archivedate=July 19, 2011 |df=mdy-all }} Randi explained in a February 2007 presentation that he believes the word "magician" implies one who has actual magical abilities, whereas a conjurer is one who uses skills to merely play the part of one.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[escapologist]] in 1946. Initially, he presented himself under his real name, Randall Zwinge, which he later dropped in favor of "The Amazing Randi". Early in his career, he performed numerous escape acts from jail cells and safes around the world. On February 7, 1956, he appeared live on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' show, where he remained for 104 minutes in a sealed metal coffin that had been submerged in a hotel swimming pool, breaking what was said to be [[Harry Houdini]]'s record of 93 minutes, though Randi calls attention to the fact that he was very much younger than Houdini when the original record was established, in 1926.&lt;ref name="Sinclair"&gt;{{cite news |title=Television &amp; radio column |first=Gordon |last=Sinclair |authorlink=Gordon Sinclair |newspaper=[[Toronto Star|Toronto Daily Star]] |date=February 7, 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryant"&gt;{{cite news |title=Handcuffs no problem Toronto-born magician laughs at locksmiths |first=George |last=Bryant |newspaper=Toronto Daily Star |date=June 21, 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Randi was a frequent guest on the [[Long John Nebel]] program on [[New York City|New York]] radio station [[WOR (AM)|WOR]], and did character voices for commercials.&lt;ref name = CSICon/&gt;{{rp|31:00}} After Nebel went to [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]] in 1962, Randi was given the time slot, and from 1967 to '68 hosted ''The Amazing Randi Show''.&lt;ref name = CSICon/&gt;{{rp|35:00}} &lt;ref name="Randiofficialbio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/58.html|title=About James Randi Full Bio|year=2007|publisher=JREF|accessdate=October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This show often had guests who defended paranormal claims, among them Randi's then-friend [[James W. Moseley]]. Randi says he quit WOR over complaints (disputed by Randi) from the archbishop of NY, that Randi had said on-air that "Jesus Christ was a religious nut."&lt;ref name = CSICon/&gt;{{rp|35:00}}

Randi also hosted numerous television specials and went on several world tours. As "The Amazing Randi" he appeared regularly on the New York-based children's television series ''[[Wonderama]]'' from 1959 to 1967.&lt;ref name="Butler"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvparty.com/lostwonder1.html |title=Wonderama! |last1=Butler |first1=Kevin S. |last2=Ingram |first2=Billy |work=TVparty! |publisher=William Ingram |location=Greensboro, NC |accessdate=April 5, 2007 |quote=Sonny Fox hosted another 'Wonderama Thanksgiving Day Party' on Thursday afternoon, November 23, 1961 with guests ventriloquist and cartoon voice-over performer Paul Winchell, magician/escape artist and magic historian The Amazing James Randi and folk singer Pat Woodell. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230223655/http://www.tvparty.com/lostwonder1.html |archivedate=December 30, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also auditioned for a revival of the 1950s children's show ''[[The Magic Clown]]'' in 1970, which showed briefly in Detroit and in Kenya, but was never picked up.&lt;ref name="Butler 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvparty.com/lostny2bonamo.html |title=Bonamo, The Magic Clown |last=Butler |first=Kevin S. |work=TVparty! |publisher=William Ingram |location=Greensboro, NC |accessdate=May 13, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510233350/http://www.tvparty.com/lostny2bonamo.html |archivedate=May 10, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the February 2, 1974, issue of the British conjuring magazine ''[[Goodliffe's Abracadabra|Abracadabra]]'', Randi, defining the community of magicians, stated: "I know of no calling which depends so much upon mutual trust and faith as does ours." In the December 2003 issue of ''[[The Linking Ring]]'', the monthly publication of the [[International Brotherhood of Magicians]], it is stated: "Perhaps Randi's ethics are what make him Amazing" and "The Amazing Randi not only talks the talk, he walks the walk."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barber |first=Peter W. |date=December 2003 |title=Points to Ponder: Another Matter of Ethics |journal=[[The Linking Ring]] |volume=83 |issue=12 |page=97 |issn=0024-4023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Alice Cooper]]'s 1973–1974 [[Billion Dollar Babies tour]], Randi performed on stage both as a mad dentist and as Alice's executioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |last=Gannon |first=Joe (Director) |authorlink=Joe Gannon |year=1974 |title=[[Good To See You Again, Alice Cooper]] |medium=Motion picture |work=[[Penthouse (magazine)|General Media International, Inc.]] |oclc=62534800}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also built several of the stage props, including the [[guillotine (magic trick)|guillotine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sickthingsuk.co.uk/people/p-randi.php|title=The Amazing Randi|website=SickthingsUK|publisher=Simon Halley|location=Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England|accessdate=May 18, 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071108052435/http://www.sickthingsuk.co.uk/people/p-randi.php|archivedate=November 8, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after that, in a 1976 performance for the Canadian TV special ''World of Wizards'', Randi escaped from a [[straitjacket]] while suspended upside-down over [[Niagara Falls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Randi |first=James |date=May 3, 2002 |title=Dangerous Stunts |journal=Swift |type=Newsletter |accessdate=May 18, 2007 |url=http://www.randi.org/jr/050302.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070609005249/http://www.randi.org/jr/050302.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Randi has been accused of actually using "psychic powers" to perform acts such as [[spoon bending]]. According to [[James Alcock]], at a meeting where Randi was duplicating the performances of [[Uri Geller]], a professor from the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University at Buffalo]] shouted out that Randi was a fraud. Randi said: "Yes, indeed, I'm a trickster, I'm a cheat, I'm a charlatan, that's what I do for a living. Everything I've done here was by trickery." The professor shouted back: "That's not what I mean. You're a fraud because you're pretending to do these things through trickery, but you're actually using psychic powers and misleading us by not admitting it."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Alcock|Alcock 2001]], p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; A similar event involved Senator [[Claiborne Pell]], a confirmed believer in psychic phenomena. When Randi personally demonstrated to Pell that he could reveal—by simple trickery—a concealed drawing that had been secretly made by the senator, Pell refused to believe that it was a trick, saying: "I think Randi may be a psychic and doesn't realize it." Randi has consistently denied having any paranormal powers or abilities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gardner|Gardner 2000]], p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

Randi is a member of the [[Society of American Magicians]] (SAM), the [[International Brotherhood of Magicians]] (IBM), and [[The Magic Circle (organisation)|The Magic Circle]] in the UK, holding the rank of "Member of the Inner Magic Circle with Gold Star."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themagiccircle.co.uk/news/711-the-magic-circle-president-promotes-a-knight-a-dragon-and-student-doctor-of-magic?highlight=WyJyYW5kaSJd|title=TMC Promotions|date=January 11, 2013|accessdate=July 22, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723074917/http://themagiccircle.co.uk/news/711-the-magic-circle-president-promotes-a-knight-a-dragon-and-student-doctor-of-magic?highlight=WyJyYW5kaSJd|archivedate=July 23, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Randi said the hardest people to fool are not the highly educated, but children, because they are not sophisticated enough to be fooled, as they have not learned the body cues that adults have learned and which magicians take advantage of.&lt;ref name="theesp.eu"/&gt;

===Author===
Randi is the author of ten books, among them ''[[Conjuring (book)|Conjuring]]'' (1992), a biographical history of noted magicians. The book is subtitled ''Being a Definitive History of the Venerable Arts of Sorcery, Prestidigitation, Wizardry, Deception, &amp; Chicanery and of the Mountebanks &amp; Scoundrels Who have Perpetrated these Subterfuges on a Bewildered Public, in short, MAGIC!'' The book's cover says that it is by "James Randi, Esq., A Contrite Rascal Once Dedicated to these Wicked Practices but Now Almost Totally Reformed". The book selects the most influential magicians and tells some of their history, often in the context of strange deaths and careers on the road. This work expanded on Randi's second book titled ''Houdini, His Life and Art''.&lt;ref name=Milkwaukee&gt;{{cite news |last=Bartlett |first=Kay |title=Truthful trickster |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RU4aAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wykEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3862,1502395 |accessdate=July 13, 2012 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|The Milwaukee Journal]] |date=July 13, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; This illustrated work was published in 1976 and was co-authored with [[Bert Sugar]]. It focuses on the professional and private life of Houdini.&lt;ref name="Daniel"&gt;[[#Burt|Burt 2001]], p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

Randi also wrote a children's book in 1989 titled ''The Magic World of the Amazing Randi'', which introduced children to magic tricks. In addition to his magic books, he has written several educational works about paranormal and pseudoscientific claims. These include biographies of Uri Geller and [[Nostradamus]] as well as reference material on other major paranormal figures. He is currently working on ''A Magician in the Laboratory'', which recounts his application of skepticism to science.&lt;ref name="randi1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/1194-teleportation-magic-established-by-science-at-last.html |title=Teleportation Magic Established By Science, At Last! |last=Randi |first=James |work=Swift |publisher=JREF |type=Blog |accessdate=January 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the all-male literary banqueting club the [[Trap Door Spiders]], which served as the basis of his good friend [[Isaac Asimov]]'s fictional group of mystery solvers, the [[Black Widowers]].&lt;ref name="Asimov1994-120"&gt;[[#Asimov|Asimov 1994]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other books are ''[[Flim-Flam! Psychics, ESP, Unicorns, and Other Delusions|Flim-Flam!]]'' (1982), ''[[The Faith Healers]]'' (1987), ''[[James Randi, Psychic Investigator]]'' (1991), ''[[Test Your ESP Potential]]'' (1982) and ''An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural'' (1995).

Randi was a regular contributor to ''[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]]'' magazine, penning the "'Twas Brillig ..." column, and also served on its editorial board. He is also a frequent contributor to ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' magazine, which is published by [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|CSI]], of which he is also a Fellow.

Randi gained the international spotlight in 1972 when he publicly challenged the claims of [[Uri Geller]]. He accused Geller of being nothing more than a [[charlatan]] and a [[fraud]] who used standard magic tricks to accomplish his allegedly paranormal feats, and he presented his claims in the book ''[[The Truth About Uri Geller]]'' (1982).&lt;ref name="Taft"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rensberger"&gt;{{cite news|first=Boyce|last=Rensberger|title=Magicians Term Israeli 'Psychic' a Fraud|newspaper=The New York Times|page=29|date=December 13, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=God's Chariot!

Believing that it was important to get columnists and TV personalities to challenge Geller and others like him, Randi and [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|CSICOP]] reached out in an attempt to educate them. Randi said that CSICOP had a "very substantial influence on the printed media ... in those days."&lt;ref name = CSICon/&gt;{{rp|20:05}}  During this effort, Randi made contact with [[Johnny Carson]] and discovered that he was "very much on our side. He wasn't only a comedian ... he was a great thinker."&lt;ref name = CSICon/&gt;{{rp|21:15}} According to Randi, when he was on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'', Carson broke his usual protocol of not talking with guests prior to their entrance on stage, but instead would ask what Randi wanted to be emphasized in the interview. "He wanted to be aware of how he could help me."&lt;ref name = CSICon/&gt;{{rp|21:30}}

In 1973, Geller appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'', and this appearance is recounted in the ''[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]'' documentary "James Randi - Secrets of the Psychics".&lt;ref name = Doc/&gt;{{efn|A two-minute clip of this documentary with the Geller segment has been widely circulated on the Internet since James Randi acquired permission to use it from NBC, and Carson paid for the expensive and complex transfer from the original, physically degraded, two-inch videotape recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.randi.org/jr/2007-03/032307hope.html| archiveurl = http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090711011032/http%3A//www%2Erandi%2Eorg/jr/2007%2D03/032307hope%2Ehtml| archivedate = 11 July 2009| title = Swift – March 30, 2007| date=2007-03-30| accessdate = 2007-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn|James Randi discussed obtaining the clip of Uri Geller on ''The Tonight Show''.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}}}

In the documentary, Randi says that Carson "had been a magician himself and was skeptical" of Geller's claimed [[paranormal]] powers, so prior to the date of taping, Randi was asked "to help prevent any trickery". Per Randi's advice, the show prepared its own props without informing Geller, and did not let Geller or his staff "anywhere near them". When Geller joined Carson on stage, he appeared surprised that he was not going to be interviewed, but instead was expected to display his abilities using the provided articles. Geller said "This scares me" and "I'm surprised because before this program your producer came and he read me at least 40 questions you were going to ask me." Geller was unable to display any [[paranormal]] abilities, saying "I don't feel strong" and expressing his displeasure at feeling like he was being "pressed" to perform by Carson.&lt;ref name=Doc&gt;{{cite web|title=James Randi - Secrets of the Psychics Documentary (Full)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MFAvH8m8aI|website=Youtube.com|publisher=JREF|accessdate=25 August 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805233340/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MFAvH8m8aI|archivedate=August 5, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8:10}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 978-0-465-04195-4|page= 132}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Adam Higginbotham's Nov. 7, 2014 article in the ''New York Times'':

{{quote|text=The result was a legendary immolation, in which Geller offered up flustered excuses to his host as his abilities failed him again and again. "I sat there for 22 minutes, humiliated," Geller told me, when I spoke to him in September. "I went back to my hotel, devastated. I was about to pack up the next day and go back to Tel Aviv. I thought, That's it — I'm destroyed."&lt;ref name=Higginbotham&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Higginbotham|first1=Adam|title=The Unbelievable Skepticism of the Amazing Randi|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/magazine/the-unbelievable-skepticism-of-the-amazing-randi.html?_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=25 August 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826075948/https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/magazine/the-unbelievable-skepticism-of-the-amazing-randi.html?_r=0|archivedate=August 26, 2017|df=mdy-all|date=2014-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, this appearance on ''The Tonight Show'', which Carson and Randi had orchestrated to debunk Geller's claimed abilities, backfired. According to Higginbotham,

{{quote|text=To Geller's astonishment, he was immediately booked on ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]''. He was on his way to becoming a paranormal superstar. "That Johnny Carson show made Uri Geller," Geller said. To an enthusiastically trusting public, his failure only made his gifts seem more real: if he were performing magic tricks, they would surely work every time.&lt;ref name =Higginbotham/&gt;}}

According to Higginbotham, this result caused Randi to realize that much more must be done to stop Geller and those like him. So in 1976, Randi approached [[Ray Hyman]], a psychologist who had observed the tests of Geller's ability at Stanford and thought them slipshod, and suggested they create an organization dedicated to combating pseudoscience. In 1976, together with [[Martin Gardner]], a ''Scientific American'' columnist whose writing had helped hone Hyman's and Randi's skepticism, they formed the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|Committee for Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal]] (CSICOP).&lt;ref name =Higginbotham/&gt;

Using donations and sales of their magazine, ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'', they and secular humanist philosopher [[Paul Kurtz]] took seats on the executive board, with [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[Carl Sagan]] joining as founding members. Randi traveled the world on behalf of CSICOP, becoming its public face, and according to Hyman, the face of the skeptical movement.&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;Higginbotham, Adam (November 7, 2014).

András G.

Randi refused and resigned, though he has maintained a respectful relationship with the group, which in 2006 changed its name to the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI). In 2010, Randi was one of 16 new CSI fellows elected by its board.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csicop.org/about/csi_fellows_and_staff/ |title=CSI Fellows and Staff – CSI |website=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] |publisher=[[Center for Inquiry]] |location=Amherst, NY |accessdate=July 23, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130714111426/http://www.csicop.org/about/csi_fellows_and_staff/ |archivedate=July 14, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Randi has gone on to write many articles criticizing beliefs and claims regarding the paranormal.&lt;ref name="jref-randi-bio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.randi.org/jr/bio.html |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090710002246/http://www.randi.org/jr/bio.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 10, 2009 |title=About James Randi |publisher=JREF |accessdate=December 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also demonstrated flaws in studies suggesting the existence of paranormal phenomena; in his [[Project Alpha]] hoax, Randi successfully planted two fake psychics in a privately funded psychic research experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Magicians Score a Hit On Scientific Researchers |first=Philip J. |last=Hilts |newspaper=The Washington Post |page=First Section; A1 |date=March 1, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hoax became a scandal and demonstrated the shortcomings of many paranormal research projects at the university level.

Randi has appeared on numerous TV shows, sometimes to directly debunk the claimed abilities of fellow guests. In a 1981 appearance on ''[[That's My Line]]'', Randi appeared opposite claimed psychic [[James Hydrick]], who said that he could move objects with his mind and appeared to demonstrate this claim on live television by turning a page in a telephone book without touching it.&lt;ref name="lookatpast"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.randi.org/jr/2006-09/092206bad.html#i11 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090709213130/http://www.randi.org/jr/2006-09/092206bad.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 9, 2009 |title=A Look at the Past |last=Randi |first=James |date=September 22, 2006 |work=Swift |publisher=JREF |type=Newsletter |accessdate=September 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Randi, having determined that Hydrick was surreptitiously blowing on the book, arranged [[Foam peanut|foam packaging peanuts]] on the table in front of the telephone book for the demonstration. This prevented Hydrick from demonstrating his abilities, which would have been exposed when the blowing moved the packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=QlfMsZwr8rc|title=James Randi exposes James Hydrick|link=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Randi writes that, eventually, Hydrick "confessed everything".&lt;ref name="lookatpast" /&gt;

[[File:Randi 1983.jpg|thumb|left|Randi speaks at the 1983 [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|CSICOP]] Conference in Buffalo, New York]]

Randi was awarded a [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation|MacArthur Foundation]] [[MacArthur Fellows Program|Fellowship]] in 1986. The fellowship's five-year $272,000 grant helped support Randi's investigations of faith healers, including [[W. V. Grant]], [[Ernest Angley]], and [[Peter Popoff]], whom Randi first exposed on ''The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson'' in February 1986. Hearing about his investigation of Popoff, [[Johnny Carson|Carson]] invited Randi onto his show without seeing the evidence he was going to reveal. Carson appeared stunned after Randi showed a brief video segment from one of Popoff's broadcasts showing him calling out a woman in the audience, revealed personal information about her that he claimed came from God, and then performed a laying-on-of-hands healing to drive the devil from her body. Randi then replayed the video, but with some of the sound dubbed in that he and his investigating team captured during the event using a radio scanner and recorder. Their scanner had detected the radio frequency Popoff's wife Elizabeth was using backstage to broadcast directions and information to a miniature radio receiver hidden in Popoff's left ear. That information had been gathered by Popoff's assistants, who had handed out "prayer cards" to the audience before the show, instructing them to write down all the information Popoff would need to pray for them.&lt;ref name="Faith Healers"&gt;[[#Randi 1987|Randi 1987]], pp. 139–181&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heavenly Messages"&gt;{{cite news |title=Skeptics' Revelations: Faith Healer Receives 'Heavenly' Messages Via Electronic Receiver, Debunkers Charge |first=John |last=Dart |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-05-11/local/me-5518_1_faith-healer |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=May 11, 1986 |accessdate=August 18, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015155733/http://articles.latimes.com/1986-05-11/local/me-5518_1_faith-healer |archivedate=October 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Randi Debunks Popoff"&gt;{{YouTube|id=q7BQKu0YP8Y|title=James Randi Debunks Peter Popoff Faith Healer|link=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The news coverage generated by Randi's exposé on ''The Tonight Show'' led to many TV stations dropping Popoff's show, eventually forcing him into bankruptcy in September 1987.&lt;ref name="Bankruptcy"&gt;{{cite news |title=Evangelist Popoff Off Air, Files Bankruptcy Petitions |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-09-26/local/me-2461_1_peter-popoff |first=John |last=Dart |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=September 26, 1987 |accessdate=August 18, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305090833/http://articles.latimes.com/1987-09-26/local/me-2461_1_peter-popoff |archivedate=March 5, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the televangelist returned soon after with faith-healing infomercials that reportedly attracted more than $23 million in 2005 from viewers sending in money for promised healing and prosperity. The Canadian Centre for Inquiry's ''Think Again! TV'' documented one of Popoff's more recent performances before a large audience who gathered in [[Toronto]] on May 26, 2011, hoping to be saved from illness and poverty.&lt;ref name="Think Again!"&gt;{{YouTube|id=oZo0DLKriDY|title=Secret Footage of 'Faith Healer' Peter Popoff in Toronto May 2011|link=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1988, Randi tested the gullibility of the media by perpetrating a hoax of his own. By teaming up with Australia's ''[[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|60 Minutes]]'' program and by releasing a fake press package, he built up publicity for a "spirit channeler" named Carlos&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; who was actually artist Jose Alvarez, a.k.a. Deyvi Orangel Peña Arteaga, whom Randi described as a "friend". Randi would tell him what to say through sophisticated radio equipment. According to the ''60 Minutes'' program on the Carlos hoax, "it was claimed that Alvarez would not have had the audience he did at the Opera House (and the potential sales therefrom) had the media coverage been more aggressive (and factual)", though an analysis by ''[[Australian Skeptics|The Skeptic]]'''s Tim Mendham concluded that, while the media coverage of Alvarez's appearances was not credulous, "it [the hoax] at least showed that they could benefit by being a touch more sceptical".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mendham |first=Tim |year=1988 |title=The Carlos Hoax |journal=The Skeptic |volume=8 |issue=1 |format=PDF |accessdate=April 19, 2013 |issn=0726-9897 |oclc=53994493 |url=http://www.skeptics.com.au/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/theskeptic/2ndcoming/skepticism.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419063417/http://www.skeptics.com.au/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/theskeptic/2ndcoming/skepticism.pdf |archivedate=April 19, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hoax was exposed on ''60 Minutes Australia''; "Carlos" and Randi explained how they had pulled it off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skepdic.com/carlos.html |title='Carlos' hoax |work=The Skeptic's Dictionary |publisher=[[Robert Todd Carroll]] |accessdate=June 15, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605100136/http://skepdic.com/carlos.html |archivedate=June 5, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Randi |first=James |interviewer=Paul Willis |title=James Randi and the Great Carlos |work=The Correx Archives |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=May 7, 1998 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/correx/archives/randi4.htm |accessdate=June 15, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715171756/http://www.abc.net.au/science/correx/archives/randi4.htm |archivedate=July 15, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''The Faith Healers'', Randi wrote that his anger and relentlessness arose from compassion for the victims of fraud. Randi has also been critical of [[João de Deus (medium)|João de Deus]] (John of God), a self-proclaimed [[Psychic surgery|psychic surgeon]] who has received international attention.&lt;ref name="JohnofGod"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Randi |first=James |date=February 18, 2005 |title=The ABC-TV Infomercial for John of God |journal=Swift |type=Newsletter |accessdate=November 18, 2006 |url=http://www.randi.org/jr/021805a.html |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090710000748/http://www.randi.org/jr/021805a.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Randi observed, referring to psychic surgery, "To any experienced conjurer, the methods by which these seeming miracles are produced are very obvious."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Randi 1995|Randi 1995]], [http://www.randi.org/encyclopedia/psychic%20surgery.html "psychic surgery"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Randi verified the abilities of [[Arthur Lintgen]], a Philadelphia doctor, who was able to identify the classical music recorded on a [[Gramophone record|vinyl LP]] solely by examining the grooves on the record. However, Lintgen did not claim to have any paranormal ability, merely knowledge of the way that the groove forms patterns on particular recordings.&lt;ref name="Randi_2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Randi |first=James |date=November 1, 2002 |title=Reading Records |journal=Swift |type=Newsletter |url=http://www.randi.org/jr/110102.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20100620232826/http://www.randi.org/jr/110102.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 20, 2010 |accessdate=July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, [[John Maddox]], editor of the prominent science journal ''Nature'', asked Randi to join the supervision and observation of the [[homeopathy]] experiments conducted by [[Jacques Benveniste]]'s team. Once Randi's stricter protocol for the experiment was in place, the positive results could not be reproduced.

James Randi stated that [[Daniel Dunglas Home]], who could allegedly play an accordion that was locked in a cage without touching it, was caught cheating on a few occasions, but the incidents were never made public. He also stated that the actual instrument in use was a [[Harmonica|one-octave mouth organ]] concealed under Home's large moustache and that other one-octave mouth organs were found in Home's belongings after his death.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Randi 1995|Randi 1995]], [http://www.randi.org/encyclopedia/Home,%20Daniel%20Dunglas.html "Home, Daniel Dunglas"]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Randi, author [[William Lindsay Gresham]] told Randi "around 1960" that he had seen these mouth organs in the Home collection at the [[Society for Psychical Research]] (SPR). Eric J. Dingwall, who catalogued Home's collection on its arrival at the SPR does not record the presence of the mouth organs. According to Peter Lamont, the author of an extensive Home biography, "It is unlikely Dingwall would have missed these or did not make them public."&lt;ref name="Lamont302"&gt;[[#Lamont|Lamont 2005]], p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;

Randi distinguishes between pseudoscience and [[Pseudoscience|crackpot science]]. He regards most of [[parapsychology]] as pseudoscience because of the way in which it is approached and conducted, but nonetheless sees it as a legitimate subject that "should be pursued", and from which real scientific discoveries may develop.&lt;ref name="Terzian-Bilson"&gt;[[#Randi 1997|Randi 1997]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=_mo4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA170 p. 170]&lt;/ref&gt; Randi regards crackpot science as "equally wrong" as pseudoscience, but with no scientific pretensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |editor-last=Ripin |editor-first=Barrett H. |date=June 1995 |title=Trio Takes Aim Against Spread of Pseudo-Science |journal=APS News |volume=4 |issue=6 |issn=1058-8132 |accessdate=October 9, 2013 |url=http://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/199506/pseudo-science.cfm |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228153120/http://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/199506/pseudo-science.cfm |archivedate=December 28, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptics and magicians [[Penn &amp; Teller]] credit Randi and his career as a skeptic for their own careers. During an interview at [[The Amazing Meeting|TAM! 2012]], Penn stated that ''[[Flim-Flam!]]'' was an early influence on him, and said "If not for Randi there would not be Penn &amp; Teller as we are today."&lt;ref name=Penn&gt;{{cite web|title="38 Years of Magic and B.S.: A Conversation with Penn &amp; Teller" - TAM 2012|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99_upx8URLI|website=Youtube.com|publisher=James Randi Foundation|accessdate=25 August 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906194746/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99_upx8URLI|archivedate=September 6, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1:40}} He went on to say "Outside of my family ... no one is more important in my life.

At the [[NECSS]] skeptic conference in 2017, Randi was asked by [[George Hrab]] what a "'skeptic coming of age ceremony' would look like" and Randi talked about what it was like as a child to learn about the speed of light and how that felt like he was looking into the past. Randi stated "'More kids need to be stunned'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dobler |first1=Russ |title=NECSS 2017: Skepticism Making Connections in Midtown Manhattan |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=8–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Exploring Psychic Powers ... Live'' television show===
''Exploring Psychic Powers ... Live'' was a two-hour television special aired live on June 7, 1989, wherein Randi examined several people claiming psychic powers. Hosted by actor [[Bill Bixby]], the program offered $100,000 (Randi's then $10,000 prize plus $90,000 put up by the show's [[Broadcast syndication|syndicator]], [[Lexington Broadcast Services Company|LBS Communications, Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |url=http://clear-light.msspro.com/files/Randi_2003-Jul-31.wav |title=Randi_2003-Jul-31.wav |website=JREF Internet Broadcast Archive|host=Randi, James |format=[[WAV]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030907063148/http://clear-light.msspro.com/files/Randi_2003-Jul-31.wav |archivedate=September 7, 2003 |date=July 31, 2003 |time=0:33:19 |accessdate=November 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to anyone who could demonstrate genuine psychic powers.

* An [[astrologer]] claimed that he was able to ascertain a person's [[astrological sign]] after talking with them for a few minutes. He was presented with twelve people, one at a time, each with a different astrological sign. They could not tell the astrologer their astrological sign or birth date, nor could they wear anything that would indicate it. After the astrologer talked to them, he had them go and sit in front of the astrological sign that the astrologer thought was theirs. By agreement, the astrologer needed to get ten of the 12 correct, to win. He got none correct.
* The next psychic claimed to be able to read [[aura (paranormal)|auras]] around people. He claimed that auras were visible at least five inches above each of them. He selected ten people who he said had clearly visible auras. They were to stand behind screens and he claimed that their auras would be visible above the screens, which were numbered ''1'' through ''10'', and the subjects were told by the astrologer behind which screen to stand. He was to tell whether or not a person was standing behind each screen, by seeing their aura above. Since random guessing would be expected to get about five correct, the psychic needed to get eight of the ten right. The psychic stated that he saw an aura over all ten screens, but people were behind only four of the screens.
* A [[Dowsing|dowser]] claimed that he could detect water, even in a bottle inside a sealed cardboard box. He was shown twenty boxes and he was asked to indicate which boxes contained a water bottle. He selected eight of the boxes, which he said contained water, but it turned out that only five of the twenty contained water. Of the eight selected boxes, only one was revealed to contain water and one contained sand. It was not revealed whether any of the remaining six boxes contained water.
* A [[Psychometry (paranormal)|psychometric psychic]] claimed to be able to receive personal information about the owner of an object by handling the object itself. In order to avoid ambiguous statements, the psychic agreed to be presented with both a watch and a key from each of twelve different people. She was to match keys and watches to each owner. According to the prior agreement, she had to match at least nine out of the twelve sets, but she succeeded in only two.
* During the program, another psychic was doing a sorting of 250 [[Zener cards]], guessing which of the five symbols was on each one. Random guessing should have resulted in about fifty correct guesses, so it was agreed in advance that the psychic had to be right on at least eighty-two cards in order to demonstrate an ability greater than chance. However, she was able to get only fifty predictions correct, which is no better than random guessing.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Polidoro|Polidoro 2003]], pp. 19–24&lt;/ref&gt;

===James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF)===
{{main|James Randi Educational Foundation}}
In 1996, Randi established the [[James Randi Educational Foundation]]. Randi and his colleagues publish in JREF's blog,  ''[http://web.randi.org/swift Swift]''. Topics have included the interesting mathematics of the [[one-seventh area triangle]], a classic geometric puzzle. In his weekly commentary, Randi often gives examples of what he considers the nonsense that he deals with every day.&lt;ref name="si-fakers"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Randi |first=James |date=July 2005 |title=Fakers and Innocents |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |volume=29 |issue=4 |issn=0194-6730 |accessdate=October 29, 2006 |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/2005-07/randi.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027131225/http://www.csicop.org/si/2005-07/randi.html |archivedate=October 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2003, the JREF annually hosted [[The Amaz!ng Meeting]], a gathering of [[scientist]]s, [[skeptic]]s, and [[atheist]]s.

It's in the holy book of God." He was given a note for his parents stating "Your boy Randi ... is not welcome at St. Cuthberts as he asks too many questions and he interrupts the teachers." &lt;ref name=CSICon/&gt;{{rp|24:40}}}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Holy Koolaid|title=The Magician James Randi on the Importance of Skepticism|date=2017-08-31|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZkfNc6TEAQ|accessdate=2017-09-02|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180705214436/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZkfNc6TEAQ|archivedate=July 5, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his essay "Why I Deny Religion, How Silly and Fantastic It Is, and Why I'm a Dedicated and Vociferous [[Brights movement|Bright]]," Randi, who identifies himself as an [[atheist]],&lt;ref name="No Religion"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Randi |first=James |date=August 5, 2005 |title=Our Stance on Atheism |journal=Swift |type=Newsletter |accessdate=January 27, 2011 |url=http://www.randi.org/jr/080505potential.html#14 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090710051137/http://www.randi.org/jr/080505potential.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has opined that many accounts in religious texts, including the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]], the miracles of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]], and the parting of the Red Sea by [[Moses]], are not believable. For example, Randi refers to the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] as being "impregnated by a ghost of some sort, and as a result produced a son who could walk on water, raise the dead, turn water into wine, and multiply loaves of bread and fishes" and questions how [[Adam and Eve]] "could have two sons, one of whom killed the other, and yet managed to populate the Earth without committing incest." He writes that, compared to the Bible, "''The Wizard of Oz'' is more believable. And much more fun."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Randi |first=James |date=July 25, 2003 |title=Why I Deny Religion, How Silly and Fantastic It Is, and Why I'm a Dedicated and Vociferous Bright |journal=Swift |type=Newsletter |accessdate=October 9, 2013 |url=http://www.randi.org/jr/072503.html |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091007191524/http://www.randi.org/jr/072503.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarifying his view of atheism, Randi has written "I've said it before: there are two sorts of atheists. One sort claims that there is no deity, the other claims that there is no evidence that proves the existence of a deity; I belong to the latter group, because if I were to claim that no god exists, I would have to produce evidence to establish that claim, and I cannot. Religious persons have by far the easier position; they say they believe in a deity because that's their preference, and they've read it in a book. That's their right."&lt;ref name="No Religion"/&gt;

In ''An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural'' (1995), he examines various spiritual practices skeptically. Of the meditation techniques of [[Prem Rawat|Guru Maharaj Ji]], he writes "Only the very naive were convinced that they had been let in on some sort of celestial secret."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Randi 1995|Randi 1995]], [http://www.randi.org/encyclopedia/Maharaj%20Ji.html "Maharaj Ji"]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, he was one of the signers of the [[Humanism and Its Aspirations|Humanist Manifesto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_III/Notable_Signers |title=Notable Signers |work=Humanism and Its Aspirations |publisher=[[American Humanist Association]] |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=September 28, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005105825/http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_III/Notable_Signers |archivedate=October 5, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a discussion with [[Kendrick Frazier]] at [[CSICon|CSICon 2016]], Randi stated "I think that a belief in a deity is ... an unprovable claim ... and a rather ridiculous claim. It is an easy way out to explain things to which we have no answer."&lt;ref name = CSICon&gt;{{cite web|title=A Conversation with James Randi|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQNuw2jjzg&amp;t=1s|website=YouTube |publisher=Center For Inquiry|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7:05}} He then summarized his current concern with religious belief as follows:

==One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge==
{{Main|One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge}}
The James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF) offered a prize of US$1,000,000 to anyone able to demonstrate a supernatural ability under [[Science|scientific]] testing criteria agreed to by both sides. Based on the paranormal challenges of [[John Nevil Maskelyne]] and [[Houdini]], the foundation began in 1996, when Randi put up $1,000 of his own money payable to anyone who could provide objective proof of the paranormal.&lt;ref name="Poulsen"&gt;{{cite news |title=Skeptic Revamps $1M Psychic Prize |first=Kevin |last=Poulsen |authorlink=Kevin Poulsen |url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/01/72482 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |location=San Francisco |date=January 12, 2007 |accessdate=April 11, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080831010919/http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/01/72482 |archivedate=August 31, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize money grew to $1,000,000, and had formal published rules.

On April 1, 2007, it was ruled that only persons with an established, nationally recognized media profile and the backing of a reputable academic were allowed to apply for the challenge, in order to avoid wasting JREF resources on frivolous claimants.&lt;ref name="Poulsen"/&gt;

On ''[[Larry King Live]]'', March 6, 2001, [[Larry King]] asked claimed medium [[Sylvia Browne]] if she would take the challenge and she agreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last1=Edward |first1=John |authorlink1=John Edward |last2=Jaroff |first2=Leon |authorlink2=Leon Jaroff |last3=Browne |first3=Sylvia |authorlink3=Sylvia Browne |last4=Van Praagh |first4=James |authorlink4=James Van Praagh |last5=Boteach |first5=Shmuley |authorlink5=Shmuley Boteach |last6=Kurtz |first6=Paul |authorlink6=Paul Kurtz |last7=Van Zandt |first7=Clint |last8=Graff |first8=Dale |interviewer=[[Larry King]] |title=Are Psychics for Real? |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0103/06/lkl.00.html |work=''[[Larry King Live]]'' |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=March 6, 2001 |accessdate=October 9, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131223174627/http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0103/06/lkl.00.html |archivedate=December 23, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Randi appeared with Browne on ''Larry King Live'' six months later, and she again appeared to accept his challenge.&lt;ref name="CNN09032001"&gt;{{cite interview |last1=Randi |first1=James |last2=Browne |first2=Sylvia |interviewer=Larry King |title=Are Psychics Real? |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0109/03/lkl.00.html |work=''Larry King Live'' |publisher=CNN |date=September 3, 2001 |accessdate=August 18, 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027032612/http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0109/03/lkl.00.html |archivedate=October 27, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Randi, she ultimately refused to be tested, and the Randi Foundation kept a clock on its website recording the number of weeks since Browne allegedly accepted the challenge without following through, until Browne's death in November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.randi.org/sylvia/ |title=The Sylvia Browne Clock |publisher=JREF |accessdate=October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, claimed psychic [[John Edward]] appeared on ''Headline Prime'', hosted by [[Glenn Beck]]. When asked if he would take Randi's challenge, Edward responded, "It's funny. I was on ''Larry King Live'' once, and they asked me the same question. And I made a joke [then], and I'll say the same thing here: Why would I allow myself to be tested by somebody who's got an adjective as a first name?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Beck, Glenn|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0610/27/gb.01.html|title=John Edward Shares Insights into His Career|publisher=CNN|date=October 27, 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407092520/http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0610/27/gb.01.html|archivedate=April 7, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beck simply allowed Edward to continue, ignoring the challenge.

Randi asked British businessman Jim McCormick, the inventor of the bogus [[ADE 651]] bomb detector, to take the challenge in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/231-a-direct-specific-challenge-from-james-randi-and-the-jref.html |title=A Direct, Specific, Challenge From James Randi and the JREF |last1=Randi |first1=James |year=2008 |work=Swift |publisher=JREF |type=Blog |accessdate=October 9, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123010157/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/231-a-direct-specific-challenge-from-james-randi-and-the-jref.html |archivedate=January 23, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Randi called the ADE 651 "a useless quack device which cannot perform any other function than separating naive persons from their money.

==Legal disputes==
Randi has been involved in a variety of legal disputes but says that he has "never paid even one dollar or even one cent to anyone who ever sued me."&lt;ref name="Randiwoo" /&gt; However, he says, he has paid out large sums to defend himself in these suits.

===Uri Geller===
Randi met magician [[Uri Geller]] in the early 1970s, and found Geller to be "Very charming. Likable, beautiful, affectionate, genuine, forward-going, handsome — everything!"&lt;ref name=nytmag/&gt; But Randi viewed Geller as a con-man, and began a long effort to expose him as a fraud.&lt;ref name=nytmag/&gt; According to Randi, Geller tried to sue him several times, accusing him of libel. Geller never won, save for a ruling in a Japanese court that ordered Randi to pay Geller one third of one percent of what Geller had requested. This ruling was canceled, and the matter dropped, when Geller decided to concentrate on another legal matter.&lt;ref name="Randiwoo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uri-geller.com/psir.htm |title=An End to the ''Uri Geller vs. Randi &amp; CSICOP'' Litigations? |last=Truzzi |first=Marcello |authorlink=Marcello Truzzi |publisher=UriGeller.com |accessdate=October 9, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121208201045/http://www.uri-geller.com/psir.htm |archivedate=December 8, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{wikisource|''Geller v. Randi''}}
In May 1991, Geller sued Randi and CSICOP for $15 million on a charge of slander, after Randi told the ''[[The New York Times International Edition|International Herald Tribune]]'' that Geller had "tricked even reputable scientists" with stunts that "are the kind that used to be on the back of cereal boxes", referring to the old spoon-bending trick. The court dismissed the case and Geller had to settle at a cost to him of $120,000, after Randi produced a cereal box which bore instructions on how to do the spoon-bending trick. Geller's lawyer Don Katz was disbarred mid-way into this action and Geller ended up suing him. After failing to pay before the deadline imposed by the court, Geller was sanctioned an additional $20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Uri Geller: Magician or Mystic?|last=Margolis|first=Jonathan|publisher=Orion Books|year=1999|isbn=978-1566490252|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1991/08/29/a-case-of-mind-over-matter/a9dd790d-6e7c-4cff-b232-19f17b7df272/|title=A Case of Mind Over Matter|last=Thompson|first=Tracy|date=August 29, 1991|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 29, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005051241/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1991/08/29/a-case-of-mind-over-matter/a9dd790d-6e7c-4cff-b232-19f17b7df272/|archivedate=October 5, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://urigellerdoit.blogspot.ca/|title=How does Uri Geller do it?|last=Cacho|first=Flavio|date=August 1, 2008|website=Blogger|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929232152/http://urigellerdoit.blogspot.ca/|archivedate=September 29, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="csicop-suitdismissed"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csicop.org/articles/uri_dis.html |title=Uri Geller Libel Suit Dismissed |date=August 1994 |website=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |publisher=Center for Inquiry |location=Amherst, NY |archiveurl=https://archive.li/20061205032721/http://www.csicop.org/articles/uri_dis.html |archivedate=December 5, 2006 |accessdate=June 3, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="skepfiles-suitdismssed"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skepticfiles.org/skeptic/randi032.htm |title=Lawsuit Against CSICOP Dismissed |website=The Skeptic Tank |publisher=Fredric L.

Geller sued both Randi and [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|CSICOP]]. CSICOP argued that the organization was not responsible for Randi's statements. The court agreed that including CSICOP was frivolous and dropped them from the action, leaving Randi to face the action alone, along with the legal costs. Geller was ordered to pay substantial damages, but only to CSICOP. The matter was subsequently settled out of court, and the details of the settlement have been kept confidential. The settlement also included an agreement that Geller would not pursue Randi for the award in the Japanese case or other outstanding cases.

===Other cases===
In 1993, a jury in the U.S. District Court in Baltimore found Randi liable for defaming Eldon Byrd for calling him a child molester in a magazine story and a "shopping market molester" in a 1988 speech. However, the jury found that Byrd was not entitled to any monetary damages after hearing testimony that he had sexually molested and later married his sister-in-law. The jury also cleared the other defendant in the case, CSICOP.&lt;ref&gt;West, Norris. P. (June 5, 1993).

Late in 1996, Randi launched a libel suit against a Toronto-area psychic named Earl Gordon Curley.&lt;ref name="jref-curley"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skeptictank.org/hs/curley2.htm |title=Action initiated ...|last=Randi |first=James |date=December 4, 1996 |work=James Randi Educational Foundation Info List |accessdate=October 29, 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925234219/http://www.skeptictank.org/hs/curley2.htm |archivedate=September 25, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Curley had made multiple objectionable comments about Randi on [[Usenet]]. Despite suggesting to Randi on Usenet that Randi should sue – Curley's comments implying that if Randi did not sue, then his allegations must be true – Curley seemed entirely surprised when Randi actually retained Toronto's largest law firm and initiated legal proceedings. The suit was eventually dropped in 1998 when Earl Curley died at the age of 51 of "alcohol toxicity."&lt;ref name="jref-curley2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mindspring.com/~anson/randi-hotline/1998/0025.html |title=Curley Confirmation + Sony Corp. and ESP, More on Theremin |last=Randi |first=James |date=July 8, 1998 |work=James Randi Educational Foundation Info List |accessdate=October 29, 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328131049/http://www.mindspring.com/~anson/randi-hotline/1998/0025.html |archivedate=March 28, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}{{failed verification|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
When he hosted his own radio show in the 1960s, Randi lived in a small house in [[Rumson, New Jersey]], that featured a sign on the premises that read: "Randi — Charlatan". In a Fort Lauderdale public library in 1986, Randi, who had recently moved to Florida, met Venezuelan artist José Alvarez (born Deyvi Orangel Peña Arteaga).

That's all there is to it. Hey, it's too bad, but I've got to make room. I'm using a lot of oxygen and such&amp;nbsp;— I think it's good use of oxygen myself, but of course, I'm a little prejudiced on the matter."&lt;ref name="SF-Weekly" /&gt;

Randi underwent his final chemotherapy session on December 31, 2009, later saying that his chemotherapy experience was not as unpleasant as he had imagined it might be.&lt;ref name="OnAndOffChemo"/&gt; In a video posted April 12, 2010, Randi stated that he has been given a clean bill of health.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=_WyzM_TsIXc|title=James Randi Speaks Homeopathy Week 2010|link=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 21, 2010, blog entry, Randi [[Coming out|came out]] as [[Homosexuality|gay]], a move he said was inspired by seeing the 2008 biographical drama film ''[[Milk (film)|Milk]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/914-how-to-say-it.html |title=How To Say It? |last=Randi |first=James |date=March 21, 2010 |work=Swift |publisher=JREF |type=Blog |accessdate=October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWDYITbLyTg |title=James Randi – A Skeptic Comes Out at 81 |website=For Good Reason |publisher=JREF |host=[[D.

Randi has never smoked, taken narcotics, or become inebriated, saying "that can easily just fuzz the edges of my rationality, fuzz the edges of my reasoning powers, and I want to be as aware as I possibly can. That means giving up a lot of fantasies that might be comforting in some ways, but I'm willing to give that up in order to live in an actually real world."&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;

In a video released on October 16, 2017, Randi revealed that he had recently suffered a minor [[stroke]], and that he was under medical advice not to travel during his recovery, so would be unable to attend [[CSICon]] 2017 in Las Vegas later that month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Randi|first1=James|title=Video message to CSICon attendees|url=https://www.facebook.com/CSIConference/videos/1484609861615742/|website=Facebook|publisher=CSICon - Skeptical Inquirer Conference|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political views ==
Randi is a registered Democrat. He wept when [[Barack Obama]] took office as President of the United States. He saw it as a large step forward for the United States to elect a black man President and thought electing a woman would be another such step.&lt;ref name="theesp.eu"/&gt; &lt;!-- The passage in question starts at 56:12 and ends at 59:51 in the podcast. --&gt;

==Comments on illegal drugs and Social Darwinism==
On April 28, 2009, Randi stated on the James Randi Educational Foundation website that he wanted illegal drugs to be legalized so that users could kill themselves.&lt;ref name="following up"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/533-following-up.html|title=Following Up ...|author=James Randi|website=Randi.org|date=28 April 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118062932/http://archive.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/533-following-up.html|archivedate=January 18, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''The Heretics: Adventures with the Enemies of Science'' (2013), author Will Storr brought up Randi's comments on illegal drugs during an interview. In the interview, Randi stated that he thinks "exactly the same thing about smoking" and that smokers "should be allowed to smoke themselves to death and die."&lt;ref name="storr"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hEItqk4-vrQC&amp;pg=PT240#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|first=Will |last=Storr |title=The Heretics: Adventures with the Enemies of Science|publisher=Pan Macmillan|year=2013  |isbn=978-1447204527 |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Randi proceeded to call himself "a believer in [[Social Darwinism]]."&lt;ref name="storr"/&gt; These comments evoked unrest in parts of the Skeptic community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailygrail.com/Skepticism/2013/2/James-Randi-Let-Survival-the-Fittest-Act-Itself-Out-Those-Low-IQ-and-Mental-Aberra|title=James Randi: Let Survival of the Fittest "Act Itself Out" On Those With Low IQ and "Mental Aberrations" - The Daily Grail|website=www.dailygrail.com|accessdate=September 3, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170624042515/http://www.dailygrail.com/Skepticism/2013/2/James-Randi-Let-Survival-the-Fittest-Act-Itself-Out-Those-Low-IQ-and-Mental-Aberra|archivedate=June 24, 2017|df=mdy-all|date=2013-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalskeptics.com/forums/showthread.php?t=254325|title=Randi and Storr's The Heretic - International Skeptics Forum|website=www.internationalskeptics.com|accessdate=September 3, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904010945/http://www.internationalskeptics.com/forums/showthread.php?t=254325|archivedate=September 4, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 March 2013, the website DoubtfulNews.com published a news story in which Randi claimed to have been misquoted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The statement "I'm a believer in social Darwinism," did not come from me. In fact, I had to look up the expression to learn what was being referred to. This attack appears to be calling me a Nazi, nothing less. I demand that Mr. Storr refer me to the original sources to which we assume he has referred. Until then, I'll only say that he has carefully selected phrases and statements out of context, not the sort of referencing that I would have expected from him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doubtfulnews.com/2013/03/james-randi-responds-to-storrs-social-darwinism-quote|title=James Randi responds to Storr's 'Social Darwinism' quote|date=March 1, 2013|publisher=|accessdate=September 3, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903211337/http://doubtfulnews.com/2013/03/james-randi-responds-to-storrs-social-darwinism-quote/|archivedate=September 3, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 2 March 2013, Randi posted an elaborative comment on that same news story, maintaining that he would never have called himself a Social Darwinist, since he "only recently learned in detail what that term really means" and was "quite ignorant of the history of the movement organized around that false idea."&lt;ref name="randi comment"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doubtfulnews.com/2013/03/james-randi-responds-to-storrs-social-darwinism-quote/#comment-130418|title=James Randi responds to Storr's 'Social Darwinism' quote|date=March 1, 2013|publisher=|accessdate=September 3, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903211337/http://doubtfulnews.com/2013/03/james-randi-responds-to-storrs-social-darwinism-quote/#comment-130418|archivedate=September 3, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Randi accepted "that the conversation with Mr. Storr went just as described" and conceded that he "sometimes speaks on things about which [he knows] very little":

&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm well aware that I sometimes "shoot from the hip" and speak on things about which I know very little. In this present situation, I published my personal opinions about drug addiction without knowing very much about the neuroscience behind addiction, or the addiction recovery field. Not only did I say some deeply regrettable and insensitive things, but as I've learned more about the questions and issues at hand, I accept that I have been wrongheaded on a number of topics related to these issues. Even at 84, I'm still learning. Please bear with me, folks.&lt;ref name="randi comment" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1990 Kalven was inducted into the [[Ohio Women's Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odjfs.state.oh.us/women/halloffame/bio.asp?ID=153 Janet Kalven] Ohio Women's Hall of Fame Bio.&lt;/ref&gt; Kalven was the 2003 co-recipient of the Enduring Spirit Award, presented by MUSE: The Cincinnati Women's Choir.&lt;ref&gt;Muse: The Cincinnati Women's Choir, [http://www.musechoir.org/support/enduringspirit Enduring Spirit Award], Past Recipients.&lt;/ref&gt; She was a trustee of Housetop Center for Women's Ministries.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine of Siena Virtual College, [http://www.catherineofsiena.net/about/trustusa.asp Housetop Center for Women's Ministries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023070026/http://www.catherineofsiena.net/about/trustusa.asp |date=2015-10-23 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the women influenced by Kalven's work at Grailville were [[Mary E. Hunt]] and [[Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza]].

Of her work, Kalven declared, &lt;blockquote&gt;
''I ground my hope for the world and for the Grail chiefly in the strength of women, women who develop all of their gifts and talents, women who act together generously and in hope to bring into reality their vision of a world where difference does not connote domination, a world where each person and culture will grow and enrich the others, a world where a hope-filled future awaits every child. We hold fast to our conviction that terror, poverty, and oppression will not have the last word.''&lt;ref&gt;Janet Kalven, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qdisQjr5xfkC ''Women Breaking Boundaries: A Grail Journey, 1940-1995''] (SUNY Press 1999): 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Pitts''' (1663–1735?) was an Englishman who was taken into slavery by Barbary pirates from Algeria in 1678 at the age of fourteen or fifteen. Little is known about Pitts aside from what is revealed in his narrative concerning his time held captive in Northern Africa, during which time he went through three masters ranging widely in their cruelty towards him over the course of more than fifteen years, with whom he travelled to Cairo and Alexandria. Though he escaped between the years 1693 and 1694, it was not until 1704 that Pitts first published his account. Pitts's ''A True and Faithful Account of the Religion and Manners of the Mohammetans, with an Account of the Author's Being Taken Captive'' includes descriptions of his capture and captivity, including some of the first English descriptions of Islamic rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Pitts, Joseph. ''A True and Faithful Account of the Religion and Manners of the Mohammetans, with an Account of the Author's Being Taken Captive'' (1704) reprinted in ''Piracy, Slavery, and Redemption: Barbary Captivity Narratives from Early Modern England'', ed. Daniel J. Vitkus (New York: Columbia University Press, 2001), 218–340&lt;/ref&gt; Converting to the religion while a slave, Pitts was the first Englishman to record the proceedings of the hajj, one of the five pillars of Islam. Pitts also describes the people of seventeenth-century North Africa (whom he calls Turks or Mohammetans) in detail, providing particulars on their manner of eating and dressing, the customs of their religion and marriage, and their economic and slave systems. Though its accuracy is debatable, Pitts’s narrative was the first and most detailed description of the religion of Islam and the manners of Muslims written by a European during the seventeenth century.

== Pitts and the hajj ==

It was during Pitts’s time with his last master that he made his journey to [[Mecca]] to complete the [[hajj]]. Having converted to Islam under the urgings and tortures of his second master Ibrahim, Pitts departed for the hajj with his third master around 1685. His account described many of the aspects of the Islamic pilgrimage including the hajj caravans, the rites at Mecca, and the customary but not mandatory visit to [[Medina]]. Much of Pitts's account of the hajj can be verified as accurate, but there is debate as to the truthfulness of some of his relations.

=== Initial rites ===

As a pilgrim, Pitts participated in the initial rites upon arriving in Mecca. This time is filled with the pilgrims' first tawaf, cleansing and drinking at the [[Zamzam Well]], and completion of the sa 'y or sa 'i. Scholars seem to disagree as to what brought about this tradition, whether a re-enactment of Mohammad's reclaiming of the temple for Islam or that of the seven planets rotating around the sun.&lt;ref name="InsideMecca"&gt;''Inside Mecca''. Dir. Taghi Amirani &amp; Anisa Mehdi. National Geographic Television, 2003. DVD; Wolfe, Michael. ''One Thousand Roads to Mecca''. New York: Grove Press, 1997. xxii–xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the real reasoning or meaning behind the seven turnings around the Ka ‘ba, it became a part of the Islamic tradition of the hajj and was being performed by pilgrims immediately upon their arrival well before Pitts’s time. After this ritual is the cleansing at the Zamzam Well, something Pitts seems to have left out of his narrative. Peters describes the Islamic legend tracing the origins of this well to a time when Abraham’s wife Hagar was left in the middle of the desert with their son Ishmael who was dying of thirst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Peters|first=F.E.|title=The Hajj: The Muslim Pilgrimage to Mecca and the Holy Places|location=Princeton|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1994|pages=197 &amp; 199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desperately running back and forth in search of water between two low hills called Safa and Marwa, God brought forth water from a spot in the desert for Hagar to give to her child.&lt;ref name="InsideMecca" /&gt; An example of this interaction with the Zamzam Well shortly after the tawaf can be found in an account by Ali Bey al-Abbasi, a Spaniard who went on the hajj in 1807.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Michael. ''One Thousand Roads to Mecca''. New York: Grove Press, 1997. 146 &amp; 149; Peters, F.E. ''The Hajj: The Muslim Pilgrimage to Mecca and the Holy Places''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994. 197 &amp; 199.&lt;/ref&gt;  In chapter 7 of his narrative, Pitts mentions the drinking of the water but not in connection with these initial rites. Whether this is due to a mistake by Pitts or a genuine difference in the order of the hajj of the 1600s is hard to determine. However, this initial water rite then brings pilgrims to what is called the sa ‘y, a recreation of Hagar’s desperate search for water which they complete by running back and forth between the same hills seven times. Today this is completed within the mosque in Mecca called Masjid al-Haram. During Pitts’s time and up until the 1950s, this was completed out on the street.&lt;ref name="InsideMecca" /&gt;

=== Mount Arafat ===

The vigil at Mount Arafat is another important aspect of the hajj which Pitts discusses. In chapter 7, Pitts says that they leave Mecca to visit “a certain hill called Gibbel el orphat (or el-Arafat), i.e., the Mountain of Knowledge.” Here he witnesses them perform Yawm al-Wukuf or the Day of Standing Together before God. Islamic legend explains that this hill was the place where Adam and Eve met after their expulsion from the Garden of Eden as well as where the Day of Judgment will take place. For pilgrims, it is “a place set aside for spiritual reunion, where pilgrims travel to re-form family ties, seek pardon, and re-collect their spirits.”&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Michael. ''One Thousand Roads to Mecca''. New York: Grove Press, 1997. xxii–xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; Though it is the “how, when, and where [pilgrims] receive this honorable title of hajji for which they are at all this pains and expense," Pitts claims that as to "why they so solemnly approach this mountain beyond any other place and receive from hence the title of hagges" he did not know, adding he gave "but little heed to these delusions."&lt;ref&gt;Pitts, "A True and Faithful Account", Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt; He describes the times that they perform their preparations for the prayers and rites to be completed while at the hill, and how "they [beg] earnestly for the remission of their sins and [promise] newness of life using a form of penitential expressions and thus continuing for the space of four or five hours."&lt;ref&gt;Pitts, ''A True and Faithful Account'', Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trauma ==

Pitts was subject to numerous forms of [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] during his enslavement.  These included:

* [[Blunt trauma|Physical trauma]], when he was repeatedly beaten by his patrons.
* [[Slavery|Enslavement]] trauma, described by Orlando Patterson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Patterson|first=Orlando|title=Slavery and Social Death|year=1982|publisher=Harvard College|location=Cambridge|isbn=067481083X|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a form of social death, wherein trauma is derived from the severance from any form of autonomy.
* [[Adoption]] trauma, wherein there is a traumatic component to being separated from the parent and later adopted by another.  Pitts's adoption, in emotion if not in law, by his third patroon had traumatic ramifications on Pitts' [[Identity (social science)|identity]]. 
Due to these traumatic experiences Pitts developed a form of [[PTSD]].  Many scholars of memoir and PTSD have noted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peres|first=Julio F. P.|author2=Alexander Moreira-Almeida, Antonia Gladys Nasello and Harold G. Koenig|title=Spirituality and Resilience in Trauma Victims|journal=Journal of Religion and Health|year=2007|pages=343–350|doi=10.1007/s10943-006-9103-0|volume=46|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Homans|first=Margaret|title=Adoption Narratives, Trauma and Origins|journal=Narrative|date=January 2006|volume=14|pages=4–26|doi=10.1353/nar.2005.0026}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the memoirs of the traumatised often take the form of a "working out" of the trauma, an examination of the causes and meanings of the trauma by a slow and steady examination of events to make sense of them.  This reflects itself in Pitts's writing in the slow and steady buildup to the chapters that talk about the incidents of severe trauma, such as the beating received from his first and second masters and the emotional complexities of his [[Religious conversion#Islam|conversion]] and later adoption.

== Sexuality, women, and slavery in Pitts's narrative ==

Pitts does not often mention women in his writings. It appears there are very few opportunities for him to be around women of any sort of status. However, the encounters he does write about give good insight into the Western views of Islamic attitudes about women. Pitts is not a stranger to violence. He is captured, enslaved, tortured, sold, and endures countless hardships throughout his journey. Pitts encounters violence against women several times in his account, most notably when describing the Imperial Turkish camps. He writes that the soldiers are "apt to drink, and are abominably rude, insomuch that it is very dangerous for any woman to walk in any by-place but more dangerous for boys, for they are extremely given to sodomy…" (236). In this passage, and in the context surrounding it, Pitts only mentions the danger to women once and focuses more acutely on the sin of sodomy amongst the soldiers. This shows that sexual violence is normalised for Pitts; he is much more concerned about the sin of sodomy than the sin of rape. He focuses intently on the immorality of sodomy but says nothing of the immorality of raping a woman.

In his discussion of marriage, Pitts describes how the marriage agreement takes place between the groom and the father of the bride. The woman's possible feelings or misgiving about the union are not mentioned at all. Pitts appears to perceive women as having little to no power in their relationships with men (242). He also discusses the idea of divorce and of Muslim men having multiple wives. According to Pitts, divorce is fairly common in the Islamic world and both parties are free to remarry afterwards. Multiple wives are not as common though; Pitts reports that very few men have multiple wives except out in the rural areas (243). These notions of power in relation to females are very much based in English ideas. Women in England gave up their property and dowries to their husbands upon marriage. Divorce was not common nor easy in England, although Pitts never details if a woman is allowed to ask for a divorce. Multiple wives were not as common among the middle and lower class of Muslim society; if Pitts did not rub elbows with the elite he would not have seen this phenomenon.

Pitts details a visit to a slave market in Cairo while he is on the hajj with one of his masters. In the market place, Pitts observes the selling of women and men. While men are forced to act out tricks to show off their strength and abilities like a horse show, the women are treated in a different manner. Women would be dressed in fine clothing when being exposed in markets, in hopes of catching a buyer's eye.&lt;ref name="Pitts1704" /&gt; Pitts says that while the women's faces were veiled, men were allowed to freely view their faces, to feel the inside of their mouths and teeth, and to caress their breasts. If a woman's virginity was questioned, slave traders would sometimes permit a potential buyer to escort the she-slave into a private tent, allowing the customer to discover the answer to the question themselves.&lt;ref name="Pitts1704" /&gt; He notes that many of the slaves are women and children as the men are kept as rowing slaves aboard ships. He also describes many of the people as "Muscovites and Russians, and from those parts and some of the emperor of Germany's parts" (270). These slaves have lighter skin, and they are dressed in fine clothing so they will fetch a higher price at auction.  The slaves are examined much like animals; buyers are allowed to checked their teeth, muscles, and stature to get an idea of the overall health of a slave.

== Pitts and his masters ==

Pitts served a total of three masters, with varying degrees of treatment. Not very much insight is given of his first master, but we do know that his second master, Ibrahim, treated him very poorly (318).&lt;ref name="Pitts1704"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pitts|first=Joseph|title=A True and Faithful Account of the Religion and Manners of the Mohammetans, with an Account of the Author's Being Taken Captive|year=1704|publisher=Exon|page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of Pitts' capture, he mentions the poor diet that they were fed was equal to the treatment they received. When planning a mutinous revolt, Pitts describes how the rebellion was discovered. A man who was suspected of the idea of the uprising was brought forward in front of his fellow captives. Pitts states: ‘The captain, with a great rope, gave him about an hundred blows on his buttocks, but he would not confess the fact, generously choosing rather to suffer himself than to bring us all under the bastinadoes also’ (228).  Ellen Friedman points out that the free Muslim man’s diet was no better than the captives’.&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedman|first=Ellen|title=Christian Captive at Hard Labor|journal=The International Journal of African Historical Studies|pages=116–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friedman also addresses that captives were treated harshly to make certain that they were kept in line and knew their place. Their self-worth was often undermined and the captives would be humiliated in front of their companions. Robert Davis, in the book ''Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast, and Italy'', says that ceaseless beatings and humiliation are established at the beginning of the capture to not only frighten new slaves, but to ensure silent obedience as well. Many slaves watched as their companions were reprimanded into bloody unconsciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Robert|title=Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast, and Italy, 1500–1800|publisher=Hampshire: Palgrave Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pitts’ narrative then turns to the forcing of converting to Islam. He states: ‘It hath been affirmed by some that the slaves that are sold in this country are never compelled to turn to the Mohammetan religion.’ While this is deemed true, there are rare cases like Pitts who have been forced into conversion. His second master, Ibrahim, had hung Pitts upside down, revealing the bottoms of his bare feet and dealing out 300 blows with a cudgel. Though Pitts had changed religions, Ibrahim treated him just as maliciously as he had before, beating Pitts until his blood poured onto the ground. This type of treatment was unusual. The Qur'an instructs masters to treat their slaves with firm kindness. Though they might not have shared the same expectations about work and life, master and slaves mutually understood and shared “a bundle of mutual obligations.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lovejoy|first=Paul E.|title=The Ideology of Slavery in Africa|year=1981|publisher=Beverly Hills: Sage Publications|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves were meant to be kept healthy to work efficiently. If slaves were unproductive in their line of work, then they would be punished.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Ellen G. "Christian Captive at Hard Labor." ''The International Journal of African Historical Studies'' 13.4 (n.d.): 616-32; Clissold, Stephen. ''The Barbary Slaves''. 1st ed. Totowa: Rowman Littlefield, 1977. 86–101&lt;/ref&gt;

Pitts’ third and last master was more of an ideal master. While Pitts wanted nothing to do with his master from the beginning, he soon became affectionate towards him when he saw that the master intended to give him a letter of freedom (323). Pitts describes his master treating him like a son, seeing as he had no children or relatives to love. Pitts also saw him in a fatherly light and, after given the letter of freedom, continued to stay with him for he was so kind. Freeing a slave was looked at as a great act of piety, and the act could allow the slave master to be forgiven of his sins. Even serious sins such as murder could be forgiven by the freeing of a slave. When Pitts makes the decision to leave, escaping back to his native homeland, he becomes conflicted with the situation of whether or not he should leave his fatherlike master who had made promises of leaving all of his belongings to Pitts after his death (332).

== Controversy ==

=== Conversion ===

At the time period in which Pitts's narrative was written, many other writers of slave narratives were claiming, like Pitts, to have been forced or tricked into converting to Islam. However, research suggests that such claims were likely to be false. Research suggests that North Africa was religiously very tolerant at this time and that Christian captives who converted were likely to benefit from lying about having converted because the English Christians—their own families included—would have persecuted them.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, Claire. "Lust, Greed, Torture, and Identity: Narrations of Conversion and the Creation of the Early Modern Renegade." ''Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East'' 29.2 (2009): 259–268. Project MUSE. Web. 1 March 2013. &lt;http://muse.jhu.edu/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This research suggests that Pitts might have done the same and that Pitts's alleged experience of having been forcibly converted would have been a special case, if true at all. More research, suggesting that Islam and renegades were often vilified in British culture and media, gives Pitts another reason to have lied about his conversion. Researchers describe the way, in English theatre at this time, renegades were often considered to be on par with Satan-worshipers and atheists, and traitors to their countries.&lt;ref&gt;Matar, Nabil. "The Renegade in English Seventeenth-Century Imagination." ''Studies in English Literature 1500–1900''. 33.3 (1993): 489–505; Clissold, Stephen. ''The Barbary Slaves''. 1st ed. Totowa: Rowman Littlefield, 1977. 86–101; Colley, Linda. ''Captives''. 1st ed. New York: Pantheon Books, 2002. 99–134.&lt;/ref&gt;  In direct reference to Pitts's writings, some research brings up the way that Pitts admitted to having been tempted to remain a Muslim, as well as admitting to the advantages offered him by doing so.&lt;ref&gt;Colley, Linda. ''Captives''. 1st ed. New York: Pantheon Books, 2002. 99–134. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical abuse ===

There is controversy within the academic community as to the veracity of the abuse that Pitts, and many of his fellow captives, received at the hands of their masters.  Many scholars cast doubt on Pitts’s account.  Claire Norton posits various reasons why beating a slave as a form of proselytisation would have been illogical.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, Claire. "Lust, Greed, Torture, and Identity."&lt;/ref&gt; A slave beaten into conversion would be of no economical value as Muslims were socially pressured to free their slaves once they converted.  The Barbary Coast was also very egalitarian in its religious diversity, Christian services being held in various places, decreasing the likelihood that a Christian would have no place in Islamic society.

Other scholars, such as Robert Davis, also doubt the validity of many slave narratives while allowing that the use of violence against one slave served “as a warning to all the other slaves who might witness or hear of it to be on their best behavior.”&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Robert C. ''Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters''. 1st ed. New York: Palgrave MacMillan, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Pitts himself discredits the forced conversion trope, stating that this was a rare occurrence, “though it was my hard fortune to be so unmercifully dealt with.” However, Pitts provides a reason why his masters would have used violent force against him, namely that one of his masters had a sordid past and hoped to unburden his sins by forcing Pitts to convert and then freeing him, a holy rite within Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Pitts, ''A True and Faithful Account'', Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1089">The '''Kazan International Festival of Muslim Cinema (KIFMC)''' was created in 2005. It takes place at the beginning of September in the town of [[Kazan]], [[Russia]].

==History==
Initially it was supposed to be a mobile festival between Muslim regions in Russia and other States of the Muslim world, and the city of Kazan was chosen to be a start point, because it is the biggest Islamic city in the northern hemisphere.

The President of the Republic [[Tatarstan]]  (an autonomous republic within the Russian Federation) insisted that KIFMC should be the Culture Brand of the capital of the Republic "Kazan", which became the permanent residence for the festival,  and city name has been added to the name of the festival.

The '''Kingdom of Reman''' or '''Kingdom of Rahman''' ({{lang-ms|Kerajaan Reman}}; [[Jawi script|Jawi]]: كراجأن رمان; {{Lang-th|รามัน}}; {{RTGS|''Raman''}}) was a [[landlocked]] traditional [[Malay people|Malay]] kingdom established in the northern [[Malay Peninsular]]. It became one of the seven states of [[Pattani Kingdom|Persekutuan Pattani Besar]] (The Great Pattani Federation) between 1810 and 1902. Tuan Mansor, a member of the [[Pattani]] aristocracy was ascended to the throne of Reman in 1810. Until 1909, the boundary of the state was not only confined to the present-day [[Raman District]], but also covered most of [[Yala province]] in [[Thailand]], [[Hulu Perak District|Hulu Perak]] and parts of [[Ulu Kelantan (federal constituency)|Ulu Kelantan]] in [[Malaysia]].

==Etymology==
The name of the state may be derived from a [[Kelantan-Pattani Malay|Pattani Malay]] word ''Rama' '', [[cognate]] to [[standard Malay]] ''Ramai'', meaning "a large assembly". It is likely associated to the growing settlement founded in the area by the late 18th century.

The earliest English-language reference of the state was made in 1818, between an agreement by the  [[Governor of Prince of Wales' Island]], [[John Alexander Bannerman|John Bannerman]] to Tuan Long Mansur, the King of Reman in [[Kroh]]. While the second English-reference of the kingdom was written in 1824 by [[John Anderson (diplomatic writer)|John Anderson]], a Scottish diplomatic agent that recorded Reman as one of the seven states of Pattani. The territory also referred to as Rahman and Rehman in English and ''Raman'' (รามัน) in Thai. Another colonial entry was made in 1826, where [[Henry Burney]],  a British commercial traveller and diplomat for the [[British East India Company]] acknowledged that Reman as one of the fourteen polity that pay tribute to the Siamese by the representatives in the superintending states of [[Nakhon Si Thammarat Province|Nakhon Si Thammarat]] and [[Songkhla]].&lt;ref name="Tiki Mambang 2016"&gt;{{harvnb|Tiki Mambang|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boon 2010"&gt;{{harvnb|Boon|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origin===
The state of Reman was founded in [[Pattani Sultanate|Pattani]] between the older principalities of [[Pattani Province|Pujut]], [[Yala Province|Jalor]] and [[Ra-ngae District|Legeh]].&lt;ref name="Tiki Mambang 2016"&gt;{{harvnb|Tiki Mambang|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orang Kelantan 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|Orang Kelantan|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emerged as a single polity under Tuan Tok Nik Tok Leh in 1810. Tuan Tok Nik, also known as Tuan Mansor, a Pattani nobleman, was appointed to observe the [[tin mining|mining-activities]] in the area during the reign of [[Pattani Kingdom#Chronology of Rulers|Muhammad Raja Bakar]], the Sultan of Pattani.&lt;ref name="Orang Kelantan 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|Orang Kelantan|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the late 18th century, he and his followers settled in the [[Kroh|Kroh Plateau]], an area that already witnessed a mass [[Human migration|exodus]] of people fleeing from the civil unrest in the Pattani plains since 1785.&lt;ref name="Boon 2010"&gt;{{harvnb|Boon|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1808, Tuan Tok Nik desiring to establish more political [[autonomy]] and control in the area commenced a campaign to obtain an independence from Pattani suzerainty. The campaign rapidly spiraled into a [[civil war]] within the domestic sphere. The [[Thailand|Siamese]], seizing the opportunity of the unrest began to mobilised its force to attack the Kingdom. Severely weakened by the incursion from both sides, this serves as a fatal blow to the Pattani Sultanate, as the Siamese was proved to be victorious in the area.&lt;ref name="Orang Kelantan 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|Orang Kelantan|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The triumphant Siamese then led a reformation within the borders of Pattani in 1810. Pattani was morphed to become a [[confederation]] with 7 semi-autonomous Malay kingdoms. The states consist of Legeh, Nongchick, [[Pattani Sultanate|Pattani]], Reman, Saiburi, Yala and Yaring. Each state was with awarded a high-degree internal autonomy and administrative powers granted to the Malay king of the respected territory. A level of local revenue sources was also expected to be returned to the Siamese. Loyalty to the crown was observed and any rebellion against the Siamese will be convicted.

In the new governance system, Tuan Tok Nik was affirmed as the ruler of Reman. Spanning an area between the upper reach of [[Pattani River|Sungai Pattani]] to [[Ra-ngae District|Sungai Mas]] in the north and [[Lenggong]] down south, Reman was among the largest kingdom in the confederation.&lt;ref name="Boon 2010"&gt;{{harvnb|Boon|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Perak-Reman War of 1826===
The Perak-Reman war was an armed conflict due to the territorial dispute between the two states in [[Pengkalan Hulu|Kelian Intan]] and [[Kroh]]. Previously an [[Outpost (civilian)|outpost]] between the border of [[Perak]] and [[Pattani]] in the early 1780s, the mineral-rich area was captured and developed pursuant to the rise of Reman in 1790, becoming the heartland and integral part of state.

In 1826, [[Perak Sultanate#Siak Dynasty|Abdullah Muazzam Shah]] of Perak sought the assistance of the [[British East India Company]] to regain control of the resource-rich territory. Shortly after, the Perakian forces was deployed to the [[Kroh|plateau]] and launch an [[Ambush|ambush attack]] into Reman. The sudden attacks caused the king of Reman, Tuan Mansor to retrieve from Kubu Kapeh to Klian Intan and later to Kuala Kepayang. It took several years for Reman to reconquer Kelian Intan and Kroh.&lt;ref name="Sembangkuala 2010"&gt;{{harvnb|Sembangkuala|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-War recovery and growth===
[[File:Elephants of Gerik.jpg|thumb|The Elephants of Gerik, taken in c. 1900. The Reman Kings were known to own hundreds of elephants, using the [[Working animal|beast of burden]] as the primary workhorse both in the field and in military. ]]
The strategic inland location between the east and west coast of the peninsular fuelled the growth of the kingdom during the post-war era.&lt;ref name="Sembangkuala 2010"&gt;{{harvnb|Sembangkuala|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by a period of relative stability and unprecedented prosperity due to the restoration of mining activities in the region monitored by Toh Nang Patani, a member of the Reman aristocrat family. Despite a few major battles against Perak in the border, it was usually won by Reman [[militia]], commanded by Mengkong Deleha, a renowned Reman fighter.&lt;ref name="Boon 2010"&gt;{{harvnb|Boon|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882, the hostilities between Reman and Perak formally come to an end when both parties sought to reconcile their respective borders. Under the truce of 1882, both parties, led by the British government, acted on behalf of the state of Perak and Tuan Jagung, the king of Reman as the representative of the Siamese, agreed that the new border shall be located along Bukit Nasha, some 5 kilometres south of [[Gerik]] town. ''Bukit Nasha'' "Nasha hill" is an abbreviation of ''Nak disahkan satu perjanjian'' (for the ratification under an agreement). &lt;ref name="Utusan Malaysia 1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Utusan Malaysia|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement was later updated in year 1899, where both parties mutually acknlowledged that the border shall be in Kerunai, an area located north of Gerik. Several [[boundary marker]]s were erected pursuant to the agreement, with each pillars standing 1 metre high and 1 metre wide. Each stones was set following the borders of Reman and Perak.&lt;ref name="Utusan Malaysia 1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Utusan Malaysia|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence movement===
[[File:Tuan Lebeh Long Raya.jpg|thumb|150px|Tuan Lebeh, the ''Long Raya'' (crown prince) of Reman Kingdom. He was convicted after the allegations of an uprising against the Siamese rule in 1902.]]

The rise of Independence movement in Reman was largely progressed from the wider Pan-Pattani [[Early Malay nationalism|Malay Nationalism]] manifested in the region. It was rooted from the loss of the Pattani [[sovereignty]] under the Siamese hands in 1810. The latter stage of 19th century to the early 20th century was characterised for a restoration of an ideal sovereign Pattani state, [[self-governance]] and a call for a [[autonomy|full-autonomy]], hoping to protect the native Malay soil and interest without the interference from the Siamese government.&lt;ref name="Khairul 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|Khairul|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1902, the Siamese, alarmed by the nationalist development in the south began a major military crackdown against the Malay leaders who were suspected to be plotting in the movement. Among the political elites that were arrested by the Siamese forces includes Tuan Lebeh Long Raya, the ''Raja Muda'' (crown prince) of Reman; Abdul Kadir Kamaruddin Syah, the Sultan of Pattani and Tengku Abdul Mutallib, the King of Teluban.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Khairul|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissolution and Annexation===
Tuan Lebeh was then charged in the Siamese court in [[Singgora]]. The trial found the crown prince of Reman to be guilty of [[treason]] and he was offered two sentence options: a 25 years imprisonment in Singgora or 20 years in [[Bangkok]]. Tuan Lebeh opted for the second sentence. He was then transferred to Bangkok via a Siamese vessel, Chamroen ({{Lang-th|จำเริญ}}). The ship sank during the voyage to Bangkok and the prince was believed to be perished in the disaster. Devastated by the news, the king died a few weeks later, without an [[heir apparent]].&lt;ref name="Sembangkuala 2010"&gt;{{harvnb|Sembangkuala|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1902 also witnessed that the Siamese government stripped the sovereign powers of all Pattani Malay sultans, rulers and aristocrats in wake of the uprising. The final blow was cultivated 4 years later in 1906, when the Siamese officially deliver an ultimatum to abolish all of the Pattani Malay states. All the seven states was then reunited under a single Pattani province ({{Lang-th|มณฑลปัตตานี}}; {{RTGS|''Monthon Pattani''}}) and administered by a Siamese governor. The newly created province was then divided into four territories ({{Lang-th|จังหวัด}}; {{RTGS|''changwat''}}) Pattani, Yala, Saiburi and Narathiwat, each headed by a high commissioner. Under the new administrative system, Reman was fully absorbed into Yala.&lt;ref name="Khairul 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|Khairul|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="text-align:justify; width:45%; float:right; padding: 10px; display:table; margin-left:10px;"&gt;"..Setul would not be of no great values to us, and although we might do doubt put forward a very good claim to its part of Kedah and secure it by insistence, I am inclined to think it would be more Politics to turn our claim to account by agreeing to renounce Setul if the Siamese Government will in its stead hand over to us the Lang-kawi Islands and that portion of Raman which comprise the watershed of the Perak River. Both these would constitute more velueable posessions to us than Setul. The Lang-kawi Islands furnish magnificent anchourages and such have been coveted by various foreign powers, whilst the lower part of Reman is rich in Tin"
&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;— [[Ralph Paget]], [[List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Thailand|British Minister to Thailand]], in his letter to [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]], [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs]] (29 April 1907) &lt;ref&gt;[http://exhibitions.nlb.gov.sg/aksara/4/gallery-4-p6.html AKSARA-The Passage of Malay Scripts]. Exhibitions.nlb.gov.sg. Retrieved on 26 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ignited by colonial ambitions, the [[British Empire|British]] aimed to expand its territories in the [[Far East|far east]]. By the dawn of 20th century, it has already acquired a collection of Malay polity consist of [[crown colonies]] and [[protectorates]] in the central-southern Malay peninsular. The British incorporated the areas into the [[Straits Settlements]] and the [[Federated Malay States]] between 1826 and 1895 respectively.

In 1909, alarmed by the growing ties between the rivalling [[German Empire|German colonial powers]] and the [[Siam|Siamese government]], especially in the [[Malay Peninsular|peninsular]], the British then sought to enter an agreement with the Siamese. The acquisition of the northern states was essential by the British, as it was strategically located in the mouth of [[Straits of Malacca]] and rich with [[tin]], an important commodity to fuel the need of British [[industrial revolution]] and trade by the late 19th century. This led to the Anglo-Siamese treaty of 1909 that [[Partition (politics)|break]] the peninsular between the Siamese and British territorial jurisdiction.

[[File:Siamese flag in Reman.png|thumb|The [[flag of Siam]] was last lowered in Reman Hilir (southern Reman) on 16 July 1909, marking the end of the Siamese rule in the territory. ]]
One of the highly contested areas by the British includes Reman district, which was then already absorbed into Yala territory in 1906. The area was known to be rich in [[Gold mining|gold-deposit]] and holds the largest [[tin]] reserve in the whole Peninsular.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ruxton|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thailand.org|}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the discussion between [[King Chulalongkorn]], the [[King of Siam]]; [[Ralph Paget]], British diplomat in Siam; [[Jens Westengard]], Siamese Adviser in Foreign Affairs and [[Prince Damrong]], Siamese [[Ministry of Interior (Thailand)|Ministry of the Interior]], it was acknowledged by all parties that the British agreed to relinquish it claims for [[Satun]] in exchange for [[Langkawi]] and lower Reman area, the British was also additionally required to provide a loan to finance the construction of the [[State Railway of Thailand#Southern Line|south line]] of [[State Railway of Thailand|Siamese State Railway]] that cost £4 million [[Pound sterling|pounds]] (1909).&lt;ref name="Thamsook Numnoncla 1971"&gt;{{harvnb|Thamsook Numnoncla|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Partition of Reman===
The [[Partition (politics)|partition]] mark the birth of Reman into two separate [[jurisdictions]], Reman Hulu (upper Reman) retained under [[Yala Province|Yala]] and Reman Hilir (southern Reman) absorbed into [[Hulu Perak]]. It was officially divided following the transfer ceremony held on 16 July 1909 in Kroh. The ceremony was attended by: Wan Muhammad Isa, Orang Kaya Menteri; Wan Muhammad Salleh, Orang Kaya-Kaya Seri Adika Raja; [[Ernest Woodford Birch|E.W. Birch]], the [[List of British Residents of Perak|British Resident of Perak]]; A.S. Jelf, MCS, Assistant Secretary to British Resident of Perak; H. Berkeley, District [[Magistrate]]; G. Simpson, Police Inspector of [[Kuala Kangsar]]; J.D. Kemp, Manager of Rahman Hydrolic Tin Limited, Klian Intan and Keluong Wan Husain, a noble from [[Betong, Thailand|Betong, Siam]].

The reading of the proclamation was done by Wan Husain as the representative for the Kingdom of Siam, declaring the sovereignty transfer of the territory from Siam to British. It was followed by the flag exchange ceremony that symbolises the end of Siamese rule and beginning of the Perak sovereignty in the lower Reman area.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arkib Negara Malaysia|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rulers of Reman, 1810–1902==

A century rule of Reman has established a mark in the two separate territories ([[Yala Province|Yala]] and [[Hulu Perak]]) that once form an integral [[Territory|domain]] of the kingdom. The areas till today are marked by a Pattani-Reman influence, bind together with a common culture, linguistic and heritage as a result from the emigration from the [[Pattani Province|Pattani lowlands]] during the Reman period.

Several monuments can be witnessed as testaments of the former splendor of the Reman Kingdom. This includes Istana Singgah (The Visiting Palace), the [[palace|palatial residence]] of the royal family in lower Reman. It is credited as one of the best example of the traditional architecture in the Kingdom. Located in [[Kroh|Kampung Selarong]], it was built in the late 19th century as a secondary palace away from the administrative centre of the kingdom in [[Raman District|Kota Baru]] (in present-day [[Yala Province|Yala]]). The manor was once a [[fortress]] of Tuan Lebeh before he was being arrested by the Siamese authorities due to a suspected uprising plot for Pattani independence. The [[cemetery|final resting place]] of Permaisuri Cik Neng, the Queen of Reman is also located nearby the palatial grounds, her death in 1915 was widely believed due to her devastation after the demise of the crown prince. The residence is currently privately owned by the descendants of Reman royal family.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dolasoh|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The waves of migration from the plains of Pattani also bought a strong Pattani based [[Malay dialect|linguistic heritage]]. The Reman dialect is largely based on [[Pattani Malay|Pattani form]] of Malay, nonetheless it has incorporated various peculiar features that denotes influence from the [[Thai language]], [[Perak Malay|Perakian]] and [[Kedahan Malay]] dialects. It constitute as a [[dialect continuum]] between the East and the West Coast Malay language. In Perak, the variant is also known locally as Longat Pattani Batu Kurau.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hazuki.R |2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various namesake of areas in Hulu Perak was derived from the Pattani settles to Reman, this includes [[Kroh]] (murky), a town that derives its name from the muddy [[reservoir]] built by the Reman settes to clean the [[Asian elephants|domesticated elephants]] owned by the king. The area has been renamed as [[Pengkalan Hulu]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pejabat Daerah dan Tanah Pengkalan Hulu|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Gerik]], a major settlement established in Reman during the rule of Tuan Jagong owes its name from "Gerit", an [[onomatopoeia]] for the sounds made by the [[Bamboo rat]], a native rodent that can be found in abundance in area.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Amal Espraza|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reman heritage is also widely survived in the [[Malay literature|local literature]] and [[Malay folklore|folklore]]. Among the prominent literature that composed during the Reman period was a ''[[pantun]]'' crafted by Tuan Tok Nik Tok Leh to Raja Andak, the wife of Dato’ Seri Lela, the commander of the Perakian troops during the Perak-Reman war of 1826. The pantun between Tuan Tok Nik to Raja Andak narrated the [[Concubinage|forbidden love]] between the two parties from the two rivalling sides of the war.&lt;ref name="Sembangkuala 2010"&gt;{{harvnb|Sembangkuala|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another prominent figure of Reman oral literature includes Mengkong Dehela, a local warrior, he is a central figure that largely credited on leading and defending Reman territories. Details of his epic battles are largely recorded in the local lore.&lt;ref name="Boon 2010"&gt;{{harvnb|Boon|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another visible legacy of the Reman period includes ''batu tanda'' ([[boundary marker]]), built in 1899 under the agreement between Perak and Reman, it signifies the historical border between the two states. The pillars still standing today despite a major [[Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909|border reformation]] in 1909, a reminder of the bygone era.&lt;ref name="Utusan Malaysia 1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Utusan Malaysia|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Catholic Church in [[Nigeria]]''' is mainly composed of a Latin hierarchy, joined in a national Episcopal Conference of Nigeria, ''and a single Eastern Catholic (transnational) see'', comprising
* 9 ecclesiastical provinces, each under a [[Metropolitan Archbishop]],
** with a total of 44 [[suffragan]] dioceses 
* two pre-diocesan jurisdictions : 
** one missionary [[apostolic vicariate]]s.
** ''a Maronite [[Apostolic Exarchate]], for all Western and Central Africa

There is an [[Apostolic Nunciature]] (papal diplomatic representation at emebassy-level) to Nigeria in the national capital [[Abuja]]; in it is also vested the papal Permanent Observer to [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS).

There are no titular sees. All defunct jurisdictions have current successor sees.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16949">A variety of [[cross]]es, both designs and physical objects, have been associated with [[Saint Patrick]], the [[patron saint]] of [[Ireland]]. Traditionally the [[cross pattee|cross pattée]] has been associated with him, but in more recent times the [[Saint Patrick's Saltire]] has also been linked to him.&lt;ref name="morley"&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://home.connect.ie/morley/cros_e.htm |title=St. Patrick's Cross |date=27 September 2007 |accessdate=29 June 2009 |first=Vincent |last=Morley}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some authors have stated however, that Patrick is not entitled to have a cross as a symbol since he was not a [[Christian martyrs|martyr]], unlike Saints [[Saint George|George]] and [[Saint Andrew|Andrew]].&lt;ref name="hm38"&gt;Hayes-McCoy, p.38&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saltire==
[[File:St Patrick's saltire.svg|thumb|right|Saint Patrick's Flag]]
{{main article|Saint Patrick's Saltire}}
Saint Patrick's Saltire is a red [[saltire]] on a white field. It is used in the insignia of the [[Order of Saint Patrick]], established in 1783,&lt;ref name="Galloway1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Galloway|first=Peter|title=The most illustrious order: the Order of St Patrick and its knights|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JVNmAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=March 1999|publisher=Unicorn|pages=171–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after the [[Acts of Union 1800]] it was combined with the [[Flag of England|Saint George's Cross of England]] and the [[Flag of Scotland|Saint Andrew's Cross of Scotland]] to form the [[Union Flag]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].  A saltire was intermittently used as a symbol of Ireland from the seventeenth century, but without reference to Saint Patrick.

The [[Pepys Library]]'s collection of [[broadside ballad]]s includes one from c.1690 called "Teague and Sawney: or The Unfortunate Success of a Dear-Joys Devotion by St. Patrick's Cross. Being Transform'd into the Deel's Whirlegig." It describes an Irishman ([[Taig|Teague]]) and Scot ([[Sawney]]), both stereotypically blockheaded, encountering a [[windmill]] for the first time and arguing over whether it is Saint Andrew's Cross or Saint Patrick's Cross.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cross pattée==
[[File:Cross-Pattee-Heraldry.svg|thumb|100px|A [[cross pattée]]]]
[[File:Strangford Road, road sign (04), October 2009.JPG|thumb|left|180px|[[Downpatrick]] road sign showing the cross pattée, October 2009]]
Some of the Order of St Patrick's symbols were borrowed from the pre-existing [[Friendly Brothers of St Patrick]], including the motto ''[[Quis separabit?]]'';&lt;ref name="Galloway1999"/&gt; however, the "Saint Patrick's Cross" used in the Friendly Brothers' badge was not a saltire.&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt; A 1783 letter to a Dublin newspaper criticising the Order's use of a saltire, asserted that "The Cross generally used on St Patrick's day, by Irishmen, is the Cross-Patee".&lt;ref name="fotw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flagspot.net/flags/ie-stpat.html|title=Ireland: St Patrick's Cross|date=6 June 2012|work=[[Flags of the World]]|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas Vincent Morley in 1999 characterised the Friendly Brothers' cross as a cross pattée, the Brothers' medallist in 2003 said that the shape varied somewhat, often approximating a [[Maltese Cross]].&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt; Varying illustrations of the badge figure in the Brothers' 1763 statute book,&lt;ref name="fotw"/&gt; a 1786 letter to ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'',&lt;ref&gt;

Though both ''pattée'' and ''Patrick'' begin with ''pat-'', the words are unrelated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/138965|title=pattée, ''adj.''|work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |date=June 2005 |accessdate=18 April 2013

==''Or a Cross Gules''==
Henry Gough in 1893 noted that Ireland was [[coat of arms of Ireland|represented by a harp]] in the [[Flags of the English Interregnum|flags of the Protectorate]], but at [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s funeral the national banners had crosses, Ireland's being a red cross on a gold field.&lt;ref name="gough1893"/&gt; Gough guesses [[Edward Bysshe]] may have co-opted the [[Walter de Burgh, 1st Earl of Ulster|de Burgh Earl of Ulster]] arms for the purpose.&lt;ref name="gough1893"/&gt; Gough suggests it gained currency in subsequent decades; it was called Patrick's Cross and shown alongside those of George and Andrew in various documents, including a 1697 drawing of [[William III of England|William III]], and  ''The Irish Compendium'' of 1722.&lt;ref name="gough1893"&gt;{{cite journal |year=1883 |last=Gough |first=Henry |title=St. Patrick's Cross |editor-first=George W. |editor-last=Marshall |journal=The genealogist |publisher=George Bell and Sons |location=London |volume=VII |pages=129–131 |url=https://archive.org/stream/genealogist07mars#page/n273 |accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1679 [[pamphlet]] account of heraldry states that the arms borne in the [[Crusades]] by the Irish Nation were "a red Cross in a yellow Field".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; "for Ireland".&lt;ref&gt;Holme, Chap.5, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; The [[County Galway]] unit of the [[Irish Volunteers]] in 1914 adopted a similar banner because "it was used as the Irish flag in [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]]'s time".&lt;ref name="hm200"&gt;Hayes-McCoy, p.200&lt;/ref&gt; The flag used by the King's Own Regiment in the Kingdom of Ireland, established in 1653, was a red saltire on a "taffey" yellow background.

In 1593–94, Irish Catholics in [[Habsburg Spain]] made unrealised plans for a "military order of Saint Patrick" to fight in the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]], whose knights would wear a [[cross moline]] badge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walsh|first=Micheline|year=1979|title=The Military Order of Saint Patrick, 1593|journal=Seanchas Ardmhacha: Journal of the Armagh Diocesan Historical Society|publisher=Armagh Diocesan Historical Society|volume=9|issue=2|pages=274–285|jstor=29740927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1935 article states that during the [[Confederate Ireland|Confederation]], "the true St. Patrick's Cross was carried as a square flag: a white cross on a green ground, with a red circle."&lt;ref&gt;

==Saint Patrick's Day badges==
[[File:Traditional-irish-stipatricksidayibadges.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of eight home-made badges composed of variously coloured crosses and saltires.|Traditional St. Patrick's Day badges from the early 20th century, from the [[Museum of Country Life]], Castlebar.]]
It was formerly a common custom to wear a cross made of paper or ribbon on [[St Patrick's Day]]. Surviving examples of such badges come in a variety of colours&lt;ref name="hm40"&gt;Hayes-McCoy, p.40&lt;/ref&gt; and they were worn upright rather than as saltires.&lt;ref name="morley"/&gt;

The second part of [[Richard Johnson (16th century)|Richard Johnson]]'s ''[[Seven Champions of Christendom]]'' (1608) concludes its fanciful account of St Patrick with, "the Irishmen as well in England as in that Country, do as yet in Honour of his Name, keep one day in the Year Festival, wearing upon their Hats each of them a Cross of red Silk, in Token of his many Adventures, under the Christian Cross".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |title=The renowned history of the seven champions of Christendom; St. George of England, St. Denis of France, St. James of Spain, St. Anthony of Italy, St. Andrew of Scotland, St. Patrick of Ireland, and St. David of Wales. |last=Johnson |first=Richard |location=London |year=1740 |page=193 |chapter=Of the Praise-worthy Death of St. Patrick ; how he buried himself : And for what Cause the Irishmen to this Day, do wear their Red Cross upon St. Patrick's Day. }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Irish soldiers stationed in Britain in 1628 reportedly wore red crosses on Patrick's Day "after their country manner".&lt;ref name="hm40"/&gt;

Thomas Dinely, an English traveller in Ireland in 1681, remarked that "the Irish of all stations and condicõns were crosses in their hatts, some of pins, some of green ribbon."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Swift]], writing to "[[Esther Johnson|Stella]]" of Saint Patrick's Day 1713, said "[[The Mall, London|the Mall]] was so full of crosses that I thought all the world was Irish".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The crosses were also associated with Irish regiments, who were reported in 1682 to have been seen wearing crosses of red ribbon on St Patrick's Day; and with the English court, who were said to have worn crosses in honour of St Patrick on the saint's day in 1726.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Charles |last=Nelson |title=Shamrock |location=Kilkenny |year=1991 |pages=49–50 |isbn=0 86314 200 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1740s, the badges pinned were multicoloured interlaced fabric.&lt;ref name="badges"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1890s, they were almost extinct, and a simple green [[Greek cross]] inscribed in a circle of paper (similar to the Ballina crest pictured).&lt;ref&gt;Colgan, p.351, fn.2&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Irish Times]]'' in 1935 reported they were still sold in poorer parts of Dublin, but fewer than those of previous years "some in velvet or embroidered silk or poplin, with the gold paper cross entwined with shamrocks and ribbons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Irishman's Diary: The Patrick's Cross |date=13 March 1935 |work=[[The Irish Times]] |publisher=ProQuest |pages=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8728">This is a '''list of bishops and patriarchs of Aquileia''' in northeastern Italy. For the ecclesiastical history of the diocese, see [[Patriarchate of Aquileia]].

From [[Council of Aquileia, 553|553]] until [[Council of Aquileia, 698|698]] the archbishops renounced Papal authority as part of the [[Schism of the Three Chapters]] and when they returned to the Roman fold they maintained the title [[patriarch]] which was adopted during this schism.

The Patriarchs gained the [[Countship of Friuli]] and the [[March of Carniola]] in 1077 and the [[March of Istria]] in 1209. The temporal authority of the patriarchate was lost on 7 July 1420 when its territories were secularized by [[Venice]].

The Patriarchate was dissolved in 1752 and its ecclesiastical authority divided between the [[Archbishop of Gorizia (Görz)]] and the [[Archbishop of Udine]].

In the small island state of [[Malta]], the church or chapel is a common feature of the landscape. Many churches in Malta dominate the skyline, and the domes and steeples can usually be seen from across the island. One can usually find the centre of a town or village by driving towards the parish church, although many towns and village cores feature two or more churches and chapels.

On the islands of Malta and [[Gozo]], which are two separate [[dioceses]], there are a total of 359 churches (313 in Malta and 46 in Gozo). Of these, 78 are [[parish]]es (63 in Malta and 15 in Gozo) and six are national parishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Charles Buttigieg, P.R.O., Archbishop's Curia, Malta| title=THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN CONTEMPORARY MALTA|date=1995-10-24|url=http://www.aboutmalta.com/grazio/church.html|accessdate=2007-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This means that there is a "church density" of slightly more than one church per square kilometer. In Malta, every locality has its [[parish church]], apart from two or three small localities. There are also localities that have more than one parish church, like [[Sliema]] and [[Birkirkara]], which have four parishes each. The list below lists most of the churches in Malta, Gozo and Comino, starting from the cathedrals, minor basilicas, parish churches and churches/chapels.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24973">A '''lunar mansion''' is a segment of the [[ecliptic]] (often called a station or house) through which the [[Moon]] passes in [[orbit of the Moon|its orbit]] around [[Earth]], often used by ancient cultures as part of their [[calendar]] system. In general, though not always, the [[zodiac]] is divided into 27 or 28 segments relative to the [[fixed stars]] – one for each day of the [[lunar month]]. (A [[Lunar month#Sidereal month|sidereal month]] lasts about 27.3 days.) The Moon's position is charted with respect to those fixed segments. Since the Moon's position at given stage will vary according to Earth's position in [[Earth's orbit|its own orbit]], the lunar mansions are an effective system for keeping track of the passage of seasons.

Various cultures have used sets of lunar mansions [[astrology|astrologically]]; for example, the [[Jyotisha]] astrological [[Nakshatra]]s of [[Hindu]] culture, the [[Arabic]] [[manzils]] (''[[manazil al-qamar]]''), the [[Twenty-Eight Mansions|28 mansions]] of [[Chinese astronomy]], and the 36 [[decans]] of [[Egyptian astronomy]]. [[Western astrology]] does not use mansions, but each [[astrological sign|zodiac sign]] covers 2 or 3 mansions. The Chinese system groups mansions into four groups related to the seasons.

The concept of the lunar mansions are considered to be [[Babylonia]]n in origin.&lt;ref&gt;S. Weinstock, 'Lunar Mansions and Early Calendars', ''Journal of Hellenic Studies'', LXIX (1949); ''cf''. also CCAG IX.1 138ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Yampolsky, 'The origin of the Twenty-eight Lunar Mansions', ''Osiris'', IX (1950), pp.62-83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I. E. Svenberg, 'Lunaria et Zodiologia Latina', ''Studia Graeca et Latina Gothoburgensia'' (Goteburg, 1963).&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''A History of Western Astrology'', Jim Tester explains that they appear in [[Hellenistic astrology]] in the 2nd-century list of fixed stars in the ''Katarchai'' by Maximus (the poet and astrologer, not to be confounded with [[Maximus of Tyre]]), the Arabic lists by Alchandri and [[Haly Abenragel]], and a similar [[Copts|Coptic]] list with Greek names.

Tester believes that though they were known in [[Vedic period|Vedic India]], all lists "seem to betray" transmission through Greek sources. Though pointing out that the Babylonians had well established lunar groupings by the [[6th century BC]], he also notes that the 28-mansion "scheme was derived via Egyptian magic by the linking of the lists of lucky and unlucky days of the lunar month with the hemerologies and with the zodiac."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jim |last=Tester |title=A History of Western Astrology |publisher=Boydell and Brewer |year=1987 |page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chinese mansions==
{{main|Twenty-Eight Mansions}}
The '''28 Lunar Mansions''' (Chinese: {{lang|zh|{{linktext|二十|八|宿}}}}, ''Èrshí-Bā Xiù'') are the [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese]] and [[East Asian culture|East Asian]] form of the lunar mansions. They can be considered as the equivalent to the Western [[zodiac]], although the 28 Mansions reflect the movement of the Moon through a [[sidereal month]] rather than the Sun in a [[solar year]]. In their final form, they embodied the astral forms of the [[Four Symbols (China)|Four Symbols]]: two real and two legendary animals important in [[Chinese culture|traditional Chinese culture]] such as ''[[fengshui]]''.

==Indian mansions==
{{main|Nakshatra}}
The '''Nakshatras''' or '''Nákṣatras''' (&lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"stars") are the [[Indian astronomy|Indian]] form of the lunar mansions. They usually number 27 but sometimes 28 and their names are related to the most prominent constellations in each sector. They start from a point on the ecliptic precisely opposite the star [[Spica]] (Sanskrit: ''Chitrā'') and develop eastwards. In classical [[Hindu mythology]], the creation of the nakshatras is attributed to [[Daksha]]. They were wives of [[Chandra]], the moon god. The nakshatras of traditional [[bhartiya astronomy]] are based on a list of 28 asterisms found in the ''[[Atharvaveda]]'' (AVŚ 19.7) and also in the ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana]]''. The first astronomical text that lists them is the ''[[Vedanga Jyotisha]]''. The mansions are important parts of [[Indian astrology]].

==Arabic mansions==
In the traditional [[Astrology in medieval Islam|Arabic astrological system]], which was derived from the Indian ''[[nakshatra]]'' system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Matthew O'Neil|first=William|title=Time and the Calendars|year=1976|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=0-7190-0642-2|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; the moon was seen to move through 28 distinct ''manazil'' (singular: ''manzil'' = house) during the normal solar year, each ''manzil'' lasting, therefore, for about 13 days. One or more ''manazil'' were then grouped into a ''nawaa'' (plural ''anwaa'') which were tied to a given weather pattern. In other words, the yearly pattern was divided in the following manner:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hassan|first=Izzat|title=Al Azmana wa al Anwaa|year=2006|publisher=Awqaf and Islamic Affairs Printing Press|location=Morocco|isbn=9954-0-5074-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year was divided into ''anwaa'', each of which was made up of one more ''manazil'', which were associated with a dominant star or constellation. These stars and constellations were sometimes, but not always, connected in some way to constellations in the [[Zodiac]]. Moreover, as the ''anwaa' repeat on a regular, solar cycle, they can be correlated to fixed points on the Gregorian calendar.

The following table is a breakdown of the ''anwaa'' and their position on the Gregorian calendar.

Notes of the table above in accordance to strict traditional Arab Islamic astronomy and theology:

1) the Arabic alphabet resonates the alphabetical value in [[Abjad numerals|numerology of the Abjad system]] known as "''Ilm'' ul-''ʾAdad".''

2) the [[Mu'aqqibat|‘Amal]] (Islamic view of angels - equivalent to rank of the "Watcher" or "Guardian Angel") is the Angel that rules the corresponding Arabic alphabet (rhythm of the alphabet in [[Abjad numerals|numerology of the Abjad system]]), manazilu ʾl-Qamar (lunar mansion) and constellation (i.e. zodiac sign). Generally speaking, the four Archangels in Islam is [[Gabriel|Jibrāʾīl]], [[Michael (archangel)|Mīkāʾīl]], [[Israfil|ʾIsrāfīl]] and Malaku ʾl-Maut ([[Azrael|‘Azrāʾīl]]).

3) the alphabetical orders follows the sequence of the original ''abjadī'' order (أَبْجَدِي), used for [[lettering]], derives from the order of the [[Phoenician alphabet]], and is therefore similar to the order of other Phoenician-derived alphabets, such as the [[Hebrew alphabet]]. In this order, letters are also used as numbers, [[Abjad numerals]], and possess the same alphanumeric code/[[cipher]] as Hebrew [[gematria]] and Greek [[isopsephy]].

4) those angel name with an "asterisk" needs source citation upon Arabic transliteration but the given is the closest pronunciation based upon uttering the consonants.

A few of the numerical values are different in the alternative Abjad order. For four Persian letters these values are used:&lt;sup&gt;[''[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']&lt;/sup&gt;

{{Eschatology}}
[[File:Maitreya Koryuji.JPG|thumb|A statue of the bodhisattva Maitreya, at [[Kōryū-ji]]]]
'''Maitreya''' ([[Sanskrit]]), '''Metteyya''' ([[Pali]]), is regarded as a future [[Buddhahood|Buddha]] of this world in [[Buddhist eschatology]]. In some [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist literature]], such as the ''[[Amitabha Sutra]]'' and the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'', he is referred to as '''Ajita'''.

According to [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] tradition, Maitreya is a [[bodhisattva]] who will appear on Earth in the future, achieve complete [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]], and teach the pure [[dharma]]. According to scriptures, Maitreya will be a successor to the present Buddha, [[Gautama Buddha]] (also known as Śākyamuni Buddha).&lt;ref name=Horner97&gt;[[#refHorner1975|Horner (1975)]], ''The minor anthologies of the Pali canon'', p. 97. Regarding Metteyya, Bv XXVII, 19: "I [Gautama Buddha] at the present time am the Self-Awakened One, and there will be Metteyya...."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BDEA&gt;{{cite web|author=Buddha Dharma Education Association|title=Suttanta Pitaka: Khuddaka Nikāya: 14.Buddhavamsa-History of the Buddhas|work=Guide to Tipiṭaka|publisher=Buddha Dharma Education Association|location=Tullera, NSW, Australia|year=2014|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/budvamsa.htm|accessdate=2014-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prophecy of the arrival of Maitreya refers to a time in the future when the dharma will have been forgotten by most on the [[Jambudvipa|terrestrial world]].

Maitreya has also been adopted for his millenarian role by many non-Buddhist religions in the past, such as the [[White Lotus]], as well as by modern [[new religious movement]]s, such as [[Yiguandao]].

==Sources==
The name ''Maitreya'' is derived from the Sanskrit word ''maitrī'' "loving-kindness", which is in turn derived from the noun ''[[mitra]]'' "friend". The Pali form ''Metteyya'' is mentioned in the ''Cakkavatti-Sīhanāda Sutta'' ([[Digha Nikaya]] 26) of the [[Pāli Canon]], and also in chapter 28 of the [[Buddhavamsa]].&lt;ref name=Horner97/&gt;&lt;ref name=BDEA/&gt; Most of the Buddha's sermons are presented as having been presented in answer to a question, or in some other appropriate context, but this sutta has a beginning and ending in which the Buddha is talking to monks about something totally different. This leads scholar [[Richard Gombrich]] to conclude that either the whole sutta is apocryphal or that it has at least been tampered with.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Gombrich]], ''Theravada Buddhism: A Social History from Ancient Benares to Modern Colombo.'' Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1988, pages 83–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]], in the first centuries CE in northern India, Maitreya was the most popular figure to be represented along with [[Gautama Buddha]] (often called ''Śākyamuni'' "sage of the [[Shakya]]"). In 4th to 6th-century China, "Buddhist artisans used the names [[Gautama Buddha|Shakyamuni]] and Maitreya interchangeably... indicating both that the distinction between the two had not yet been drawn and that their respective iconographies had not yet been firmly set".&lt;ref&gt;Angela Falco Howard et al., ''Chinese Sculpture'', Yale University Press, 2006, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the stone sculpture found in the Qingzhou cache dedicated to Maitreya in 529 CE as recorded in the inscription (currently in the Qingzhou Museum, Shandong). The religious belief of Maitreya apparently developed around the same time as that of [[Amitābha]], as early as the 3rd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | language = zh | url = http://www.tt034.org.tw/Download/pdf/20_03.pdf | title = 中國早期的彌勒信仰 | publisher = TT034 | place = [[Formosa|TW]] | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131230234200/http://www.tt034.org.tw/Download/pdf/20_03.pdf | archivedate = 2013-12-30 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
One mention of the prophecy of Maitreya is in the ''{{IAST|Maitreyavyākaraṇa}}''. It implies that he is a teacher of meditative trance [[sādhanā]] and states that gods, men and other beings:
{{quote|Will lose their doubts, and the torrents of their cravings will be cut off: free from all misery they will manage to cross the ocean of becoming; and, as a result of Maitreya's teachings, they will lead a holy life. No longer will they regard anything as their own, they will have no possession, no gold or silver, no home, no relatives! But they will lead the holy life of oneness under Maitreya's guidance. They will have torn the net of the passions, they will manage to enter into trances, and theirs will be an abundance of joy and happiness, for they will lead a holy life under Maitreya's guidance.&lt;ref&gt;(Trans. in Conze 1959:241&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==General description==
Maitreya is typically pictured seated, with either both feet on the ground or crossed at the ankles, on a throne, waiting for his time. He is dressed in the clothes of either a [[bhikkhu|bhikṣu]] or Indian royalty. As a [[bodhisattva]], he would usually be standing and dressed in jewels. Usually he wears a small [[stupa]] in his headdress that represents the stupa with relics of Gautama Buddha to help him identify it when his turn comes to lay claim to his succession and can be holding a [[dharmachakra]] resting on a [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]]. A [[khata]] is always tied around his waist as a girdle.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]], Maitreya is represented as a northern Indian nobleman, holding a [[kumbha]] in his left hand. Sometimes this is a "wisdom urn" (Tibetan: ''[[Bumpa]]''). He is flanked by his two acolytes, the brothers [[Asanga]] and [[Vasubandhu]].

The ''[[:de:Maitrisimit|Maitreyasamiti]]'' was an extensive Buddhist play in pre-Islamic Central
Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurasianhistory.com/data/upload/mile.doc 古代维吾尔语说唱文学《弥勒会见记》]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gengo.l.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~hkum/pdf/Maitreya_Paris.pdf The Maitreya-samiti and Khotanese] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114113551/http://www.gengo.l.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~hkum/pdf/Maitreya_Paris.pdf |date=2012-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Maitreyavyakarana'' (in Sataka form) in Central Asia and the ''Anagatavamsa'' of [[South India]] also mention him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iahs.fudan.edu.cn/pdf/%B4%D3%B0%D9%CB%CC%CC%E5%A1%B6%C3%D6%C0%D5%CA%DA%BC%C7%BE%AD%A1%B7%C0%B4%BF%B4%D6%D0%D3%A1%BC%B0%D6%DC%B1%DF%B5%C4%CE%C4%BB%AF%BD%BB%C1%F7.pdf 刘震：从百颂体《弥勒授记经》来看中印及周边的文化交流]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://maungpaw.blogspot.com/2006/12/anagatavamsa-desana.html The Teaching of the Elders – Thera-vada: 'Anagatavamsa Desana]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maitreya's {{IAST|Tuṣita}} Heaven==
Maitreya currently resides in the [[Tushita|''{{IAST|Tuṣita}}'' Heaven]] (Pāli: ''Tusita''), said to be reachable through [[meditation]]. Gautama Buddha also lived here before he was born into the world as all bodhisattvas live in the {{IAST|Tuṣita}} Heaven before they descend to the human realm to become Buddhas. Although all bodhisattvas are destined to become Buddhas, the concept of a bodhisattva differs greatly in Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism. In Theravada Buddhism, a bodhisattva is one who is striving for full enlightenment ([[Arahant]]ship in Pali), whereas in Mahayana Buddhism, a bodhisattva is one who has already reached a very advanced state of grace or enlightenment but holds back from entering nirvana so that he may help others.

In Mahayana Buddhism, Buddhas preside over [[pure land]]s, such as [[Amitābha]] over [[Sukhavati]]. Once Maitreya becomes a buddha, he will rule over the Ketumati [[pure land]], an earthly paradise sometimes associated with the city of [[Varanasi]] (also known as Benares) in Uttar Pradesh, India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://enlight.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-BJ013/51013.pdf 《彌勒上生經》與《彌勒下生經》簡介]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Theravada Buddhism, Buddhas are born as unenlightened humans, and are not rulers of any paradise or pure land. Maitreya's arising would be no different from the arising of Gautama Buddha, as he achieved full enlightenment as a human being and died, entering [[parinirvana|parinibbana]].

==Activity of Maitreya in the current age==
{{Main article|Maitreya-nātha}}
In [[Mahayana]] schools, Maitreya is traditionally said to have revealed the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon#Five treatises of Maitreya|Five Treatises of Maitreya]] through [[Asanga]]. These texts are the basis of the [[Yogacara]] tradition and constitute the majority of the third turning within the [[Three Turnings of the Wheel of Dharma]].

==Future coming of Maitreya==

Maitreya will be the fifth and future Buddha of the bhadrakalpa, and his arrival will occur after the [[Buddhist philosophy#Basic teachings|teachings of Gautama Buddha]] are no longer practiced.

The coming of Maitreya will be characterized by a number of physical events. The oceans are predicted to decrease in size, allowing Maitreya to traverse them freely. Maitreya will then reintroduce true dharma to the world.

His arrival will signify the end of the middle time, the time between the fourth Buddha, Gautama Buddha, and the fifth Buddha, Maitreya, which is viewed as a low point of human existence. According to the ''Cakkavatti Sutta: The Wheel-turning Emperor'', [[Digha Nikaya]] 26 of the [[Sutta Pitaka]] of the [[Pāli Canon]], Maitreya Buddha will be born in a time when humans will live to an age of eighty thousand years, in the city of Ketumatī (present Varanasi), whose king will be the Cakkavattī Sankha. Sankha will live in the palace where once dwelt King Mahāpanadā, but later he will give the palace away and will himself become a follower of Maitreya Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;Vipassana.info, [http://www.vipassana.info/me_mu/metteyya.htm Pali Proper Names Dictionary: Metteyya]&lt;/ref&gt;

The scriptures say that Maitreya will attain ''[[bodhi]]'' in seven days (which is the minimum period), by virtue of his many lives of preparation for [[buddhahood]] similar to those reported in the [[Jataka tales]].

At this time a notable teaching he will start giving is that of the ten non-virtuous deeds (killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, divisive speech, abusive speech, idle speech, covetousness, harmful intent and wrong views) and the ten virtuous deeds (the abandonment of: killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, divisive speech, abusive speech, idle speech, covetousness, harmful intent and wrong views).

The [[Arya Maitreya Mandala]], founded by [[Anagarika Govinda]] is based on the idea of the future coming of Maitreya.

Pali sources say that beings in Maitreya's time will be much bigger than during the time of Sakyamuni. In one prophecy his disciples are contemptuous of Mahakasyapa, whose head is no larger than an insect to them. Buddhas robe barely covers two fingers making them wonder how tiny Buddha was. [[Mahākāśyapa]] is said to be small enough in comparison to cremate in the palm of Maitreya's hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Relics of the Buddha|author=John S. Strong|year=2007|page=220|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Relics_of_the_Buddha.html?id=_KLAxmR8PZAC|isbn=0691117640}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nichiren Buddhism and Maitreya as metaphor==

According to the [[Lotus Sutra]] in [[Nichiren Buddhism]], all people possess the potential to reveal an innate Buddha nature during their own lifetimes, a concept which may appear to contradict the concept of Buddha as savior or messiah.

Although Maitreya is a significant figure in the Lotus Sutra, the explanation of Nichiren is that Maitreya is a metaphor of stewardship and aid for the Bodhisattvas of the Earth, as written in the Lotus Sutra:
{{quote|Moreover... all the bodhisattvas, Bodhisattva Maitreya... will guard and protect the votaries of the Lotus Sutra, so one may indeed rest assured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgilibrary.org/view.php?page=1074&amp;m=3&amp;q=all%20the%20bodhisattvas,%20Bodhisattva%20Maitreya|title=SGI Library Online – The Writings of Nichiren Daishonin|publisher=Sgilibrary.org|date=|accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In much of his writing, Nichiren mentions the traditional buddhist views on Maitreya but explains that the propagation of the Eternal Dharma of the Lotus Sutra was entrusted by Shakyamuni to the Bodhisattvas of earth: {{quote|The Buddha did not entrust these five characters to Maitreya, Medicine King, or the others of their group. Instead he summoned forth the bodhisattvas... from the great earth of Tranquil Light and transferred the five characters to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgilibrary.org/view.php?page=437&amp;m=3&amp;q=The%20Buddha%20did%20not%20entrust%20these%20five%20characters|title=SGI Library Online – The Writings of Nichiren Daishonin|publisher=Sgilibrary.org|date=|accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Thus, each individual can embody the character of the Maitreya because he is a metaphor for compassion: {{quote|The name Maitreya means ‘Compassionate One’ and designates the Votaries of the Lotus Sutra.&lt;ref&gt;The Record of Orally Transmitted Teachings p 143.Translated by Burton Watson&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Maitreya claimants==

{{Main article|List of Buddha claimants}}
The following list is just a small selection of those people who claimed or claim to be the incarnation of Maitreya. Many have either used the Maitreya incarnation claim to form a new Buddhist sect or have used the name of Maitreya to form a new religious movement or cult.
* In 613 the monk Xiang Haiming claimed himself Maitreya and adopted an imperial title.&lt;ref name="Notable Maitreyan Rebellions"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060911211331/http://academic.hws.edu/chinese/huang/fysm068/outline13.ppt#10 Notable Maitreyan Rebellions], FYSM068—Collective Violence and Traumatic Memory in Asia. 16 October 2005. Retrieved 29 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 690 [[Wu Zetian]], [[empress regnant]] of the Wu Zhou interregnum (690–705), proclaimed herself an incarnation of the future Buddha Maitreya, and made [[Luoyang]] the "holy capital." In 693 she replaced the compulsory ''[[Dao De Jing]]'' in the curriculum temporarily with her own ''Rules for Officials''.&lt;ref name="Tang Dynasty Empire 618-906"&gt;[http://www.san.beck.org/AB3-China.html#4 Tang Dynasty Empire 618–906], SAN-BECK. Retrieved 29 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Gung Ye]], a [[Koreans|Korean]] warlord and king of the short-lived state of [[Taebong]] during the 10th century, claimed himself as the living incarnation of Maitreya and ordered his subjects to worship him. His claim was widely rejected by most Buddhist monks and later he was dethroned and killed by his own servants.
* [[Lu Zhongyi]], the 17th patriarch of [[Yiguandao]], claimed to be an incarnation of Maitreya.
* [[L. Ron Hubbard]], founder of the belief systems [[Dianetics]] and [[Scientology]], suggested he was "Metteya" (Maitreya) in the 1955 poem ''Hymn of Asia''. Numerous editors and followers of Hubbard claim that in the book's preface, specific physical characteristics said to be outlined—in unnamed [[Sanskrit]] sources—as properties of the coming Maitreya were properties with which Hubbard's appearance supposedly aligned.
* [[Samael Aun Weor]] – stated in ''The Aquarian Message'' that "the Maitreya Buddha Samael is the Kalki Avatar of the New Age." The Kalkian Avatar and Maitreya Buddha, he claimed, are the same "White Rider" of the ''[[Book of Revelation]]''.
* [[Ram Bahadur Bomjon]], openly identifies himself with the "Next Buddha" Maitreya, calls himself Maitriya Guru and his followers claim "He plans to unite the world through a single Maitri religion, Maitri language and Maitri culture."
* [[Adi Da]] was suggested by his devotees to be Maitreya: {{quote|An All-Surpassing God-Man yet to come – a final Avatar, the ultimate Messiah, a consummate Prophet or Enlightened Sage, a Spiritual Deliverer who will appear in the 'late-time', the 'dark' epoch when humanity is lost, apparently cut off from Wisdom, Truth and God.

==Maitreya sects in China==
[[File:Leshan Buddha Statue View.JPG|thumb|right|Seated stone-carved Maitreya, [[Leshan Giant Buddha]] in [[Sichuan]], [[China]]]]

===Pre-Maitreyan Buddhist messianic rebellions===

====Southern and Northern Dynasties====
* 515: The ''Mahayana Rebellion''. In the late summer of that year, the renegade monk Faqing 法慶 married a nun and formed a sect in the [[Northern Wei]] province of Jizhou 冀州 (in the southern part of today’s Hebei province) with the assistance of a local aristocrat named Li Guibo 李歸伯. The sect was named the ''Mahayana'' ("The Great Vehicle", in reference to [[Mahayana]] Buddhism), and Li Guibo was given the titles of ''Tenth-stage Bodhisattva'', ''Commander of the Demon-vanquishing Army'', and ''King who Pacifies the Land of Han by Faqing''.

:Using drugs to send its members into a killing frenzy, and promoting them to Tenth-Stage Bodhisattva as soon as they killed ten enemies, the Mahayana sect seized a prefecture and murdered all the government officials in it. Their slogan was "A new Buddha has entered the world; eradicate the demons of the former age", and they would kill all monks and nuns in the monasteries that they captured, also burning all the sutras and icons. After defeating a government army and growing to a size of over 50,000, the rebel army was finally crushed by another government army of 100,000. Faqing, his wife, and tens of thousands of his followers were beheaded, and Li Guibo was also captured later and publicly executed in the capital city [[Luoyang]].

:The Fozu Tongji (Comprehensive Records of the Buddha), a chronicle of Buddhist history written by the monk Zhipan in 1269, also contains an account of the Mahayana Rebellion, but with significant deviations from the original account, such as dating the rebellion to 528 rather than 515.&lt;ref name="Buddhist Political Ideology in the Mahayana Rebellion and Moonlight Child Incident of 6th century China"&gt;[Yang Shao-yun, "Buddhist Political Ideology in the Mahayana Rebellion and Moonlight Child Incident of 6th century China" (Honors thesis, National University of Singapore, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

* 516: The ''Moonlight Child Rebellion''. Toward the end of that year, another sect was discovered by local authorities in Yanling, [[Jizhou District, Hengshui|Jizhou]]. A man named Fa Quan and his associates were claiming that an eight-year-old child Liu Jinghui was a [[Bodhisattva]] called the ''Moonlight Child'' (yueguang tongzi pusa； 月光童子菩萨), and that he could transform into a [[snake]] or a [[pheasant]]. They were arrested and sentenced to death on suspicion of seditious intent, but Jinghui had his sentence commuted to banishment on account of his youth and ignorance.&lt;ref name="Buddhist Political Ideology in the Mahayana Rebellion and Moonlight Child Incident of 6th century China"/&gt;
* 517: Early in the spring of that year, surviving remnants of the Mahayana rebels regrouped and mounted a sudden attack on the capital of Yingzhou province, which lay just northwest of their original base in Bohai prefecture. They were repelled only after a pitched battle with an army of slaves and attendants led by Yuwen Yan, the son of the provincial governor, and nothing more is known of their fate.&lt;ref name="Buddhist Political Ideology in the Mahayana Rebellion and Moonlight Child Incident of 6th century China"/&gt;

Although a "new Buddha" was mentioned, these rebellions are not considered "Maitreyan" by modern scholars.&lt;ref name="Buddhist Political Ideology in the Mahayana Rebellion and Moonlight Child Incident of 6th century China"/&gt; However, they would be a later influence on the rebel religious leaders that made such claims. Therefore, it is important to mention these rebellions in this context.

===Maitreyan rebellions===
{{main article|Maitreya teachings}}

====Sui Dynasty====
* 610: On the first day of the [[Chinese New Year]], dozens of rebels dressed in white, burning incense and holding flowers proclaimed their leader as Maitreya Buddha and charged into the imperial palace through one of its gates, killing all the guards before they were themselves killed by troops led by an imperial prince. A massive investigation in the capital ([[Chang'an]]) implicated over a thousand families.&lt;ref name="Buddhist Political Ideology in the Mahayana Rebellion and Moonlight Child Incident of 6th century China"/&gt;
* 613: A skilled magician named Song Zixian claimed to be Maitreya in [[Tang County]] (northwest of Yingzhou), and allegedly could transform into the form of a Buddha and make his room emit a glow every night. He hung a mirror in a hall that could display an image of what a devotee would be reincarnated as: a snake, a beast or a human being. Nearly a thousand "from near and far" joined his sect every day, and he plotted to first hold a Buddhist vegetarian banquet, or ''wuzhe fohui'', and then attack the emperor who was then touring Yingzhou. The plot was leaked, and Song was arrested and executed, along with over a thousand families of his followers.&lt;ref name="Buddhist Political Ideology in the Mahayana Rebellion and Moonlight Child Incident of 6th century China"/&gt;
* 613: The monk Xiang Haiming claimed to be Maitreya in Fufeng prefecture (western Shaanxi) and led a rebellion. The elite of the Chang’an area hailed him as ''dasheng'', or holy man, because they had auspicious dreams after following him, and his army swelled to several tens of thousands before he was defeated by government troops.&lt;ref name="Buddhist Political Ideology in the Mahayana Rebellion and Moonlight Child Incident of 6th century China"/&gt;

====Tang Dynasty====
* 710: Wang Huaigu declared, "The [[Shakyamuni]] Buddha has declined; a new Buddha is about to appear. The House of [[Li (李)|Li]] is ending, and the House of [[Liu]] is about to rise".&lt;ref name="Notable Maitreyan Rebellions"/&gt;

====Song Dynasty====
* 1047: Army officer [[Wang Ze]] led a revolt of Buddhists expecting Maitreya; they took over the city of Beizhou in [[Hebei]] before they were crushed.&lt;ref name="Song Dynasty Renaissance 960-1279"&gt;[http://www.san.beck.org/AB3-China.html#5 Song Dynasty Renaissance 960–1279], SAN-BECK. Retrieved 29 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Song Dynasty]] government declared Maitreya Sects to be "heresies and unsanctioned religions". Tens of thousands of Maitreya Sect followers were killed.&lt;ref name="Is Qigong Political? A new look at Falun Gong"&gt;[http://qi-journal.com/Qigong.asp?-Token.FindPage=4&amp;-Token.SearchID=Is%20Qigong%20Political Is Qigong Political? A new look at Falun Gong] QI: The Journal of Traditional Eastern Health &amp; Fitness. Retrieved 29 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Yuan and Ming Dynasty====
* 1351: The [[Red Turban Rebellion]] (aka The First White Lotus Rebellion). [[Han Shantong]] (韓山童), leader of the [[White Lotus]] Society, and Army Commander Liu Futong ({{zh|c=劉福通}}) rebelled against the [[Mongols]] of the [[Yuan dynasty]]. Shantong's anti-Mongol slogan was "The empire is in utter chaos. Maitreya Buddha has incarnated, and the [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] King of Light has appeared in this world."&lt;ref name="Notable Maitreyan Rebellions"/&gt;
* In 1355, Han Shantong's son, Han Lin'er ({{zh|c=韓林兒}}, 1355–1368?), was proclaimed "Emperor of the Great [Latter] Song" (大宋, referring to the defunct [[Song dynasty]]) by Liu Futong. Liu Futong claimed Han Lin'er was a direct descendent of the [[Zhao (surname)|Zhao]] royal family who ruled the Song Dynasty. After Liu Futong's death, Zhu Yuanzhang took up command of the Red Turban Rebellion and later assassinated Han Lin'er to become the [[Hongwu Emperor]] of the [[Ming dynasty]]. (See [[Bozhou#History|History]]) According to Beijing University,
{{quote|The leader of White Lotus sect, Han Shantong called himself ''Ming Wang'' (明王 – "King of Brightness"), while his son, Han Lin'er called himself ''Xiao Ming Wang'' (小明王 – "Small King of Brightness"), both names reflecting the sect's beliefs. Zhu Yuanzhang had been a member of the White lotus Sect, and admitted to have been a branch of the White Lotus rebel army (being at one time vice-marshal of Xiao Ming Wang). When Zhu Yuanzhang took power, he chose the dynastic name "Ming".&lt;ref name="Beijing University"&gt;"白莲教的首领韩山童称"明王"（他的儿子韩林儿称"小明王"），都体现其教义宗旨。朱元璋不仅曾经信仰白莲教，而且承认自己是白莲教起义军的一支（他曾为小明王左副元帅）。朱元璋取得政权后，国号称"明"。[http://www.hist.pku.edu.cn/club/printpage.asp?BoardID=2&amp;ID=1804 Beijing University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924030246/http://www.hist.pku.edu.cn/club/printpage.asp?BoardID=2&amp;ID=1804 |date=2015-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This suggests that the Ming dynasty was named after the White Lotus figures of the "Big and Little Bright Kings".

====Qing Dynasty====
* 1796: The [[White Lotus Rebellion]] (aka The Second White Lotus Rebellion). It broke out among impoverished settlers in the mountainous region that separates [[Sichuan]] province from [[Hubei]] and [[Shaanxi]] provinces. It apparently began as a [[White Lotus|White Lotus Society]] protest against heavy taxes imposed by [[Manchu]] rulers of the Qing Dynasty.&lt;ref name="White Lotus Rebellion"&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/wh/WhiteLot.html White Lotus Rebellion], The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. May 2001. Retrieved 29 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

:The Yi He Tuan (義和團), often called in English the "[[Fists of Righteous Harmony|Society of Harmonious Fists]]" was a 19th-century [[Triad society|martial-sect]] inspired in part by the White Lotus Society. Members of the "Harmonious Fists" became known as "Boxers" in the west because they practiced [[Chinese martial arts]].

* 1899: The [[Boxer Rebellion]] (義和團之亂). [[Military history of China (pre-1911)|Chinese]] [[rebellion]] from November 1899 to September 7, 1901 against foreign influence in such areas as [[trade]], [[politics]], religion and technology that occurred in [[China]] during the final years of the [[Qing Dynasty]]. By August 1900, over 230 foreigners, tens of thousands of [[Christianity in China|Chinese Christian]]s, an unknown number of rebels, their sympathizers and other innocent bystanders had been killed in the chaos. The uprising crumbled on August 14, 1900 when 20,000 foreign troops entered the Chinese capital, Peking ([[Beijing]]).

Albeit not in the name of Maitreya, both rebellions were perpetrated solely or in part by the [[White Lotus|White Lotus Society]], a rebellious Maitreya sect.

==Speculation==
Some have speculated that inspiration for Maitreya may have come from [[Mithra]], the ancient [[Proto-Indo-Iranian religion|Indo-Iranian]] deity.  The primary comparison between the two characters appears to be the similarity of their names, while a secondary comparison is that both were expected to come in the future.&lt;ref name=Tiele1912&gt;{{cite book | last =Tiele|first=CP|authorlink=Cornelis Tiele|title=The religion of the Iranian peoples | volume = I. (from the German) with Darmesteter's sketch of "Persia" and Goldziher's "Influence of Parsism on Islam | edition =1st|chapter=Appendix: some Buddhistic parallels|quote = No one who has studied the Zoroastrian doctrine of the [[Saoshyant]]s or the coming saviour-prophets can fail to see their resemblance to the future Maitreya.|page =159|publisher=The Parsi Publishing Co | location =Bombay|year=1912|url= https://archive.org/stream/religionofirania00tielrich#page/159/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Williams (British professor)|Paul Williams]] claims that some [[Zoroastrian]] ideas like [[Saoshyant]] influenced the beliefs about Maitreya, such as "expectations of a heavenly helper, the need to opt for positive righteousness, the future millennium, and universal salvation". Possible objections are that these characteristics are not unique to Zoroastrianism, nor are they necessarily characteristic of the belief in Maitreya.

It is also possible that Maitreya Buddha originated with the Hindu [[Kalki]], and that its similarities with the Iranian [[Mithra]] have to do with their common [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] origin.

==Non-Buddhist views==

===Theosophy===
In [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophy]], the [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|theosophical Maitreya]] has multiple aspects signifying not just the future Buddha, but similar concepts from other religious or spiritual traditions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Webster Leadbeater|Leadbeater, Charles W.]] (2007) [originally published 1925. [[Adyar (Chennai)|Adyar]], India: Theosophical Publishing House]. ''The Masters and the Path'' (reprint ed.). New York: Cosimo Classics. {{ISBN|978-1-60206-333-4}}. The theosophical Maitreya features prominently in the entire work. Some instances pertinent here: pp. 4–5, 10, 31–32, 34, 36, 74; "Part IV: The Hierarchy" pp. 211–301. As it did with practically every major religious, philosophical, and cultural tradition, theosophy ascribed additional [[occult]] or [[esoteric]] significance to many Buddhist concepts. In the theosophical [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] the Maitreya is currently high in the ranks of the so-called "[[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]]" where he also holds the "Office of the [[World Teacher]]". According to theosophical writers he has had a number of manifestations or [[incarnation]]s in the physical plane, and he has been further identified with [[Christ]]; [[Annie Besant|Besant, Annie]] &amp; [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|Leadbeater, Charles W.]] (1913). ''Man: How, Whence, and Whither; a record of clairvoyant investigation''. [[Adyar (Chennai)|Adyar]], India: Theosophical Publishing House. pp. 339, 520. {{OCLC|871602}}. Presumed prior Maitreya incarnations.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 20th century, leading theosophists became convinced that an appearance of the Maitreya as a so-called "[[World Teacher]]" was imminent. A [[South Indian]] boy, [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], was thought to be destined as the "vehicle" of the soon-to-manifest Maitreya; however the manifestation did not happen as predicted, and did not fulfil theosophists' expectations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Lutyens|Lutyens, Mary]] (1975). ''[[Krishnamurti: The Years of Awakening]]''. New York: [[Farrar Straus and Giroux]]. {{ISBN|0-374-18222-1}}. Biography (partial) of Jiddu Krishnamurti, the presumed "vehicle" of the Maitreya in the 20th century, describes the events in some detail.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-theosophical movements===
Since the growth of the theosophical movement in the 19th century, and influenced by theosophy's articulations on the Maitreya, non-Buddhist religious and spiritual movements have adopted and reinterpreted the concept in their doctrines. [[Share International]], which equates [[Maitreya (Benjamin Creme)|Maitreya]] with the prophesied figures of multiple religious traditions, claims that he is already present in the world, but is preparing to make an open declaration of his presence in the near future. They claim that he is here to inspire mankind to create a new era based on sharing and justice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shareintl.org/  Share International].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of the 1930s, the [[Ascended Master Teachings]] placed Maitreya in the "Office of World Teacher" until 1956, when he was described as moving on to the "Office of Planetary Buddha" and "Cosmic Christ" in their concept of a Spiritual Hierarchy.

In 1911, Rudolf Steiner claimed "Roughly three thousand years after our time the world will experience the Maitreya Buddha incarnation, which will be the last incarnation of Jeshu ben Pandira. This Bodhisattva, who will come as Maitreya Buddha, will also come in a physical body in our century in his reincarnation in the flesh — but not as Buddha — and he will make it his task to give humanity all the true concepts about the Christ Event." Steiner is careful to distinguish Jeshu ben Pandira as somebody entirely distinct from Jesus of Nazareth, as the Maitreya is entirely distinct from the Christ being. The Maitreya does work in support of the Christ being, as does Guatama, the current Buddha. &lt;ref&gt;[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GA130/English/RSP1984/19110917p01.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ahmadiyya===
The [[Ahmadiyya]]s believe the 19th-century [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] fulfilled expectations regarding the Maitreya Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Review of Religions | date = March 2002 | volume = 97 | number = 3 | page = 24}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bahá'í Faith===
[[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] believe that [[Bahá'u'lláh]] is the fulfillment of the prophecy of appearance of Maitreya.&lt;ref name = "momenbook"&gt;{{cite book|title=Buddhism And The Baha'i Faith: An Introduction to the Baha'i Faith for Theravada Buddhists|first = Moojan |last=Momen|year=1995|isbn=0-85398-384-4|publisher= George Ronald |location=Oxford|pages=50–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "buck_eschatologic"&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in Modern Religions, Religious Movements and the Bābī-Bahā'ī Faiths|editor-last =Sharon | editor-first = Moshe|chapter=The eschatology of Globalization: The multiple-messiahship of Bahā'u'llāh revisited|first= Christopher | last = Buck|isbn=90-04-13904-4|pages=143–178|location=Boston | publisher = Brill|year=2004|url= http://bahai-library.com/buck_eschatology_globalization}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'ís believe that the prophecy that Maitreya will usher in a new society of tolerance and love has been fulfilled by Bahá'u'lláh's teachings on world peace.&lt;ref name ="momenbook" /&gt;

{{Maya religion}}

The Classic Maya used '''dedication rituals''' to sanctify their living spaces and family members by associating their physical world with supernatural concepts through religious practice. The existence of such rituals is inferred from the frequent occurrence of so-called 'dedication' or 'votive' cache deposits in an archaeological context.

== Caches ==

[[Hoard|Cache]]s can be found in the Maya common places and public buildings, which contained objects made or found by commoners.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Marcus, Joyce (1978) “Archaeology and Religion: A Comparison of the Zapotec and Maya.” World Archaeology 10(2): 172-191.&lt;/ref&gt;  More specifically, these caches were usually found in fields or family altars, and contained less valuable materials such as ceramic vessels, copal, food, and drink.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  These dedication cache materials relate more closely to household tasks, such as preparing food or working a field.  The content and placement of these caches suggests a request for aid in acquiring daily necessities, such as food, as they dedicated their work places and homes to deities in exchange for a better harvest or other living needs.  These contents also relate closely to the common mesoamerican idea that the people have an obligation to nourish the life-providing Earth as it does them.

The location of a cache in relation to others can also play a significant role in dedication rituals.  At the Classic Maya site in Tonina, three caches covered by a circular stone mark the north, south, and center of a [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourt]] alley.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Fox, John Gerard (1996) Playing with Power: Ballcourts and Political Ritual in Southern Mesoamerica. Current Anthropology 37(3): 483-509.&lt;/ref&gt;  The north and south caches contained eight [[obsidian]] blades, likely used in [[Bloodletting in Mesoamerica|bloodletting]], whereas the center cache contained nine.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  The number nine represents death and the underworld, dedicating the [[Mesoamerican ballgame|ballcourt]] to those concepts and deity, as well as emphasizing the directions of the Earth.  Including this example, caches mark the center of nine ballcourts across [[Belize]], [[Chiapas]], and [[Central Mexico]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Ballcourts were commissioned by the elite, and hosted ritual activities for the elite and commoners, associating them with power and wealth.  These caches then dedicated the ballcourts, including their power and rituals, to Classic Maya deities.

Dedication rituals through burial were most common in the Maya highlands, in which they were used to commemorate dead ancestors, make an [[Sacrifice|offering]] to their deities, and give life or nourishment to the community or structure the ritual serves.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In Maya cultures, elites were buried as cremations in urns.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Dedicated to their power, large ritual structures such as temples were built above these burials.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  The [[Tikal|Maya Tikal Triple Ballcourt]] held two young female burials placed facing each other inside benches located under a central structure.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Dedicatory burials are unique in that they utilize ancestors to worship ancestors, as well as provide an offering that had also once provided offerings to their deities, signifying both power and life-giving.

== Sacrifice ==

Bodily [[Sacrifice in Maya culture|sacrifice]] was commonplace in dedication rituals, whether in bloodletting or sacrificing a war victim, one of the many sacrificial rituals employed in [[Mesoamerica]] and perhaps during war the chief's daughter just for good luck .  Sacrifice specifically represents a returning of life to the Earth and deities, who were seen as life-providers for the Mesoamerican people. The importance of sacrifice in Classic Maya culture can be seen in [[Structure O-13]] at [[Piedras Negras (Maya site)|Piedras Negras]] where vessels of obsidian blades, stingray spines, and other bloodletting utensils lined the pathway along the structure.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Joyce, Rosemary (1992) Ideology in Action: The Rhetoric of Classic Maya ritual in practice.  Ancient Images, Ancient Thought: The Archaeology of Ideology, Papers from the 23rd Chac Mool Conference, ed. A. Sean Goldsmith, S. Garvie, D. Selin and J. Smith, pp. 497-506.&lt;/ref&gt;  These materials increased in count along the pathway, leading to a main room in which sacrifice rituals took place.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  These materials and their context clearly dedicate Structure O-13 to deity worship through sacrificial offerings.

== Writing ==

Sacred [[Maya script|writings]] were also used as dedicatory devices in ritual structures.  The art of writing was controlled by the elite in Mesoamerica, and the skill passed down linearly.  An example of this can be seen in Classic Maya [[Chichen Itza]], in which elite women created architectural texts dedicating structures to their female ancestors and patron deities.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;McAnany, Patricia (2008) Shaping social difference: Political and ritual economy of Classic Maya royal courts. In Dimensions of Ritual Economy pp. 219-247. Research in Economic Anthropology. vol. 27. Emerald Group Publishing Limited.&lt;/ref&gt;  These gender-specific deities were given significant attention through the dedication of structures in their possession.  [[El Caracol, Chichen Itza|Structure 23]] in [[Yaxchilan]] embodies this concept with sacred writings, often including an initial [[glyph]], verb, noun, prepositional phrase, and most importantly, the name of a possessor of the structure.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  This is so significant in dedication ritual because writing the name of a possessor to which the structure is dedicated gives permanence to that ownership.  The quality of permanence held in writing dedication rituals gives power and importance to the relationship it creates.

== Termination ritual ==

As the complement and counterpart of dedication ritual, termination ritual serves to destroy the link between a structure and the deity to which it was dedicated.  In Temple XIV of [[Cerros]], [[Belize]], [[jade]] artifacts were found scattered and smashed on the floor of the temple, which had presumably once served in dedication caches for the same temple.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Destroying these creations ceases their representation of the cosmos and religious ideas and ends the relationship between those ideas and the structure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23417">{{POV|date=May 2014}}'''Paul Twitchell''' (born '''Jacob Paul Twitchell''') (died September 17, 1971) was an American spiritual lecturer and writer, pulp fiction author, and founder of the religion known as [[Eckankar]]. He was accepted by the Eckankar members as the ''Mahanta'',&lt;ref&gt;See [[Mahanta (disambiguation)]].&lt;/ref&gt; the Living ECK Master from October 22, 1965 until his death. He created and directed the development of Eckankar as a new spiritual teaching.  He stated in his writings that his spiritual name is '''Peddar Zaskq'''.

==Birth and early life==
Paul Twitchell obscured many details of his life. His year of birth is disputed, with 1908, 1910, 1912, 1920 and 1922 being suggested.&lt;ref name="bacon" /&gt;{{efn|He is listed as being six months old in the 15 April 1910 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Paul Twitchell in household of J N Twitchell, Paducah Ward 2, McCracken, Kentucky, United States |website=FamilySearch |url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M26C-2SD |access-date=18 August 2017}}, citing enumeration district (ED) ED 126, sheet 5A, family 105, NARA microfilm publication T624 (Washington D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, 1982), roll 493; FHL microfilm 1,374,506.&lt;/ref&gt;}} It is given as 1908 in the [[Library of Congress]] [[Name Authority File]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=23 February 2007 |title=Twitchell, Paul, 1908-1971 |work=Library of Congress Name Authority File |url=http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n79109799.html |access-date=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in [[Paducah, Kentucky]] to Effie Dorothy and Jacob Noah Twitchell.&lt;ref&gt;Marman, Doug. ''The Whole Truth - The Spiritual Legacy of Paul Twitchell.'' Spiritual Dialogues Project, 2007, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Twitchell attended high school in Paducah. He then attended [[Murray State University|Murray State College]], a teacher's college, for two years, before going to [[Western Kentucky University|Western Kentucky State Teachers College]] until 1934. He failed to graduate from either of those colleges.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Ford.  ''Confessions of a God Seeker:  A Journey to Higher Consciousness.'' "One" Publishing, 2003, pp. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Twitchell's first full-time paid job was as a painter, which he began in late 1936 via his father Jacob who worked as an Office Administrator at Marine Ways.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} His first marriage was to Camille Ballowe, from Paducah, in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] on August 12, 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 100.&lt;/ref&gt; He served in the United States Naval Reserve during World War II, from February 1942 until August 1945 when as Lieutenant Jg. he was honorably discharged. Twitchell became a correspondent for ''Our Navy'' magazine after the war for a short time. He later went on to become a freelance journalist.&lt;ref name="CAO"&gt;"John Paul Twitchell", ''Religious Leaders of America'', 2nd ed., Gale Group, 1999. Reproduced in ''Biography Resource Center'', Farmington Hills, Michigan: Gale, 2009. http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/BioRC.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spiritual seeker==

Twitchell investigated a number of diverse spiritual movements and became an avid reader of spiritual, philosophical, religious and occult books at the Library. In 1950, he joined Premananda Giri's Self-Realization Church of Absolute Monism, an offshoot of [[Paramahamsa Yogananda]]'s [[Self-Realization Fellowship]]. He lived on the grounds of the church, and edited its periodical, ''The Mystic Cross''. He was asked to leave the church in July 1955, due to personal misconduct. A few months later he formally separated from his wife, who stayed on at the fellowship for a time. Their divorce was finalized in 1960.&lt;ref name="Lane_Book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lane|first1=David Christopher|authorlink1=David C. Lane|title=The making of a spiritual movement : the untold story of Paul Twitchell and Eckankar|date=1993|publisher=Garland Publishing|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8153-1276-5|page=34|edition=6th|language=English|format=Hardcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twitchell was initiated by [[Kirpal Singh]] into Ruhani Satsang, a form of [[Surat Shabd Yoga]] or [[Sant Mat]], in October 1955 in Washington DC. He immediately became a devoted student of Singh, acknowledged experiences during Initiation and later on wrote to his master of his appearing in Twitchell's apartment and dictating discourses to him which he would type up and mail to Singh in [[New Delhi]], India. By 1966 reports to Singh that Twitchell was teaching a program very similar to Ruhani Satsang caused a serious disagreement between them which was never repaired. Weeks before Twitchell died he sent a letter to Singh denying he ever saw him as a 'master', denied that he ever received any initiation from Singh because Singh had no power to give initiation, and claiming that Twitchell's spiritual achievements were gained years before they met. Twitchell also suggested that he never spiritually benefited from his connection with Singh.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

However, in December 1963 Twitchell reportedly asked Singh to allow him to dedicate a book, ''The Tiger's Fang'', in Singh's name. Twitchell wanted Singh's help to get it published and sent the manuscript for Singh's approval. Twitchell never received a positive response from Singh and following their disagreement in 1966 he asked for its return. He published it himself in 1967.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Twitchell's first known connection with [[L. Ron Hubbard]] (also a US Naval Reserve Officer during WW2 and pulp fiction author) was around 1950 during the Dianetics period. He again became involved in the [[Church of Scientology]] from about 1956 to 1959, becoming a member of the Church's staff and one of the first Scientologists to achieve the status of [[clear (Scientology)|clear]] it was claimed.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Twitchell taught classes, audited others, wrote articles for the magazines, and other activities for Scientology. He made many long term friendships during this time with the exception of Hubbard himself who later, circa 1968, listed Twitchell and Eckankar on their Suppressive Persons/Groups list.&lt;ref name="bacon"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bacon |first=Nicole |title=Eckankar: The Religion of Light and Sound |editor=Hadden, Jeffrey K. |publisher=University of Virginia Library, The Religious Movements Page |date=2001-08-30 |url=http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/nrms/ecka.html |accessdate=10 July 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831162539/http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/nrms/ecka.html |archivedate=31 August 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CAO"/&gt;

Moving to Seattle WA in late 1960 after the death of his sister Kaydee (Katharine) in 1959, he met Gail Ann Atkinson in 1962. She was working part-time at the Library, where they met, while doing an under-graduate degree. Twitchell later introduced her to the Ruhani Satsang teachings, as well as others, and Gail was also formally initiated by Singh in early December 1963 in San Francisco, during his second tour of the USA. At the same time Twitchell relocated to San Francisco permanently. They married soon after on January 16, 1964, when Twitchell began more seriously writing and compiling materials about his new teaching, Eckankar. The first draft manuscript for ''The Far Country'' was written during this year. Twitchell also began having articles about Eckankar published in various newspapers and magazines.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In late 1964, they moved south to [[San Diego]], where Twitchell gave his first lectures on Eckankar and what was then termed the "bilocation" technique, which he would later call Soul Travel. Gail quit her studies to work full-time so that Twitchell could dedicate himself to establishing Eckankar as a new business venture. In spring 1965, he began a long-term series of regular lectures and workshops on Eckankar at the California Parapsychology Foundation in San Diego and also started selling monthly "Discourses" to interested students.&lt;ref&gt;Marman, pp 159.&lt;/ref&gt; By late 1965 the Twitchells had together founded the Eckankar Corporation as well as Illuminated Way Press, registering both as companies in California.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Role in Eckankar==

Some people believe it was Twitchell's second wife who suggested that he adapt some of his spiritual education into a new religion. Twitchell said her encouragement was a spark for him to do something more with his writings. Critics state that at first Twitchell claimed his teachings were new but that he eventually referred to them as an ancient science that pre-dated all other major religious belief systems.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 93-94.&lt;/ref&gt; Others say this interpretation is based on comments Twitchell made before he officially started Eckankar, when he was promoting what he called his Cliff-Hanger philosophy, which was an outsider's view on modern society. Those were indeed his own views and ideas. However, once he launched Eckankar in October 1965, he always referred to it as being an ancient teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Marman, pp 164.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Eckankar: The Key to Secret Worlds'', Twitchell lays out wide-ranging examples of the teaching down through history, while also explaining his own personal experiences with his teacher, ECK master Rebazar Tarzs. The actual existence of "Rebazar Tarzs," like that of other Theosophical and ECK masters, remains disputed, since he is not an historical figure, is not physically accessible, and has made no public appearance.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

After founding Eckankar, Twitchell wrote and published a series of books and personal study discourses, as well as giving talks around the world, writing thousands of letters to students, and continuing to write articles for magazines. He wrote a series of articles shortly after starting Eckankar that some critics have raised concerns about. In a series that Twitchell referred to as ''The Man Who Talks To God'', he poked fun at gurus, including himself. He says that he wrote the series in exchange for getting a booklet printed on Eckankar, during a time when he couldn't afford it himself.&lt;ref&gt;Marman, pp 314.&lt;/ref&gt; In that column he gave out spiritual advice, claiming to communicate with God about the problems of those who wrote to him. He included [[prophecy]], predicting that the Vietnam War would end in 1968 and that Lyndon Johnson would be elected President of the United States for a second time. Many of his answers were concluded with the words "I HAVE SPOKEN!"&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 180-181.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Twitchell died of a heart attack on September 17, 1971 in [[Cincinnati]] while attending an Eckankar seminar.&lt;ref&gt;Marman, pp 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having formulated the Eckankar doctrine of named succession, he had not in fact designated anyone as his successor and his sudden death created difficulties for the movement's leadership group. It fell upon his widow to make the final decision, and she selected [[Darwin Gross]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}, who was himself succeeded later by [[Harold Klemp]].

==As a writer and master compiler==
In 1984, [[Harold Klemp]], the spiritual leader of Eckankar—which keeps an archive of Twitchell's writings—commented on Twitchell as a writer: "He was an avid letter-writer, and he always kept a carbon copy... At one time Paul made his living by writing for pulp magazines. He also wrote public-relations copy for the Navy... He sincerely cared about spiritual unfoldment and growth. He went through volumes of books on consciousness, a subject which was not in vogue in those days... he thrived on the study of different philosophies." &lt;ref&gt;Klemp, Harold. ''The Secret Teachings: Mahanta Transcripts, Book 3.'' Eckankar, 1989, pp. 139-40. LCCN 89-84193&lt;/ref&gt;

Klemp also describes Twitchell as a master compiler: "The high teachings of ECK had been scattered to the four corners of the world. The different masters each had parts and pieces of it, but they attached little requirements... You must be a vegetarian, or you have to meditate so many hours a day... Paul gathered up the whole teaching and tool the best. Though it may be strange to say, in this sense I see him as a master compiler. He gathered the golden teachings that were scatted around the world and made them readily available to us." &lt;ref&gt;Klemp, Harold. ''The Secret Teachings: Mahanta Transcripts, Book 3.'' Eckankar, 1989, pp. 159-60. LCCN 89-84193&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Paulji, A Memoir'', Patti Simpson reveals how Twitchell put her in charge of a monthly communication to students called the ''Mystic World''. It often contained many mistakes: stories that were supposed to continue on a certain page but didn't, stories stopping in mid-sentence, or the wrong names under pictures. Twitchell told her, "You have no idea... how much help it will be to me if you can learn how to take care of this publication for me. I have so many books to get out, and I need to spend time on them." &lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Patti. ''Paulji, A Memoir.'' Eckankar, 1985, pp. 60-61. LCCN 85-81716.&lt;/ref&gt;

Twitchell told biographer [[Brad Steiger]] that he expected ''The Tiger's Fang'' to be controversial, having announced that it "would shake the foundation of the teachings of orthodox religions, philosophies, and metaphysical concepts."&lt;ref&gt;Steiger, Brad. ''In My Soul I Am Free.'' Eckankar, 1968, p. 60, {{ISBN|0-914766-11-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of plagiarism and lying==

In a 2006 article published in the 5 volume ''Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America'', [[David C. Lane]], a former follower of Sant Mat, stated that some of Twitchell's Eckankar books contained passages from other authors' books without proper citation. In particular, Lane claims Twitchell's 1966 book ''The Far Country'' plagiarizes over 400 paragraphs from the books ''With a Great Master in India'' and ''The Path of the Masters'' by [[Julian Johnson]]&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Julian. Beās: Radha Soami Satsang Beas, 1934, 1982, 1988, 1994. {{ISBN|81-8256-036-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  without any acknowledgement. Three other books of Twitchell's, including ''The Tiger's Fang'', ''Letters to Gail'', and ''Shariyat-Ki-Sugmad'', contain "almost verbatim" extracts from Johnson's 1939 book ''The Path of the Masters'' according to Lane. Lane notes that Twitchell wrote in at least two publications that he considered a book edited by Johnson—''Sar Bachan''—to be his "Bible".{{sfn|Lane|2006|p=124-125}}&lt;ref&gt;"I have a book in my collection called the Sar Bachan written by Sardar Seva Singh, which is the teachings of the Sound Current, and acts as practically my Bible!" —Paul Twitchell in a letter to Gail Twitchell, July 8, 1963; in Paul Twitchell, ''Letters to Gail'', volume II, Menlo Park: [[ECKANKAR]], 1977, page 149. (Seva Singh was the [[Radha Soami Satsang Beas]] translator of the ''Sar Bachan'' into English.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Harold Klemp has responded to the plagiarism allegations by stating that Twitchell's role was that of "master compiler", saying "He gathered the golden teachings that were scattered around the world and made them readily available to us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Klemp |first=Harold |title=The Writing of Paul Twitchell |date=21 April 1984 |url=http://www.eckankar.org/Masters/Peddar/writings.html |website=eckankar.org |access-date=20 Jul 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2007, a member of Eckankar's clergy and Eckankar apologist since 1983, Doug Marman, published ''The Whole Truth'', a biography of Paul Twitchell that disputes claims Lane made in ''The Making of a Spiritual Movement''.&lt;ref name="Marman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Marman |first=Doug |date=2007 |title=The Whole Truth: The Spiritual Legacy of Paul Twitchell |location=Ridgefield, WA |publisher=Spiritual Dialogues Project |isbn=978-0-9793260-0-4 |url=http://www.spiritualdialogues.com/thewholetruth.html |access-date=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Lane has published commentary on Marman's book, reaffirming his view that Twitchell plagiarized several authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Eckankar |title=Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America |editor-first1=Eugene V. |editor-last1=Gallagher |editor-first2=W.

Lane has also alleged that Twitchell lied about his past and tried to cover up his earlier associations.{{sfn|Lane|2006}}{{sfn|Marman|2000|loc=Chapter 11}} Marman has responded by presenting documentation related to Twitchell's career and personal information.&lt;ref name="Marman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |first=Doug |last=Marman |date=2000 |title=Dialogue in the Age of Criticism |url=http://www.littleknownpubs.com/Dialogue_TOC.htm |access-date=20 July 2017 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''prayer wheel''' is a cylindrical [[wheel]] ({{bo|t=འཁོར་ལོ།|w=khor lo }}) on a [[axle|spindle]] made from [[metal]], [[wood]], stone, [[leather]] or coarse [[cotton]]. Traditionally, the [[mantra]] [[Om Mani Padme Hum]] is written in [[Newari language]] of Nepal, on the outside of the wheel. Also sometimes depicted are [[Dakinis]], Protectors and very often the 8 auspicious symbols [[Ashtamangala]].  At the core of the cylinder is a "Life Tree" often made of wood or metal with certain mantras written on or wrapped around it.  Many thousands (or in the case of larger prayer wheels, millions) of mantras are then wrapped around this life tree.  The Mantra [[Om Mani Padme Hum]] is most commonly used, but other mantras may be used as well.  According to the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] tradition based on the lineage texts regarding prayer wheels, spinning such a wheel will have much the same meritorious effect as [[speech|orally]] [[Recitation|reciting]] the prayers.

==Nomenclature and etymology==
'''Prayer wheel''' or '''Mani wheel''' ({{bo|t=མ་ནི་ཆོས་འཁོར་|w=mani-chos-'khor}}). The Tibetan term is a contraction: "Mani" itself is a contraction of Sanskrit ''[[cintamani]]''; "chos" is Tibetan for ''[[Dharma]]''; and "khor" or "khorlo" means ''[[chakra]]no''.

== Origins ==
The earliest recorded prayer wheels were written of by a Chinese pilgrim around 400 C.E. in [[Ladakh]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} The  concept of the prayer wheel is a physical manifestation of the phrase "turning the wheel of [[Dharma]]," which describes the way in which the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] taught.  Prayer Wheels originated from ‘The School of Shakyamuni sutra, volume 3 – pagoda and temple’ which states that, “those who set up the place for worship, use the knowledge to propagate the dharma to common people, should there be any man or woman who are illiterate and unable to read the sutra, they should then set up the prayer wheel to facilitate those illiterate to chant the sutra, and the effect is the same as reading the sutra”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btrts.org.sg/roof |title=Vairocana Buddha Prayer Wheel |publisher=Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum|date= |accessdate=2013-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Tibetan tradition, the prayer wheel lineage traces back to the famous Indian master, Arya Nagarjuna. Tibetan texts also say that the practice was taught by the Indian Buddhist masters Tilopa and Naropa as well as the Tibetan masters Marpa and Milarepa.&lt;ref&gt;The Wheel of Great Compassion: The Practice of the Prayer Wheel in Tibetan Buddhism (Wisdom Publications, 2000.)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practice ==
[[Image:IMG 0996 Lhasa Barkhor.jpg|thumb|left|250px|An elderly [[Tibet]]an woman with a prayer wheel]]

According to the lineage texts on prayer wheels, prayer wheels are used to accumulate wisdom and merit (good karma) and to purify negativities (bad karma). In Buddhism, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas have created a variety of skillful means (upaya) to help bring practitioners ever closer to realizing enlightenment. The idea of spinning mantras relates to numerous Tantric practices whereby the Tantric practitioner visualizes mantras revolving around the nadis and especially around the meridian chakras such as the heart and crown. Therefore, prayer wheels are a visual aid for developing one's capacity for these types of Tantric visualizations. The spiritual method for those practicing with a prayer wheel is very specific (with slight variations according to different Buddhist sects).  The practitioner most often spins the wheel [[clockwise]], as the direction in which the mantras are written is that of the movement of the sun across the sky. On rare occasions, advanced Tantric practitioners such as Senge Dongma, the Lion-Faced Dakini, spin prayer wheels counterclockwise to manifest a more wrathful protective energy.   As the practitioner turns the wheel, it is best to focus the mind and repeat the Om Mani Padme Hum mantra. Not only does this increase the merit earned by the wheel's use, but it is a mind-stabilization technique that trains the mind while the body is in motion.  Intoning the mani mantra with mindfulness and the "Bodhicitta" motivation dramatically enhances the effects of the prayer wheel.  However, it is said that even turning it while distracted has benefits and merits, and it is stated in the lineage text that even insects that cross a prayer wheel's shadow will get some benefit.  Each revolution is as meritorious as reading the inscription aloud as many times as it is written on the scroll, and this means that the more Om Mani Padme Hum mantras that are inside a prayer wheel, the more powerful it is. It is best to turn the wheel with a gentle rhythm and not too fast or frantically. While turning smoothly, one keeps in mind the motivation and spirit of compassion and ''bodhichitta'' (the noble mind that aspires to full enlightenment for the benefit of all beings).
The benefits attributed to the practice of turning the wheel are vast.  Not only does it help wisdom, compassion and bodhichitta arise in the practitioner, it also enhances siddhis (spiritual powers such as clairvoyance, precognition, reading others thoughts, etc.).  The practitioner can repeat the mantra as many times as possible during the turning of the wheel, stabilizing a calm, meditative mind.  At the end of a practice session, there is a Tibetan Buddhist tradition of dedicating any accumulated merits that one may have gathered during practice to the benefit of all sentient beings. Then Om Ah Hum 3 times. This is customary with Tibetans upon completing any Buddhist practice, including the practice of the prayer wheel.

[[Thubten Zopa Rinpoche]] has commented that installing a prayer wheel has the capacity to completely transform a place, which becomes "...peaceful, pleasant, and conducive to the mind."
Simply touching a prayer wheel is said to bring great purification to negative karmas and obscurations.

== Types ==

=== Mani wheel ===
The ''mani wheel'', or hand prayer wheel, has a cylindrical, generally sheet-metal body (often beautifully embossed) mounted on a metal shaft or pin set into a wooden or metal handle that turns on a circular bearing commonly made of ''Turbinella'' (conch) shell.  The cylinder itself is affixed with a cord or chain terminating in a metal weight allowing it to be spun by a slight rotation of the wrist.  The weighted chain, known as a “governor” in Western technology, stabilizes the wheel and keeps it spinning with less input from the practitioner than would otherwise be the case.  The common term, “prayer wheel” is a double misnomer.  A long strip of rolled-up paper bearing printed or inscribed mantras (Tib. ''mani'') rather than prayers, per se, is inside the cylinder.  “Mill,” defined as “a spinning object that generates something,” is a better translation of the Tibetan ''‘khor-lo'' than is “wheel” since it is thought that the spinning cylinder emanates positive energy, allowing the practitioner to accumulate wisdom and merit.  The Tibetan name of this device is mani-chos-'khor (མ་ནི་ཆོས་འཁོར་).

=== Water wheels ===
This type of prayer wheel is simply a prayer wheel that is turned by flowing water.  The water that is touched by the wheel is said to become blessed and carries its purifying power into all life forms in the oceans and lakes that it feeds into.

=== Fire wheel ===
This wheel is turned by the heat of a candle or electric light.  The light emitted from the prayer wheel then purifies the negative karmas of the living beings it touches.

=== Wind wheel ===
This type of wheel is turned by wind.  The wind that touches the prayer wheel helps alleviate the negative karma of those it touches.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

=== Stationary prayer wheels ===
Many monasteries around Tibet have large, fixed, metal wheels set side by side in a row.  Passersby can turn the entire row of wheels simply by sliding their hands over each one.
&lt;!-- deleted file removed [[Image:{samurai prayer wheel.jpg|Samurai]] --&gt;

=== Electric dharma wheels ===
Some prayer wheels are powered by electric motors. "Thardo Khorlo," as these electric wheels are sometimes known, contain one thousand copies of the mantra of Chenrezig and many copies of other mantras. The Thardo Khorlo can be accompanied by lights and music if one so chooses

Electricity can certainly be considered similar to the above sources of energy for PW (water, fire, wind).  The merit generated by the PW is due to the power of the Dharma Texts and Mantras; not necessarily the "power" which rotates them.  These PW turn all day, all night, all thru the year.  The Lamas and practitioners who build, maintain and pay for the electricity rightly help to generate and dedicate the merit.

In another point of view, Lama Zopa Rinpoche has said, "The merit of turning an electric prayer wheel goes to the electric company. This is why I prefer practitioners to use their own 'right energy' to turn a prayer wheel".{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

'''Raphael’s Ephemeris''' is a set of tables used by astrologers which lists the zodiacal positions of astronomical bodies – the Sun, Moon and planets. More recently, the ephemeris includes some [[asteroids]] and the ‘centaur’ planet known as [[2060 Chiron]]. ''Raphael’s Ephemeris'', the oldest of its kind, is published annually in a portable booklet and in large multi-year volumes.

== Ephemerides in general ==

The [[ephemeris]] is a table of the calculated positions of astronomical objects and various other data, usually for a specific time of the day, either noon or midnight. A uniform time measurement is needed to establish accuracy, and ephemerides will use variously [[Greenwich Mean Time]], [[Universal Time]]  or [[Ephemeris Time]]. Historically, the ephemeris was used for [[astrology]] and dates back to ancient Babylon. However, ephemerides became highly useful to navigators and astronomers, and were officially recognised by governments from about the [[early modern period]]. The first national astronomical ephemeris, ''Connaissance de Temps'', was published in France in 1679.  In 1767 came the ''Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris'', which is issued annually by the British Royal Observatory at Greenwich.&lt;ref&gt;The Columbia Electronic Encyclopaedia, (Sixth Edition), Columbia University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
There are different types of ephemerides, and a distinction needs to be made between those used for [[astronomy]] and those for astrology. In the former case, values based on [[right ascension]] and [[declination]] are obtained. Right ascension is [[longitude]], measured eastwards, on the [[celestial equator]] – the earth’s equator projected into space to encircle the solar system. Declination is the other co-ordinate, measured north to south, on this hypothetical, great sphere.

The astrological ephemeris was developed for the purposes of setting up a [[birth chart]], or [[horoscope]], and converts positions of planets given in right ascension/declination into ''zodiacal longitude''. This is a planet’s position along the [[ecliptic]] –the plane of the earth’s orbit around the sun, or the sun’s apparent path around a fixed, stationary earth. An astrological birth chart is [[geocentric]], or earth-centred, calculated as if the earth was at a fixed point, with the [[zodiac]] ‘revolving’ around it.

The starting point for this is always the first point of spring (the [[vernal equinox]]) or 0º0' [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]], ending at 29º59' [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]]. This is the [[tropical zodiac]], a ‘belt’ of sky extending about 8–9 degrees either side of the ecliptic. However, it should not be confused with the [[sidereal zodiac]], which is the background of fixed stars, or [[constellations]].

== Publishing history of Raphael’s ==

''Raphael’s Ephemeris'' was first issued as part of an [[almanac]] entitled ''The Prophetic Messenger'' in the early nineteenth century. ‘Raphael’, the name given to one of three archangels in the [[Old Testament]], was in fact one [[Robert Cross Smith]] (1795–1832), a former carpenter who had developed an interest in astrology. Smith first used the pseudonym in 1824 when he edited a periodical called ''The Straggling Astrologer'', later re-published as ''The Astrologer of the Nineteenth Century''. He also referred to himself as the ‘Royal Merlin’.&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Ellic, The Royal Merlin, London: Arborfield, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Straggling Astrologer'' was a relative failure, but by 1827 Smith had assumed editorship of ''The Prophetic Messenger'', which was read widely by astrologers of the day, and contributed to a renaissance of interest in astrology in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Brau, Jean-Louis, Weaver, Helen, and Edwards, Allan, Larousse Encyclopedia of Astrology, New York: New American Library, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Raphael’s Ephemeris'' was issued as a separate publication after Smith’s death, whilst others adopted and continued with the name ‘Raphael’. The second Raphael was John Palmer (1807–1837), a former student of Smith’s, who edited ''Raphael's Sanctuary of the Astral Art'' in 1834; the third was a Mr. Medhurst, the editor of the ''Prophetic Messenger'' between c. 1837–1847. Smith is sometimes confused with ‘Edwin Raphael’, who in fact was the pseudonym for the succeeding Raphael, (number four) a certain Mr. Wakeley (d. 1852). Number five was a Mr. Sparkes (1820–1875), editor of the ''Prophetic Messenger'' from 1852 to 1872, who even briefly edited ''Raphael’s Ephemeris''’ main rival at the time, ''Zadkiel’s Almanac''. (‘Zadkiel’ was the pseudonym of [[Richard James Morrison]], an astrologer/inventor whose almanac dates back to 1831.)&lt;ref&gt;Papon, Donald, The Lure of the Heavens - A History of Astrology, Samuel Weiser, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Thomas Cross]] (1850–1923) became the next Raphael, obtaining the copyright to the publication at some time in the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, James R., Astrology Encyclopaedia, Detroit: Gale Research, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Cross Smith was also responsible for popularising the system of [[astrological house]] division known as the Placidean, after the Italian monk [[Placidus de Titus]] (d. 1668). Placidus house tables, for locations in northern latitudes, are still listed in ''Raphael's Ephemeris'', nowadays issued by W. Foulsham, a British publisher founded in 1819. (They first published ''Raphael's'' in 1836.) The latest ephemerides have been calculated using data obtained from the astronomical ephemerides produced by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.

'''Reasons to Believe''' (RTB) is a [[progressive creationism|progressive creationist]] group that promotes [[day-age creationism|day-age]] forms of old Earth creationism. It was founded in 1986 by [[Hugh Ross (creationist)|Hugh Ross]], a Canadian-born [[astrophysicist]] and creationist Christian [[apologist]].{{R|"abouthugh"}}{{R|"reasons.org"}} The scientific community and skeptics dispute many of the claims RTB makes.{{R|"pennock"}}

== About ==

Based in Los Angeles, the mission of RTB is to demonstrate that "sound reason and scientific research—including the very latest discoveries—consistently support, rather than erode, confidence in the truth of the Bible and faith in the personal, transcendent God revealed in both Scripture and nature."

Reasons to Believe has 26 books published by Christian book publisher [[Baker Publishing Group|Baker Publishing]]. They have also written 1564 articles on the topic.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source.|date=May 2018}}  RTB has held events all over the world.{{R|"events"}} They have also produced many DVDs, TV shows, audio CDs, MP3s, podcasts, streaming media events and teleconferences. Their "Science News Flash" reviews news headlines of [[scientific]] discoveries. RTB educational programs include both credit and non credit classes.{{R|"educational"}}

== Views ==

RTB claims to have a [[scientific model]] predicting an increase in astronomical evidence that Earth resides at the ideal location in the cosmos for both harboring advanced civilization and technology and making the universe observable.{{R|"brayton"}} [[Nontheistic]] models predict that [[astronomical]] discoveries will show that Earth is unremarkable for both [[habitability]] and observation.{{R|"universe"}}

The RTB model also predicts that as scientists continue to research the causes and effects of [[plate tectonics]], their findings will reveal evidence for the fine-tuning required for long-lasting, stable plate-tectonic activity on a planet with a thin atmosphere.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source.|date=May 2018}}

The RTB model predicts that future anthropological and genetic research will increasingly confirm that humans are biologically distinct rather than descended from a hominid species. It predicts stronger evidence for humanity's genetic, anatomical, and behavioral uniqueness. It places the earliest hominids at 6.5 million years ago and the first humans at around fifty thousand years ago.{{R|"venema"}}

RTB also predicts that the flood of Noah was a local event. There is some evidence for a large flood in modern day Iraq around 2900 BCE.{{R|"flood"}}

== Criticism ==

[[Scientific models]] help researchers organize information into a conceptual structure to understand and interpret data, ask good questions, and identify anomalies. Famous scientific models include [[Einstein]]’s [[theory of relativity]] and the [[neo-Darwinian]] [[theory of evolution]]. RTB's testable creation model fails to meet the modern qualifications for a [[scientific theory]] or model and just looks at known things and claims them as predictions.{{R|"novella"}}{{R|"carroll"}}{{R|"pennock"}}

In a review of an updated edition of ''Who Was Adam: A Creation Model Approach to the Origin of Humanity'' (2015) by Ross and Fazale Rana, research psychologist Brian Bolton argues against the scientific status of the RTB model. Bolton sees violations of scientific logic in the form of immunity to falsification, the assumption of supernatural causation, a lack of independent evaluations of evidence, circular reasoning, and the false equivalence of biblical creationism (faith-based) and human evolution (evidence-based) as scientific explanations.{{R|"bolton2018"}}

The RTB claim that all current humans are descended from a specially created couple that lived about 50,000 years ago and that there is no common ancestor between humans and other primates is disputed in a scholarly essay by evangelical [[geneticist]] Dennis Venema.{{R|"venema"}} There is strong genetic and fossil evidence suggesting a common ape-man ancestor as well.{{R|"Choi"}}{{R|"hasagawa"}} There is also a reasoned argument against intelligent design in general.{{R|"pigliucci"}}

'''Religion in [[Belarus]]''' has been traditionally [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] although there is also a sizeable [[Catholic]] minority. The legacy of the [[state atheism]] of the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet era]] is evident in the fact that a large part of the Belarusians are not religious. Moreover, other non-traditional and new religions have sprung up in the country after the end of the [[Soviet Union]]. According to the most recent data published in 2011 by the Ministry of the Interior, 48.3% of the Belarusians are [[Orthodox Christians]], 41.1% are [[irreligion|irreligious]] ([[atheists]] and [[agnostics]]), 7.1% are [[Catholics]], and 3.5% are members of other religions.&lt;ref name="mfa"/&gt;

== History ==
By the end of the 12th century, [[Europe]] was generally divided into two large areas: the western area with dominance of Catholicism, and eastern with Orthodox and Byzantine influences. The border between them was roughly marked by the [[Bug River]]. This placed the area now known as Belarus in a unique position where these two influences mixed and interfered.

Before the 14th century, the Orthodox church was dominant in Belarus. The [[Union of Krewo]] in 1385 broke this monopoly and made Catholicism the religion of the ruling class. [[Jogaila]], then ruler of Lithuania, part of which was Belarus, ordered the whole population of Lithuania to convert to Catholicism. 1.5 years after the Union of Krewo, the [[Vilnius|Wilno]] episcopate was created which received a lot of land from the Lithuanian dukes. By the mid-16th century Catholicism became strong in Lithuania and bordering with it north-west parts of Belarus, but the Orthodox church was still dominant in Belarus.

In the 16th century a crisis began in Christianity: the [[Protestant Reformation]] began in Catholicism and a period of [[heresy]] began in an Orthodox area. From the mid-16th century [[Protestant]] ideas began spreading in Lithuania, which included Belarus. The first Protestant Church in Belarus was created in Brest by [[Mikołaj "the Black" Radziwiłł]]. Protestantism did not survive due to the [[Counter-Reformation in Poland]].

=== Religion in post-Soviet Belarus ===
The revival of religion in Belarus in the post-communist era brought about a revival of the old historical conflict between Orthodoxy and Catholicism. This religious complexity was compounded by the two denominations' links to institutions outside the republic. The [[Belarusian Orthodox Church]] was headed by an ethnic Russian, Metropolitan Filaret, who headed an [[exarchate]] of the [[Moscow Patriarchy]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. The Catholic archdiocese of Belarus was headed by an ethnic Pole, [[Kazimierz Świątek|Cardinal Kazimir Sviontak]], who had close ties to the church in Poland. However, despite these ties, Archbishop Sviontak, who had been a prisoner in the Soviet camps and a pastor in Pinsk for many years, prohibited the display of Polish national symbols in Catholic churches in Belarus.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

Fledgling Belarusian religious movements are having difficulties asserting themselves within these two major religious institutions because of the historical practice of preaching in Russian in the Orthodox churches and in Polish in the Catholic churches. Attempts to introduce the Belarusian language into religious life, including the liturgy, also have not met wide success because of the cultural predominance of Russians and Poles in their respective churches, as well as the low usage of the Belarusian language in everyday life.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

To a certain extent, the 1991 declaration of Belarus's independence and the 1990 law making Belarusian an official language of the republic have generated a new attitude toward the Orthodox and Catholic churches. Some religiously uncommitted young people have turned to the [[Uniate Church]] (Greek Catholic) in reaction to the resistance of the Orthodox and Catholic hierarchies to accepting the [[Belarusian language]] as a medium of communication with their flock. Overall, however, national activists have had little success in trying to generate new interest in the Greek Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

The [[Greek Catholic]] Church, a branch of which existed in Belarus from 1596 to 1839 and had some three-quarters of the Belarusian population as members when it was abolished, is reputed to have used Belarusian in its liturgy and pastoral work. When the church was reestablished in Belarus in the early 1990s, its adherents advertised it as a "national" church. The modest growth of the Greek Catholic Church was accompanied by heated public debates of both a theological and a political character. Because the original allegiance of the Greek Catholic Church was clearly to the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], the reestablished church is viewed by some in the Orthodox Church in Belarus with suspicion, as being a vehicle of both Warsaw and the Vatican and an encouragement of distance from Moscow.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

== Statistics ==
Before 1917 [[Belarus]] had 2,466 religious communities, including: 1,650 Orthodox, 127 Catholic, 657 Jewish, 32 [[Protestant]], and several [[Islam|Muslim]] communities. Under the [[communist]]s, the activities of these communities were severely restricted. Many religious communities were destroyed and their leaders exiled or executed; the remaining communities were sometimes co-opted by the government for its own ends, as in the effort to instill patriotism during World War II.&lt;ref name=cs&gt;Jan Zaprudnik and Helen Fedor. "Religion." ''Belarus (Country Study)''. Federal Research Division, Library of Congress; Helen Fedor, ed. June 1995. ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/about.html |title=About this Collection - Country Studies &amp;#124; Digital Collections &amp;#124; Library of Congress |website=Lcweb2.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 one Belarusian publication reported the numbers of religious communities as follows: 787 Orthodox, 305 Catholic, 170 Pentecostal, 141 Baptist, 26 Old Believer, 17 Seventh-Day Adventist, 9 Apostolic Christian, 8 Greek Catholic, 8 New Apostolic, 8 Muslim, 7 Jewish, and 15 other religious groups.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

A 2015 [[Pew Research Center]] survey based on a sample of 1000 people found that 94% of them declared to be Christians, 3% to be irreligious—a category which includes atheists, agnostics and those who described their religion as "nothing in particular", while 3% belonged to other faiths.&lt;ref name="Religious Belief in Central and Eastern Europe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/05/10104119/CEUP-FULL-REPORT.pdf|title=Religious Belief and National Belonging in Central and Eastern Europe|author=ANALYSIS|date=10 May 2017|publisher=Pew Forum|accessdate=12 May 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513130508/http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/05/10104119/CEUP-FULL-REPORT.pdf|archivedate=13 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christians were divided between 73% who declared to be Eastern Orthodox, 12% Catholics, and 9% other Christians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/2017/05/10/religious-belief-and-national-belonging-in-central-and-eastern-europe/ Religious Belief and National Belonging in Central and Eastern Europe: National and religious identities converge in a region once dominated by atheist regimes]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious groups==
[[File:Касьцёл Найсьвяцейшага Сэрца Пана Езуса (Ільля).jpg|thumb|upright|Catholic Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in Iĺja.]]

===Christianity===
====Eastern Orthodoxy====
{{Main article|Eastern Orthodox Church|Belarusian Orthodox Church}}
Although the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] was devastated during [[World War II]]{{source?|date=April 2018}} and continued to decline until the early 1980s because of government policies, it underwent a small revival with the onset of [[perestroika]] and the celebration in 1988 of the 1,000- year anniversary of Christianity in Russia. In 1990 Belarus was designated an exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church, creating the Belarusian Orthodox Church. In the early 1990s, 60 percent of the population identified themselves as Orthodox. The church had one seminary, three convents, and one monastery.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

====Catholic Church====
[[File:St. Kaimir Catholic Church .jpg|thumb|upright|Interior of Saint Kaimir Catholic Church in [[Lahoysk]].]]
{{Main article|Catholic Church in Belarus}}
Soviet policies toward the [[Catholic Church]] were strongly influenced by the Catholics' recognition of an outside authority, the pope, as head of the church, as well as by the close historical ties of the church in Belarus with Poland. In 1989 the five official Catholic dioceses, which had existed since World War II and had been without a bishop, were reorganized into five dioceses (covering 455 parishes) and the archdiocese of Minsk and Mahilyow. In the early 1990s, figures for the Catholic population in Belarus ranged from 8 percent to 20 percent; one estimate identified 25 percent of the Catholics as ethnic Poles. The church had one seminary in [[Belarus]].&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

====Greek Catholicism====
{{Main article|Belarusian Greek Catholic Church}}
At the beginning of 2005, the Belarusian Greek Catholic Church had 20 parishes, of which 13 had obtained state recognition. As of 2003, there have been two Belarusian Greek Catholic parishes in each of the following cities - Minsk, Polatsk and Vitsebsk; and only one in Brest, Hrodna, Mahiliou, Maladziechna and Lida. The faithful permanently attached to these came to about 3,000, while some 4,000 others lived outside the pastoral range of the parishes. Today there are 16 priests, and 9 seminarians. There is a small Studite monastery at Polatsk. The parishes are organized into two deaneries, each headed by an archpriest. The Abbot of the Polatsk monastery serves as the dean of the eastern deanery.  There is no eparch (bishop) for the Belarusian Greek Catholic Church.  Archimandrite Sergius Gajek, MIC, is the Apostolic Visitator for the Greek-Catholic Church in Belarus.  Worship is in the Belarusian language.

====Protestantism====
[[File:Carkva Blahadac.jpg|thumb|upright|Church of the Grace (Царква Благадаць ''Carkva Blahadać''), a Protestant church in Minsk.]]
{{See also|Belarusian Evangelical Reformed Church}}
Before World War II, the number of Protestants in Belarus was quite low in comparison with other Christians, but they have shown growth since then. In 1917, there were 32 Protestant communities. In 1990, there were more than 350 Protestant communities in the country.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

===Judaism===
{{See also|History of the Jews in Belarus}}
The first Jewish communities appeared in Belarus at the end of the 14th century and continued to increase until the genocide of World War II. Mainly urban residents, the country's nearly 1.3 million Jews in 1914 accounted for 50 to 60 percent of the population in cities and towns. The Soviet census of 1989 counted some 142,000 Jews, or 1.1 percent of the population, many of whom have since emigrated. Although boundaries of Belarus changed from 1914 to 1922, a significant portion of the decrease was the result of the war. In late 1992, there were nearly seventy Jewish organizations active in Belarus, half of which were country-wide.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

===Islam===
{{Main article|Islam in Belarus}}
[[File:Мячэць. Забудова Іўя.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[mosque]] in [[Iwye]].]]
Muslims in Belarus are represented by small communities of ethnic [[Tatars]]. All of them are followers of [[Sunni Islam]]. Some of these Tatars are descendants of emigrants and prisoners of war who settled in Belarus, from the [[Volga Region]], after the 11th century.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt; In 1997 there were 23 Muslim communities, including 19 of those in the Western regions of Belarus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World religions as represented in Belarus: Mohammedanism|url=http://belarus.vneshintourist.net/?p=67&amp;more=1&amp;c=1|publisher=Vneshintourist|accessdate=17 February 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312091331/http://belarus.vneshintourist.net/?p=67&amp;more=1&amp;c=1|archivedate=12 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neopaganism===
Paganism in Belarus is mostly represented by [[Rodnovery]], the [[Slavic neopaganism]].&lt;ref name="Lastouski"&gt;Aliaksiej Lastoŭski. ''[http://palityka.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/01_article.pdf Russo-centrism as an ideological project of Belarusian identity]''. In ''Belarusian Political Scene Review'' #1, 2011. '''p. 27''' - quote: «[...] Another peculiar place where the ideas of russo-centrism are created and propagated is a series of international scientific and practical conferences held under the supervision of Uladzimir Sacevič. Sacevič himself leads social activities in several directions. He is the chairman of the "Human Ecology” Committee under the Belarusian Social and Ecological Union, a member of the Coordinating Council of the Union of Struggle for People’s Sobriety, and at the same time acts as the organizer of the Rodnovery (Slavic Neo-Pagan) movement in Belarus. Following the conferences’ results, digests under a characteristic name “The Slavic Veche” are published (in total, four such digests had been published by 2009). Selection of materials in these digests is very eclectic. There, one can find manifestos of Rodnovers/Neopagans [...]». Institute of Political Studies Political Sphere, Vytautas Magnus University.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uladzimir Sacevič]] is a Rodnover leader.&lt;ref name="Lastouski"/&gt;

[[Malaysia]] is a multicultural and [[Confessionalism (politics)|multiconfessional]] country, whose official religion is Islam. As of the 2010 Population and Housing Census, 61.3 percent of the population practices [[Islam]]; 19.8 percent [[Buddhism]]; 9.2 percent [[Christianity]]; 6.3 percent [[Hinduism]]; and 3.4 percent traditional [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese religions]]. The remainder is accounted for by other faiths, including [[Animism]], [[Folk religion]], [[Sikhism]], [[Baha'i Faith]] and other belief systems.&lt;ref name="Census 2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.my/portal/download_Population/files/census2010/Taburan_Penduduk_dan_Ciri-ciri_Asas_Demografi.pdf |title=Taburan Penduduk dan Ciri-ciri Asas Demografi |publisher=Jabatan Perangkaan Malaysia |page=82 |accessdate=25 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113165406/http://www.statistics.gov.my/portal/download_Population/files/census2010/Taburan_Penduduk_dan_Ciri-ciri_Asas_Demografi.pdf |archivedate=13 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.statistics.gov.my/index.php?r=column/cthemeByCat&amp;cat=117&amp;bul_id=MDMxdHZjWTk1SjFzTzNkRXYzcVZjdz09&amp;menu_id=L0pheU43NWJwRWVSZklWdzQ4TlhUUT09|title=Population Distribution and Basic Demographic Characteristic Report 2010 (Updated: 05/08/2011)|publisher=Department of Statistics, Malaysia|accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numbers of self-described atheists in [[Malaysia]] are few; the state has come under criticism from [[human rights]] organisations for the government's [[Atheophobia|discrimination against atheists]], with some cabinet members saying that "the freedom of religion is not the freedom from religion".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/putrajaya-freedom-of-religion-does-not-equal-freedom-from-religion|title=Putrajaya: Freedom of religion does not equal freedom from religion|date=2017-11-23|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reuters131210&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/10/us-religion-atheists-idUSBRE9B900G20131210|title=Atheists face death in 13 countries, global discrimination: study|author=Robert Evans|date=9 December 2013|publisher=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islam in Malaysia]] is represented by the [[Shafi'i]] version of [[Sunni]] theology and the practice of any other form of the religion (such as [[Shia Islam]]) is heavily restricted by the government.&lt;ref name="malaysianbar.org.my"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysianbar.org.my/press_statements/press_statement_malaysia_a_secular_state.html|title=PRESS STATEMENT: Malaysia a secular State|author=[[Ambiga Sreenevasan]]|publisher=The Malaysian Bar|date=18 July 2007|accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wu &amp; Hickling, p. 35"&gt;Wu &amp; Hickling, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal Constitution as the Supreme Law makes Islam as the "religion of the Federation".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agc.gov.my/agcportal/uploads/files/Publications/FC/Federal%20Consti%20(BI%20text).pdf|title=Federal Constitution of Malaysia|last=|first=|date=|website=Attorney General's Chambers|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Malaysian Chinese]] practice various faiths: [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]] and [[Chinese traditional religion]]s (including [[Taoism]]). [[Hinduism]] is practised by the majority of [[Malaysian Indian]]s. [[Christianity]] has established itself in some communities, especially in [[East Malaysia]]. It is not tied to any specific ethnic group.

Relations between different religious groups are generally quite tolerant. [[Islamic holidays|Eids]], [[Christmas]], [[Lunar New Year]], and [[Deepavali]] have been declared national holidays. Various groups have been set up to try to promote religious understanding among the different groups, with religious harmony seen as a priority by Malaysian politicians.

==Religious distribution==

All the [[Malaysian Malay]] people are Muslim by law. Most [[Malaysian Chinese]] follow [[Mahayana Buddhism]] or [[Chinese traditional religion]]s (including [[Taoism]], [[Confucianism]], [[ancestor-worship]] or newer sects).&lt;ref name="Matic"/&gt; Statistics from the 2010 Census indicate that 83.6% of Malaysia's ethnic Chinese identify as Buddhist, with significant numbers of adherents following Taoism (3.4%) and Christianity (11.1%).&lt;ref name="Census 2010"/&gt; Actually, the percentage of practitioners of the Chinese folk religions may be higher, as many practise both Buddhism and folk religions.

Christianity is the predominant religion of the non-Malay [[Bumiputra]] community (46.5%) with an additional 40.4% identifying as Muslims.&lt;ref name="Census 2010"/&gt; Many indigenous tribes of [[East Malaysia]] have converted to Christianity, although Christianity has made fewer inroads into [[Peninsular Malaysia]].&lt;ref name="Matic"/&gt;

==Law and politics==
Malaysia is a multi-religious society, the Malaysian constitution does not guarantee [[freedom of religion]], [[Islam]] is the official religion of the federation, as well as the legally enforced faith of all ethnic Malays. No ethnic Malay is allowed to leave Islam, while non-Malay Muslims seeking to [[apostasy|apostacise]] require permission from a [[sharia]] court, which is never granted.&lt;ref name="StateReligion"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71347.htm |title=Malaysia |publisher=United States Department of State |accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious beliefs follow ethnic lines.&lt;ref name="MSU"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asia.isp.msu.edu/wbwoa/southeast_asia/malaysia/religion.htm |title=Malaysia - Religion |publisher=Michigan State University |accessdate=13 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809081015/http://asia.isp.msu.edu/wbwoa/southeast_asia/malaysia/religion.htm |archivedate=9 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Holidays have been declared for holy days in numerous religions,&lt;ref name="StateReligion"/&gt; although only Islam has more than one national holiday.&lt;ref name="MSU"/&gt; Whether a religion obtains approval of the government is determined by the Registrar of Societies, part of the Ministry of Home Affairs. Only upon approval do they qualify for government benefits. However, unrecognised groups such as the [[Falun Gong]] can practise by registering themselves under the Companies Act, although this means that technical violations of the act can result in a fine.&lt;ref name="StateReligion"/&gt;

The government believes the constitution provides a strong enough guarantee of religious freedom and should not be changed. Some restrictions are made on Malay texts from non Islamic religions in Peninsula Malaysia, however there are much less restrictions in East Malaysia. The Hijab are mandatory for non-Muslims in certain situations.&lt;ref name="StateReligion"/&gt; The [[MyKad]] identity card states whether the holder is a Muslim or not.&lt;ref name="MSU"/&gt;

As Islam is the state religion, the government provides financial support to Islamic establishments and forced the [[Sunni]] form of Islam. State governments imposes a few Islamic law on Muslims, and the government will offer grants to private Muslim schools that allow a government-approved curriculum and supervision. The government also indirectly funds non-Islamic communities, although to a much smaller degree. The government interferes with the religious practices of non-Muslim communities. Public schools offer an Islamic religious instruction course which is compulsory for Muslim students, and non-Muslim students take a morals and ethics course.&lt;ref name="StateReligion"/&gt;

The government prohibits any publications that it feels will incite racial or religious disharmony,&lt;ref name="StateReligion"/&gt; and has asked that religious matters not be discussed in public due to their sensitivity.&lt;ref name="Secret"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/crossing_continents/6150340.stm |title=Life as a secret Christian convert |last=Pressly |first=Linda |publisher=BBC |date=15 November 2006 |accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It claims nobody has been arrested under the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]] for religious reasons. The government may demolish unregistered religious places of worship, and nongovernmental organisations have complained about the demolition of unregistered Hindu temples. These were often constructed on privately owned plantations prior to independence in 1957. After independence plantations became government property. In 2006 the state of [[Negeri Sembilan]] announced the demolition of a Hindu temple, although the temple sought injunction and took it to court.&lt;ref name="StateReligion"/&gt; State governments control mosques, appoint imams, and provide guidance for sermon content.&lt;ref name="StateReligion"/&gt; The conflict between the federal and state governments over religious authority led to a slow pace of reform and development of laws relating to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Both [[Barisan Nasional]] (BN) and the opposition [[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party]] (PAS) party have attempted to deliver political messages using mosques in the states they govern. All civil servants must attend government-approved religion classes. BN has banned opposition-affiliated imams from mosques, enforced restrictions on sermons, replaced opposition sympathetic mosque leaders and governing committees, and closed down unauthorised mosques affiliated with the opposition. The state government of Selangor in August 2005 withheld visas from foreign imams to try to increase the number of local imams. PAS, which controls the state of [[Kelantan]] restricts imams affiliated with BN from their mosques. It is thought that support for a moderate Islam led to the 2004 election victory of BN over PAS in the state of [[Terengganu]].&lt;ref name="StateReligion"/&gt; Both parties became more Islamic in the 1980s and 1990s to try to obtain more of the Malay vote.&lt;ref name="Pressure"/&gt; Political problems are often portrayed as religious issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Secularism===
Despite the recognition of Islam as the state religion in the constitution, when created it was explicitly noted that the status was merely a symbolic one. It was not seen as something to be used as a basis of law, except by some Malay nationalists.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=hg2ZyH7nr9cC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=tl&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Questioning the Secular State: The Worldwide Resurgence of Religion in Politics|first=David|last=Westerlund|date=22 November 1996|publisher=C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently a dispute exists between those who promote a secular interpretation of the federal constitution and those who believe Shariah courts and Islamic law should have supremacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/24/world/asia/24malaysia.html|title=Once Muslim, Now Christian and Caught in the Courts|date=24 August 2006|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement towards a more Islamic society, known as dakwah, is often viewed as an effort to resist western influences.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Secular values are often favoured by the Malay elite, who welcome the shared goals of industrial development. It is however opposed by Muslims who see it as an invasion of western culture and worldview..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=vTMDbZ7qLNgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=tl&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Sacred Tensions: Modernity and Religious Transformation in Malaysia|first1=Raymond L. M.|last1=Lee|first2=Susan Ellen|last2=Ackerman|date=22 November 1997|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for a more Islamic society often comes from the more rural population of Malays.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

As modernisation has increased, it has brought along with it an increase in secularism. In urban areas, the switch to more western dress such as miniskirts and jeans is of concern to religious authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=466&amp;Itemid=34|title=Home - Asia Sentinel|website=Asia Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nightclubs and bars thrive in the cities. However, in the time since independence other areas have become more islamicised. At the time of independence women wore tight-fitting outfits, but now wear headscarves. Muslim prayers are played through the speaker systems of government buildings, and some feel Malaysia is becoming a more Islamic than secular state, with critics complaining that Islam is gaining greater influence in governance. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/28/world/asia/28iht-letter.2619095.html&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of how the Malay identity should be developed has increasingly come under debate. While the ruling government believes that attaining economic power will empower the Malay population, PAS sees that as an erosion of Islamic values. However, PAS is often seen as to not be able to relate Islamic beliefs to modern society, especially in multicultural Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lsinsight.org/articles/2000/religion.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722012914/http://lsinsight.org/articles/2000/religion.htm |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Historically Malaysia was considered secular, with the first prime minister stating "this country is not an Islamic state as it is generally understood.&lt;ref name="thenutgraph.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenutgraph.com/mca-malaysia-is-a-secular-state/|title=MCA: Malaysia is a secular state  -  The Nut Graph|website=www.thenutgraph.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2001 debate was caused by then Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]]'s announcement that Malaysia was already an Islamic State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-82481114/the-islamic-state-or-the-state-of-islam-in-malaysia|title=The Islamic State or the State of Islam in Malaysia|first=Martinez, Patricia|last=A.|date=1 December 2001|publisher=|journal=Contemporary Southeast Asia|volume=23|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Prime Minister [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]] first called Malaysia an Islamic state. Earlier that month he had made another statement, saying Malaysia was neither a theocratic or secular state.&lt;ref name="wluml.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wluml.org/node/4006|title=Malaysia: Prime Minister declares, "Yes, we ARE an Islamic state" - Women Reclaiming and Redefining Cultures|website=www.wluml.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar statement was made by Prime Minister on 12 March 2009, where he stated Malaysia was a "negara Islam".&lt;ref name="thenutgraph.com"/&gt; The [[Malaysian Chinese Association]] (MCA), a political group representing Malaysian Chinese, expressed reservations over this announcement. The MCA's position is that Malaysia is a fully secular state, and that the law transcends religion.&lt;ref name="thenutgraph.com"/&gt; The Prime Minister has asserted the continuing debate about secularism has been caused by opposition parties to advance their own political interests.&lt;ref name="wluml.org"/&gt;

When PAS was defeated in Terengganu, enforcement of female dress codes was reduced. The state PAS government in Kelantan bans traditional Malay dance theatres, banned advertisements depicting women who are not fully clothed, and enforced the wearing of headscarves, although they allowed gender segregated cinemas and concerts. Some government-controlled bodies pressure non-Muslims to also wear headscarves, and all students of the International Islamic University of Malaysia and female officers in the Royal Malaysian Police are required to wear headscarves in public ceremonies.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

The federal government does not intervene in legal disputes over conversion, leaving it to the courts. The secular courts of Malaysia have ruled they do not have the authority to decide these cases, referring them to the Syariah courts. These Islamic courts have unanimously ruled that all ethnic Malays must remain Muslims. Even non-Malays who have converted to Islam are not allowed to leave Islam, and children born to Muslim parents are considered to be Muslims.&lt;ref name="Sentinel"/&gt; A non-Muslim who wishes to marry a Muslim must first convert to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.malaysia.gov.my/EN/Relevant%20Topics/Society%20and%20Life/Citizen/Family/Marriage/ProcedureMarriageMuslimandNonMuslim/Pages/MarriageBetweenMuslimandNonMuslim.aspx/ |title=Marriage Procedures Between Muslim and Non-Muslim |publisher=Malaysian Government |accessdate=16 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722235304/http://www.malaysia.gov.my/EN/Relevant%20Topics/Society%20and%20Life/Citizen/Family/Marriage/ProcedureMarriageMuslimandNonMuslim/Pages/MarriageBetweenMuslimandNonMuslim.aspx |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Muslims who have attempted to convert have received death threats.&lt;ref name="Once"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/24/world/asia/24malaysia.html|title=Once Muslim, Now Christian and Caught in the Courts|last=Perlez|first=Jane|date=24 August 2006|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who have converted lead a secret double life. The civil court claims that conversions are under the jurisdiction of the Syariah courts, but converts contend that as they are no longer Muslim the Syariah courts hold no power over them.&lt;ref name="Secret"/&gt; Authorities only allow Sunni Islam to be practised, arresting those who stray from those beliefs.&lt;ref name="StateReligion"/&gt; Converts taken to be rehabilitated by Islamic authorities are forced to dress and act as Muslims. In at least one case a professed Hindu, who was listed as a Muslim because her parents were even though she was raised by her grandmother as a Hindu, was forced to eat beef.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6278568.stm |title=Malaysia 'convert' claims cruelty |last=Kent |first=Jonathan |publisher=BBC |date=6 July 2007 |accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only one person is known to have had their conversion from Islam accepted, an 89-year-old woman who converted to Buddhism in 1936 and had her decision accepted after her death in 2006.&lt;ref name="Sentinel"/&gt;

The debate over laws about conversion has been strong in academic and political circles, with the many non-Muslims against the law conflicting with the Muslim group who strongly support the law, causing the government a dilemma. It is illegal to disseminate any non-Islamic religious material to Muslims. The PAS party wishes that the death penalty be enacted for Muslims who attempt to convert, as part of their ultimate desire to turn Malaysia into an Islamic state.&lt;ref name="Freedom"/&gt;

==Interfaith relations==
{{See also|Malaysian Consultative Council of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Sikhism and Taoism}}
The separate religious communities have a generally tolerant relationship.&lt;ref name="StateReligion"/&gt; Festivals are held for all major religions, which are participated in by people from that religion and others in a Malaysian practise known as 'Open House'.&lt;ref name="Matic"/&gt; Malaysia has a reputation for being a successful multicultural country, with the only two serious occurrences of racial violence in modern history occurring in 1946 and 1969.&lt;ref name="Pressure"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4965580.stm |title=Pressure on multi-faith Malaysia |publisher=BBC |date=16 May 2011 |accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries have examined Malaysia as an example for handling Islamic fundamentalism.&lt;ref name="Bound for Glory"&gt;{{cite news|author=Anthony Spaeth |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317235536/http://www.time.com/time/asia/2003/mahathir/mahathir961209.html |archivedate=17 March 2009 |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/2003/mahathir/mahathir961209.html |title=Bound for Glory |publisher=Time magazine |date=9 December 1996 |accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some politicians allege that there is a creeping Islamisation of Malaysian society, and due to the links between race and religion it is thought the economic status of different races causes many religious problems.&lt;ref name="Pressure"/&gt; The predominance of Islam and its slow spread into everyday life in Malaysia has caused worry for non-Muslim groups.&lt;ref name="Sacred"/&gt; The Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi in 2004 appeared at a Christian gathering to read from the Bible and called for religious unity despite differences.

In February 2005 the Malaysian Bar Council organised the discussion of an interfaith commission, although several Islamic groups refused to participate claiming the commission would "weaken Islam". Several Muslim groups boycotted and condemned an interfaith council, claiming Islam should only be discussed by Muslims. The government states the commission was not necessary, but encourages and promotes interfaith dialogue. Some non-Muslim interfaith organistaions do exist, such as the MCCBCHS, the Malaysian Council of Churches, and the Christian Federation of Malaysia.&lt;ref name="StateReligion"/&gt;

In 2006 a memorandum was presented to the prime minister by non-Muslim cabinet members asking for a review of constitutional provisions affecting the rights of non-Muslims. After protests by Muslim leaders in the governing coalition, this was withdrawn. It is forbidden for non-Muslims to try to convert Muslims, although Muslims are allowed to convert others.&lt;ref name="StateReligion"/&gt; Malay politicians have asked the Chinese and Indian communities not to question Malay rights, for fear of igniting ethnic violence, with harmony between the races and religions being seen as a necessity.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;

[[Islam]] is the predominant religion of the country and is recognised as the state's official religion.&lt;ref name="StateReligion"/&gt; It is practised by about 60 per cent of Malaysians. Many [[Muslim]] holy days are national holidays, including the end of Ramadan, the end of the [[Hajj]], and the birthday of [[Mohammad]].&lt;ref name="MSU"/&gt; Islam is thought to have been brought to Malaysia around the 12th century by Indian traders.&lt;ref name="islam01"&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Malaysia |pages=52–53 |author=Barbara Watson Andaya, Leonard Y.

Although most people in Malaya were [[Muslim]] by the 15th century, the tolerant form of Islam brought by the Sufi meant that many traditional practices were incorporated into Islamic traditions.&lt;ref name="MSU"/&gt; Islam is generally practised liberally, although in the last 20 years strict adherence to Islamic practice has increased.&lt;ref name="MSU"/&gt; The official code of Islam in Malaysia is [[Sunni]], and the practice of any other form of Islam is heavily restricted. The government opposes what it calls "Deviant" teachings, forcing those who are deemed to follow these teachings to undergo "rehabilitation". In June 2006, 56 deviant teachings had been identified by the certain state religious authorities, including Shi'a, transcendental meditation, and Baha'i teachings. However, Department of Islamic Development Malaysia later clarified that Baha'i Faith was erroneously declared a deviant offshoot of Islam by one of the state religious authorities as the 14th Muzakarah (Conference) of the Fatwa Committee of the National Council for Islamic Religious Affairs Malaysia held on 22–23 October 1985 decided that the Baha'i doctrine is not part of Islam and the religion is recognised by the Registration Department and national census as an independent religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Department of Islamic Development Malaysia|first1=Government of Malaysia|title=Ajaran Bahai (Bahai Doctrine)|url=http://www.e-fatwa.gov.my/fatwa-kebangsaan/ajaran-bahai|website=http://www.e-fatwa.gov.my|publisher=Department of Islamic Development Malaysia|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2005 religious authorities reported that there were 22 "deviant" religious groups with around 2,820 followers in Malaysia. No statistics are given on rehabilitations, and the government actively monitors Shi'a groups. Restrictions have been imposed on Imams coming from overseas.&lt;ref name="StateReligion"/&gt;

The Malaysian government promotes a moderate version of Sunni Islam called ''Islam Hadhari''. ''Islam Hadhari'' was introduced by former Prime Minister [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]]. It is meant to encourage a balanced approach to life, and encourages inclusivity, tolerance, and looking outwards. The qualities it values are knowledge, hard work, honesty, good administration, and efficiency. The Islamic party [[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party|PAS]] desires a stricter interpretation of Islam and the promotion of Islamic law. Due to Islam being the state religion, many [[mosques]] and other religious services are supported by the government.&lt;ref name="MSU"/&gt; Control of the mosques is usually done on a state rather than a federal level.&lt;ref name="StateReligion"/&gt; The charitable [[Zakāt]] tax is collected by the government, and the government supports those wishing to make the [[Hajj|pilgrimage to Mecca]].&lt;ref name="MSU"/&gt; In 1985 Kassim Ahmed wrote a book called ''[[Hadith: A Re-evaluation]]'' which promoted [[Quranism]], but it was subsequently banned by the Malaysian government.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Many [[Malaysian Chinese]] practice various faiths, including [[Mahayana]] and other sects of [[Buddhism]], the [[Chinese folk religion]]s, [[Confucianism]] and [[Daoism]]. Although Buddhism was influential prior to the arrival of Islam, the majority of the current Chinese population arrived during British rule of Malaya. [[Chinese New Year]] is celebrated as a national holiday.&lt;ref name="MSU"/&gt; For many Chinese, religion is an essential part of their cultural life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

It is rare for any Malaysian Chinese to be an absolute follower of a particular belief. Many nominally claim membership in a certain belief, yet respect beliefs from multiple religions into their lives. The [[Chinese traditional religion]] has become a strong influence in life, and new sects have arisen trying to integrate different religious teachings. Beliefs in Malaysia have also often adopted influence from [[Animism in Malaysia|local animism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com.my/volume10/buddhism.html |title=Buddhism and Chinese Religions |publisher=The Encyclopaedia of Malaysia |author=Benny Liow Woon Khin |author2=Ong Seng Hua |accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 19% of the current population classify themselves as Buddhist. Each religious building is autonomous, and most Malaysian Chinese follow the [[Mahayana]] branch, while Thai and Sinhalese minorities in Malaysia follow the [[Therevada]] branch. A Malaysian Buddhist Council has been created to promote the study and practice of Buddhism and promote solidarity among Malaysian Buddhists. [[Vesak]] day is a national holiday, and joint celebrations take place in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor by both branches of Buddhism.

[[Chinese temple]]s mostly enshrine gods from the [[provinces of the People's Republic of China|Chinese provinces]] of [[Guangdong]] and [[Fujian]]. Malaysia has over 150 Daoist temples served by 12000 priests, with the Daoist communities sharing links with those in [[Republic of China|Taiwan]] and [[Mainland China]]. Although the religion is not as organised as others, a Malaysia Daoist Association was formed in 1995 and a Daoist Organisation League was formed in 1997.&lt;ref name="MSU"/&gt;

A Chinese population known as the [[Hui people]] practised Islam yet retained Chinese culture and have unique traditions. Communities existed in [[Singapore]], [[Pangkor Island]], and [[Sitiawan]] before the Second World War. The last established community, in [[Penang]], was dispersed when they were evicted from their homes due to development projects.&lt;ref name="Lost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/189459 |title=The lost Muslims from China |last=Bhatt |first=Himanshu |publisher=The Sun Daily |date=27 October 2011 |accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a video of a group of [[Buddhist]] practitioners from [[Singapore]] conducting religious ceremonies in a surau had become viral on [[Facebook]].  Malaysian police have arrested a resort owner after he allowed 13 Buddhists to use a Muslim prayer room([[surau]]) for their meditation at  [[Kota Tinggi]], [[Johor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waSBtJ1_mdk/ |title=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waSBtJ1_mdk  |last= |first= |publisher=The Star Online |date=14 August 2013 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident has been a frown upon Muslims in [[Malaysia]]. It has also become a hot topic in the social media. Following up at 28 August 2013, the controversial prayer room was demolished by the resort management within 21 days from the date of receipt of the notice after much protests by the residents of [[Kota Tinggi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2013/08/28/surau-kota-tinggi-demolished/ |title=Surau in Kota Tinggi resort demolished  |last= |first= |publisher=The Star Online |date=28 August 2013 |accessdate=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kosmo.com.my/kosmo/content.asp?y=2013&amp;dt=0829&amp;pub=Kosmo&amp;sec=Negara&amp;pg=ne_01.htm#ixzz2dJsAleEv/ |title=Surau kontroversi diroboh |language=Malay |publisher=Kosmo! |date=28 August 2013 |accessdate=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Syed Ahmad Salim, the resort owner explained that he had allowed the group of Buddhists to use the surau for a [[meditation]] session as he was unaware that it was an offence.

[[File:Lord Murugar statue in batu cave temple.jpg|thumb|The [[Batu Caves]] have the tallest Lord [[Murugan]] statue in the world.]]
The majority of the Tamils who make up 9% of Malaysia's population practice [[Hinduism]]. Hinduism was influential prior to Islam, but current adherents are mostly descended from migrant communities from [[Tamil Nadu]] who came to Malaya to work on British rubber plantations. A small community of migrants from North India also exists.&lt;ref name="MSU"/&gt;

Urban temples are often dedicated to a single deity, while rural temples are often home to many different deities. Most were brought with immigrants. Most temples follow the [[Saivite]] tradition from Southern India, for the worship of [[Shiva|Siva]]. The Hindu holiday of [[Thaipusam]] and [[Deepavali]] is a national holiday.&lt;ref name="MSU"/&gt; Practice of the Hindu religion is strongly linked with the cultural identity of [[Malaysian Indians]]. Those who convert to another religion may be ostracised by their family and the Indian community.&lt;ref name="POI"&gt;{{Citation

==Christianity==
{{main article|Christianity in Malaysia}}
[[File:St. John's Cathedral, Kuala Lumpur.jpg|left|thumb|[[St. John's Cathedral, Kuala Lumpur|St. John's Cathedral]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]].]]
About 10% of the population of Malaysia are [[Christian]]s, mostly non-Malay [[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|Bumiputera]], also including some Malaysian Chinese and Malaysian Indian minorities. The most common denominations are [[Anglican]], [[Methodist]], and [[Roman Catholic]]. Most Christians are found in [[East Malaysia]], where Good Friday is a public holiday in the states of [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]]. [[Christmas]] is a national holiday, although Easter is not.&lt;ref name="MSU"/&gt;

Traders with links to Christianity from the Middle East arrived in what is now Malaysia in the 7th century. Catholicism was brought by the Portuguese in the 15th century, followed by Protestantism with the Dutch in 1641. As Portuguese influence declined Protestantism began to eclipse Catholicism. Christianity spread further through missionaries who arrived during British rule in the 19th century and introduced Christianity to East Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com.my/volume10/history.html |title=History of Christianity in Malaysia |author=Hermen Shastri |publisher=Encyclopaedia of Malaysia |accessdate=15 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106055850/http://www.encyclopedia.com.my/volume10/history.html |archivedate=6 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial conversions focused mainly on the [[Straits Settlements]].

[[Christianity]] has become restricted as Malaysia has become more Islamic. Restrictions have been placed on the construction of new churches, although existing ones are allowed to operate. Christians are not allowed to attempt the conversion of Muslims and their literature must have a note saying it is for non-Muslims only. Similarly, the film ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' was restricted only to Christian viewers.&lt;ref name="MSU"/&gt; In April 2005 two Christians were arrested for distributing Christian material in front of a mosque, although charges were later dropped. The restrictions of the dissemination of Malay-language Christian material is much less strict in East Malaysia than in the west. [[Good Friday]] is also an official holiday in East Malaysia, although not a national one.&lt;ref name="StateReligion"/&gt;

The use of the Malay word "Allah" for God has caused a dispute in Malaysia, with [[Malay language]] Bibles banned due to the use of this word.&lt;ref name="MSU"/&gt; It was argued that as the Bibles could be used to spread religions other than Islam, they were against the constitution. Other ministers opposed this discrimination. In 2005 [[Mohamed Nazri Abdul Aziz]] tried to enforce this, although some of his ministers argued the national language could be used for any purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianews.it/index.php?art=3144&amp;l=en |title=No Bible in local languages |publisher=AsiaNews |date=26 April 2005 |accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bible in the indigenous [[Iban language]] was allowed, as that language has no alternate word besides "Allah" for God.&lt;ref name="MSU"/&gt;

A small [[Sikh]] community exists in Malaysia, brought by the British to form police units. They follow [[Sikhism]], and open their [[Gurdwara|places of worship]] to all races ages and genders. No Sikh holiday has been declared a national holiday,&lt;ref name="MSU"/&gt; although there are 120,000 in the country. Sikhs have, like Christians, come under pressure not to use the word "Allah" for God in their religious texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6985866.ece |title=Stones thrown at Malaysian Sikh temple following religious row |last=Parry |first=Richard Lloyd |publisher=The Sunday Times |date=13 January 2010 |accessdate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small [[Jew]]ish community existed on the island of [[Penang]]. Jews first came into contact with the Malay peninsula during the 11th century when Jewish traders traded with the [[Kedah Sultanate]] and [[Langkasuka]]. Many Jews in Malaysia came from Persia. After the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|communist revolution in China]], more Jews fled to Southeast Asia. However, the Jewish community declined, with many emigrating to countries such as Australia. Due to not having enough members to hold some Jewish rituals, the only [[synagogue]] in Penang, established in 1932, was shut down in 1976. The last burial in Penang's Jewish cemetery took pace in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penangstory.net.my/mino-content-paperhimanshu.html |title=The Jews of Penang |author=Himanshu Bhatt |publisher=Penang Story |accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1990s the community had disappeared, and it is now thought that there are only two Jews who hold Malaysian passports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishnews.net.au/life-in-jewish-malaysia |title=Life in Jewish Malaysia |last=Harris |first=Andrew |date=17 July 2009 |accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small [[Bahá'í]] group exists in Malaysia, with members from Chinese, Eurasian, Indian, Indigenous communities. It was introduced to Malaya by an Iranian couple in 1950, with the first National Spiritual Assembly being elected in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bahai.org.my/ |title=Malaysian Baha'i Community |publisher=National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Malaysia |accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A community of around 2500 [[Jain]]s lives in Malaysia, with the state of [[Ipoh]] hosting the only Jain temple in Southeast Asia. Most are [[Gujaratis]], who are thought to have arrived in Malacca in the 15th or 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jainheritagecentres.com/abroad/malaysia.htm |title=Malaysia |publisher=Jain Heritage Centres |accessdate=18 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002132404/http://www.jainheritagecentres.com/abroad/malaysia.htm |archivedate=2 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional beliefs are still practised by the [[Orang Asal]] people. Loosely classified as [[animism]], the beliefs are not recognised by the state as a religion. Animistic beliefs are passed down through oral tradition due to the lack of a writing system in indigenous groups, who call their beliefs ''agama adat'' (traditional or customary religions). The different religions are rather varied, with different names and concepts for their supreme god and other supernatural deities. Most of the beliefs are heavily influenced by the environment, with physical features such as mountains, trees, valleys, and rivers being sacred. A close relationship with nature is nurtured, and the relationship of humans and nature is a strong part of the religion, with everyday activities such as hunting and gathering having spiritual significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com.my/volume10/indigenous.html |title=Indigenous Beliefs |author=Ghazali bin Basri |publisher=Encyclopaedia of Malaysia |accessdate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Longshan Temple, Taipei 01.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|[[Mengjia Longshan Temple]] is a [[Chinese folk religion]] temple combining [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Taoism|Taoist]] practices.]]
'''Religion in [[Taiwan]]''' is characterised by a diversity of religious beliefs and practices, predominantly those pertaining to [[Chinese culture]]. [[Freedom of religion]] is inscribed in the [[constitution of the Republic of China]]. According to the census of 2005, 35% of the population adhered to [[Buddhism]], 33% to [[Taoism]] (including [[Chinese folk religion|local religion]]), 3.9% to [[Christianity]], 18.7% identified themselves as not religious, and approximately 10% were adherents of [[Chinese salvationist religions|folk religious movements of salvation]] (among them 3.5% adhered to [[Yiguandao]]).

Many statistical analyses try to distinguish between Buddhism and Taoism in Taiwan, which, along with [[Confucianism]], are rather aspects within broader "Chinese religion". It is hard to make such distinction because various Taoist deities are worshipped alongside deities which originated in Buddhism, for instance [[Guanyin]], in many temples across the country.

==History==
Prior to the 17th century the [[geography of Taiwan|island of Taiwan]] was inhabited by the [[Taiwanese aborigines]] of [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian stock]], and there were small settlements of [[China|Chinese]] and [[Japan]]ese maritime traders and pirates.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=11}} Taiwanese aborigines traditionally practised an [[animism|animistic]] [[ethnic religion]]. When the island fell under [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch rule]] in 1624, [[Protestantism]] was spread to the Taiwanese aborigines. Two years later, with the transition to [[Spanish Formosa|Spanish rule]], the [[Catholic Church]] was introduced into the island.

When the [[Han Chinese]] began to settle the island and form the [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese Chinese ethnic group]], exchanges between the indigenous religion of the Austronesian aborigines and the [[Chinese folk religion]] occurred.{{sfnp|Rubinstein|2014|p=347}} For instance, [[Ali-zu]], the [[Siraya people|Siraya]] god of fertility, has been incorporated into the Han pantheon in some places of Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Shepherd|first=John R.|year=1986|title=Sinicized Siraya Worship of A-li-tsu|journal=Bulletin of the Institute of Ethnology, Academia Sinica|issue=58|place=Taipei|publisher=Academia Sinica|pages=1–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th and 18th centuries===
[[File:Statue of Koxinga.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|Main altar of the Shrine of [[Koxinga]] in Tainan.]]
A large influx of Han Chinese began in the 1660s with the transition of imperial power from the [[Ming dynasty]] to the [[Manchu people|Manchurian]] [[Qing dynasty]].{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=12}} Many Ming loyalists fled to the south, including Zheng Chenggong alias [[Koxinga]], a military leader who fought against the Manchu dynasty.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=12}} He sailed to Taiwan in 1661 with thousands of troops, and in a brief military endeavour he drove out the Dutch and established the [[Kingdom of Tungning]], the first Chinese state on the island.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=12}} Chinese settlers, mostly from [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]], began to migrate to the island.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=12}} The policy of migration to Taiwan was restrictive until 1788, even after the island came under the political control of the Qing in 1683.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=12}}

Chinese migrants brought with them [[Chinese folk religion|local cults]] from the mainland, which served to integrate communities around the worship of locality and community gods.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=12}} As the settlers were mostly males, came from different areas, and at first not many people shared the same [[Chinese surname|surnames]] and belonged to the same [[Chinese kin|kins]], [[ancestral shrines]] of [[ancestor veneration in China|kinship gods]] did not develop until the 1790s, when sufficient generations of families had established on the island.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=13-14}}

The first settlers in Koxinga and Qing periods brought with them images or incense ashes from mainland temples, installed them in homes or temporary thatched huts, and later in proper temples, as economic circumstances permitted to build them.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=15}} Prominent temples became the foci of religious, political and social life, often eclipsing Qing officials and state-sponsored temples in their influence.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=15}}

There is little evidence that the doctrinal and initiatory religions of [[Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]] were active during this period.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=15}} Taiwan, as a frontier land, was not attractive for Buddhist and Taoist religious leaders.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=15}}

===19th century===
During the mid-[[Qing dynasty]], sects of popular [[Buddhism]] which the Japanese authorities would have later lumped together with the [[Chinese religions of fasting|religions of fasting]] (''zhāijiāo'') because of their vegetarian precepts, began to send missionaries from the mainland to Taiwan.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=16}} They were more successful in attracting converts than either pure Buddhism or Taoism.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=16}} Japanese researches of the early colonial period identified ''zhaijiao'' sects as a line of the [[Linji school]] of [[Chan Buddhism]], although contemporary scholars know that they were centered on a female creator deity, [[Wusheng Laomu]], and identify them as branches of [[Luoism]] disguising as a form of Buddhism free of ordained clergy.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=16}} ''Zhaijiao'' sects identify the ''[[sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]'' as the community of believers, not as a separate clergy.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=17}}

Apart from ''zhaijiao'' Buddhist sects, other [[Chinese salvationist religions|folk religious sects]], that were mistakenly classified as Buddhist by the Japanese government, were active in Taiwan.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=18}} The most prominent were the three [[Chinese religions of fasting|religions of fasting]]: the Jinchuang, the Longhua, and [[Xiantiandao]] traditions (the latter was introduced to Taiwan in the mid-19th century).{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=18}}

===20th century—Japanese rule===
[[File:Prince Hirohito visit to Tainan Shrine.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|Prince [[Hirohito]] visits [[Tainan]] Shinto Shrine (1923).]]

{{Main|Shinto in Taiwan}}
In 1895, the Manchu government [[Treaty of Shimonoseki|ceded Taiwan to Japan]] as part of the terms of surrender following the [[First Sino-Japanese War]].{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=18}} During the fifty-one years of [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]], governors enacted regulations to control the activities of "native religions".{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=19}} During a first period from 1895 to 1915, the Japanese adopted a ''laissez-faire'' policy towards native religions.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=19}} During a second phase from 1915 to 1937, the government tried to vigorously regulate local religions.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=19}} A third period, coinciding with the outbreak of hostilities between Japan and mainland China, saw the Japanese government start a {{nihongo|"[[Japanisation]] movement"|皇民化運動|kōminka undō|lead=yes}} that included a {{nihongo4|"temple-restructuring movement"|寺廟整理運動|jibyō seiri undō}}.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=19}}

[[Buddhism]], as a shared herita, received better treatment than [[Chinese folk religion]] and [[Taoism]].{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=20}} Some Taiwanese Buddhist groups cooperated with the Japanese government, and [[Buddhism in Japan|Japanese Buddhist]] sects sent missionaries to Taiwan  and even worked with ''zhaijiao'' Buddhist groups.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|pp=20–21}} However, given the profound differences between Chinese and Japanese Buddhist traditions (among others, Japanese priests marry, eat meat and drink wine, all of which Chinese monks abstain from), the "Japanisation" of [[Chinese Buddhism]] was resisted by Taiwanese Buddhist communities.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=21}}

In 1915, Japanese religious policies in Taiwan changed after the "[[Tapani incident|Xilai Hermitage incident]]".{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=21}} The hermitage was a ''zhaijiao'' Buddhist hall where the follower Yu Qingfang (余清芳) started an anti-Japanese uprising, in which many other [[Chinese salvationist religions|folk religious]] and [[Taoism|Taoist]] sects took part.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=21}} The Japanese government discovered the plot and Yu Qingfang was executed in a speedy trial together with ninety-four other followers.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=21}}

After the incident, the Japanese government became suspicious of what it called Taiwan's {{nihongo4|"old religious customs"||kyūkan shūkyō}}.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=21}} The government began to investigate, register and regulate local temples, and it created islandwide Buddhist religious associations—into which even ''zhaijiao'' Buddhist groups were enrolled—whose charters recommended loyalty to the government.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|pp=21–23}}

In 1937, after the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] and the start of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], [[Tokyo]] ordered the rapid acculturation of the peoples of Japan's colonies.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=24}} This included an effort to disaccustom people from Chinese traditional religions and convert them into the nexus of [[State Shinto]].{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=24}} Many [[Shinto shrine]]s were [[Shinto in Taiwan|established in Taiwan]]. Chinese family altars were replaced with ''[[kamidana]]'' and ''[[butsudan]]'', and a Japanese calendar of religious festivals was introduced.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=24}}

The subsequent "temples' restructuration movement" caused much consternation among the Chinese population and had far-reaching effects.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=25}} Its inception can be traced back to the "Conference for Improving Popular Customs" held in 1936, that far from promoting a razing of temples discussed measures for a reform and standardisation of Taoist and folk temple practices.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=24}}

The outbreak of open war between China and Japan in 1937 led to a proscription of practices and even stronger measures, as Japanese officials saw the religious culture centered around folk temples as the major obstacle to Japanisation.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=25}} Consequently, some local officials began to close and to demolish temples, burning their images, confiscating their cash and real estates, a measure that they called "sending the gods to Heaven".{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=25}} In 1940, when a new governor-general took office, the "temples' restructuration movement" was halted.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=26}}

The Japanese persecution of Chinese folk religion led to an increase in skepticism and loss of faith among the Chinese.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=27}} As a result of this loss of faith in gods, Japanese police reported a general decline in public morals.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=27}} The policies also resulted in the disappearance of the small [[Muslim]] community, until [[Islam]] was reintroduced by the [[Kuomintang]] with their retreat from mainland China to Taiwan after the end of [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Gowing|first=Peter G.|title=Islam in Taiwan|journal=Saudi Aramco World|volume=21|number=4|date=July–August 1970|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/197004/islam.in.taiwan.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another effect of the Japanese colonisation on religious life in Taiwan was due to the modernisation of infrastructures.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=29}} Before the 20th century the travel infrastructure of Taiwan was not very developed, and it was difficult for people to move from a part of the island to another.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=29}} The Japanese quickly constructed a network of railroads connecting all regions of the island.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=29}} In the field of religion, this promoted the rise in importance of some Buddhist, Taoist or folk temples as island-wide pilgrimage sites.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=29}} During this time, some gods lost their local and sub-ethnic nature and became "pan-Taiwanese".{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|pp=29–31}}

===1945 onwards—Republic of China rule===
[[File:Tian Yuan Gong.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|''Tianyuanggong'', a temple of [[Yiguandao]] in Tamsui, New Taipei.]]

In 1945, after the [[Second World War]], the administration of Taiwan was handed over to the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] through [[General Order No. 1]]. The [[People's Republic of China]] was established four years later in [[mainland China]] under the [[Communist Party of China]].

The rapid [[economic growth]] of Taiwan since the 1970s and 1980s ("[[Taiwan Miracle]]") accompanied by a quick renewal of [[Chinese folk religion]], challenging [[Max Weber]]'s theories on [[secularisation]] and [[disenchantment]], has led many scholars to investigate how folk religious culture—with its emphasis on values like loyalty, its social network of temples and gods' societies—may have contributed to the island's economic development.{{sfnp|Rubinstein|2014|p=351}} During the same period, folk religions developed ties with [[environmentalism|environmental causes]].{{sfnp|Rubinstein|2014|p=355}} [[Chinese salvationist religions]] (such as earlier [[Xiantiandao]]) become increasingly popular in Taiwan after 1945, although some of them were illegal until the 1980s.{{sfnp|Rubinstein|2014|p=346}}

After the 1950s, and especially since the 1970s, there was a significant growth of [[Buddhism]].{{sfnp|Rubinstein|2014|p=356}} [[Chinese Buddhism]] developed into distinctively [[Buddhist modernism|new forms]] with the foundation of movements like the [[Tzu Chi]], the [[Fo Guang Shan]] and the [[Dharma Drum Mountain]], which follow the philosophy of [[Humanistic Buddhism]] elaborated in China in the early 20th century.{{sfnp|Rubinstein|2014|p=357}} [[Tibetan Buddhism]] too was spread to the island.{{sfnp|Rubinstein|2014|p=357}} Since the 2000s there was an increasing cooperation between religious groups in Taiwan and mainland [[China]].{{sfnp|Rubinstein|2014|p=360}}{{sfnp|Brown|Cheng|2012|loc=''passim''}}

==Religions==

===Main religions===

====Chinese folk religion====
{{Main|Chinese folk religion}}
Chinese traditional, popular or folk religion, or simply Chinese religion, also called Shenism, defines the collection of [[grassroots]] [[ethnic religion|ethnic religious]] and spiritual experiences, disciplines, beliefs and practices of the [[Han Chinese]]. Another name of this complex of religions is Chinese Universism, coined by [[J.J.M. de Groot|Jan Jakob Maria de Groot]], and referring to Chinese religion's intrinsic [[Chinese philosophy|metaphysical]] perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=De Groot|first=J. J. M.|authorlink=J.J.M. de Groot|title=Religion in China - Universism: A Key to the Study of Taoism and Confucianism|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|year=1912|url=https://archive.org/details/religioninchinau00groo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koslowski|first=Peter|title=Philosophy Bridging the World Religions|series=A Discourse of the World Religions|publisher=Springer|year=2003|isbn=1402006489}} p. 110, quote: «J. J. M. de Groot calls "Chinese Universism" the ancient metaphysical view that serves as the basis of all classical Chinese thought. [...] In Universism, the three components of integrated universe — understood epistemologically, "heaven, earth and man", and understood ontologically, "[[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]] (the great beginning, the highest ultimate), yin and yang" — are formed.»&lt;/ref&gt;

It consists in the worship of the ''[[shen (Chinese religion)|shen]]'' (神 "[[deity|gods]]", "[[spirit]]s", "awarenesses", "consciousnesses", "[[archetype]]s"; literally "expressions", the energies that generate things and make them thrive) which can be [[nature god|nature deities]], city deities or [[tutelary deity|tutelary deities]] of other human agglomerations, [[national god|national deities]], [[culture hero|cultural]] [[hero]]es and demigods, [[ancestor]]s and [[progenitor]]s, deities of the kinship. [[Mythology|Holy narratives]] regarding some of these gods are part of [[Chinese mythology]].

Chinese folk religion in Taiwan is framed by the ritual ministry exerted by the [[Zhengyi Taoism|Zhengyi Taoist]] [[Taoist priest|clergy]] (''sanju daoshi''), independent orders of ''[[fashi]]'' (non-Taoist ritual masters), and ''[[tongji (spirit medium)|tongji]]'' media. The Chinese folk religion of Taiwan has characteristic features, such as [[Wang Ye worship]].{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|loc=Ch. 5 (p. 98-124)}} Even though [[Falun Gong]] is banned in [[China]], people in Taiwan are free to practise it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=zh:中央管法輪功廣告，台南市長認為不妥。|url=http://www.ey.gov.tw/pda/News_Content4.aspx?n=3EBFEAD6FB383702&amp;sms=4A7CECFD5899B97D&amp;s=30253D19817204F0|publisher=Executive Yuan|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chinese salvationism====
{{Main|Chinese salvationist religions}}
As of 2005, more than 10% of the population of Taiwan adhered to a variety of folk religious organisations of salvation. The largest of them is [[Yiguandao]] (with 3.5% of the population), followed by [[Tiandiism]] (whose two churches, the Holy Church of the Heavenly Virtue and the Lord of Universe Church, counted together comprise 2.2% of the island's population), [[Miledadao]] (an offshoot of Yiguandao accounting for 1.1%), [[Zailiism]] (0.8%) and [[Xuanyuanism]] (0.7%), and other minor movements including [[Precosmic Salvationism]] and Daiyiism.&lt;ref name="moi" /&gt; The three largest ones—Yiguandao, Tiandiism and Miledadao—and some others derive from the [[Xiantiandao]] tradition, making this the religious tradition of more than 7% of Taiwan's population. Other salvationisms with an important presence in Taiwan, though not documented in the 2005 official statistics, are [[Confucian Shenism]] (also called Luanism) and the recent [[Weixinism]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Taoism and Confucianism====
[[Taoism]] in Taiwan is almost entirely entwined with [[Chinese folk religion|folk religion]],{{sfnp|Brown|Cheng|2012|p=68}} as it is mostly of the [[Zhengyi Taoism|Zhengyi school]] in which priests function as ritual ministers of local communities' cults.{{sfnp|Brown|Cheng|2012|p=68}} Taiwanese Taoism lacks a [[contemplation|contemplative]], [[asceticism|ascetic]] and [[monasticism|monastic]] tradition such as northern China's [[Quanzhen Taoism]]. The [[list of Celestial Masters|Celestial Master]]s, leaders of the Zhengyi school, have their seat on the island. Nowadays the office is split into at least three lines competing to head the Taoist community.{{sfnp|Brown|Cheng|2012|p=68}}

Politicians of all parties appear at Taoist temples during campaigns, using them for political gatherings.{{sfnp|Brown|Cheng|2012|p=68}} Despite this and the contention among sects for leadership, there is no unitary structure of authority overseeing all Taoists in Taiwan.{{sfnp|Brown|Cheng|2012|p=68}} According to the 2005 census, there were 7.6 million Taoists in Taiwan (33% of the population) in that year.&lt;ref name="moi"/&gt; As of 2015, there were 9,485 registered Taoist temples in Taiwan, comprising 78.35% of all registered temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Lee Hsin-fang|first2=Jake|last2=Chung|date=15 July 2015|title=Tainan has most of nation's 12,106 temples|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/07/15/2003623092|newspaper=Taipei Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Confucianism]] is present in Taiwan in the form of many associations and [[Temple of Confucius|temples and shrines for the worship of Confucius and sages]].{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=48}} In 2005, 0.7% of the population of Taiwan adhered to [[Xuanyuanism]], which is a Confucian-based religion worshipping [[Yellow Emperor|Huangdi]] as the symbol of God.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=60}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Buddhism====
{{Main|Buddhism in Taiwan}}
[[Buddhism]] was introduced into [[Taiwan]] in the mid-[[Qing dynasty]] (18th century) through the ''[[zhaijiao]]'' popular sects.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=16}} Several forms of Buddhism thrived in Taiwan ever since. During the Japanese occupation, [[Buddhism in Japan|Japanese schools of Buddhism]] (such as [[Shingon Buddhism]], [[Jōdo Shinshū]], [[Nichiren Shū]]) gained influence over many Taiwanese Buddhist temples as part of the Japanese policy of cultural assimilation.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|pp=20–21}}

Although many Buddhist communities affiliated themselves with Japanese sects for protection, they largely retained Chinese Buddhist practices. For instance the Japanisation of Chinese Buddhism, the introduction of clerical marriage and the practice of eating meat and drinking wine, was not as successful as in the [[Korean Buddhism|Buddhist tradition]] of [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese-occupied Korea]].{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|pp=20–21}}

Following the end of [[World War II]] and the establishment of the [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Republic of China]] on the island, many monks from [[mainland China]] moved to Taiwan, including [[Yin Shun]] (印順). They gave significant contribution to the development of [[Chinese Buddhism]] on the island.

The Buddhist Association of the Republic of China remained the dominant Buddhist organisation until the end of restrictions of religious activities in the 1980s. Today there are several large [[Humanistic Buddhism|Humanistic Buddhist]] and [[Buddhist modernist]] organisations in Taiwan, including the [[Dharma Drum Mountain]] (''Făgŭshān'' {{lang|zh|法鼓山}}) founded by  [[Sheng-yen|Sheng Yen]] ({{lang|zh|聖嚴}}), [[Fo Guang Shan|Buddha's Light International]] (''Fógŭangshān'' {{lang|zh|佛光山}}) founded by [[Hsing Yun]] ({{lang|zh|星雲}}), and the [[Tzu Chi|Tzu Chi Foundation]] (''Cíjì jījīnhùi'' {{lang|zh|慈濟基金會}}) founded by [[Cheng Yen]] ({{lang|zh|證嚴法師}}).

The ''[[zhaijiao]]'' Buddhist groups maintain an influence in society. In recent decades, also non-Chinese forms of Buddhism, such as [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and [[Soka Gakkai]] [[Nichiren Buddhism]], have expanded in Taiwan.{{sfnp|Rubinstein|2014|p=357}} Adherence to Buddhism has grown significantly in Taiwan since the 1980s.{{sfnp|Rubinstein|2014|p=356}} From 800.000 in 1983, the number of Buddhists expanded to 4.9 million in 1995 and subsequently to 8 million (35% of the population) in 2005.{{sfnp|Clart|Jones|2003|p=186}}

By May 1955 there were eighteen Bahá'ís in six localities across Taiwan. The first [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] in Taiwan was established in [[Tainan]] in 1956. The [[National Spiritual Assembly]] was first established in 1967 when there were local assemblies in [[Taipei]], Tainan, [[Hualien City|Hualien]], and [[Pingtung City|Pingtung]]. Around 2005, the Bahá'ís showed up in the national census with 16,000 members and 13 assemblies.&lt;ref name="moi"/&gt;

[[Christianity]] in Taiwan constituted 3.9% of the population according to the census of 2005.&lt;ref name="moi"/&gt; Christians on the island included approximately 600,000 [[Protestants]], 300,000 [[Catholics]] and a small number of [[Mormons]].&lt;ref name="moi"/&gt;

Despite its minority status, many of the early political leaders of the [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Republic of China]] were Christians. For instance, [[George Leslie Mackay]] was a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] and [[Nitobe Inazō]] was a [[Methodism|Methodist]] later converted to [[Quakerism]]. Several Republic of China presidents have been Christians, including [[Sun Yat-sen]] who was a [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]], [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] who were [[Methodism|Methodists]], [[Lee Teng-hui]] who is a Presbyterian.

Indeed, Christianity in Taiwan has been on the decline since the 1970s, after a strong growth from 1950 to the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rubinstein|first=Murray A.|title=The Other Taiwan: 1945 To the Present|publisher=M. E. Sharpe|year=1994}} p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islam====
{{Main|Islam in Taiwan}}
[[File:台北清真大寺.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|[[Taipei Grand Mosque]] in Da'an, Taipei.]]
Though Islam originated in the [[Arabian Peninsula]], it had spread eastward to China as early as the 7th century AD. Muslim merchants married local Chinese women, creating a new Chinese ethnic group called the [[Hui people]]. Islam first reached Taiwan in the 17th century when Muslim families from the southern China's coastal province of [[Fujian]] accompanied [[Koxinga]] on his invasion to oust the [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch from Taiwan]]. Islam did not spread and their descendants became assimilated into the local Taiwanese society adopting the local customs and religions.

During the [[Chinese Civil War]], some 20,000 Muslims, mostly soldiers and civil servants, fled mainland China with the [[Kuomintang]] to Taiwan. Since the 1980s, thousands of Muslims from Myanmar and Thailand, who are descendants of nationalist soldiers who fled [[Yunnan]] as a result of the communist takeover, have migrated to Taiwan in search of a better life. In more recent years, there has been a rise in Indonesian workers to Taiwan. According to the census of 2005, there were 58,000 Muslims in Taiwan in that year.&lt;ref name="moi"/&gt;

====Judaism====

====Hinduism====
{{main|Hinduism in Taiwan}}

[[Hinduism]] is a minor faith in Taiwan, compromising mainly of adherents from [[Indonesians in Taiwan|Bali]]&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/infohindu/status/580028772688076800&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Indians in Taiwan|India]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080705031948/therealtaiwan.com/indians-in-taiwan-diwali-festival-of-lights/1068 Indians in Taiwan: Diwali Festival of Lights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160527143724/www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/intl-community/2009/03/15/200223/Kaleidoscope-of.htm Indians in Taiwan: Kaleidoscope of merrymaking for Hindu festival]&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4567">{{About|the Latin phrase|the fictional building in the Marvel Universe|Sanctum Sanctorum}}

The [[Latin]] phrase '''''sanctum sanctorum''''' is a translation of the Hebrew term ''Qṓḏeš HaQŏḏāšîm'' ([[Holy of Holies]]) which generally refers in Latin texts to the holiest place of the [[Tabernacle]] of the [[Israelites]] and later the [[Temples in Jerusalem]], but also has some derivative use in application to imitations of the Tabernacle in church architecture.

The plural form ''sancta sanctorum'' is also used, arguably as a [[synecdoche]], referring to the holy relics contained in the sanctuary. The [[Vulgate]] translation of the Bible uses ''sancta sanctorum'' for the [[Holy of Holies]].&lt;ref&gt;2 Chronicles 5:7, in Latin (Vulgate): "Et intulerunt sacerdotes arcam foederis Domini in locum suum, id est, ad oraculum templi, in Sancta sanctorum subter alas cherubim". In English (King James Version): "And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim".&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the derivative usage to denote the [[Sancta Sanctorum]] chapel in the complex of [[Archbasilica of St. John Lateran|St. John Lateran]], Rome.

In [[Hinduism]], a temple's innermost part where the [[cult image]] ''([[Murti]])'' of the deity is kept forms the ''[[Garbha griha]]'', also referred to as a sanctum sanctorum.

==Etymology==
The Latin word ''[[wikt:sanctum|sanctum]]'' is the neuter form of the adjective "[[sacred|holy]]", and ''sanctorum'' its [[genitive]] plural. Thus the term ''[[wikt:sanctum sanctorum|sanctum sanctorum]]'' literally means "the holy [place/thing] of the holy [places/things]", [[Romanization of Hebrew|replicating in Latin the Hebrew construction]] for the [[superlative]], with the intended meaning "the most holy [place/thing]".

==Use of the term in modern languages ==
The Latin word ''sanctum'' may be used in [[English language|English]], following Latin, for "a holy place", or a [[sanctuary]], as in the novel ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' (1848) which refers to "the sanctum of school room".

[[Romance languages]] tend to use the form ''sancta sanctorum'', treating it as masculine and singular. E.g., the Spanish dictionary of the [[Royal Spanish Academy|Real Academia Española]] admits ''sanctasanctórum'' (without the space and with an accent) as a derivative Spanish noun denoting both the Holy of Holies in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], any secluded and mysterious place, and something that a person holds in the highest esteem.

The term is still often used by Indian writers for the [[garbhagriha]] or inner shrine chamber in [[Hindu temple architecture]], after being introduced by British writers in the 19th century.

==German Catholic processions==
Some regional branches of the Catholic Church, e. g. Germans, are wont to refer to the [[Blessed Sacrament]], when adored in the tabernacle or in exposition or procession (e.g. on [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]]), as the Holy of Holies. By custom, It is adored with genuflection; with a double genuflection, that is a short moment of kneeling on both knees, if in exposition; in the procession this ritual may be nonrigoristically alleviated, but at least a simple genuflection is appropriate when It is elevated by the priest for blessing or immediately after transsubstantiation. Personnel in uniform — which in Germany includes student corporations — give the military salute when passing by or in the moment of elevation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==The "enclosed house" of Hindu temple architecture==
The ''[[garbhagriha]]'' in [[Hindu]] temple architecture (a [[shrine]] inside a [[Hindu temple|temple complex]] where the main [[deity]] is installed in a separate building by itself inside the complex) has also been compared to a "sanctum sanctorum" in texts on Hindu temple architecture, though the Sanskrit term actually means "enclosed house" or "the deep interior of the house". However, some Indian English authors seem to have translated the Sanskrit term literally as "womb house". &lt;ref&gt;Mountains of the God — Page 49 Kuldip Singh Gulia  The Architecture of Temples Most of the architectural elements are the same in all temples and each has a specific name. The sanctum sanctorum is called the garbha griha — the womb house. The garbha griha is a square cell that is.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Buddhism}}

The '''Schools of Buddhism''' are the various institutional and doctrinal divisions of [[Buddhism]] that have existed from ancient times up to the present. The classification and nature of various [[Doctrine|doctrinal]], [[Buddhist philosophy|philosophical]] or [[Culture|cultural]] facets of the schools of Buddhism is vague and has been interpreted in many different ways, often due to the sheer number (perhaps thousands) of different sects, subsects, movements, etc. that have made up or currently make up the whole of Buddhist traditions. The sectarian and conceptual divisions of Buddhist thought are part of the modern framework of [[Buddhist studies]], as well as [[comparative religion]] in [[Asia]].

From a largely [[English-language]] standpoint, and to some extent in most of [[Western world|Western]] [[academia]], Buddhism is separated into two groups at its foundation: [[Theravada|Theravāda]], literally "the Teaching of the Elders" or "the Ancient Teaching," and [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]], literally the "Great Vehicle." The most common classification among scholars is threefold, with Mahāyāna itself split between the traditional Mahāyāna teachings, and the [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]] teachings which emphasize esotericism.

== Classifications ==
The ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Religion'' distinguishes three types of classification of Buddhism, separated into "Movements", "Nikāyas" and "Doctrinal schools":{{Clarify|date=March 2012}}

* Schools:
** [[Theravada]], ''primarily in [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]].''
** [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]], ''primarily in [[East Asia]].''
** [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]], ''primarily in [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]], [[Mongolia]] and the Russian republic of [[Kalmykia]].''
* [[Nikāya]]s, or monastic fraternities, three of which survive at the present day:
** [[Theravada|Theravāda]], in [[Southeast Asia]] and [[South Asia]]
** [[Dharmaguptaka]], in [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]]
** [[Mulasarvastivada|Mūlasarvāstivāda]], in the Tibetan tradition
* Doctrinal schools
**[[Svatantrika-Prasaṅgika_distinction|Svatantrika &amp; Prasaṅgika]]

== Terminology ==
The terminology for the major divisions of Buddhism can be confusing, as Buddhism is variously divided by scholars and practitioners according to geographic, historical, and philosophical criteria, with different terms often being used in different contexts. The following terms may be encountered in descriptions of the major Buddhist divisions:

; "Conservative Buddhism": an alternative name for the early Buddhist schools.
; "[[Early Buddhist schools]]": the schools into which Buddhism became divided in its first few centuries; only one of these survives as an independent school, Theravāda
; "[[East Asian Buddhism]]": a term used by scholars&lt;ref&gt;B &amp; G, Gethin, R &amp; J, P &amp; K&lt;/ref&gt; to cover the Buddhist traditions of Japan, Korea, and most of China and Southeast Asia
; "Eastern Buddhism": an alternative name used by some scholars&lt;ref name="Penguin, Harvey"&gt;Penguin, Harvey&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} for East Asian Buddhism; also sometimes used to refer to all traditional forms of Buddhism, as distinct from Western(ized) forms.
; "[[Ekayāna]] (one yana): Mahayana texts such as the Lotus Sutra and the Avatamsaka Sutra sought to unite all the different teachings into a single great way. These texts serve as the inspiration for using the term Ekayāna in the sense of "one vehicle". This "one vehicle" became a key aspect of the doctrines and practices of Tiantai and Tendai Buddhist sects, which subsequently influenced Chán and Zen doctrines and practices. In Japan, the one-vehicle teaching of the Lotus Sutra also inspired the formation of the Nichiren sect.
; "Esoteric Buddhism": usually considered synonymous with "Vajrayāna".&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Religion'', Macmillan, New York, volume 2, page 440&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have applied the term to certain practices found within the Theravāda, particularly in Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;''Indian Insights'', Luzac, London, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}
; "Hīnayāna": literally meaning "lesser vehicle." It is considered a controversial term when applied by the [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] to mistakenly refer to the Theravāda school, and as such is widely viewed as condescending and pejorative.&lt;ref&gt;"Hinayana (literally, 'inferior way') is a polemical term, which self-described Mahāyāna (literally, 'great way') Buddhist literature uses to denigrate its opponents", p. 840, ''MacMillan Library Reference Encyclopedia of Buddhism'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Hīnayāna refers to the now non extant schools with limited set of views, practices and results, prior to the development of the Mahāyāna traditions. The term is currently most often used as a way of describing a stage on the path in Tibetan Buddhism, but is often mistakenly confused with the contemporary Theravāda tradition, which is far more complex, diversified and profound, than the literal and limiting definition attributed to Hīnayāna .&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Reginald A (2000) ''Indestructible Truth: The Living Spirituality of Tibetan Buddhism,'' p.240&lt;/ref&gt; Its use in scholarly publications is now also considered controversial.&lt;ref&gt;"The supposed Mahayana-Hinayana dichotomy is so prevalent in Buddhist literature that it has yet fully to loosen its hold over scholarly representations of the religion", p. 840, MacMillan Library Reference Encyclopedia of Buddhism, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

; "Lamaism": an old term, still sometimes used, synonymous with Tibetan Buddhism; widely considered derogatory.
; "[[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]]": a movement that emerged from [[early Buddhist schools]], together with its later descendants, East Asian and Tibetan Buddhism.  Vajrayāna traditions are sometimes listed separately. The main use of the term in East Asian and Tibetan traditions is in reference to spiritual levels,&lt;ref name="Penguin Handbook"&gt;'&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} regardless of school.
; "Mainstream Buddhism": a term used by some scholars for the early Buddhist schools.
; "Mantrayāna": usually considered synonymous with "Vajrayāna".&lt;ref name="Harvey, pages 153ff"&gt;Harvey, pages 153ff&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tendai]] school in Japan has been described as influenced by Mantrayana.&lt;ref name="Penguin Handbook"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}
;"[[Newar Buddhism]]": a non-monastic, caste based Buddhism with patrilineal descent and Sanskrit texts.
; "[[Nikaya Buddhism|Nikāya Buddhism]]" or "schools": an alternative term for the early Buddhist schools.
; "Non-Mahāyāna": an alternative term for the early Buddhist schools.
; "Northern Buddhism": an alternative term used by some scholars&lt;ref name="Penguin, Harvey"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} for Tibetan Buddhism. Also, an older term still sometimes used to encompass both East Asian and Tibetan traditions. It has even been used to refer to East Asian Buddhism alone, without Tibetan Buddhism.
; "Secret Mantra": an alternative rendering of Mantrayāna, a more literal translation of the term used by schools in Tibetan Buddhism when referring to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Jeffrey (1985) ''The Ultimate Deity in Action Tantra and Jung's Warning against Identifying with the Deity'' Buddhist-Christian Studies, Vol. 5, (1985), pp. 159–172&lt;/ref&gt;
; "Sectarian Buddhism": an alternative name for the early Buddhist schools.
; "Southeast Asian Buddhism": an alternative name used by some scholars&lt;ref&gt;R &amp; J, P &amp; K&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} for Theravāda.

=== Influences on East Asian schools ===

The following later schools used the ''[[vinaya]]'' of the [[Dharmaguptaka]]:

*Chinese Buddhism, especially the [[Vinaya School]]
*Korean Buddhism, especially [[Gyeyul]]
*Vietnamese Buddhism
*Japanese [[Risshū (Buddhism)|Ritsu]]

The following involve philosophical influence:

*The Japanese [[Satyasiddhi|Jojitsu]] is considered by some an offshoot of [[Sautrāntika]]; others consider it to be derived from Bahuśrutīya.
*The Chinese/Japanese [[Kusha school]] is considered an offshoot of [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivāda]], influenced by [[Vasubandhu]].

== Theravāda subschools ==

The different schools in Theravāda often emphasize different aspects (or parts) of the [[Pāli Canon|Pāli canon]] and the later commentaries, or differ in the focus on and recommended way of practice. There are also significant differences in strictness or interpretation of the ''[[vinaya]]''.

'''Seymour Rosofsky''' (b. 1924 – d. 1981) was an American artist, who has been described as one of the key figures in twentieth-century Chicago art.&lt;ref name="Smart"&gt;Corbett, John and Jim Dempsey, Jessica Moss, and Richard A.

He was also featured, along with Campoli, Golub, and Theodore Halkin in the Art Institute’s "Veteran's Exhibition" of 1948.&lt;ref name="Smart" /&gt; In 1958, he received a Fulbright Fellowship to go to Rome; in 1962, a Guggenheim Foundation grant took him and his family to Paris.&lt;ref name="Boris" /&gt;&lt;ref name="”CPS”" /&gt; 

Rosofsky was part of the loose group of artists dubbed the “Monster Roster,” which attracted a degree of international attention in the 1950s as a “Chicago School”&lt;ref name="”Malone55”"&gt;Malone, Patrick T. and Peter Selz. “Is There a New Chicago School?” ''ARTnews'', October 1955, p. 36–9.&lt;/ref&gt; He was part of a 1956 show at Beloit College curated by Allan Frumkin that brought the group into focus, and the later shows, “The New Chicago Decade: 1950–1960” (Lake Forest College, 1959) and “Haut artistes de Chicago” (Paris, 1962).&lt;ref name="Schulze72" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cozzolino" /&gt; Throughout his career, Rosofsky was associated with Chicago’s more international galleries, such as Richard Feigen, Richard Gray, and B.

Rosofsky taught at Chicago Loop College (later [[Harold Washington College]]) from 1964 until his death from a heart attack in 1981.&lt;ref name="Boris" /&gt; He has been cited by many artists, including [[Phyllis Bramson]] and [[William Conger]], as an influence.&lt;ref name="”ArtDaily”"&gt;artdaily.

==Style and themes==
Rosofsky wrestled with his experiences through intensely personal, penetrating, often brutal, imagery created in a staunchly figurative, gestural style that critics likened to June Leaf’s, and described as a mix of expressionism and “surrealist hysteria.”&lt;ref name="Schulze72" /&gt;&lt;ref name=”Miller11”&gt;Miller, Chris. [https://art.newcity.com/2011/05/30/review-seymour-rosofskyelmhurst-art-museum/ “Review: Seymour Rosofsky/Elmhurst Art Museum,”] ''New City'', May 30, 2011. Retrieved November 26, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most of the Monster Roster artists, however, his work was more grounded in realism, due to his studies with Boris Anisfeld.&lt;ref name=”Artner85”&gt;Artner, Alan G. [https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1985-02-17-8501090900-story.html “Exhibit Displays But Can`t Reveal the Mysteries of Seymour Rosofsky,”] ''Chicago Tribune'', February 17, 1985. Retrieved November 26, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Critic Franz Schulze applauded his “rich color, carefully interwoven tonalities and assured drawing.”&lt;ref name=”Miller11” /&gt; The Chicago Tribune’s Alan Artner called his sense of composition masterly, his palette subtle, and his way with the figure strong, but noted a tendency to overload his works that sometimes made them difficult to understand.&lt;ref name=”Artner85” /&gt;

Rosofsky was drawn to doleful and withering themes, such as the individual’s loss of power in modern life, fraught male-female relationships, the abuse of power and the absurdity of war, often borne out in battered, distorted, sometimes grotesquely comic figures in haunting, fantastical interiors and cityscapes.&lt;ref name="Schulze72" /&gt;&lt;ref name=”CPS” /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boris" /&gt; A lifelong Chicagoan, Rosofsky is considered the post-war artist for whom Chicago—the lake, people, buildings, and abrasive character—was most integral, his bizarre figures and settings often bearing a specificity to the city’s locales and conditions.&lt;ref name="Schulze72" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boris" /&gt; Critic Alan Artner described him as a “poet of exhaustion” depicting an urban carnival of malaise, “disappointment and dejection, of things passing away without proper eulogy, of winter and fading light.”&lt;ref name=”Artner85” /&gt;

==Works==
In the 1950s and early 1960s, Rosofsky often focused on nightmarish modern narratives that featured faceless men, often in hospitals, wheelchairs, and other uncomfortable, vulnerable situations or empty spaces, which he depicted in agitated lines that some critics liken to [[Alberto Giacometti]]’s graphic work and [[Francis Bacon]]’s tortured interiors (e.g., ''Patient in a Dentist Chair'', 1961).&lt;ref name="”Smart”"&gt;Smart Museum of Art.

Time spent in Paris on a fellowship led to a greater surrealist turn in Rosofsky’s work, realized in a fantastical, frightening vocabulary of clowns, menacing faces, and bizarre scenarios urgency and a more intense color palette.&lt;ref name="Boris" /&gt;  He often employed these figures in works examining power (e.g., his sardonic depiction of Chicago politics, ''Daley Machine'', 1968) and social issues (''Homage to Spain, Thalidomide Children and Others'', 1965) that in their focus on generalized dehumanization shared more with New York artist George Tooker, than with Rosofsky’s former classmate, Leon Golub’s more political work.&lt;ref name=”Artner85” /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boris" /&gt; By the 1970s, Rosofsky turned to caustic depictions of fraught male-female relationships and roles that portrayed cardboard cutouts or stage puppet-like men and women, enacting disturbing scenes in theatrical domestic scenes, such as ''The Couple'' (1973) or ''The Love Fountain'' (1967).&lt;ref name="Boris" /&gt;&lt;ref name=”Artner85” /&gt; Rosofsky’s last works were lighter and more detached, and included “commedia dell’ arte” drawings commissioned for the 1982 Venice Biennale’s Carnevale del Teatro.&lt;ref name="Boris" /&gt;

==History==
===Party foundation===
In January 2013 Fiji's military regime promulgated new regulations governing the registration of political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/south-pacific/8184406/Fiji-regime-cracks-down-on-political-parties |title=Fiji regime cracks down on political parties |publisher=Stuff |author=Michael Field |date=2013-01-16 |accessdate=2013-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the new provisions was a requirement that all political parties be named in English rather than Fijian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=73429 |title=SDL says Fiji name change requirement is ridiculous |publisher=Radio New Zealand International |date=2013-01-17 |accessdate=2013-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than changing its name, the [[Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua]] (SDL) Party wound itself up, reforming as the Social Democratic Liberal Party in order to retain the SDL acronym.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=73594 |title=Fiji’s main party dissolved in face of onerous decree |publisher=Radio New Zealand International |date=2013-01-25 |accessdate=2013-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=223452 |title=SDL alive |publisher=Fiji Times |author=Nasik Swami |date=2013-01-26 |accessdate=2013-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a subsequent amendment to the Political Parties Decree banned the use of the acronyms of former parties, forcing the party to switch to "SODELPA".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/radio/program/pacific-beat/fiji-sdl-party-changes-name-again-to-get-around-decree/1094002 |title=Fiji SDL Party changes name again to get around decree |publisher=Radio Australia |date=2013-02-26 |accessdate=2014-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party was provisionally led by Dr [[Tupeni Baba]], but in March 2013 it unanimously selected former SDL Cabinet Minister Ro [[Teimumu Kepa]] as its first permanent leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fijitoday.wordpress.com/2014/03/08/ro-teimumu-kepa-is-the-new-leader-of-sodelpa/ |title=Ro Teimumu Kepa is the new leader of SODELPA |publisher=Fiji Today |date=2014-03-07 |accessdate=2014-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9813">The '''Society of Saint Pius V''' ('''SSPV'''; {{lang-lat|Societas Sacerdotalis Sancti Pii Quinti}}), is a [[Traditionalist Catholic]] society of priests, formed in 1983 and based in [[Oyster Bay Cove, New York]]. The priests of SSPV broke away from the [[Society of St. Pius X]] over liturgical issues, and hold that many in the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church no longer adhere to the Catholic faith but instead profess a new, [[Modernism (Roman Catholicism)|modernist]], [[Second Vatican Council|Conciliar]] religion. SSPV priests regard the questions of the legitimacy of the present hierarchy and the possibility that the [[Holy See]] is unoccupied ([[sedevacantism]]) to be unresolved. The SSPV is led by its founder, Bishop [[Clarence Kelly]].

==History==

===Founding===
The SSPV developed out of the [[Society of St. Pius X]] (SSPX), the traditionalist organization founded by Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]]. In 1983, Lefebvre expelled four priests (Fr. [[Clarence Kelly]], Fr. [[Daniel Dolan]], Fr. [[Anthony Cekada]], and Fr. Eugene Berry) of the SSPX's Northeast USA District from the society, partly because they were opposed to his instructions that Mass be celebrated according to the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal issued by [[John XXIII]]. Other issues occasioning the split were Lefebvre's order that Society priests must accept the decrees of nullity handed down by diocesan marriage tribunals and the acceptance of new members into the group who had been ordained to the priesthood according to the revised sacramental rites of [[Paul VI|Pope Paul VI]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.traditionalmass.org/articles/article.php?id=48&amp;catname=12 "Letter of 'the Nine' to Abp. Marcel Lefebvre", Traditionalmass.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Nine" (the four expelled priests plus five who voluntarily left the SSPX)&lt;ref name=zenit/&gt; balked at Lefebvre's imposition of the 1962 missal which they believed included  departures from the liturgical traditions of the Church (for example, adding the name of St. Joseph to the [[Canon of the Mass]]).&lt;ref&gt;The objection to St Joseph's inclusion is unrelated to his sanctity. Many Catholics felt that St Joseph had historically and generally been overlooked, if not slighted. Pope John XXIII’s addition of St Joseph into the Canon in 1962 was seen as the "personal wish of the pope" (Amerio 89). Some Catholics feel that St Joseph's non-martyr status disqualifies him from inclusion in the Canon. (Amerio, Romano. ''Iota Unum: A Study of the Changes in the Catholic Church in the 20th Century.'' Trans. Rev. Fr. John P. Parsons. Kansas City: Sarto House, 1996.).&lt;/ref&gt; A more basic reason was the belief amongst the Nine that the men who had reigned as pope since the death of [[Pope Pius XII]] (d. 1958) had not been legitimate popes (Canon 1325, no. 2, 1917),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.traditionalmass.org/articles/article.php?id=96&amp;catname=12 Cekada, Anthony. "The Nine vs. Lefebvre: We Resist you to Your Face", TraditionalMass.org]&lt;/ref&gt; although Fr. Cekada later stated that "...[t]he 'pope question' was not raised at the time, and was not at issue".&lt;ref&gt;[http://truerestoration.blogspot.com/2008/10/interview-with-fr-anthony-cekada.html Heiner, Steven. "An Interview with Fr. Anthony Cekada regarding Archbishop Lefebvre and the 1983 split with the SSPX", TrueRestoration.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  They held that these Popes had officially taught and/or accepted heretical doctrines and therefore had lost or never occupied the See of Rome (Canon 188, no. 4, 1917).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.traditionalmass.org/articles/article.php?id=12&amp;catname=10 Dolan, Daniel L. "Canon 188.4 or Where is the Church", TraditionalMass.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Society of St. Pius X, they believed that there had been novel interpretations of the traditional teachings of the Church on issues such as [[freedom of religion|religious liberty]]. One of the Nine, Fr. Dolan, admitted that while a member of the SSPX, he had concluded that the See of Peter was vacant.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.dailycatholic.org/dolanttt.htm "Bishop Daniel L. dolan", DailyCatholic]&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Nine" set up a new priestly society under the leadership of Fr. Clarence Kelly, their former District Superior. The eight priests were Frs. Thomas Zapp, Donald Sanborn, Anthony Cekada, Daniel Dolan, William Jenkins, Eugene Berry, Joseph Collins, and Martin Skierka. Additional priests joined shortly thereafter.

===Splits===

Within a few years, about half of the original nine SSPV priests separated from Fr. Kelly. Most of them formed an openly [[sedevacantist]] group,  "Catholic Restoration", under the leadership of Frs. [[Daniel Dolan|Dolan]] and Sanborn. Both were later consecrated as bishops in the episcopal lineage of the Vietnamese Archbishop [[Ngo Dinh Thuc Pierre Martin]]. The other priests founded independent ministries.

Fr. Cekada states&lt;ref&gt;Fr. Anthony Cekada, ''The Nine vs. Lefebvre: We Resist You To Your Face'' (2008), p. 14. http://www.traditionalmass.org/images/articles/NineVLefebvre.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; that this resulted from the SSPV's intrinsic distrust of a centralized authority as existed in the SSPX, which makes the latter vulnerable to being "subverted with one stroke of a pen" to the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. Rather than independent congregations being a weakness and something to be lamented, Cekada considers all such groups and priests taken together preferable to the SSPX, which has continued to hold negotiations with Rome and uses the 1962 Missal.

===Episcopal orders===
On 19 October 1993, 86-year-old Bishop [[Alfredo Méndez-Gonzalez]], who had served as Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Arecibo|Arecibo]], [[Puerto Rico]] until his retirement in 1974, consecrated Fr. Kelly as a bishop at a ceremony in [[Carlsbad, California]]. Bishop Méndez had already publicly ordained two seminarians of the SSPV to the priesthood in 1990. Kelly's consecration was announced a few days after Bishop Méndez's death in 1995. The Roman Catholic Church considers Kelly's consecration illicit, i.e. not in conformity with canon law.&lt;ref name=zenit/&gt;

On Wednesday, 28 February 2007, Bishop Kelly consecrated Fr. Joseph Santay, CSPV, to the episcopacy at Oyster Bay Cove, New York.&lt;ref&gt;See photos of consecration at {{cite web|url=http://www.stpiusvchapel.org/photos/consecration2/consecration2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128062048/http://www.stpiusvchapel.org/photos/consecration2/consecration2.html |archivedate=2012-01-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structures==
The SSPV currently has five permanent [[priory|priories]], and its priests serve a network of chapels, churches, and temporary worship locations in 12 [[U.S. state|states]] of the U.S. (as of 2013).  The SSPV operates only in North America. The SSPV is not considered to have canonical status within the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=zenit&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/liturgy/zlitur366.htm|title=Mass With the Society of St. Pius X|newspaper=[[Zenit News Agency]]|date=June 21, 2011|via=[[EWTN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SSPV opened Immaculate Heart Seminary, located on sixty-one acres of property in the Catskill Mountains of New York, in the fall of 1996.  The Founder and Spiritual Father of the Congregation of St. Pius V is the Most Reverend Clarence Kelly.  The first priest member of the Congregation, Father Joseph Santay, was ordained in 2001, and consecrated a Bishop in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Immaculate Heart Seminary :: IHS|url = http://www.congregationofstpiusv.com/about-us/immaculate-heart-seminary/|website = www.congregationofstpiusv.com|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Associated religious communities===
The ''Daughters of Mary, Mother of Our Savior''[http://www.daughtersofmary.net] are a congregation of [[Nun#Distinction between a nun and a religious sister|Sisters]] founded by  then-Fr. Kelly in 1984. Their congregation's [[motherhouse]] and [[novitiate]] are located in Round Top, New York, in the [[Catskill Mountains]] area. The Sisters have  two additional houses in the United States (Melville, NY and White Bear Lake, MN) where they  run schools, and they are also involved in other types of charity work, such as visiting [[nursing homes]]. The current Mother General is Mother Mary Bosco.

The ''Congregation of St. Pius V'' (CSPV) is a Society of Common Life for priests and coadjutor brothers, founded by Bishop Kelly.  CSPV was formed to provide a canonical structure for the incardination of priests and the affiliation of religious.   The Congregation operates Immaculate Heart Seminary in Round Top, New York for its candidates, under the direction of Bishop Joseph Santay, CSPV.  The seminary's graduates are ordained by Bishops Kelly and/or Santay.  As of 2018, the CSPV had 10 priest members including Bp. Santay and two Brothers.&lt;ref&gt;See http://congregationofstpiusv.com&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, their congregations include many atheists, agnostics, and theists within their membership. The roots of Unitarian Universalism lie in [[liberal Christianity]], specifically [[Unitarianism]] and [[Christian universalism|universalism]]. Unitarian Universalists state that from these traditions comes a deep regard for intellectual freedom and inclusive love.  Congregations and members seek inspiration and derive insight from all major world religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html#Unitarian | title =Unitarian-Universalism | work = Major Religions Ranked by Size | publisher =Adherents |accessdate=April 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The beliefs of individual Unitarian Universalists range widely, including [[atheism]], [[agnosticism]], [[pantheism]], [[deism]], [[Judaism]], [[Islam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uua.org/beliefs/welcome/290746.shtml|title=Muslim Unitarian Universalists|date=15 September 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christianity]], [[neopaganism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism|Daoism]], [[Religious humanism|Humanism]], and many more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Los Gatos | url = http://uuflg.org/ministry-2/rev-fa-jun-minister/ | title = Our Minister}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] (UUA) was formed in 1961 through the consolidation of the [[American Unitarian Association]], established in 1825, and the [[Universalist Church of America]],&lt;ref name="harvard1"&gt;Harvard Divinity School: [http://div.hds.harvard.edu/library/bms/merger_timeline_1900s.html Timeline of Significant Events in the Merger of the Unitarian and Universalist Churches During the 1900s]&lt;/ref&gt; established in 1793. The UUA is headquartered in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], and serves churches mostly in the United States. A group of thirty Philippine congregations is represented as a sole member within the UUA. The [[Canadian Unitarian Council]] (CUC) became an independent body in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cuc.ca/cuc-uua-transition/|title=CUC-UUA Transition - Canadian Unitarian Council|website=cuc.ca|access-date=2014-06-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160219193832/http://cuc.ca/cuc-uua-transition/|archive-date=2016-02-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UUA and CUC are, in turn, two of the seventeen members of the [[International Council of Unitarians and Universalists]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel McKanan, "Unitarianism, Universalism, and Unitarian Universalism", ''Religion Compass'' 7/1 (2013), 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

New England Unitarians evolved from the [[Pilgrim Fathers]]' [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational Christianity]], which was originally based on a literal reading of the [[Bible|Holy Bible]].  Liberalizing Unitarians rejected the [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] belief in the tri-personal godhead: Father, Son, and Holy Ghost/Spirit.  Instead, they asserted a unitary notion of God. In addition, they rejected the doctrine of [[original sin]], moving away from the [[Calvinism]] of the [[Congregationalists]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|title=UUA: History|url=http://www.uua.org/beliefs/history/index.shtml|publisher=Unitarian Universalist Association|accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New England [[Universalists]] rejected the [[Puritan]] forefathers' emphasis on the select few, the Elect, who were supposed to be saved from eternal damnation by a just God. Instead Universalists asserted that all people will eventually be reconciled with God .&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Universalists rejected the [[Fire and brimstone|hellfire and damnation]] of the evangelical preachers, who tried to revive the [[Religious fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] Christianity of the early Pilgrim fathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=UUA: History: Hosea Ballou|url=http://uudb.org/articles/hoseaballou.html|publisher=Unitarian Universalist History and Heritage Society|accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Universalism===
{{Main article|Universalism|Christian Universalism}}
Universalists claim a long history, beginning with [[Origen]] and [[Gregory of Nyssa]], though some modern scholars question whether either of these church fathers taught the defining doctrine of Universalism ([[universal salvation]]).&lt;ref&gt;Westminster Origen Handbook&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Morwenna Ludlow|Ludlow, Morwenna]]. (2000). "Universal Salvation: Eschatology in the thought of Gregory of Nyssa and Karl Rahner". New York; Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Darwell. (1903). ''Outline of Christian Dogma''. p 341 New York: Longmans, Green &amp; Co.

This core doctrine asserts that through Christ every single human soul shall be saved, leading to the "restitution of all things" ([[apocatastasis]]). In 1793, Universalism emerged as a particular denomination of Christianity in the United States, eventually called the [[Universalist Church of America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uua.org/visitors/ourhistory/6904.shtml]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204070253/http://www.uua.org/visitors/ourhistory/6904.shtml |date=February 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early American advocates of [[Universal Salvation]] such as [[Elhanan Winchester]], [[Hosea Ballou]] and [[John Murray (minister)|John Murray]] taught that all souls would achieve salvation, sometimes after a period resembling [[purgatory]].&lt;ref&gt;William Latta McCalla ''Discussion of universalism'' 1825 Page 105 "THIRD UNIVERSALIST ARGUMENT. As it is a fact that many Universalists advocate a sort of purgatory, a concise notice will be taken of those texts which are erroneously thought to countenance that doctrine."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christian universalism]] denies the doctrine of everlasting [[damnation]], and proclaims belief in an entirely loving [[God in Christianity|God]] who will ultimately [[Salvation#Redemption|redeem]] all human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://100yearsagotoday.wordpress.com/2012/07/21/church-lays-corner-stone-in-new-hampshire/|title=Church Lays Corner Stone In New Hampshire|date=21 July 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/growinguuism/uu-history|title=Google Sites|website=sites.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unitarianism===
{{Main article|Unitarianism}}
Historically, various forms of '''[[Nontrinitarianism]]''' have appeared within Christianity. The term may refer to any belief about the nature of [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] that affirms [[God]] as a singular entity and rejects the doctrine of the [[Trinity]], as affirmed by the [[Nicene Creed|mainstream Christianity]]: a consensus of Christian bishops at the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325. Nontrinitarianism was especially prevalent during the theological turmoils of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. A Spanish physician, [[Michael Servetus]], studied the Bible and concluded that the concept of the Trinity, as traditionally conceived, was not biblical. His books ''On the Errors of the Trinity'' and ''Christianismi Restitutio'' caused much uproar. Servetus was eventually arrested, convicted of heresy, and burned at the stake in [[Geneva]] in 1553.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miguelservet.org/servetus/biography.htm |title=Michael Servetus Institute; Times that Servetus lived |publisher=Miguelservet.org |accessdate=2011-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''''Unitarian''''' entered the English language via [[Henry Hedworth]], who applied it to the teachings of [[Laelio Sozzini]] and the Polish [[Socinians]]. Unitarian churches were formally established in [[Transylvania]] and [[Poland]] (by the [[Socinianism|Socinians]]) in the second half of the 16th Century.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;Harris, MW. Unitarian Universalist Origins: Our Historic Faith&lt;/ref&gt; There, the first doctrines of religious freedom in Europe were established (in the course of several diets between 1557 and 1568, see [[Edict of Torda]]) under the jurisdiction of [[John Sigismund Zápolya|John Sigismund]], king of Hungary and Prince of Transylvania, the only Unitarian monarch. The early Unitarian church not only rejected the Trinity, but also the [[pre-existence of Christ]] as well as, in many cases, [[predestination]] and [[original sin]] as put forward by [[Augustine of Hippo]], and the [[substitutionary atonement]] of Christ developed by [[Anselm of Canterbury]] and John Calvin. There were several different forms of [[Christology]] in the beginnings of the Unitarian movement; ultimately, the dominant Christology became [[psilanthropism]]: that Jesus was a man, but one with a unique relationship to God.

====Britain====
{{main article|History of Unitarianism}}
Influenced by the teachings of the Polish [[Socinians]], [[Samuel Clarke]] (1675–1729) revised the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'', removing the Trinitarian [[Nicene Creed]] and references to [[divinity of Jesus|Jesus as God]].&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanunitarian.org/fisherhistory.htm |title=Chris Fisher, '&amp;#39;A Brief History of Unitarian Christianity'&amp;#39;, retrieved July 18, 2008 |publisher=Americanunitarian.org |accessdate=2011-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theophilus Lindsey]] also revised the ''Book of Common Prayer'' to allow a more tolerant, free Unitarian interpretation.  Neither cleric was charged under the [[Blasphemy Act 1697]] that made it an "offense for any person, educated in or having made profession of the Christian religion, by writing, preaching, teaching or advised speaking, to deny the [[Holy Trinity]]".  The [[Act of Toleration 1689|Act of Toleration]] (1689) gave relief to [[English Dissenters]], but excluded Unitarians.  The efforts of Clarke and Lindsey met with substantial criticism from the more conservative clergy and laity of the [[Church of England]].  In response, in 1774, Lindsey applied for registration of the [[Essex Street Chapel|Essex House]] as a "Dissenting place of worship" with the assistance of [[barrister]] [[John Lee (Attorney-General)|John Lee]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|title=1959_StoryEssexHall.pdf|accessdate=2017-12-25|first=Mortimer|last=Rowe|location=London|publisher=Lindsey Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the Sunday following the registration—April 17, 1774—the first true Unitarian congregation discreetly convened in the provisional Essex Street Chapel.  In attendance were Lee, [[Joseph Priestley]] and the agent of the Massachusetts Colony, [[Benjamin Franklin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Once laity and clergy relaxed their vehement opposition to the [[Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813]], which finally allowed for protections of dissenting religions, the [[British and Foreign Unitarian Association]] was founded in 1825.

====United States====
{{main article|History of Unitarianism}}
In the United States, the Unitarian movement began primarily in the [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational]] [[parish]] churches of [[New England]], which were part of the [[state church]] of Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Erasmus Lauer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2J8TAAAAYAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Church and state in New England''] (Johns Hopkins Press, 1892) p. 105. Retrieved September 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; These churches, whose buildings may still be seen today in many New England town squares, trace their roots to the division of the [[Puritan]] colonies into parishes for the administration of their religious needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uunashua.org/sermons/sampson.shtml Bob Sampson, Seventy-three Years In the Unitarian-Universalist Church of Nashua, July 16, 2006] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306013146/http://uunashua.org/sermons/sampson.shtml |date=March 6, 2016 }}. Retrieved July 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 18th century, conflict grew within some of these churches between Unitarian and Trinitarian factions. In 1805, Unitarians gained key faculty positions at [[Harvard University#Religion and philosophy|Harvard]]. In 1819 [[William Ellery Channing]] preached the [[ordination]] sermon for [[Jared Sparks]] in [[Baltimore]], outlining the Unitarian position. The [[American Unitarian Association]] was founded as a separate denomination in 1825.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the 19th century, under the influence of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] (who had been a Unitarian minister)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/UIA%20Online/97emerson.html Ralph Waldo Emerson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928060401/http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/UIA%20Online/97emerson.html |date=2012-09-28 }}. Harvardsquarelibrary.org.

===Integration 1825–1961===
After the [[Schism (religion)|schism]] in the Congregational Churches resulting in the foundation of the American Unitarian Association, some of those churches remained within the Congregational fold and became member congregations of the Congregational organization (later the [[United Church of Christ]]), while others voted to become Unitarian. Some of the latter eventually became part of the [[Unitarian Universalist Association|UUA]] during a consolidation of the Unitarian and Universalist churches. Universalist churches in contrast followed a different path, having begun as independent congregations beyond the bounds of the established [[Puritan]] churches entirely. Today, the UUA and the United Church of Christ cooperate jointly on [[social justice]] initiatives such as the Sexuality Education Advocacy Training project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.uua.org/reproductive/education/index.shtml |title= Comprehensive Sexuality Education | accessdate = 2011-09-24 |date= August 23, 2011 |work= Social Justice » Reproductive Justice |publisher= Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations |quote= The Unitarian Universalist Association has long been an advocate of age-appropriate, medically accurate, comprehensive sexuality education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, the [[American Unitarian Association]] (AUA) was consolidated with the [[Universalist Church of America]] (UCA), thus forming the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]].&lt;ref name="Sias"&gt;{{Citation | last = Sias | first = John | publisher = UU Nashua | format = PDF | url = http://www.uunashua.org/100q/100questions.pdf | title = 100 Questions that Non-Unitarians Ask About Unitarian Universalism}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the [[Canadian Unitarian Council]] (CUC) formed.&lt;ref name="CUCHistory"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.cuc.ca/governance/archival/History.htm | title = Accord History | publisher = CUC | place = [[Canada|CA]] | accessdate = 2010-09-29 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100920114313/http://cuc.ca/governance/archival/History.htm | archivedate = 2010-09-20 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) was also given corporate status in May 1961 under special acts of legislature of the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] and the [[State of New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.uua.org/uuagovernance/bylaws |title= BYLAWS AND RULES | accessdate = 2017-07-05  |work= Governance and Management |publisher= Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations |quote= Unitarian Universalist Association was given corporate status in May 1961 under special acts of legislature of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the State of New York.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the Canadian Unitarian Council and Unitarian Universalist Association dissolved their financial accord, although they continue to cooperate.&lt;ref name = "CUCHistory" /&gt; The CUC had come into being at Meadville in 1961.  However the continual decline of denominational churches and almost complete failure of the Universalist movement in Canada, had caused the creation of the Council to prompt a plan to merge with the UUA.  Opposition to Liberal religious freedom relaxed, so that by 2002 it was agreed to increase autonomy and funding.  The amalgamation proved troublesome for the Canadians, in a small minority, and largely ignored with only 45 congregations and 5,200 members, the Americans were insensitive to cultural differences.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, pp.90-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belief, covenant, and scripture==
Unitarian Universalists practice a [[non-creedal]] religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |title=Beliefs &amp; Principles
 |url=https://www.uua.org/beliefs/what-we-believe
 |access-date=2017-12-05
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, their individual beliefs are diverse, and their attitude toward each other's beliefs and traditions is one of tolerance and acceptance. Rather than a focus on doctrine or belief, Unitarian Universalists find primary significance in their shared agreement, or covenant: member congregations agree to "affirm and promote" the Seven Principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Six Sources===
Unitarian Universalists place emphasis on spiritual growth and development. The official statement of Unitarian Universalist principles describes the "sources" upon which current practice is based:&lt;ref name=sources/&gt;{{quotation|
* Direct experience of that transcending mystery and wonder, affirmed in all cultures, which moves us to a renewal of the spirit and an openness to the forces which create and uphold life;
* Words and deeds of prophetic people which challenge us to confront powers and structures of evil with justice, compassion, and the transforming power of love;
* Wisdom from the [[Major religious groups|world's religions]] which inspires us in our ethical and spiritual life;
* [[Jewish]] and [[Christian]] teachings which call us to respond to God's love by loving our neighbors as ourselves;
* [[Humanism|Humanist]] teachings which counsel us to heed the guidance of reason and the results of science, and warn us against idolatries of the mind and spirit.
* Spiritual teachings of [[Earth religion|earth-centered traditions]] which celebrate the sacred circle of life and instruct us to live in harmony with the rhythms of nature.}}

Unitarian Universalist principles and purposes have been modified over time to manifest a broader acceptance of beliefs and traditions among the membership. The seventh Principle (adopted in 1985), "Respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part", and a sixth Source (adopted in 1995), "Spiritual teachings of earth-centered traditions which celebrate the sacred circle of life and instruct us to live in harmony with the rhythms of nature" were added to explicitly include members with [[Modern Paganism|neopagan]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], and [[Pantheism|pantheist]] spiritualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Approach to sacred writings===
Both Unitarianism and Universalism were originally Christian denominations; they still reference Jewish and Christian texts. Today, the Unitarian Universalist approach to the [[Bible|Christian Bible]], [[Tanakh|Hebrew Scriptures]], and other sacred works is presented by the UUA:
{{quotation|While Unitarianism and Universalism both have roots in the Protestant Christian tradition, where the Bible is the sacred text, we now look to additional sources for religious and moral inspiration…. We celebrate the spiritual insights of the world’s religions, recognizing wisdom in many scriptures.

When we read scripture in worship, whether it is the [[Bible]], the [[Dhammapada]], or the [[Tao Te-Ching]], we interpret it as a product of its time and its place,…not to be interpreted narrowly or oppressively…&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;S&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;cripture is never the only word, or the final word.

From the beginning we have trusted in the human capacity to use reason and draw conclusions about religion…&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;E&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;ach of us ultimately chooses what is sacred to us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |title=Sacred texts in Unitarian Universalism
 |url=https://www.uua.org/beliefs/what-we-believe/sacred-texts
 |access-date=2017-12-05
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In short, Unitarian Universalists regard the texts of the world's religions as works of people, worthy of respect, with the intention that people from all religions or spiritual backgrounds live peaceably with one another.

==Worship and practice==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2011}}
===Diversity of practices===
The Unitarian belief that reason, and not creed, defines the search for truth, and the Universalist belief that God embraces all people equally has led to the current Unitarian Universalist belief that truth and spiritual meaning can be found in all faiths. This is reflected in the wide array of spiritual practices found among Unitarian Universalists today. Many Unitarian Universalist congregations include Buddhist-style meditation groups, Jewish [[Passover Seder|Seder]], [[Yom Kippur]] and Passover dinners, ''[[iftaar]]'' meals (marking the breaking of Ramadan fast for Muslims), and Christmas Eve/[[Winter Solstice#Observances|Winter Solstice]] services. Children's and youth's religious education classes teach about the divinity of the world and the sanctity of world religions. One of its more popular curricula, Neighboring Faiths (formerly Church Across the Street), takes middle and high school participants to visit the places of worship of many faith traditions including a [[Hindu]] temple, a [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] or [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] synagogue, and a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] church.

There is great variety among Unitarian Universalist congregations, with some favoring particular religious beliefs or forms of worship over others, with many more home to an eclectic mix of beliefs. Regardless of their orientation, most congregations are fairly open to differing beliefs, though not always with various faith traditions represented to the same degree.

===Diversity of congregations===
There is a wide variety in how congregations conceive of themselves, calling themselves "churches", "societies", "fellowships", "congregations", or eschew the use of any particular descriptor (e.g. "[http://www.uusanmateo.org Unitarian Universalists of San Mateo]"). Whether a congregation is a 'fellowship' or a 'church' sometimes hinges on whether it is led by one (or more) minister(s): those without ministers being fellowships, those with ministers being churches. Many use the name "Unitarian Universalist", (and a few "Universalist Unitarian"), having gradually adopted this formulation since consolidation in 1961. Others use names that reflect their historic roots by keeping the historical designation "Unitarian" or "Universalist" (e.g. "[[First_Unitarian_Church_(Milwaukee,_Wisconsin)|First Unitarian Church]]"). A few congregations use neither (e.g. [[Unity Temple]]). For some congregations, the name can be a clue to their theological orientation. For others, avoidance of the word "church" indicates a desire to distance itself from traditional Christian theology. Sometimes the use of another term may simply indicate a congregation's lay-led or relatively new status. However, some Unitarian Universalist congregations have grown to appreciate alternative terms such as ''fellowship'' and retained them even though they have grown much larger or lost features sometimes associated with their use (such as, in the case of fellowships, a traditionally lay-led worship model).&lt;ref&gt;See for examples: [http://www.uufellowship.org Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Northern Westchester] and [http://www.uuathensga.org/ Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Athens].&lt;/ref&gt;

Also of note is that there are many more people who identify as Unitarian Universalist on surveys than those who attend Unitarian Universalist congregations (by a factor of four in a recent survey),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adherents.com/rel_USA.html Largest Religious Groups in the United States of America], Adherents.com&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting those who have never joined (and lapsed members) but nonetheless consider themselves part of the Unitarian Universalist movement.

===Elevator speeches===
In 2004, ''UU World'' magazine asked for contributions of "[[elevator pitch|elevator speeches]]" explaining Unitarian Universalism.&lt;ref&gt;''UU World Magazine''. Unitarian Universalist Association. July/August 2004. http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4071/is_200407/ai_n9458199/{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are short speeches that could be made in the course of an elevator ride to those who knew nothing of the religion. Here are examples of the speeches submitted:

{{quote | In Unitarian Universalist congregations, we gather in community to support our individual spiritual journeys. We trust that openness to one another's experiences will enhance our understanding of our own links with the divine, with our history, and with one another. | Jonalu Johnstone, Oklahoma City, OK&lt;ref name=affirmations&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote | Most Unitarian Universalists believe that nobody has a monopoly on all truth, or ultimate proof of the truth of everything in any one belief.  Therefore, one's own truth is unprovable, as is that of others. Consequently, we should respect the beliefs of others, as well as their right to hold those beliefs. Conversely, we expect that others should respect our right to our own beliefs. Several UU's then, would likely hold as many different beliefs. Other beliefs they may hold in common are a respect for others, for nature, and for common decency, leading to a particular caring for the poor, the weak and the downtrodden. As a result, issues of justice, including social justice are held in common among most. | Gene Douglas, Harrah, OK&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uuduluth.org/newsletters/nov06news.html |title=Dear Ones |accessdate=2007-02-24 |author=Karen Johnson Gustafson |date=November 2006 |work=Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Duluth Newsletter |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929140837/http://www.uuduluth.org/newsletters/nov06news.html |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Worship and ritual==
As in theology, Unitarian Universalist [[worship]] and [[ritual]] are often a combination of elements derived from other faith traditions alongside original practices and symbols. In form, church services might be difficult to distinguish from those of a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] church, but they vary widely among congregations.&lt;ref name="Sias"/&gt;

===Symbols===
The most common symbol of Unitarian Universalism is the [[flaming chalice]], often framed by two overlapping rings that many interpret as representing Unitarianism and Universalism (the symbol has no official interpretation). The chalice itself has long been a symbol of liberal religion, and indeed liberal Christianity (the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Disciples of Christ]] also use a chalice as their denomination symbol&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.disciples.org/AboutTheDisciples/TheChalice/tabid/70/Default.aspx

 |archivedate=January 12, 2012 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The flaming chalice was initially the logo of the Unitarian Service Committee during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. It was created by Austrian artist Hans Deutsch, inspired by "the kind of chalice which the Greeks and Romans put on their altars. The holy oil burning in it is a symbol of helpfulness and sacrifice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = 2007-02-24
| author = Adapted from the pamphlet "The Flaming Chalice" by Daniel D. Hotchkiss
| publisher = [[Unitarian Universalist Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, other interpretations have been suggested, such as the chalice used by the followers of Czech [[Jan Hus]], which was supposedly reverential of Eastern Orthodox traditions; although Hus's early National Church was intrinsically an evangelical Protestant.  In some agnostic historiographies the flaming chalice displayed a vague resemblance to a cross in some stylized representations, relying on the sepulchral traditions of the Hospitallers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mark W.|last=Harris|title=The A to Z of Unitarian Universalism| publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=London|accessdate=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Many Unitarian Universalist congregations light a chalice at the beginning of worship services.  Other symbols include an [[Christian cross variants#Modern innovations|off-center cross within a circle]] (a Universalist symbol associated with the Humiliati movement in the 1950s, a group of reformist, liturgically minded clergy seeking to revive Universalism).

Other symbols include a pair of open hands releasing a [[dove]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Services of worship===
[[File:UM 1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[First Unitarian Society of Madison|Unitarian Meeting House]] designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Shorewood Hills, Wisconsin]].]]
Religious services are usually held on Sundays and most closely resemble the form and format of Protestant worship in the Reformed tradition.&lt;ref name="Sias"/&gt; Services at a vast majority of congregations follow a structure that focuses on a sermon or presentation by a minister, a lay leader of the congregation, or an invited speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Since Unitarian Universalists do not recognize a particular text or set of texts as primary or inherently superior, inspiration can be found in many different religious or cultural texts as well as the personal experiences of the minister.

The service also includes hymn-singing, accompanied by organ, piano, or other available instruments, and possibly led by a song leader or choir. The most recent worship songbook published by the denomination, ''Singing the Journey''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=1-55896-499-1|title=Singing the Journey}}&lt;/ref&gt; contains 75 songs and is a supplement to the older ''Singing the Living Tradition'' which contains readings as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=1-55896-260-3|title=Singing the Living Tradition}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hymns typically sung in Unitarian Universalist services come from a variety of sources—traditional [[hymn tune]]s with new or adapted lyrics, spirituals, folk songs from various cultures, or original compositions by Unitarian Universalist musicians are just a few. Instrumental music is also a common feature of the typical worship service, including preludes, offertory music, postludes, or music for contemplation.

Pastoral elements of the service may include a time for sharing Joys and Sorrows/Concerns, where individuals in the congregation are invited to [[Ceremonial use of lights|light a candle]] or say a few words about important events in their personal lives. Many also include a time of [[meditation]] or [[prayer]], led by the minister or service leader, both spoken and silent. Responsive readings and stories for children are also typical. Many congregations also allow for a time at the end of the service, called "talk back", where members of the congregation can respond to the sermon with their own insights and questions, or even disagree with the viewpoint expressed by the minister or invited speaker.

Many Unitarian Universalist congregations no longer observe the Christian symbols of [[baptism]], [[Eucharist|communion]], or [[confirmation]], at least in their traditional forms or under their traditional names. Congregations that continue these practices under their more traditional names are often [[federated congregation|federated church]]es or members of the Council of Christian Churches within the Unitarian Universalist Association (CCCUUA), or may have active chapters associated with the [[Unitarian Universalist Christian Fellowship]] or similar covenant groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liveoakuu.org/christian04.htm Christians 2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108233643/http://www.liveoakuu.org/christian04.htm |date=January 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Child dedications" often replace more traditional infant baptisms (though it should be noted that such "dedications" are sometimes practiced even in "orthodox" Christian communities that do not baptize infants for theological reasons). Annual celebrations of [[Water Communion]] and [[Flower Communion]] may replace or supplement Christian-style communion (though many pluralist and Christian-oriented congregations may celebrate or otherwise make provisions for communion on Christian holy days).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

After they have completed exploring their spiritual beliefs, they write a speech about it which they then personally deliver to the congregation.

==Politics==

===Historical politics of Unitarians and Universalists===
{{main article|Unitarianism}}
{{main article|Universalist Church of America}}
In the 19th century, Unitarians and Universalists were active in [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]], the [[women's movement]], the [[temperance movement in the United States|temperance movement]], and other [[social reform]] movements. The 
[[Rochester Women's Rights Convention of 1848|second women's rights convention]] was held at the [[First Unitarian Church of Rochester|First Unitarian Church of Rochester, New York]]. Additionally, four [[President of the United States|Presidents of the United States]] were Unitarians: [[John Adams]], [[John Quincy Adams]], [[Millard Fillmore]], and [[William Howard Taft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pewforum.org/The-Religious-Affiliations-of-US-Presidents.aspx | title=The Religious Affiliations of U.S. Presidents | publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life | date=January 15, 2009 | accessdate=2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics of Unitarian Universalists===
[[File:Civil marriage is a civil right.JPG|right|thumb|upright=1.15|A Unitarian Assembly in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstulou.org/ |title=First Unitarian Church of Louisville |publisher=Firstulou.org |accessdate=2011-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Historically, Unitarian Universalists have often been active in political causes, notably the [[civil rights movement]],&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Amanda, [http://www.gainformer.com/files/Unitarian%20Universalists.htm Unitarian Universalist Church Has Rich Civil Rights History]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[LGBT social movements|LGBT rights movement]],&lt;ref&gt;UUA [https://www.uua.org/lgbtq/witness/policy "Unitarian Universalist Policy and LGBTQ Issues"]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[social justice]] movement, and the [[feminist movement]].

[[Susan B. Anthony]], a Unitarian and [[Quaker]], was extremely influential in the women's [[suffrage]] movement. Unitarian Universalists and Quakers still share many principles. It is therefore common to see Unitarian Universalists and Quakers working together.

Unitarian Universalists were and are still very involved in the fight to end [[racism]] in the United States. [[John Haynes Holmes]], a Unitarian minister and social activist at The Community Church of New York—Unitarian Universalist were among the founders of both the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) in 1909 and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), chairing the latter for a time. [[James J. Reeb]], a minister at [[All Souls Church, Unitarian (Washington, D.C.)|All Souls Church, Unitarian]], in [[Washington, D.C.]] and a member of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]], was clubbed in [[Selma, Alabama]] on March 8, 1965, and died two days later of massive head trauma. Two weeks after his death, [[Viola Liuzzo]], a Unitarian Universalist civil rights activist, was murdered by white supremacists after her participation in the protest march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. The [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] for voting rights are best known for [[Bloody Sunday (1965)|Bloody Sunday]], which refers to March 7, 1965, the most violent of the three marches.

The past head of the Unitarian Universalist Association 2001–2009, [[William G. Sinkford]], is [[African-American]], making Unitarian Universalism one of the first traditionally white denominations to be headed by a member of a racial minority.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, Bill; 11 April 2008; "Leading the Unitarian Universalist Association, a faith without a creed"; ''St. Petersburg Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Modern liberalism in the United States|political liberals]] make up a clear majority of Unitarian Universalists, the movement aspires to diversity, and officially welcomes congregants regardless of their political views. Politically conservative Unitarian Universalists point out that neither religious liberalism nor the Principles and Purposes of the UUA require liberal politics. Like the beliefs of Unitarian Universalists, politics are decided by individuals, not by congregations or the denomination.

Several congregations have undertaken a series of organizational, procedural and practical steps to become acknowledged as a "[[Unitarian Universalism and LGBT topics#Welcoming Congregation|Welcoming Congregation]]": a congregation which has taken specific steps to welcome and integrate gay, lesbian, bisexual &amp; transgender (LGBT) members. Unitarian Universalist ministers perform [[same-sex unions]] and now [[same-sex marriages]] where legal (and sometimes when not, as a form of civil protest). On June 29, 1984, the Unitarian Universalists became the first major church "to approve religious blessings on homosexual unions."&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E0DB1539F93AA15755C0A962948260 "Unitarians Endorse Homosexual Marriages"], UPI, ''The New York Times'', 29 June 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Unitarian Universalists have been in the forefront of the work to make same-sex marriages legal in their local states and provinces, as well as on the national level. Gay men, bisexuals, and lesbians are also regularly [[ordained]] as ministers, and a number of gay, bisexual, and lesbian ministers have, themselves, now become legally married to their partners. In May 2004, [[Arlington Street Church (Boston)|Arlington Street Church]], in Boston, Massachusetts, was the site of the first state-sanctioned same-sex marriage in the United States. The official stance of the UUA is for the legalization of same-sex marriage—"Standing on the Side of Love". In 2004 UU minister Debra Haffner of [[The Religious Institute on Sexual Morality, Justice, and Healing]] published ''An Open Letter on Religious Leaders on Marriage Equality'' to affirm same-sex marriage from a multi-faith perspective. In December 2009, Washington, D.C. Mayor [[Adrian Fenty]] signed the bill to legalize same-sex marriage for the [[District of Columbia]] in [[All Souls Church, Unitarian (Washington, D.C.)]]

[[Unitarian Universalists for Polyamory Awareness]] engages Unitarian Universalist ministers and other leaders to educate them on [[polyamory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uupa.org|title=UUPA website }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2015 [[General Assembly (Unitarian Universalist Association)|UUA General Assembly]], the Association's non-discrimination rule was amended to include the category of "family and relationship structures";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uua.org/uuagovernance/bylaws/ruleii/section-c-23-non-discrimination |title=Unitarian Universalist Association: Rule II, Section C-2.3.: Non-discrimination |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518103753/http://www.uua.org/uuagovernance/bylaws/ruleii/section-c-23-non-discrimination |archivedate=2015-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the UUA has yet to take specific follow-up action on this, however.

Many congregations are heavily involved in projects and efforts aimed at supporting environmental causes and [[sustainability]]. These are often termed "seventh principle" activities because of the seventh principle quoted above.

==Controversies==

===External===

====Lack of formal creed====
The lack of formal creed has been a cause for criticism among some who argue that Unitarian Universalism is thus without religious content.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} In May 2004, [[Texas]] [[Comptroller]] [[Carole Keeton Strayhorn]] ruled that Unitarian Universalism was not a "religion" because it "does not have one system of belief", and stripped the Red River Unitarian Universalist Church in [[Denison, Texas]], of its tax-exempt status. However, within weeks, Strayhorn reversed her decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.window.state.tx.us/news/40524church.html |title=News Release From Carole Keeton Strayhorn |publisher=Window.state.tx.us |date=2004-05-24 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119143945/http://www.window.state.tx.us/news/40524church.html |archivedate=January 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Confusion with other groups====
There are separate movements and organizations who hold to classical Unitarian or [[Christian universalist]] Christian theology and neither belong to the Unitarian Universalist Association nor consider themselves Unitarian Universalists. The [[American Unitarian Conference]] and the [[Christian Universalist Association]] are the two most significant organizations representing these theological beliefs today. Christians who hold these beliefs tend to consider themselves the true Unitarians or Universalists and heirs of the theological legacy of the original [[American Unitarian Association]] or [[Universalist Church of America]], and they do not wish to be confused with Unitarian Universalists. The [[Unity Church]] is another denomination that is often confused with Unitarian Universalism.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.americanunitarian.org/voicearticle.htm "Why the American Unitarian Conference Had to Be Formed"] and [http://www.christianuniversalist.org/articles/unitarian.html "What Is the Difference between Christian Universalism and Unitarian Universalism?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal===

====Language of reverence====
During the presidency of the William Sinkford, debate within the Unitarian Universalist movement has roiled over his call to return to or create an authentic Unitarian Universalist "language of reverence." Sinkford has suggested that Unitarian Universalists have abandoned traditional religious language, thereby abandoning words with potential power to others who will then dictate their meanings in the public sphere. He has suggested that Unitarian Universalists regain their proper seat at the interfaith table by making this language their own. Others have reacted to this call by believing it to be part of an effort to return Unitarian Universalist congregations to more orthodox Christian worship patterns. Sinkford has denied this, citing the words of Unitarian Universalist humanists as examples of what he means by the "language of reverence." The growth of humanism in Unitarianism was determined by a desire to raise the profile to a universal audience, educating atheists and agnostics in biblical literacy among the wider congregation of Unitarian Universalists, many of whom were born into families that lacked the rigour of a moral catechism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uuworld.org/articles/need-language-reverence|title=Human reverence: The language of reverence is the language of humanity|date=2006-07-31|first=Kendyl L.R.|last=Gibbons|publisher=UU World: Liberal religion and life|accessdate=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The debate included the publication of a book by the UUA's [[Beacon Press]] written by former UUA President John Buehrens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Buehrens |first=John A. |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/story/132/story_13272_1.html |title=Past Unitarian Universalist Association President John A. Buehrens on Why Even Humanists Should Read the Bible |publisher=Beliefnet.com |accessdate=2011-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is titled ''Understanding the Bible: An Introduction for Skeptics, Seekers, and Religious Liberals''&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0-8070-1053-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is meant as a kind of handbook to be read alongside the Bible. It provides interpretative strategies, so that Unitarian Universalists (among others) might be able to engage in public debate about what the Bible says from a liberal religious perspective, rather than relinquishing to religious conservatives, and other more literal interpretations, all control over the book's contents and significance in matters of public and civic import. Also an important work by Buehrens, along with Forrest Church, is ''A Chosen Faith: An Introduction to Unitarian Universalism'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0-8070-1617-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the authors explore the many sources of the living tradition of their chosen faith.

====Borrowing from other religions====
The "borrowing" of religious rituals from other faith traditions by Unitarian Universalists was discussed at the Unitarian Universalist General Assembly in 2001 during a seminar titled "Cultural Appropriation: Reckless Borrowing or Appropriate Cultural Sharing" by the Religious Education Dept, UUA.&lt;ref name="CulturApp"&gt;[http://www.uua.org/ga/ga01/2038.html "Cultural Appropriation: Reckless Borrowing or Appropriate Cultural Sharing"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906102017/http://www.uua.org/ga/ga01/2038.html |date=2008-09-06 }} Reported for the Web by Dwight Ernest, July 24, 2001, Unitarian Universalist Association&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uua.org/leaders/leaderslibrary/leaderslibrary/interconnections/45522.shtml "When Worship Becomes Cultural Misappropriation"], September 15, 2007, UU Interconnections&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular discussion was the borrowing rituals and practices that are sacred to specific tribes or using spiritual practices without real context. Danielle Di Bona said:

{{Quotation|When UUs pick and choose from these things, it trivializes their spiritual practices. The specificity [of their use] is so complete, that visiting Native Americans do not participate in another tribe's rituals, and to do so would be perceived as foolish. I would not even practice the rituals of my own tribe, because I am not an elder or spiritual leader. If this is true of her own people, then the use of these things by others who share no cultural context is seen not only as particularly foolish and inappropriate.

Not all of this usage is inappropriate, though. Some taped music, written prayers, that kind of thing, might be all right, but it's not right to fool around with it. If it's not in context, if the user is not walking with us, if the user is not part of our struggle, then it is presumptuous.&lt;ref name="CulturApp"/&gt;}}

* [[Unitarian Universalists for Polyamory Awareness]] is an association of Unitarian Universalists who support officially recognizing [[polyamory]] as a valid lifestyle.
* [[Unitarian Universalist Service Committee]] is a [[nonsectarian]] organization devoted to promoting human rights and social justice worldwide.
* [http://huumanists.org Unitarian Universalist Humanist Association] is an association of Unitarian Universalists who define themselves as Humanists.
* [[Young Religious Unitarian Universalists]] (YRUU) is a term used within the UUA and CUC. YRUU was an organization at the North American continental level primarily run by youth, ranging in age from 14 to 20, with mentoring adult partners. The North American continental organization of YRUU ended in 2008, but the term is still used by certain active youth groups and conferences at the congregational and regional/district levels. It was created in 1981 and 1982, at two conferences, Common Ground 1 &amp; 2. Common Ground was called to form a UUA-controlled replacement for [[Liberal Religious Youth]] (LRY), the Unitarian Universalist youth organization that preceded YRUU. LRY was dissolved by the UUA, and its assets absorbed by it.

In modern Yezidi belief there is no Hell, as it was extinguished by the weeping of a diseased child, who cried into a yellow (asfar) jar for seven years, and this was emptied over the fire of Hell and extinguished them. This child is variously named Abrik Shautha and Ibrik al-Asfar (the Yellow). A variant of the legend says it was the weeping of Shaitan during his seven thousand years of exile in Hell that extinguished the fires. With reference to these legends it has been suggested that Melak Ta'us is a memory of Ta'uz, said to be a form of the very ancient Babylonian hero-god Tammuz, and it is to be remembered that weeping for the terrible legendary sufferings in the seven forms of death to which he was subjected is a prominent feature in the ceremonies once celebrated in connection with Tammuz.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
[[File:Yezidischld.JPG|thumb|Yazidi leaders and [[Chaldean Christians|Chaldean]] clergymen meeting in [[Mesopotamia]], 19th century]]
Historically, the Yazidis lived primarily in communities located in present-day Iraq, Turkey, and Syria and also had significant numbers in Armenia, Georgia, and Iran. However, events since the end of the 20th century have resulted in considerable demographic shift in these areas as well as mass emigration.&lt;ref name=Megalommatis /&gt; As a result, population estimates are unclear in many regions, and estimates of the size of the total population vary.&lt;ref name="iranica" /&gt;

===Iraq===
The majority of the Yazidi population lives in Iraq, where they make up an important minority community.&lt;ref name="iranica" /&gt; Estimates of the size of these communities vary significantly, between 70,000 and 500,000. They are particularly concentrated in northern Iraq in the [[Nineveh Province]]. The two biggest communities are in [[Al-Shikhan|Shekhan]], northeast of [[Mosul]] and in [[Sinjar]], at the Syrian border {{convert|80|km}} west of Mosul. In Shekhan is the shrine of [[Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir]] at [[Lalish]]. In the early 1900s most of the settled population of the [[Western Desert (Iraq)|Western Desert]] were Yazidi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Question of the Frontier Between Turkey and Iraq|url=http://biblio-archive.unog.ch/Dateien/CouncilMSD/C-400-M-147-1925-VII_BI.pdf|publisher=League of Nations|location=Geneva|page=49|date=20 August 1925|quote=they are ... are almost the only settled population in the Western desert.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 20th century, the Shekhan community struggled for dominance with the more conservative Sinjar community.&lt;ref name="iranica" /&gt; The demographic profile has probably changed considerably since the beginning of the [[Iraq War]] in 2003 and the fall of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s government.&lt;ref name="iranica" /&gt;

According to the [[Human Rights Watch]], Yazidis were under the [[Arabisation]] process of Saddam Hussein between 1970 and 2003. In 2009, some Yazidis who had previously lived under the Arabisation process of Saddam Hussein complained about the political tactics of the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]] that were intended to make Yazidis identify themselves as Kurds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = On Vulnerable Ground|url = https://www.hrw.org/report/2009/11/10/vulnerable-ground/violence-against-minority-communities-nineveh-provinces-disputed|website = Human Rights Watch|access-date = 2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Iraq's Dysfunctional Democracy|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=U1VNI3rsOT8C|publisher = ABC-CLIO|date = 2011-09-30|isbn = 978-0-313-39801-8|language = en|first = David|last = Ghanim}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report from [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW), in 2009, declares that to incorporate [[Disputed territories of Northern Iraq|disputed territories in northern Iraq]]—particularly the Nineveh province—into the Kurdish region, the KDP authorities had used KRG's political and economical resources to make Yazidis identify themselves as Kurds.

{{Main|Yazidis in Georgia}}
The Yazidi population in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] has been dwindling since the 1990s, mostly due to economic migration to Russia and the West. According to a census carried out in 1989, there were over 30,000 Yazidis in Georgia; according to the 2002 census, however, only around 18,000 Yazidis remained in Georgia. However, by other estimates, the community fell from around 30,000 people to fewer than 5,000 during the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Megalommatis /&gt; Today they number as little 6,000 by some estimates, including recent refugees from [[Sinjar]] in Iraq, who fled to Georgia following [[Persecution of Yazidis by ISIL|persecution by ISIL]].&lt;ref name="DFWatch"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dfwatch.net/yazidi-temple-third-in-the-world-opened-in-tbilisi-36650|title=Yazidi temple, third in the world, opened in Tbilisi|work=DFWatch|date=2015-06-19|access-date=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 June 2015, Yazidis celebrated the opening of a temple and a cultural centre named after Sultan Ezid in [[Varketili]], a suburb of [[Tbilisi]].

According to the 2011 census, there are 35,272 Yazidis in Armenia, making them Armenia's largest ethnic minority group.&lt;ref name=2011census&gt;{{cite web |title=2011 Armenian census |publisher=[[National Statistical Service of the Republic of Armenia|National Statistical Service]] |url=http://armstat.am/file/article/sv_03_13a_520.pdf |format=PDF |year=2011 |access-date=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years earlier, in the 2001 census, 40,620 Yazidis were registered in Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=De Jure Population (Urban, Rural) by Age and Ethnicity |publisher=[[National Statistical Service of the Republic of Armenia|National Statistical Service]] |url=http://docs.armstat.am/census/pdfs/51.pdf |format=PDF |year=2001 |access-date=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They form majority in [[Armavir province]] of Armenia. Media have estimated the number of Yazidis in Armenia to be between 30,000 and 50,000. Most of them are the descendants of refugees who fled to Armenia in order to escape the persecution that they had previously suffered during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], including a wave of persecution which occurred during the [[Armenian Genocide]], when many Armenians found refuge in Yazidi villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Aren Torikian |title=Confronting the Yazidi Genocide |url=https://armenianweekly.com/2014/08/27/confronting-yezidid-genocide/ |website=The Armenian Weekly |date=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a Yazidi temple called Ziarat in the village of [[Aknalich]] in the region of [[Armavir Province|Armavir]]. Construction on a new  Yazidi temple in Aknalich, called "Quba Mere Diwan," is underway. The temple is slated to become the largest Yazidi temple in the world and is privately funded by Mirza Sloian, a Yazidi businessman based in [[Moscow]] who is originally from the Armavir region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/25/worlds-largest-yazidi-temple-under-construction-in-armenia|title=World's largest Yazidi temple under construction in Armenia|last=Sherwood|first=Harriet|date=2016-07-25|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kurdish Yazidi community of Turkey declined precipitously during the 20th century. By 1982, the community had decreased to about 30,000, and in 2009 there were fewer than 500. Most of them have immigrated to Europe, particularly Germany; those who remain reside primarily in their former heartland of [[Tur Abdin]].&lt;ref name="iranica" /&gt;

===Western Europe===
{{Main|Yazidis in Germany|Yazidis in France|Yazidis in Sweden}}
This mass emigration has resulted in the establishment of large Yazidi [[diaspora]] communities abroad. The most significant of these is in Germany, which now has a Yazidi community of more than 100,000 living primarily in [[Hannover]], [[Bielefeld]], [[Celle]], [[Bremen]], [[Bad Oeynhausen]], [[Pforzheim]] and [[Oldenburg]].&lt;ref name="spiegel" /&gt; Most are from Turkey and, more recently, Iraq and live in the western states of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and [[Lower Saxony]].&lt;ref name="iranica" /&gt; Since 2008, Sweden has seen sizeable growth in its Yazidi emigrant community, which had grown to around 4,000 by 2010,&lt;ref name=Megalommatis /&gt; and a smaller community exists in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="iranica" /&gt; Other Yazidi diaspora groups live in Belgium, Denmark, France, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and Australia; these have a total population of probably less than 5,000.&lt;ref name="iranica" /&gt;

[[Feleknas Uca]], a Yazidi Member of the [[European Parliament]] for Germany's [[Left Party (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]], was the world's only Yazidi parliamentarian until the [[Iraqi parliamentary election, January 2005|Iraqi legislature was elected in 2005]]. European Yazidis have contributed to the academic community, such as [[Khalil Rashow]] in Germany and [[Jalile Jalil]] in Austria.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In May 2012, four members of a Yazidi family living in [[Detmold]], Germany were convicted for having murdered their sister in a so-called "[[honour killing]]" and sentenced to terms ranging from four-and-a-half years to life in prison. The victim was 18-year-old Arzu Özmen (also spelled Ozmen outside Germany), who fell in love with a German journeyman baker and ran away from her family, violating the exogamy taboo. In November 2011, her siblings abducted her, and brother Osman killed her with two shots in the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/prosecutors-focus-on-father-in-german-honor-killing-case-a-834752.html|title=The Role of the Father – Honor Killing Verdict Has Prosecutors Wanting More (English)|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|date=2012-05-24|access-date=2012-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The Yazidi people speak [[Northern Kurdish|Kurmanji Kurdish]]&lt;ref name="YAZIDIS i. GENERAL" /&gt; and adhere to the religion Yazidism. Their cultural practices are observed in [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], which is also the language of almost all the orally transmitted religious traditions of the Yazidis.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Betts |first1=Robert Brenton |title=The Sunni-Shi'a Divide: Islam's Internal Divisions and Their Global Consequences|date=2013 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=luSHLVR5XZUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Sunni-Shi%27a+Divide:+Islam%27s+Internal+Divisions+and+Their+Global+Consequences&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=arabic%20speaking%20yazidis&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Yazidis speak mostly in Kurdish, their exact origin is a matter of dispute among scholars, even among the community itself as well as among Kurds, whether they are ethnically Kurds or form a distinct ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNHCR's Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Needs of Iraqi Asylum-Seekers|page=11|url=http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/46deb05557.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stafford|first1=R.S.|title=The Tragedy of the Assyrians|page=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LSzuzsRh37gC&amp;pg=PA15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Andrew Phillip|title=The Gnostics: History * Tradition * Scriptures * Influence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hOMh98TRc6cC&amp;pg=PT197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Concise encyclopedia of the Middle East|date=1973|page=325|url=https://www.google.com.tr/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=tr&amp;q=Concise+encyclopedia+of+the+Middle+East&amp;gws_rd=ssl#hl=tr&amp;q=Concise+encyclopedia+of+the+Middle+East+obscure+origins+of+yazidis&amp;tbm=bks}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dalyan, Dogan|first1=Murat Gokhan, Cabir|title=An Overview of 19th Century Yezidi Women|issue=Who Are the Yezidis?|page=114|url=https://archive.org/details/AnOverviewOf19thCenturyYezidiWomen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of the Arab Peoples: Updated Edition|date=2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=irtb55WDsjMC&amp;pg=RA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Leary|first1=Carole A.|title=The Kurds of Iraq: Recent History, Future Prospects|url=http://www.gloria-center.org/meria/2002/12/oleary.pdf|access-date=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Armenia Country Study Guide Volume 1 Strategic Information and Developments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3WqaAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levinson|first1=David|title=Ethnic Groups Worldwide: A Ready Reference Handbook|date=1998|page=203|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uwi-rv3VV6cC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Ethnic+Groups+Worldwide:+A+Ready+Reference+Handbook&amp;hl=tr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SGD0U_utHsj_OYixgNgB&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ethnic%20Groups%20Worldwide%3A%20A%20Ready%20Reference%20Handbook&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Armenia]], the Yazidis are recognized as a distinct ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Serinci |first1=Deniz |title=The Yezidis of Armenia Face Identity Crisis over Kurdish Ethnicity |url=http://rudaw.net/english/people-places/28052014 |agency=[[Rudaw Media Network]] |date=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Green |first1=Emma |title=The Yazidis, a People Who Fled |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/08/the-yazidis-a-people-who-fled/375964/ |work=[[The Atlantic]] |date=13 August 2014 |quote=Recently, Yazidis in Armenia tried to establish themselves as an independent, non-Kurdish ethnic group for political reasons...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Refworld {{!}} UNHCR's Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Iraqi Asylum-seekers|url = http://www.refworld.org/docid/46deb05557.html|website = Refworld|access-date = 2016-01-28|first = United Nations High Commissioner for|last = Refugees}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yazidis' own name for themselves is ''Êzidî'' or ''Êzîdî'' or, in some areas, ''Dasinî'' (the latter, strictly speaking, is a tribal name). Western scholars derive the name from the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad Caliph]] [[Yazid I|Yazīd ibn Muʿāwiya]] (Yazid I), who is revered by Yazidis as Sultan Ezi.&lt;ref name=iryez&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/yazidis-i-general-1|title=Encyclopaedia Iranica: Yazidis|publisher=Iranicaonline.org|access-date=2014-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier scholars and many Yazidis derive it from [[Old Iranian]] ''yazata'', [[Middle Persian]] ''yazad'' 'divine being'.&lt;ref&gt;P.G. Kreyenbroek, "Yazīdī" in ''Encyclopedia of Islam'', ''s.v.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yezidi Man-2.png|thumb|upright=0.5|Yazidi man in traditional clothes]]

One of the important figures of Yazidism is [[Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir|'Adī ibn Musafir]], who is said to be of [[Umayyad]] descent. [[Shaykh|Sheikh]] Adi ibn Musafir settled in the valley of [[Lalish|Laliş]] (some {{convert|36|mi|km|order=flip}} northeast of [[Mosul, Iraq|Mosul]]) in the Yazidi mountains in the early 12th century and founded the 'Adawiyya Sufi order. He died in 1162, and his tomb at Laliş is a focal point of Yazidi pilgrimage and the principal Yazidi holy site.&lt;ref&gt;Late Antique Motifs in ''Yezidi Oral Tradition'' by Eszter Spät. Ch. 9 "The Origin Myth of the Yezidis" section "The Myth of Shehid Bin Jer" (p. 347)&lt;/ref&gt; Yazidism has many influences: [[Sufi]] influence and imagery can be seen in the religious vocabulary, especially in the terminology of the Yazidis' esoteric literature, but much of the theology is non-Islamic. Its cosmogony apparently has many points in common with those of ancient [[Iranian religions]] blended with elements of pre-Islamic ancient [[Mesopotamian]] religious traditions and [[Zoroastrianism]].&lt;ref name="Eckardt &amp; Eade" /&gt; &lt;!--Iranica (Christine Allison) explicitly says that this is the consensus.--&gt; It is also believed that Yazidism is a branch of [[Yazdânism]], the pre-Islamic, native religion of the Kurds. 

Early writers attempted to describe Yazidi origins, broadly speaking, in terms of [[Islam]], or Persian, or sometimes even "[[paganism|pagan]]" religions; however, research published since the 1990s has shown such an approach to be simplistic.&lt;ref name="iranica" /&gt;

Another theory of Yazidi origins is given by the Persian scholar [[Al-Shahrastani]]. According to Al-Shahrastani, the Yezidis are the followers of Yezîd bn Unaisa, who kept friendship with the first Muhakkamah before the Azariḳa. The first Muhakkamah is an appellative applied to the Muslim schismatics called Al-Ḫawarij. Accordingly, it might be inferred that the Yezidis were originally a [[Kharijites|Ḫarijite]] sub-sect. Yezid bn Unaisa moreover, is said to have been in sympathy with the [[Ibadis]], a sect founded by [[Abd-Allah ibn Ibadh|'Abd-Allah Ibn Ibaḍ]]."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph 1919, pp. 119–21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics==
Modern-day [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and Yazidis from Northern Iraq have a stronger genetic continuity with the original Mesopotamian people. The northern Iraqi Syriac and Yazidi populations were found in the middle of a genetic continuum between the Near East and Southeastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;"Consequently, despite corresponding to isolated and homogenous populations, contemporary Syriacs and Yazidis from Northern Iraq may in fact have a stronger continuity with the original genetic stock of the Mesopotamian people, which possibly provided the basis for the ethnogenesis of various subsequent Near Eastern populations.&lt;br&gt;the Northern Iraqi Syriac and Yazidi populations from the current study were found to position in the middle of a genetic continuum between the Near East and Southeastern Europe." http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0187408&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious beliefs==
{{Main|Yazdânism}}
[[File:Pilgrims and festival at Lalish on the day of the Yezidi New Year in 2017 06.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lalish]], the heart of the Yazidi faith]]
Yazidis are monotheists,&lt;ref name="Monotheism"/&gt; believing in one God, who created the world and entrusted it into the care of a ''Heptad'' of seven [[Holy]] Beings, often known as [[Angel]]s or ''heft sirr'' (the Seven Mysteries). The names of these beings or angels are [[Azazil|Azaz'il]], [[Gabriel|Gabra'il (Jabra'il)]], [[Michael (archangel)|Mikha'il]], [[Raphael (archangel)|Rafa'il]] ([[Israfil]]), Dadra'il, [[Azrail|Azrafil]] and [[Shamsiel|Shamkil]] (Shemna'il)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Robert |first1=L K |title=The Cults of the Angels: The Indigenous Religions of Kurdistan |url=https://www.academia.edu/10772192/The_Cults_of_the_Angels_The_Indigenous_Religions_of_Kurdistan |website=www.academia.edu |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preeminent among these is [[Melek Taus|Tawûsê Melek]] (frequently known as "Melek Taus" in English publications), the Peacock Angel&lt;ref name=NatGeo-WhoAre-2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Asher-Schapiro|first1=Avi|title=Who Are the Yazidis, the Ancient, Persecuted Religious Minority Struggling to Survive in Iraq?|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/08/140809-iraq-yazidis-minority-isil-religion-history|work=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|date=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph-YazidiDiaspora-2007 /&gt; (identified with one of these Angels). Tawûsê Melek is often identified by Christians and Muslims with [[Satan]]. According to claims in ''Encyclopedia of the Orient'',
{{Quote|The reason for the Yazidis' reputation of being devil worshipers is connected to the other name of Melek Taus, [[Shaytan]], the same name the [[Qur'an|Koran]] has for Satan.&lt;ref name="looklex"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i-cias.com/e.o/uyazidism.htm|title=Yazidism|first=Tore|last=Kjeilen|access-date=2008-03-31|work=Encyclopaedia|publisher=LookLex|quote=Malak Taus filled 7 jars of tears through 7,000 years. His tears were used to extinguish the fire in hell. Therefore, there is no hell in Yazidism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Yazidis, however, believe Tawûsê Melek is not a source of evil or wickedness. They consider him to be the leader of the [[archangels]], not a fallen angel.&lt;ref name=KurdsContemporaryOverview-1992 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Yezidis-Acikyildiz-2014 /&gt;

{{Quote|The Yazidis of Kurdistan have been called many things, most notoriously 'devil-worshippers,' a term used both by unsympathetic neighbours and fascinated Westerners.

===Tawûsê Melek, the Peacock Angel===
{{main|Melek Taus}}
The Yazidis believe in a divine triad, like the [[Alawites]].&lt;ref name="ReligionOfPeacockAngel-2014"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/religion-of-the-peacock-angel-the-yezidis-and-their-spirit-world/oclc/890090566/viewport|title=The Religion of the Peacock Angel: The Yezidis and Their Spirit World|last2=Arakelova|first2=Victoria|date=2014|publisher=Routledge, Taylor &amp; Francis Group|year=|isbn=978-1-317-54429-6|location=London|pages=|oclc=890090566|quote=p. 3: A careful analysis of the Yezidi triad will show its component deities to be unambiguous manifestations of the one god worshipped by adherents. … The Yezidi triad comprises the following: Malak-Tawus, the Peacock-Angel (in the Yezidi imagination being featured as a bird, a peacock or a cock, and sometimes even a dove); Sheikh ‘Adi (Seyx ‘Adi = Sheikh ‘Adi bin Musafir, a historical personality, the founder of the proto-Yezidi community, as an old man); and Sultan Yezid (Silt’an Ezid, as a youth). All three characters are manifestations of god – xwade (or xwadi, xuda, the term deriving from the New Pers. xuday). pp. 21-22: A little star fell from heaven, said an ancient Yezidi legend, and hid in the depth of the then still dark earth. … That beam, that particle of endless light, was the great and glorious Melak-Tauz [sic!]; … he believed and hoped that a spark of the better light that had been brought by him would not be extinguished even among cruel and corrupt people, and the bright hope did not deceive Melak-Tauz. There came about kind people, pure in heart, who had preserved the unextinguished spark of endless light falling on earth as a bright start of heaven; they recognized and welcomed Melak-Tauz, … Those people were the Yezidis; until now they go after Melak-Tauz, hated and cursed by the whole world. p. 31: Malak-Tawusis believe that ‘Ali had existed before the Creation as Perfect (Absolute) Light (nur-e mutlaq). Four servitor Angels were created from ‘Ali's pure essence … Israil from his tongue, and Malak-Amin (i.e. Malak-Tawus) as the reincarnation of ‘Ali (dun-e ‘Ali). p. 33: This verse is interesting because it features the concept of the Yezidis having originated from Adam directly, rather from his union with Eve, as is the case with all the rest of mankind.|last1=Asatryan|first1=Garnik S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} The original god of the Yazidis is considered to be remote and inactive in relation to his creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kurdistanica.com/?q=node/101|title=The Cult of Angels|last=|first=|date=July 17, 2008|website=Kurdistanica|access-date=|quote=The Cult believes in a boundless, all encompassing, yet fully detached "Universal Spirit" (Haq), whose only involvement in the material world has been his primeval manifestation as a supreme avatar who after coming into being himself, created the material universe. (Haq, incidentally, is not derived from the Arabic homophone haqq, meaning "truth," as commonly and erroneously believed.) The Spirit has stayed out of the affairs of the material world except to contain and bind it together within his essence. The prime avatar who became the Creator is identified as the Lord God in all branches of the Cult except Yezidism, as discussed below.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first emanation is Tawûsê Melek, who functions as the ruler of the world. The second hypostasis of this trinity is [[Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir|Sheikh Adî]]. The third is [[Yazid I|Sultan Ezid]]. These are the three hypostases of the one God. The identity of these three is sometimes blurred, with Sheikh Adî considered to be a manifestation of Tawûsê Melek and vice versa. The same also applies to Sultan Ezid. Besides the triad, the second peculiar feature of Yazidi belief is the similarity between Tawûsê Melek and the [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] Satan (the Islamic [[Devil (Islam)|Iblīs]]). A popular Yazidi story narrates the fall of Tawûsê Melek and his subsequent rejection by humanity, with the exception of the Yazidis.&lt;ref name=ReligionOfPeacockAngel-2014 /&gt;{{rp|21–22}}

The ''[[Kitêba Cilwe]]'' "Book of Illumination", which claims to be the words of Tawûsê Melek, and which presumably represents Yazidi belief, states that he allocates responsibilities, blessings, and misfortunes as he sees fit and that it is not for the race of [[Adam]] to question him. Sheikh Adî believed that the spirit of Tawûsê Melek was the same as his own, perhaps as a reincarnation. He is reported to have said:{{Quote|I was present when Adam was living in Paradise, and also when [[Nimrod (king)|Nemrud]] threw [[Abraham]] in fire. I was present when God said to me: 'You are the ruler and Lord on the Earth'. God, the compassionate, gave me seven earths and throne of the heaven.}}Yazidi accounts of [[Creation myth|creation]] differ from that of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]]. They believe that God first created Tawûsê Melek from his own (God's) illumination (''Ronahî'') and the other six archangels were created later. God ordered Tawûsê Melek not to bow to other beings. Then God created the other archangels and ordered them to bring him dust (''Ax'') from the Earth (''Erd'') and build the body of Adam. Then, God gave life to Adam from his own breath and instructed all archangels to bow to Adam. The archangels obeyed except for Tawûsê Melek. In answer to God, Tawûsê Melek replied, "How can I submit to another being! I am from your illumination while Adam is made of dust." Then, God praised him and made him the leader of all angels and his deputy on the Earth. (This probably furthers what some see as a connection to the Islamic ''Shaytan'', as according to the [[Quran]], he too refused to bow to Adam at God's command, though in this case it is seen as being a sign of Shaytan's sinful pride.) Hence, the Yazidis believe that Tawûsê Melek is the representative of God on the face of the Earth and comes down to the Earth on the first Wednesday of [[Nisan]] (April). 

Yazidis hold that God created Tawûsê Melek on this day and celebrate it as New Year's Day. Yazidis argue that the order to bow to Adam was only a test for Tawûsê Melek, since if God commands anything then it must happen. (''Bibe, dibe''). In other words, God could have made him submit to Adam, but gave Tawûsê Melek the choice as a test. They believe that their respect and praise for Tawûsê Melek is a way to acknowledge his majestic and sublime nature. This idea is called "Knowledge of the Sublime" (''Zanista Ciwaniyê''). Şêx Adî has observed the story of Tawûsê Melek and believed in him.&lt;ref name="yeziditruth_sheik"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yeziditruth.org/yezidi_reformer_sheikh_adi |title=Yezidi Reformer: Sheikh Adi |work=The Truth about the Yezidis |publisher=YezidiTruth.org, A Humanitarian Organization, Sedona, Arizona |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080320070927/http://www.yeziditruth.org/yezidi_reformer_sheikh_adi |archivedate=20 March 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descendants of Adam===
One of the key creation beliefs held by Yazidis is that they are the descendants of Adam through his son Shehid bin Jer rather than Eve.&lt;ref name="looklex" /&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2017}} The Yazidis believe that before Adam and Eve copulated with each other for the first time, Tawûsê Melek encouraged them to see if they could reproduce on their own. He had the couple place their reproductive fluids in jars and store them for several months. When each jar was opened several months later, Eve's was found to contain vermin and insects, and Adam's was found to have contained a beautiful baby boy, Shehid bin Jer.&lt;ref name=YezidiTruth-ReligiousTradition&gt;{{cite web|title=Yezidi Religious Tradition|url=http://www.yeziditruth.org/yezidi_religious_tradition|website=YezidiTruth.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lovely child, known as ''son of Jar'' grew up to marry a [[houri]] and became the ancestor of the Yazidis. Therefore, the Yazidis regard themselves as descending from Adam alone, while other humans are descendants of both Adam and Eve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Yazidi Oral Tradition in Iraq|last=Allison|first=Christine|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=0-7007-1397-2|page=40|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8B1g3YUhYU0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q|access-date=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ReligionOfPeacockAngel-2014 /&gt;{{rp|33}} This is the reason given for Yazidis being exclusively [[endogamy|endogamous]]; clans do not [[interreligious marriage|intermarry]] with non-Yazidis and accept no [[religious conversion|converts]] to Yazidism.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} A severe punishment for breaking this rule is expulsion, which is also effectively [[excommunication]] as the soul of the exilee is forfeit.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Reincarnation===
A belief in the [[reincarnation]] of lesser Yazidi souls also exists. Like the [[Ahl-e Haqq]], the Yazidis use the [[metaphor]] of a change of garment to describe the process, which they call ''kiras guhorîn'' in [[Kurmanji]] (changing the garment). Spiritual purification of the soul can be attained via continual reincarnation within the faith group, but it can also be halted by means of expulsion from the Yazidi community; this is the worst possible fate, since the soul's spiritual progress halts and conversion back into the faith is impossible.&lt;ref name=BBCNews-WhoWhatWhy-2014 /&gt; Alongside this notion of continuous rebirth, Yazidi theology also includes descriptions of [[heaven]] and [[hell]], with hell extinguished, and other traditions incorporating these ideas into a belief system that includes reincarnation.&lt;ref name="looklex" /&gt;

===Yazidi holy texts===
The Yazidi [[holy book]]s are claimed to be the ''Kitêba Cilwe'' ([[Yazidi Book of Revelation|Book of Revelation]]) and the ''Mishefa Reş'' ([[Yazidi Black Book|Black Book]]). However, scholars generally agree that the manuscripts of both books published in 1911 and 1913 were forgeries written by non-Yazidis in response to Western travellers' and scholars' interest in the Yazidi religion; however, the material in them is consistent with authentic Yazidi traditions.&lt;ref name="iryez" /&gt; True texts of those names may have existed, but remain obscure. The real core texts of the religion that exist today are the hymns known as qawls; they have also been orally transmitted during most of their history, but are now being collected with the assent of the community, effectively transforming Yazidism into a scriptural religion.&lt;ref name=iryez /&gt; The qawls are full of cryptic allusions and usually need to be accompanied by ''čirōks'' or 'stories' that explain their context.&lt;ref name=iryez /&gt;

Yazidi society is hierarchical.

==Religious practices==

===Prayers===
[[File:Dergehê perestgeha Lalishê 1 2012.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Temple entry at [[Lalish]]]]
Yazidis have five daily prayers:&lt;ref name=YezidiTruth-ReligiousTradition /&gt;{{quote|''Nivêja berîspêdê'' (the Dawn Prayer), ''Nivêja rojhilatinê'' (the Sunrise Prayer), ''Nivêja nîvroyê'' (the Noon Prayer), ''Nivêja êvarî'' (the Afternoon Prayer), ''Nivêja rojavabûnê'' (the Sunset Prayer). However, most Yezidis observe only two of these, the sunrise and sunset prayers.}} Worshipers should turn their face toward the sun, and for the noon prayer, they should face toward [[Lalish|Laliş]]. Such prayer should be accompanied by certain gestures, including kissing the rounded neck (''gerîvan'') of the sacred shirt (''kiras''). The daily prayer services must not be performed in the presence of outsiders and are always performed in the direction of the sun. Wednesday is the holy day, but Saturday is the day of rest.&lt;ref name=YezidiTruth-ReligiousTradition /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B00E5DF1E3FF930A35752C0A9659C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|title=Bashiqa Journal: A Sect Shuns Lettuce and Gives the Devil His Due|first=Neill|last=MacFarquhar|authorlink=Neil MacFarquhar|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2003-01-03|access-date=2008-03-31|quote=Yazidis pray three times a day, at dawn, midday and sunset, facing the direction of the sun each time.

They have adopted Christian rituals like baptism and a smattering of practices from Islam ranging from circumcision to removal of their shoes inside their temples. The importance of fire as a divine manifestation comes from Zoroastrianism, the ancient Iranian faith that forms the core of Yazidi beliefs. Indeed their very name is likely taken from an old Persian word for angel.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calendar and festivals===
According to the Yezidi calendar, April 2012 marked the beginning of their year 6,762 (thereby year 1 would have been in 4,750 BC in the Gregorian calendar).&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdNoWVVAE5A Yazidis celebrate New Year in Iraq], [[Al Jazeera]] (YouTube), 28 April 2012. Retrieved 3 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yazidi New Year,&lt;ref&gt;[http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/1573384x-20160306&lt;/ref&gt;  called Serê Sal or Çarşemiya Sor (Red Wednesday), falls in Spring, on the first Wednesday of April (somewhat later than the [[Equinox]]). There is some lamentation by women in the cemeteries, to the accompaniment of the music of the ''Qewals'', but the festival is generally characterized by joyous events: the music of ''def'' (drum) and ''shebab'' ([[shawm]]), communal dancing and meals, the decorating of eggs.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Similarly, the village Tawaf, a festival held in the spring in honour of the patron of the local shrine, has secular music, dance, and meals in addition to the performance of sacred music. Another important festival is the ''Tawûsgeran'' (circulation of the peacock) where Qewals and other religious dignitaries visit Yazidi villages, bringing the ''senjaq'', sacred images of a peacock made from brass symbolizing Tawûsê Melek. These are venerated, taxes are collected from the pious, sermons are preached and holy water distributed.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

[[File:Lalish.jpg|thumbnail|Tomb of [[Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir]] (''Şêx Adî'') in [[Lalish|Laliş]]]]
The greatest festival of the year for ordinary Yazidis is the ''Cejna Cemaiya'' "Feast of the Assembly" at [[Lalish|Laliş]], the annual seven-day [[pilgrimage]] to the tomb of [[Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir]] (''Şêx Adî'') in [[Lalish|Laliş]], north of [[Mosul]], [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name=YezidiTruth-ReligiousTradition /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes-BabaShaweesh-1993&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hedges|first1=Chris|title=Sheik Adi Journal; Satan's Alive and Well, but the Sect May Be Dying|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/31/world/sheik-adi-journal-satan-s-alive-and-well-but-the-sect-may-be-dying.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=31 May 1993|quote=The Yazidis, who are part of Iraq's Yazidi minority, had 100 of 150 villages demolished during the counterinsurgency operation against the Kurdish rebel movement that reached its peak in 1988.

The sect follows the teachings of Sheik Adi, a holy man who died in 1162, and whose crypt lies in the shrine in the Lalish Valley, about {{convert|15|mi|km|disp=sqbr}} east of Mosul. The shrine's graceful, fluted spires poke above the trees and dominate the fertile valley. ... Like Zoroastrians they venerate fire, the sun and the mulberry tree. They believe in the transmigration of souls, often into animals. The sect does not accept converts and banishes anyone who marries outside the faith. Yazidis are forbidden to disclose most of their rituals and beliefs to nonbelievers.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival, which is celebrated from 23 ''[[Elul|Aylūl]]'' (September) to 1 ''[[Tishrei|Tashrīn]]'' (October), is an important time for social contact and affirmation of identity.&lt;ref name=ei&gt;{{cite book|last=Allison|first=Christine|work=Encyclopædia Iranica (1996)|title=YAZIDIS|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/yazidis-i-general-1|access-date=11 June 2015|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If possible, Yazidis make at least one pilgrimage to [[Lalish|Laliş]] during their lifetime, and those living in the region try to attend at least once a year for the autumn ''Feast of the Assembly''. A sacred microcosm of the world, as it were, it contains not only many shrines dedicated to the ''koasasas'' (reincarnations of the seven holy beings in human form),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=YEZIDI RELIGIOUS |title=Yezidis Faith ديانتنا |url=http://www.yezidisinternational.org/abouttheyezidipeople/religion/ |website=Yezidis}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a number of other landmarks corresponding to other sites or symbols of significance in other faiths, including ''Pirra selat'' "Serat Bridge" and a mountain called Mt. Arafat. The two sacred springs are called ''Zamzam'' and ''Kaniya Sipî'' "The White Spring". 

During the celebration, Yazidis bathe in the river, wash figures of [[Melek Taus|Tawûsê Melek]] and light hundreds of lamps in the tombs of ''Şêx Adî'' and other saints. They sacrifice an [[ox]], which is one reason they have been connected to [[Mithraism]], in addition to the presence of the dog and serpent in their iconography. The sacrifice of the ox is meant to declare the arrival of fall and to ask for precipitation during winter to bring back life to the Earth in the next spring. Moreover, in [[astrology]], the ox is the symbol of Tashrīn.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The religious centre of the event is the belief in an annual gathering of the ''Heptad'' in the holy place at this time. Rituals practised include the sacrifice of a bull at the shrine of Şêx Shams and the practice of ''[[sema]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

There is also a three-day fast in December.&lt;ref name="looklex" /&gt;&lt;ref name=YezidiTruth-ReligiousTradition /&gt;

===Purity and taboos===
{{one source|section|date=June 2015}}
[[File:YezidiTemple.JPG|left|thumb|The Chermera Temple, or "40 Men Temple", on the highest peak of the [[Sinjar Mountains]] in northern Iraq. The temple is so old that no one remembers how it came to have that name, but it is believed to derive from the burial of  forty men on the mountaintop site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lair |first1=Patrick |title=Conversation with a Yazidi Kurd |url=http://www.ekurd.net/mismas/articles/misc2008/1/kurdsiniraq6.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123063620/http://www.ekurd.net/mismas/articles/misc2008/1/kurdsiniraq6.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 January 2008 |access-date=24 June 2015 |work=eKurd Daily |date=19 January 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Yazidis' concern with religious purity and their reluctance to mix elements perceived to be incompatible is shown in not only their caste system but also various taboos affecting everyday life. The purity of Earth, Air, Fire and Water is protected by a number of taboos, e.g. against spitting on earth, water or fire. Some discourage spitting or pouring hot water on the ground because they believe that spirits or souls that may be present would be harmed or offended by such actions if they happen to be hit by the discarded liquid.

Too much contact with non-Yazidis is also considered polluting. In the past, Yazidis avoided military service which would have led them to live among [[Muslims]] and were forbidden to share such items as cups or razors with outsiders. A resemblance to the external ear may lie behind the taboo against eating head lettuce, whose name ''koas'' resembles Yazidi pronunciations of ''koasasa''. Additionally, lettuce grown near Mosul is thought by some Yazidis to be fertilised with human waste, which may contribute to the idea that it is unsuitable for consumption. However, in a BBC interview in April 2010, a senior Yazidi authority stated that ordinary Yazidis may eat what they want, but holy men refrain from certain vegetables (including cabbage) because "they cause gases".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/8598970.stm "Richness of Iraq's minority religions revealed"], BBC.

===Customs===
Children are [[baptism|baptised]] at birth and [[circumcision]] is not required, but is practised by some due to regional customs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parry |first1=O. H.

==Western perceptions==
As the Yazidis hold religious beliefs that are mostly unfamiliar to outsiders, many non-Yazidi people have written about them and ascribed to their beliefs facts that have dubious historical validity. The Yazidis, perhaps because of their secrecy, also have a place in modern occultism.

===In Theosophy ===
The [[Theosophical Society]], in its electronic version of the ''Encyclopedic Theosophical Glossary'' states:
{{quote|'''Yezidis''' (Arabic) [possibly from Persian yazdan god; or the 2nd Umayyad Caliph, Yazid (r. 680–683); or Persian city Yezd] A sect dwelling principally in Iraq, Armenia, and the Caucasus, who call themselves Dasni. Their religious beliefs take on the characteristics of their surrounding peoples, inasmuch as, openly or publicly, they regard Mohammed as a prophet, and Jesus Christ as an angel in human form. Points of resemblance are found with ancient Zoroastrian and Assyrian religion. The principal feature of their worship, however, is Satan under the name of Muluk-Taus. However, it is not the Christian Satan, nor the devil in any form; their Muluk-Taus is the hundred- or thousand-eyed cosmic wisdom, pictured as a bird (the peacock).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|contribution=Yezidis|title=Encyclopedic Theosophical Glossary|publisher=Theosophical University Press|year=1999|contribution-url=http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/etgloss/ya-yz.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Theosophical Society]] believes that [[Sanat Kumara]] is the "Lord (or Ruler) of the World".&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Pages 296–299&lt;/ref&gt; Just as with Yazidi beliefs about the Peacock Angel, outsiders have, at times, viewed the Theosophical Society as worshiping Satan, due to the similarities between Sanat Kumara and the Biblical Lucifer and/or Satan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mythoughtsbornfromfire.wordpress.com/2014/04/21/the-eternal-youth-thoughts-on-sanat-kumara/|title=The Eternal Youth: Thoughts on Sanat Kumara|last=|first=|date=April 21, 2014|website=Aleph's Heretical Domain|access-date=|quote=Some people, mostly Christians, equate Sanat Kumara with Lucifer/Satan, perhaps due to the fact that in Theosophical lore, Sanat Kumara arrived to Earth from Venus, just as Lucifer was associated with the morning star (Venus), as well as Sanat Kumara being referred to as King of the World or Lord of the World.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Theosophist Mark Pinkham explicitly attempts to link the Yazidi myth of the Peacock Angel to Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Truth Behind the Christ Myth: The Redemption of the Peacock Angel|last=Pinkham|first=Mark Amaru|publisher=Adventures Unlimited Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Peacock Angel's higher self was represented by Christ, the historical Jesus being Sananda Kumara, Sanat Kumara's brother. Pinkham's claim is that Tawûsê Melek and the Theosophical Sanat Kumara are more or less the same individual and that upon the fall of the Peacock Angel, evil entered the world, causing duality to enter Tawûsê Melek's being. The Angel's fallen state was represented by his being called Satan and his outcast nature. However, Pinkham states that the Angel will eventually succeed in redeeming himself, thereby symbolically returning as Christ. The redemption of the Peacock Angel therefore serves as the redemption of the entire world and the ushering in of the eternal kingdom of God. Pinkham claims that for this reason, the Yazidis refuse to refer to Tawûsê Melek as Satan, as this would introduce time and duality into his being, and mean they must acknowledge Tawûsê Melek's eventual and predestined redemption, wherein he merges with Christ (his higher self).

The distinction between the Theosophical belief and the classic Yazidi belief, is that the office of “Lord of the World,” is merely an initiation taken by an individual soul. Every individual who takes the ninth initiation also rules the world, and will in some sense experience a fall or incarnation, a la Tawûsê Melek or Satan. The ninth initiation, in Theosophy, is the last initiation available on Earth and there is only one individual on Earth on the ninth initiation at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Masters and the Path|last=Leadbeater|first=C.W.|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Theosophical schema does not include the existence of higher initiations that exist above the ninth one. The only “thing” above the “Lord of the World” is the “Trinity of the Logos,” a divine and limitless entity that resides inside the sun.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, H. P. (1968 [1889]). ''The Key to Theosophy''. London: Theosophical Publishing House.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Earthly representative of the Logos, is the “Ruler of the World,” which would square with the Yazidi claim that Tawûsê Melek is an emanation of God, but not God himself. A sect of the [[Yarsanism|Ahl-i Haqq]], who tend to deify ‘Ali, believe that Tawûsê Melek is merely an incarnation of ‘Ali and serves as his representative on Earth.&lt;ref name=ReligionOfPeacockAngel-2014 /&gt;{{rp|31}} Furthmore, the Alawites tend to associate ‘Ali with the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://religion.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199340378.001.0001/acrefore-9780199340378-e-85|title=The Alawis|last=Procházka|first=Stephan|date=September 2015|website=Oxford Research Encyclopedias|access-date=|quote=The deity is comparable to the sun in that He radiates light and heat forever.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Antioch on the Orontes|last=Christensen-Ernst|first=Jørgen|publisher=Hamilton Books|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=146|quote=They expect to regain their former status, making themselves deserving this by living as good Nusayris during consecutive rebirths, eventually ending up as stars or perfect souls in heaven.

===In Western literature===
[[File:USSHER(1865) p454 GATE OF YEZEEDI TEMPLE SHEIKH ADI.jpg|thumb|Image from ''A journey from London to Persepolis'', 1865]]
In [[William Seabrook|William Seabrook's]] book ''Adventures in Arabia'', the fourth section, starting with Chapter 14, is devoted to the "Yezidees" and is titled "Among the Yezidees". He describes them as "a mysterious sect scattered throughout the Orient, strongest in North Arabia, feared and hated both by Moslem and Christian, because they are worshippers of Satan." In the three chapters of the book, he completely describes the area, including the fact that this territory, including their holiest city of Sheik-Adi, was not part of "Irak".&lt;ref name="Seabrook"&gt;Seabrook, W.B., ''Adventures in Arabia'', Harcourt, Brace, and Company (1927).&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Gurdjieff]] wrote about his encounters with the Yazidis several times in his book ''[[Meetings with Remarkable Men]]'', mentioning that they are considered to be "devil worshippers" by other ethnicities in the region. Also, in [[P. D. Ouspensky|Peter Ouspensky]]'s book "In Search of the Miraculous", he describes some strange customs that Gurdjieff observed in Yezidi boys: "He told me, among other things, that when he was a child he had often observed how Yezidi boys were unable to step out of a circle traced round them on the ground" (p.&amp;nbsp;36)

[[Idries Shah]], writing under the pen-name ''Arkon Daraul'', in the 1961 book ''Secret Societies Yesterday and Today'', describes discovering a Yazidi-influenced [[secret society]] in the London suburbs called the "[[Order of the Peacock Angel]]." Shah claimed Tawûsê Melek could be understood, from the Sufi viewpoint, as an allegory of the higher powers in humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sufis|first=Idries|last=Shah|pages=437–38|isbn=0-385-07966-4|publisher=Anchor Doubleday|year=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[H.P. Lovecraft]]'s story "The Horror at Red Hook", some of the murderous foreigners are identified as belonging to "the Yezidi clan of devil-worshippers".&lt;ref name="Lovecraft"&gt;Lovecraft, H.P., ''The Complete Fiction'', Barnes &amp; Noble, 2008; {{ISBN|978-1-4351-2296-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Patrick O'Brian]]'s [[Aubrey-Maturin series]] novel ''[[The Letter of Marque]]'', set during the Napoleonic wars, there is a Yazidi character named Adi. His ethnicity is referred to as "Dasni".

A fictional Yazidi character of note is the super-powered police officer King Peacock of the ''[[Top 10 (comics)|Top 10]]'' series (and related comics).&lt;ref&gt;[[Moore, Alan]] and [[Gene Ha|Ha, Gene]] (1999–2000) Top Ten issues 1–12,&lt;/ref&gt; He is portrayed as a kind, peaceful character with a broad knowledge of religion and mythology. He is depicted as conservative, ethical, and highly principled in family life. An incredibly powerful martial artist, he is able to perceive and strike at his opponent's weakest spots, a power that he claims is derived from communicating with Malek Ta'us.

The Yazidis play a significant role in the thriller ''Genesis Secret'', by [[Tom Knox (author)|Tom Knox]], which was an international best-seller in 2006, published in 23 languages. In the book, the Yazidis are portrayed as ancient guardians of the megalithic site, [[Gobekli Tepe]], in Kurdish Turkey.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

====In US Army memoirs====
In her memoir of her service with an intelligence unit of the US Army's 101st Airborne Division in Iraq during 2003 and 2004, [[Kayla Williams (author)|Kayla Williams]] (2005) records being stationed in northern Iraq near the Syrian border in an area inhabited by "Yezidis". According to Williams, some Yezidis were Kurdish-speaking but did not consider themselves Kurds and expressed to her a fondness for America and Israel. She was able to learn only a little about the nature of their religion: she thought it very ancient, and concerned with angels. She describes a mountain-top Yezidi shrine as "a small rock building with objects dangling from the ceiling" and alcoves for the placement of offerings. She reported that local Muslims considered the Yezidis to be devil worshippers.

In an October 2006 article in ''[[The New Republic]]'', [[Lawrence F. Kaplan]] echoes Williams's sentiments about the enthusiasm of the Yazidis for the American occupation of Iraq, in part because the Americans protect them from oppression by militant Muslims and the nearby Kurds. Kaplan notes that the peace and calm of [[Sinjar]] is virtually unique in Iraq: "Parents and children line the streets when U.S. patrols pass by, while Yazidi clerics pray for the welfare of U.S. forces."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://direct.bl.uk/bld/PlaceOrder.do?UIN=197238985&amp;ETOC=RN|title=Sinjar Diarist: Devil's Advocates|first=Lawrence F.|last=Kaplan|authorlink=Lawrence F.

[[Tony Lagouranis]] comments on a Yazidi prisoner in his book ''Fear Up Harsh: An Army Interrogator's Dark Journey through Iraq'':{{quote|There's a lot of mystery surrounding the Yazidi, and a lot of contradictory information. But I was drawn to this aspect of their beliefs: Yazidi don't have a Satan. Malak Ta'us, an archangel, God's favorite, was not thrown out of heaven the way Satan was. Instead, he descended, saw the suffering and pain of the world, and cried. His tears, thousands of years' worth, fell on the fires of hell, extinguishing them. If there is evil in the world, it does not come from a fallen angel or from the fires of hell. The evil in this world is man-made.

In 2014, with the territorial gains of the [[Salafist jihadism|Salafist]] militant group calling itself the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) there was much upheaval in the Iraqi Yazidi population. ISIL captured [[Sinjar]] in August 2014 following the withdrawal of [[Peshmerga]] troops of [[Masoud Barzani]], forcing up to 50,000 Yazidis to flee into the [[Sinjar Mountains|nearby mountainous region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/region/iraq/isil-militants-execute-dozens-from-yazidi-minority-1.1367034|title=Isil militants execute dozens from Yazidi minority|work=Gulf News|date=2014-08-05|access-date=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early August the town of Sinjar was nearly deserted as Kurdish [[Peshmerga]] forces were no longer able to keep ISIL forces from advancing. ISIL had previously declared the Yazidis to be devil worshippers and had taken the two nearby small oil fields and the town of Zumar as part of a plan to try to seize Mosul's hydroelectric dam.&lt;ref name=WashPost-Sinjar-2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morris|first1=Loveday|title=Families flee as Islamic State extremists seize another Iraqi town, pushing back the Kurds.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/islamic-state-seize-town-of-sinjar-pushing-out-kurds-and-sending-yazidis-fleeing/2014/08/03/52ab53f1-48de-4ae1-9e1d-e241a15f580e_story.html|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to 200,000 people (including an estimated 40,000 Yazidi&lt;ref name=Janssen&gt;{{cite news|title=Iraq Air Force to Back Kurds Fighting Islamists|date=4 August 2014|author=Bram Janssen &amp; Sameer N.

Most of the population fleeing Sinjar retreated by trekking up nearby mountains with the ultimate goal of reaching [[Dohuk]] in Iraqi Kurdistan (normally a five-hour drive by car). Concerns for the elderly and those of fragile health were expressed by the refugees, who told reporters of their lack of water. Reports coming from Sinjar stated that sick or elderly Yazidi who could not make the trek were being executed by ISIL. Yazidi parliamentarian Haji Ghandour told reporters that "In our history, we have suffered 72 massacres. We are worried Sinjar could be a 73rd."&lt;ref name=WashPost-Sinjar-2014 /&gt; UN groups say at least 40,000 members of the Yazidi sect, many of them women and children, had taken refuge in nine locations on [[Mount Sinjar]], a craggy, {{convert|1400|m|ft|abbr=on}} high ridge identified in local legend as the final resting place of Noah's ark, facing slaughter at the hands of jihadists surrounding them below if they fled or death by dehydration if they stayed.&lt;ref name=Guardian-40000-Mountain-2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chulov|first1=Martin|title=40,000 Iraqis stranded on mountain as Isis jihadists threaten death|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/07/40000-iraqis-stranded-mountain-isis-death-threat|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 20,000 and 30,000 Yazidis, most of them women and children, besieged by ISIL, escaped from the mountain after the [[People's Protection Units]] (YPG) and [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK) intervened to stop ISIL and opened a humanitarian corridor for them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/08/kurds-rescue-yazidis-from-iraq-mountain-201489135227783157.html|title=Kurds rescue Yazidis from Iraqi mountain|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]|date=10 August 2014|access-date=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; helping them cross the [[Tigris]] into [[Rojava]].&lt;ref name=BBCNews-ThousandsTrappedIraq-2014&gt;{{cite news|title=Thousands of Yazidis 'still trapped' on Iraq mountain|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28756544|work=[[BBC News]]|date=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Yazidis minority were later escorted back to Iraqi Kurdistan by [[Peshmerga]] and YPG forces, Kurdish officials have said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=20,000 Iraqis besieged by ISIL escape from mountain after US air strikes |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/10/iraq-yazidi-isis-jihadists-islamic-state-kurds |first=Haroon |last=Siddique |date=10 August 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hha&gt;{{cite news |title=Syrian Kurdish Fighters Rescue Stranded Yazidis |date=12 August 2014 |first1=Diaa |last1=Hadid |first2=Bassem |last2=Mroue |agency=Associated Press |url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/syrian-kurdish-fighters-rescue-stranded-yazidis-24948058 |quote=In a dusty camp here, Iraqi refugees have new heroes: Syrian Kurdish fighters who battled militants to carve out an escape route for tens of thousands trapped on a mountaintop. While the U.S. and Iraqi militaries struggle to aid the starving members of Iraq's Yazidi minority with supply drops from the air, the Syrian Kurds took it on themselves to rescue them. The move underlined how they—like Iraqi Kurds—are [[Kurdish nationalism|using the region's conflicts to establish their own rule]]. For the past few days, fighters have been rescuing Yazidis from the mountain, transporting them into [[Syria]]n territory to give them first aid, food and water, and returning some to Iraq via a pontoon bridge. [...] The U.N. estimated around 50,000 Yazidis fled to the mountain. But by Sunday, Kurdish officials said at least 45,000 had crossed through the safe passage, leaving thousands more behind and suggesting the number of stranded was higher.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haleh Esfandiari from the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] has highlighted the abuse of local women by ISIL militants after they have captured an area. "They usually take the older women to a makeshift slave market and try to sell them.
