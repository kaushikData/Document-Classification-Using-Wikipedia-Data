The '''2011 England riots''', more widely known as the '''London Riots''' were a series of [[riots]] between the 6th of August and 11 August 2011, when thousands of people rioted in cities and towns across [[England]], saw [[looting]], [[arson]], and mass deployment of police, and resulted in the deaths of five people.

Protests started in [[Tottenham]], [[London]], following the [[death of Mark Duggan]], a local man who was shot dead by police on 4 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14434318 |title=Riots in Tottenham after Mark Duggan shooting protest |publisher=BBC News |date=7 August 2011 |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several violent clashes with police ensued, along with the destruction of police vehicles, a [[double-decker bus]] and many homes and businesses, thus rapidly gaining attention from the media. Overnight, looting took place in [[Tottenham Hale]] retail park and nearby [[Wood Green]]. The following days saw similar scenes in other parts of London, with the worst rioting taking place in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], [[Brixton]], [[Walthamstow]], [[Peckham]], [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]], [[Battersea]], [[Croydon]], [[Ealing]], [[Barking, London|Barking]], [[Woolwich]], [[Lewisham]] and [[East Ham]].

From 8 to 10 August, other towns and cities in England (including [[Birmingham]], [[Coventry]], [[Leicester]], [[Derby]], [[Wolverhampton]], [[Northampton]], [[Nottingham]], [[West Bromwich]], [[Bristol]], [[Liverpool, England|Liverpool]], [[Manchester]], and [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]]) saw what was described by the media as "copycat violence". [[Social media]] sites including [[Facebook]] also featured rumours of further disturbances or details surrounding known disturbances which were later proven to be inaccurate; for instance there were rumours of disturbances in the town of [[Dudley]] and at the nearby [[Merry Hill Shopping Centre]], but no incidents in these areas were detected by police. Rumours of a hospital being targeted by rioters in Birmingham were also proven to be wrong, as were rumours of disturbances in the [[Heath Town]] district of Wolverhampton, which had witnessed a serious riot in May 1989.

By 10 August, more than 3,000 arrests had been made across England, with more than 1,000 people issued with criminal charges for various offences related to the riots.&lt;ref name=bbc15Aug/&gt; Initially, courts sat for extended hours. There were a total of 3,443 crimes across London that were linked to the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2011/08/25/london-riots-more-than-2-000-people-arrested-over-disorder-115875-23371068/ |title=London riots: More than 2,000 people arrested over disorder |date=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2011|8|15|alt=Along with the five deaths, at least 16 others were injured}} as a direct result of related violent acts. An estimated £200 million worth of property damage was incurred, and local economic activity – which in many cases was already struggling due to [[Great Recession|the recession]] – was significantly compromised.

The riots have generated significant ongoing debate among political, social and academic figures about the causes and context in which they happened. Attributions for the rioters' behaviour include such social factors such as racial tension, class tension, economic decline and the unemployment that it had brought, as well as individual factors like criminality, hooliganism, the breakdown of social morality and the development of gang culture.{{ref|&lt;ref name="cnn_figures"&gt;{{cite news|title=Britain's rioters count cost of unrest as order restored|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/08/12/uk.riots|publisher=CNN |date=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc15Aug&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14532532|title=England's week of riots|publisher=BBC News|date=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian-07-peaceful"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Lewis|first=Paul|title=Tottenham riots: a peaceful protest, then suddenly all hell broke loose|work=The Guardian|accessdate=7 August 2011|date=7 August 2011|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/07/tottenham-riots-peaceful-protest|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian-06-duggan"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tottenham in flames as protesters riot|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/06/police-cars-attacked-tottenham-mark-duggan|work=The Guardian|accessdate=6 August 2011|location=London|date=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{main article|Death of Mark Duggan}}

On Thursday 4 August 2011, a police officer shot and killed 29-year-old Mark Duggan during an intelligence-led, targeted vehicle stop procedure on the Ferry Lane bridge next to [[Tottenham Hale station]].{{refn|&lt;ref name=bbc2nd /&gt;&lt;ref name=Laville07 /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-Mark-Duggan"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Mark Duggan shooting: Bullets results 'within 24 hours'|publisher=BBC|date=8 August 2011|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14443311}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44091979/ns/world_news-europe|title=Soul searching lies ahead as UK riots cool|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] (IPCC) said that the planned arrest was part of [[Operation Trident (Metropolitan Police)|Operation Trident]], which at that time investigated gun crime within the [[Black British|black community]].&lt;ref name="guardian-06-duggan" /&gt; The incident had been referred to the IPCC,&lt;ref name=bbc2nd&gt;{{cite news|title=Man dead and police officer hurt in Tottenham shooting|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14412752|publisher=BBC News|date=5 August 2011|accessdate=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is standard practice if death or serious injury follows police contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What does the IPCC do? |url=http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/en/Pages/what_do.aspx |publisher=Independent Police Complaints Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the shooting, the media widely reported that a bullet was found embedded in a police radio, implying that Duggan fired on the police.&lt;ref name=Laville07 /&gt; Friends and relatives of Duggan said that he was unarmed. The police later revealed that initial [[ballistics]] tests on the bullet recovered from the police radio indicate that it was a "very distinct" police issue [[hollow-point bullet]].&lt;ref name=Laville07 &gt;{{cite news|title=Doubts emerge over Duggan shooting as London burns|author=Sandra Laville|author2=Paul Lewis|author3=Vikram Dodd|author4=Caroline Davies|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/07/police-attack-london-burns|newspaper=The Guardian|date=7 August 2011|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gabbatt|first=Adam|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2011/aug/07/tottenham-riots-police-duggan-live#block-44|title=London disturbances – Sunday 7&amp;nbsp;August|work=The Guardian|location=UK|date=4 August 2011|accessdate=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IPCC later stated that a loaded [[Bruni Olympic .380 BBM|Bruni BBM]] [[Starting pistol|blank-firing pistol]], converted to fire live ammunition, was recovered from the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8699857/The-street-code-of-vengeance-that-sparked-the-riots.html|title=The street code of vengeance that sparked the riots|last=Lewis|first=Jason|date=13 August 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=18 August 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23976974-no-evidence-that-mark-duggan-shot-at-police-says-ipcc.do |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120919080804/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23976974-no-evidence-that-mark-duggan-shot-at-police-says-ipcc.do |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 September 2012 |title='No evidence' that Mark Duggan shot at police, says IPCC |date=10 August 2011 |work=London Evening Standard |accessdate=18 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/264057/UK-riots-Mark-Duggan-had-a-loaded-pistol-|title=UK RIOTS: MARK DUGGAN ‘HAD A LOADED PISTOL’|date=10 August 2011|work=Daily Express|accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was wrapped in a sock and there was no evidence that it had been fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Independent Police Complaints Commission has just announced that there is no evidence|work=The Guardian|date=9 August 2011|accessdate=9 August 2011|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2011/aug/09/london-riots-day-four-live-blog#block-63|location=London|first1=Sam|last1=Jones|first2=Matt|last2=Wells|first3=Paul|last3=Owen|first4=Ben|last4=Quinn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 August, the IPCC stated that Duggan did not open fire: "It seems possible that we may have verbally led journalists to [wrongly] believe that shots were exchanged". The bullet that had lodged in an officer's radio is believed to have been an [[overpenetration]], having passed through Duggan's body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/mark-duggan-did-not-fire-his-weapon-at-police/story-e6frg6so-1226111938756 "Mark Duggan did not fire his weapon at police",] ''[[The Australian]]'', 10 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130111160854/http://www.presstv.ir/detail/193718.html "Media misled on Mark Duggan death",] [[Press TV]], 13 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

At lunchtime on 6 August, a meeting was called by police between local community leaders, councillors and members of police advisory groups. In this meeting, police were warned several times that there could possibly be another riot similar to the [[Broadwater Farm riot]] of 1985 if local concerns regarding the death were not addressed.&lt;ref name="channel4ex"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Tottenham in flames as riot follows protest|publisher=Channel 4|location=London|accessdate=16 September 2011|date=19 August 2011|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/could-the-tottenham-riots-have-been-prevented}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcreport"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Stephenson|first=Wesley|title=Tottenham police 'could have stopped riots'|publisher=BBC|location=London|accessdate=16 September 2011|date=25 August 2011|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14646187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 January 2014, a jury at the [[Royal Courts of Justice]] concluded that Duggan was [[Lawful killing|lawfully killed]].

===Protest march===
On Saturday 6 August, a protest was held, initially peacefully, beginning at [[Broadwater Farm]] and finishing at Tottenham police station.&lt;ref name="bolesworth"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bolesworth|first=Sarah|author2=Barry Neild |author3=Peter Beaumont |author4=Paul Lewis |author5=Sandra Laville|title=Tottenham in flames as riot follows protest|work=The Observer|location=London|accessdate=7 August 2011|date=7 August 2011|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/06/tottenham-riots-protesters-police}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protest was organised by friends and relatives of Duggan to demand justice for the family.&lt;ref name="guardian-06-duggan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14423942|title=Tottenham police shooting: Dead man was minicab passenger|publisher=BBC News|date=5 August 2011|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/police-patrol-tottenham-after-riots|title=Tottenham riots are a disgrace, says MP|publisher=Channel 4 |accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group of some 300 people demanded that a senior local police officer come out to speak to them. When Chief Inspector Ade Adelekan arrived, he was met with boos and cries of "murderer", "[[Uncle Tom#Epithet|Uncle Tom]]" and "[[List of ethnic slurs#C|coconut]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/london-riots--one-year-on-owen-jones-commences-a-series-of-special-reports-7965142.html "London riots – one year on: Owen Jones commences a series of special reports", ''The Independent''], 23 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
The crowd stayed in front of the police station hours longer than they originally planned because they were not satisfied with the seniority of the officers available at the time. Rumours that a 16-year-old girl had sustained injuries after attacking police with a champagne bottle began circulating on social media. To date, the girl remains unidentified and the report unconfirmed. However the rumour alone was sufficient to further fuel tensions in the area.&lt;ref name="Guardian-07-peaceful" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jackson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/sep/05/tottenham-riots-police-community "Tottenham riots: missteps in the dance of police and a frustrated community" by Hugh Muir], ''The Guardian'', 5 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

A peaceful march on Saturday 6 August in Tottenham was followed by rioting and looting, first in Tottenham and later in Tottenham Hale Retail Park.&lt;ref name=bbc_timeline&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10321233 |title=England riots: Maps and timeline|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=17 August 2011|date=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rioting occurred shortly after about 120 people marched from the Broadwater Farm estate to Tottenham Police Station via the High Road.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harrowobserver.co.uk/west-london-news/world-uk-news/2011/08/07/eight-officers-hurt-as-riots-erupt-116451-29192283 "Eight officers hurt as riots erupt"], ''Harrow Observer'', 7 August 2011. Retrieved 17 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of news and rumours about the previous evening's disturbances in Tottenham sparked riots during the night of Sunday 7 August in the London districts of Brixton, Enfield, Islington and [[Wood Green]] and in Oxford Circus in the centre of London.&lt;ref name=bbc_timeline/&gt;

[[File:Tottenham riots August 6th.jpg|thumb|left|Rioters facing police on the evening of 6 August 2011]]
The morning of Monday 8 August was quiet, but by evening, areas across London were affected by widespread looting, arson and violence, with significant outbreaks in parts of Battersea, Brixton, Bromley, Camden, Croydon, Ealing, East Ham, Hackney, Harrow, Lewisham, Peckham, Stratford, Waltham Forest, Woolwich, and Wood Green. A man was found shot in Croydon, and died later in hospital. Another man who had been assaulted in Ealing died in hospital on Thursday 11 August.

Similar riots were reported outside London – notably in Birmingham, Bristol, Gloucester, Gillingham and Nottingham.&lt;ref name=bbc_timeline/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Just the job to bring riots to capital? |date=18 August 2011 |work=The Scotsman |url=http://www.scotsman.com/opinion/Ross-Martin-Just-the-job.6820832.jp}}{{Dead link|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2011 London riots.jpg|thumb|Rioters attempt to loot a cycle shop in Chalk Farm, Camden]]
Following a greatly increased police presence, London was quiet on Tuesday 9 August, but rioting continued in Nottingham and Birmingham (where, according to the police account, eleven shots were fired at police, including at a police helicopter, and petrol bombs thrown at officers&lt;ref name="WMP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.west-midlands.police.uk/latest-news/appeal.asp?ID=4190 |title=Footage released after shots fired at police in Birmingham disorder |date=20 August 2011 |publisher=[[West Midlands Police]] |accessdate=20 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728114513/http://www.west-midlands.police.uk/latest-news/appeal.asp?id=4190 |archivedate=28 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and spread to Leicester, parts of the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] and to parts of [[Greater Manchester]] and [[Merseyside]] in the north-west of England.&lt;ref name=bbc_timeline/&gt; On Wednesday 10 August, London remained quiet while hundreds of arrests were being made by the police.

Three men were killed in Birmingham in a hit-and-run incident related to the disturbances. Looting and violence continued in two locations around Manchester and Liverpool.&lt;ref name=bbc_timeline/&gt;

==Social media==
[[File:Barclays - 2011 London Looting.jpg|thumb|left|Bank workers in Walthamstow observe the destruction which was caused in the early hours of the morning]]
Throughout the rioting, many of the rioters failed to cover their faces. Some posed for pictures with stolen goods, posting them on social-networking sites.&lt;ref name="Tom de Castella &amp; Caroline McClatchey"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14463452|title=UK riots: What turns people into looters?|accessdate=10 August 2011 | publisher=BBC News|date=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although London employs [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] cameras to monitor crime and large events, reports indicate that citizen footage contributed more to capturing looters in action than the police force.&lt;ref name="London and England riots: CCTV Pictures"&gt;{{cite news|title=London and England riots: CCTV pictures of suspects are released by the police|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/uknews/8690951/London-riots-CCTV-pictures-of-suspects-are-released-by-the-Metropolitan-Police.html|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=9 August 2011|accessdate=2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the CCTV, looters were filmed and photographed with their faces visible. Police forces and investigators used websites like [[Flickr]] to find galleries of the looters to help solve and prevent cases of vandalism and further damage. [[Facebook]] pages were also created to identify looters.&lt;ref name="Citizen Cameras"&gt;{{cite web|last=Popkins|first=Helen|title=Citizen Cameras Capture more Looters than London Cops|url=http://www.technolog.msnbc.msn.com/technology/technolog/citizen-cameras-capture-more-london-looters-cops-121801|work=Blog|publisher=TechnoBlog|accessdate=28 March 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420112134/http://www.technolog.msnbc.msn.com/technology/technolog/citizen-cameras-capture-more-london-looters-cops-121801 |archivedate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several interactive maps were implemented in the [[Google Maps]] website that showed satellite views of what was happening in the streets during the rioting. James Cridland, the managing director of the free media resources, created a Google Map that tracked verified locations of rioting.
[[Channel 4 News]] also had similar maps that progressively tracked the damage in the streets as well.&lt;ref name="Interactive Maps reveal satellite's view of UK Riots"&gt;{{cite web|last=Benedetti|first=Winda|title=Interactive maps reveal satellite's view of UK riots|url=http://www.technolog.msnbc.msn.com/technology/technolog/interactive-maps-reveal-satellites-view-uk-riots-121583|work=Blog|publisher=TechnoBlog|accessdate=27 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508151113/http://www.technolog.msnbc.msn.com/technology/technolog/interactive-maps-reveal-satellites-view-uk-riots-121583|archivedate=8 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; News channels also were able to utilise this public service to capture live footage on the streets and inform citizens of dangerous or crowded areas.

===BlackBerry Messenger===
[[File:Croydon Riots 2011.jpg|thumb|left|Stand-off between rioters and police in Croydon]]
There were reports that the [[BlackBerry Messenger]] service was used by looters to organise their activities, and that inflammatory and inaccurate accounts of Mark Duggan's killing on social media sites may have incited disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/08/london-riots-tottenham-duggan-blog#block-61 |title=London riots – live blog |author=Paul Lewis |date=8 August 2011 |work=The Guardian |location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/aug/08/london-riots-facebook-twitter-blackberry |title=London riots: how BlackBerry Messenger played a key role |author=Josh Halliday |date=8 August 2011 |work=The Guardian |location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=G8AUG2011/&gt; One of the many messages shared between users was the following:

[[File:Tottenham Riot-shops.jpg|thumb|A shop in Tottenham Hale Retail park after the looting]]
[[Research in Motion]] assisted British police in tracking rioters who used BBM, stating, "We comply with the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act]] and co-operate fully with the Home Office and UK police forces."&lt;ref name="garside1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Garside|first=Juliette|title=UK riots: Mobile phone operators help police to identify looters|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/09/uk-riots-mobile-phone-operators|work=The Guardian|accessdate=28 March 2012|date=9 August 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased connectivity among individuals has led to a greater ability to organise and execute massive gatherings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jurgenson|first=N.|title=When atoms meet bits: social media, the mobile web and augmented revolution|journal=Future Internet|year=2012|volume=4|pages=83–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has not occurred only with the riots in England, but with other collective gatherings such as the [[Arab Spring]] and the [[Egyptian revolution of 2011]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chebib|first=Nadine Kassem|author2=Sohail, Rabia Minatullah|title=The reasons social media contributed to the 2011 Egyptian Revolution|journal=International Journal of Business and Management|year=2011|volume=2|issue=3|pages=139–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twitter===
Much like BBM, the mobility of technology shaped the London riots. During the Tottenham riots of 1985, citizens had to head into a public place to voice their message.&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams, Lee|first=William|title=London Riots: Organized via Twitter and Smart phones?|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2087337,00.html|work=Time|date=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, with access to [[Twitter]] as a communication medium, social media was used to rapidly spread messages of the riots.&lt;ref name="Adams"/&gt;

Radio 4 criticised Twitter's contribution to the riots through greed and criminality.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Olivia|title=London Riots: Twitter That Caused Them?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2011/08/08/london-riots-twitter-that_n_920791.html|publisher=The Huffington Post- Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Daily Telegraph'' described Twitter as being an outlet for promoting gang violence.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt; Evidence shows that Twitter is powerful because tweets of individuals were inspired by news content.&lt;ref name="Tonkin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tonkin |first=Emma |author2=Heather D. Pfeiffer |author3=Greg Tourte |title=Twitter, information sharing and the London riots |journal=[[Bulletin of the American Society for Information Science and Technology]] |date=13 January 2012 |volume=38 |issue=2 |doi=10.1002/bult.2012.1720380212 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bult.2012.1720380212/pdf |pages=49–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an article in ''Time'' magazine suggested BlackBerry Messenger was more to blame.&lt;ref name="Adams"/&gt;

During the riots, Twitter accounted for four out of every 170 UK Internet visits on Monday 8 August. In addition, citizens also used Twitter to band together, after the destruction.
The aftermath of the riots resulted in a disrupted city, yet Twitter was further used to maintain peace, with hashtags including "#riotcleanup".&lt;ref name="Tonkin"/&gt; Evidence shows that people were tweeting and re-tweeting news related to the riots, not original content.&lt;ref name="Tonkin"/&gt;

===Mobile phones===
Other than BlackBerry Messenger and social networking sites, mobile phone operators T-Mobile and Orange prioritised police requests for information about the phones that were used to plan the riots that hit British cities. Under the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000|Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act]], phone companies were required to hand over data about the locations calls were made from, the owners of phones, and lists of calls made to and from a particular handset.&lt;ref name="garside1"/&gt;

====Richard Mannington Bowes====
[[File:Springbridge Mews floral tributes.jpg|thumb|right|Floral tributes at the site of the fatal assault. The flowers at the top spell out the word "why".]]
A 68-year-old man, Richard Mannington Bowes, died on 11 August after he was attacked while attempting to stamp out a litter-bin fire in [[Ealing]] on the evening of 8 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ealing riot: Richard Mannington Bowes dies after attack|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14500869|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=11 August 2011|date=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowes was attacked by members of a mob on 8 August 2011, while attempting to extinguish a fire that had been [[arson|deliberately started]] in industrial bins on Spring Bridge Road. The attack inflicted severe head injuries which resulted in a coma. The assault was caught on [[CCTV]] and reportedly filmed on mobile phones by associates of the alleged assailant.&lt;ref name="sun"&gt;[http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3750093/Fire-rages-around-riot-hero-Richard-Bowes.html "He paid a terrible price: Fire rages around riot hero"] by Anthony Price, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''. Retrieved 13 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The attack on Bowes was witnessed by several police officers, but due to the number of rioters they were unable to come to his aid until riot squad officers pushed back the rioters while being attacked to reach Bowes.
A line of officers then held back the rioters as paramedics arrived. Bowes' wallet and phone had been stolen, and police faced difficulty in identifying him. He died of his injuries at [[St Mary's Hospital, London|St Mary's Hospital]] on 11 August 2011 after being removed from life support.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14500869 "Riots: Arrest over death of Richard Mannington Bowes"] [[BBC News]].

A spokesman for the [[10 Downing Street#Prime Minister's Office|Prime Minister's office]] added: "The rioting in Tottenham last night was utterly unacceptable.

The [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|deputy prime minister]] [[Nick Clegg]] said that the riots were "completely unacceptable" and described the rioters as "needless and opportunistic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14443082|title=Nick Clegg: Riots 'completely unacceptable'|publisher=BBC | date=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heralddeparis.com/london-violence-needless-opportunistic-theft/143750 |title=London violence: 'needless opportunistic theft' |publisher=Herald de Paris |date=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

London's mayor, [[Boris Johnson]], who cut short a holiday in Canada to return to the UK on 9 August, said: "I'm appalled at the scenes of violence and destruction in Tottenham"&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt; whilst his deputy [[Kit Malthouse]] told a [[Sky News]] reporter that "criminal elements were to blame for the trouble."&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt;

Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] condemned the "terrible scenes of people looting, vandalising, thieving, robbing" and told rioters "You will feel the full force of the law.

[[Croydon Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Croydon Central]] MP [[Gavin Barwell]] called the damage caused in the London Borough of Croydon "sickening".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Your Local Guardian|title=Riot Fall Out Hits Croydon|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/local/topstories/9183466.LIVE__Riot_fallout_hits_Croydon/|accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a strongly worded criticism of what he deems to be a misplaced "hyper-sensitivity about race", dating back to the [[Macpherson Report]] of 1999, [[Civitas (think tank)|Civitas]] director David Green attributed the reluctance by police to use force to a fear of disciplinary action.

Several countries issued warnings advising caution to travellers visiting the United Kingdom during the riots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/08/10/uk.riots.international.view|first=Barry|last=Neild|title=Libya, Iran revel in mocking Britain over riots|publisher=CNN International|date=10 August 2011|accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German [[far-left politics|far-left]] activists suggested using the riots as a [[role model]] to be applied to their political activities in Germany as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morgenpost.de/berlin/article1727786/London-brennt-wann-folgt-endlich-Berlin.html "London brennt, wann folgt endlich Berlin?"

Commentators likened the riots to the [[Broadwater Farm riot]] of 1985, during which a police officer, [[Death of Keith Blakelock|Keith Blakelock]], was murdered.&lt;ref name=lammy&gt;{{Cite news| last=Lammy|first=David|title=Tottenham riot: The lesson of Broadwater Farm|work=The Guardian|location=London|accessdate=7 August 2011|date=7 August 2011|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/07/tottenham-riot-broadwater-farm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' called the scenes "shameful" and lamented that "[w]ith the London Olympics less than a year away, our reputation is being damaged at the worst moment". It added: "This is anarchy, pure and simple. And it presents a serious threat to life and property."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Be decisive |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/sun_says/244723/The-Sun-Says.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522103135/http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/sun_says/244723/The-Sun-Says.html |archive-date=22 May 2009 |work=The Sun |location=UK |date=9 August 2011 |accessdate=9 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''{{'}}s editorial said: "What we have experienced in London and elsewhere since Saturday night is a wholly new phenomenon: violent disorder whose sole intent is criminal... In such circumstances, there can be only one response if the law-abiding majority is to be protected: the thugs must be taught to respect the law of the land the hard way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The criminals who shame our nation|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/telegraph-view/8691352/The-criminals-who-shame-our-nation.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=UK|date=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Telegraph'' also reported: "Tottenham riots: police let gangs run riot and loot: Britain’s biggest police force is facing criticism after it let looters run riot in north London for almost 12 hours..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tottenham riots: police let gangs run riot and loot|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8687540/Tottenham-riots-police-let-gangs-run-riot-and-loot.html|publisher=''The Telegraph'', 7 August 2011|accessdate=27 February 2013|location=London|first=Martin|last=Beckford|date=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' called on the public to back the police: "... Britain's 2011 riots have become a defining contest between disorder and order. In that contest, important caveats notwithstanding, there is only one right side to be on. The attacks, the destruction, the criminality and the reign of fear must be stopped. The rule of law in the cities of Britain must not only be defended against delinquent destruction. It must also be enforced."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Urban riots: The battle for the streets|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/09/urban-riots-battle-streets-editorial|work=The Guardian|location=UK|date=9 August 2011|accessdate=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the height of the riots, ''The Guardian'' was accused of anti-Semitic incitement by the media monitoring organisation, Comment Is Free Watch (CiFW), after Guardian journalist Paul Lewis singled out [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jewish]] residents who were not involved in the rioting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guardian report on London riots omits the race or ethnicity of rioters – but, still mentions Jews|url=http://cifwatch.com/2011/08/08/guardian-report-on-london-riots-omits-the-race-or-ethnicity-of-rioters-but-still-mentions-jews/|publisher=CiF Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The content of his report stated, "The make-up of the rioters was racially mixed. Most were men or boys, some apparently as young as 10….But families and other local residents, including some from Tottenham's Hasidic Jewish community, also gathered to watch and jeer at police." CIFW responded by condemning the newspaper saying, "A 1,800 Guardian report doesn't mention the race, ethnicity, or religion of the rioters, somehow found it pertinent to note that some of those who gathered to jeer police were, allegedly, Hasidic Jews." As a result of the negative publicity, ''The Guardian'' revised the story.&lt;ref name="Guardian-07-peaceful" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Guardian revises story about UK Riots which singled out Hasidic Jews|url=http://cifwatch.com/2011/08/09/the-guardian-revises-story-about-uk-riots-which-singled-out-hasidic-jews/|publisher=CiF Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 9 August leading article, ''[[The Independent]]'' said the police's handling of [[death of Mark Duggan|Mark Duggan's death]] "looks to have been poor", and that there is "context of mistrust of the police here." The paper added that "it is spurious to draw a connection between that disaffection [by the inner-city youth] and specific outbreaks of violence of the sort we have seen in recent days."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leading article: The lessons to be drawn from mindless violence|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/leading-articles/leading-article-the-lessons-to-be-drawn-from-mindless-violence-2333987.html|work=The Independent|location=UK|date=9 August 2011|accessdate=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Hitchens]] of ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' disputed the idea that the events were riots on the basis that they were fundamentally apolitical. He further stated: "This is an equal-opportunity crime wave. The lawbreakers are not from any distinct ethnic group, and attempts to explain this behaviour on these ground are baseless and poisonous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/2011/08/radio-silence.html|title=Radio Silence – Mail Online – Peter Hitchens blog|publisher=Hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk|accessdate=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatrist [[Theodore Dalrymple]] wrote an opinion piece for the ''[[New York Daily News]]'', in which he blamed the "sense of entitlement" that he sees as being common among Britain's youth as a cause for the riots, and said that British youth are today among "the most unpleasant and violent in the world" as a result.&lt;ref name="ny_daniels"&gt;{{cite news|last=Daniels|first=Anthony|title=Behind England's riots, a violent and entitled generation of British young people|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2011/08/10/2011-08-10_behind_englands_riots_a_violent_and_entitled_generation_of_british_young_people.html|work=Daily News|accessdate=12 August 2011|authorlink=Theodore Dalrymple |location=New York |date=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some journalists made comparisons between these riots and the [[2005 civil unrest in France|2005 riots in France]].&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|author=J.

Writing in Pakistan's ''[[Newsline (magazine)|Newsline]]'', Mahir Ali likened the government's response to that of [[Margaret Thatcher]] to the [[1981 England riots]].&lt;ref name="newslinemagazine trying to make sense"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.newslinemagazine.com/2011/09/english-meltdown-trying-to-make-sense-of-the-london-riots/ | title=English Meltdown: Trying to Make Sense of The London Riots | work=[[Newsline (magazine)|Newsline]] | date=13 September 2011 | accessdate=13 September 2011 | author=Ali, Mahir | location=Karachi | quote=There was plenty of breast-beating back then [1981] too, and Thatcher came up with prescriptions remarkably similar to the ones that Cameron has lately been offering.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Race relations====
The ethnic makeup of the rioters varied in different cities: 76% of those arrested in Manchester were white, while 29% were white and 39% black in London, and the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] was the only area where more than 6% were Asian.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Richard Phillips; Frost, Diane; and Singleton, Alex (March 2013). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-4959.2012.00463.x/full "Researching the Riots"], ''The Geographical Journal'', Vol. 179, No. 1:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There has been much speculation about the causes and meanings of the riots that swept through English cities in August 2011...&lt;p&gt;"These disturbances began on 6 August following the police shooting of Mark Duggan, a black resident of Tottenham, North London. Over the following days, they spread within London and to other English cities....&lt;p&gt;"There were no riots in English cities such as Sheffield and Newcastle, and the streets of Welsh and Scottish cities remained equally calm."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18681866 BBC News: "England riots: Who's been prosecuted?"], quoting [[Ministry of Justice]] statistics from June 2012: 89% are listed as male, 53% were twenty or under, and ethnic statistics are given for each area&lt;/ref&gt;

Research conducted by the [[University of Nottingham]] suggested that race relations in Britain deteriorated in the period following the riots and that prejudice towards ethnic minorities increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Matthew|title=British public 'are more prejudiced against minorities after riots'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/sep/05/british-public-prejudiced-minorities-riots|newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 September 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the hit-and-run incident in Birmingham, in which three Asian men were killed by a black driver, racial tensions between blacks and Asians in Birmingham increased; hostilities were defused by the public appeals for an end to violence by Tariq Jahan, father of one of the victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kerrins|first=Suzanne|title=Sir Ian Botham: bring in corporal punishment and ban reality TV to save today's youth|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/news/8786663/Sir-Ian-Botham-bring-in-corporal-punishment-and-ban-reality-TV-to-save-todays-youth.html|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of [[black people|black culture]] were discussed by historian [[David Starkey]] in the edition of the BBC's ''[[Newsnight]]'' TV programme of 12 August. Starkey singled out the influence of black [[gangsta rap|gangster and rap culture]] on youths of all races, contrasting contemporary [[Multicultural London English|youth patois]] with the speech patterns of black Tottenham MP [[David Lammy]], who, Starkey asserted, "sounded white". The author [[Dreda Say Mitchell]] countered his argument by saying that there is no one single "black culture".&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14513517|title='The whites have become black' says David Starkey|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 August 2011|date=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators remarked on the apparently high proportion of black people involved in the riots and took the view that there was a disproportionately high number of rioters who were black, compared to the overall demographics of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="economist-black community"&gt;{{cite news|title=A reckoning – The black community wrestles with the causes of the riots|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21528285|work=The Economist|accessdate=14 November 2011|date=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Ministry of Justice has admitted "the group of people brought before the courts is only a subset of all people who took part in the public disorder". In February 2012 a report was published by the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] providing demographic statistics of the people charged over participation the riots up to 1 February 2012 which revealed that 41% of those brought before the courts identified themselves as being from the White group, 39% from the Black ethnic group, 12% from the Mixed ethnic group, 6% the Asian ethnic group, and 2% the Other ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;Statistical bulletin on the public disorder of 6 to 9 August 2011 – February update&lt;/ref&gt; These figures were disproportionate to the [[Ethnic groups in the United Kingdom|average UK population]];&lt;ref name="ethnicity-moj"&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistical bulletin on the public disorder of 6th–9th August 2011 full report|url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/statistics/criminal-justice-stats/august-public-disorder-stats-bulletin-230212.pdf |publisher=Ministry of Justice|accessdate=26 June 2012|date=24 October 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219082623/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/217805/august-public-disorder-stats-bulletin-230212.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ethnicity-sky"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gangs Had No 'Pivotal Role' In English Riots|url=http://news.sky.com/home/article/16095055|publisher=Sky News|accessdate=13 November 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112122926/http://news.sky.com/home/article/16095055 |archivedate=2012-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the figures revealed varying demographics in different areas when compared to local populations. For example, in [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey]], the figures revealed that 55% of defendants in court over riot-related charges were black, compared to a 17% black population; in [[City of Salford|Salford]], 94% of rioters in court were white, compared to an 88% white population, and 6% of rioters were black, compared to a 2% black population.&lt;ref name="ethnicity-bbc"&gt;{{cite news|title=England rioters 'poorer, younger, less educated'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15426720|accessdate=13 November 2011|publisher=BBC News|date=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, looters from 44 foreign countries were jailed, with Jamaicans representing the largest group.&lt;ref name="ethnicity-star"&gt;{{cite web|title=YOBS NOT TOO ILL TO LOOT|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/view/217426/Yobs-not-too-ill-to-loot/|work=Daily Star|accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry of Justice report also noted that rioters brought before the courts were disproportionately male (89%) and young (53% were aged 20 or under, with the number of "[[Minor (law)|juveniles]]" ranging from 26% in London to 39% in [[Merseyside]], and very few listed as over 40).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18681866 BBC News: "England riots: Who's been prosecuted?"], quoting [[Ministry of Justice]] statistics from June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The Independent'', the costs to the Metropolitan Police of policing the disorder and disturbances in London are expected to exceed £34 million.

====Trials and sentencing====
On 1 September 2011 the BBC reported that official [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] figures showed that of the 1,566 people that had appeared before magistrates on charges connected with the disorder, 1,027 had been in London, 190 in Greater Manchester, 132 in the West Midlands, 67 in Merseyside and 64 in Nottingham.&lt;ref name=BBC1SEP2011&gt;{{cite news |title=England riots: Court appearance total rises above 1,500 |date=1 September 2011 |publisher=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14746229 |accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giving the judgment of the court, the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales]], [[Igor Judge, Baron Judge|Lord Judge]], sitting with Sir John Thomas and [[Brian Leveson|Lord Justice Leveson]], stated that there is "an overwhelming obligation on sentencing courts to do what they can to ensure the protection of the public", that "the imposition of severe sentences, intended to provide both punishment and deterrence, must follow" and that "[t]hose who deliberately participate in disturbances of this magnitude, causing injury and damage and fear to even the most stout-hearted of citizens, and who individually commit further crimes during the course of the riots are committing aggravated crimes". The appeals were dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;Blackshaw, R. v (Rev 1) [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2011/2312.html &lt;nowiki&gt;[2011]&lt;/nowiki&gt; EWCA Crim 2312,] 18 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 April 2012, the Court of Appeal (Lord Judge CJ, [[Peter Openshaw|Openshaw]] &amp; Irwin [[High Court judge (England and Wales)|JJ]]) increased the sentence imposed by the Crown Court at Inner London on Adam Ahmadzai from four years detention to seven years detention for offences of violent disorder, robbery, burglary and criminal damage committed during the riots on 8 August 2011, after a reference from [[Attorney General of England and Wales|Attorney General]], [[Dominic Grieve]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]].&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-17844425 "London riots: Croydon rioter's jail term extended"], BBC News, (25 April 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The Lord Chief Justice stated that the offences were of the "greatest possible seriousness".&lt;ref&gt;J.

===Theatrical===
[[Tricycle Theatre|The Tricycle Theatre]] in Kilburn presented a piece of new writing, ''[[The Riots (2011 play)|The Riots]]'' by [[Gillian Slovo]], which looked into the events over those days in August and the thoughts and opinions of a range of people directly involved and politicians. It transferred to the [[Bernie Grant Arts Centre]] in Tottenham, about 400 m from where the Mark Duggan protest took place, on 5 January 2012, and was due to run until 15 January.
The piece attempts to show a non-biased look into the events, allowing audience members to hear different views into why it happened and what could have and should now be done. The piece includes community leaders Stafford Scott and Martin Sylvester Brown, police constables on duty that night and a former resident of the Carpet-Right building, the burned remains now providing a highly poignant reminder of the events.
They are combined with the views of [[Diane Abbott]], [[Iain Duncan Smith]], [[Michael Gove]] and Pastor Nims Obunge. It was received well by all critics, with 4 stars from all major press including ''The Guardian''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]], [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/nov/23/the-riots-tricycle-review "The Riots – review"].

Australian mod rock band [[The Feldons]] reference the riots in their song London Town from their 2012 album ''Goody Hallett and Other Stories''.

==Suggested contributory factors==
The causes of the 2011 England riots both immediate and long-term have been the subject of media and academic debate. Several speculations have emerged as to what the likely contributory factors might be for the riots; from [[socio-economic]] causes focusing on unemployment and spending cuts, as well as [[social media]], [[gang culture]] and criminal opportunism. The House of Commons Home Affairs select committee will begin examining the police response to the riots in late 2011.
The [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|leader of the Opposition]], [[Ed Miliband]], called for a public inquiry into the wider causes of the riots and has stated that his party would set up such an inquiry if the coalition fails to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|authors=Patrick Wintour, political editor, and James Meikle|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/aug/12/ed-miliband-links-riots-scandals|title=Ed Miliband promises riots inquiry|work=The Guardian|location=UK|accessdate=15 August 2011|date=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK was shaken by its worst riots in decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hounslowandbrentfordtimes.co.uk/uk_national_news/9184613.UK_shaken_by_worst_riots_in_decades/?ref=rss |title=UK shaken by worst riots in decades (from ''Hounslow And Brentford Times'') |publisher=Hounslowandbrentfordtimes.co.uk |date=9 August 2011 |accessdate=24 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412191316/http://www.hounslowandbrentfordtimes.co.uk/uk_national_news/9184613.UK_shaken_by_worst_riots_in_decades/?ref=rss |archivedate=2012-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wide-ranging [[London School of Economics|LSE]] study called ''Reading the Riots'' concluded that the major contributory factors were opportunism, perceived social injustice, deprivation, and frustration at the way communities were policed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Introducing phase two of Reading the Riots: police, victims and the courts|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/01/introducing-phase-two-reading-riots|newspaper=The Guardian|date=1 July 2012|location=London|first1=Paul|last1=Lewis|first2=Tim|last2=Newburn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[YouGov]] poll was carried out on 8–9 August 2011 for ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' asking what those surveyed believed to be the main cause of the riots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.yougov.co.uk/sites/today.yougov.co.uk/files/yg-archives-pol-sun-riots-100811.pdf|title=YouGov/The Sun Survey Results|date=8–9 August 2011|work=today.yougov.co.uk|accessdate=12 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20110811031843/http://today.yougov.co.uk/sites/today.yougov.co.uk/files/yg-archives-pol-sun-riots-100811.pdf|archivedate=11 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, 42% of those polled thought "criminal behaviour" to be the main cause, whilst 26% thought "gang culture" was, 8% thought "government cuts" were, 5% thought "unemployment" was, 5% thought "racial tensions" was and 3% thought "poor policing" was. In a [[ComRes]] poll for the ''Sunday Mirror'' and ''Independent on Sunday'', in which the question was "do you agree or disagree with these statements about the recent riots?", 90% of those polled agreed that the "Police should be allowed {{sic|use|reason="to use water cannon" would be expected}} to water cannon to disperse rioters", 90% agreed that "There is no excuse whatsoever for the violent rioting and looting over the last few days", 61% agreed that "Government ministers failed to return to their desks quickly enough from holidays" and 50% agreed that "The Government's response to the economic crisis (e.g. cuts to services, unemployment, reduced education funding) is helping fuel the rioters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comres.co.uk/polls/Ios_SM_LondonRiots_12thAugust11.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017193956/http://www.comres.co.uk/polls/Ios_SM_LondonRiots_12thAugust11.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 October 2012 |title=London Riots Survey |publisher=ComRes |accessdate=29 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers who study the causes of political instability suggest that the critical common factor is the density of youths. A nation's extent of political unrest, i.e. its vulnerability to riot, war or regime change, is directly associated with the percentage of 15- to 24-year-olds in its population.
They argue that communities with more than 20% of individuals in this age group run the greatest risk of more frequent and more intense political instability. They describe the phenomena as the "[[Youth bulge|youth bulge theory]]", where the "bulge" refers to the fattening of the population pyramid just before the base of the youngest age groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.significancemagazine.org/details/webexclusive/1315481/On-riots-and-youth-bulges.html |title=On riots and youth bulges |work=Significance Magazine |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415203106/http://www.significancemagazine.org/details/webexclusive/1315481/On-riots-and-youth-bulges.html |archivedate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The riots in Tottenham after the death of Mark Duggan were initially blamed on poor relations between the police and the black community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jackson|first=Peter|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14436529|title=London riots: Tensions behind unrest revealed|publisher=BBC|date=7 August 2011|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Over 1,000 Arrested in U.K. as Anger over Inequality, Racism Boils Over into Insurrection|date=10 August 2011|first=Richard|last=Seymour|publisher= DemocracyNow.com|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2011/8/10/over_1_000_arrested_in_uk|accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Gus John]] has argued that the tactical use of frequent "[[stop and search]]", particularly of young black men, has caused resentment of the police in the black community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gZ67UWu3mGjnb3TfN-jVwN77VevQ?docId=CNG.1dbda76336400d092358c2558c36e01d.4e1 |author=Guy Jackson|title=AFP: Depraved or deprived?

According to [[David Lammy]], the MP for Tottenham, the "cracks that already existed between the police and the community became deep fissures".&lt;ref name=lammy /&gt;&lt;ref name="polcl"&gt;{{cite news|title=UK riots: political classes see what they want to see|first=Aditya|last=Chakrabortty|date=10 August 2011|accessdate=12 August 2011|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/10/uk-riots-political-classes|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Guardian''{{'s}} Reading the Riots Survey concluded: "Although rioters expressed a mix of opinions about the disorder, many of those involved said they felt like they were participating in explicitly anti-police riots. They cited 'policing' as the most significant cause of the riots, and anger over the police shooting of Mark Duggan, which triggered initial disturbances in Tottenham, was repeatedly mentioned – even outside London."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/dec/05/anger-police-fuelled-riots-study | location=London | work=The Guardian | first1=Paul | last1=Lewis | first2=Tim | last2=Newburn | first3=Matthew | last3=Taylor | first4=James | last4=Ball | title=Rioters say anger with police fuelled summer unrest | date=5 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social exclusion===
Rioters themselves cited exclusion as a reason for their actions. One person, asked by a journalist if rioting was really the best way to accomplish their objectives, responded: "Yes, because if we weren’t rioting, you wouldn’t be talking to us."&lt;ref name=DN10Aug&gt;Richard Seymour, [[Darcus Howe]], and [[Amy Goodman]], [http://www.democracynow.org/2011/8/10/over_1_000_arrested_in_uk "Over 1,000 Arrested in U.K. as Anger over Inequality, Racism Boils Over into 'Insurrection'"], ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', 10 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Camila Batmanghelidjh]] writing in ''[[The Independent]]'' blames [[social exclusion]] and [[social deprivation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/camila-batmanghelidjh-caring-costs-ndash-but-so-do-riots-2333991.html|title=Camila Batmanghelidjh: Caring costs – but so do riots – Commentators, Opinion|work=The Independent|location=UK|date=9 August 2011|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various journalists have identified poverty and the [[Economic inequality|growing gap between rich and poor]] as causative factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Topping| first = Alexandra|title=Looting 'fuelled by social exclusion' |work=The Guardian|date=8 August 2011|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/08/looting-fuelled-by-social-exclusion|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Ross|first=Monique|title=Blame for riots turns to UK social system|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=10 August 2011|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-08-10/society-role-in-london-riots/2833168?section=world}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=English riots: The return of the underclass|date=11 August 2011|first=Mark|last=Easton|publisher=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14488486|accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a House of Commons debate on the riots Home Secretary [[Theresa May]] stated that the riots were symptomatic of a "wider malaise" including worklessness, illiteracy, and drug abuse but also stated that "Everybody, no matter what their background or circumstances, has the freedom to choose between right and wrong".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/house_of_commons/newsid_9560000/9560113.stm|title=BBC – Democracy Live – In full: MPss debate England riots|publisher=BBC News|date=11 August 2011|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], writing in ''The Observer'', stated that the riots were not caused by a broken society, but due to a group of young, alienated, disaffected youth who are outside the social mainstream and who live in a culture at odds with any canons of proper behaviour; he added that this is found in virtually every developed nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blair|first=Tony|title=Riots Not Caused By Broken Society|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/20/tony-blair-riots-crime-family|accessdate=21 August 2011|location=London|work=The Guardian|date=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Hastings]] of the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' blamed a culture of welfare dependence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Max Hastings|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2024284/UK-riots-2011-Liberal-dogma-spawned-generation-brutalised-youths.html|title=UK riots 2011: Liberal dogma has spawned a generation of brutalised youths|work=Daily Mail|location=UK|accessdate=15 August 2011|date=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A journalist on Al Jazeera suggested a similarity to the disenfranchisement behind the [[Arab Spring]] [[revolutionary wave]] of 2011. Links were made to high youth unemployment and general disenfranchisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2011/08/2011811122931660627.html | title=From the Arab Spring to Liverpool? | work=Aljazeera | date=11 August 2011 | accessdate=20 August 2011 | last=Ryan | first=Yasmin}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by The ''[[Financial Times]]'' published in September 2011 found a strong link between rioting and deprivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/236110aa-d716-11e0-bc73-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1X3nspCJu|title= Rioting link to deprivation revealed|work= [[Financial Times]]|author1=Sally Gainsbury  |author2=Natasha Culzac|date = 4 September 2011|accessdate= 5 September 2011}}{{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family breakdown===
[[Christina Odone]] writing in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' links the riots to a lack of male role models and argues that "Like the overwhelming majority of youth offenders behind bars, these gang members have one thing in common: no father at home."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Odone|first=Cristina|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/cristinaodone/100100154/london-riots-absent-fathers-have-a-lot-to-answer-for|title=London riots: Absent fathers have a lot to answer for|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=9 August 2011|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been linked further with England's having the "worst record in family breakdown in Europe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rioters Are NOT 'Scum'!

===Government cuts===
The spending cuts of the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|coalition government in the United Kingdom]] have also been cited as a cause.{{refn|&lt;ref name="polcl"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/08/08/uk-britain-disorder-idUKTRE7752QX20110808|title= Riots spread on third night of violence|last1=Hemming|first1=Jon|last2=Ambrogi|first2=Stefano |date=8 August 2011|agency=Reuters|accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Croft |first=Adrian |title=Spending cuts, police blamed for London riot |page=B4 |newspaper=The Vancouver Sun |date=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44055812/ns/world_news-europe|title=More than 200 thugs arrested in London riots|publisher=MSN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dlammy"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/07/tottenham-riot-broadwater-farm|author=David Lammy|title=Tottenham riot: The lesson of Broadwater Farm|date=7 August 2011|work=The Guardian|location=UK|accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Somaiya|first=Ravi|title=London Sees Twin Perils Converging to Fuel Riot|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/08/world/europe/08britain.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|newspaper=The New York Times|date=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Ken Livingstone, the Labour Candidate for Mayor of London in 2012 has argued that "The economic stagnation and cuts being imposed by the Tory government inevitably create social division."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labourlist.org/ken-livingstone-statement-on-tottenham-riots|title=Ken Livingstone statement on Tottenham riots|publisher=LabourList.org|date=7 August 2011|accessdate=15 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328123039/http://labourlist.org/2011/08/ken-livingstone-statement-on-tottenham-riots/ |archivedate=2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nick Clegg, the [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] and leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats political party]], made it clear that the government's planned cuts to police budgets will go ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=James Meikle|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/aug/11/nick-clegg-police-funding-cuts-riots|title=Nick Clegg: police funding cuts will not change despite riots|work=The Guardian|location=UK|accessdate=15 August 2011|date=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The local government budget had been cut in the past year so Haringey Council, which includes [[Tottenham]] and [[Tottenham Hale]], decided to close eight of its 13 youth clubs in 2011, rather than save money through increased efficiency or make cuts in other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/opinion/news-analysis/rolling-back-the-state-only-fans-the-flames-16037110.html#ixzz1VH2JqmoJ |title=Rolling back the state only fans the flames |work=The Belfast Telegraph |accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/13/hackney-riots-youth-clubs-closure?intcmp=239 "Hackney riots: 'The message when youth clubs close is that no one cares'"], ''The Observer''. Retrieved 17 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scrapping of the [[Education Maintenance Allowance]], removing of funding for courses where the student already has an equal or lower level qualification and trebling of university tuition fees, combined with high youth unemployment has placed the British youth "between a rock and a hard place" alienating and angering the youth population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Young people have no right to riot, but they have a right to be angry|last=Lloyd|first=Saci|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/18/riot-young-people-a-level-school|newspaper=The Guardian|date=18 August 2011|accessdate=20 August 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this argument say that Scottish youth did not riot partly because Scottish students do not have to pay tuition fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=A society that is slipping into Dickensian darkness|last=Macwhirter|first=Iain |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/mobile/comment/iain-macwhirter/a-society-that-is-slipping-into-dickensian-darkness-1.1118346|work=The Herald|location=Glasgow |date=18 August 2011|accessdate=20 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930190349/http://www.heraldscotland.com/comment/columnists/a-society-that-is-slipping-into-dickensian-darkness.14772416 |archivedate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Lammy]] MP has said that Tottenham has the highest unemployment rate in London and the eighth highest in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Lammy|title=Response to the Comprehensive Spending Review|accessdate=25 February 2011|url=http://www.davidlammy.co.uk/Respond_to_the_Comprehensive_Spending_Review|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725225202/http://www.davidlammy.co.uk/Respond_to_the_Comprehensive_Spending_Review|archivedate=25 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of people chasing every one job vacancy in Haringey has been put at 23 and 54 in separate reports, and fears had spread of disorder after youth club closures in recent months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Alex|last=Goy|title=The toughest places to get a job in the UK: 6.

===Rioting for fun===

Other academics have pointed to more prosaic causes of the 2011 riots, citing the [[carnivalesque]] atmospheres created through the usual uses of urban space. For example, researchers from the [[University of Birmingham]] noted that ‘another sound could be heard above the mêlée, that of laughter. Above the bark of police dogs, and behind the masked and hooded faces of the throng, were smiles, laughter, and shrieks of joy.’&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com.ezproxyd.bham.ac.uk/doi/abs/10.1080/09627251.2012.670998 "Panic on the streets of Birmingham? Struggles over space and belonging in the Revanchist City"], in ''Justice Matters'', Vol. 87, No. 1 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gang culture===
In a ''[[Newsnight]]'' discussion on 12 August, historian [[David Starkey]] blamed black gangster culture, saying that it had influenced youths of all races.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; The BBC received nearly 700 complaints about his statement that the "whites have become black".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-14542240 | publisher=BBC News | title=Hundreds complain about David Starkey's race comments | date=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cottrell-Boyce, writing in the Youth Justice journal, argued that gangs were constructed as a 'suitable enemy' by politicians and the media, obscuring the wider, structural and economic roots of youth violence.&lt;ref name="Cottrell-Boyce"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cottrell-Boyce|first=Joseph|title=Ending Gang and Youth Violence: A Critique|journal=Youth Justice|date=December 2013|volume=13|issue=3|pages=193–206|url=http://yjj.sagepub.com/content/13/3/193.abstract|accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criminal opportunism===
During the riots, on 9 August 2011, UK Home Secretary [[Theresa May]] said: "I think this is about sheer criminality. That is what we have seen on the streets. The violence we've seen, the looting we've seen, the thuggery we've seen – this is sheer criminality, and let's make no bones about it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rioting spirals out of control |date=8 August 2011 |work=London Evening Standard |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23976590-rioting-spirals-out-of-control.do |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120604014910/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23976590-rioting-spirals-out-of-control.do |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Hobbs, London correspondent for [[One News (New Zealand)|One News]] said that looters are not politically motivated and called the riots "recreational violence".&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web|title=UK riots: 16,000 police on London streets|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/world-news/london-riots-military-could-brought-in-4343698|date=9 August 2011|work=TVNZ|accessdate=9 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811182640/http://tvnz.co.nz/world-news/london-riots-military-could-brought-in-4343698 |archivedate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Manchester rioter said to a BBC correspondent: "Every time I go into town I just think how the shops got smashed up in 2011 by all of us, I just laugh about it every time I go back in now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/9572763.stm|title= Rioters revel in thrill of seizing Manchester streets|publisher=BBC News - ''Newsnight|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC reported that the Chief Constable of West Midlands Police had stated that he thought that the motivation for rioters targeting the city centre was not anger, but greed.&lt;ref name="greed"&gt;{{cite news |title=How rioting spread around England |publisher=BBC News |date=9 August 2011 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14466477 |accessdate=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral decay at the top===
''Daily Telegraph'' columnist [[Peter Oborne]] suggested that moral decay is just as bad at the top of society as it is at the bottom, with the rich and powerful generating anger among the British population. He cited the [[United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal|MPs' expenses scandal]], [[bankers' bonuses]], and [[News International phone hacking scandal|the phone hacking scandal]] as setting poor examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=The moral decay of our society is as bad at the top as the bottom |last=Oborne |first=Peter |url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/peteroborne/100100708/the-moral-decay-of-our-society-is-as-bad-at-the-top-as-the-bottom|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=11 August 2011 |accessdate=20 August 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Financial Times]]'' cartoonist Ingram Pinn depicted a Union Flag being broken through by a looter in a [[hoodie]] carrying a stolen box of Adidas trainers, preceded by two men in suits carrying piles of cash, one saying "MP's Expenses" and another "Banker's Bonus".&lt;ref&gt;[http://domesticempire.wordpress.com/2011/08/16/broken-britain-riots/ "Broken Britain Riots"], 16 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Failure of the penal system===
[[Kenneth Clarke]], the [[Lord Chancellor]] and [[Secretary of State for Justice]], writing in ''The Guardian'', described the riots in part as "an outburst of outrageous behaviour by the criminal classes". He drew attention to the statistic that almost three-quarters of the adults who had been charged with offences related to the disorder already had a criminal record.
Clarke characterised this as the legacy of "a broken penal system", one that did not have a good record for preventing reoffending. He stated he is proposing radical new measures intended to focus on robust punishment and on delivering reductions in reoffending.&lt;ref name=G5SEP2011&gt;{{cite news |title=Punish the feral rioters, but address our social deficit too |author=Kenneth Clarke |date=5 September 2011 |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/sep/05/punishment-rioters-help |accessdate=6 September 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mainstream media relationship with the communities===
A conference held in November 2012 and its subsequent report by Dr Leah Bassel of the [[University of Leicester]], entitled ''Media and the Riots – A Call For Action'', examined the relationship between mainstream media and communities affected by the riots.{{vague|date=October 2013}}{{elucidate|date=October 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;Roy Greenslade, , [https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2012/jul/31/london-riots-universityofleicester "What the media did wrong in the riots – and how to put it right"], Greenslade Blog, ''The Guardian'', 31 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marc Wadsworth]], [http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/media-coverage-2011-riots-was-disgraceful "Media Coverage Of 2011 Riots 'Was Disgraceful'"], ''The Voice'', 10 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-latest.com/riots-and-media-report "Special report about media and the riots"], The-Latest.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebrity involvement==
[[Jamie Waylett]], who played Vincent Crabbe in the ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'' film series, was charged and sentenced for his participation in the riots.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-17449630|title=London riots: Harry Potter actor Jamie Waylett jailed|work=BBC News|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was photographed drinking out of a bottle of stolen champagne, as well as holding a petrol bomb in Camden on the third day of rioting and violence.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt; He was given a two-year sentence for violence and [[handling stolen goods]].&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt;

'''Abibus of Edessa''' (Habibus)(c.307-322), also known as Abibus the New, was a [[Christian]] [[Deacon]] who was [[martyr]]ed at [[Edessa, Mesopotamia]] under Emperor [[Licinius]]. The emperor ordered to arrest Abibus for his zealous spreading of the Christianity. Abibus appeared in front of his executioners not wanting any Christian to have been suffered during his searching.&lt;ref name="orthodoxy"&gt;[https://stjohndc.org/en/orthodoxy-foundation/saints/holy-martyrs-and-confessors-gurias-samonas-and-abibus-edessa/ Holy Martyrs and Confessors Gurias, Samonas and Abibus, of Edessa] Retrieved on 20 Feb 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

He was sentenced to be [[execution by burning|burned at the stake]]. The martyr entered the fire himself. After the flames were extinguished his body was found undamaged by his mother and relatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://orthochristian.com/108692.html/ MARTYRS AND CONFESSORS GURIAS AND SAMONAS, AND ABIBUS, OF EDESSA] Retrieved on 20 Feb 2018&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Synaxaristes, Christians took his relics and buried them with those of the fellow martyrs [[November 15 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|Gurias and Samonas]]. With [[November 15 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|Gurias and Samonas]], he is venerated as one of the "avengers of unfulfilled contracts". He was buried in Syria in 322

His individual [[feast day]] is September 2 in the old Syrian martyrology and November 2 in the Eastern Orthodox church.&lt;ref&gt;Great Synaxaristes: (Greek) Ὁ Ἅγιος Ἄβιβος ὁ Μάρτυρας ὁ νέος. 2 Δεκεμβρίου. ΜΕΓΑΣ ΣΥΝΑΞΑΡΙΣΤΗΣ.]&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the Roman Catholic Church he is celebrated on November 15, with [[November 15 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|Gurias and Samonas]].

The '''alligator gar''' (''Atractosteus spatula'') is a [[ray-finned]] [[euryhaline]] fish related to the [[bowfin]] in the [[infraclass]] [[Holostei]] {{IPAc-en|h|oʊ|ˈ|l|ɒ|s|t|i|ai}}. It is the largest species in the [[gar]] family, and among the largest freshwater fishes in [[North America]]. The [[fossil record]] traces its existence back to the [[Early Cretaceous]] over a hundred million years ago.   

Gars are often referred to as "[[primitive fishes]]", or "[[living fossils]]" because they have retained some [[Morphological (biology)|morphological]] characteristics of their earliest ancestors, such as a [[spiral valve]] intestine which is also common to the digestive system of [[sharks]], and the ability to breathe both air and water.  Their common name was derived from their resemblance to  the American [[alligator]], particularly their broad snout and long, sharp teeth.  [[Anecdotal evidence]] in several scientific reports suggest that an alligator gar can grow up to {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} in length, but in 2011, the largest alligator gar ever caught and officially recorded was {{Convert|8|ft|5+1/4|in|abbr=on}} long, weighed {{Convert|327|lb|abbr=on}}, and was {{Convert|47|in|cm|abbr=on}} around the girth.

The body of an alligator gar is torpedo-shaped, usually brown or olive fading to a lighter gray or yellow [[ventral]] surface. Their scales are not like the scales of other fishes; rather, they are [[ganoid scale]]s which are bone-like, diamond-shaped scales, often with serrated edges, and covered by an enamel-like substance. Ganoid scales are nearly impenetrable and are excellent protection against predation. Unlike other gar species, the upper jaw of an alligator gar has a dual row of large, sharp teeth which are used to impale and hold prey.  Alligator gar are stalking, ambush [[Predation|predators]], primarily [[piscivores]], but they will also ambush and eat [[water fowl]] and small [[mammal]]s they find floating on the water's surface.

Populations of alligator gar have been [[Local extinction|extirpated]] from much of their historic range as a result of habitat destruction, indiscriminate [[culling]], and unrestricted harvests.  Populations are now located primarily in the southern portions of the [[United States]] extending into [[Mexico]]. They are considered [[euryhaline]] because they can adapt to varying salinities ranging from [[freshwater lake]]s and [[swamp]]s to [[brackish marsh]]es, [[estuary|estuaries]], and [[bay]]s along the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

For nearly a half-century, alligator gar were considered "trash fish",&lt;ref name=FWS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/natchitoches/Newsletters/August%20%202013.pdf|publisher=US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service|title=Fleur De Lis Fisheries|author =Brady, Tony |page=2|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a "nuisance species" detrimental to [[sportfish|sport fisheries]], so were targeted for elimination by state and federal authorities in the United States.  The 1980s brought a better understanding of the ecological balance necessary to sustain an ecosystem,&lt;ref name="Milbrath"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oe6mPrxnvdIC&amp;pg=PA271 | title=Envisioning a Sustainable Society: Learning Our Way Out | publisher=SUNY Press | author=Milbrath, Lester W. | year=1989 | page=271 | isbn=9780791401620}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually an awareness that alligator gar were no less important than any other living organism in the [[ecosystem]]s they inhabit.&lt;ref name="WarmSpringsNFH"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fws.gov/warmsprings/fishhatchery/species/alligatorgar.html | title=Alligator Gar, Atractosteus spatula | publisher=US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service | work=Warm Springs National Fish Hatchery | date=February 5, 2013 | accessdate=July 7, 2014 | author=Echevarria, Carlos}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over time, alligator gar were afforded some protection by state and federal resource agencies.  They are also protected under the [[Lacey Act]] which makes it illegal to transport certain species of fish in [[interstate commerce]] when in violation of [[state law]] or regulation.  Several state and federal resource agencies are monitoring populations in the wild, and have initiated outreach programs to educate the public.  Alligator gar are being [[aquaculture|cultured]] in ponds, pools, [[Raceway (aquaculture)|raceways]], and tanks by federal [[hatchery|hatcheries]] for mitigation stocking, by universities for research purposes, and in Mexico for consumption.&lt;ref name="UAEX"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://aqfi.uaex.edu/people/faculty/slochmann/pages/New-Research/Default.htm | title=New Research | publisher=University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff | work=Aquaculture and Fisheries Center | accessdate=June 18, 2014 |author1=Lochmann, S.E. |author2=Baker, Brandon W. |author3=Rachels, Kyle T. |author4=Timmons, Brett A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alligator gar are the largest species in the gar family, and among the largest freshwater fishes found in North America.  Mature alligator gar commonly measure {{Convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on}} in length, and weigh over 100&amp;nbsp;lb (45&amp;nbsp;kg).  However, anecdotal reports suggest they can grow up to 10&amp;nbsp;ft (3 m) in length, and weigh as much as 350&amp;nbsp;lb (159&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref name=FLMNH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/natsci/ichthyology/gallery/Descript/AlligatorGar/AlligatorGar.html|publisher=FLMNH Ichthyology Department|title=Alligator Gar|author =Goddard, Nathaniel |accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The largest alligator gar officially recorded was inadvertently caught in the net of fisherman Kenny Williams of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]], while he was fishing the [[oxbow lake]]s of the [[Mississippi River]] on February 14, 2011.  Williams was pulling up his net on Lake Chotard expecting to find [[buffalo fish]], but instead discovered a large alligator gar tangled in his net.  The gar was {{Convert|8|ft|5+1/4|in|abbr=on}} long, weighed {{Convert|327|lb|abbr=on}}, and its girth was {{Convert|47|in|cm|abbr=on}}. According to wildlife officials, the fish was estimated to be between 50 and 70 years old; one report estimated the gar's age to be at least 95.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tpwd.texas.gov/huntwild/wild/species/alg/ | title=Alligator Gar (Atractosteus spatula) | publisher=Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife Department | accessdate=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Williams donated it to the [[Mississippi Museum of Natural Science]] in [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], where it will remain on display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wapt.com/Vicksburg-Man-Catches-327-Lb-Alligator-Gar/-/9157628/5991148/-/iqeqgv/-/index.html |title=Vicksburg Man Catches 327 Lb.

All gars have torpedo-shaped bodies, but some distinguishing characteristics of adult alligator gar include their large size; heavy bodies; broad heads; short, broad snouts; large, sharp teeth; and double row of teeth on their upper jaws.  They are usually brown or olive fading to a lighter gray or yellow [[ventral]] surface.  The [[Dorsal fin|dorsal]] and [[anal fin]]s are positioned toward the back of their bodies, and their [[caudal fin]]s are abbreviate-[[heterocercal]], or nonsymmetrical.&lt;ref name=FLMNH/&gt;

==Physiology==
Alligator gar have [[gill]]s, but unlike other species of fish, with few exceptions, they also have a highly [[vascularized]] [[swim bladder]] lung that supplements gill respiration.&lt;ref name=Tyus&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3B-PAfeyqbIC&amp;pg=PA46| title=Ecology and Conservation of Fishes | publisher=CRC Press | author=Tyus, Harold M. | year=2011 | page=46 | isbn=9781439858547}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bladder not only provides buoyancy, but also enables them to breathe in air, which is why they are able to inhabit bodies of water in which most other fishes would die of [[suffocation]].  The swim bladder is connected to their fore gut by a small [[pneumatic duct]] which allows them to breathe or gulp air when they break the surface,&lt;ref name="WaEDU"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://courses.washington.edu/fish311/FISH%20311%20files/05-Swimbladder.pdf | title=Biology of Fishes-Fish/Biol 311 | publisher=University of Washington | work=Swimbladder | accessdate=August 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; an action seen quite frequently on lakes in the [[Southern United States]] during the hot summer.

The scales of alligator gar are not like the scales of other fishes which have flexible [[elasmoid scale]]s; their bodies are protected by inflexible and articulated [[Ganoid scale|ganoid]] scales that are diamond-shaped, often with serrated edges, and composed of a tough inner layer of bone and hard outer layer of [[ganoin]] which is essentially homologous to tooth enamel, making them nearly impenetrable.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/09/how-enamel-coats-your-teeth-evolved | title=How The Enamel That Coats Your Teeth Evolved | last=Perkins | first=Sid | publisher=AAAS | date=September 23, 2015 | accessdate=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-09-24/tooth-enamel-may-have-evolved-from-ancient-fish-scales/6801938 | title=Tooth Enamel May Have Evolved From Ancient Fish Scales | publisher=ABC Science | date=September 24, 2015 | accessdate=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JTRS&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sherman|first=Vincent R.|last2=Yaraghi|first2=Nicholas A.|last3=Kisailus|first3=David|last4=Meyers|first4=Marc A.|date=2016-12-01|title=Microstructural and geometric influences in the protective scales of Atractosteus spatula|url=http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/13/125/20160595|journal=Journal of The Royal Society Interface|language=en|volume=13|issue=125|pages=20160595|doi=10.1098/rsif.2016.0595|issn=1742-5689|pmid=27974575|pmc=5221522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy and evolution==
[[Bernard Germain Étienne comte de La Ville-sur-Illon La Cépède|Lacépède]] first described the alligator gar in 1803. The original name was ''[[Lepisosteus spatula]]'', but was later changed by E.O. Wiley in 1976 to ''Atractosteus spatula''  to recognize two distinct [[extant taxon|taxa]] of gars.  Synonyms of ''Atractosteus spatula'' include ''Lesisosteus'' [sic] ''ferox'' (Rafinesque 1820), and ''Lepisosteus spatula'' (Lacepede 1803). Fossils from the order [[Lepisosteiformes]] have been collected in [[Europe]] from the [[Cretaceous]] to [[Oligocene]] periods, in Africa and India from the Cretaceous, and in North America from the Cretaceous to recent times.  The Lepisosteidae are the only extant family of gars which has seven species, all located in North and [[Central America]].&lt;ref name=FLMNH/&gt;  The [[fossil record]] traces the existence of alligator gar back to the [[Early Cretaceous]] over a hundred million years ago.&lt;ref name=ResearchGate&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259462324_Effects_of_salinity_on_growth_and_ion_regulation_of_juvenile_alligator_gar_Atractosteus_spatula|publisher=Mississippi State University Dept. of Wildlife, Fisheries and Aquaculture|title=Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

==Feeding behavior==
Alligator gar are relatively passive, seemingly sluggish solitary fish, but voracious [[ambush predator]]s.  They are opportunistic night predators and are primarily [[piscivores]], but they also ambush and eat [[water fowl]] and small [[mammal]]s that may be floating on the surface.  Their method of ambush is to float a few feet below the surface, and wait for unsuspecting [[prey]] to swim within reach.  They lunge forward, and with a sweeping motion, grab their prey, impaling it on their double rows of sharp teeth.&lt;ref name=Earthwave/&gt;

Diet studies have shown alligator gar to be opportunistic piscivores, and even [[scavenger]]s depending on the availability of their preferred food source. They occasionally ingest sport fish, but the majority of stomach content studies suggest they feed predominately on [[forage fish]]es such as [[gizzard shad]] and [[invertebrate]]s and water fowl.  Diet studies have also revealed fishing tackle and boat-engine parts in their stomachs.&lt;ref name=MDC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdafs.org/alligar/docs/Missouri%20Alligator%20Gar%20Management%20and%20Restoration%20Plan.pdf|title=Missouri Alligator Gar Management and Restoration Plan|publisher=Missouri Department of Conservation Fisheries Division|date=January 22, 2013|accessdate=August 1, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506052518/http://sdafs.org/alligar/docs/Missouri%20Alligator%20Gar%20Management%20and%20Restoration%20Plan.pdf|archivedate=May 6, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TPWDgar"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/publications/nonpwdpubs/media/gar_status_073108.pdf | title=Life History and Status of Alligator Gar (Atractosteus spatula), with Recommendations for Management | publisher=Texas Parks and Wildlife Department | work=Heart of Hills Fisheries Science Center | date=July 31, 2008 | accessdate=July 7, 2014 | author=Buckmeier, David L. | page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spawning==
As with most ancestral species, alligator gar are long-lived, and sexually late maturing.  Most females do not reach sexual maturity until after their first decade of life, while males reach sexual maturity in half that time.  The conditions must be precise for a successful spawning to occur.  Preparation for spawning begins in the spring with the extended [[photoperiodism|photoperiod]] and rising water temperatures, but flooding is also necessary to trigger the event.  When rivers rise and spread over the floodplain, they create [[oxbow lake]]s and [[Slough (hydrology)|sloughs]], and inundate terrestrial vegetation, which in turn provides protection and a nutrient-rich habitat for [[larval fish]] and [[Fish (fry)|fry]].  Once the water temperature has reached {{convert|68|to|82|F|C}}, and all the other criteria are met, gar move into the grassy, weed-laden shallows to spawn.&lt;ref name="TCEQ"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tceq.state.tx.us/assets/public/permitting/watersupply/water_rights/eflows/20091124snbbest_biologicoverlaydraft.pdf | title=BBest Recommendations Report | work=Sabine/Neches BBest Biological Overlay Approach | date=November 2, 2009 | accessdate=July 7, 2014 | publisher=Best Biological Subcommittee, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, U.S. | page=8 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924113434/http://www.tceq.state.tx.us/assets/public/permitting/watersupply/water_rights/eflows/20091124snbbest_biologicoverlaydraft.pdf | archive-date=September 24, 2015 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chron&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Houston Chronicle|url=http://www.chron.com/sports/outdoors/article/Once-a-nuisance-alligator-gar-increasingly-5333046.php|title=Once a nuisance, alligator gar increasingly protected|author =Thompkins, Shannon |date=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actual spawning occurs when males gather around [[gravid]] females, and begin writhing, twisting, bumping into and slithering over the tops of females, an activity which triggers the release of eggs.  Males release clouds of [[milt]] to fertilize the eggs as they are released into the water column.&lt;ref name="TCEQ"/&gt;  The sticky eggs then attach to submerged vegetation, and development begins.  Only a few days are needed  for the eggs to hatch into larval fish, and another 10 days or so for the larval fish to detach from the vegetation and start moving about as young fry.&lt;ref name=Chron/&gt; Egg production is variable, and believed to be dependent on the size of the female.  A common formula used for predicting the volume of eggs a female can produce is 4.1 eggs/gram of body weight, which gives an average of about 150,000 eggs per spawn.  The eggs of alligator gar are bright red and poisonous to humans if ingested.&lt;ref name=Earthwave/&gt;

==Distribution==
[[File:Alligator gar.jpg|thumb|250px|Alligator gar caught in Moon Lake, Mississippi, March 1910]]

===Natural range===
Alligator gar inhabit a wide variety of [[aquatic habitat]]s, but most are found in the Southern United States in reservoirs and lakes, in the backwaters of lowland rivers, and in the [[brackish water]]s of estuaries, bayous, and bays. They have occasionally been seen in the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;ref name=Earthwave/&gt; In Texas and Louisiana, large gars are commonly seen breaking the surface in reservoirs, bayous, and brackish marshes. They are found throughout the lower Mississippi River Valley and Gulf Coast states of the Southern United States and Mexico as far south as [[Veracruz]], encompassing these states:  Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Florida, and Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdafs.org/alligar/index.html |title=Alligator Gar Technical Committee |publisher=Southern Division of the American Fisheries Society |accessdate=May 17, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104045227/http://www.sdafs.org/alligar/index.html |archivedate=November 4, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports suggest alligator gar were once numerous throughout much of their northern range, but valid sightings today are rare, and may occur once every few years.&lt;ref name=FLMNH/&gt; Records of historical distribution indicate alligator gar once inhabited regions as far north as central Kansas, Nebraska, Ohio, Iowa, and west-central Illinois, where they are now listed as [[Local extinction|extirpated]].  The most northerly verified catch was in [[Meredosia, Illinois]], in 1922.&lt;ref name="il-acad-sci.org"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Poly |first=William J. |year=2001 |url=http://www.calacademy.org:8080/sites/default/files/assets/ibss/departments/ichthyology/poly_2001_tisas.pdf |title=Distribution of the Alligator Gar, Atractosteus spatula (Lacépède, 1803), in Illinois |journal=Transactions of the Illinois State Academy of Science |volume=94 |issue=3 |pages=185–190 |access-date=July 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809122049/http://www.calacademy.org:8080/sites/default/files/assets/ibss/departments/ichthyology/poly_2001_tisas.pdf |archive-date=August 9, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Now, efforts to reintroduce alligator gar between Tennessee and Illinois are being made as part of an effort to control invasive [[Asian carp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Webber|first1=Tammy|title=Huge, once-hated fish now seen as weapon against Asian carp|url=http://www.pantagraph.com/news/state-and-regional/huge-once-hated-fish-now-seen-as-weapon-against-asian/article_471ed568-2b6f-583d-b5c9-0b490a9d48e5.html|accessdate=July 31, 2016|work=Pantagraph|agency=Associated Press|date=July 29, 2016}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outside natural range===
A few notable sightings of alligator gar have been reported outside North America.  In November 2008, a
broadhead gar, genus ''Atractosteus'', measuring {{convert|5.2|to|6.4|ft|abbr=on}} was caught in the [[Caspian Sea]] north of [[Esenguly]], [[Turkmenistan]], by two officials of Turkmenistan Fishery Protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cawater-info.net/ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=495:hazar-dezini-tuerkmen-kenarynda-amerikan-sowutly-cortany-tutulmagyny-ilkinji-wakasy&amp;catid=43:news-turkmen&amp;Itemid=37 |title=Hazar deňziniň türkmen kenarynda amerikan sowutly çortanyň tutulmagynyň ilkinji wakasy |publisher=Türkmenistanyň Tebigaty goramak ministrligi |language=Turkmen |accessdate=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its species is unconfirmed, but is believed to be an alligator gar.&lt;ref name=ERJ&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1134/S2075111711030118|publisher=Springer|work=Erratum to: "First Finding of Gar ''Atractosteus'' sp.

On September 4, 2009, a {{convert|3|ft|3|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} alligator gar was found in Tak Wah Park in [[Tsuen Wan]], [[Hong Kong]]. Over the next two days, at least 16 other alligator gar,  the largest measuring {{Convert|4.9|ft|abbr=on}}, were found in ponds in public parks in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=ABS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/classified-odd/09/07/09/monster-exotic-fish-found-hong-kong-ponds|title=Monster Exotic Fish Found In Hong Kong Ponds|publisher=ABS-CBN News|date=September 5, 2009|accessdate=July 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearby residents reported the alligator gar had been released into the ponds by [[aquarium]] hobbyists, and had lived there for several years.  However, after a complaint made by a citizen who falsely identified alligator gar as [[crocodile]]s, the use of terms like "horrible man-eating fish" had begun appearing in the headlines of some major local newspapers.  Officials with Leisure and Cultural Services in Tak Wah Park removed all the alligator gar from the ponds because they were concerned the large, carnivorous fish might harm children.&lt;ref name=SCMP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/703297/feared-public-ponds-admired-behind-glass|publisher=South China Morning Post|title=Feared in public ponds, admired behind glass|author =Nip, Amy |date=January 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Not unusually, the large, sharp teeth and outward appearance of alligator gar can precipitate unreasonable fear in those unfamiliar with the species. Sensationalized reports have contributed to the misconception of predatory attacks by alligator gar on humans, though none of the reports has been confirmed.&lt;ref name=SMSUP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.semopress.com/when-gars-attack/|publisher=Southeast Missouri State University|title=When Gars Attack|author =Spitzer, Mark|accessdate=July 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 21, 2011, an alligator gar measuring {{convert|4|ft|11|in|abbr=on}} was caught in a canal in [[Pasir Ris]], [[Singapore]], by two recreational fishermen. The fish was taken to a nearby pond, where the owner confirmed it was an alligator gar rather than an [[arapaima]] as the men had initially thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/this-urban-jungle/friends-catch-15m-monster-fish-from-pasir-ris-canal-after-long-struggle |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220120342/http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/this-urban-jungle/friends-catch-15m-monster-fish-from-pasir-ris-canal-after-long-struggle |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 20, 2016 |title=Friends Catch 1.5m 'Monster' Fish From Pasir Ris Canal After Long Struggle |work=The Straits Times |date=January 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anecdotal reports have been made of alligator gar captured in various parts of India, but are believed to be the result of incidental releases by aquarium hobbyists and the like.  In August 2015, an alligator gar was found entangled in cloth inside a well in [[Dadar]], where it had been living for quite some time. It was rescued by animal activists and returned to the well unharmed.&lt;ref name=Singh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Exotic-Alligator-Gar-fish-rescued-in-Dadar/articleshow/48379367.cms | title=Exotic Alligator Gar fish rescued in Dadar | publisher = Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co.

==Human uses==

===Early history===
[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in the south, and [[Caribbean people]]s used the alligator gar's [[Ganoid|ganoid scales]] for arrow heads, breastplates, and as shielding to cover plows.  [[European colonization of the Americas|Early settlers]] [[Tanning (leather)|tanned]] the skins to make a strong, durable leather to cover their wooden plows, and make purses and various other items.  Gar oil was also used by the people of Arkansas as a repellent for buffalo gnats.&lt;ref name=MDC/&gt;

For nearly half a century, alligator gar were considered "trash fish",&lt;ref name=FWS/&gt; or "nuisance species" by state and federal authorities who targeted them for elimination to protect gamefish populations,&lt;ref name="WarmSpringsNFH"/&gt; and to prevent alleged attacks on humans, a claim that remains unsubstantiated with the exception of occasional injuries sustained from captured alligator gar thrashing around on the decks of boats.&lt;ref name="Earthwave" /&gt; Fishermen participated in the slaughter of thousands of alligator gar believing they were providing a great service. In 1992, PBS affiliate [[KUHT]] channel 8, became the presenting station for a public outreach program that documented the life history cycle of alligator gar titled ''The Alligator Gar: Predator or Prey?''. It was the first documentary ever produced and televised nationally about alligator gar at a time when it was still being referred to as a trash fish. The half-hour program ran for 3 years as part of an educational series titled, "Exotic and Unusual Fishes", produced by Earthwave Society. It first aired in primetime during the 1992 July [[Nielsen ratings#Sweeps|sweeps]], and drew a 2.8 rating/4 share, making it the number-one rated program of the evening for PBS.&lt;ref name="Earthwave" /&gt;  A decade passed before any significant action was taken to protect and preserve the remaining populations of alligator gar in the United States. Among the first to enact restoration and management practices was the [[Missouri Department of Conservation]] in partnership with Tennessee, Arkansas, Kentucky, Illinois, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana.&lt;ref name=MDC/&gt;

===Sport fish===
[[File:Alligator Gar 6 Feet 129 lbs Brazos River 8 Nov 04a.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} {{convert|129|lb|kg|adj=on|abbr=on}} alligator gar caught in Texas, 2004]]

The long-time public perception of alligator gar as trash fish or a nuisance species has changed, with increasing national and international attention on the species as a sport fish, which some have attributed to features on popular television shows. Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana allow regulated [[sport fishing]] of alligator gar. Texas has one of the best remaining fisheries for alligator gar, and in concert with its efforts to maintain a viable fishery, imposed a one-per-day bag limit on them in 2009.&lt;ref name="TPWD"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/huntwild/wild/species/alg/ | title=Alligator Gar | publisher=Texas Parks and Wildlife Department | accessdate=April 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Texas state record, and world record for the largest alligator gar caught on rod and reel, is {{Convert|279|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, taken by Bill Valverde on January 1, 1951, on the Rio Grande in Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/fishboat/fish/action/staterecords.php?env=FW&amp;age_group=all&amp;list=0&amp;browse=Submit |title=State Freshwater Records: Rod and Reel |publisher=Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife |accessdate=May 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alligator gar are also quite popular among [[bowfishing|bowfishers]] because of their large size, trophy potential, and fighting ability. The Texas state bowfishing record was set in 2001 by Marty McClellan with a {{convert|290|lb|adj=on|abbr=on}} alligator gar from the Trinity River. The all-tackle record was a {{convert|302|lb|adj=on|abbr=on}} alligator gar caught on a trotline in 1953 by T.C. Pierce, Jr. In 1991, fishing guide Kirk Kirkland anecdotally reported catching an alligator gar measuring {{convert|9|ft|6|in|abbr=on}} on rod and line from the Trinity River.&lt;ref name="TPWDpress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/newsmedia/releases/print.phtml?req=20110516c|publisher=Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife|title=Big Fish Stories Can Have Happier Endings|date=May 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercialization and aquaculture===
Declining populations of alligator gar throughout their historic range has resulted in the need to monitor wild populations and regulate commercial harvests.  Alligator gar have a high yield of white meat filets and a small percentage of waste relative to body weight.  The meat is sold to wholesale distributors, and also sold retail by a few supermarkets with prices starting at around $3.00/lb.  Fried gar balls, grilled fillets, and filets boiled in water with [[crab boil]] seasoning are popular dishes in the south.  Also, a small [[cottage industry]]  makes jewelry out of ganoid scales, and tans gar hides to produce leather for making lamp shades, purses, and a host of novelty items.&lt;ref name=Earthwave/&gt;&lt;ref name=MDC/&gt;

''Atractosteus'' gars, including alligator gar, [[tropical gar]]s, and [[Cuban gar]]s are considered good candidates for [[aquaculture]], particularly in developing regions, where their rapid growth, disease resistance, easy adaptation to artificial feeds as juveniles, and ability to tolerate low water quality are essential.  Their ability to breathe in both air and water eliminates the need for costly aeration systems and other technology commonly used in aquaculture.  In the Southern United States, as well as in parts of Mexico and Cuba, [[broodstock]]s have already been established, and are being maintained in their respective regions where they already are a popular food fish.&lt;ref name="Ecofisiologia"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ecofisiologia.com.mx/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/2008-Gar-biology-and-culture.pdf | title=Gar biology and culture: status and prospects | publisher=Aquaculture Research | work=Chapter 39 | date=2008 | accessdate=July 7, 2014 | author=Alfaro, Roberto M. |author2=Gonzales, Carlos A. |author3=Ferrara, Allyse | pages=748–763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aquaria===
Despite the large size alligator gar can attain, they are kept as aquarium fish, though many fish labeled as "alligator gar" in the aquarium trade are actually smaller species. Alligator gar require a very large aquarium or pond, and ample resources for them to thrive in captivity. They are also a popular fish for public aquaria, and zoos. In many areas,  keeping alligator gar as pets is illegal, but they occasionally show up in fish stores.  Alligator gar are highly prized and sought after for private aquaria, particularly in Japan.  According to some reports, large alligator gar could fetch as much as US$40,000 in what some consider the "Japanese black market".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Horswell |first=Cindy |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/7614483.html |title=Indictments accuse 3 of taking alligator gar fish out of Trinity |work=Houston Chronicle |date=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, three men from Florida and Louisiana were indicted on charges of illegally removing wild alligator gar from the [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]] in Texas, and attempting to ship them to Japan for private collectors.  The [[indictment]]s resulted from an undercover sting operation by [[special agent]]s with the [[U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service]], the [[Texas Parks and Wildlife Department]], and the [[Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2011-10-15/news/fl-alligator-gar-arrests-20111015_1_alligator-gar-fish-tales-trash-fish|work=SunSentinel | title=Monster fish tale: Alligator gar sting ends in conviction | author=Berstein, Jon |date= October 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charges included violations of three separate provisions of the Lacey Act, specifically conspiracy to submit a false label for fish transported in interstate commerce; conspiracy to transport fish in interstate commerce in violation of state law or regulation; and conspiracy to transport and sell fish in interstate commerce in violation of state law or regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ktre.com/story/14917145/accused-alligator-gar-smugglers-busted-in-trinity-river-operation|title=Accused alligator gar smugglers busted in trinity river operation|publisher=ABC 9 KTRE|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two of the conspirators entered guilty pleas to one count, and the government dropped the other two charges against them.  A third conspirator went to trial on all three counts, was acquitted on one count, and found guilty on two.

[[File:Ars.moriendi.pride.a.jpg|thumb|[[Pride]] of the spirit is one of the five temptations of the dying man, according to '''''Ars moriendi'''''. Here, [[Demons#In Christian myth and legend|demons]] tempt the dying man with crowns (a [[medieval allegory]] to earthly pride) under the disapproving gaze of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], [[Christ]] and God. Woodblock seven (4a) of eleven, [[Netherlands]], circa 1460.]]

The '''''Ars moriendi''''' ("The Art of Dying") are two related [[Latin]] texts dating from about 1415 and 1450 which offer advice on the protocols and procedures of a good [[death]], explaining how to "die well" according to [[Christianity|Christian]] precepts of the [[late Middle Ages]]. It was written within the historical context of the effects of the macabre horrors of the [[Black Death]] 60 years earlier and consequent [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages|social upheavals of the 15th century]]. It was very popular, translated into most West European languages, and was the first in a western literary tradition of guides to death and dying. About 50,000 copies were printed in the ''incunabula'' period before 1501.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There was originally a "long version" and a later "short version" containing eleven [[woodcut]] pictures as instructive images which could be easily explained and memorized.

The authors of the two texts are unknown, but assumed to be Dominican churchmen, as they echo Jean de Gerson's publication, the ''Opusculum Tripartitu'', containing a section named ''De arte Moriendi''. Gerson may have been influenced by earlier references in 'compendia of faith' dating back to the thirteenth century, but the content was uniquely his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paul|first1=Kathryn|title=The Ars Moriendi: A Practical Approach To Dying Well|journal=Modern Believing|date=2015|volume=56|issue=2|page=213|doi=10.3828/mb.2015.19|publisher=ATLASerials|language=English|issn=1353-1425}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Long version ==
The original "long version", called ''Tractatus'' (or ''[[Speculum literature|Speculum]]'') ''artis bene moriendi'', was composed in 1415 by an anonymous [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar, probably at the request of the [[Council of Constance]] (1414–1418, Germany).&lt;ref name=blake&gt;N.F. Blake (1982). "Ars Moriendi". ''Dictionary of the Middle Ages''. v.1, pp547-8. {{ISBN|0-684-16760-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was widely read and translated into most West European languages, and was very popular in England, where a tradition of consolatory death literature survived until the 17th century. Works in the English tradition include ''[[The Way of Dying Well]]'' and ''[[The Sick Mannes Salve]]''. In 1650, ''[[Holy Living and Holy Dying]]'' became the "artistic climax" of the tradition that had begun with ''Ars moriendi''.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Beaty (1970). ''The Craft of Dying: A Study of the Literary Traditions of the Ars Moriendi in England''. {{ISBN|0-300-01336-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ars Moriendi'' was also among the first books printed with movable type and was widely circulated in nearly 100 editions before 1500, in particular in Germany. The long version survives in about 300 manuscript versions, only one illustrated.

''Ars moriendi'' consists of six chapters:&lt;ref name=blake /&gt;

# The first chapter explains that dying has a good side, and serves to console the dying man that death is not something to be afraid of.
# The second chapter outlines the five temptations that beset a dying man, and how to avoid them. These are [[faith|lack of faith]], [[wikt:despair|despair]], [[patience|impatience]], [[pride|spiritual pride]] and [[avarice]].
# The third chapter lists the seven questions to ask a dying man, along with consolation available to him through the redemptive powers of [[Christ]]'s love.
# The fourth chapter expresses the need to imitate Christ's life.
# The fifth chapter addresses the friends and family, outlining the general rules of behavior at the deathbed.
# The sixth chapter includes appropriate [[prayer]]s to be said for a dying man.

== Short version ==
The "short version", whose appearance shortly precedes the introduction in the 1460s of [[Woodblock printing|block books]] (books printed from carved blocks of wood, both text and images on the same block), first dates to around 1450, from the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name=blake /&gt; It is mostly an adaptation of the second chapter of the "long version", and contains eleven woodcut pictures. The first ten woodcuts are divided into 5 pairs, with each set showing a picture of [[Christian teaching about the Devil|the devil]] presenting one of the 5 temptations, and the second picture showing the proper remedy for that temptation. The last woodcut shows the dying man, presumably having successfully navigated the maze of temptations, being accepted into [[heaven]], and the devils going back to [[Hell in Christian beliefs|hell]] in confusion.

The "short version" was as popular as the "long version", but there was no English translation, perhaps because educated English people at the time were expected to understand several European languages. There are six extant manuscripts of the short version, most not illustrated, and over twenty extant blockbook illustrated editions, using 13 different sets of blocks.&lt;ref&gt;A Hyatt Mayor (1971), ''Prints and People'', Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, numbers 23-25.{{ISBN|0-691-00326-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ars moriendi (Meister E.S.), L.175.png|thumb|''Temptation of lack of Faith''; engraving by [[Master E. S.]], circa 1450]]

== The images ==
As well as the eleven different sets of [[blockbook]] [[woodcut]]s, there is a set by [[Master E. S.]] in [[engraving]]. The lengthy controversy over their respective dating and priority is now resolved by the discovery by [[Fritz Saxl]] of an earlier illuminated manuscript, of well before 1450, from whose tradition all the images in the printed versions clearly derive. Studies of the [[watermark]]s of the blockbooks by Allen Stevenson at the [[British Museum]] in the 1960s confirmed that none of them predated the 1460s, so Master E. S.' engravings are the earliest printed versions, dating from around 1450. The images remain largely the same in all media for the rest of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Shestack (1967). ''Master E. S.'', exhibition catalogue, Philadelphia Museum of Art, exhibit numbers 4-15&lt;/ref&gt;

There is the exceptional number of about seventy [[incunabulum]] editions, in a variety of languages, from Catalan to Dutch, the earliest from about 1474 from [[Cologne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://138.253.81.72/~cheshire/cgi-bin/istc/istcsearch.cgi?squery=search++(topicWord+%5C%5B5%3D100%5C%5D+%7B+ars+moriendi+%7D+)+resultsetid+SearchResults&amp;recno=1&amp;sorttype1=attr&amp;sortfield1=istcnum |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006210256/http://138.253.81.72/~cheshire/cgi-bin/istc/istcsearch.cgi?squery=search++%28topicWord+%5C%5B5%3D100%5C%5D+%7B+ars+moriendi+%7D+%29+resultsetid+SearchResults&amp;recno=1&amp;sorttype1=attr&amp;sortfield1=istcnum |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-06 |title=ISTC, British Library |publisher=138.253.81.72 |date=2005-10-27 |accessdate=2013-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegorically the images depicted the contest between angels and demons over the fate of the dying man. In his dying agony his soul emerges from his mouth to be received by one of a band of angels.
Common themes portrayed by illustrators include skeletons, the Last Judgement, corpses, and the forces of good and evil battling over souls.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Martyn Lyons (2011). ''Books: A Living History''. {{ISBN|978-1-60606-083-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extended tradition ==
The popularity of the ''Ars moriendi'' texts developed into a broader tradition of writing on the good death. Jeremy Taylor's books ''[[Holy Living and Holy Dying]]'', published in 1650 and 1651, exemplify that tradition. It developed in both Protestant and Catholic veins and continued in various forms through the nineteenth century.

{{nihongo|'''Ashikaga Tadayoshi'''|足利 直義||1306 – March 13, 1352, [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]], [[Japan]]}}&lt;ref name=Brit&gt;"Ashikaga Tadayoshi" in ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica|The New Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. Chicago: [[Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.]], 15th edn., 1992, Vol. 1, p. 624.&lt;/ref&gt; was a general of the [[Nanboku-chō period|Northern and Southern Courts]] period (1337–92) of Japanese history and a close associate of his elder brother [[Ashikaga Takauji|Takauji]], the first [[Muromachi shogunate|Muromachi]] ''[[shōgun]]''. Son of Ashikaga Sadauji and Uesugi Kiyoko, daughter of Uesugi Yorishige, the same mother as Takauji, he was a pivotal figure of the chaotic transition period between the [[Kamakura shogunate|Kamakura]] and Muromachi shogunates.&lt;ref name="yasuda"&gt;Yasuda (1990:22)&lt;/ref&gt; Tadayoshi is today considered a military and administrative genius and the true architect of many of his elder brother's successes.&lt;ref name="brit"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/38252/Ashikaga-Tadayoshi Encyclopædia Britannica Online] accessed on August 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary chronicles he is rarely called with his name, but is instead called either {{nihongo|''gosho''|御所|}} or {{nihongo|Daikyū-ji-dono|大休寺殿}} from the name of his [[bodaiji|family temple]].&lt;ref&gt;Sansom (1977:87)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kan"/&gt; His [[posthumous name]] was {{nihongo|Kozan Keigen|古山慧源}}.&lt;ref name="kan"&gt;(Kan (1980:123)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
The Ashikaga were a [[samurai]] family from [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]] having blood ties with the [[Seiwa Genji]], [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]]'s clan. Unlike his brother Takauji, Tadayoshi took no part in the Kamakura shogunate's political activities until the [[Genkō War]] (1331–1333), a civil war whose conclusion (the [[Siege of Kamakura (1333)]]) marks the end of the [[Kamakura period]] and the beginning of the most turbulent period in Japan's history, the Muromachi era.&lt;ref name="yasuda"/&gt;

Like his brother, Tadayoshi resolutely abandoned the Kamakura shogunate to ally himself with [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] during the [[Kenmu Restoration]] of 1333. When Go-Daigo had ascended to the throne in 1318, he had immediately manifested his intention to rule without interference from the military in Kamakura.&lt;ref name="sansom22"&gt;Sansom (2000:23–42)&lt;/ref&gt; The samurai class as a whole however was not ready to give away power, so the alliance between him and the Ashikaga was bound to be only temporary.

Go-Daigo wanted to re-establish his rule in Kamakura and the east of the country without sending there a ''shōgun'', as this was seen, just a year from the fall of its shogunate, as still too dangerous.&lt;ref name="sansom22"/&gt; As a compromise, he sent his six-year-old son Prince Norinaga to [[Mutsu Province]] and nominated him Governor-General of the Mutsu and [[Dewa Province]]s.&lt;ref name="sansom22"/&gt; In an obvious reply to this move, Tadayoshi, without an order from the Emperor escorted another of his sons, eleven-year-old [[Prince Nariyoshi]] (a.k.a. Narinaga) to Kamakura, where he installed him as governor of the [[Kōzuke Province]] with himself as a deputy and de facto ruler.&lt;ref name="sansom22"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ksk24"&gt;{{cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The appointment of a warrior to such an important post was intended to show the Emperor that the samurai class was not ready for a purely civilian rule.&lt;ref name="sansom22"/&gt; Since he ruled without interference from Kyoto and the area in itself was in effect a miniature shogunate, this event can be considered the beginning of the Ashikaga shogunate.&lt;ref name="yasuda"/&gt;

In 1335, during the Nakasendai Rebellion led by [[Hōjō Tokiyuki]] Tadayoshi, being unable to defend the city, had to leave [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]] in a rush. Not being in the position to take along another son of Go-Daigo's, [[Prince Morinaga]], whom he had kept as a hostage for several months, rather than letting him go he decided to have him beheaded.&lt;ref name=Sansom2&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sansom |first=George |title=A History of Japan, 1334-1615 |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=1961 |ISBN=0804705259 |page=34,37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Dec. 1335, Tadayoshi was defeated by imperial forces under the command of [[Nitta Yoshisada]] forcing his retreat to the [[Hakone mountains]].  However, with the aid of his brother Takauji, they were able to defeat Yoshisada at the battles of Sanoyama and Mishima.  The brothers were then free to advance upon Kyoto.&lt;ref name=Sansom2/&gt;{{rp|39–41}}

Their occupation of Kyoto was short lived however, as forces loyal to Go-Daigo forced the brothers to flee west.  In April 1336, Ashikaga Tadayoshi, "drove the enemy before him" helping his brother defeat the [[Kikuchi clan]], allies of Go-Daigo.  This [[Battle of Tatarahama (1336)]] occurred in [[Hakata Bay]].  The victory enabled Takauji to become master of Kyushu.&lt;ref name=Sansom2/&gt;{{rp|43–47}}

By May, Takauji was able to advance with a flotilla, reaching the environs of present-day Kobe in July.  Tadayoshi followed in parallel with a land force.&lt;ref name=Sansom2/&gt;{{rp|50}}

Turning against Go-Daigo, Tadayoshi and Takauji set up a rival emperor in 1336 after defeating the Loyalists in the [[Battle of Minatogawa]].  Their [[Muromachi shogunate]] was founded in 1338.&lt;ref name=Turnbull3&gt;{{Cite book |last=Turnbull |first=Stephen |title=The Samurai, A Military History |publisher=MacMillan Publishing Co., Inc. |year=1977 |ISBN=0026205408 |pages=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dividing power between them, Takauji took charge of military affairs and Tadayoshi of judicial and administrative matters.

Both Tadayoshi and Takauji were disciples of famous Zen master, intellectual and garden designer [[Musō Soseki]], under which guidance the first would later become a Buddhist monk.&lt;ref name="yasuda"/&gt; It was partly because of Soseki's influence that the pre-existing [[Five Mountain System]] network of [[Zen]] temples was expanded and strengthened, first with the establishment of the [[Five Mountain System#The Jissetsu|Jissetsu]], and later with that of the [[Five Mountain System#The Ankoku-ji system|Ankoku-ji]] temple sub-networks. The creation of both systems is generally attributed wholly to Tadayoshi.&lt;ref name="yasuda"/&gt; It was also Soseki which famously wrote about the two brothers, describing Takauji as more apt to military pursuits, and Tadayoshi to government.

===The Kannō disturbance and Tadayoshi's death===
{{main article|Kannō disturbance}}

Ashikaga Takauji was the formally-appointed shogun but, having proved incapable of ruling the country, for more than ten years Tadayoshi had governed in his stead.&lt;ref name="brit"/&gt; The relationship between the two brothers was however destined to be destroyed by the Kannō disturbance, an event which takes its name from the [[Kannō]] era (1350–1351) during which it took place, and which had very serious consequences for the entire country. Trouble between the two started when Takauji made [[Kō no Moronao]] his [[shitsuji|deputy ''shōgun'']]. According to the [[Taiheiki]], Tadayoshi didn't like Moronao and, every other effort to get rid of him having failed, tried to have him assassinated. According to the same source, his plot was discovered and he was therefore removed from the government. In any event, Tadayoshi in 1350 was forced by Moronao to leave the government, and [[tonsure|take the tonsure]] under the monastic name Keishin.&lt;ref name="papi"&gt;Papinot (1972:29)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1351 Tadayoshi rebelled and joined his brother's enemies, the [[Southern court]], whose emperor, [[Go-Murakami]] appointed him general of all his troops. In 1351 he defeated Takauji, occupied [[Kyoto]], and entered [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]]. During the same year his forces killed Moronao and his brother [[Kō no Moroyasu|Moroyasu]] at Mikage ([[Settsu Province]]). The following year Tadayoshi's fortunes turned and he was defeated by Takauji at Sattayama.&lt;ref name="papi"/&gt; A reconciliation between the brothers proved to be brief; Tadayoshi was sandwiched by two of Takauji's armies and fled to the hills of Izu in 1352. Shortly after an ostensible second reconciliation, Tadayoshi was captured and confined in the Kamakura Jomyoji monastery, where he died suddenly in March.  According to the [[Taiheiki]], by poisoning.&lt;ref name=Sansom2/&gt;{{rp|86}}

Ashikaga Tadayoshi was buried at {{nihongo|Kumano Daikyū-ji|熊野大休寺}}, a [[Buddhist temples in Japan|Buddhist temple]] which no longer exists, but whose ruins are now near [[Jōmyō-ji (Kamakura)|Jōmyō-ji]] in Kamakura.&lt;ref&gt;Kamiya Vol. 1 (2008:110)&lt;/ref&gt;  The temple was founded on the grounds of Tadayoshi's former Kamakura residence, according to Jōmyō-ji's own records by Tadayoshi himself.&lt;ref name="kan"&gt;(Kan (1980:123)&lt;/ref&gt; According to the {{nihongo|''Kuge Nikkushū''|空華日工集}}, the diary of priest [[Gidō Shūshin]], in 1372 on the day of Tadayoshi's death [[Kantō Kubō|Kamakura's Kubō]] [[Ashikaga Ujimitsu]] visited Daikyū-ji.&lt;ref name="kan"/&gt; The date of disappearance of the temple is unknown.&lt;ref name="kan"/&gt; He adopted Takauji is son as his Adopted son, Ashikaga Tadafuyu.

He is known only from his participation in the [[Battle of Dara]] in 530 against the [[Byzantine]]s led by [[Belisarius]], recorded by [[Procopius of Caesarea]]. In this battle, Baresmanas was the second-in-command of the Persian army under [[Perozes]], and was killed during the fight by [[Sunicas]]. According to the account of Procopius, he was one-eyed.

The London Gazette citation describes how Spillett became aware that there was a fire at a neighbouring house where three generations of a family lived. Spillett arrived, still only partly dressed, to learn that the father Mr Palmer of the family was still in the house. The whole house was already well alight, but he went in despite being held back by other neighbours. He managed to fight his way upstairs but was unable to get through to the trapped man. He himself became trapped and had to escape the flames by jumping from a first floor window. Once the fire was over, he was found in the garden of a neighbour after crawling down the garden, through the alley and thinking he was crawling to his own back door to his wife , ended up at the back door of a neighbour, badly burned and with other serious injuries, from jumping and falling through the leanto. He was taken to hospital but died a week later. He leaves behind a young wife Jean and four month old daughter Jacqueline Spillett.

{{Campaignbox Irish War of Independence}}

The '''Burning of [[Cork (city)|Cork]]''' by [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] forces took place on the night of 11–12 December 1920, during the [[Irish War of Independence]]. It followed an [[Irish Republican Army (1919–1922)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) ambush of a British [[Auxiliary Division|Auxiliary]] patrol in the city, which wounded twelve Auxiliaries, one fatally. In retaliation, the Auxiliaries, [[Black and Tans]] and [[British Army|British soldiers]] looted and burnt numerous buildings in the city centre. Many civilians reported being beaten, shot at, and robbed by British forces. Firefighters testified that British forces hindered their attempts to tackle the blazes through intimidation, cutting their hoses and shooting at them.

More than 40 business premises, 300 residential properties, [[Cork City Hall|the City Hall]] and Carnegie Library were destroyed by the fire. Over £3&amp;nbsp;million worth of damage (equivalent to €172&amp;nbsp;million today) was wrought, 2,000 were left jobless and many more became homeless. Two unarmed IRA volunteers were shot dead in the north of the city.

British forces carried out other reprisals on Irish civilians during the war, but the burning of Cork was one of the most significant. The British government at first denied that its forces had started the fires, and blamed the IRA. Later, a British Army inquiry concluded that a company of Auxiliaries were responsible.

==Background==
The Irish War of Independence began in 1919, following the [[Irish Declaration of Independence|declaration]] of an [[Irish Republic]] and its parliament, [[Dáil Éireann]]. The army of the new republic, the Irish Republican Army (IRA), waged guerrilla warfare against British forces: the [[British Army]] and the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] (RIC). To help fight the IRA, the British Government formed the Auxiliary Division; a paramilitary unit composed of ex-soldiers from Britain which specialized in [[counter-insurgency]]. It also recruited thousands of British ex-soldiers into the RIC, who became known as "[[Black and Tans]]". IRA intelligence officer [[Florence O'Donoghue]] claimed the subsequent burning and looting of Cork was "not an isolated incident, but rather the large-scale application of a policy initiated and approved, implicitly or explicitly, by the British government".{{sfn|O'Donoghue|2009|pp=88–89}}

[[File:Outside the London and North Western Hotel in Dublin, April 21, 1921.jpg|thumb|A group of "Black and Tans" and Auxiliaries in Dublin, April 1921]]
[[County Cork]] was an epicenter of the war. On 23 November 1920, a "Black and Tan" in civilian dress threw a grenade into a group of IRA volunteers who had just left a brigade meeting on St Patrick Street in Cork. Three IRA volunteers of the 1st Cork Brigade were killed: Paddy Trahey, Patrick Donohue and Seamus Mehigan.{{sfn|Roinn Cosanta. Bureau of Military History|1956|pp=29&amp;ndash;30}} ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that sixteen people were injured.{{sfn|New York Times|1920}}

On 28 November 1920, the IRA's 3rd Cork Brigade ambushed an Auxiliary patrol [[Kilmichael Ambush|at Kilmichael]], killing 17 Auxiliaries. This was the biggest loss of life for the British in County Cork. On 10 December, British forces declared [[martial law]] in counties Cork (including the city), Kerry, Limerick, and Tipperary. It also imposed a military [[curfew]] on Cork city, which began at 10&lt;small&gt;PM&lt;/small&gt; each night. IRA volunteer Seán Healy later recalled that "at least 1,000 troops would pour out of Victoria Barracks at this hour and take over complete control of the city".{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|pp=104–10}}

==Ambush at Dillon's Cross==
IRA intelligence established that an Auxiliary patrol usually left [[Collins Barracks, Cork|Victoria Barracks]] (in the north of the city) each night at 8&lt;small&gt;PM&lt;/small&gt; and made its way to the city centre via Dillon's Cross. On 11 December, IRA commander Seán O'Donoghue received intelligence that two lorries of Auxiliaries would be leaving the barracks that night and travelling with them would be British Army [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] Captain James Kelly.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|pp=104–10}} 

That evening, a unit of six IRA volunteers commanded by O'Donoghue took up position between the barracks and Dillon's Cross.{{sfn|O'Brien|2017|loc=chpt. 10}} Their goal was to destroy the patrol and capture or kill Captain Kelly. Five of the volunteers hid behind a stone wall while one, Michael Kenny, stood across the road dressed as an off-duty British officer. When the lorries neared he was to beckon the driver of the first lorry to slow down or stop.{{sfn|O'Brien|2017|loc=chpt. 10}} The neighbourhood was close (within a "couple of hundred yards") of a military barracks.{{sfn|O'Donoghue|2009|p=93}}{{sfn|Bennett|2010}}

At 8&lt;small&gt;PM&lt;/small&gt;, two lorries each carrying 13 Auxiliaries emerged from the barracks. The first lorry slowed when the driver spotted Kenny and, as it did so, the IRA unit attacked with grenades and revolvers.{{sfn|O'Brien|2017|loc=chpt. 10}} The official British report said that 12 members of the Auxiliary Division were wounded and that one, Temporary Cadet Spencer Chapman, a former Officer in the 4th Battalion London Regiment ([[Royal Fusiliers]]), died from his wounds shortly after.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|pp=104–10}}&lt;ref&gt;"The Auxiliaries – Spencer R Chapman". Retrieved 14 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; As the IRA unit made its escape, some of the Auxiliaries managed to fire their rifles in the direction of the volunteers while others dragged the wounded to the nearest cover: O'Sullivan's pub.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|pp=104–10}}

The Auxiliaries broke into the pub with weapons drawn.{{sfn|O'Brien|2017|loc=chpt. 10}} They ordered everyone to put their hands over their heads to be searched. Backup and an ambulance were sent from the nearby barracks. One witness described a number of young men being rounded-up and forced to lie on the ground. The Auxiliaries dragged one of them to the middle of the crossroads, stripped him naked and forced him to sing "[[God Save the King]]" until he collapsed on the road.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|pp=104–10}}

==Burning and looting==
[[File:Patrick Street Cork2.jpg|thumb|St Patrick's Street, Cork, c. 1900]]
Angered by an attack so near their headquarters and seeking retribution for the deaths of their colleagues at Kilmichael, the Auxiliaries gathered to wreak their revenge.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|pp=111–12}} Charles Schulze, a member of the Auxiliaries and a former British Army Captain in the Dorsetshire Regiment during [[World War I]], organized a group of Auxiliaries to burn the centre of Cork.{{sfn|O'Riordan|2010}}

At 9:30&lt;small&gt;PM&lt;/small&gt;, lorries of Auxiliaries and British soldiers left the barracks and alighted at Dillon's Cross, where they broke into a number of houses and herded the occupants on to the street. They then set the houses on fire and stood guard as they were razed to the ground.{{sfn|O'Donoghue|2009|p=94}} Those who tried to intervene were fired upon and some were badly beaten.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|pp=111–12}} Seven buildings were set alight at the crossroads. When one was found to be owned by [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestants]], the Auxiliaries quickly doused the fire.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|p=114}}

At about the same time, a group of armed and uniformed Auxiliaries surrounded a tram at Summerhill, smashed its windows, and forced all the passengers out.{{sfn|O'Donoghue|2009|p=95}} A number of the passengers (including at least three women) were repeatedly kicked, hit with rifle butts, threatened, and verbally abused. The Auxiliaries then forced the passengers to line-up against a wall and searched them, while continuing the physical and verbal abuse. Some had their money and belongings stolen.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|pp=115–17}} Another tram was set alight near [[Theobald Mathew (temperance reformer)|Father Mathew]]'s statue. Meanwhile, witnesses reported seeing a group of 14–18 [[Black and Tans]] firing wildly for upwards of 20 minutes on nearby MacCurtain Street.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|pp=118-20}}

Soon after, witnesses reported groups of armed men on [[St Patrick's Street]], the city's main shopping area. Some were uniformed or partially uniformed members of the Auxiliaries and British Army while others wore no uniforms.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|pp=121–25}} They were seen firing into the air, smashing shop windows and setting buildings alight. Many reported hearing bombs exploding. A group of Auxiliaries were seen throwing a bomb into the ground floor of the Munster Arcade, which housed both shops and flats. It exploded under the residential quarters while people were inside the building. They managed to escape unharmed but were detained by the Auxiliaries.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|pp=121–25}}

[[File:CorkCity OldCityHall Single.jpg|thumb|left|Cork City Hall in the 1870s. The building was destroyed during the Burning of Cork]]
The fire brigade was informed of the fire at Dillon's Cross shortly before 10&amp;nbsp;pm and were sent to deal with it at once. However, on finding that Grant's department store on St Patrick's Street was ablaze, they decided to tackle it first.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|p=125}} The fire brigade's Superintendent, Alfred Hutson, called Victoria Barracks and asked them to tackle the fire at Dillon's Cross so that he could focus on the city centre. However, the barracks took no heed of his request. As he did not have enough resources to deal with all the fires at once, "he would have to make choices&amp;nbsp;– some fires he would fight, others he could not".{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|p=126}}

Hutson oversaw the operation on St Patrick's Street, and met ''[[Cork Examiner]]'' reporter Alan Ellis. He told Ellis "that all the fires were being deliberately started by [[Incendiary device|incendiary bombs]], and in several cases he had seen soldiers pouring cans of petrol into buildings and setting them alight".{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|p=128}} 

A number of firemen later testified that British forces hindered their attempts to tackle the blazes by intimidating them, cutting their hoses and/or driving lorries over the hoses. They also said that firemen were shot at and that at least two were wounded by gunfire.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|pp=126-27}} Shortly after 3&lt;small&gt;AM&lt;/small&gt;, ''Cork Examiner'' reporter Alan Ellis came upon a unit of the fire brigade pinned down by gunfire near City Hall. The firemen said that they were being shot at by Black and Tans who had broken into the building. They also claimed to have seen uniformed men carrying cans of petrol into the building from nearby Union Quay barracks.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|pp=135–36}} 

At about 4&lt;small&gt;AM&lt;/small&gt; a large explosion was heard and City Hall and the neighbouring Carnegie Library went up in flames, resulting in the loss of many of the city's public records.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|pp=135–36}}{{sfn|Cork History}} When more firefighters arrived, British forces fired at them and refused them access to water. The last act of arson took place at about 6&lt;small&gt;AM&lt;/small&gt; when a group of policemen looted and burnt the Murphy Brothers' clothes shop on Washington Street.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|pp=135–36}}

==Shooting of the Delaney brothers==
After the ambush at Dillon's Cross, IRA commander Seán O'Donoghue and volunteer James O'Mahony made their way to the Delaney farmhouse at Dublin Hill in the north of the city. Brothers Cornelius and Jeremiah Delaney were members of F Company, 1st Battalion, 1st Cork Brigade IRA.{{sfn|Delaney Brothers}}

O'Donoghue hid a number of unused grenades on the farm and the two men went their separate ways.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|p=109}} At about 2&lt;small&gt;AM&lt;/small&gt; at least eight armed men entered the house and went upstairs into the brothers' bedroom. The brothers got up and stood at the bedside and were asked their names. When they answered, the gunmen opened fire.{{sfn|Delaney Brothers}}{{sfn|O'Donoghue|2009|p=101}} Both brothers were shot dead and their elderly relative, William Dunlea,&lt;!-- is this correct spelling?? --&gt; was wounded by gunfire.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|p=9}} According to Daniel Delaney, the father of the brothers, the gunmen wore long overcoats and spoke with English accents.{{sfn|Delaney Brothers}} It is thought that, while searching the site of the ambush, the Auxiliaries had found a cap belonging to one of the volunteers and had used [[bloodhound]]s to follow the scent to the Delaney home.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|p=134}}

==Aftermath==
[[File:Dublin saves Cork (17156792989).jpg|thumb|Fire engines sent from Dublin to help deal with the aftermath of the fires]]
Over 40 business premises and 300 residential properties had been destroyed.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=244}} This amounted to over five acres of the city.{{sfn|Hidden History}} Over £3&amp;nbsp;million worth of damage (1920 value) was suffered, although the value of property looted by British forces was not clear. Many people became homeless and 2,000 were left jobless.{{sfn|O'Riordan|2010}} Fatalities included an Auxiliary killed by the IRA, two IRA volunteers killed by Auxiliaries, and a woman who died from a heart-attack when Auxiliaries burst into her house. A number of people, including firefighters, had reportedly been assaulted or otherwise wounded.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=244}}

Florence O'Donoghue, intelligence officer of the 1st Cork Brigade IRA at the time, described the scene in Cork on the morning of the 12th:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Many familiar landmarks were gone forever&amp;nbsp;– where whole buildings had collapsed here and there a solitary wall leaned at some crazy angle from its foundation. The streets ran with sooty water, the footpaths were strewn with broken glass and debris, ruins smoked and smoldered and over everything was the all-pervasive smell of burning."{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|p=139}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At midday mass in the [[Cathedral of St Mary and St Anne|North Cathedral]] the [[Bishop of Cork]], [[Daniel Cohalan (bishop of Cork)|Daniel Cohalan]], condemned the arson but said the burning of the city was a result of the "murderous ambush at Dillon's Cross" and vowed, "I will certainly issue a decree of [[excommunication]] against anyone who, after this notice, shall take part in an ambush or a kidnapping or attempted murder or arson".{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|pp=140–42}} No excommunications, however, were issued, and the bishop's edict was largely ignored by pro-IRA priests and chaplains.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Pat Coogan|Coogan, Tim Pat]].[https://books.google.com/books?id=mZgmCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT242&amp;lpg=PT242&amp;dq=in+the+wake+of+Cohalan%27s+edict+an+IRA+chaplain&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TSDeLg9MJz&amp;sig=0tud90zXf3s9hcT0avgVTLfYj2I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisrvWHq67ZAhXOTd8KHZBRDqYQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=in%20the%20wake%20of%20Cohalan%27s%20edict%20an%20IRA%20chaplain&amp;f=false "[[Patrick Clune|Clune]] arrived in Rome in the wake of the publicity over this decree and a growing belief, fostered by the British, that some priests were preaching that it was not a sin to shoot policemen. In fact the British were not entirely wide of the mark as the following letter to Florrie O'Donoghue, on Cohalan's edict, from the Chaplain to the Brigade shows"], ''Michael Collins: A Biography'', Head of Zeus Ltd, December 16, 2015 (524 pages); {{ISBN|1784975362}}/{{ISBN|9781784975364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A meeting of Cork Corporation was held that afternoon at the Corn Exchange. Councillor [[James Walsh (Irish politician)|J.J. Walsh]] condemned the bishop for his comments, which he claimed held the Irish people up as the "evil-doers". Walsh said that while the people of Cork had been suffering, "not a single word of protest was uttered [by the bishop], and today, after the city has been decimated, he saw no better course than to add insult to injury". Councillor Michael Ó Cuill, alderman Tadhg Barry and the Lord Mayor, [[Daniel O'Callaghan (Cork politician)|Daniel O'Callaghan]], agreed with Walsh's sentiments. The members resolved that the Lord Mayor should send a telegram asking for the intervention of the European governments and the USA.{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|p=143}}

Three days after the fire, on 15 December, two lorry-loads of Auxiliaries were travelling from [[Dunmanway]] to Cork for the funeral of Spencer Chapman, a comrade killed at Dillon's Cross. When they met two men (an elderly priest, Canon Magner, walking with a parishioner, a farmer's son) helping a resident magistrate fix his car, an Auxiliary, Vernon Anwyl Hart, got out and began questioning them, then shot Magner and his companion, Timothy (or Tadhg) Crowley. Both died of their injuries. A military court of inquiry heard that he had been a friend of Chapman and had been "drinking steadily" since his death. Hart was found guilty of murder, but insane.{{sfn|Leeson|2011|p=204}} At a subsequent investigation, one of the reasons given for his murder was that he refused to have the parish church bells tolled after the [[Kilmichael ambush]], in which 17 Auxiliaries were killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theauxiliaries.com/INCIDENTS/magner-murder/magner-murder.html Canon Magner murder], theauxiliaries.com; accessed 17 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigation===
[[File:Cork City Hall01 2009-04-30.jpg|thumb|The re-built Cork City Hall, completed in the 1930s]]
Irish nationalists called for an open and impartial inquiry.{{sfn|O'Donoghue|2009|p=102}} In the British [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], Sir [[Hamar Greenwood]], the [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], refused demands for such an inquiry. He denied that British forces had any involvement and accused the IRA of starting the fires.{{sfn|Cork History}}{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|p=148}} When asked about reports of firefighters being hampered by British forces he said "Every available policeman and soldier in Cork was turned out at once and without their assistance the fire brigade could not have gone through the crowds and did the work that they tried to do".{{sfn|White|O'Shea|2006|p=148}}

[[Bonar Law]] said "in the present condition of Ireland, we are much more likely to get an impartial inquiry in a military court than in any other".{{sfn|O'Donoghue|2009|p=102}} The British military launched its own inquiry, the "Strickland Report",&lt;ref name="greenwoodheckled"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1921/02/17/103546888.pdf "Greenwood heckled on Strickland Report"], ''The New York Times'', 17 February 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; but Cork Corporation instructed its employees and other corporate officials to take no part.{{sfn|O'Donoghue|2009|p=103}} The report pointed the finger of blame at members of the Auxiliaries' K Company, based at Victoria Barracks. The Auxiliaries, it was claimed, set the fires in reprisal for the IRA attack at Dillon's Cross.{{sfn|Cork History}} However, the British Government refused to publish the report.&lt;ref name="greenwoodheckled"/&gt;

The [[Irish Trades Union Congress|Irish Labour Party and Trades Union Congress]] published a pamphlet in January 1921 entitled ''Who burned Cork City?'' The work drew on evidence from hundreds of eyewitness which suggested that the fires had been set by British forces and that British forces had prevented firefighters from tackling the blaze.{{sfn|Hidden History}} The material was compiled by the President of [[University College Cork]], [[Alfred O'Rahilly]].{{sfn|Cork History}}

K&amp;nbsp;Company Auxiliary Charles Schulze, a former British Army Captain,&lt;ref&gt;[http://theauxiliaries.com/men-alphabetical/men-s/schultze-cfl/schulze.html Charles Schulze profile], theauxiliaries.com; accessed 17 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote in a letter to his girlfriend in England that it was "sweet revenge", while in a letter to his mother he wrote: "Many who had witnessed [[World War I|scenes in France and Flanders]] say that nothing they had experienced was comparable with the punishment meted out in Cork".{{sfn|O'Riordan|2010}} After the fire, K Company was moved to Dunmanway and began wearing burnt corks in their caps in reference to the burning of the city.{{sfn|Hidden History}} For their part in the arson and looting, K Company was disbanded on 31 March 1921.{{sfn|Leeson|2011|p=101}}

There has been debate over whether British forces at Victoria Barracks had planned to burn the city before the ambush at Dillon's Cross, whether the British Army itself was involved, and whether those who set the fires were being commanded by superior officers.&lt;!--NOTE: we should include quotes here from the British military and others who disagree with this conclusion--&gt; Florence O'Donoghue, who was intelligence officer of the 1st Cork Brigade IRA at the time, wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;"What appears more probable is that the ambush provided the excuse for an act which was long premeditated and for which all arrangements had been made. The rapidity with which supplies of petrol and [[Verey lights]] were brought from Cork barracks to the centre of the city, and the deliberate manner in which the work of firing the various premises was divided amongst groups under the control of officers, gives evidence of organisation and pre-arrangement. Moreover, the selection of certain premises for destruction and the attempt made by an Auxiliary officer to prevent the looting of one shop by Black and Tans: 'You are in the wrong shop; that man is a Loyalist' and the reply, 'We don't give a damn; this is the shop that was pointed out to us', is additional proof that the matter had been carefully planned beforehand."{{sfn|O'Donoghue|2009|pp=93–94}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Catherine of Poděbrady''' (11 November 1449 – 8 March 1464,&lt;ref&gt;{{MLCC |warning=1 |url=http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/BOHEMIA.htm#_Toc154062938 |title-date= |title= BOHEMIA, Medieval Lands|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was the first wife of [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary|Matthias Corvinus]], [[King of Hungary]].

==Biography==

Catherine and her twin sister [[Sidonie of Poděbrady|Sidonie]] were born at [[Poděbrady]], to the Bohemian king [[George of Poděbrady]] and his first wife, [[Kunigunde of Šternberk]]. Kunigunde died from complications of the birth.  George of Poděbrady eventually remarried; his second wife, [[Joanna of Rožmitál]], bore George more children, including [[Ludmila of Poděbrady]].

Matthias Corvinus had lost his fiancée, [[Elizabeth of Celje|Elisabeth of Cilli]], at a young age. On 1 May 1463 he married Catherine at [[Matthias Church]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.destination360.com/europe/huwngary/matthias-church Matthias Church]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Buda]]. Matthias was eighteen, his bride thirteen. The wedding negotiations had begun in 1458 when Catherine was nine years old. It was agreed that George would make Matthias [[King of Bohemia]] if he married Catherine. Soon after the marriage, Catherine left her family and went to live in [[Hungary]] with her new husband. [[Janus Pannonius]] helped teach Catherine Latin.&lt;ref&gt;[[:cs:Kateřina z Poděbrad|Translation from Czech Wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The queen was very young, so she played little part in the politics of her husband's two kingdoms. She died in childbirth at the age of 14. Her child died soon after birth as well. The event caused Matthias to lose hope of siring a legitimate heir. He eventually married [[Beatrice of Naples]], but that marriage also failed to produce an heir. Matthias's only surviving offspring was an illegitimate son, [[John Corvinus]], by his mistress [[Barbara Edelpöck]].

A '''cell type''' is a classification used to  distinguish between [[Morphology (biology)|morphologically]] or [[Phenotype|phenotypically]] distinct [[cell (biology)|cell]] forms within a [[species]]. A [[multicellular organism]] may contain a number of widely differing and specialized cell types, such as [[muscle cell]]s and [[skin cell]]s in humans, that differ both in appearance and function yet are [[Genetics|genetically]] identical. Cells are able to be of the same [[genotype]], but different cell type due to the differential [[Regulation of gene expression|regulation]] of the [[gene]]s they contain. [[Cell fate determination#Cell fate|Classification]] of a specific cell type is often done through the use of [[microscopy]] (such as those from the [[cluster of differentiation]] family that are commonly used for this purpose in [[immunology]]). Recent developments in [[Single cell sequencing|single cell RNA sequencing]] facilitated classification of cell types based on shared gene expression patterns. This has led to the discovery of many new cell types in e.g. mouse [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]], [[hippocampus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zeisel|first=Amit|last2=Muñoz-Manchado|first2=Ana B.|last3=Codeluppi|first3=Simone|last4=Lönnerberg|first4=Peter|last5=Manno|first5=Gioele La|last6=Juréus|first6=Anna|last7=Marques|first7=Sueli|last8=Munguba|first8=Hermany|last9=He|first9=Liqun|date=2015-03-06|title=Cell types in the mouse cortex and hippocampus revealed by single-cell RNA-seq|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6226/1138|journal=Science|language=en|volume=347|issue=6226|pages=1138–1142|doi=10.1126/science.aaa1934|issn=0036-8075|pmid=25700174}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[dorsal root ganglion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Usoskin|first=Dmitry|last2=Furlan|first2=Alessandro|last3=Islam|first3=Saiful|last4=Abdo|first4=Hind|last5=Lönnerberg|first5=Peter|last6=Lou|first6=Daohua|last7=Hjerling-Leffler|first7=Jens|last8=Haeggström|first8=Jesper|last9=Kharchenko|first9=Olga|date=2014-11-24|title=Unbiased classification of sensory neuron types by large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.3881|journal=Nature Neuroscience|language=En|volume=18|issue=1|pages=145–153|doi=10.1038/nn.3881|issn=1097-6256}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[spinal cord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Häring|first=Martin|last2=Zeisel|first2=Amit|last3=Hochgerner|first3=Hannah|last4=Rinwa|first4=Puneet|last5=Jakobsson|first5=Jon E.

Animals have evolved a greater diversity of cell types in a [[multicellular]] body (100–150 different cell types), compared
with 10–20 in plants, fungi, and protoctists.&lt;ref&gt;Margulis, L. &amp; Chapman, M.J. (2009). Kingdoms and Domains: An Illustrated Guide to the Phyla of Life on Earth ([4th ed.]. ed.). Amsterdam: Academic Press/Elsevier. p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multicellular organisms==
All higher [[multicellular organism|multicellular]] [[organism]]s contain cells specialised for different functions. Most distinct cell types arise from a single [[totipotent]] cell that [[Cellular differentiation|differentiates]] into hundreds of different cell types during the course of [[Development (biology)|development]]. Differentiation of cells is driven by different environmental cues (such as cell–cell interaction) and intrinsic differences (such as those caused by the uneven distribution of [[molecule]]s during [[cell division|division]]). [[multicellular organisms|Multicellular]] organisms are composed of cells that fall into two fundamental types: [[germ cell]]s and [[somatic cell]]s. During development, somatic cells will become more specialized and form the three primary [[germ layer]]s: [[ectoderm]], [[mesoderm]], and [[endoderm]]. After formation of the three [[germ layer]]s, cells will continue to specialize until they reach a terminally differentiated state that is much more resistant to changes in cell type than its [[Progenitor cell|progenitors]].

==Humans==
A [[list of distinct cell types in the adult human body|list of cell types in the human body]] may include several hundred distinct types depending on the source.&lt;ref&gt;''Molecular Biology of the Cell'', Fourth Edition, Bruce Alberts, Alexander Johnson, Julian Lewis, Martin Raff, Keith Roberts, Peter Walter&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copewithcytokines.de/cope.cgi?key=cell%20types ines.de/cope.cgi COPE database]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Congo''' (1954–1964) was a [[chimpanzee]] who learned how to draw and paint. Zoologist, author and [[surrealist]] painter, [[Desmond Morris]], first observed his abilities when the chimp was offered a pencil and paper at two years of age. By the age of four, Congo had made 400 drawings and paintings. His style has been described as "lyrical [[abstract impressionism]]".&lt;ref name="timesonline"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article569970.ece |title=Congo the chimpanzee |accessdate=2008-12-12 |author=Waldemar Januszczak |work=[[TimesOnline]] |date=2005-09-25 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography and works==
Congo was born in 1954.&lt;!--where?--&gt; He learned to draw near the age of two, beginning when zoologist [[Desmond Morris]] offered Congo a pencil.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt; Morris said, "He took a [[pencil]] and I placed a piece of card in front of him. This is how I recorded it at the time, 'Something strange was coming out of the end of the pencil. It was Congo's first line. It wandered a short way and then stopped. Would it happen again? Yes, it did, and again and again'."&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt; Morris soon observed that the chimp would draw [[circle]]s, and had a basic sense of composition in his drawings.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt; He also showed the ability of symmetrical consistency between two sides of a sketch; when Morris drew a shape at one side of a piece of paper, Congo would balance the structure by making marks on the other half of the paper.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt; Similarly, if a color on one side contained blue for example, he would add blue to the other side as well to keep balance.&lt;ref name="timesonline" /&gt;

He soon began painting; the patterns he made were never distinguished, pictorial images, but usually of a vague "radiating fan pattern" in the [[abstract impressionism]] style.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt; Between the ages of two and four, he produced about 400 drawings and paintings.&lt;ref name="cbs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/06/20/entertainment/main703057.shtml|title=Dead Chimp's Art Sells Big|accessdate=2008-06-01|date=2005-06-20|publisher=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through that time, Congo developed a familiarity with his routine painting sessions with Morris. When a picture was taken away that he didn't consider complete, Congo would reportedly begin to scream and "throw fits".&lt;ref name="timesonline" /&gt; Also, if the ape considered one of his drawings to be finished, he would refuse to continue painting even if someone tried to persuade him to do so.&lt;ref name="timesonline" /&gt;

In the late 1950s, he made appearances on the British television show Zootime, which was presented live from the [[London Zoo]] by Desmond Morris.&lt;ref name="timesonline" /&gt; He died at ten years of age in 1964 of [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1492463/Art-world-goes-wild-for-chimpanzees-paintings-as-Warhol-work-flops.html |title=Art world goes wild for chimpanzee's paintings as Warhol work flops |work=[[Telegraph.co.uk]] |date=2008-06-21 |accessdate=2008-12-10 | location=London | first=Nigel | last=Reynolds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Media reaction to Congo's painting abilities were mixed, although relatively positive and accepted with interest. Spanish painter [[Pablo Picasso]] was reportedly a "fan" of his paintings, and hung one of the ape's pictures on his studio wall after receiving it as a gift.&lt;ref name="timesonline" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cbs" /&gt;

On June 20, 2005, Congo's paintings were included in an auction at [[Bonhams]] alongside works by [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]] and [[Warhol]]—they sold for more than expected, while Renoir's and Warhol's did not sell. American collector Howard Hong purchased three of Congo's works for over US$25,000.&lt;ref name="cbs" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4712948|title=No Chump Change for Chimp Art|accessdate=2008-06-01| date = 2005-06-21|work=[[All Things Considered]]|publisher=[[NPR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtop.com/?nid=502&amp;sid=605428|title=Paintings by Chimpanzee Outsell Warhol, Renoir at Auction|accessdate=2008-06-01|date=2005-11-29|publisher=Wtopnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4900">[[File:Princess Victoria and Dash by George Hayter.jpg|thumb|right|Dash with Princess Victoria, by Sir [[George Hayter]], 1833]]
'''Dash''' (1830–1840) was a [[King Charles Spaniel]] owned by [[Queen Victoria]]. Victoria's biographer [[Elizabeth Pakenham, Countess of Longford|Elizabeth Longford]], called him "the Queen's closest childhood companion",&lt;ref name=L155&gt;Longford, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; and in the words of the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', he "was the first in a long line of beloved little dogs".&lt;ref&gt;Matthew and Reynolds&lt;/ref&gt;

He was given to Victoria's mother, the [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|Duchess of Kent]], on 14 January 1833 by Sir [[John Conroy]], the [[Comptroller]] of the Duchess's household.&lt;ref name=L46&gt;Longford, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of April 1833, he had become Victoria's companion, and by Christmas that year she was doting on him, giving him a set of rubber balls and two pieces of gingerbread as presents.&lt;ref name=L46/&gt; In return, the dog was loyal to Victoria; on one occasion she went sailing on a yacht, and Dash leapt from the coastline into the sea and swam after her.&lt;ref name=L46/&gt;

Victoria, who was 13 when given Dash, had few if any childhood friends as she was raised largely isolated from other children under the so-called "[[Kensington System]]", an elaborate set of rules and protocols devised by the Duchess and Conroy.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, pp. 35–38, 118–119; Woodham-Smith, pp. 70–72&lt;/ref&gt; The only girl of a similar age with whom she had regular contact was Conroy's youngest daughter, [[Victoire Conroy|Victoire]], but they seemed to have had only a formal acquaintanceship.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Woodham-Smith, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; In her diary, Victoria refers to Victoire as "Miss Conroy" but the dog is showered with endearments: "dear sweet little Dash" and "dear Dashy".&lt;ref&gt;Woodham-Smith, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1834, Victoria and her mother took a holiday at [[St Leonards-on-Sea]]. They, with Dash, [[Lady Flora Hastings]] and [[Baroness Louise Lehzen]], were driving in a [[Landau (carriage)|landau]] drawn by two horses when the horses got caught in the traces and fell. With the horses struggling on the ground, there was a danger the carriage would overturn, injuring the women. Victoria scrambled out with Dash in her arms, and, as she recalled, "ran on with him in my arms calling Mama to follow, Lehzen and Lady Flora followed us also."&lt;ref&gt;Victoria's diary, 11 November 1834, quoted in Longford, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; While two passing gentlemen cut the horses free, the ladies, and Dash, took shelter behind a wall.&lt;ref&gt;Woodham-Smith, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Dash remained with Victoria after her accession as queen in 1837. Following her [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]] on 28 June 1838, Victoria returned to [[Buckingham Palace]] and ran up to her rooms to give Dash his usual bath.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 83; Strachey, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

Duration refers to the period of time a patient has to live, which can be anywhere from imminent death to several months.&lt;ref name=one /&gt; Shape refers to how that duration is then graphed. In other words, the shape is "the course of dying, its predictability, and whether death is expected or unexpected".&lt;ref name=one /&gt;

[[File:Sudden Death graph.png|thumb|Illustration of the premature death trajectory. There is a sharp decline in human function in a short period of time.|205x205px]]
Dying trajectories were first studied in the 1960s by two researchers, [[Barney Glaser]] and [[Anselm Strauss]], in an attempt to understand the end of human life from different ailments, including cancer.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fammed.washington.edu/palliativecare/requirements/resources/TrajectoryOfDying.htm |title=Trajectory of Dying |publisher=University of Washington |accessdate=20 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150306060758/http://www.fammed.washington.edu/palliativecare/requirements/resources/TrajectoryOfDying.htm |archivedate=6 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sudden death trajectory==
Sudden or premature death occurs when the death of an individual is not perceived to be imminent. In a sudden death trajectory, an otherwise healthy and high-functioning individual will suddenly and [[unnatural death|unexpectedly die]] without any observable indications of oncoming demise. People are at a high or normal level of functioning until the moment of death occurs. These types of deaths include fatal accidents and inconspicuous health issues like [[myocardial infarction]] or severe stroke. Deaths that align with a sudden death trajectory may happen over the course of a few days or in a matter of seconds.

==Chronic malady trajectory==
[[File:Length of Dying Process.png|thumb|A chronic malady trajectory showing an overall decline in health with intermittent rises and falls in human function.|left|187x187px]]The chronic malady trajectory occurs with types of death caused by [[autoimmune disease]]s such as [[HIV]] or other incurable illnesses. This process of death is characterized by an overall decline in health accompanied by [[Recrudescence|acute crises]] and intermittent [[Cure#Remission|recoveries]].&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; The chronic malady trajectory projects emotional stress or turmoil;&lt;ref name=one /&gt; the patient may eventually become [[Fatigue (medical)#Chronic fatigue|mentally]] and [[emotional exhaustion|emotionally exhausted]].

==Natural death trajectory==
[[File:Steady decline.png|thumb|A typical natural death trajectory chronicling a long, steady decline in health over time.]]
A natural death trajectory is typically a long, steady decline due to [[aging-associated diseases|old age]].&lt;ref&gt;Dolejs, Josef; Marešová, Petra. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5268335/ "Onset of mortality increase with age and age trajectories of mortality from all diseases in the four Nordic countries"], ''[[National Center for Biotechnology Information]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, the death trajectory is based on how the mind and body degenerate, including the speed of organ failure. In these cases, it is much easier to anticipate a person's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerstorf|first1=Denis|last2=Ram|first2=Nilam|last3=Lindenberger|first3=Ulman|last4=Smith|first4=Jacqui|title=Age and time-to-death trajectories of change in indicators of cognitive, sensory, physical, health, social, and self-related functions|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=2013|volume=49|issue=10|pages=1805–1821|doi=10.1037/a0031340|pmid=23356526|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0024-EC54-F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical care==

In the fields of [[histology]], [[pathology]], and [[cell biology]], '''fixation''' is the preservation of [[biological tissue]]s from decay due to [[Autolysis (biology)|autolysis]] or [[putrefaction]]. It terminates any ongoing biochemical reactions and may also increase the treated tissues' mechanical strength or stability. Tissue fixation is a critical step in the preparation of histological sections, its broad objective being to preserve cells and tissue components and to do this in such a way as to allow for the preparation of thin, stained sections. This allows the investigation of the tissues' structure, which is determined by the shapes and sizes of such macromolecules (in and around cells) as [[proteins]] and [[nucleic acids]].



== Purposes ==
In performing their protective role, fixatives denature proteins by coagulation, by forming additive compounds, or by a combination of coagulation and additive processes. A compound that adds chemically to macromolecules stabilizes structure most effectively if it is able to combine with parts of two different macromolecules, an effect known as cross-linking.
Fixation of tissue is done for several reasons. One reason is to kill the tissue so that postmortem decay (autolysis and putrefaction) is prevented.&lt;ref name="Carson"&gt;{{cite book |title=Histotechnology: A Self-Instructional Text |last=Carson |first=Freida L |authorlink= |author2=Christa Hladik |edition=3 |year=2009 |publisher=[[American Society for Clinical Pathology]] Press |location=Hong Kong |isbn=978-0-89189-581-7 |page=2 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fixation preserves biological material ([[biological tissue|tissue]] or [[biological cell|cells]]) as close to its natural state as possible in the process of preparing tissue for examination.  To achieve this, several conditions usually must be met.

First, a fixative usually acts to disable intrinsic biomolecules—particularly [[proteolysis|proteolytic]] [[enzyme]]s—which otherwise digest or damage the sample.

Second, a fixative typically protects a sample from extrinsic damage.  Fixatives are toxic to most common microorganisms ([[bacteria]] in particular) that might exist in a tissue sample or which might otherwise colonize the fixed tissue. In addition, many fixatives chemically alter the fixed material to make it less palatable (either indigestible or toxic) to opportunistic microorganisms.

Finally, fixatives often alter the cells or tissues on a molecular level to increase their mechanical strength or stability.  This increased strength and rigidity can help preserve the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] (shape and structure) of the sample as it is processed for further analysis.

Even the most careful fixation does alter the sample and introduce artifacts that can interfere with interpretation of cellular ultrastructure.  A prominent example is the bacterial ''[[mesosome]]'', which was thought to be an [[organelle]] in [[gram-positive bacteria]] in the 1970s, but was later shown by new techniques developed for [[electron microscopy]] to be simply an artifact of chemical fixation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ryter A |title=Contribution of new cryomethods to a better knowledge of bacterial anatomy |journal=Ann. Inst. Pasteur Microbiol. |volume=139 |issue=1 |pages=33–44 |year=1988 |pmid=3289587 |doi=10.1016/0769-2609(88)90095-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Friedrich, CL |author2=D Moyles |author3=TJ Beveridge |author4=REW Hancock  |title= Antibacterial Action of Structurally Diverse Cationic Peptides on Gram-Positive Bacteria |journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy |volume=44 |issue=8 |pages=2086–2092 |year=2000 |doi= 10.1128/AAC.44.8.2086-2092.2000 |pmc=90018 |pmid=10898680}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Standardization of fixation and other tissue processing procedures takes this introduction of artifacts into account, by establishing what procedures introduce which kinds of artifacts.  Researchers who know what types of artifacts to expect with each tissue type and processing technique can accurately interpret sections with artifacts, or choose techniques that minimize artifacts in areas of interest.

== Process ==

Fixation is usually the first stage in a multistep process to prepare a sample of biological material for [[microscopy]] or other analysis.  Therefore, the choice of fixative and fixation protocol may depend on the additional processing steps and final analyses that are planned. For example, immunohistochemistry uses antibodies that bind to a specific protein target. Prolonged fixation can chemically mask these targets and prevent antibody binding. In these cases, a 'quick fix' method using cold [[formalin]] for around 24 hours is typically used. Methanol (100%) can also be used for quick fixation, and that time can vary depending on the biological material. For example, [[MDA-MB 231]] human breast cancer cells can be fixed for only 3 minutes with cold methanol (-20 °C). For enzyme localization studies, the tissues should either be pre-fixed lightly only, or post-fixed after the enzyme activity product has formed.

{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

== Types ==
There are generally three types of fixation processes depending on the initial specimen:

'''Heat fixation:''' After a smear has dried at room temperature, the slide is gripped by tongs or a clothespin and passed through the flame of a Bunsen burner several times to heat-kill and adhere the organism to the slide. Routinely used with bacteria and archaea. Heat fixation generally preserves overall morphology but not internal structures.
Heat denatures the proteolytic enzyme and prevents autolysis. Heat fixation cannot be used in the [[capsular stain]] method as heat fixation will shrink or destroy the capsule ([[glycocalyx]]) and cannot be seen in stains.

'''Immersion:''' The sample of tissue is immersed in fixative solution of volume at a minimum of 20 times greater than the volume of the tissue to be fixed. The fixative must diffuse through the tissue to fix, so tissue size and density, as well as type of fixative must be considered.  This is a common technique for cellular applications.  Using a larger sample means it takes longer for the fixative to reach the deeper tissue.

'''Perfusion:''' Fixation via blood flow. The fixative is injected into the heart with the injection volume matching cardiac output. The fixative spreads through the entire body, and the tissue doesn't die until it is fixed. This has the advantage of preserving perfect morphology, but the disadvantages are that the subject dies and the cost of the volume of fixative needed for larger organisms is high.

== Chemical fixation ==
In both immersion and perfusion fixation processes, chemical fixatives are used to preserve structures in a state (both chemically and structurally) as close to living tissue as possible. This requires a chemical fixative.

{{uncited section|date=January 2018}}

=== Crosslinking fixatives - aldehydes ===
Crosslinking fixatives act by creating [[covalent bond|covalent chemical bonds]] between proteins in tissue.  This anchors soluble proteins to the [[cytoskeleton]], and lends additional rigidity to the tissue. Preservation of transient or fine cytoskeletal structure such as contractions during [[embryonic differentiation waves]] is best achieved by a pretreatment using microwaves before the addition of a cross linking fixative.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2430164/ Rapid Microwave Fixation of Cell Monolayers Preserves Microtubule-associated Cell Structures] J Histochem Cytochem. 2008 Jul; 56(7): 697–709. doi:  10.1369/jhc.7A7370.2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, N. Gordon, R.[http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/8152 Embryogenesis Explained] [[World Scientific Publishing]], Singapore, 2016 pg 527 &lt;/ref&gt;

The most commonly used fixative in histology is [[formaldehyde]]. It is usually used as a 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF), that is approx. 3.7%–4.0% formaldehyde in [[phosphate-buffered saline]]. Since formaldehyde is a gas at room temperature, formalin – formaldehyde gas dissolved in water (~37% w/v) – is used when making the former fixative. Formaldehyde fixes tissue by cross-linking the proteins, primarily the residues of the basic amino acid [[lysine]]. Its effects are reversible by excess water and it avoids formalin pigmentation. Paraformaldehyde is also commonly used and will depolymerise back to formalin when heated, also making it an effective fixative.  Other benefits to paraformaldehyde include long term storage and good tissue penetration. It is particularly good for immunohistochemistry techniques. The formaldehyde vapor can also be used as a fixative for cell smears.

Another popular [[aldehyde]] for fixation is [[glutaraldehyde]].  It operates in a similar way to formaldehyde by causing deformation of the alpha-helix structures in proteins. However glutaraldehyde is a larger molecule, and so the rate of diffusion across membranes is slower than formaldehyde. Consequently, glutaraldehyde fixation on thicker tissue samples may be hampered, but this can be overcome by reducing the size of the tissue sample. One of the advantages of glutaraldehyde fixation is that it may offer a more rigid or tightly linked fixed product&amp;mdash;its greater length and two aldehyde groups allow it to 'bridge' and link more distant pairs of protein molecules. It causes rapid and irreversible changes, is well suited for electron microscopy, works well at 4 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C, and gives the best overall cytoplasmic and nuclear detail. It is not ideal for immunohistochemistry staining.

Some fixation protocols call for a combination of formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde so that their respective strengths complement one another.

These crosslinking fixatives, especially formaldehyde, tend to preserve the [[secondary structure]] of [[protein]]s and may protect significant amounts of [[tertiary structure]] as well.

=== Precipitating fixatives - alcohols ===
Precipitating (or ''denaturing'') fixatives act by reducing the solubility of protein molecules and (often) by disrupting the [[hydrophobic]] interactions that give many proteins their tertiary structure.  The [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] and aggregation of proteins is a very different process from the crosslinking that occurs with the aldehyde fixatives.

The most common precipitating fixatives are [[ethanol]] and [[methanol]]. They are commonly used to fix frozen sections and smears. [[Acetone]] is also used and has been shown to produce better histological preservation than frozen sections when employed in the Acetone Methylbenzoate Xylene (AMEX) technique.

The protein denaturants – methanol, ethanol and acetone – are rarely used alone for fixing blocks unless studying nucleic acids.

[[Acetic acid]] is a denaturant that is sometimes used in combination with the other precipitating fixatives, such as Davidson's AFA.&lt;ref&gt;http://microvet.arizona.edu/research/aquapath/davidson.htm Davidson's AFA formulation at University of Arizona, Department of Veterinary Science and Microbiology website (accessed, Feb. 22, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;  The alcohols, by themselves, are known to cause considerable shrinkage and hardening of tissue during fixation while acetic acid alone is associated with tissue swelling; combining the two may result in better preservation of tissue [[morphology (biology)|morphology]].

=== Oxidizing agents ===
The oxidizing fixatives can react with various side chains of proteins and other biomolecules, allowing formation of crosslinks that stabilize tissue structure. However they cause extensive denaturation despite preserving fine cell structure and are used mainly as secondary fixatives.

[[Osmium tetroxide]] is often used as a secondary fixative when samples are prepared for [[electron microscopy]].  (It is not used for light microscopy as it penetrates thick sections of tissue very poorly.)

[[Potassium dichromate]], [[chromic acid]], and [[potassium permanganate]] all find use in certain specific histological preparations.

=== Mercurials ===
Mercurials such as B-5 and [[Zenker's fixative]] have an unknown mechanism that increases staining brightness and give excellent nuclear detail. Despite being fast, mercurials penetrate poorly and produce tissue shrinkage. Their best application is for fixation of hematopoietic and reticuloendothelial tissues. Also note that since they contain mercury care must be taken with disposal.

=== Picrates ===
Picrates penetrate tissue well to react with histones and basic proteins to form crystalline picrates with amino acids and precipitate all proteins. It is a good fixative for connective tissue, preserves glycogen well, and extracts lipids to give superior results to formaldehyde in immunostaining of biogenic and polypeptide hormones However, it causes a loss of basophils unless the specimen is thoroughly washed following fixation.

=== HOPE fixative ===
Hepes-glutamic acid buffer-mediated organic solvent protection effect (HOPE) gives formalin-like morphology, excellent preservation of protein antigens for immunohistochemistry and enzyme histochemistry, good RNA and DNA yields and absence of crosslinking proteins.

== Frozen sections ==
{{uncited section|date=January 2018}}
Small pieces of tissue (5×5×3mm) are placed in a cryoprotective embedding medium—OCT, TBS, or [[cryogel]]—then snap frozen in [[isopentane]] cooled by liquid nitrogen. Tissue is then sectioned in a freezing microtome or cryostat and sections are fixed in one of the following fixatives:
* absolute acetone for 10–15 seconds
* 95% ethanol for 10–15 seconds
* absolute acetone 10 seconds followed by 95% ethanol for 10 seconds.

=== Advantages ===
* Better preservation of antigenicity
* Minimal exposure to fixative
* Not exposed to the organic solvents
* Much faster than other forms of fixations

=== Disadvantages ===
* Lack of morphological detail
* Potential biohazard

== Factors affecting fixation ==
{{uncited section|date=January 2018}}

=== Acidity or basicity ===
Should be kept in the physiological range, between [[pH]] 4-9. The pH for the ultrastructure preservation should be buffered between 7.2 to 7.4

=== Osmolarity ===
Hypertonic solutions give rise to cell shrinkage.

Hypotonic solutions result in cell swelling and poor fixation.

10% neutral buffer formalin is 4% formaldehyde (1.33 osmolar) in PBS buffer (0.3 osmolar) sums to 1.63 osmolar.  This is a very hypertonic solution yet it has worked well as a general tissue fixation condition for many years in pathology labs. The size of tissue can also affect the fixation process.

=== Size of the specimen ===
1–4&amp;nbsp;mm thickness [0.5&amp;nbsp;cm]

=== Volume of the fixative ===
At least 15-20 times greater than tissue volume

=== Temperature ===
Increasing the temperature increases speed of fixation. However, care is required to avoid cooking the specimen. Fixation is routinely carried out at room temperature.

=== Duration ===
As a general rule, 1 hour per millimetre of tissue paraformaldehyde (PFA) must penetrate. So if we have a three-dimensional tissue block, it is the shortest dimension that determines fixation time.

=== Time from removal to fixation ===
Fixation is a chemical process, and time must be allowed for the process to complete. Although "over fixation" can be detrimental, under-fixation has recently been appreciated as a significant problem and may be responsible for inappropriate results for some assays.

Captain '''George Duff''' [[Royal Navy|RN]] (c. 1 February 1764 – 21 October 1805) was a British naval officer during the [[American War of Independence]], the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]], who was killed by a cannonball at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]].

== Early life ==

Born at [[Banff, Aberdeenshire|Banff]], [[Scotland]], the son of Banff Sheriff Clerk James Duff (1729–1804) by his marriage to Helen Skene 1734–1764, he was a kinsman (first cousin once removed) to the [[James Duff, 2nd Earl Fife|second]] and [[Alexander Duff, 3rd Earl Fife|third]] [[Earl of Fife|Earls of Fife]].&lt;ref name="Book of the Duffs 1914"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tayler |first=Alistair and Henrietta |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Book of the Duffs|year=1914 |publisher=William Brown |location=Edinburgh |id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George Duff had a passion for the sea from early childhood, stowing away on a merchant ship for a voyage when not yet a teenager. At thirteen he joined his great uncle Captain (later Admiral) [[Robert Duff (Royal Navy officer)|Robert Duff]] in the [[Mediterranean]], and was commissioned lieutenant at sixteen, breaking several fleet regulations but made possible by his uncle's interest in his career. During these years, Duff saw action thirteen times on both sides of the Atlantic, including at the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar]] and culminating in the [[battle of the Saintes]] in 1782 when he was serving on {{HMS|Montagu|1779|6}}.

== Naval career ==

With a reputation thus secured and plenty of family interest in his career, Duff had little difficulty progressing, being promoted to commander in 1790 and then [[Post Captain]] in 1793, a meteoric rise resulting from the growth of the Navy in the buildup to war during this period. It was at this time that he married his childhood sweetheart, Sophia Dirom (sister of [[Alexander Dirom]]) in [[Edinburgh]], and that his son [[Norwich Duff]] (later to become an admiral in his own right) was born.&lt;ref&gt;15 August 1792&lt;/ref&gt; In the next ten years, Duff commanded {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}}, {{HMS|Vengeance|1774|6}} and {{HMS|Glenmore}} all very capably, but without winning the acclaim of some of his contemporaries, particularly those in the Mediterranean under [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]].

Duff was a proud Scotsman as well as a strict disciplinarian. He enforced cleanliness parades every week, and made every effort to make sure that as many Scots as possible served on his ships, although he never gave them preferential treatment over their English comrades. He was also a devoted husband and wrote lengthy letters to his wife during every journey. He and his wife felt that the letters were so personal that they destroyed them after reading, and so the only survivor is his final letter home, which Sophia reportedly was unable to destroy.

Following the [[Peace of Amiens]], Duff was given {{HMS|Mars|1794|6}},&lt;ref&gt;April 1804&lt;/ref&gt; something of a celebrity ship in the Royal Navy following her capture of the French [[French ship Hercule|''Hercule'']] in 1799 in which her captain [[Alexander Hood (captain)|Alexander Hood]] was killed. Rapidly moulding the ship with his own brand of Scottish discipline, Duff took her to join the fleet off [[Cadiz]] at the beginning of October and instantly became friends with Nelson, despite their vastly different characters. Such was Duff's reputation, that Nelson entrusted him with the command of the inshore squadron, which watched the harbour entrance for an enemy appearance. The job was dangerous due to the proximity of the shore, and unpleasant because ships stationed at this point were exposed to the enemy and the threat of failure if the enemy were able to escape. Duff handled the job excellently however, and on 21 October reported that the enemy had left Cadiz and were heading out to sea.

== Trafalgar ==

When the battle began, ''Mars'' was stationed directly astern of {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}} and was ordered by Nelson to attempt to overtake this, [[Cuthbert Collingwood|Collingwood's]] flagship, if he was able. Collingwood however had the advantage, with the Royal Sovereign's hull having been freshly re-coppered before action, so the ''Mars'' was the second ship to enter the enemy lines. During this approach, which due to poor wind had been conducted at walking speed, Duff was able to write a final note home to his wife, which he entrusted to his thirteen-year-old son Norwich, who was serving as a [[midshipman]] on ''Mars'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Dearest Sophia, I have just time to tell you we are going into Action with the Combined Fleet. I hope and trust in God that we shall all behave as becomes us, and that I may yet have the happiness of taking my beloved wife and children in my arms. Norwich is quite well and happy. I have, however, ordered him off the quarter-deck. Yours ever, and most truly, George"''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Death ===

Duff did not see more than the few opening shots of the battle, for as ''Mars'' engaged the French [[French ship Fougueux|''Fougueux'']] and [[French ship Pluton (1804)|''Pluton'']], a cannonball from ''Fougueux'' raked the quarter-deck and struck Captain Duff at the base of the neck, severing his head completely. The crew were undismayed however, carrying the headless corpse around the deck and giving three cheers in memory of their captain, before replacing him where he fell and covering him with a Union Flag. Command of the ''Mars'' devolved on the first lieutenant, [[William Hennah]], who performed a good service and was promoted as a reward.

==Burial and memorial==

Following the battle, Duff was buried at sea with his shipmates, 28 of whom had been killed and 69 wounded in the fight. Both Collingwood and young Norwich Duff wrote letters of consolation to Sophia Duff, and Captain Duff was mentioned with honour alongside Nelson and [[John Cooke (naval officer)|John Cooke]] in the official report of the battle. [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]] granted Sophia honours and money. Norwich remained in the Navy, retiring many years later as an admiral. A large marble monument with the inscription "Erected at the Public Expense to the memory of Captain George Duff who was killed the XXIst of Octr MDCCCV. commanding the Mars in the battle of Trafalgar in the forty-second year of his age and the twenty-ninth of his service." was raised in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] on the wall on the south side of a passage, next to Nelson's tomb, where it can still be seen. George,&lt;ref&gt;The painting is on loan to the [[Royal Naval Museum]], Portsmouth&lt;/ref&gt; his mother-in-law Anne (née Fotheringham) and Norwich were all painted by Sir [[Henry Raeburn]].

==Namesakes==
The Royal Navy has named two ships after Duff. The first, a [[Captain-class frigate|Captain-class]] frigate constructed in the United States in 1942-1943 as HMS ''Duff'' (BDE-20), was retained by the [[United States Navy]] as the [[destroyer escort]] {{USS|LeHardy|DE-20}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/l5/lehardy.htm ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships'' ''LeHardy'']&lt;/ref&gt; The second was the Captain-class frigate {{HMS|Duff|K352}}, which served from 1943 to 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.captainclassfrigates.co.uk/ships/K352.html Captain Class Frigate Association: HMS Duff 352 (DE 64)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jiří Voskovec''' ({{IPA-cs|ˈjɪr̝iː ˈvoskovɛts|-|Jiri voskovec.ogg}}), born '''Jiří Wachsmann''' and known in the United States as '''George Voskovec''' (June 19, 1905 – July 1, 1981)&lt;ref&gt;[http://vitals.rootsweb.com/ca/death/search.cgi California Death Index]&lt;/ref&gt; was a Czech actor, writer, dramatist, and director who became an American citizen in 1955. Throughout much of his career he was associated with actor and playwright [[Jan Werich]]. In the US, he is best known for his role as the 11th juror in the 1957 film ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]''.

==Life and career==
Voskovec was born as Jiří Wachsmann in [[Sázava (Benešov District)|Sázava]], [[Bohemia]], present-day [[Czech Republic]]. He was the son of Jiřina (Pinkasová) and Václav Wachsmann.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.csfd.cz/tvurce/2019-jiri-voskovec/&lt;/ref&gt; His granduncle was [[Bedřich Wachsmann]] and his cousin was [[Alois Wachsman]], both painters and architects, while his uncle was Austrian painter Julius Wachsmann (1866–1936). He immigrated to the US in 1939 and again in 1948 with the onset of the [[Nazi]] and [[Stalinist]] regimes, respectively, in Czechoslovakia.

He attended school in [[Prague]] and [[Dijon]], [[France]]. In 1927, together with Werich, he joined the [[Osvobozené divadlo]] (Liberated Theater), which had been created two years earlier by members of the avant-garde Devětsil group, Jiří Frejka and Jindřich Honzl. After disagreements led Frejka to leave the group in 1927, Honzl asked Voskovec and Werich, 22-year-old law students who had created a sensation with their [[Vest Pocket Revue]] that year, to join the theatre. When Honzl, who had directed their productions, left in 1929, Voskovec and Werich took control of the theatre and changed its name to the Liberated Theatre of Voskovec and Werich, assuming all responsibility for direction, writing, librettos, and other artistic decisions. The Liberated became a center for Czech clownery, a reaction to contemporary political and societal problems. Their performances began with the primary goal of evoking laughter through fantasy, but with the changing political situation in Germany their work became increasingly anti-fascist, which led to the closure of the Liberated Theater after the [[Munich agreement]] in 1938.
Both Voskovec and Werich fled to the United States in early 1939. For the rest of his life, Voskovec lived primarily in the [[United States]], interrupted only by brief stays in Czechoslovakia in 1948 and in France from 1948 to 1950. Until the mid-1940s, Voskovec worked and wrote mostly with Jan Werich, but after Werich's return to [[Communist Czechoslovakia]], they met only a few more times. After his return to the United States in 1950, Voskovec was unjustly detained at [[Ellis Island]] for eleven months for his alleged sympathy for Communism.

Although Voskovec lived in three countries and his maternal grandmother was [[French people|French]], he always maintained that "I am a born and bred Czech." In 1955, he became an American citizen. As a result of his naturalization, he is sometimes referred to as "George Voskovec".

Voskovec acted in 72 movies. Only the first five of these were Czech; the rest were American or British. His most famous American movie role was as the 11th juror in ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]'' (1957), in which being a European immigrant to the U.S. was central to his role. His other famous films included ''[[The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (film)|The Spy Who Came in from the Cold]]'' (1965) and ''[[The Boston Strangler (film)|The Boston Strangler]]'' (1968), as renowned psychic [[Peter Hurkos]]. His last movie was ''[[Barbarosa]]'' (1982), with [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Gary Busey]]. In 1975, he published the Czech spoken [[Gramophone record|LP record]] "Relativně vzato", where he reflects on his life and world in general. A sleeve note for this LP was written by another notable Czech émigré, author [[Josef Škvorecký]]. Voskovec also appeared in the 1978 television film ''[[The Nativity (1978 film)|The Nativity]]'' and the 1980 film ''[[Somewhere in Time (film)|Somewhere in Time]]'', starring [[Christopher Reeve]] and [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]]. In 1981 Voskovec played [[Nero Wolfe supporting characters|Fritz Brenner]] in the NBC TV series ''[[Nero Wolfe (1981 TV series)|Nero Wolfe]]'' with [[William Conrad]] as Nero Wolfe.

==Death==
Voskovec died in 1981 of a heart attack in [[Pearblossom, California]], at the age of 76. He is survived by two daughters, Victoria and Georgeanne. His interment was at [[Olšany Cemetery]] in [[Prague]].

Minor planet [[2418 Voskovec-Werich]] discovered by [[Luboš Kohoutek]] is named after him and [[Jan Werich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-540-29925-7_2419|title=(2418) Voskovec-Werich In: Dictionary of Minor Planet Names |publisher=Springer |date=2003 |ISBN=978-3-540-29925-7 |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-29925-7_2419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some animals, like [[cnidaria]]ns, produce two germ layers (the [[ectoderm]] and [[endoderm]]) making them [[diploblastic]]. Other animals such as [[chordates]] produce a third layer (the [[mesoderm]]), between these two layers. making them [[triploblastic]]. Germ layers eventually give rise to all of an animal’s [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] and [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s through the process of [[organogenesis]].

[[File:Remak "Untersuchungen uber die...", 1855 Wellcome L0014201.jpg|thumb|Cleavage and division of the cell of an egg of a vertebrate (Remak, 1855).]]

[[Caspar Friedrich Wolff]] observed organization of the early embryo in leaf-like layers. In 1817, [[Heinz Christian Pander]] discovered three primordial germ layers while studying chick embryos. Between 1850 and 1855, [[Robert Remak]] had further refined the germ cell layer (''Keimblatt'') concept, stating that the external, internal and middle layers form respectively the epidermis, the gut, and the intervening musculature and vasculature.&lt;ref&gt;Remak, R.

Huxley|Huxley]] in 1871, and "[[ectoderm]]" and "[[endoderm]]" by [[Ray Lankester|Lankester]] in 1873.

== Evolution ==
[[Image:Gastrulation.png|thumb|300px|'''Gastrulation of a diploblast:''' The formation of germ layers from a (1) blastula to a (2) gastrula. Some of the ectoderm cells (orange) move inward forming the endoderm (red).]]

Among [[animal]]s, [[sea sponge|sponges]] show the simplest organization, having a single germ layer. Although they have [[Cellular differentiation|differentiated cells]] (e.g. [[Choanocyte|collar cell]]s), they lack true tissue coordination. [[Diploblastic]] animals, [[Cnidaria]] and [[Ctenophora]], show an increase in complexity, having two germ layers, the [[endoderm]] and [[ectoderm]]. Diploblastic animals are organized into recognisable tissues. All higher animals (from flatworms to humans) are [[triploblastic]], possessing a [[mesoderm]] in addition to the germ layers found in Diploblasts. Triploblastic animals develop recognizable organs.

==Development==
[[fertilisation|Fertilization]] leads to the formation of a [[zygote]]. During the next stage, [[cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]], [[mitosis|mitotic]] cell divisions transform the zygote into a hollow ball of cells, a [[blastula]]. This early embryonic form undergoes [[gastrulation]], forming a [[gastrula]] with either two or three layers (the germ layers). In all [[vertebrate]]s, these progenitor cells differentiate into all adult tissues and organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Developmental Biology | chapter = Comparative Embryology | first = Scott F | last = Gilbert | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9974/#A39 | publisher = Sinauer Associates | year = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[human embryogenesis |human embryo]], after about three days, the zygote forms a solid mass of cells by mitotic division, called a [[morula]]. This then changes to a [[blastocyst]], consisting of an outer layer called a [[trophoblast]], and an inner cell mass called the [[embryoblast]]. Filled with uterine fluid, the blastocyst breaks out of the [[zona pellucida]] and undergoes [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]]. The inner cell mass initially has two layers: the [[hypoblast]] and [[epiblast]]. At the end of the second week, a [[primitive streak]] appears. The epiblast in this region moves towards the primitive streak, dives down into it, and forms a new layer, called the [[endoderm]], pushing the hypoblast out of the way (this goes on to form the [[amnion]].) The epiblast keeps moving and forms a second layer, the [[mesoderm]]. The top layer is now called the [[ectoderm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Developmental Biology | chapter = Early Mammalian Development | first = Scott F | last = Gilbert | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10052/#A2620 | publisher = Sinauer Associates | year = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The germ layers==
===Endoderm===
[[Image:Endoderm2.png|thumb|200px|The [[endoderm]] produces tissue within the [[lung]]s, [[thyroid]], and [[pancreas]].]]
{{main article|Endoderm}}
The '''endoderm''' is one of the germ layers formed during animal [[embryogenesis]]. Cells migrating inward along the archenteron form the inner layer of the gastrula, which develops into the [[endoderm]].

The endoderm consists at first of flattened cells, which subsequently become columnar. It forms the epithelial lining of the whole of the [[gastrointestinal tract |digestive tract]] except part of the mouth and pharynx and the terminal part of the rectum (which are lined by involutions of the ectoderm). It also forms the lining cells of all the glands which open into the digestive tract, including those of the liver and pancreas; the epithelium of the auditory tube and tympanic cavity; the trachea, bronchi, and alveoli of the lungs; the [[urinary bladder |bladder]] and part of the urethra; and the follicle lining of the thyroid gland and thymus.

The [[endoderm]] forms: the stomach, the colon, the liver, the pancreas, the bladder, the epithelial parts of trachea, the [[lungs]], the pharynx, the thyroid, the parathyroid, and the intestines.

===Mesoderm===
[[Image:Mesoderm.png|thumb|275px|The [[mesoderm]] aids in the production of [[cardiac muscle]], [[skeletal muscle]], [[smooth muscle]], tissues within the [[kidney]]s, and [[red blood cell]]s.]]
{{main article|Mesoderm}}
The '''mesoderm''' germ layer forms in the [[embryo]]s of [[triploblastic]] [[animal]]s. During [[gastrulation]], some of the cells migrating inward contribute to the [[mesoderm]], an additional layer between the endoderm and the [[ectoderm]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The formation of a mesoderm leads to the development of a [[coelom]]. Organs formed inside a coelom can freely move, grow, and develop independently of the body wall while fluid cushions and protects them from shocks.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The [[mesoderm]] has several components which develop into tissues: intermediate mesoderm, paraxial mesoderm, lateral plate mesoderm, and chorda-mesoderm. The chorda-mesoderm develops into the notochord. The [[intermediate mesoderm]] develops into kidneys and gonads. The [[paraxial mesoderm]] develops into cartilage, skeletal muscle, and dermis. The [[lateral plate mesoderm]] develops into the circulatory system (including the heart and spleen), the wall of the gut, and wall of the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Developmental Biology | chapter = Paraxial and Intermediate Mesoderm | first = Scott F | last = Gilbert | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9997/ | publisher = Sinauer Associates | year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through cell signaling cascades and interactions with the ectodermal and endodermal cells, the mesodermal cells begin the process of differentiation.&lt;ref name="Brand 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brand|first=Thomas|title=Heart development: molecular insights into cardiac specification and early morphogenesis|journal=Developmental Biology|date=1 June 2003|volume=258|issue=1|pages=1–19|doi=10.1016/S0012-1606(03)00112-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[mesoderm]] forms: muscle ([[Smooth muscle tissue|smooth]] and [[Striated muscle tissue|striated]]), [[bone]], [[cartilage]], [[connective tissue]], [[adipose tissue]], [[circulatory system]], [[lymphatic system]], [[dermis]], [[genitourinary system]], [[serous membrane]]s, and [[notochord]].

===Ectoderm===
[[Image:Ectoderm.png|thumb|250px|The [[ectoderm]] produces tissues within the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]], aids in the formation of [[neuron]]s within the brain, and constructs [[melanocytes]].]]
{{main article|Ectoderm}}
The '''ectoderm''' generates the outer layer of the embryo, and it forms from the embryo's [[epiblast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Developmental Biology | chapter = Early Mammalian Development | first = Scott F | last = Gilbert | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10052/#A2620 | publisher = Sinauer Associates | year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ectoderm]] develops into the surface ectoderm, neural crest, and the neural tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Developmental Biology | chapter = The Central Nervous System and The Epidermis | first = Scott F | last = Gilbert | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10026/figure/A2869/ | publisher = Sinauer Associates | year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surface ectoderm develops into: [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]], [[hair]], [[nail (anatomy)|nails]], [[lens of the eye]], [[sebaceous glands]], [[cornea]], [[tooth enamel]], the epithelium of the mouth and nose.

The neural crest of the ectoderm develops into: [[peripheral nervous system]], [[adrenal medulla]], [[melanocytes]], facial cartilage, [[dentin]] of teeth.

The neural tube of the ectoderm develops into: [[brain]], [[spinal cord]], [[posterior pituitary]], [[motor neurons]], [[retina]].

Note: The anterior pituitary develops from the ectodermal tissue of Rathke's pouch.

===Neural crest===

Because of its great importance, the [[neural crest]] is sometimes considered a fourth germ layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hall BK |year=2000 |title=The neural crest as a fourth germ layer and vertebrates as quadroblastic not triploblastic |journal=Evolution &amp; Development |pmid=11256415 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=1520-541X&amp;date=2000&amp;volume=2&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=3 |volume=2 |pages=3–5 |doi=10.1046/j.1525-142x.2000.00032.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is, however, derived from the ectoderm.

{{Main|Inheritance}}
'''Historical inheritance systems''' are different systems of [[inheritance]] among various people.

Detailed [[anthropology|anthropological]] and [[sociology|sociological]] studies have been made about customs of [[patrilineality|patrilineal]] inheritance, where only male children can inherit. Some cultures also employ [[matrilineal]] succession, where property can only pass along the female line, most commonly going to the sister's sons of the decedent; but also, in some societies, from the mother to her daughters. Some ancient societies and most modern [[state (polity)|states]] employ [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] inheritance, without [[gender discrimination|discrimination based on gender]] and/or birth order.

==Cross cultural research about systems of inheritance==

===Land inheritance===

Land inheritance customs greatly vary across cultures. The Ethnographic Atlas gives the following data regarding land distribution: [[primogeniture]] predominates in 247 societies, while [[ultimogeniture]] prevails in 16. In 19 societies land is exclusively or predominantly given to the one adjudged best qualified, while equality predominates in 301 societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/9285782/Ethnographic-Atlas-Codebook |title=Ethnographic Atlas Codebook |journal=World Cultures |year=1998 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=86–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding land inheritance rules, in 340 societies sons inherit, in 90 other patrilineality|patrilineal heirs (such as brothers), in 31 sister's sons, in 60 other matrilineal heirs (such as daughters or brothers), and in 98 all children. In 43 societies land is given to all children, but daughters receive less. In 472 societies, the distribution of inherited land follows no clear rules or information is missing, while in 436 societies inheritance rules for real property do not exist or data is missing; this is partly because there are many societies where there is little or no land to inherit, such as in [[hunter-gatherer]], pastoral societies or societies.

Patrilineal primogeniture, where the eldest son inherits, was customary among
many cultures around the world. Patrilineal ultimogeniture, where the youngest son inherits, was customary among a number of cultures including: [[Fur people|Fur]], Fali, Sami (also called Lapp), Bashkir, Chuvash, [[Gagauz people|Gagauz]], Vep, Tatar, Achang, Ayi, [[Atayal people|Atayal]], Kachi, Biate, Chinantec, Hmar, Mro, [[Kom people (India)|Kom]], Purum and Lushei or Lushai (sometimes mistakenly taken for the whole Mizo people, especially in the past).

Among English peasants there was no clearly prevalent inheritance pattern, while Spanish Basques gave their land to the one considered best qualified, though they had a preference for sons. Giving more or less equal shares of land to sons, but excluded daughters was also common in many populations, as was giving relatively equal shares to both sons and daughters or slightly less to daughters. The same system prevails in contemporary Egypt and most Arab groups (see [[Sharia]]). Most non-Arab Muslims, with some exceptions (Caucasians, Iranians), historically followed their own inheritance customs, not those of the Sharia. In Ancient Egypt the eldest son inherited twice as much as other sons, and in earlier times he was the sole heir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Studies in Biblical Law: From the Hebrew Bible to the Dead Sea Scrolls |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |author=Brin, Gershon |year=1994 |pages=246 |isbn=9781850754848}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/30h78901#page-2 |title=Inheritance |publisher=UCLA Encyclopedia of Egyptology |author=Lippert, Sandra |year=2013 |pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[Lao people|Lao]], the Aceh, the Guanches, and the Minangkabau, all daughters inherited equal shares of land. The Cham, the [[Pnar people|Jaintia]], the Garo and the Khasi practiced female ultimogeniture. Primogeniture regardless of the sex of the child was customary among the Paiwan, the [[Ifugao]], the [[Chugach people|Chugach]] and the French Basques, while ultimogeniture regardless of the sex of the child was customary among the Chuvash and the Mari.

Bilateral primogeniture is a rarer custom of inheritance where the eldest son inherits from the father and the eldest daughter inherits from the mother. This practice was common among the Classic Mayas, who transmitted the family's household furnishings from mother to eldest daughter, and the family's land, houses and agricultural tools from father to eldest son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Some Postclassic Questions About The Classic Maya|first=Munro S. |last=Edmonson|url=http://www.mesoweb.com/pari/publications/rt04/edmonson.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also seen in the Greek island of Karpathos, where the family's house was transmitted from mother to eldest daughter, and the family's land was transmitted from father to eldest son.&lt;ref&gt;Vernier, 1984 {{full citation needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Igorot, the father's land is inherited by his eldest son and the mother's land is inherited by her eldest daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vanuatu.usp.ac.fj/sol_adobe_documents/usp%20only/customary%20law/mendoza.pdf |title=Population Growth and Customary Law on Land: the case of Cordillera villages in the Philippines |publisher=National University of Ireland, Maynooth |author1=Crisologo-Mendoza, Lorelei  |author2=Van de Gaer, Dirk |date=November 1997|accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of numerous studies found that the pattern of land inheritance traditionally prevalent among English, Dutch and New Englander peasants was [[partible inheritance]]. The pattern of land inheritance traditionally prevalent among Russian peasants was found to be close to patrilineal primogeniture, "as oldest sons may well inherit more". The conclusions of this review contradicts previous reports that Russians practiced equal inheritance of land by all sons and that the English, Dutch and New Englanders had no definite inheritance pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vkc.library.uu.nl/vkc/seh/Lists/Events/Attachments/33/carmichaelrijpma_testing.pdf |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017081054/http://vkc.library.uu.nl/vkc/seh/Lists/Events/Attachments/33/carmichaelrijpma_testing.pdf |archive-date=17 October 2013 |title=Testing Todd: global data on family characteristics |date=May 2013 |accessdate=5 June 2014 |author1=Rijpma, Auke  |author2=Carmichael, Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In easternmost Europe, Patrilineal ultimogeniture prevailed among most Turkic peoples. Equal inheritance of property by all sons prevailed among most [[Uralic peoples|Uralic]] and Finno-Ugric peoples, and patrilineal primogeniture prevailed among Estonians and Balts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Ethnographic Atlas XXXI: Peoples of Easternmost Europe |authorlink1=Dmitri Bondarenko|last1=Bondarenko|first1=Dmitri|last2=Kazankov|first2=Alexander|last3=Khaltourina|first3=Daria|authorlink4=Andrey Korotayev|last4=Korotayev|first4=Andrey|journal=Ethnology |date=Summer 2005  |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=261–289 |doi=10.2307/3774059 |jstor=3774059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inheritance customs are sometimes considered a culturally distinctive aspect of a society. Although it is often thought that the [[Mizo people|Mizos]] employ ultimogeniture, this is because the customs of [[Lushai]]s or [[Lusheis]] are confused with those of all Mizos; Mizo and Lushai have been occasionally used interchangeably. Among most non-Lushai Mizos, primogeniture predominates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Social, Cultural, Economic &amp; Religious Life of a Transformed Community: A Study of the Paite Tribe |publisher=Mittal Publications |author=Liankhohau, T. |year=1994 |pages=22 |isbn=9788170995203}}&lt;/ref&gt; just as among Kukis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kukiforum.com/2010/06/customary-laws-of-the-kukis-2/ |title=Customary Laws of the Kukis |publisher=Kuki International Forum |date=20 June 2010 |accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general there is great confusion about the ethnic identity of the many northeastern Indian tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Chin-Kuki-Ethnic Dilemma: Search for an Appropriate Identity|date=25 April 2007|first=Chawnglienthang|last=Changsan|url=http://kukiforum.com/2007/04/the-chin-kuki-ethnic-dilemma-search-for-an-appropriate-identity-2/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some regard the generic term [[Zomi]] as most appropriate.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Inheritance of movable property===

The same disparity is seen regarding inheritance of movable property. Most nomadic peoples from Asia, for example the [[Khalka Mongols]], give a more or less equal share of the herd to each son as he marries. Typically the youngest remain behind caring for the parents and inheriting his father's tent after their death in addition to his own share of the herd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Agricultural and Pastoral Societies in Ancient and Classical History |publisher=Temple University Press |author=Adas, Michael |year=2001 |pages=76 |isbn=9781566398329}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others, such as the [[Yukaghir]] and the Yakuts, leave most of the herd to one son (in the above examples the youngest and the eldest, respectively). Some pastoral peoples from other geographical areas also practice unequal wealth transfers, although customs of equal male inheritance are more common among them than among agriculturalists.

Patrilineal primogeniture with regards to both livestock and land was practiced by the [[Tswana people]], whose main source of wealth was livestock, although they also practiced agriculture.&lt;ref name="etudesafricaines.revues.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Batswana Women and Law Society, Education and Migration (c. 1840 – c. 1980)|first=Lily|last=Mafela|url=http://etudesafricaines.revues.org/7962}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uir.unisa.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10500/4515/Nkomozana-SHEXXXIV_2_-December2008.pdf?sequence=1 |title=The experiences of women within Tswana cultural history and its implications for the history of the church in Botswana |publisher=University of Botswana, |accessdate=5 June 2014 |author=Nkomazana, Fidelis |pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Handbook of Tswana Law and Custom |publisher=James Currey Publishers |author=Schapera, I. |year=1994 |pages=230 |isbn=9780852552940}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice was also seen in other southern Bantu peoples,&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book |title=Customary Law in South Africa |publisher=Juta |author=Bennett, T. W. |year=1994 |isbn=9780702163616}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Tsonga people|Tsonga]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dice.missouri.edu/docs/niger-congo/Tsonga.pdf |title=Tsonga people |accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Venda]].&lt;ref name="dice.missouri"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dice.missouri.edu/docs/niger-congo/Venda.pdf |title=Venda |accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, among the Venda, while the livestock was inherited by the eldest son, land was not inherited within families but given to each son by village authorities as he married. Current practice in Venda means the youngest son will inherit the house or property. Equally within the current Venda chief succession the youngest son is his father's successor. Among the Tsonga, most of the land was used only for stockbreeding. Patrilineal primogeniture also prevailed among the neighboring Khoi peoples, of whom only the [[Nama people|Nama]] (among whom patrilineal primogeniture also prevailed)remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Khoisan Peoples of South Africa |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul |author=Schapera, Isaac |year=1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other African peoples also practiced patrilineal primogeniture with regards to livestock. These included: The [[Ngoni people|Ngoni]], the Gogo, the Mangbetu, the Rendille, the [[Sapo people|Sapo]], the Boran, the Gabra, the Plains [[Pokot people|Pokot]], the Hema, the Beti-Pahuin, the Buduma, the [[Dogon people|Dogon]], the Duala, the Djafun and the [[Kassena people|Kassena]]. According to the Ethnographic Atlas, the Fulbe or Fulani, the largest pastoral people in Africa, divided their livestock equally between all sons. However, according to some other sources they practiced male primogeniture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Who Owns the Stock?: Collective and Multiple Property Rights in Animals |publisher=Berghahn Books |author1=Khazanov, Anatoly Michailovich  |author2=Schlee, Günther |year=2012 |pages=242 |isbn=9780857453358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chukchi people|Chukchi]], Koryak and [[Ket people|Ket]] peoples practiced male ultimogeniture. It has been stated that the rest of Siberian peoples, such as Voguls, [[Samoyedic peoples|Samoyeds]] or Khantys, practiced patrilineal primogeniture, though there isn't much reliable information about the traditional customs of Siberian peoples. It is said that [[Gilyaks]] divided their cattle equally between all sons. Patrilineal primogeniture was also traditionally prevalent among pastoral peoples from Australia, such as the [[Aranda people|Aranda]], as well as among Himalayan pastoralists like the Changpa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.krepublishers.com/02-Journals/JHE/JHE-33-0-000-11-Web/JHE-33-3-000-11-Abst-PDF/JHE-33-3-147-11-2176-Bhasin-V/JHE-33-3-147-11-2176-Bhasin-V-Tt.pdf |title=Pastoralists of Himalayas |author=Bhasin, Veena |journal=J Hum Ecol |year=2011 |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=147–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrilineal primogeniture was traditionally prevalent among some pastoral peoples from Greenland and northern Canada. The neighboring indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast were organized in societies where elder sons and their lines of descent had higher status than younger sons and their lines of descent (a "conical clan"), although a rule of patrilineal primogeniture couldn't develop among most of them since they were mostly hunter-gatherers. However, rule of patrilineal primogeniture did develop among some Canadian indigenous peoples who practiced agriculture, such as the [[Innu people|Montagnais]], the Kutchin, the Pikangikum, the [[Ojibwa people|Ojibwa]], the Klallam and the Atsugewi. Canadian indigenous peoples were influenced by the ancient [[Thule people|Thule]] culture, of which little is known with certainty.

===Other sources===

Intergenerational wealth transmission among agriculturalists tends to be rather unequal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Intergenerational Wealth Transmission among Agriculturalists|url=http://web.missouri.edu/~shenkm/docs/Shenk2010_CurrentAnthropology.pdf|author=Shenk, M K|journal=Current Anthropology|date=Feb 2010|volume=51|issue=1|pages=65–83|doi=10.1086/648658}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only slightly more than half of the societies studied practice equal division of real property; customs to preserve land relatively intact (most commonly primogeniture) are very common. Wealth transfers are more egalitarian among pastoralists, but unequal inheritance customs also prevail in some of these societies, and they are strongly patrilineal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://web.missouri.edu/~shenkm/docs/Shenk2010_CurrentAnthropology.pdf |title=Pastoralism and Wealth Inequality |author=Mulder, M B |journal=Current Anthropology |date=Feb 2010  |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=35–48 |doi=10.1086/648561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of 39 non-Western societies found many customs that distinguished between children according to their sex and birth order. First sons, in comparison to other sons, "are likely to inherit or otherwise gain control of more family land, livestock, or other wealth." First sons inherited more than the other sons among 11 societies studied. Among the [[Todas]], both first and last sons inherited more than the other sons. Last sons inherited more than the other sons among the [[Yi people|Lolo]] and the Yukaghir, and inherited less among the [[Luo people of Kenya and Tanzania|Luo]]. The people found to have the greatest number of customs favourable to first sons in the study were the Tswana, followed closely by the Azande. The people with the greatest number of customs favorable to last sons in their study were the Lolo.

The only custom that distinguished between sons among the Dagor Mongols was that first sons received more respect from his siblings and last sons received less respect from their siblings. This contradicts those theories that maintain that peoples of the Asian steppe had strong customs favorable to first or last sons. In fact, the indigenous American peoples had significantly more customs favorable to first sons than the Dagor Mongols.&lt;ref name=Rosenblatt/&gt;

Among Arab peoples, such as the Egyptian Fellahin, all sons inherited the same and had the same wealth. This was also seen among the Alaska Native peoples such as the [[Eyak people|Eyak]].&lt;ref name=Rosenblatt/&gt;

[[Jack Goody]] was an influential anthropologist during the twentieth century. However, his theories have been mostly rejected during the last decades.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} He made a distinction between a complete and a preferential form of primogeniture and ultimogeniture. In the complete form of both customs, the rest of the children are excluded from the inheritance. However, in the preferential form of primogeniture, the eldest son acts as custodian of the father's rights on behalf of his brothers. In the preferential form of ultimogeniture, the youngest son inherits the residue of his father's property after elder sons have received their shares during the father's lifetime. Goody called ultimogeniture "Borough English" and primogeniture "Borough French" because in England ultimogeniture was a native custom, while primogeniture was a custom brought by the Norman invaders. According to Goody, in Late Medieval England, patrilineal primogeniture predominated in feudal tenures and among the peasantry of large parts of the Midlands. Patrilineal ultimogeniture ("Borough English") prevailed elsewhere in the champion country. Partible inheritance (''gavelkind'') prevailed in Kent, East Anglia and the Celtic areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Death and the Ancestors: A Study of the Mortuary Customs of the LoDagaa of West Africa|author= Goody, Jack|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=9781136528842}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both preferential primogeniture and preferential ultimogeniture were practiced in pre-revolutionary Russia, where the eldest son succeeded as family head and inherited more than the other sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Peasant Inheritance Strategies in Russia |author= Bohac, Rodney D. |journal=The Journal of Interdisciplinary History |volume= 16|issue= 1|year = 1985|pages= 23–42|doi=10.2307/204320 |jstor=204320}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The youngest son, if he remained with the father, inherited the house and also at times other property" (''minorat'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Minorat|title=Minorat|publisher=Great Soviet Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the share of land and moveables of the other sons was only slightly smaller than that of the eldest and the youngest son.

The Russian family of around 1900 considered property such as the house, agricultural implements, livestock and produce as belonging collectively to all family members. When the father died, his role as head of the family (known as Khozain, or Bolshak ) was passed to the oldest person in the house. In some areas this was the oldest son. In others it was the oldest brother of the deceased so long as he lived in the same house. There were some areas were a new head would be elected by the family members. If all surviving members of the family were under age, a relation would become a co-proprietor. If property was divided after a death, each adult male in the house got an equal share. Sons who had left home did not have a right of succession. Females remained within the family and received a share of the inheritance when they married. In the north of Russia, the oldest son inherited the house. In the south the eldest son would have set up a separate house while the father was still alive, therefore the youngest inherited the fathers house upon his death.&lt;ref name="efm.bris.ac.uk"/&gt;

==Systems of inheritance among various peoples==
Throughout history, creative inheritance systems have been created, fitting the best needs of the various people according to their unique environment and challenges.

==Inheritance customs as a cultural dimension==

Inheritance customs do not follow clear ethnic, linguistic or geographical patterns.

Sometimes inheritance customs do not entirely reflect social traditions.

Among [[Mongols]] it has been usually stated that the youngest son had a special position because he cared for his parents in their old age. On their death he inherited the parental tent, which was connected with the religious cult in Mongol traditions, though all sons received more or less equal shares of livestock as they married. However, in contrast to this popularly held notion, more rigorous and substantiated anthropological studies of kinship and family in central Asian peoples strongly indicate that in these societies elder sons and their lines of descent had higher status than younger sons and their lines of descent. In central Asia, all members of a lineage were terminologically distinguished by generation and age, with senior superior to junior. The lineage structure of central Asia had three different modes: genealogical distance, or the proximity of individuals to one another on a graph of kinship; generational distance, or the rank of generation in relation to a common ancestor; and birth order, the rank of brothers in relation to each another.&lt;ref&gt;Cuisenier (1975:67)&lt;/ref&gt; The paternal descent lines were collaterally ranked according to the birth of their founders, and were thus considered senior and junior to each other. Of the various collateral patrilines, the senior in order of descent from the founding ancestor, the line of eldest sons, was the most noble. In the steppe, no one had his exact equal; everyone found his place in a system of collaterally ranked lines of descent from a common ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;Krader (1963:322, 269)&lt;/ref&gt; It was according to this idiom of superiority and inferiority of lineages derived from birth order that legal claims to superior rank were couched.&lt;ref name="Kinship structure and political authority" /&gt; Furthermore, at least among Mongols, the elder son inherited more than the younger son, and this is mandated by law codes such as the [[Yassa]], created by [[Genghis Khan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Influence of the Great Code "Yasa" on the Mongolian Empire |url=http://www.mypolice.ca/research_and_publications/MongolianLawCodeYasa.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130615073730/http://www.mypolice.ca/research_and_publications/MongolianLawCodeYasa.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, inheritance customs were (and still are) very diverse. Patrilineal primogeniture predominated in ancient times.

==Fertility and marriage strategies across diverse societies==

===Cross-cultural comparisons===

The practice of [[widow inheritance]] by younger brothers has been observed in many parts of Africa and the Asian steppe, as well as small zones of South Asia. This practice forces younger brothers to marry older women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://case.edu/affil/tibet/tibetanSociety/documents/02.pdf |title=Why Polyandry Fails: Sources of Instability in Polyandrous Marriages |author1=Levine, Nancy E.  |author2=Silk, Joan B. |journal=Current Anthropology |date=June 1997  |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=375–398 |doi=10.1086/204624}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern European cultures, on the other hand, are characterized by early, universal and equal access to marriage and reproduction, due to their systems of equal inheritance of land and movable property by all sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/pop_1634-2941_2004_num_59_6_18495 |title=Peasant Marriage in Nineteenth-Century Russia |author1=troitskaia, I. |author2=Blum, A. |author3=Avdeev, A. |journal=Population |year=2004 |volume=59 |issue=6 |pages=721–764 |doi=10.3917/pope.406.0721}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on pre-industrial [[Russian Karelia]] however, suggests that younger brothers frequently remained unmarried,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rjh.ub.rug.nl/ha/article/download/2091/2083+ |title=Marriage behaviour in pre-industrial Karelian rural parishes |publisher=Nederlands Agronomisch Historisch Instituut |date=2009 |accessdate=6 June 2014 |author=Cherniakova, Irina}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the joint-family household characterized by the equal inheritance of land and moveable property by all sons and patriarchal power relations wasn't universal in Russia.

The patrilineal joint-family systems and more or less equal inheritance for all son in India and China meant that there was no difference in marriage and reproduction due to birth order. In the stem-family systems of Northwest Europe however, access to marriage and reproduction wasn't equal for all sons, since only one of them would inherit most or all of the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Lifeboat Ethic versus Corporate Ethic: Social and Demographic Implications of Stem and Joint Families |author=Gupta, Das Monica |journal=The World Bank |date=May 1999  |pages=27 |doi=10.1596/1813-9450-2127|series = Policy Research Working Papers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Han Chinese first sons historically married earlier, had lower rates of definitive celibacy and more children (especially males) than their younger brothers. However, they suffered higher mortality rates. This has been attributed to the fact that eldest sons needed to have more children to succeed them as heads and were willing to take more risks and suffer a higher drain of resources to achieve this.&lt;ref name="fateandfortune"/&gt; The Chinese joint family system had strong [[inegalitarian]] traits that made it demographically more akin to a stem family system. According to [[Emmanuel Todd]] and others, it be reminiscent of the system of patrilineal primogeniture prevalent during the [[Longshan culture]] period and the period of the [[Three Kingdoms|Three Dynasties]].&lt;ref name="Lamberg-Karlovsky 1991"/&gt;

===Variations by class and context===

There is a strong relationship between fertility and inheritance in "Malthusian" contexts of resource scarcity. In contexts where resources are plentiful, the relationship between inheritance and social outcomes can be different. In the Midwest and Northeast United States during the period from 1775 to 1875, where resources were plentiful, being the first son was positively correlated with wealth and fertility. As in other western cultures, but unlike European societies where resources were scarce, this has a complex relationship with inheritance.&lt;ref name="Farm family economy"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The farm family economy in the American North, 1775–1875: an exploration of sibling differences |author1=Adams, John W.  |author2=Kasakoff, Alice Bee |journal=Continuity and Change |date=Dec 1992  |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=357–375 |doi=10.1017/S0268416000001715}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inheritance practices and seniority of patriline, as well as the importance of inheritance itself, have varied over time among the [[Lisu people|Lisu]]. This was mostly in response to changes in resource availability and poppy cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10524/1545/gillogly_dissertation.pdf?sequence=1 |title=Transformations of Lisu Social Structure Under Opium Control and Watershed Conservation in Northern Thailand |author=Gillogly, Kathleen A. |journal=The University of Michigan |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In northern Ghana, a region where male primogeniture predominates, rich households favoured sons over daughters.

==Cultural patterns of child-preference==

In recent times inheritance in the western world has generally been egalitarian despite parents showing favoritism towards daughters and later-born sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Birth order, sex of child, and perceptions of parental favoritism |author1=Salmon, Catherine A. |author2=Shackelford, Todd K. |author3=Michalski, Richard L. | journal=Personality and Individual Differences |date=Feb 2012  | volume=52 | issue=3 | pages=357–362 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2011.10.033}}&lt;/ref&gt; In parent-son relationships, mothers usually show favouritism towards the first son and fathers to later born sons however these tendencies have lost much of their importance with regards to inheritance.

Customs of ultimogeniture among farmers has been explained as a consequence of postponing retirement so they do not feel "dethroned" early by their eldest son. This line of thinking has been linked to the preeminence of lastborn siblings in popular myth and folklore around the world. As a consequence, in some cultures that practice male preimogentiure there are ambiguous, contradictory feelings towards last born sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The 'Last Born' (Muxogosi) and Complementary Filiation in Tiriki, Kenya | author=Sangree, Walter H. | journal=Ethos |date=Fall 1981  | volume=9 | issue=3 | pages=188–200 | doi=10.1525/eth.1981.9.3.02a00020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Hausa of West Africa, who practice primogeniture, the mother and oldest son engage in mutual avoidance behavior to mark the woman's positive change in status upon producing an heir. The father may also avoid the son if he is the mother's first male child, speaking to him through intermediaries rather than directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Hausa of Nigeria | publisher=University Press of America | author=Salamone, Frank A. | year=2010 | pages=2 | isbn=9780761847243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[Mossi people|Mossi]] of central Burkina Faso in West Africa, the eldest son would be sent to relatives shortly after circumcision and return to the parental household shortly after puberty; after the death of his father he would inherit his property.

A study of the people of the Pacific island Tikopia in 1929 found that the eldest son must marry and receive more land, while the younger sons remain bachelors, emigrate or even die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=We the Tikopia: A sociological study of kinship in primitive Polynesia | publisher=Routledge | author=Firth, Raymond | year=2013 | isbn=9781136538087}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1952 many of the customs were being abandoned and marriage was beginning to become universal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Social Change in Tikopia: Re-study of a Polynesian Community After a Generation | publisher=Routledge | author=Firth, Raymond | year=2013 | pages=195 | isbn=9781136537455}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the succession to chieftainship, the traditional custom of male primogeniture continued though.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Succession To Chieftainship in Tikopia | publisher=Ardent Media | author=Firth, Raymond | year=1960 | pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some societies in Sub-Saharan Africa where male primogeniture was practiced, tensions between parents and their inheriting eldest son were resolved through rituals of avoidance. This was most extreme among the [[Tallensi]]. Among East Asian peoples, on the other hand, co-residence between parents and their eldest son was thought of as normal and desirable in systems of impartible inheritance, and in some countries such as Japan, Vietnam and South Korea it is widely practiced even nowadays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Is the Eldest Son Different?

In Japan, Korea and Vietnam, as well as in some of those European regions where male primogeniture was practiced, parents didn't transfer their property to the inheriting son at the point of his marriage as among Germans. Instead, the first son remained under his father's authority even after he had married and had had children, and the father remained the nominal head of the family until his death, relinquishing his actual authority slowly and gradually. In Japan, only the inheriting son stayed in the parental household. He could become head of the family any time between his marriage and the death of his predecessor. The timing of this was normally dictated by familial or local traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://hermes-ir.lib.hit-u.ac.jp/rs/bitstream/10086/13400/1/0100700701.pdf | title=Marriage, family labour and the stem family household: traditional Japan in a comparative perspective | author=Saito, Osamu | journal=Continuity and Change | year=2000 | volume=15 | issue=1 | pages=17–45 | doi=10.1017/s026841609900346x| hdl=10086/13400 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catalan and Occitan stem families in Europe closely resembled the model seen in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/RASO/article/viewFile/RASO9191110179A/10771 | title=Sucesión unipersonal y familia troncal en la "Catalunya Vella" | author=Barrera González, Andrés | journal=Revista de Antropología Social | year=1991 | pages=179–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Barrera | first=Andrés | chapter=Primogenitura y herencia en la 'Catalunya Vella': Norma ideal y práctica actual | title=Los Pirineos: estudios de antropología social e historia | publisher=Casa de Velázquez| year=1986 | pages=177 | isbn=9788474912012 | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ura6R3KcBN8C&amp;pg=PA177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In rural China, property and landholdings are usually divided up when the older son marries.
Normally the youngest son continues to live with the parents and inherits their remaining share of the property. Prior to the [[Chinese Communist Revolution|revolution]] in 1949, most families in rural areas of China stayed together for many years after the oldest son marries, sometimes until the youngest son married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ips.cap.anu.edu.au/sites/default/files/IPS/PSC/CCC/publications/papers/JU_Family_Customs.pdf | title=Family Customs and Farmland Reallocations in Contemporary Chinese Villages | accessdate=9 June 2014 | author=Unger, Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is some evidence that the practice of co-residing with the eldest son continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Intergenerational Transfers and Living Arrangements of Older People in Rural China: Consequences for Psychological Well-Being |author1=Silverstein, Merril |author2=Zhen Cong |author3=Shuzhuo Li | journal=J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci |date=September 2006  | volume=61B |issue=5 | pages=S256–66 | pmid=16960239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Israel, coresidence between parents and their eldest son prevails in the context of the [[Moshav]] movement, that prohibited breaking up family plots; thus the eldest son inherits the family farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Altruism and Beyond: An Economic Analysis of Transfers and Exchanges Within Families and Groups | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Stark, Oded | year=1999 | pages=43 | isbn=9780521663731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Korea, modern businesses ([[chaebol]]) are handed down according to male primogeniture in most cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The State, Society and Big Business in South Korea | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | author=Lee, Yeon-Ho | year=2002 | isbn=9780203075074}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of family firms in the UK, France, Germany and US found that male primogeniture was the inheritance rule in more than half of family firms in France and the UK, but only in less than a third of those in the US and only in a quarter (25 per cent) of those in Germany.

==Social approaches to inheritance customs==

Employing differing forms of succession can affect many areas of society. Gender roles are profoundly affected by inheritance laws and traditions. Impartible inheritance has the effect of keeping large estates united and thus perpetuating an elite. With partible inheritance large estates are slowly divided among many descendants and great wealth is thus diluted. Inheritance customs can even affect gender differences in cognitive abilities. Among the [[Karbis]], who employ male primogeniture, men perform significantly better than women in tasks of spatial abilities. There are no significant differences in the performance of men and women among the Khasis, who employ female ultimogeniture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://rady.ucsd.edu/faculty/directory/gneezy/pub/docs/pnas_published.pdf | title=Nurture affects gender differences in spatial abilities |author1=Hoffman, Moshe |author2=Gneezy, Uri |author3=List, John A. | journal=PNAS | year=2011 | volume=108 | issue=36 | pages=14786–14788 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1015182108 | pmid=21876159 | pmc=3169128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree of acceptance that a society may show towards an inheritance rule can also vary. In South Africa, for example, the influence of more modern, western social ideas has caused strong opposition, both civil and official, to the customary law of patrilineal primogeniture traditionally prevalent among black peoples, and inheritance customs are gradually changing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.dejure.up.ac.za/index.php/volumes/45-vol-3-2012/18-volumes/45-volume-3-2012/122-article-7 | title=The judicial and legislative reform of the customary law of succession |author1=Bekker, JC  |author2=Koyana, DS | journal=De Jure | year=2012 | volume=45 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the indigenous tribes of South Africa, the oldest son inherits after the death of the father. If the oldest son is also dead, the oldest surviving grandson inherits; if the eldest son has no sons, the inheritance is passed to the father's second son or his sons, and so on through all the sons and their male children if necessary. In [[polygynous]] families which were formed of multiple units, the inheritance rules were changed slightly. Each marriage formed a new unit, independent from the others, with separate property which was inherited by the heir of each unit. Polygynous families practised either simple or complex inheritance. In the simple system the heir is the eldest son of the first wife, of if he is dead, the eldest grandson. If the first wife had no sons, the inheritance went to the oldest surviving male descendant of the second wife, and so on through all the wives if necessary. Complex inheritance happened when the homestead was separated into two or three units, depending on the number of wives, and the eldest son of each wife became heir of their unit. If there was no heir in one of the units, the heir of the other inherited both. This form of inheritance was seen among the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] people of south eastern South Africa.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

In [[Lesotho]] and southern Ethiopia, most people still follow the custom of male primogeniture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Chieftainship Succession and Gender Equality in Lesotho: Negotiating the Right to Equality in a Jungle of Pluralism | author=Juma, Laurence | journal=Texas Journal of Women &amp; the Law |date=Spring 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Land inheritance establishes sibling competition for marriage and reproduction in rural Ethiopia |author1=Gibson, Mhairi A.  |author2=Gurmu, Eshetu | journal=PNAS | year=2010 | volume=108 | issue=6 | pages=2200–2204 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1010241108 | pmid=21262826 | pmc=3038728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social transformations can also modify inheritance customs to a great extent. For example, the [[Samburu people|Samburu]] of north-central Kenya are pastoralists who have traditionally practiced an attenuated form of patrilineal primogeniture, with the eldest son receiving the largest share of the family herd and each succeeding son receiving a considerably smaller share than any of his seniors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Samburu: A Study in Geocentracy | publisher=Spencer, Paul Taylor &amp; Francis | author=Spencer, Paul | year=2003 | isbn=9780203584811}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now that many of them have become agriculturalists, some argue that land inheritance should follow patrilineal primogeniture, while others argue for equal division of the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.isnie.org/ISNIE06/Papers06/03.2/lesorogol.pdf | title=Understanding Institutional Emergence: Land Inheritance among Samburu pastoralists in Kenya | publisher=Washington University in St. Louis | date=August 2006 | accessdate=10 June 2014 | author=Lesorogol, Carolyn K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bhil]] people of central India, who were hunter-gatherers in the past, adopted a system of attenuated patrilineal primogeniture identical to that of pastoral [[Samburu people|Samburu]] when they became agriculturalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.sabrizain.org/malaya/library/enc-sa.pdf | title=Encyclopedia of World Cultures, Volume III, South Asia | publisher=G.K.

==Systems of social stratification==
{{Details|Systems of social stratification}}
Detailed anthropological and sociological studies have been made about customs of [[patrilineality|patrilineal]] inheritance, where only male children can inherit. Some cultures also employ [[matrilineal]] succession, where property can only pass along the female line, most commonly going to the sister's sons of the decedent; but also, in some societies, from the mother to her daughters. Some ancient societies and most modern states employ egalitarian inheritance, without discrimination based on gender and/or birth order.

==The evolution of inheritance practices in Europe==

The right of patrilineal primogeniture, though widespread during medieval and modern times in Europe, doesn't seem to have prevailed so extensively in ancient times. In Athens, according to Demosthenes and the Laws of Solon, the eldest son inherited the house and with it the cult to family ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Wild Beasts &amp; Idle Humours: The Insanity Defense from Antiquity to the Present | publisher=Harvard University Press | author=Robinson, Daniel N. | year=1996 | isbn=9780674952898}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle spoke about patrilineal primogeniture during his time in Thebes and Corinth. He also spoke about the revolts that put an end to it in Massalia, Istros, Heraclea and Cnido).&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; While Aristotle was opposed to this right, Plato wanted it to become more widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Labour Theory of Value | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | author=Dooley, Peter C. | year=2005 | isbn=9780203022221}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the nature of inheritance practices in [[Ancient Sparta]] is hotly debated among scholars. [[Ancient Greeks]] also considered the eldest son the avenger of wrongs done to parents—"The [[Erinyes]] are always at the command of the first-born".

[[Roman law]] didn't recognise primogeniture, but in practice Romans favored the eldest son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/29876/0000226.pdf&amp;embedded=true?sequence=1 | title=Roman monogamy | author=Betzig, Laura | journal=Ethology and Sociobiology | year=1992 | volume=13 | issue=5–6 | pages=351–83 | doi=10.1016/0162-3095(92)90009-S}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ancient Persia]], succession to the family headship was determined by patrilineal primogeniture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iranchamber.com/history/articles/ancient_persians_laws1.php | title=The Laws of the Ancient Persians | accessdate=11 June 2014 | author=Bulsara, S. J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Celtic and Germanic peoples, the predominant custom during ancient times seems to have been to divide the land in equal parts for each of the sons. However, the house could be left to only one of them. Evidence of actual practices and law codes such as the [[Sachsenspiegel]] indicate that Germans left the house to the youngest son. This was possibly connected to the cult to family ancestors, which was also inherited by the youngest son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Plants of Life, Plants of Death | publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press | author=Simoons, Frederick J. | year=1998 | pages=127 | isbn=9780299159047}}&lt;/ref&gt; Celts from Ireland and northern France left the house to the eldest son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.libraryireland.com/Brehon-Laws/Devolution-Property.php | title=The Brehon Laws | author=Ginnell, Laurence | year=1894 | chapter=Sub-Section 4.—Devolution of Property}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Germans and Irish divided the land into equal shares until the early Modern Age, when impartible inheritance gradually took hold among both peoples. However, according to Tacitus the German tribe of the [[Tencteri]] employed patrilineal primogeniture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0083%3Achapter%3D32 | title=Cornelius Tacitus, Germany and its Tribes |editor1=Church, Alfred John |editor2=Brodribb, William Jackson }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence that in [[Schleswig Holstein]], leaving the estate to the eldest son and giving only monetary compensation to his siblings was the prevailing practice since around the year 100. Patrilineal primogeniture also prevailed among the Vikings. In Scotland, certain types of property descended exclusively to the eldest son in the Scottish Lowlands even before the Norman conquest in 1066. Patrilineal primogeniture with regards to all types of immoveable property became the legal rule in all of Scotland during the reign of [[William the Lion|William I]] (1165–1214). Until 1868, all immovable property, also called in Scottish law "heritable property" (buildings, lands, etc.) was inherited exclusively by the eldest son and couldn't be included in a will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.afhs.ab.ca/aids/talks/ScotsLaw.pdf | title=Scots Law | accessdate=11 June 2014 | author=Sparling, Lois}}{{better source|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1868, it could be included in a will or testament, but if a person died [[intestate]], it was still inherited exclusively by the eldest son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk/content/help/index.aspx?407 | title=Wills &amp; Testaments | publisher=Scotlands People | accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, this rule of male primogeniture in cases of intestacy was finally abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1964/41/contents | title=Succession (Scotland) Act 1964 | publisher=Legislation | accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Bede]], the custom in Northumbria reserved a substantial birthright for the eldest son even before the Norman conquest and other local customs of inheritance also gave certain additional benefits to the eldest son. After the Norman conquest, male primogeniture became widespread throughout England, becoming the [[common law]] with the promulgation of the [[Magna Carta]] in 1215, only slightly later than in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.constitution.org/cmt/hale/history_common_law.htm | title=The History of the Common Law of England | publisher=Constitution.org | date=1713 | accessdate=11 June 2014 | author=Hale, Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1540, a [[testator]] could dispose of its immovable property as he saw fit with the use of a [[will and testament|testament]], but until 1925 it was still inherited solely by the eldest son if he died intestate.

The Scottish clan of the feudal era, which survived in the Highlands until 1747, was the only known example of a conical clan in Europe, along with the Roman [[gens]] according to [[Fustel de Coulanges]].&lt;ref&gt;The Ancient City A Study on the Religion, Laws, and Institutions of Greece and Rome Numa Denis Fustel De Coulanges http://www.efm.bris.ac.uk/het/fustel/AncientCity.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; As Gartmore says in a paper written in 1747, "The property of these Highlands belongs to a great many different persons, who are more or less considerable in proportion to the extent of their estates, and to the command of men that live upon them, or follow them on account of their clanship, out of the estates of others. These lands are set by the landlord during pleasure, or a short tack, to people whom they call good-men, and who are of a superior station to the commonality. These are generally the sons, brothers, cousins, or nearest relations of the landlord. The younger sons of families are not bred to any business or employments, but are sent to the French or Spanish armies, or marry as soon as they are of age. Those are left to their own good fortune and conduct abroad, and these are preferred to some advantageous farm at home. This, by the means of a small portion, and the liberality of their relations, they are able to stock, and which they, their children, and grandchildren, possess at an easy rent, till a nearer descendant be again preferred to it.
As the propinquity removes, they become less considered, till at last they degenerate to be of the common people; unless some accidental acquisition of wealth supports them above their station. As this hath been an ancient custom, most of the farmers and cottars are of the name and clan of the proprietor; and, if they are not really so, the proprietor either obliges them to assume it, or they are glaid to do so, to procure his protection and favour."

Prior to the advent of feudalism during Late Medieval times and the creation of the system above explained, no trace of male primogeniture or a similar custom existed in Scotland or elsewhere in the Celtic world. The successor to the office of the chief was selected among the wider kin of the previous chief ([[tanistry]]), and the land, among common families, was divided between all sons. Among many ancient Germanic tribes, on the other hand, male primogeniture determined succession to political office, the eldest son of a chief customarily succeeding his father. The common rule of land inheritance was partible inheritance, as in the Celtic world.

The British custom of male primogeniture became also prevalent in some British colonies, most strongly in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Farm Succession and Inheritance: Comparing Australian and International Trends https://rirdc.infoservices.com.au/downloads/07-066&lt;/ref&gt; The contrary development occurred in South Africa, where the [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner]] colonizers, who practiced partible inheritance,&lt;ref&gt;"Allowed such a state of freedom": Women and gender relations in the Afrikaner community before enfranchisement in 1930 Hermann Giliomee University of Stellenbosch http://www.seminarie-afrikaans.ugent.be/file/3&lt;/ref&gt; were always opposed to the custom of male primogeniture prevalent among indigenous black peoples.&lt;ref name="books.google.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="uir.unisa.ac.za"&gt;THE CUSTOMARY LAW OF INTESTATE SUCCESSION BY ISABEL MOODLE. http://uir.unisa.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10500/8829/thesis_moodley_i.pdf?sequence=1&lt;/ref&gt; In New Zealand, European colonizers chose any son to succeed to the family farm, without regards to his fraternal birth order,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/farm-families&lt;/ref&gt; while patrilineal primogeniture prevailed among the indigenous [[Māori people|Maori]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Bernard Willard|last1=Aginsky|author2=Te Rangi Hiroa (Peter H.

In parts of northern France, giving a slightly larger share to the eldest son was common among peasants even before the 10th century; after that century, patrilineal primogeniture developed among the nobility ([[impartible inheritance]] never obtained among peasants in most of northern France). Flanders was probably the first country where patrilineal primogeniture became predominant among aristocrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Dirk Heirbaut. ''Over lenen en families.

Scott and Christopher Storrs Universities of St Andrews and Dundee http://www.palgrave.com/PDFs/140393374X.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; but inheritance customs among peasants varied widely across regions.

Strabo also speaks about customs of male primogeniture among [[Iberians|Iberian]] peoples (most of the Iberian peninsula was populated by then by Celtic or half-Celtic peoples, not Iberians proper). He mentions that among the Cantabrii, however, the eldest child regardless of sex inherited the family property. By the term "Cantabrii" he was most probably referring not to the actual [[Cantabri]]ans but to the [[Basque people|Basques]] (who were not an Iberian people); among the Basques of France, this usage survived until the French Revolution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marriage strategies and well-being among nineteenth-century Basque Propertied families | first=Marie-Pierre | last=Arrizabalaga | year=2007 | url=http://www.ub.edu/tig/GWBNet/MinhoPapers/Marie%20Pierre%20Arrizabalaga.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; long after it had been replaced by male primogeniture or free selection of an heir among the Basques of Spain. In [[Catalonia]], in northeastern Spain, the custom of male primogeniture survived in an exceptionally vigorous form among peasants until very recent times (in northeastern Catalonia, for example, peasants rigorously respected the right of male primogeniture until very recent times.&lt;ref name="Los pirineos" /&gt; In the province of [[Lleida]], too, even as late as the mid-twentieth century, only 7.11 percent of the sons who became single-heirs were not the first son.&lt;ref name="Los pirineos"&gt;{{cite book | last=Piniella del Valle | first=María | chapter=La casa en Lérida: un sistema de sucesión y matrimonio | title=Los Pirineos: estudios de antropología social e historia | publisher=Casa de Velázquez| year=1986 | page=111 | isbn=9788474912012 | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ura6R3KcBN8C&amp;pg=PA111}}&lt;/ref&gt; In central&lt;ref&gt;Segundones y actividad económica en Cataluña (siglos XVIII-XIX).

===Welsh laws of inheritance===
The ancient Welsh laws of inheritance inform us about the evolution of inheritance practices in Great Britain. The [[Venedotian Code]] establishes that land must be partitioned between all sons and that the youngest has a preferential claim to the buildings:

"If there be buildings, the youngest brother but one is to divide the tyddyns,* for in that case he is the meter; and the youngest to have his choice of the tyddyns, and after that he is to divide all the patrimony. And by seniority they are to choose unto the youngest; and that division is to continue during the lives of the brothers."

"If there be no buildings on the land, the youngest son is to divide all the patrimony, and the eldest is to choose; and each, in seniority, choose unto the youngest."

"Land of a hamlet is not to be shared as tyddyns, but as gardens; and if there be buildings thereon, the youngest son is not more entitled to them than the eldest, but they are to be shared as chambers."

"When brothers share their patrimony between them, the younger is to have the principal tenement, and all the buildings, of his father, and eight einvs of land; his boiler, his hatchet, and his coulter, because a father cannot give these three to any one but the youngest son, and though they should be pledged they never become forfeited. Then let every brother take an homestead with eight erws of land; and the youngest son is to divide, and they are to choose in succession from the eldest to the youngest."

This was later replaced by a preference for the eldest son, and the [[Dimetian Code]] provides:{{quote|Whoever shall have dadenhudd adjudged to him, no one, by law, can eject him therefrom, except a proprietary heir to dadenhudd, according to age, that is, the eldest; since the second dadenhudd cannot eject the first; and one non-proprietor cannot eject another non-proprietor. If there be a dispute between two lawful heirs, one is proprietary heir to the dadenhudd of the whole, and another is non-proprietor; the one, however, is proprietor to dadenhudd of the whole, as dadenhudd of the whole is not appropriate to any one, but to the eldest of all the brothers. The privilege of age of the eldest brother renders all the younger brothers non-proprietors, and renders him sole proprietor for dadenhudd of all; if the younger ones come before him to obtain dadenhudd, at what time soever may come, he is to eject them all, and is to obtain dadenhudd of the whole: if they make the demand jointly, they are to obtain it jointly, as has been mentioned above. The eldest brother is likewise a primary son, and the youngest is secondary in claim; and therefore it is said: the second dadenhudd cannot eject the first. All the younger brothers are non-proprietors, as to obtaining dadenhudd of the whole, although every one shall obtain his share; and on that account it is said: no non-proprietor can eject another non-proprietor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Laws and Institutes of Wales |volume=1 |year=1841 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EzZnAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA541 |page=541|last1=Owen |first1=Aneurin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Canon law]]-dictated patrilineal primogeniture:{{quote|The ecclesiastical law says again that no son is to have the patrimony but the eldest born to the father by the married wife. The law of Howel, however, adjudges it to the younger son as well as to the oldest, and decides that the sin of the father, or his illegal act, is not to be brought against the son as to lus patrimony.}}

During the Modern Age, many Welsh peasants in upland areas lived in stem families where the eldest son took over the farm when his father became old.&lt;ref name="Elwyn Davies"&gt;Elwyn davies, "Hafod and Lluest: the summering of cattle and upland settlement in Wales"&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps most intriguingly, in the inner, lowland areas of Wales, where English culture was stronger and absolute nuclear families on the English model prevailed, male ultimogeniture predominated.&lt;ref name="www2.lse.ac.uk"&gt;Limitations on the role of British households as economic units, Richard Wall, Department of History, University of Essex http://www2.lse.ac.uk/socialPolicy/BSPS/pdfs/Wall_May08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===The fideicommissum===

Inheritance can be organized in a way that its use is restricted by the desires of someone (usually of the decedent).&lt;ref&gt;A ''decedent'' is a person who owned the property before this death. The term ''decedent'' should not be confused with the term ''descendant''.&lt;/ref&gt; An inheritance may have been organized as a [[fideicommissum]], which usually cannot be sold or diminished, only its profits are disposable. A fideicommissum's succession can also be ordered in a way that determines it long (or eternally) also with regard to persons born long after the original descendant. Royal succession has typically been more or less a fideicommissum, the realm not (easily) to be sold and the rules of succession not to be (easily) altered by a holder (a monarch). The fideicommissum, which in fact had little resemblance to the Roman institution of the same name, was almost the standard method of property transfer among the European nobility; Austria, Germany, Switzerland, [[Bohemia]], Sweden and Italy were some of the countries where it became very popular among wealthy landowners, beginning in most cases around the early Modern Age. It was almost always organized around principles of male primogeniture. The Spanish [[mayorazgo]] and the Portuguese morgado also resembled the Continental fideicommissum more than the noble customs of Great Britain and most French regions; noble customs of primogeniture in these countries were more ancient and thus took different legal forms. Inheritance of noble titles also distinguished Great Britain from Continental Europe, since in most European countries most noble titles (though not estates) were inherited by all sons, sometimes even all children.&lt;ref name=ScottStorrs/&gt;

'''[[Initial public offering#Pricing|IPO underpricing]]''' is the increase in stock value from the initial offering price to the first-day closing price. Many believe that underpriced IPOs leave money on the table for corporations, but some believe that underpricing is inevitable. Investors state that underpricing signals high interest to the market which increases the demand. On the other hand, overpriced stocks will drop long-term as the price stabilizes so underpricing may keep the issuers safe from investor litigation.

==IPO underpricing algorithms==
[[Underwriters]] and investors and corporations going for an [[initial public offering]] (IPO), issuers, are interested in their market value. There is always tension that results since the underwriters want to keep the price low while the companies want a high IPO price.

Underpricing may also be caused by investor over-reaction causing spikes on the initial days of trading. The IPO pricing process is similar to pricing new and unique products where there is sparse data on market demand, product acceptance, or competitive response. Besides, underpricing is also affected by the firm idiosyncratic factors such as its business model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morricone|first=Serena |author2=Federico Munari |author3=Raffaele Oriani |author4=Gaétan de Rassenfosse |title=Commercialization Strategy and IPO Underpricing|journal=Research Policy|year=2017|volume=46|issue=6|pages=1133–1141 | url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2017.04.006 |doi=10.1016/j.respol.2017.04.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it is difficult to determine a clear price which is compounded by the different goals issuers and investors have.

The problem with developing algorithms to determine underpricing is dealing with [[Statistical noise|noisy]], complex, and unordered data sets. Additionally, people, environment, and various environmental conditions introduce irregularities in the data.  To resolve these issues, researchers have found various techniques from [[artificial intelligence]] that [[normalization (statistics)|normalizes]] the data.

==Artificial neural network==
[[Artificial neural networks]] (ANNs) resolves these issues by scanning the data to develop internal representations of the relationship between the data. By determining the relationship over time, ANNs are more responsive and adaptive to structural changes in the data. There are two models for ANNs: supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

In [[supervised learning]] models, there are tests that are needed to pass to reduce mistakes. Usually, when mistakes are encountered i.e. test output does not match test input, the algorithms use [[back propagation]] to fix mistakes. Whereas in [[unsupervised learning]] models, the input is classified based on which problems need to be resolved.

==Evolutionary models==
[[Evolutionary programming]] is often paired with other algorithms e.g. [[artificial neural network|ANN]] to improve the robustness, reliability, and adaptability. Evolutionary models reduce error rates by allowing the numerical values to change within the fixed structure of the program.  Designers provide their algorithms the variables, they then provide training data to help the program generate rules defined in the input space that make a prediction in the output variable space.

In this approach, the solution is made an individual and the population is made of alternatives. However, the outliers cause the individuals to act unexpectedly as they try to create rules to explain the whole set.

===Rule-based system===
For example, Quintana&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Quintana|first=David |author2=Cristóbal Luque |author3=Pedro Isasi|title=Evolutionary rule-based system for IPO underpricing prediction|journal=In&amp;nbsp;Proceedings of the 2005 conference on Genetic and evolutionary computation&amp;nbsp;(GECCO '05)|year=2005|pages=983–989}}&lt;/ref&gt; first abstracts a model with 7 major variables. The rules evolved from the Evolutionary Computation system developed at Michigan and Pittsburgh: 
* Underwriter prestige – Is the underwriter prestigious in role of lead manager? 1 for  true, 0 otherwise.
* Price range width – The width of the non-binding reference price range offered to  potential customers during the roadshow. This width can be interpreted as a sign of  uncertainty regarding the real value of the company and a therefore, as a factor that  could influence the initial return.
* Price adjustment – The difference between the final offer price and the price range  width. It can be viewed as uncertainty if the adjustment is outside the previous  price range.
* Offering price – The final offer price of the IPO
* Retained stock – Ratio of number of shares sold at the IPO divided by post-offering  number of shares minus the number of shares sold at the IPO.
* Offering size – Logarithm of the offering size in millions of dollars excluding the  over-allotment option
* Technology – Is this a technology company? 1 for true, 0 otherwise.

Quintana uses these factors as signals that investors focus on. The algorithm his team explains shows how a prediction with a high-degree of confidence is possible with just a subset of the data.

===Two-layered evolutionary forecasting===
Luque&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Luque|first=Cristóbal|author2=David Quintana |author3=J. M. Valls |author4=Pedro Isasi |title=Two-layered evolutionary forecasting for IPO underpricing|journal=In&amp;nbsp;Proceedings of the Eleventh conference on Congress on Evolutionary Computation&amp;nbsp;(CEC'09)|year=2009|pages=2374–2378|publisher=IEEE Press|location=Piscatawy, NJ, USA|doi=10.1109/cec.2009.4983237|isbn=978-1-4244-2958-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  approaches the problem with outliers by performing linear regressions over the set of data points (input, output). The algorithm deals with the data by allocating regions for noisy data. The scheme has the advantage of isolating noisy patterns which reduces the effect outliers have on the rule-generation system. The algorithm can come back later to understand if the isolated data sets influence the general data. Finally, the worst results from the algorithm outperformed all other algorithms' predictive abilities.

==Agent-based modelling==
Currently, many of the algorithms assume homogeneous and rational behavior among investors. However, there's an approach alternative to financial modeling, and it's called [[agent-based model]]ling (ABM). ABM uses different autonomous agents whose behavior evolves endogenously which lead to complicated system dynamics that are sometimes impossible to predict from the properties of individual agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brabazon |first=Anthony |author2=Jiang Dang |author3=Ian Dempsy |author4=Michael O'Neill |author5=David M. Edelman  |title=Natural Computing in finance: a review |journal=Handbook of Natural Computing |year=2010 |url=http://irserver.ucd.ie/dspace/bitstream/10197/2737/1/NCinFinance_v8.pdf }} {{dead link |date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ABM is starting to be applied to computational finance. Though, for ABM to be more accurate, better models for rule-generation need to be developed.

'''''I-19''''' was a Japanese [[Type B1 submarine|Type B1]] [[submarine]] which damaged and destroyed several enemy ships during [[World War II]] while serving in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. During the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]], with a single torpedo salvo, the submarine sank the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Wasp|CV-7|6}} and the [[destroyer]] {{USS|O'Brien|DD-415|6}}, and damaged the [[battleship]] {{USS|North Carolina|BB-55|6}}.

==Service history==

===Operation ''K-1''===
On February 23, 1942, ''I-19''{{'}}s [[Yokosuka E14Y]] (Glen) [[floatplane]] made a night reconnaissance over [[Pearl Harbor]], [[Hawaii]] in preparation for [[Operation K|Operation ''K-1'']], the second attack on Pearl Harbor by the Imperial Japanese Navy. On March 4, she arrived at the [[French Frigate Shoals]] to serve as a radio beacon for the [[Kawanishi H8K]] (Emily) flying boats that were to attack Pearl Harbor but did not otherwise participate in the attack, which was carried out effectually by two of the planned five H8Ks.

===Sinking of USS ''Wasp'' and USS ''O'Brien''===
On September 15, 1942, while patrolling south of the [[Solomon Islands]] during the Guadalcanal Campaign under the command of Commander Narahara Shogo,&lt;ref&gt;Rohwer/Hümmelchen: ''"Chronik des Seekrieges 1939-1945"'', Hamburg 1968, {{ISBN|3-88199-0097}}, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; ''I-19'' sighted and attacked the U.S. carrier {{USS|Wasp|CV-7|2}}, firing six torpedoes. Three of the torpedoes hit the ''Wasp'', causing heavy damage. With power knocked out due to damage from the torpedo explosions, ''Wasp’s'' [[Damage control|damage-control]] teams were unable to contain the ensuing fires. She was abandoned and [[scuttling|scuttled]]. 
[[File:USS O'Brien (DD-415) being torpedoed on 15 September 1942 (80-G-457818).jpg|thumb|left|{{USS|O'Brien|DD-415|2}} hit by torpedo as {{USS|Wasp|CV-7|6}} burns. Both ships were torpedoed and sunk by ''I-19''.]]

The remaining three torpedoes from the same spread (torpedo salvo), often incorrectly attributed to a second Japanese submarine, hit the U.S. battleship {{USS|North Carolina|BB-55|2}} and the destroyer {{USS|O'Brien|DD-415|2}}, the latter of which later sank ''en route'' for repairs on October 19, 1942. Significant damage had been sustained by ''North Carolina'', which underwent repairs at Pearl Harbor until November 16, 1942.

This single torpedo salvo thus sank an aircraft carrier and a destroyer, and severely damaged a battleship, making it one of the most damaging torpedo salvos in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.combinedfleet.com/type_b1.htm |title=type b1 |publisher=Combinedfleet.com |accessdate=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further2|[[USS Wasp (CV-7)#Loss|Sinking of USS Wasp]] and [[USS O'Brien (DD-415)#Sinking|Sinking of the USS O'Brien]]}}

==="Tokyo Express"===
From November, 1942, until February, 1943, ''I-19'' assisted with the nocturnal supply and reinforcement deliveries, and later, evacuations for Japanese forces on [[Guadalcanal]]. These missions were labeled the "[[Tokyo Express]]" by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces.

===Fiji===
Between April and September, 1943, ''I-19'' was stationed off [[Fiji]]. During this time, the submarine sank two Allied cargo ships and heavily damaged one. After sinking one of the ships— [[William Kissam Vanderbilt|SS ''William K. Vanderbilt'']]— on May 16, 1943, ''I-19'' surfaced and machine-gunned the surviving crew members in their lifeboats, killing one of them.

===Loss===
On November 25, 1943, at 20:49, {{convert|50|nmi|km|0}} west of [[Butaritari|Makin Island]], destroyer {{USS|Radford|DD-446|6}} detected ''I-19'' on the surface with radar. After ''I-19'' submerged, ''Radford'' attacked her with depth charges. ''I-19'' was lost with all hands in this attack.

==''I-19'' in fiction==
''I-19'' was the number of the submarine commanded by [[Toshiro Mifune]] in the [[Steven Spielberg]] movie [[1941 (movie)|''1941'']].&lt;ref name="Making of 1941"&gt;''The Making of 1941'', Universal home video DVD&lt;/ref&gt;

'''King Wuling of Zhao''' (Traditional Chinese: 趙武靈王, Simplified Chinese: 赵武灵王) (died 295 BCE, reigned 325 BCE – 299 BCE) reigned in the [[State of Zhao]] during the [[Warring States period]] of Chinese history. His reign was famous for one important event: the reforms consisting of "Wearing the [[Wuhu|Hu]] (styled) Attire and Shooting from Horseback (in battle)" (Simplified Chinese: 胡服骑射, Traditional Chinese: 胡服騎射) He was credited for the implementation of protective outfit during military events and proceedings.

Probably the son of Zhao Suhou ([[Marquess Su of Zhao]], Simplified Chinese: 赵肃侯), King Wuling of Zhao ascended to the throne at 325 BCE, about halfway into the Warring States Period. His reign coincided with the appearance of several other notable figures in the Warring States. He was also the first ruler of Zhao to style himself "king" (王), but later reversed the decision. He would later receive the title as part of his [[posthumous name]].

==Rule and reforms==
[[File:Statue of King Zhao Wuling in Congtai Park.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Statue of King Zhao Wuling in Congtai Park]]
During the early years of his reign, the Kingdom of Zhao was constantly harassed by the [[Donghu people|Donghu]], the Linhu (Simplified and Traditional Chinese: 林胡), the Loufan (Simplified Chinese: 楼烦) and the [[Beidi]], all nomadic animal husbandry tribes. This might have been the inspiration for his later reforms. On another level, Wuling himself had been humbled after a great defeat by Qin. Previously, during 325-323 BC, he, along with the rulers of [[Han (state)|Han]], [[Wei (state)|Wei]], [[Yan (state)|Yan]] and [[Zhongshan (state)|Zhongshan]], had declared himself king. However, in 318 BC, Zhao suffered a great defeat in the hands of Qin, causing Wuling to muse that since he did not have the power of a king, he should not use the title.  

In 307 BCE, Wuling started his reforms. Mostly military, they concentrated on making the military more suited to fighting battles. Up to that time, Zhao commanders riding on horseback still wore robes and normal court attire. Wuling ordered all commanders, including the whole court and military, to adopt the Hu style of dress: pants, belt, boots, fur caps and fur clothes. He created a cavalry division in the army and trained them not only in the ways of a cavalry charge, but also in horse archery.

While many reformists and officials supported the reforms, seeing it as a way to greatness and power, conservative members of the royal family such as Zhao Wuling's uncle Lord Cheng (Simplified and Traditional Chinese: 公子成) disliked it, claiming that there should not be any "Copying of barbaric clothing and changing of old rules" (Simplified Chinese: 不该 "袭远方之服, 变古之教"). Lord Cheng even went so far as to be absent from court.

Wuling did much to check the opposition. He said, "There is not only one way to rule the world, nor is there any need to copy the old to benefit the country" (Simplified Chinese: "理世不必一道, 便国不必法古") and "Those who use the old to define the new do not achieve change" (Simplified Chinese: "以古制今者, 不达于事之变"). He wore the "barbaric" clothes on court and persuaded others to do the same. He even visited Lord Cheng and gave him a suit of the Hu people's clothing. Finally, Lord Cheng relented, and the controversy stopped.

Wuling's reforms greatly improved the fighting capability of the Zhao military. The same year, the Zhao attacked the Hu people's state of [[Zhongshan (state)|Zhongshan]] and took several cities. In 306 BCE the Zhao military launched expeditions into Wuhu territories in the north. The northern expedition was highly successful: the kings of the Loufan and Linhu surrendered and their territories became administered by a governor of [[Dai County#History|Dai]]. In the next year, parts of [[Zhongshan (state)|Zhongshan]] were annexed.&lt;ref&gt;Yap, Joseph P. 'Wars with the Xiongnu: A Translation of the [[Zizhi Tongjian]]',2009, page 13&lt;/ref&gt; In 304 BCE the upper reaches of the [[Yellow River]] were invaded and taken from the [[Wuhu|Hu]] tribes like the [[Hezong]] (Simplified and Traditional Chinese: 河宗氏) and the [[Xiu]] (Simplified and Traditional Chinese: 休). In the conquered areas King Wuling created two prefectures in 302 BCE - [[Yunzhong]] (Simplified Chinese: 云中) and [[Jiuyuan]]. In a little over five years Zhao Wuling had expanded his country to the border with the [[Yan (state)|Yan]], the upper reaches of the Yellow River and into the north, and had forced two tribal leaders, the [[Loufan (tribe)|Loufan]] and [[Linhu (people)|Linhu]] kings, to surrender. King Wuling took control of their armies and added them to his military, creating extra divisions made up entirely of indigenous and hardy nomadic warriors.

==Abdication and death==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
In 299 BCE, Zhao Wuling, perhaps tired out from all he had done and wishing to become more involved with military instead of political affairs, [[Abdication|abdicated]] and gave the throne of Zhao to his younger son, Zhao He (Simplified Chinese: 赵何) who was to become [[King Huiwen of Zhao]] (Simplified Chinese: 赵惠文王). He called himself the "Lord Father" (Simplified and Traditional Chinese: 主父), using his new title to visit neighbouring countries, especially the [[Qin (state)|Qin]], which he visited secretly. He lived long enough to see the annexation of the Zhongshan by the Zhao in 296 BCE.

In 295 BCE, Wuling's older son Zhao Zhang (Simplified Chinese: 赵章) rebelled against King Huiwen and lost. He escaped to the palace in Shaqiu (Simplified and Traditional Chinese: 沙丘), where Zhao Wuling took pity on him and kept him in his palace.

Prime Minister Lord Anping (Simplified and Traditional Chinese: 安平君), who was Lord Cheng, the uncle of Wuling, and his subordinate Lord Fengyang (Simplified Chinese: 奉阳君), also known as Li Yu (Simplified and Traditional Chinese: 李兌) laid siege to the palace, allowing no food or water to be provided to the inhabitants inside. In desperation, King Wuling ordered Zhang to be killed, but still the besiegers did not retreat. Thus, after 100 days, King Wuling starved to death. When the siege was finally lifted, King Wuling's body was already rotting and full of worms, a pitiful ending for such a king.

Second Lieutenant Kázím Abdulakim was the brother of lawyer [[Selim Abdulakim]] who, between the two wars, became a leading politician of the [[Crimean Tatars in Romania]], [[Deputy Mayor]] of [[Constanța]] and a Member of the [[Romanian Parliament]].{{sfn|Agi-Amet|1999}} Kázím’s sister Şefika, also known as Sapiye, was the wife of the beloved Crimean Tatar poet [[Mehmet Niyazi|Memet Niyaziy]].{{sfn|Agi-Amet|1999}}{{sfn|Romania Libera|2007}}

As recognition of his extreme devotion to duty and his ultimate sacrifice, in [[Dobruja]] was founded ''Second Lieutenant Kázím Abdulakim Cultural and Sports Association''{{sfn|Scurtu|2013|p:214}} and a street in downtown Constanța{{sfn|Strazi}}{{sfn|Google Maps}} was named in Kázím’s honor.

'''Margaret of Scotland''' ([[old Norse language|Old Norse]]: ''Margrét Alexandersdóttir''; [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''Margrete Alexandersdotter''; [[Scottish Gaelic]]: ''Maighread Nic Rìgh Alasdair''; 28 February 1261 – 9 April 1283) was [[Queen consort of Norway|Queen of Norway]] as the wife of [[Eric II of Norway|King Eric II]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Margrete_Aleksandersdotter/utdypning ''Margrete Aleksandersdotter – utdypning'' (Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
She was born at [[Windsor Castle]], the daughter of King [[Alexander III of Scotland]] and his first wife, [[Margaret of England]].  Margaret came to Norway at 20 years of age to marry the 13-year-old king [[Eric II Magnusson|Eric Magnusson]].  Eric became king of Norway on 9 May 1280. A marriage contract was signed in [[royal burgh]] of [[Roxburgh]] on 25 July 1281.  The treaty also included a provision for the children of Margaret and Eric to succeed to throne of the kingdom of the Scots. Margaret's dowry was set at 14,000 marks sterling. The year after the wedding was held in Bergen, Norway when Margaret was also crowned queen.

The marriage between Margaret and Eric stands out as a typical marriage of political note. It would reconcile and resolve the Scottish-Norwegian antagonisms that had developed since 1266 resulting from the terms of the [[Treaty of Perth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/manxsoc/msvol04/v3p210.htm ''Agreement between Magnus IV and Alexander III, 1266'']&lt;/ref&gt; Under the treaty, Norway had given up the [[Hebrides]] and the [[Isle of Man]] to [[Scotland]], in return for a lump sum of 4000 marks and an annuity of 100 marks. Scotland also confirmed Norwegian sovereignty over [[Shetland]] and [[Orkney Islands]].

Queen Margaret died in [[Tønsberg]], during or shortly after giving birth to [[Margaret, Maid of Norway]], who would become  [[queen regnant]] of the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] upon the death of her grandfather, King Alexander III  on 19  March 1286.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Margrete_Eiriksdotter/utdypning ''Margrete Eiriksdotter – utdypning'' (Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Queen Margaret was buried in the [[Christ Church, Bergen|Old Cathedral on Holmen]] in Bergen. This cathedral was demolished in 1531. The site, in present-day [[Bergenhus Fortress]], is marked by a memorial.

The primary Scottish accounts of the life of Margaret are found in the ''[[Chronicle of Lanercost]]''  and  the ''[[Chronica Gentis Scotorum]]'' by [[John of Fordun]]. The date of the death of Queen Margaret is given as 9 April 1283 in the ''Chronica Gentis Scotorum'', but the ''Chronicle of Lanercost'' states her death to have been 27/28 February 1283.

'''Monocarpic''' plants are those that [[flower]], set [[seeds]] and then die. The term was first used by [[Alphonse Pyrame de Candolle|Alphonse de Candolle]]. Other terms with the same meaning are ''[[hapaxanth]]'' and ''[[Semelparity and iteroparity#Semelparity|semelparous]]''. The antonym is [[polycarpic]], a plant that flowers and sets seeds many times during its lifetime; the antonym of semelparous is ''[[Semelparity and iteroparity#Iteroparity|iteroparous]]''. Plants which flower en masse (gregariously) before dying are known as [[plietesials]].

The plant can live a number of years before it will flower. Flowering does not by itself result in the death of the plants but the production of [[fruits]] and [[seeds]] causes changes within the plants which lead to death. These changes are induced by chemicals that act as [[hormones]], redirecting the resources of the plants from the roots and leaves to the production of fruits and or seeds.

The [[century plant]] in the genus ''[[Agave]]'', some terrestrial [[bromeliad]]s of the genus ''[[Puya (genus)|Puya]]'', ''[[Tillandsia]] utriculata'', some [[yucca]]s, and many [[bamboo]]s can take 8 to 20 years or in the case of some bamboos even over 100 years to bloom and then die. Hawaiian [[Argyroxiphium|silverswords]] and their relatives in the genus ''[[Wilkesia]]'' may take 10–50 years before flowering.

[[Monocot]] plant [[family (biology)|families]] that include monocarpic species include [[Agavaceae]], [[Araceae]], [[Arecaceae]], [[Bromeliaceae]], [[Musaceae]], and [[Poaceae]]. [[Dicot]] plant families that include monocarpic species include [[Acanthaceae]], [[Apocynaceae]], [[Asteraceae]], and [[Fabaceae]]. Few dicot shrubs with multiple branching and secondary growth species have been described. Those that have include ''[[Strobilanthes]]'' species, ''Cerberiopsis candelabrum'', ''[[Tachigali versicolor]]'' and other ''[[Tachigali]]'' species.&lt;ref name=kita&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/1941379|last=Kitajima|first=Kaoru |author2=Carol K. Augspurger|date=August 1989|title=Seed and Seedling Ecology of a Monocarpic Tropical Tree, Tachigalia Versicolor|journal=Ecology|location=jstor|volume=70|issue=4|pages=1102–1114|jstor=1941379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often monocarpic plants can be kept alive after flowering if the flowers are removed as soon as they have finished blooming, before seed formation begins, or if the flower buds are removed before they begin blooming.

'''Bobby Kent''' (May 12, 1973 – July 14, 1993) was an American man who was [[murder]]ed by seven people, including his best friend, Martin Joseph "Marty" Puccio, Jr. (born March 21, 1973) in [[Weston, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hernandez|first=Christina|title=Woman Convicted in Broward Murder Talks|url=http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/Woman-Convicted-in-Broward-Murder-Talks.html|publisher=NBC6.com|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events prior to murder==
Bobby Kent, the son of [[Iran]]ian immigrants Fred and Farah Kent (née "Khayam"),&lt;ref&gt;Schutze, {{ISBN|0380723336}}, 9780380723331, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=l62_cgG-aq4C&amp;pg=PA31 31]. "Fred and Farah Kent (originally Khayam) had come to America and Florida in search of freedom and economic opportunity. Educated people, they did well quickly. Fred put himself through the rigorous training and licensing procedure [...]"&lt;/ref&gt; attended [[South Broward High School]] in [[Hollywood, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;Schutze, {{ISBN|0-688-13517-X}}, p. 36. "Bobby Kent was something of a figure in the hallways of South Broward High School."&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tim Donnelly, who prosecuted all the [[conspiracy (crime)|conspirators]] for this murder, one attorney described Kent as "very [[Eddie Haskell]]-like. Adults saw him one way (polite and charming) while the kids saw him in a completely different way."&lt;ref&gt;From: "Payback For A Bully." ''[[American Justice]]''. December 9, 1999. The quote occurs around 19:01.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marty Puccio is an Italian-American, and was raised Roman Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;Schutze, {{ISBN|0-688-13517-X}}, p. 24. "She had determined [...] that he came from a good Italian Catholic family."&lt;/ref&gt; Kent and Puccio had known each other since third grade, had lived on the same block in Hollywood in Broward County since that time, and were good friends as adults. Bad blood, however, existed between the two. Puccio felt "ill-will and hatred" towards Kent because he would [[bullying|bully]] and pummel Puccio.&lt;ref name=Supcourt&gt;"[https://law.justia.com/cases/florida/supreme-court/1997/86242-0.html Martin PUCCIO, Appellant, v. STATE of Florida, Appellee.]" [[Supreme Court of Florida]]. November 20, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Both sets of parents were wary of the friendship, as well. Puccio's parents, Martin Sr. and Veronica, were cautious because Marty often returned from being with Kent with bruises or bleeding. Fred Kent thought of Puccio as a wayward slacker who had no future (Puccio was a high school dropout) and felt the friendship with his son would destroy the future he was helping him build. Frequent gym goers, both boys were rumored to use [[steroid]]s, which in Kent's case, according to testimonial accounts, significantly contributed to his erratic, aggressive behavior.

Kent and Puccio had experimented with making [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] [[pornography|porn]] movies, hoping to distribute them to local shops. Neither Kent nor Puccio actually participated in these movies, but, rather, allegedly [[Film director|directed]] them and coaxed a [[Florida]] man in his 40s to perform on camera. Kent tried to peddle a movie, titled ''Rough Boys'', to porn shops across [[South Florida]]. None took him up on the offer, due to the poor audio and video quality as well as the lack of any sexual activities in the film beyond the man dancing nude and playing with a [[dildo]].&lt;ref&gt;Schutze, Jim. ''Bully''. ''[[HarperCollinsPublishers]]''. 1997. pp. 52–58, 61–62, 77, 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder==
Toward the beginning of 1993, Puccio (aged 20) began dating Lisa Connelly (aged 18). Frustrated by how much time her boyfriend spent with Kent (aged 20), Connelly tried to distract Kent from Puccio by setting up her friend Alice (Ali) Willis (aged 17) with Kent.&lt;ref&gt;Schutze, {{ISBN|0380723336}}, p. 72-74.&lt;/ref&gt; Kent and Ali dated for a few weeks but Kent was abusive toward Ali and she cut off the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Schutze, {{ISBN|0380723336}}, p. 75-76.&lt;/ref&gt; In June, Puccio confided to Connelly that Kent had been abusive to him quite often over the years. Connelly tried to convince him to cut off his friendship, but Puccio seemed hesitant. By this time, Connelly knew she was pregnant by Puccio and was determined to pursue a permanent relationship with him.&lt;ref&gt;Schutze, {{ISBN|0380723336}}, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegedly, Connelly decided that Kent needed to be eliminated permanently, and began talking to Puccio and other friends about murdering him.&lt;ref&gt;Schutze, {{ISBN|0380723336}}, events detailed in chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; On July 13, 1993, Connelly called Willis and told her that "Bobby Kent was planning to come to [[Palm Bay, Florida|Palm Bay]] [where Willis was living] to murder her and smother her baby [by a previous relationship], unless she returned to Broward County to date him again."&lt;ref&gt;Puccio v. State of Florida, "[http://fall.fsulawrc.com/flsupct/86242/86242rep.pdf Reply Brief of Appellant]". (Fla. 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Willis claimed Connelly asked her to come to Connelly's house to discuss murdering Bobby Kent. Willis went to Connelly's house and brought two friends, her current boyfriend, Donald Semenec (aged 17), and Heather Swallers (aged 18).&lt;ref&gt;Schutze, {{ISBN|0380723336}}, p. 98-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of July 13, 1993, Puccio, Semenec, Swallers, Connelly and Willis met with Kent. Puccio, Semenec, and Swallers became uncomfortable and left. Connelly and Willis lured Kent to a new development under construction with the promise that he would be able to drive Willis's [[Ford Mustang (third generation)|Mustang 5.0]] and have sex with her.&lt;ref&gt;Schutze, {{ISBN|0380723336}}, p. 106-107.&lt;/ref&gt; Connelly had brought along her mother's pistol, intending to kill Kent while he was distracted by sexual activity with Willis. Ultimately, she was unable to go through with shooting him.&lt;ref&gt;Schutze, {{ISBN|0380723336}}, p. 108-110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the failed attempt, Connelly still wanted Kent dead. Seeking assistance, she contacted a self-proclaimed "hit man" named Derek Kaufman (aged 20), who had been recommended by a friend of Willis's. The group met Kaufman at his home in [[Rolling Oaks, Florida|Rolling Oaks]].&lt;ref&gt;Schutze, {{ISBN|0380723336}}, p. 111-113.&lt;/ref&gt; They wanted him to get a gun so they could kill Kent that night, but Kaufman told them he couldn't procure a weapon that quickly. Willis, Connelly, Semenec and Swallers then went back to Connelly's house and were joined by her cousin, Derek Dzvirko (aged 19).&lt;ref&gt;Schutze, {{ISBN|0380723336}}, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; The group continued to discuss their plans, and ultimately decided to go ahead with murdering Kent the next night, with Kaufman's assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Schutze, {{ISBN|0380723336}}, p. 136-145.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Puccio alleged he was not a part of these meetings on July 13. [No source available] --&gt;

Late on the night of July 14, 1993, the seven joined together at Puccio's house and finalized their plans.

The '''northern brook lamprey''' (''Ichthyomyzon fossor'') is freshwater fish in the family [[Petromyzontidae]].

==Description==
Northern brook lampreys are jawless fishes, also known as [[cyclostomes]]. Northern brook lamprey are considered non-parasitic lamprey.&lt;ref name="NAT" /&gt; They have poorly developed teeth and a round, disc-like, subterminal mouth, called an oral-disc, for suction. Northern brook lampreys have a single [[dorsal fin]] that continues along their entire length until it connects with the [[caudal fin]].&lt;ref name="MN DNR"&gt;http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/rsg/profile.html?action=elementDetail&amp;selectedElement=AFBAA01030#&lt;/ref&gt; This dorsal fin can be notched as well. Their coloration is gray-brown dorsally with a light line down the back and an even lighter ventral side. The length of adult northern brook lampreys does not typically exceed 16&amp;nbsp;cm and the body is attenuate. While the ammocoetes look similar to the adult lampreys the ammocoetes have a hooded mouth instead of an oral-disc and no eyes.&lt;ref name="ADW" /&gt;

==Geographic range==
Northern brook lampreys can be found in most of the Midwest and northeast regions of the [[United States]]. They inhabit the [[Mississippi]] drainage basin in [[Wisconsin]] and the [[Lake Erie]] tributary in [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name="ADW"&gt;http://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Ichthyomyzon_fossor/&lt;/ref&gt; They can be found in parts of Canada as well.

==Habitat==
The northern brook lampreys are found in various habitats throughout their lives. [[Ammocoetes]] start off their lives burrowed beneath fine sediment or organic matter in quiet waters while the adults live in sand or gravel in swift moving waters.&lt;ref name="MN DNR" /&gt; They are typically found in the headwaters of streams that are moderately warm and clean.&lt;ref name="NAT"&gt;http://www.naturalheritage.state.pa.us/factsheets/11247.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diet==
As larve (ammocoetes), the northern brook lamprey are [[filter feeders]]; feeding primarily on detritus, zooplankton, [[algae]], diatoms, [[bacteria]], [[pollen]] and a host of other microorganisms  as they remain burrowed in fine substrate in calm waters.&lt;ref name="ADW" /&gt; The juveniles and adults have non-functional intestines and do not feed; juveniles drift for 4–6 months and the adults spawn and die shortly after spawning.

==Reproduction and life cycle==
Spawning occurs around boulders and crevices of large rocks; 3-7 northern brook lamprey will build a nest together and then spawn in groups of 10-30.&lt;ref name="ADW" /&gt; Once the eggs are fertilized they are often covered and left alone with no parental care given to the young, as the lamprey die soon after. Northern brook lampreys begin spawning at 6 years of age once they have reached sexual maturity. Spawning is triggered by the warming of the water in the spring. Males begin building nests and females lay thousands of eggs to combat high mortality rates of young.&lt;ref name="ADW" /&gt;
Once the ammocoetes emerge from the eggs 2 weeks after fertilization, they spend the next 5–6 years feeding on algae and bacteria in burrows. They emerge in the fall as non-feeding juveniles after a 2-3 month [[metamorphosis]] and drift for 4–6 months until spawning begins. They then become sexually mature adults, partake in spawning and then die shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="ADW" /&gt;

==Conservation==
Northern brook lamprey populations are decreasing in the great lakes area and the great lakes drainage basin from lampricides, habitat degradation, and added stressors. A study of [[Pennsylvania]] streams found that two of the six species of lampreys normally found breeding in the streams were not there.&lt;ref name="Pennsylvania"&gt;Shan, Li, Karl-M. Werner, and Jr., Jay R. Stauffer. "An Examination Of Petromyzontidae In Pennsylvania: Current Distribution And Habitat Preference Of Lampreys." Northeastern Naturalist 21.4 (2014): 606-618. EBSCO MegaFILE. Web. 21 Apr. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the species not found was the northern brook lamprey. It is speculated that the main reason for population decline is due to the presence of sea lamprey and the lampricides used to be rid of them.&lt;ref name="Pennsylvania" /&gt; In Minnesota, northern brook lampreys are considered a special concern species as they are believed to be declining due to lampricide use and habitat degradation.&lt;ref name="MN DNR" /&gt; The lampricide treatments are used in response to the invasive species, sea lampreys, that are currently plaguing the great lake region. The increasing populations of sea lampreys and the increasing use of lampricides in response to sea lampreys has had negative impacts on most populations of lampreys, including the northern brook lamprey.

The '''''Polish Operation''''' of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[NKVD|security service]] in 1937–1938 was a [[Mass operations of the NKVD|mass operation of the NKVD]] carried out in the [[Soviet Union]] against [[Poles]] (labeled by the Soviets as "agents") during the period of the [[Great Purge]]. It was ordered by the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] against the so-called "Polish spies" and customarily interpreted by the [[NKVD]] officials as relating to 'absolutely all Poles'.

==Order № 00485==
{{main article|Order № 00485}}
The top secret [[NKVD Order No. 00485]], titled "''On the liquidation of the Polish diversionist and espionage groups and POW units''," was approved on August 9, 1937 by [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|the Party's]] [[Central Committee]] [[Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee|Politburo]], and was signed by [[Nikolai Yezhov]] on August 11, 1937.&lt;ref name="Russian1" /&gt; It was distributed to the local subdivisions of the NKVD simultaneously with Yezhov's thirty-page "secret letter," explaining what the "Polish operation" was all about. The letter from Yezhov was titled, "''On fascist-resurrectionist, spying, diversional, defeationist, and terrorist activity of Polish intelligence in the USSR''".&lt;ref name="Russian2"&gt;Original document.

The "Order" adopted the simplified so-called "[[album procedure]]" (as it was called in NKVD circles). The long lists of Poles condemned by a lower NKVD organ (so-called ''dvoika'', a two-man team) during early meetings,{{r|Sanford2007}} were then collected into "albums" and sent to the midrange NKVD offices for a stamp of approval by a ''troika'' (a three-man team; a communist official, NKVD leader, and party procurator). Poles were the first ever major Soviet population group to be sentenced in this manner.&lt;ref name="Sanford2007"&gt;{{cite book |title=Katyn and the Soviet Massacre of 1940: Truth, Justice and Memory |author=[[George Sanford (political scientist)|George Sanford]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tV2AAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT33 |publisher=Routledge |date=2007 |ISBN=1134302991 |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the approval of the entire "album", the executions were carried out immediately. This procedure was also used later on in other [[mass operations of the NKVD]].&lt;ref name="Werth2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tyrollins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SEMELIN-MASS-VIOLENCE-IN-USSR-NATION-FRON-OPERATIONS-OF-THE-NKVD-1937-TO-1938.pdf |title=The NKVD Mass Secret National Operations (August 1937 - November 1938) |publisher=MassViolence.org |work=Online Encyclopedia of Mass Violence |date=20 May 2010 |via=Internet Archive |author=Nicolas Werth |pages=4 of 10 |format=PDF |ISSN=1961-9898 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220170831/http://www.tyrollins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SEMELIN-MASS-VIOLENCE-IN-USSR-NATION-FRON-OPERATIONS-OF-THE-NKVD-1937-TO-1938.pdf |archivedate=20 February 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Polish Operation" was a second in a series of [[Mass operations of the NKVD|national operations of the NKVD]], carried out by the Soviet Union against ethnic groups including Latvian, Finnish, German and Romanian, based on a theory about an internal enemy (i.e. the [[fifth column]]) labelled as the "hostile capitalist surrounding" residing along its western borders.&lt;ref name="arlindo-correia-2" /&gt; In opinion of historian [[Timothy Snyder]], this fabricated justification was intended only to cover-up the state-sanctioned campaign of mass-murder aiming to eradicate Poles as a national (and linguistic) minority group.&lt;ref name="arlindo-correia-2" /&gt; Another possible cause according to Snyder might have sprung from the necessity to explain the [[Holodomor|Soviet-made famine in Ukraine]] which required a political scapegoat. A top Soviet official [[Vsevolod Balitsky]] chose the [[Polish Military Organization]] which was disbanded in 1921. The NKVD declared that it continued to exist. Some Soviet Poles were tortured in order to confess to its existence, and denounce other individuals as spies. Meanwhile, the Communist International helped by revisiting its files in search of Polish members, producing another bountiful source of made-up evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Snyder (2005), ''[https://books.google.ca/books?id=LkZlidUKEl8C&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=elections%20Poland%201930&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q=sabotaging+collectivization&amp;f=false  Sketches from a Secret War]'' Yale University Press, p. 129. {{ISBN|030010670X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scale of the Polish Operation and its victims==
The operation took place approximately from August 25, 1937 to November 15, 1938.&lt;ref name="balticnorthernminorities"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balticnorthernminorities.org/pdf/project_abstracts.pdf |title=The 'Polish operation' of the NKVD |publisher=[[Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University in Warsaw|University of Stefan Wyszyński]] in [[Warsaw]] |work=The Baltic and Arctic Areas under Stalin.

Among them were tens of thousands of peasants, railway workers, industrial labourers, engineers and others. An additional 17 percent of victims came from the Soviet Byelorussia. The rest came from around Western Siberia and Kazakhstan, where exiled Poles had lived since the [[Partitions of Poland|Partitions]], as well as from the southern Urals, northern Caucasus and the rest of Siberia, including the Far East.&lt;ref name="Gellately-Kiernan"&gt;{{cite book | title=The specter of genocide: mass murder in historical perspective. | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | author=Robert Gellately, Ben Kiernan | year=2003 | pages=396 | isbn=0521527503 | url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=k9Ro7b0tWz4C&amp;pg=PA232&amp;dq=%22lead,+in+the+next+fourteen+months,+to+the+arrest+of+143,810+people%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XHC3TdekDoPniALfvPE7&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lead%2C%20in%20the%20next%20fourteen%20months%2C%20to%20the%20arrest%20of%20143%2C810%20people%22&amp;f=false | quote= Polish operation (page 233 –) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following categories of people were arrested by the NKVD during its Polish operation, as described in Soviet documents:
# "Active" members of the [[Polish minority in Soviet Union]] (practically all Poles).&lt;ref name="Gellately-Kiernan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldman2011-217"/&gt;
# All [[immigrant]]s from [[Poland]].
# Political refugees from Poland (mostly members of the [[Communist Party of Poland]]).
# Former and present members of the [[Polish Socialist Party]] and other non-[[communist]] Polish political parties.
# All [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] from the [[Polish-Soviet war]] remaining in the Soviet Union.
# Members of [[Polish Military Organisation|Polska Organizacja Wojskowa]] listed in the special list (most of them were not members of that organisation).

===Killing process and death toll===
According to archives of the NKVD: 111,091 [[Poles]] and people accused of ties with Poland, were sentenced to death, and 28,744 were sentenced to [[labor camp]]s (known as the "dry guillotine" of slow death by exposure, malnutrition, and overwork);&lt;ref name="grhs.org"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.grhs.org/heritage/SovietRepression.pdf | title=Soviet "Paradise" Revisited: Genocide, Dissent, Memory and Denial | publisher=GRHS Heritage Society | accessdate=April 26, 2011 | author=Eric J.

The Operation was only a peak in the persecution of the Poles, which spanned more than a decade. As the Soviet statistics indicate, the number of ethnic Poles in the USSR dropped by 165,000 in that period. "It is estimated that Polish losses in the Ukrainian SSR were about 30%, while in the Belorussian SSR... the Polish minority was almost completely annihilated."&lt;ref name="balticnorthernminorities" /&gt;

[[Timothy Snyder]] gives a conservative estimate of 85,000 confirmed Poles executed simultaneously across the country.&lt;ref name="Snyder2010-103"/&gt;

Almost all victims of the NKVD shootings were men, wrote Michał Jasiński, most with families. Their wives and children were dealt with by the [[NKVD Order № 00486]]. The women were generally sentenced to deportation to Kazakhstan for an average of 5 to 10 years. Their children were put in orphanages to be brought up as Soviet, with no knowledge of their origins. All possessions of the accused were confiscated. The parents of the executed men – as well as their in-laws – were purposely left with nothing to live on, which usually sealed their fate as well. Statistical extrapolation, wrote Jasiński, increases the number of Polish victims in 1937–1938 to around 200–250,000 depending on size of their families.&lt;ref name="fronda"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fronda.gliwice.pl/czytelnia.php5?id=84 | title=Zapomniane ludobójstwo stalinowskie (The forgotten Stalinist genocide) | publisher=Gliwicki klub Fondy.

====Great Purge of Poles in Leningrad====
In [[Leningrad]], the [[NKVD]] reviewed local telephone books and arrested almost 7,000 citizens with Polish-sounding name with the vast majority of such nominal "suspects" were executed within 10 days of arrest.&lt;ref name="arlindo-correia"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.arlindo-correia.org/040111.html | title=The Devils’ Playground | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | accessdate=April 26, 2011 | author=Joshua Rubenstein | quote=Rubenstein is the Northeast regional director of [[Amnesty International USA]] and a co-editor of ''The Unknown Black Book: The Holocaust in the German-Occupied Soviet Territories.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genocide characterization==
Historian [[Michael Ellman]] asserts that the "national operations", particularly the "Polish Operation", may have constituted [[genocide]] as defined by the UN convention.&lt;ref name="paulbogdanor"&gt;Michael Ellman, [http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/soviet/famine/ellman1933.pdf Stalin and the Soviet Famine of 1932-33 Revisited] [[PDF]] file&lt;/ref&gt; His opinion is shared by [[Simon Sebag Montefiore]], who calls the Polish operation of the NKVD "a mini-genocide".&lt;ref&gt;Simon Sebag Montefiore.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10092">'''Political repression''' is the [[persecution]] of an individual or group within society for political reasons, particularly for the purpose of restricting or preventing their ability to take part in the [[politics|political life]] of a [[society]] thereby reducing their standing among their fellow citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, Christian (2007). [http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521864909 ''State Repression and the Domestic Democratic Peace''] New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, Christian, Johnston, Hank and Mueller, Carol (2004). [http://www.upress.umn.edu/Books/D/davenport_repression.html ''Repression and Mobilization''] Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political repression is sometimes used synonymously with the term political [[discrimination]] (also known as politicism). It often is manifested through discriminatory policies, such as [[human rights]] violations, [[surveillance abuse]], [[police brutality]], [[imprisonment]], [[Involuntary settlements in the Soviet Union|involuntary settlement]], [[Lishenets|stripping of citizen's rights]], [[lustration]] and violent action or [[terror]] such as the murder, [[summary execution]]s, [[torture]], [[forced disappearance]] and other [[extrajudicial punishment]] of [[political activist]]s, [[dissident]]s, or general population. &lt;ref&gt;Kittrie, Nicholas N. 1995. ''The War Against Authority: From the Crisis of Legitimacy to a New Social Contract. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press.''&lt;/ref&gt; Political repression can also be reinforced by means outside of written policy, such as by public and private media ownership and by [[self-censorship]] within the public.

Where political repression is sanctioned and organised by the state, it may constitute [[state terrorism]], [[genocide]], politicide or [[crimes against humanity]]. Systemic and violent political repression is a typical feature of [[dictatorship]]s, [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] states and similar regimes.&lt;ref&gt;Serge, Victor, 1979, ''What Everyone Should Know About State Repression, London: New Park Publications.''&lt;/ref&gt; Acts of political repression may be carried out by [[secret police]] forces, army, [[paramilitary]] groups or [[death squad]]s.  Repressive activities have also been found within democratic contexts as well.&lt;ref&gt;Donner, Frank J. (1980). ''The Age of Surveillance: The Aims and Methods of America’s Political Intelligence System''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. {{ISBN|0-394-40298-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donner, Frank J. (1990). ''Protectors of Privilege: Red Squads and Police Repression in Urban America.'' Berkeley: University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-05951-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can even include setting up situations where the death of the target of repression is the end result.&lt;ref&gt;Haas, Jeffrey. ''The Assassination of Fred Hampton: How the FBI and the Chicago Police Murdered a Black Panther.'' Chicago, Ill.: Lawrence Hill /Chicago Review, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

If political repression is not carried out with the approval of the state, a section of government may still be responsible. An example is the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[COINTELPRO]] operations in the United States between 1956 and 1971.&lt;ref&gt;''COINTELPRO: The FBI's Covert Action Programs Against American Citizens, Final Report of the Senate Committee to Study Governmental Operations with respect to Intelligence Activities.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, D. 2004. ''There’s something happening here: The New Left, the Klan, and FBI counterintelligence.'' Berkeley: Univ. of California.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some states, "repression" can be an official term used in legislation or the names of government institutions. For example, the [[Soviet Union]] had a legal policy of repression of political opposition defined in [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)|the penal code]] and [[Cuba]] under [[Fulgencio Batista]] had a secret police agency officially named the "[[Bureau for the Repression of Communist Activities]]".

==In political conflict==

Political conflict strongly increases the likelihood of state repression. This is arguably the most robust finding in social science research on political repression – [[civil war]]s are a strong predictor of repressive activity, as are other forms of challenges from non-government actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hill|first1=Daniel W.|last2=Jones|first2=Zachary M.|title=An Empirical Evaluation of Explanations for State Repression|journal=American Political Science Review|date=2014|volume=108|issue=03|pages=661–687|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9327383&amp;fileId=S0003055414000306|doi=10.1017/s0003055414000306}}&lt;/ref&gt; States so often engage in repressive behaviors in times of civil conflict that the relationship between these two phenomena has been termed the "Law of Coercive Responsiveness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davenport|first1=Christian|title=State Repression and Political Order|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|date=2007|volume=10|pages=1–23|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.polisci.10.101405.143216?journalCode=polisci|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.10.101405.143216}}&lt;/ref&gt; When their authority or legitimacy is threatened, regimes respond by overtly or covertly suppressing dissidents to eliminate the behavioral threat. State repression subsequently affects dissident mobilization, though the direction of this effect is still an open question. Some strong evidence suggests that repression suppresses dissident mobilization by reducing the capacity of challengers to organize, yet it is also feasible that challengers can leverage state repressive behavior to spur mobilization among sympathizers by framing repression as a new grievance against the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ritter|first1=Emily Hencken|title=Policy Disputes, Political Survival, and the Onset and Severity of State Repression|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|date=2014|volume=58|issue=1|pages=143–168|url=http://jcr.sagepub.com/content/58/1/143.short|doi=10.1177/0022002712468724}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Violence ==
Political repression is often accompanied by violence, which might be legal or illegal according to domestic law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/FS36_sp.pdf|title=Los Derechos Humanos y la trata de personas.|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Violence can both eliminate political opposition directly by killing opposition members, or indirectly by instilling fear.
{{further|Extrajudicial killing|Politicide}}

== Intolerance ==
Political repression is sometimes synonymous with political, ideological, religious and social [[discrimination]] and [[Social tolerance|intolerance]]. This intolerance is manifested through discriminatory policies, [[human rights violations]], [[police brutality]], [[imprisonment]], [[Genocide|extermination]], [[exile]], [[extortion]], [[terrorism]], [[extrajudicial killing]], [[summary execution]], [[torture]], [[forced disappearance]] and other punishments against political activists, dissidents, and population in general.

== State terrorism ==
When political repression is sanctioned and organized by the state, situations of [[state terrorism]], [[genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]] can be reached. Systematic and violent political repression is a typical feature of [[Dictatorship|dictatorships]], [[Totalitarianism|totalitarianisms]] and similar regimes. In these regimes, acts of political repression can be carried out by the police and [[secret police]], the army, paramilitary groups and death squads. Sometimes regimes considered democratic exercise political repression and state terrorism to other states as part of their security policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/477299442|title=Torturadores, apropiadores y asesinos : el terrorismo de estado en la obra dramática de Eduardo Pavlovsky.|last=Patricia.|first=Scipioni, Estela|date=2000-01-01|publisher=Edition Reichenberger|isbn=9783931887919|oclc=477299442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Egypt in transition===
{{main|Egyptian Revolution of 2011}}
{{See also|Aftermath of the Egyptian Revolution of 2011}}
Protests against President [[Hosni Mubarak]] in early 2011 led to his resignation and trial after the Egyptian military switched its allegiance to the demonstrators. Mubarak's downfall was only the second revolution in the [[Arab world]] of the revolutionary wave known as the [[Arab Spring]].

Vice President [[Omar Suleiman]], who announced Mubarak's resignation in February 2011, handed power to the [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12433045|title=Egypt crisis: President Hosni Mubarak resigns as leader|publisher=BBC News|date=12 February 2011 |accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt came under [[martial law]] as top generals led by [[Mohamed Hussein Tantawi]] began directing Egypt toward democratic elections. This period was marked by further conflict and continuing protests, as demonstrators who had cheered the support of the military in removing Mubarak turned against the generals when they began imposing harsh security measures and tamping down on revolutionary activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/114/32814/Egypt/-January-Revolution-continues/AntiSCAF-protesters-shape-anniversary-of-revolutio.aspx|work=Al-Ahram |date=26 January 2012|accessdate=6 July 2013|title=Anti-SCAF protesters shape anniversary of revolution in Tahrir}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt|Muslim Brotherhood]] emerged as a leading voice in criticizing military rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/muslim-brotherhood-criticizes-egypts-military-crackdown-on-protests/2011/12/18/gIQA9ERE3O_story.html|title=Muslim Brotherhood criticizes Egypt's military crackdown on protests|date=18 December 2011|accessdate=6 July 2013|work=The Washington Post|first=Leila|last=Fadel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Islamist-dominated [[Parliament of Egypt|parliament]] was elected in late 2011 and early 2012. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces dissolved the body in June 2012, saying many of the elections were illegitimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/47811614#.T9o_KVJy9RU|author=Hamza Hendawi|title=Egypt court orders parliament dissolved|agency=Associated Press|publisher=MSNBC|date=14 June 2012|accessdate=14 June 2012}}{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morsi administration===
{{main|Egyptian presidential election, 2012}}
{{See also|Egyptian constitutional referendum, 2012}}
[[Egyptian presidential election, 2012|Presidential elections]] were held in mid-2012. No candidate garnered as much as a quarter of the vote in the first round of elections. The top two candidates advanced to the runoff: Mohamed Morsi of the [[Freedom and Justice Party (Egypt)|Freedom and Justice Party]], the candidate of the Muslim Brotherhood, and [[Ahmed Shafik]], an independent candidate who served as [[prime minister of Egypt]] under Mubarak. Morsi strongly criticized the Mubarak regime and offered a vision for Egypt as an [[Islamic democracy]], while Shafik, a [[secularism|secularist]], promised to restore order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/spotlight/egypt/2012/06/201261482158653237.html|title=Meet the candidates: Morsi vs Shafiq|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=24 June 2012|accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morsi ultimately prevailed in the runoff, defeating Shafik by a margin of 3.5 percentage points. While Islamists hailed Morsi's election with enthusiasm, many [[Copts]] and liberals viewed the runoff as a choice between two unappealing candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/24/us-egypt-election-idUSBRE85G01U20120624|title=Islamist joy as Morsy elected Egypt president|date=24 June 2012|accessdate=6 July 2013|publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morsi reinstated parliament days after his election,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jon Leyne|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18761403|title=Egyptian President Mursi reverses parliament dissolution|publisher=BBC News|date=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lawmakers set to work drafting a [[constitution of Egypt|constitution]]. The constitution was passed over the objections of opposition members who argued the process was faulty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/9711879/Egyptian-draft-constitution-to-keep-sharia-as-main-source-of-law.html|title=Egyptian draft constitution to keep sharia as 'main' source of law|work=The Telegraph|date=29 November 2012|accessdate=6 July 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; When put to a [[Egyptian constitutional referendum, 2012|referendum]] in December 2012, the constitution was approved by a nearly 28-point margin, as supporters successfully argued that approval of the constitution was needed to ensure stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Egypt draft charter vote 'right move for stability': Salafist leaders |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/59646/Egypt/Politics-/Egypt-draft-charter-vote-right-move-for-stability-.aspx|work=Al-Ahram |date=2 December 2012 |accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Morsi's government faced popular protests after the president decreed in November 2012 that he had vast powers that could not be checked by the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/22/morsi-constitutional-declaration_n_2175651.html|agency=Associated Press|date=22 November 2012|accessdate=6 July 2013|title=Morsi's Constitutional Declarations Grant Egypt's President Far-Reaching Powers|work=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protesters called for Morsi to withdraw his constitutional declaration or resign from office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/27/world/meast/egypt-protests|title=Protesters to Morsy: Roll back your decree or leave|publisher=CNN|date=27 November 2012|accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within weeks, Morsi annulled the declaration, days before the constitution itself was approved by voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20121209/178014036.html|title=Egypt's Morsi Annuls Constitutional Declaration - Spokesman|publisher=RIA Novosti|date=9 December 2012|accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012-13 Protests====
 {{main|2012–13 Egyptian protests}}

===Coup d'état===
{{main|2013 Egyptian coup d'état}}
Protests against Morsi continued throughout the first half of 2013, whipping up in June 2013 briefly after the president appointed an Islamist accused of involvement in the [[Luxor massacre]] to head the [[Luxor Governorate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/17/morsi-appoints-islamist-governor-luxor|title=Egypt's Mohamed Morsi appoints hardline Islamist to govern Luxor|date=17 June 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|first=Patrick|last=Kingsley}}&lt;/ref&gt; and culminating in mass demonstrations that began on 30 June. Protesters criticized Morsi for alleged mismanagement of the country and for the growing influence of the Muslim Brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23122191|title=BBC in Egypt: 'People were not expecting this' |date=30 June 2013|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tamarod]] movement, which translates into [[English language|English]] as "Rebel", claimed it had gathered 22 million signatures from Egyptians opposed to Morsi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2013/06/29/-Rebel-campaign-receives-more-than-22-million-signatures-in-anti-Mursi-petition.html|title=Anti-Mursi 'Rebel' campaign receives more than 22 million signatures|date=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some sources, the protests were the largest in Egypt's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/news/egypt-milllions-protest-morsi-458/|title='Biggest protest in Egypt's history'|date=30 June 2013|publisher=RT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Egyptian Armed Forces]] again sided with demonstrators against the regime, warning Morsi to respond to protesters' demands or face a "political road map" widely expected to involve the president's removal from office. Despite this, Morsi remained defiant, giving a speech on 2 July insisting he was the legitimate president and would sooner die than relinquish power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/175128/what-led-morsis-fall-and-what-comes-next|title=What Led to Morsi's Fall—and What Comes Next?|work=The Nation|date=5 July 2013|accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Defence Minister [[Abdul Fatah al-Sisi]] informed Morsi that he was no longer president and addressed the country on television to announce the [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état|change in leadership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.pnn.ps/index.php/international/5101-al-sisi-egyptian-army-deposes-morsi,-constitution-suspended|title=Al-Sisi: Egyptian Army Deposes Morsi, Constitution Suspended|agency=Palestine News Network|date=4 July 2013|accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/05/us-egypt-protests-downfall-specialreport-idUSBRE9640SP20130705|agency=Reuters|title=Special Report: Mursi's downfall|date=5 July 2013|accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation of new government==
Indications on 6 July 2013 that [[Mohamed ElBaradei]] would be sworn in as prime minister proved to be incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/07/201376165715352978.html|publisher=Al Jazeera English|title=ElBaradei not confirmed as Egypt PM|date=7 July 2013|accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, a founding member of the [[Egyptian Social Democratic Party]] named [[Ziad Bahaa El-Din]] was reportedly offered the post of [[Prime Minister]], while ElBaradei was nominated as vice president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/75973/Egypt/Politics-/Update--Bahaa-ElDin-offered-Egypts-PM-job,-ElBarad.aspx|work=Al-Ahram |title=Bahaa El-Din offered Egypt's PM job, ElBaradei set to be appointed VP|date=7 July 2013|accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Younes Makhioun]], chairman of the [[Nour Party]], objected to both appointments because both of them belong to the same political coalition (the [[National Salvation Front (Egypt)|National Salvation Front]]); he called for nominees who were "politically neutral" instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/07/egypt-protests-nour-idUSL6N0FD0S220130707|agency=Reuters|title=Key Egypt Islamist party rejects PM, vice-president choices|date=7 July 2013|accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nour Party rejected El-Din on 7 July 2013 and pulled out of the transitional process altogether on 8 July 2013 because of the [[2013 Republican Guard Headquarters clashes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/07/08/al-nour-party-withdraws-from-al-sisis-roadmap/|work=Daily News Egypt|title=Al-Nour Party withdraws from Al-Sisi's roadmap|date=7 July 2013|accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the party has advised the interim government on ministerial candidates, including Ahmed Darwish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=El-Beblawi continues to meet ministerial candidates|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/07/15/el-beblawi-continues-to-meet-ministerial-candidates/|accessdate=16 July 2013|work=Daily News Egypt|date=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hazem Al Beblawi]] was sworn in as prime minister on 9 July 2013 with the backing of the Nour Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jul/9/egypts-interim-president-appoints-prime-minister-v/|title=Egypt's interim president names leadership, Salafists approve|work=Washington Times|date=9 July 2013|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronology==

===Prelude===
==== 3 July military coup ====

'''{{IAST|Puruṣārtha}}''' ([[Sanskrit]]: पुरुषार्थ) literally means an "object of human pursuit".&lt;ref name=se1&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=puruSArtha&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 puruSArtha] Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; It is a key concept in Hinduism, and refers to the four proper goals or aims of a human life. The four ''puruṣārthas'' are [[Dharma]] (righteousness, moral values), [[Artha]] (prosperity, economic values), [[Kama]] (pleasure, love, psychological values) and [[Moksha]] (liberation, spiritual values).&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Flood|1996|p=17}}, {{harv|Olivelle|1993|pp=216–219}}; Cf. also {{harv|Apte|1965|p=626}}; {{harv|Hopkins|1971|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M Hiriyanna (2000), Philosophy of Values, in Indian Philosophy: Theory of value (Editor: Roy Perrett), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-8153-3612-9}}, pages 1–10&lt;/ref&gt;

All four ''Purusarthas'' are important, but in cases of conflict, ''Dharma'' is considered more important than ''Artha'' or ''Kama'' in Hindu philosophy.&lt;ref name=gavinf16/&gt;&lt;ref name=po4/&gt; ''Moksha'' is considered the ultimate ideal of human life.&lt;ref name="The Principles of Hindu Ethics"&gt;Alban Widgery (1930), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2377977 The Principles of Hindu Ethics], International Journal of Ethics, 40(2): 239–240&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, this is not a consensus among all Hindus, and many have different interpretations of the hierarchy, and even as to whether one should exist.

Historical Indian scholars recognized and debated the inherent tension between active pursuit of wealth (Artha purusartha) and pleasure (Kama), and renunciation of all wealth and pleasure for the sake of spiritual liberation (Moksha). They proposed "action with renunciation" or "craving-free, dharma-driven action", also called ''[[Nishkam Karma]]'' as a possible solution to the tension.&lt;ref name=ghr/&gt;&lt;ref name=gede/&gt;

==Etymology==

''Puruṣartha'' (पुरुषार्थ) is a composite Sanskrit word from ''Purusha'' (पुरुष) and ''Artha'' (अर्थ). ''Purusha'' means "human being", "soul" as well as "universal principle and soul of the universe".&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=puruSa&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning= puruSa] Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; ''Artha'' in one context means "purpose", "object of desire" and "meaning".&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=artha&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 artha] Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; Together, ''Purusartha'' literally means "purpose of human being" or "object of human pursuit".&lt;ref name=se1/&gt;&lt;ref name=rp&gt;R Prasad (2008), A Conceptual-analytic Study of Classical Indian Philosophy of Morals, {{ISBN|978-81-8069-544-5}}, page 125&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alf Hiltebeitel]] translates ''Purusartha'' as "Goals of Man".&lt;ref name=h17/&gt;  [[Prasad]] clarifies that "Man" includes both man and woman in ancient and medieval Indian texts.&lt;ref name=rp/&gt; Olivelle translates it as the "aims of human life".&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Olivelle|1993|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Purusartha is also referred to as ''Caturvarga''.&lt;ref&gt;Sushil Mittal and Gene Thursby (2004), The Hindu World, Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-21527-7}}, page 4, Quote: "There are four categories or life-ideals (caturvarga or purusartha) that usually are said to provide the framework for classical Hindu society".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==
{{Main article|Dharma|Artha|Kama|Moksha}}
''Purusartha'' is a key concept in Hinduism, which holds that every human being has four proper goals that are necessary and sufficient for a fulfilling and happy life,&lt;ref&gt;See:

(2013), Columbia University Press, Gale, {{ISBN|978-0-7876-5015-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu dharma includes the religious duties, moral rights and duties of each individual, as well as behaviors that enable social order, right conduct, and those that are virtuous.&lt;ref name=tce/&gt; Dharma, according to Van Buitenen,&lt;ref name=vanbuitenen&gt;J. A. B. Van Buitenen, Dharma and Moksa, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp 33–40&lt;/ref&gt; is that which all existing beings must accept and respect to sustain harmony and order in the world. It is, states Van Buitenen, the pursuit and execution of one's nature and true calling, thus playing one's role in cosmic concert.&lt;ref name=vanbuitenen/&gt;

===Relative importance between four goals of life===
Ancient Indian literature emphasizes that dharma is foremost. If dharma is ignored, artha and kama - profit and pleasure respectively - lead to social chaos.&lt;ref name=gavinf16&gt;Gavin Flood (1996), The meaning and context of the Purusarthas, in [[Julius Lipner]] (Editor) - The Fruits of Our Desiring, {{ISBN|978-1-896209-30-2}}, pp 16–21&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gautama's Dharmasutra|Gautama]] Dharmashastra, [[Apastamba]] Dharmasutra and [[Yājñavalkya Smṛti]], as examples, all suggest that dharma comes first and is more important than artha and kama.&lt;ref name=po4&gt;See:

[[Kamasutra]] states the relative value of three goals as follows: artha is more important and should precede kama, while dharma is more important and should precede both kama and artha.&lt;ref name=ksv&gt;The Hindu Kama Shastra Society (1925), [https://archive.org/stream/kamasutraofvatsy00vatsuoft#page/8/mode/2up The Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana], University of Toronto Archives, pp. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Kautiliya's [[Arthashastra]], however, argues that artha is the foundation for the other two. Without prosperity and security in society or at individual level, both moral life and sensuality become difficult. Poverty breeds vice and hate, while prosperity breeds virtues and love, suggested Kautiliya.&lt;ref name=gavinf16/&gt; Kautilya adds that all three are mutually connected, and one should not cease enjoying life, nor virtuous behavior, nor pursuit of wealth creation. Excessive pursuit of any one aspect of life with complete rejection of other two, harms all three including the one excessively pursued.&lt;ref name=ka&gt;See:
* Kautilya Arthashastra at 1.7.3–7; For English translation - Rangarajan (1987), Penguin Classics, {{ISBN|978-0-14-044603-6}};
* Ashok S. Chousalkar (2004), Methodology of Kautilya's Arthashastra, The Indian Journal of Political Science, Vol. 65, No. 1, pp. 55–76&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sastra]]s, states Kane,&lt;ref&gt;P.V. Kane (1941), History of Dharmasastra, Volume 2, Part 1, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; observe that the relative precedence of artha, kama and dharma are naturally different with age.

Moksha is considered in Hinduism as the ''parama-puruṣārtha'' or ultimate goal of human life.&lt;ref name=h17/&gt;

===Tension between four goals of life===
Indian scholars recognized and have debated the inherent tension between renunciation and ''Moksha'' on one hand, and the active pursuit of ''Kama'' and ''Artha'' on the other.&lt;ref&gt;R. V. De Smet (1972), Early Trends in the Indian Understanding of Man, Philosophy East and West, 22(3): 259–268&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to the concepts of ''Pravrtti'' (प्रवृत्ति, Pravritti) and ''Nivrtti'' (निवृत्ति, Nivritti), with former meaning "giving or devoting one's self to" external action, while the latter means "withdrawing and restraining one's self from" external action in order to focus on one's own liberation. ''Artha'' and ''Kama'' are ''Pravrtti'', while ''Moksha'' is ''Nivrtti''.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen N Hay and William Theodore De Bary (1988), Sources of Indian Tradition, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-81-208-0467-8}}, page 211&lt;/ref&gt; Both are considered important in Hinduism. Manusmriti, for example, describes it as,&lt;ref name=ghr/&gt;

{{Quote|
Activity, according to orthodox tradition, is of two kinds: ''pravrtti'' and ''nivrtti'',&lt;br&gt;
The first kind of activity leads to progress (''abhyudaya''), and the second, to perfection (''nihsreyasa'').
|Manusmriti|12.88 &lt;ref name=ghr&gt;GH Rao (1926), The Basis of Hindu Ethics, International Journal of Ethics, 37(1): 19–35&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Indian scholars offered a creative resolution to the tension between "action"-filled life and "renunciation"-driven life, by suggesting the best of both worlds can be achieved by dedicating oneself to "action with renunciation", that is when "action is without attachment or craving for results". Action must be engaged in because it is ''Dharma'', that is, it is good, virtuous, right, a duty and a moral activity, and not because of one's craving for the results or material rewards without any consideration for Dharma. This idea of "craving-free, dharma-driven action" has been called ''[[Nishkam Karma]]'' in [[Bhagavad Gita]].&lt;ref name=gede&gt;Gerard Delanty (2012), Routledge Handbook of Cosmopolitanism Studies, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-60081-1}}, page 465&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P Bilimoria (1993), ''Indian Ethics'', in A Companion to Ethics (Editor: Peter Singer), Wiley, {{ISBN|978-0-631-18785-1}}, page 73&lt;/ref&gt; Other Indian texts state the same answer to tension between "pursue wealth and love" versus "renounce everything" ''Purusarthas'', but using different words. Isa Upanishad, for example, states "act and enjoy with renunciation, do not covet".&lt;ref name=ghr/&gt;

===Origins of purusartha theory===
The concept of ''moksha'' developed only in the ''[[Upanishads]]'', while the early ''[[Vedas]]'' treating the goals of human life commonly refer to ''kāma'', ''artha'' and ''dharma'' as the "''trivarga''" or "three categories" of possible human pursuits. The ''[[Dharmaśāstra]]s'' and the epics ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]'' are the first known sources that comprehensively present the notion that integrated living entails the pursuit of four goals or ends.&lt;ref name=h17&gt;{{harv|Hiltebeitel|2002|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prasad (2008) states that the division between the ''trivarga'' and ''mokṣa'' is intended to highlight the context between the social (''trivarga'') and personal (''mokṣa'') spheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Prasad|2008|pp=360–362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Sannyasa]]'' is entirely focussed on the pursuit of ''Moksha'' without violating ''Dharma''. Baudhayana Dharmasūtra, completed by about 7th century BC, states the following behavioral vows for a person in ''Sannyasa'',&lt;ref name=mmbd2&gt;[[Max Muller]] (Translator), [https://archive.org/stream/pt2sacredlawsof14bhuoft#page/278/mode/2up Baudhayana Dharmasūtra Prasna II, Adhyaya 10, Kandika 18], The [[Sacred Books of the East]], Vol. XIV, Oxford University Press, pages 279–281&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|
These are the vows a Sannyasi must keep –

Abstention from injuring living beings, truthfulness, abstention from appropriating the property of others, abstention from sex, liberality (kindness, gentleness) are the major vows. There are five minor vows: abstention from anger, obedience towards the guru, avoidance of rashness, cleanliness, and purity in eating. He should beg (for food) without annoying others, any food he gets he must compassionately share a portion with other living beings, sprinkling the remainder with water he should eat it as if it were a medicine.
|[[Baudhayana|Baudhāyana]]|Dharmasūtra, II.10.18.1–10 &lt;ref name=mmbd2/&gt;}}

Baudhāyana also makes repeated references to the ''Sannyasa'' (ascetic) stage and its behavioral focus, such as in verses II.13.7 and 11.18.13. This reference, [[Patrick Olivelle|Olivelle]] states, is found in many early to mid 1st millennium BC texts, and is clearly from [[gnomic poetry]] about an established ascetic tradition by the time Baudhayana Dharmasutra and other texts were written.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Olivelle|1993|pp=215–216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Katha Upanishad, in hymns 2.1–2.2 contrasts the human feeling of pleasant (''preyas'', प्रेयस्) with that of bliss (''sreyas'', श्रेयस्), praising the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Olivelle|1993|p=64, see footnote}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hymns of [[Rigveda|Rig Veda]] in Book 10 Chapter 136, mention ''[[Rishi|Muni]]'' (मुनि, monks, mendicants, holy man), with characteristics that mirror those found in later concepts of renunication-practising, ''Moksha''-motivated ascetics (''Sannyasins'' and ''Sannyasinis'').  These ''Muni'' are said to be ''Kesins'' (केशिन्, long haired) wearing ''Mala'' clothes (मल, dirty, soil-colored, yellow, orange, saffron) and engaged in the affairs of ''Mananat'' (mind, meditation).&lt;ref name=gsg&gt;GS Ghurye (1952), Ascetic Origins, Sociological Bulletin, Vol. 1, No. 2, pages 162–184;&lt;br&gt;For Sanskrit original: [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१०.१३६ Rigveda] Wikisource;&lt;br&gt;For English translation: [https://archive.org/stream/hymnsrigveda00unkngoog#page/n588/mode/2up Kesins] Rig Veda, Hymn CXXXVI, Ralph Griffith (Translator)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purusartha focused literature==
Each of these four canonical ''puruṣārthas'' was subjected to a process of study and extensive literary development in Indian history. This produced numerous treatises, with a diversity of views, in each category. Some purusartha-focused literature include,

* On Dharma
:These texts discuss ''dharma'' from various religious, social, duties, morals and personal ethics perspective. Each of six major schools of Hinduism has its own literature on dharma. Examples include Dharma-sutras (particularly by [[Gautama's Dharmasutra|Gautama]], [[Apastamba]], [[Baudhayana]] and [[Vāsiṣṭha]]) and Dharma-sastras (particularly [[Manusmṛti]], [[Yājñavalkya Smṛti]], [[Nāradasmṛti]] and [[Viṣṇusmṛti]]). At personal dharma level, this includes many chapters of [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yogasutras]].
* On Artha
:Artha-related texts discuss ''artha'' from individual, social and as a compendium of economic policies, politics and laws. For example, the ''[[Arthashastra]]'' of [[Chanakya|Kauṭilya]], the Kamandakiya Nitisara,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/kamandakiyanitis00kamarich#page/n15/mode/2up Kamandakiya Niti Sara] MN Dutt (Translator)&lt;/ref&gt; Brihaspati Sutra,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/brihaspatisutrao00brharich#page/n5/mode/2up Brihaspati Sutra - Politics and Government] Sanskrit Original with English translation by FW Thomas (1921)&lt;/ref&gt; and Sukra Niti.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Sacred_Books_of_the_Hindus/SBH%2013%20-%20Sukra%20Niti%20Sara%20English%20Translation%20-%20Benoy%20Kumar%20Sarkar%201914#page/n1/mode/2up Sukra Niti] Bk Sarkar (Translator); Chapter 1 verse 43 onwards - Rules of State and Duties of Rulers; Chapter 1 verse 424 onwards - Guidelines on infrastructure for economy; Chapter 1 verse 550 onwards - Guidelines on treasury management, law and military; Chapter 2 - Functions of state officials, etc&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patrick Olivelle|Olivelle]] states that most Artha-related treatises from ancient India have been lost.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Olivelle (2011), Language, Texts, and Society: Explorations in Ancient Indian Culture and Religion, Anthem Press, {{ISBN|978-0-85728-431-0}}, page 174&lt;/ref&gt;
* On Kama
:These discuss arts, emotions, love, erotics, relationships and other sciences in the pursuit of pleasure. The [[Kamasutra]] of [[Vātsyāyana]] is most well known. Others texts include [[Ratirahasya]], Jayamangala, Smaradipika, Ratimanjari, Ratiratnapradipika, [[Ananga Ranga]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Soble (2005), Sex from Plato to Paglia, {{ISBN|978-0-313-33424-5}}, page 493&lt;/ref&gt;
* On Moksha
:These develop and debate the nature and process of liberation, freedom and spiritual release. Major treatises on the pursuit of moksa include the [[Upanishad]]s, [[Vivekachudamani]], [[Bhagavad Gita]], and the sastras on [[Yoga]].

The [[Indian epic poetry|Sanskrit Epics]] devote major sections on ''purusarthas'',&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Brockington (1998), The Sanskrit Epics, Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-90-04-10260-6}}, page 2 and Introduction chapter&lt;/ref&gt; in particular debating dharma.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel H. H. Ingalls (1957), Dharma and Moksa, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2, pages 41–48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J Ganeri (2010), A Return to the Self: Indians and Greeks on Life as Art and Philosophical Therapy, Royal Institute of Philosophy supplement, 85(66), pages 119–135&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient [[Tamil Sangam literature|Tamil literature]] of the [[Tirukkural]] focuses on the first three of the purusarthas (Dharma, Artha, and Kama) without discussing Moksha, suggesting that "the proper pursuit of the other three will inevitably lead to the fourth."&lt;ref name="PSSundaram_Kural"&gt;{{cite book

==Ashrama==
The four puruṣārthas are often discussed in the context of four [[Ashrama (stage)|ashramas]] or stages of life (''[[Brahmacharya]]'' – student, ''[[Grihastha]]'' – householder, ''[[Vanaprastha]]'' – retirement and ''[[Sannyasa]]'' – renunciation). Scholars have attempted to connect the four stages to the four puruṣārthas, however Olivelle dismisses this, as neither ancient nor medieval texts of India state that any of the first three ashramas must devote itself predominantly to one specific goal of life.&lt;ref name=paol&gt;Patrick Olivelle (1993), The Āśrama System: The History and Hermeneutics of a Religious Institution, Oxford University Press, {{oclc|466428084}}, pages 216–219&lt;/ref&gt; 

The fourth stage of ''Sannyasa'' is different, and the overwhelming consensus in ancient and medieval Indian texts is that anyone accepting ''Sannyasa'' must entirely devote to ''Moksha'' aided by ''Dharma'', with a complete renunciation of ''Artha'' and ''Kama''.&lt;ref name=paol/&gt;

With the known exception of [[Kamasutra]], most texts make no recommendation on the relative preference on Artha or Kama, that an individual must emphasize in what stage of life. The Kamasutra states,&lt;ref name=paol/&gt;

{{Quote|
The life span of a man is one hundred years. Dividing that time, he should attend to three aims of life in such a way that they support, rather than hinder each other. In his youth he should attend to profitable aims (artha) such as learning, in his prime to pleasure (kama), and in his old age to dharma and moksha.|Kamasutra 1.2.1–1.2.4|Translated by Patrick Olivelle &lt;ref name=paol/&gt;}}

This text does not mention the ashramas however.

'''Quixotism''' ({{IPAc-en|k|w|ɪ|k|ˈ|s|ɒ|t|ɪ|z|əm}} or {{IPAc-en|k|iː|ˈ|h|oʊ|t|ɪ|z|əm}}) (adj. [[:wikt:quixotic|quixotic]]) is impracticality in pursuit of ideals, especially those ideals manifested by rash, lofty and romantic ideas or extravagantly chivalrous action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/quixotic  Merriam-Webster dictionary definition of quixotic]&lt;/ref&gt; It also serves to describe an [[idealism]] without regard to [[practical]]ity. An impulsive person or act might be regarded as quixotic.

Quixotism is usually related to "over-idealism", meaning an idealism that doesn't take consequence or absurdity into account. It is also related to naïve [[romanticism]] and to [[utopianism]].

==Origin==
Quixotism as a term or a quality appeared after the publication of ''[[Don Quixote]]'' in 1605. Don Quixote, the hero of this novel, written by Spanish author [[Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra]], dreams up a romantic ideal world which he believes to be real, and acts on this idealism, which most famously leads him into [[imagination|imaginary]] fights with windmills that he regards as [[Giant (mythology)|giant]]s, leading to the related metaphor of "[[tilting at windmills]]."

Already in the 17th century the term '''Quixote''' was used to describe a person who does not distinguish between reality and imagination. The poet [[John Cleveland]] wrote in 1644, in his book ''The character of a London diurnall'':
:"The Quixotes of this Age fight with the Wind-mills of their owne Heads"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/tilting-at-windmills.html The Phrase Finder: Tilting at windmills]&lt;/ref&gt;

The word '''Quixotism''' is mentioned, for the first time, in ''Pulpit Popery, True Popery'' (1688):
:"All the Heroical Fictions of Ecclesiastical Quixotism"

'''RTI International''' (formerly '''Research Triangle Institute''') is a [[nonprofit organization]] headquartered in the [[Research Triangle Park]] in [[North Carolina]] that provides research and technical services. It was founded in 1958 with $500,000 in funding by local businesses and the three North Carolina universities in the [[Research Triangle]] region. RTI started with departments for research in isotopes, operational sciences and statistics. It restructured into four departments in 1971 and later created the Office for International Projects, now called the International Development Group. 

RTI later split into eleven departments, including Health Research, Drug Discovery &amp; Development, Education &amp; Training Research, Survey Research, among others. The [[US Agency for International Development]] has come to account for 35 percent of RTI's research revenue. RTI research has covered HIV/AIDS, healthcare, education curriculum and the environment, among others. Forbes magazine ranked RTI International sixth of 250 in its America’s Best Employers list for mid-size companies for 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|date=March 23, 2016|accessdate=April 20, 2016|url=https://www.forbes.com/best-midsize-employers/list/#tab:rank|title=America's Beset Midsize Employers}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, RTI acquired business interests in banking/financial consulting to accompany its profitable RTI-Health Solutions, a unit focused on the pharmaceutical and health technology sectors.

==Organization==
RTI International is a not-for-profit research organization that also includes commercial for-profit industries in business consulting and pharmaceutical sectors. RTI was initially established by three local universities, but managed independently by a separate board and management team.&lt;ref name="csm"/&gt; RTI's structure consists of members of the corporation, the board of governors and corporate officers. The members of the corporation elect governors, who in turn create the organization's policies. Corporate officers are senior managers that report to the board for their area of responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=//www.rti.org/page.cfm/Corporate_Governance|title=Corporate Governance|publisher=The Research Triangle Institute|accessdate=January 9, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606201705/http://rti.org/page.cfm/Corporate_Governance|archivedate=June 6, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

RTI has eleven service areas:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=Research Triangle Institute|url=//www.rti.org/|accessdate=January 7, 2013|title=Main Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RTI also has a separate business called RTI Health Solutions, which supports biotech, diagnostic and medical device companies.&lt;ref name="overview"/&gt; As of 2012, the organization's largest division managed the social, statistical and environmental sciences services. More than half of RTI's staff have advanced degrees in one of 120 fields and work on approximately 1,200 projects at a time.&lt;ref name="foo"/&gt; RTI has partnerships with the Research Triangle Energy Consortium, the Triangle Global Health Consortium and other universities and research organizations. Many of RTI's staff hold faculty positions at the three universities that form the Research Triangle and participate in cooperative research projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=//www.rti.org/page.cfm?obj=9EB95F1E-C540-46AE-9BF2BFCE0DD49746|title=University Collaborations|publisher=RTI International|accessdate=February 22, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218001442/http://www.rti.org/page.cfm?obj=9EB95F1E-C540-46AE-9BF2BFCE0DD49746|archivedate=February 18, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are nine US offices and nine international locations in France, the United Kingdom, South America, India and Indonesia, among others, supporting operations in 80 countries.&lt;ref name="annualreport"/&gt; About 60 percent of RTI's staff are headquartered on a 180-acre campus inside the [[Research Triangle Park]].&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;&lt;ref name="overview"&gt;{{citation|title=RTI International Overview|url=//www.rti.org/brochures/rti_trifold_w.pdf|publisher=RTI International|accessdate=February 22, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124023732/http://www.rti.org/brochures/rti_trifold_w.pdf |archivedate=November 24, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of RTI International's funding comes from government research contracts.&lt;ref name="foo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="annual"&gt;{{citation|url=//www.rti.org/annual_reports/2012/rti_ar_2012.pdf|title=2012 Annual Report|publisher=RTI International|accessdate=February 22, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917082851/http://rti.org/annual_reports/2012/rti_ar_2012.pdf |archivedate=September 17, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 it authored 627 journal articles. RTI staff are not independent researchers, but are instead compensated for their time as salary in exchange for yielding any scientific interests in external publications and extramural funding. At the time, RTI owned 400 patents.&lt;ref name="annual"/&gt; RTI competes with the three universities that form the research triangle and other research institutes for contracts. It bids on $2 billion in research contracts a year and wins approximately 40 percent of the budget it bids on.&lt;ref name="foo"/&gt; While RTI is technically a non-profit research institute, senior employees are rewarded salary bonuses (4% for senior staff, and 9-15% for managers) based on annual performance and corporate profit. However, employees have no current vested interest or role in corporate governance.

Raman spectroscopy is sensitive to the composition and structure of any [[organic compound]], making it a powerful tool for the definitive identification and characterisation of [[biomarker]]s, and providing direct information of potential [[biosignature]]s of past microbial [[life on Mars]].&lt;ref name='RLS Home'/&gt;  This instrument will also provide general mineralogical information for igneous, metamorphous, and sedimentary processes.&lt;ref name='RLS Home'/&gt;

RST will also correlate its spectral information with other spectroscopic and imaging instruments such as the Infrared Spectrometer and [[MicrOmega-IR]].&lt;ref name='RLS Home'/&gt; This will be the first Raman analyser to be deployed for a planetary exploration.&lt;ref name='Rull 2017'/&gt; The first version for the rover was presented by Fernando Rull-Perez and Sylvestre Maurice in 2003.&lt;ref name='Rull 2017'/&gt; The RLS is being developed by a European consortium integrated by Spanish, French, German and UK partners.&lt;ref name='Rull 2017'/&gt; The [[Principal Investigator]] is Fernando Rull-Perez, from ''Centro de Astrobiología'' in Spain.&lt;ref name='RLS Home'/&gt; The co-investigator is from  Observatoire Midi-Pyrénées (LAOMP), France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://exploration.esa.int/mars/45103-rover-instruments/?fbodylongid=2130|title=The ExoMars Rover Instrument Suite|website=exploration.esa.int|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three major components are the ''Spectrometer Unit'', the ''Control and Excitation Unit'' (includes the power converters), and ''Optical head''.&lt;reF&gt;[https://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2011/pdf/2400.pdf]&lt;/reF&gt;

==Principle and operation==

The RLS instrument provides a structural fingerprint by which molecules can be identified. It is used to analyse the [[vibrational mode]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of a substance either in the solid, liquid or gas state.&lt;ref name='Rull 2017'/&gt; The technique relies on [[Raman scattering]] of a photon by molecules which are excited to higher vibrational or rotational energy levels. In more detail, it will collect and analyse the scattered light emitted by a [[laser]] on a crushed Mars rock sample; the [[Spectral density|spectrum]] observed (number of peaks, position and relative intensities) is determined by the molecular structure and composition of a compound, enabling the identification and characterisation of the compounds in the sample.&lt;ref name='RLS Home'/&gt; 

Some advantages of RLS over other analysers are that it is nondestructive, analysis is completed in a fraction of a second, and the spectral bands provide definitive composition of the material.&lt;ref name='Rull 2017'/&gt; RLS measurements will be conducted on the resulting crushed sample powder and it will be a useful tool for flagging the presence of organic molecules for further [[biomarker]] search by the [[Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer|MOMA]] analyser.

The [[Processor (computing)|processor]] board carries out several key functions for the Raman spectrometer control, spectral operation, data storage, and communications with the rover. The complete instrument has a mass of 2.4 kg (5.29 lb) and consumes about 30 [[Watt|W]] while operating.&lt;ref name='RLS Home'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Rull 2017'/&gt;&lt;ref name=Morala&gt;[https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/2449.pdf Raman Laser pectrometer for 2020 ExoMars Mission.

The '''risk adjusted mortality rate (RAMR)''' is a [[mortality rate]] that is adjusted for predicted risk of death. It is usually utilized to observe and/or compare the performance of certain institution(s) or person(s), e.g., [[hospital]]s or [[surgeon]]s.

It can be found as:

RAMR = (Observed Mortality Rate/Predicted Mortality Rate)* Overall (Weighted) Mortality Rate

In [[medical science]], RAMR could be a predictor of mortality that takes into account the predicted risk for a group of [[patient]]s. For example, for a group of patients first we need to find the observed mortality rates for all the hospitals of interest. Then we can build/construct a model or use an existing model to predict mortality rates for each of the hospitals. It is expected that the number of patients in each hospital will be different and hence we need an overall (weighted) mortality rate for all these hospitals. Once we have the above three rates, then we can utilize the above formula to find the risk adjusted mortality rate which will reflect the actual mortality rate of a particular hospital without being [[bias]]ed from the observed mortality.

In the [[English NHS]] the Summary Hospital-level Mortality Indicator, the Hospital Standardised Mortality Rate and the Risk Adjusted Mortality Index are all used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary Hospital-level Mortality Indicator|url=http://content.digital.nhs.uk/shmi|website=NHS Digital|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The BBC produced a table in 2011 comparing mortality on various measures across all [[:Category:NHS hospital trusts|NHS acute trust]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hospital death rates: Full table|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-15897345?sort1|accessdate=14 July 2017|publisher=BBC News|date=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sarkis Rizzi''', or Sarkis el-Rizzi (in Arabic:'''سركيس الرزي''', in Latin:''' Sergius Risius''', born in 1572 in Bkoufa, [[Lebanon]] - died in June 1638 in [[Rome]]) was a Lebanese Maronite bishop. On his initiative, he was the first clergyman to print of a book in an Arab country.

==Biography==

Sarkis Rizzi's family presented at this time three patriarchs to the [[Maronite Church]]: his two uncles Michel (1567 - 1581) and of the same name Sarkis (1581 - 1596) and his younger brother Joseph (October 3, 1596 - March 26, 1608). Youssef was [[abbot]] of the [[Monastery of Qozhaya]] in the [[Kadisha Valley]]&lt;ref&gt;[The Antonius monastery is one of the oldest institutions of the [[Maronite Church]]. The founding date is unknown; the first written reference is found in a marginal note in [[Garshuni]] in [[Rabbula Gospels]] of 1154.]&lt;/ref&gt; after the election of his uncle Sarkis patriarch and was in 1595 appointed bishop.

The young Sarkis belonged in 1584 to the first group of students at the Pontificio Collegio dei Maroniti in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[The Jesuits had already brought in 1579 two young Maronites to Rome and four more in 1581. In 1584 there were about 20 when [[Pope Gregory XIII]] created the Maronite College of Rome, which he put over the care of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] with the Bull Ferunt Humana on July 5, 1584]&lt;/ref&gt; Rizzi was in Rome when was ordained [[deacon]] and priest, and after that he returned to Lebanon in 1596.&lt;ref&gt;[The General of the Jesuits, [[Claudio Acquaviva]], announced his ordination and his speedy return in a letter to his uncle, the Maronite Patriarch, in a letter dated on July 14, 1596]&lt;/ref&gt; In September–October of this year he was at the Second Synod of Qannoubine. The Synod was passed through the papal legate Jerome Dandini. In this Synod, his brother Youssef was elected patriarch. He then took over his post as head of the Monastery of Qozhaya. In 1600 Rizzi was consecrated bishop by his brother (as Metropolitan of [[Maronite Catholic Archeparchy of Damascus|Damascus]]), but remained in the monastery.

In 1606 he was sent by the patriarch to Rome as head of a delegation to the new [[Pope Paul V]] to give him his congratulations. He left [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] in October 1606 and reached Rome on 19 April 1607.&lt;ref&gt;[With him was also Girgis ibn Maroun from [[Zgharta]], since 1611 envoyed of the later Emir until 1633 when [[Fakhr-al-Din II]] assumed his office. The papal throne and the Duke of [[Tuscany]] named him in 1614 bishop of [[Cyprus]] (he died on July 24, 1637).]&lt;/ref&gt; Patriarch Youssef died on March 26, 1608. Due to difficulties that the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] authorities made, the election of his successor John VIII Machlouf not take place before the beginning of 1609. The new Patriarch actually even had some time after Chouf flee. Rizzi then returned to Lebanon. Sometime between 1609-1610 he arrived there. But the new Patriarch initiated a policy of reaction against the family Rizzi, who had 40 years exercised the power in the Church. The monastery of Qozhaya was also returned to the bishop and Youssef Rizzi excommunicated.

Sarkis Rizzi returned then finally to Rome, which he reached sometime before 1621. There he worked on many out lative projects: The issue of the Maronite Breviariums in 1624,&lt;ref&gt;[Officium simplex septem dierum Hebdomadae ad usum Ecclesiæ Maronitarum, in Collegio Maronitarum, Rome, Etienne Paulin, 1624]&lt;/ref&gt; the pressure of the Syrian grammar of [[Abraham Ecchellensis]] in 1628,&lt;ref&gt;[Collegii Maronitarum alumni linguæ Syriacæ immersive Chaldaicæ perbrevis institutio ad ejusdem nationis studiosos adulescentes, Rome, Type. Sacr. Congregationis de Propaganda Fide, 1628]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Thesaurus of the Franciscan Orientalists Tommaso Obizzino (Tommaso da Novaria) in 1636.&lt;ref&gt;[Thesaurus Arabico-Syro-Latinus, Rome, Type. Sacr. Congregationis de Propaganda Fide, 1636]&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked on the project of Arabic Bible whose completion should continue until 1671.&lt;ref&gt;[Biblia Sacra Arabica, Sacrae Congregationis de propagnada Fide jussu Edita, ad usum Ecclesiarum orientalium; additis e Regione Bibliis Latinis Vulgatis, Rome, Type. Sacr. Congregationis de Propaganda Fide, 1671]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Psalter of Quzhaya==

His name is particularly associated with the publication of the Psalter of Qozhaya, an edition of the [[Book of Psalms|Psalms]] in [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and Garschuni (Arabic written in the Syriac alphabet). This was the first book printed in Lebanon and the entire region of the [[Levant]].&lt;ref&gt;[Catalog of Oriental Manuscripts of the [[Laurentian Library]] ([[Florence]]) in 1742 confirms [[Stefano Evodio Assemani]] that this pressure in Levant. 411 of the collection (n° 30 of its catalog), a Psalter in Garschuni, copied in 1528, was printed in the monastery of Qozhaya in 1585, upon the initiative of Sarkis Rizzi and Youssef Khater Assemani. However, most experts doubt the existence of this issue, of which there are no traces. Jerome Dandini, who was in 1596 papal legate in Lebanon, confirmed that there were no printing works in so far in the region. (Voyage au Mont-Liban, traduction française par [[Richard Simon (priest)|Richard Simon]], Paris, Louis Billaine, 1685, p.86; Reed. [[Holy Spirit University of Kaslik]], 2005).]&lt;/ref&gt; This pressure remained the only one for almost a century.

Previously, the only printed books that were in circulation in Lebanon were the catechisms in Garschuni and the Arabic version of the Professio fidei Tridentina which were also drafted in Garschuni. The Jesuit Giovanni Battista Eliano&lt;ref&gt;[Giovanni Battista Eliano (1530-1589) was a converted Jew and grandson of [[Elia Levita]], who had undertaken from 1578 to 1580 two mission trips to Lebanon.]&lt;/ref&gt; had brought them from Rome in 1580. Another book with Maronite prayers had been printed in 1584 in Rome and in the following years created more prints in various Italian cities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nasser Gemayel]], «Les imprimeries libanaises de Rome», dans Camille Aboussouan (dir.), Le Livre et le Liban jusqu'à 1900, UNESCO, 1982, S. 190-193.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Psalter of Quzhaya comprises 268 pages (without numbering eight, then 260 pages numbering in Syrian letters). The headers of the pages bear in red the Syrian tracks Ktobo d-mazmuré (Book of Psalms). There are 150 psalms and a canonical apocryphal, which obviously comes from the Syriac tradition, four biblical [[canticles]] and another of [[Ephrem the Syrian]] (only in Syriac). The texts are arranged on the sides in two columns, left and right in Syriac Garschuni. Since the Arabic text is longer, the characters have different sizes to obtain the parallelism. On the first page there is the signature of Sarkis (Sergius Risius Archiepiscopus Damascenus) with its coat of arms and the following information: "The revered hermitage of the Sacred Valley of Qozhaya in Mount Lebanon, work of the master Pasquale Eli and low Youssef ibn Amimeh de Karmsaddé called deacon, in 1610, of the Lord." On the third page, the preface to the reader finds, written in Garschuni of Sarkis Rizzi. On page 258 is the [[imprimatur]] by the Bishop of Zgharta, Girgis Ibn Amira (probably in revenge no mention of Patriarch John Makhlouf). The last two pages are taken from the [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]], which is written in the first person of Deacon Youssef ibn Amimeh, who explains that he is through his mother the nephew of the initiator Sarkis Rizzi.&lt;ref&gt;[This is also his maternal grandfather, Gabriel, the brother of the patriarch Michael, Sarkis, and Moussa, the father of the Patriarch and Bishop Youssef Sarkis. He was ordained in 1644 as Metropolitan of [[Maronite Catholic Archeparchy of Damascus|Damascus]].]&lt;/ref&gt; He wishes to thank all employees of the company. The date of signature is precise: November 10, 1610.

Sarkis was a master printer coming from Italy, and Pasquale Eli from [[Camerino]] who guided the work. But it is not known whether the Bishop during this year stayed even in Lebanon, or whether he was in Rome, and his nephew alone ran the company. Unknown is also the origin of the [[Sort (typesetting)|print types]] (two types in different sizes): they were also brought from Italy, or produced locally? They are known from no other issue. The filigree design speaks for the production in Italy.

The issue has long been little known. [[Gabriel Sionita]] asserts (Syrian-Latin, Paris, 1625) in his preface to his bilingual Psalter that he had manufactured the first printed edition of this text in Syriac. The patriarch [[Estephan El Douaihy]] (1630-1704) mentioned the work in any of his numerous writings on the community and culture of the Maronites (dans ses nombreux écrits sur la communauté et la culture Maronites, ne jamais la mentionne). However, it is certain that this pressure has taken place in 1610. In the example that in the Nuremberg Municipal Library has been preserved in 1611 two [[piastre]]s that were acquired by the Bishop of Zgharta by the scholar German Tobias Adami.&lt;ref&gt;[Tobias Adami (1581-1643), a pupil of [[Tommaso Campanella]], a member of the [[Fruitbearing Society]], which in 1611 made a trip to the Middle East.]&lt;/ref&gt;[[Leo Allatius]] invokes in his Apes urbanae, sive de viris illustribus (Rome, 1633) on Sarkis Rizzi and confirms the issue. However, the first bibliography, which mentions the issue is the Bibliotheca Sacra of [[Jacques Lelong]] in 1709.

Also known are a few examples: one each in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] (A-495); in the [[Sainte-Geneviève Library]] (Fol A58 Inv 62 Res.);&lt;ref&gt;[The two French copies were purchased in the 17th century, Sainte-Geneviève, Jean Fronteau, librarian, 1648-1662]&lt;/ref&gt; at the Nuremberg Library (Ms. Solg 21. 2); in the [[Herzog August Library]] in [[Wolfenbüttel]] (Bible-S 4 ° 227th); in Lebanon in the Bibliothèque orientale the [[Saint Joseph University]] (USJ-BO 26C2) and in the Bibliothèque centrale of the [[Holy Spirit University of Kaslik]], Kaslik (USEK Pat. 291).

==Heritage==

There is no information on the whereabouts of the printing materials after production of the book. There was another attempt to set up a printing works in Lebanon (1627) and apparently was also the one that had been set up in Monastery of Qozhaya has already been lost. When the [[Lebanese Maronite Order|OLM]]'s building was given back in 1708, there were no furnishings more and a printing house was set up again only at the beginning of the 19th century. After the one-time preparation of the printing of [[psalter]] in Quzhaya was only at the end of the 18th century into the Levant that was introduced again by the Melkite Patriarch Athanasius IV (1720-1724): he acquired a printing press from [[Bucharest]] and established in 1704 a printing house in [[Aleppo]]; some issues of biblical and liturgical texts appeared there from 1706 to 1711, before even this activity was canceled again. Only in 1733 was built permanently by a Melkite deacon, [[Abdallah Zakher]], a print shop in the monastery of [[Dhour El Choueir]].

[[File:Shroud of Charlemagne manufactured in Constantinople 814.jpg|thumb|Portion of the death shroud of [[Charlemagne]]. It represents a [[quadriga]] and was manufactured in [[Constantinople]].]]
'''Shroud''' usually refers to an item, such as a cloth, that covers or protects some other object. The term is most often used in reference to ''[[burial]] sheets'', '''mound shroud''', '''grave clothes''', '''winding-cloths''' or '''winding-sheets''', such as the famous [[Shroud of Turin]] or ''[[Tachrichim]]'' (burial shrouds) that [[Jews]] are dressed in for burial. Traditionally, mound shrouds are made of white [[cotton]], [[wool]] or [[linen]], though any material can be used so long as it is made of [[natural fibre]]. Intermixture of two or more such fibres is forbidden,&lt;ref&gt;Alfred J. Kolatch, ''The Jewish Book of Why'' (New York: Jonathan David Publishers, 1981), pp. 52-53&lt;/ref&gt; a proscription that ultimately derives from the [[Torah]], ''viz.'', [[Deuteronomy|Deut.]] 22:11.

A traditional Orthodox Jewish shroud consists of a tunic; a hood; pants that are extra-long and sewn shut at the bottom, so that separate foot coverings are not required; and a belt, which is tied in a knot shaped like the Hebrew letter ''shin'', mnemonic of one of God's names, Shaddai.  Early shrouds incorporated a cloth, the ''sudarium'', that covered the face, as depicted in traditional artistic representations of the entombed Jesus or His friend, Lazarus ([[Gospel of John|John]] 11, ''q.v.'').  An especially pious man may next be enwrapped in either his [[kittel]] or his [[tallit]], one tassel of which is defaced to render the garment ritually unfit, symbolizing the fact that the decedent is free from the stringent requirements of the 613 ''mitzvot'' (commandments). The shrouded body is wrapped in a winding sheet, termed a ''sovev'' in Hebrew (a cognate of ''svivon'', the spinning [[Hanukkah]] toy that is familiar under its Yiddish name, ''[[dreidel]]''), before being placed either in a plain coffin of soft wood (where required by governing health codes) or directly in the earth.  [[Croesus]]-rich or dirt-poor, every Orthodox Jew is dressed to face the Almighty on the same terms.

The [[Early Christian Church]] also strongly encouraged the use of winding-sheets, except for monarchs and bishops. The rich were wrapped in cerecloths, which are fine fabrics soaked or painted in wax to hold the fabric close to the flesh. An account of the opening of the coffin of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] says that the "innermost covering seems to have been a very fine linen cerecloth, dressed close to every part of the body". Their use was general until at least the Renaissance – clothes were very expensive, and they had the advantage that a good set of clothes was not lost to the family.
In Europe in the Middle Ages, coarse linen shrouds were used to bury most poor without a coffin. In poetry shrouds have been described as of sable, and they were later embroidered in black, becoming more elaborate and cut like shirts or shifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Design for Death|last=Jones|first=Barbara|publisher=Andre Deutsch Limited|year=1967|isbn=|location=London|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Piponnier and Perrine Mane; ''Dress in the Middle Ages''; p.112, Yale UP, 1997; {{ISBN|0-300-06906-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Orthodox Christians]] still use a burial shroud, usually decorated with a cross and the [[Trisagion]]. The special shroud that is used during the Orthodox [[Holy Week]] services is called an [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|Epitaphios]]. Some Catholics also use the burial shroud particularly the [[Eastern Catholics]] and traditionalist [[Roman Catholics]].

Muslims as well use burial shrouds that are made of white cotton or linen.  The [[Burying in Woollen Acts]] 1666-80 in England were meant to support the production of woollen cloth.

[[Seagrass]] bed sediment (soil) is typically anoxic, containing a reduced form of sulfur: [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S).  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is a phytotoxin that results from [[anaerobic digestion]], the [[decomposition]] of [[organic matter]] in the absence of oxygen.  However, seagrass can persist in this environment because of physiological adaptations, as well as functional adaptations of other organisms in the ecosystem.  For example, bivalves (clams) in the family [[Lucinidae]] host symbiotic bacteria that oxidize sulfides.  Lucinid bivalves' gills house the bacteria, and the siphon supplies the bacteria and surrounding [[pore water]] with oxygenated water from above the sediment.  Bacterial oxidation of the sulfides results in sulfates, reducing toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Lucinid clam influence on the biogeochemistry of the seagrass Thalassia testudinum sediments | author=L.K.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2007}}

'''Synergy''' is the creation of a whole that is greater than the simple sum of its parts.  The term ''synergy'' comes from the [[Attic Greek]] word συνεργία ''{{lang|el-Latn|synergia}}''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=synergy "synergy"]. ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt; from ''{{lang|el-Latn|synergos}}'', {{lang|el|[[wikt:συνεργός|συνεργός]]}}, meaning "working together".

==History==
The words "synergy" and "synergetic" have been used in the field of [[physiology]] since at least the middle of the 19th century:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
SYN'ERGY, ''Synergi'a'', ''Synenergi'a'', (F.) ''Synergie''; from ''συν'', 'with,' and ''εργον'', 'work.' A correlation or concourse of action between different organs in health; and, according to some, in disease.
:—Dunglison, Robley [https://books.google.com/books?id=jAm6AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA835 ''Medical Lexicon''] Blanchard and Lea, 1853
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In 1896, [[:fr:Henri Mazel|Henri Mazel]] applied the term "synergy" to social psychology by writing ''La synergie sociale'', in which he argued that Darwinian theory failed to account for "social synergy" or "social love", a collective evolutionary drive. The highest civilizations were the work not only of the elite but of the masses too; those masses must be led, however, because the crowd, a feminine and unconscious force, cannot distinguish between good and evil.&lt;ref&gt;Werth, Margaret [https://books.google.com/books?id=-gDaqOcUMhgC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=%22social+synergy%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22social%20synergy%22 ''The Joy of Life: The Idyllic in French Art'', circa 1900] University of California Press, 2002, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, [[Lester Frank Ward]] defined synergy as the universal constructive principle of nature:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I have characterized the social struggle as centrifugal and social solidarity as centripetal. Either alone is productive of evil consequences. Struggle is essentially destructive of the social order, while communism removes individual initiative. The one leads to disorder, the other to degeneracy. What is not seen—the truth that has no expounders—is that the wholesome, constructive movement consists in the properly ordered combination and interaction of both these principles. This is ''social synergy'', which is a form of cosmic synergy, the universal constructive principle of nature.
:—Ward, Lester F. [https://archive.org/stream/glimpsescosmos00wardgoog#page/n405/mode/1up/search/synergy ''Glimpses of the Cosmos'', volume VI (1897–1912)] G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1918, p. 358
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Descriptions and usages==
In the natural world, synergistic phenomena are ubiquitous, ranging from physics (for example, the different combinations of quarks that produce protons and neutrons) to chemistry (a popular example is water, a compound of hydrogen and oxygen), to the cooperative interactions among the genes in genomes, the division of labor in bacterial colonies, the synergies of scale in multi-cellular organisms, as well as the many different kinds of synergies produced by socially-organized groups, from honeybee colonies to wolf packs and human societies: compare [[stigmergy]], a mechanism of indirect coordination between agents or actions that results in the [[self-assembly]] of [[complex system]]s. Even the tools and technologies that are widespread in the natural world represent important sources of synergistic effects. The tools that enabled early [[hominin]]s to become systematic big-game hunters is a primordial human example.&lt;ref&gt;Peter A. Corning, ''Nature's Magic: Synergy in Evolution and the Fate of Humankind'', New York: Cambridge University Press 2003 {{ISBN|0-521-82547-4}}; Peter A. Corning, ''Holistic Darwinism: Synergy, Cybernetics and the Bioeconomics of Evolution'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press 2005 {{ISBN|0-226-11613-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the context of organizational behavior, following the view that a cohesive group is more than the sum of its parts, synergy is the ability of a group to outperform even its best individual member. These conclusions are derived from the studies conducted by Jay Hall on a number of laboratory-based group ranking and prediction tasks. He found that effective groups actively looked for the points in which they disagreed and in consequence encouraged conflicts amongst the participants in the early stages of the discussion. In contrast, the ineffective groups felt a need to establish a common view quickly, used simple decision making methods such as averaging, and focused on completing the task rather than on finding solutions they could agree on.&lt;ref&gt;David Buchanan &amp; Andrzej Huczynski: Organizational behavior, introductory text. Prentice Hall, pp 276, Third Edition 1997 {{ISBN|0-13-207259-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a technical context, its meaning is a construct or collection of different elements working together to produce results not obtainable by any of the elements alone. The elements, or parts, can include people, hardware, software, facilities, policies, documents: all things required to produce system-level results. The value added by the system as a whole, beyond that contributed independently by the parts, is created primarily by the relationship among the parts, that is, how they are interconnected. In essence, a system constitutes a set of interrelated components working together with a common objective: fulfilling some designated need.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Blanchard, System Engineering Management, pp 8, John Wiley 2004, {{ISBN|0-471-29176-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If used in a business application, synergy means that teamwork will produce an overall better result than if each person within the group were working toward the same goal individually. However, the concept of group [[cohesion (social policy)|cohesion]] needs to be considered. Group cohesion is that property that is inferred from the number and strength of mutual positive attitudes among members of the group. As the group becomes more cohesive, its functioning is affected in a number of ways. First, the interactions and communication between members increase. Common goals, interests and small size all contribute to this. In addition, group member satisfaction increases as the group provides friendship and support against outside threats.&lt;ref&gt;David Buchanan &amp; Andrzej Huczynski: Organizational behavior, introductory text, Prentice Hall, pp 275, Third Edition 1997 {{ISBN|0-13-207259-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are negative aspects of group cohesion that have an effect on group decision-making and hence on group effectiveness. There are two issues arising. The [[risky shift]] phenomenon is the tendency of a group to make decisions that are riskier than those that the group would have recommended individually. Group [[Polarization (politics)|Polarisation]] is when individuals in a group begin by taking a moderate stance on an issue regarding a common value and, after having discussed it, end up taking a more extreme stance.&lt;ref&gt;David Buchannan &amp; Andrzej Huczynski: Organizational behavior, introductory text. Prentice Hall, pp 280, Third Edition 1997 {{ISBN|0-13-207259-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second, potential negative consequence of group cohesion is group think. Group think is a mode of thinking that people engage in when they are deeply involved in cohesive group, when the members' striving for unanimity overrides their motivation to appraise realistically the alternative courses of action. Studying the events of several American policy "disasters" such as the failure to anticipate the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] (1941) and the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] fiasco (1961), Irving Janis argued that they were due to the cohesive nature of the committees that made the relevant decisions.&lt;ref&gt;David Buchanan &amp; Andrzej Huczynski: Organizational behavior, introductory text. Prentice Hall, pp 283, Third Edition 1997 {{ISBN|0-13-207259-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That decisions made by committees lead to failure in a simple system is noted by Dr. Chris Elliot. His case study looked at [[IEEE-488]], an international standard set by the leading US standards body; it led to a failure of small automation systems using the IEEE-488 standard (which codified a proprietary communications standard [[HP-IB]]). But the external devices used for communication were made by two different companies, and the incompatibility between the external devices led to a financial loss for the company. He argues that systems will be safe only if they are designed, not if they emerge by chance.&lt;ref&gt;:Dr Chris Elliot, System safety and Law, Proceedings of First International Conference on System Safety, Institution of Engineering and Technology, London,  pp 344-351(2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
   
The idea of a systemic approach is endorsed by the [[United Kingdom]] [[Health and Safety Executive]]. The successful performance of the health and safety management depends upon the analyzing the causes of incidents and accidents and learning correct lessons from them. The idea is that all events (not just those causing injuries) represent failures in control, and present an opportunity for learning and improvement.&lt;ref&gt;UK Health and Safety Executive, ''Successful health and safety management'', {{ISBN|978-0-7176-1276-5}},(1997)&lt;/ref&gt; UK Health and Safety Executive, ''Successful health and safety management'' (1997): this book describes the principles and management practices, which provide the basis of effective health and safety management. It sets out the issues that need to be addressed, and can be used for developing improvement programs, self-audit, or self-assessment. Its message is that organizations must manage health and safety with the same degree of expertise and to the same standards as other core business activities, if they are to effectively control risks and prevent harm to people.

The term synergy was refined by [[R. Buckminster Fuller]], who analyzed some of its implications more fully&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/s01/p0100.html SYNERGETICS Explorations in the Geometry of Thinking by R. Buckminster Fuller (online version)]&lt;/ref&gt; and coined the term [[Synergetics (Fuller)|synergetics]].&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, R. B., (1975), ''Synergetics: Explorations In The Geometry Of Thinking'', in collaboration with E. J. Applewhite. Introduction and contribution by Arthur L. Loeb. Macmillan Publishing Company, Inc., New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

* A dynamic state in which combined action is favored over the difference of individual component actions.
* Behavior of whole systems unpredicted by the behavior of their parts taken separately, known as [[emergent behavior]].
* The cooperative action of two or more stimuli (or drugs), resulting in a different or greater response than that of the individual stimuli.

==Biological sciences==
Synergy of various kinds has been advanced by [[Peter Corning]] as a causal agency that can explain the progressive evolution of complexity in living systems over the course of time. According to the Synergism Hypothesis, synergistic effects have been the drivers of cooperative relationships of all kinds and at all levels in living systems. The thesis, in a nutshell, is that synergistic effects have often provided functional advantages (economic benefits) in relation to survival and reproduction that have been favored by natural selection.  The cooperating parts, elements, or individuals become, in effect, functional “units” of selection in evolutionary change.&lt;ref&gt;Peter A. Corning, The Synergism Hypothesis: A Theory of Progressive Evolution, New York, McGraw Hill 1983 {{ISBN|0-07-013166-X}}; Peter A. Corning, Holistic Darwinism: Synergy, Cybernetics and the Bio economics of Evolution, Chicago, University of Chicago Press 2005 {{ISBN|0-226-11613-1}};[http://www.complexsystems.org/publications/pdf/synselforg.pdf Synergy and self-organization in the evolution of complex systems.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720103635/http://www.complexsystems.org/publications/pdf/synselforg.pdf |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, environmental systems may react in a non-linear way to perturbations, such as climate change, so that the outcome may be greater than the sum of the individual component alterations. Synergistic responses are a complicating factor in environmental modeling.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, N ''Environmental Unknowns'' (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pest synergy===
Pest synergy would occur in a [[biology|biological]] [[Host (biology)|host]] [[organism]] population, where, for example, the introduction of [[parasite]] A may cause 10% fatalities, and parasite B may also cause 10% loss. When both parasites are present, the losses would normally be expected to total less than 20%, yet, in some cases, losses are significantly greater. In such cases, it is said that the parasites in combination have a synergistic effect.

=== Drug synergy ===
Mechanisms that may be involved in the development of synergistic effects include:
*Effect on the same cellular system (e.g. two different [[antibiotics]] like a [[penicillin]] and an [[aminoglycoside]]; penicillins damage the cell wall of gram-positive [[bacteria]] and improve the penetration of aminoglycosides).&lt;ref&gt;K. D. Tripathi: ''Essentials of Medical Pharmacology G - Reference, Information and Interdisciplinary Subjects Series''. JP Medical Ltd, 2013, {{ISBN|9789350259375}}, page 698.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Prevention or delay of degradation in the body (e.g. the antibiotic [[Ciprofloxacin]] inhibits the metabolism of [[Theophylline]]).&lt;ref name="Tripathi931"&gt;K. D. Tripathi: ''Essentials of Medical Pharmacology G - Reference, Information and Interdisciplinary Subjects Series''. JP Medical Ltd, 2013, {{ISBN|9789350259375}}, page 931.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Slowdown of excretion (e.g. [[Probenecid]] delays the [[renal]] excretion of Penicillin and thus prolongs its effect).&lt;ref name="Tripathi931"/&gt;
*Anticounteractive action: for example, the effect of [[oxaliplatin]] and [[irinotecan]]. Oxaliplatin [[wikt:intercalation|intercalates]] DNA, thereby preventing the cell from replicating DNA. Irinotecan inhibits [[topoisomerase 1]], consequently the cytostatic effect is increased.&lt;ref name="Jia2009"&gt;Jia Jia et al: "Mechanisms of drug combinations: interaction and network perspectives."

===Toxicological synergy===
Toxicological synergy is of concern to the public and regulatory agencies because chemicals individually considered safe might pose unacceptable health or ecological risk in combination. Articles in scientific and lay journals include many definitions of chemical or toxicological synergy, often vague or in conflict with each other. Because toxic interactions are defined relative to the expectation under "no interaction", a determination of synergy (or antagonism) depends on what is meant by "no interaction".&lt;ref&gt;Hertzberg, R. C., and MacDonell, M. M. (2002). Synergy and other ineffective mixture risk definitions. Sci Total Environ 288, 31-42.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] has one of the more detailed and precise definitions of toxic interaction, designed to facilitate risk assessment.&lt;ref name="EPAMixRisk"&gt;[http://ofmpub.epa.gov/eims/eimscomm.getfile?p_download_id=4486], U.S. EPA (2000). Supplementary Guidance for Conducting Health Risk Assessment of Chemical Mixtures. Risk Assessment Forum, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; In their guidance documents, the no-interaction default assumption is dose addition, so synergy means a mixture response that exceeds that predicted from dose addition. The EPA emphasizes that synergy does not always make a mixture dangerous, nor does antagonism always make the mixture safe; each depends on the predicted risk under dose addition.

For example, a consequence of pesticide use is the risk of health effects. During the registration of [[pesticide]]s in the [[United States]] exhaustive tests are performed to discern health effects on humans at various exposure levels. A regulatory upper limit of presence in foods is then placed on this pesticide. As long as residues in the food stay below this regulatory level, health effects are deemed highly unlikely and the food is considered safe to consume.

However, in normal agricultural practice, it is rare to use only a single pesticide. During the production of a crop, several different materials may be used. Each of them has had determined a regulatory level at which they would be considered individually safe. In many cases, a commercial pesticide is itself a combination of several chemical agents, and thus the safe levels actually represent levels of the mixture. In contrast, a combination created by the end user, such as a farmer, has rarely been tested in that combination. The potential for synergy is then unknown or estimated from data on similar combinations.  This lack of information also applies to many of the chemical combinations to which humans are exposed, including residues in food, indoor air contaminants, and occupational exposures to chemicals. Some groups think that the rising rates of cancer, asthma, and other health problems may be caused by these combination exposures; others have alternative explanations. This question will likely be answered only after years of exposure by the population in general and research on chemical toxicity, usually performed on animals. Examples of pesticide synergists include [[Piperonyl butoxide]] and [[MGK 264]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/oppsrrd1/reevaluation/pyrethroids-pyrethrins.html Pyrethroids and Pyrethrins], U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, epa.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human synergy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}
Human synergy relates to  human interaction and teamwork. For example, say person A alone is too short to reach an [[apple]] on a [[tree]] and person B is too short as well. Once person B sits on the [[shoulder]]s of person A, they are tall enough to reach the apple. In this example, the product of their synergy would be one apple. Another case would be two [[politician]]s. If each is able to gather one million votes on their own, but together they were able to appeal to 2.5 million voters, their synergy would have produced 500,000 more votes than had they each worked independently. A [[song]] is also a good example of human synergy, taking more than one musical part and putting them together to create a song that has a much more dramatic effect than each of the parts when played individually.

A third form of human synergy is when one person is able to complete two separate tasks by doing one action, for example, if a person were asked by a [[teacher]] and his [[supervisor|boss]] at work to write an [[essay]] on how he could improve his work.  A more visual example of this synergy is a [[drummer]] using four separate [[rhythm]]s to create one [[drum]] beat.

Synergy usually arises when two persons with different complementary skills cooperate.  In business, cooperation of people with organizational and technical skills happens very often. In general, the most common reason why people cooperate is that it brings a synergy. On the other hand, people tend to specialize just to be able to form groups with high synergy (see also [[division of labor]] and [[teamwork]]).

Example: Two teams in System Administration working together to combine technical and organizational skills in order to better the client experience, thus creating synergy. Counter-examples can be found in books like [[The Mythical Man-Month]], in which the addition of additional team members is shown to have negative effects on productivity.

[[Organismic computing]] is an approach to improving group efficacy by increasing synergy in human groups via technological means.

When synergy occurs in the work place, the individuals involved get to work in a positive and supportive working environment.  When individuals get to work in environments such as these, the company reaps the benefits.  The authors of ''Creating the Best Workplace on Earth'' Rob Goffee and Gareth Jones, state that "highly engaged employees are, on average, 50% more likely to exceed expectations that the least-engaged workers.  And companies with highly engaged people outperform firms with the most disengaged folks- by 54% in employee retention, by 89% in customer satisfaction, and by fourfold in revenue growth (Goffee &amp; Jones, pg. 100)."  Also, those that are able to be open about their views on the company, and have confidence that they will be heard, are likely to be a more organized employee who helps his/ her fellow team members succeed.&lt;ref&gt;Goffee, R. &amp; Jones, G.  (2013).  Creating the best workplace on the earth.  Harvard Business Review, 99-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate synergy==
{{main|corporate synergy}}
[[Corporate synergy]] occurs when corporations interact congruently.  A corporate synergy refers to a financial benefit that a corporation
expects to realize when it merges with or acquires another corporation.  This type of synergy is a nearly ubiquitous feature of a corporate acquisition and is a negotiating point between the buyer and seller that impacts the final price both parties agree to. There are distinct types of corporate synergies, as follows.

===Marketing===
A marketing synergy refers to the use of information campaigns, studies, and scientific discovery or experimentation for research or development. This promotes the sale of products for varied use or off-market sales as well as development of marketing tools and in several cases exaggeration of effects. It is also often a meaningless buzzword used by corporate leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Synergy Myth: And Other Ailments Of Business Today |edition= |first1=Harold |last1=Geneen |first2=Brent |last2=Bowers |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-312-14724-2 |page=xii |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=3nNwQgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Beyond Political Correctness: Social Transformation in the United States |edition= |first1=Michael S. |last1=Cummings |publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers |year=2001 |isbn=978-1-58826-006-2 |page=92 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7mgAwXas5xIC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=7mgAwXas5xIC&amp;pg=PA92 Extract of page 92]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revenue===
A revenue synergy refers to the opportunity of a combined corporate entity to generate more revenue than its two predecessor stand-alone companies would be able to generate. For example, if company A sells product X through its sales force, company B sells product Y, and company A decides to buy company B then the new company could use each sales person to sell products X and Y, thereby increasing the revenue that each sales person generates for the company.

In media revenue, synergy is the promotion and sale of a product throughout the various subsidiaries of a media conglomerate, e.g. films, soundtracks, or video games.

===Financial===
Financial synergy gained by the combined firm is a result of number of benefits which flow to the entity as a consequence of acquisition and merger. These benefits may be:

====Cash slack====
This is when a firm having number of cash extensive projects acquires a firm which is cash-rich, thus enabling the new combined firm to enjoy the profits from investing the cash of one firm in the projects of the other.

====Debt capacity====
If two firms have no or little capacity to carry debt before individually, it is possible for them to join and gain the capacity to carry the debt through decreased gearing (leverage).  This creates value for the firm, as debt is thought to be a cheaper source of finance.

====Tax benefits====
It is possible for one firm to have unused tax benefits which might be offset against the profits of another after combination, thus resulting in less tax being paid. However this greatly depends on the tax law of the country.

===Management===
Synergy in management and in relation to teamwork refers to the combined effort of individuals as participants of the team.&lt;ref name="law2003"&gt;Lawford, G. R. (2003). Beyond success: Achieving synergy in teamwork. ''The Journal for Quality and Participation'', 26(3), p 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The condition that exists when the organization's parts interact to produce a joint effect that is greater than the sum of the parts acting alone. Positive or negative synergies can exist. In these cases, positive synergy has positive effects such as improved efficiency in operations, greater exploitation of opportunities, and improved utilization of resources. Negative synergy on the other hand has negative effects such as: reduced efficiency of operations, decrease in quality, underutilization of resources and disequilibrium with the external environment.

===Cost===
A cost synergy refers to the opportunity of a combined corporate entity to reduce or eliminate expenses associated with running a business. Cost synergies are realized by eliminating positions that are viewed as duplicate within the merged entity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costsynergy.asp Cost Synergy, ''investopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the headquarters office of one of the predecessor companies, certain executives, the human resources department, or other employees of the predecessor companies. This is related to the economic concept of [[Returns to scale|economies of scale]].

==Synergistic action in economy==
The synergistic action of the economic players lies within the economic phenomenon's profundity. The synergistic action gives different dimensions to competitiveness, strategy and network identity becoming an unconventional "weapon" which belongs to those who exploit the economic systems’ potential in depth.&lt;ref&gt;Stan Laura-Melinda, The Necessity to Exploit the Economic Network's Synergistic Potential, LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing, Saarbrücken, Germany, 2011, p. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synergistic determinants===
The synergistic gravity equation (SYNGEq), according to its complex “title”, represents a synthesis of the endogenous and exogenous factors which determine the private and non-private economic decision makers to call to actions of synergistic exploitation of the economic network in which they operate. That is to say, SYNGEq constitutes a big picture of the factors/motivations which determine the entrepreneurs to contour an active synergistic network. SYNGEq includes both factors which character is changing over time (such as the competitive conditions), as well as classics factors, such as the imperative of the access to resources of the collaboration and the quick answers. The synergistic gravity equation (SINGEq) comes to be represented by the formula:&lt;ref&gt;Stan Laura-Melinda, The Necessity to Exploit the Economic Network's Synergistic Potential, LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing, Saarbrücken, Germany, 2011, p. 33 and 37&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;center&gt;∑SYN.Act = ∑R-*I(CRed+COOP&lt;big&gt;+&lt;/big&gt;+A&lt;sup&gt;Unimit.&lt;/sup&gt;)*V(Cust.+Info.)*cc&lt;/center&gt;

where:
*∑SYN.Act = the sum of the synergistic actions adopted (by the economic actor)
*∑ R- = the amount of unpurchased but necessary resources
*ICRed = the imperative for cost reductions
*ICOOP&lt;big&gt;+&lt;/big&gt; = the imperative for deep cooperation (functional interdependence)
*IA&lt;sup&gt;Unimit.&lt;/sup&gt; = the imperative for purchasing unimitable competitive advantages (for the economic actor)
*VCust = the necessity of customer value in purchasing future profits and competitive advantages VInfo = the necessity of informational value in purchasing future profits and competitive advantages
*cc = the specific competitive conditions in which the economic actor operates

===Synergistic networks and systems===
The synergistic network represents an integrated part of the economic system which, through the coordination and control functions (of the undertaken economic actions), agrees synergies. The networks which promote synergistic actions can be divided in horizontal synergistic networks and vertical synergistic networks.&lt;ref&gt;Stan Laura-Melinda, The Necessity to Exploit the Economic Network's Synergistic Potential, LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing, Saarbrücken, Germany, 2011, p. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synergy effects===
The synergy effects are difficult (even impossible) to imitate by competitors and difficult to reproduce by their authors because these effects depend on the combination of factors with time-varying characteristics. The synergy effects are often called "synergistic benefits", representing the direct and implied result of the developed/adopted synergistic actions.&lt;ref&gt;Stan Laura-Melinda, The Necessity to Exploit the Economic Network's Synergistic Potential, LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing, Saarbrücken, Germany, 2011, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computers==
Synergy can also be defined as the combination of human strengths and computer strengths, such as [[advanced chess]]. Computers can process data much more quickly than humans, but lack the ability to respond meaningfully to arbitrary stimuli.

==Synergy in literature==
Etymologically, the "synergy" term was first used around 1600, deriving from the Greek word “synergos”, which means “to work together” or “to cooperate”. If during this period the synergy concept was mainly used in the theological field (describing “the cooperation of human effort with divine will”), in the 19th and 20th centuries, "synergy" was promoted in physics and biochemistry, being implemented in the study of the open economic systems only in the 1960 and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Stan Laura-Melinda, The Necessity to Exploit the Economic Network's Synergistic Potential, LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing, Saarbrücken, Germany, 2011, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] wrote an essay titled ''On Fairy Stores'', delivered at an Andrew Lang Lecture, and reprinted in his book, ''The Tolkien Reader'', published in 1966. In it, he made two references to synergy, although he did not use that term. He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Faerie cannot be caught in a net of words; for it is one of its qualities to be indescribable, though not imperceptible. It has many ingredients, but analysis will not necessarily discover the secret of the whole.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And more succinctly, in a footnote, about the "part of producing the web of an intricate story", he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is indeed easier to unravel a single ''thread'' &amp;mdash; an incident, a name, a motive &amp;mdash; than to trace the history of any ''picture'' defined by many threads. For with the picture in the tapestry a new element has come in: the picture is greater than, and not explained by, the sum of the component threads.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Synergy in the media==

The informational synergies which can be applied also in media involve a compression of transmission, access and use of information’s time, the flows, circuits and means of handling information being based on a complementary, integrated, transparent and coordinated use of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Stan Laura-Melinda, The Necessity to Exploit the Economic Network's Synergistic Potential, LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing, Saarbrücken, Germany, 2011, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

In media economics, synergy is the promotion and sale of a product (and all its versions) throughout the various subsidiaries of a media conglomerate,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Richard, Christopher R. Martin, and Bettina Fabos. Media &amp; Culture 5: an Introduction to Mass Communication. Fifth Edition 2007 Update ed. Bostin: Bedford St. Martins, 2007. 606.&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. films, soundtracks or video games. [[Walt Disney]] pioneered synergistic marketing techniques in the 1930s by granting dozens of firms the right to use his [[Mickey Mouse]] character in products and ads, and continued to market Disney media through licensing arrangements. These products can help advertise the film itself and thus help to increase the film's sales. For example, the [[Spider-Man in film|Spider-Man films]] had toys of webshooters and figures of the characters made, as well as posters and games.&lt;ref&gt;Media Synergy see Linden Dalecki's article in Northwestern's ''Journal of Integrated Marketing Communications'' (2008) {{cite web |url=http://jimc.medill.northwestern.edu/JIMCWebsite/2008/HollywoodMediaSynergy.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613230145/http://jimc.medill.northwestern.edu/JIMCWebsite/2008/HollywoodMediaSynergy.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The NBC sitcom [[30 Rock]] often shows the power of synergy, while also poking fun at the use of the term in the corporate world.&lt;ref&gt;30 Rock episode 3.09; Liz: "I hate those corporate things; a bunch of drunk people talking about 'synergy'." Jack: "First of all, never badmouth 'synergy'!"&lt;/ref&gt; There are also different forms of synergy in popular card games like [[Yu-Gi-Oh!]], [[Cardfight!! Vanguard]], and [[Future Card Buddyfight]].

== Information theory ==

When multiple sources of [[information theory|information]] taken together provide more information than the sum of the information provided by each source alone, there is said to be a synergy in the sources. This in contrast to the case in which the sources provide less information, in which case there is said to be a [[Redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]] in the sources.

'''Taisha Abelar''', born '''Maryann Simko''', is an American writer and [[anthropology|anthropologist]] who was an associate of [[Carlos Castaneda]].

==Biography==
Abelar met Castaneda when she was 19 years old and a student at [[University of California, Los Angeles]] where she eventually earned her Master’s degree and Ph.D. in Anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace (2003), p. 405&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, Castaneda purchased a compound on Pandora Avenue in Westwood, [[Los Angeles]], and soon after Abelar (she was still known as Maryann Simko at this time), along with [[Regine Thal]] and [[Kathleen Pohlman]], who would come to be known collectively as "the witches", moved in. In 1974, ''Samurai'' magazine published photos of Regine Thal doing karate exercises. In the article, Abelar is called "Anna Marie Carter".&lt;ref&gt;Wallace (2003), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

In keeping with Castaneda’s philosophy of "erasing personal history", the witches maintained a tight veil of secrecy. They used numerous aliases and generally did not allow themselves to be photographed. Not long after moving into Castaneda’s compound Maryann Simko changed her name to Taisha Abelar. Likewise, Regine Thal changed her name to [[Florinda Donner]] and Kathleen Pohlman hers to Carol Tiggs.

Abelar claimed to have been one of [[Don Juan Matus|Don Juan]]’s four students and says she spent a year in his “magical house” in Mexico. In 1992, her book ''The Sorcerer’s Crossing: A Woman’s Journey'', which documents the training she received from the female members of don Juan’s group, was published by [[Viking Books]].

Through the 1990s, Abelar and the other witches started giving workshops in [[Tensegrity (Castaneda)|Tensegrity]] for [[Cleargreen Incorporated]], a company formed by Castaneda for that purpose.

'''Tommy Tucker''' (died June 25, 1949) was a male [[Eastern gray squirrel]] who became a celebrity in the United States, touring the country wearing women's fashions while performing tricks, entertaining children, and selling [[war bonds]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A ''Washington Post'' columnist called him "the most famous squirrel ever to come from Washington."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/tommy-tucker-washingtons-most-famous-squirrel/2012/04/08/gIQAddnZ4S_story.html |title=Tommy Tucker, Washington’s most famous squirrel |last=Kelly |first=John |date=April 8, 2012 |website=The Washington Post |archive-url=https://archive.is/20161112055402/https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/tommy-tucker-washingtons-most-famous-squirrel/2012/04/08/gIQAddnZ4S_story.html |archive-date=2016-11-12 |access-date=2016-10-02 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== World War II ==
While origin stories vary, Tommy was adopted in 1942 by Zaidee Bullis and her husband Mark C. Bullis, who may have named him after the 18th-century nursery-rhyme character [[Little Tommy Tucker]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Zaidee dressed Tommy in women's clothing to avoid the tailoring around his bushy tail that a male wardrobe would entail.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Following World War{{nbsp}}II Tommy "married" a squirrel named Buzzy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1943 the Bullis family began taking Tommy on tour in their [[Packard]] automobile,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
accompanied by a bulldog said to have one or more gold teeth and often wearing a [[fez]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/tommy-tucker-eternitys-satin-doll-of-a-squirrel-is-at-last-located/2012/04/18/gIQAu5jeRT_story.html |title=Tommy Tucker: Eternity’s satin doll of a squirrel is at last located |last=Kelly |first=John |date=April 18, 2012 |website=The Washington Post |archive-url=https://archive.is/20161112055635/https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/tommy-tucker-eternitys-satin-doll-of-a-squirrel-is-at-last-located/2012/04/18/gIQAu5jeRT_story.html |archive-date=2016-11-12 |access-date=2016-10-02 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life ==

After the war, Tommy largely disappeared from headlines until 1948, when the Bullises were denied entry to California for several days when agricultural officials refused to recognize Tommy as a pet rather than a wild animal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At another point Tommy was barred from visiting Mexico.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Tommy died in the Bullises' trailer on June 25, 1949 while en route to one of the couple's "health and pleasure trips" to the [[Southwest United States]], ostensibly due to "a heart attack brought on by old age"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (The average lifespan of [[Eastern gray squirrel]]s in captivity is about twenty years.)

His body was [[taxidermy|stuffed]] and mounted "with his arms out so you could pull the clothes over him."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2005 Tommy's remains were offered to the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]], which however failed to show much interest.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He is on view in a display case at a law office in [[Prince George's County, Maryland]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''USS ''Gudgeon'' (SS-211)''', a [[Tambor class submarine|''Tambor'']]-class [[submarine]], was the first ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for the [[gudgeon (fish)|gudgeon]]. 

==Pre-war==
Her keel was laid down by the [[Mare Island Navy Yard]]. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 25 January 1941, sponsored by Mrs. Annie B. Pye, wife of Vice Admiral [[William S. Pye]], Commander Battleships, Battle Force and Commander Battle Force.  The boat was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 21 April 1941 with Lieutenant Commander [[List of military figures by nickname|Elton W. "Joe" Grenfell]] in command.  Her construction cost $6 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Submarine Launched from Mare Island|publisher=San Bernardino County Sun|date=26 Jan 1941|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[shakedown cruise|shakedown]] along the [[California]] coast, ''Gudgeon'' sailed north on 28 August, heading for [[Alaska]] via [[Seattle, Washington]]. On her northern jaunt the new submarine inspected [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak]], and [[Dutch Harbor]] for suitability as naval bases. Continuing to [[Hawaii]], she moored at the [[Pearl Harbor Naval Base|Pearl Harbor]] [[submarine base]] on 10 October 1941. Training exercises and local operations filled ''Gudgeon''’s time for the next two months.
During the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on 7 December she was at [[Lahaina Roads]] on special exercises, but returned to base immediately.

==World War II==
===First war patrol===

On 11 December, ''Gudgeon'' (commanded by [[Elton W. Grenfell|Elton W. "Joe" Grenfell]]) departed [[Pearl Harbor Naval Base|Pearl Harbor]] on the first American submarine war patrol of [[World War II]]. Her commanding officer was provided with explicit written orders to carry out [[unrestricted submarine warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;The orders were probably designed to prevent the Japanese from hanging him as a pirate, under the belief Article 22 of the [[London Naval Treaty]] prohibited his actions. See Holwitt, Joel I. ''"Execute Against Japan"'', Ph.D. dissertation, Ohio State University, 2005, p.295 &amp; ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gudgeon'' made her first contact on a target in Japanese Home Waters 31 December.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, Clay, Jr. ''Silent Victory'' (New York: Bantam, 1976), pp.107 &amp; 110.&lt;/ref&gt; When she returned 50 days later,&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p.901.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gudgeon'' had contributed two more impressive "firsts" to the Pacific submarine fleet. She was the first American submarine to patrol along the Japanese coast itself, as her area took her off [[Kyūshū]] in the home islands. On 27 January 1942, ''en route'' home, ''Gudgeon'' became the first [[United States Navy]] submarine to sink an enemy warship in [[World War II]]. ''Gudgeon'' fired three torpedoes, and [[Japanese submarine I-73|''I-73'']]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.combinedfleet.com/I-73.htm&lt;/ref&gt; was destroyed; though ''Gudgeon'' claimed only damage, the loss was confirmed by [[Station HYPO|HYPO]].&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p.118, names her ''I-173''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second and third patrols===

On her second war patrol, 22 February to 15 April 1942, ''Gudgeon'' scored two kills, first an unknown freighter on 26 March (not identified or confirmed by [[Joint Army–Navy Assessment Committee|JANAC]]), then sinking the 6526-ton ''Nissho Maru'' on 27 March in the [[East China Sea]] southeast of [[Geumodo Island|Kumun Island]].

She then checked into dry-dock for overhaul, but undocked three weeks early and readied for sea in a remarkable 40 hours to participate in the momentous [[Battle of Midway]].

Departing Pearl Harbor on 18 May, ''Gudgeon'' took station off [[Midway Atoll]] as part of the submarine screen which encircled the two giant fleets clashing there.  ''Gudgeon'' was prevented from offensive action by the confusion of battle, the possibility of mistaken identity, and poor staff work by Admiral [[Robert Henry English|Robert English]], &lt;small&gt;[[COMSUBPAC]]&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, ''Silent Victory'' (Bantam, 1976), pp.239 and 241&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to Pearl Harbor on 14 June.

===Fourth patrol===

Departing for her fourth patrol 11 July, ''Gudgeon'' sank the 4853-ton transport ''Naniwa Maru'' in a night submerged attack off [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] on 3 August, her only kill of the patrol. In her other attack of the fourth patrol USS Gudgeon carried out an aggressive attack on a four-ship convoy 17 August, torpedoing and damaging the Japanese tankers ''Shinkoku Maru'' (10020 BRT) and ''Nichiei Maru'' (10020 BRT) northwest of Truk before the patrol ended at [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]], [[Australia]], on 2 September.

===Fifth and sixth patrols===

Now a part of the Southwestern Pacific submarine forces, ''Gudgeon'' sank the 6783-ton ''Choko Maru'' west-northwest of Rabaul on 21 October during her fifth war patrol, 8 October to 1 December, and carried out a daring attack on a seven ship convoy on 11 November, torpedoing several ships but sinking none.

The submarine's sixth war patrol, from 27 December 1942 to 18 February 1943, was unsuccessful in terms of ships sunk, but she carried out two special missions. On 14 January 1943 ''Gudgeon'' successfully landed six men on [[Catmon Point]], [[Negros Island]], [[Western Visayas]], [[Philippines]], to carry out the vital guerrilla resistance movement there. Returning from her patrol area, ''Gudgeon'' was diverted to [[Timor Island]] on 9 February, and the following day rescued 28 men—Australian, English, Portuguese, and Filipino—for passage to [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]].

===Seventh and eighth patrols===

''Gudgeon''{{'}}s seventh war patrol, from 13 March into April 1943, netted her two more Japanese ships before she ran out of torpedoes and had to return to [[Australia]]. On 22 March she sank the 5434-ton transport ''Meigen Maru'' as well as seriously damaging two other ships in the Java Sea convoy some 30 miles north of [[Surabaya]], [[Java (island)|Java]], [[Netherlands East Indies]]. Five days later ''Gudgeon'' took on 9987-ton tanker [[Japanese oiler Tōhō Maru (1936)|''Tōhō Maru'']] in a night surface attack in the [[Makassar Strait]] punctuated by bursts of gunfire as the Japanese ships spotted and fired on the submarine. It took five torpedoes to sink ''Tōhō Maru'', and most of ''Gudgeon'''s crew enjoyed the rare treat of watching her slide into the depths. Another attack later the same day damaged the 1192-ton tanker ''Kyoei Maru''.

On her eighth war patrol, conducted as she sailed from [[Australia]] to Pearl Harbor on 15 April to 25 May 1943, ''Gudgeon'' chalked up three more kills. Her first came 28 April as she sank ''[[Kamakura Maru]]'', a former ocean liner, southwest of [[Pucio Point]], [[Panay]] (now Poblacion, Libertad, Antique), Philippines. The 17,526-ton transport was the largest Japanese transport, and one of the largest enemy ships sunk by an American submarine. Special operations interrupted ''Gudgeon'''s patrol as she landed six trained guerrilla fighters and three tons of equipment for the guerrilla movement on Panay on 30 April.

After sinking the 500-ton trawler ''Naku Maru'' with her deck guns west of Panay 4 May, ''Gudgeon'' battle-surfaced again that same day and left a coastal steamer burning and settling. Eight days later, on 12 May, she torpedoed and sank the 5861-ton freighter ''Sumatra Maru'' off [[Bulusan]], [[Luzon]], Philippines. Returning to Pearl Harbor, the veteran submarine was sent to [[San Francisco, California]], for badly needed overhaul, her first since commissioning two years earlier.

===Ninth and tenth patrols===

A refreshed sub and crew departed Pearl Harbor for their ninth war patrol 1 September 1943 in the [[Mariana Islands]] area. Before returning to [[Midway Island]] on 6 October with all [[torpedo]]es expended, ''Gudgeon'' had sunk the 3158-ton ''Taian Maru'', torpedoed and damaged the 3266-ton auxiliary gunboat ''Santo Maru'' north of [[Saipan]], as well as seriously damaging several other ships.

Heading along the [[China]] coast for her tenth war patrol, form 31 October to 11 December, ''Gudgeon'' chalked up two more marus. Early in the morning of 23 November she spotted a convoy of four ships in the East China Sea some 70 miles north of [[Zhoushan Island|Shusan Island]] and closed for attack. ''Gudgeon'' fired a spread of six torpedoes with gratifying results. The 870-ton  [[Japanese frigate Wakamiya|frigate ''Wakamiya'']],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.combinedfleet.com/Wakamiya_t.htm&lt;/ref&gt; hit by one torpedo, broke in two, sinking almost immediately. The two tankers in the convoy, the 5106-ton ''Ichiyo Maru'' and the 8469-ton ''Goyo Maru'', were also hit but managed to escape. ''Gudgeon'' closed in to finish off the 6783-ton troop transport ''Nekka Maru''.

===Eleventh patrol===

''Gudgeon'''s 11th war patrol saw a few successful sinkings of Japanese vessels, the first on 11 February. Before this sinking the submarine had a spell of bad luck where, on 2 February 1944, she had sighted a damaged [[aircraft carrier]] with two escorts. ''Gudgeon'' had closed for attack, but the escorts spotted her and attacked. A down-the-throat shot with four torpedoes temporarily discouraged the destroyers and allowed ''Gudgeon'' to seek deep water and safety, but when she surfaced the Japanese men-of-war were gone. Later in the same patrol ''Gudgeon'' was forced to try another down-the-throat shot at an enemy escort, but no hits. Success came only on 11 February. This date saw her torpedoing and sinking the already damaged (by [[Chinese military|Chinese]] air attack) 3091-ton [[merchant]] ''Satsuma Maru'' off [[Wenchow]], China. On 17 February ''Gudgeon'' sank a Japanese sampan with gunfire in the East China Sea, another sampan being damaged in the attack. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 5 March 1944.

===Twelfth path and loss===

''Gudgeon'' sailed for her 12th war patrol on 4 April 1944. The [[submarine]] stopped off for fuel at [[Johnston Island]] on 7 April, and was never seen or heard from again. On 7 June 1944, ''Gudgeon'' was officially declared overdue and presumed lost. Uboat.net claims ''Gudgeon'' was sunk 18 April 1944 at a known location by the Japanese southeast of [[Iwo Jima]].&lt;ref&gt;http://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/2923.html&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources say the submarine was more likely to have sunk by attack near the [[Maug Islands]].

For more detailed and original information about ''Gudgeon''{{'}}s likely sinking on 18 April 1944, see ''Find 'Em Chase 'Em Sink 'Em: The Mysterious Loss of the WW II Submarine USS Gudgeon'' and other "Ostlund" references below.

===Tally and honors===
During her three-year career, ''Gudgeon'' scored 14 confirmed kills of a total of well over 71,372&amp;nbsp;tons sunk, placing her 15th on the [[List of most successful American submarines in World War II|honor roll of American submarines]].

For her first seven war patrols ''Gudgeon'' received the [[Presidential Unit Citation (US)|Presidential Unit Citation]]. She earned 11 [[battle star]]s for [[World War II]] service.

Von Brunn was a [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] and [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust denier]].

==Background==
The Holocaust Museum has been a target for [[antisemitism|antisemites]] and [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]] since it was established in 1993. In 2002, federal prosecutors said two [[2002 white supremacist terror plot|white supremacists plotted]] to blow up the museum with a [[ANFO|fertilizer bomb]], as was used to [[Oklahoma City bombing|blow up a federal building]] in [[Oklahoma]] in 1995.&lt;ref name=2002plot/&gt;

===Immediate aftermath===
[[File:Stephen Tyrone Johns.JPG|thumb|left|95px|A sign honoring Stephen Tyrone Johns, the Special Police Officer shot and killed during the shooting, located in the museum's lobby.]]
''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that "if it weren't for the quick response of the private guards on duty, more people could have been killed or wounded." [[List of mayors of Washington, D.C.|Mayor]] [[Adrian Fenty]] stated that the officers' efforts "to bring this gunman down so quickly ... saved the lives of countless people... This could have been much, much worse."&lt;ref name=fenty&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/11/AR2009061103848_pf.html|title=Fast Action By Guards Saved Lives, Officials Say|last=Davenport|first=Christian|date=2009-06-12|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=2009-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside, the museum was crowded with visiting schoolchildren.&lt;ref name=wjla/&gt; Museum officials said that "the entire incident unfolded in approximately two minutes."&lt;ref name=foxnews&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/06/10/gunman-opens-inside-holocaust-museum-kills-security-guard/|title=Gunman Opens Fire Inside Holocaust Museum, Kills Security Guard|date=June 10, 2009|publisher=Fox News|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527083145/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/06/10/gunman-opens-inside-holocaust-museum-kills-security-guard/|archivedate=May 27, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the shooting, the nearby [[U.S. Department of Agriculture Administration Building]], [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]], and the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]]'s [[Sidney Yates Building|Sidney R. Yates Federal Building]] were closed.&lt;ref name=kpcc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scpr.org/blogs/kitty-felde/2009/06/11/bad-day-museum/|title=A Bad Day at the Museum|last=Felde|first=Kitty|date=June 11, 2009|publisher=[[Southern California Public Radio]]|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603235527/http://www.scpr.org/blogs/kitty-felde/2009/06/11/bad-day-museum/|archivedate=June 3, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portions of 14th Street and [[Independence Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Independence Avenue]] in the [[Southwest, Washington, D.C.|Southwest]] [[Quadrants of Washington, D.C.|quadrant]] were closed until later in the night.&lt;ref name=closure&gt;{{cite news|title=Street Closures Affiliated with Holocaust Museum Shooting|url=http://dcist.com/2009/06/street_closures_affiliated_with_hol.php|last=Mathis|first=Sommer|date=2009-06-10|publisher=[[Gothamist|DCist]]|accessdate=2009-06-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614234429/http://dcist.com/2009/06/street_closures_affiliated_with_hol.php|archivedate=2009-06-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car driven by von Brunn was found [[Double parking|double parked]] in front of the museum and tested for explosives.&lt;ref name='APGuard-dies'&gt;{{cite news |title=Guard dies after Holocaust museum shooting |date=2009-06-11 |publisher=MSNBC |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31208188/ |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=2009-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police said they found a notebook on von Brunn that contained a list of District locations, including the [[Washington National Cathedral]]; they dispatched [[Bomb disposal|bomb squads]] to at least 10 sites.&lt;ref name=baltimore&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nation/bal-te.shooting11jun11,0,2162870.story|title=Maryland man held in Holocaust museum attack|author=Meyer, Josh|author3=Oliphant, James|author2=Zajaz, Andrew |date=2009-06-11|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|accessdate=2009-06-11}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notebook also contained this passage, signed by von Brunn: "You want my weapons—this is how you'll get them.

The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|1st Amendment]] is abrogated henceforth."&lt;ref name=CriminalCharges /&gt;

The FBI and Washington, D.C. police chief [[Cathy L. Lanier]] said that it appeared von Brunn was acting alone at the time of the shooting, and the FBI said it had no knowledge of any threat against the museum.&lt;ref name=WTOP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtopnews.com/?nid=25&amp;sid=1693510|title=Gunman, guards exchange fire in D.C.

===Possible motives===
Several news agencies have noted the timing of the June 10 shooting; it came shortly after Obama's June 5 visit to and speech at the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]],&lt;ref name=allheadlinenews&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7015471394|title=Less Than A Week After Obama's Buchenwald Visit, House Passes Resolution Condemning Holocaust Shooting|last=Alingod|first=Kris|date=2009-06-12|publisher=All Headline News|accessdate=2009-06-17}}{{dead link|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "President Obama’s recent visit to the Buchenwald Concentration Camp, in [[Germany]], may have set off the shooter."&lt;ref name=scoop&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0906/S00175.htm|title=Shooting in the Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC|last=Lawn|first=Connie|date=2009-06-17|publisher=[[Scoop (news website)|Scoop]]|accessdate=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his website, von Brunn stated that his conviction in the 1980s was by "a [[Negro]] jury, Jew/Negro [[Attorney at law (United States)|attorneys]]" and that he was "sentenced to prison for eleven years by a Jew judge." A [[Court of Appeals]] denied his appeal.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

==Victim==
'''Special Police Officer Stephen Tyrone Johns''' (October 4, 1969 – June 10, 2009), a [[Temple Hills, Maryland]] native, was an employee of [[Wackenhut]] who was, at the time of the shooting, stationed at the door of the museum when von Brunn entered with a .22 caliber long rifle and shot him. He later died at the George Washington University Hospital. His funeral was held on June 19, 2009 at Ebenezer AME Church in Fort Washington, Maryland, with 2,000 attendees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/19/AR2009061900532.html|title=Grieving for 'Another Victim of an Evil ...

Johns was married to Zakiah Johns (since May 2008) with a son, Stephen Johns, Jr., and two stepsons, Jeffrey Pollard and Tysean Lawson-Bey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSob=c&amp;GSvcid=44739&amp;GRid=38161056&amp;|title=Stephen Tyrone Johns (1970–2009)|publisher=[[Find a Grave]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Jewish Committee]] established a memorial fund for the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/2009/06/11/news-opinion/the-telegraph/ajc-sets-up-fund-for-family-of-officer-johns|title=AJC sets up fund for family of Officer Johns |author=Eric Fingerhut|agency=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]|date=June 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James W. von Brunn died in prison while awaiting trial on January 6, 2010.&lt;ref name="WilberDeath"/&gt; He was in poor health and suffered from congestive heart failure and sepsis.&lt;ref name="WilberDeath"/&gt;

Following his death, the ''Washington Post'' notes: "His guilt was never in serious doubt -- the shooting was witnessed by dozens of people, it was captured on surveillance video and the assailant was carted away in an ambulance -- but some had hoped to glean some insights into von Brunn's psyche during the court process. Many, including Johns's relatives, remain shocked that anyone could be filled with so much hatred that he would shoot a helpful security guard at a museum that serves as a memorial to the slaughter of millions of people."&lt;ref name="WilberDeath"/&gt;

==Witnesses and events at the museum==
Present at the museum during the shooting was former [[United States Secretary of Defense]] [[William Cohen]], awaiting his wife [[Janet Langhart]]; the two were at the museum for the premiere of Langhart's one-act play, ''[[Anne and Emmett]]''. The play imagines a conversation between two teenagers, [[Nazi]] victim [[Anne Frank]] and [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] victim [[Emmett Till]]. Her play was to be presented in honor of the eightieth anniversary of Anne Frank's birth.&lt;ref name=cohen&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/religion/post/2009/06/67959221/1|author=Grossman, Cathy Lynn|title=Tragedy at the Holocaust museum and giving voice to the slain|date=2009-06-10|publisher=''USA Today''|accessdate=2009-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
[[Image:Holocaust Museum flag at half-staff.jpg|thumb|upright|The day after the shooting, the Holocaust Museum's flag flew at half-staff in memory of the murdered guard, Stephen Tyrone Johns.]]
The [[Embassy of Israel in Washington, D.C.|Israeli embassy in Washington]] condemned the attack. [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]] said, "This outrageous act reminds us that we must remain vigilant against anti-Semitism and prejudice in all its forms."&lt;ref name=whitehouse&gt;{{cite news|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2009/06/10/holocaust-museum-shooting|title=On the Holocaust Museum Shooting|date=2009-06-10|work=[[whitehouse.gov]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcnews&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8094076.stm|title=US Holocaust museum guard killed|date=June 11, 2009|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], [[Anti-Defamation League]], and FBI stated they had been monitoring von Brunn's Internet postings, but were unable to take action because his comments had not crossed the line from [[Freedom of speech in the United States|free speech]] into illegal threats or incitement.&lt;ref name=latimesmotive&gt;{{cite news|title=Investigators in Holocaust museum shooting continue to look for clues|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-holocaust-shooting12-2009jun12,0,7406829.story|last=Meyer|first=Josh|date=June 12, 2009|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=poverty&gt;{{cite news|title=Southern Poverty Law Center Had Monitored Museum Shooting Suspect|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/southern_poverty_law_center_had_monitored_holocaust_shooting_suspect/|last=Weiss|first=Debra Cassens|date=June 11, 2009|magazine=ABA Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 11, 2009, the [[Jewish Community Relations Council]] of Greater Washington and the [[InterFaith Conference of Metropolitan Washington]] led a prayer [[vigil]] which took place in front of the museum to honor Stephen Johns, the slain officer.&lt;ref name=vigil&gt;{{cite news|title=Holocaust Museum Shooting Vigil Planned for 2 p.m.|url=http://dcist.com/2009/06/holocaust_vigil_planned_for_2_pm.php|last=Mathis|first=Sommer|date=June 11, 2009|publisher=DCist|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614092511/http://dcist.com/2009/06/holocaust_vigil_planned_for_2_pm.php|archivedate=June 14, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 100 people attended the event, including officials from the Israeli and [[Embassy of Germany in Washington, D.C.|German embassies]].&lt;ref name=washtimes&gt;{{cite news|title=Tourists shocked, but carrying on|url=http://washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jun/12/tourists-shocked-but-try-to-carry-on/|last=Giaimo|first=Melissa|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=June 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]] condemned the attack as well.&lt;ref name="baltimore"/&gt; When the museum reopened on June 12, 2009, Director Sara Bloomfield said attendance was normal or even higher than usual. Many visitors said their attendance was a statement against hate and intolerance. A 17-year-old girl who was in the museum the day of the shooting stated, "It's important to come back, because if you don't, they win. It's a form of terrorism."&lt;ref name=reopening&gt;{{cite news|title=Stepping Up to Defy Intolerance|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2009/06/11/ST2009061101157.html?sid=ST2009061101157|last=Davenport|first=Christian|date=June 11, 2009|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] Internet forum [[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]], some users criticized von Brunn's actions, saying they hurt the forum's cause. Others supported him in threads that were later removed.&lt;ref name=editor&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003982248|title=What the Media Missed in Museum Shooting: Far-Right Reaction|last=Mitchell|first=Greg|date=June 10, 2009|magazine=[[Editor &amp; Publisher]]|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617050552/http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003982248|archivedate=June 17, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zeuxis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|zj|uː|k|s|ɪ|s}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ζεῦξις}})&lt;ref name="Smith1880"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Smith|title=A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology: Oarses-Zygia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f-5WAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1325|year=1880|publisher=J. Murray|pages=1325}}&lt;/ref&gt; (of [[Heraclea Lucania|Heraclea]]) was a [[Painting|painter]] who flourished during the 5th century BC.

==Life and work==
Zeuxis was an innovative Greek painter. Although his paintings have not survived, historical records state they were known for their realism, small scale, novel subject matter, and independent format. His technique created volumetric illusion through manipulating light and shadow, a change from the usual method of filling in shapes with flat color. Preferring small scale panels to murals, Zeuxis also introduced genre subjects (such as still life) into painting. He contributed to the composite method of composition, and may have originated an approach to, and thus influenced the concept of the ideal form of the nude, as described by art historian [[Kenneth Clark]]. As the story goes, Zeuxis could not find a woman beautiful enough to pose as Helen, the most beautiful woman in the world, so he selected the finest features of five different models to create a composite image of ideal beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Elizabeth |last=Mansfield |year=2007 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0aCTfkIEPpMC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=Zeuxis+Aphrodite+models&amp;source=web&amp;ots=OyvI5j0lho&amp;sig=UAHQC_TkVHUz0ybdSdN49wRDEfE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ckWUSYiOM8aO-gaOn_WKCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result |title=Too beautiful to picture: Zeuxis, myth, and mimesis |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |isbn= 0-8166-4749-6}}  (see also: [[mimesis]])&lt;/ref&gt; {{Ancient Greek painters}}

Zeuxis was born in Heraclea in 464 BC, probably [[Heraclea Lucania]], in the present-day region of [[Basilicata]] in the southeastern "boot" of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chilvers|first=Ian|chapter=Zeuxis|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists|year=2003|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O3-Zeuxis.html|accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He may have studied with Demophilus of Himera (Sicily), or with Neseus of Thasos (an island in the northern Aegean Sea), and/or with the Greek painter Appollodorus. Records cite his notable works as ''Helen'', ''Zeus Enthroned'' and ''The Infant Hercules Strangling the Serpents''. He also painted an assembly of gods, Eros crowned with roses, Alcmene, Menelaus, an athlete, Pan, Marsyas chained, and an old woman. [[Archelaus I of Macedon]] employed Zeuxis to decorate the palace of his new capital [[Pella]] with a picture of [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Greek world, 479-323 BC,'' By Simon Hornblower, Page 95 {{ISBN|0-415-15344-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of his works went to [[Rome]] and to [[Byzantium]], but disappeared during the time of [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].

Zeuxis is said to have died laughing at the humorous way he painted the goddess [[Aphrodite]], after the old woman who commissioned it insisted on modeling for the portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Bark, Julianna (2007–2008). "The Spectacular Self: Jean-Etienne Liotard’s Self-Portrait Laughing".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting contest==
According to the ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]], Zeuxis and his contemporary [[Parrhasius (painter)|Parrhasius]] (of [[Ephesus]] and later [[Athens]]) staged a contest to determine the greater artist. When Zeuxis unveiled his painting of grapes, they appeared so real that birds flew down to peck at them. But when Parrhasius, whose painting was concealed behind a curtain, asked Zeuxis to pull aside that curtain, the curtain itself turned out to be a painted illusion. Parrhasius won, and Zeuxis said, "I have deceived the birds, but Parrhasius has deceived Zeuxis."  This story was commonly referred to in 18th- and 19th-century art theory to promote spatial illusion in painting. A similar anecdote says that Zeuxis once drew a boy holding grapes, and when birds, once again, tried to peck them, he was extremely displeased, stating that he must have painted the boy with less skill, since the birds would have feared to approach otherwise.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2379">'''`Abd ar-Rahman ibn Muhammad''' (died 16 June 1825) was the Emir of [[Harar]] (1821 - 1825). 

On the death of his brother, Emir [[Ahmad II ibn Muhammad]], `Abd ar-Rahman and his other brother [[`Abd al-Karim ibn Muhammad|`Abd al-Karim]] quarreled over who would succeed, and `Abd ar-Rahman gained the throne first with the help of the [[Babille Oromo]] who dwelled to the east of Harar. However, while returning from an unsuccessful campaign to extract tribute from the [[Ala Oromo]] in 1825, he was betrayed to these people and `Abd al-Karim made himself Emir. Abd al-Rahman appealed for help from his Babille allies, who helped him resist his deposition. In the end, `Abd ar-Rahman was deposed and forty villages are listed as having been destroyed by the Oromo to the north, west and south of harar, as well as in Babille country during this civil war.&lt;ref name=Caulk-377&gt;R. A. Caulk, "Harar Town and Its Neighbours in the Nineteenth Century", ''Journal of African History'', 18 (1977), p. 377&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Richard F. Burton]], `Abd al-Karim had recruited 60 or 70 Arab matchlockmen, under one Haydar Assal the Auliki, to fight against the Oromo. The mercenaries ran out of ammunition, and losing twenty of their number retired to Harar. The Oromo captured Abd al-Karim and Abd Ar-Rahman, seized the throne and with the aid of the inhabitants started to murder the Arab mercenaries. The mercenaries, however, defended themselves and would have restored Abd al-Rahman as Emir, had Abd ar-Rahman not declined their offer; the Arab mercenaries then drew their pay and marched off to [[Zeila]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Burton, ''First Footsteps in East Africa'', 1856; edited with an introduction and additional chapters by Gordon Waterfield (New York: Praeger, 1966), p. 189, note&lt;/ref&gt; R.A. Caulk explains that this was a garbled version of the fraternal battle for the throne.&lt;ref name=Caulk-377/&gt;

One source states that he had one daughter, Guisti Fatima, who married his eventual successor [[Abu Bakr II ibn `Abd al-Munan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalark.net/Ethiopia/harrar.htm Ethiopia: Adal &amp; Harar], Royal Ark genealogies (accessed 6 April 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
