== History ==
In September 2006, there was an outbreak of [[food-borne illness]] caused by ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (''E. coli'') bacteria found in uncooked [[spinach]]&lt;ref name="fda14"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2006/ucm108731.htm |title=FDA Warning on Serious Foodborne E.coli O157:H7 Outbreak |date=September 14, 2006 |accessdate=November 23, 2009 |work=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v6kxay5k?url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2006/ucm108731.htm |archivedate=December 20, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 26 U.S. states.&lt;ref name="cdc" /&gt;

By October 6, 2006 199 people had been infected, including three people who died and 31 who suffered a type of kidney failure called [[hemolytic uremic syndrome]]&lt;ref name="cdc" /&gt;
after eating spinach contaminated with the [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|''E. coli'' O157:H7]], a potentially deadly bacterium that causes bloody [[diarrhea]] and dehydration.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/articlenews.aspx?type=scienceNews&amp;storyID=2006-09-17T022232Z_01_N14336072_RTRIDST_0_SCIENCE-ECOLI-DC.XML&amp;pageNumber=1&amp;imageid=∩=&amp;sz=13&amp;WTModLoc=NewsArt-C1-ArticlePage1|title=U.S. expands warning to cover all fresh spinach|date=September 17, 2006|publisher=Reuters|access-date=September 18, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305050012/http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/articlenews.aspx?type=scienceNews|archive-date=March 5, 2007|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strain is more potent than in any other food poisoning scares. Federal health officials said half of those reported sick have been hospitalized, compared to 25 to 30 percent in past outbreaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wfsb.com/health/9894017/detail.html |title=E. coli On Spinach May Have Been Extra Potent |date=September 20, 2006 |work=[[WFSB]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v6nfLyjU?url=http://www.wfsb.com/health/9894017/detail.html |archivedate=December 20, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) called for bagged fresh spinach to be removed from shelves and warned people not to eat any kind of fresh spinach or fresh spinach-containing products.&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fda17"/&gt; The FDA has also speculated that washing the spinach is insufficient to sanitize it because the bacteria is systemic, meaning that it is not just on the outside of the spinach, but that it has been absorbed through the [[root]]s and is now inside the spinach.  This hypothesis has since been deemed only hypothetical as there is no evidence that this can happen in spinach. The FDA has since reduced its warning to certain brands with specific dates.

The [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]] has advised consumers not to eat fresh spinach from the U.S., including bagged, loose in bulk or in salad blends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/corpaffr/recarapp/2006/20060918e.shtml|title=Expanded health hazad alert.

== Cause==
[[File:Angus cattle 5.jpg|thumb|right|'''Angus Cattle'''&lt;br&gt;The probable origin of the first outbreak was an Angus cattle ranch that had leased land to a spinach grower.]]
&lt;!-- 6/5/2011 - replaced copyrighted image with PD image from USGOV-USDA --&gt;

The outbreak was traced to organic [[Plastic shopping bag|bagged]] fresh [[spinach]]—sold as conventional produce—grown on a {{convert|50|acre|m2|adj=on}} farm in San Benito County, California. Investigators with the [[Centers for Disease Control]] initially speculated that the dangerous strain of bacteria, [[E. coli O157:H7|''E. coli'' O157:H7]], originated from irrigation water contaminated with cattle feces or from grazing [[deer]].&lt;ref&gt;

A follow-up report by the CDC&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;
{{cite news|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/archive/2007/March/24/local/stories/12local.htm |title=Inside the CDC's report on the deadly E. coli spinach outbreak |date=March 24, 2007 |publisher=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]] |accessdate=6 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930203523/http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/archive/2007/March/24/local/stories/12local.htm |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a joint report by the California Department of Health Services (CDHS) and U.S. FDA&lt;ref name="Raine"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17755937/|title=Source of tainted spinach finally pinpointed|date=March 23, 2007|publisher=MSNBC| accessdate= 6 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that the probable source of the outbreak was Paicines Ranch, an Angus cattle ranch that had leased land to spinach grower Mission Organics. The report found 26 samples of ''E. coli'' "indistinguishable from the outbreak strain" in water and cattle manure on the San Benito County ranch, some within a mile from the tainted spinach fields. Although officials could not definitively say how the spinach became contaminated, both reports named the presence of wild pigs on the ranch and the proximity of surface waterways to irrigation wells as "potential environmental risk factors."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The reports also noted that flaws in the spinach producer's transportation and processing systems could have further spread contamination. Paicines Ranch is not under investigation for its alleged role in the outbreak.

Soon after the reports were released, California's farm industry announced that it will adopt a set of "good agricultural practices" to reduce the risk of ''E. coli'' contamination for leafy green vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/archive/2007/March/24/local/stories/13local.htm|title=Tainted spinach linked to Paicines Ranch: Officials say San Juan Bautista plant though failed to follow its own safety procedures|date=March 24, 2007|publisher=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930201158/http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/archive/2007/March/24/local/stories/13local.htm |archivedate = September 30, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those participating in the voluntary program will be eligible for product seal of approval.

In California, where three-quarters of all domestically grown spinach is harvested, farmers could face up to $74 million in losses due to the ''E. coli'' outbreak. In 2005, the spinach crop in California was valued at $258.3 million, and each acre lost amounts to a roughly $3,500 loss for the farmer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15095551/ October 2, 2006 and in October 4, 2006 AP story reported on MSNBC.com] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5v6niujXD?url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15095551/ |date=December 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pulsenet|PulseNet system]], part of the Association of Public Health Laboratories and coordinated by CDC, detected clusters of infection in two states, Oregon and Wisconsin, which initiated investigations in each state. The first cluster was detected on Friday September 8 in one state, and the second cluster emerged in the second state on Wednesday September 13, by which time PulseNet had also identified potential associated cases in other states.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2006/september/response/091606.htm CDC | E. coli Outbreak From Spinach | What CDC and Other Agencies Are Doing – Sep. 16, 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5v6njHImh?url=http://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2006/september/response/091606.htm |date=December 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OutbreakNet, a group of state public health officers who investigate foodborne infection outbreaks, shared information with CDC that indicated that Oregon and Wisconsin were considering the same hypothesis: fresh spinach was the possible vehicle of infection. The group tracked and updated the increasing case count and exposure information. During a multistate call on Thursday, September 14, the group noted that the data strongly suggested that fresh spinach was a likely source. Within 24 hours of the outbreak, the data indicated that the outbreak was probably ongoing.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

CDC made communication to the public a priority by developing press releases, coordinating with FDA on press documents, conducting interviews with major media, and sending out notices on Thursday September 14 to the public health community via the Health Alert Network (HAN) and the Epidemic Information Exchange (Epi-X). By the next morning, the news media warned the U.S. population not to eat bagged spinach, with remarkable coverage.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

== Timeline ==

=== September ===
On September 14, 2006, the FDA warned consumers about an ''E. coli'' outbreak that was tied to bags of fresh spinach. The FDA reported that they received complaints from 19 states in the United States.&lt;ref name="fda14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="linked"/&gt; The FDA advised "that consumers not eat bagged fresh spinach."&lt;ref name="fda14"/&gt; Three days later, their updated warning said not to eat "fresh spinach or fresh spinach-containing products."&lt;ref name="fda17"/&gt;
On September 17, the United States expanded the warning to avoid all fresh spinach.&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt; The [[Centers for Disease Control]] issued an official ''Health Alert'', the highest category of alert message, on September 14&lt;ref&gt;[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]: [http://www2a.cdc.gov/HAN/ArchiveSys/ViewMsgV.asp?AlertNum=00249 Multiple States Investigating a Large Outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 Infections], September 14, 2006  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5v6njRGGV?url=http://www2a.cdc.gov/HAN/ArchiveSys/ViewMsgV.asp?AlertNum=00249 |date=December 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and started to investigate the ''E. coli'' outbreak. Wisconsin Governor [[Jim Doyle]] formally requested [[federal aid]] on September 15. His office said the CDC will help assess the causes and the magnitude of the outbreak in his state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.channel3000.com/health/9865564/detail.html |date=September 16, 2006 |title=CDC Starts To Investigate E. coli Outbreak In Wisconsin |publisher=[[WISC-TV]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v6njiGFb?url=http://www.channel3000.com/health/9865564/detail.html |archivedate=December 20, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 17, just three days after the initial warning, the FDA issued an updated warning stating that the public should "not eat fresh spinach or fresh spinach containing products."&lt;ref name="fda17"/&gt;

On September 18, [[Illinois]] and [[Nebraska]] reported their first cases of ''E. coli'' infection due to spinach, bringing the total number of affected states to 21. Ohio public health officials are investigating a 2-year-old's death that may also be linked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/n/content/oh/story/news/state/2006/09/18/ddn091806ohecoli.html |date=September 18, 2006 |title=Ohio tot's death may be linked to tainted spinach |publisher=[[Dayton Daily News]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v6nkKAHM?url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/n/content/oh/story/news/state/2006/09/18/ddn091806ohecoli.html |archivedate=December 20, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 19, it was reported that there may be a link to a further death in [[Ohio]] and [[irrigation]] water is being investigated as a possible source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/rss/15554157.htm?source=syn |title=Farm water is suspected in outbreak |date=September 19, 2006 |publisher=[[Mercury News]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v6nlzgwS?url=http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/rss/15554157.htm?source=syn |archivedate=December 20, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the 9th outbreak traced to the [[Salinas Valley]] in California and the 25th leafy green ''E. coli'' outbreak ([[spinach]] or lettuce) in the United States since 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodsafetynetwork.ca/en/article-details.php?a=3&amp;c=14&amp;sc=98&amp;id=903 |title=Outbreaks of foodborne illness linked to fresh lettuce and spinach since 1993 |date=September 18, 2006 |work=Food Safety Network |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927211302/http://www.foodsafetynetwork.ca/en/article-details.php?a=3&amp;c=14&amp;sc=98&amp;id=903 |archivedate=September 27, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 20, the CDC announced that the genetic fingerprint, a [[PFGE]] pattern, of [[E. coli O157|''E. coli'' O157]] isolated from an opened package of "[[Dole Food Company|Dole]] Baby Spinach, Best if Used by August 30" packed by [[Natural Selection (food company)|Natural Selection]] in the refrigerator of an ill New Mexico resident matched that of the outbreak strain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/foodborne/ecolispinach/092006.htm |title=Update on Multi-State Outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 Infections From Fresh Spinach, September 20, 2006 |date=September 20, 2006 |work=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v6nmea0C?url=http://www.cdc.gov/foodborne/ecolispinach/092006.htm |archivedate=December 20, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
On September 25, consumer advocates and lawmakers began urging tougher rules for fields and processing plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2006-09-24-produce-rules_x.htm |work=USA Today |title=Safety advocates, growers debate produce rules |first=John |last=Ritter |date=October 5, 2006 |accessdate=April 22, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v6nmmBsZ?url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2006-09-24-produce-rules_x.htm |archivedate=December 20, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 27, a Pittsford woman filed a lawsuit concerning this matter, stating that the tainted spinach has made her ill. See [http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060927/NEWS01/609270327/1002 Pittsford Woman Files Tainted Spinach Lawsuit]. This source also stated that additional lawsuits were being filed nationwide.

On September 29, the FDA downgraded the warning, now only warning against specific brands packaged on specific dates, instead of just fresh spinach in general.&lt;ref name="ReutersFDAreducewarning"&gt;[http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/T/TAINTED_SPINACH?SITE=7219&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2006-09-29-20-28-40 (Reuters)]  {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== October ====
On October 5, 2006, the FBI has launched a criminal investigation into this matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecommercetimes.com/perl/search.pl?query=FDA Criminal Probe launched into the Spinach E. coli incident]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5v6nn0Fsf?url=http://www.ecommercetimes.com/perl/search.pl?query=FDA |date=December 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technewsworld.com/perl/story/53460.html FBI investigates Spinach E. coli incident as a criminal matter]  {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/200609/18/health/main2016329.shtml CBS News: Feds investigate outbreak] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5v6nnqRAd?url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/200609/18/health/main2016329.shtml |date=December 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 9, 2006, a popular brand of lettuce grown in California's Salinas Valley, the region at the center of the nationwide spinach scare has been recalled over concerns about ''E. coli'' contamination.

On October 26, 2006, some of the largest grocery chains, including [[Vons]], [[New Albertsons Inc.|Albertsons]], [[Ralphs]] and others, sent a letter to the farmer's associations, giving them 6 weeks to come up with a plan to prevent problems like the E. coli breakout from happening again.

==== Overall toll ====
The overall toll of the spinach incident was 199 people in 28 states being infected, resulting in 141 hospitalizations, 31 people having kidney failure, and three deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Surak, John G. "A Recipe for Safe Food: ISO 22000 and HACCP". ''Quality Progress''. October 2007. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:AIDS Vaccine Bike Trek logo.jpg|thumb|2009 AIDS Vaccine Bike Trek]]

The annual Charity Treks [http://www.charitytreks.org '''AIDS Vaccine Bike Trek'''] is a 430-mile, charity bike ride through several states in the mountains and countryside of New England. The ride raises critical funds for research at the [[Emory Vaccine Center]] and the [[UCLA AIDS Institute]], two of the world's leading AIDS vaccine research centers working to find an [[HIV vaccine]].

==The Ride==
The ride has taken place the second week of August each year since 2002. Up to 100 cyclists and numerous volunteers complete the ride each year.  Cyclists and Crew members camp nightly in Parks and Campgrounds along the route, with daily mileage ranging between 60 and 115 miles. The route has varied over the years but has always traversed northern New England. In 2012, the route started in Burlington, Vermont and ended in Portland, Maine after five days. Riders are strongly encouraged to participate in all five days, even if they do not ride every mile.

Many have described this event as life changing. Apart from the basic mission to raise awareness and funding for AIDS vaccine research, a secondary effect is to bring people together in a common goal of hope and inclusion. Participants have included medical professionals, firefighters, tradesmen, engineers, students, retired school teachers and virtually every other occupation. They have come from all corners of the United States, Canada and Europe. Though the ride is physically challenging, the group includes well trained cyclists and those that have barely ridden across their home towns prior to training. In sharing the challenges of several days of hard physical output, the ride blends this diverse set of people into a
sort of supportive family. Each member might come for a different reason; some in honor of a loved one affected by HIV, others simply to enjoy the challenge of several days on the bike. But whatever the motivation, most describe the ride as both emotionally and physically rewarding.

Historically, none of the Charity Treks rides have imposed a fundraising minimum, though a $500 minimum is recommended. Riders pay a nominal registration fee ($250 in 2012) to cover the costs of most meals, gear transportation and insurance. Riders must cover their own travel costs and bring their own tents, if camping. Most riders and crew camp as a group in well equipped campgrounds with showers and flushing toilets. Several of the campgrounds have nice amenities such as swimming pools or lakes. Another option is to stay in hotels reasonably close to the stage end points, though they face potential good natured ribbing as taking the "princess tour". Riders must cover the cost of this option. In the event of torrential rain, those on Princess tour could suddenly find themselves popular among the camping crowd.

==History==
[[Charity Treks]] was formed in 2002 by a group of cyclists who had participated in the 2001 Montreal to Maine AIDS Vaccine Bike Trek, one of the last [[AIDSRides]] produced by Pallotta Teamworks.  The original event was organized by Palotta TeamWorks but was cancelled in 2002 due to funding issues.  A group of riders continued to do the ride that year despite the lack of organizational structure.

The riders and volunteers were committed to the cause of raising the public awareness about AIDS, and felt compelled to not let this be a one-time event. As a result, a number or riders and volunteers gathered together to form a volunteer organization whose purpose is to forward the cause of AIDS awareness and raise funds for vital research in the development of a vaccine. 100% of funds raised are donated to the two charitable beneficiaries; [http://www.vaccines.emory.edu/ '''Emory Vaccine Center''']  and [http://www.uclaaidsinstitute.org/ '''UCLA AIDS Institute''']

In addition to virtually universal access to [[contraception]], [[abortion]] was a common way for China to contain its population in accordance with its [[one-child policy]],&lt;ref&gt;Hesketh, Therese . Lu, Li. Xing, Zhu Wei, Sept 2005, "[http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMhpr051833 The Effect of China’s One-Child Family Policy After 25 Years]", The New England Journal of Medicine, Vol. 353, Iss. 11. Retrieved 5 Dec 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; in existence from 1979 to 2015.

==History==
In the early 1950s, the Chinese government made abortion illegal save when 1) the mother had a preexisting condition, such as tuberculosis or [[pernicious anemia]], that would cause the pregnancy to be a threat to the mother's life; 2) when traditional Chinese medicine could not settle an overactive fetus and spontaneous abortion was expected; and 3) when the mother had already undergone two or more [[Caesarean section]]s.&lt;ref name="Jing-Bao"&gt;Jing-Bao, Nie. ''Behind the Silence: Chinese Voices on Abortion'' Lanham, ML: Rowman &amp; Litterfield Publishers, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Punishments were written into the law for those who received or performed illegal abortions.&lt;ref name="Jing-Bao"/&gt;

In 1954 and 1956, the law was extended to include other pre-existing illnesses and disabilities, such as hypertension and epilepsy, as well as allowed women working in certain types of occupations to qualify.&lt;ref name="Jing-Bao"/&gt; Women who had already had four children and became pregnant four months after giving birth to their last child also qualified for an abortion.&lt;ref name="Jing-Bao"/&gt;

These restrictions were seen as the government's way of emphasizing the importance of population growth.&lt;ref name="Jing-Bao"/&gt; 
The scholar Nie Jing-Bao explains that these laws were relaxed in the late 1950s and early 1960s with the intent of reducing the number of deaths and lifelong injuries women sustained due to illegal abortions as well as serving as a form of population control when used in conjunction with birth control.&lt;ref name="Jing-Bao"/&gt;

==Statistics==
Exact statistics on the number of abortions performed annually are hard to come by as not all abortions are registered and Family Planning statistics are usually considered state secrets.&lt;ref name="ReportChina"&gt;Report: China aborts 13 million babies a year". Burlington, Vermont: Burlington Free Press. 31 July 2009. pp. 2A.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2008, there were an estimated 13 million abortions performed, and approximately 10 million abortion pills sold.&lt;ref name="ReportChina" /&gt; Induced abortions are more common in urban areas, where couples may only have one child.&lt;ref&gt;Garner, Paul. Qian, Xu. Tang, Shenglan, Jan 2004, “Unintended Pregnancy and Induced Abortion Among Unmarried Women in China: A Systematic Review,” BMC Health Services Research, Bio Med Central, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In rural areas, it is permissible to have a second child if the first born is a girl and a "second-birth permit" is granted, costing approximately 4,000 yuan (US$600).&lt;ref&gt;Junhong, Chu, June 2001, “Prenatal Sex Determination and Sex-Selective Abortion in Rural Central China,” Population and Development Review, Vol. 27, Iss. 2, p. 264. Retrieved 3 Sept 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  
By the 70s, abortion was officially termed a "remedial measure" for realising China's goals of controlling the population.&lt;ref&gt;Nie, Jing-Bao.  Feb 2010, “Limits of State Intervention in Sex-Selective Abortion: The Case of China,” Culture, Health and Sexuality, Vol. 12, Iss. 2, p. 206. Retrieved 3 Sept 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex-selective abortion==
{{main|Sex-selective abortion#China}}
The exception to the otherwise general permissibility of abortion in China is that the practice of pre-natal sex determination and [[sex-selective abortion]]s for non-medical reasons are illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Nie, Jing-Bao.  Feb 2010, “Limits of State Intervention in Sex-Selective Abortion: The Case of China,” Culture, Health and Sexuality, Vol. 12, Iss. 2, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Junhong, Chu, June 2001, “Prenatal Sex Determination and Sex-Selective Abortion in Rural Central China,” Population and Development Review, Vol. 27, Iss. 2, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that sex-selective abortion continues to be one of the key factors in the notably imbalanced sex-ratio in China, as the imbalance cannot be explained solely by the underreporting of female births or by excess female infant mortality.&lt;ref name="HeskethTherese"&gt;Hesketh, Therese . Lu, Li. Xing, Zhu Wei, Sept 2005, “The Effect of China’s One-Child Family Policy After 25 Years, The New England Journal of Medicine, Vol. 353, Iss. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, 117 boys were born to every 100 girls.&lt;ref name="HeskethTherese" /&gt; These trends are explained by the persistence of a preference for sons in Chinese families.&lt;ref&gt;Junhong, Chu, June 2001, “Prenatal Sex Determination and Sex-Selective Abortion in Rural Central China,” Population and Development Review, Vol. 27, Iss. 2, p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the government began an Action Plan consisting of ten policies with the aim of normalising the sex ratio of newborns by 2010.&lt;ref name="NieJingBao"&gt;Nie, Jing-Bao.  Feb 2010, “Limits of State Intervention in Sex-Selective Abortion: The Case of China,” Culture, Health and Sexuality, Vol. 12, Iss. 2, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this plan, sex-selective abortion was outlawed, as was prenatal sex diagnosis, and harsher punishments were implemented for violating both.  Other policies include controlling the marketing of ultrasonic B machines and improving the systems used by medical and Family Planning organisations to report on births, abortions and pregnancies.&lt;ref name="NieJingBao" /&gt;

Despite this, sex-selective abortion continues to be practiced, as it is not easily regulated by governments and because son-preference persists.&lt;ref name="HeskethTherese" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Junhong, Chu, June 2001, “Prenatal Sex Determination and Sex-Selective Abortion in Rural Central China,” Population and Development Review, Vol. 27, Iss. 2, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in many cases the couple can pay, or will try to pay, to be told the sex of their child while having an ultrasound.&lt;ref&gt;Junhong, Chu, June 2001, “Prenatal Sex Determination and Sex-Selective Abortion in Rural Central China,” Population and Development Review, Vol. 27, Iss. 2, p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family planning==
The importance of abortions as a [[family planning]] tool is evident through the extensive implementation of medical abortions (abortion induced by pills, which can be performed in early pregnancy) in China. In fact, such abortions were legalized in China in 1988, earlier than any other place and are already produced in a large scale in China for many years. It is unclear whether the efficiency of the procedure reaches the high success rates it has in many western countries, but it is highly promoted by Chinese doctors&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thinkingchinese.com/index.php?page_id=213 Medical Abortions in China - A Long Lasting Love Affair], [http://www.thinkingchinese.com Thinking Chinese], March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and much less invasive than regular abortions.

His musical talent was apparent early in life, but he studied at the [[Escuela Nacional Preparatoria (Mexico)|Escuela Nacional Preparatoria]] and university to become a doctor. He specialized in gynecology as well as general medicine, and eventually became the personal physician of [[Frida Kahlo]] and performed surgery on [[Agustín Lara]]. As a musician, he studied under José Pierson and soon afterward had a successful international career as an opera singer, earning the label of “tenor of the Americas.” He was often cast for productions of [[L'elisir d'amore]] and [[Madame Butterfly]].  He earned a large sum of money doing this, and used it to establish a children’s hospital in Mexico City. Ortiz died in 1960, and was interred at the [[Panteón Francés|Panteón Frances de la Piedad]]. The Festival de Canto Operístico Tirado in the state of Sonora was named after him.&lt;ref name="rincones"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Victor Manuel |editor1-last=Jimenez Gonzalez |title=Sonora: Guía para descubrir los encantos del estado |trans-title=Sonora: Guide to discover the charms of the state |year=2010 |publisher=Editorial Océano de Mexico SA de CV |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |isbn=978-607-400-319-2 |page=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology''' is a national [[clinical trial]]s network sponsored by the [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI) that consists of about 10,000 cancer specialists at hospitals, medical centers, and community clinics across the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. The Alliance develops and conducts clinical trials with promising new [[cancer treatment|cancer therapies]], and utilizes [[Cancer research|scientific research]] to develop treatment and prevention strategies for [[cancer]], as well as researching methods to alleviate [[Cancer signs and symptoms|side effects of cancer]] and cancer treatments.

The Alliance seeks to reduce the impact of cancer on people by uniting a broad community of [[scientist]]s and [[clinician]]s from many disciplines, committed to discovering, validating and disseminating effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of cancer. The Alliance conducts trials in the following [[disease]] and [[Medical imaging|modality]] areas: [[breast cancer|breast]], [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] (GI), [[Genitourinary system|genitourinary]] (GU), [[leukemia]], [[lymphoma]], [[myeloma]], neuro-[[oncology]], [[Lung cancer|respiratory]], experimental [[Therapy|therapeutics]] (rare cancers), cancer control and transplant.

The Alliance was formed by the merger of three legacy clinical trials groups: the ''American College of Surgeons Oncology Group'' ([[ACOSOG]]), the  ''Cancer and Leukemia Group B'' ([[CALGB]]), and the ''North Central Cancer Treatment Group'' ([[NCCTG]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bertagnolli|first1=Monica|title=New Alliance formed to address clinical trials in oncology|url=http://bulletin.facs.org/2012/02/new-alliance-formed-to-address-clinical-trials-in-oncology/|website=Bulletin of the American College of Surgeons|publisher=American College of Surgeons|accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The merger was completed in 2014.

Most of Wakefield's coauthors later retracted the conclusions of the original paper proposing the hypothesis,&lt;ref name=PMID15016483/&gt; and the [[General Medical Council]] found Wakefield guilty of manipulating patient data and misreporting results.&lt;ref name=Deer2009/&gt;&lt;ref name="Deer B"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/340/apr15_2/c1127 | title= Wakefield's autistic enterocolitis under the microscope |author= Deer B |work= BMJ |date=2010-04-17 |accessdate=2010-04-24| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100418214842/http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/340/apr15_2/c1127| archivedate= 18 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work has been exposed as falsified and described as an "elaborate fraud".&lt;ref name=Deer2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=BMJ2011/&gt;

== Background ==
Until the 1970s, [[autism]] was rarely accepted to be a distinctive diagnosis, but, following changes to the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]] of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] it is diagnosed much more often. How much of this increase is due to greater diagnostic vigilance by doctors, changes in diagnostic categories, or an actual increase in [[prevalence]], remains unclear.  Late-onset autism cases are estimated at 25% and reported by sources including the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' as not having changed in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Taylor B, Miller E, Lingam R, Andrews N, Simmons A, Stowe J |title=Measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination and bowel problems or developmental regression in children with autism: population study |journal=BMJ |volume=324 |issue=7334 |pages=393–6 |year=2002 |pmid=11850369 |pmc=65532 |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11850369 |doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7334.393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite others{{Who|date=August 2011}} describing common bowel features, there have been no [[peer review]]ed studies yet published, as of 2006, corroborating the existence of ''autistic enterocolitis''; other studies have explicitly refuted its existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Black C, Kaye JA, Jick H |title=Relation of childhood gastrointestinal disorders to autism: nested case-control study using data from the UK General Practice Research Database |journal=BMJ |volume=325 |issue=7361 |pages=419–21 |year=2002 |pmid=12193358 |pmc=119436 |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12193358 |doi=10.1136/bmj.325.7361.419}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, it is not generally accepted that the types of colitis diagnosed in autistic individuals are either unique to autism, or more common in autistic people than in the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/mmr_prog_summary.shtml|title=Does the MMR Jab Cause Autism?|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2007-11-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071021200325/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/mmr_prog_summary.shtml| archivedate= 21 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Lancet'' study ==
When Wakefield and his colleagues first reported in 1998 a possible association between autistic regression, [[inflammatory bowel disease]] (IBD), and [[MMR vaccine]]s in the ''[[The Lancet|Lancet]]'', they evaluated a dozen children with [[pervasive developmental disorder]]s, apparent developmental regression, and intestinal symptoms, referred to the [[Royal Free Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Wakefield A, Murch S, Anthony A |author-link= Andrew Wakefield |title= Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children |journal=Lancet |volume=351 |issue=9103 |pages=637–41 |year=1998 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(97)11096-0 |pmid=9500320 |url=http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-paper.htm |accessdate=2007-09-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010149/http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-paper.htm| archivedate= 27 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no|display-authors=etal}}{{Retracted paper|{{PMID|20137807}}|intentional=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to parents, onset of behavioral symptoms was linked to recent (within two weeks) immunization with MMR vaccine in eight of the children diagnosed with developmental disorders. The most consistent report was lymphoid nodular hyperplasia of the terminal [[ileum]] in nine of the children.  This feature has also been reported to be very common in non-autistic children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://briandeer.com/wakefield/ileal-hyperplasia.htm|title=Wakefield MMR-autism sign was recognized for years: as benign finding in children|publisher=[[Brian Deer]]|accessdate=2007-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A variety of colonic and rectal mucosal features were reported in eight cases. Biopsies of the ileum were reported to have shown reactive lymphoid follicular hyperplasia in seven.  Biopsies of the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] were reported to have shown a diffuse mononuclear cell infiltrate in six.

Wakefield and his colleagues said they described features of regressive autism with bowel disorders, or what Wakefield would later call ''autistic enterocolitis'', although these findings have been questioned, with claims that the association of features is substantially an artifact of preselection of vaccinated children with both developmental disorders and bowel symptoms for a UK lawsuit:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-summary.htm |title= The MMR-autism crisis&amp;nbsp;— our story so far |accessdate=2008-12-06 |author= Deer B |date=2008-11-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081206015353/http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-summary.htm| archivedate= 6 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Most of the children were reported to have swelling of the [[lymph]]oid tissue lining the [[intestine]]s, particularly near where the small and [[large intestine]]s meet, and inflammation of the large intestine, associated with [[constipation]], [[diarrhea]] and, in some cases, pain.
* In some affected children, impaired cellular immunity to common recall [[antigen]]s, with low numbers of circulating [[white blood cell]]s were reported.
* A specific [[measles]] protein signal is claimed to have been detected in inflamed lymphoid tissue.
* In some cases, loss of speech and language, bowel disturbances, self-injury, and a self-limited diet, associated with cravings for particular foods.
* [[Allergy|Allergies]], [[food intolerance]]s are also reported in some children.

In an April 2010 investigation into the origins of claims for "autistic enterocolitis", reporter [[Brian Deer]] revealed in the [[BMJ]] that the original pathology results on the children in the study (obtained from the Royal Free hospital) had been subjected to wholesale changes, from normal to abnormal, in the medical school.&lt;ref name="Deer B"/&gt; On 2 January 2011, Deer provided two tables comparing the data on the twelve children, showing the original hospital data and the data with the wholesale changes as used in the 1998 ''Lancet'' article.&lt;ref name=Deer_tables&gt;[http://www.bmj.com/content/suppl/2011/01/05/bmj.c5347.DC1/deeb200710.ww1_default.pdf "MMR &amp; Autism: Fixing a Link"], Tables prepared by Brian Deer as a supplement to his peer reviewed report "How the case against the MMR vaccine was fixed", published in the BMJ in January 2011 (BMJ 2011;342:c5347).&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 article in the [[British Medical Journal]] described how the data in the study had been falsified by Wakefield so it would arrive at a predetermined conclusion.&lt;ref name=Deer2011&gt;{{cite journal | title=How the case against the MMR vaccine was fixed| author=Deer B| journal=BMJ| year=2011| volume=342| pages=c5347| url=http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c5347.full |doi= 10.1136/bmj.c5347| pmid=21209059}}&lt;/ref&gt; An accompanying editorial in the same journal described Wakefield's work as an "elaborate [[fraudulent|fraud]]" which led to lower vaccination rates, putting hundreds of thousands of children at risk and diverting energy and money away from research into the true cause of autism.&lt;ref name=BMJ2011&gt;{{cite journal |year= 2011 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.c7452 |pages= c7452 |volume= 342|title= Wakefield's article linking MMR vaccine and autism was fraudulent |vauthors=Godlee F, Smith J, Marcovitch H |journal = [[BMJ]] |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452.full |pmid=21209060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discredited link to MMR vaccinations ==
Wakefield has hypothesized that ''autistic enterocolitis'' is an emergent IBD [[phenotype]] that follows from exposure to the [[vaccination]]s given to children during a period when their immune systems are rapidly developing.  Other research, however, rejects this hypothesis, and other groups have not reproduced Wakefield's findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thjodleifsson B, Davídsdóttir K, Agnarsson U, Sigthórsson G, Kjeld M, Bjarnason I |title=Effect of Pentavac and measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination on the intestine |journal=Gut |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=816–7 |date=December 2002 |pmid=12427783 |pmc=1773472 |url=http://gut.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12427783 |doi=10.1136/gut.51.6.816}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have identified a high incidence of bowel symptoms in autistic children before the MMR vaccine was licensed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://briandeer.com/wakefield/coleman-child.htm|title=Study found many autistic children with bowel problems before MMR was licensed|publisher=[[Brian Deer]]|accessdate=2007-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also revealed that, prior to the publication of Wakefield's studies alleging a connection between the MMR vaccine and autistic enterocolitis, he had received over £400,000 from lawyers attempting to sue vaccine manufacturers. This [[conflict of interest]], which Wakefield denies, has led many to criticize Wakefield and his results. The British [[General Medical Council]] has launched an inquiry into possible dishonesty by Wakefield regarding his research.&lt;ref name=LegalAid/&gt; In 2011, an article was published in the [[British Medical Journal]] which referred to Wakefield's 1998 paper as an "elaborate fraud."&lt;ref name=BMJ2011 /&gt;

== Retraction of paper ==
{{update section|date=February 2015}}
The  ''Lancet'' paper has been widely cited as an impetus for concerns regarding the MMR vaccine being a cause of autism.  Wakefield gave interviews after the publication of the paper, including on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' where he raised concerns regarding administration of the MMR vaccine.  In the ''Lancet'' paper, Wakefield and his co-authors said on the issue:
:"''We did not prove an association between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and the syndrome described. Virological studies are underway that may help to resolve this issue''"

This paper was partially retracted in 2004,&lt;ref name="PMID15016483" /&gt; then fully retracted in 2010.&lt;ref name="full-retraction" /&gt;

In 2004, 10 of the 12 authors issued a statement in the ''Lancet''  entitled "Retraction of an interpretation".&lt;ref name=PMID15016483&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Murch SH, Anthony A, Casson DH |title=Retraction of an interpretation |journal=Lancet |volume=363 |issue=9411 |page=750 |year=2004 |pmid=15016483 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)15715-2|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this, the authors retracted the conclusion section of the paper, formally known in the Lancet and in many biomedical journals, as the "interpretation". The section of the paper retracted said:

:"''Interpretation.  We identified associated gastrointestinal disease and developmental regression in a group of previously normal children, which was generally associated in time with possible environmental triggers.''"

In the retraction, issued in March 2004, they said:

:"''We wish to make it clear that in this paper no causal link was established between MMR vaccine and autism as the data were insufficient. However, the possibility of such a link was raised and consequent events have had major implications for public health. In view of this, we consider now is the appropriate time that we should together formally retract the interpretation placed upon these findings in the paper, according to precedent.''"

The authors also said:

:"''The main thrust of this paper was the first description of an unexpected intestinal lesion in the children reported. Further evidence has been forthcoming in studies from the Royal Free Centre for Paediatric Gastroenterology and other groups to support and extend these findings.  While much uncertainty remains about the nature of these changes, we believe it important that such work continues, as autistic children can potentially be helped by recognition and treatment of gastrointestinal problems.''"

The authors stated that they were unable to contact one of the two remaining original authors, John Linnell.

Just before the retraction, criticism arose over the fact that the [[Royal Free Hospital]] had received £55,000 in August 1996 from lawyers preparing to sue MMR manufacturers for support of Wakefield's research. Wakefield asserted that the donation was to fund a second clinical study; some of the children involved were subjects in both studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn4743|title=Controversial MMR and autism study retracted|date=4 March 2004|publisher=NewScientist.com|author=McKee, Maggie|accessdate=2007-11-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071024030731/http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn4743| archivedate= 24 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was subsequently revealed by ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' of London that Wakefield had personally been paid more than £400,000.&lt;ref name=LegalAid&gt;{{cite news| title=MMR Doctor given legal aid thousands|work=The Sunday Times |date=December 31, 2006|author=Deer, Brian|authorlink=Brian Deer|url=http://briandeer.com/mmr/st-dec-2006.htm|accessdate=2007-11-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071028093457/http://briandeer.com/mmr/st-dec-2006.htm| archivedate= 28 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wakefield, who did not sign the retraction, currently faces disciplinary charges before the [[General Medical Council]] over the conduct of this research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Deer B |authorlink= Brian Deer |title= MMR scare doctor faces list of charges |work= Sunday Times |date=2005-09-11 |url=http://briandeer.com/wakefield/gmc-alleges.htm |format=Reprint |accessdate=2007-08-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070809053218/http://briandeer.com/wakefield/gmc-alleges.htm| archivedate= 9 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2009 ''The Sunday Times'' reported that Wakefield had manipulated patient data and misreported results in his 1998 paper, creating the appearance of a link with autism.&lt;ref name=Deer2009&gt;{{cite news |author= Deer B |title= MMR doctor Andrew Wakefield fixed data on autism |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683671.ece |work= Sunday Times |date=2009-02-08 |accessdate=2009-02-09 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090208234919/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683671.ece| archivedate= 8 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the GMC investigation and findings, the editors of ''The Lancet'' announced on 2 February 2010 that they "fully retract this paper from the published record."&lt;ref name=full-retraction&gt;{{cite journal |author=The Editors Of The Lancet |title=Retraction—Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children |journal=Lancet |volume= 375 |issue= 9713|page=445 |date=February 2010 |pmid=20137807 |doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60175-4  |accessdate=2010-02-02 |url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2810%2960175-4/fulltext# |laysource=BBC News |laydate=2010-02-02 |laysummary=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/health/8493753.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, the [[Cochrane Library]] published its analysis of dozens of "high quality" medical studies which concluded no link could be found between the MMR vaccine and bowel disease, autism or other [[pervasive developmental disorder]]s.  To increase the rigor of the meta-analysis, the criteria of the meta-analysis excluded smaller studies and studies that had the potential for bias.  Wakefield's work was specifically excluded in the meta-analysis due to small sample size.  With regard to the vaccine, Cochrane said that its survey of research "strongly supports its use".&lt;ref name=cd004407&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Demicheli V, Rivetti A, Debalini MG, Di Pietrantonj C |title=Vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella in children |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=2 |issue= |pages=CD004407 |year=2012 |pmid=22336803 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004407.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== U.S. Court of Federal Claims ==
On February 12, 2009, three Special Masters of the [[United States Court of Federal Claims]] rendered three opinions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/node/5026 Court of Federal Claims opinions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301160555/http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/node/5026 |date=March 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in three "test cases" that were proceeding in that court, each of which addressed causation issues relating to MMR vaccine and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).  The opinions were critical of [[Arthur Krigsman]] and his testimony about autistic enterocolitis, which the court said that he described as a "new form of gastrointestinal [GI] disorder." Typical of their criticism was the following passage found at page 199 of the opinion in the Snyder case:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/vaccine_files/Vowell.Snyder.pdf Court of Federal Claims opinion in the Snyder case]&lt;/ref&gt; "Doctor Krigsman was qualified to testify about gastroenterology [but his] qualifications to establish the validity of a new form of gastrointestinal disorder, unrecognized by other authorities in the field, were ... sadly lacking." The court noted that the "medical textbooks" do not recognize autistic enterocolitis. At page 27, the same opinion stated that "Dr. Krigsman’s testimony about autistic enterocolitis as a diagnostic entity was speculative."

In his judgment in Cedillo v Secretary for Health and Human Services, February 12, 2009, Special Master George Hastings said:

:"''To be sure, the petitioners in this case have stressed that they rely upon Dr Krigsman as their expert concerning the causation of GI symptoms, not Dr Wakefield. Thus, they argue that criticisms of the personal integrity of Dr Wakefield are not relevant here. However, because Dr Krigsman’s general causation approach clearly was strongly influenced by Dr Wakefield’s theory, criticisms of Dr Wakefield’s “autistic enterocolitis” theory are relevant, and criticisms relating to Dr Wakefield’s credibility in developing that theory are of relevance as well. Therefore, it is a noteworthy point that not only has that “autistic enterocolitis” theory not been accepted into gastroenterology textbooks, but that theory, and Dr Wakefield’s role in its development, have been strongly criticized as constituting defective or fraudulent science.''"

'''Boccia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɒ|tʃ|ə}} {{respell|BOTCH|ə}}) is a precision [[ball sport]], similar to [[bocce]], and related to [[bowls]] and [[pétanque]].  The name "boccia" is derived from the Latin word for "boss"&amp;nbsp;– ''{{lang|la|bottia}}''.&lt;ref&gt;[//www.boccia.org/history.html History of Bocce]&lt;/ref&gt;  The sport is contested at local, national and international levels, by athletes with severe physical disabilities.  It was originally designed to be played by people with [[cerebral palsy]] but now includes athletes with other severe disabilities affecting [[motor skills]].  In 1984, it became a [[Paralympic sport]], and in 2008 was being practised in over fifty [[countries]] worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=//www.paralympic.org/sport/boccia |title=Boccia &amp;#124; IPC |publisher=Paralympic.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Boccia is governed by the [[Boccia International Sports Federation]] (BISFed) and is one of only two Paralympic sports (along with [[goalball]]) that have no counterpart in the [[Olympic sports|Olympic program]].

==About the game==
Boccia can be played by individuals, pairs, or teams of three. All events are mixed gender. The aim of the game is to throw [[leather]] balls&amp;nbsp;— coloured red or blue (which side uses which is determined by a [[coin toss]]) as close as they can to a white target ball, or jack. The jack is thrown first, then the first two regular balls are played (first, the player who threw the jack then the opposing side), after which the side furthest away from the jack goes next in an attempt to either get closer to the jack or knock the opposition's ball out of the way. In this fashion, each end will continue until one side has played all their balls, at which point, the opposing side will play their remaining balls. The balls can be moved with [[hands]], [[Foot|feet]], or, if the competitor's disability is severe, with an assistive device such as a ramp. At the end of each round, or end, the [[referee]] measures the distance of the balls closest to the jack, and awards points accordingly&amp;nbsp;— one point for each ball that is closer to the jack than the opponent's closest ball. The team/player with the highest number of points at the end of play is the winner. If both teams have the same number of points after all ends have been played, one additional end is played to determine a winner.

The number of ends and balls in each end depends on the side makeup. Individual competition consists of four ends and six balls per player per end, whilst paired competition is four ends and six balls per pair per end (three per player). Team competition is six ends, and six balls per team per end (two per player).

In pair and team events, a reserve player is allowed. Between ends a reserve can be substituted for a player during a game, but only one substitution per game is permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=//www.boccia.org.nz/ |title=Boccia New Zealand&amp;nbsp;— Boccia New Zealand |publisher=Boccia.org.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041211231628/http://www.boccia.org.nz/ |archivedate=2004-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boccia is played on a court measuring 12.5 × 6&amp;nbsp;m with 2&amp;nbsp;m of empty space around it. The surface of the court is flat and smooth. The throwing area is divided into six rectangular throwing boxes in which the athletes must stay completely within during play. On the court is a V-shaped line over which the jack must cross for the throw to be valid. At the end of the court is the ‘dead ball container’ in which balls are put if they are thrown outside the time limit, out of the area of play or if the athlete violates a rule during his or her throw. A cross marks the position where the jack must be placed if it touches or crosses the boundary line or in the case of a tie-break. The balls themselves are made of leather and are slightly larger than a tennis ball, weighing approximately 275&amp;nbsp;grams and measuring 270&amp;nbsp;mm in circumference. They are available in different grades of softness and hardness.

To be eligible to compete in boccia at national or international level, athletes must have a disability and be in a wheelchair, as a result of cerebral palsy, or another neurological condition that has similar effects, such as [[muscular dystrophy]] or [[traumatic brain injury]]. Players are examined to determine the extent of their disability and then assigned to a sport class, designed to allow them to compete against other athletes with a similar level of physical function.

Boccia players are assigned to one of four sport classes, depending on their functional ability:
*'''BC1''' &amp;ndash; Players in this class throw the ball with the hand or foot.  They may compete with an assistant who stays outside the competitor's playing box, to stabilize or adjust their playing chair and give the ball to the player when requested.
*'''BC2''' &amp;ndash; Players in this class throw the ball with the hand. They are not eligible for assistance.
*'''BC3''' &amp;ndash; Players in this class have very severe locomotor dysfunction in all four extremities. Players in this class have no sustained grasp or release action and although they may have arm movement, they have insufficient range of movement to propel a boccia ball onto the court. They may use an assistive device such as a ramp to deliver the ball. They may compete using an assistant; assistants must keep their back to the court and their eyes averted from play.&lt;ref&gt;[//www.sportingwheelies.org.au/doc.php?ID=218] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216235455/http://www.sportingwheelies.org.au/doc.php?ID=218 |date=February 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''BC4''' &amp;ndash; Players in this class have severe locomotor dysfunction of all four extremities as well as poor trunk control. They can demonstrate sufficient dexterity to throw the ball onto the court. Players are not eligible for assistance.

==Competition==
Boccia can be played on a recreational and/or competitive basis.  Competitions are organized locally, regionally, nationally, and internationally.  The international competition calendar is based on the Summer Paralympic Games quadrennial, with international regional championships in the first year, world championships in the second year, world cup in the third year, and the Paralympic games in the fourth year.

There are approximately 350 internationally ranked boccia players.&lt;ref&gt;[//www.cpisra.org/files/sports/boccia/Boccia_CPISRA_World_Ranking_List_2010.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721083444/http://www.cpisra.org/files/sports/boccia/Boccia_CPISRA_World_Ranking_List_2010.pdf |date=July 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

88 athletes from 19 countries competed at the [[2008 Summer Paralympics]] in Beijing held 7 to 17 September. Brazil and Korea were ranked first equal over all, both countries finishing with two gold medals and one bronze medal each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=//en.paralympic.beijing2008.cn/sports/boccia/index.shtml |title=Boccia&amp;nbsp;— The Official Website of the Beijing 2008 Paralympic Games |publisher=En.paralympic.beijing2008.cn |date= |accessdate=2013-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603144802/http://en.paralympic.beijing2008.cn/sports/boccia/index.shtml |archivedate=2008-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athletes from 36 countries attended the 2010 Boccia World Championships, and 28 countries participated in the team competition. The balance of power in recent years has shifted from European dominance to a more worldwide competitiveness with Brazil leading the BC4s and Korea the BC3s. The dominant force of the Mixed Team has only recently changed hands from GB to Korea but the former power houses Spain and Portugal can never be ruled out.

On November 2004, voters in the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]] passed [[California Proposition 63 (2004)|Proposition 63]], the '''Mental Health Services Act''' ('''MHSA'''), which has been designed to expand and transform California’s county [[community mental health services|mental health service]] systems.  The MHSA is funded by imposing an additional one percent tax on individual, but not corporate, taxable income in excess of one million dollars. In becoming law on January 2005, the MHSA represents the latest in a Californian legislative movement, begun in the 1990s, to provide better coordinated and more comprehensive care to those with serious mental illness, particularly in underserved populations. Its claim of successes thus far, such as with the development of innovative and integrated Full Service Partnerships (FSPs), are not without detractors who highlight many problems but especially a lack of oversight, large amount of unspent funds, poor transparency, lack of engagement in some communities, and a lack of adherence to required reporting as challenges MHSA implementation must overcome to fulfill the law's widely touted potential.

==Background==

At one time, California was known for having a strong mental health system. Treatment was available for Medi-Cal recipients with few limitations on care.   Legislators and voters have acknowledged the inadequacy of California's historically underfunded mental health system to care for the state's residents, especially those with serious mental illness, over the past few decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Senate Committee on Budget and Fiscal Review|title=Overview of the 2000-01 Budget Bill: California's mental health system- underfunded from the start|url=http://www.mhac.org/pdf/MH_Funding.pdf|accessdate=28 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304102344/http://www.mhac.org/pdf/MH_Funding.pdf#|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Feltin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Felton|first=Mistique C.|author2=Cashin, Cheryl E.|author3=Brown, Timothy T.|title=What does it take?

However, with the passage of Proposition 63 in 2004, California voters acted upon a widespread perception that state and county mental health systems were still in disrepair, underfunded, and requiring a systematic, organizational overhaul. This perception echoed a nationwide perspective, with the President's [[New Freedom Commission on Mental Health]] in 2003 calling for fundamental transformation of the historically fragmented mental health system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health|title=Achieving the promise: transforming mental health care in America. Final Report. Pub. No. SMA-03-3832|year=2003|publisher=Department of Health and Human Services|location=Rockville, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MHSA is California's attempt to lead the way in accomplishing such systemic reform.

In the end, voter consciences were pricked by the well-organized and -funded campaign that displayed both the need (50,000 mentally ill homeless people, according to the [[National Alliance on Mental Illness]]) and the promise (successes of past mental health initiatives) of increased funding for the mental health system.&lt;ref name=Scheffler&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scheffler|first=Richard M.|author2=Adams, Neal|title=Millionaires and mental health: Proposition 63 in California|journal=Health Affairs|year=2005|pages=w212-w224|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.w5.212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then-Assemblyman [[Darrell Steinberg]] and Rusty Selix, executive director of the Mental Health Association in California, led the initiative by collecting at minimum 373,816 signatures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proposed initiative enters circulation - mental health services expansion and funding.

==Overview==

The voter-approved MHSA initiative&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mental Health Services Act|url=http://www.dmh.ca.gov/Prop_63/MHSA/docs/Mental_Health_Services_Act_Full_Text.pdf|publisher=California Department of Mental Health|accessdate=28 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112174923/http://www.dmh.ca.gov/Prop_63/MHSA/docs/Mental_Health_Services_Act_Full_Text.pdf|archivedate=12 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides for developing, through an extensive [[Stakeholder analysis|stakeholder]] process, a comprehensive approach to providing community based mental health services and supports for California residents.  Approximately 51,000 taxpayers in California will be helping to fund the MHSA through an estimated $750 million in tax revenue during fiscal year 2005-06.

The MHSA was an unprecedented piece of legislation in California for several reasons:
* Its funding source, quantity, and allocation is dedicated for mental health services, incliuding times of budget cuts to many other public programs
* It was intended to engage communities in prioritizing which service elements would be funded. 
* It was focused on developing preventive and innovative programs to help transform the mental health care system in California. I

To accomplish its objectives, the MHSA applies a specific portion of its funds to each of six system-building components:
* Community program planning and administration (10%)
* Community services and supports (45%)
* Capital (buildings) and [[information technology]] (IT) (10%)
* Education and training (human resources) (10%)
* Prevention and early intervention (20%)
* Innovation (5%)&lt;ref name=Feldman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feldman|first=Saul|title=The 'Millionaires Tax' and mental health policy in California|journal=Health Affairs|year=2009|volume=28|issue=3|pages=809–815|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.28.3.809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, none of the funds were to be used for programs with  existing fund allocations, unless it was for a new element or expansion in those existing programs. 51% of the funds have to be spent on children's service&lt;ref name=Feldman/&gt;

The MHSA stipulates that the [[California State Department of Mental Health]] (DMH) will contract with county mental health departments (plus two cities) to develop and manage the implementation of its provisions.  Oversight responsibility for MHSA implementation was handed over to the sixteen member Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission (MHSOAC) on July 7, 2005, when the commission first met.

The MHSA specifies requirements for service delivery and supports for children, youths, adults and older adults with serious emotional disturbances and/or severe [[mental illness]]es.  MHSA funding will be made annually to counties to:
* Define serious mental illness among children, adults and seniors as a condition deserving priority attention, including prevention and early intervention services and medical and supportive care
* Reduce the long-term adverse impact on individuals, families and State and local budgets resulting from untreated serious mental illness
* Expand the kinds of successful, innovative service programs for children, adults and seniors already established in California, including culturally and linguistically competent approaches for underserved population
* Provide State and local funds to adequately meet the needs of all children and adults who can be identified and enrolled in programs under this measure
* Ensure all funds are expended in the most cost-effective manner and services are provided in accordance with recommended [[best practices]], subject to local and State oversight to ensure accountability to taxpayers and to the public

==Implementation==

Starting from enactment, implementation of the MHSA was intended to take six months; in reality, the process of obtaining stakeholder input for administrative rules extended this period by several months. By August 2005, 12 meetings and 13 conference calls involving stakeholders across the state resulted in the final draft of rules by which counties would submit their three-year plans for approval.&lt;ref name="Proposition 63"/&gt;

Counties are required to develop their own three-year plan, consistent with the requirements outlined in the act, in order to receive funding under the MHSA.  Counties are obliged to collaborate with citizens and stakeholders to develop plans that will accomplish desired results through the meaningful use of time and capabilities, including things such as employment, [[vocational training]], education, and social and community activities.  Also required will be annual updates by the counties, along with a public review process.  County proposals will be evaluated for their contribution to achieving the following goals:
* Safe and adequate housing, including safe living environments, with family for children and youths
* Reduction in homelessness
* A network of supportive relationships
* Timely access to needed help, including times of crisis
* Reduction in incarceration in [[Prison|jail]]s and [[Juvenile Hall|juvenile halls]]
* Reduction in involuntary services, including reduction in institutionalization and [[Outpatient commitment|out-of-home placements]]

MHSA specifies three stages of local funding, to fulfill initial plans, three year plans, and long term strategies. No services would be funded in the first year of implementation. The DMH approved the first county plan in January 2006.&lt;ref name="Proposition 63"/&gt; Allocations for each category of funding were planned to be granted annually, based upon detailed plans with prior approval. However, an amendment to the MHSA, AB 100, which passed in March 2011, serves to streamline the DMH approval and feedback process to the counties, ostensibly to relieve the DMH of some of its administrative burden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AB 100 (Committee on Budget): Mental Health Services Act|url=http://www.aroundthecapitol.com/Bills/AB_100/20112012/|accessdate=28 January 2012|newspaper=AroundTheCapitol: California political news, opinion, laws &amp; legislation|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roles &amp; Responsibilities==

While the county mental health departments are involved in the actual implementation of MHSA programs, the MHSA mandates that several entities support or oversee the counties. These include the State Department of Mental Health (DMH) and the Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission (MHSOAC).

===California State Department of Mental Health (DMH)===

In accordance with realignment, the DMH approves county three-year implementation plans, upon comment from the MHSOAC,&lt;ref name=history/&gt; and passes programmatic responsibilities to the counties. In the first few months immediately following its passage, the DMH has:
* Obtained federal approvals and [[Medi-Cal]] waivers, State authority, additional resources and technical assistance in areas related to implementation
* Established detailed requirements for the content of local three year expenditure plans
* Developed criteria and procedures for reporting of county and state performance outcomes
* Defined requirements for the maintenance of current State and local efforts to protect against supplanting existing programs and their funding streams
* Developed formulas for how funding will be divided or distributed among counties
* Determined how funding will flow to counties and set up the mechanics of distribution
* Established a 16-member Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission (MHSOAC), composed of elected State officials and Governor appointees, along with procedures for MHSOAC review of county planning efforts and oversight of DMH implementation
* Developed and published regulations and provide preliminary training to all counties on plan development and implementation requirements

The DMH has directed all counties to develop plans incorporating five essential concepts:
* Community collaboration
* Cultural competence
* Client/family-driven mental health system for older adults, adults and transition age youth and family-driven system of care for children and youth
* Wellness focus, which includes the concepts of recovery and resilience
* Integrated service experiences for clients and their families throughout their interactions with the mental health system

The DMH, in assuming and asserting its primacy over MHSA implementation, has dictated requirements for service delivery and supports as follows:
* Full Service Partnership (FSP) Funds - funds to provide necessary services and supports for initial populations
* General System Development Funds - funds to improve services and infrastructure
* Outreach and Engagement Funding - funds for those populations that are currently receiving little or no service

===Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission (MHSOAC)===

The authors of the MHSA created the MHSOAC to reflect the consumer-oriented focus of the law, mandating at least two appointees with severe mental illness, two other family members of individuals with severe mental illness, and various other community representatives. This diverse commission holds the responsibility of approving county implementation plans, helping develop mental illness [[social stigma|stigma]]-relieving strategies, and recommending service delivery improvements to the state on an as-needed basis.&lt;ref name=Feldman/&gt; Whenever the commission identifies a critical issue related to the performance of a county mental health program, it may refer the issue to the DMH.

The first meeting of the MHSOAC was held July 7, 2005, at which time Proposition 63 author [[Darrell Steinberg]] was selected unanimously by fellow commissioners as chairman, without comment or discussion.  After accepting the gavel, Steinberg was roundly praised for devising Proposition 63's '[[creative financing]]' scheme.  Steinberg then said, "We must focus on the big picture," and stated his priorities with regard to the implementation of the MHSA:
* Prioritize prevention and early intervention, without falling into the trap of fail first service provision,
* Address "the plight of those at risk of falling off the edge," and to
* Advocate for mental health services from his "[[bully pulpit]]."

==Current progress==

One unqualified success story from the MHSA thus far involves the implementation of Full Service Partnerships (FSPs) demonstrating the "whatever it takes" commitment to assist in individualized recovery&lt;ref name=Cashin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cashin|first=Cheryl|last2=Scheffler |first2=Richard |last3=Felton |first3=Mistique |last4=Adams |first4=Neal |last5=Miller |first5=Leonard|title=Transformation of the California mental health system: stakeholder-driven planning as a transformational activity|journal=Psychiatric Services|date=October 2008|volume=59|issue=10|pages=1107–1114|doi=10.1176/appi.ps.59.10.1107}}&lt;/ref&gt; - whether it is housing, "integrated services, flexible funding [such as for childcare], intensive case management, [or] 24 h access to care."&lt;ref name=Feltin/&gt; FSP interventions are based upon evidence from such programs as [[Assertive community treatment]] (ACT), which has effectively reduced homelessness and hospitalizations while bettering outcomes.&lt;ref name=Feltin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coldwell|first=Craig M.|author2=Bender, William S.|title=The effectiveness of assertive community treatment for homeless populations with severe mental illness: a meta-analysis|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|year=2007|volume=164|issue=3|pages=393–399|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.164.3.393}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the FSP model looks more like that of the also-popular MHA Village in Long Beach, which is a center that offers more comprehensive services besides those specifically mental health-related.&lt;ref name=editorial&gt;{{cite news|last=Editorial|title=A musician of the streets|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-ed-homeless3jan03,0,5399524,print.story|accessdate=28 January 2012|newspaper=LA Times|date=January 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond these guiding principles, however, there has not been much consensus over unifying strategies to define and implement an FSP - resulting in varying FSP structures across counties.&lt;ref name=Cashin/&gt;

Overall, though, the Petris Center, funded by the DMH and California HealthCare Foundation to evaluate the MHSA, has reported quantifiable improvements in many areas:
* Homelessness rates
* Entry rates into the criminal justice system
* Suffering from illness
* Daily functioning
* Education rates
* Employment rates
* General satisfaction with FSPs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scheffler|first=Richard M.|title=Evidence on the effectiveness of Full Service Partnership programs in California’s public mental health system|url=http://www.dmh.ca.gov/prop_63/MHSA/Publications/docs/PetrisCenter_ExecSummaryReport_Final.pdf|publisher=Petris Center|accessdate=28 January 2012|last2=Felton|first2=Mistique|last3=Brown|first3=Timothy T.|last4=Chung|first4=Jessica|last5=Choi|first5=Sun-Soon|date=May 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220093145/http://www.dmh.ca.gov/Prop_63/MHSA/Publications/docs/PetrisCenter_ExecSummaryReport_Final.pdf|archivedate=20 December 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continued challenges==

According to the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, the 2007 and 2009 California Health Interview Surveys (CHIS) demonstrate continued mental health needs of almost two million Californians, about half of which were unmet in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Grant |first=David |title=Adult mental health needs and treatment in California |url=http://www.healthpolicy.ucla.edu/pubs/files/mentalhealthfsnov2011.pdf |work=Health policy fact sheet |publisher=UCLA Center for Health Policy Research |accessdate=28 January 2012 |last2=Padilla-Frausto |first2=Imelda |last3=Aydin |first3=May |last4=Streja |first4=Leanne |last5=Aguilar-Gaxiola |first5=Sergio |last6=Patel |first6=Beena |last7=Caldwell |first7=Julia }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of steady tax revenue ($7.4 billion raised as of September 2011&lt;ref name=Yanello&gt;{{cite news|last=Yannello|first=Amy|title=Two-tiered mental-health system|url=http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/two-tiered-mental-health-system/content?oid=3687288|accessdate=28 January 2012|newspaper=Sacramento News &amp; Review|date=September 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) earmarked for the MHSA, the unremittingly high numbers of mentally ill who lack treatment contrast starkly with the implementation of new programs like the FSPs, which may cost tens of thousands of dollars annually per person. The MHA Village program, for example, averages around $18,000 annually per person.&lt;ref name=editorial/&gt; One of the major growing concerns regarding MHSA implementation is its unintentional but worrying tendency to create silos of care.&lt;ref name=Feldman/&gt; As directed by the DMH, counties search for "unserved" mentally ill or at-risk individuals to enroll in their new programs, while keeping existing and perhaps underserved clients in old programs that are usually underfunded, but cannot take MHSA funds.&lt;ref name=Yanello/&gt; Ironically, while the MHSA was established in part to address racial/ethnic disparities in health care,&lt;ref name=Scheffler/&gt; it may be perpetuating the disparity in services delivery between underfunded and well-funded, new programs.

A possible solution to this issue highlights another challenge for the MHSA: the need for more comprehensive evaluation, oversight, and advisory mechanisms. Though there is an accountability commission, the MHSOAC, its oversight and regulatory responsibilities are not well-defined.&lt;ref name=Feldman/&gt; However, it is a relatively new entity, having been created by the MHSA in 2004, and has yet to fully delineate its role in the MHSA. With time, the MHSOAC will hopefully continue to develop towards its stated function. Objective and expert evaluation of the MHSA will also be necessary to achieve the kind of longstanding system-wide improvement that then becomes a model for others.&lt;ref name=Feldman/&gt;

'''The College of Family Physicians of Canada'''' ('''CFPC'''; French: ''Le Collège des médecins de famille du Canada'', '''CFPC'''), which is based in [[Mississauga|Mississauga, Ontario]], is a [[professional association]] and the legal certifying body for the practice of [[family medicine]] in Canada. This national organization of family physicians was founded in 1954, incorporated in 1968,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bylaws: About CFPC: The College of Family Physicians of Canada|url=http://www.cfpc.ca/Bylaws/|website=College of Family Physicians of Canada|publisher=College of Family Physicians of Canada|accessdate=22 February 2015|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and currently numbers over 32,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Missions and Goals: About CFPC: The College of Family Physicians Canada|url=http://www.cfpc.ca/Mission/|website=College of Family Physicians of Canada|publisher=College of Family Physicians of Canada|accessdate=22 February 2015|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the CFPC belong to the national College as well as to their provincial chapters. The CFPC uses both English and French as official languages.

The CFPC establishes the standards for the training, [[certification]], and [[lifelong learning|lifelong education]] of family physicians. It accredits [[postgraduate]] family medicine training in Canada's medical schools, conducts the certification examination in family medicine, and grants the certification (CCFP) and fellowship (FCFP) designations.

The CFPC is a member of the [[World Organization of Family Doctors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Regions and Member Organizations |url=http://www.globalfamilydoctor.com/AboutWonca/Regions.aspx |publisher=World Organization of Family Doctors |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The CFPC was founded in 1954 in Vancouver, British Columbia, as the "College of General Practice of Canada" out of a need to ensure family physicians were dedicated to continuing medical education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=College History: About CFPC: College of Family Physicians of Canada|url=http://www.cfpc.ca/CollegeHistory/|website=College of Family Physicians of Canada|publisher=College of Family Physicians of Canada|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At inception, it had 400 members,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Woods |first=David |title=Strength in Study |date=1979 |publisher=The College of Family Physicians of Canada |location=Toronto |isbn=0-921413-00-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Victor L. Johnston was the first executive director and remained in office for ten years. The first executive committee and board of representatives consisted of 17 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Solomon |first=Stan |title=Patients First: The Story of Family Medicine in Canada |date=2004 |publisher=Key Porter Books |location=Toronto |isbn=1-55263-605-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, the College obtained its current name, "The College of Family Physicians of Canada."

==Governance==

The CFPC is governed by members of the [[executive committee]] and the board. The current executive director and [[chief executive officer]] is Dr.Francine Lemire.

==Collaboration with the Medical Council of Canada==

In 2013, the CFPC collaborated with the [[Medical Council of Canada]] (MCC) to deliver a new "harmonized" certification examination in family medicine. Those who passed the new exam and met all other qualifications of both organizations were awarded both the Licentiate of the MCC (LMCC; the [[medical license]] to practise in Canada) and the certification in family medicine designation (CCFP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Certification in Family Medicine |url=http://mcc.ca/examinations/certification-in-family-medicine/ |publisher=Medical Council of Canada |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon review of the harmonized exam, the CFPC determined that the Certification Examination in Family Medicine did not result in the anticipated benefits for the Certification decision. For this reason, starting in 2016 the exams were again run as two separate examinations, as they were before 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cfpc.ca/Deharmonization_FAQs|title=Deharmonization FAQs {{!}} Certification Examination in Family Medicine {{!}} Education {{!}} The College of Family Physicians Canada|website=www.cfpc.ca|access-date=2016-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuing professional development==

===Mainpro+===
The CFPC runs a program designed to support the continuous professional development of its members called Mainpro+ (Maintenance of Proficiency).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to MAINPRO: Continuing Professional Development: College of Family Physicians of Canada|url=http://www.cfpc.ca/MAINPRO/|website=College of Family Physicians of Canada|publisher=College of Family Physicians of Canada|accessdate=22 February 2015|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program assesses proposed learning modules and seminars against established standards and awards various types and numbers of credits that physicians can earn by participating in these learning opportunities. Credits are recorded and physicians must meet a standard number and type of credits in order to maintain their certification (CCFP) and fellowship (FCFP) designations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Earning Mainpro Credits |url=http://healthsci.queensu.ca/education/cpd/planning_cpd_activities/earning_mainpro_credits |publisher=Queen's University |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Canadian Family Physician''===
{{Main|Canadian Family Physician}}
The CFPC's official monthly journal is ''[[Canadian Family Physician]]''.

Family physicians have the possibility of accumulating MAINPRO credits by "performing brief reflective exercises after reading eligible articles in the journal," thereby contributing to the spread of family medicine stories and experience across the country to the various readers of ''CFP''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Family Physician MAINPRO: Continuing Professional Development: College of Family Physicians of Canada|url=http://www.cfpc.ca/cfpmainpro/|website=College of Family Physicians of Canada|publisher=College of Family Physicians of Canada|accessdate=22 February 2015|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Family Medicine Forum ===
Each year, the CFPC hosts the [http://fmf.cfpc.ca/ Family Medicine Forum] (FMF), a national family medicine conference. The conference offers hundreds of clinical and professional development sessions for family physicians over three days in November. The conference is held at varying host cities and provinces each year. The 2016 FMF will be held in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia|BC]].

=== Research and Education Foundation ===
The Research and Education Foundation of the CFPC was established to provide funding for honours, awards, scholarships, and grants bestowed by the organization to its members. It is a registered charity with the Government of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/ebci/haip/srch/t3010form22QuickView-eng.action?b=888288669RR0001&amp;fpe=2012-12-31&amp;r=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cra-arc.gc.ca%3A80%2Febci%2Fhaip%2Fsrch%2Fbasicsearchresult-eng.action%3Fk%3DResearch%2Band%2BEducation%2BFoundation%26amp%3Bs%3Dregistered%26amp%3Bp%3D1%26amp%3Bb%3Dtrue|title=RESEARCH AND EDUCATION FOUNDATION OF THE COLLEGE OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS OF CANADA/RECHERCHE MEDECINS DE FAMILLE DU CANADA|publisher=[[Canada Revenue Agency]]|accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Choosing Wisely Canada recommendations==
In collaboration with the [[Canadian Medical Association]]'s Forum on General and Family Practice Issues, CFPC released a list of "Eleven Things Physicians and Patients Should Question" as part of the [[Choosing Wisely Canada]] campaign (recommendations 1-5 were released April 2, 2014 and recommendations 6-11 were released October 29, 2014). Canadian specific family medicine recommendations include:

==Enhanced skills programs==
The CFPC recognizes several enhanced skills programs that generally last between three and twelve months. These advanced programs are accessible to practicing family physicians as well as Canadian medical residents who are completing their second year of residency in family medicine. In some cases, the enhanced skills program counts as a third year of residency. The following are some existing enhanced skills programs:
*[[emergency medicine]]
*[[palliative care]]
*[[care of the elderly]]
*[[addiction medicine]]
*maternal and child care
*clinician-scholar program, which requires the completion of a [[Master's degree]] or [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in family medicine
*[[oncology]]

==Student interest groups in family medicine==
Several medical schools in Canada have student interest groups in family medicine, as well as other medical specialties. These student interest groups often organize activities that allow fellow medical students to explore some facets of the medical specialty.

In September 2014, for example, the family medicine student interest group at McGill University hosted the 6th family medicine student symposium. While the conferences took place in the [[McIntyre Medical Sciences Building]], the workshops led by practicing medical doctors and medical residents in family medicine took place in McGill's medical simulation center near the downtown campus.

      <comment>Added detail to intro in regard to deeper breathing pattern increasing IAP</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10023">'''Core stability''' refers to a person's ability to stabilize their [[Core (anatomy)|core]]. Stability, in this context, should be considered as an ability to control the position and movement of the core. Thus, if a person has greater core stability, they have a greater level of control over the position and movement of this area of their body. The body's core is frequently involved in aiding other movements of the body, such as the limbs, and it is considered that by improving core stability a person's ability to perform these other movements may also be improved i.e. core stability training may help improve someone's running ability. The body's core region is sometimes referred to as the [[torso]] or the trunk, although there are some differences in the muscles identified as constituting them. The major muscles involved in core stability include the [[pelvic floor]] muscles, [[transversus abdominis]], [[multifidus]], [[internal obliques|internal]] and [[external obliques]], [[rectus abdominis]], [[erector spinae]] (sacrospinalis) especially the [[longissimus thoracis]], and the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]. The minor muscles involved include the [[latissimus dorsi]], [[gluteus maximus]], and [[trapezius]]. Notably, breathing, including the action of the diaphragm, can significantly influence the posture and movement of the core; this is especially apparent in regard to extreme ranges of inhalation and exhalation. On this basis, how a person is breathing may influence their ability to control their core. 

Some researchers have argued that the generation of intra-abdominal pressure, caused by the activation of the core muscles and especially the transversus abdominis, may serve to lend support to the [[lumbar spine]].&lt;ref&gt;P.W. Hodges, A.E.M. Eriksson, D. Shirley, S.C. Gandevia. 'Lumbar Spine Stiffness is Increased by Intra-Abdominal Pressure' &lt;https://isbweb.org/images/conf/2001/Longabstracts/PDF/0300_0399/0314.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; One way in which intra-abdominal pressure can be increased is by the adoption of a deeper breathing pattern. In this case, and as considered by Hans Lindgren, 'The diaphragm [...] performs its breathing function at a lower position to facilitate a higher IAP.'&lt;ref&gt;http://hanslindgren.com/articles/diaphragm-function-for-core-stability/&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the adoption of a deeper breathing pattern may improve core stability.

Typically, the core is associated with the body's center of gravity, which is over the region of the second sacral vertebrae groups and stability is associated with isometric or static strength. In addition, it is the lumbar spine that is primarily responsible for posture and stability thus providing the strength needed for the stability especially utilized in dynamic sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Michael Yessis |title=Explosive Running |publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.; 1st edition|year=2000 |isbn=978-0-8092-9899-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In practice==
Whenever a person moves, to lift something or simply to move from one position to another, the core region is tensed first{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}. This [[Muscle tone|tension]] is usually made unconsciously and in conjunction with a change in breathing pattern{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}. An example to try is to sit in a chair and to reach forward over a table to pick up a cup. This movement is first accompanied by a tension in the core region of the abdomen and can be felt by placing one hand on the abdomen as the movement is made{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}.

As the load increases the key muscles contract around the viscera, which are in-compressible, to form a stable ball-like core region against which the forces are balanced in coordination with posture.

It is commonly believed that core stability is essential for the maintenance of an upright [[Neutral spine|posture]] and especially for movements and lifts that require extra effort such as lifting a heavy weight from the ground to a table{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}.  Without core stability the lower back is not supported from inside and can be injured by strain caused by the exercise{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}.  It is also believed{{By whom?|date=March 2017}} that insufficient core stability can result in lower back pain and lower limb injuries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}.

There is little support in research for the core stability model and many of the benefits attributed to this method of exercise have not been demonstrated. At best core stability training has the same benefits as general, non-specific exercise&lt;ref&gt;Kriese M, et al Segmental stabilization in low back pain: a systematic review.

==Training methods==
Training methods for developing and maintaining core stability include:
* [[Pilates]]
* [[Exercise ball]], also known as a Swiss ball, stability ball, [[yoga]] ball, [[Pilates]] ball or fitness ball
* [[Yoga]]

==Exercise for strengthening of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine==
The [[cervix|cervical]], [[thoracic]] and [[lumbar]] spine is composed of a total of 24 [[presacral]] [[vertebrae]] and their main functions are to protect the spinal cord, provide an attachment site for many muscles of the body. They also function by distributing one's bodyweight when standing upright.&lt;ref&gt;"Vertebral column". Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2015. Web. 16 Feb. 2015 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/626589/vertebral-column&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many injuries to the spine occur as a result of [[single-vehicle accident|vehicle accidents]], [[falling (accident)|falling]], and [[sports]] and [[recreation]]. While it is impossible to prevent such events from happening, increasing intra-abdominal pressure and strengthening the musculature in the back, along with keeping a neutral spine, can minimize injuries like [[hernia]]s, [[strain (injury)|strain]]s, and [[sprains]].

===Intra-abdominal pressure===
The correlation between having a significant amount of core strength and spinal health has been well documented by many studies in the past. Some of these studies were able to quantify the effects that antagonizing abdominal muscle had on stabilizing the lumbar spine by increasing the amount of intra-abdominal pressure in order to maintain a straight lumbar spine and to avoid rounding during physical activities &lt;ref&gt;Gardner-Morse, M., &amp; Stokes, I. (1998). The Effects of Abdominal Muscle Coactivation on Lumbar Spine Stability. Spine, 23(1), 86-91.&lt;/ref&gt; and using simple techniques such as the “Valsalva maneuver”.&lt;ref&gt;Goldish, MD, G., Quast, MD, J., Blow, MD, J., &amp; Kuskowski, PhD, M. (1994). Postural Effects on Intra-Abdominal Pressure During Valsalva Maneuver. Arch Phys Mad Rehabil ,, Vol75, 324-327.&lt;/ref&gt; A simple exercise used to strengthen the abdominals (rectus abdominis, internal/external obliques, and transverse abdominis) is using the isometric or “static” hold known as [[Plank (exercise)|the plank]].

===Strengthening back musculature===
Simply by working to keep a neutral spine and remembering to increase intra-abdominal pressure before performing a movement that could compromise the spine, you are able to drastically decrease your risk for sustaining a back injury. If you were looking for ways to both strengthen and increase stability of the musculature of the spine one could perform various body weight exercises, for instance the [[Bird dog (exercise)|bird dog exercise]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4191">'''Cuban fever''' (or '''calentura''') was a popular name for a recurring form of tropical fever, sometimes accompanied by acute [[delirium]].&lt;ref name=new&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DC4WAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA758&amp;dq=cuban+fever&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=cuban%20fever&amp;f=false 3 New International Encyclopaedia], p. 758 (Gilman, Peck, &amp; Colby eds. 1902)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, a pathologist established that Cuban fever was a variety of [[malaria]].&lt;ref name=ybook&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jJ8YAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA242&amp;dq=cuban+fever&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1#v=onepage&amp;q=cuban%20fever&amp;f=false ''The International Year Book 1898''], p. 242–43 (Colby &amp; Peck eds. 1899).&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Cuban fever" was coined by [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] Doctor Alexander McCall in his 1845 letter to the ''Boston Medical and Surgical Journal'', describing a very protracted form of "[[Erysipelas|erysipelatous]] fever" he had observed in [[Brazil]], [[Cuba]], and the [[Yucatan Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GbUEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=cuban+fever&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=cuban%20fever&amp;f=false July 1845 Letter, "Erysipelatous Fever,"] 33 ''Boston Medical and Surgical Journal'', p. 135 (1846).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860 social reformer and author [[Julia Ward Howe]] described a condition she observed in a Cuban prison as Cuban fever.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Ward Howe, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vgMZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=Julia+Howe+Cuba+fever&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false A Trip to Cuba], p. 88 (1860).&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase was revived in the [[Spanish–American War]] to refer to a fever prevalent in Cuba and [[the Philippines]],&lt;ref name=new/&gt; that attacked many of the American troops during the War or shortly after their return.&lt;ref name=ybook /&gt; It generally began with a chill and a body temperature of {{nowrap|103 °F}}. As the temperature rose higher, muscular pains began, with headache, loss of appetite, nausea, and marked weakness.&lt;ref name=new/&gt; Many patients spontaneously recovered within a week.&lt;ref name=new /&gt; However, the symptoms would often recur, sometimes daily, and sometimes at intervals of days or weeks.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1899/03/22/117916649.pdf Letter to the Editor, "Chronic Cuban Fever,"] ''New York Times'', p. 6, 1899-03-22.&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Army Major General [[William Rufus Shafter]] was repeatedly sidelined with Cuban fever after he returned home.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1898/09/30/102527732.pdf General Shafter Very Ill]," ''New York Times'' 1899-09-30 at 1; [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1899/04/15/117918827.pdf "General Shafter Ill at Buffalo,"] ''New York Times'', 1899-04-15 at p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to establish a [[retrospective diagnosis]], pathologist [[James Ewing (pathologist)|James Ewing]] of [[New York City]] studied blood samples of 800 patients suffering from the disease, and found that 80 percent of the cases of Cuban fever were of the aestiva-autumnal type of malarial fever, and the remaining 20 percent suffered from tertian malaria.&lt;ref name=ybook /&gt;

After leading the "[[Rough Riders]]" of the 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry in the Spanish–American War, Colonel [[Theodore Roosevelt]], like many of his troops, was diagnosed with Cuban fever.&lt;ref name=teddy&gt;Edmund Morris, ''Theodore Rex: 1901–1909'', p. 377 (2001), {{ISBN|0-394-55509-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Roosevelt's doctors were treating it with drugs, the fever continued to recur long after he left the Army, before, during, and after his presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Henry F. Pringle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=x0WGYBSt2hsC&amp;pg=RA1-PA508&amp;dq=roosevelt+cuban+fever&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=roosevelt%20cuban%20fever&amp;f=false ''Theodore Roosevelt: A Biography''], p. 506 (1931).&lt;/ref&gt; The second part of Edmund Morris's 2001 biography of Roosevelt explains that, when suffering the effects of the disease, the President was discovered outside of his cabin late at night, "completely disoriented," pacing in the snow in his bare feet, holding his hunting dog Skip to his chest.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, ''Theodore Rex: 1901–1909'', p. 382–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dishwashing'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=dishwashing]&lt;/ref&gt; or '''dish washing''', also known as '''washing up''' is the process of [[wikt:cleaning|cleaning]] [[cooking utensil]]s, [[Dish (food)|dishes]], [[cutlery]] and other items to prevent [[foodborne illness]].&lt;ref name=Harder&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harder|first1=Ben|title=How to Wash Up in the Wilderness|url=https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/food-thought/how-wash-wilderness|accessdate=17 April 2017|work=Science News|date=28 October 2014|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is either achieved by hand in a [[sink]] using [[dishwashing detergent]] or by using [[dishwasher]] and may take place in a [[kitchen]], [[utility room]], [[Scullery (room)|scullery]] or elsewhere. In Britain to do the washing up also includes to dry and put away. There are cultural divisions over rinsing and drying after washing.&lt;ref name="BBC America article"&gt;{{cite web|title=The cultural divide on washing dishes: Brits vs. Americans|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/mind-the-gap/2012/10/11/the-cultural-divide-on-washing-dishes-brits-vs-americans/|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implements==
Dish washing is usually done using an implement for the washer to wield, unless done using an automated [[dishwasher]]. Commonly used implements include [[cloth]]s, [[sponge (material)|sponges]], [[brush]]es or even [[steel wool]]. As fingernails are often more effective than soft implements like cloths at dislodging hard particles, washing simply with the hands is also done and can be effective as well. [[Dishwashing detergent]] is also generally used, but bar soap can be used acceptably, as well. [[Rubber gloves]] are often worn when washing dishes by people who are sensitive to hot water or dish-washing liquids. According to dermatologists, the use of protective gloves is highly recommended whenever working with water and cleaning products, since some chemicals may damage the skin, or allergies may develop in some individuals. Dish gloves are also worn by those who simply don't want to touch the old food particles. Many people also wear [[aprons]].

==Running water or sink==
[[File:Washing Dishes.webmhd.webm|thumb|Washing dishes in the United States, 2014]]
A major variation in method is the temperature and state of the water. Asians and Latin Americans usually prefer running water because it is seen as being more hygienic as the water is not being reused, and usually use cold water. This is practical in environments where hot water is rarely available from the tap, and sinks are perceived as dirty surfaces (essentially a convenient drain). Westerners usually prefer standing hot water. This is practical in environments where hot water is cheaply and easily available, and sinks are perceived as clean surfaces (essentially a bowl with a convenient drainage device). In this method, the sink is usually first filled with dirty dishes (which may have already been rinsed and scraped to remove most food) and hot, soapy water. The detergent is added while the sink is filling with water, so a layer of suds forms at the top. Then the dishes are washed one by one and thoroughly rinsed to remove the grease dislodged by soap and mechanical action as well as the soap itself, then placed on a rack to begin drying, or dried and put away immediately by a second person. When the sink is empty, if there are more dishes to be washed they may be added to the same dishwater, or the sink may be drained and refilled if clean, hot dishwater is desired.

===Separate tub in the sink===

In some [[Europe]]an countries, the dishes are generally washed in a separate tub placed inside the sink. This practice may have started as a matter of [[hygiene]], as the kitchen sink was the only sink available for all the household water. The clothes were washed in the sink; the water used to wash the floor went down the sink, and so it made sense to separate the dishwater from the sink. There were two other possible reasons: First, kitchen sinks tended to be very large in a time when heating water was considered to be a major household expense; a tub used less water. Second, kitchen sinks were usually made of hard [[ceramic]]; any contact between the sink and plates was likely to cause chips, but a tub could be made of more forgiving material. Using a separate washing-up bowl in the sink also provides a place (down the gap between bowl and sink) to dispose of unfinished drink, soaking-water, etc. Using the gap for disposal of waste water requires extra vigilance to make sure food particles and other waste are not trapped under the bowl.

==Sanitization==
Where dishes are to be shared among many, such as in [[restaurants]], sanitization is necessary and desirable in order to prevent spread of [[microorganisms]]. Most restaurants have three-compartment sinks (depending on country or state regulations) and use the three-sink system (washing, rinsing and sanitizing of dirty dishes) with the first compartment containing a combination of warm water and soap or detergent. Water within the first compartment often needs to be 95 and 120 degrees °F (according to applicable health codes). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ellibistro.com/washing-dishes-first-compartment-contain/|title=When Washing Dishes In A Three-Compartment Sink, What Should The First Compartment Contain?|work=Elli Bistro|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most institutions have a [[Dishwasher|dish-washing machine]] which sanitizes dishes by a final rinse in either very hot water or a chemical sanitizing solution such as dilute [[Sodium hypochlorite|bleach]] solution (50-100 [[parts per million]] chlorine; about 2&amp;nbsp;ml of 5% bleach per litre of water, approximately one capful of bleach per gallon water). Dishes are placed on large trays and fed onto rollers through the machine. Dishwashers typically exceed {{convert|145|F}} and kill all germs, while hand-washing reaches temperatures of at most {{convert|104|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jaffe|first1=Alexandra|title=It's Settled: Dishwashers Beat the Lowly Hand, Almost Every Time|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/06/its-settled-dishwashers-beat-the-lowly-hand-almost-every-time/258784/|accessdate=17 April 2017|work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While not environmentally friendly, the use of bleach is critical to sanitation when large groups are involved: it evaporates completely, it is cheap, and it kills most germs. [[Cabinet (furniture)|Cabinets]], [[refrigerator]]s, countertops, and anything else touched by people in a large group setting should be periodically wiped or sprayed with a dilute bleach solution after being washed with soapy water and rinsed in clean water.

However, bleach is less effective in the presence of organic debris, so a small amount of food residue can be enough to permit survival of, e.g., [[Salmonella]] bacteria. Scrubbing followed by soaking in bleach is effective at reducing Salmonella contamination, but even this method does not completely eliminate Salmonella bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weese JS, Rousseau J |title=Survival of Salmonella Copenhagen in food bowls following contamination with experimentally inoculated raw meat: effects of time, cleaning, and disinfection |journal=Can.

In hand-washing, plastic brushes with nylon bristles are preferred to washcloths or sponges, which can spread microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JIJD0Ci22s8C&amp;pg=PA190&amp;lpg=PA190&amp;dq=improper+dishwashing+health&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rJBrJtKchs&amp;sig=4VIteN6WnUYBDgbWCCswfgnBFYg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=b7t2S4CiOIeC_QbTqZWrCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false page 190] in {{cite book |author=Michael S.

==Traditional dish-washing practice==
===Indonesia===
Traditionally, dish washing is done by scrubbing the utensils with wet fabric dipped in scrub ash (abu gosok) to scrub away the dirt. The utensils are then rinsed in clean water and hung to drip dry. Scrub ash is specially made by burning wood for dish washing.

==In popular culture==
* [[Dishwasher Pete]], or Pete Jordan, is a fanzine author whose goal was to wash dishes in every state in the United States.
* ''[[The Dishwasher: Dead Samurai]]'' is an Xbox Live Arcade game in which the protagonist is an undead dishwasher.
* ''[[Dishdogz]]'' is a 2005 film about a boy working as a dishwasher during his summer break.
* In his book ''[[Down and Out in Paris and London]]'' by [[George Orwell]], he describes his experience working as a dishwasher or ''plongeur'' in a French hotel in 1929. He describes the job, the interactions with other employees, and his thoughts on the place of a ''plongeur'' in society.

{{Antisemitism}}

The '''Doctors' plot''' ({{lang-ru|дело врачей}}, "doctors' case", also known as the case of '''doctors-saboteurs''' or '''doctors-killers''') was an [[antisemitism in the Soviet Union|antisemitic campaign]] organized by [[Joseph Stalin]]. In 1952–1953, a group of predominantly [[Jew]]ish doctors from Moscow were accused of conspiring to assassinate Soviet leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geschichteinchronologie.com/SU/EncJudaica_doktorverschwoerung-1953-ENGL.html|title="Soviet Union": The Doctors' plot 1953 - Stalin's last purge plan|work=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]|year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later accompanied by publications of anti-Semitic character in the media, which talked about the threats of [[Zionism]] and condemned people with Jewish names. Many doctors, officials and others, both Jews and non-Jews, were promptly dismissed from their jobs and arrested. A few weeks after the [[Joseph Stalin#Death and legacy|death of Stalin]], the new Soviet leadership stated a lack of evidence and the case was dropped. Soon after, the case was declared to have been fabricated.

==Beginnings==
[[Image:Vrachi-timashuk.png|thumb|January 20, 1953. Soviet [[ukaz]] awarding Lydia Timashuk the [[Order of Lenin]] for "unmasking doctors-killers". It was revoked after Stalin's death later that year.]]

The anti-Jewish campaign was presumably set in motion by Stalin as a pretext to dismiss and replace [[Lavrenty Beria]], prosecute other Soviet leaders, to launch a massive purge of the Communist Party, and, according to [[Edvard Radzinsky]], even to consolidate the country for the future [[World War III]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Edvard Radzinsky]], ''[[Stalin: The First In-depth Biography Based on Explosive New Documents from Russia's Secret Archives]]'', Anchor, (1997) {{ISBN|0-385-47954-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Doctors' Plot"&gt;Encyclopedia Britannica, [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/167427/Doctors-Plot ''The Doctors' Plot''], 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Medvedev148&gt;[[#Medvedev2003|Medvedev 2003]], p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951 [[Ministry of State Security (Soviet Union)|Ministry for State Security]] (MGB) investigator [[Mikhail Ryumin]] reported to his superior, [[Viktor Abakumov]], Minister of the MGB, that Professor [[Yakov Gilyarievich Etinger|Yakov Etinger]], who was arrested as a "bourgeois nationalist" with connections to the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee, had committed malpractice in treating [[Andrei Zhdanov]] (died 1948) and [[Alexander Shcherbakov]] (died 1945), allegedly with the intention of killing them. However, Abakumov refused to believe the story. Etinger died in prison (2 March 1951) due to interrogations and harsh conditions. Ryumin was then dismissed from his position in the MGB for misappropriating money and was held responsible for the death of Etinger. With the assistance of [[Georgy Malenkov]], Ryumin wrote a letter to Stalin, accusing Abakumov of killing Etinger in order to hide a conspiracy to kill off the Soviet leadership. On 4 July 1951 the [[Politburo]] set up a commission (headed by Malenkov and including [[Lavrentiy Beria|Beria]]) to investigate the issue. Based on the commission's report, the Politburo soon passed a resolution on the "bad situation in the MGB" and Abakumov was fired.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sebag2005|Sebag-Montefiore 2005]], pp. 611-613.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Medvedev2003|Medvedev 2003]], pp. 150-156.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beria and Malenkov both tried to use the situation to expand their power by gaining control of the MGB.&lt;ref name=Medvedev148/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[[#Zhukov2005|Zhukov 2005]], p. 562.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrests==
Abakumov was arrested and tortured soon after being dismissed as head of the MGB.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSebag2007|Sebag-Montefiore 2007]], pp. 613-614.&lt;/ref&gt; He was charged with being a sympathizer and protector of the criminal Jewish underground.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSebag2007|Sebag-Montefiore 2007]], p. 612.&lt;/ref&gt; This arrest was followed by the arrests of many agents who worked for him in the central apparatus of the MGB, including most Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Medvedev2003|Medvedev 2003]], p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctors-killers case was revived in 1952 when the letter of cardiologist Lydia Timashuk was dug up from the archives. In 1948 Timashuk wrote a letter to the head of Stalin's security, General [[Nikolai Vlasik]], explaining that Zhdanov suffered a heart attack, but the Kremlin doctors who treated him missed it and prescribed the wrong treatment to him. Zhdanov soon died and the doctors covered up their mistake. The letter, however, was originally ignored.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSebag2007|Sebag-Montefiore 2007]], p. 579.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Zhukov|Zhukov 2005]], pp. 579-580&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kremlin doctors involved in the cover up were to be arrested, but they were all Russian. To keep the conspiracy as Zionist, Ryumin and [[Semyon Ignatyev]], who had succeeded Abakumov as head of the MGB, had the Jewish doctors Etinger supposedly specified also added to the arrest list; many of them, like [[Miron Vovsi]], had been consulted by the Kremlin's medical department. The arrests started in September 1952.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Medvedev2003|Medvedev 2003]], pp. 168-170.&lt;/ref&gt; Vlasik was fired as head of Stalin's security and eventually also arrested for ignoring the Timashuk letter.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSebag2004|Sebag-Montefiore 2004]], p. 630.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Zhukov|Zhukov 2005]], pp. 580-581.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, 37 were arrested, but the number quickly grew into hundreds.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Under torture, prisoners seized in the investigation of the alleged plot were compelled to produce evidence against themselves and their associates.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSebag2004|Sebag-Montefiore 2004]], p. 636.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Medvedev181&gt;[[#Medvedev2003|Medvedev 2003]], p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stalin harangued Ignatyev and accused the MGB of incompetence. He demanded that the interrogations of doctors already under arrest be accelerated.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSebag2004|Sebag-Montefiore 2004]], p. 620.&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin complained that there was no clear picture of the Zionist conspiracy and no solid evidence that specifically the Jewish doctors were guilty.&lt;ref name=Medvedev181/&gt;

Newly opened [[KGB]] archives provide evidence that Stalin forwarded the collected interrogation materials to Malenkov, [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]] and other "potential victims of doctors' plot".&lt;ref&gt;Reported by ''[[Izvestia]]'', 1989, p.155; also ''Istochnik'', 1997, p.140&amp;ndash;141.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media campaign==
Stalin ordered TASS and ''Pravda'' to issue reports about the uncovering of a doctors' plot to assassinate top Soviet leaders, including Stalin.&lt;ref name="brent288"&gt;[[#refBrentNaumov2003|Brent &amp; Naumov 2003]], p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gorlizki158"&gt;Gorlizki, Yoram and Oleg Khlevniuk, ''Cold Peace: Stalin and the Soviet Ruling Circle 1945-1953'', Sourcebooks, Inc., 2005 {{ISBN|0-19-530420-9}}, page 158.&lt;/ref&gt; The possible goal of the campaign was to set the stage for show trials.&lt;ref name="zuehlke99"&gt;Zuehlke, Jeffrey, ''Joseph Stalin'', Twenty-First Century Books, 2005, {{ISBN|0-8225-3421-5}}, page 99-101.&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources say that the initiative came from Beria and Malenkov, who continued to use the plot for their own interests. Beria pushed the Politburo to decide to publicize the plot on 9 January 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Zhukov2005|Zhukov 2005]], pp. 591-592.&lt;/ref&gt; For him it was especially important that the Doctors' Plot got more attention than the [[Mingrelian Affair]], which personally affected him.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Medvedev2003|Medvedev 2003]], pp. 180, 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 13, 1953, some of the most prestigious and prominent doctors in the USSR were accused of taking part in a vast plot to poison members of the top Soviet political and military leadership. ''[[Pravda]]'', the official newspaper of the [[CPSU]], reported the accusations under the headline "Vicious Spies and Killers under the Mask of Academic Physicians."
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Today the TASS news agency reported the arrest of a group of saboteur-doctors. This terrorist group, uncovered some time ago by organs of state security, had as their goal shortening the lives of leaders of the Soviet Union by means of medical sabotage.

Investigation established that participants in the terrorist group, exploiting their position as doctors and abusing the trust of their patients, deliberately and viciously undermined their patients' health by making incorrect diagnoses, and then killed them with bad and incorrect treatments. Covering themselves with the noble and merciful calling of physicians, men of science, these fiends and killers dishonored the holy banner of science. Having taken the path of monstrous crimes, they defiled the honor of scientists.

Among the victims of this band of inhuman beasts were Comrades A. A. Zhdanov and A. S. Shcherbakov. The criminals confessed that, taking advantage of the illness of Comrade Zhdanov, they intentionally concealed a myocardial infarction, prescribed inadvisable treatments for this serious illness and thus killed Comrade Zhdanov. Killer doctors, by incorrect use of very powerful medicines and prescription of harmful regimens, shortened the life of Comrade Shcherbakov, leading to his death.

The majority of the participants of the terrorist group… were bought by American intelligence. They were recruited by a branch-office of American intelligence &amp;mdash; the international Jewish [[bourgeois nationalism|bourgeois-nationalist]] organization called "[[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee|Joint]]." The filthy face of this Zionist spy organization, covering up their vicious actions under the mask of charity, is now completely revealed…

Unmasking the gang of poisoner-doctors struck a blow against the international Jewish Zionist organization.... Now all can see what sort of philanthropists and "friends of peace" hid beneath the sign-board of "Joint."

Other participants in the terrorist group (Vinogradov, M. Kogan, Egorov) were discovered, as has been presently determined, to have been long-time agents of English intelligence, serving it for many years, carrying out its most criminal and sordid tasks. The bigwigs of the USA and their English junior partners know that to achieve domination over other nations by peaceful means is impossible. Feverishly preparing for a new world war, they energetically send spies inside the USSR and the people's democratic countries: they attempt to accomplish what the Hitlerites could not do &amp;mdash; to create in the USSR their own subversive "fifth column."...

The Soviet people should not for a minute forget about the need to heighten their vigilance in all ways possible, to be alert for all schemes of war-mongers and their agents, to constantly strengthen the Armed Forces and the intelligence organs of our government.&lt;ref name="Vicious Spies and Killers under the Mask of Academic Physicians"&gt;{{cite news|title=Vicious Spies and Killers under the Mask of Academic Physicians|date=13 January 1953|url=http://www.cyberussr.com/rus/vrach-ubijca-e.html|work=Pravda|pages=one}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Among other famous names mentioned were [[Solomon Mikhoels]] (actor-director of the [[Moscow State Jewish Theater]] and the head of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee, assassinated in January 1948&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mk.ru/editions/daily/article/2005/09/06/191944-kak-ubivali-mihoelsa.html|script-title=ru:Как убивали Mихоэлса|trans-title=How They Killed Mikhoels|work=[[Moskovsky Komsomolets]]|date=September 6, 2005|accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), who was called a "well-known Jewish bourgeois nationalist," Miron Vovsi ([[psychotherapy|therapist]], Stalin's personal physician and a cousin of Mikhoels), V. Vinogradov (therapist), [[Mikhail Kogan]] (therapist), Boris Kogan (therapist), P. Yegorov (therapist), A. Feldman ([[otolaryngology|otolaryngologist]]), [[Yakov Gilyarievich Etinger|Yakov Etinger]] (therapist), A. Grinshtein ([[neuropathology|neuropathologist]]) and G. Mayorov (therapist).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Medvedev2003|Medvedev 2003]], p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; Six of the nine mentioned doctors were Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Zhukov2005|Zhukov 2005]], p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt;

The list of alleged victims included high-ranked officials [[Andrei Zhdanov]], [[Alexander Shcherbakov|Aleksandr Shcherbakov]], Army Marshals [[Aleksandr Vasilevsky]], [[Leonid Govorov]] and [[Ivan Konev]], General [[Sergei Shtemenko]], Admiral [[Gordey Levchenko]] and others.

Stalin intended to publish in Pravda a letter signed by many well-known Soviet Jews in which the Jews involved in the plot would be denounced, but the difference between them and the rest of the Soviet Jews, who are loyal to the USSR and socialism, would be made clear. Two versions of the letter were created, but it was never published. Either Stalin eventually decided not to publish it or it was still being worked on by the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Medvedev2003|Medvedev 2003]], pp. 204-209.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stalin's death and the consequences==
After Stalin's death on March 5, 1953, the new leadership quickly dismissed all charges related to the plot; the doctors were exonerated in a March 31 decree by the newly appointed Minister of Internal Affairs, [[Lavrentiy Beria]], and on April 6, this was communicated to the public in ''[[Pravda]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBrentNaumov2003|Brent &amp; Naumov 2003]], pp. 324-325.&lt;/ref&gt; Chief [[Ministry for State Security (USSR)|MGB]] investigator and Deputy Minister of State Security [[Mikhail Ryumin]] was accused of fabricating the plot, arrested and later executed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSebag2004|Sebag-Montefiore 2004]], p. 644n.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Komsomol]] official Nikolai Mesyatsev was assigned by [[Malenkov]] to review the Doctors' Plot case and quickly found that it was fabricated.&lt;ref name=Mesyatev&gt;{{cite interview|author=Mesyatev, Nikolai |title=Беседа с легендарным «комсомольцем» Н.Н.Месяцевым накануне его 90-лети|trans-title=Conversation With the Legendary "Komsomol" Official N.

==Khrushchev's statements==
In his 1956 "[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|Secret Speech]]", First Secretary [[Nikita Khrushchev]] stated that the Doctors' plot was "fabricated... set up by Stalin," but that Stalin did not "have the time in which to bring it to an end," which saved the doctors' lives.&lt;ref name=secretspeech/&gt; Khrushchev also told the session that Stalin called the judge in the case and, regarding the methods to be used, stated "beat, beat and, beat again."&lt;ref name=secretspeech&gt;Kruschev, Nikita, [//web.archive.org/web/20051107221432/http://www.uwm.edu/Course/448-343/index12.html ''SPECIAL REPORT TO THE 20TH CONGRESS OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF THE SOVIET UNION''], Closed session, February 24–25, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin supposedly told his Minister of State Security, "If you do not obtain confessions from the doctors we will shorten you by a head."&lt;ref name=secretspeech/&gt;

Khrushchev also claimed that Stalin hinted to him to incite antisemitism in Ukraine, saying, "The good workers at the factory should be given clubs so they can beat the hell out of those Jews."&lt;ref&gt;Pinkus, Benjamin, ''The Soviet Government and the Jews 1948-1967: A Documented Study'', Cambridge University Press, 1984, {{ISBN|0-521-24713-6}}, pages 107-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brackman390"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brackman|2001|p=390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Khrushchev, Stalin told Politburo members, "You are blind like young kittens. What will happen without me? The country will perish because you do not know how to recognize enemies."&lt;ref name=secretspeech/&gt;

==Planned deportation of Jews==
In his [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|Secret Speech]] at the Communist Party's [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Twentieth Congress]], Nikita Khrushchev asserted that Stalin intended to use the Doctors' trial to launch a massive purge of the Communist Party.&lt;ref name="The Doctors' Plot"/&gt; In addition, a number of new labor camps were built in Siberia, allegedly to deport most of the Soviet Jewish population to Siberia, similar to [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deportations of many other ethnic minorities in the Soviet Union]], but the plan was not accomplished because of the sudden death of Stalin. According to [[Louis Rapoport]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Soviet "Doctors' Plot"—50 years on|author= A Mark Clarfield|journal=[[The BMJ|British Medical Journal]]|year=2002|volume=325|issue=7378|pages=1487–1489|pmid=12493677|pmc=139050}}&lt;/ref&gt; the genocide was planned to start from the public execution of the imprisoned doctors, and then the "following incidents would follow": "attacks on Jews orchestrated by the secret police, the publication of the statement by the prominent Jews, and a flood of other letters demanding that action be taken. A three-stage program of genocide would be followed. First, almost all Soviet Jews ... would be shipped to camps east of the Urals . . . Second, the authorities would set Jewish leaders at all levels against one another ... Also the MGB [Secret Police] would start killing the elites in the camps, just as they had killed the Yiddish writers ... the previous year. The ... final stage would be to “get rid of the rest."

Four large camps were built shortly before Stalin's death in 1953 in southern and western Siberia, with rumors swirling that they were for Jews.&lt;ref name="brent295"&gt;[[#refBrentNaumov2003|Brent &amp; Naumov 2003]], p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; A special "Deportation Commission" to plan the deportation of Jews to these camps has been reportedly created.&lt;ref name="brackman388"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brackman|2001|p=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brent47"&gt;[[#refBrentNaumov2003|Brent &amp; Naumov 2003]], pp. 47–48, 295.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eisenstadt"&gt;Eisenstadt, Yaakov, ''Stalin's Planned Genocide'', 22 Adar 5762, March 6, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Nikolay Poliakov, the secretary of the "Commission", stated years later that, according to Stalin's initial plan, the deportation was to begin in the middle of February 1953, but the monumental tasks of compiling lists of Jews had not yet been completed.&lt;ref name="brackman388"/&gt;&lt;ref name=eisenstadt/&gt; "Pure blooded" Jews were to be deported first, followed by "[[Half-Jewish|half-breeds]]" (''polukrovki'').&lt;ref name="brackman388"/&gt; Before his death in March 1953, Stalin allegedly had planned the execution of Doctors' plot defendants already on trial in Red Square in March 1953, and then he would cast himself as the savior of Soviet Jews by sending them to camps away from the purportedly enraged Russian populace.&lt;ref name="brackman388"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brent298"&gt;[[#refBrentNaumov2003|Brent &amp; Naumov 2003]], pp. 298–300.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solzhenitzin, Alexander, ''The Gulag Archipelago'', 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; There are further statements that describe some aspects of such a planned deportation.&lt;ref name=eisenstadt/&gt;

[[Yakov Yakovlevich Etinger|Yakov Etinger]] described how former [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU Politburo]] member [[Nikolai Bulganin]] said that Stalin asked him in the end of February 1953 to prepare railroad cars for the mass deportation of Jews to Siberia&lt;ref name="Etinger"&gt;[https://www.sakharov-center.ru/asfcd/auth/?t=page&amp;num=9997 Y.

Зимарин. - М. : Весь мир, 2001. - 272 с, pages 104-106.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a book by another Soviet Politburo member [[Alexander Yakovlev (Russian politician)|Alexander Yakovlev]],&lt;ref&gt;Александр Яковлев, ''По мощам и елей'' (Russian), {{ISBN|5-88268-015-8}}, 1995, [https://www.livelib.ru/book/1001223657/about-po-moscham-i-elej-aleksandr-yakovlev link]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Etinger"/&gt; Stalin started preparations for the deportation of Jews in February 1953 and ordered to prepare a letter from a group of notable Soviet Jews with request to the Soviet government to carry out the mass deportation of Jews in order to save them from "the just wrath of Soviet people." The letter had to be published in the newspaper [[Pravda]] and was found later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vestnik.com/issues/2000/0314/koi/erenburg.htm|title=ПИСЬМО И.Г.ЭРЕНБУРГА К И.В.СТАЛИНУ [KOI-8]|work=vestnik.com|date=14 March 2000|accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian Samson Madiyevsky, the deportation was definitely considered, and the only thing in doubt is the time-frame.&lt;ref name="archive.svoboda.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.svoboda.org/programs/RT/1999/RT.080599.asp|title=Radio Liberty - Programs - Round Table|publisher=Archive.svoboda.org|accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://journals.openedition.org/monderusse/59|title=1953: la déportation des juifs soviétiques était-elle programmée|author=Madievski, Samson|volume=41|issue=4|year=2000|pages=561–568}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/179628|author=Brandenberger, David|title=Project MUSE - Stalin's Last Crime?

==Fundraising==
[[File:Usaeasterseals1930s.jpg|thumb|American Easter Seals from the 1930s]]

90% of funds raised go to Easterseals disability services across the nation. Easterseals was ranked 1st by the National Health Council for more than 25 years.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.easterseals.com/who-we-are/faqs/|title=Frequently Asked Questions|website=www.easterseals.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Easterseals’ funding sources include government grants and agency programs, donations, and fee-for-service initiatives. Donations help the organization provide affordable offerings to clients while maintaining program costs. Easterseals serves about 1.3 million individuals per year.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The name "Easter Seals" derived from an earlier fundraising program: beginning in 1934, colorful adhesive seals, the size of postage stamps, were sold around Easter; purchasers stuck these on mailed envelopes to demonstrate their support for the organization. Because of the program’s success, the organization changed its name from "the National Society for Crippled Children" to "Easter Seals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.easterseals.com/its-easter-this-sunday-is-that-why-were-called-easter-seals/ |title=It’s Easter this Sunday – is that why we’re called Easter Seals? |author=Beth |date=April 3, 2015 |work=Easter Seals blog |accessdate=October 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have since changed their name to "Easterseals."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 2003, Easterseals started "Walk With Me" events across the country. Thousands of people have attended these events over the years, generating millions of dollars for disability services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://secure2.convio.net/es/site/SPageServer/?pagename=wwm_learn_aboutwalk|title=Learn About Walk With Me - Easter Seals|website=secure2.convio.net|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Easterseals expanded the "seal" program through introducing the "Easterseals Blanket." The image on the blanket is chosen through an online vote for the Lily Seal of the Year. Artists submit depictions of lilies to be featured on the blanket.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://postalmuseum.si.edu/americasmailingindustry/Easterseals.html|title=Easterseals|website=postalmuseum.si.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislative action==
Since the 1920s, Easterseals has worked with federal, state, and local officials to advance legislation for people with disabilities and disability services. This includes the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] (ADA). Passed in 1990, the ADA guarantees the [[civil rights]] of people with disabilities and prohibits discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.easterseals.com/get-involved/advocacy/|title=Take Action!|website=www.easterseals.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Easterseals also created a public service campaign that highlighted accessibility and employment issues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.easterseals.com/who-we-are/history/historical-ada-campaign.html|title=Historical ADA Campaign Posters|website=www.easterseals.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be addressed by the ADA’s implementation.

Today, Easterseals continues to advocate for policies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.easterseals.com/get-involved/advocacy/|title=Take Action!|website=www.easterseals.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; that support people with disabilities.

==Structure==

===Headquarters===
Easterseals headquarters offices in the [[Chicago Board of Trade Building|Board of Trade Building]] in [[Chicago]] and in [[Washington, D.C.]] provide assistance to 75 [[Affiliate (commerce)|affiliate]]s through management training, implementation of [[best practice]]s, [[consultant|consultation]] services, [[fundraising]], [[marketing]], advocacy, and corporate relations.

===Affiliates and service sites===
Nationwide, Easterseals' 75 locations provide services to people with disabilities and [[special needs]] in their local communities. Each location operates independently as its own 501(c)3 corporation under the Easterseals name.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Board of Directors and House of Delegates===
Easterseals is governed by a National Board of Directors, which is composed of volunteers, most of whom are nominated by one of the organization’s approximately 75 affiliates across the country. Elections to the Board, composed of between 15 and 19 members, are held annually by another larger volunteer body, Easterseals National House of Delegates. Directors are elected for three-year terms, and terms are staggered to achieve strength and continuity on the board.

Easterseals National House of Delegates consists of volunteers certified by their affiliates to represent them as delegates at the organization’s annual convention, thus ensuring broad representation of Easterseals affiliates nationwide. In addition to the numerous training and motivational sessions offered to Easterseals board members, delegates and affiliate staff throughout the convention, the Annual Meeting of the House takes place, when the house elects new members to the national board and addresses any other motions put before it.

In January 2014, El Ouardi was physically assaulted while exiting the parliament in Rabat. His assailants were members of the pharmacists union/lobby, and one of them was the brother-in-law of [[Fouad Ali El Himma]], the influential advisor and close-friend of [[Mohammed VI]], in addition to being the cousin of the [[Party of Authenticity and Modernity]] female Mayor of [[Marrakesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=لماذا لم يطرد حزب البام إلياس العماري بتهمة تحريض الصيادلة|newspaper=الأسبوع|date=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident resulted in minor injuries for the minister.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9318">'''[[Emergency medical services]] in [[Iceland]]''' include the provision of [[ambulance]] service. They provide all emergency ambulance service for a population of in excess of 320,000 people in one of the most sparsely settled countries in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jephc.com/full_article.cfm?content_id=419|title=Ambulance Transport and Services in the Rural Areas of Iceland, Scotland and Sweden (JEPHC webpage)|accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system is government-funded for the first 85 percent of cost, with 15 percent being charged to the individual as a deterrent fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iceland.is/people-and-society/Health/|title=Health Services Iceland (gov't website)|accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; All services in Iceland are provided by the Icelandic [[Red Cross]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifrc.org/docs/profiles/isprofile.pdf |title=Icelandic Red Cross (IFRC website) |accessdate=2009-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114173750/http://www.ifrc.org/docs/profiles/isprofile.pdf |archivedate=January 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with individual ambulances often co-located with local fire brigades.

==Organization==

===Land ambulance===
There are currently approximately 77 operational land ambulances in Iceland. These are distributed across almost all communities, usually at fire stations. They are owned and equipped by the Icelandic Red Cross, but are crewed by fire service personnel. In larger centres, such as [[Reykjavík]], the ambulances are staffed by full-time, paid [[Emergency medical technicians]].
In smaller centres, EMTs may be part-time, or even on-call from home in some cases. All ambulance personnel are either the equivalent of [[EMT-B]] or [[EMT-I]]. Staffing of ambulances is normally 2 people, with two EMT-Bs, or, where available, an EMT-B and an EMT-I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ems.is/|title=Centre for EMS Education (1) (webpage) (in Icelandic)|accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paramedics]] are usually found only in Reykjavík, which operates a single, [[Advanced Life Support]] ambulance with a crew of three. Ambulances are organized according to the country's multiple Health Service Districts, but are centrally dispatched. At 2014 the ambulances were converted Mercedes vans.

File:Rescue vehicle Iceland Heimaey.jpg|Rural Ambulance/Rescue Vehicle
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Air ambulance===
[[File:AS-365N Dauphin 2 of The Iceland Coast Guard.JPEG|thumb|Icelandic Coast Guard Air Ambulance]]
Because of the sparse population, bad weather, and large numbers of [[airports]], most [[air ambulance]] service in Iceland is accomplished using [[fixed-wing aircraft]]. The government of Iceland has contracted out this service since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jephc.com/full_article.cfm?content_id=419|title=Air Ambulance (JEPHC website)|accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The type of aircraft normally used is a [[Beechcraft Super King Air]] 200 operated by the airline [[Mýflug]] (Myflug Air). [[Mýflug]] has one dedicated air ambulance in Iceland, based at [[Akureyri]], the site of the country's second largest hospital. There are normally 2 aircraft available (one dedicated, one as a charter), with a third charter aircraft being provided during the winter months.
When weather conditions or other circumstances make fixed-wing inappropriate, the system has access to three [[helicopters]] ([[Aerospatiale Dauphin]] or [[Super Puma]]) operated by the [[Icelandic Coast Guard]], and based at Reykjavík. On medical missions, Coast Guard helicopters are normally staffed by [[physicians]]. Iceland's Air Ambulance system responds to approximately 450 fixed-wing calls per year, and an additional 130-160 helicopter calls per year.

===Model of care===
An attempt to describe the model of care used quickly becomes complex. At the ALS end of the spectrum, the model closely resembles the German version of the Franco-German model,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dick WF |title=Anglo-American vs. Franco-German emergency medical services system |journal=Prehosp Disaster Med |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=29–35; discussion 35–7 |year=2003 |pmid=14694898 |doi= 10.1017/s1049023x00000650|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with paramedics working with and under the direction of a physician. This represents, however, only the 5 percent of EMS personnel in the entire country who are paramedics, and only a single ambulance, out of 77 units in service. For the balance, the model much more closely resembles the Anglo-American model,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Cooke MW, Bridge P, Wilson S |title=Variation in emergency ambulance dispatch in Western Europe|journal=The Scandinavian Journal of Trauma and Emergency Medicine|volume=9|issue=2|pages=57–66|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; with EMTs making their own treatment decisions based upon local guidelines, albeit at a [[basic life support]] level, or at best, with the limited skill set of an EMT-I.

==Training==

===Basic and Intermediate===
There is not currently an official national training standard for EMS personnel in Iceland. As a result, the training levels which operate by default are those currently in use in the [[United States]]. Training for EMT Basic, and EMT Intermediate are directly comparable with the U.S. standards. These are conducted by the Icelandic Centre for EMS Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ems.is/|title=Centre for EMS Education (2) (webpage) (in Icelandic)|accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paramedic===
There are currently only about 20 paramedics in the whole of Iceland, out of a total of approximately 400 certified EMS staff. Since paramedic training is currently unavailable in Iceland, all of these were trained and certified in the United States at the Center for Emergency Medicine located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McDevitt B |title=On top of the world. Iceland delivers high-quality EMS |journal=JEMS |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=62–7 |date=February 2004 |pmid=14990899 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paramedics work within a sharply limited and small scope of practice in Iceland. There is a single ALS land ambulance, located in Reykjavík, and staffed by a paramedic and a physician. Paramedics are also sometimes used to provide care on air ambulance transports. Paramedics completing training in the U.S. are validated and certified by the Centre for EMS Education.

===Skills===
There is, at the moment, no governing legislation regarding the practice of EMS personnel in Iceland. This is particularly critical with respect to the administration of medications, and is one of the reasons why Icelandic paramedics almost always work in partnership with a physician who is physically present on the scene. The Icelandic Parliament has assigned responsibility for oversight to the various local health authorities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.althingi.is/lagas/nuna/1990097.html|title=Icelandic Parliament website (in Icelandic)|accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, as a result, there is considerable variation in permissible skills. The following, while far from complete, will serve as a general overview of permissible skills at the various levels of training:

====EMT-Basic====
*Automatic External Defibrillator
*Supraglottal Airways (Laryngeal Mask, Laryngeal Tube, Fast Trach)

====EMT-Intermediate====
*Automatic External Defibrillator
*Supraglottal Airways (Laryngeal Mask, Laryngeal Tube, Fast Trach)
*IV initiation
*Use of Epinephrine in Cardiac Arrest

====EMT-Paramedic====
*Manual Defibrillation
*Supraglottal Airways (Laryngeal Mask, Laryngeal Tube, Fast Trach)
*IV initiation
*Use of Epinephrine in Cardiac Arrest
*Endotracheal Intubation
*Needle Cricothyrotomy

==Communications==
Iceland uses the [[Europe]]an [[emergency telephone number]] [[1-1-2|112]] for all emergencies. Dispatch, which used to be a local function, merged into two dispatch centres, and is in the process of merging into a single, integrated dispatch centre for all three emergency services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apdcomms.com/assets/pdf/APDcasestudy-icelandic-police.pdf|title=Iceland Police, Fire and Ambulance (APD Communications Ltd. website)|accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new system involves both [[Computer Aided Dispatch|CAD]] and also [[satellite]]-based automatic vehicle locating for all emergency vehicles, with plans to expand the system to include snowplows and sanders in order to expedite emergency responses in bad weather. The system dispatches an estimated 22,000 EMS calls per year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4384">A '''functional murmur''' ('''innocent murmur''', '''physiologic murmur''') is a [[heart murmur]] that is primarily due to physiologic conditions outside the heart, as opposed to structural defects in the heart itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|five/000068109|functional murmur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serious conditions can arise even in the absence of a primary heart defect, and it is possible for peripheral conditions to generate abnormalities in the heart. Therefore, caution should be applied to use of the terms "innocent" or "benign" in this context.

Use of the term dates to the mid 19th century.&lt;ref name="pmid14365576"&gt;{{cite journal |author=LUISADA AA |title=The functional murmur: the laying to rest of a ghost |journal=Dis Chest |volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=579–81 |date=May 1955 |pmid=14365576 |doi= |url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14365576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benign pediatric heart murmur==
Functional murmurs are an important consideration in the precordial examination of an infant or child.

===Characteristics===
*Soft, less than 3/6 in intensity (although note that even when structural heart disease is present, intensity does not predict severity.)
*Often position-dependent. Murmurs heard while supine and may disappear when upright or sitting.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Biancaniello. [http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/111/3/e20.full Innocent Murmurs] ''[[Circulation (journal)|Circulation]]''. 2005; 111: e20-e22.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Otherwise healthy individual, no concerns about growth, no symptoms of [[heart failure]] such as dyspnea on exertion. (In infants, ask if the baby cries during feeding, becomes diaphoretic, or develops a rapid respiratory rate. In older children, this can be elucidated by asking whether or not the child can keep up with peers during play.)
*Occurs during systole or continuously during both systole and diastole. (Murmurs occurring only during diastole are usually pathologic, but can also be heard during hyperdynamic states.)
*Physiologic splitting of S2 (A2 and P2 components should only be resolvable during inspiration and should merge during expiration.)
*No palpable thrill (A thrill is a vibration caused by turbulent blood flow.)

===Prognosis===
Innocent murmurs are inconsequential&lt;ref name="urlInnocent Heart Murmurs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/More/HeartValveProblemsandDisease/Innocent-Heart-Murmur_UCM_450621_Article.jsp |title=Innocent Heart Murmurs |format= |work= |accessdate=Jan 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and usually disappear as the [[child]] grows. ECG and Chest XRAY are normal.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Gilbert's syndrome''' ('''GS''') is a mild [[liver disease|liver disorder]] in which the [[liver]] does not properly process [[bilirubin]].&lt;ref name=GARD2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Gilbert syndrome|url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6507/gilbert-syndrome|website=GARD|accessdate=2 July 2017|language=en|date=2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804052908/https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6507/gilbert-syndrome|archivedate=4 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people never have symptoms.&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt; Occasionally a slight [[jaundice|yellowish color of the skin or whites of the eyes]] may occur.&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt; Other possible symptoms include feeling tired, weakness, and abdominal pain.&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Gilbert's syndrome is due to a [[mutation]] in the [[UGT1A1 gene]] which results in decreased activity of the [[bilirubin uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase]]  enzyme.&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=GHR2017/&gt; It is typically inherited in an [[autosomal recessive]] pattern and occasionally in an [[autosomal dominant]] pattern depending on the type of mutation.&lt;ref name=GHR2017/&gt; Episodes of jaundice may be triggered by stress such as exercise, [[menstruation]], or not eating.&lt;ref name=GHR2017&gt;{{cite web|title=Gilbert syndrome|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/gilbert-syndrome|website=Genetics Home Reference|accessdate=2 July 2017|language=en|date=27 June 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170627221429/https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/gilbert-syndrome|archivedate=27 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diagnosis is based on higher levels of [[unconjugated bilirubin]] in the blood without either signs of other [[liver problems]] or [[hemolysis|red blood cell breakdown]].&lt;ref name=Rare2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=GHR2017/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment, epidemiology, and history --&gt;
Typically no treatment is needed.&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt; If jaundice is significant [[phenobarbital]] may be used.&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt; Gilbert's syndrome affects about 5% of people in the United States.&lt;ref name=GHR2017/&gt; Males are more often diagnosed than females.&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt; It is often not noticed until late childhood to early adulthood.&lt;ref name=Rare2015/&gt; The condition was first described in 1901 by [[Augustin Nicolas Gilbert]].&lt;ref name=Rare2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHO2017&gt;{{cite web|title=Whonamedit - dictionary of medical eponyms|url=http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/2877.html|website=www.whonamedit.com|accessdate=2 July 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918015240/http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/2877.html|archivedate=18 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==

===Jaundice===
Gilbert's syndrome produces an elevated level of unconjugated bilirubin in the [[blood]]stream, but normally has no serious consequences. Mild [[jaundice]] may appear under conditions of exertion, stress, fasting, and infections, but the condition is otherwise usually asymptomatic.&lt;ref&gt;Kasper et al., ''Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine'', 16th edition, McGraw-Hill 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boon et al., ''Davidson's Principles &amp; Practice of Medicine'', 20th edition, Churchill Livingstone 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Severe cases are seen by yellowing of the skin tone and yellowing of the sclera in the eye.

GS has been reported to possibly contribute to an accelerated onset of [[neonatal jaundice]], especially in the presence of increased [[hemolysis|red blood cell destruction]] due to diseases such as [[G6PD deficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bancroft JD, Kreamer B, Gourley GR |title=Gilbert syndrome accelerates development of neonatal jaundice |journal=Journal of Pediatrics | volume=132 |issue=4 |pages=656–60 |year=1998 |pmid=9580766 |doi=10.1016/S0022-3476(98)70356-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cappellini MD, Di Montemuros FM, Sampietro M, Tavazzi D, Fiorelli G |title=The interaction between Gilbert's syndrome and G6PD deficiency influences bilirubin levels |journal=British Journal of Haematology | volume=104 |issue=4 |pages=928–9 |year=1999 |pmid=10192462 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2141.1999.1331a.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This situation can be especially dangerous if not quickly treated, as the high bilirubin causes irreversible neurological disability in the form of [[kernicterus]].

===Detoxification of certain drugs===
The enzymes that are defective in GS - [[UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1]] (UGT1A1) - are also responsible for some of the [[liver]]'s ability to [[detoxification|detoxify]] certain drugs. For example, Gilbert's syndrome is associated with severe diarrhea and [[neutropenia]] in patients who are treated with [[irinotecan]], which is metabolized by UGT1A1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marcuello E, Altés A, Menoyo A, Del Rio E, Gómez-Pardo M, Baiget M | title=UGT1A1 gene variations and irinotecan treatment in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer | journal=Br J Cancer | volume=91 | issue=4 | pages=678–82 | year=2004 | pmid=15280927 | doi=10.1038/sj.bjc.6602042 | pmc=2364770}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) is not metabolized by UGT1A1,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rauchschwalbe S, Zuhlsdorf M, Wensing G, Kuhlmann J | title=Glucuronidation of acetaminophen is independent of UGT1A1 promotor genotype | journal=Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther | volume=42 | issue=2 | pages=73–7 | year=2004 | pmid=15180166 | doi=10.5414/cpp42073}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is metabolized by one of the other enzymes also deficient in some people with GS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kohle C, Mohrle B, Munzel PA, Schwab M, Wernet D, Badary OA, Bock KW | title=Frequent co-occurrence of the TATA box mutation associated with Gilbert's syndrome (UGT1A1*28) with other polymorphisms of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-1 locus (UGT1A6*2 and UGT1A7*3) in Caucasians and Egyptians | journal=Biochem Pharmacol | volume=65 | issue=9 | pages=1521–7 | year=2003 | pmid=12732365 | doi=10.1016/S0006-2952(03)00074-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=esteban&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Esteban A, Pérez-Mateo M |title=Heterogeneity of paracetamol metabolism in Gilbert's syndrome |journal=European Journal of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=9–13 |year=1999 |pmid=10412886 |doi=10.1007/BF03190005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subset of people with GS may have an increased risk of paracetamol toxicity.&lt;ref name=esteban/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mukherjee"/&gt;

===Cardiovascular effects===
Several analyses have found a significantly decreased risk of [[coronary artery disease]] (CAD) in individuals with GS.&lt;ref name="2002meta"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ladislav Novotnýc |author2=Libor Vítek |title=Inverse Relationship Between Serum Bilirubin and Atherosclerosis in Men: A Meta-Analysis of Published Studies |journal=Experimental Biology and Medicine |issue=  5|pages=568–571 |year=2003 |pmid=12709588 |volume=228 |doi=10.1177/15353702-0322805-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2008meta"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Schwertner Harvey A |author2=Vítek Libor | title=Gilbert syndrome, UGT1A1*28 allele, and cardiovascular disease risk: possible protective effects and therapeutic applications of bilirubin | journal=Atherosclerosis |volume=198| issue=1 | pages=1–11 |date= May 2008|pmid=18343383 | doi=10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2008.01.001|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1258770|type=Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, people with mildly elevated levels of bilirubin (1.1&amp;nbsp;mg/dl to 2.7&amp;nbsp;mg/dl) were at lower risk for CAD and at lower risk for future heart disease.&lt;ref name="Vitek GS ischemic"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vítek L |title=Gilbert syndrome and ischemic heart disease: a protective effect of elevated bilirubin levels |journal=Atherosclerosis |volume=160 |issue=2 |pages=449–56 |year=2002|pmid=11849670 |doi=10.1016/S0021-9150(01)00601-3 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0021915001006013|author2= Jirsa M |author3= Brodanová M  |displayauthors=etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt; These researchers went on to perform a [[meta-analysis]] of data available up to 2002, and confirmed the incidence of [[Atherosclerosis|atherosclerotic disease]] (hardening of the arteries) in subjects with GS had a close and inverse relationship to the serum bilirubin.&lt;ref name="2002meta" /&gt; This beneficial effect was attributed to bilirubin IXα which is recognized as a potent antioxidant, rather than [[confounding]] factors such as [[high-density lipoprotein]] levels.&lt;ref name="Vitek GS ischemic"/&gt;

This association was also seen in long-term data from the [[Framingham Heart Study]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Lin JP | title=Association between the UGT1A1*28 allele, bilirubin levels, and coronary heart disease in the Framingham Heart Study | journal=Circulation | volume=114 | pages=1476–81 | year=2006 | pmid=17000907 | doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.633206 | issue=14| author2= O’Donnell CJ | author3= Schwaiger JP  | displayauthors=etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2018}} Moderately elevated levels of bilirubin in people with GS and the (TA)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;/(TA)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; genotype were associated with one-third the risk for both coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease as compared to those with the (TA)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/(TA)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; genotype (i.e. a normal, nonmutated gene locus).

Platelet counts and [[Mean platelet volume|MPV]] are decreased in patients with Gilbert's Syndrome. The elevated levels of bilirubin and decreasing levels of MPV and [[C-reactive protein|CRP]] in Gilbert's syndrome patients may have an effect on the slowing down of the [[Atherosclerosis|atherosclerotic]] process.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

===Other===
Symptoms, whether connected or not to GS, have been reported in a subset of those affected: feeling tired all the time (fatigue), difficulty maintaining concentration, unusual patterns of anxiety, loss of appetite, nausea, abdominal pain, loss of weight, itching (with no rash), and others,&lt;ref name=GSC&gt;[http://www.gilbertssyndrome.com/ GilbertsSyndrome.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060810065536/http://www.gilbertssyndrome.com/ |date=2006-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but scientific studies found no clear pattern of adverse symptoms related to the elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin in adults. However, other substances glucuronidized by the affected enzymes in Gilbert's syndrome sufferers could theoretically, at their toxic levels, cause these symptoms.&lt;ref name=dispute&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olsson R, Bliding A, Jagenburg R, Lapidus L, Larsson B, Svärdsudd K, Wittboldt S | title=Gilbert's syndrome—does it exist?

==Genetics==
Gilbert's syndrome is a [[phenotype|phenotypic]] effect, characterized by mild jaundice due to increased unconjugated bilirubin, that arises from several different [[genotype|genotypic]] variants of the gene for the enzyme responsible for changing bilirubin to the conjugated form.

Gilbert's syndrome is characterized by a 70–80% reduction in the [[glucuronidation]] activity of the enzyme, (UGT1A1). The ''UGT1A1'' gene is located on [[Chromosome 2 (human)|human chromosome 2]].&lt;ref name=nlm54658&gt;{{cite web|title=Entrez Gene: UGT1A1 UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=54658|accessdate=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205081110/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=gene|archivedate=2010-12-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 100 variants of the ''UGT1A1'' gene are known, designated as ''UGT1A1*n'' (where n is the general chronological order of discovery), either of the gene itself or of its [[promoter region]].  ''UGT1A1 ''is associated with a [[TATA box]] promoter region; this region most commonly contains the genetic sequence A(TA)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;TAA; this variant accounts for about 50% of [[allele]]s in many populations.  However, several allelic [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic variants]] of this region occur, the most common of which results from adding another [[Tandem repeat|dinucleotide repeat]] TA to the promoter region, resulting in A(TA)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;TAA, which is called ''UGT1A1*28''; this common variant accounts for about 40% of alleles in some populations, but is seen less often, around 3% of alleles, in Southeast and East Asian people and Pacific Islanders.

In most populations, Gilbert's syndrome is most commonly associated with [[homozygous]] A(TA)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;TAA alleles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Raijmakers MT, Jansen PL, Steegers EA, Peters WH |title=Association of human liver bilirubin UDP-glucuronyltransferase activity, most commonly due to a polymorphism in the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene|journal=Journal of Hepatology|year=2000|volume=33|issue=3|pages=348–351|pmid=11019988|doi=10.1016/S0168-8278(00)80268-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bosma UDP-1"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Bosma PJ | title=The genetic basis of the reduced expression of bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1 in Gilbert's syndrome |journal=New England Journal of Medicine| volume=333 | issue=18 | pages=1171–5 | year=1995 | pmid=7565971 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199511023331802| author2= Chowdhury JR | author3= Bakker C | author4= Gantla S | author5= de Boer A | author6= Oostra BA | author7= Lindhout D | author8= Tytgat GN | author9= Jansen PL | author10= Oude Elferink RP  | displayauthors=etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Monaghan G, Ryan M, Seddon R, Hume R, Burchell B | title=Genetic variation in bilirubin UPD-glucuronosyltransferase gene promoter and Gilbert's syndrome | journal=Lancet | volume=347 | issue=9001 | pages=578–81 | year=1996 | pmid=8596320 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(96)91273-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 94% of GS cases, two other glucuronosyltransferase enzymes, [[UGT1A6]] (rendered 50% inactive) and [[UGT1A7]] (rendered 83% ineffective), are also affected.

However, Gilbert's syndrome can arise without TATA box promoter polymorphic mutations;  in some populations, particularly healthy Southeast and East Asians, Gilbert's syndrome is more often a consequence of [[heterozygote]] [[missense mutations]] (such as Gly71Arg also known as ''UGT1A1*6'', Tyr486Asp also known as ''UGT1A1*7'', Pro364Leu also known as ''UGT1A1*73'') in the actual gene coding region,&lt;ref name="Mukherjee"&gt;{{EMedicine|article|176822|Gilbert Syndrome}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may be associated with significantly higher bilirubin levels.&lt;ref name="Mukherjee" /&gt;

Because of its effects on drug and bilirubin breakdown and because of its genetic inheritance, Gilbert's syndrome can be classed as a minor [[inborn error of metabolism]].

==Diagnosis==
People with GS predominantly have elevated [[unconjugated bilirubin]], while [[conjugated bilirubin]] is usually within the normal range and is less than 20% of the total. Levels of bilirubin in GS patients are reported to be from 20 μM to 90 μM (1.2 to 5.3&amp;nbsp;mg/dl)&lt;ref name="Bosma UDP-1" /&gt; compared to the normal amount of &lt; 20 μM. GS patients have a ratio of unconjugated/conjugated (indirect/direct) bilirubin commensurately higher than those without GS.

The level of total bilirubin is often further increased if the blood sample is taken after [[fasting]] for two days,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=J L Gollan |author2=C Bateman |author3=B H Billing |title=Effect of dietary composition on the unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia of Gilbert's syndrome |journal=Gut |issue=  5|pages=335–340 |year=1976 |doi=10.1136/gut.17.5.335 |volume=17 |pmid=1278716 |pmc=1411132}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a fast can, therefore, be useful diagnostically. A further conceptual step that is rarely necessary or appropriate is to give a low dose of [[phenobarbital]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=N Carulli |author2=M Ponz de Leon |author3=E Mauro |author4=F Manenti |author5=A Ferrari |title=Alteration of drug metabolism in Gilbert's syndrome |journal=Gut |issue=  8|pages=581–587 |year=1976 |doi=10.1136/gut.17.8.581 |volume=17 |pmid=976795 |pmc=1411334}}&lt;/ref&gt; the bilirubin will decrease substantially.

Tests can also detect DNA mutations of ''UGT1A1'' by [[polymerase chain reaction]] or DNA fragment sequencing.

===Differential diagnosis===
While Gilbert's syndrome is considered harmless, it is clinically important because it may give rise to a concern about a blood or liver condition, which could be more dangerous.  However, these conditions have additional indicators:

*[[Hemolysis]] can be excluded by a full blood count, haptoglobin, [[lactate dehydrogenase]] levels, and the absence of reticulocytosis (elevated reticulocytes in the blood would usually be observed in haemolytic anaemia).
*[[Viral hepatitis]] can be excluded by negative blood samples for antigens specific to the different hepatitis viruses.
*[[Cholestasis]] can be excluded by  normal levels of bile acids in plasma, the absence of [[lactate dehydrogenase]], low levels of conjugated bilirubin, and [[ultrasound]] scan of the bile ducts. 
*More severe types of glucuronyl transferase disorders such as [[Crigler–Najjar syndrome]] (types I and II) are much more severe, with 0–10% UGT1A1 activity, with sufferers at risk of brain damage in infancy (type I) and teenage years (type II).
*[[Dubin–Johnson syndrome]] and [[Rotor syndrome]] are rarer [[autosomal]] [[recessive]] disorders  characterized by an increase of conjugated bilirubin.
*In GS, unless another disease of the liver is also present, the liver enzymes [[Alanine transaminase|ALT/SGPT]] and [[Aspartate transaminase|AST/SGOT]], as well as [[albumin]], are within normal ranges.

==Treatment==
Typically no treatment is needed.&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt; If jaundice is significant [[phenobarbital]] may be used.&lt;ref name=GARD2016/&gt;

== History ==
Gilbert's syndrome was first described by French gastroenterologist [[Augustin Nicolas Gilbert]] and co-workers in 1901.&lt;ref name=WHO2017/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gilbert A, Lereboullet P |title=La cholemie simple familiale |journal=Sem Med |volume=21 |pages=241–3 |year=1901 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In German literature, it is commonly associated with [[Jens Einar Meulengracht]].&lt;ref&gt;{{WhoNamedIt|doctor|2449|Jens Einar Meulengracht}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative, less common names for this disorder include:
* Familial benign unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia
* Constitutional liver dysfunction
* Familial non-hemolytic non-obstructive jaundice
* Icterus intermittens juvenilis
* Low-grade chronic hyperbilirubinemia
* Unconjugated benign bilirubinemia

'''Guided self-change''' (GSC) treatment has been accepted by [[American Psychological Association]] Division 12, Society of Clinical Psychology, as an empirically supported treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.div12.org/PsychologicalTreatments/treatments/substance_guided.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140927111053/http://www.div12.org/PsychologicalTreatments/treatments/substance_guided.html |archivedate=2014-09-27 |df= }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brief description ==
GSC is a brief, cognitive-behavioral, motivational intervention developed in the early 1980s. It is a form of brief [[cognitive behavioral therapy]]. It was first developed for problem drinkers, but has since then, been researched on several populations (e.g., drug abusers, Spanish-speaking alcohol abuses, adolescents).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005791600000070 | doi=10.1016/S0005-7916(00)00007-0 | volume=31 | title=Does enhanced social support improve outcomes for problem drinkers in guided self-change treatment? | journal=Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry | pages=41–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Linda_Sobell/publication/233485385_Guided_Self-Change_Model_of_Treatment_for_Substance_Use_Disorders/links/0046353c00eaeaae20000000.pdf|format=PDF|title=Guided Self-Change Model of Treatment for Substance Use Disorders|website=Researchgate.net|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1941, HBF was established as the Metropolitan Hospitals Benefit Fund of Western Australia, with the core purpose of providing affordable health services to Western Australians.
HBF’s purpose can be directly traced back to its origins as a key provider of social services prior to the introduction of universal government health cover in [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]]. It was established to provide a pool of funds to ensure the ongoing provision of affordable health services for members. Since its inception, HBF has grown to become the leading provider of health insurance in Western Australia.

In 2009, HBF had 7.7% of the national market share for private health insurance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phio.org.au/downloads/file/PublicationItems/SOHFR2009_v2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 8 May 2017 senior international executive, Mr John Van der Wielen will take up his appointment as Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of HBF Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hbf.com.au/about-hbf/media/media-releases/2017/hbf-appoints-new-managing-director|title=HBF Appoints New Managing Director/CEO|website=HBF Health|language=en|access-date=2017-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
HBF offers health insurance for hospital, ancillary, urgent ambulance and cover for complementary therapies. HBF also offers life, car, home and travel insurance.

'''Kapi{{okina}}olani Medical Center for Women and Children''' is part of [[Hawaii Pacific Health]]'s network of hospitals. It is located in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], within the residential inner city district of [[Makiki]]. Kapi{{okina}}olani Medical Center is Hawaii's only [[children's hospital]] with a  team of physicians and nurses and specialized technology trained specifically to care for children, from infants to young adults. It is the state's only 24-hour pediatric [[emergency department]], pediatric intensive care unit and adolescent unit.

The facility was founded by [[Queen Kapiolani|Queen Kapi{{okina}}olani]] as the Kapi{{okina}}olani Maternity Home in 1890 for which she held bazaars and [[luau]]s to raise $8,000 needed to start the Home. It has since changed its name several times. Kauikeolani Children’s Hospital opened in 1909 named for Emma Kauikeolani Napoleon Mahelona (1862–1931), the wife of [[Albert Spencer Wilcox]] (1844–1919).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Nellist, George F.

==Historical timeline==

===Kapi{{okina}}olani Hospital===
* In 1884, [[Victoria Kinoiki Kekaulike|Princess Kekaulike]] died and willed her home, ''Ululani'', as the site of a proposed [[maternity home]] to help Hawaiian mothers.
* In 1890, after the princess's sister, [[Queen Kapiolani|Queen Kapi{{okina}}olani]], raised $8,000 through bazaars and luaus, she founded the '''Kapi{{okina}}olani Home of the Ho{{okina}}olu and Ho{{okina}}ola Lahui Society''' (society to propagate and perpetuate the race), located at Beretania and Makiki streets, to provide a maternity home for Hawaiian women. The five-bedroom home was opened on June 14, 1890 by [[Kalākaua|King Kalākaua]] and Queen Kapi{{okina}}olani. Only six babies were born at the home the first year, since Native Hawaiian women remained suspicious of doctors and institutions.
* In 1917, the society purchased the adjacent August Dreier property southeast of ''Ululani'' on Beretania Street.
* In 1918, the home moved to a two-story house with 25 beds at 1538 S. Beretania Street, changed its name to the '''Kapi{{okina}}olani Maternity Home''', and opened its doors to women of other than Hawaiian descent.
* In 1927, the trustees purchased the property of Dr. John Whitney on the southeast corner of Punahou and Bingham streets to build a new maternity home.
* In 1928, groundbreaking ceremonies for the new maternity home were held on June 28.
* In 1929, the home moved on March 26 to a new larger building with 50 beds (in twenty-two private rooms, four 2-bedrooms and two wards) located on the southeast corner of Punahou and Bingham streets and expanded its functions to include non-infectious gynecological problems. The original Whitney home was converted to a nurses' home.
* In 1931, its name was changed to the '''Kapi{{okina}}olani Maternity and Gynecological Hospital'''.
* In 1939, after purchasing the adjacent Spalding property south of the hospital on Punahou Street, the Spalding home was converted into a nurses' home named the Kekaulike Nurses' Home.
* In 1945, the hospital, at 1611 Bingham Street, finished construction of the two-story Ewa wing that doubled its capacity to 110 beds.
* In 1957, the hospital completed a new and enlarged nursery.
* In 1961 (August 4), [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] was born in the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Maraniss, David |date=August 24, 2008 |title=Though Obama had to leave to find himself, it is Hawaii that made his rise possible |newspaper=The Washington Post |page=A22 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/23/AR2008082301620.html |accessdate=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Serafin, Peter |date=March 21, 2004 |title=Punahou grad stirs up Illinois politics |newspaper=Honolulu Star-Bulletin |url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2004/03/21/news/story4.html |accessdate=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Hoover, Will |date=November 9, 2008 |title=Obama's Hawaii boyhood homes drawing gawkers |newspaper=The Honolulu Advertiser |page=A1 |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2008/Nov/09/ln/hawaii811090361.html |accessdate=June 28, 2009 |quote=Birthplaces and boyhood homes of U.S. presidents have been duly noted and honored}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |date=January 24, 2009 |title=Kapi' olani Health Foundation, The Centennial Dinner January 24, 2009 |location=Honolulu |publisher=Kapiolani Health Foundation |url=http://www.kapiolanigift.org/the_centennial_dinner.aspx |accessdate=June 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Nakaso, Dan |date=December 22, 2008 | title=Twin sisters, Obama on parallel paths for years |newspaper=The Honolulu Advertiser |page=B1 |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2008/Dec/22/ln/hawaii812220320.html |accessdate=March 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1966, the hospital completed a new four-story Lani Ward Booth wing on Punahou Street, with the top two floors left as shells, capacity remained at 110 beds.
* In 1970, the hospital finished the fourth floor of the Lani Booth wing on Punahou Street, capacity increased to 138 beds.
* In 1971, its name was changed to '''Kapi{{okina}}olani Hospital'''.
* In 1974, the hospital began a major rebuilding project, adding an eleven-story hospital and medical office tower on the southeast corner of Punahou and Bingham Streets, a three-story building, and a parking structure for a combined Kapi{{okina}}olani/Children's Medical Center.
* In 1976, the new tower was dedicated and Kapi{{okina}}olani patients were moved to its second and fourth floors.
* In 1977, a section of the original 1929 building was torn down and tiles from its roof were sold to commemorate the 145,000 babies born under it from 1929 to 1977.

===Kauikeolani Children's Hospital===
[[File:Kapiolani Neonatal ICU.jpg|thumb|The [[Neonatal intensive-care unit|Neonatal Intensive Care Unit]] (NICU) at Kapi{{okina}}olani Medical Center]]
* In 1908, [[Albert Spencer Wilcox]] (1844–1919) gave $55,000 and other private subscribers gave an additional $50,000 to buy several acres of land and erect a two-story comparatively small, homelike children's hospital (with preference given to Hawaiian children) at 226 N. Kuakina Street, named after Wilcox's wife, Emma Kauikeolani Napoliean Mahelona (1862–1931). A maternity service was soon after added to the hospital.
* In 1929, the maternity service at the hospital was discontinued.
* In 1950, a new, modern two-story hospital building with a capacity of 100 beds replaced the original building.
* In 1953, the Rehabilitation Center of Hawaii was established by the Kauikeolani Children's Hospital Foundation.
* In 1969, the rehabilitation center was renamed the Pacific Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine.
* In 1975, the rehabilitation center separated from Kauikeolani Children's Hospital to become the independent Rehabilitation Hospital of the Pacific, which expanded into the 1950 Kauikeolani Children's Hospital building after the latter relocated to Kapi{{okina}}olani/Children's Medical Center on September 15, 1978.

===Kapi{{okina}}olani Medical Center for Women and Children===
* In 1976, Kapi{{okina}}olani Hospital and Kauikenolani Children's Hospital began a protracted, decade-long merger.
* In 1978, Kauikeolani Children's Hospital moved into the new eleven-story (226-bed, 108-bassinet) '''Kapi{{okina}}olani/Children's Medical Center''' tower located at 1319 Punahou Street on the southeast corner of Punahou and Bingham streets—initially with separate entrances for the pediatricians on Bingham Street and the obstetricians on Punahou Street.
* In 1984, the medical staffs and board of directors of the two former hospitals were merged.
* In 1986, the two former hospitals formally completed their merger.
* In 1989, Kapi{{okina}}olani purchased for $76 million the new 116-bed [[Kapiolani Medical Center at Pali Momi|Pali Momi Medical Center]] in [[Aiea, Hawaii|Aiea]], built by Health Care International, six months after it opened.
* In 2001, Kapi{{okina}}olani Medical Center for Women and Children and Kapi{{okina}}olani Medical Center at Pali Momi in Aiea merged with [[Wilcox Health|Wilcox Memorial Hospital]] in [[Lihue, Hawaii|Lihue]] on the Hawaiian island of [[Kauai]] (founded in 1938) and the [[Straub Clinic &amp; Hospital]] (founded in 1921) on King Street, under a new parent company, [[Hawaii Pacific Health]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4232">'''Kent C. Berridge'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-personal.umich.edu/~berridge Berridge's homepage at the University of Michigan], retrieved October 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[professor]] of [[psychology]] ([[biopsychology]]) and [[neuroscience]] at the [[University of Michigan|University of]] [[Michigan]] in the [[United States]].

==Research overview==
Berridge conducts research relating to [[brain]] systems of [[motivation]], affect, reward “liking”, reward “wanting”, [[emotion]], [[fear]], [[pleasure]], [[drug addiction]], [[eating disorders]], and decision utility.  He also studies natural syntactical chains of behavior (e.g. grooming; taste response patterns) in animals with colleague Dr. J. Wayne Aldridge.  With Dr. Piotr Winkielman, he has investigated the issue of unconscious emotion in humans

=="Liking"==
Berridge is known for his work on brain systems for pleasure (“liking”).&lt;ref&gt;Berridge, K.C.  Pleasures of the Brain. Brain Cogn. 2003 Jun;52(1):106-28.&lt;/ref&gt;  Using an assay for “liking” called Taste Reactivity Analysis developed by taste researchers, Berridge measures facial [[palatability]] responses to tastes, which are similar between rodents, primates and humans.&lt;ref name="face"&gt;[http://www.lsa.umich.edu/psych/research&amp;labs/berridge/VideoIndex.htm Videos of Pleasure-elicited Reactions].&lt;/ref&gt;  When something enjoyably sweet is tasted, characteristic licking responses occur.  When something aversively bitter is tasted, gaping and head shaking occur.  Berridge has helped identify "[[hedonic hotspots]]" in the brain, such as the [[nucleus accumbens]] and [[ventral pallidum]], where opioid, endocannabinoid, and GABA neurotransmission coordinate the “liking” of tastes.  Berridge postulates that these hedonic hotspots may be crucial for how the brain produces the hedonic pleasurable feelings common to delicious food, sex, drugs, and other rewards (a role previously thought to be played mostly by brain [[dopamine]] systems).

==Addiction==
Berridge and colleague Dr. Terry Robinson have formulated a contemporary theory of addiction called the Incentive Sensitization Theory of Addiction.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, T.E., Berridge, K.C.    The neural basis of drug craving: an incentive-sensitization theory of addiction.  Brain Res Brain Res Rev. 1993 Sep-Dec;18(3):247-91.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to this theory, drug addiction develops from a sensitization of the mesolimbic [[dopamine]] system.  Dopamine normally functions to attribute [[incentive salience]] to stimuli associated with rewards like food and sex, and triggers reward “wanting”.  Drugs hijack this “wanting” system.  Following repeated use of drugs, the dopamine system becomes hyper-responsive and drug cues become hyper-salient.  This means drug cues are nearly impossible for addicts to ignore, and when they are encountered they can lead to intense cravings and/or relapse.  This sensitized cue-triggered drug 'wanting' can persist for years after an addict quits drugs, and long after drug withdrawal has ceased.  This fact may account for the tendency of former addicts to relapse to drug use after quitting, sometimes even after many years of abstinence.

==Dopamine==
Berridge and Robinson helped redefine the role of mesolimbic dopamine in the brain,&lt;ref&gt;Berridge, K.C., Robinson, T.E.  What is the role of dopamine in reward: hedonic impact, reward learning, or incentive salience?  Brain Res Brain Res Rev. 1998 Dec;28(3):309-69.&lt;/ref&gt; which had previously been viewed as a pleasure neurotransmitter.  Dopamine is no longer widely regarded as a pleasure transmitter.  Instead, dopamine is thought to mediate reward, that is, to attribute incentive salience to reward-associated stimuli.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8442">'''Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes''' ('''LOINC''') is a [[database]] and universal standard for identifying [[medical laboratory]] observations.  First developed in 1994, it was created and is maintained by the [[Regenstrief Institute]], a US nonprofit medical research organization. LOINC was created in response to the demand for an electronic database for clinical care and management and is publicly available at no cost.

It is endorsed by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20051124085226/http://www.clinical-labs.org/ American Clinical Laboratory Association] and the [[College of American Pathologists]]. Since its inception, the database has expanded to include not just medical laboratory code names but also [[nursing diagnosis]], nursing interventions, outcomes classification, and patient care data sets.

==Function==

'''''LOINC''''' applies universal code names and identifiers to [[medical terminology]] related to [[electronic health record]]s. The purpose is to assist in the electronic exchange and gathering of clinical results (such as laboratory tests, clinical observations, outcomes management and research). LOINC has two main parts: laboratory LOINC and clinical LOINC. Clinical LOINC contains a subdomain of Document Ontology which captures types of clinical reports and documents.&lt;ref&gt;

{{cite web |url= https://www.academia.edu/2056669/Suitability_of_LOINC_Document_Ontology_as_a_reference_terminology_for_clinical_document_types_A_case_report_of_a_research-oriented_EHR |title=Suitability of LOINC Document Ontology as a reference terminology for clinical document types: A case report of a research-oriented EHR |accessdate=2 Oct 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several standards, such as '''[[Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise|IHE]]''' or '''[[HL7]]''', use LOINC to electronically transfer results from different reporting systems to the appropriate healthcare networks{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}. However, the health information enclosed is identified by a multiplicity of code values that may vary according to the entity producing those results. This has obvious disadvantages to the healthcare network that may need to adopt different codes to access and manage information coming from multiple sources.  Managed care providers, for example, often have negotiated contracts that reimburse episodes of care and unique coding to trigger automated claim payment.  Mapping each entity-specific code to its corresponding universal code can represent a significant investment of both human and financial capital.

A universal code system will enable facilities and departments across the world to receive and send results from their areas for comparison and consultation and may contribute toward a larger public health initiative of improving clinical outcomes and [http://www.iom.edu/topic.asid=3718 quality of care].

LOINC is one of the standards for use in U.S. Federal Government systems for the electronic exchange of clinical health information. In 1999, it was identified by the HL7 Standards Development Organization as a preferred code set for laboratory test names in transactions between health care facilities, laboratories, laboratory testing devices, and public health authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=LOINC and other standards|url=http://loinc.org/faq/getting-started/loinc-and-other-standards|accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
A formal, distinct, and unique 6-part name is given to each term for test or observation identity.&lt;ref name="BuiTaira2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alex A. T. Bui|author2=Ricky K. Taira|title=Medical Imaging Informatics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3JClHj3SXjwC&amp;pg=PA107|accessdate=31 May 2011|date=August 2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4419-0384-6|pages=107–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The database currently has over 71,000 observation terms that can be accessed and understood universally.    
Each database record includes six fields for the unique specification of each identified single test, observation, or measurement:

# Component- what is measured, evaluated, or observed (example: urea,...)
# Kind of property- characteristics of what is measured, such as length, mass, volume, time stamp and so on
# Time aspect- interval of time over which the observation or measurement was made
# System- context or specimen type within which the observation was made (example: blood, urine,...)
# Type of scale- the scale of measure.  The scale may be quantitative, ordinal, nominal or narrative
# Type of method- procedure used to make the measurement or observation

A unique code (format: nnnnn-n) is assigned to each entry upon registration. Other database fields include status and mapping information for database change management, synonyms, related terms, substance information (e.g. [[molar mass]], [[CAS registry number]]), choices of answers for nominal scales, translations.

==Uses==
Some of the advantages resulting from adopting LOINC may include improved communication in integrated healthcare delivery networks, improved community wide electronic health records, the automatic transfer to public health authorities of case reports for reportable diseases (e.g. for disease control or detection of epidemics), improved transfer of payment information for services rendered and a significant improvement in the overall quality of health care by reducing errors in the system.

The fact that universal standards are being promoted (if not adopted by national organizations and agencies) is an indication that the dialogue will continue regarding the development, structure, financing, monitoring, enforcement, and  integration of standards within the broader health care system.

International interest in LOINC continues to grow. A number of efforts have been undertaken to translate the LOINC documents and terms into various languages, such as [[Simplified Chinese]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]].  For more information on LOINC International, see [https://web.archive.org/web/20070622062625/http://www.regenstrief.org/medinformatics/loinc/international LOINC International]. As of January, 2009, the software RELMA ('''Re'''genstrief '''L'''OINC '''M'''apping '''A'''ssistant) is available in separate downloads that contain an additional word index in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Simplified Chinese]], or [[Korean language|Korean]], which allows searching in these languages in addition to [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RELMA Version 4.00 Available|url=http://loinc.org/news/relma-version-4-00-available.html/view|accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harmonization efforts between LOINC and [[SNOMED CT]] were initiated in 2012.

[[Malay titles|Tan Sri]] [[Physician|Dr.]] '''Lim Swee Aun''' ({{zh|t=|s=林瑞安|p=Lín Ruì Ān}}; 1 September 1915 – 13 August 1977)  was a [[Malaysian Chinese]] politician from the [[Malaysian Chinese Association]], and a [[Cabinet of Malaysia|Cabinet]] member.

== Early life ==
The eldest son of Lim Tee Hooi and Foong Cheong Ngan, Swee Aun was born on 1 September 1915 in [[Taiping, Perak]] and educated at the King Edward VII School (Taiping.

He was a keen [[Rugby football|Rugby]] player and played for the school in the 1930s.
&lt;ref&gt;C. K. Loh (2006)'' "The History of Rugby in King Edward VII School, Taiping".'' The Taiping Edwardians. 12 October 2006.&lt;br /&gt;
 http://www.edwardians.com.my/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=21&amp;Itemid=20. Retrieved 2010-10-04.&lt;/ref&gt; Swee Aun with Yahayaudin, Sulaiman and Harun were the first to be awarded colours.

===College years===
In June 1932, Swee Aun joined the King Edward VII College of Medicine, in [[Singapore]] (subsequently merged with [[Raffles College]] to form the [[University of Malaya]]) at the age of 16 years. He was a brilliant scholar and gained Distinction in [[Anatomy]] in the 2nd Professional Examination, an honour he shared with his classmate Quek Eng Lan (whom he subsequently married on 22 August 1938). He was awarded a [[scholarship]] for this achievement. In the Final examination in 1938, Swee Aun obtained Distinction in Medicine and Materia Medica and was awarded the much coveted Lim Boon Keng Medal.

While in College, he was also a great sportsman. He was Captain of the Singapore All Blues Rugby Team in 1935 which won the Trophy for Pan-Malayan Interstate Rugby Matches.

==Early working days==
Lim Swee Aun completed his [[Doctor of medicine|housemanship]] in [[Singapore General Hospital]]. In 1939 he was posted to the [[Sungai Buloh]] [[Leprosarium]] before moving to [[Ipoh]] General Hospital and to [[Taiping, Perak]], his hometown in 1940.

==The War Years==
In December 1941, war came and Taiping experienced the 1st bomb on 8 December. The main attack from the [[Japan]]ese Army came from the north. So Lim Swee Aun decided to evacuate his whole family to Rev. Quek Kheng Hoon's (his [[father-in-law]]) [[rambutan]] estate in [[Bukit Timah]], [[Singapore]].

Lim Swee Aun stayed on in Taiping [[Hospital]] and evacuated with the [[Medical]] [[Convoy]] by stages going southwards as the [[enemy]] came closer from the north. He finally arrived in Singapore and joined the Medical Team there. But soon the whole family had to abandon the Bukit Timah rambutan estate as the enemy approached. They moved to the [[Prinsep Street Presbyterian Church]] where they took refuge under the church [[pews]], together with many others. Bombing and cannon fire continued all day and night from across the causeway. Singapore surrendered and the Japanese [[soldiers]] were everywhere. All non-[[Singaporean]]s were returned to Malaya. Lim Swee Aun and his family travelled in a [[cattle truck]], taking 4 days and 3 nights to reach Taiping.

===Japanese Occupation 1942-1945===
Dr. Lim Swee Aun worked for Dr. Tan Chen Leng in Taiping. During the occupation period, Lim Swee Aun secretly supplied medicine to the [[Prisoners of War]]. Dr. Lim Swee Aun, Dr. Tan Cheng Leng and the [[Parsi]] Jal Manecksha also secretly helped the Indian Prisoners of War of the Motor Transport Unit No. 1 under the Command of [[Subedar]] Nurud Din. They contributed a sum of $15,000/- to Dr. Tarlok Singh to help them buy medicines and food for the sick Indian [[P.O.W.]]s. They had also been using a radio to listen to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] news, dismantling the radio and hiding it away after listening each time. They were part of the "inner circle of war news." He kept this secret, even from his wife. After the war, Lim Swee Aun was awarded a commendation Certificate for his deeds by the [[British Government]] through Malcolm McDonald.

===British Military Administration (BMA)===
After the [[Japanese surrender]] on 2 September 1945, Lim Swee Aun resigned from Dr. Tan Chen Leng's employment and started his own practice at 75 Kota Road, [[Taiping, Perak]]. He had to raise money to buy the premises by [[Pawnshop|pawning]] whatever jewellery he could from his mother and wife. He worked hard, day and night attending to his sick [[patients]] and doing house calls even though the country was in a state of [[Malayan Emergency]] from the [[communist]] activities. He often treated his patients for free when they could not afford it.

==Political career==
He was a founder and Life member of the Malaysian Chinese Association in Taiping. In 1959 Lim Swee Aun became a member of Parliament when he won the seat of Larut Selatan. He was appointed Minister of Health in 1962 and later in the year he became Minister of Commerce and Industry.

=== Industrialisation ===
Lim Swee Aun's responsibility as minister was to industralise the country. He encouraged [[Foreign direct investment|Foreign investments]] in [[Joint Venture]]s but stood firm on the 51% Malaysian participation. Industrial estates were established throughout the country from Perlis in the north to Johore in the south.

The seeds of what was to become a major industry in Malaysia were sown by the then Malaysian Minister of Commerce and Industry, Dr. Lim Swee Aun, in 1963. On his way to the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] Conference (GATT) Geneva that year, Dr. Lim confirmed that his ministry had received many inquiries from foreign and local firms regarding the possibility of setting up vehicle manufacturing factories in the Federation. The bigger plan, he subsequently announced, was to establish a motor vehicle industry in Malaysia by stages - from basic assembly with local content, to chassis build and finally to a fully locally made car. It would be exactly 20 years later that Perusahaan Otomobile Nasional Berhad ([[Proton (carmaker)]]) was incorporated (7 May 1983), and Malaysia's first locally built car, the [[Proton Saga]], was launched on 9 July 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Solomon (2005) ''"Six years to assembling cars in Peninsular 1963-1968".''

=== Formation of Malaysia Agreement 1963 ===
Lim Swee Aun was involved in the final rounds of negotiations on the [[Malaysia Agreement|Malaysia talks]]. A Malayan delegation departed for London on 25 June 1963 and was led by [[Tun Abdul Razak]], [[Tan Siew Sin]] and Dr Lim Swee Aun (Minister for Commerce).&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Stockwell (2004) ''Malaysia'', p. 510. The Stationery office. {{ISBN|0-11-290581-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The function of Mr. Tan and Dr. Lim was in [[Geofroy Tory|Sir Geofroy Tory]]'s view, to restrain Tun Razak from making undue concessions. Agreement was reached on the main points of issue on 5 July and only then did Tunku himself leave for London.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Stockwell (2004) ''Malaysia'', p. 632. The Stationery office. {{ISBN|0-11-290581-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Lim was one of the signatories of the Agreement Relating to Malaysia (1963).

===The Debate on Malaysian Solidarity 1965===
[[Syed Jaafar Albar]] participated in verbal duels with the Singaporean Prime Minister, [[Lee Kuan Yew]], over the issue of [[ketuanan Melayu]] (Malay sovereignty over Malaysia), accusing Lee and some other [[Chinese Malaysian]]s — referring to them as ''kaum pendatang'' or ''immigrants'' — of being lodgers (''orang tumpangan''), abusing the hospitality of the Malays who were the "masters of the house". &lt;br /&gt;
This provoked a response from Cabinet member Swee Aun, who insisted "we are co-owners, not lodgers, not guests."&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Kuan Yew (1998). ''The Singapore Story'', p. 620.

Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] in his speech at the Malaysia Solidarity Convention on 6 June 1965 congratulated Lim Swee Aun for
his courage in saying it.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Kuan Yew (1965).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13495">'''Lynne McTaggart''' (born 23 January 1951, in New York City) is an American lecturer, journalist, author, and publisher. She is the author of six books, including ''The Intention Experiment'' and ''The Field''. According to her author profile, she is a spokesperson "on consciousness, the new physics, and the practices of conventional and alternative medicine."&lt;ref name=hcpromo&gt;[http://www.harpercollins.com/authors/13886/Lynne_McTaggart/index.aspx Author biography at Harper Collins]&lt;/ref&gt;

McTaggart is an [[Vaccine controversies|anti-vaccinationist]].&lt;ref name="Goldacre-Vicious" /&gt; She promotes this belief in her book ''What Doctors Don't Tell You'' and in other publications.&lt;ref name="Bedford"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Concerns about immunisation |author1=Bedford, Helen |author2=Elliman, David | journal=BMJ |date=Jan 2000  | volume=320 | issue=7229 | pages=240–243 | pmc=1117437 | doi=10.1136/bmj.320.7229.240 | pmid=10642238}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has drawn significant criticism of her work and has created controversy.&lt;ref name="InsideHealth"&gt;{{cite AV media | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01n11xb | title=Inside Health | publisher=BBC Radio 4 | date=3 Oct 2012 | people=Dr. Mark Porter, Dr. Margaret McCartney, Lynne McTaggart | medium=Radio | location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In her autobiography McTaggart reports that after recovering from an illness using [[alternative medicine|alternative medical approaches]] her husband suggested she start a newsletter on the risks of some medical practices and devised the title: "What Doctors Don't Tell You".  In 1996 McTaggart published the book with the same name.

She and her husband set up a public company in 2001, ''What Doctors Don't Tell You plc'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.growthcompany.co.uk/news/2524/whistleblower-sees-fast-turnaround.thtml |title= Whistleblower sees fast turnaround |publisher=Growth Company Investor |date=14 March 2001 |accessdate= 17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; later ''Conatus plc'', which published newsletters, magazines and audio-tapes based on conferences and seminars including, ''What Doctors Don't Tell You'', ''PROOF!'',  and ''Living the Field''.&lt;ref name=simonpromo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://authors.simonandschuster.com/Lynne-McTaggart/31595088/biography |title=Lynne McTaggart - Biography |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909142234/http://authors.simonandschuster.com/Lynne-McTaggart/31595088/biography |archivedate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This company was [[Winding up|wound up]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/58983/notices/740659 |title=Petitions to Wind Up - CONATUS LIMITED |id= Issue Number: 58983 Page: 2909 |publisher=The London Gazette |date=18 February 2009 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new company, ''Wddty Publishing Ltd'', run by McTaggart and her husband, took over the ''What Doctors Don't Tell You'' website, and ''New Age Publishing Ltd'' for McTaggart's other publishing and public-speaking activities. Publication of their monthly magazine ''What Doctors Don't Tell You'' restarted in August 2012, in a glossy format aimed at newsagent and high-street distribution, instead of using the previous subscription model, and carrying paid advertising, something McTaggart had originally said WDDTY would not do.&lt;ref name="TimesJunk" /&gt;

In her book ''The Field'', McTaggart asserts that the universe is unified by an interactive field. The book has been translated into fourteen languages.&lt;ref name=simonpromo /&gt; In a later book, ''The Intention Experiment'', she discusses research in the field of human [[consciousness]] which she says supports the theory that "the universe is connected by a vast quantum [[Energy (esotericism)|energy field]]" and can be influenced by thought. [[Michael Shermer]] states that this belief is contradicted by conflicting evidence (e.g. [[studies on intercessory prayer]]).&lt;ref name="Shermer"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael |last=Shermer |date=April 5, 2006 |title=Prayer &amp; Healing: The Verdict is in and the Results are Null |journal=ESkeptic |issn=1556-5696 |url=http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/06-04-05/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McTaggart has a [[personal development|personal-development]] program called "Living The Field" which is based on an idiosyncratic interpretation of the [[zero point field]] as applied to [[quantum mechanics]]. She appears in the extended version of the movie ''[[What the Bleep Do We Know!?]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/341456/What-the-Bleep-Down-the-Rabbit-Hole/overview |title= Down the Rabbit Hole (2006) |newspaper=New York Times |accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2004).

From 1996 until 2002 McTaggart and her husband Bryan Hubbard published the monthly newsletter ''Mother Knows Best'', later renamed ''Natural Parent magazine'', focusing on [[home schooling]], environmental and health concerns, including nutrition and [[homeopathy]]. They also published related books: ''My Learning Child'', ''My Spiritual Child'' and ''My Healthy Child''.

Significant portions of her book about [[Kathleen Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington]] appeared without attribution&lt;ref&gt;Compare:

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
''What Doctors Don't Tell You'' has been cited for factual errors in its attacks on medicine, such as confusing the antiviral drug [[Tamiflu]] for a vaccine and attributing deaths to a nonexistent [[avian influenza]] vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = How to be beautifully, blissfully wrong about Tamiflu: just call it a bird flu vaccine | author = [[Ben Goldacre]] | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/feb/18/infectiousdiseases.birdflu | newspaper = The Guardian | location = London | date = February 18, 2006 |page = 7 | accessdate = December 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ben Goldacre]] has described McTaggart as "viciously, viciously anti-vaccine"&lt;ref name="Goldacre-Vicious"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.badscience.net/2006/02/the-great-tamiflu-vaccine-scare/ | title=The Great Tamiflu Vaccine Scare | date=Feb 18, 2006 | accessdate=2013-05-18 | author=Goldacre, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt; and notes that "In a radical move, even for the vaccine fear-mongering community, this time she has people dying from a vaccine that ''doesn’t actually exist''".

''The Field'' has been characterized by Mark Henderson of ''[[The Times]]'' as [[pseudoscience]], focusing on her personal understanding of quantum physics as a misconception.&lt;ref name="TimesJunk"&gt;{{cite news | title = Junk medicine: Anti-vaccine activists | author = Mark Henderson | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/article500204.ece | newspaper = The Times | location = London | date = October 30, 2004 | accessdate = December 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McTaggart was reported to have threatened to sue [[Simon Singh]] after he contacted Comag, the distributors of WDDTY, complaining that the magazine was "largely unscientific" and "promoting advice that could potentially harm readers." "Also, many of the adverts appear to make pseudoscientific and unsubstantiated claims," he said. "I even offered to meet with Comag and introduce them to medical experts, but they have not accepted this invitation. When I suggested that I would blog about our email exchange, their reaction was to tell me in no uncertain terms: 'I should inform you that we have sought legal advice in respect of this matter. We would take any attempts to damage our reputation on social media or elsewhere very seriously.'"&lt;ref name="Singh-Twitter"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/oct/03/health-magazine-sue-simon-singh-twitter | title=Simon Singh threatened with legal action for criticising health magazine | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=2012-10-03 | accessdate=2013-05-18 | author=Jha, Alok}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the months between first publication of ''What Doctors Don't Tell You'' in magazine form, and February 2013, 54 breaches of the Code of Advertising Practice in 11 adverts were adjudicated and upheld by the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] along with a further 11 informally resolved cases, concerning adverts in the first two issues,&lt;ref name=Nightingale&gt;[http://www.nightingale-collaboration.org/news/143-wddty-9-taking-stock.html WDDTY #9 - Taking Stock], ''Nightingale Collaboration'', 27 Feb 2013&lt;/ref&gt; with more breaches in subsequent issues too.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nightingale-collaboration.org/news/174-stemming-the-tide.html Stemming the tide: 'The list of misleading adverts in the magazine What Doctors Don't Tell You sometimes seems endless...'] ''nightingale-collaboration.org'', accessed 2 Jully 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview on [[BBC Radio 4]], GP and author Dr. [[Margaret McCartney]] stated: "I'm astounded that Lynne thinks this is an evidence-based publication. It's anything but," she said. "The problem with evidence is that it can tell you things that you'd rather not know. A lot of the time medicine does do harm but that's why doctors and scientists are duty-bound to put their research findings out there and to stop doing things that cause harm. What we shouldn't do is abandon medicine and the scientific method and go straight for alternative medicine with no good evidence that that works either."&lt;ref name="Singh-Twitter" /&gt; She criticised stories in the magazine as "absolute rubbish" and "ridiculously alarmist".

In an article in The Times in October 2013 Tom Whipple, science correspondent, said that "Experts are calling on high street shops to stop selling a magazine that claims that [[vitamin C]] cures [[HIV]], suggests homeopathy could treat cancer and implies that the [[cervical cancer]] [[HPV vaccine|vaccine]] has killed hundreds of girls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Call to ban magazine for scaremongering | author = Tom Whipple | url = http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/medianews/article3883331.ece | newspaper = The Times | location = London | date = October 1, 2013 | accessdate = October 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
McTaggart is married to publisher Bryan Hubbard and lives in London with her two daughters.&lt;ref name=hcpromo /&gt;&lt;ref name=intent-bio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.intent.com/lynnemctaggart/profile |title=Biography: Lynne McTaggart |publisher=Intent Inc |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927104233/http://www.intent.com/lynnemctaggart/profile |archivedate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1412">A '''medical logic module''' ('''MLM''') is an independent unit in a [[healthcare]] [[knowledge base]] that represents the knowledge published on a requirement for treating a [[patient]] according to a single [[medicine|medical]] [[Decision making|decision]].

Possible usage is with an event [[Medical monitor|monitor]] program in an [[intensive care]] ward or with [[hospital information system]] on occurrence of defined conditions. See [[Arden syntax]] reference for examples. Early introduction is given with monographs.&lt;ref&gt;Hripcsak G., Writing Arden Syntax Medical Logic Modules, Comput Biol Med. 1994 Sep;24(5):331-63&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation ==

The [[Arden syntax]] has been defined as a grammar which could make MLMs swappable between various platforms. XML representation of Arden (ArdenML) can be transformed by Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLTs) to other forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jung|first=C|author2=Sward, K. |author3=Haug, P |title=Executing medical logic modules expressed in ArdenML using Drools|journal=J Am Med Inform Assoc|date=2012|volume=19|pages=533–536|doi=10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000512|pmc=3384109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no reference stated for general implementation as a transfer method between different information systems.

The U.S. '''National Commission on AIDS''' was established by a [[AIDS amendments of 1988|statute]] enacted November 4, 1988, with the aim of "promoting the development of a national consensus on policy concerning acquired immune deficiency syndrome [AIDS]".&lt;ref&gt;''AIDS: An Expanding Tragedy'', Appendix F&lt;/ref&gt; It produced several reports over the next 4 years.

==Creation==
In response to the Reagan administration's failure to respond to the recommendations of the [[President's Commission on the HIV Epidemic]] (1987–88), Congress passed legislation sponsored by Representative [[J. Roy Rowland|Roy Rowland]], a Georgia Democrat and the only physician in Congress, that created the National Commission on AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harden|first=Victoria A.|title=AIDS at 30: A History|year=2012|publisher=Potomac Books|location=Washington, D.C. |pages=111 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QosAu8D4ELEC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation specified that its members be people "especially qualified ... by reason of their education, training, or experience" and the commission's membership balanced to cover "the fields of medicine, science, law, ethics, health-care economics, and health-care and social services". Five members were appointed by the majority and minority leaders of the House, 5 by the majority and minority leaders of the Senate, and 2 by the President. The Secretaries of Defense, Health and Human Services, and Veterans Affairs served as non-voting members ex officio. The members were given authority to elect their own chairperson. The commission was charged with producing a report after two years and the President was authorized to extend the commission's life for an additional two years.

The commission began work in August 1989 after several months of delay while members were appointed.&lt;ref name=delay&gt;{{cite news|last=Lambert|first=Bruce|title=AIDS Panel to Organize After Delay of 7 Months|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/31/us/aids-panel-to-organize-after-delay-of-7-months.html|accessdate=February 14, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 31, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|As I think you know, along with my fellow commission members I have been increasingly frustrated by the lack of support, and even opposition, of your Administration to our recommendations—recommendations which have an urgent priority and for which there is a broad consensus in the medical and AIDS communities. I cannot in good conscience continue to serve on a commission whose important work is so utterly ignored by your Administration....}}
Johnson recalled speaking with the president in January:
{{quote|No matter how good the team may be, I said it won't win the championship without the owner fully in the game. I am disappointed that you dropped the ball, and your Administration is not doing everything that it must to fight this disease.}}

We've got a good AIDS Commission, good AIDS reports, and no action."&lt;ref name=quits/&gt;

In February 1993, Johnson indicated a willingness to rejoin the commission after President [[Bill Clinton]] took office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Magic Johnson wants to rejoin AIDS commission|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-02-18/news/1993049239_1_magic-johnson-commission-on-aids-clinton-administration|accessdate=February 13, 2013|newspaper=Baltimore Sun|date=February 18, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reports==
The commission published more than a dozen reports with detailed recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;''AIDS: An Expanding Tragedy'', 3, Appendix B lists the reports&lt;/ref&gt;

As required by statute, the commission its first major report called ''America Living with AIDS'' on September 26, 1991. Its overall assessment said:&lt;ref name=faults&gt;{{cite news|last=Hilts|first=Philip J.|title=Panel Faults Leaders on AIDS Epidemic |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/26/us/panel-faults-leaders-on-aids-epidemic.html|accessdate=February 14, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=September 26, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote|Our nation's leaders have not done well. In the past decade, the White House has rarely broken its silence on the topic of AIDS. Congress has shown leadership in developing critical legislation, but has often failed to provide adequate funding for AIDS programs. Articulate leadership guiding Americans toward a proper response to AIDS has been notably absent.}}
Its principal recommendations included:
*A unified national plan for combating AIDS.
*Universally available treatment for drug abuse and addiction
*Eliminating laws and regulations that prevent drug users from acquiring clean needles
*Medical coverage that includes the cost of prescription drugs for all citizens

Dr. [[James O. Mason]], [[Assistant Secretary for Health]] of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]], cited annual budget increases and said in reply:&lt;ref name=faults /&gt;
{{quote|Lack of leadership? Compared to what? There has been a great deal of leadership and a growing budget. There has been more leadership on this issue than just about any other, such as cancer or heart disease. The amount of time the Secretary and I put in on this issue is inordinate compared to other very serious problems.}}

The commission's final report, ''AIDS: An Expanding Tragedy'', appeared in June 1993 and consisted of just 15 pages plus appendices. Its preface said composing a final report was like "trying to take a snapshot of a tidal way" and continued:&lt;ref name=final&gt;{{cite book|title=AIDS: An Expanding Tragedy|year=1993|publisher=National Commission on AIDS|location=Washington, D.C.|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951d01944873p;seq=7;view=1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote|This is a short, sometimes angry report tinged with sadness and foreboding. It is short, because all of what we say here has been said many times before. It is sometimes angry because the carefully considered, widely heralded recommendations  contained in our previous reports have been so consistently underfunded or ignored. It is sad because a potentially preventable disease continues to expand relentlessly and cause loss of life in young Americans on an unprecedented and unacceptable scale.}}

The report saw some signs for hope in the Clinton administration's funding requests, but feared that "the response to the epidemic is again tangled in politics".&lt;ref&gt;''AIDS: An Expanding Tragedy'', 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The commission ceased operations by law on September 3, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=AIDS: An Expanding Tragedy|year=1993|publisher=National Commission on AIDS|location=Washington, D.C.|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951d01944873p;seq=7;view=1up;num=v|page=ii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 2012 memoir, Mary Fisher assessed her experience:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fisher|first=Mary|title=Messenger: A Self Portrait|year=2012|publisher=Greenleaf Book Group|location=Austin, Texas|pages=123|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nvlJKsb1r5MC&amp;pg=PT131&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|[N]othing was ever given the power or drama of that first commission, in part because it was the first and in part because of the political tensions and rage surrounding AIDS during those times.&lt;br&gt;
The original National Commission on AIDS might have succeeded in raising some national consciousness and, among those with AIDS,a bit of hope. But it never became a dynamic force for change. It gave the media an institution to monitor, and it provided a buffer of sorts between those with power and those with AIDS. Its members were well-intended, and its organizers were earnest. But our achievements were, in a word, lame. The commission was not a collective leader, and no one member's voice gained staying power.}}

The commission was succeeded by the [[Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS]] in 1995.

The '''National Kidney Foundation Singapore''' ('''NKF''') is a non-profit health organisation in [[Singapore]]. Its mission is to render services to kidney patients, encourage and promote renal research, as well as to carry out public education programs on kidney diseases. As of February 2016, NKF has 29 [[dialysis]] centres in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nkfs.org/treatment/haemodialysis/dialysis-centre-locations/ |title=Dialysis Centre Locations - The National Kidney Foundation Singapore&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=10 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310145305/http://www.nkfs.org/treatment/haemodialysis/dialysis-centre-locations/ |archive-date=10 March 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===Early years===
NKF was founded in the early 1960s, after [[nephrologist]] Prof. Khoo Oon Teik witnessed many people suffering from [[kidney failure]], including his own brother, Reverend Khoo Oon Eng. During that time, about 200 Singaporeans were dying each year from kidney failure. As a result, Prof. Khoo was determined to set up a National Kidney Foundation to help needy kidney patients. NKF was inaugurated on 7 April 1969, on [[World Health Day]], by [[President of Singapore|President]] [[Yusof Ishak]].

===Opening of satellite dialysis centres===
In September 1982, NKF officially opened its first dialysis centre at the [[Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital]]. However, due to insufficient resources, it could only admit few patients. NKF started building dialysis centres in the vacant flats of [[Housing Development Board|HDB]] estates to lower costs and increase accessibility to dialysis for kidney patients. In 1987, the NKF’s first satellite dialysis centre was established in [[Toa Payoh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_475_2005-01-07.html?s=dialysis+centre|title=First satellite self-dialysis centre - Infopedia|first=National Library Board,|last=Singapore|website=eresources.nlb.gov.sg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New headquarters===
In 2001, a new building for NKF’s headquarters was commissioned on Kim Keat Road. Singapore Buddhist Welfare Services, the late Tay Choon Hye, the [[Shaw Foundation]], [[Singapore Pools]] and the [[Lee Foundation]] contributed a total of $21 million to the cost of building the NKF Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | access-date=15 June 2015 | archive-date=8 July 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180708191745/https://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/home/pressRoom/speeches_d/2001/NKF_centre_opening_and_donor_appreciation_ceremony.html | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all | url=https://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/home/pressRoom/speeches_d/2001/NKF_centre_opening_and_donor_appreciation_ceremony.html | title=NKF Centre Opening And Donor Appreciation Ceremony}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Children’s Kidney Centre===
In 2002, the Shaw Foundation donated $4 million to open a Children’s Kidney Centre at the National University Hospital to support children with kidney diseases.

===Scandal and aftermath===
{{main|National Kidney Foundation Singapore scandal}}

In July 2005, a new board and management team was formed for a leaner, cost-effective NKF, after former CEO, [[T.T Durai]], and directors stepped down due to breach of fiduciary duties, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2013-07-01_120748.html|title=National Kidney Foundation financial scandal (2005) - Infopedia|first=National Library Board,|last=Singapore|website=eresources.nlb.gov.sg|access-date=23 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120154539/http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2013-07-01_120748.html|archive-date=20 January 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a recovery from the scandal, Chairman Gerard Ee, handed over the reins in 2012 to Koh Poh Tiong. In 2013, CEO Eunice Tay retired, and Edmund Kwok took over.

On 16 November 2016, the NKF board held a press conference announcing that Edmund Kwok was removed from his position as CEO, due to a police case involving Kwok and a NKF male employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/nkf-ceo-edmund-kwok-sacked-over-personal-indiscretion-involving-male-staff-police-report|title=NKF CEO Edmund Kwok sacked over personal indiscretion involving male employee, police report filed: NKF|first=|last=hermesauto|date=16 November 2016|publisher=|access-date=16 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116230028/http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/nkf-ceo-edmund-kwok-sacked-over-personal-indiscretion-involving-male-staff-police-report|archive-date=16 November 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and prevention==

Aside from providing dialysis treatment, NKF also focuses on kidney disease education and prevention, against as [[diabetes]] and [[hypertension]], which are leading causes of kidney failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nkfs.org/kidney-disease/leading-causes-of-kidney-failure/causes-symptoms-and-treatment/|title=Kidney Failure (Renal Failure) - Symptoms and Treatment|publisher=|access-date=1 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423015501/http://www.nkfs.org/kidney-disease/leading-causes-of-kidney-failure/causes-symptoms-and-treatment/|archive-date=23 April 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Schools Outreach Programme teaches children about kidney functions, kidney failure, and how kidney patients cope with this chronic condition. The program includes visits to the Kidney Discovery Centre at NKF’s headquarters; school assembly talks, and health booths at schools; and the Kidney Health Education Bus, which has health screening stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nkfs.org/prevention/school-outreach/|title=School Outreach - The National Kidney Foundation Singapore|publisher=|access-date=1 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503071541/http://www.nkfs.org/prevention/school-outreach/|archive-date=3 May 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Little Champs and Young Champs Programmes aim to strengthen students’ leadership abilities and inspire them to make a difference to the community and in the lives of kidney patients.

‘Healthy Mondays’ is a programme for adults. Introduced to organisations and corporations, it consists of health talks, health screenings and exercises to nurture healthy lifestyles for employees.

NKF also works with local media, healthcare and social agencies, grass-roots organisations, and institutions to disseminate health messages.

==Providing peritoneal dialysis==
NKF also promotes Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) allowing kidney patients to have more flexibility and control of their lifestyle, by undergoing treatment at home. To encourage PD and build the confidence of patients undergoing this treatment, the NKF has a Comprehensive PD Community Support Programme where trained and experienced PD nurses work closely with the hospitals to support PD patients at home to help them start and stay well on PD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nkfs.org/treatment/peritoneal-dialysis/peritoneal-dialysis-community-support-programme/|title=Peritoneal Dialysis Community Support Programme - NKF Singapore|publisher=|access-date=1 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505223537/http://www.nkfs.org/treatment/peritoneal-dialysis/peritoneal-dialysis-community-support-programme/|archive-date=5 May 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable programmes==

Besides providing dialysis, NKF has instituted patient welfare programs, helping patients cope with illness, aiding them with re-integrating into society, as well as supporting their families.

===Patient Employment Rehabilitation Programme===
In November 2015, NKF launched the Patient Employment Rehabilitation Programme, to match jobless patients with suitable jobs, and hire some patients as staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/nkf-scheme-matches-patients-with-jobs|title=NKF scheme matches patients with jobs|first=|last=hermes|date=25 November 2015|publisher=|access-date=23 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802020043/http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/nkf-scheme-matches-patients-with-jobs|archive-date=2 August 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kidney Live Donor Support Programme===
In 2009, the Kidney Live Donor Support Programme was launched to provide financial assistance for needy live donors to ensure that costs is not an obstacle for the donor’s long-term medical follow-up.&lt;ref&gt;http://yourhealth.asiaone.com/content/come-forward-and-be-kidney-donor&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partnerships ==

NKF partners with the [[Ministry of Health (Singapore)|Ministry of Health]], other healthcare providers and the community, to increase awareness of kidney disease and prevention, promote kidney transplantation, and encourage home dialysis and to improve dialysis care.

[[Image:StephenProfile2011.jpg|thumb|right|Stephen Heywood's profile on PatientsLikeMe]]
'''PatientsLikeMe''' is a for profit patient network and real-time research platform. Through the network, patients connect with others who have the same disease or condition and track and share their own experiences with the goal to improve outcomes. In the process, they generate data about the real-world nature of disease. With over 600,000 members, PatientsLikeMe is a source for real-world disease information and its patient-generated data form the basis of more than 100 peer-reviewed scientific studies. PatientsLikeMe was inspired by the life experiences of [[Stephen Heywood]], diagnosed in 1998 at the age of 29 with [[ALS|amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)]], or Lou Gehrig’s disease. The company was founded in 2004 by his brothers [[James Heywood (chief executive)|Jamie]] and Ben Heywood and long-time family friend Jeff Cole.

==History==

After being diagnosed with ALS, Stephen's family founded a non-profit, [[ALS Therapy Development Institute]], in an attempt to slow his disease and treat his symptoms. However, the slow pace of research and the trial-and-error approach was time-consuming and repetitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/somuchsofast/heywoods/wendy.html|title=Caring For Stephen - An Interview With Wendy Stacy - So Much So Fast | work = FRONTLINE - PBS | date =  3 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They realized that Stephen’s experience was like that of other patients around the world who often have specific questions about their treatment options, and about what to expect. PatientsLikeMe helps patients connect with others who know firsthand what they are going through to share advice and resources. Through a health profile made up of structured and quantitative clinical reporting tools, members are able to monitor their health between doctor or hospital visits, document the severity of their symptoms, identify triggers, note how they are responding to new treatments, and track side effects. They have the opportunity to learn from the aggregated data of others with the same disease and see how they are doing in context with others. Members of the site use social tools such as forums, private messages, and profile comments to give and receive support from others, a support mechanism that has been shown to help improve their management and perceived control.&lt;ref name="PLM User Survey"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wicks P, Massagli M, Frost J, Brownstein C, Okun S, Vaughan T, Bradley R, Heywood J | title = Sharing health data for better outcomes on PatientsLikeMe | journal = Journal of Medical Internet Research | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = e19 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20542858 | pmc = 2956230 | doi = 10.2196/jmir.1549 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansion beyond ALS==

PatientsLikeMe launched its first online community for ALS patients in 2006.  From there, the company began adding other communities for other life-changing conditions, including [[multiple sclerosis]] (MS), [[Parkinson's disease]], [[fibromyalgia]], [[HIV]], [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], [[mood disorders]], [[epilepsy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Patientslikeme-1003655.html |work = Marketwire | title = UCB and PatientsLikeMe Partner to Give People With Epilepsy a Voice in Advancing Research Jun 15, 2009 07:00 ET }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[organ transplantation]], [[progressive supranuclear palsy]], [[multiple system atrophy]], and [[Devic's disease]] (neuromyelitis optica). The company's approach was to read the scientific literature and listen to patients to identify outcome measures, symptoms, and treatments that were important to patients and could be accurately reported. For example, the development of the MS community involved the development of a new patient reported outcome measure, the MS Rating Scale (MSRS), to ensure patients could accurately determine how their condition was progressing over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wicks P, Vaughan TE, Massagli MP | title = The multiple sclerosis rating scale, revised (MSRS-R): development, refinement, and psychometric validation using an online community | journal = Health and Quality of Life Outcomes | volume = 10 | pages = 70 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22709981 | pmc = 3502161 | doi = 10.1186/1477-7525-10-70 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, building one community at a time was a slow process and the company risked being overly narrow in focus while excluding more than 5,000 patients who had requested new communities as of December 2010.&lt;ref name="hbr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/product/PatientsLikeMe--An-Online/an/511093-PDF-ENG|title=PatientsLikeMe: An Online Community of Patients|website=hbr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, the company expanded its scope and opened its doors to any patient with any condition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.patientslikeme.com/2011/04/11/patientslikeme-calls-all-patients-with-any-condition-to-join PatientsLikeMe Calls All Patients With Any Condition to Join]&lt;/ref&gt; Today the website covers more than 2,700 health conditions, with new members joining daily from the US and other countries around the world.  Of note are the more than 10,000 ALS members, who have helped make PatientsLikeMe’s flagship community the largest online population of ALS patients in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.patientslikeme.com/conditions/9-als-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis|title=ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) symptoms, treatments &amp; patient forums | work = PatientsLikeMe }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, approximately 10 percent of newly diagnosed ALS patients register on the site each month, and 2 percent of all multiple sclerosis patients in the US participate in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/online-communities-foster-data-sharing-communication-and-learning-among-patients-neurologic|title=Online Communities Foster Data-Sharing, Communication, and Learning Among Patients With Neurologic and Other Chronic Diseases | work = AHRQ Health Care Innovations Exchange }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== iCarbonX investment ==
In 2017, PatientsLikeMe entered into a partnership with [[icarbonx|iCarbonX]] to apply next generation biological measures and machine learning to understand more about the basis of human health and disease. iCarbonX, founded in 2015 by renowned genomicist [[Jun Wang (scientist)|Jun Wang]], took an equity position in PatientsLikeMe and is providing multi-omics characterization services to the company.

The partnership makes PatientsLikeMe part of iCarbonX’s Digital Life Alliance, an ecosystem of leading health technology and application companies that are collaborating to digitize and analyze all aspects of life. The iCarbonX ecosystem has invested a total of nearly $400 million in the initial companies that form the alliance: PatientsLikeMe, [[SomaLogic]], HealthTell, [[AOBiome]], GALT, Imagu and Robustnique. The alliance’s ultimate aim is to merge comprehensive biological and patient-generated data with artificial intelligence technology to help people better understand the medical, behavioral and environmental factors in their lives that may accelerate or mitigate disease, and optimize health.

===Online data-sharing platform===
PatientsLikeMe allows members to input real-world data on their conditions, treatment history, side effects, hospitalizations, symptoms, disease-specific functional scores, weight, mood, quality of life and more on an ongoing basis. The result is a detailed longitudinal record – organized into charts and graphs – that allows patients to gain insight and identify patterns. The data-sharing platform is designed to help patients answer the question: “Given my status, what is the best outcome I can hope to achieve, and how do I get there?”.&lt;ref name = "Heywood_2009"&gt;{{cite web | first = Jamie | last = Heywood | name-list-format = vanc | title =  The Big Idea My Brother Inspired | date = October 2009 | url = http://www.ted.com/talks/jamie_heywood_the_big_idea_my_brother_inspired | work = TED Talk }}&lt;/ref&gt; Answers come in the form of shared longitudinal data from other patients with the same condition(s), thus allowing members to place their experiences in context and see what treatments have helped other patients like them. Some communities, such as ALS, feature visual aids such as percentile curves on the patient profile, so that an individual user can see whether their rate of progression is fast, slow, or about average. A seizure tracker for patients with epilepsy helps identify triggers such as missed medication doses, sleep deprivation, or alcohol use,&lt;ref name="healthaffairs.org"&gt;{{cite web | first = Paul | last = Wicks  | first2 = John | last2 = Hixson | name-list-format = vanc | title = The Patient Engagement Pill: Lessons From Epilepsy| date = 7 February 2013 | url = http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2013/02/07/the-patient-engagement-pill-lessons-from-epilepsy/ | work = Health Affairs }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "mood map" for patients with mood disorders helps to show different factors underlying their condition such as emotional control, anxiety, or external stress while all users can look for patterns in their daily health status such as day of the week or time of day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = 1 December 2010 | first = Paul | last = Wicks | name-list-format = vanc | title = Share and Compare: How are you feeling? Find out with InstantMe! | url = http://blog.patientslikeme.com/2010/12/01/how-are-you-feeling-find-out-with-instantme/ | work = PatientsLikeMe }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three studies have been published suggesting that use of the platform improves patient outcomes. A survey conducted in 2010 amongst patients with ALS, MS, Parkinson's disease, HIV, fibromyalgia, and mood disorders found that 72% of users had found the site helpful in learning about a symptom they had experienced, 57% for understanding the side effects of a treatment, 42% in helping them to find another patient like them, amongst others.&lt;ref name="PLM User Survey"/&gt; A second study conducted in epilepsy found that in addition to the earlier benefits reported, patients with epilepsy reported a better understanding of their symptoms (59%), seizures (58%), and symptoms or treatments (55%).&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; The number of benefits they reported from using the site was strongly associated with the number of social connections they made with other members, dubbed the "dose effect curve of friendship".&lt;ref name="healthaffairs.org"/&gt; Finally, a third study conducted with the US Department of Veteran Affairs and the University of California at San Francisco reported statistically significant improvements in validated measures of self-management and self-efficacy in veterans with epilepsy as a result of engaging with the site for a period of six weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hixson JD, Barnes D, Parko K, Durgin T, Van Bebber S, Graham A, Wicks P | title = Patients optimizing epilepsy management via an online community: the POEM Study | journal = Neurology | volume = 85 | issue = 2 | pages = 129–36 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26085605 | pmc = 4515038 | doi = 10.1212/WNL.0000000000001728 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health economics and outcomes research===
One of the ways in which the site makes revenue is by conducting scientific research studies for pharmaceutical companies, typically with an emphasis on issues that are important to both patients and industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quora.com/How-much-are-pharma-companies-willing-to-pay-for-patientslikeme-data|title=How much are pharma companies willing to pay for patientslikeme data? - Quora|website=www.quora.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2011 a partnership with Novartis studied the barriers faced by people with multiple sclerosis in being adherent to taking their medication, which led to the development of an MS Treatment Adherence Questionnaire (MS-TAQ) which was made available to help patients and their doctors identify and address these issues through coping strategies and enhanced communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wicks P, Massagli M, Kulkarni A, Dastani H | title = Use of an online community to develop patient-reported outcome instruments: the Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Adherence Questionnaire (MS-TAQ) | journal = Journal of Medical Internet Research | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = e12 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21266318 | pmc = 3221333 | doi = 10.2196/jmir.1687 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 collaboration with UCB explored factors underlying quality of life in epilepsy and identified a number of issues beyond the occurrence of seizures as being important, including symptoms such as problems concentrating, depression, memory problems, and treatment side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = PatientsLikeMe | title =  Epilepsy community: Factors affecting quality of life | url = http://patientslikeme_posters.s3.amazonaws.com/2013_PatientsLikeMe%20epilepsy%20community-%20factors%20affecting%20quality%20of%20life.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 PatientsLikeMe worked with researchers at Genentech on a study inviting potential clinical trial participants to review study protocols in order to provide input and feedback to make the study more appealing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/acrp/clinicalresearcher_201504/index.php|title=Clinical Researcher - April 2015|website=www.nxtbook.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 collaboration with Novartis published in Nature Biotechnology and Value in Health explored ways in which patients could provide systematic input into guiding drug development to help make it more patient-centered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wicks P, Lowe M, Gabriel S, Sikirica S, Sasane R, Arcona S | title = Increasing patient participation in drug development | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | pages = 134–5 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25658275 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.3145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowe MM, Blaser DA, Cone L, Arcona S, Ko J, Sasane R, Wicks P | title = Increasing Patient Involvement in Drug Development | journal = Value in Health | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 869–878 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27712716 | doi = 10.1016/j.jval.2016.04.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A study published with AstraZeneca in 2016 sought to understand the treatment expectations of women living with ovarian cancer and identified a shift from surviving with the condition to living with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Simacek K, Raja P, Chiauzzi E, Eek D, Halling K | title = What Do Ovarian Cancer Patients Expect From Treatment?: Perspectives From an Online Patient Community | journal = Cancer Nursing | volume = 40 | issue = 5 | pages = E17–E27 | year = 2017 | pmid = 27454765 | doi = 10.1097/NCC.0000000000000415 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such research helps to improve understanding of disease, identify new approaches to management, and generate ideas to improve the products and services developed by pharmaceutical companies.

===Open Research Exchange===
Following the award in 2013 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.patientslikeme.com/press/20130225/77-rwjf-awards-19-million-grant-to-patientslikeme-to-create-worlds-first-open-research-platform-to-develop-patientcentered-health-outcome-measurements|title= RWJF awards $1.9 million grant to PatientsLikeMe to create  world's first open research platform to develop patient-centered health outcome measurements | work = PatientsLikeMe }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2014 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rwjf.org/en/library/articles-and-news/2014/03/patientslikeme-invite-patients-lead-open-research-exchange.html|title=PatientsLikeMe Invites Patients to Lead Research Projects On Open Research Exchange|date=27 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of $4.5m in grants from the [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]], the company developed an online tool called the Open Research Exchange (ORE) that allowed for the rapid creation, prototyping, testing, and validation of patient reported outcome measures, questionnaires that can establish the impact of symptoms and disease on patients. During the period of the grant, a number of academic collaborators were invited to develop measures on the platform including measures of treatment burden, hypertension management, feelings of satiety in diabetes and treatment burden in chronic illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rwjf.org/en/library/articles-and-news/2013/08/patientslikeme-selects-first-pilot-users.html|title=PatientsLikeMe Selects First Pilot Users For Open Research Exchange™|date=13 August 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tool offers researchers the ability to rapidly get input from large numbers of patients in a matter of weeks or months &lt;ref name="biomedcentral.com"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tran VT, Harrington M, Montori VM, Barnes C, Wicks P, Ravaud P | title = Adaptation and validation of the Treatment Burden Questionnaire (TBQ) in English using an internet platform | journal = BMC Medicine | volume = 12 | pages = 109 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24989988 | pmc = 4098922 | doi = 10.1186/1741-7015-12-109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to much slower forms of research which can take years to complete.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rothman M, Gnanaskathy A, Wicks P, Papadopoulos EJ | title = Can we use social media to support content validity of patient-reported outcome instruments in medical product development? | journal = Value in Health | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–4 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25595228 | doi = 10.1016/j.jval.2014.10.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of tools such as the Treatment Burden Questionnaire &lt;ref name="biomedcentral.com"/&gt; and the Suicide Ideation and Behavior Assessment Tool (SIBAT)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Alphs L, Canuso C, Williamson D | collaboration = SIBAT Consortium | publisher = Janssen Research and Development | title = Suicide Ideation and Behavior Assessment Tool (SIBAT): A Novel Measure of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior and Perceived Suicide Risk| url = https://patientslikeme_posters.s3.amazonaws.com/2015_Suicide%20Ideation%20and%20Behavior%20Assessment%20Tool%20SIBAT%20A%20Novel%20Measure%20of%20Suicidal%20Ideation%20and%20Behavior%20and%20Perceived%20Suicide%20Risk.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; have been published in the scientific literature for use by researchers and an editorial co-authored with industry leaders and a researcher at the FDA outlined ways in which PROs developed on the ORE could be used for the development of new medicines.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; In addition to the traditional scientist-lead instruments, one instrument was developed by a person living with MS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-search-for-a-better-definition-of-pain-1427736432|title=The Search for a Better Definition of Pain|journal=Wall Street Journal|first=Amy Dockser|last=Marcus | name-list-format = vanc |date=30 March 2015|via=www.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 RWJF grant for $900,000 charters PatientsLikeMe to work with the National Quality Forum to develop new measures for healthcare performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first = Anne F. | last = Weiss | name-list-format = vanc | url = http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2016/03/01/patients-must-be-part-of-defining-quality-and-increasing-value/ |title=Patients Must Be Part Of Defining Quality And Increasing Value |work=Health Affairs | date = 1 March 2016 | access-date=2017-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific work==
A key differentiator of the site from more traditional online support groups, message boards, social media sites and list-serves is the emphasis on structured quantitative data which can be aggregated and used for research purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weber GM, Mandl KD, Kohane IS | title = Finding the missing link for big biomedical data | journal = JAMA | volume = 311 | issue = 24 | pages = 2479–80 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24854141 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2014.4228 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has permitted PatientsLikeMe's research team to author more than 100 peer-reviewed published scientific articles in collaboration with academic and commercial partners in leading journals such as the BMJ, Nature Biotechnology, and Neurology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.patientslikeme.com/research/publications | title = PatientsLikeMe's Publications | work = PatientsLikeMe's}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, PatientsLikeMe has been mentioned by others in more than 3,000 published articles in the scientific literature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=patientslikeme|title=patientslikeme - Google Scholar|website=scholar.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been featured as a business case study by the Harvard Business Review.&lt;ref name="hbr.org"/&gt; The company has also invited researchers to become embedded with the company such as an in-depth study explaining the organization of the platform and highlighting some of the challenges that social media and patient-centred research models are facing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/01972243.2015.998108 |title=Governing PatientsLike ''Me'': Information Production and Research Through an Open, Distributed, and Data-Based Social Media Network |journal=The Information Society |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=193–211 |year=2015 |last1=Tempini |first1=Niccolò | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1287/isre.2014.0544 |title=Patient Data as Medical Facts: Social Media Practices as a Foundation for Medical Knowledge Creation |journal=Information Systems Research |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=817–833 |year=2014 |last1=Kallinikos |first1=Jannis |last2=Tempini |first2=Niccolò | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wherever possible, PatientsLikeMe has a policy of publishing its research output in open access form, so that patients, clinicians, and researchers can easily access their scientific output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.plos.org/speakingofmedicine/2012/06/14/open-access-is-not-for-scientists-its-for-patients/|title=Open Access Is Not for Scientists. It's for Patients. - Speaking of Medicine|date=14 June 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instruments and questionnaires developed on PatientsLikeMe such as the MS Rating Scale or MS Treatment Adherence Questionnaire are licensed under [[Creative Commons]] so that they can be used freely by the community without complex or costly licensing requirements. The company also provides patients that take part in its studies with "givebacks" which concisely and rapidly give them feedback in lay language as to the results of research in which they have participated so they can understand how donating their data has been useful for research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Update and results the patient voice analysis study | url = http://blog.patientslikeme.com/2015/04/27/update-and-results-the-patient-voice-analysis-study/ | work = PatientsLikeMe }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's best known scientific endeavor relates to an online refutation of a clinical trial in ALS.&lt;ref name = "Heywood_2009" /&gt; In 2008, a small Italian study was published suggesting that [[lithium (medication)|lithium carbonate]] could slow the progression of ALS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fornai F, Longone P, Cafaro L, Kastsiuchenka O, Ferrucci M, Manca ML, Lazzeri G, Spalloni A, Bellio N, Lenzi P, Modugno N, Siciliano G, Isidoro C, Murri L, Ruggieri S, Paparelli A | title = Lithium delays progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 105 | issue = 6 | pages = 2052–7 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18250315 | pmc = 2538879 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0708022105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, hundreds of members of PatientsLikeMe with the disease began taking the drug off-label.&lt;ref name="PLM NatBio 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brownstein CA, Brownstein JS, Williams DS, Wicks P, Heywood JA | title = The power of social networking in medicine | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 27 | issue = 10 | pages = 888–90 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19816437 | doi = 10.1038/nbt1009-888 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the self-reported data of 348 ALS patients and taking just nine months to complete, PatientsLikeMe conducted a study which demonstrated that lithium did not slow the progress of the disease.&lt;ref name="PLM Lithium"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wicks P, Vaughan TE, Massagli MP, Heywood J | title = Accelerated clinical discovery using self-reported patient data collected online and a patient-matching algorithm | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 29 | issue = 5 | pages = 411–4 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21516084 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.1837 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The team suggested that online collection of patient self-report data was no substitute for randomized placebo-controlled trials, but it might be a useful new form of clinical research in certain circumstances.

A '''pot-in-pot refrigerator''', '''clay pot cooler'''&lt;ref name="Peter Rinker"&gt;{{cite web | title = The clay pot cooler – an appropriate cooling technology | work = Peter Rinker / Movement website | url = http://www.movement-verein.org/downloads/Movement_Clay-pot-cooler_english.pdf | accessdate = 2014-06-17 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140714185554/http://www.movement-verein.org/downloads/Movement_Clay-pot-cooler_english.pdf | archivedate = 14 July 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''zeer''' ({{lang-ar|زير}}) is an [[evaporative cooling]] [[refrigeration]] device which does not use electricity. It uses a [[porous]] outer [[earthenware]] pot (lined with wet sand) containing an inner pot (which can be [[ceramic glaze|glaze]]d to prevent penetration by the liquid) within which the food is placed. The evaporation of the outer liquid draws heat from the inner pot. The device can cool any substance, and requires only a flow of relatively dry air and a source of water.

== History ==
There is some evidence that evaporative cooling was used as early as the [[Old Kingdom]] of Egypt, around 2500 B.C. Frescos show slaves fanning water jars, which would increase air flow around the porous jars and aid evaporation, cooling the contents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Evans | first = Lisa | title = The Advent of Mechanical Refrigeration Alters Daily Life and National Economies Throughout the World  | accessdate = 2010-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These jars exist even today and are called "zeer", hence the name of the pot cooler.

Many earthenware pots were discovered in [[Indus Valley Civilization]] around 3000 BC which were probably used for storing as well as cooling water similar to the present-day ghara and [[Matki (earthen pot)|matki]] used in India and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;George F. Dales, Jonathan M. Kenoyer, Leslie Alcock. ''Excavations at Mohenjo Daro, Pakistan: the pottery''&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being developed in Northern Africa, the technology appears to have been forgotten with the advent of modern electrical refrigerators. However, in the Indian Subcontinent, ghara, matka and surahi, which are different types of earthenware water pots are used to cool water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fuelefficiency.org/?q=node/132 |title=Cold water in rural India : matka(earthen ware) &amp;#124; |publisher=fuel efficiency.org |author=prkhitman |date=2009-06-27 |accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Spain, ''[[botijo]]s'' are popular. A botijo is a porous clay container used to keep and to cool water; they have been in use for centuries, and are still relatively widespread. Botijos are favored most by the low Mediterranean climate; locally, the cooling effect is known as "botijo effect".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urcomante.uva.es/Urcopedia/Ing-Botijo.php |title=The Origin of the Botijo |publisher=Universidad de Valladolid |date= |accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museucantir.org/documents/8_Guide_english.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406053141/http://www.museucantir.org/documents/8_Guide_english.pdf |archivedate=6 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1890s gold miners in Australia developed the [[Coolgardie safe]], based on the same principles.

In rural northern Nigeria in the 1990s [[Mohammed Bah Abba|Mohamed Bah Abba]] developed the Pot-in-Pot Preservation Cooling System, consisting of a small earthenware pot placed inside a larger one, and the space between the two filled with moist sand. The inner pot is filled with fruit, vegetables or soft drinks and covered with a wet cloth.

Abba, who hails from a family of potmakers, tapped into the large unemployed local workforce and hired skilled pot makers to mass-produce the first batch of 5,000 Pot-in-Pots.&lt;ref name="Kanwaljit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uwec.edu/geography/ivogeler/w111/articles/pots.htm|last=Soin|first=Kanwaljit|publisher=UWEC|accessdate=4 January 2014 |title=The Art of Pottery in Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received the Rolex Award for Enterprise in 2001 and used his $75,000 award to make the invention available throughout Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1936165_1936254_1936632,00.html|title=Best inventions of 2001: Food Cooling System|last=Anon|year=2001|work=Time: Lists|publisher=Time|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abba devised an educational campaign tailored to village life and the illiterate population featuring a video-recorded play by local actors to dramatise the benefits of the desert refrigerator. The pots sell at 40 US cents a pair.&lt;ref name="Kanwaljit"/&gt;

After the millennium several international NGOs started to work on the dissemination of this technology in various African countries: Practical Action in Sudan and Humanity first in Gambia and Movement e.V. in Burkina Faso.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Rinker |first=Peter |date=2014-04-15 |title=The clay pot cooler – an appropriate cooling technology |url=https://movement-verein.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/informationen_projekte_clay_pot_cooler_2014_en.pdf |page=2 |location= |publisher=Movement e.V. |accessdate=2016-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extensive research has also been done in Mali by D-Lab in partnership with World Vegetable Center. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Eric Verploegen, Ousmane Sanogo|first=Takemore Chagomoka|title=Evaporative Cooling Technologies for Improved Vegetable Storage in Mali | url=http://d-lab.mit.edu/sites/default/files/Evaporative%20Cooling%20Technologies%20for%20Improved%20Vegetable%20Storage%20in%20Mali%20-%20Appendix.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==

[[File:Clay pot cooler - Canari Frigo - Tonkrugkühler.PNG|thumb|Functioning of a clay pot cooler]]A ''zeer'' is constructed by placing a clay pot within a larger clay pot with wet sand in between the pots and a wet cloth on top.&lt;ref name="practical-action"&gt;{{cite web | title = How a zeer pot fridge makes food last longer | work = Practical Action website | url = http://practicalaction.org/zeer-pot-fridge | accessdate = 2010-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The device cools as the water evaporates, allowing refrigeration in hot, dry climate. It must be placed in a dry, ventilated space for the water to evaporate effectively towards the outside. Evaporative coolers tend to perform poorly or not at all in climates with high ambient [[humidity]], since the water is not able to evaporate well under these conditions.

If there is an [[Permeation|impermeable]] separation layer between the food and the porous pots, undrinkable water such as [[seawater]] can be used to drive the cooling process, without contaminating the food. This is useful in arid locations near the ocean where drinkable water is a limited commodity, and can be accomplished by using a pot that has waterproof [[ceramic glaze|glaze]] or cement &lt;ref name="Peter Rinker"/&gt; applied to the inner wall where the food is stored.

Extended operation is possible if the pots are able to draw water from a storage container, such as an inverted airtight jar, or if the pots are placed in a shallow pool of water. A strap can be used to tie the inner pot down instead of using sand to prevent it from floating.

Alternatives to the Pot-in-Pot construction include various versions of a simple Pot-in-Dish. For larger storage capacity, evaporative cooling chambers (ECCs) can be constructed from a double walled brick structure with a straw and wood cover. The same basic operating principles apply. Detailed information on construction materials and methods can be found in the D-Lab best practices guide. &lt;ref name="Best Practices"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Eric Verploegen, Peter Rinker|first=Kukom Edoh Ognakossan|title=Evaporative Cooling Best Practices, Producing and using evaporative cooling chambers and clay pot coolers | url=http://d-lab.mit.edu/sites/default/files/Evaporative%20Cooling%20Best%20Practices%20Guide.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operating Conditions ==

Several key considerations are important for determining if an evaporative cooling device will provide effective cooling and storage. ECCs and clay pot coolers provide the most benefits when they are used in low humidity climates (less than 40% relative humidity), the temperature is relatively hot (maximum daily temperature greater than 25 °C), water is available to add to the device between one and three times per day, and the device can be located in a shady and well-ventilated area. If any of these key criteria cannot be met at the time when improved vegetable storage is needed, then ECCs or clay pot coolers may not provide sufficient benefits to justify their use. &lt;ref name="Best Practices"/&gt;

== Effectiveness ==

The effectiveness of evaporative cooling varies with the temperature, humidity and airflow. Given a constant flow of cool dry air, evaporative cooling can achieve temperatures as low as the wet bulb temperature, the 100% humidity condition at the given temperature. Documented tables &lt;ref&gt;http://rebuildingcivilization.com/content/build-evaporative-refrigerator-no-moving-parts-no-electricity&lt;/ref&gt;show the minimum temperature that can be achieved at different starting temperatures and percent humidities.

To determine the effectiveness of evaporative cooling chambers for specific uses it is helpful to evaluate the following questions:

What type of vegetables or other products are in need of improved storage?

ECCs or clay pot coolers provide benefits if post-harvest vegetable spoilage is the result of exposure to high temperatures, low humidity, animals, or insects. Some examples of vegetables that are particularly vulnerable to these conditions include eggplants, tomatoes, leafy greens, peppers, and okra. See the “Conclusions and Additional Resources” section of the Best Practices Guide &lt;ref name="Best Practices"/&gt; for a more complete list of vegetables that can benefit from storage in an evaporative cooling device. Non- electric evaporative cooling devices – such as ECCs and clay pot coolers – are not suitable for items that require sustained temperatures below 20 °C (medicine, meat, and dairy products) or foods that require a low humidity environment (onions, coffee, garlic, millet, and other grains).

What volume of vegetables needs to be stored at any one time?

It is necessary to estimate the volume of vegetables in need of improved storage at any given time to determine the appropriate size of the evaporative cooling device. If the vegetables can fit into a clay pot with a capacity of 150 liters or less, then a clay pot cooler is most appropriate. Individuals or groups that need to store larger amounts of vegetables can consider an ECC. A brick ECC can be designed to accommodate the storage volumes between roughly 500 and 5,000 liters, see the “Construction of Evaporative Cooling Chambers” section of the Best Practices Guide. &lt;ref name="Best Practices"/&gt; 

How often is improved vegetable storage needed?

Variations in the need for improved vegetable storage can arise due to seasonal growing and harvest cycles, vegetable production surpluses relative to local demand, and climate variations. It is important to determine if proper operating conditions exist for evaporative cooling to effectively provide benefits during the time when vegetable storage is needed, and if the need for improved vegetable storage is frequent enough that the value an ECC or clay pot cooler can provide is greater than its cost.

== Impact ==

Pot-in-pot refrigeration has had multiple positive impacts on the population that uses them beyond the simple ability to keep food fresh for longer periods of time and decreasing instances of food-related disease.&lt;ref name="practical-action" /&gt;

* Increased profits from food sales: As there is no rush to sell food to avoid spoilage, farmers are able to sell their produce on demand and can command higher prices.
* Increased opportunities for women: Women can sell food directly from their homes, decreasing their dependence on their husbands as sole providers. Also, because girls traditionally take food to market to sell, and because food in the ''zeer'' stays fresh long enough that they can go to market once a week rather than once a day, there is more time for them to attend school.{{CN|date=July 2016}}
* Rural employment opportunities: Farmers are able to support themselves with their increased profits at market, slowing the move into cities. Also, the creation of the pots themselves generates job opportunities.
* Increased diet variety because food is available for longer into the year.
* The ability to store vaccines and medicines that would otherwise be unavailable in areas without refrigeration facilities.&lt;ref name="Abraham"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abraham|first=Martin A. A|title=Sustainability Science and Engineering: Defining Principles|publisher=Elsevier|edition=Google ebook|pages=30, 31|chapter=The Twelve Principles of Green Engineering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YgSD_2QpGKoC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=earthenware+cooling+device&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=60zoRXu2Of&amp;sig=l6qZTwkGeyqZzIWaU8SmPX58Pc4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=e1vHUoLwM4GrhQfvnoCgCQ&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=earthenware%20cooling%20device&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''zeer'' costs about 150 [[Nigerian naira|naira]] (approximately {{US$|1.00}} in 2011) to make in Nigeria, and they sell for 180-200 naira ({{US$|1.20}} to {{US$|1.30}} in 2011).

'''PowerBar, Inc.''' is an [[United States|American]] maker of [[energy bar]]s and other related products including [[sports drink]]s, [[energy gel|gels]], and the ''Pria'' bars targeted at women.

==History==
With Mike McCollum, the PowerBar company was founded by [[Brian Maxwell]], a [[Canada|Canadian]] athlete and entrepreneur and Maxwell's girlfriend, Jennifer Biddulph, a nutritionist and distance runner who later became his wife, in their kitchen. They used $55,000 in cash to launch the company in 1986 in [[Berkeley, California]]. This was the first "energy bar" for use during competition by endurance athletes, such as ultra marathoners, and cyclists.&lt;ref name=Biddulph&gt;[https://runningmagazine.ca/raising-the-power-bar-the-brian-maxwell-story/ Raising the Power Bar: The Brian Maxwell story], ''Running Magazine'', Dan Hill, September 21, 2010. Retrieved November 10, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; They eventually acquired a headquarters building in downtown Berkeley.

The company eventually reached $150 million in sales before being purchased by [[Nestlé]] in 2000 for $375 million.&lt;ref name=Biddulph /&gt; In February 2007, PowerBar moved its headquarters from [[Berkeley, California]] to the [[Nestlé]] headquarters in [[Glendale, California]]. With the move came the hiring of an entirely new marketing team.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

On February 3, 2014, [[Post Foods|Post Holdings]] announced it had reached an agreement to acquire PowerBar, Musashi and related worldwide assets from [[Nestlé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.drugstorenews.com/article/post-acquires-powerbar-musashi-brands-nestle | title=Post acquires PowerBar, Musashi brands from Nestlé | work=Drug Store News | date=February 3, 2014 | accessdate=February 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pre-eruption guidance''' is an [[orthodontic]] treatment method that allows for expansion of existing [[Tooth eruption|erupting teeth]] long before they appear in the mouth. The use off pre-eruption guidance appliances and the timing of [[Dental extraction|extractions]] of certain [[deciduous teeth]] aligns the teeth naturally as opposed to orthodontic mechanical movement of [[permanent teeth]] into alignment after they have erupted. Research shows that pre-eruption guidance produces far more stable tooth alignment than alternative treatments.&lt;ref&gt;American Journal of Orthodontics and DentoFacial Orthopedics "Preventive Treatment of Ectopically Erupting Maxillary Permanent Canines by Extraction of Deciduous Canines and First Molars: A Randomized Clinical Trial"  March 2011. http://www.ajodo.org/article/S0889-5406(10)00764-X/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

As defined by the [[American Dental Association]] and The [[American Association of Orthodontists]], pre-eruption guidance therapy is a treatment method instituted with the use of bimaxillary bilateral removable space maintainers and the removal of the maxillary right and left deciduous [[cuspids]] [baby teeth] at very specific times to allow for a more optimal eruption pattern for permanent teeth to enter the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;American Dental Association's Current Dental Terminology User's Manuel, 2012 Edition as CODE 8060 (Appendix 1), “Interceptive Orthodontic Treatment of the Transitional Dentition.”  http://www.dhhs.nh.gov/ombp/medicaid/children/documents/dpm.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; An integral part of the success of this treatment is the timely removal of certain deciduous teeth.

Pre-eruption guidance is distinctive because unlike other approaches, a patients' treatment results are achieved [[Physiology|physiologically]] through muscle movements and removable functional spacer maintainers.&lt;ref&gt;The guidance of Eruption Without Extraction: http://ejo.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/suppl_1/i107.full&lt;/ref&gt; instead of mechanically through [[dental braces]]. This alleviates the need for braces to mechanically align or essentially repair the effects of mature teeth that erupted misaligned and crowded.&lt;ref&gt;[[Orthodontic braces]]&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of early, interceptive orthodontic treatment can be started on certain types of tooth problems before all teeth have erupted. Pre-eruption guidance treatment is usually begun after the four permanent upper and lower front teeth have erupted (approximately age seven).&lt;ref&gt;http://dentistry.hsc.wvu.edu/Orthodontics/MediaLibraries/Dentistry-Orthodontics/Media/early-treatments-pubs/Guidance-of-eruption-for-general-practitioners.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of this treatment for a child of that age is to normalize and naturalize the [[dentition]] and then to allow the daily use of durable [[Retainer (orthodontics)|orthodontic retainers]] and the patient’s natural muscle development to guide future erupting teeth into an optimal position in the mouth over time.

In some cases a second phase of treatment is necessary. This additional phase is significantly shorter and can be completed by the time patients who are not undergoing pre-eruption guidance are first beginning their treatments.

Cases in which the pre-eruption guidance process would be beneficial include improvement of dental alignment and correction of a [[Malocclusion|functional occlusion]] (severe deep bite, severe [[overjet]], constricted maxillary width, blocked out maxillary cuspids, lower crowding).&lt;ref&gt;Dentofacial Changes after Orthodontic Intervention with Eruption Guidance Appliance in the Early Mixed Dentition:  http://www.angle.org/doi/abs/10.2319/012607-37.1&lt;/ref&gt;

One benefit of the pre-eruption guidance approach is not having to surgically remove any of the patient’s permanent teeth. Additionally, patients undergoing pre-eruption guidance therapy often do not require a later phase of treatment involving application of fixed braces or permanent tooth extractions performed by an [[Oral and maxillofacial surgery|oral surgeon]]. This preventive treatment process may ensure a patient’s teeth will erupt in a more ideal position and maintain their erupted position for the rest of the patients life.&lt;ref&gt;Treatment stability with the eruption guidance appliance. http://uningateresina.com.br/Dimon/Arquivos/Artigos/13279707934f2739e9e14b6.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, like any orthodontic treatment, it is heavily dependent on the patients cooperation and support to succeed.

Due to the method’s reliance on achieving results working with the patient’s own physiology to align their teeth, practitioners help the patients achieve proper alignment for minimal cost. Patients may also avoid more expensive, later staged treatments involving permanent tooth extractions, longer time with fixed appliances, and additional visits to the orthodontist.

'''Pulp capping''' is a technique used in [[dental restorations]] to prevent the [[dental pulp]] from necrosis, after being exposed, or nearly exposed during a cavity preparation. When [[dental caries]] is &lt;!-- "caries" is not plural, this sentence is already grammatically correct, please do not replace "is" with "are" --&gt;removed from a tooth, all or most of the infected and softened enamel and dentin are removed.  This can lead to the pulp of the tooth either being exposed or nearly exposed which causes [[pulpitis]] (inflammation).  Pulpitis, in turn, can become irreversible, leading to pain and pulp necrosis, and necessitating either [[root canal treatment]] or [[dental extraction|extraction]].&lt;ref name="Stockton"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.cda-adc.ca/jcda/vol-65/issue-6/328.html | title=Vital Pulp Capping: A Worthwhile Procedure (review) | vauthors = Stockton LW | journal=J Can Dent Assoc | year=1999 | volume=65 | issue=6 | pages=328–31| pmid=10412240 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate goal of pulp capping or stepwise caries removal is to protect a healthy [[dental pulp]] and avoid the need for [[root canal therapy]].

To prevent the pulp from deteriorating when a dental restoration gets near the pulp, the dentist will place a small amount of a sedative dressing, such as [[calcium hydroxide]] or [[Mineral trioxide aggregate|MTA]].  These materials, protect the pulp from noxious agents (heat, cold, bacteria) and stimulate the [[Pulp (tooth)#structure|cell-rich zone]] of the pulp to lay down a bridge of [[Dentin#Tertiary dentin .28including Reparative Dentin or Sclerotic Dentin.29 - pathologic|reparative dentin]].  Dentin formation usually starts within 30 days of the pulp capping (there can be a delay in onset of dentin formation if the [[odontoblast]]s of the pulp are injured during cavity removal) and is largely completed by 130 days.&lt;ref name="hargreaves2011"&gt;{{cite book | title= Cohen's Pathways of the Pulp | edition = Tenth | publisher=Mosby Elsevier | vauthors = Hargreaves K | year=2011 | location=St. Louis, Missouri | isbn = 978-0-323-06489-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|491–494}}

Two different types of pulp cap are distinguished. In ''direct pulp capping'', the protective dressing is placed directly over an exposed pulp; and in ''indirect pulp capping'', a thin layer of softened dentin, that if removed would expose the pulp, is left in place and the protective dressing is placed on top.&lt;ref name=EUconsensus /&gt; A direct pulp cap is a one-stage procedure, whereas a stepwise caries removal is a two-stage procedure over about six months.

== Direct ==
This technique is used when a pulpal exposure occurs, either due to caries extending to the pulp chamber, or accidentally, during caries removal. It is only feasible if the exposure is made through non infected dentin and there is no recent history of spontaneous pain (i.e. irreversible pulpitis) and a bacteria-tight seal can be applied.&lt;ref name=EUconsensus /&gt; Once the exposure is made, the tooth is isolated from saliva to prevent contamination by use of a [[dental dam]], if it was not already in place. The tooth is then washed and dried, and the protective material placed, followed finally by a dental restoration which gives a bacteria-tight seal to prevent infection. Since pulp capping is not always successful in maintaining the vitality of the pulp, the dentist will usually keep the status of the tooth under review for about 1 year after the procedure.&lt;ref name=EUconsensus /&gt;

In 1938, Bodecker introduced the Stepwise Caries Excavation (SWE) Technique for treatment of teeth with deep caries for preservation of Pulp vitality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Banava|first1=Sepideh|title=Stepwise Excavation: A Conservative Community-Based Dental Treatment of Deep Caries to Inhibit Pulpal Exposure|journal=Iran J Public Health|date=2011|volume=40|issue=3|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This technique is used when most of the decay has been removed from a deep cavity, but some softened dentin and decay remains over the pulp chamber that if removed would expose the pulp and trigger irreversible pulpitis. Instead, the dentist intentionally leaves the softened dentin/decay in place, and uses a layer of protective temporary material which promotes remineralization of the softened dentin over the pulp and the laying down of new layers of tertiary dentin in the pulp chamber.
The color of the carious lesion changes from light brown to dark brown, the consistency goes from soft and wet to hard and dry so that Streptococcus Mutans and Lactobacilli have been significantly reduced to a limited number or even zero viable organisms and the radiographs show no change or even a decrease in the radiolucent zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hilton|first1=Thomas J|title=Keys to Clinical Success with Pulp Capping: A Review of the Literature|journal=Operative Dentistry|date=2009|volume=34|issue=5|pages=615–625}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A temporary filling is used to keep the material in place, and about 6 months later, the cavity is re-opened and hopefully there is now enough sound dentin over the pulp (a "dentin bridge") that any residual softened dentin can be removed and a permanent filling can be placed. This method is also called "stepwise caries removal."&lt;ref name=EUconsensus&gt;{{cite journal | title = Quality guidelines for endodontic treatment: consensus report of the European Society of Endodontology | journal = International Endodontic Journal | volume = 39 | issue = 12 | pages = 921–30 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17180780 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2591.2006.01180.x | author1 = European Society of Endodontology }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwedicke"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwendicke F, Dörfer CE, Paris S | title = Incomplete caries removal: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Journal of Dental Research | volume = 92 | issue = 4 | pages = 306–14 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23396521 | doi = 10.1177/0022034513477425 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The difficulty with this technique is estimating how rapid the carious process has been,how much tertiary dentine has been formed and knowing exactly when to stop excavating to avoid pulp exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=David Ricketts|first1=David|title=Restorative dentistry: Management of the deep carious lesion and the vital pulp dentine complex|journal=British Dental Journal|date=2001|volume=191|issue=11|pages=606–610|doi=10.1038/sj.bdj.4801246|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/4801246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Materials ==
The following materials have been studied as potential materials for direct pulp capping. However, calcium hydroxide and mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) are the preferred material of choice in clinical practice due to their favourable outcome.

=== Zinc oxide eugenol ===
Zinc Oxide Eugenol (ZOE) is a commonly used material in dentistry. The use of ZOE as a pulp capping material remains controversial. This is due to Eugenol, being cytotoxic to the pulp are present in large quantity in this formulation. Also due to its nature of non-adhesive, it leads to poor coronal seal hence increases micro-leakage. Studies have demonstrated unfavourable results for ZOE when compared to calcium hydroxide as a direct pulp capping material as it causes pulpal necrosis.&lt;ref name="Hilton_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hilton TJ | title = Keys to clinical success with pulp capping: a review of the literature | journal = Operative Dentistry | volume = 34 | issue = 5 | pages = 615–25 | date = 2009 | pmid = 19830978 | pmc = 2856472 | doi = 10.2341/09-132-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Glass and resin modified glass ionomer ===
Both Glass Ionomer (GI) and Resin Modified Glass Ionomer (RMGIC) has been widely used as a lining or base material for deep cavities where pulp is in close proximity. This is due to its superior properties of good biocompatibility and adhesive nature, providing coronal seal to prevent bacteria infiltration. However, they are not a material of choice for direct pulp capping. When the use of RMGIC and calcium hydroxide has been studied as direct pulp capping agents, RMGIC has demonstrated increase in chronic inflammation in pulpal tissues and lack of reparative dentine bridge formation.&lt;ref name="Hilton_2009" /&gt;

=== Adhesive system ===
Materials that fall under this category include 4-META-MMA-TBB adhesives and hybridizing dentine bonding agents. The idea of using adhesive materials for direct pulp capping has been explored two decades ago.  Studies have demonstrated that it encourages bleeding due to its vasodilating properties hence impairing polymerisation of the material, affecting its ability to provide a coronal seal when used as a pulp capping agent. In addition, the material triggers chronic inflammation even without the presence of bacteria makes it an unfavourable condition for pulp healing to take place. Most importantly, its toxicity to human pulp cells once again makes it an unacceptable material of choice.&lt;ref name="Hilton_2009" /&gt;

=== Calcium hydroxide cement ===
Calcium hydroxide (CaOH) is an organo-metallic cement that was introduced into dentistry in the early twentieth century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Foreman PC, Barnes IE | title = Review of calcium hydroxide | language = en | journal = International Endodontic Journal | volume = 23 | issue = 6 | pages = 283–97 | date = November 1990 | pmid = 2098345 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2591.1990.tb00108.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there have since been many advantages to this material described in much of the available literature. CaOH has a high antimicrobial activity which has been shown to be outstanding.&lt;ref name="Stuart_1991"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stuart KG, Miller CH, Brown CE, Newton CW | title = The comparative antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide | journal = Oral Surgery, Oral Medicine, and Oral Pathology | volume = 72 | issue = 1 | pages = 101–4 | date = July 1991 | pmid = 1891227 | doi=10.1016/0030-4220(91)90198-l}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barthel CR, Levin LG, Reisner HM, Trope M | title = TNF-alpha release in monocytes after exposure to calcium hydroxide treated Escherichia coli LPS | journal = International Endodontic Journal | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 155–9 | date = May 1997 | pmid = 9477798 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one experiment conducted by Stuart et al. (1991), bacteria-inoculated root canals of extracted human teeth were treated with CaOH for 1 hour against a control group with no treatment and the results yielded 64-100% reductions in all viable bacteria.&lt;ref name="Stuart_1991" /&gt; CaOH also has a high pH and high solubility, thus it readily leaches into the surrounding tissues.&lt;ref name="McCabe_2008"&gt;{{cite book|title=Applied Dental Materials|last=McCabe|first=John F.|last2=Walls|first2=Angus W. G. | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=281–282|chapter=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This alkaline environment created around the cement has been suggested to give beneficial irritancy to pulpal tissues and stimulates dentine regeneration. One study further demonstrated that CaOH causes release of growth factors TGF-B1 and bioactive molecules from the dentine matrix which induces the formation of dentine bridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Graham L, Cooper PR, Cassidy N, Nor JE, Sloan AJ, Smith AJ | title = The effect of calcium hydroxide on solubilisation of bio-active dentine matrix components | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 27 | issue = 14 | pages = 2865–73 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16427123 | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2005.12.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CaOH does however have significant disadvantages. The set cement has low compressive strength and cannot withstand or support condensation of a restoration.&lt;ref name="McCabe_2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arandi NZ | title = Calcium hydroxide liners: a literature review | journal = Clinical, Cosmetic and Investigational Dentistry | volume = 9 | pages = 67–72 | date = 2017-07-13 | pmid = 28761378 | pmc = 5516779 | doi = 10.2147/CCIDE.S141381 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus good practice to place a stronger separate lining material (e.g. glass ionomer or resin-modified glass ionomer) over CaOH before packing the final restorative material.&lt;ref name="Hilton_2009" /&gt; CaOH cement is not adhesive to tooth tissues and thus does not provide a coronal seal.&lt;ref name="Hilton_2009" /&gt; In pulp perfusion studies, CaOH has shown to insufficiently seal all dentinal tubules, and presence of tunnel defects (patent communications within reparative dentine connecting pulp and exposure sites) indicate a potential for microleakage when CaOH is used.&lt;ref name="McCabe_2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cox CF, Sübay RK, Ostro E, Suzuki S, Suzuki SH | title = Tunnel defects in dentin bridges: their formation following direct pulp capping | journal = Operative Dentistry | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–11 | date = January 1996 | pmid = 8957909 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that an adhesive coronal restoration be used above the CaOH lining to provide adequate coronal seal. 
Because of its many advantageous properties and long-standing success in clinical use, it has been used as a control material in multiple experiments with pulp capping agents over the years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Accorinte ML, Loguercio AD, Reis A, Costa CA | title = Response of human pulps capped with different self-etch adhesive systems | journal = Clinical Oral Investigations | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 119–27 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18027004 | doi = 10.1007/s00784-007-0161-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Souza Costa CA, Lopes do Nascimento AB, Teixeira HM, Fontana UF | title = Response of human pulps capped with a self-etching adhesive system | journal = Dental Materials | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 230–40 | date = May 2001 | pmid = 11257296 | doi=10.1016/s0109-5641(00)00076-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered the gold standard dental material for direct pulp capping to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter-url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323287456000132 | title = McDonald and Avery's Dentistry for the Child and Adolescent | edition = Tenth | chapter = Chapter 13 – Treatment of Deep Caries, Vital Pulp Exposure, and Pulpless Teeth | first = Jeffrey A. | last = Dean | name-list-format = vanc | isbn = 978-0-323-28745-6 | date = September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mineral trioxide aggregate ===
Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) is a recent development of the 1990s&lt;ref name="Camilleri_2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Camilleri J, Pitt Ford TR | title = Mineral trioxide aggregate: a review of the constituents and biological properties of the material | language = en | journal = International Endodontic Journal | volume = 39 | issue = 10 | pages = 747–54 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 16948659 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2591.2006.01135.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; initially as a root canal sealer but has seen increased interest in its use as a direct pulp capping material.&lt;ref name="Hilton_2009" /&gt; The material comprises a blend of tricalcium silicate, dicalcium silicate and tricalcium aluminate; bismuth oxide is added to give the cement radiopaque properties to aid radiological investigation.&lt;ref name="Camilleri_2006" /&gt; MTA has been shown to produce CaOH as a hydration product&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Camilleri J | title = Characterization of hydration products of mineral trioxide aggregate | journal = International Endodontic Journal | volume = 41 | issue = 5 | pages = 408–17 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18298574 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2591.2007.01370.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; and maintains an extended duration of high pH in lab conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fridland M, Rosado R | title = MTA solubility: a long term study | journal = Journal of Endodontics | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | pages = 376–9 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15851933 | doi=10.1097/01.don.0000140566.97319.3e}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to CaOH, this alkalinity potentially provides beneficial irritancy and stimulates dentine repair and regeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomson PL, Grover LM, Lumley PJ, Sloan AJ, Smith AJ, Cooper PR | title = Dissolution of bio-active dentine matrix components by mineral trioxide aggregate | journal = Journal of Dentistry | volume = 35 | issue = 8 | pages = 636–42 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17566626 | doi = 10.1016/j.jdent.2007.04.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; MTA has also demonstrated reliable and favourable healing outcomes on human teeth when used as a pulp cap on teeth diagnosed as nothing more severe than reversible pulpitis.&lt;ref name="Bogen_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bogen G, Kim JS, Bakland LK | title = Direct pulp capping with mineral trioxide aggregate: an observational study | journal = Journal of the American Dental Association | volume = 139 | issue = 3 | pages = 305–15; quiz 305–15 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18310735 | doi=10.14219/jada.archive.2008.0160}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also less coronal microleakage of MTA in one experiment comparing it to amalgam&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferk Luketić S, Malcić A, Jukić S, Anić I, Segović S, Kalenić S | title = Coronal microleakage of two root-end filling materials using a polymicrobial marker | journal = Journal of Endodontics | volume = 34 | issue = 2 | pages = 201–3 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18215682 | doi = 10.1016/j.joen.2007.09.019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus suggesting some tooth adhesion properties. MTA also comes in white and grey preparations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Song JS, Mante FK, Romanow WJ, Kim S | title = Chemical analysis of powder and set forms of Portland cement, gray ProRoot MTA, white ProRoot MTA, and gray MTA-Angelus | journal = Oral Surgery, Oral Medicine, Oral Pathology, Oral Radiology, and Endodontics | volume = 102 | issue = 6 | pages = 809–15 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17138186 | doi = 10.1016/j.tripleo.2005.11.034 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which may aid visual identification clinically. 
Disadvantages have also been described for MTA. Grey MTA preparations can potentially cause tooth discolouration.&lt;ref name="Hilton_2009" /&gt; MTA also takes a long time (up to 2 hours 45 minutes) to set completely&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Torabinejad M, Hong CU, McDonald F, Pitt Ford TR | title = Physical and chemical properties of a new root-end filling material | journal = Journal of Endodontics | volume = 21 | issue = 7 | pages = 349–53 | date = July 1995 | pmid = 7499973 | doi = 10.1016/S0099-2399(06)80967-2 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.471.9818 }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus preventing immediate restoration placement without mechanical disruption of the underlying MTA. It has been suggested that a pulp capped with MTA should be temporised to allow for the complete setting of MTA,&lt;ref name="Hilton_2009" /&gt; and the patient to present at a second visit for placement of the permanent restoration.&lt;ref name="Bogen_2008" /&gt; MTA also has for difficult handling properties and is a very expensive material, thus is less cost effective as compared to CaOH.&lt;ref name="Hilton_2009" /&gt;

Although MTA shows great promise which is possibly attributed to its adhesive properties and ability to act as a source of CaOH release,&lt;ref name="Hilton_2009" /&gt; the available literature and experimental studies of MTA is limited due to its recency. Studies that compare pulp capping abilities of MTA to CaOH in human teeth yielded generally equal and similarly successful healing outcomes at a histological level from both materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Accorinte Mde L, Holland R, Reis A, Bortoluzzi MC, Murata SS, Dezan E, Souza V, Alessandro LD | title = Evaluation of mineral trioxide aggregate and calcium hydroxide cement as pulp-capping agents in human teeth | journal = Journal of Endodontics | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–6 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18155482 | doi = 10.1016/j.joen.2007.09.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sawicki L, Pameijer CH, Emerich K, Adamowicz-Klepalska B | title = Histological evaluation of mineral trioxide aggregate and calcium hydroxide in direct pulp capping of human immature permanent teeth | journal = American Journal of Dentistry | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 262–6 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18795524 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Success rates ==
There have been several studies conducted on the success rates of direct and indirect pulp capping using a range of different materials. One study of indirect pulp capping recorded success rates of 98.3% and 95% using bioactive tricalcium silicate [Ca3SiO5]-based dentin substitute and light-activated calcium hydroxide [CA(OH)2]-based liner respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Garrocho-Rangel A, Quintana-Guevara K, Vázquez-Viera R, Arvizu-Rivera JM, Flores-Reyes H, Escobar-García DM, Pozos-Guillén A | title = Bioactive Tricalcium Silicate-based Dentin Substitute as an Indirect Pulp Capping Material for Primary Teeth: A 12-month Follow-up | journal = Pediatric Dentistry | volume = 39 | issue = 5 | pages = 377–382 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 29070160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These results show no significant difference, nor do the results from an indirect pulp capping experiment comparing calcium silicate cement (Biodentine) and glass ionomer cement, which had clinical success rates of 83.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hashem D, Mannocci F, Patel S, Manoharan A, Brown JE, Watson TF, Banerjee A | title = Clinical and radiographic assessment of the efficacy of calcium silicate indirect pulp capping: a randomized controlled clinical trial | journal = Journal of Dental Research | volume = 94 | issue = 4 | pages = 562–8 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25710953 | pmc = 4485218 | doi = 10.1177/0022034515571415 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A further study testing medical Portland cement, Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) and calcium hydroxide in indirect pulp treatment found varying success rates of 73%-93%. This study concluded that indirect pulp capping had a success rate of 90.3% regardless of which material was used but stated that it is preferable to use non-resorbing materials where possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Petrou MA, Alhamoui FA, Welk A, Altarabulsi MB, Alkilzy M, H Splieth C | title = A randomized clinical trial on the use of medical Portland cement, MTA and calcium hydroxide in indirect pulp treatment | journal = Clinical Oral Investigations | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 1383–9 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24043482 | doi = 10.1007/s00784-013-1107-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar studies have been conducted of direct pulp capping, with one study comparing ProRoot Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) and Biodentine which found success rates of 92.6% and 96.4% respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Parinyaprom N, Nirunsittirat A, Chuveera P, Na Lampang S, Srisuwan T, Sastraruji T, Bua-On P, Simprasert S, Khoipanich I, Sutharaphan T, Theppimarn S, Ue-Srichai N, Tangtrakooljaroen W, Chompu-Inwai P | title = Outcomes of Direct Pulp Capping by Using Either ProRoot Mineral Trioxide Aggregate or Biodentine in Permanent Teeth with Carious Pulp Exposure in 6- to 18-Year-Old Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial | journal = Journal of Endodontics | volume = 44 | issue = 3 | pages = 341–348 | date = December 2017 | pmid = 29275850 | doi = 10.1016/j.joen.2017.10.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study was conducted on  6-18 year old patients, while a comparable study conducted on mature permanent teeth found success rates of 84.6% using MTA and 92.3% using Biodentine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Linu S, Lekshmi MS, Varunkumar VS, Sam Joseph VG | title = Treatment Outcome Following Direct Pulp Capping Using Bioceramic Materials in Mature Permanent Teeth with Carious Exposure: A Pilot Retrospective Study | journal = Journal of Endodontics | volume = 43 | issue = 10 | pages = 1635–1639 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 28807371 | doi = 10.1016/j.joen.2017.06.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calcium hydroxide has also been tested on its use in indirect pulp capping and was found to have a success rate of 77.6%, compared to a success rate of 85.9% for MTA in another study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Çalışkan MK, Güneri P | title = Prognostic factors in direct pulp capping with mineral trioxide aggregate or calcium hydroxide: 2- to 6-year follow-up | journal = Clinical Oral Investigations | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 357–367 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27041110 | doi = 10.1007/s00784-016-1798-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A systematic review attempted to compare success rates of direct pulp capping and indirect pulp capping and found that indirect pulp capping had a higher level of success but found a low quality of evidence in studies on direct pulp capping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coll JA, Seale NS, Vargas K, Marghalani AA, Al Shamali S, Graham L | title = Primary Tooth Vital Pulp Therapy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis | journal = Pediatric Dentistry | volume = 39 | issue = 1 | pages = 16–123 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 28292337 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More research will be needed to provide a comprehensive answer.

[[Tertiary care]] is usually done by referral from [[Primary care|primary]] or [[Secondary care|secondary medical care]] personnel.

In the field of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (STDs), referral also means the informing of a partner of a patient diagnosed STD of the potential exposure. ''Patient referral'' is where patients directly inform their partners of their exposure to infection. An alternative is ''provider referral'', where trained health department personnel locate partners on the basis of
the names, descriptions, and addresses provided by the patient to inform the partner.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5511a1.htm Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2006] CDC. August 4, 2006 / 55(RR11);1-94&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program''' ('''RNTCP''') is the state-run [[tuberculosis]] (TB) control initiative of the [[Government of India]]. As per the National Strategic Plan 2012–17, the program has a vision of achieving a "TB free India", and aims to achieve Universal Access to TB control services.&lt;ref name=NSP2012-13&gt;{{cite book|title=National Strategic Plan for Tuberculosis Control, 2012-2017|date=Aug 2012|publisher=Central TB Division, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare|url=http://tbcindia.gov.in/WriteReadData/l892s/3525791619NSP%202012-2017.pdf|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program provides, various free of cost, quality tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment services across the country through the government health system. It seeks to employ the WHO recommended tuberculosis control strategy, [[DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment, Short-Course)|DOTS]](Directly Observed Treatment, Short Course), to the Indian scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nikshay.gov.in/FAQs.htm|title=Project Nikshay|website=nikshay.gov.in|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
India has had an ongoing National TB Program (NTP) since 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhp.gov.in/revised-national-tuberculosis-control-programme_pg|title=Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme {{!}} National Health Portal Of India|website=www.nhp.gov.in|language=en|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to overcome these lacunae, the Government decided to give a new thrust to TB control activities by revitalising the NTP, with assistance from international agencies, in 1993. The Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP) thus formulated, adopted the internationally recommended Directly Observed Treatment Short-course (DOTS) strategy, as the most systematic and cost-effective approach to revitalise the TB control programme in India. Political and administrative commitment, to ensure the provision of organised and comprehensive TB control services was obtained. Adoption of smear microscopy for reliable and early diagnosis was introduced in a decentralized manner in the general health services. DOTS was adopted as a strategy for provision of treatment to increase the treatment completion rates. Supply of drugs was also strengthened to provide assured supply of drugs to meet the requirements of the system.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Large-scale implementation of the RNTCP began in late 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tbfacts.org/rntcp/|title=RNTCP {{!}} Government of India TB Treatment Education &amp; Care|work=TB Facts.org|access-date=2017-07-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expansion of the programme was undertaken in a phased manner with rigid appraisals of the districts prior to starting service delivery. The initial 5-year project plan was to implement the RNTCP in 102 districts of the country and strengthen another 203 Short Course Chemotherapy (SCC) districts for introduction of the revised strategy at a later stage.

The Government of India took up the massive challenge of nationwide expansion of the RNTCP and covering the whole country under RNTCP by the year 2005, and to reach the global targets for TB control on case detection and treatment success. The structural arrangements for funds transfer and to account for the resources deployed were developed and thus the formation of the State and District TB Control Societies was under- taken. The systems were further strengthened and the programme was scaled up for national coverage in 2005.

This was followed up with RNTCP Phase II, developed based on the lessons learnt from the implementation of the programme over a 12-year period. The design of the RNTCP II remained almost the same as that of RNTCP I but additional requirements of quality assured diagnosis and treatment were built in through schemes to increase the participation of private sector providers and also inclusion of DOTS+ for MDR TB and also offering treatment for XDR TB. Systematic research and evidence building to inform the programme for better de- sign was also included as an important component. The Advocacy, Communication and Social Mobilization were also addressed in the design. The challenges imposed by the structures under NRHM were also taken into account.
India achieved country wide coverage under RNTCP in March 2006.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

The RNTCP was built on the infrastructure and systems built through the NTP. Major additions to the RNTCP, over and above the structures established under the NTP, was the establishment of a sub-district supervisory unit, known as a TB Unit, with dedicated RNTCP supervisors posted, and decentralization of both diagnostic and treatment services, with treatment given under the support of DOT (directly observed treatment) providers.

NIKSHAY, the web based reporting for TB programme has been another notable achievement initiated in 2012 and has enabled capture and transfer of individual patient data from the remotest health institutions of the country.

==Program working==
{{unsourced section|date=March 2018}}
The program initially adopted the [[Directly observed treatment, short-course]] strategy which consisted of the five components of strong political will and administrative commitment, diagnosis by quality assured sputum smear microscopy, uninterrupted supply of quality assured Short Course chemotherapy drugs, Directly Observed Treatment (DOT) and systematic monitoring and Accountability. The DOTS strategy achieved and sustained the target detection rate of 70% of all estimated cases and a cure rate of 85% in new cases and led to the decrease in incidence of TB in the country.

With progress in achieving objectives outlined in the DOTS Strategy of the 11th Five year Plan, the program defined the new targets of Universal Access to TB care. Under the 12th Five Year Plan of Government of India as the National Strategic Plan for 2012–17. The plan hopes to achieve detection of at-least 90% the total estimated cases and a cure rate of 90% in new and 85% in re-treatment cases.&lt;ref name=NSP2012-13 /&gt; Following are the key components:

Case finding and diagnostics:
*  Early identification of all infectious TB cases. Improved integration with the general health system, and leverage field staff for home-based case finding.
*  Improve communication and outreach
*  Screening clinically and socially vulnerable risk groups for TB.
*  Develop improved sputum collection and transportation systems.
*  Deployment of higher-sensitivity diagnostic tests for TB suspects (and incorporate new tests) and decentralized DST services
*  Catch patients already diagnosed through notification from all sources, improved referral for treatment mechanisms, and deployment of laboratory and private provider notification
 
Patient friendly treatment services:
* Promptly and appropriately treating TB, increasingly guided by DST.
* Making DOTS more patient friendly through increased communitization of DOT; pilot incentives/offsets for patient costs to help patients complete treatment and better monitoring through information technology. 
* Improving partnerships between public and private sector—establish 'Indian Standards for TB Care' which can be used to engage providers using existing private treatment and improve care with some public sector support and supervision. 
* Research will guide improvements in regimens and delivery systems.
* National Treatment Committee/TWG for regular review of regimens, all treatment related technical guidance

Scale-up of Programmatic Management of Drug Resistant TB:
* Developing network of C&amp;DST laboratories and strengthening of reference laboratories 
* Decentralized DST at district level for early MDR detection 
* Improved information system for PMDT 
* Manpower support for additional workload by aligning with NRHM health blocks and rationalization of number of patients per STS 
* Improved drug management of second-line anti-TB drugs

Scale-up of joint TB-HIV collaborative activities:
* Activities will aim at early, rapid TB diagnosis with high sensitivity tests for HIV-infected TB suspects and ART for all HIV-infected TB patients, with transport support.

Integration with health systems:
* Integrating the RNTCP with the overall health system will increase effectiveness and efficiencies of TB care and control which has been depicted in the picture.
* In rural areas the RNTCP can focus integration through the National Rural Health Mission.
* In urban areas the RNTCP can integrate through the private sector and the evolving National Urban Health Mission.

Control TB: compared to today's activities, success will:
* Accelerate decline in incidence and prevent 22 lakh TB cases
* Reduce TB deaths by 75%, and save 17 lakh lives from TB
* Contain MDR TB: avert 1 lakh MDR cases and reduce incidence by 50%
* Quicker diagnosis of more TB patients, more effective treatment in future direct economic expenditure on TB cases prevented and
* Leadership for India: Sustain India's global leadership in TB treatment and control.

== Diagnosis of pulmonary TB under RNTCP ==

Diagnosis is made primarily based on sputum smear examination. X-rays play a secondary role in the standard diagnostic [[algorithm]] for [[pulmonary tuberculosis]]

Sputum smear microscopy, using the [[Ziehl-Neelsen stain]]ing technique, is employed as the standard case-finding tool. Two sputum samples are collected over two days (as spot-morning/morning-spot) from chest symptomatics (patients with presenting with a history of cough for two weeks or more) to arrive at a diagnosis. In addition to the test's high [[sensitivity and specificity#Specificity|specificity]], the use of two samples ensures that the diagnostic procedure has a high (&gt;99%) test [[sensitivity and specificity#Sensitivity|sensitivity]] as well.

As a national health program, RNTCP pays more attention to the sputum-positive [[pulmonary tuberculosis]] patients (who are likely to spread the disease in the community) than people with other, non-pulmonary forms of the disease.

== Treatment categories and drug regimens ==

Based on results from a recent study, RNTCP has issued guidelines to states on daily treatment for tuberculosis. The daily regimen will replace the existing alternate day (thrice weekly) regimen from January - February 2016 in selected states. The daily regimen has shown to be effective in reducing relapse rates and drug-resistance.

Standardized treatment regimens are one of the pillars of the DOTS strategy. [[Isoniazid]], [[Rifampicin]], [[Pyrazinamide]], [[Ethambutol]], and [[Streptomycin]] are the primary antitubercular drugs used. Most DOTS regimens have thrice-weekly schedules and typically last for six to nine months, with an initial intensive phase and a continuation phase.

Based on the nature/severity of the disease and the patient's exposure to previous anti-tubercular treatments, RNTCP classifies tuberculosis patients into two treatment categories.

== Public private partnership under RNTCP ==

In India a sizable proportion of the people with symptoms suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis approach the private sector for their immediate health care needs. There is need for regularizing the varied anti-tubercular treatment regimens used by [[general practitioners]] and other private sector players. The treatment carried out by the private practitioners vary from that of the RNTCP treatment. Once treatment is started in the usual way for the private sector, it is difficult for the patient to change to the RNTCP panel. Studies have shown that faulty anti-TB prescriptions in the private sector in India ranges from 50% to 100% and this is a matter of concern for the healthcare services in TB currently being provided by the largely unregulated private sector in India.

== Second phase of RNTCP ==

In the first phase of RNTCP (1998–2005), the programme’s focus was on ensuring expansion of quality DOTS services to the entire country. The future holds a different set of challenges including [[MDR TB]] and HIV/TB

The RNTCP has now entered its second phase, approved for a period of five years from October 2006 to September 2011, in which the programme aims to firstly consolidate the gains made to date, to widen services both in terms of activities and access, and to sustain the achievements. The second phase aims to maintain at least a 70% case detection rate of new smear positive cases as well as maintain a cure rate of at least 85%. This needs to be done in order to achieve the TB-related targets set by the [[Millennium Development Goals]] for 2015 and to achieve TB control in the longer term. Today India's TB control program needs to update itself with the international TB guidelines as well as provide an optimal anti TB treatment to the patients enrolled under it or it will land up being another factor in the genesis of drug resistant tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;Gyanshankar Mishra, S V Ghorpade, Jasmin Mulani (2014)  XDR-TB: An outcome of programmatic management of TB in India.

'''Social stress''' is [[stress (biological)|stress]] that stems from one's relationships with others and from the social environment in general.&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Rethinking the health consequences of social class and social mobility. Social Science &amp; Medicine. Vol. 200, pp. 258-261. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.037&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the [[Appraisal theory|appraisal]] theory of emotion, stress arises when a person evaluates a situation as personally relevant and perceives that s/he does not have the resources to cope or handle the specific situation.&lt;ref&gt;
Smith, C. A., &amp; Lazarus, R. S. (1990) Emotion and adaptation. In L. A. Pervin (Ed.), ''Handbook of Personality: Theory and Research'' (pp. 609-637). New York:Guilford.
&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=December 2015}} An event which exceeds the ability to cope does not necessarily have to occur in order for one to experience stress, as the threat of such an event occurring can be sufficient.&lt;ref name="doi.org"/&gt;

There are three main categories of social stressors.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, S., 2017. Social stress.

Humans are social beings by [[human nature|nature]], as they typically have a fundamental need and desire to maintain positive social relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Slavich | first=George M |author2=O'Donovan, Aoife |author3=Epel, Elissa S |author4= Kemeny, Margaret E  | title=Black sheep get the blues: a psychobiological model of social rejection and depression | journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | date=September 2010 | volume=35 | issue=1 | pages=39–45 | doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2010.01.003 | pmid=20083138 | pmc=2926175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, they usually find maintaining positive social ties to be beneficial.

This can include low [[social status]] in society or in particular groups, giving a speech, interviewing with potential employers, caring for a child or spouse with a chronic illness, meeting new people at a party, the threat of or actual death of a loved one, divorce, and [[discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;Kessler, R.

Stress-related transactions between person and environment. In ''Perspectives in interactional psychology'' (pp. 287-327). Springer US.&lt;/ref&gt; Social stress can arise from one's micro-environment (e.g., family ties) and macro-environment (e.g., hierarchical [[social structure|societal structure]]). Social stress is typically the most frequent type of stressor that people experience in their daily lives and affects people more intensely than other types of stressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Almeida, D.M. | year=2005 | title=Resilience and vulnerability to daily stressors assessed via diary methods | journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume=14 | issue=2 | pages=64–68 | url=http://www.midus.wisc.edu/findings/pdfs/116.pdf | doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2005.00336.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
Researchers define social stress and social stressors in various ways.  Wadman, Durkin, and Conti-Ramsden (2011) defined social stress as "the feelings of discomfort or anxiety that individuals may experience in social situations, and the associated tendency to avoid potentially stressful social situations".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social stress in young people with specific language impairment|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140197110001016|journal = Journal of Adolescence|date = 2011-06-01|pages = 421–431|volume = 34|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.adolescence.2010.06.010|first = Ruth|last = Wadman|first2 = Kevin|last2 = Durkin|first3 = Gina|last3 = Conti-Ramsden}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ilfield (1977) defined social stressors as "circumstances of daily social roles that are generally considered problematic or undesirable".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Current social stressors and symptoms of depression|journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry|date = 1977-02-01|issn = 0002-953X|pmid = 835737|pages = 161–166|volume = 134|issue = 2|doi = 10.1176/ajp.134.2.161|first = F. W.|last = Ilfeld}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dormann and Zapf (2004) defined social stressors as "a class of characteristics, situations, episodes, or behaviors that are related to psychological or physical strain and that are somehow social in nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Customer-Related Social Stressors and Burnout|last = Dormann|first = Christian|date = January 2004|journal = Journal of Occupational Health Psychology|doi = |pmid = |last2 = Zapf|first2 = Dieter|issue = 9.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement ==
Social stress is typically measured through self-report questionnaires.  In the laboratory, researchers can induce social stress through various methods and protocols.

=== Self-reports ===
There are several questionnaires used to assess environmental and psychosocial stress.  Such self-report measures include the Test of Negative Social Exchange,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ruehlman | first=Linda S. |author2=Karoly, Paul  | title=With a little flak from my friends: Development and preliminary validation of the Test of Negative Social Exchange (TENSE) | journal=Psychological Assessment | year=1991  | volume=3 | issue=1 | pages=97–104 | doi=10.1037/1040-3590.3.1.97}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Marital Adjustment Test,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Locke | first=Harvey J. |author2=Wallace, Karl M.  | title=Short Marital-Adjustment and Prediction Tests: Their Reliability and Validity | journal=Marriage and Family Living| date=August 1959 | volume=21 | issue=3 | page=251 | doi=10.2307/348022 | jstor=348022}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Risky Families Questionnaire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Taylor | first=Shelley E |author2=Lerner, Jennifer S |author3=Sage, Rebecca M |author4=Lehman, Barbara J |author5= Seeman, Teresa E  | title=Early environment, emotions, responses to stress, and health | journal=Journal of Personality | date=December 2004 | volume=72 | issue=6 | pages=1365–1393 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2004.00300.x | pmid=15509286 | url=http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/lernerlab/files/taylor_lerner_sage_lehman_seeman_2004.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Holmes–Rahe Stress Inventory,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The social readjustment rating scale|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0022399967900104|journal = Journal of Psychosomatic Research|pages = 213–218|volume = 11|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/0022-3999(67)90010-4|first = Thomas H.|last = Holmes|first2 = Richard H.|last2 = Rahe|pmid=6059863|date=August 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Trier Inventory for the Assessment of Chronic Stress,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Trierer Inventar zur Erfassung von chronischem Streß (TICS): Skalenkonstruktion, teststatistische Überprüfung und Validierung der Skala Arbeitsüberlastung|url = http://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/abs/10.1026//0012-1924.45.1.8|journal = Diagnostica|date = 1999-01-01|issn = 0012-1924|pages = 8–19|volume = 45|issue = 1|doi = 10.1026//0012-1924.45.1.8|first = Peter|last = Schulz|first2 = Wolff|last2 = Schlotz}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Daily Stress Inventory,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A daily stress inventory: Development, reliability, and validity|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00845128|journal = Journal of Behavioral Medicine|date = 1987-02-01|issn = 0160-7715|pages = 61–73|volume = 10|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/BF00845128|first = Phillip J.|last = Brantley|first2 = Craig D.|last2 = Waggoner|first3 = Glenn N.|last3 = Jones|first4 = Neil B.|last4 = Rappaport}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Job Content Questionnaire,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ): An instrument for internationally comparative assessments of psychosocial job characteristics.|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/1076-8998.3.4.322|journal = Journal of Occupational Health Psychology|pages = 322–355|volume = 3|issue = 4|doi = 10.1037/1076-8998.3.4.322|first = Robert|last = Karasek|first2 = Chantal|last2 = Brisson|first3 = Norito|last3 = Kawakami|first4 = Irene|last4 = Houtman|first5 = Paulien|last5 = Bongers|first6 = Benjamin|last6 = Amick}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Perceived Stress Scale,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Global Measure of Perceived Stress|journal = Journal of Health and Social Behavior|date = 1983-12-01|pages = 385–396|volume = 24|issue = 4|doi = 10.2307/2136404|first = Sheldon|last = Cohen|first2 = Tom|last2 = Kamarck|first3 = Robin|last3 = Mermelstein|jstor=2136404|pmid=6668417}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Stress and Adversity Inventory.&lt;ref&gt;Slavich, G.

In addition to self-report questionnaires, researchers can employ structured interview assessments. The Life Events and Difficulties Schedule (LEDS) is one of the most popular instruments used in research.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Measuring Stress: A Guide for Health and Social Scientists|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6NDhBwAAQBAJ|publisher = Oxford University Press|date = 1997-11-17|isbn = 9780190283889|first = Sheldon|last = Cohen|first2 = Ronald C.|last2 = Kessler|first3 = Lynn Underwood|last3 = Gordon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Social origins of depression: A study of psychiatric disorder in women|last = Brown|first = George William|publisher = Tavistock|year = 1978|isbn = 0-422-76310-1|location = London|pages = |last2 = Harris|first2 = Tirril}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this type of measure is to probe the participant to elaborate on his/her stressful life events, rather than answering singular questions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The UCLA Life Stress Interview (LSI), which is similar to the LEDS, includes questions about romantic partners, closest friendships, other friendships, and family relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hammen Lab at UCLA|url = http://hammenlab.psych.ucla.edu/interview.html|website = hammenlab.psych.ucla.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Induction ===
In [[mouse model|rodent models]], [[social disruption]] and [[social defeat]] are two common social stress paradigms. In the social disruption paradigm, an aggressive rodent is introduced into a cage housing male rodents that have already naturally established a social hierarchy. The aggressive "intruder" disrupts the social hierarchy, causing the residents social stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social stress induces glucocorticoid resistance in macrophages|url = http://ajpregu.physiology.org/content/280/6/R1799|journal = American Journal of Physiology.

In human research, the [[Trier social stress test|Trier Social Stress Task]] (TSST) is widely used to induce social stress in the laboratory. In the TSST, participants are told that they have to prepare and give a speech about why they would be a great candidate for their ideal job.  The experimenter films the participant while s/he gives the speech and informs the participant that a panel of judges will evaluate that speech.  After the public speaking component, the experimenter administers a mathematics task that involves counting backwards by certain increments.  If the participant makes a mistake, the experimenter prompts him/her to start again.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kirschbaum | first=C |author2=Pirke, K M |author3=Hellhammer, D H  | title=The 'Trier Social Stress Test'—a tool for investigating psychobiological stress responses in a laboratory setting | journal=Neuropsychobiology | year=1993 | volume=28 | issue=1–2 | pages=76–81 | pmid=8255414 | url=http://p113367.typo3server.info/uploads/media/lit9304.pdf | doi=10.1159/000119004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The threat of negative evaluation is the social stressor. Researchers can measure the stress response by comparing pre-stress salivary cortisol levels and post-stress salivary cortisol levels.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Other common stress measures used in the TSST are self-report measures like the [[State-Trait Anxiety Inventory]] and physiological measures like heart rate.&lt;ref&gt;Spielberger, C.

In a laboratory conflict discussion, couples identify several specific areas of conflict in their relationship.  The couples then pinpoint a couple topics to discuss later on in the experiment (ex. finances, child-rearing).  Couples are told to discuss the conflict(s) for 10 minutes while being videotaped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ditzen | first1 = B. | last2 = Schaer | first2 = M. | last3 = Gabriel | first3 = B. | last4 = Bodenmann | first4 = G. | last5 = Ehlert | first5 = U. | last6 = Heinrichs | first6 = M. | year = 2009 | title = Intranasal oxytocin increases positive communication and reduces cortisol levels during couple conflict | url = | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 65 | issue = 9| pages = 728–731 | doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2008.10.011 | pmid=19027101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brouwer and Hogervorst (2014) designed the Sing-a-Song Stress Test (SSST) to induce stress in the laboratory setting.  After viewing neutral images with subsequent 1-minute rest periods, the participant is instructed to sing a song after the next 1-minute rest period is complete.  Researchers found that skin conductance and heart rate are significantly higher during the post-song message interval than the previous 1-minute intervals.  The stress levels are comparable to that induced in the Trier Social Stress Task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A new paradigm to induce mental stress: the Sing-a-Song Stress Test (SSST) |journal = Frontiers in Neuroscience|date = 2014-07-29|issn = 1662-4548|pmc = 4114180|pmid = 25120425|volume = 8|doi = 10.3389/fnins.2014.00224|first = Anne-Marie|last = Brouwer|first2 = Maarten A.|last2 = Hogervorst}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistical indicators of stress in large groups===

A statistical indicator of stress, simultaneous increase of [[variance]] and [[correlations]], was proposed for diagnosis of stress and successfully used in physiology and finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorban|first1=A.N.|last2=Smirnova|first2=E.V.|last3=Tyukina|first3=T.

''"Introduction to econophysics: correlations and complexity in finance."' Cambridge university press; 1999 Nov 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Its applicability for early diagnosis of social stress in large groups was demonstrated by the analysis of crises. It was examined in the prolonged stress period preceding the 2014 [[Ukrainian crisis|Ukrainian economic and political crisis]]. There was a simultaneous increase in the total correlation between the 19 major public fears in the Ukrainian society (by about 64%) and also in their statistical dispersion (by 29%) during the pre-crisis years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rybnikov|first1=S.R.|last2=Rybnikova|first2=N.A.|last3=Portnov|first3=B.A.|title=Public fears in Ukrainian society: Are crises predictable?|journal=Psychology &amp; Developing Societies|date=March 2017|volume=29|issue=1|pages=98–123|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315918065_Public_fears_in_Ukrainian_society_Are_crises_predictable|doi=10.1177/0971333616689398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mental health ==

Research has consistently demonstrated that social stress increases risk for developing negative [[mental health]] outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, S., 2017. Social stress. New York: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; One [[prospective study]] asked over fifteen hundred Finnish employees whether they had "considerable difficulties with [their] coworkers/superiors/inferiors during the last 6 months, 5 years, earlier, or never".&lt;ref name=romanov&gt;{{cite journal | last=Romanov | first=K |author2=Appelberg, K |author3=Honkasalo, M L |author4= Koskenvuo, M  | title=Recent interpersonal conflict at work and psychiatric morbidity: a prospective study of 15,530 employees aged 24-64 | journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research | date=February 1996 | volume=40 | issue=2 | pages=169–176 | pmid=8778399 | doi=10.1016/0022-3999(95)00577-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information on suicides, hospitalizations due to [[psychosis]], suicidal behavior, alcohol intoxication, depressive symptoms, and medication for chronic psychiatric disorders was then gathered from the national registries of mortality and morbidity. Those who had experienced conflict in the workplace with coworkers or supervisors in the last five years were more likely to be diagnosed with a psychiatric condition.&lt;ref name=romanov /&gt;

Research on the [[LGBT|LGB]] population has suggested that people who identify as LGB suffer more from mental health disorders, such as [[substance abuse]] and [[mood disorder]]s, compared to those who identify as heterosexual.&lt;ref name="Meyer 674–697"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Prejudice, Social Stress, and Mental Health in Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Populations: Conceptual Issues and Research Evidence|journal = Psychological Bulletin|date = 2003-09-01|issn = 0033-2909|pmc = 2072932|pmid = 12956539|pages = 674–697|volume = 129|issue = 5|doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.129.5.674|first = Ilan H.|last = Meyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers deduce that the LGB people's higher risk of mental health issues derives from their stressful social environments.  [[Minority group]]s can face high levels of stigma, prejudice, and discrimination on a regular basis, therefore leading to the development of various mental health disorders.&lt;ref name="Meyer 674–697"/&gt;

=== Anxiety ===
The biological basis for [[anxiety disorder]]s is rooted in the consistent activation of the stress response.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Fear, which is the defining emotion of an anxiety disorder, occurs when someone perceives a situation (a stressor) as threatening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shin | first1 = L.

If a person has difficulty regulating this stress response, it may activate inappropriately. Stress can therefore arise when a real stressor is not present or when something isn't actually threatening.  This can lead to the development of an anxiety disorder ([[panic attack]]s, [[social anxiety]], [[OCD]], etc.).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Neuroscience|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=75NgwLzueikC|publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|date = 2007-01-01|isbn = 9780781760034|first = Mark F.|last = Bear|first2 = Barry W.|last2 = Connors|first3 = Michael A.|last3 = Paradiso}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social anxiety disorder]] is defined as the fear of being judged or evaluated by others, even if no such threat is actually present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Social Anxiety Disorder {{!}} Anxiety and Depression Association of America, ADAA|url = http://www.adaa.org/social-anxiety-disorder|website = www.adaa.org|accessdate = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Long-term effects ===
Social stress occurring early in life can have [[psychopathological]] effects that develop or persist in adulthood. One [[longitudinal study]] found that children were more likely to have a psychiatric disorder (e.g. anxiety, depressive, disruptive, personality, and substance use disorders) in late adolescence and early adulthood when their parents showed more maladaptive child-rearing behaviors (e.g., loud arguments between parents, verbal abuse, difficulty controlling anger toward the child, lack of parental support or availability, and harsh punishment). Child [[temperament]] and parental psychiatric disorders did not explain this association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Johnson | first=J G |author2=Cohen, P |author3=Kasen, S |author4=Smailes, E |author5= Brook, J S  | title=Association of maladaptive parental behavior with psychiatric disorder among parents and their offspring | journal=Archives of General Psychiatry | date=May 2001 | volume=58 | issue=5 | pages=453–460 | pmid=11343524 | doi=10.1001/archpsyc.58.5.453}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have documented the robust relationships between children’s social stress within the family environment and depression, [[aggression]], [[antisocial behavior]], [[anxiety]], [[suicide]], and hostile, oppositional, and delinquent behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Repetti | first=Rena L |author2=Taylor, Shelley E |author3=Seeman, Teresa E  | title=Risky families: family social environments and the mental and physical health of offspring | journal=Psychological Bulletin | date=March 2002 | volume=128 | issue=2 | pages=330–366 | pmid=11931522 | url=http://taylorlab.psych.ucla.edu/2002_%20Risky%20Families_Family%20Social%20Environments%20and%20the%20Mental%20and%20Physical%20Health%20of%20Offspring.pdf | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.128.2.230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relapse and recurrence ===
Social stress can also exacerbate current psychopathological conditions and compromise recovery. For instance, patients recovering from depression or [[bipolar disorder]] are two times more likely to relapse if there is familial tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miklowitz | first1 = D.

Social status, a macro-social stressor, is a robust predictor of death. In a study of over 1700 British civil servants, [[socioeconomic status]] (SES) was inversely related to mortality.

Similarly, social stressors in the micro-environment are also linked to increased mortality.

=== Morbidity ===
Social stress also makes people more sick.

In one laboratory study, researchers interviewed participants to determine whether they had been experiencing social conflicts with spouses, close family members and friends.

=== Long-term effects ===
Exposure to social stress in childhood can also have long-term effects, increasing risk for developing diseases later in life. In particular, adults who were maltreated (emotionally, physically, sexually abused or neglected) as children report more disease outcomes, such as [[stroke]], [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], [[diabetes]], and [[hypertension]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rich-Edwards | first=Janet W | author2=Spiegelman, Donna; Lividoti Hibert, Eileen N; Jun, Hee-Jin; Todd, Tamarra James; Kawachi, Ichiro; Wright, Rosalind J | title=Abuse in childhood and adolescence as a predictor of type 2 diabetes in adult women | journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine | date=December 2010 | volume=39 | issue=6 | pages=529–536 | doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2010.09.007 | pmid=21084073 | pmc=3003936}}&lt;/ref&gt; or greater severity of those outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wegman | first=Holly L |author2=Stetler, Cinnamon  | title=A meta-analytic review of the effects of childhood abuse on medical outcomes in adulthood | journal=Psychosomatic Medicine | date=October 2009 | volume=71 | issue=8 | pages=805–812 | doi=10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181bb2b46 | pmid=19779142 | url=http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/content/71/8/805.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Adverse Childhood Experiences (study)|Adverse Childhood Experiences study]] (ACE), which includes over seventeen thousand adults, also found that there was a 20% increase in likelihood for experiencing [[heart disease]] for each kind of chronic familial social stressor experienced in childhood, and this was not due to typical risk factors for heart disease such as demographics, smoking, exercise, [[adiposity]], diabetes, or hypertension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dong | first=Maxia |author2=Giles, Wayne H |author3=Felitti, Vincent J |author4=Dube, Shanta R |author5=Williams, Janice E |author6=Chapman, Daniel P |author7= Anda, Robert F  | title=Insights Into Causal Pathways for Ischemic Heart Disease: Adverse Childhood Experiences Study | journal=Circulation | date=28 September 2004 | volume=110 | issue=13 | pages=1761–1766 | doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000143074.54995.7F | pmid=15381652 | url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/110/13/1761.long}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recovery and other disease ===
Social stress has also been tied to worse health outcomes among patients who already have a disease. Patients with end-stage renal disease faced a 46% increased risk for mortality when there was more relationship negativity with their spouse even when controlling for severity of disease and treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kimmel | first=P L |author2=Peterson, R A |author3=Weihs, K L |author4=Shidler, N |author5=Simmens, S J |author6=Alleyne, S |author7=Cruz, I |author8=Yanovski, J A |author9=Veis, J H |author10= Phillips, T M  | title=Dyadic relationship conflict, gender, and mortality in urban hemodialysis patients | journal=Journal of the American Society of Nephrology | date=August 2000 | volume=11 | issue=8 | pages=1518–1525 | pmid=10906166 | url=http://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/11/8/1518.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, women who had experienced an acute [[coronary]] event were three times more likely to experience another coronary event if they experienced moderate to severe marital strain.

== Physiology ==

Social stress leads to a number of physiological changes that mediate its relationship to physical health.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In the short term, the physiological changes outlined below are adaptive, as they enable the stressed organism to cope better. Dysregulation of these systems or repeated activation of them over the long-term can be detrimental to health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=McEwen | first=B S |author2=Stellar, E  | title=Stress and the individual: Mechanisms leading to disease | journal=Archives of Internal Medicine | date=27 September 1993 | volume=153 | issue=18 | pages=2093–2101 | pmid=8379800 | url=http://yalerei.org/intmed/resources/docs/McEwen.pdf | doi=10.1001/archinte.153.18.2093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sympathetic nervous system ===
The [[sympathetic nervous system]] (SNS) becomes activated in response to stress. Sympathetic arousal stimulates the [[adrenal medulla|medulla]] of the [[adrenal glands|medulla]] to secrete [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]] into the blood stream, which facilitates the [[fight-or-flight response]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Blood pressure, heart rate, and sweating increase, [[vasoconstriction|veins constrict]] to allow the heart to beat with more force, arteries leading to muscles dilate, and blood flow to parts of the body not essential for the fight or flight response decreases. If stress persists in the long run, then blood pressure remains elevated, leading to hypertension and [[atherosclerosis]], both precursors to [[cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Sapolsky, R. M. (1994). Why zebras don't get ulcers: A guide to stress, stress related diseases, and coping. New York: W.H. Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of animal and human studies have confirmed that social stress increases risk for negative health outcomes by increasing SNS activity. Studies of rodents show that social stress causes hypertension and atherosclerosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sgoifo | first=A | author2=Koolhaas, J; De Boer, S; Musso, E; Stilli, D; Buwalda, B; Meerlo, P | title=Social stress, autonomic neural activation, and cardiac activity in rats | journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | date=November 1999 | volume=23 | issue=7 | pages=915–923 | pmid=10580306 | doi=10.1016/s0149-7634(99)00025-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of non-human primates also show that social stress clogs arteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Manuck | first=S B |author2=Marsland, A L |author3=Kaplan, J R |author4= Williams, J K  | title=The pathogenicity of behavior and its neuroendocrine mediation: an example from coronary artery disease | journal=Psychosomatic Medicine | date=June 1995 | volume=57 | issue=3 | pages=275–283 | pmid=7652128 | url=http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/content/57/3/275.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social stress, visceral obesity, and coronary artery atherosclerosis: product of a primate adaptation|journal = American Journal of Primatology|date = 2009-09-01|issn = 1098-2345|pmc = 3970187|pmid = 19452515|pages = 742–751|volume = 71|issue = 9|doi = 10.1002/ajp.20706|first = Carol A.|last = Shively|first2 = Thomas C.|last2 = Register|first3 = Thomas B.|last3 = Clarkson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although humans cannot be randomized to receive social stress due to ethical concerns, studies have nevertheless shown that negative social interactions characterized by conflict lead to increases in blood pressure and heart rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gerin | first=W |author2=Pieper, C |author3=Levy, R |author4= Pickering, T G  | title=Social support in social interaction: a moderator of cardiovascular reactivity | journal=Psychosomatic Medicine | date=June 1992 | volume=54 | issue=3 | pages=324–336 | pmid=1620808 | url=http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/content/54/3/324.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social stress stemming from perceived daily discrimination is also associated with elevated levels of blood pressure during the day and a lack of blood pressure dipping at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Tomfohr | first=Lianne |author2=Cooper, Denise C |author3=Mills, Paul J |author4=Nelesen, Richard A |author5= Dimsdale, Joel E  | title=Everyday discrimination and nocturnal blood pressure dipping in black and white americans | journal=Psychosomatic Medicine | date=April 2010 | volume=72 | issue=3 | pages=266–272 | doi=10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181d0d8b2 | pmid=20124424 | pmc=2894630}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Smart Richman | first=Laura |author2=Pek, Jolynn |author3=Pascoe, Elizabeth |author4= Bauer, Daniel J  | title=The effects of perceived discrimination on ambulatory blood pressure and affective responses to interpersonal stress modeled over 24 hours | journal=Health Psychology| date=July 2010 | volume=29 | issue=4 | pages=403–411 | doi=10.1037/a0019045 | pmid=20658828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hypothalamic-pituitary adrenocortical axis (HPA) ===
In response to stress, the [[hypothalamus]] releases [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] (CRH), stimulating the [[anterior pituitary]] to release [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH). ACTH then stimulates the [[adrenal cortex]] to secrete [[glucocorticoids]], including [[cortisol]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Social stress can lead to adverse health outcomes by chronically activating the HPA axis or disrupting the HPA system.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; There are a number of studies that link social stress and indications of a disrupted HPA axis; for instance, monkey infants neglected by their mothers show prolonged cortisol responses following a challenging event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dettling | first=A |author2=Pryce, C R |author3=Martin, R D |author4= Döbeli, M  | title=Physiological Responses to parental separation and a strange situation are related to parental care received in juvenile Goeldi's monkeys (''Callimico goeldii'') | journal=Developmental Psychobiology | date=July 1998 | volume=33 | issue=1 | pages=21–31 | pmid=9664169 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1098-2302(199807)33:1&lt;21::aid-dev3&gt;3.0.co;2-u}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Inflammation]] is an immune response that is critical to fighting infections and repairing injured tissue. Although acute inflammation is adaptive, chronic inflammatory activity can contribute to adverse health outcomes, such as hypertension,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Niskanen | first=Leo |author2=Laaksonen, David E |author3=Nyyssönen, Kristiina |author4=Punnonen, Kari |author5=Valkonen, Veli-Pekka |author6=Fuentes, Ricardo |author7=Tuomainen, Tomi-Pekka |author8=Salonen, Riitta |author9= Salonen, Jukka T   | title=Inflammation, abdominal obesity, and smoking as predictors of hypertension | journal=Hypertension | date=December 2004 | volume=44 | issue=6 | pages=859–865 | doi=10.1161/01.HYP.0000146691.51307.84 | pmid=15492131 | url=http://hyper.ahajournals.org/content/44/6/859.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; atherosclerosis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Amar | first=Jacques |author2=Fauvel, Josette |author3=Drouet, Ludovic |author4=Ruidavets, Jean Bernard |author5=Perret, Bertrand |author6=Chamontin, Bernard |author7=Boccalon, Henri |author8= Ferrieres, Jean  | title=Interleukin 6 is associated with subclinical atherosclerosis: a link with soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 | journal=Journal of Hypertension | date=June 2006 | volume=24 | issue=6 | pages=1083–1088 | doi=10.1097/01.hjh.0000226198.44181.0c | pmid=16685208}}&lt;/ref&gt; coronary heart disease,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Cesari | first=Matteo | author2=Penninx, Brenda W J H; Newman, Anne B; Kritchevsky, Stephen B; Nicklas, Barbara J; Sutton-Tyrrell, Kim; Rubin, Susan M; Ding, Jingzhong; Simonsick, Eleanor M; Harris, Tamara B; Pahor, Marco | title=Inflammatory markers and onset of cardiovascular events: results from the Health ABC study | journal=Circulation | date=11 November 2003 | volume=108 | issue=19 | pages=2317–2322 | doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000097109.90783.FC | pmid=14568895 | url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/108/19/2317.long}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ridker | first=P M |author2=Rifai, N |author3=Stampfer, M J |author4= Hennekens, C H  | title=Plasma concentration of interleukin-6 and the risk of future myocardial infarction among apparently healthy men | journal=Circulation | date=18 April 2000 | volume=101 | issue=15 | pages=1767–1772 | pmid=10769275 | url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/101/15/1767.long | doi=10.1161/01.cir.101.15.1767}}&lt;/ref&gt; depression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Raison | first=Charles L |author2=Capuron, Lucile |author3=Miller, Andrew H  | title=Cytokines sing the blues: inflammation and the pathogenesis of depression | journal=Trends in Immunology | date=January 2006 | volume=27 | issue=1 | pages=24–31 | doi=10.1016/j.it.2005.11.006 | pmid=16316783 | pmc=3392963}}&lt;/ref&gt; diabetes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wellen | first=Kathryn E |author2=Hotamisligil, Gökhan S  | title=Inflammation, stress, and diabetes | journal=The Journal of Clinical Investigation | date=May 2005 | volume=115 | issue=5 | pages=1111–1119 | doi=10.1172/JCI25102 | pmid=15864338 | pmc=1087185}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Coussens | first=Lisa M |author2=Werb, Zena  | title=Inflammation and cancer | journal=Nature | date=19 December 2002 | volume=420 | issue=6917 | pages=860–867 | doi=10.1038/nature01322 | pmid=12490959 | pmc=2803035| bibcode=2002Natur.420..860C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rakoff-Nahoum | first=Seth | title=Why Cancer and Inflammation? | journal=The Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine | date=December 2006 | volume=79 | issue=3–4 | pages=123–130 | pmid=17940622 | pmc=1994795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has elucidated a relationship between different social stressors and [[cytokines]] (the markers of inflammation). Chronic social stressors, such as caring for a spouse with dementia, lead to greater circulating levels of [[Interleukin 6|cytokine interleukin-6]] (IL-6),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kiecolt-Glaser | first=Janice K |author2=Preacher, Kristopher J |author3=MacCallum, Robert C |author4=Atkinson, Cathie |author5=Malarkey, William B |author6= Glaser, Ronald  | title=Chronic stress and age-related increases in the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | date=22 July 2003 | volume=100 | issue=15 | pages=9090–9095 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1531903100 | pmid=12840146 | pmc=166443|bibcode=2003PNAS..100.9090K }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas acute social stress tasks in the laboratory have been shown to elicit increases in [[proinflammatory cytokines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Steptoe | first=Andrew |author2=Hamer, Mark |author3=Chida, Yoichi  | title=The effects of acute psychological stress on circulating inflammatory factors in humans: a review and meta-analysis | journal=Brain, Behavior, and Immunity | date=October 2007 | volume=21 | issue=7 | pages=901–912 | doi=10.1016/j.bbi.2007.03.011 | pmid=17475444}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, when faced with another type of social stress, namely social evaluative threat, participants showed increases in IL-6 and a soluble receptor for [[tumor necrosis factor-α]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Slavich | first=George M. |author2=Way, Baldwin M. |author3=Eisenberger, Naomi I. |author4= Taylor, Shelley E.  | title=Neural sensitivity to social rejection is associated with inflammatory responses to social stress | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | date=17 August 2010 | volume=107 | issue=33 | pages=14817–14822 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1009164107 | pmid=20679216 | pmc=2930449| bibcode=2010PNAS..10714817S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dickerson | first=Sally S |author2=Gable, Shelly L |author3=Irwin, Michael R |author4=Aziz, Najib |author5= Kemeny, Margaret E  | title=Social-evaluative threat and proinflammatory cytokine regulation: an experimental laboratory investigation | journal=Psychological Science | date=October 2009 | volume=20 | issue=10 | pages=1237–1244 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02437.x | pmid=19754527 | pmc=2761517}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Miller | first=Gregory E |author2=Rohleder, Nicolas |author3=Stetler, Cinnamon |author4= Kirschbaum, Clemens  | title=Clinical depression and regulation of the inflammatory response during acute stress | journal=Psychosomatic Medicine | date=October 2005 | volume=67 | issue=5 | pages=679–687 | doi=10.1097/01.psy.0000174172.82428.ce | pmid=16204423 | url=http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/content/67/5/679.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increases in inflammation may persist over time, as studies have shown that chronic relationship stress has been tied to greater IL-6 production 6 months later&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Miller | first=Gregory E |author2=Rohleder, Nicolas |author3=Cole, Steve W  | title=Chronic interpersonal stress predicts activation of pro- and anti-inflammatory signaling pathways 6 months later | journal=Psychosomatic Medicine | date=January 2009 | volume=71 | issue=1 | pages=57–62 | doi=10.1097/PSY.0b013e318190d7de | pmid=19073750 | pmc=2720615}}&lt;/ref&gt; and children reared in a stressful family environment marked by neglect and conflict tend to show elevated levels of [[C-reactive protein]], a marker of IL-6, in adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Taylor | first=Shelley E |author2=Lehman, Barbara J |author3=Kiefe, Catarina I |author4= Seeman, Teresa E  | title=Relationship of early life stress and psychological functioning to adult C-reactive protein in the coronary artery risk development in young adults study | journal=Biological Psychiatry | date=15 October 2006 | volume=60 | issue=8 | pages=819–824 | doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2006.03.016 | pmid=16712805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interactions of physiological systems ===
There is extensive evidence that the above physiological systems affect one another's functioning. For instance, cortisol tends to have a suppressive effect on inflammatory processes, and proinflammatory cytokines can also activate the HPA system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wilder | first=R L | title=Neuroendocrine-immune system interactions and autoimmunity | journal=Annual Review of Immunology | year=1995 | volume=13 | pages=307–338 | doi=10.1146/annurev.iy.13.040195.001515 | pmid=7612226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sympathetic activity can also [[upregulate]] inflammatory activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Jan | first=Badar U |author2=Coyle, Susette M |author3=Macor, Marie A |author4=Reddell, Michael |author5=Calvano, Steve E |author6= Lowry, Stephen F  | title=Relationship of basal heart rate variability to in vivo cytokine responses after endotoxin exposure | journal=Shock | date=April 2010 | volume=33 | issue=4 | pages=363–368 | doi=10.1097/SHK.0b013e3181b66bf4 | pmid=20407404 | pmc=2980578}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Marsland | first=Anna L |author2=Gianaros, Peter J |author3=Prather, Aric A |author4=Jennings, J Richard |author5=Neumann, Serina A |author6= Manuck, Stephen B  | title=Stimulated production of proinflammatory cytokines covaries inversely with heart rate variability | journal=Psychosomatic Medicine | date=November 2007 | volume=69 | issue=8 | pages=709–716 | doi=10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181576118 | pmid=17942840}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the relationships among these physiological systems, social stress may also influence health indirectly via affecting a particular physiological system that in turn affects a different physiological system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14419">'''The Pacific Identity and Wellbeing Scale (PIWBS)''' is a [[self-report inventory]] with a [[Likert scale]] format, designed to assess five distinct dimensions of [[Personal identity|identity]] and [[subjective well-being]] among Pacific populations in [[New Zealand]]:
# Group Membership Evaluation
# Pacific Connectedness and Belonging
# Religious Centrality and Embeddedness
# Perceived Familial Wellbeing
# Perceived Societal Wellbeing

The PIWBS was developed by Sam Manuela, a doctoral candidate at [[The University of Auckland]].&lt;ref&gt;Manuela, S. (2010). The Pacific Identity and Wellbeing Scale. Published master’s thesis. The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manuela, S. &amp; Sibley, C. G. (2012). The Pacific Identity and Wellbeing Scale (PIWBS): A Culturally-Appropriate Self Report Measure for Pacific Peoples in New Zealand. Social Indicators Research, 1, 83-103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manuela, S. &amp; Sibley, C. G (2012). Why Do Pacific People with Multiple Ethnic Affiliations Have Poorer Subjective Wellbeing? Negative Ingroup Affect Mediates the Identity Tension Effect. Social Indicators Research, 1, 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt; The scale aims to provide a culturally sensitive, valid and reliable [[self-report inventory]] of Pacific identity and [[subjective well-being]] which aids the understanding and predicting of Pacific outcomes. The measure contributes to Pacific studies by providing a [[quantitative research|quantitative]], within-cultural research tool for Pacific peoples from a Pacific perspective. The PIWBS is associated with the [[New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study]].

The dimensions, Group Membership Evaluation, Pacific Connectedness and Belonging, and Religious Centrality and Embeddness all relate to identity. Answers to questions relating to identity are rated on a [[Likert scale]] ranging from 1 to 7 (1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree). The dimensions, Perceived Familial Wellbeing and Perceived Societal Wellbeing both relate to wellbeing. Answers to questions relating to [[wellbeing]] are rated on a [[Likert scale]] ranging from 1 to 7 (1 = completely dissatisfied and 7 = completely satisfied).

==The Five Dimensions==

===1. Group Membership Evaluation (GME)===

This factor reflects subjective evaluations of membership within the Pacific group. Positive group evaluations are shown through pride in one's [[ethnic identity]] and [[culture]],&lt;ref&gt;Mila-Schaaf, K., Robinson, E., Schaaf, D., Denny, S., &amp; Watson, P. D. (2008). A health profile of Pacific youth: Findings of youth 2000. A National Secondary School Youth Health Survey. Auckland: University of Auckland.&lt;/ref&gt; and represent a secure ethnic identity.&lt;ref&gt;Anae, M. (1998). Fofoa-i-vao-’ese: The identity journeys of NZ-born Samoans. Unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt; This factor includes an evaluation of positive effect brought about by Pacific group membership, and an evaluation of the extent to which one's Pacific identity is seen as a central and defining aspect of [[self-concept]]. High scores on this factor would indicate that positive/worthwhile feelings are derived from Pacific identification, and that affiliation with a Pacific group is seen as a desirable aspect of self-concept and is central to identity.

====Sample Group Membership Evaluation Items====

* The fact that I am an Islander is an important part of my identity
* Being an Islander is an important part of how I see myself
* I am glad to be a Pacific Islander
* I am proud to be a Pacific Islander
* Being a Pacific Islander gives me a good feeling

====2. Pacific Connectedness and Belonging (PCB)====
This factor is a measure of an individual's sense of [[belongingness|belonging]] and connectedness with Pacific others and groups. These feelings derive from shared experiences and commonalities and are particularly apparent among youth,.&lt;ref&gt;Macpherson, C. (1996). Pacific Islands identity and community. In P. Spoonley, D. Pearson, &amp; C. Macpherson (Eds.), Nga Patai: Racism and ethnic relations in Aotearoa/New Zealand (pp. 124–143). Palmerston North, NZ: Dunmore Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anae, M. (1998). Fofoa-i-vao-’ese: The identity journeys of NZ-born Samoans. Unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tiatia, J. (1998). Caught between cultures: A New Zealand-born Pacific Island perspective. Auckland: Christian Research Association.&lt;/ref&gt; This factor, which assesses the extent to which the individual believes the self to be an integral part of a Pacific group, is made up of two distinct dimensions. The first dimension concerns perceived connections/relationships with others, and the second dimension concerns an individual's subjective sense of belonging at a broader level. High scores on this factor would indicate that the individual feels similar to Pacific others, and perceives themselves to be an integral member of the wider, general group, and have a feeling of belonging.

=====Sample Pacific Connectedness and Belonging Items=====
* I feel at home around other Islanders, even if they are not from my Island
* I feel comfortable in places with lots of other Pacific peoples
* I don’t get along with other island groups (reverse coded)
* I feel connected to other Pacific peoples in general
* I feel connected to people from a different Pacific Island to myself
* I feel most comfortable in Pacific communities

====3. Religious Centrality and Embeddedness (RCE)====
This factor assesses the individual's evaluation of the extent to which [[religion]] is central to their identity as Pacific, and the extent to which they believe religion to be entwined with Pacific [[culture]]. [[Religion]] is an important aspect of Pacific identity, having a huge influence on many Pacific communities by providing social connections and support, and fulfilling cultural and religious needs.&lt;ref&gt;Anae, M. (2001). The New Vikings of the sunrise: New Zealand-born in the information age. In P. Spoonley, C. Macpherson, &amp; M. Anae (Eds.), Tagata o te Moana Nui: The evolving identities of Pacific peoples in Aotearoa, New Zealand (pp. 89–101). Palmerston North, NZ: Dunmore Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tiatia, J. (1998). Caught between cultures: A New Zealand-born Pacific Island perspective. Ellerslie, Auckland: Christian Research Association.&lt;/ref&gt; This factor focuses on [[Christianity]]-based religions which are the most common in Pacific societies. High scores on this factor would indicate that the individual feels that [[Christianity]]-based religion is a central aspect of self-identity, and is strongly linked to their Pacific [[culture]].

=====Sample Religious Centrality and Embeddedness Items=====
* Going to Church is part of my culture and religion
* God has a strong connection to my culture
* Religion is not important for my culture (reverse coded)
* Part of being a Pacific Islander is having a connection with God
* Religion is the root of our Pasifika culture
* Our religion is the centre of our culture as Pacific Islanders

====4. Perceived Familial Wellbeing (PFW)====
This factor assesses the individual's subjective satisfaction with their family, and the [[subjective well-being]] of and within their family. Family offers [[Human body|physical]], mental, [[cultural]], [[spirituality|spiritual]] and [[social]] nurturance, and is an integral aspect of Pacific [[self-concept]], closely tied to wellbeing.&lt;ref&gt;Tamasese, K., Peteru, C., &amp; Waldegrave, C. (1997). O le Taeo Afua—The new morning: A qualitative investigation into Samoan perspectives on mental health and culturally appropriate services. Wellington: The Family Centre &amp; NZ Health Research Council.&lt;/ref&gt; This factor assesses a variety of Pacific family values including [[respect]], [[communication]], [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] and [[happiness]]. High scores in this factor would indicate that the individual feels a strong sense of [[social support|support]] from their family, and that the individual perceives their family as a whole to have a high level of wellbeing.

=====Sample Perceived Familial Wellbeing Items=====
* Your relationship with your parents
* Your family's security
* The respect you give for your parents
* The respect you receive from your family
* Your position in your family
* Your family's happiness
* Communication with your family

====5. Perceived Societal Wellbeing (PSW)====
This factor reflects the individual's [[Contentment|satisfaction]] with [[society]] and the [[social support|support]] it offers. Satisfaction with society has a strong influence on the subjective wellbeing of Pacific people.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Health. (1995). Pacific Islands peoples’ understanding of mental health. Strategic directions for the mental health services for Pacific Islands people. Wellington: Ministry of Health.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kupa, K. (2009). Te Vaka Atafaga: a Tokelau assessment model for supporting holistic mental health practice with Tokelau people in Aotearoa, New Zealand. Pacific Health Dialog, 15, 156–163.&lt;/ref&gt; Perceived support from society is assessed on various levels, from the local community level to the national government level and responses indicate how supported and integrated the Pacific individual feels in New Zealand. High scores on this factor would indicate that the individual feels satisfied, supported and accepted by all levels of New Zealand society.

=====Sample Perceived Societal Wellbeing Items=====
* Support provided to you by the New Zealand government to you as a Pacific Islander
* Your position in New Zealand as a Pacific person
* Your personal needs being met by New Zealand
* The support you receive as a Pacific Islander in the community you live in
* Your relationship with New Zealand society
* The support you receive in the community you live in
* The support you receive as a Pacific Islander in New Zealand

==Validation of the PIWBS==

The Pacific Identity and Wellbeing Scale was developed and validated using [[exploratory factor analysis]] (EFA) and [[confirmatory factor analysis]] (CFA).  The initial pool of 125 questions was developed based on previous Pacific research, a variety of other wellbeing and identity scales, discussions with Pacific peoples and the [[Multi-dimensional Model of Maori Identity and Cultural Engagement]].&lt;ref&gt;Houkamau, C. A., &amp; Sibley, C. G. (2010). The multi-dimensional model of Maori identity and cultural engagement. New Zealand Journal of Psychology, 39, 8–25.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Exploratory factor analysis]] (EFA) was conducted to organise the 125 possible questions into groups (factors) based on similarity of topic. Individual items that did not fit a group well or that related to more than one group were not used. Thirty-one questions were retained which were found to measure the five distinct, yet interconnected factors of Pacific identity and wellbeing. [[Confirmatory factor analysis]] (CFA) was later used to confirm the structure of the PIWBS. All 31 items were found to be strongly related to the predicted factors. 
[[Cronbach's alpha]] (internal reliability) measures the extent to which all the questions in a section measure the same construct/factor consistently. The five factors of the PIWBS showed excellent internal reliability, with [[Cronbach's alpha]]s all above α = 0.85. The minimum accepted standard of internal reliability is α = 0.70. 

The PIWBS has been used in several studies to investigate the low levels of [[subjective well-being]] found among Pacific peoples who identify with multiple [[ethnic group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Manuela, S. &amp; Sibley, C. G (2012). Why Do Pacific People with Multiple Ethnic Affiliations Have Poorer Subjective Wellbeing? Negative Ingroup Affect Mediates the Identity Tension Effect. Social Indicators Research, 1, 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Differences were found in levels of [[subjective well-being]] depending on the number of ethnic groups the individual associated with. For example, people who identified only as Pacific had higher levels of wellbeing than people who identified as both Pacific and non-Pacific (e.g. New Zealand European). However, there were no differences in wellbeing levels between people who identified as only Pacific, and people who identified with two Pacific groups (e.g. [[Tongans|Tongan]] and [[Samoans|Samoan]]). This suggests that lower wellbeing only occurred when the two [[ethnic group]]s associated with, were very different (e.g. Pacific and New Zealand European).

Identity Tension Effect: Associating with both a Pacific group and a majority ethnic group (e.g. [[New Zealand European]]) may lead to negative feelings about Pacific aspects of [[Personal identity|identity]]. This is because people who identify with multiple [[ethnic group]]s tend to be more likely to [[internalise]] negative [[stereotypes]] about Pacific people held by the majority. This can lead to identity confusion and lowered [[self-esteem]]. 

[[Population projection]]s suggest that the Pacific community will grow by 60% by 2026.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Social Development. (2008). Diverse communities: Exploring the refugee and migrant experience in New Zealand. Wellington, NZ: Ministry of Social Development.&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately one third of Pacific people identify as both Pacific and non-Pacific. This means that a growing percentage of the New Zealand population may be at risk of a number of negative outcomes. These outcomes include both lower [[self-esteem]], as well as decreased feelings of support from family. Through applied research interventions such as challenging negative [[stereotype]]s and promoting positive [[stereotype]]s about Pacific peoples, it may be possible to address this problem.

[[File:Vacuum tanker for pit emptying.jpg|thumb|Vacuum truck.]]

A '''vacuum truck''' or '''vacuum tanker''' is a [[tank truck]] that has a pump and a tank. The pump is designed to pneumatically suck liquids, sludges, [[Slurry|slurries]], or  the like from a location (often underground) into the tank of the truck. The objective is to enable transport of the liquid material via road to another location. Vacuum trucks transport the collected material to a treatment or disposal site, for example a [[sewage treatment plant]].

A common material to be transport is [[septage]] (or more broadly: [[Fecal sludge management|fecal sludge]]) which is [[human excreta]] mixed with water, e.g. from [[septic tank]]s and [[Pit latrine|pit latrines]]). They also transport [[sewage sludge]], industrial liquids, or slurries from [[manure|animal waste]] from livestock facilities with pens. 

Vacuum trucks can be equipped with a high pressure pump if they are used to clean out [[Sewerage|sewers]] from sand.

Other names used for vacuum trucks: vacuum tanker, "Sucker truck" (in Australia) or "Sewer Sucker", "Hydro-vac", or "vac-trucks" (in Canada). Slang terms include: "honey truck", "honey sucker" (in India and South Africa), and "[[Honeywagon (vehicle)|honeywagon]]", all (probably) derived from [[Bucket toilet|honey bucket]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

When a vacuum truck is used to transport [[Fecal sludge management|fecal sludge]] then it can also be called "fecal sludge truck".

== Design and configurations ==
Commercial vacuum trucks which collect fecal sludge usually have a volume of {{convert|10|-|55|m3}}.&lt;ref name="FSM book 9-2"&gt;Strande, L., Ronteltap, M., Brdjanovic, D. (eds.) (2014). [http://www.eawag.ch/en/department/sandec/publikationen/faecal-sludge-management-fsm-book/ Faecal Sludge Management (FSM) book - Systems Approach for Implementation and Operation]. Page 81. IWA Publishing, UK ({{ISBN|9781780404738}})&lt;/ref&gt; However various smaller versions for specialized applications or low-resource settings can be found with tanks as small as {{convert|500|l}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=O’Riordan|first1=Mark|title=Investigation into Methods of Pit Latrine Emptying|date=April 2009|publisher=WRC PROJECT 1745  Management of sludge accumulation in VIP latrines|pages=15pp|url=http://www.sswm.info/sites/default/files/reference_attachments/O%20RIORDAN%202009%20Investigation%20into%20Methods%20of%20Pit%20Latrine%20Emptying.pdf|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pumps ===
They generally use a low-volume [[rotary vane vacuum pump|sliding vane pump]] or a [[liquid ring pump]] to create a [[vacuum|negative air pressure]].&lt;ref name="FSM book 9-2" /&gt; The use of [[diaphragm pump|diaphragm mud pumps]] is less common, but with the advantage of a simpler design and usually lower overall costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wastecorp Pumps|title=Mud sucker diaphragm pumps|url=http://www.pumpfundamentals.com/pumpdatabase2/wastecorp-mudsucker.pdf|publisher=Wastecorp|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disadvantage is that mechanical parts come into contact with the sludge, which is not the case for the more common vacuum pumps.

The truck can be configured to be a direct belt drive, or a hydraulic drive system.

There are two different ways to mount the pump: either directly on the truck with the vacuum drive powered by the truck motor, or on the trailer with an independent motor. The second option with the independent motor is more complicated and not commonly used. It has the advantage of potentially having the pump closer to the septic tank. It is also able to use the negative pressure [[suction]] side of the pump as well as the positive pressure side to pump sludge over longer distances or lift it higher into the tank.

=== Suction hoses ===
The [[hard suction hose|suction hoses]] are typically {{Convert|2|to|4|inch|cm}} in diameter with {{Convert|3|inch|cm}} being the norm. The possible length depends on various factors mainly related to the lift and other pressure losses. It is usually impossible to extend it beyond {{convert|50|m}}.

An inherent [[suction]] limitation of all [[suction pump]]s is that they can only lift a liquid through utilizing [[atmospheric pressure]]. For pure water the theoretical maximum lift is approximately {{convert|10.3|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/tech/fluids/hydstat.htm#Maxh|title=Hydrostatics|last=|first=|date=5 January 2007|website=|publisher=Composed by J. B. Calvert|access-date=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the [[viscosity]] of fecal sludge it is possible to mix air into it either by sucking close from the surface or by adding air with a [[air compressor|compressor]] through a separate hose. Through this process, the overall density of the sludge/air mixture can be reduced below that of pure water and thus a higher lift ({{convert|10|-|15|m}}) can be reached under optimal conditions. Other factors affecting the possible lift and total length of the suction hose are that single stage [[vacuum pump]]s only reach a 85-90% partial [[vacuum]], and that small air leakages, pipe [[friction loss]]es, and the [[viscosity]] of the liquid further reduce the possible lift.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Emptying the tanker===

Normally a tanker is emptied by gravity. There is a possibility to pressure up the vacuum tank in order to "pressure out" the liquid quicker or against a small difference in level. But that procedure is not good for the equipment and is therefore done only in special situations.

The regular discharge time for a tanker of {{convert|8|–|9|m3}} is about 15 minutes (or 7–10 minutes to unload a tanker of {{convert|4000|l}}). The outlet is typically {{Convert|4 to 6|inch|cm}} in diameter. The discharge time depends on the thickness of the sludge, the size of the outlet valve and hose, the amount of garbage in the fecal sludge, and how often the driver has to stop to clean the dump screen.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Uses==
Vacuum trucks are used by town and municipal governments, as well as commercial entities around the world.&lt;ref name="FSM book 9"&gt;Strande, L., Ronteltap, M., Brdjanovic, D. (eds.) (2014). [http://www.eawag.ch/en/department/sandec/publikationen/faecal-sludge-management-fsm-book/ Faecal Sludge Management (FSM) book - Systems Approach for Implementation and Operation]. IWA Publishing, UK ({{ISBN|9781780404738}})&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human excreta ===
Several types of non-centralized sanitation systems are served by vacuum trucks. They are used to empty [[septage]] from [[cesspit]]s, [[septic tank]]s, [[pit latrine]]s, and communal [[latrine]]s, for street cleanup, for [[Sewerage|sewer]] clean out, and for individual [[septic system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd Kahn, John Hulls, Peter Aschwanden, ''The Septic System Owner's Manual'' Shelter Publications, Inc., 2007 {{ISBN|0-936070-40-4}} page 49&lt;/ref&gt; The trucks are used in the cleaning of sanitary sewer pumping stations. Vacuum trucks are used to empty [[portable toilet]]s. In commercial [[aviation]], vacuum trucks are used to collect waste from [[airplane]] toilets.

Vacuum trucks discharge these wastes to the sewer network, to a [[wastewater treatment plant]], or—usually illegally, for example in many developing countries— directly into the environment. The latter practice, called "institutionalised [[open defecation]]", is dangerous since it constitutes a [[public health]] and environmental hazard.

=== Industrial liquids ===
Vacuum trucks are used in the [[petroleum industry]], for cleaning of storage tanks and spills. They are also an important part of drilling oil and natural gas [[oil well|wells]], as they are located at the drilling site. Vacuum trucks are used to remove drilling mud, drilling cuttings, cement, spills, and for removal of [[brine]] water from production tanks. They dispose of this in [[sump pit]]s, treatment plants or if within safe levels may be spread out in a farmer's field.

=== Others ===
Vacuum trucks are also used for exposing underground utilities. The ground is jetted with water, and the vacuum truck sucks up the muddy product. This exposes the buried utility without the possibility of damage, as would be possible if a digging machine were used (i.e. tractor backhoe, tracked or wheeled excavator, ditch witches).

Vacuum trucks can also be used for cleanup of [[Soil contamination|contaminated soil]].

== Examples ==

===Bangalore, India ===
A typical vacuum truck in India has a capacity of {{convert|3,000|l}} and serves about five buildings a day. Assuming a 2-year emptying cycle one truck can cater to about 3,000 to 4,000 buildings or 15,000 to 20,000 people. Vacuum trucks are an alternative to the dangerous and humiliating practice of [[manual scavenging]] that became illegal in India with the Manual Scavenging Act of 1993. In the city of [[Bangalore]] alone, it is estimated that there were up to 200 such trucks in 2012, serving more than 3 million people.&lt;ref&gt;Vishwanat Srikantaiah, Biome Environmental Trust: Sanitation without pipes - The 'Honeysucker' Approach to Human Waste Management Using Vacuum Trucks, in: Water and Food Security, World Water Week in Stockholm, 2012, Abstract Volume, p. 239-240&lt;/ref&gt; These vacuum trucks are operated by private companies without the need for subsidies. The charge for emptying a septic tank is between 1,200 and 3,000 Rupees (USD 24 and 60) every two years. After three months of composting, a truckload of compost can be sold for 1,500 to 2,000 Rupees (USD 30 to 40). In the Bangalore area, compost is used primarily on banana and coconut trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Elisabeth Kvarnström, Vectura Consulting, Inc. Joep Verhagen, IRC Mats Nilsson, MN Context Vishwanath Srikantaiah, Biome Karan Singh, Biome Shubha Ramachandran, Biome|title=Honey-suckers: Sanitation without pipes. Eco-san at work?|url=http://www.arghyam.org/sites/default/files/Honeysuckers%20-S%20Vishwanath.pdf|accessdate=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rainwaterharvesting.wordpress.com|title=Eliminating manual scavenging – The Honey-sucker approach|url=http://rainwaterharvesting.wordpress.com/2011/11/10/eliminating-manual-scavenging/|accessdate=2 September 2012|date=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compost can generate revenues since it replaces expensive fertilizer. If [[septage]] is discharged on land for composting, each vacuum truck requires {{convert|1|ha}} of land for composting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16117">'''Water supply and sanitation in Zimbabwe''' is defined by many small scale successful programs but also by a general lack of improved water and [[sanitation]] systems for the majority of [[Zimbabwe]]. According to the [[World Health Organization]] in 2012, 80% of Zimbabweans had access to improved, i.e. clean, [[drinking-water]] sources, and only 40% of Zimbabweans had access to improved sanitation facilities.&lt;ref&gt;"Exposure Data by Country."

AMCOW. Collaboratively published report circa 2010. http://www.wsp.org/sites/wsp.org/files/publications/CSO-Zimbabwe.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many factors which continue to determine the nature, for the foreseeable future, of water supply and sanitation in Zimbabwe. Three major factors are the severely depressed state of the Zimbabwean economy, the willingness of foreign aid organizations to build and finance infrastructure projects, and the political stability of the Zimbabwean state.&lt;ref name="wsp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hrw"&gt;"Troubled Water Burst Pipes, Contaminated Wells, and Open Defecation in Zimbabwe's Capital." Human Rights Watch. Independently published report, 2o13, U.S.A.. https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/zimbabwe1113_forUpload_1.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Upon gaining independence in 1980 Zimbabwe inherited an undeveloped rural water supply and sanitation infrastructure system, but a better functioning urban water supply and sanitation network.&lt;ref name="wsp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hrw"/&gt; Conditions throughout the 1980s and the early 1990s were highly advantageous to Zimbabwe's water and sanitation sectors due to the massive support for the incoming elected majority government as well as an influx of foreign investment. This support manifested itself in the highly ambitious Integrated Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Programme (IRWSSP) in 1985. The IRWSSP attempted to provide improved water and sanitation facilities to all rural Zimbabweans by 2005.&lt;ref name="its"&gt;"The Zimbabwe Experience, Lessons From a Review of 15 Years of the Zimbabwe integrated Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Program." Water and Sanitation Program. Published May 2002.  http://www.its.caltech.edu/~e105/readings/cases/rural_sanitation-zimbabwe.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Although IRWSSP did not achieve this goal, it was still greatly beneficial as Zimbabwe experienced, according to the African Development Bank, "one of the highest rates of growth in water supply and sanitation services"&lt;ref name="afdb"/&gt; between the years 1980 to 2000. However, after the turn of the millennium, Zimbabwe's economy has gone through a period of steep decline and many foreign investors have departed.&lt;ref name="fao"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/countries_regions/zimbabwe/index.stm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222053023/http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/countries_regions/zimbabwe/index.stm|title=AQUASTAT - FAO's Information System on Water and Agriculture|archivedate=22 December 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is partly due to political reforms, especially those of land reform, enacted by the government of President [[Robert Mugabe]].&lt;ref&gt;"Zimbabwe profile." BBC. Accessed November 1, 2014. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-14113618.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Zimbabwe's population has been steadily growing over the last thirty years, and as a result there is a pressing need for updating and expanding aging water and sanitation infrastructure throughout Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name="hrw"/&gt; The deteriorating water supply and sanitation sectors caught up with Zimbabwe in 2008 and 2009, as Zimbabwe experienced a massive cholera outbreak ([[Zimbabwean cholera outbreak]]), during which almost 100,000 were infected and over 4,000 died.&lt;ref name="wsp"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Zimbabwe cholera 'to top 100,000.'" BBC. Accessed October 19, 2014. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8068232.stm.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sector overview==

===Geography===
Zimbabwe is a landlocked country and therefore its major water supplies are lakes, rivers, and aquifers. The two major rivers in Zimbabwe are the [[Zambezi River]] in the north, and the [[Limpopo River]] in the south. Several other rivers with significant watershed areas that flow through Zimbabwe are the Save, Manyame, and Sanyati Rivers. The biggest lake in Zimbabwe is [[Lake Kariba]] which is on the border with Zambia.&lt;ref name="fao"/&gt; There are several large aquifers in Zimbabwe.

===Technical infrastructure===
In urban centers of Zimbabwe the majority of the water supply comes from piped water. In rural areas, Zimbabweans predominantly rely on wells and boreholes that tap into Zimbabwe's groundwater supply.&lt;ref name="afdb"/&gt; The construction of many wells was mainly financed by the households themselves. The dynamic development of the private sector is a good example of how [[Self-supply of water and sanitation|self-supply]] initiatives can reach large parts of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Olschewski|first=Andre|title=Supported Self-supply – learning from 15 years of experiences|url=https://rwsnforum7.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/full_paper_0044_submitter_0121_olschewski_andre.pdf|year=2016|publisher=7th RWSN Forum “Water for Everyone”, 7ème Forum RWSN « L'eau pour tous », 29 Nov - 02 Dec 2016, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many Zimbabweans still practice [[open defecation]], especially in rural areas.&lt;ref name="unicef"/&gt; However, in large urban centers such as [[Harare]], there are [[Sewerage|sewage systems]], and many homes throughout Zimbabwe have private [[Pit latrine|pit latrines]] or share communal latrines.&lt;ref name="its"/&gt;
[[File:Women and children at a borehole.jpg|thumb|left|A group of women and children at a borehole in Norton, Zimbabwe]]

In 2018 problems at the Morton Jeffray Waterworks in Harare were said to be the cause of the renewed cholera outbreak. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Makoni |first1=Munyaradzi |title=Inside Zimbabwe's efforts to tame cholera |url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)32352-3/fulltext |accessdate=8 November 2018 |publisher=Lancet |date=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current issues===
According to [[UNICEF]], over 60% of the rural water supply infrastructure in Zimbabwe is in a state of disrepair,&lt;ref name="unicef"/&gt; and as a result, many boreholes and wells contain non potable water and are in need of decontamination. Even in urban centers, piped water supply is very sporadic and sometimes unclean. This is partly due to poor sanitation and refuse systems resulting in many sewers which are often highly polluted.&lt;ref name="hrw"/&gt; There is also a pressing inadequacy in the number of public and private latrines.&lt;ref name="its"/&gt; An additional problem that comes with the need to update and expand an aging and contaminated water supply and sanitation network (well, boreholes, piped water, latrines, etc.) is the need to educate all members of the Zimbabwean public on available opportunities for improving personal access to improved water supply and sanitation. During the cholera outbreak of 2008-2009 information from the Zimbabwean government about the safety of available water supplies people was particularly unclear.&lt;ref name="hrw"/&gt; One method that has proved effective at improving the sanitation practices of the public are [[Community Health Clubs in Africa|community health clubs]], which have also proved to be cost effective and highly popular.&lt;ref name="its"/&gt;
[[Image:KaribaDam.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Kariba dam as seen from [[Zimbabwe]].]]

==Institutional overview==
Water supply and sanitation in Zimbabwe is managed by a number of different governmental ministries and departments. The overarching organizations that control all water resources are the National Action Committee or NAC, and the Ministry of Water Resources Development and Management (MoWRDM).&lt;ref name="wsp"/&gt; These groups directly oversee the WASH coalition, a combination of NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations), UNICEF, and other private groups, that is chaired by the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare, and which finances and builds sanitation and water supply systems in the hope of fulfilling the UN Millennium Development Goal.&lt;ref name="wsscc"&gt;http://www.wsscc.org/countries/africa/zimbabwe/wash-coalition-overview&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the NAC and MoWRDM also oversee the Zimbabwe National Water Authority (ZINWA) which chiefly deals with water supply and distribution to the industrial, agriculture, and private sectors. ZINWA is subdivided into different areas of water catchment. Additionally, ZINWA oversees the 250 major dams in Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name="afdb"&gt;"Water Resource Management, Supply, and Sanitation Zimbabwe Report." African Development Bank Group. Accessed September 7, 2014. http://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Generic-Documents/9.%20Zimbabwe%20Report_Chapter%207.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; As well as this, the NAC is divided into two subcommittees, the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Committee and the Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Committee, which are composed of many different governmental agencies and are responsible for the planning and infrastructure of water supply and sanitation in rural and urban areas respectively.&lt;ref name="wsp"/&gt; Local water distribution is overseen by local village or regional governments and sometimes by ZINWA itself.

==External cooperation==
A number of foreign governments and NGOs are actively working to improve water supply and sanitation in Zimbabwe through both small and large scale infrastructure projects. As well as actively participating, these organizations finance many other efforts. These organizations include the [[World Bank]], the [[African Development Bank]] (AfDB), and the German Government, who through its technical cooperation agency, [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit]] (GIZ), gave $6 million (US) to improve the water supply and sanitation systems in the towns of [[Gweru]], [[Kadoma, Zimbabwe|Kadoma]], and [[Kariba, Zimbabwe|Kariba]]. The Australian government also provided over $10 million (US) for water supply and sanitation system improvements and research.&lt;ref name="afdb"/&gt;

===WASH sector===
UNICEF is currently managing several programs in collaboration with the entire [[WASH]] program to ameliorate water and sewage systems. These include updating sanitation systems in the towns of [[Masvingo]], [[Plumtree, Zimbabwe|Plumtree]], and [[Zvishavane]], and managing a $30 million (US Dollars) project to provide potable water and improved sanitation to 500,000 Zimbabweans. As well as this, UNICEF and the entire WASH program are working towards providing safe water and sanitation to 2.3 million people in Zimbabwe currently without access to improved water and sanitation.&lt;ref name="unicef"&gt;"Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene." UNICEF. Accessed September 7, 2014. http://www.unicef.org/zimbabwe/water_san_hygiene.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental concerns==
As a result of mining, industry, large scale unsustainable agriculture, and somewhat lax and unenforced pollution laws, many rivers and lakes in Zimbabwe are polluted. This has made drinking and bathing in these rivers and lakes unsafe.&lt;ref&gt;Musapindira, Mlambo. "Zimbabwe's river system heavily polluted." The Standard. Published April 7, 2013. http://www.thestandard.co.zw/2013/04/07/zimbabwes-river-system-heavily-polluted/.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gogo, Jeffrey. "Water Pollution Major Problem." The Herald. Published May 19, 2014. http://www.herald.co.zw/water-pollution-major-problem/&lt;/ref&gt; In particular the water of several rivers that go through the [[Marange diamond fields]] in eastern Zimbabwe has been so polluted that it has killed livestock that drank it and given rashes to bathers.&lt;ref&gt;Mambondiyani, Andrew. "The Pollution Fallout From Zimbabwe's Blood Diamonds." Yale University. May 24, 2012. http://e360.yale.edu/feature/the_pollution_fallout_from_zimbabwes_blood_diamonds/2533/&lt;/ref&gt; Another area of Zimbabwe with especially high levels of water pollution is [[Harare]] and its nearby suburbs. This is due to the large population of Harare, decrepit and broken sewage systems, and mismanagement by government agencies designated to enforce environmental and water quality regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Nhapi, Innocent. "The water situation in Harare, Zimbabwe: a policy and management problem." Water Policy 11. Published 2009. http://test.iwaponline.com/wp/01102/0221/011020221.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Fortunately, there are programs in place that inspect the quality of the water of many of the major rivers as well as gauging stations that measure the water supply levels of Zimbabwe's dams.&lt;ref&gt;"Zimbabwe." FAO. Accessed November 1, 2014. http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/x9751e/x9751e08.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human concerns==

===Effects of water quality on health===
The lack of improved water supply and sanitation severely impacts the human capabilities of all Zimbabweans. Without clean water and proper sanitation human beings are more prone to contracting illnesses, and therefore suffer greater rates of morbidity and mortality due to these illnesses. Improved water supply and sanitation sectors are shown to be highly effective at reducing the rates of morbidity and mortality for many illnesses including [[ascariasis]], [[cholera]], [[diarrhea]], [[dracunculiasis]], [[hookworm]] infection, [[schistosomiasis]], and [[trachoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2393264/pdf/bullwho00050-0101.pdf. | pmc=2393264 | pmid=1835675 | volume=69 | title=Effects of improved water supply and sanitation on ascariasis, diarrhoea, dracunculiasis, hookworm infection, schistosomiasis, and trachoma | year=1991 | journal=Bull. World Health Organ. | pages=609–21 | last1 = Esrey | first1 = SA | last2 = Potash | first2 = JB | last3 = Roberts | first3 = L | last4 = Shiff | first4 = C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diarrhea is an especially serious disease considering it is the largest killer of children under the age of five in Africa.&lt;ref name="hrw"/&gt; Also, cholera is a very serious sickness in Zimbabwe especially considering the high human toll of the Zimbabwean cholera outbreak of 2008 and 2009.

===Open defecation===
The serious effects of unimproved water supply and sanitation on health and human dignity are reasons why one of the [[UN Millennium Development Goals]] was to halve "the proportion of the population without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation".&lt;ref&gt;"Goal 7: insure Environmental Stability." UN. Accessed October 19, 2014. http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/environ.shtml.&lt;/ref&gt; One key facet of the Millennium Development Goal was limiting the number of people who openly defecate which UNICEF estimates is currently at 40% of Zimbabweans in rural areas.&lt;ref name="unicef"/&gt; Open defecation can be an infringement on human dignity &lt;ref name="hrw"/&gt; that lowers human capabilities and a risk to clean sanitation and health.

===Gender equality===
By creating improved water supply and sanitation facilities women's lives achieve greater agency. It is often women who are responsible for providing the water supply used by the family on a day-to-day basis. As a result of a family having clean bathrooms and a safe water supply within close proximity of its dwelling, women spend less time collecting water and more time pursuing their own ambitions or doing other necessary work.&lt;ref name="its"/&gt; In addition the lack of clean bathrooms in many Zimbabwean schools prevent girls from attending school while menstruating. Thus, eliminating poor sanitation and increasing access to potable water greatly increases human dignity and capabilities.&lt;ref name="hrw"/&gt;
