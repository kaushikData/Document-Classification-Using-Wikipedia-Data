'''Ace''' is a fictional character played by [[Sophie Aldred]] in the long-running British [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Doctor Who: Ace visitor in Norwich  |work= [[BBC]]|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/norfolk/content/articles/2008/02/04/doctor_who_sophie_aldred_20080204_feature.shtml|accessdate=2011-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 20th-century [[Earth]] teenager from the [[London]] suburb of [[Perivale]], she is a [[companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] of the [[Seventh Doctor]] and was a regular in the series from 1987 to 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= The Den of Geek interview: Sophie Aldred  |work= The Den of Geek|url= http://www.denofgeek.com/television/9969/the_den_of_geek_interview_sophie_aldred.html|accessdate=2011-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is considered one of the Doctor's most popular companions.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/what-ever-happened-to-ace-51116.htm|title = What Ever Happened to...Ace?|date = 20 August 2013|accessdate = 28 April 2015|website = Doctor Who TV|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ace appeared in nine stories (31 episodes), and was the final companion in the original run of the classic series.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Whoology: Doctor Who the Official Miscellany|last = Scott|first = Cavan|publisher = BBC Books|year = 2013|isbn = 9781849906197|location = |pages = 146–147|last2 = Wright|first2 = Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Doctor Who'' script editor Andrew Cartmel said that the character was written to be a "fighter and not a screamer".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/doctor-who/33496/doctor-who-how-ace-set-the-template-for-modern-companions|title = Doctor Who: How Ace Set the Template for Modern Companions|date = 5 January 2015|accessdate = 28 April 2015|website = Den of Geek|publisher = |last = Younger|first = Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character history==
Ace is a 16-year-old human who first appears in the 1987 serial ''[[Dragonfire (Doctor Who)|Dragonfire]]'', where she is working as a waitress in the frozen food retail complex of Iceworld on the planet Svartos.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Who's Who of Doctor Who|last = McEwan|first = Cameron K.|publisher = Race Point Publishing|year = 2014|isbn = 9781937994709|location = New York|page = 50}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had been a troubled teen on Earth, having been expelled from school for blowing up the art room as a "creative statement". Gifted in chemistry (despite failing the subject at [[General Certificate of Education|O-level]]), she was in her room experimenting with the extraction of [[nitroglycerin]] from [[gelignite]] when a 'time storm' swept her up and transported her to Iceworld, many years in the future.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There, she meets [[Seventh Doctor|the Doctor]] and his companion [[Mel Bush|Mel]]. When Mel leaves the Doctor at the conclusion of the serial, he offers to take Ace with him in the [[TARDIS]], and she happily accepts.

Ace suffered traumatic events in her childhood, including a bad relationship with her mother Audrey (the daughter of [[Merchant Navy|merchant seaman]] Frank William Dudman and his wife Kathleen, who served in the  [[Women's Royal Naval Service]] during [[World War II]])&lt;ref&gt;Revealed in ''[[The Curse of Fenric]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and the racially motivated [[Molotov cocktail]] firebombing of her friend Manisha's flat when she was 13. Following the latter event, needing to lash out, she burned down a local abandoned [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] house named Gabriel Chase after sensing the presence of the villain [[List of Doctor Who villains#Light|Light]] there and was put on [[probation]]. Consequently, Ace covered up her own fears and insecurities with a streetwise, tough exterior. Her weapon of choice, disapproved of by the Doctor (who nonetheless found it useful on occasion), was a powerful explosive she called "Nitro-9", which she invented and mixed up in canisters which she carried around in her backpack.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Affectionately giving the Doctor the nickname of "Professor",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ace is convinced that he needs her to watch his back, and protects him with a fierce loyalty. In turn, the Doctor seems to take a special interest in Ace's education, taking her across the universe and often prompting her to figure out explanations for herself rather than giving her all the answers. However, the Seventh Doctor's increasing tendency to manipulate events and people (including her), even with what appears to be the best of intentions, results in several difficult moments in their relationship.

Under the Doctor's tutelage, Ace fights the [[Dalek]]s in ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]'', the [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] in ''[[Silver Nemesis]]'', encounters the all-powerful [[List of Doctor Who villains#G|Gods of Ragnarok]] in ''[[The Greatest Show in the Galaxy]]'', the sadistic torturer [[Kandy Man]] in ''[[The Happiness Patrol]]'', and many other dangers. She also faces the ghosts of her own past in ''[[Ghost Light (Doctor Who)|Ghost Light]]'' and ''[[The Curse of Fenric]]'', coming to terms with them and, ironically, creating them in the latter case thanks to the [[predestination paradox|paradoxes of time travel]]. Over time, she starts to mature into a confident young woman, and her brash exterior ceases to be a front.

What the Doctor is aware of, but Ace is not, is that her arrival on Iceworld was no accident but part of a larger scheme stretching across the centuries and conceived by [[Fenric]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; an evil that had existed since the beginning of the universe. Ace is a "Wolf of Fenric", one of many descendants of a [[Norsemen|Norseman]] tainted with Fenric's genetic instructions to help free it from its ancient prison so it can evolve humans into the Vampiric Haemovores, and a pawn in the complex game between it and the Doctor. After Fenric is defeated in 1943, Ace continues to journey with the Doctor.

In the original script for Part One of ''The Curse of Fenric'', writer [[Ian Briggs]] planned to reveal that Ace was no longer a virgin, but producer [[John Nathan-Turner]] forced him to cut this.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Instead, at one point in the story, Ace offers to distract a guard so that the Doctor can free a prisoner. When the Doctor asks how she plans to divert the guard's attention she replies that she is "not a little girl". She proceeds to lead the guard away from his post by intriguing him with a combination of slightly suggestive innuendo towards the guard and cryptic musings about the Doctor's machinations. The scene suggests that she is aware of both her developed sexuality and the Doctor's manipulative tendencies. Briggs, who had created the character of Ace, had stated in Ace's character outline for ''Dragonfire'' that she had lost her virginity to [[Sabalom Glitz]] on Iceworld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|
url=http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/7m.html|
title="A Brief History of Time (Travel)" - ''The Curse of Fenric''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circumstances of Ace's parting of ways with the Doctor are not known, as the series went on hiatus in 1989 with the end of the very next serial, ''[[Survival (Doctor Who)|Survival]]'', in which Ace is returned by the Doctor to Perivale but ultimately chooses to leave again with him. A painting seen in the extended version of ''Silver Nemesis'' suggests that at some point in her personal future Ace will end up in 18th or 19th century [[France]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This idea is further explored in the novelisation of ''The Curse of Fenric'' and the [[Virgin New Adventures]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The novelisation contains an epilogue not included in the televised serial, in which the Doctor visits an older Ace in 1887 Paris.

If the series had continued, the production team's intent was to have Ace eventually enter the Prydonian Academy on the Doctor's home planet of [[Gallifrey]] and train to be a [[Time Lord]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The story ''Ice Time'' by [[Marc Platt (writer)|Marc Platt]], in which this would happen, was never made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Seventh Doctor is next seen in the [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|1996 ''Doctor Who'' television movie]], he is travelling alone, with no reference made as to what had happened to Ace.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, in ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' story ''[[Death of the Doctor]]'', Sarah Jane reveals to her companions that she has done research on some of the Doctor's companions. She mentions "that Dorothy something — she runs that charity, 'A Charitable Earth' ("ACE"). She's raised billions."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the same episode, the [[Eleventh Doctor]] reveals that his [[Tenth Doctor|Tenth incarnation]] looked in on each of his former companions as he prepared for regeneration at the end of ''[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]''.

==Other appearances==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}
[[File:Ace Virgin cover.jpg|thumb|Ace in her Spacefleet uniform, after rejoining the Doctor in ''Deceit''.]]
Ace and the Seventh Doctor appeared twice more on television after ''Doctor Who'' was cancelled. The first occasion was in 1990, in a special episode of the [[BBC Two|BBC2]] educational programme ''Search Out Science''. In this episode, the Doctor acts as a quiz show host, asking questions about astronomy; Ace, [[K-9 (Doctor Who)|K-9]] and "Cedric, from the planet Glurk" are the contestants. The last appearance of Ace on British television was in the 1993 charity special ''[[Dimensions in Time]]''.

Ace was also featured in the ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' comic strip sporadically, one of the few television companions to appear in it.

The character is extensively developed in the [[Virgin New Adventures|New Adventures]], a BBC-licensed series of novels from [[Virgin Books]] continuing on from ''Survival''. Ace becomes more and more frustrated with the Doctor's manipulations; he forcibly separates her from a potential relationship with Robin Yeadon in ''[[Nightshade (Doctor Who)|Nightshade]]'' and sacrifices her lover Jan to defeat the alien Hoothi in ''[[Love and War (Doctor Who)|Love and War]]'' by [[Paul Cornell]], which proves to be the last straw. She leaves the TARDIS, joins Spacefleet and fights the Daleks for three years, later rejoining the Doctor and his new companion [[Bernice Summerfield]] in ''[[Deceit (Doctor Who)|Deceit]]'' by [[Peter Darvill-Evans]], older and more hardened. This development in the character was the result of a deliberate decision by Darvill-Evans as the editor of the line at Virgin to change Ace and her role in the ongoing narrative. It is first revealed in ''[[Blood Heat]]'' by [[Jim Mortimore]] that Manisha had died in the firebombing of her flat.

Ace's relationship with the Doctor remains strained for some time, boiling over in ''Blood Heat'' when the Doctor destroys an unstable parallel Earth (where Manisha is still alive) and under the influence of an alien creature she stabs him through one of his hearts in ''[[The Left-Handed Hummingbird]]''. In ''[[No Future (Doctor Who novel)|No Future]]'' (also by Cornell) the [[Meddling Monk]] tries to manipulate her into betraying the Doctor, which she seemingly does, again stabbing him and leaving him alone on an ice planet. In reality she stabbed him with a pantomime knife from the TARDIS wardrobe and she is playing her own game (partly to teach him what it feels like to be manipulated). When the Monk and his chained Chronovore offer her a chance to return Jan to life, she refuses and rejoins the TARDIS crew, her issues with the Doctor resolved. In ''[[Set Piece (Doctor Who)|Set Piece]]'' by [[Kate Orman]], Ace becomes stranded in Ancient Egypt and comes to realise that she can survive without the Doctor, but that she also increasingly sees the world as he does. At the book's end she leaves the Doctor again to become Time's Vigilante, using a short-range time hopper mounted on a motorcycle to patrol a particular segment of time; in effect doing what the Doctor does, but on a smaller scale. She appears in later books, notably ''[[Head Games (Doctor Who)|Head Games]]'', ''[[Happy Endings (Doctor Who)|Happy Endings]]'', and ''[[Lungbarrow]]''.

Other [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] media give contradictory versions of Ace's eventual fate. The comic strip in ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' has Ace killed off just prior to the events of the 1996 television movie (''Ground Zero'', DWM #238-#242). In the webcast audio play ''[[Death Comes to Time]]'', Ace inherits the mantle of the Time Lords when they become extinct.

Ace's first name is Dorothy, and production notes suggest that it was intended that her last name would be Gale{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}, an allusion to ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', given the fact that she was transported to Iceworld via a time storm. In another contradiction, the novels (and, following their lead, [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] audio plays) have given Ace the last name of McShane. A sequence of BBC Books' [[Past Doctor Adventures]] set after ''Survival'' and written by [[Mike Tucker]] and [[Robert Perry (writer)|Robert Perry]] used the "Dorothy Gale" name, as the authors were unaware of the name used in the New Adventures. This was eventually resolved to some extent when the novel [[Loving the Alien (novel)]] by Tucker and Perry saw the original Ace (Dorothy Gale) shot and killed, but replaced by an Ace from another universe whose real name is "Dorothy McShane". Loving the Alien also makes it clear that all the television episodes and Tucker/Perry novels occur ''before'' the New Adventures, thus reconciling the different ranges.

Sophie Aldred has voiced Ace for several audio plays produced by Big Finish Productions, alongside [[Sylvester McCoy]] as the Seventh Doctor and, in some stories, [[Lisa Bowerman]] as [[Bernice Summerfield]] or [[Philip Olivier]] as [[Hex (Doctor Who)|Hex]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In one of these stories, ''[[The Rapture (Doctor Who audio)|The Rapture]]'', Ace discovers that she has a brother named Liam, of whom she had no previous knowledge. As the more experienced traveller, Ace has developed a slightly flirtatious mentor-teacher relationship with Hex. How the audio plays tie in with the other media is not clear, and the continuity of the various lines may not match up with each other.

In 1996, Virgin's Doctor Who Books imprint published a hardback by Sophie Aldred and Mike Tucker entitled ''Ace!: The Inside Story of the End of an Era'' ({{ISBN|1-85227-574-X}}). This book gives details of each serial featuring the character Ace, complete with many photographs and concept art. It also contains a list of other spin-offs in which the character of Ace appears and some of the conventions which Sophie Aldred attended, along with information about the planned Season 27, including Ace's departure. In 1998, [[Bill &amp; Ben Video|BBV]] produced a number of audio adventures starring McCoy and Aldred as "The Professor" and "Ace". The plays were not licensed by the BBC, but the duo were clearly intended to be the same characters, to the extent that the BBC intervened, causing BBV to change the character names to "The [[Dominie]]" and "Alice".

The [[Reeltime Pictures]] video ''[[Mindgame (Doctor Who)|Mindgame]]'' features Sophie Aldred as "the Human", imprisoned with a [[Sontaran]] and a [[Draconian (Doctor Who)|Draconian]].

In 2018, Ace was confirmed to appear in six audio dramas based on Doctor Who spin-off ''[[Class (2016 TV series)|Class]]'', with Aldred reprising her role alongside the show's main cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Warner |first=Sam |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/doctor-who/news/a858221/doctor-who-spin-off-class-returning-big-finish/ |title=Doctor Who spin-off Class returning at Big Finish |publisher=Digitalspy.com |date= 2018-05-31|accessdate=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
The character of Ace has been cited as the first "modern" companion for the Doctor.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2011/07/a-companion-to-the-doctors-companions-ace/|title = A Companion to the Doctor's Companions|date = 29 July 2011|accessdate = 28 April 2015|website = Anglophenia|publisher = BBC America|last = McAlpine|first = Fraser}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the reasons is that her character was written to be more realistic, three-dimensional and to grow as a person throughout her run on the show.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[Alaska Natives|Alaska Native]] cultures are rich and diverse, and their art forms are representations of their history, skills, tradition, adaptation, and nearly twenty thousand years of continuous life in some of the most remote places on earth. These art forms are largely unseen and unknown outside the state of [[Alaska]], due to distance from the art markets of the world.

==History==
[[File:Ak moosehair tufting.jpg|thumb|Moose hair tufting on an [[Alaskan Athabaskans|Athabaskan]] beaded hide box, [[Fairbanks, Alaska]]]]

Historically, "art" as a [[decorative]] concept did not traditionally exist among these indigenous people. Objects were utilitarian, although decorated in ways that conveyed images of spiritual or physical activity. It was not until Europeans and Asians first made contact with the indigenous people of coastal Alaska in the 17th century that such non-utilitarian art objects began to be traded in exchange for metal implements, cloth, and foodstuffs such as tea, flour, or sugar.

Many objects traded were valued for their functionality: clothing woven of grass, harpoon tips carved from the [[ivory]] tusk of the walrus; rainproof outerwear sewn from membranes in the intestines of seals; and animal skins valued for their warmth and durability. Gradually, these items were refined to be more decorative, as a way to increase their value in trade. For example, a [[walrus]] tusk might be etched with many hunting scenes depicting life of the coastal people; later, this technique would come to be known as "[[scrimshaw]]" when brought back to [[New England]] on [[whaling]] ships. Elaborate patterns in [[beadwork]] were designed as the beads themselves arrived through trade; [[Regalia]] of all types used for ceremonial purposes – masks, woven clothing, hats, dance fans – all became souvenirs for the [[whaling|whalers]] and [[Exploration|explorers]] of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Even the towering [[totem poles]] from Southeastern Alaska found their way back to the East Coast of the United States, where they formed the basis of many museum collections.
[[File:Chilkat blanket univ alaska museum.jpg|thumb|left|Chilkat blanket, collection of the [[University of Alaska Museum of the North]]]]

While the art forms were and still are as different as the cultures of the Native people who made them – [[Alaskan Athabaskans|Athabaskan]] Indians of the vast Interior, [[Inupiaq]] of the Northwestern [[Arctic]] coasts; [[Yupik peoples|Yupik]] and [[St. Lawrence Island]] Yupik of the [[Bering Sea]] coast; [[Aleut people|Aleut]]s and [[Alutiiq]] people from the [[Aleutian Islands|Aleutian]] islands; and the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]], [[Haida people|Haida]] and [[Tsimshian]] Indians often known as Northwest Coastal tribes – they commonly evoke references to living in harmony with nature and all its many creatures. No part of an animal hunted, fished or trapped could be wasted, for example, so one might see boots or "[[mukluks]]" made of bearded seal skin for soles, salmon skin for the outer layer, and straps of [[caribou]] or deerskin, perhaps even dyed with berries. As Native people lived off the land and the sea, their relationships to a particular place could always be seen in their objects in both physical and metaphorical terms. As traditions evolved through more "westernization" with [[Russian America]] in the 17th century and [[Alaska Territory|Territorial Alaska]] beginning in 1867 and finally the creation of Alaska as our [[49th State]] in 1959, so did their art forms.

All are continually evolving, blurring the distinction between what an art critic today might want to categorize as "traditional" versus "contemporary" [[Native American art|Native art]]. And contemporary, international art values have a place in Alaska Native art. Wall-size paintings, three-dimensional mobiles, life-size bronze castings and marble [[sculpture]]s, to name just a few categories, fill galleries alongside bears carved from [[whalebone]]s, cribbage boards honed from full-length walrus tusks, fine jewelry etched of copper and silvers; [[Nephrite]] [[jade]] and [[musk ox]] horn polished into bracelets, [[bentwood]] boxes carved from coastal white cedar trees; and baskets of infinite shapes and designs, from [[birch bark]] or woven spruce root, beach grasses or the [[baleen]] from a [[bowhead whale]], all intricately woven and shaped into vessels of all sizes.

==Specific tribes and their art forms==
'''The [[Inupiat people|Inupiat]] tribes''' create useful tools such as bows, arrows, harpoons, float discs, snow beaters, boot sole creasers, skin scrapers, fat removers, spoons, handles, rope, belts and other clothing from materials they find locally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bockstoce | first = J.R. | title = Eskimos of Northwest Alaska in the Early Nineteenth Century | publisher = Oxprint Limited | year = 1977 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These materials include fish skin, [[caribou]] hide, polar bear fur, whale baleen ([[baleen basketry]]), old ivory and seal (all parts of each animal are normally used somehow for tool-making if not consumed).&lt;ref name=eskart&gt;Ray, Dorothy Jean. ''Eskimo Art: Tradition and Innovation in North Alaska.'' Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1977. {{ISBN|978-0-295-95518-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Masks were often made for ceremonial purposes, bringing the people, animals and spirits together in one being.&lt;ref name=eskart/&gt; Traditionally sculptures are not made for decoration, but as "good luck amulets" for hunting, or sometimes they are toys for small children.&lt;ref name=eskart/&gt; Objects are often colored with charcoal and then a layer of fish oil was also applied to assure it does not rub off.&lt;ref name=eskart/&gt; Although contemporary commercial paints are commonly used today. Mukluks (shoes) and [[parka]]s (jackets) were sewn by the women out of animal hides and were generally only elaborately decorated for ceremonies.&lt;ref name=eskart/&gt; This art form is called "skin-sewing."

[[File:Cupik kayak stanchions.jpg|thumb|Cup'ik [[kayak]] stanchions, collection of the [[University of Alaska Museum of the North]]. The left is a male figure, while the right is female.]]
'''The [[Yup'ik]] tribes''' traditionally decorate most all of their tools, even ones that perform smaller functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ray | first = Dorothy | title = Artists of the Tundra and the Sea | publisher = University of Washington Press | year = 1961 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of their most popular forms of art are [[Yup'ik masks|masks]], which are generally made of wood and range in size from a few inches tall to several pounds in weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tribalarts.com/feature/riordan/index.html | title = The Living Tradition of Yup'ik Masks | accessdate = September 27, 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080925212315/http://www.tribalarts.com/feature/riordan/index.html| archivedate= 25 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; They most often create masks for ceremonies but the masks are traditionally destroyed after being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Feinup-Riordan | first = Ann | title = Yup'ik Elders at the Ethnologisches Museum Berlin: Fieldwork Turned on Its Head | publisher = University of Washington Press | year = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These masks are used to bring the person wearing it luck and good fortune in hunts.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

'''The [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] tribes'''' artwork is also frequently functional. Their artwork often consists of clothing and carvings, including canoes and totem poles, which are still well-recognized today. The tools generally used for carving are knives, traditionally made of shell, stone or bone, depending on the artist and what its purpose. The materials that are carved were bone of sheep or goat, and most often wood. Many types of wood are found in the southeastern panhandle of Alaska; some major species include cedar (both yellow and red) for totems and canoes, and finally, alder is used in making dishes and utensils for eating since that wood does not impart its taste onto food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.denaliincorporated.com/Pages/tart.htm | title=More About the Tlingit Native American Art | accessdate = September 27, 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081006224553/http://www.denaliincorporated.com/Pages/tart.htm| archivedate= 6 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Totem poles always tell a story, since the Tlingit culture traditional is an oral culture with minimal written history. Each animal on a totem pole represent family crests or tells a specific story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Corser | first = Harry Prosper | title = Totem Lore of the Alaska Indians | publisher = Unknown }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==

With the advent of the internet, all of these art forms can now be seen and appreciated from anywhere. The [[Alaska Native Arts Foundation]], a non-profit organization, is dedicated to supporting Native artists and their [[subsistence]] lifestyles based on living in harmony with the environment. The [[University of Alaska, Fairbanks]] has a Native art program, created in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Berlo and Phillips 240&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Octopod by syntopia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|"Octopod" by Mikael Hvidtfeldt Christensen. An example of algorithmic art produced with the software ''Structure Synth''.&lt;ref name=Hvidtfeldt&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hvidtfeldt Christensen |first1=Mikael |title=Hvitfeldts.net |url=http://hvidtfeldts.net/ |accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Algorithmic art''', also known as ''algorithm art'', is art, mostly [[visual art]], of which the design is generated by an [[algorithm]]. Algorithmic artists are sometimes called '''algorists'''.

==Overview==
{{further|Mathematics and art}}
Algorithmic art, also known as [[computer-generated art]], is a subset of [[generative art]] (generated by an autonomous system) and is related to [[systems art]] (influenced by systems theory). [[Fractal art]] is an example of algorithmic art.&lt;ref name=UCSB&gt;{{cite web |title=Approximating Reality with Interactive Algorithmic Art |url=http://www.mat.ucsb.edu/~g.legrady/academic/courses/01sp200a/students/brentYokota/200a_fin.html |publisher=University of California Santa Barbara |accessdate=25 December 2015 |date=7 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For an image of reasonable size, even the simplest [[algorithm]]s require too much calculation for manual execution to be practical, and they are thus executed on either a single computer or on a cluster of computers.  The final output is typically displayed on a [[computer monitor]], printed with a [[wikt:raster|raster]]-type printer, or drawn using a [[plotter]].  Variability can be introduced by using [[pseudo-random]] numbers.  There is no consensus as to whether the product of an algorithm that operates on an existing image (or on any input other than pseudo-random numbers) can still be considered computer-generated art, as opposed to computer-assisted art.&lt;ref name=UCSB/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Darb-i Imam shrine spandrel.JPG|thumb|left|[[Islamic geometric patterns]] such as this [[girih]] tiling in the [[Darb-e Imam]] shrine in [[Isfahan]], are precursors of algorithmic art.&lt;ref name=Verostko/&gt;]]

[[Roman Verostko]] argues that [[Islamic geometric patterns]] are constructed using algorithms, as are [[Italian Renaissance]] paintings which make use of [[mathematics and art|mathematical techniques]], in particular [[linear perspective]] and proportion.&lt;ref name=Verostko/&gt;

[[File:San Romano Battle (Paolo Uccello, London) 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2&lt;!--width for very low image--&gt;|[[Paolo Uccello]] made innovative use of a geometric algorithm, incorporating [[linear perspective]] in paintings such as ''[[The Battle of San Romano]]'' (c. 1435–1460): broken lances run along perspective lines.]]

Some of the earliest known examples of computer-generated algorithmic art were created by [[Georg Nees]], [[Frieder Nake]], [[A. Michael Noll]], [[Manfred Mohr]] and [[:fr:Vera Molnár|Vera Molnár]] in the early 1960s. These artworks were executed by a [[plotter]] controlled by a [[computer]], and were therefore computer-generated art but not [[digital art]]. The act of creation lay in writing the [[Computer program|program]], which specified the sequence of actions to be performed by the [[plotter]]. [[Sonia Landy Sheridan]] established Generative Systems as a program at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] in 1970 in response to social change brought about in part by the computer-robot communications revolution.&lt;ref name = "SLS 83"&gt;Sonia Landy Sheridan, "Generative Systems versus Copy Art: A Clarification of Terms and Ideas", in: ''[[Leonardo Journal|Leonardo]]'', Vol. 16, No. 2 (Spring, 1983), pp. 103-108. {{doi|10.2307/1574794}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her early work with copier and telematic art focused on the differences between the human hand and the algorithm.&lt;ref name="MF1"&gt;Flanagan, Mary. "An Appreciation on the Impact of the work of Sonia Landy Sheridan." The Art of Sonia Landy Sheridan. Hanover, NH: [[Hood Museum of Art]], 2009, pp. 37–42.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Aside from the ongoing work of Roman Verostko and his fellow algorists, the next known examples are [[fractal art]]works created in the mid to late 1980s. These are important here because they use a different means of execution. Whereas the earliest algorithmic art was "drawn" by a [[plotter]], [[fractal art]] simply creates an image in [[computer memory]]; it is therefore [[digital art]]. The native form of a [[fractal art]]work is an image stored on a [[computer]]&amp;nbsp;–this is also true of very nearly all equation art and of most recent algorithmic art in general. However, in a stricter sense "fractal art" is not considered algorithmic art, because the algorithm is not devised by the artist.&lt;ref name=UCSB/&gt;

In light of such ongoing developments, pioneer algorithmic artist [[Ernest Edmonds]] has documented the continuing prophetic role of art in human affairs by tracing the early 1960s association between art and the computer up to a present time in which the algorithm is now widely recognized as a key concept for society as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mdpi.com/2076-0752/7/1/3|author=Ernest Edmonds|date=15 January 2018|title=Algorithmic Art Machines|publisher=Arts|doi=10.3390/arts7010003|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==The role of the algorithm==
[[File:Judson Rosebush Visions 15101 Computer Art April 22, 1978 JGR19780422 100.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|''Letter Field'' by Judson Rosebush, 1978. [[Calcomp plotter]] computer output with liquid inks on rag paper, 15.25 x 21 inches. This image was created using an early version of what became [[Digital Effects]]' Vision software, in [[APL (programming language)|APL]] and [[Fortran]] on an [[IBM 370]]/158. A database of the Souvenir font; [[Statistical randomness|random number]] generation, a statistical basis to determine letter size, color, and position; and a hidden line algorithm combine to produce this scan line [[raster image]], output to a plotter.]]

From one point of view, for a work of art to be considered algorithmic art, its creation must include a process based on an [[algorithm]] devised by the artist. Here, an algorithm is simply a detailed recipe for the design and possibly execution of an artwork, which may include [[computer code]], [[function (mathematics)|functions]], [[expression (mathematics)|expressions]], or other input which ultimately determines the form the art will take.&lt;ref name=Verostko/&gt; This input may be [[mathematical]], [[computation]]al, or generative in nature. Inasmuch as algorithms tend to be [[deterministic]], meaning that their repeated execution would always result in the production of identical artworks, some external factor is usually introduced. This can either be a random number generator of some sort, or an external body of data (which can range from recorded heartbeats to frames of a movie.) Some artists also work with organically based gestural input which is then modified by an algorithm. By this definition, [[fractal]]s made by a fractal program are not art, as humans are not involved. However, defined differently, algorithmic art can be seen to include fractal art, as well as other varieties such as those using [[genetic algorithm]]s. The artist [[Kerry Mitchell]] stated in his 1999 ''Fractal Art Manifesto'':&lt;ref name=Mitchell2009&gt;{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=Kerry |title=Selected Works |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-QUyAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7 |date=24 July 2009| publisher=Lulu.com&lt;!--This book is published by the artist himself, and can be relied on only for his own point of view.--&gt;|isbn=978-0-557-08398-5|pages=7–8}} This artist is notable for his place in the Fractal Art movement, as is his opinion and manifesto.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UCSB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mitchell, Kerry |title=The Fractal Art Manifesto |url=https://www.fractalus.com/info/manifesto.htm |publisher=Fractalus.com |accessdate=27 December 2015 |date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Fractal Art is not..Computer(ized) Art, in the sense that the computer does all the work. The work is executed on a computer, but only at the direction of the artist. Turn a computer on and leave it alone for an hour. When you come back, no art will have been generated.&lt;ref name=Mitchell2009/&gt;}}

==Algorists==
"Algorist" is a term used for [[digital artist]]s who create algorithmic art.&lt;ref name=Verostko&gt;{{cite web |last1=Verostko |first1=Roman |title=Algorithmic Art |url=http://www.verostko.com/algorithm.html |date=1999 |origyear=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algorists formally began correspondence and establishing their identity as artists following a panel titled "Art and Algorithms" at [[SIGGRAPH]] in 1995. The co-founders were [[Jean-Pierre Hébert]] and [[Roman Verostko]]. Hébert is credited with coining the term and its definition, which is in the form of his own algorithm:&lt;ref name=Verostko/&gt;

 if (creation &amp;&amp; object of art &amp;&amp; algorithm &amp;&amp; one's own algorithm) {
      return * an algorist *
 } else {
      return * not an algorist *
 }

[[Cellular automata]] can be used to generate artistic patterns with an appearance of randomness, or to modify images such as photographs by applying a transformation such as the stepping stone rule (to give an impressionist style) repeatedly until the desired artistic effect is achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hoke |first1=Brian P. |title=Cellular Automata and Art |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/math5.pattern/FinalProject/Hoke.html |publisher=Dartmouth College |accessdate=24 December 2015 |date=21 August 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their use has also been explored in music.&lt;ref name="Burraston Edmonds 2005 pp. 165–185"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Burraston | first=Dave | last2=Edmonds | first2=Ernest | title=Cellular automata in generative electronic music and sonic art: a historical and technical review | journal=Digital Creativity | volume=16 | issue=3 | year=2005 | doi=10.1080/14626260500370882 | pages=165–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fractal art]] consists of varieties of computer-generated [[fractals]] with colouring chosen to give an attractive effect.&lt;ref name="fgad"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fractal geometry in architecture and design |last=Bovill |first=Carl |year=1996 |publisher=Birkhauser |location=Boston |isbn=0-8176-3795-8 |page=153 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w5ptaiGsac4C |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in the western world, it is not drawn or painted by hand. It is usually created indirectly with the assistance of [[fractal-generating software]], [[iteration|iterating]] through three phases: setting [[parameter]]s of appropriate fractal software; executing the possibly lengthy calculation; and evaluating the product. In some cases, other [[graphics software|graphics programs]] are used to further modify the images produced. This is called post-processing. Non-fractal imagery may also be integrated into the artwork.&lt;ref name="mra"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casperjournal.com/article_bbe58a64-0b86-5e64-8fc5-459eafbe67fb.html |title=Meet Reginald Atkins, mathematical artist |author=Conner, Elysia |date=25 February 2009 |publisher=CasperJournal.com |accessdate=28 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic or evolutionary art makes use of [[genetic algorithm]]s to develop images iteratively, selecting at each "generation" according to a rule defined by the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Eberle |first1=Robert |title=Evolutionary Art - Genetic Algorithm |url=http://www.saatchiart.com/art/New-Media-Evolutionary-Art-Genetic-Algorithm/57335/1837679/view |publisher=Saatchi Art |accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Reynolds |first1=Craig |title=Evolutionary Computation and its application to art and design |url=http://www.red3d.com/cwr/evolve.html |publisher=Reynolds engineering &amp; Design |accessdate=25 December 2015 |date=27 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algorithmic art is not only produced by computers. Wendy Chun explains:&lt;ref name=Chun2011/&gt;

{{quote|Software is unique in its status as metaphor for metaphor itself. As A universal imitator/machine, it encapsulates a logic of general substitutability ; a logic of ordering and creative, animating disordering. Joseph Weizenbaum has argued that computers have become metaphors for "effective procedures," that is, for anything that can be solved in a prescribed number of steps, such as gene expression and clerical work.&lt;ref name=Chun2011&gt;{{cite book |author=Chun, Wendy Hui Kyong |year=2011 |title=Programmed Visions: Software and Memory |page=2 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0262518512}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The American artist, [[Jack Ox]], has used algorithms to produce paintings that are [[music visualization|visualizations of music]] without using a computer. Two examples are ''visual performances'' of extant scores, such as [[Anton Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 8 (Bruckner)|Eighth Symphony]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Ox, Jack |year=1990 |url=https://www.academia.edu/35788162/The_Systematic_Translation_of_Anton_Bruckners_Eighth_Symphony_into_a_Series_of_Thirteen_Paintings |title=The Systematic Translation of Anton Bruckner's Eighth Symphony into a Series of Thirteen Paintings |conference=Bruckner Symposium 1990 |location=Linz, Austria}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://intermediaprojects.org/pages/Bruckner.html |title=Bruckner: Eighth Symphony visualized themes |publisher=Intermedia Projects |accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kurt Schwitters]]' ''Ursonate''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ox, Jack |year=1993 |title=Creating a Visual Translation of Kurt Schwitters' Ursonate |journal=Leonardo Music Journal |volume=3 |pages=59–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jackox.net/pages/Ursonate/UrPaintMv1.html&lt;/ref&gt; Later, she and her collaborator, Dave Britton, created the 21st Century Virtual Color Organ that does use computer coding and algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ox |first1=Jack |last2=Britton |first2=Dave |year=2000 |url=https://www.academia.edu/785266/The_21st_century_virtual_reality_color_organ |title=The 21st Century Virtual Reality Color Organ |journal=Journal of IEEE Computer Society |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30966">'''Arts and entertainment in India'''  have had their course shaped by a synthesis of indigenous and foreign influences that have consequently shaped the course of the arts of the rest of Asia,  since ancient times.  Arts refer to [[Indian art|paintings]], [[Indian architecture|architecture]], [[Indian literature|literature]], [[Music of India|music]], [[Indian classical dance|dance]], [[languages of India|languages]] and [[Cinema of India|cinema]]. In early India, most of the arts were derived [[Vedic civilization|Vedic]] influences. After the birth of contemporary [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Sikhism]] arts flourished under the patronage of kings and emperors. The coming of [[Islam]] spawned a whole new era of Indian architecture and art. Finally the British brought their own Gothic and Roman influences and fused it with the Indian style. They have a culture infusion in their art.

==Architecture==
{{Main|Architecture of India}}
{{Peacock|date=October 2009}}
[[File:Taj Mahal, Agra, India.jpg|thumb|The [[Taj Mahal]] in [[Agra]] is widely considered to be the best example of [[Indo-Islamic architecture]] and is one of the most well-known monuments in the world.]]
Indian architecture consists of production of the [[Indian subcontinent]] which encompasses a multitude of expressions over space and time, transformed by the forces of history considered unique to the sub-continent, sometimes destroying, but most of the time absorbing. The result is an evolving range of architectural production that nonetheless retains a certain amount of continuity across history.

The earliest production in the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] was characterised by well planned cities and houses where religion did not seem to play an active role. The Buddhist period is primarily represented by three important building types- the Chaitya Hall (place of worship), the [[Vihara]] (monastery) and the [[Stupa]] (hemispherical mound for worship/ memory) - exemplified by the extraordinary caves of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] and [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]] and the monumental [[Sanchi]] [[Stupa]]. The [[Jainism|Jaina]] temples are characterised by a richness of detail that can be seen in the [[Dilwara Temples]] in [[Mt.Abu]]. Early beginnings of Hindu temple architecture have been traced to the remains at [[Aihole]] and [[Pattadakal]] in present-day [[Karnataka]], and have [[Vedic altars]] and late Vedic temples as described by [[Pāṇini]] as models. Later, as more differentiation took place, the Dravidian/ Southern style and or the Indo-Aryan/ Northern/ Nagara style of temple architecture emerged as dominant modes, epitomized in productions such as the magnificent [[Brihadeeswara Temple]], [[Thanjavur]], and the [[Sun Temple]], [[Konark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/240|title=Khajuraho Group of Monuments|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/246|title=Sun Temple, Konârak|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the arrival of [[Islam]], a new style of architecture known as [[Indo-Islamic architecture]] emerged combining traditional Indian and Islamic elements. The earliest examples include the [[Qutb Minar complex|Qutb complex]], a series of monuments built by successive sultans of the [[Delhi Sultanate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/233|title=Qutb Minar and its Monuments, Delhi|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mughal architecture|architecture]] of the [[Mughal Empire]] includes the [[Red Fort]], [[Taj Mahal]], [[Agra Fort]], [[Humayun's Tomb|Humayun's tomb]], [[Jama Masjid, Delhi|Jama Masjid]] and [[Fatehpur Sikri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/232|title=Humayun's Tomb, Delhi|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/252|title=Taj Mahal|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With colonization, a new chapter began. Though the [[Netherlands|Dutch]], [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and the French made substantial forays, it was the English who had a lasting impact. The architecture of the colonial period varied from the beginning attempts at creating authority through classical prototypes to the later approach of producing a supposedly more responsive image through what is now termed [[Indo-Saracenic]] architecture- a mixture of Hindu, Islamic and Western elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/945|title=Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (formerly Victoria Terminus)|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the introduction of [[Modern Architecture]] into India and later with Independence, the quest was more towards progress as a paradigm fuelled by [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]]vian visions. The planning of [[Chandigarh]]- a city most architects hate/love- by [[Le Corbusier]] was considered a step towards this. Later as modernism exhausted itself in the West and new directions were sought for, in India too there was a search for a more meaningful architecture rooted in the Indian context. This direction called [[Critical Regionalism]] is exemplified in the works of architects such as [[B. V. Doshi]], [[Charles Correa]], etc. Apart from this, the advent of globalisation and economic development since the 90s, has spawned an impressive collection of modern IT campuses and skyscrapers, and as economic reform accelerates, metropolitan areas are gaining futuristic skylines.

==Literature==
{{Main|Indian literature}}
[[Image:Rabindranath Tagore in 1909.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Rabindranath Tagore]] won the [[Nobel prize]] for literature. It is the first Nobel prize won by Asia.]]
Indian literature is generally acknowledged, but not wholly established, as the oldest in the world. India has 22 officially recognized [[Languages of India|languages]], and a huge variety of literature has been produced in these languages over the years. In Indian literature, [[Oral literature|oral]] and written forms are both important. [[Hindu]] literary traditions dominate a large part of Indian culture. Apart from the [[Vedas]] which are a sacred form of knowledge, there are other works such as the Hindu epics ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]'', treatises such as [[Vaastu Shastra]] in architecture and town planning, and [[Arthashastra]] in political science. Devotional Hindu drama, poetry and songs span the subcontinent. Among the best known are the works of [[Kalidasa]] (writer of the famed Sanskrit play [[Shakuntala]]) and [[Tulsidas]] (who wrote an epic Hindi poem based on the Ramayana, called [[Raamcharitmaanas]]).

[[Tamil language|Tamil]] literature has been in existence for more than 2500 years. [[Tolkaappiyam]] has been credited as its oldest work, whereas the exact origins of [[Thirukkural]] is unknown. The golden age of Tamil literature was during the [[Sangam period]], roughly 1800 years ago. The classic works of this period are [[Cilappatikaram]], [[Manimekalai]], and Sivakasinthamani. Tamil literature is known for its secular traditions, although its authors had strong religious beliefs. [[Thirukkural]] is considered to be the greatest of Tamil works. [[Kannada]] literature is probably the third oldest in Indian literature next to [[Sanskrit literature]] and [[Tamil literature]]. The earliest reported work in Kannada literature dates back to the fifth century. The first available literary in Kannada is [[Kavirajamarga]], written in the eighth century by Amoghavarsha Nrpatunga. [[Hindi literature]] started as religious and philosophical poetry in medieval periods in dialects like [[Avadhi]] and [[Brij]]. The most famous figures from this period are [[Kabir]] and [[Tulsidas]]. In modern times, the ''Khadi'' dialect became more prominent and a variety of literature was produced in [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]].

The most renowned Bengali writer is Nobel laureate [[Rabindranath Tagore]], who received the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. In the last century, several Indian writers have distinguished themselves not only in traditional [[Languages of India|Indian languages]] but also in English. India's only native-born Nobel laureate in literature was the [[Bengal]]i writer [[Rabindranath Tagore]], but VS Naipaul, a diaspora Indian novelist born in Trinidad, also won the Nobel in 2001. Other major writers who are either Indian or of Indian origin and derive much inspiration from Indian themes are [[R. K. Narayan]], [[Vikram Seth]], [[Salman Rushdie]], [[Arundhati Roy]], [[Raja Rao]], [[Amitav Ghosh]], [[Vikram Chandra (novelist)|Vikram Chandra]], [[Mukul Kesavan]], [[Shashi Tharoor]], [[Nayantara Sehgal]], [[Anita Desai]], [[Ashok Banker]], [[Shashi Deshpande]], [[Jhumpa Lahiri]], and [[Bharati Mukherjee]].

==Music==
{{Main|Music of India}}
Indian music includes multiple varieties of [[folk music|folk]], [[popular music|popular]], [[pop music|pop]], and [[Indian classical music|classical music]]. India's classical music tradition, including [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] and [[Hindustani music]], has a history spanning millennia and, developed over several eras, remains fundamental to the lives of Indians today as sources of religious inspiration, cultural expression and pure entertainment. India is made up of several dozen [[ethnic group]]s, speaking their own [[language]]s and [[dialect]]s. Alongside distinctly [[Indian subcontinent|subcontinental]] forms there are major influences from [[Persian traditional music|Persian]], [[Arab music|Arab]] and [[Music of the United Kingdom|British music]]. Indian genres like [[filmi]] and [[Bhangra (music)|bhangra]] have become popular throughout the United Kingdom, [[South Asia|South]] and [[East Asia]], and around the world.

Indian stars now sell records in many countries, while [[world music]] fans listen to the roots music of India's diverse nations. American [[soul music|soul]], [[rock and roll|rock]] and [[hip hop music]] have also made a large impact, primarily on Indian pop and filmi music. Other highly popular forms are [[ghazal]], [[qawwali]], [[thumri]], [[dhrupad]], [[dadra]], [[bhajan]], [[kirtan]], [[Shabda|shabad]], and [[gurbani]].

[[Filmi]] music is often said to have begun in 1931, with the release of Ardeshir M. Irani's [[Alam Ara]] and its popular soundtrack. In the earliest years of the Indian cinema, filming was generally Indian (classical and folk) in inspiration, with some Western elements. Over the years, the Western elements have increased, but without completely destroying the Indian flavour.  Most of the Indian movies are musicals and feature elaborate song and dance numbers.  There is constant work for pop music composers — or music directors, to use the Indian term.  Movie soundtracks are released as tapes and CDs, sometimes even before the movie is released.

==Dance==
{{Main|Indian classical dance|Indian folk dances}}
Indian classical dance is performed in different styles. Its theory can be traced back to the [[Natya Shastra]] of [[Bharata Muni]], a sage from Tamil Nadu (400 BC). The Natya Shastra is the most important ancient treatise on [[classical Indian dance]]. It is also called the fifth [[Veda]] in reference to the foundation of Hindu religion and philosophy, from which sprang the related South Indian musical tradition of [[Carnatic music]]. Its various current forms include [[Bharatanatyam]], [[Odissi]], [[Manipuri dance|Manipuri]], [[Kathakali]], [[Kuchipudi]], [[Mohiniaattam]], [[Kathak]] and [[Sattriya dance|Sattriya]].

'''Bharatanatyam''' is a classical [[dance]] form originating in [[Tamil Nadu]]. It is thought to have been created by Bharata Muni. In ancient times Bharatanatyam was performed by [[mandir]] (Hindu temple) [[Devadasi]]s. Many of the ancient sculptures in Hindu temples are based on Bharatanatyam dance postures [[karana dance|karana]]s.

'''Odissi''' is one of the oldest surviving forms of dance, with depictions of Odissi dancing dating back as far as the 1st century BC. Like other forms of Indian classical dance, the Odissi style traces its origins back to antiquity. Dancers are found depicted in bas-relief in the hills of Udaygiri (near [[Bhubaneswar]]) dating back to the 1st century BC. The [[Natya Shastra]] speaks of the dance from this region and refers to it as Odra-Magadhi.

'''Kathakali''' (''katha'' for [[Narrative|story]], ''kali'' for [[performance]] or [[Play (theatre)|play]]) is a form of dance-[[drama]]. It originated in the [[South India]]n state of [[Kerala]] over 500 years ago. It is a spectacular combination of drama, dance, music and ritual. Characters with vividly painted faces and elaborate costumes re-enact stories from the [[Hindu]] epics, [[Mahabharata]] and [[Ramayana]].

'''Kuchipudi''' is a classical dance form from [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Telangana]], a state of [[South India]]. Kuchipudi is the name of a small village in the Divi Taluq of [[Krishna district]] that borders the [[Bay of Bengal]] and with resident [[Brahmin]]s practising this traditional dance form, it acquired the present name.

'''Mohiniaattam''' is a traditional dance from the South Indian state of Kerala. [[Mohini]] is an [[Apsaras]] in the Hindu mythology and aattam in [[Malayalam]] means dance. So Mohiniaattam essentially means "dance of the enchantress". The theme of Mohiniaattam is love and devotion to god. The costume worn by the dancers are typically white coloured kasavu [[saree]] with golden borders.

The '''Kathak''' dance form arose from the [[Vaishnava]] devotees dancing to the episodes from [[Krishna]]'s life. Originally a Northern Indian temple dance, it was transformed to a court dance in the [[Mughal era]]. The new Muslim influence brought with it certain changes to the dance form: what had been a largely devotional practice now became more a courtly entertainment.

The '''Sattriya''' dance is believed to be a creation of the great [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavite]] ([[bhakti]]) guru [[Srimanta Sankardeva]] considered the lead architect of Assamese [[literature]] and [[culture]]. He created this magnificent Sattriya dance to accompany the ''Ankiya Naat'' (a form of Assamese one-act play, another creation of Sankardeva) which was usually performed in ''Satras'' (Assamese monasteries). Since the dance developed and grew within the ''Satras'', it is named after these religious institutions.

'''Folk dances''' are performed for every possible occasion, to celebrate the arrival of seasons, birth of a child, a wedding and festivals. The dances are very focused on gestures, postures, and expressions. The dances burst with verve and vitality. Men and women perform some dances exclusively, while in some performances men and women dance together. On most occasions artists sing the main lyrics and are accompanied by instruments. Each form of dance has a specific costume. Most costumes are flamboyant with extensive jewels.

'''Bhangra''' is a form of music and dance that originated in the [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] region of [[India]]. [[Bhangra (dance)|Bhangra]] dance began as a folk dance conducted by [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] farmers to celebrate the coming of [[Vaisakhi]], a [[sikh]] festival. The specific moves reflect the manner in which villagers farmed their land. This musical art further became synthesized after the partition of India, when refugees from different parts of the Punjab shared their folk dances with individuals who resided in the regions they settled in. This hybrid dance became Bhangra. The dance started from just one move and evolved later on. It has been popularized by Punjabi artists from the [[Sikh]] communities, with which it is now commonly associated.[1] Today, [[Bhangra (dance)|Bhangra]] dance survives in different forms and styles all over the globe – including pop music, film soundtracks, collegiate competitions and even talent shows.

'''Thirayattam''' is a ritual performing  dance  of south malabar region (kozhikode and malappuram Dt:) in [[Kerala]] state.In [[Malayalam]] language, the word "Thirayattam" refers to a 'colourful dance'  This vibrant Ethnic art form blend of dance,instrumental music, drama, facial and body makeup, martial art and ritualistic  Function. [[Thirayattam]] enacted in courtyards of sacred groves and village shrines, during Thirayattam festival.&lt;ref&gt; "Thirayattam" ( Folklore Text- malayalam, Moorkkanad peethambaran),State Institute of language, Kerala. {{ISBN|978-81-200-4294-0}} &lt;/ref&gt;

== Sculpture ==
{{main|Sculpture in India}}
 first sculptures in India date back to the [[Indus Valley civilization]], where stone and bronze carvings have been discovered. This is one of the earliest instances of sculpture in the world. Later, as [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] developed further, India produced some of the most intricate bronzes in the world, as well as unriveled temple carvings. Some huge shrines, such as the one at [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]] were not actually constructed using blocks, but instead carved out of solid rock, making them perhaps the largest and most intricate sculptures in the world.

During the 2nd to 1st century BCE in far northern India, in what is now southern [[Afghanistan]] and northern Pakistan, sculptures became more explicit, representing episodes of the Buddha's life and teachings. Although India had a long sculptural tradition and a mastery of rich iconography, the Buddha was never represented in human form before this time, but only through some of his symbols. This may be because [[Gandhara]]n Buddhist sculpture in modern Afghanistan displays [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Persia]]n artistic influence. Artistically, the Gandharan school of sculpture is said to have contributed wavy hair, drapery covering both shoulders, shoes and sandals, acanthus leaf decorations, etc.

The pink sandstone sculptures of Mathura evolved during the Gupta period (4th to 6th century) to reach a very high fineness of execution and delicacy in the modeling. Newer sculptures in [[Afghanistan]], in stucco, schist or clay, display very strong blending of Indian post-Gupta mannerism and Classical influence, Hellenistic or possibly even Greco-Roman. Meanwhile, elsewhere in India, less anatomically accurate styles of human representation evolved, leading to the classical art that the world is now familiar with, and contributing to Buddhist and Hindu sculpture throughout Asia.

== Painting ==
{{Main|Indian painting}}
The earliest Indian paintings were the rock paintings of [[pre-historic]] times, the [[petroglyph]]s as found in places like [[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], and some of them are older than 5500 BC. Such works continued and after several millennia, in the 7th century, carved pillars of [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]], [[Maharashtra]] [[States and territories of India|state]] present an example of Indian paintings, and the colors, mostly various shades of red and orange, were derived from minerals. Thereafter, frescoes of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] and Ellora caves appeared. India's [[Buddhist]] literature is replete with examples of texts which describe that palaces of kings and aristocratic class were embellished with paintings, but they have not survived. But, it is believed that some form of art painting was practiced in that time.

Indian Art was given a new lease of life by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in early 19th century when the new [[government]] required painters to document Indian life and times. The English School paintings, as these new art were called had seen the emergence of India's greatest artists of all times [[Raja Ravi Verma]]. Other important artists of the Colonial period include [[Jamini Roy]], Amrita Shergil, Ramkinker Baij and [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. After independence, Indian art became more diverse and artists like [[Maqbool Fida Hussain]], Francis Newton Souza, [[Subodh Gupta]], [[Devajyoti Ray]], Sudip Roy,&lt;ref name=dna12&gt;{{cite news |title=Florence Biennale: Sudip Roy wins award for Christ, Gandhi, Teresa-Trilogy |url=http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/plumage/florence-biennale-sudip-roy-s-wins-award-for-for-christ-gandhi-teresa-trilogy |publisher=[[The Times of India]] |date=Dec 27, 2011 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paresh Maity]] and Bose Krishnamachari earned international recognition.

==Cinema==
{{Peacock|date=October 2009}}
{{Main|Cinema of India}}
India is a major regional center for [[film|cinema]]. The Indian film industry is the second largest in the world (1200 movies released in the year 2002). Each of the larger jrods supports its own film industry: [[Hindi]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]]. The Hindi/Urdu film industry, based in [[Mumbai]], formerly ''Bombay'', is called [[Bollywood]] (a melding of [[Hollywood]] and Bombay). Similar neologisms have been coined for the Kannada (Karnataka State) film industry ([[Sandalwood]]) based on Karnataka being known for Sandalwood, Tamil film industry ([[Kollywood]], from the Kodambakkam district of [[Chennai]]) and the Telugu film industry ([[Cinema of Andhra Pradesh|Tollywood]]). Tollygunge is a [[metonym]] for the Bengali film industry, long centered in the Tollygunge district of [[Kolkata]]. The Bengali language industry is notable as having nurtured the director [[Satyajit Ray]], an internationally renowned filmmaker and a winner of many awards, among them the yo yorat Ratna (India's highest civilian award), the [[Légion d'honneur]] (France), and the Lifetime achievement [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]. The Bollywood industry is usually the largest in terms of films produced and box office receipts, just as Urdu/Hindi speakers outnumber speakers of other Indian languages within India. (Tollywood is close on Bollywood's heels, and sometimes will turn out more films in a year.)

== Radio ==
Radio broadcasting was, until recently a government monopoly under the Directorate General of [[All India Radio]]—established in 1936 and since 1957 also known as Akashvani—a government-owned, semicommercial operation of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. From only six stations at the time of independence, All India Radio's network had expanded by the mid-1990s to 146 AM stations plus a National Channel, the Integrated North-East Service (aimed at tribal groups in northeast India), and the External Service. There are five regional headquarters for All India Radio: the North Zone in New Delhi; the North-East Zone in Guwahati, Assam; the East Zone in Calcutta; the West Zone in Bombay; and the South Zone in Madras. All India Radio covers 99.37% of India's populace.

The government-owned network provides both national and local programs in Hindi, English, and sixteen regional languages. Commercial services, which were inaugurated in 1957, are provided by [[Vividh Bharati]] Service, headquartered in [[Mumbai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/go-gaga-with-vividh-bharatis-golden-year/49854-8.html|title=Go gaga with Vividh Bharati's golden year|date=Oct 3, 2007|publisher=CNN-IBN}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vividh Bharati]], which accepts advertisements, broadcasts from thirty-one AM and FM stations in the mid-1990s.

India has an extensive network of medium wave and shortwave stations. In 1994 there were eighty-five FM stations and seventy-three shortwave stations that covered the entire country. The broadcasting equipment is mostly Indian made and reaches special audiences, such as farmers needing agroclimatic, plant protection, and other agriculture-related information. The number of radio receivers increased almost fivefold between 1970 and 1994, from around 14 million to nearly 65 million. Most radios are also produced within India.

The foreign broadcast service is a function of the External Services Division of All India Radio. In 1994 seventy hours of news, features, and entertainment programs were broadcast daily in twenty-five languages using thirty-two shortwave transmitters. The principal target audiences are listeners in neighbouring countries and the large overseas Indian community.

Satellite Radio was introduced to the Indian market in 2000 by [[WorldSpace]], a Washington-DC based company. Currently WorldSpace beams 30 channels comprising music, news, and regional channels, a subscriber in India pays {{Indian Rupee}} 1,200 per annum. In addition, some premium channels are available at an extra cost. This service requires special receivers which are often subsidized by world space.

Recently The Department of Space (DoS) indicated it is exploring the possibility of setting up a multi-media satellite platform that would include satellite radio, video and data channels.

== Television ==
{{Main|Television in India}}
Television service is available throughout the country. [[Doordarshan]] is a government-owned broadcaster established in 1959 and a part of All India Radio until 1976. It operates of one national network and seven regional networks. In 1992 there were sixty-three high-power television transmitters, 369 medium-power transmitters, seventy-six low-power transmitters, and twenty-three transposers. Regular satellite transmissions began in 1982 (the same year colour transmission began).
By 1994 some 6 million people were receiving television broadcasts via satellite, and the number was expected to increase rapidly throughout the rest of the decade. Cable television was even more prolific, with an estimated 12 to 15 million subscribers in 1994. Besides Doordarshan, [[Zee TV]]—an independent station broadcasting from Mumbai since 1992—uses satellite transmissions. In fact, because Doordarshan is the only network that is permitted to broadcast television signals domestically, [[Zee TV]] and other entrepreneurs broadcast their Indian-made videotapes via foreign transmitters. Other networks joining the fray are [[Cable News Network]] (1990); Asia Television Network (1991); Hong Kong-based [[STAR TV (Asia)|Star TV]] (1991); Jain TV, near Bombay (1994); EL TV, a spin-off of Zee TV in Bombay (1994); HTV, an affiliate of the [[Hindustan Times]] in New Delhi (1994); and [[Sun TV (India)|Sun TV]], a [[Tamil language]] service in Chennai (1994). In a communications breakthrough in July 1995, Doordarshan agreed, for a US$1.5 million annual fee and 50 percent of advertising revenue when it exceeds US$1.5 million, to allow CNN to broadcast twenty-four hours a day via an Indian satellite. regional, and local service. The number of television sets increased from around 500,000 in 1976 to 9 million in early 1987 and to around 47 million in 1994; increases are expected to continue at around 6 million sets per year. More than 75 percent of television sets were black and white models in 1992, but the proportion of colour sets is increasing annually. Most television sets are produced in India.

Cavender]], who compiled the work under the [[anagrammatic]] [[pen name]] of '''H.C. Decanver'''.&lt;ref name="Catalogue of Works in Refutation of Methodism: Reference 1"/&gt;

A [[reference work]] of [[religious criticism]], the ''Catalogue'' is Decanver's debut publication, and his only written work. It is notable as one of the most prominent writings critical of [[Methodist]] doctrine ever written, and remains the only compilation of books written from a primarily anti-Methodist perspective.

== Background ==

An otherwise virtually unknown individual, the only evidence which suggests that the author Decanver ever existed was the publication of his ''Catalogue'' in 1846. He was self-evidently opposed to the doctrines of [[Methodism]], a branch of [[Protestant Christianity]] which emerged from the teachings of [[John Wesley]] in 18th century England, and in 1846 compiled the catalogue under the full [[title]] of '''''Catalogue of Works in Refutation of Methodism: from its Origin in 1729, to the Present Time: of Those by Methodist Authors on Lay-Representation, Methodist Episcopacy, Etc., Etc., and of the Political Pamphlets Relating to Wesley's "Calm Address to Our American Colonies"'''''.&lt;ref name="Catalogue of Works in Refutation of Methodism: Reference 1"/&gt; The pseudonym "H.C. Decanver" is an anagram of the author's actual name, Curtis H. Cavender.

The book was first published in both hardback and paperback by the presently-defunct [[John Penington (publisher)|John Penington]] publishing company, once located on 10 South Fifth Street in eastern [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name="Catalogue of Works in Refutation of Methodism: Reference 3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.hsp.org/collections/manuscripts/p/penington1435.htm |title=Penington Family Papers, The Historical Society of Pennsylvania |first= |last= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |month= |year= |work= |publisher=The Historical Society of Pennsylvania |location=Philadelphia |page= |pages= |at= |trans-title=|doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=3 April 2010 |quote=The eldest of the children of Edward and Sarah Shoemaker Penington, John, devoted his professional life to the literary pursuits his father favored. Born on August 1, 1799, John Penington was the proprietor of a well-known Philadelphia bookshop at '''10 South Fifth Street''', specializing in international trade, rare books, and classical texts both in their original languages and in translation. |ref= |separator= |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original printings were attributed to an individual "C. Sherman, printer" from 19 St. James Street in the same city.&lt;ref name="Catalogue of Works in Refutation of Methodism: Reference 1"/&gt;

There are several editions of the book, some including minor changes deviating from former editions.

The catalogue as a whole lists over 100 individual documents, books, pamphlets and articles — many of which today are regarded as historical texts. As a whole the works listed assumedly refute certain doctrines of Methodist thought, although – if somewhat ironically – many of them are by Methodist authors themselves.

== Contents ==

The book is divided into two sections, the first being a [[preface]]                    entitled either "Prefatory Remarks" or "Preliminary Remarks", depending upon the edition of the book (the first edition of the work was printed containing the latter title), and the second being the catalogue proper – in all editions simply deemed "Catalogue". The Catalogue section is itself divided further, the first group of works representing those called "Anti-Methodistical", the second group listed under "Methodist Authors" (being by Methodist authors themselves), the third called "Miscellaneous", and the last group listed as "Political".

'''Marc Gabriel Charles Gleyre''' (2 May 1806 – 5 May 1874), was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] artist who was a resident in [[France]] from an early age. He took over the studio of [[Paul Delaroche]] in 1843 and taught a number of younger artists who became prominent, including [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Alfred Sisley]], [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]],&lt;ref name=whistler&gt;{{cite web|title=Marc-Charles-Gabriel Gleyre, 1806-1874|url=http://www.whistler.arts.gla.ac.uk/correspondence/people/biog/?bid=Gley_GC&amp;initial=G|website=The Correspondence of James McNeill Whistler|publisher=University of Glasgow|accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Auguste Toulmouche]], [[Louis-Frederic Schützenberger]], and Henry-Lionel Brioux.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?pg=RA1-PA103&amp;lpg=RA1-PA103&amp;dq=Henri+Lionel+Brioux&amp;sig=FPkB8MeKsXflEBrdOl5tKvLqBDE&amp;id=wvkGAAAAQAAJ&amp;ots=OpCR-E5z8O&amp;output=text&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Gleyre was born in Chevilly, near Lausanne.&lt;ref name=orient&gt;{{cite book|title=The Orientalists: European painters in North Africa and the Near East|editor=Stevens, Mary Anne|publisher=Royal Academy of Arts|type=Exhibition Catalogue|year=1984|isbn=|pages=150, 178–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents died when he was eight or nine years old, and he was brought up by an uncle in [[Lyon, France]], who sent him to the city's industrial school.&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt; He began his formal artistic education in Lyon under [[Jean-Claude Bonnefond|Bonnefond]], before moving to Paris, where he enrolled at the École des Beaux-Arts under [[Louis Hersent|Hersent]]. He also attended the Academie Suisse and studied watercolour technique in the studio of [[Richard Parkes Bonington]].&lt;ref name=orient/&gt; He then went to Italy, where he became acquainted with [[Horace Vernet]] and [[Louis Léopold Robert]].&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt; 
[[File:Charles Gleyre Cléonis et Cydippe.jpg|thumb|349x349px|''Cléonis Et Cydippe'', 1843]]
It was through Vernet's recommendation that he  was chosen by the American traveller [[John Lowell, Jr. (philanthropist)|John Lowell Jr.]] to accompany him on his journeys round the eastern Mediterranean, recording the scenes and ethnographic subjects they met with.  They left Italy in spring 1834 and visited Greece, Turkey and Egypt, where they remained together until November 1835, when Lowell left for India. Gleyre continued his travels around Egypt and Syria, not returning to France until 1838.&lt;ref name=orient/&gt; He returned to Lyons in shattered health,  having been attacked with [[List of eye diseases and disorders|ophthalmia]], or inflammation of the eye, in Cairo, and  struck down by fever in [[Lebanon]]. &lt;ref name=eb1911&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica 1911''&lt;/ref&gt;

On his recovery he proceeded to Paris, and, establishing a modest studio in the rue de Université, began carefully to work out the ideas which had been slowly shaping themselves in his mind. Mention is made of two decorative panels ''Diana leaving the Bath'', and a ''Young Nubian'' as almost the first fruits of his genius; but these did not attract public attention until much later, and the painting by which he practically opened his artistic career was the ''Apocalyptic Vision of St John'', sent to the [[Paris Salon|Salon]] of 1840.&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt;This was followed in 1843 by ''Evening'', which received a medal of the second class, and afterwards became widely popular under the title ''[[Lost Illusions (painting)|Lost Illusions]]''. It depicts a poet seated on the bank of a river, with his head drooping and a wearied posture, letting his [[lyre]] slip from a careless hand, and gazing sadly at a bright company of maidens whose song is slowly dying from his ear as their boat is borne slowly from his sight.&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt;
[[File:Charles Gleyre La Danse des bacchantes.jpg|left|thumb|475x475px|''La Danse des bacchantes'', 1849]]
In spite of the success of these first ventures, Gleyre retired from public competition, and spent the rest of his life in quiet devotion to his artistic ideals, neither seeking the easy applause of the crowd, nor turning his art into a means of aggrandizement and wealth. After 1845, when he exhibited the ''Separation of the Apostles'', he contributed nothing to the Salon except the ''Dance of the Bacchantes'' in 1849. Yet he worked steadily and was productive. He had an "infinite capacity of taking pains", and when asked by what method he attained to such marvelous perfection of workmanship, he would reply, "En y pensant toujours".&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt; Many years often intervened between the first conception of a piece and its embodiment, and years not infrequently between the first and the final stage of the embodiment itself. A landscape was apparently finished; even his fellow artists would consider it done; Gleyre alone was conscious that he had not "found his sky".&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt;

Gleyre became influential as a teacher, taking over the studio of studio of [[Paul Delaroche]] – then the leading private teaching atelier in Paris –  in 1843.&lt;ref name=orient/&gt; His students included [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]], [[Jean-Louis Hamon]], [[Auguste Toulmouche]], Whistler and several of the Impressionists: Monet, Renoir, Sisley, and [[Frédéric Bazille| Bazille]].&lt;ref name=orient/&gt; He did not charge his students a fee, although he expected them to contribute towards the rent and the payment of models. They were also given a say in the running of the school.&lt;ref name=whistler/&gt;
[[File:Charles Gleyre 002.jpg|thumb|340x340px|''Sappho'', 1867]]
Though he lived in almost complete retirement from public life, he took a keen interest in politics, and was a voracious reader of political journals. For a time, under [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis Philippe]], his studio had been the rendezvous of a sort of liberal club. To the last—amid all the disasters that befell his country—he was hopeful of the future, "la raison finira bien par avoir raison". It was while on a visit to the Retrospective Exhibition, opened on behalf of the exiles from [[Alsace-Lorraine|Alsace and Lorraine]], that he died suddenly on 5 May 1874.&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt;  He had never married.&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt;

He left unfinished the ''Earthly Paradise'',  a picture, which [[Hippolyte Adolphe Taine|Taine]] described as "a dream of innocence, of happiness and of beauty—[[Adam and Eve]] standing in the sublime and joyous landscape of a paradise enclosed in mountains",&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt;  a worthy counterpart to the ''Evening''.  His other works include ''Deluge'', which represents two angels speeding above the desolate earth from which the destroying waters have just begun to retire, leaving visible behind them the ruin they have wrought; the ''Battle of the Lemanus'', a piece of elaborate design, crowded but not encumbered with figures, and giving fine expression to the movements of the various bands of combatants and fugitives; the ''Prodigal Son'', in which the artist has ventured to add to the parable the new element of mother's love, greeting the repentant youth with a welcome that shows that the mother's heart thinks less of the repentance than of the return; ''Ruth and Boaz''; ''Ulysses and Nausicaa''; ''Hercules at the Feet of Omphale''; the ''Young Athenian,'' or, as it is popularly called, ''Sappho''; ''Minerva and the Nymphs''; ''Venus and Adonis''; ''Daphnis and Chloë''; and ''Love and the Parcae''. He also left a considerable number of drawings and watercolours, and  a number of portraits, among which is the sad face of [[Heinrich Heine]], engraved in the ''Revue des deux mondes'' for April 1852. In Clement's catalogue of his works there are 683 entries, including sketches and studies.&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt;

'''Claire Louise van Kampen''' (born November 9 1953) is an English director, composer and playwright. She composed the music for [[Mark Rylance]]'s 1989 performance as [[Hamlet]] and shared the 2007 [[Sam Wanamaker Award]] with him. Her composing credits include music for productions of the plays ''[[Days and Nights]]'' and ''[[Boeing-Boeing (play)|Boeing-Boeing]]''.

In 2015, she was historical music advisor and arranger of Tudor music on the BBC TV series ''[[Wolf Hall (TV series)|Wolf Hall]]''.

==Early life==
Van Kampen was born in Marylebone, London, England. She originally trained as a pianist at the [[Royal College of Music]] for five years, becoming the recipient of a John Land scholarship. As a girl she met [[David Munrow]], a recorder player and pioneer of the early-music scene in England, and became interested in [[Renaissance music]].&lt;ref name="Is This a Sackbut I Hear Before Me"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/30/arts/music/shakespeare-brings-period-music-to-broadway.html| title=Is This a Sackbut I Hear Before Me | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=29 November 2013 | accessdate=23 February 2015 | author=Cooper, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studying music theory with Dr [[Ruth Gipps]], she also specialised in the performance of 20th century music, premiering many works by today's leading composers.

==Career==
In 1986, she joined the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]], and the [[Royal National Theatre]], the first female musical director with both companies. In 1990, she co-founded the theatre company Phoebus Cart with her husband Mark Rylance.

Since the opening of the [[Shakespeare's Globe Theatre]] in 1997, van Kampen has been the Director of Theatre Music, creating both period and contemporary music for 30 of the Globe's productions – including the 'jazz' ''[[Macbeth]]'' in 2001, and ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' in 2002, which contained a 30-minute opera ''Cupid and Psyche''.

In spring 2007, she received the Vero Nihil Verius award for Distinguished Achievement in the Arts, conferred upon her by [[Concordia University (Oregon)|Concordia University]] in Oregon, United States. Together with Mark Rylance and [[Jenny Tiramani]], she received the 2007 [[Sam Wanamaker]] Award for the founding work during the opening ten years at Shakespeare's Globe Theatre.

''Farinelli and the King'' is van Kampen's historical play about the relationship between [[Farinelli]], the [[castrato]], and the Spanish King [[Philip V of Spain|Philippe V]], first performed at [[Sam Wanamaker Playhouse]] in February and March 2015, and at the [[Duke of York's Theatre]] in the West End, London from September to December 2015, with Mark Rylance as Philippe V. it received six Olivier Award nominations including Best Play. In 2016 she directed Mark Rylance in [[Nice Fish]] at the [[St. Ann's Warehouse]], New York. The production subsequently transferred to the [[Harold Pinter Theatre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rickwald |first=Bethany |date=20 January 2016 |title=St. Ann's Warehouse Extends Nice Fish and A Streetcar Named Desire |url=http://www.theatermania.com/off-broadway/news/nice-fish-starring-mark-rylance-extends_75649.html |access-date=30 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Longman |first=Will |date=16 September 2016 |title=Mark Rylance's Nice Fish extends by three weeks |url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/london-theatre/news/mark-rylance-nice-fish-extends_41796.html |access-date=30 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Van Kampen was previously married to an architect, Chris van Kampen, with whom she had two daughters, the actress [[Juliet Rylance]] and the late filmmaker [[Nataasha van Kampen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gurewitsch|first1=Matthew|title=A Bridge of Two: In the Wings with Christian Camargo and Juliet Rylance|url=http://www.beyondcriticism.com/2010/01/christian-camargo-juliet-rylance}}&lt;/ref&gt; She met [[Mark Rylance]] in 1987, and they married in [[Oxfordshire]] on 21 December 1989.&lt;ref name="Play On"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/11/18/play-on | title=Play On | work=[[The New Yorker]] | date=18 November 2013 | accessdate=22 January 2015 | author=Schulman, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her daughter Nataasha died of a suspected brain haemorrhage on a flight from New York in July 2012 at the age of 28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thestage.co.uk/people/obituaries/2012/08/nataasha-van-kampen |title=Nataasha van Kampen |author=Baker, Richard Anthony |work=[[The Stage]]|date=1 August 2012|accessdate= 23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''condolence book''' or '''book of condolence''' is a book in which people may record their [[condolence]]s after a [[death]] or great [[Tragedy (event)|tragedy]].

After the death of a leading figure or great disaster, condolence books are placed in public places for members of the general public to use.  When closed, the books are given to the relatives of the deceased or archived.  Reviewing a condolence book may help grieving relatives come to terms with the reality of their loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Helping grieving people when tears are not enough: a handbook for care providers |author=John Shep Jeffreys |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KJJeJv565ScC&amp;pg=PA236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After especially notable deaths, official records of the condolences may be compiled and reprinted.  For example, after the assassination of [[Abraham Lincoln]], the Government Printing Office published a leather-bound, gilt-edged collection of official condolences in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uRdfSQHLaPoC&amp;pg=PA67 |title=When the bells tolled for Lincoln: Southern reaction to the assassination |author=Carolyn Lawton Harrell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital condolence books are now placed on the Internet so people may write their thoughts on-line.

'''''Contemporary''''' was a monthly [[visual arts]] magazine based in [[London]]. Founded and edited as ''The Green Book'' by Keith Spencer as a quarterly publication, it re-emerged under the title ''Contemporary Art'' in 1993. On the death of Spencer, the title was acquired by [[Gordon and Breach]] Publishing (G+B), and produced four issues under the editorship of Lynne Green, Spencer's  deputy.

The magazine finally found its feet as a committed contemporary art publication in 1996 under the editorial control of Keith Patrick and with the change of title to '''''Contemporary Visual Arts''''', later abbreviated to '''''CVA'''''. During this period the magazine achieved sales of nearly 20,000, including 5,000 subscribers, with distribution mainly in the UK, Europe, the States and Australia. Its base at this time was the former [[Peek Freans]] biscuit factory in [[Bermondsey]], [[London]], the site of several key early exhibitions of the [[YBA]] generation.

With the collapse of the G+B parent company in 2001, the title was acquired by [[Art:21]] and reappeared as ''Contemporary'' in January 2002 although no longer with an exclusive commitment to the visual arts. In 2003 a sister publication, ''Contemporary 21'', was launched. Initially media-focused, with special issues dedicated to painting, sculpture, video art and performance, it would later embrace a wider range of topics, from art collecting to the relationship between visual art and architecture. In 2006 ''Contemporary'' published its first Annual, featuring 50 emerging artists nominated by its network of world correspondents. In 2008 the magazine relocated to [[Panama City]], where it ceased publication after failing in an attempt to start a Spanish-language edition. 

In May 2009, it was reported that the publisher, Brian Muller, had not paid the magazine's contributing writers for over a year.&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/news/artnetnews/artnetnews5-19-09.asp "''Contemporary'' Mag vs. its Writers"], ''Artnet News'', 19 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Phisicke Against Fortune 1579.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt; ''Phisicke Against Fortune'' &lt;br /&gt;book cover of 1579 ]]
'''''De remediis utriusque fortunae''''' is a collection of 254 [[Latin]] [[dialogues]] written by the humanist [[Francesco Petrarca]] (1304-1374), commonly known as [[Petrarch]].

The dialogues, completed towards the end of Petrarch's life, are treasure-chests of wisdom and humour which have not lost their relevance despite the passing of six centuries. They display remarkably lucid ideas that are cogently expressed. Drawing on classical sources, Petrarch expounded on refinement in taste and intellect, on finesse and propriety in speech and style.

The writing is a bouquet of moral philosophy, set out to show how thought and deed can generate happiness on the one hand, or sorrow and disillusionment on the other. In a recurring theme throughout the dialogues, Petrarch advises humility in prosperity and fortitude in adversity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://colophon.com/foolscap/phis.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 254 woodcut illustrations by the anonymous [[Master of Petrarch]] for the 1532 German edition are considered masterpieces of the [[German Renaissance]].

In 1579 the dialogues were translated into English by the [[Elizabethan]] physician [[Thomas Twyne]] (1543–1613) as ''Phisicke Against Fortune'', and by [[Susannah Dobson]] in 1791 as ''Petrarch's View of Human Life''.&lt;ref&gt;Antonella Braida, "Dobson , Susannah (d. 1795)", ODNB, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7718 Retrieved 7 October 2014, subscription required.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eva Frankfurther''' (10 February 1930-January 1959) was a German-born British artist, notable for depicting the immigrant communities of the [[East End of London]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="DBuckman"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Buckman|publisher=Art Dictionaries Ltd|year=1989|title=Artists in Britain Since 1945 |ISBN=0953260909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Frankfurther was born in the [[Dahlem (Berlin)|Dahlem]] district of Berlin to a Jewish family. Her father, Paul, was a businessman while her mother, Henriette, was an economics graduate. Henriette died of cancer 18 months after Eva was born and her father remarried in 1934.&lt;ref name="Refigure"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sarah MacDougall (Editor)|publisher=Ben Uri Gallery|year=2014|title=Refiguring the 50's|ISBN=978-0-900157-51-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family fled to Britain in 1939 to avoid persecution under Nazism.&lt;ref name=MTresadern&gt;{{cite web|author=Molly Tresadern|url=https://artuk.org/discover/stories/eva-frankfurther-the-forgotten-german-artist-who-captured-a-changing-london/#|title=Eva Frankfurther: the forgotten German artist who captured a changing London|date=29 March 2017|accessdate=14 November 2018|work=[[Art UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Boundary&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boundarygalleryonline.com/spring-bulletin-2017/|title=Spring Bulletin 2017; Eva Frankfurther|year=2017|accessdate=2 October 2017|work=Boundary Gallery|archivedate=3 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003075124/http://boundarygalleryonline.com/spring-bulletin-2017/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The children, Eva and her two siblings, left Berlin six months before their parents and spent some time in [[Haslemere]], being looked after by German refugee teachers, before their parents arrived in England during August 1939.&lt;ref name="Refigure"/&gt; The family rented a flat in [[Belsize Park Gardens]] but Frankfurther and her sister were evacuated to [[Hertfordshire]] in [[World War II]] to avoid the bombing of London.&lt;ref name=MTresadern/&gt;&lt;ref name="Refigure"/&gt;

After the War, Frankfurther enrolled in [[Saint Martin's School of Art]]. There she studied life drawing under [[Roland Vivian Pitchforth]] and was held in great esteem by her fellow students, who included [[Leon Kossoff]] and [[Frank Auerbach]]. As a student, Frankfurther had spent some summers in America. After graduating in 1951, she visited Italy, where she painted numerous portraits of street beggars and pilgrims, and then, briefly, Paris.&lt;ref name="Refigure"/&gt;  Returning to England, Frankfurther took herself away from the central London art scene, and her family home, and moved to the East End of the city.&lt;ref name=MTresadern/&gt; She lived in a basement flat in [[Whitechapel]] and took an evening job, working as a counter-hand and dish-washer at the [[J. Lyons and Co.]] Corner House restaurant in [[Piccadilly]]. This allowed her time to paint during the day. Frankfurther spent five years working at the Corner House and painted several portraits of her fellow workers. Frankfurther also painted portraits of the local East End population. As well as depicting members of the long established Jewish East End community, she also sketched and painted people from the Pakistani, West Indian and Irish communities then arriving in the area.&lt;ref name=MTresadern/&gt; She left the Corner House in 1956 and took a job at the [[Tate &amp; Lyle]] sugar refinery at Victoria Dock.&lt;ref name=Boundary/&gt; She left that job in 1957 and lived in Israel for several months.&lt;ref name=MTresadern/&gt; She returned to London in 1959 where, suffering from depression, she took her own life.

During her life, Frankfurther only appears to have exhibited locally in the East End, mainly at the [[Whitechapel Gallery]], though she did feature in a group exhibition at the [[Ben Uri Gallery]] in 1956.&lt;ref name=AMcNay&gt;{{cite web |author=Anna McNay|url=http://studiointernational.com/index.php/refiguring-the-50s-ben-uri-joan-eardley-sheila-fell-josef-herman-ls-lowry|title=Refiguring the 50s|date=1 July 2015|accessdate=2 October 2017|work=studio international}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same gallery included examples of her work in their 2014 ''Refiguring the 50s'' exhibition and held a one-person show of her work in 2017.&lt;ref name=BUGallery&gt;{{cite web|url=http://evafrankfurther.benuricollection.org.uk/|title=Eva Frankfurther artist (1930-1959)|year=2017|accessdate=14 November 2018|work=[[Ben Uri Gallery]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6911">The '''Fellowship of Australian Writers''', also known as '''FAW''', was established in Sydney in 1928. Its aim is to bring writers together and promote their interests. It covers such areas as government policy, literary awards, professional advice, representation of writers' rights and the promotion of literature.&lt;ref&gt;Fellowship of Australian Writers (Vic) - About the Fellowship&lt;/ref&gt;

The various states and branches hold meetings and lectures, publish newsletters and anthologies, and run literary competitions and other regular or occasional events such as writers weeks and literary festivals.

==History==
Various claims have been made about its origin, but it seems that poet, [[Mary Gilmore]], was encouraged by [[Roderic Quinn]], and helped by Lucy Cassidy (wife of poet [[R.J. Cassidy]]), to hold a meeting of writers, at which a president, [[John Le Gay Brereton]] was elected.&lt;ref name = "OCAL"&gt;Wilde et al. (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

It was initially a Sydney-based organisation, but gradually spread to other states, with Victoria and Western Australia being the first.&lt;ref name = "OCAL"/&gt; In 1955 a federal council was created, with the national president rotating between the state presidents.

Early prominent members include: in New South Wales, [[Flora Eldershaw]], [[Marjorie Barnard]], [[Frank Dalby Davison]], [[Dymphna Cusack]], [[Miles Franklin]] and [[T. Inglis Moore]]; in Victoria, [[Nettie Palmer]]; and in Western Australia, [[Paul Buddee]], [[Henrietta Drake-Brockman]] and [[Katharine Susannah Prichard]].

The FAW was, with ex-Prime Minister [[Jim Scullin]], largely responsible for a trebling of the [[Commonwealth Literary Fund]]'s budget in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;**Wilde, William H.; Hooton, Joy; and Andrews, Barry ''The Oxford Companion to Australian Literature'' Oxford University Press, Melbourne 2nd ed. {{ISBN|0 19 553381 X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australian Authors' Week==
In 1935 the Fellowship organised an Authors' Week to, in the words of their press release, "encourage the development of our national literature, especially by bringing the work of our authors before the general public and schools".&lt;ref&gt;cited by Dever (1992) p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; The week took place from 8 to 13 April and was held at Farmers' Blaxland Galleries. Events included personal appearances by authors, display of Australian books, dramatisations from Australian works, lectures by writers, radio broadcasts and an authors' ball.&lt;ref name = "Dever101"&gt;Dever (1992) p.101&lt;/ref&gt;

The Week was prompted by a longstanding desire of the Fellowship to strengthen the place of Australian literature in Australian society, and it was believed that a way to do this was to encourage a closer dialogue between authors and their audience. The week was preceded by significant promotion and communication to the community primarily through newspapers and magazines. An editorial written in ''The Telegraph'' during the week commented on the popularity of [[Ion Idriess]] and suggested that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Therein is cause to hope that ere long the appreciation for Australian writings will grow and widen to embrace the works of many others who, with a growing confidence in ultimate success, are continually and obscurely working to give Australians a literature which they may call their own.&lt;ref&gt;cited by Dever (1992) p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The events of the week were mostly held during the day and hence primarily reached, or in some cases specifically targeted at, women, children and teachers. Indeed, it was generally accepted that women formed the bulk of the readership. [[Norman Lindsay]], for example, wrote that "My personal opinion is that the average woman reads much better stuff than the average man".&lt;ref name = "Dever107"&gt;Dever (1992) p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; In his Authors' Week talk, Frank Dalby Davison said that "many people preferred yelling themselves hoarse at a test match or racecourse to reading a book by a cultured author".&lt;ref name = "Dever107"/&gt;

Overall, the Week was deemed a success, with Marjorie Barnard writing that they'd received "a good deal of publicity" and were "pretty satisfied with the effort".&lt;ref&gt;Dever (1992) p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fiorucci''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] fashion label founded by [[Elio Fiorucci]] in 1967. The first shop exposed Milan to the styles of [[Swinging London]] and American classics such as the [[T-shirt]] and [[jeans]]. By the late 1970s and early 1980s this would be reversed and the New York store would become famous for the fashions it introduced to the United States. Known as the "daytime [[Studio 54]]",&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{Citation  | last =Chaplin  | first =Julia  | author-link =  | publication-date =2001-06-10 | year = 2001| title = Fiorucci: Once So Hot and Now, Can It Be Again? | periodical =New York Times | pages = | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/10/living/10FIOR.html | issn = | doi = | oclc = | accessdate =2008-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; it attracted trendsetters from [[Andy Warhol]] to a young [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

As a leader in the [[globalisation]] of fashion, Fiorucci would scour the globe for underground trends introducing a newly affluent mass market to styles such as thongs from Brazil and Afghan coats. The label popularised camouflage prints and leopard-skin prints before creating the designer jean market with the invention of stretch jeans.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; [http://www.fiorucci.com/uk/a-history-of-fiorucci The iconic advertising]{{dead link|date=October 2018}} usually featured a woman's buttocks in skin-tight denim, or in one case obscured by pink fluffy handcuffs, whilst the company logo is two cheeky angels modelled after [[Raphael]]'s cherubs. However, mismanagement of the company led to receivership in 1989 and the brand was subsequently dogged by legal battles over the trademarks.  Several relaunches failed to make much impact.

Elio Fiorucci was found dead in his Milan home on July 20, 2015, at the age of 80.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansa.it/english/news/lifestyle/fashion_luxury/2015/07/20/fashion-designer-elio-fiorucci-is-dead_cc03303f-e899-44b2-a446-79066d22681f.html|title=Fashion designer Elio Fiorucci is dead|work=ANSA.it|date=July 20, 2015|accessdate=July 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month before his death, the brand was sold to Janie and Stephen Schaffer, who had founded the high street chain Knickerbox together in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;https://fashionunited.uk/news/business/former-victoria-s-secret-ceo-janie-schaffer-buys-fiorucci/2015110418198&lt;/ref&gt; Following an on-line Fiorucci launch and campaign featuring Georgia May Jagger, a 5,000 sq ft destination store opened on Brewer Street in London's Soho in September 2017 during London Fashion Week.  The launch party saw the Theo Adams Company transform L’Escargot, London’s oldest French restaurant, into a world of disco, hedonism and horror, and was described by WWD as "the kind of party that many brands would kill for: achingly cool, outrageously oversubscribed and lots of fun."&lt;ref&gt;http://wwd.com/eye/parties/fiorucci-celebrates-reincarnation-london-party-10990688/&lt;/ref&gt; The following month Rizzoli launched a book entitled ''Fiorucci'' to celebrate 50 years of the brand with a foreword by Oscar-winning director Sofia Coppola.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fiorucci.com/uk/fiorucci-rizzoli-book/13748.html#q=book&amp;lang=&amp;start=1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
[[Elio Fiorucci]] was born in [[Milan]] on 10 June 1935, son of a shoe shop owner. One day in 1962, Elio came up with the idea of making [[galoshes]] in bright primary colours whilst working at his father's shop. When they were featured in a local weekly fashion magazine, the galoshes caused a sensation. Following a trip to [[London]] in 1965, Elio was determined to bring [[Carnaby Street]] fashions to Milan. He opened his first shop on [[Galleria Passerella]] in [[Milan]] on 31 May 1967 selling clothes by London designers such as [[Ossie Clark]] and [[Zandra Rhodes]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In 1968 Fiorucci looked East for inspiration, buying cheap T-shirts from India, and turning rice sacks into bags.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiorucci.it/2004/eng/hp_eng.htm |title=Memorabilia:Fiorucci's Steps |format=Flash |year=2004 |publisher=Fiorucci Design Office S.r.l. |accessdate=2008-04-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225132834/http://www.fiorucci.it/2004/eng/hp_eng.htm |archivedate=2008-02-25 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later the company set up its own manufacturing plant, and adopted the "two angels" logo created by Italo Lupi.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; In 1974 the company opened a huge new store on Via Torino in Milan, expanding beyond fashion to offer books, furniture and music.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The new shop also had a performance area, vintage clothing market, and restaurant,&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; and was financed by an investment from the [[Standa]] department stores, part of the [[Montedison]] group. Meanwhile the label introduced the [[monokini]] and [[thong (clothing)|thong]] from Brazil, causing controversy with the topless photos used to advertise them.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Glass beads from [[New Mexico]] were another hit.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; In 1975 the company opened its first store overseas, on the [[King's Road]] in London, and launched a children's collection called Fioruccino.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; It brought Afghan coats to the mass market, and popularised the leopard-skin prints&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; first created by [[Elsa Schiaparelli]] two decades before.

==Heyday==
The 1976 opening of the store down the block from [[Bloomingdale's]], on East [[59th Street (Manhattan)|59th Street]] between Lexington and Park Avenues in [[New York City]],&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; introduced the brand to American trendsetters during the disco age. Customers such as [[Marc Jacobs]]&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; [[Cher]]&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; and [[Terence Conran]]&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; would rub shoulders with [[Jackie Onassis]]&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; and [[Lauren Bacall]],&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; you might see drag queen [[Joey Arias]] serving the [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King of Spain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last =Lahr  | first = John | author-link = | publication-date = 1994-08-22 | year = | title = Arias On Holliday | periodical = The New Yorker | page = 46 | url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1994/08/22/1994_08_22_046_TNY_CARDS_000368311 | issn = | doi = | oclc = | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; author [[Douglas Coupland]] absorbing the store's  pop culture&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Colman|first=David |publication-date=2007-09-30|year=|title=Take a Sharp Turn at Fiorucci|periodical = The New York Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/30/fashion/30POSS.html?_r=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Calvin Klein]] and [[Gloria Vanderbilt]] buying some jeans.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; In the early 1980s the Fiorucci art director was jewelry designer [[Maripol]], known for creating Madonna's look at the time. Other employees included Madonna's brother Christopher Ciccone, [[Terry Jones (i-D)|Terry Jones]] of [[i-D magazine]] fame, [[Oliviero Toscani]], who shot many of the famous [[Benetton Group|Benetton]] ads,&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; and famed interior designer [[Jim Walrod]].&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

In May 1979 cartoon/graffiti-based artist [[Kenny Scharf]] had his first solo exhibition in the New York City store, called "Fiorucci Celebrates the New Wave" and featured his colorful, [[retro-futurism|retro-futuristic]] "Estelle Series." The opening included a performance by [[Klaus Nomi]], the new wave opera singer.&lt;ref&gt;Gruen, John, ''Keith Haring: The Authorized Biography'', New York: Prentice Hall, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Art After Midnight: The East Village Scene|first=Steven|last=Hager|year=1986|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the company continued to bring new products to market, including a collection made from [[DuPont]]'s new [[Tyvek]] fabric, and velvet slippers from China.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; In 1978 they were the first fashion house to license their name for a collection of sunglasses, whilst in 1981 a Disney licence led to a highly successful range of clothes emblazoned with [[Mickey Mouse]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Ever on the pulse of the times, Fiorucci sponsored the reunion of [[Simon and Garfunkel]] in [[The Concert in Central Park]] on 19 September 1981, attended by 400,000 people or more, and on the bill for their birthday party in 1983 was a then-unknown Madonna.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; In 1982 the company launched the first stretch jeans with [[Lycra]], and the success of the 5-pocket "Safety" jeans was recognised three years later in a licensing deal with [[Wrangler Jeans]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; In 1987 Fiorucci produced the Junior Gaultier line designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier,&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; and in 1989 they went back to their roots with a deal with [[Vivienne Westwood]], queen of the London street scene.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

The company expanded rapidly after 1978, launching new stores across the US, Europe and Asia. In  1981 Benetton bought Montedison's 50% stake in Fiorucci, which was reduced to 33.3% in 1986&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | publication-date =1993-04-22 | year = | title =fallimento Fiorucci.

It never stopped being happening — it just left New York City, because I don't think New York City was happening enough by the mid-80's".&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Fiorucci closed down the rest of the US retail locations in 1988 after a franchise dispute, moving instead to a wholesale strategy. The company went into administration in April 1989 following a dispute over the strategic direction of the firm that had seen Elio offer to buy out Aki Nuhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =  | first =  | author-link = | publication-date =1989-02-06 | year = | title = Elio Fiorucci is buying his partner's 50% stake | periodical =WWD | series = | publication-place = | place = | publisher = | volume = | issue = | pages = | url = | issn = | doi = | oclc = | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival==
The company was rescued by the Tacchella brothers of Italian jeans company Carrera S.p.A., who sold on the company to Japanese jeans group [[Edwin (clothing)|Edwin Co., Ltd]] for 45bn lire (~US$41m).&lt;ref name="Bannon"&gt;{{Citation| last =Bannon | first =Lisa | author-link = | publication-date = 1991-02-01 | year = | title = Fiorucci plans collection, opening of 5 flagship stores | periodical = WWD | series = | publication-place = | place = | publisher = | volume = | issue = | pages = | url = | issn = | doi = | oclc = | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 1996 after a plea bargain, Elio Fiorucci was given a suspended jail sentence of 22 months for inflating the value of invoices to increase the value of the company to Carrera at the expense of his creditors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | publication-date =1996-01-20 | year = | title =Bancarotta.

Originally, Edwin planned to launch five stores in key cities like London,&lt;ref name="Bannon"/&gt; but although they signed an initial deal on 4 June 1990 that was ratified that October, Edwin did not gain control of the Fiorucci assets until May 1992.&lt;ref name="Gamache"&gt;{{cite web | last= Gamache | first = Barry | url= http://www.robic.ca/publications/Pdf/142.056.pdf | title=Serious Intent To Resume Use of Trade-mark Must Be Found to Excuse Absence Of Use In Summary Expungement Case | format=PDF | publisher = Leger Robic Richard / Robic, Quebec | year = 1995 | accessdate=2008-04-29}} Discusses Canadian trademark case ''Edwin Company Ltd. v. 176718 Canada Inc.'', No. T-803-94, March 30, 1995; 60 CPR (3d) 464 (FCTD) in which Edwin appealed the 1994 loss of the rights to the Fiorucci name.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact they would later lose the rights to the Fiorucci name in Canada on the grounds of disuse.&lt;ref name="Gamache"/&gt; However, one of Edwin's first acts was a deal with [[Coles Myer]] that would see 68 Fiorucci concessions in stores across Australia.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; They opened a new store in Piazza San Babila, Milan in early 1993, that included a variety of branded boutiques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Forden  | first = Sara Gay | author-link = | publication-date =1993-11-08 | year = | title = | periodical =Footwear News | series = | publication-place = | place = | publisher = | volume = | issue = | pages = | url = | issn = | doi = | oclc = | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took them longer to get things going in North America, after a 1993 deal with Mary Ann Wheaton of Wheaton International&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last =Gordon   | first =Maryellen | author-link =  | last2 =White | first2 = Constance C.R. | publication-date = 1993-08-03 | year = | title =Wheaton plans Fiorucci store comeback | periodical =WWD | series = | publication-place = | place = | publisher = | volume = | issue = | pages = | url = | issn = | doi = | oclc = | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; fell through.

Meanwhile the brand continued to thrive in Europe, and regained some of its former notoriety in 1995 with a poster campaign for its jeans featuring a naked woman's buttocks and pink furry handcuffs, which became instant bestsellers.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; In 1999 it launched a successful perfume, followed by a second, ''Fiorucci Loves You'', in 2001, and "Miss Fiorucci" makeup in 2003.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Edwin have been aggressively expanding the brand throughout Asia, from Seoul to Tokyo and China.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

Although Elio Fiorucci retained creative control during the Edwin era, the new owners were protective of the Fiorucci trademarks, and took legal action against H&amp;M in the US when Elio designed H&amp;M's Poolside line. He had also set up a brand of his own called Love Therapy,&lt;ref name="ecodibiella" /&gt; and designed for [[Agent Provocateur (lingerie)|Agent Provocateur]].

In March 2003, Elio Fiorucci announced that after 36 years, he was closing the doors to his historic shop in [[Corso Vittorio Emmanuele]], Milan. When Fiorucci hit the scene nearly 40 years ago, he blew Italy - and the rest of the world - away with a larger-than-life attitude. He brought in the new and unexpected, pre-dating the surge of today's "lifestyle" stores. Fiorucci mixed clothing with beauty products, vintage items, music and home furnishings. He even used his retail space for artistic performances. Elio, who had become an ethical vegetarian,&lt;ref name="ecodibiella"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecodibiella.it/it/web/visti-da-vicino-br-elio-fiorucci-6103/sez/territorio|language=Italian|author=Giovanni Orso|title=Visti da vicino: Elio Fiorucci|publisher=Eco di Biella|date=2012-03-05|accessdate=2013-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; said the reason he was closing his shop was because he had "fallen out of love" with fashion.

In 2015, the year Elio Fiorucci died, the brand was sold by the Japanese trading house Itochu to Janie Schaffer, an ex-  CEO of Victoria's Secret, and her business partner and former husband Stephen. Their plans to relaunch the iconic brand began in early 2017 with pop-up shops in Barneys in New York, and Selfridges and Harrods in London.  A new three storey Fiorucci store opens in Brewer Street in London's Soho in September 2017.

==In popular culture==
In 1979, along with [[Halston]] and [[Gucci]], Fiorucci was name-checked in the [[Sister Sledge]] disco song, "[[He's The Greatest Dancer]]".{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Another artist, singer and songwriter Terence Boylan, also name-checked Fiorucci in his 1980 song, "Shake Your Fiorucci" [(Suzy Terence Boylan Asylum 6E-201 (1980)]. As did Antipodean band Australian Crawl in their 1980 song, "Hoochie Gucci Fiorucci Mama", which also referenced Gucci.

The [[Beverly Hills]] Fiorucci store was featured in the 1980 cult classic movie ''[[Xanadu (film)|Xanadu]]'', where the  [[Electric Light Orchestra|ELO]] video "All Over the World" was filmed. A fake Fiorucci store was built on the set of the final battle in New York city for the movie Superman II in 1979.

Christopher Ciccone stated in his book ''Life With My Sister, Madonna'' that he worked at the Manhattan store in the early 80's; also stating that is where he met his lover.
[[United Kingdom|British]] artist [[Mark Leckey]] used the brand name in his landmark work from 1999, ''Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore''.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Leckey, "Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore," Guggenheim, 1999. Accessed 09/13/17 https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/15753&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiorucci was mentioned in the song "Beverly Hills" by the band The Circle Jerks.

The 1981 EP [[Minor Disturbance]] by American punk band [[The Teen Idles]] featured the song "Fiorucci Nightmare".

In 2017, American DJ [[Alex Gimeno]] best known for '''Ursula 1000''' released the album ''Galleria'' which contains the single ''"Fiorucci".''

'''Goharshad Mosque''' ({{lang-fa|مسجد گوهرشاد}}) is a former free standing [[mosque]] in [[Mashhad]] of the [[Razavi Khorasan Province]], [[Iran]], which now serves as one of the prayer halls within the [[Imam Reza shrine]] complex.

==History==
It was built by the order of Empress [[Goharshad]], the wife of [[Shah Rukh (Timurid dynasty)|Shah Rukh]] of the [[Timurid dynasty]] in 1418 CE. The architect of the edifice was Ghavameddin Shirazi, who is responsible for so many of Shah Rukh's great buildings, with the architectural and decorative manpower supplied from [[Shiraz]] and [[Isfahan]]. 

The mosque underwent some renovations during the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] and [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] eras. It has four ''[[iwan]]s'' and a courtyard measuring {{convert|50|x|55|m|abbr=on}}, as well as several ''[[shabestan]]s''.

The double layered dome of the mosque was severely damaged in 1911 in bombings by troops of the [[Russian Empire]].

==Design==
{{Quote|The first and the greatest surviving, [[Iranian architecture|Persian monument]] of the fifteenth century is the beautiful mosque of Gawhar Shad (1418) now abutting the shrine of the Imam Reza in Mashhad. Its portal continues the [[Samarkand]] style of arch within arch, enriched by a succession of [[bevel]]s and reveals that give it depth and power. The thick, tower-like [[minaret]]s, merging with the outer corners of the portal screen, extend to the ground and, together with the high foundation [[revetment]] of marble, give the ensemble the impression of solidity necessary to support its exuberant color. The entire court [[facade]] is faced with enamel brick and [[mosaic]] [[faience]] of the finest quality.

The full scale of colors includes a dominant cobalt blue and turquoise, white, a transparent green, yellow, saffron, aubergine and mirrorblack - all tones fluctuating through several shades. The [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|patterns]] lucid and vigorous, are artfully adapted to their decorative role, whether for eye-panels, or dome ornament meant to be effective at a thousand feet.

Monotony, difficult to avoid in such a large area, and a distracting intricacy that might compete with the essential architectural forms are both forestalled.

This is accomplished by the energy of the faience floral patterns and brick [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometrical schemes]]; by the emphatic rhythm of the arcades, open galleries and deep recesses; and especially by the contrast of the ivans.|[[Arthur Pope]]|Persian Architecture: The Triumph of Form and Color&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Arthur Pope|first=Arthur|last=Upham Pope|title=Persian Architecture: The Triumph of Form and Color|location=New York|year= 1965|isbn = 978-0-8076-0308-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26894">The '''Hurufiyya movement''' ({{lang-ar|حروفية}} ''hurufiyya'', adjective form ''hurufi'' literal meaning "letters" [of the alphabet]) was an aesthetic movement that emerged in the late twentieth century amongst [[Arabian]] and North African artists, who used their understanding of traditional [[Islamic calligraphy]], within the precepts of [[modern art]]. By combining tradition and modernity, these artists worked towards developing a Pan-Arab visual language, which instilled a sense of national identity in their respective nation states, at a time when many of these states where shaking off colonial rule and asserting their independence. They adopted the same name as the [[Hurufi]], an approach of [[Sufism]] which emerged in the late 14th–early 15th century. Art historian, Dagher, has described hurufiyya as the most important movement to emerge in the Arab art world in the 20th-century. 

==Definition==
The term, ''hurifiyya'' is derived from the Arabic term, ''harf'' which means letter (as in a letter of the alphabet). When the term is used to describe an contemporary art movement, it explicitly references a Medieval system of teaching involving political theology and lettrism. In this theology, letters were seen as primordial signifiers and manipulators of the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;Mir-Kasimov, O., ''Words of Power: Hurufi Teachings Between Shi'ism and Sufism in Medieval Islam,'' I.B. Tauris and the Institute of Ismaili Studies, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the term is charged with Sufi intellectual and esoteric meaning. &lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, pp 1294-95; Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press,  2017  p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

The hurufiyya art movement (also known as the ''Al-hurufiyyah movement''&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; or the ''Letrism movement''&lt;ref&gt;Issa, R., Cestar. J. and Porter,V., ''Signs of Our Times: From Calligraphy to Calligraffiti,''New York, Merrill, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;) refers to the use of calligraphy as a graphic element within an artwork, typically an abstract work.&lt;ref&gt;Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' [https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/ Online:] ;Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; The pan-Arab hurufiyya art movement is distinct from the [[Letterist International]] which had an Algerian section founded in [[Chlef]] in 1953 by [[Hadj Mohamed Dahou]]. 

The term, ''hurufiyya'' has become somewhat controversial and has been rejected by a number of scholars, including [[Wijdan Ali]], Nada Shabout and Karen  Dabrowska. An alternative term, ''al-Madrassa al-Khattiya Fil-Fann'' [Calligraphic School of Art] has been proposed to describe the experimental use of calligraphy in modern Arabic art.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, p.80; Shabout, N., "Huroufiyah" in: ''Routledge Encyclopedia Of Modern Art,'' Routledge, 2016,  DOI: 10.4324/9781135000356-REM176-1; Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, pp 166-67&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brief history and philosophy==
[[File:Amir Khusraw Dihlavi - An Old Sufi Laments His Lost Youth - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''An Old Sufi Laments His Lost Youth,'' page from a Sufi manuscript, 13th century. Sufi art served as part of the inspiration for the al-hurufiyya movement.]]
Traditional hurufi art was bound by strict rules, which amongst other things, confined calligraphy to devotional works and prohibited the representation of humans in manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt; Schimmel,  A., ''Calligraphy and Islamic Culture,'' London, I.B. Taurus, 1990, pp 31-32&lt;/ref&gt; Practising calligraphers trained with a master for many years in order to learn both the technique and the rules governing calligraphy. Contemporary hurufiyya artists broke free from these rules, allowing Arabic letters to be deconstructed, altered and included in abstract artworks.&lt;ref&gt;Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press,  2017  p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  

The use of traditional Arabic elements, notably, calligraphy, in modern art arose independently in various Islamic states; few of these artists working in this area, had knowledge of each other, allowing for different manifestations of hurufiyya to develop in different regions. &lt;ref&gt;Dadi. I., "Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective," ''South Atlantic Quarterly,'' 109 (3), 2010 pp 555-576, [https://doi.org/10.121500382876-2010-006 DOI:]; Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds), ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294&lt;/ref&gt; In Sudan, for instance, the movement was known as the ''Old Khartoum School'',&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; and assumed a distinctive character in which both African motifs and calligraphy were combined, while media such as leather and wood replaced canvas to provide a distinct African style.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds), ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1298-1299; Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; In Morocco, the movement was accompanied by the replacement of traditional media for oils; artists favoured traditional dyes such as henna, and embraced weaving, jewellery and tattoo as well as including traditional Berber motifs.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; In Jordan, it was generally known as the ''al-hurufiyyah'' movement, while in Iran, the [[Iranian modern and contemporary art#Saqqakhaneh movement|Saqqa-Khaneh movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have suggested that [[Madiha Omar]], who was active in the US and Baghdad from the mid-1940s, was the pioneer of the movement, since she was the first to explore the use of Arabic script in a contemporary art context in the 1940s and exhibited hurufiyya-inspired works in Washington in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press,  2017  pp 115-119&lt;/ref&gt; However, other scholars have suggested that she was a ''precursor'' to Hurufiyya&lt;ref&gt;Anima Gallery, "Madiha Omar," [Biographical Notes], [https://www.meemartgallery.com/art_resources.php?id=89 Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;. Yet other scholars have suggested that the hurufiyya art movement probably began in North Africa, in the area around Sudan, with the work of [[Ibrahim el-Salahi]],&lt;ref&gt;Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' [https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/ Online:];Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56; Dadi. I., "Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective," ''South Atlantic Quarterly,'' 109 (3), 2010 pp 555-576, DOI:https://doi.org/10.121500382876-2010-006&lt;/ref&gt; who initially explored Coptic manuscripts,  a step that led him to experiment with Arabic calligraphy.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear that by the early 1950s, a number of artists in different countries were experimenting with works based on calligraphy, including the Iraqi painter and sculptor, [[Jamil Hamoudi]] who experimented with the graphic possibilities of using Arabic characters, as early as 1947;&lt;ref&gt;Inati, S.C., ''Iraq: Its History, People, and Politics,'' Humanity Books, 2003, p.76; Beaugé, F. and Clément, J-F., ''L'image dans le Monde Arabé,''CNRS Éditions, 1995, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Iranian painters, Nasser Assar (b. 1928) ([[:fr:Nasser Assar]]) and [[Hossein Zenderoudi]], who won a prize at the 1958 Paris Biennale.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Hurufiyya artists rejected Western art concepts, and instead grappled with a new artistic identity drawn from within their own culture and heritage. These artists successfully integrated Islamic visual traditions, especially calligraphy, into contemporary, indigenous compositions. &lt;ref&gt;Lindgren, A. and Ross, S., ''The Modernist World,'' Routledge, 2015, p. 495; Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' [https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/ Online:]; Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; The common theme amongst hurufiyya artists is that they all tapped into the beauty and mysticism of Arabic calligraphy, but used it in a modern, abstract sense. &lt;ref&gt;Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press, 2017, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Although hurufiyya artists struggled to find their own individual dialogue with nationalism, they also worked towards a broader aesthetic that transcended national boundaries and represented an affiliation with an Arab identity in the post-colonial period.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294&lt;/ref&gt;

The art historian, Christiane Treichl, explains how calligraphy is used in contemporary art:&lt;ref&gt;Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press,  2017  p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; 
: "They deconstruct writing, exploit the letter and turn it into an indexical sign of calligraphy, tradition and cultural heritage. As the sign is purely aesthetic, and only linguistic in its cultural association, it opens hitherto untravelled avenues for interpretation, and attracts different audiences, yet still maintains a link to the respective artist's own culture... Hurufiyya artists do away with the signifying function of language. The characters become pure signs, and temporarily emptied of their referential meaning, they become available for new meanings."  

The hurufiyya art movement was not confined to painters, but also included important ceramicists such as the Jordanian, [[Mahmoud Taha]], who combined traditional aesthetics, including calligraphy, with skilled craftsmanship,&lt;ref&gt;Asfour, M., "A Window on Contemporary Arab Art," NABAD Art Gallery, Online: http://www.nabadartgallery.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and sculptors, such as the Qatari, [[Yousef Ahmad]]&lt;ref&gt;Anima Gallery, "Yousef Ahdmad," [Biographical Notes], [http://www.animagallery.com/artists/yousef-ahmad/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Iraqi sculptors, [[Jawad Saleem]] and [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]]. Nor, was the movement organised along formal lines across the Arab-speaking nations. In some Arab nations, hurufiyya artists formed formal groups or societies, such as Iraq's ''Al Bu'd al Wahad'' (or the [[One Dimension Group]])" which published a manifesto,&lt;ref&gt;"Shaker Hassan Al Said," Darat al Funum, Online: www.daratalfunun.org/main/activit/curentl/anniv/exhib3.html; Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds), ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294 &lt;/ref&gt; while in other nations artists working independently in the same city had no knowledge of each other.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, pp 165-66; Dadi, I., "Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective," ''South Atlantic Quarterly. '' Vol. 109, No. 3, 2010, pp 555-576, DOI: 10.1215/00382876-2010-006&lt;/ref&gt; 

Art historian, Dagher, has described hurufiyya as the most important movement to emerge in the Arab world in the 20th-century. &lt;ref name="Dagher"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dagher|first1=Charles|last2=Mahmoud|first2=Samir|title=Arabic Hurufiyya: Art and Identity|date=2016|publisher=Skira Editore|location=Milan|isbn=978-8857231518}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' while acknowledging its importance in terms of encouraging Arab nationalism, describes hurufiyya as neither "a movement nor a school." &lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution of hurufiyya===
[[File:نصب أشعار بغداد.jpg|thumb|''[[Ashaar Baghdad (monument)|Ashaar Baghdad]]'' (Baghdad's poetry) by [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]]. In this fountain, Arabic words taken from a poem by Mustafa Jamal El Din have been squeezed together to form the oval shape in an example of Asbract calligraphy.]]

Art historians have identified three generations of hurufiyya artists: &lt;ref&gt;Issa, R., Cestar. J. and Porter,V., ''Signs of Our Times: From Calligraphy to Calligraffiti,''New York, Merrill, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''First generation'': The pioneers, who inspired by the independence of their nations, searched for a new aesthetic language that would allow them to express their nationalism. These artists rejected European techniques and media, turning to indigenous media and introducing Arabic calligraphy into their art. For this group of artists, Arabic letters are a central feature of the artwork. First generation artists include: the Jordanian artist, [[Wijdan Ali|Princess Wijdan Ali]], the Sudanese artist, [[Ibrahim el-Salahi]]; the Iraqi artists, [[Shakir Hassan Al Said|Shakkir Hassan Al Sa'id]], [[Jamil Hamoudi]] and [[Jawad Saleem]]; the Lebanese painter and poet, [[Etel Adnan]] and the Egyptian artist, Ramzi Moustafa (b. 1926).  

: ''Second generation'': Artists, most of whom live in exile, but reference their traditions, culture and language in their artworks. The artist, [[Dia Azzawi]] is typical of this generation.

: ''Third generation'':  Contemporary artists who have absorbed international aesthetics, and who employ Arabic and Persian script occasionally. They deconstruct the letters, and use them in a purely abstract and decorative manner. The work of [[Golnaz Fathi]] and [[Lalla Essaydi]] is representative of the third generation.

==Types of hurufiyya art==
Hurufiyya art involved a very diverse range of "explorations into the abstract, graphic, and aesthetic properties of Arabic letters." &lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; Art historians, including Wijdan Ali and Shirbil Daghir, have attempted to develop a way of classifying different types of hurufiyya art.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, pp 79-85&lt;/ref&gt; Ali identifies the following, which she describes as ''schools'' within the ''movement'': &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 165; It should be noted that Daghir uses a different classification, not canvassed here.&lt;/ref&gt;

; Pure calligraphy
: Artworks in which calligraphy forms both the background and the foreground. &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;
; Neoclassical
: Works that adhere to the rules of 13th-century calligraphy. An example of this is the work of [[Khairat Al-Saleh]] (b. 1940) &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dia-Al-Azzawi-Portrait-Picture.jpg|thumb|Artist, Dia-Al-Azzawi, exhibits the style of the Calligraphy Combinations School of Hurufiyya art]]
; Modern classical
: Works that blend pure calligraphy with other motifs, such as repeating geometric patterns. Ahmad Moustaffa (b. 1943) is representative of this style&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 165-66&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Calligraffiti]]  
: Artwork, employing script, but which follows no rules and where artists require no formal training. Calligraffiti artists employ their own ordinary handwriting within a modern composition. Artists may reshape letters, or simply invent new letters that reference traditional Arabic scripts. Artists that belong to this school include: Lebanese painter and poet, [[Etel Adnan]]; Egyptian painter, Ramzi Moustafa (b. 1926) and the Iraqi artist and intellectual. [[Shakir Hassan Al Said]].&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 167-69&lt;/ref&gt;
; Freeform calligraphy
: Artworks that balance classical styles with calligraffiti.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;
; Abstract calligraphy
: Art that deconstructs letters and includes them as a graphic element in an abstract artwork. In this style of art, letters may be legible, illegible or may use pseudo-script. Rafa al-Naisiri (b. 1940) and [[Mahmoud Hammad]] (1923-1988) are notable examples of this style of artist.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 170-172&lt;/ref&gt;
; Calligraphy Combinations
: Artworks that use any combination of calligraphy styles, often employing marginal calligraphy or unconscious calligraphy. Artist, [[Dia Azzawi]] is a representative of this style.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable exponents==

Iraqi painter, [[Madiha Omar]], is recognised as a pioneer of the hurufiyaa art movement, having exhibited a number of hurufist-inspired works in Georgetown in Washington as early as 1949. &lt;ref&gt;Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press,  2017  p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; and publishing ''Arabic Calligraphy: An Inspiring Element in Abstract Art'' in 1950.&lt;ref name="Ahram"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexandria exhibition celebrates 'Hurufiyya' art movement - Visual Art - Arts &amp; Culture - Ahram Online|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/5/25/253331/Arts--Culture/Visual-Art/Alexandria-exhibition-celebrates-Hurufiyya-art-mov.aspx|website=english.ahram.org.eg|accessdate=18 February 2018|language=en}}; Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press,  2017  p. 117&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jamil Hamoudi]] was also a pioneer, active from the 1950s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6131">The '''Independent Theatre Society''' was a by-subscription-only organisation in London from 1891 to 1897, founded by Dutch drama critic [[J. T. Grein|Jacob Grein]] to give "special performances of plays which have a literary and artistic rather than a commercial value."&lt;ref name=Glimpse&gt;[http://www.wayneturney.20m.com/independenttheatre.htm ''The Independent Theatre''] (A Glimpse of Theatre History), accessed 15 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The society was inspired by its continental forerunners, the ''[[Théâtre-Libre]]'' (Free Theatre) and ''[[Die Freie Bühne]]'' (Free Stage).  The Society produced modern [[Realism (theatre)|realist]] plays, mostly by continental European playwrights, on the London stage.

==Description==
The Society's performances, using professional actors, were given in theatres that were otherwise 'dark' &amp;mdash; on Sundays, when no normal performances were scheduled.  Because membership was by subscription, the performances were not "public", and so the Society was allowed to perform plays that had not received a licence from the [[Lord Chamberlain's Office]]; and in this way they were able to avoid the censorship of the London stage.&lt;!-- Who directed the plays? Were the production values, as I imagine, minimalist? --&gt;

During 1891, the [[Royalty Theatre]] fell vacant and offered the Society an opportunity to stage plays with a professional cast and crew.&lt;ref name=Brit&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41093 ''The Pitt Estate in Dean Street: The Royalty Theatre'',] ''[[Survey of London]]: volumes 33 and 34: St Anne Soho'' (1966), pp. 215-21, accessed 15 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The first performance for the Society there was of [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'', on 13 March 1891 &amp;mdash; in a translation by [[William Archer (critic)|William Archer]]. This was followed by [[Émile Zola]]'s ''[[Thérèse Raquin]]'' on 9 October 1891. Both plays were greeted with a storm of protest. ''Ghosts'' was described thus: "an orderly audience, including many ladies... listened attentively to the dramatic exposition of a subject which is not usually discussed outside the walls of an hospital". Other critics called for the withdrawal of [[Kate Santley]]'s licence.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt;  The following year, Grein approached the (then) young theatre critic [[George Bernard Shaw]] for a play for the Society. Shaw's first play, ''[[Widowers' Houses]]'', premièred for the Society at the [[Royalty Theatre]] on 9 December 1892.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt; ''A Question of Memory'' by [[Michael Field (author)|Michael Field]] premièred on 27 October 1893;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adam-matthew-publications.co.uk/digital_guides/michael_field_and_fin_de_siecle_culture_and_society/Detailed-Listing.aspx ''The Journals, 1868-1914, and Correspondence of Katharine Bradley and Edith Cooper''] from the [[British Library]], London accessed 16 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and  ''The Black Cat'' by Irish playwright, [[John Todhunter ]] received its only performance, on 8 December 1893, at the [[Opera Comique]]. The Society premièred Ibsen's ''[[The Wild Duck]]'' (in translation) in 1894.  In 1895, Grein invited [[Aurélien Lugné-Poe]] to present a season of productions in French, of Ibsen's ''[[Rosmersholm]]'', ''[[The Master Builder]]'' and [[Maurice Maeterlinck]]'s [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]] ''[[L'Intruse]]'' and ''[[Pelléas and Mélisande]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Styan, J. ''Modern Drama in Theory and Practice: Realism and Naturalism'' pp. 55&amp;ndash;57 (Cambridge University Press, 1981) {{ISBN|0-521-29628-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Membership of the Society never exceeded 175, but it was influential, including [[George Meredith]], [[Arthur Wing Pinero]], [[Thomas Hardy]] and [[Henry James]], amongst the members.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/lma_learning/theatreland/timelines19.asp#1869 ''Theatreland Timeline'' (London Metropolitan Archives)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101092221/https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/lma_learning/theatreland/timelines19.asp |date=2007-11-01 }} accessed 15 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, Shaw wrote (of the Society) "The Independent Theatre is an excellent institution, simply because it is independent. The disparagers ask what it is independent of.... It is, of course, independent of commercial success.... If Mr Grein had not taken the dramatic critics of London and put them in a row before ''Ghosts'' and ''The Wild Duck'', with a small but inquisitive and influential body of enthusiasts behind them, we should be far less advanced today than we are. The real history of the drama for the last ten years is not the history of the prosperous enterprises of Mr Hare, [[Henry Irving|Mr Irving]], and the established West-End theatres, but of the forlorn hopes led by Mr Vernon, Mr Charrington, Mr Grein, Messrs Henly and Stevenson, Miss Achurch, Miss Robins and Miss Lea, Miss Farr and the rest of the Impossibilities."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Saturday Review (London)|The Saturday Review]]'' Ixxix, 26 January 1895, pp. 126&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to urge that the London managers "might provide one marketable play each year", so that the Society could continue as a laboratory for experimental theatre.

As a result of its small subscription base and its high ambitions, the Society was not financially successful and was wound up in 1897, having presented 22 productions and premières of an additional 26 one-act programmes. The [[Incorporated Stage Society]] took over the work two years later and was itself the inspiration for the formation of the [[Abbey Theatre]] in [[Dublin]] and the [[English Stage Company]], which is today the resident company of the [[Royal Court Theatre]].  Grein continued his interest in European theatre, founding the [[German Theatre in London Programme]] in 1900 with his future wife, the actress, Alice Augusta Greeven.

A '''New Testament uncial''' is a section of the New Testament in [[Greek language|Greek]] or [[Latin language|Latin]] [[majuscule]] letters, written on [[parchment]] or [[vellum]]. This style of writing is called ''Biblical Uncial'' or ''Biblical Majuscule''.

New Testament uncials are distinct from other ancient texts based on the following differences:
* [[List of New Testament papyri|New Testament papyri]]&amp;nbsp;– written on [[papyrus]] and generally more ancient
* [[List of New Testament minuscules|New Testament minuscules]]&amp;nbsp;– written in [[Minuscule cursive|minuscule]] letters and generally more recent
* [[List of New Testament lectionaries|New Testament lectionaries]]&amp;nbsp;– usually written minuscule (but some in uncial) letters and generally more recent
* New Testament uncials&amp;nbsp;– written in majuscule letters, on parchment or velum.

== Classification of uncials ==
In 1751, New Testament theologian [[Johann Jakob Wettstein]] knew of only 23 uncial [[codex|codices]] of the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Wettstein
 | first = J. J.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1859, [[Constantin von Tischendorf]] had increased that number to 64 uncials, and in 1909 [[Caspar René Gregory]] enumerated 161 uncial codices. By 1963, [[Kurt Aland]], in his ''Kurzgefasste Liste'', had enumerated 250, then in 1989, finally, 299 uncials.

Wettstein inaugurated the modern method of classification. He used capital Latin letters to identify the uncials. Codex Alexandrinus received the letter "A", Codex Vaticanus&amp;nbsp;– "B", Codex Ephraemi&amp;nbsp;– "C", Codex Bezae&amp;nbsp;– "D", until he arrived at the last letter used by him, "O". Succeeding generations used this pattern, but newly discovered manuscripts soon exhausted the Latin alphabet.&lt;ref name = Aland&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, letters of the Greek and Hebrew alphabets began to be used. Tischendorf, for example, assigned the [[Codex Sinaiticus]] the Hebrew letter &lt;big&gt;א&lt;/big&gt;. [[Uncial 047]] received [[siglum]] &lt;big&gt;ב&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, [[Codex Vaticanus 2061|Uncial 048]] received &lt;big&gt;ב&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, [[Uncial 075]] received &lt;big&gt;ג&lt;/big&gt;, [[Codex Macedoniensis]]&amp;nbsp;– &lt;big&gt;ו&lt;/big&gt;, to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;H.

C. Hinrichs'sche Buchhandlung|location=Leipzig|pages=172–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Greek and Hebrew letters ran out, Gregory assigned uncials numerals with an initial 0 (to distinguish them from the symbols of minuscule manuscripts). Codex Sinaiticus received the number 01, Alexandrinus&amp;nbsp;– 02, Vaticanus&amp;nbsp;– 03, Ephraemi&amp;nbsp;– 04, etc. The last uncial manuscript known by Gregory received number 0161.&lt;ref&gt;[[C.

{{as of|2012}} over 320 sigla for uncial codices have been catalogued by the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research|Institute for New Testament Textual Research (INTF)]] in Münster, Germany.&lt;ref name = INTF&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://intf.uni-muenster.de/vmr/NTVMR/ListeHandschriften.php|title=Liste Handschriften|publisher=Institute for New Testament Textual Research|accessdate=16 November 2010|location=Münster}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eberhard Nestle]], [[Erwin Nestle]], Barbara Aland and [[Kurt Aland]] (eds), ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece]]'', 27th edition, (Stuttgart: ''[[Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft]]'', 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the 322 currently catalogued does not provide a precise count of all the New Testament Greek uncials. [[Uncial 0168]] has been lost and over thirty manuscripts are associated with a smaller set of designations.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;074, 084, 090, 0110, 0112, 0113, 0117, 0119, 0123, 0124, 0125, 0137, 0138, 0139, 0149, 0179, 0180, 0190, 0191, 0193, 0194, 0195, 0202, 0215, 0224, 0235, 0285, 0293.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes one number also applies to two separate manuscripts, as with uncial 092a and 092b, 0121a and 0121b, and 0278a and 0278b. Some other numerical designations should be reallocated to other lists: 055 (commentary), 0100 (lectionary), 0129 (lectionary), 0152 ([[Amulet|talisman]]), 0153 ([[ostracon]]), 0192 (lectionary), 0195 (lectionary), 0203 (lectionary).{{Elucidate|date=May 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== List of all registered New Testament uncial codices ==

* The numbers (#) are the now standard system of [[Biblical manuscripts#Gregory-Aland|Gregory-Aland]].
* Dates are estimated [[Palaeography|palaeographically]] by the INTF (except [[Codex Vaticanus 354]] where the scribe gave a date&amp;nbsp;— 949).
* Content generally only describes sections of the New Testament: [[Gospel]]s (Gosp), The [[Acts of the Apostles]] (Acts), [[Pauline Epistles]] (Paul), [[Catholic epistles]] (CE), and so on. Sometimes the surviving portion of a codex is so limited that specific books, chapters or even verses can be indicated. Linked articles, where they exist, generally specify content in detail, by verse.
* Digital images are referenced with direct links to the hosting web pages, with the exception of those at the [[INTF]]. The quality and accessibility of the images is as follows:

{| style="background:transparent"
|bgcolor="sandybrown"|Gold color indicates high resolution color images available online.
|-
|bgcolor="tan"|Tan color indicates high resolution color images available locally, not online.
|-
|bgcolor="wheat"|Light tan color indicates only a small fraction of manuscript pages with color images available online.
|-
|bgcolor="lightgray"|Light gray color indicates black/white or microfilm images available online.
|-
|bgcolor="powderblue"|Light blue color indicates manuscript not imaged, and is currently lost or ownership unknown.
|-
|bgcolor="mistyrose"|Light pink color indicates manuscript destroyed, presumed destroyed, or deemed too fragile to digitize.
|-
|bgcolor="violet"|Violet color indicates high resolution ultraviolet images available online.
|}
&lt;br&gt;
† Indicates the manuscript has damaged or missing pages.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;K&lt;/sup&gt; Indicates manuscript also includes a commentary.&lt;br /&gt;
[ ] Brackets around Gregory-Aland number indicate the manuscript belongs to an already numbered manuscript, was found to not be a continuous text manuscript, is destroyed or presumed destroyed.

Only one uncial, [[Codex Sinaiticus]] has a complete text of the [[New Testament]]. [[Codex Alexandrinus]] has an almost complete text. It contains all books of the New Testament but lacks some leaves of Matthew (25), John (2), and Second Corinthians (3). [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]] lacks the four last books, and the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] is not complete. Codex Ephraemi has approximately 66 per cent of the New Testament. Uncials with designations higher than 046 typically have only one or two leaves.

=== Uncials with sigla ===

The first 45 uncials have been assigned descriptive names as well as a single letter code called a ''[[siglum]]'', for usage in academic writing. Beginning with uncial 046 the assignment of ''sigla'' was dropped and only a few manuscripts thereafter received a descriptive name.

'''Lydia Goehr''' is a Professor of Philosophy at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name=obio&gt;{{cite web|title=Lydia Goehr {{!}} Department of Philosophy|url=http://philosophy.columbia.edu/directories/faculty/lydia-goehr|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her research specialties include the [[philosophy of music]], [[aesthetics]], [[critical theory]], the [[philosophy of history]], and [[19th-century philosophy|19th]]- and [[20th-century philosophy]].

==Biography==
Goehr was born in [[London]], on January 10, 1960. She is the daughter of the composer [[Alexander Goehr]] and granddaughter of [[Walter Goehr]]. She received her Ph.D. from [[Cambridge University]], where her dissertation on the ontology of music was supervised by [[Bernard Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Jacobs, et al. "Goehr." Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 30 Mar. 2013 &lt;http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/53781pg3&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to her permanent appointment at Columbia, Goehr has accepted a number of visiting appointments, including a position as Visiting Ernest Bloch Professor at [[UC Berkeley]]'s music department in 1997, as the visiting Aby Warburg Professor at the [[University of Hamburg]] in 2002-2003, as a visiting professor at the [[Free University of Berlin|Freie Universität]] in [[Berlin]] in 2008, and as a visiting professor in the Fu-Berlin SFB Theater und Fest in 2009.&lt;ref name=obio/&gt;

Goehr has written three books, co-edited a fourth, and has published numerous articles in the philosophy of music and critical theory. Her first book, ''The Imaginary Museum of Musical Works: An Essay in the Philosophy of Music'' (Clarendon Press, Oxford), was published in 1992, and has since been translated into Greek, Chinese and Italian. Her second book, ''A Quest for Voice: On Music, Politics, and the Limits of Philosophy'' (Clarendon Press, Oxford), is based on the Bloch Lectures, delivered at the University of California, Berkeley in 1997. Her third book, published in 2008, is ''Elective Affinities: Musical Essays on the History of Aesthetic Theory'' (Columbia University Press).

Goehr's work focuses on the history of aesthetic theory, attempting to understand the relational nature of norms and power dynamics with the structure that confines them and regulates their practice.&lt;ref name=apacsw&gt;{{cite web|last=DesAutels|first=Peggy|title=Lydia Goehr: November 2013|url=http://www.apaonlinecsw.org/home/woman_philosopher/lydiagoehrnovember|publisher=American Philosophical Association|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of her work has focused on the musical arts, and some of it has explored the complicated and often hostile relationship between the various arts, and between the arts and philosophy and religion.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt;  She has also engaged with ideas about the legitimacy of war from a [[critical theory]] standpoint, as well as dealt with the [[philosophy of history]] and the [[history of philosophy]].

Goehr has received several awards for her research as well as for her teaching of undergraduate students and mentoring of graduate students. She has been a recipient of the Getty and Guggenheim Fellowships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gf.org/search?search=goehr&amp;x=-1119&amp;y=-67 |title= Guggenheim Fellowships |publisher= Guggenheim Foundation |date= |accessdate=2013-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apaonlinecsw.org/home/woman_philosopher/lydiagoehrnovember |title=The American Philosophical Association's Committee on the Status of Women |publisher=APA |date= |accessdate=2013-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, Goehr was awarded the H.

In 2005, Goehr was a winner of the Columbia University Presidential Award for Outstanding Teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/vpaa/teach/docs/prior_winners_fac.html |title=Columbia University Presidential Teaching Awards |publisher=Columbia University |date= |accessdate=2013-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage''' is a [[minister (government)|minister]] in the government of New Zealand with responsibility for arts, culture, heritage, and broadcasting, and is in charge of the [[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]]. The position was established in 1975 as Minister for the Arts.

The present Minister is [[Jacinda Ardern]], the current [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] and leader the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ministerial List|url=https://www.dpmc.govt.nz/our-business-units/cabinet-office/ministers-and-their-portfolios/ministerial-list|publisher=[[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (New Zealand)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]]|accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[Third National Government of New Zealand]] established a ministerial portfolio with responsibility for the arts at its election in 1975. This reflected a growing interest of the Government in the cultural sector.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mch.govt.nz/about-ministry/overview/history-government-involvement-culture|title=History of Government involvement in culture|website=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the portfolio changed to "Minister for Arts and Culture" in 1987. During this period, the portfolio was serviced by the [[Department of Internal Affairs (New Zealand)|Department of Internal Affairs]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

A separate portfolio, Minister responsible for the [[New Zealand Symphony Orchestra]], was established in 1987. This was held first by [[Jonathan Hunt (New Zealand politician)|Jonathan Hunt]] (24 August 1987—9 February 1990)&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ministers and Members in the New Zealand Parliament|editor=G.A. Wood|edition=2nd|publisher=University of Otago Press|location=Dunedin|pages=68–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently by [[Margaret Austin]] (also the Minister for Arts and Culture; 9 February 1990—2 November 1990)&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt; before being subsumed back into the responsibilities of the Minister for Arts and Culture.

A standalone agency, the Ministry for Cultural Affairs, was established by the [[Fourth National Government of New Zealand|Fourth National Government]] in 1991, which necessitated the change of title to "Minister for Cultural Affairs." With the creation of the [[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]] in 1999, which brought together cultural and heritage responsibilities in the same agency, the portfolio title changed to match its department. The present name was adopted in November 1999 at the election of the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fifth Labour Government]].

[[File:Ruba'is by Hafiz - Nasta'liq script.jpg|thumb|some verses in Persian [[nasta'liq]] script, probably always a single page meant for a ''muraqqa''; 16-17th century]]

A '''Muraqqa''' ({{lang-tr|Murakka}}, {{lang-ar|مورّقة}}, {{lang-fa|مُرَقّع}}) is an album in book form containing Islamic miniature paintings and specimens of [[Islamic calligraphy]], normally from several different sources, and perhaps other matter.  The album was popular among collectors in the Islamic world, and by the later 16th century became the predominant format for miniature painting in the Persian [[Safavid]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] and [[Ottoman empire]]s, greatly affecting the direction taken by the painting traditions of the [[Persian miniature]], [[Ottoman miniature]] and [[Mughal miniature]].&lt;ref&gt;Froom. (2001), 1.; Rizvi, 800&lt;/ref&gt;  The album largely replaced the full-scale illustrated manuscript of classics of [[Persian poetry]], which had been the typical vehicle for the finest miniature painters up to that time.  The great cost and delay of commissioning a top-quality example of such a work essentially restricted them to the ruler and a handful of other great figures, who usually had to maintain a whole workshop of calligraphers, artists and other craftsmen, with a librarian to manage the whole process.  An album could be compiled over time, page by page, and often included miniatures and pages of calligraphy from older books that were broken up for this purpose, and allowed a wider circle of collectors access to the best painters and calligraphers, although they were also compiled by, or presented to, shahs and emperors.  The earliest ''muraqqa'' were of pages of calligraphy only; it was at the court in [[Herat]] of the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] prince [[Baysunghur]] in the early 15th century that the form became important for miniature painting.  The word ''muraqqa'' means "that which has been patched together" in [[Farsi|Persian]].&lt;ref&gt;Froom, 1-2; Thackston, vii&lt;/ref&gt;

The works in an album, typically of different original sizes, were trimmed or mounted on standard size pages, often with new border decoration being added. When the compilation was considered complete it was bound, often very luxuriously, with an [[Islamic book-cover]] that might be highly decorated with [[lacquer]]ed paint, gold stamping on leather, or other techniques.  Other ''muraqqa'' might be bound in a special [[concertina]]-like form.  Many were arranged with pages of calligraphy facing miniatures, the matching of verse to image allowing some scope for the creativity of the compiler.&lt;ref&gt;A regular theme of prefaces - see Roxburgh, 111-112&lt;/ref&gt;  Albums containing only calligraphy tended to be arranged chronologically to show the development of a style.  The bindings of many albums allowed items to be added and removed, or they were just removed from the centre of the page, and such changes were often made; some albums had marks which allow changes to be traced.&lt;ref&gt;Froom, 5-6&lt;/ref&gt; The grandest albums had specially written prefaces which are the source of a high proportion of surviving contemporary writing on the arts of the book, and the biographies of painters and calligraphers; these tended to be written by calligraphers.  For calligraphers too the single page for an album became the "bread and butter" source of income,&lt;ref&gt;Canby, quote on 47&lt;/ref&gt; using mostly texts from poetry, whether extracts from a long classic or [[ghazal]] lyrics, but sometimes an extract from the [[Qur'an]], perhaps given the place of honour at the start of the album.  Album pages often have areas of [[Ottoman illumination|decorated illumination]] (as in the illustration) that share their motifs with other media, notably book-covers and carpet designs, the best of which were in fact probably mostly produced by the same type of artist at court, and sent to the weavers.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, 42-49, 45 on Qur'an, 83 on carpets.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the classic Islamic [[illuminated manuscript]] tradition had concentrated on rather crowded scenes with strong narrative content as illustrations in full texts of classic and lengthy works like the ''[[Shahnameh]]'' and the ''[[Khamsa of Nizami]]'', the single miniature intended from the start for a ''muraqqa'' soon developed as a simpler scene with fewer, larger, figures, often showing idealized beauties of either sex in a garden setting, or genre figures from nomadic life, usually with no real or fictional identities attached to them.  In Mughal India realistic portraiture, nearly always of rulers or courtiers, became a very common feature, and in Ottoman Turkey portraits of the Sultans, often very stylised, were a particular speciality.  Fully coloured scenes tended to give way to part-drawn and part-painted ones, or to figures with little or no background.  The album to some extent overlaps with the anthology, a collection of different pieces where the main emphasis is on the texts, but which can also include paintings and drawings inserted from different sources.

==Shift to the album==

===Persia===
The dominant tradition of miniature painting in the late [[Middle Ages]] was that of [[Persia]], which had a number of centres, but all usually dependent on one key patron, whether the shah himself, or a figure either governing a part of the country from a centre such as [[Herat]], where Baysunghur was an important patron in the early 15th century, or the ruler of a further part of the [[Persianate]] world in a centre like [[Bukhara]].  As the [[Safavid dynasty]] centralized Persian rule in the 16th century the number of potential partrons of a full-size atelier declined, but the atelier of the shah expanded and produced a number of superb illustrated books, using a variety of very talented artists on each.  However, in the 1540s Shah [[Tahmasp I]], previously a keen patron, lost interest in commissioning books, and thereafter the Persian miniature painting tradition lacked a steady source of commissions for books in the old style.  After a gap of some years, Tahmasp's nephew [[Ibrahim Mirza]] established an atelier at [[Mashad]], which produced the [[Freer Jami]] in the 1560s, and which Shah [[Ismail II of Persia|Ismail II]] took over after having its former patron killed in 1577.  But Ismail's reign was very brief, and thereafter consistent large-scale patronage was lacking.  It was in this period that the single miniature designed for inserting in an album came to be dominant; such works had long been produced, but now they became the main source of income for many artists, who probably often produced them speculatively with no commission, and then looked to sell them (little is known about the market for album miniatures).&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 113-114; Riza; Brend, 165-166&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist who epitomises the Persian album miniature is [[Riza Abbasi]], active from the 1580s until his death in 1635, whose early single miniatures of groups are somewhat like those in narrative scenes, but lacking any actual narrative attached to them.  He soon turned to, and developed, subjects mostly of one or two figures, often portrait-like, although very few identities are given or were probably ever intended to be recognised. There are a large number of beautiful youths, to whose clothes great attention is paid.&lt;ref&gt;Riza&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
[[File:Sarayi Album 145ba.jpg|thumb|15th century portrait of [[Mehmet II]] (1432-1481), showing Italian influence]]
The best Ottoman painting was heavily concentrated in the capital, which from 1453 was [[Istanbul]], and the most important patron was always the Sultan.  The royal library remains very largely intact in Turkey, mostly at [[Topkapi Palace]], and was greatly enriched by Persian manuscripts, initially taken during the several Ottoman invasions of eastern Persia, and later, after a treaty in 1555, often received as [[diplomatic gift]]s.  Many of these manuscripts were broken up to use the miniatures in albums.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 133-135&lt;/ref&gt;  Persian artists were imported from virtually the start of the Ottoman tradition, but especially in the 16th century; sixteen artists were brought back just from the brief Ottoman conquest of [[Tabriz]] in 1514, though by 1558 the palace records list only nine foreign artists of all kinds, against twenty-six Turks. But a distinctively Ottoman style can be seen from the start of the 16th century, with pictures showing simpler landscape backgrounds, more sea and ships, neatly tented army camps, distant cityscapes, more individual characterization of faces, but also a less refined technique.  There was strong European influence, mostly from [[Venice]], but this was restricted to portraiture.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 136-142&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkish albums include mixtures of collected miniatures similar to those in Persia, and often including Persian pieces, with the addition of rather more greatly elaborated pen drawings of an essentially decorative nature, of a foliage motif, or a bird or animal treated largely as such.  Albums dedicated to the sultans, with portraits and laudatory pieces of text, are a distinctive Turkish type, and there were also albums of scenes of Turkish life, showing the relatively uniform costume of different ranks in society, methods of torture and execution, and other scenes of interest to the mostly Western foreigners they were produced for, matching similar [[Old master print|prints]] made in contemporary Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 151, 157-158&lt;/ref&gt;

One very distinctive type of miniature is found only in Ottoman albums, though they may have been brought from Persia as booty, and perhaps were not intended for albums originally.  These are eighty or so the mysterious and powerful images grouped under the name of [[Siyah Qalam]], meaning "Black Pen" (or drunk or evil pen), full of demons and scenes which suggest nomadic life in Central Asia, though it has also been suggested that they come from a single Persian court artist letting himself go.  They are perhaps from the early 15th century, reaching Turkey in the 16th.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 37; Walther &amp; Wolf, 254-255&lt;/ref&gt;

Another distinctive type of Ottoman work is the [[découpage]] or cut paper miniature, where different colours of paper, cut with minute detail then pasted together, are used to create the image.  This technique was used for book-covers in Timurid Persia, which were then varnished over for protection, but in Turkey the images were treated as miniatures and went inside albums; the technique was also much used for page border decoration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/a/a_lion_attacking_a_deer.aspx ''A lion attacking a deer'', stencilled scene of découpage paper shapes] British Museum; Titley, 158, 229, 242&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian subcontinent===
[[File:Five Recruits- Ummee Chund, Indur, Goolzaree, Bukhtawur and Juhaz - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[Company style]] miniature of ''Five Recruits'' to a British Indian military unit, c. 1815]] 
The [[Mughal dynasty]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]] was rather later in establishing a large court atelier, which did not begin until after the exile in Persia of the second emperor, [[Humayun]], who on his return was joined from about 1549 by Persian artists including [[Abd as-Samad]].  The Mughal style developed under the next emperor, [[Akbar]], who commissioned some very large illustrated books, but his artists produced single miniatures for albums as well.  In the case of the [[Jahangirnama]], the emperor [[Jahangir]] kept a diary and commissioned paintings separately, which were most likely held in the [[Kitabkhana]] (किताबखाना), until his official contribution to the court chronicle genre could be assembled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=T_QNAQAAMAAJ|title=The Jahangirnama|last=Freer Gallery of Art and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery|first=Smithsonian Institution|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Foreword by Milo Cleveland Beach|year=1999|isbn=0195127188|editor-last=Shaner|editor-first=Lynne|location=New York|pages=vi–vii|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From fairly early the Mughal style made a strong feature of realistic portraiture, usually in profile, and perhaps influenced by Western prints, which were available at the Mughal court.  For a long time portraits were always of men, often accompanied by generalized female servants or [[concubine]]s; but there is scholarly debate about the representation of female court members in portraiture. Some scholars claim there are no known extant likenesses of figures like [[Jahanara Begum]] and [[Mumtaz Mahal]], and others attribute miniatures, for example from the [[Dara Shikoh]] album or the [[Freer Gallery of Art]] mirror portrait, to these famous noblewomen.&lt;ref&gt;Crill and Jariwala, 23-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BDl3MAEACAAJ&amp;dq=the+mughal+empire,+art+culture+and+empire|title=Mughal India: Art, Culture and Empire Manuscripts and Paintings in the British Library|last=Losty|first=J.P.|last2=Roy|first2=Malini|publisher=The British Library|year=2012|isbn=9780712358705|location=London|pages=132–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abid.

F2005.4 [http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/edan/object.php?q=fsg_F2005.4&amp;bcrumb=true]&lt;/ref&gt; Another popular subject area was realistic studies of animals and plants, mostly flowers; from the 17th century equestrian portraits, mostly of rulers, became another popular borrowing from the West.&lt;ref&gt;Crill and Jariwala, 68&lt;/ref&gt;  The single idealized figure of the Riza Abbasi type was less popular, but fully painted scenes of lovers in a palace setting became popular later.  Drawings of genre scenes, especially showing holy men, whether Muslim or Hindu, were also popular.

Akbar had an album, now dispersed, consisting entirely of portraits of figures at his enormous court which had a practical purpose; according to chroniclers he used to consult it when discussing appointments and the like with his advisors, apparently to jog his memory of who the people being discussed were.  Many of them, like medieval European images of saints, carried objects associated with them to help identification, but otherwise the figures stand on a plain background.&lt;ref&gt;Crill and Jariwala, 66&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of fine portraits of Akbar, but it was under his successors [[Jahangir]] and Shah Jahan that the portrait of the ruler became firmly established as a leading subject in Indian miniature painting, which was to spread to both Muslim and Hindu princely courts across India.&lt;ref&gt;Crill and Jariwala, 27-39, and catalogue entries&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th and 19th centuries Indian artists working in the hybrid Indo-European [[Company style]] produced albums of miniatures for Europeans living in India as part of the [[British Raj]] and its French and Portuguese equivalents.  Some Europeans collected or were given earlier Indian miniatures; the Large and Small Clive albums were presented to [[Lord Clive]], and are now in the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O86414/painting-a-flower-study/ Small Clive album] [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Others created albums of new work, tending to concentrate on animal portraits and the houses, horses and other possessions of this wealthy group.  In the 19th century images of Indians and their costumes, often categorized by regional and ethnic type, or occupation, became very popular.  Large-scale patrons included Colonel [[James Skinner (soldier)|James Skinner]] of Skinner's Horse fame, who had a [[Rajput]] mother, and for natural history paintings, [[Mary Impey]], wife of [[Elijah Impey]], who commissioned over three hundred, and the [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley|Marquess Wellesley]], brother of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|first Duke of Wellington]], who had over 2,500 miniatures.

==Use of albums==
[[File:Emperor Jahangir receiving his two sons, an album-painting in gouache on paper, c 1605-06.jpg|thumb|Manohar, Emperor [[Jahangir]] receiving his two sons, an album-painting in gouache on paper, c. 1605-6]]
Albums were often presented as gifts to mark a milestone in life.  Chroniclers record that when the Persian Prince [[Ibrahim Mirza]] was killed in 1577, on the orders of Shah [[Tahmasp I]], his wife, Tahmasp's sister, destroyed artworks including an album containing miniatures by [[Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād|Behzad]] among others, which her husband had compiled and given her for their wedding, washing the miniatures in water.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 105&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps she did not want anything to fall into the hands of her brother, who had ordered his death, and who did take over the prince's atelier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akdn.org/museum/detail.asp?artifactid=1731 Aga Khan Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724231354/http://www.akdn.org/museum/detail.asp?artifactid=1731 |date=2011-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Albums were often presented to rulers on their accession, or in Turkey at New Year. They could also be given as diplomatic gifts between rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Tanidi, 1&lt;/ref&gt;

A muraqqa was created for Sultan [[Murad III]] in 1572 when he ascended to the throne, which is unusual because the dedication is very detailed, including the date and place of creation, namely Istanbul, 980 AH/1572-73 AD.&lt;ref&gt;A. E.Froom, (2001). "Collecting Tastes: A Muraqqa’ for Sultan Murad III". Electronic Journal of Oriental Studies IV: 19, pp. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The dedication is to Murad III, also naming his compiler Mehmed Cenderecizade. The Murad III muraqqa was designed much more extravagantly than other Islamic muraqqa and with original nakkashane (Ottoman painting studio) border paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Emine F. Fetvaci, (2005). "Viziers to Eunuchs: Transitions in Ottoman Manuscript Patronage, 1566--1617." Unpublished PhD Dissertation, Harvard University. pp. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; This muraqqa contained miniature paintings, ink drawings, and calligraphy, including [[ghazals]].  The Murad III muraqqa has twenty-four miniatures created in the cities of [[Bukhara]] to the east of Persia, [[Tabriz]], [[Isfahan]], and [[Qazvin]] in Persia, and [[Istanbul]] between the late fifteenth and seventeenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;A. E.Froom, (2001). "Collecting Tastes: A Muraqqa’ for Sultan Murad III". Electronic Journal of Oriental Studies IV: 19, p. 2, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has a two-page introduction written in Persian, which is similar in structure to [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] and [[Safavid]] album prefaces, and indicates that this muraqqa was compiled in Istanbul less than two years before Murad III became Sultan.&lt;ref&gt;E.Froom, (2001). "Collecting Tastes: A Muraqqa’ for Sultan Murad III". Electronic Journal of Oriental Studies IV: 19, p. 4.; Sheila S. Blair. (2000). "Color and Gold: The Decorated Papers Used in Manuscripts in Later Islamic Times." Muqarnas. 17. pp. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another album in the Ottoman royal collection contains only Western images, mostly [[old master print|prints]] but including a drawing in pen of an ''Ornamental Scroll with [[Putti]] and Penises'', "for the merriment of adult guests at a dinner in [[Beyoğlu|Pera]]".  The collection was probably assembled for a [[Florence|Florentine]] in the late 15th century, probably a merchant living in Istanbul (where Pera was the quarter for Westerners).  The other 15 images are a mixed group of Florentine [[engraving]]s, mostly unique impressions (i.e. otherwise unknown), with some religious subjects and a coloured print of [[Mehmet II]], who apparently acquired the album.  It is of interest to art historians because only a small handful of early albums of Western prints survive anywhere, having been broken up by later collectors or dealers; they were probably common among collectors in Europe at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Landau &amp; Parshall, 91-95; one might query the title, as the "putti" are rather rough-looking adults.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples from the Mughal Court ===

* ''The Salim album'', produced in the reign of [[Akbar the Great]], contains both Christian images and portraits of Hindu courtiers.
* ''The Minto Albums'', from the reign of [[Shah Jahan]], contains miniatures depicting royal courtiers, gardens, and images of wildlife, surrounded by elaborate floral borders.
* ''The Shah Jahan Album'', now dispersed, as it was split up by Demotte, a European dealer.

== In modern times  ==
[[Abdur Rahman Chughtai]] was a painter who was responsible for the revival of the muraqqa in [[Pakistan]] in 1928 after publishing his Muraqqa-I Chughtai. When he started painting in the 1910s his major influence was [[Hindu mythology]], but by the 1920s he was inspired by Islamic artwork including the muraqqa, [[ghazals]], and [[Ottoman miniature]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Iftikhar Dadi, (2006). "Miniature Painting as Muslim Cosmopolitanism" ISIM Review: International Institute for the Study of Islam in the Modern World. No. 18 pp. 53. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the emergent tools of [[digital humanities]], Sumathi Ramaswamy at [[Duke University]] has recreated the form of a Mughal muraqqa’ to track the itineraries of the [[terrestrial globe]] in early modern [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;Sumathi Ramaswamy, ‘Going Global in Mughal India’ (http://sites.duke.edu/globalinmughalindia/)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Music for Electric Metronomes''''' is an [[avant-garde]] [[Aleatoric music|aleatoric]] composition written in 1960 by Japanese composer [[Toshi Ichiyanagi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|url=https://scholarship.rice.edu/bitstream/handle/1911/64647/SASAKI-THESIS.pdf|title=Trio Webster: Toshi Ichiyanagi's Fusion of Western and Eastern Music|type=Doctor of Music Arts thesis|first=Maiko|last=Sasaki|page=9|publisher=Rice University|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; for any number of performers between three and eight. The piece involves the manipulation of electric [[metronome]]s, followed by various unspecified sounds and actions. It is a very theatrical piece,&lt;ref&gt;Ichiyanagi, Toshi. [http://www.edition-peters.de/product/music-for-electric-metronomes/ep66148 ''Music for Electric Metronomes'', Theatre Piece], [[Edition Peters]]&lt;/ref&gt; and reflects Ichiyanagi's affiliation with [[Fluxus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Experimental Music: Cage and Beyond|first=Michael|last=Nyman|authorlink=Michael Nyman|chapter=Indeterminacy 1960–70|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=9780521653831|page=111|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; an experimental art movement from the sixties. The only true scored "instrument" is an electric metronome for each individual player,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Marianne Williams Tobias|title=Classical Music Without Fear: A Guide for General Audiences|page=74|publisher=Inidiana University Press|year=2003|isbn=9780253216182}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the varying sounds and/or actions may involve many different instruments and objects at the discretion of the performer. Because the [[Graphic notation (music)|graphic notation]] of the [[sheet music|score]] – a series of dashes, lines, and numbers in an erratic pattern of connected paths – leaves room for personal interpretation and expression, each performance is unique, and almost certainly cannot be reproduced. There is no [[conducting|conductor]] for the performance. It has been recorded on the album ''Toshi Ichiyanagi: 1960's &amp; 1990's''.&lt;ref&gt;{{AllMusic|class=album|id=mr0002091556|label=Toshi Ichiyanagi: 1960's &amp; 1990's|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of a performance by the [[S.E.M. Ensemble]] in 1992 at the [[Paula Cooper Gallery]], the music critic of ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]], described the piece as "merely a timid, spastic prelude to [[György Ligeti]]'s monumental ''[[Poème symphonique]]" for 100 metronomes".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/24/arts/review-music-sem-evokes-john-cage-as-teacher.html "Review/Music; S.E.M. Evokes John Cage as Teacher"] by [[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 24 December 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

==Score==

The score for ''Music for Electric Metronomes'' consists of a diagram featuring series of dashes, lines, and numbers in an erratic pattern of connected paths accompanied by a set of directions. Each player looks at the score and chooses a path, starting from one "end" of the score, and finishing at another. There are 10 "ends" to start and finish with. This path should culminate in about 8 minutes worth of actions, sounds, and metronome manipulation. Once the player has chosen their path, they will use numbers as guides for meter and duration, and various types of lines as a guide to choosing their actions and sounds. Each player will begin at their respective ends, and start the metronome at the BPM (beats-per-minute) designated by their starting number. Then, using the amount of beats specified, they will gradually adjust the [[tempo]] of the metronome to the next designated BPM on their path. The connecting line between these BPMs is what specifies the action(s) or sound(s) that follow:&lt;ref&gt;[http://post.at.moma.org/content_items/90-toshi-ichiyanagi-and-the-art-of-indeterminacy "Toshi Ichiyanagi and the Art of Indeterminacy"], seminar by Yayoi Uno Everett, [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, 15 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
* A straight, unbroken line means that no action will follow the metronome change. A single curved unbroken line stands for a single action, such as walking. An unbroken line with two or more curves means to make two more actions.
* A straight, dotted line means to make a single physical sound, such as clapping or voice sounds. A single curved dotted line means to make any number of physical sounds of one kind. A dotted line with two or more curves means to make two or more physical sounds of different kinds.
* A straight, zig-zag line means to make a single sound using an external object like an instrument or machine. A single curved zig-zag line means to make any number of sounds using a single external object. A zig-zag line with two or more curves means to make two or more sounds using external objects from two or more sources.

The '''Mythopoeic Society''' ('''MythSoc''') is a non-profit organization devoted to the study of [[Mythopoeia|mythopoeic]] literature, particularly the works of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[Charles Williams (UK writer)|Charles Williams]], and [[C. S. Lewis]], all members of [[The Inklings]], an informal group of writers who met weekly in C.S. Lewis’ rooms at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], from the early 1930s through late 1949.

== History ==
The Mythopoeic Society was founded in 1967 by [[Glen H. GoodKnight]]. Originally composed of discussion groups based in the [[Los Angeles]] area, it expanded to include organized branches across North America; in 1972 it assimilated the Tolkien Society of America. Membership is open to those who read, study, or write in the genres of myth and fantasy.

== Publications ==
Three periodical publications are produced by the society:
* ''Mythprint'' is a quarterly newsletter with notices of Society activity, book reviews and articles;&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.mythsoc.org/mythprint/mythprint-history.htm "Mythprint: History and Back Issues"] Mythopoeic Society. Retrieved 2017-01-06.&lt;/ref&gt; Mythopoeic Society membership includes electronic Mythprint (PDF), also available in print format by subscription.
* ''[[Mythlore]]'', edited by [[Janet Brennan Croft]], publishes peer-reviewed articles on mythic and fantastic works, available by subscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7LGmdAPdwDgC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=Janet+Brennan+Croft&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Fe0SUIL2CfLc4QTdk4CADA&amp;ved=0CF8Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Janet%20Brennan%20Croft&amp;f=false |title=Die aktuelle Tolkienforschung im Überblick: Personen – Organisationen – Verlage – Werke |trans-title=A Survey of Research on Tolkien: People – Organisations – Publishers – Works |language=German |first=Frank |last=Weinreich |first2=Thomas |last2=Honegger |pages=63–89 |journal=Zeitschrift für Fantastikforschung |year=2011 |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Mythic Circle]]'' is a collection of original fiction and poetry, published yearly, available by subscription.

In addition to the periodicals, the society formed [http://www.mythsoc.org/press.htm The Mythopoeic Press] to publish material by and about writers of mythopoeic and fantastic literature, especially focused on The Inklings. Works published include out-of-print materials, collections of short articles and essays, and scholarly items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mythopoeic Press|url=http://www.mythsoc.org/press.htm|publisher=Mythopoeic Society|accessdate=April 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
The society sponsors local discussion groups throughout the United States and the ''Annual Mythopoeic Conference'', also known as ''Mythcon'', generally held on college or university campuses in various locations, primarily within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mythsoc.org/mythcon.htm Mythopoeic Conferences] Mythopoeic Society. Retrieved 2017-01-06.&lt;/ref&gt; Mythcon XX was held in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1989. Mythcon XXIII was held at Keble College, Oxford, England, in 1992 as part of ''The J.R.R. Tolkien Centenary Conference'', co-sponsored with [[The Tolkien Society]]. Likewise, Mythcon XXXVI in 2005 was held at Aston University, Birmingham, England, combined with ''Tolkien 2005 - 50 Years of The Lord of the Rings'', sponsored by The Tolkien Society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mythsoc.org/mythcon/mythcon-history.htm History of Mythopoeic Conferences] Mythopoeic Society. Retrieved 2017-01-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mythopoeic Awards ==
{{main|Mythopoeic Awards}}
Since 1971 the Mythopoeic Society has bestowed a series of [http://www.mythsoc.org/awards.htm annual awards] to outstanding works. In 1991 the literary award was broken into two categories: the ''Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Adult Literature'' and the ''Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Children’s Literature''.

The ''Mythopoeic Scholarship Award in Inklings Studies'' is given to books on J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, and/or Charles Williams that make significant contributions to Inklings scholarship. The ''Mythopoeic Scholarship Award in Myth and Fantasy Studies'' is given to scholarly books on other specific authors in the Inklings tradition, or to more general works on the genres of myth and fantasy. For the scholarship awards, books first published during the previous three years are eligible, including finalists for previous years.

'''The National Library of Iran''' (NLI) is located in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]], with several branches scattered throughout the city.

Prior to the library's official inauguration in 1937, other libraries existed that performed the same function informally. The first prototype of a [[national library]] in Iran was the Library of [[Dar ul-Funun (Persia)|Dar al-Funun College]], established in 1851. In 1899, another library called the "Nation's Library" was inaugurated in [[Tehran]].&lt;ref&gt;Murray, S. (2009). The library : an illustrated history / Stuart A.P. Murray ; introduction by Donald G. Davis, Jr. ; foreword by Nicholas A. Basbanes. New York, NY : [[Skyhorse Pub.]] ; Chicago : ALA Editions, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The present National Library of Iran incorporates many different collections from older libraries, including many rare and valuable [[manuscript]]s. The central main branch is located in north central Tehran.

The new building is specially designed to combine different faculties of the library in a single platform. The library by itself is over 90,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the largest library campus in the Middle East. It encompasses 5 separate halls, each hall dedicated to a different faculty, including Humanities, Social Sciences, Law, Science and Science Education, and Health Studies.

It took over the publishing of the ''[[Iranian National Bibliography]]'' (''Ketab Shenasi Melli Iran''), with annual publications between 1962 and 1966, a break for two years, and then monthly and quartly since 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Libraries in the East: an International and Comparative Study | chapter = Iran | pages = 39–50 | author = George Chandler | year = 1971 | publisher = [[Seminar Press]] | isbn = 0-12-815550-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science | editor = [[Allen Kent]] |editor2=Harold Lancour |editor3=Jay E.

'''Pithora''' is a highly ritualistic painting done on the walls by several tribes such as the [[Rathwa]]s and [[Bhilala]]s who live in the central [[Gujarat]], , in a village called [[Tejgadh]]. In several other villages around Tejgadh (even in [[Madhya Pradesh]]) and [[Chhota Udaipur district]] , lives a large population of these tribes where we find Pithora paintings on three inner walls of the house. These paintings have significance in their lives and executing the Pithora paintings in their homes brings peace, prosperity and happiness. What is even more interesting is that there is never an attempt to imitate nature. A horse or a bull, which might be a vision of a God, impresses him with only one central quality. This central quality is worked upon and given a form. It might be crude but it is this crudity that adds to the beauty of this painting.

[[File:Pithora wall painting.JPG|thumbnail|right|A Pithora painting at the [[National Handicrafts and Handlooms Museum, New Delhi|Crafts Museum]] in New Delhi]]
Pithora paintings are more of a ritual than an art form. These rituals are performed either to thank God or for a wish or a boon to be granted. The Bhadwa or the head priest of the tribe is summoned and the problems are narrated. These problems can vary from dying cattle, to unwell children in the family. The concerned person is given a solution and is asked, by the Bhadwa, to perform the ritual and the painting. The presence of Pithora Baba is considered as a solution to all the problems. A Pithora is always located at the threshold, or the Osari, outside the first front wall or inside on the walls of the first room as one enters a house. The painting usually floods the entire wall with figures. Three walls are prepared for the painting, the front wall and the two on either side of it. The front or central wall is very large, twice the size of each of the sidewalls. These walls are treated with two layers of cow dung paste and one layer of white chalk powder. Unmarried girls bring in these materials. This procedure is called Lipna. The main wall of the verandah that divides it from the kitchen is considered sacred to the Pithoro. The wall paintings related to the legends of creation and Pithoro, are done on this wall. The two sidewalls of the veranda are also painted with figures of minor deities, ghosts and ancestors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3547">[[File:Banquet Still Life, Adriaen van Utrecht, 1644 - Rijksmuseum.jpg|333px|thumb|''Pronkstilleven'' by Adriaen van Utrecht, 1644]]

'''''Pronkstilleven''''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]] for 'ostentatious', 'ornate' or 'sumptuous' still life) is a style of ornate [[still life]] painting, which was developed in the 1640s in [[Antwerp]] from where it spread quickly to the [[Dutch Republic]]. 

==Development==
Flemish artists such as [[Frans Snyders]] and [[Adriaen van Utrecht]] started to paint still lifes that emphasized abundance by depicting a diversity of objects, fruits, flowers and dead game, often together with living people and animals.

The style was soon adopted by artists from the Dutch Republic.&lt;ref name=ox&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/pronkstilleven Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms: Pronkstilleven]&lt;/ref&gt;  A leading Dutch representative was [[Jan Davidsz. de Heem]], who spent a long period of his active career in Antwerp and was one of the founders of the style in Holland.&lt;ref name=rkd&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/36842 Jan Davidsz. de Heem] at the Netherlands Institute for Art History {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermitage.nl/nl/pers/rubens_van_dyck_en_jordaens/achtergrond.htm [[Ben van Beneden]], ''Massijs, Rubens, Van Dyck en de anderen.]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Schilderkunst in Antwerpen, 1500-1650'' {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other leading representatives in Flanders and the Dutch Republic were [[Nicolaes van Verendael]], [[Alexander Coosemans]], [[Carstian Luyckx]], [[Jasper Geeraards]], [[Peter Willebeeck]], [[Abraham van Beyeren]] and [[Willem Kalf]].&lt;ref name=ox/&gt;

[[Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts]] developed the style further by incorporating pronkstillevens in the [[trompe-l'œil]] compositions for which he was known.  An example is his ''[[:File:Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts - Silverware in an Open Cabinet.jpg|Silverware in an Open Cabinet]]'' at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent]].&lt;ref name=gijs&gt;[http://barokinvlaanderen.vlaamsekunstcollectie.be/nl/collectie/pronkstilleven-in-openstaande-kast Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts, ''Pronkstilleven in an open cabinet''] at barokinvlaanderen {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Meaning==
[[File:Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts - Silverware in an Open Cabinet.jpg|thumb|''Silverware in an Open Cabinet'' by Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts]]
Pronkstillevens are usually interpreted as a form of [[vanitas]] painting that conveys a moral lesson.  The various objects in the compositions serve as symbols that can be read as an admonition or a life lesson. The objects usually refer to the transience and emptiness of wealth and possessions and the ultimate extinction and emptiness of earthly life.

For instance, roses are often used as a vanitas motif, as they recall that all life and earthly beauty are fleeting. Hourglasses are an admonition that life is fleeting and will end.  Empty containers such as glasses or vases point to the emptiness of earthly wealth and aspirations.  The paintings remind the viewer of the need to practice moderation and temperance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tento.be/OKV-artikel/abraham-van-beyeren-pronk-stilleven L.J., Bol, ''Abraham van Beyeren - Pronk-stilleven''] at okv {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedman]]. The organization presents contemporary art in New York City's public spaces through a series of highly visible artists' projects, new commissions, installations, and exhibitions that are emblematic of the organization's mission and innovative history.

==History==
Public Art Fund was founded in 1977 by [[Doris Freedman|Doris C. Freedman]] who served as the first Director of [[New York City]]'s [[New York City Department of Cultural Affairs|Department of Cultural Affairs]], the President of the [[Municipal Art Society]], and a tireless supporter of New York City's Percent for Art legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcla/html/panyc/percent-for-art.shtml|title=Percent for Art - NYC Department of Cultural Affairs|website=www.nyc.gov|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public Art Fund was born from the merger of two preexisting organizations, CityWalls, which was founded in 1966, and the Public Arts Council, founded in 197). Working with artists and museums,  Public Art Fund works to bring artwork outside of traditional spaces and into the public sphere. Since its inception, Public Art Fund has presented more than 500 artists' exhibitions and projects at sites throughout New York City's five boroughs as varied as streets, plazas, parks, buses, billboards, and even major landmarks including [[Times Square]], [[Rockefeller Center]], the [[Brooklyn Bridge Park]], [[Columbus Circle]], and [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]]. [[Susan Freedman|Susan K. Freedman]] has served as president since 1986. Nicholas Baume joined Public Art Fund as Director and Chief Curator in 2009 and Jill Kraus has been Chairman of the Board of Directors since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/top200/jill-and-peter-kraus/|title=Jill and Peter Kraus -|website=ARTnews|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public Programs ==
In addition to presenting works of art, Public Art Fund also hosts additional programs including Public Art Fund Talks. This series encompasses discussions and presentations from today's most influential artist. Another program, In the Public Realm,  is an open call which allows emerging artist to conceive and develop innovative ideas for public works. Public Art Fund also releases a semi annual magazine and exhibition catalog which provides its audience with a summary of the organizations activities and achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nyc-arts.org/organizations/218/public-art-fund|title=Public Art Fund - NYC-ARTS|work=NYC-ARTS|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Highlighted Public Projects in New York City==
Public Art Fund has collaborated with many New York City institutions, including the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] for the [[Whitney Biennial]], Outdoors in [[Central Park]](2002&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whitney.org/www/2002biennial/cpark.html|title=Whitney Biennial in Central Park Organized by the Public Art Fund|last=|first=|date=|website=Whitney|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.publicartfund.org/projects/list/whitney_biennials|title=Whitney Biennials|last=|first=|date=|website=Public Art Fund|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the [[Museum of Modern Art]] for [[Francis Alÿs]]’ ''The Modern Procession'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/151?locale=en|title=Projects 76: Francis Alÿs {{!}} MoMA|last=|first=|date=|website=Museum of Modern Art|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early exhibition highlights include [[Agnes Denes]]’ ''Wheatfields for Manhattan'' (1982), [[David Hammons]]’ ''Higher Goals'' (1986), and ''Messages to the Public'' (1982-1990), a series of projects created for [[Times Square]]’s Spectacolor board that featured work by over 70 artists including [[Jenny Holzer]], [[Keith Haring]], [[Barbara Kruger]], [[Vito Acconci]], [[Lynne Tillman]], [[Alfredo Jaar]], [[Richard Prince]], and the [[Guerrilla Girls|Guerilla Girls]].

In the late 1980s and into the 1990s, the organization commissioned socially conscious pieces such as [[Félix González-Torres|Felix Gonzalez-Torres]]’ ''“Untitled”'' billboard (1989), [[Gran Fury]]’s “Women don’t get AIDS…they just die from it” poster (1991), [[Guerrilla Girls|Guerilla Girls]]’ billboard project for Public Art Fund’s ''PSA: Public Service Art'' exhibition series (1991), and [[Barbara Kruger]]’s ''Bus'' (1997).

In 1997, Public Art Fund organized [[Ilya Kabakov]]'s ''Monument to the Lost Glove'', a giant glove made of red plastic resin, which was bolted to the traffic triangle where [[Fifth Avenue]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;and [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;cross at [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]], and worked with him again in 2000 with ''The Palace of Projects'', which was shown at the [[69th Regiment Armory|69&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;Regiment Armory]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/fales/paf/dscref24.html|title=Guide to the Public Art Fund Archive

A '''recording contract''' (commonly called a '''record contract''' or '''record deal''') is a legal agreement between a [[record label]] and a [[recording artist]] (or group), where the artist makes a record (or series of records) for the label to sell and promote. Artists under contract are normally only allowed to record for that label exclusively; guest appearances on other artists' records will carry a notice "By courtesy of (the name of the label)", and that label may receive a percentage of sales.

==Copyrights, payment and royalties==
Labels typically own the [[copyright]] in the records their artists make, and also the [[master recording|master copies]] of those records. An exception is when a label makes a [[distribution deal]] with an artist; in this case, the artist, their manager, or another party may own the copyright (and masters), while the record is [[license]]d exclusively to the label for a set period of time. [[Promotion (marketing)|Promotion]] is a key factor in the success of a record, and is largely the label's responsibility, as is proper [[distribution (business)|distribution]] of records.

While initial recording deals usually yield a smaller percentage of [[royalties]] to the artists, subsequent (or renegotiated) deals can result in much greater profit, or profit potential. A few acts, such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[R.E.M.]], [[U2]], and [[Janet Jackson]], among others, have signed multimillion-dollar deals. [[Whitney Houston]] signed a $100 million deal with [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] to deliver just six albums, the largest recording deal at the time. [[Robbie Williams]] signed an £80m (US$125m) contract with [[EMI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/oct/03/arts.artsnews | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Fiachra | last=Gibbons | title=Robbie Williams signs £80m deal | date=2002-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many other artists, though, for the millions to become [[tangible]], hit albums meeting or exceeding their previous sales figures must follow. Recording contracts may include opt-out clauses for the label in the event an act's popularity dips or the act releases non-hit albums under the deal. For instance, [[Mariah Carey]] was dropped by [[Virgin Records]] and her $80 million recording deal cancelled after her first album released by the label sold poorly.&lt;ref name="Mayer"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/carey.html|title=Carey On|work=''[[CBC.ca]]''|publisher=CBC|accessdate=2011-02-24|date=2005-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Record companies put forth huge sums of money to produce, release, and promote an album. Recording time, manufacturing, packaging, photos, distribution, marketing, and music videos are just some of the areas where the label must spend money on an act it has signed. The label usually absorbs these expenses, but in some artists contracts, some of this money may be due back to the label, unless otherwise worded. Advances (upfront money that is paid directly to a recording artist) are normally always owed back to the label. Once (and if) the advance has been paid back from record sales, the artist then begins to see royalty payments for additional sales. Advancing an act money is a risk the label endures as it does not know how well the act's album will sell. [[Capitol Records]] suspended [[Linda Ronstadt]]'s contract in the early 1970s, as Capitol had spent more money on Ronstadt then it had yielded. She continued to tour partly to pay Capitol back for her 1960s deal, and a string of hits in the mid-1970s allowed her to finally clear the debt. Record companies expect to make a profit, and little concern themselves with a given performer's lack of business or financial savvy, as artists such as [[George Michael]] have discovered. "Walking out" on a deal is very difficult or nearly impossible, as is attempting to strike a new deal without completing an old one. [[Donna Summer]] signed a new deal with [[Geffen Records]] in 1980, and released an album on Geffen. She was then told by her previous label, [[Polygram Records]], that she owed them another album, per her agreement. She recorded and delivered [[She Works Hard for the Money (album)|an album]] to Polygram that the label released, and it became a hit. Summer then went back to recording for Geffen Records for [[Cats Without Claws|her next project]]. [[The Mamas &amp; the Papas]] were forced into a reunion, years after their 1968 breakup, by the letter of their [[Dunhill Records]] contract, which required one more album to be completed -which became 1971's ''[[People Like Us (The Mamas and the Papas album)|People Like Us]]''.

Record companies will generally increase royalty rates or give artistic freedom to get acts to re-sign contracts with them once the original deal has been fulfilled. Established acts may otherwise go where they see better opportunity. During 1980, [[Diana Ross]] released her album ''[[Diana (album)|diana]]'', which fulfilled her contract with [[Motown Records]]. The album spawned three US hits (a #1 and two top tens) and sold 10 million copies worldwide. Ross, however, felt she was never fairly compensated by Motown for her work with [[The Supremes]] or her solo releases. When [[RCA Records]] offered her $20 million to sign with them, Ross gave Motown the chance to match the deal, or at least offer something almost comparable. Motown, believing Ross's solo career was too up-and-down, and not seeing any reason to now compensate her for her earlier Supremes work, offered $3 million. Split with the decision to remain with the label that made her famous, or sign a deal with a company that was willing to pay her what she felt she was worth, she ultimately signed with RCA. That $20 million deal was the biggest recording contract at the time. She had signed with RCA for North America only, she signed a separate longterm contract with Capitol/EMI for international territories. That contractual amount was never officially released. However, it is believed to be as much as $20 more million and she has remained currently signed with them for over 30 years and has produced many more successful recordings internationally including her multi-platinum 1991 release, ''[[The Force Behind the Power]]'' and an even greater success with a greatest hits compilation, ''[[One Woman: The Ultimate Collection]]'' that sold over 1.5 million in the United Kingdom alone, spending several weeks at #1.

There are plenty examples of recording contracts available in music business guides, legal texts and also online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musiclawcontracts.com/recording-contract/ |title=Exclusive Recording Contract Template |website=Musiclawcontracts.com |date=2016-03-05 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Termination==
When recordings go out of print, this typically happens because either the label has decided that continuing to sell (or distribute) the record will not be profitable, or the licensing agreement with the artist has expired. (Labels may also stop distribution as a punitive measure, if an artist fails to comply with their contract, or as a strategic measure if negotiations for a new one prove difficult.) Record labels can also become [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]] like any business, and their masters and copyrights sold or traded as part of their assets. (Occasionally these are purchased by the artists themselves.)

Recording artists signed to a failed label can find themselves in limbo, unable to record for anyone but a company that is out of business (and thus cannot sell or distribute their records), and with their existing works unavailable for sale. When one label "buys out" another (or a label is purchased by an outside party), any existing copyrights and contracts held (and masters, if owned by the label) normally go with the sale. This often benefits recording artists, but not always.

Distribution deals are often renewed, but occasionally the label and the copyright owner cannot come to terms for a renewal. The reason is usually that one party expects too much money, or too large a percentage of profits, to suit the other.

'''Systems-oriented design''' ('''S.O.D.''') uses [[system thinking]] in order to capture the [[complexity]] of [[system]]s addressed in [[Design|design practice]]. The main mission of S.O.D. is to build the [[designer]]s' own interpretation and implementation of systems thinking. S.O.D. aims at enabling systems thinking to fully benefit from [[design thinking]] and practice, and design thinking and practice to fully benefit from systems thinking. S.O.D. addresses design for human activity systems, and can be applied to any kind of design problem ranging from [[product design]] and [[interaction design]], through [[architecture]] to [[Decision making|decision making processes]] and policy design.

== Background ==
Design is getting more and more complex for a number of reasons, for example due to [[globalization]], need for [[sustainability]], and the introduction of new [[technology]] and increased use of [[automation]]. Many of the challenges designers meet today can be considered [[wicked problems]].&lt;ref name="Rittel"&gt;Rittel, Horst, and Melvin Webber, 1973. "Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning."
Policy Sciences 4: 155-169. {{cite web |url=http://www.metu.edu.tr/~baykan/arch467/Rittel%2BWebber%2BDilemmas.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721100404/http://www.metu.edu.tr/~baykan/arch467/Rittel%2BWebber%2BDilemmas.pdf |archivedate=21 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The characteristics of a wicked problem include among others that there are no definitive formulation of the problem and that the solutions are never true-or-false, but rather better or worse.&lt;ref name="Rittel" /&gt; A traditional problem solving approach is not sufficient in addressing for such design problems. S.O.D. is an approach that addresses the challenges the designer faces when working with [[complex system]]s and wicked problems, providing tools and techniques which makes it easier for the designer to grasp the complexity of the problem at hand. With a systems-oriented approach towards design, the designer acknowledges that the starting point for the design process is constantly moving, and that "every implemented solution is consequential. It leaves "traces" that cannot be undone." (see Rittel and Webber's 5th property of wicked problems&lt;ref name="Rittel" /&gt;).

Designers are well suited to work with complexity and wicked problems for a number of reasons:
* They are trained and experienced in creative thinking and idea generation;
* They know how to synthesize solutions from complex and fuzzy material;
* Designers have an ability to visualize, which is an enormous advantage for understanding and communicating complexity.

S.O.D. emphasizes these abilities as central and seeks to further train the designer in systems thinking and systems practice as a skill and an art.

== Origins ==
Systems-oriented design builds on systems theory and systems thinking in order to develop practices for addressing complexity in design. Particularly influential is soft systems methodology (SSM), acknowledging conflicting worldviews and people's purposeful actions,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Checkland and John Polter, 2006. ''Learning For Action: A Short Definitive Account of Soft Systems Methodology, and its use Practitioners, Teachers and Students.'' Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; and a systems view on creativity. However, S.O.D. is inspired by critical systems thinking and approaches systems theories in an eclectic way transforming the thoughts of the different theories to fit the design process. The design disciplines build on their own traditions and have a certain way of working with problems, often referred to as ''[[design thinking]]''&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The definition of design thinking is not completely agreed upon and the term is used somewhat differently by different people. There is currently considerable academic and business interest in developing further understanding of what design thinking is.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, G. Peter (1987). Design Thinking. Cambridge: The MIT Press. {{ISBN|978-0-262-68067-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tim Brown, 2009. ''Change by Design: How Design Thinking Transforms Organizations and Inspires Innovation''. HarperBusiness. {{ISBN|0-06-176608-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Cross, 2011. Design Thinking: Understanding How Designers Think and Work. Berg Publishers {{ISBN|1-84788-636-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''the design way''.&lt;ref&gt;Harold G. Nelson and Erik Stolterman, 2002. ''The Design Way: Intentional Change in an Unpredictable World : Foundations and Fundamentals of Design Competence''. Educational Technology Pubns {{ISBN|0-87778-305-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Design thinking is a creative process based around the "building up" of ideas. This style of thinking is one of the advantages of the designer and is the reason why simply employing one of the existing systems approach into design, like for example [[systems engineering]], is not found sufficient by the advocates of S.O.D.

Compared with other systems approaches, S.O.D. is less concerned with hierarchies and borders of systems, [[Scientific modelling|modelling]] and [[feedback loops]], and more focused on the whole fields of relations and patterns of interactions. S.O.D. seeks richness rather than simplification of the complex systems.

== Systems thinking in the design process ==
Important in the systems-oriented [[design process]] is to carry out activities in order to grasp the [[complexity]] of the [[system]] designed for, and to accommodate for a [[Creativity|creative process]] taking place. In order to gain the necessary understanding of the complex system, a comprehensive data capture and analysis phase is needed. [[Visualization (computer graphics)|Visualization]]s play a vital role in the design process, both as a means to analyze and understand the information gathered, and in order to communicate. The obtained insight into the complex system is used to come up with solutions for the design problem.

Methods and techniques from other [[academic discipline|disciplines]] are used in order to understand the complexity of the system, including for example [[Ethnography|ethnographic studies]], [[risk analysis]], and [[Scenario|scenario thinking]]. Methods and concepts unique to S.O.D. include for example the Rich Design Space,&lt;ref&gt;Birger Sevaldson, 2008. ''Rich Design Research Space''. Form Akademisk. http://www.formakademisk.org/index.php/formakademisk/article/view/17&lt;/ref&gt; GIGA-mapping,&lt;ref&gt;Birger Sevaldson, 2011. ''GIGA-Mapping: Visualisation for complexity and systems thinking in design''. Paper presented at NORDES 2011, 30 May 2011. http://ocs.sfu.ca/nordes/index.php/nordes/2011/paper/view/409&lt;/ref&gt; and Incubation Techniques.

The Rich Design Space includes the physical space of the design studio with sketches, ideas, mood boards, plans etc. and the virtual digital design space of the design software, media like video and sound recording, traditional design techniques and even the social space created in the project. By paying attention to the richness of the design space, the design space can become a very efficient tool to maintain an overview of the complexity of the project all the way.

GIGA-mapping is the central tool for registering, analyzing and managing complexity in S.O.D.. It is used for systematizing and interrelating the information and knowledge obtained.

[[Incubation (psychology)|Incubation]] is one of the 4 proposed stages of [[creativity]]: preparation, incubation, illumination, and verification.&lt;ref&gt;Hadamard, J. (1945). ''The Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field''. Princeton
University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Incubation Techniques are techniques used by the designer in order to acquire the background knowledge needed for an incubation process to take place.

S.O.D. has proved valuable for designers to quickly acquire knowledge of a new domains, and to reveal unexpected parts of a system where a new design can be beneficial.

== Further development and applications ==
The concept of systems-oriented design was initially proposed by professor [[Birger Ragnvald Sevaldson|Birger Sevaldson]] at [[Oslo School of Architecture and Design|the Oslo School of Architecture and Design (AHO)]] in the context of the [[OCEAN Design Research Association|OCEAN design research network]]. The S.O.D. approach is currently under development through teaching and research projects, as well as through the work of design practitioners. AHO provides Master courses in Systems Oriented Design each term as part of their [[Industrial Design]] program. In these courses, design students are trained in using the tools and techniques of S.O.D. in projects with outside partners. Research projects in systems-oriented design are carried out at the Centre for Design Research&lt;ref&gt;Research related to the topic ''Systems'' carried out at AHO Centre for Design Research: http://www.designresearch.no/themes/systems&lt;/ref&gt; at AHO in order to develop the concept, methods and tools further. In 2016 the project Systemic Approach to Architectural Performance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://systemicapproachtoarchitecturalperformance.wordpress.com|title=Systemic Approach to Architectural Performance|author=|date=|website=Systemic Approach to Architectural Performance|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was announced as an institutional cooperation between the Faculty of Art and Architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fua.tul.cz/en/|title=FUA - FAKULTA UMĚNÍ A ARCHITEKTURY|author=|date=|website=www.fua.tul.cz|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Technical University of Liberec]] and the Oslo School of Architecture and Design. Its mission is to link the methodology of systems-oriented design with performance-oriented architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.performanceorienteddesign.net|title=Welcome to the Frontpage|author=|date=|website=www.performanceorienteddesign.net|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the case study Marie Davidova's project Wood as a Primary Medium to Architectural Performance.
The Oslo-based design consultancy Halogen (www.halogen.no) has used SOD extensively with a varied range of customers. They have suggested a typology of Gigamaps and contributed with other methodological developments.
Gigamapping and other SOD methods are used by a growing range of businesses and educational institutions.

'''''Time Bites: Views and Reviews''''' is a 2004 collection of [[essays]] by [[Doris Lessing]]. It contains book reviews, literary criticism and commentaries that have appeared in various works since the 1970s. 

==Reception==
[[BookList]] wrote "Most of her conversational, fast-moving, often wry inquiries into literature, politics, and ethics were originally published in England, hence little known in America, a lack redressed in this generous and pleasurable collection. Knowing books as intimately as she does, and caring deeply about reading and writing, Lessing pens critical essays that are vibrant and illuminating, with quotable lines on every page."&lt;ref name=buffalo/&gt; and the [[Library Journal]] stated "Lessing comments cleverly on the classic novelists (e.g., Leo Tolstoy), but some of the most interesting pieces are centered on less well known or virtually forgotten writers. There are quite a few essays on the Sufi author Idries Shah (1924-96); other topics Lessing covers range from politics to cats."&lt;ref name=buffalo&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.buffalolib.org/vufind/Record/1640988/Reviews |title=Time bites : views and reviews |website=www.buffalolib.org |publisher=Buffalo and Erie County Public Library |accessdate=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Kirkus Reviews]] wrote "While this collection of random journalism—some dating back to 1974, but most from the past decade—has the inevitable repetitions and a rather scattershot feel, it still gives a nice sense of Lessing’s character and commitments in vigorous old age."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/doris-lessing/time-bites/ |title=TIME BITES Views and Reviews  |date=15 September 2005 |website=www.kirkusreviews.com |publisher=Kirkus Media LLC |accessdate=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Publishers Weekly]] wrote "The main theme, whether addressed overtly or underlying her literary criticism, is the indispensable place of books in the life of an educated person and an enlightened culture. Hers is a clarion call."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-06-083140-0 |title=Time Bites: Views and Reviews |date=10 October 2005|website=www.publishersweekly.com |publisher=PWxyz LLC|accessdate=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''ToryBoy The Movie''''' is a 2011 [[Gonzo journalism|gonzo]]-style British documentary feature film directed by and starring [[John Walsh (filmmaker)|John Walsh]]. It follows Walsh as he becomes a political candidate for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the north east England constituency of [[Middlesbrough]]. 

==Background==
A staunch [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] supporter all his life, Walsh had become disillusioned with the party. When [[David Cameron]] opened the door to allow non party members to run for the Conservative candidacy ahead of the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 General Election]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/5377839/David-Cameron-to-open-up-candidate-list-to-everyone.html|title=David Cameron to 'open up candidate list to everyone'|author=Chris Irvine|date=24 May 2009|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Walsh decided to do just that and document his experiences on camera.&lt;ref name="Young People"&gt;[https://youngpeopleinpolitics.org.uk/inspiration/interviews/ John Walsh interview, Young People In Politics, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; He came third in the election; Stuart Bell remained the MP of Middlesbrough,&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-13960870|title=Tory Boy takes on Sir Stuart Bell in documentary film|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; but increased the Conservative vote to its highest in thirty years with an 18.8% share of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/constituency/c92.stm|title=BBC News - Election 2010 - Constituency - Middlesbrough|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The film==
The film was based on the 72 hours of footage made by Walsh on the campaign trail.&lt;ref name="Young People"/&gt; It made the case that [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]'s [[Stuart Bell]] should not be the [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) of [[Middlesbrough]], as Bell was absent so often from Middlesbrough that he is an unsuitable candidate. Walsh showed the finished film in a free showing a year after the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/toryboy-movie-documentary-up-award-3691723|title=Toryboy The Movie documentary up for award|author=gazettelive Administrator|date=5 August 2011|work=gazettelive}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the ''Who Can I vote For?'' website a humorous warning is given, "this film contains strong language throughout and scenes of politicians that some viewers may find offensive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://whocanivotefor.co.uk/person/493/john-walsh|title=John Walsh for Member of Parliament for Middlesbrough in the 2010 General Election|website=Who Can I Vote For? by Democracy Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mike Amesbury]] appeared in the documentary protesting outside the Conservative conference in Manchester.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

Walsh paid homage to the great title designer [[Saul Bass]] and recreated his angular animations to create a fresh approach to telling this story. “This map cap comedy best captured the visual style and the transition of the film was making from a serious expose of the political shenanigans in the North East, to a political satire.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thewhitebalance.com/work/toryboy-the-movie.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Walsh said that he took a risk making this film in an article with Digital Journal "For something like this, an investigative film, there will be some who think that I have exceeded my brief as a candidate. I would say that it is right to look at injustice and in this country people have died so that we may all have the right to question those in authority and those in public office."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitaljournal.com/blog/11509&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Northern Echo]]'' discussed the possible of the film forcing a new by election as a result of its findings. Walsh said he had been serious about becoming an MP and had self-funded his £15,000 election campaign. "When I got to Middlesbrough I found a town that politics had forgotten and a MP who was there in name only, a truly depressingly affair.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/9028657.Documentary__could_force_by_election_/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
The film received positive reviews, with a high score of 8.8 on [[IMDb]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1740117/&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2011 the film was nominated for the [[Grierson Awards]] for "Best Documentary on a Contemporary Theme".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.griersontrust.org/grierson-awards/past-awards/2011/the-grierson-awards-2011-shortlist/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://lfs.org.uk/content/john-walshs-tory-boy-movie-shortlisted-grierson-awards&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''[[Radio Times]]'' film review by Jeremy Aspinall on the film's re-release gave it four stars, and called it "A revealing and droll fly-on-the-wall documentary. It's a fascinating odyssey illuminated by pithily informative animations. Who would have thought politics could be so entertaining?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/film/c5xq27/toryboy-the-movie|title=Toryboy the Movie|author=Jeremy Aspinall|work=RadioTimes}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Details of the film's award nomination was covered by the Middlesbrough ''[[Teesside Gazette]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/toryboy-movie-documentary-up-award-3691723&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Irish Post]]'' Walsh’s “documentary about a rookie Conservative candidate aimed to provide an insight into British political culture, and in doing so uncovered the next big political scandal.” &lt;ref&gt;http://irishpost.co.uk/documentary-that-exposed-labour-scandal-back-in-theatres-ahead-of-election/&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Richard Moss]], the [[BBC]]'s North East &amp; Cumbria Political editor, "some silliness aside, it is a thought-provoking insight into the way our political system works or doesn't work on the ground... But I'm not sure he quite nails down a case against Stuart Bell.. And John Walsh doesn't help his case with some of the content in the film."&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt; [[Liberal Democratic Party|Liberal Democrat]] commentator Mark Pack wrote on his blog that "John Walsh portrays life on the campaign trail as it really is. It is a hugely enjoyable documentary, which mixes humour, drama and education".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.markpack.org.uk/29694/toryboy-john-walsh-portrays-life-on-the-campaign-trail-as-it-really-is/|title=ToryBoy: John Walsh portrays life on the campaign trail as it really is|date=1 March 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A screening at the [[Frontline Club]] took place on 22 November 2011 followed by a Q&amp;A with John Walsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontlineclub.com/toryboy_visits_the_frontline_club/|title=ToryBoy visits the Frontline Club|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire Magazine]]'' gave it three stars and called it a "shit stirring exposé of local politics that will make you cross".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=510147455692929&amp;set=pb.191458757561802.-2207520000.1384175778.&amp;type=3&amp;theater screenshot at Facebook] 20 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=November 2017}} Samuel Scott from review site DVD Compare gave it a B- and wrote "I found this documentary very intriguing and very honest. John is a very likable character, and I wouldn't hesitate in voting for someone with so much passion for a second."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dvdcompare.net/review.php?rid=3637 DVD Compare] 14 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Doc Geeks commented that the film was "a blunt exposé combined with a tinge of lightheartedness. Satirical animation cleverly frames Britain in its political context".&lt;ref&gt;[http://docgeeks.com/2011/11/14/review-toryboy-the-movie/ Doc Geeks] November 14th, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On his blog, novelist [[Christopher Fowler]] wrote that ''ToryBoy The Movie'' was "a snapshot of our country’s political apathy in microcosm. It’s heartbreaking to see people blindly supporting their own demise as if they’re playing some kind of long game they’ll probably never live to see the outcome of. Oh, and it’s also very funny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christopherfowler.co.uk/blog/2011/12/02/review-toryboy/|title=Re:View – ‘Toryboy’ - Christopher Fowler|website=www.christopherfowler.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the DVD was released Ben Kamal interviewed Walsh for the Aberdeen student newspaper ''[[Gaudie]]'', and wrote "I was prepared for some careful sneering in the interview and subsequent write-up. This did not (and could not) transpire: firstly because of the film, which comes across as [[Frank Capra]] scripted by [[Evelyn Waugh]]; secondly because of Walsh himself. He is warm, patient and generous, to my own shock I liked him and if you watch the film you'll like him too."&lt;ref&gt;[https://issuu.com/gaudie/docs/feb_25] 25 February 2014, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; "Dave", a reviewer at the website 60 Minutes With, wrote "''ToryBoy the Movie'' is a fantastic documentary and one in which you will be cheering for John despite what political party you follow. His journey from his Labour roots through to a Tory campaign is superbly documented and will have you both laughing and feeling his frustration in equal measure."&lt;ref&gt;[http://60minuteswith.co.uk/reviews/review-toryboy-movie/ 60 Minutes With], 15 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Northern Echo]]'' article by Lucy Richardson she reveals that “at the pre-election hustings, where Sir Stuart does not make an appearance, he tells voters that he will have Sir Stuart jailed before Christmas if elected.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/features/9120025.Jolt_from_the_blue/&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years after the film release, Lord [[Michael Ashcroft]] wrote on his blog: "I’d defy anyone with an interest in politics not to enjoy this film".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2012/05/lord-ashcroft-two-years-on-a-controversial-film-gives-a-witty-thought-provoking-snapshot-into-the-ge.html|title=Lord Ashcroft: Two years on, a controversial film gives a witty, thought-provoking snapshot into the general election|work=Conservative Home}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to say that "despite the zany tone of the film, it also has a hard-hitting message which questions whether one MP in his safe seat, and perhaps other MPs in similar situations, do enough to justify their salary and expenses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lordashcroft.com/2012/05/two-years-on-a-controversial-film-gives-a-witty-thought-provoking-snapshot-into-the-general-election/|title=Two years on, a controversial film gives a witty, thought-provoking snapshot into the general election - Lord Ashcroft|date=6 May 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017 the political Guido Fawkes website also known as Order Order, ran an article entitled “Inside The Greatest Election Scandal of All Time” says that Walsh “lifted the lid on the real-life world of political campaigning.”&lt;ref&gt;https://order-order.com/2017/04/28/inside-greatest-election-scandal-time/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vice (magazine)|Vice Mangazine]]’s Joe Zadeh’s article suggests a link between how Labour in Middlesbrough lost the votes of blue collar people and its shift to the right. He cited ToryBoy The Movie as an example of this shift.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/ev445j/how-labour-lost-the-working-class&lt;/ref&gt;

In a podcast interview with BritFlicks Walsh talks about ToryBoy and the difficulties in making the film and also his plans to develop lost [[Ray Harryhausen]] film projects.&lt;ref&gt;http://britflicks.com/blog.aspx?blogid=24084&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nerdly.co.uk/2018/01/01/interview-john-walsh-tory-boy-the-movie-ray-harryhausen-podcast/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Although not explicitly inspired by the film, Neil Macfarlane, in a report for local newspaper''[[Teesside Gazette]]'', asked "Are Teessiders getting enough from Sir Stuart Bell?" when he failed to answer over 100 telephone calls made to his constituency office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/teessiders-getting-enough-sir-stuart-3693031|title=Are Teessiders getting enough from Sir Stuart Bell?|author=gazettelive Administrator|date=6 September 2011|work=gazettelive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Gazette'' story was picked up by national newspapers. ''[[The Independent]]'' asked "is Sir Stuart Bell Britain's laziest MP?"&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Brown [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/no-surgeries-for-14-years--is-sir-stuart-bell-britains-laziest-mp-2350953.html No surgeries for 14 years - is Sir Stuart Bell Britain's laziest MP?], ''Independent'', 7 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;Richard Moss [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-14847291 Middlesbrough MP Sir Stuart Bell fights laziest MP tag], BBC, 9 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Guardian'' fact-checked the "laziest MP" claim and found that the laziest MP was [[Roger Godsiff]] but the report did confirm that Sir Stuart Bell did not maintain the pivotal role for a MP, an office in their constituency. &lt;ref name="reality check"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2011/sep/08/reality-check-britain-s-laziest-mp|title=Reality check: Who are Britain's laziest parliamentarians?|author=Polly Curtis|work=the Guardian|date=8 September 2011}}: "Bell has been an MP for nearly 30 years and has had a distinguished career in parliament as a frontbench spokesman on trade and industry in opposition and the spokesman for the Church of England in the House of Commons and member of the House of Commons commission until last year. He's part of a breed of politicians – also including the Tory [[Edward Leigh]] and Labour's [[Gerald Kaufman]] – who have been extremely active parliamentarians but not always maintained an office in their constituency. One measure of their parliamentary work is the proportion of votes they turn up to."&lt;/ref&gt; The Labour Party said it would be totally unacceptable if constituents had been unable to contact their MP. [[Ed Miliband]] and the Labour Party expect the highest standards from Labour representatives. It is totally unacceptable if the public cannot reach their MP.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/labour-launches-probe-middlesbrough-mp-3693109|title=Labour launches probe into Middlesbrough MP|author=gazettelive Administrator|date=8 September 2011|work=gazettelive}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sir Stuart Bell did have a right of reply, which appeared in the short film ''ToryBoy The AfterMath''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2014/05/john-walsh-toryboy-the-aftermath-or-the-town-that-politics-forgot.html|title=John Walsh: ToryBoy – the aftermath (or: the Town That Politics Forgot…)|work=Conservative Home}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's expose nearly forced a By Election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/9028657.Documentary__could_force_by_election_/|title=Documentary 'could force by-election'|work=The Northern Echo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's re-release in 2015 caused more controversy after a showing in Middlesbrough by [[Teesside University]] was cancelled to avoid breaching union rules on political neutrality in the run up to the general election. According to Walsh's interview with ''[[Teesside Gazette]]''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.questia.com/newspaper/1G1-408518499/director-upset-as-toryboy-film-screening-cancelled&lt;/ref&gt; the film was booked in by the Student Union, but at the last minute the screening was halted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2015/04/john-walsh-toryboy-the-move-banned-in-middlesbrough.html|title=ToryBoy The Movie – banned in Middlesbrough|author=John Walsh|work=Conservative Home|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Brown [http://mmj.tees.ac.uk/~project22/index5d95.html?p=863 Student Union involved in row over planned screening of controversial Toryboy the Movie], ''[[The North Crowd]]'' 27 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; "I think it's a shame really," said Walsh. "It's a unique opportunity for students to hold me to account."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.questia.com/newspaper/1G1-408518499/director-upset-as-toryboy-film-screening-cancelled&lt;/ref&gt; Teesside Free Education Campaign activists, writing on the website of the [[National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts]], mentioned the union cancelling the film: "A few weeks after the student elections, a planned screening of the film Tory Boy, made by the 2010 Tory candidate for Middlesbrough about his experience standing in the area was cancelled, despite having been screened at schools and colleges up and down the country without controversy." &lt;ref&gt;Teesside Free Education activists [http://anticuts.com/2015/09/21/our-year-with-the-worst-union-in-the-country/ Our year with the ‘worst union in the country’] ''Anticuts.com'' September 21, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The [[North Crowd]] featured an interview with John Walsh website where they showed the actual print work that was created by the Student Union.&lt;ref&gt;https://mmj.tees.ac.uk//~project22/index5d95.html?p=863&lt;/ref&gt;

==Re-releases==
The film received a re-release in cinemas in 2015 in the lead up to the [[2015 UK General Election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishpost.co.uk/entertainment/documentary-that-exposed-labour-scandal-back-in-theatres-ahead-of-election|title=Satirical film ToryBoy The Movie returns to big screen|work=The Irish Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/11807584.BAFTA_nominated_Greenwich_filmmaker_s_controversial_ToryBoy_returns_to_cinemas_before_election/|title=BAFTA-nominated Greenwich filmmaker's controversial ToryBoy returns to cinemas before election|work=News Shopper}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Community cinema screenings were given and included a Q&amp;A from Walsh. &lt;ref&gt;http://hithergreencinema.com/2014/05/a-little-bit-of-politics-tory-boy-the-movie-plus-director-john-walsh-and-qa-with-your-local-candidates/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Soundtrack ==
The film used older film ques from films across the last six decades to create a unique soundscape. ''[[Radio Times]]'' described it as "a fascinating odyssey illuminated by pithily informative animations and music from films like ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' and ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/film/c5xq27/toryboy-the-movie/|title=Toryboy the Movie – review - cast and crew, movie star rating and where to watch film on TV and online|website=Radio Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''''Treatise on Law''''' is [[St. Thomas Aquinas]]' major work of [[philosophy of law|legal philosophy]]. It forms questions 90–108 of the ''Prima Secundæ'' ("First [Part] of the Second [Part]") of the [[Summa Theologica|''Summa Theologiæ'']],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utm.edu/staff/jfieser/vita/research/aqu.htm THE LOGIC OF NATURAL LAW IN AQUINAS'S "TREATISE ON LAW"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016223414/http://www.utm.edu/staff/jfieser/vita/research/aqu.htm |date=2013-10-16 }}&lt;br&gt;James Fieser&lt;br&gt;Journal of Philosophical Research, 1992, Vol. 17, pp. 147–164.&lt;br&gt;accessed Dec-17-2013&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas' masterwork of [[scholasticism|Scholastic]] [[philosophical theology]]. Along with [[Aristotle|Aristotelianism]], it forms the basis for the legal theory of [[canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic canon law]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Dr. Edward N. Peters]], [http://canonlaw.info/ CanonLaw.info] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928005444/http://www.canonlaw.info/ |date=2011-09-28 }}, accessed Dec-17-2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aquinas' notion of law==
Aquinas defines a law as "an ordinance of reason for the common good, made by him who has care of the community, and promulgated."&lt;ref&gt;Gateway Edition, pg. ix&lt;/ref&gt;

Law is an ordinance of reason because it must be reasonable&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Law of Christ I, pg. 236&lt;/ref&gt; or based in reason and not merely in the will of the legislator.&lt;ref&gt;J. Budziszewski, [http://www.undergroundthomist.org/sites/default/files/related-documents/1-2Q90Art1.pdf ''Commentary on Treatise on Law''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219121116/http://www.undergroundthomist.org/sites/default/files/related-documents/1-2Q90Art1.pdf |date=2013-12-19 }}, accessed Dec-19-2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gateway Edition, pg. 2 (''Summa,'' Ia–IIæ, Q.90, A.1, Obj.3)&lt;/ref&gt; It is for the common good because the end or ''[[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]'' of law is the good of the community it binds, and not merely the good of the lawmaker or a special interest group.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; It is made by the proper authority who has "care of the community", and not arbitrarily imposed by outsiders. It is promulgated so that the law can be known.

He says: {{quote|Thus from the four preceding articles [of Question 90], the definition of law may be gathered; and it is nothing else than an ordinance of reason for the common good, made by him who has care of the community, and promulgated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Treatise_on_Law |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219002500/https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Treatise_on_Law |archivedate=2013-12-19 |df= }}, accessed Dec-19-2013&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Strictly speaking, this is a definition of human law.&lt;ref&gt;Gateway Edition, pg. viii&lt;/ref&gt; The term "law" as used by Aquinas is [[Equivocal predication|equivocal]], meaning that the primary meaning of law is "human law", but other, analogous concepts are expressed with the same term.&lt;ref&gt;Gateway Edition, pg. x&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kinds of law==

===Natural law===
[[Natural law]] or the law of nature refers to normative properties that are inherent by virtue of human nature and universally cognizable through human reason. Historically, natural law refers to the use of reason to analyze both social and personal human nature to deduce binding rules of moral behavior. The law of nature, being determined by nature, is universal.

	In the Treatise on Law, deals with Aquinas view’s on the objective ethical aspect of human decision-making. Aquinas presents a question and then puts each question into article raising specific questions he has. The first three questions are broken down in four topics what is the essence of law, the effects of law, and the eternal law.
	 The first question Ninety of Aquinas Treatise on Law is what is the essence of law? In the first question he breakdowns the question into four articles. The first article is Does Law Belong to Reason? Aquinas believes that reason is the first thing human acts upon. “And the source in any kind of thing is the measure and rule of that kind of thing…and so we conclude that law belongs to reason.” (90.1) The second is Law Always Ordained for the Common Good? We cannot find common good without reason; it guides us to common happiness through law. Happiness for the whole community. The third article is Any Person’s Reason Competent to Make Law? And the last article is Promulgation an Essential Component of Law? Promulgation is important so that the law can achieve force. By the end of the fourth article Aquinas comes up with his definition on Law, “Law is an ordination of reason for the common good by one who has care for the community, and promulgated.”(90.4) 
	Next we Next is question is Ninety-One on what are the different kinds of law? Aquinas establishes four types of laws eternal law, natural law, human law, and divine law. Eternal law “Gods providence rules the world…his reason evidently governs the entire community in the universe.” (91.1) Aquinas believes that eternal law is all gods doing. Natural law is the participation in the eternal law by rational creators. Natural law allows us to decide between good and evil. Next we have Human Law; particular applications of law resulting by reason. “Human law originally sprang from nature.” (91.3) The last law is Divine this law is important because “it belongs to any law to be directed to the common good at its end.” (91.4) Theses laws all go together and the relationship must be presented to comprehend them individually.
	Question 92 is the Effects on Laws. The first article is the Effect of Law to Make Human Beings Good? Aquinas feels in order for law to make people good that law needs to guide people to their right virtue. “Therefore, since virtue makes those possessing it good, the proper effect of law is consequently to make its subject good, either absolutely or in some respect.” (92.1) The second article of 92 is Do we Suitably Designate Legal Acts? This article focuses on what “designate legal acts consist of “commanding, forbidding, permitting, and punishing.” (92.2) Aquinas believes that some human acts are good and some are evil. 
	Question 93 focuses on the Eternal as a whole. Aquinas is asking is the eternal law the supreme plan in god? Aquinas argues whether or not if the eternal law is a plan of god. He says “God made each thing with its own nature. Therefore, the eternal law is not the same as divine plan.” (93.1) Augustine contradicts this idea by stating “the eternal law is the supreme plan that we should always obey.” (93.1) Aquinas believes that the eternal law “is simply the plan of divine wisdom that directs all the actions and movements of created things.” (93.1) He saying that god is above all else. That he creates everything in the universe. Human beings participate in eternal law in two ways by action and cognition. “The virtuous are completely subjects to the eternal law, as they always act in accord with.” (93.6) Aquinas believes people who are truthful act according to the eternal law.

===Human law===
{{see also|Determinatio}}
For Aquinas, human law is only valid if it conforms to natural law. If a law is unjust, then it is not actually a law, but a "perversion of law".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2095.htm Summa I–II, q95, a2, 'dicendum quod''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109214550/http://newadvent.org/summa/2095.htm |date=2011-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://www.iep.utm.edu/natlaw/#H1 "Natural Law"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316052718/http://www.iep.utm.edu/natlaw/ |date=2017-03-16 }}, accessed Dec-20-2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Treatise on Law'' (as part of the Summa Theologica) is divided into Articles (or broad topics) and Questions (or specific topics). The Questions each argue for a single thesis and defend it against objections. The division is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Treatise_on_Law |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219002500/https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Treatise_on_Law |archivedate=2013-12-19 |df= }}, accessed Dec-17-2013&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2615">In [[literature]], the '''tritagonist''' or '''tertiary main character''' (from {{lang-grc|τριταγωνιστής}}, ''tritagōnistḗs'', third actor) is the third most important [[Character (arts)|character]] of a narrative, after the [[protagonist]] and [[deuteragonist]]. In [[ancient Greek drama]], the tritagonist was the third member of the acting troupe.

As a character, a tritagonist may act as the instigator or cause of the sufferings of the protagonist.  Despite being the least sympathetic character of the drama, he or she occasions the situations by which pity and sympathy for the protagonist are excited.&lt;ref name="muller"&gt;[[Karl Otfried Müller|Müller, Karl Otfried]], and [[John William Donaldson]]. ''[https://archive.org/details/historyofliterat01mluoft A History of the Literature of Ancient Greece]'', 1858&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|451}}

==History==
The part of the tritagonist emerged from earlier forms of two-actor drama.  Where two actors only allowed for a principal character and their adversary, moving the part of adversary to a third actor (the tritagonist) allowed for the second actor (the deuteragonist) to play roles as a confidant or aide to the principal character, and thereby elicit greater character depth from the principal character by having the protagonist explain their feelings and motivations to an on-stage listener.&lt;ref name="muller" /&gt;{{rp|451}}  As Ancient Greek theater recitations were partly melodic, the role of the tritagonist would typically go to a performer with a voice in the [[bass (voice type)|bass]] range (as compared to the protagonist as tenor and the deuteragonist as baritone).&lt;ref name="mantzius"&gt;''A History of Theatrical Art'', Mantzius (1903).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|172}} [[Cicero]], in his ''[[Divinatio in Caecilium]]'', reported that the tritagonist (being a role of lesser importance than the protagonist) would often have to subdue his voice if he was naturally stronger than the protagonist.&lt;ref&gt;''Divinatio in Caecilium'', [[Cicero]], s. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable Ancient Greek actors who worked in this role include the orator [[Aeschines]], who was held by [[Demosthenes]] to have been untalented as a tritagonist,&lt;ref name="mantzius" /&gt;{{rp|175}} and Myniscus, who was tritagonist under the playwright [[Aeschylus]].&lt;ref name="mantzius" /&gt;{{rp|195}}

In some forms of Greek theater, it was traditional for the tritagonist to enter the stage from the left.&lt;ref name="muller" /&gt;{{rp|404}}

[[File:Blake Job Evil Dreams Detail bb421 1 13-12 ps 300.jpg|thumb|300px|Plate 11 of the engravings, detail of centre image.]]
'''[[William Blake]]'s ''Illustrations of the Book of Job''''' primarily refers to a series of twenty-two [[engraving|engraved]] prints (published 1826) by Blake illustrating the biblical [[Book of Job]]. It also refers to two earlier sets of watercolours by Blake on the same subject (1806 and 1821). The engraved ''Illustrations'' are considered to be Blake's greatest masterpieces in the medium of engraving,&lt;ref&gt;Schoenherr 1997, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Essick 1980, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; and were also a rare commercial and critical success for Blake.

==Development and printing history==
[[File:Blake 1793 Job's Tormentors.jpg|thumb|Blake's 1793 engraving for The Book of Job. This engraving, although not included in the 1826 ''Illustrations'', most closely resembles the tenth illustration, ''Job Rebuked by his Friends''.]]

===Origins===
As early as 1785 Blake had sketched several ink studies of an illustration to Job.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/work.xq?workid=but551&amp;java=yes The William Blake archive]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=1138&amp;searchid=8884 One of the ink drawings] in the collection of the [[Tate gallery]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1793 Blake engraved a composition based upon these drawings, which he offered for sale in the ''Prospectus to the Public'' for twelve shillings.&lt;ref&gt;Erdman 1988, pp. 692–3&lt;/ref&gt; This, alongside an engraving of [[Ezekiel]], are the only extant examples of an intended series of biblical illustrations that were never completed. Blake reworked the Job plate sometime after 1804, but the resulting print was not included in the ''Illustrations''.

Blake's next illustration was the tempera painting ''Job and his Daughters'' (1800), commissioned by Thomas Butts (see gallery below).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=30221 The painting], in the collection of [[The National Gallery of Art]].&lt;/ref&gt; This has similarities to plate 20 of the engraved illustrations, but it is unclear whether the print was directly based upon it.&lt;ref name="Schoenherr 1997, p. 43"&gt;Schoenherr 1997, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

===The watercolours===
The engraved illustrations to Job originated as a series of [[watercolor|watercolour]]s that Blake painted in 1805-6, also for Butts. These 19 watercolours are referred to as the ''Butts Set'' (in the collection of the [[Morgan Library &amp; Museum]]).

A second set of watercolours, known as the ''Linell Set'' (mostly in the collection of the [[Fogg Art Museum]]) was produced in 1821 at the request of [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linell]]. Linell traced the watercolours from the "Butts set"; these tracings were then coloured in by Blake. As a result of this unusual process, the outlines of the ''Linell set'' are thicker and the colouring is uniformly darker, with a more restricted palette than the ''Butts set''. Blake also added two new designs to the ''Linell set'', and added copies of these to the Butts set. The two designs added were No.s 17 and 20, ''The Vision of Christ'' and ''Job and His Daughters''.

There is also another set of watercolours known as the ''New Zealand Set''. These were initially believed to be from Blake's hand, but their authenticity has been all but refuted by scholars such as [[Martin Butlin]]&lt;ref name="Butlin NZ"&gt;Butlin 1981, pp. 409-10&lt;/ref&gt; and Bo Lindberg.&lt;ref&gt;Paley, Morton D. (Nov. 1987) Untitled review in ''The Burlington Magazine'', Vol. 129, No. 1016 , pp. 747-748&lt;/ref&gt; They are most likely copies after the engravings by someone in the circle of John Linell, as they have no unique features.&lt;ref name="Butlin NZ" /&gt;

===The engravings===
[[File:Job's Evil Dreams.jpg|thumb|upright|Plate 11, showing the marginal glosses. The line directly above the centre image reads: ''Satan himself is transformed into an Angel of Light &amp; his Ministers into Ministers of Righteousness'']]

In 1823 Linell formally commissioned Blake to engrave plates for printing. Unlike Blake's own productions in [[relief etching]], this, like other commissioned work, was produced using the [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] method of engraving. However, Blake rejected the "mixed method" popular among commercial reproductive engravers of his time. The "mixed method" entailed lightly [[etching]] guidelines into the plate. The image was then engraved by the dot and lozenge method and by [[stipple engraving|stippling]]. Instead, Blake engraved his illustrations in pure line and without preliminary etching.

The engravings were completed in 1825, and an edition of 315 was produced in 1826. These were the last set of illustrations that Blake would complete. His illustrations of Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' were left unfinished upon his death.

The completed engravings differ from Blake's original watercolours mainly in the complex marginal designs that they employ. These comment upon the text with biblical quotes and paraphrases, and also contain images that reinforce the themes of the main illustrations.

After completing the engravings, Blake painted an additional tempera of ''Satan Smiting Job with Boils'' in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=1093&amp;searchid=8903&amp;tabview=text The Painting on the website of the Tate]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
The ''Book of Job'' was an important influence upon Blake's writings and art;&lt;ref&gt;Schoenherr 1997, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Blake apparently identified with Job, as he spent his lifetime unrecognized and impoverished. [[Harold Bloom]] has interpreted Blake's most famous lyric, ''[[The Tyger]]'', as a revision of God's rhetorical questions in the Book of Job concerning Behemoth and Leviathan.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom 2006, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Blake also depicted the story of Job throughout his career as an artist. The song of Enion in Night the Second of ''[[Vala, or The Four Zoas|The Four Zoas]]'' also demonstrates that Blake identified with Job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;!--  I am hiding the following section until I can find a citation for it.

The God of Job's comforters, who claim that Job's trials are punishment for his sins, is to Blake a false god, equivalent to the [[demiurge]] of the [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]]. This was more of a distinction between [[Elohim]] (the creator) and [[Yahweh]] (the law-giver) than it was any direct influence of Gnosticism.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

For Blake, Yahweh was an imposer of laws upon a humanity that could never keep to them&amp;mdash;he appears in the 11th illustration as a cloven-hoofed apparition who menaces Job while pointing to the tablets of the [[Ten Commandments|covenant]]. In Blake's mythology he is analogous to "the Accuser of Sin", the [[Spectre (Blake)|spectre]], and [[Urizen]]. This particular print was based upon Blake's earlier monotype, ''Elohim Creating Adam''.
[[File:William Blake 008.jpg|thumb|left|''Elohim Creating Adam'', 1795, in the collection of the [[Tate Gallery]], London.]] --&gt;

===Symbolism===
Blake used symbols extensively in the illustrations; most notable is the use  of right and left limbs in the figures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=1048&amp;searchid=8884&amp;tabview=text Analysis] of ''Job's Sons and Daughters Overwhelmed by Satan'' from the website of the [[Tate gallery]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Damon 1966, p. 3. Damon attributes the origin of this observation to Joseph Wickstead's ''Blake's Vision of the Book of Job'', 1924.&lt;/ref&gt; The right limb represents the spiritual and the good; the left, the material and evil. In plate six, [[Satan]] smites Job with boils using his left hand, and in plate 15 God indicates Behemoth and Leviathan with his left hand. Contrarily, God banishes Satan with his right hand in plate sixteen and speaks to Job from the whirlwind in plate fourteen with his right foot extended forward. Some scholars, however, have asserted that this systematic interpretation fails to account for inconsistencies in such symbolism and is excessively subjective.&lt;ref&gt;[[W.J.T. Mitchell|Mitchell, W.J.T.]] "Blake's Composite Art" in ''William Blake'' from Bloom's BioCritiques, ed [[Harold Bloom]]. Chelsea House Publishers, 2006. p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hebrew incorporated in the Butts watercolor ''Job's Evil Dreams'' and in the engravings ''title'' plate and plate numbered 2 ''Hast thou considered my Servant Job'' is analyzed in 'Blake's Hebrew Calligraphy.' &lt;ref&gt;Abraham Samuel Shiff "Blake's Hebrew Calligraphy" ''Blake An Illustrated Quarterly'', vol. 46, no. 2 (Fall 2012)[http://blake.lib.rochester.edu/blakeojs/index.php/blake/article/view/shiff462]&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme of an Orthodox Jewish ritual used in the composition of plate numbered 17 ''I have heard thee with the hearing of the Ear but now my Eye seeth thee'' is explained in 'Blake's Priestly Blessing: God Blesses Job.' &lt;ref&gt;Abraham Samuel Shiff "Blake's Priestly Blessing: God Blesses Job" ''Blake An Illustrated Quarterly'', vol. 47, no. 3 (winter 2013-14)[http://blake.lib.rochester.edu/blakeojs/index.php/blake/article/view/shiff473/shiff473]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artistic influences===
[[File:Behemoth.jpg|thumb|Detail of watercolour illustrating [[Behemoth]] and [[Leviathan]], upon which plate 15 of the engravings was based.]]
From early in his artistic career, Blake collected the prints of [[Albrecht Dürer]]. The depiction of Behemoth in plate 15 of the engravings is believed to have been influenced by ''[[Dürer's Rhinoceros]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Essick 1980, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Public Address'' (possibly from 1810&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/erdman.html Electronic version of Erdman's ''Complete Poetry and Prose''], click '''textual notes''' and then '''Public Address''' for information.&lt;/ref&gt;), Blake also indicates "Marc Antonio" ([[Marcantonio Raimondi]]), as an artist who inspired his linear technique of engraving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.uga.edu/nhilton/Blake/blaketxt1/public_address.html Ibid.] posted on the University of Georgia's website&lt;/ref&gt; "Julio Romano" ([[Giulio Romano]]), [[Raphael]], and [[Michelangelo]] are also mentioned by Blake in this address.

==Critical reception and legacy==
Of the edition of 315, only 20 copies of the illustrations were sold in Blake's lifetime, mostly to people within Blake's [[Ancients (art group)|immediate circle]] (such as [[Samuel Palmer]]). However, the ''Illustrations'' brought Blake an unprecedented degree of recognition. The [[Royal Academy]] and the [[King's Library]] each bought a copy; the former also awarded Blake £25. Such notables as [[John Constable]] and [[Lady Caroline Lamb]] invited him to dine, and the collector Charles Alders introduced him to [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yel1AU0YlGsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;client=safari#PPA33,M1 ''The Cambridge Companion to William Blake''], on Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Illustrations'' also gained critical acknowledgment after Blake's death more quickly than his [[William Blake's prophetic books|prophetic books]]. As early as 1857 [[John Ruskin]] wrote of Blake in ''The Elements of Drawing'' that &lt;blockquote&gt;The ''Book of Job'', engraved by himself, is of the highest rank in certain characters of imagination and expression; in the mode of obtaining certain effects of light it will also prove a very useful example to you. In expressing conditions of glaring and flickering light, Blake is greater than Rembrandt.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nEg8ULbzEJcC&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=Blake+is+greater+than+rembrandt#PPA223,M1 ''The Elements of Drawing'' in ''The Works of John Ruskin'', ed. Edward Tyas Cook, on Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The triple-mirror design in the background of plate 20, ''Job and his Daughters'', is believed to have influenced [[William Holman Hunt]]'s use of the same motif in his painting ''The Lady of Shalott''; Blake was highly regarded by the [[Pre-Raphaelites]].&lt;ref name="Schoenherr 1997, p. 43"/&gt;

[[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] based his ballet ''[[Job: A Masque for Dancing]]'' (first staged in 1931) upon the ''Illustrations''.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Table of Illustrations==
Blake did not give titles to the illustrations and the most prominent text in the margins is used by some scholars (such as [[S. Foster Damon]]) as a title for a given illustration. Others, such as Robert Essick, use descriptive titles.&lt;ref&gt;The titles based upon biblical verses are from Foster's ''Blake's Job'', and the descriptive titles are from the [http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/copy.xq?copyid=bb421.1&amp;java=yes William Blake Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, both are given here. In some cases the titles are the same.

Note that Blake's marginal texts are paraphrases of biblical passages and so will not be exactly identical to the linked verse.

The '''William Farquhar Collection of Natural History Drawings''' consists of 477 [[watercolor painting|watercolour]] [[botanical illustration|botanical drawings]] of plants and animals of [[Malacca]] and [[Singapore]] by unknown [[Chinese people|Chinese]] (probably Cantonese) artists that were commissioned between 1819 and 1823 by [[William Farquhar]] (26 February 1774 – 13 May 1839). The paintings were meant to be of scientific value with very detailed drawings, except for those of the birds which have text going beyond their original purpose.

==History==
[[File:Doorean; Durio stercorae; D. zibethina Linn (William Farquhar Collection, 1819–1823).jpg|thumb|The drawing of this [[Durian]] shows a good example of great scientific detail reflecting the inside of the fruit and structure of the seed.]]

During his tenure as [[Governors of Singapore#Resident of Singapore (1819-1826)|Resident and Commandant of Singapore]], Farquhar hired a group of professionally trained Chinese artists from Macau (as described by [[Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir|Munshi Abdullah]] &lt;ref name="Natural History Drawings EDM"/&gt; ) to paint watercolours of the flora and fauna of the [[Malay Peninsula]]. Farquhar donated these in eight volumes to the Museum of the [[Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland]] on 17 June 1826. In 1937, the Society lent six of the volumes to the Library of the British Museum (Natural History) (now the Library of the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]]), retaining the two volumes of botanical drawings in its own library. In 1991 the Natural History Museum returned the works to the Society for valuation, and on 20 October 1993 the Society offered them for sale by auction at [[Sotheby's]] in London, where they were acquired by Goh Geok Khim, founder of the brokerage firm GK Goh, for [[Singapore dollar|S$]]3 million. Goh donated the drawings to the [[National Museum of Singapore]] in 1995. As at 2011, the collection was believed to be worth at least $11 million. In 2011, 70 works from the collection were placed on permanent display in the [[Goh Seng Choo Gallery]] of the museum, named for Goh's father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Deepika Shetty|title=Precious menagerie: The William Farquhar collection of rare watercolours have finally found a permanent home|journal=[[The Straits Times]] (Life!)|date=9 September 2011|pages=D4–D5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Due to the variable quality of work done by some artists, some drawings have proved difficult to identify. Nonetheless, botanists have identified some of these problematic drawings, one a drawing of a male [[Raffles's malkoha]] in which the breast is too yellow. Others which have yet to be identified include a drawing of a climber similar to ''[[Smilax]]''. Plate 29 of the collection inscription reads ''Soogow'', probably a misspelling of "[[Adenanthera pavonina|saga]]". However, the drawing shows little resemblance to the latter.

Historians suggest that many of the backdrops of the drawings were copied from drawing manuals. One such example is a drawing of the [[greater mouse-deer|greater mousedeer]], the background of which shows a [[vine|leafless climber]] attached to a [[Rock (geology)|rock]]. Some scholars query this, as mousedeer do not live in such rocky habitats. This suggests that either the artists did not visit the habitat of the subject, or, if they did, that they were not particularly observant.

In the book [[Editions Didier Millet#Books published by Editions Didier Millet|Natural History Drawings: The Complete William Farquhar Collection, Malay Peninsula 1803–1818]] an article by Kwa Chong Guan suggest that there were two artist, one usually frames his works as seen in the illustration of the durian and one who does the opposite of the latter. Usually, the artist who draws a frame around his work does show fungi like shaped rocks while the other takes the rocks in its own natural form also the artist who draw frames usually has drawings of trees with its [[root]]s spread out while the other has its roots in a clenched like manner.

==Books==
The works were published in two volumes, the first being,''The William Farquhar Collection of Natural History Drawings'', published in 1999 showing 141 of these illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The William Farquhar Collection of Natural History Drawings|location=Singapore|publisher=Goh Geok Khim|year=1999|isbn=978-981-3065-82-6}} 2 volumes&lt;/ref&gt; A second version containing prints of all 477 works in the Farquhar collection was published by [[Editions Didier Millet]] and the National Museum of Singapore in 2010.

'''World Sensorium''' is a natural and inclusive world scent, a work of [[olfactory art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John |last=Harris |title=Journal of Aesthetic Education |volume= 13| issue =  4 (Oct. 1979) |pages= 5–15 |jstor= 3331746}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="artnews1"&gt;{{cite web |first=Barbara |last=Pollack |title=Scents and Sensibility |publisher= ARTnews |date=March 2011 |url=http://www.artnews.com/2011/03/01/scents-sensibility/}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[interdisciplinary]] artist [[Gayil Nalls]], who is based in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview conducted by Dr. Avery Gilbert, First Nerve (online) |date=April 4, 2009 |url= http://firstnerve.com/2009/04/portrait-of-artist-gayil-nalls.html |publisher=firstnerve.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large-scale conceptual project and [[social sculpture]], the world scent comprises the most culturally significant scents of 225 countries combined proportionally according to the statistical population data of the year 2000. ''World Sensorium'' has been recognized by [[UNESCO]] and the [[President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities]] as a global peace project and has been internationally exhibited in large public events, museums and galleries since its creation in 1999.

The research for the creation of ''World Sensorium'' established smells from natural flora that triggered [[olfactory memory]] for the majority of people of each nation, with the goal of interpreting the relationship between world flora and human numbers on earth, and to bring new awareness of the living world and its influence on the [[human spirit]] and [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]]. Through this work, Nalls has sought to foster an understanding of the larger evolutionary [[social construct]] of knowledge we share with others via the [[senses]].

The project of ''World Sensorium'' can be categorized as a contribution to the genres of Olfactory Art and Aesthetics, [[Participatory art]], and [[environmental art]] and functions along the trajectories of avant-garde and political or activist art.

==Creative Inspiration==

===Berlin Wall===
Nalls envisioned this concept for a “world scent” in 1989, eleven years prior to its completion and debut release. She describes the moment of inspiration for the formula as having occurred on December 28 of that year at the Brandenberg Gate, as the crowd pulled her on top of the [[Berlin Wall]]. As the connectivity passed through the bodies gathered, she envisioned a formula for ''World Sensorium'' where everyone would be counted.

===Relationship to Permutatude Theory===
''World Sensorium'' was created for the aesthetic of mass anatomy to evoke global memory and to evolve a metabolic collective. [[Permutatude Theory]] and science form a significant background to the ongoing project, as do the processes of cultural transformation and globalization. As a theoretical construct, conceived to be an embodied consciousness of “one world” the olfactory sculpture critically engages individuals with their sense of smell, often in performative settings.

==Methodology==

===Determination of ingredients===
Historical scents of all the countries of the world, culturally significant in medicine, mythology, the arts, anthropology, spiritual practices, diet and memory were identified based on survey research to obtain quantitative information that supplied the raw data for the creation of the scent, establishing the constituent natural plant oils “from tree, flower, grass or herb”.&lt;ref&gt;G. Nalls, inscription on Times Square World Sensorium Papperworks, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  
	
Many of the plants were identified in local vernacular and required additional research to verify the Latin or English names. In some instances an English name did not exist.  “Nalls located botanical taxonomy scholars from the [[New York Botanical Garden]] and ethno-botanists from the [[National Tropical Botanical Garden]] in Hawaii to assist in properly identifying the botanical names”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.resourcesforlivingwell.com/Articles/worldsensorium.html Kyle, Lorraine, ''World Sensorium: A Global Bouquet Attuning the Unity of All Cultures through Scent,]” NAHA Quarterly JJournal, Winter (2000)"&lt;/ref&gt; materials which had been referred to in colloquial terms such as, Senegal: Gowe ([[Cyperus articulatus]]), no English name, and American Samoa: Mos’oi ([[Cananga odorata]]), English name Ylang-ylang.

“The goal was to have to have each flora’s complex molecular compositions represented in its entirety so as to be perceived by humans as closely as it would if it were experienced in its habitat, in order to evoke the same psychological ad emotional responses, and neurological and immune functions as in the traditions of the culture.”&lt;ref&gt;(G. Nalls, "World Sensorium: Theory Practice and Significance of The World Social Olfactory Sculpture'', (dissertation), SmartLab, UEL, (September 2007) p.30)&lt;/ref&gt; To this end all raw materials were derived straight from botanical sources by means of distillation or extraction.

===Formula===
The composition of these ingredients was based on projected population percentages for each individual country for the year 2000. Everyone was counted.

==Impact as World Peace Project==

===Global communications===
In her quantitative research, Nalls crossed political boundaries in dialog with “countries the United States doesn’t get along with, such as Iran ([[rose]]), Iraq ([[date palm]]) Libya ([[orange blossom]]) and Cuba ([[tobacco]]).”&lt;ref&gt;Rita Giordano, “Artist to Unleash Global Scent of Peace Over Times Square,” The Denver Post, Denver, CO, December 29, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, communications spanned several months, but an especially “poignant moment in the creation of ''World Sensorium'' was the day the representative from the Israeli Embassy in Washington and the Palestinian representative from the united Nations called Nalls by phone within minutes of each other to report that their national choices were both the Olive tree because of its long revered association with peace.”&lt;ref&gt;Kyle, Lorraine, ''World Sensorium: A Global Bouquet Attuning the Unity of All Cultures through Scent,” NAHA Quarterly JJournal, Winter (2000)"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognition and Honors===
In 1998, in recognition of Nalls’ outstanding creative achievement, ''World Sensorium'' was endorsed by the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities and was granted sponsorship by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as an original cultural initiative building goodwill and peace in conjunction with the United Nation's International Year for Culture of Peace. In his letter to Nalls, Director-General, Dr. Federico Mayor, a brain biochemist, said that ''World Sensorium'' is a “highly original cultural initiative” that “will certainly contribute to creating a climate of goodwill and peace at this memorable moment in time” leading to “understanding and collaboration among nations”.&lt;ref&gt;As stated in letter to Nalls, September 5, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural Significance==

===Olfactory Art and Aesthetics===
With ''World Sensorium'' and more recent works, Nalls has advanced concepts of aesthetics to consider the olfactory sense over the historically privileged sense of vision. While the visual remains dominant, artists have and are now increasingly working with the sense of smell to produce emotionally and phenomenologically resonant works in the emergent genre of Olfactory Art. Nalls “like many other olfactory artists, uses only natural fragrances and essential oils. “I call it ‘rewilding the mind,’” she says.&lt;ref name="artnews1"/&gt;

===Participatory Art===
For Nalls, the connection between olfaction and social or participatory art is rooted in the evolutionary biology of the sense of smell. As the oldest sense, olfaction has the uncanny ability to trigger memory (individual and collective), and its significant role in chemosensory communication is critical to the collective action that is necessary for participatory social and art processes. 
		
''World Sensorium'' is a participatory project in its all-inclusive ethos, Nalls’ intention for its en masse experience, and in its very creation which at times required to assistance of volunteers to gather the phytogenic materials.  “[[Randia aculeata]] an ingredient from the Netherlands 	Antilles, could only be found locally in Florida. A team was rushed to the site before Hurricane Lenny came in and swept through the area.” to harvest the leaves.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Klepacki, “Times Square Revelers To Ring in New Fragrance,” Women’s Wear Daily, December 23, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Avant-gardism and Political Art===
In its use of extant culturally significant plant materials, Nalls advances the advant-garde notion that art should be brought closer to the praxis of life. ''World Sensorium'' is all-inclusive in its conception–a reflection of actual human-plant relations, making every experience of ''World Sensorium'' a connection to the world's collective ecology and human consciousness. When experienced en masse as in Times Square, Nalls initiated a collective metabolic experience, and introduced a universal language for cross-cultural efforts toward peace, by evoking our co-evolution with nature. Ken Johnson called ''World Sensorium'' a "utopian project" and "an olfactory metaphor for world unity" by an "earnest and rather grandiose conceptualist".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Ken, Art in Review, New York Times, January 21, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
