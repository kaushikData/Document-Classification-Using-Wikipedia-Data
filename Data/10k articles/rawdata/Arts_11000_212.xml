'''Fashion in the period 1700–1750''' in [[Europe]]an and European-influenced countries is characterized by a widening silhouette for both men and women following the tall, narrow look of the [[1650–1700 in fashion|1680s and 90s]]. This era is defined as late Baroque/Rococo style. The new fashion trends introduced during this era had a greater impact on society, affecting not only royalty and aristocrats, but also middle and even lower classes. Clothing during this time can be characterized by soft pastels, light, airy, and asymmetrical designs, and playful styles. Wigs remained essential for men and women of substance, and were often white; natural hair was powdered to achieve the fashionable look.

Distinction was made in this period between ''full dress'' worn at court and for formal occasions, and ''undress'' or everyday, daytime clothes. As the decades progressed, fewer and fewer occasions called for full dress, which had all but disappeared by the end of the century.

Fashion designers became more recognizable during this period, as men and women were eager to be dressed in the latest trends and styles. Fashion magazines emerged during this era, originally aimed at intelligent readers, but quickly capturing the attention of lower classes with their colorful illustrations and up-to-date fashion news.

==Women's fashion==

===Gowns and dresses===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Antoine Watteau]] --&gt; 
[[Image:Phillips Tea Party.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A rigid, upright posture with a sharp "break" at the bust is characteristic of the stiffly boned stays of the 1730s. These English ladies wear formal mantuas for tea.]]
[[Image:Elisabeth Christine of Braunschweig Wolfenbuettel.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Empress Elisabeth Christine in riding costume.]]
In the early decades of the new century, formal dress consisted of the stiff-bodiced [[Mantua (clothing)|mantua]]. A closed (or "round") [[petticoat]], sometimes worn with an apron, replaced the open draped mantua skirt of the [[1650–1700 in fashion|previous period]].  This formal style then gave way to more relaxed fashions.  

The ''robe à la française'' or [[sack-back gown]] had a tight bodice with a low-cut square neckline, usually with large ribbon bows down the front, wide panniers, and was lavishly trimmed with all manner of lace, ribbon, and flowers. With flowing pleats from the shoulders was originally an undress fashion. At its most informal, this gown was unfitted both front and back and called a ''sacque''. With a more relaxed style came a shift away from heavy fabrics, such as satin and velvet, to Indian cotton, silks and damasks. Also, these gowns were often made in lighter pastel shades that gave off a warm, graceful and childlike appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Kemper, Rachel H., "Costume," pg. 105 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, for formal wear, the front was fitted to the body by means of a tightly-laced underbodice, while the back fell in loose box pleats called "Watteau pleats" from their appearance in the paintings of [[Antoine Watteau]].

The less formal ''robe à l'anglaise'', [[Close-bodied gown]] or "nightgown" also had a pleated back, but the pleats were sewn down to fit the bodice to the body to the waist. It featured a snug bodice with a full skirt worn without panniers, usually cut a bit longer in the back to form a small train, and often some type of lace kerchief was worn around the neckline.

Either gown could be closed in front (a "round gown") or open to reveal a matching or contrasting [[petticoat]].
Open-fronted bodices could be filled in with a decorative [[stomacher]], and toward the end of the period a lace or linen kerchief called a ''fichu'' could be worn to fill in the low neckline.

Sleeves were bell- or trumpet-shaped, and caught up at the elbow to show the frilled or lace-trimmed sleeves of the [[shift (clothing)|shift]] ([[chemise]]) beneath. Sleeves became narrower as the period progressed, with a frill at the elbow, and elaborate separate ruffles called [[engageante]]s were [[tack (sewing)|tacked]] to the shift sleeves, in a fashion that would persist into the [[1750–1795 in fashion|1770s]].

Necklines on dresses became more open as time went on allowing for greater display of ornamentation of the neck area. A thick band of lace was often sewed onto the neckline of a gown with ribbons, flowers, and/or jewels adorning the lace. Jewelry such as strings of [[pearl]]s, ribbons, or lace frills were tied high on the neck. Finally, one other large element of 18th century women's dress wear became the addition of the frilled neckband, a separate piece from the rest of the dress. This ornament was popularized sometime around 1730 .&lt;ref&gt;B. Payne, "Women's Costume of the Fifteenth Century", History of Costume: From the Ancient Egyptians to the Twentieth Century (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

Marie Antoinette introduced the chemise à la reine, a loose white gown with a colorful silk sash around the waist. This was considered shocking for women at first, as no corset was worn and the natural figure was apparent. However, women seized upon this style, using it as a symbol of their increased liberation.

===Underwear===
The ''stays'' or [[corset]] of the early 18th century were long-waisting and cut with a narrow back, wide front, and shoulder straps; the most fashionable stays pulled the shoulders back until the shoulder blades almost touched.  The resulting  silhouette, with shoulders thrown back, very erect posture and a high, full bosom, is characteristic of this period and no other.

Skirts were worn over small, domed [[hoop skirt|hoops]], called panniers, in the 1730s and early 1740s. Depending on the occasion, these panniers varied in size. Smaller hoops were worn in everyday settings and larger hoops for more formal occasions, which later widened to as much as three feet to either side at the French court of [[Marie Antoinette]].

The shift ([[chemise]]) or smock had full sleeves early in the period and tight, elbow-length sleeves in the 1740s as the sleeves of the gown narrowed.

Some women wore drawers (underpants) in England. For instance, as early as 1676 inventory of Hillard Veren had "3 pair of women drawers". Although, they are not common in English or New England inventories during the 17th and 18th century. Clothing Through American History: The British Colonial Era, by Kathleen A. Staples, Madelyn C. Shaw page 245

Woolen waistcoats were worn over the corset and under the gown for warmth, as were petticoats quilted with wool batting.

[[Handbag|Free-hanging pockets]] were tied around the waist and were accessed through ''pocket slits'' in the gown or petticoat.

Loose gowns, sometimes with a wrapped or surplice front closure, were worn over the shift ([[chemise]]), petticoat and stays (corset) for at-home wear, and it was fashionable to have one's portrait painted wearing these fashions.

===Outerwear===
[[Riding habit]]s consisted of a fitted, thigh- or knee-length coat similar to those worn by men, usually with a matching petticoat. Ladies wore masculine-inspired shirts and tricorne hats for riding and hunting.

When outdoors, ladies also wore elbow-length capes, often lined with fur for warmth.

===Fabrics and colors===

In the early years of this period, pastel silk hoods and light colors became fashionable at the French court for mature women, under the influence of [[Madame de Maintenon]]. Younger women also wore light or bright colors, but the preference was for solid-colored or floral silks with ornamentation.

Gradually, trim in the form of applied lace and fabric ''robings'' (strips of ruched, gathered or pleated fabric) replaced the plain style.  Ribbon bows, lacing, and rosettes became popular, as did boldly patterned fabrics. Silk gowns and [[stomacher]]s were often intricately embroidered in floral and botanical motifs, demonstrating great attention to detail and care for an accurate portrayal of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ashelford|first=Jane|title=The Art of Dress Clothes and Society 1500-1914|year=1996|publisher=National Trust Enterprises Limited|location=Great Britain|isbn=0-8109-6317-5|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A mid-century vogue for striped fabrics had the stripes running different directions on the trim and the body of the gown.

[[Chintz]], Indian cotton fabric with block-printed imaging on a white base, was wildly fashionable.  Bans against their importation to protect the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[silk]], [[linen]] and [[wool]]en industries did nothing to reduce their desirability.  Brocaded silks and woolens had similar colorful floral patterns on light-colored grounds.  Blends of wool and silk or wool and linen ([[linsey-woolsey]]) were popular. Until the 1730s, European textiles were of inferior quality that could not match the complex fashionable designs of [[Calico (textile)|Indian calicoes]]. Europe was able to produce high quality petit teints (colors that faded with light and washing), but they were unable to produce grand teints (permanent colors resistant to light and wear).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lemire|first=Beverly|author2=Giorgie Reillo|title=East &amp; West: Textiles and Fashion in Early Modern Europe|journal=Journal of Social History|year=2008|volume=41|series=4|pages=887–916|doi=10.1353/jsh.0.0019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Footwear and accessories===
[[Image:18th century shoes mules.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Shoes of 1742 (left) and 1731 (right).]]
The '''[[shoe]]''' of the [[1650–1700 in fashion|previous period]] with its curved heel, squarish toe, and tie over the instep gave way in the second decade of the 18th century to a shoe with a high, curved heel. Backless [[mule (footwear)|mules]] were worn indoors and out (but not on the street). Toes were now pointed.  This style of shoe would remain popular well into the [[1750–1795 in fashion|next]] period. Shoes at the time had many variations of decoration, some even included metal wrapped threads.&lt;ref name="The Metropolitan Museum of Art"&gt;{{cite web|title=Slippers|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/156126?rpp=20&amp;pg=1&amp;ao=on&amp;ft=shoes+1700&amp;img=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{clear}}

Women, particularly in France, began wearing a '''boutonnière''', or a small bouquet of fresh flowers in a "bosom bottle." About four inches in length, these glass or tin bottles were small enough to discreetly tuck into the bosom or hair, but also just large enough to contain water to keep the flowers from wilting.&lt;ref name=Wilcox&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilcox|first=R. Turner|title=The Mode in Costume|year=1958|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York, NY|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Makeup===
An 18th-century toilette began with a heavy white foundation made from white lead, egg white, and a variety of other substances. This was overlaid with white powder (typically potato or rice powder), rouge, and deep red or cherry lip color.

Tiny pieces of fabric, known as patches, in the shapes of dots, hearts, stars, etc. were applied to the face with adhesive. The fashion is thought to have originated as a way of disguising pox scars and other blemishes, but gradually developed coded meanings. A patch near the mouth signified flirtatiousness; one on the right cheek denoted marriage; one on the left cheek announced engagement; one at the corner of the eye signified a mistress.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.vintageconnection.net/ModesInMakeup.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suits===
The male suit, also known as the habit à la française, made of three parts: the [[justaucorps]], a jacket, and [[breeches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bigelow|first=Marybelle S.|title=Fashion in History: Western Dress, Prehistoric to Present|year=1979|publisher=Burgess Publishing Company|location=Minneapolis, Minnesota|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; The waistcoat was the most decorative piece, usually lavishly embroidered or displaying patterned fabrics. In the early 18th century the Breeches usually stopped at the knee, with white stockings worn underneath and heeled shoes, which usually had large square buckles.  Coats were worn closer to the body and were not as skirt-like as during the Baroque era.  They were also worn more open to showcase the elaborate waistcoats..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Byrde|first=Penelope|title=The Male Image Men's Fashion in Britain 1300-1970|year=1979|publisher=The Anchor Press Britain|location=Great Britain|isbn=0-7134-0860X|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fabrics for men were primarily silks, velvets, and brocades, with woolens used for the middle class and for sporting costumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Douglas A.|title=Costume History and Style|year=1983|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|isbn=0-13-181214-9|page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Footwear===

In the early 18th century, men's shoes continued to have a squared toe, but the heels were not as high. From 1720-1730, the heels became even smaller, and the shoes became more comfortable, no longer containing a block toe. The shoes from the first half of the century often contained an oblong buckle usually embedded with stones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Geoffrey|title=Fashion Accessories Since 1500|year=1987|publisher=Drama Book Publishers|location=New York|pages=62, 67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accessories===

Upper class men often wore a cane as part of their outfits, suspending it by a loop from one of their [[waistcoat]] buttons to allow their hands to properly hold snuff-boxes or handkerchiefs. The cane was thus less functional and rather for the sake of fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cookson|first=Nesfield|title=The Costume Book|year=1935|publisher=Robert M. McBride &amp; Company, New York|location=New York, NY|pages=164–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hairstyles and headgear===
Wigs in a variety of styles were worn for different occasions and by different age groups.

The large high parted wig of the 1690s remained popular from 1700 until around 1720.  During this time various colors were worn, but white was becoming more popular and the curls were getting tighter. The cadogan style of men’s hair developed and became popular during this period, with horizontal rolls of hair over the ears. Later, wigs or the natural hair were worn long, brushed back from the forehead and ''clubbed'' or tied back at the nape of the neck with a black ribbon. From about 1720, a bag wig gathered the back hair in a black silk bag. Black ribbons attached to the bag were brought to the front and tied in a bow in a style called a "solitaire".

Wide-brimmed [[hat]]s with brims turned up on three sides into [[tricorne]]s were worn throughout the era. They were an essential element to the "domino", a stylish costume for masquerade balls, which became an increasingly popular mode of entertainment. The "domino" style consisted of a mask, a long cape, and a [[tricorne]] [[hat]], all usually constructed of dark colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ribiero|first=Aileen|title=The Dress Worn at Masquerades in England 1730 to 1790|year=1984|publisher=Garland|location=New York, NY|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children's fashion==
{{contradict|date=August 2014}}
Toddler boys and girls wore low-necked gowns.  ''[[Leading strings]]''—narrow straps of fabric attached to the gown at the shoulder—functioned as a sort of leash to keep the child from straying too far or falling as they learned to walk.

Children older than toddlers continued to wear clothing which was in many respects simply a smaller version of adult clothing.  Although it is often said that children wore miniature versions of adult clothing, this is something of a myth.  Girls wore back-fastening gowns, trimmed much more simply than women's. The skirt of a girl's gown was not split down the front, as women's typically were.&lt;ref name="Art"&gt;Ashelford, Jane, ''The Art of Dress''&lt;/ref&gt;  Girls did not wear jackets or bedgowns.  Boys wore shirts, breeches, waistcoats and coats a man would, but often wore their necks open, and the coat was fitted and trimmed differently from a man's, and boys often went bareheaded.  During some decades of the 18th Century, boys' shirts and coats had different collars and cuffs than a man's.  Even if the size is not apparent, it is usually possible to tell a child's garment from an adult's.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

1.A simple trimmed lace and cloth dress English/French cut. (1710)

2. Silk dress supported by panniers. Note that there is no central parting to the dress. The low cut neckline is also less ornamented than a contemporary women's would be. (1718)

3.A group scene of a girl and two boys. Boys were breeched at around 5-10. The girl wears a low neckline that was customary for young girls and boys. (1724)

4.An example of an older girl not far from adulthood. The neckline is still lower than a womans but is more ornamented than that of a child. (1727)

5. The girl sitting holding a fan is displaying her leading strings that her mother would have used to make sure she didn't fall when learning to walk. (1730)

6.A boy of around 10 who has been breeched and wears a Frock coat of a child's pattern. The cuffs and frills would have been less obvious on a grown man. (1738)

7. A middle class girl c1740. The simpler fabric and colours used in her dress show her not to be of noble birth but not in poverty either.Again the low neckline is typical of girls of that age.(1740)

8.A group portrait of children in fine clothes of the period. The boy has been newly breeched while the girls have the characteristic low neckline of children. (1745)

==Satirising fashion==
[[Joseph Addison]] in 1711 devoted an issue of ''[[The Spectator]]''&lt;ref&gt;The Spectator no. 119. 17 July 1711&lt;/ref&gt; to satirising fashion, by noting how the country fashions lagged behind those in [[London]].  "As I proceeded in my journey I observed the petticoat grew scantier and scantier, and about threescore miles from ''London'' was so very unfashionable, that a woman might walk in it without any manner of inconvenience" and so on.

The film is based on [[Janet Frame]]'s three autobiographies, ''To the Is-Land'' (1982), ''An Angel at My Table'' (1984), and ''The Envoy from Mirror City'' (1984).&lt;ref&gt;Hunter Cordaiy, "An Angel at My Table", ''Cinema Papers'', November 1990 p 32-36&lt;/ref&gt; The film was very well received, winning multiple awards including at the [[New Zealand Film and Television awards]], the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] and received second prize at the [[Venice Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzonscreen.com/title/an-angel-at-my-table-1990-0e1/background#critique_0|title=Background - An Angel at My Table - Film - NZ On Screen|website=www.nzonscreen.com|accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
''An Angel at My Table'' is a dramatisation of the autobiographies of New Zealand author [[Janet Frame]]. Originally produced as a television [[mini-series]], the film, as with Frame's autobiographies, is divided into three sections, with the lead role played by three actresses who portray Frame at different stages of her life: Karen Fergusson (child), Alexia Keogh (adolescent), and [[Kerry Fox]] (adult). The film follows Frame from when she grows up in a poor family, through her years in a mental institution, and into her writing years after her escape.

==Impact and reception==
''An Angel at My Table'' was the first film from [[New Zealand]] to be screened at the [[Venice Film Festival]], where it received multiple standing ovations and was awarded the Grand Special Jury Prize despite evoking yells of protest that it did not win The Golden Lion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzonscreen.com/person/jane-campion|title=Jane Campion - NZ On Screen|website=www.nzonscreen.com|accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to virtually sweeping the local New Zealand film awards, it also took home the prize for best foreign film at the [[Independent Spirit Awards]] and the International Critics' Award at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]]. The film not only established [[Jane Campion]] as an emerging director and launched the career of [[Kerry Fox]], but it also introduced a broader audience to [[Janet Frame]]'s writing.

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, stating; "[The film] tells its story calmly and with great attention to human detail and, watching it, I found myself drawn in with a rare intensity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19910621/REVIEWS/106210301/1023 |title=An Angel at My Table  |author=Ebert, Roger |date=21 June 1991 |work= |publisher=''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' |accessdate=3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also received praise in ''The Guardian'' where Derek Malcolm called it "one of the very best films of the year". ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' described the film as "deeply moving" and "visionary" while ''Variety'' described it as being "totally absorbing".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2535">'''Atelier Viking''' is a studio and an [[artist-run initiative]] based in [[Douala]], [[Cameroon]].

Artist [[Viking Kanganyam|Viking Kanganyam André]] founded atelier Viking in March 1976 to promote contemporary art in Cameroon. The paucity of art galleries in Douala encouraged Kanganyam to create a space where artists could be trained and exhibited. Viking taught visual arts (painting, sculpture, graphic art, drawing and serygraphy) to small groups of students. Viking encouraged his students to explore the potentialities of all media and specifically the possibility of transforming and re-using materials found in loco. Concurrently to their activity of visual artists, they worked in advertising. Since 2001, Viking decided to devote his space mostly to exhibitions.  

Atelier Viking is located in the neighbourhood of Bessengue, Rue Jamot face Garage Technique Auto, 100mt from Mobil Bonakouamuang. It collaborates with [[Art Wash]].

'''''Betrayed''''' is a 1988 American [[Drama (film and television)|drama]] [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] film directed by [[Costa-Gavras]], written by [[Joe Eszterhas]], and starring [[Debra Winger]] and [[Tom Berenger]]. The plot is roughly based upon the terrorist activities of American [[neo-Nazi]] and [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] [[Robert Jay Mathews|Robert Mathews]] and his group [[The Order (white supremacist group)|The Order]].

==Plot==
Set in the American Midwest, the film begins with the murder of a Jewish radio host in [[Chicago]]. [[FBI]] [[undercover]] agent Catherine Weaver, alias Katie Phillips, sets out to [[wiktionary:Infiltrate|infiltrate]] a farming community, suspected of harboring those responsible.

After receiving a warm welcome from land-owner and farmer Gary Simmons, his two children and [[extended family]], she begins to believe that the FBI lead is erroneous. Throwing caution to the wind, she falls in love with Simmons, a [[Vietnam War]] veteran who appears to command the respect of the local community. A short while later, her suspicions are aroused by talk of family secrets and as more chilling events unfold, Katie is exposed to the fact that Gary is the leader of a [[Ku Klux Klan|Klan-like]] [[white supremacy]] group involved in heinous, often gut-wrenching, acts of racial violence.

In too deep, Katie pleads with boss and mentor Michael Carnes to release her from the assignment, but he refuses, instead turning the screw on her mixed loyalties. Ultimately, she must betray either the man she loves or the country she has sworn to protect.

==Cast==

* [[Tom Berenger]] as Gary Simmons

==Reception==

===Critical response===
''Betrayed'' was met with mixed reviews, with [[Rotten Tomatoes]] giving it a 42% "Rotten" rating based on 12 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1002205-betrayed/ RottenTomatoes.com rating information]&lt;/ref&gt; Winger's performance was praised by some reviewers, who felt she was successful in conveying complex and mixed emotions throughout. Critics of the film point to a muddled and sometimes unbelievable unravelling of the plot.

The opening sequence is loosely based on the 1984 murder of Denver DJ [[Alan Berg]], which was carried out by white supremacists known as [[The Order (white supremacist group)|The Order]].

In a 1996 interview, Berenger named ''Betrayed'' as his favorite film, shrugging off any media criticism with the retort "It was exactly what it was meant to be".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/tom-berenger/person/29375/biography.html Tom Berenger Biography at www.tv.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928121632/http://www.tv.com/tom-berenger/person/29375/biography.html |date=September 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bohlen, Meyer, Gibson and Associates''', or '''BMG''', is an architectural firm based in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]. It was founded in Indianapolis on April 10, 1853, as '''D. A. Bohlen, Architect''' by  [[Diedrich A. Bohlen]], German immigrant. In 1884, after Diedrich's son, Oscar D. Bohlen, joined the firm it was renamed '''D. A. Bohlen and Son'''. Four successive generations of Bohlen architects have worked at the firm: Diedrich A. Bohlen (its founder), Oscar D. Bohlen (Diedrich's son), August C. Bohlen (Diedrich's grandson), and Robert L. Bohlen (Diedrich's great-grandson). The firm specialized in institutional projects, especially civic, religious, and educational buildings. In 1971 Melvin B. G. Meyer acquired majority interest in the firm, which adopted its name in reference to its founder and its two principal architects, Meyer and John M. Gibson. The architectural firm is among the oldest still operating in the United States. More than twenty of its projects are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

==History==
[[Diedrich A. Bohlen]], a native of [[Cadenberge]], [[Kingdom of Hanover]], immigrated to the [[United States]] around 1851, and founded D. A.

Bohlen's firm is among the oldest architectural firms still operating in the United States. Four successive generation of Bohlen architects have worked at the Indianapolis firm. Diedrich Augustus Bohlen founded the firm in 1853. Oscar Diedrich Bohlen, D. A.'s son, joined the firm around 1882, and became a partner in 1884. August Carl Bohlen, Oscar's son, joined the firm in 1910, and later co-authored [[Indiana]]'s original building codes. Robert Lesh Bohlen, August's son, joined the firm in 1946.&lt;ref name=Walton42-44-45&gt;{{cite journal | author=Lloyd B.

D. A. Bohlen, Architect, went through several name and ownership changes after Bohlen's descendants, new partners, and associates joined the firm. In 1876 Matthew Roth became D. A. Bohlen's business partner, and for a few years the firm was named Bohlen and Roth. In 1884, after Bohlen's son, Oscar, joined the firm, its name was changed to D. A. Bohlen and Son, Architects. Following D. A. Bohlen's death on June 1, 1890, Oscar continued the family firm on his own until 1910, except for the period between 1897 and 1899, when Hugo Zigrosser was his partner.&lt;ref name=HBR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Douglas A.

Following Robert's death in 1960, August Bohlen entered into a partnership with David V. Burns.&lt;ref name=HBR/&gt;&lt;ref name=Probst10&gt;{{cite book |author1=George T.

The firm was renamed Bohlen and Burns Architects in 1961, and incorporated as Bohlen, Burns and Associates in 1967. With August's retirement in 1970, ownership passed from the Bohlen family to Melvin B.G. Meyer and John M. Gibson, the firm's main architects, and Noel Cord, the firm's accountant. Meyer, who joined firm in 1946 as a draftsman, served as its main designer from 1948 to 1990. In 1971 Meyer acquired majority interest in the firm, which adopted the name, Bohlen, Meyer, Gibson and Associates, Inc. in reference to its founder, D. A. Bohlen, and its two principal architects, Meyer and Gibson. Mike Rogers and Hans Megerling, also architects in the firm, replaced Cord as investors in the firm in 1980. Following Meyer's retirement from the firm in 1990, Mr. and Mrs. John V. Schneider of the Schneider Corporation purchased the architectural firm. Although the firm's original location in Indianapolis is not known, its offices were housed in several downtown locations, before moving to more suburban locations, including the Meadows Office Complex (1970–78), Castleton, (1978–91), and North Post Road, (1991– ).&lt;ref name=HBR/&gt;&lt;ref name=Meyer&gt;{{cite news | title =Architect Melvin B.

==Major clients and projects==
The firm specialized in institutional structures for religious, educational, and civic institutions, although it did design some private residences for well-do-to families, such as the French mansard-style Morris-Butler House (1864) in Indianapolis and the [[Jacobethan|Neo-Jacobean]]-style Churchman House (1871) on a farm that later became part of [[Beech Grove, Indiana]].&lt;ref name=MBHouse/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Wilbur Peat | title =Indiana Houses of the Nineteenth Century | work= | volume =   | series = |  edition =  | pages=131 and 156 and plates 155 and 181  | publisher = Indiana Historical Society| location = Indianapolis  | year = 1962  | OCLC=191192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Churchman&gt;"Biographical Sketches" in {{cite web | title =Francis M.

Most of the Bohlen firm’s early projects were in the Indianapolis area. Notable exceptions include the [[French Lick Springs Hotel]] (1898), designed by Oscar Bohlen, in [[French Lick, Indiana]], and numerous buildings for the [[Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods]] at [[Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, Indiana]].&lt;ref name=Probst106&gt;Probst and Reichmann, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;  The firm's architects also designed Oldenburg Convent (1899), Oldenburg Academy (1898), and other buildings for the [[Third Order of Saint Francis#Sisters of St. Francis (Oldenburg, Indiana)|Sisters of Saint Francis]] at [[Oldenburg, Indiana]], as well as buildings at The Carmel of Saint Joseph, a [[Carmelites|Carmelite]] monastery in [[Allendale, Indiana]].&lt;ref name=Meyer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =Historical Sketch of the Convent and Academy of the Sisters of St. Francis in Oldenburg, Indiana: and the Work of Their Community in the United States | publisher =Sisters of Saint Francis Community | series = | volume = | edition = | year =1901 | location =Oldenburg, IN | pages = | url =  | OCLC=10864015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891 Bohlen's firm submitted a design for a proposed Indiana building to be erected at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] (1893) at [[Chicago]]. The selection committee narrowed its choice to two plans, one from the Bohlen firm and the other from [[Wing &amp; Mahurin|Wing and Mahurin]] of [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]]. In a controversial move from the committee's leadership, a design proposed by Chicago architect [[Henry Ives Cobb]] was recommended to the Indiana Board of World's Fair Managers and built for the exposition, despite protests from the Indiana architects who argued that Cobb's plan arrived after the contest deadline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Frank A.

===Sisters of Providence projects===
One of the firm's earliest and long-standing clients was the [[Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods]]. D. A. Bohlen established a relationship with the Sisters of Providence in the 1850s that continued over several decades. Boheln's firm completed "more than sixty projects" for the Sisters.&lt;ref name=HBR/&gt;

Providence motherhouse and chapel (1853–4, 1863), Foley Hall (1860), and the [[Church of the Immaculate Conception (Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, Indiana)|Church of the Immaculate Conception]] (1892) are among Diedrich Bohlen's early renovations and designs for the Sisters of Providence on the grounds of [[Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College]], a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[liberal arts college]] near [[Terre Haute, Indiana]].&lt;ref name=Foley/&gt;&lt;ref name=Logan56&gt;{{cite book | author=Eugenia Logan | title =The History of the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods | publisher =Benziger Brothers | series =History of the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, Indiana | volume =II | edition = | year=1949 | location =New York | page =56 | url =  | OCLC=5523512}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author =Mary Roger Madden | title =The Path Marked Out  | publisher =Sisters of Providence | series = History of the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, Indiana; Sisters of Providence History Series| volume =III | edition = | year =1991 | location =Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, IN | pages=128–29 | url =  | OCLC= 27393597}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fire destroyed the motherhouse in 1889, and Foley Hall has been demolished, but the Church of the Immaculate Conception is still in use.&lt;ref&gt;Logan, pp. 326–28, and {{cite book | title =A Journey of Love, Mercy, and Justice: A Pictorial History of the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, Celebrating 150 Years of Service Among the People of God | publisher=The Sisters of Providence | series = | volume = | edition = | year =1989 | location =Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, IN | page=15 | url =  | isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction on the Church of the Immaculate Conception began in 1886. After D. A. Bohlen's death in 1890, Oscar continued his father's legacy as community architect at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods. The church's interior decoration was completed in 1907, and it underwent a major renovation in 1987, with Melvin Meyer as the project architect.&lt;ref&gt;Madden, p. 183; ''A Journey of Love, Mercy, and Justice'', p. 24; and {{cite book | title =The Church of the Immaculate Conception | publisher =Sisters of Providence | series = | volume = | edition = | year =1987 | location =Saint Mary–of-the-Woods, IN | pages = | url =  | isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bohlen firm designed several additional buildings for Sisters of Providence, including an addition to Foley Hall (1897), a new novitiate (1904), Guerin Hall (1913), Saint Cecilia Conservatory of Music (1913), Le Fer Hall (1924), and [[Blessed Sacrament Chapel (Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, Indiana)|Blessed Sacrament Chapel]] (1924).&lt;ref name=Foley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madden, pp. 135–37, 382–84, 396, and 519–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Bohlen, the last of D. A. Bohlen's descendants to design a building for the Sisters of Providence, designed Owens Hall (1960).&lt;ref&gt;Madden, p. 573.&lt;/ref&gt; The firm's president, Melvin B. G. Meyer, designed a new library and chapel in the Providence motherhouse and Providence Center.&lt;ref name=Meyer/&gt;

===Indianapolis projects===
Many of the firm's most notable religious, civic, commercial, and residential buildings were erected in Indianapolis. These include buildings designed by the firm's founder, D. A. Bohlen, his descendants, and Melvin B. G. Meyer.

Bohlen's early commissions in the city included the Charles Mayer store façade (1853), the dome for Odd Fellows Grand Lodge (1854), and the Metropolitan (1858), the city's first theater.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Costigan designed the Odd Fellows Grand Lodge, but D. A. Bohlen completed it after Costigan's death. See {{cite book | author=Berry R. Sulgrove | title =History of Indianapolis and Marion County, Indiana | publisher =L. H. Everts and Company | series = | volume = | edition = | year =1884 | location =Philadelphia | page =373 | url = | OCLC=3558051}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indianapolis's German community was another source of early commissions for the firm. D. A. Bohlen was the architect for the city's German-English Independent School (1860) on Maryland Street and the General German Protestant Orphans' Home (1872), later known as Pleasant Run Children's Home, on South State Avenue.&lt;ref name=Probst36-37&gt;Probst and Reichmann, pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Walton44&gt;Walton, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

The firm designed several of Indianapolis's notable churches and cemetery structures. D. A. Bohlen designed the United Evangelical Zion Church (1866) on West Ohio Street; his firm also designed its replacement, Zion United Church of Christ (1913), at North and New Jersey Streets.&lt;ref&gt;Probst and Reichmann, p. 10, and {{cite book| title =The History of Nine Urban Churches| publisher =The Riley-Lockerbie Ministerial Association of Downtown Indianapolis | location =Indianapolis, IN | url =| isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; D.

D. A. Bohlen also designed [[St. John the Evangelist Catholic Church (Indianapolis, Indiana)|Saint John the Evangelist Catholic Church]] (1871), the main structure in a cluster of parish buildings on the southwest corner of Georgia Street and Capitol Avenue in Indianapolis that includes a D. A. Bohlen-designed rectory (1863) and bishop's residence (1878). D. A. Bohlen's son, Oscar, designed the twin spires on the two towers that flank the church's main [[façade]] and supervised their construction in 1893.&lt;ref name=Widner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Divita21-23&gt;{{cite book | author =James J.

Both of these buildings were later demolished.&lt;ref name=Divita21-23/&gt;

Other notable churches designed by D. A. Bohlen include the [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]]-style Roberts Park Methodist Church (1876) at Delaware and Vermont Streets; Emmanuel Church (1883), later renamed Lockerbie Square United Methodist Church, at East and New York Streets; and Saint Paul's Evangelical Lutheran Church (1883) at McCarty and New Jersey Streets.&lt;ref name=Cord/&gt;&lt;ref name=ArtArch/&gt;&lt;ref name=StPauls&gt;{{cite book | title =St. Paul's Evangelical Lutheran Church: Eightieth Anniversary | publisher =Hollenbeck Press | series = | volume = | edition = | year =1922 | location =Indianapolis, IN | pages =12–13 | url = | isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oscar Bohlen designed Assumption Catholic Church (1894). Built in West Indianapolis, a city suburb at that time, it is the oldest frame Catholic church in the city in continuous use. Also known as Saint Mary of the Assumption Roman Catholic Church, it was later named Saint Athanasius the Great Byzantine-Ruthenian Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Sister Francis Assisi Kennedy | title=The Archdiocese of Indianapolis, 1834&amp;ndash;2009: Like a Mustard Seed Growing |year=2009 |publisher=Editions du Signe |location=Strasbourg, France| page=167| isbn=978-2-7468-1911-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oscar also designed the parish's original school building (1895).&lt;ref&gt;Divita, pp. 5, 23, and 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous commercial and several notable civic structures were designed in Indianapolis during Oscar Bohlen's tenure at the firm. D. A. and Oscar Bohlen collaborated on the [[Indianapolis City Market]] (1886),&lt;ref name=ICMkt/&gt; still in operation, and Tomlinson Hall (1886), adjacent to the City Market at the corner of Delaware and Market Streets. Tomlinson Hall was destroyed by fire in 1958. Oscar Bohlen's most notable commercial structure was the Majestic Building (1896), a commission from the Indiana Gas Company, at 47 South Pennsylvania Street. The ten-story, steel-skeleton building became the city's first skyscraper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor=Mary Ellen Gadski | title =Indianapolis Architecture: Transformations Since 1975 | publisher =Indiana Architectural Foundation | series = | volume = | edition = | year =1993 | location =Indianapolis | page =64 | url =  | isbn =9780963630018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oscar also designed the Indiana National Bank building (1897), a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] structure at Three Virginia Avenue. Demolished in 1971, it was among the first fireproof building in Indiana. Oscar's son, August, designed a six-floor addition to the bank's adjacent building.&lt;ref name=Walton44/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Linda Weintraut  |author2=Jane R.

August Bohlen designed the Stokely Brothers office building (1912) and the Indianapolis Star-News building (1924); however, August and Robert Bohlen's most notable design was the [[Art Deco]]-style Empire Life and Accident Insurance Company building (1950). It later became known as the [[Lilly Endowment]] building. The firm's other major projects in Indianapolis during the early twentieth century included the Oscar Bohlen-designed [[Murat Shrine|Murat Temple]] (1910) at Massachusetts Avenue and New Jersey and Michigan Streets. He also designed an addition to [[Indianapolis Union Station]] (1903) and the Pennway (1909) and Big Four (1929) buildings.&lt;ref name=HBR/&gt;

The Bohlen firm designed several buildings for Indianapolis's [[St. Vincent Indianapolis Hospital|Saint Vincent Hospital]], [[Methodist Hospital of Indianapolis|Methodist Hospital]], and [[St. Francis Hospital &amp; Health Centers|Saint Francis Hospital]], among others. In 1882 D. A. Bohlen remodeled a vacant seminary building on East Vermont Street for the [[Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul]] to house Saint Vincent's Infirmary, predecessor to Indianapolis's Saint Vincent Hospital. Oscar Bohlen designed the hospital's second building (1889) on South and Delaware Streets, and after it was destroyed by fire in 1904, the Bohlen firm designed the third Saint Vincent Hospital (1913) building facing Fall Creek Parkway, between Capitol and Illinois Streets.&lt;ref name=Loftus&gt;{{cite book | author=Marie D’Andrea Loftus | title =St. Vincent Hospital and Health Care Center, Indianapolis, Indiana, 1881–1981 | publisher =Litho Press | series = | volume = | edition = | year =1981 | location =Indianapolis, IN | pages =4, 18, and 37 | url =  | isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Probst and Reichmann, p. 37 and 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Oscar also designed Methodist Hospital (1901) and Saint Francis Hospital (1903).&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vaughan&gt;{{cite journal | author= Charles Vaughan | title = Bohlen &amp; Son Going Strong in 4th Generation | journal =Indianapolis News | volume = | issue = | page =30 | publisher = | location =Indianapolis, IN | date = April 18, 1960 | language = | url =| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s and 1980s the firm's Indianapolis clients included Indianapolis Newspapers, Inc.; Saint Vincent Hospital; Methodist Hospital; and the Indiana National Bank, in addition to the [[Indianapolis Fire Department]], the Beveridge Paper Company, the [[University of Indianapolis]] (formerly Indiana Central University), and the Diamond Chain Company, among others.&lt;ref name=HBR/&gt; Melvin Meyer designed the executive offices for Indianapolis Newspapers, Inc.; the Krannert Pavilion and the Children's Pavilion at Methodist Hospital; the Krannert Library at the University of Indianapolis; and the [[Kiwanis]] International headquarters at Indianapolis.&lt;ref name=Meyer/&gt;

'''BunaB''' was the name of a line of purposely useless [[novelty item|novelty products]], promoted as if they were useful via carefully written [[marketing]] hype. They were created by American radio host [[Al Crowder]] (1904-1981). Beginning in the 1950s BunaBs were purportedly produced by the firm of Orville K. Snav and Associates and distributed from its headquarters in Snav Towers, [[Mason City, Iowa]]. The company's chief product was the Improved No. 7 BunaB, an assembly of two {{convert|1.75|in|cm|adj=on}} insulated wires, red and blue, held together with neatly applied yellow electrical tape at the ends. BunaBs have over time been viewed as examples of primitive [[conceptual art]].&lt;ref name=peterson1&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=John Charles|title=The True-Life Adventures of Captain Wa Wah|year=2009|publisher=Katydid|url=http://www.captainwawah.com/?p=bunab|accessdate=26 October 2012|chapter=25 - The Wizard of Lime Creek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1951 Al Crowder was a music store employee and radio host at KSMN in Mason City.&lt;ref name=collison1&gt;{{cite news|last=Collison|first=Jim|title=Behind the BunaB: Product Research|publisher=Globe-Gazette|date=October 6, 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A cryptic gift of an object resembling a water jug from Crowder's father-in-law to Crowder's son inspired Crowder to write to the manufacturer, the [[Playtex|International Latex Corporation]], to ask what the object was. The response, received from E.C. Jakoswiak, Assistant to the President, stated that the bladder was a component of a World War II inflatable attack boat. Inspired by the apparently useless object and by the response, Crowder created the Improved BunaB #7, the first of the line. The BunaB

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...will meet, or exceed specifications set up by the industry for accuracy, durability and simplicity of operation. No moving parts insures constant stability... With a minimum of practice, results equaling the conventional instrument may be expected."&lt;ref name=peterson1/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The instructions continued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"After prolonged use the BunaB may indicate a variation of one or two percent when checked against a new BunaB. In that case, the old one should be discarded immediately. Satisfaction in positive results will readily offset the slight cost of replacement."&lt;ref name=peterson1/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Those who ordered the BunaB #7 received, in addition to their device, a registration card that, when returned to Snav Towers, automatically made the recipient an "Assistant to the President." Shortly afterwards a personal letter from Crowder would arrive, discussing in lengthy detail the difficulties that attended Snav's business empire and personal life. Crowder's use of the Snav name dated to a time in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], when he would send a daily (but empty) envelope to a local radio station that was soliciting letters from listeners.&lt;ref name=peterson1/&gt;

Crowder was "Chief Assistant to the President" from 1951 to his death in 1981. After he died, his wife Louise carried on as "Dame Minerva P. Snav" and managed the correspondence with the approximately 50,000 Assistants to the President and Key Personnel in the Field from the Hall of Science (an upstairs bedroom, said to cover "approximately 9000 square inches") at Snav Towers (the Crowder residence).&lt;ref name=peterson1/&gt;

==BunaB product line==
Snav produced a number of other BunaB products.

* '''BunaB #2''', also known as '''Zudirk'''. A board game with unplayable rules. In fact, the rules clearly stated that they were unplayable.
* '''BunaB #3''', the "Man's Between Shave Lotion," an apparently empty plastic bottle, the contents to be reconstituted by the addition of water.
* '''BunaB #4''', a small dial with an adhesive pad that, when attached to a surface, could be moved between "OFF" and "ON."
* '''BunaB #5''', a record to be played while watching television. It was entirely blank. Side 1 was noted to be particularly suitable for "drama, mystery, adventure and afternoon serials" while Side 2 was best for "panel shows, interviews, news, weather and sports." The record could be played at all [[Gramophone record|standard speeds]], including [[LP record|33-1/3]], 45, 78 and the [[Edison Disc Record|Edison 80 rpm]] standards with satisfactory results.&lt;ref name=playboy1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Asbell|first=Bernard|title=The Little World of Orville K. Snav|journal=Playboy|date=April 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''BunaB #6''', remarkably similar to the Improved #7 BunaB to the extent of being identical.
* '''BunaB #7''', the company's signature product. About 40,000 BunaB #7s were produced.&lt;ref name=dickson1&gt;{{cite book|last=Dickson|first=Paul|title=Family Words: The Dictionary for People Who Don't Know a Frone from a Brinkle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RRLWjLs3lCgC&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;ots=gUebjT5y-C&amp;dq=bunab%20crowder&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q=bunab%20crowder&amp;f=false|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=978-0934333375|pages=24-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BunaB #7 is noted for its durability, ease of use and resistance to obsolescence.

While not a part of the BunaB line, Snav also produced the Post Meridian Morning (PMM) Shield. This black half-disc could be attached to the left side of a clock dial to obscure the morning hours.&lt;ref name=dickson1/&gt; Snav also marketed the "Exigency Conversion Apparatus" (ECA), a plastic bag containing labels "MEN" and "WOMEN," allowing instant conversion of any room to a restroom. The C-K Key, made of Snav-Metal, opened all models of [[chastity belt]].&lt;ref name=peterson1/&gt; Delinquent accounts were referred to a Snav subsidiary, the Octopus Collection Agency.&lt;ref name=playboy1/&gt;

==Media coverage==
Crowder appeared four times on ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]'' to discuss the BunaB #7, introducing the BunaB #5 on the show in the fall of 1957. In April 1958 Crowder was the subject of a ''[[Playboy]]'' profile entitled ''"The Little World of Orville K. Snav."''&lt;ref name=playboy1/&gt; In the ''[[Bullwinkle J. Moose|Bullwinkle]]'' cartoon series, Bullwinkle read poetry from a music stand holding the "BunaB Anthem", first aired in September 1961. [[Jay Ward]], the producer of ''Bullwinkle'', awarded Snav a "Certificate of Exceptional Adequacy".&lt;ref name=peterson1/&gt;&lt;ref name=dickson1/&gt;&lt;ref name=collison2&gt;{{cite news|last=Collison|first=Jim|title=Politics, Pests stall Snav Crusade|newspaper=Globe-Gazette|date=October 6, 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; "

==Notable BunaB owners==
Television host [[Dave Garroway]] gave away BunaB #7s to test recipients' sense of humor. The BunaB he gave to [[Jimmy Carter]] was returned. [[H.R. Haldeman]] bought one for [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref&gt;Dickson, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; There is no record of whether Nixon found it funny. All of the [[Mercury Seven|Mercury 7]] astronauts had BunaBs.&lt;ref name=dickson1/&gt; Other "Assistants to the President" included [[Groucho Marx]], [[Hugh Downs]], [[Jerry Lewis]], [[Helen Hayes]], [[Barry Goldwater]] (who termed it "Absolutely irreplaceable. Use it constantly"),&lt;ref name=playboy1/&gt; [[Cary Grant]], [[Myrna Loy]] ("Absolutely indespensible!")&lt;ref name=playboy1/&gt; and [[Hugh Hefner]].&lt;ref name=peterson1/&gt;

==As conceptual art==
The BunaB line of products has been cited as an early form of [[conceptual art]], as described in the 2001 ''Dictionary of the Avant-Gardes''. BunaBs #3 and #5 are in particular cited as examples of ''praecisio'',&lt;ref name=huth1&gt;{{cite book|author=Huth, Geof|title=A Dictionary of the Avant-Gardes|year=2001|isbn=978-0415937641|pages=25-27|edition=2nd|authorlink=Al Crowder|editor=Kostelanetz, Ric|accessdate=26 October 2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NZX85xdr6boC&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;ots=VeVdaeBKf8&amp;dq=snav%20bunab&amp;pg=PA144#v=onepage&amp;q=snav%20bunab&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined as the act of making a point through silence.&lt;ref name=kibbins1&gt;{{cite book|last=Kibbins|first=Gary|title=Grammar and Not-Grammar|publisher=YYZ Artists|page=187|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Caryl Churchill''' (born 3 September 1938, [[London]]) is a British playwright known for dramatising the abuses of power, for her use of non-[[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] techniques, and for her exploration of sexual politics and [[feminist]] themes.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/117251/Caryl-Churchill Caryl Churchill profile], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''; accessed 26 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
{{unsourced|section|date=January 2018}}
Her early work developed [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s [[Modernism|modernist]] dramatic and theatrical techniques of [[Epic theatre]] to explore issues of [[gender]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]. From ''[[A Mouthful of Birds]]'' (1986) onwards, she began to [[Experimental theatre|experiment]] with forms of [[Dance Theatre|dance-theatre]], incorporating techniques developed from the [[Performance art|performance]] tradition initiated by [[Antonin Artaud]] with his '[[Theatre of Cruelty]]'. This move away from a clear ''[[Fabel]]'' dramaturgy towards increasingly fragmented and [[Surrealism|surrealistic]] narratives characterises her work as [[Postmodern theater|postmodernist]].

==Background==
Churchill was born in London, England, the daughter of Jan Brown, a fashion model, and Robert Churchill, a political cartoonist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/35/Caryl-Churchill.html|title=Caryl Churchill Biography (1938-)|website=Filmreference.com|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War II]], her family emigrated to [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada; Churchill was ten years old. In Montreal, she attended [[Trafalgar School for Girls]].

She returned to England to attend university, and in 1960 she graduated from [[Lady Margaret Hall]], a women's college at [[Oxford University]], with a B.A. degree in [[English Literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/Alumni/Prominent-alumni.aspx | title=LMH, Oxford – Prominent Alumni|website=Lmh.ox.ac.uk|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also began her writing career there. Her four earliest plays, ''Downstairs'' (produced 1958),''You've No Need to be Frightened'', ''Having a Wonderful Time'' (1960), and  ''Easy Death'' (produced 1962) were performed at Oxford by student theatre ensembles.&lt;ref name="doollee.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doollee.com/PlaywrightsC/churchill-caryl.html|title=The playwrights database of modern plays|website=Doollee.com|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961 she married David Harter, a barrister.&lt;ref name="The New York Times - 5 December 2004 - The Mysteries of Caryl Churchill"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/05/theater/newsandfeatures/the-mysteries-of-caryl-churchill.html|title=The Mysteries of Caryl Churchill|last=[[Sarah Lyall]]|date=December 5, 2004|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have three sons and live in [[Islington]], North London.

==Career==
It was while raising a family in the 1960s and '70s that Churchill began to write short radio dramas for [[BBC]] radio. These included ''The Ants'' (1962), ''Not, Not, Not, Not Enough Oxygen'' (1971), and ''Schreber's Nervous Illness'' (1972). She also wrote television plays for the BBC, including ''The After Dinner Joke'' (1978) and ''Crimes'' (1982). These, as well as some of her [[radio plays]], have been adapted for the stage.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

===Themes and plays===
{{moresources|section|date=January 2018}}
In 1972, she wrote ''[[Owners (Play)|Owners]]'', a two-act, 14-scene play about obsession with power. It was her first stage play and "her first major theatrical endeavour"; it was produced in London the same year.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt; Churchill's socialist views are expressed in the play, a critique of the values that most capitalists take for granted: being aggressive, getting ahead, doing well.{{says who|date=May 2017}}

She served as resident dramatist at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] from 1974 to 1975, and later began collaboration with theatre companies such as [[Joint Stock Theatre Company]] and [[Monstrous Regiment Theatre Company|Monstrous Regiment]] (a feminist theatre collective). Both used an extended workshop period in their development of new plays. Churchill continues to use an [[improvisation]]al workshop period in developing a number of her plays. During this period, she also wrote ''Objections to Sex and Violence'' (1974).&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

Her first play to receive wide notice was ''[[Cloud Nine (play)|Cloud Nine]]'' (1979), "a farce about sexual politics", set partly in a British overseas colony during the [[Victorian era]]. It explores the effects of the [[colonialist]]/[[imperialist]] mindset on intimate personal relationships, and uses cross-gender casting for comic and instructive effect. The play became successful in Britain and in the United States, winning an [[Obie Award]] in 1982 for best play of the year in New York.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

Churchill gradually abandoned more conventions of [[Realism (theatre)|realism]], and her loyalty to feminist themes and ideas became a guiding principle in her work. She won an [[Obie Award]] for best play with ''[[Top Girls]]'' (1982), "which deals with women's losing their humanity in order to attain power in a male-dominated environment."&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt; It features an all-female cast, and focuses on Marlene, who has relinquished a home and family to achieve success in the world of business. Half the action takes place at a celebratory dinner where Marlene mixes with historical, iconic and fictional women who have achieved great stature in a "man's world", but always at great cost. The other half of the play, set a year in the past, focuses on Marlene's family, where the true cost of her "successful" life becomes poignantly and frighteningly apparent.

''Softcops'' (first produced by the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] in 1984), is a "surreal play set in 19th-century France about government attempts to depoliticize illegal acts."&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

''[[Serious Money]]'' (1987), "a comedy about excesses in the financial world",&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt; is a verse play, chiefly written in rhyming couplets. It takes a [[satire|satirical]] look at the vagaries of the [[stock market]] and its Thatcherite denizens. The play was highly acclaimed, perhaps in part because it played immediately after the [[stock market crash]] of 1987.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt; ''[[Icecream]]'' ([[Royal Court Theatre]] 1989) explores Anglo-American stereotypes.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

In ''[[The Skriker]]'' (1994), Churchill's play, a visionary exploration of global ecology made through gender games, storytelling, distorted language and evocations of modern urban life, follows an ancient and shape-shifting death portent (''The Skriker'') in her search for love, revenge and human understanding.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

"The prolific Churchill continued to push boundaries into the late 1990s. In 1997 she collaborated with the composer Orlando Gough to create 'Hotel,' a choreographed opera or sung ballet set in a hotel room. Also that year her surrealistic short play 'This Is a Chair' was produced."&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

Her 2002 play, ''[[A Number]]'', addresses the subject of [[human cloning]] and questions of identity. Her adapted screenplay of ''[[A Number]]'' was shown on BBC TV in September 2008. Her recent play, ''Drunk Enough To Say I Love You'' (2006), takes a critical look at what she sees as Britain's submission to the United States in foreign policy.

In 2010, Churchill was commissioned to write the [[libretto]] for a new short opera by [[Orlando Gough]], as part of the [[Royal Opera House]]'s ROH2 OperaShots initiative.  The resulting work, ''A ring a lamp a thing'', played for five performances in the Linbury Studio Theatre at the Royal Opera House.&lt;ref&gt;O'Mahony, John. [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jun/10/ingerland-operashots-gough-pook-sawhney "Operas about wags? Why not, says the Royal Opera House"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 10 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her ''[[Love and Information]]'', opened at the Royal Court Theatre in September 2012, directed by [[James Macdonald (director)|James Macdonald]]. It gained great critical and popular acclaim.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The play, featuring 100 characters and performed by a cast of 15, is structured as a series of more than 50 fragmented scenes, some no longer than 25 seconds, all of which are apparently unrelated but which accumulate into a startling mosaic, a portrayal of modern consciousness and the need for human intimacy, love and connection. The play will have its regional premiere at Sheffield Theatres in June 2018, directed by Caroline Steinbeis.

===Translations===
Churchill has published a translation of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca's]] ''[[Thyestes]]'' and her version of [[August Strindberg]]'s ''[[A Dream Play]]''. The latter was premiered at the National Theatre in 2005.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Retrospective===
The [[Royal Court Theatre]] held a 70th Birthday retrospective of her work by presenting readings of many of her most famous plays directed by notable playwrights, including [[Martin Crimp]] and [[Mark Ravenhill]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalcourttheatre.com/whatson01.asp?play=528] {{dead link|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Of course it's possible to trace recurring themes in Churchill's work – alienation between parent and child, the possibility and failure of revolution. But it is the variety of her work that is most striking. As Von Mayenburg says: "With each play, she discovers new genres and forms. She then discards them and moves on, opening up possibilities for other playwrights to explore. I think many people writing today don't even realise they've been influenced by her. She's changed the language of theatre. And very few playwrights do that."&lt;ref name="ravenhill"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/sep/03/carylchurchill.theatre|title='She made us raise our game'|author=[[Mark Ravenhill]]|date=3 September 2008|work=The Guardian|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Interest in Palestine===
{{Main article|Seven Jewish Children}}
Churchill is a patron of the [[Palestine Solidarity Campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palestinecampaign.org/Index5b.asp?m_id=1&amp;l1_id=2&amp;l2_id=12|title=Patrons|work=Palestine Solidarity Campaign|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302091920/http://www.palestinecampaign.org/Index5b.asp?m_id=1&amp;l1_id=2&amp;l2_id=12|archivedate=2 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In January 2009, she wrote a ten-minute play that explores a history of Israel, ending with the [[2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict|2008 Israeli attack on Gaza]]. It was performed for free at the [[Royal Court Theatre]], with a collection taken to donate to [[Medical Aid for Palestinians]].&lt;ref name="seven"/&gt;

''[[The Sunday Times]]'' condemned its "ludicrous and utterly predictable lack of even-handedness"; but for ''[[The Times]]'', "there are no heroes or villains, for all that Churchill decries what is happening in Gaza".&lt;ref name="seven"/&gt; Writers such as Jeffrey Goldberg of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' and Melanie Phillips in her ''[[The Spectator|Spectator]]'' blog criticised the play as anti-Semitic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jeffreygoldberg.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/03/ari_roth.php#more|title=Caryl Churchill: Gaza&amp;apos;s Shakespeare, or Fetid Jew-Baiter?|first=Jeffrey|last=Goldberg|website=Jeffreygoldberg.theatlantic.com|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/melaniephillips/3334851/the-royal-courts-mystery-play.thtml# |title=Archived copy |access-date=15 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414230800/http://www.spectator.co.uk/melaniephillips/3334851/the-royal-courts-mystery-play.thtml# |archive-date=14 April 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as did John Nathan.&lt;ref name=Nathan/&gt; He noted that
Churchill has said that ''[[Seven Jewish Children]]'' is "not just a theatre event but a political event."&lt;ref name=Nathan&gt;{{cite news|title=Review: Seven Jewish Children|publisher=''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]''|first= John|last=Nathan|date=12 February 2009 |url=http://www.thejc.com/articles/review-seven-jewish-children}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that a play representing views of one community and critical of that community needed to be written by a member of that community.&lt;ref name=Nathan/&gt; The Royal Court denied the accusation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/feb/18/caryl-churchill-gaza-play|work=The Guardian|location=London, UK|title=Churchill's Gaza play accused of antisemitism|first=Charlotte|last=Higgins|date=18 February 2009|accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/letters/letters-jacobson-on-gaza-1628191.html|work=The Independent|location=London|title=Letters: Jacobson on Gaza|date=21 February 2009|accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Churchill published the play, ''[[Seven Jewish Children]] – a play about Gaza'', online, for free download and use. Churchill said: "Anyone can perform it without acquiring the rights, as long as they do a collection for people in Gaza at the end of it".&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/jan/24/theatre-gaza-caryl-churchill-royal-court-seven-jewish-children Royal Court acts fast with Gaza crisis play], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 24 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/video/2009/apr/25/seven-jewish-children-caryl-churchill|title=Video: Seven Jewish Children|first1=Caryl|last1=Churchill|first2=Jennie|last2=Stoller|first3=Elliot|last3=Smith|date=24 April 2009|accessdate=27 January 2018|website=Theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2289">The '''Embroiderers' Guild of America''', headquartered in [[Louisville, Kentucky]],&lt;ref&gt;"The light is better in Louisville" was the winning pitch in 1989, when the location for a new national headquarters, formerly in New York, was being decided.&lt;/ref&gt; is an organization dedicated to "fostering the art of [[needlework]] and associated arts." Its members practice any and all forms of needlework, and are dedicated to [[education]] and [[community outreach]]. EGA has chapters throughout the [[United States]]. Chapters are organized into regions. Events are organized at all levels of the organization.

Membership in EGA is open to anyone interested in embroidery from the beginner to the professional. Members work within local chapters or a member-at-large network to improve their skills and knowledge. Also, the organization and individual members are involved with museums for education and preservation purposes. EGA offers individual and group correspondence courses, teacher and judge certification programs as well as master craftsman programs.

The Guild's definition of embroidery is intentionally unconfining: anything made "using a needle with an eye in it". In 2006 The national guild has 9,000 members organized in 295 local chapters in 13 regions.

The Guild was established in [[New York City|New York]] in 1958 as a branch of The [[Embroiderers' Guild (United Kingdom)|Embroiderers' Guild of London]] (established in 1906) but withdrew in 1970.

The organization's head office in Louisville includes a gallery for displays from its permanent collection and changing exhibits of embroidery.

An '''experience model''' is a description of a typical user’s [[perception]] or [[understanding]] of how a system works. 

==Models==
Experience models are visually represented by abstract [[diagram]]s or [[metaphor]]s drawn from familiar objects, behaviors or systems. [[User interface]]s implement a variety of experience models to enable users to quickly grasp what is happening in the system, where the user is, and what the user can do next.

A [[software]] experience model may represent the relationship of one [[Software application|application]] to another, an application in relationship to various [[navigation]] mechanisms and other system or application components.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2562">'''Fronte Nuovo delle Arti''' was an Italian artistic movement active in [[Venice]], [[Rome]] and [[Milan]] in the years following [[Second World War|WWII]] (1946 to 1950). It is considered to be part of the post-cubism movement.

"Fronte Nuovo delle Arti" was founded in September-October 1946 with the name ''Nuova Secessione Artistica Italiana'' (New Italian Artistic Secession). The first manifesto was published on 1 October 1946 in [[Venice]]. It was written by Giuseppe Marchiori and signed by [[Emilio Vedova]], [[Renato Birolli]], [[Ennio Morlotti]], [[Armando Pizzinato]], Giuseppe Santomaso, Alberto Viani, [[Bruno Cassinari]], [[Renato Guttuso]], Leoncillo Leonardi and [[Carlo Levi]]. Later on, Guttuso proposed to change the name of the movement to ''Fronte Nuovo delle Arti''. 

The reasoning for this group of artists and critics to develop the ideas leading to the formation of the ''Fronte'' was to go beyond the positions of the movement Novecento italiano, who were deemed as outdated in light of the most recent artistic developments in Europe. 

"Fronte Nuovo delle Arti'' had a number of exhibitions in Italy but it disbanded after an intense internal debate about [[Abstract art|abstraction]] and [[Realism (arts)|realism]]. Pizzinato and Guttuso rejected [[abstractionism]] and announced their decision to quit. The movement was officially dissolved on 3 September 1950 in Venice.

'''Germaine Monteil''' was a New York-based French fashion designer and [[cosmetician]] who founded the cosmetics and [[perfume]] company sharing her name.

==Fashion==
Born in France in 1898, Monteil moved to the United States in the early 1930s. A high-end dressmaker as well as a [[cosmetician]], she first established herself as a fashion designer.&lt;ref name=asiv&gt;{{cite book| last = Hall| first = Daniel Delis| title = As Seen In Vogue: A Century of American Fashion in Advertising| publisher=Texas Tech University Press| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MvilOZhaRkAC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| year = 2007| pages =67| ISBN = 0-89672-616-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made classic dresses with flaring circular or pleated skirts and slim silhouettes, and was renowned for her use of prints which appealed to the American market.&lt;ref name=asiv/&gt; In 1938, Monteil won a [[Neiman Marcus Fashion Award]] in recognition of her influence upon the fashion industry. This was the first year in which the awards were presented. She died in 1987.

==Cosmetics &amp; perfumes==
In 1936, Monteil founded with her husband, Guy Bjorkman, ''Germaine Monteil Cosmetiques Corp.'' as a sideline to her fashion business, offering skin treatments and creams.&lt;ref name=asiv/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sagarin, Edward; {{cite book| last = Balsam| first = M.S| title = Cosmetics, science and technology (2nd edition)| publisher=Wiley-Interscience| year = 1972| pages =217| ISBN = 0-471-04649-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first perfume, ''Laughter'' (later renamed ''Rigolade''), came out in 1941.&lt;ref name=nph&gt;Young, Duane A. &amp; {{cite book| last = Jones-North| first = Jacqueline Y.| title = Commercial Perfume Bottles (2nd edition)| publisher=Schiffer Pub.| year = 1987| pages =| ISBN = 0-88740-108-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing success of this sideline led to Monteil abandoning fashion design in the late 1940s to focus on perfume and cosmetics.&lt;ref name=asiv/&gt; The company was acquired by cosmetics giant Revlon in 1987 from fashion house Yves Saint Laurent. Revlon then sold the brand on to the German company Wilde Cosmetics GmbH in 2006.

Monteil fragrances include:

'''''Glory''''' is a 1989 American [[war film]] directed by [[Edward Zwick]], starring [[Matthew Broderick]], [[Denzel Washington]], [[Cary Elwes]] and [[Morgan Freeman]]. The screenplay by [[Kevin Jarre]] was based on the books ''Lay This Laurel'' by Lincoln Kirstein and ''[[One Gallant Rush]]'' by [[Peter Burchard]], and the personal letters of Colonel [[Robert Gould Shaw]].  The end credits are superimposed on photos of the monument to the [[54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry]] on [[Boston Common]].

The film is about one of the first military units of the [[Union Army]], during the [[American Civil War]], to consist entirely of African-American men (except for its officers), as told from the point of view of Colonel Shaw, its white commanding officer. The regiment is known especially for its heroic actions at [[Fort Wagner]].

''Glory'' was nominated for five [[Academy Awards]] and won three, including one for Denzel Washington for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Private Silas Tripp. It won many other awards from, among others, the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]], the [[Golden Globe Award]]s, the Kansas City Film Critics Circle, the [[Political Film Society]], and the [[NAACP Image Awards]].

The film was co-produced by [[TriStar Pictures]] and [[Freddie Fields|Freddie Fields Productions]], and distributed by Tri-Star Pictures in the United States. It premiered in limited release in the United States on December 14, 1989, and in wide release on February 16, 1990, making $26.8 million on an $18 million budget. The soundtrack, composed by [[James Horner]] and performed in part by [[Boys Choir of Harlem]], was released on January 23, 1990. The home video was distributed by [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]]. On June 2, 2009, a widescreen [[Blu-ray]] version, featuring the director's commentary and deleted scenes, was released.

==Plot==
During the American Civil War, [[Captain (armed forces)|Captain]] [[Robert Gould Shaw|Robert Shaw]], injured at [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]], is sent home to Boston on [[medical leave]]. Shaw accepts a promotion to [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] commanding the [[54th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry]], one of the first all-black regiments in the Union Army. He asks his friend, Cabot Forbes, to serve as his second in command, with the rank of major. Their first volunteer is another friend, Thomas Searles, a bookish, free [[African American|African-American]]. Other recruits include John Rawlins, Jupiter Sharts, Silas Tripp, and a [[muteness|mute]] teenage drummer boy.

The men learn that, in response to the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] has issued an order that all black soldiers will be returned to slavery. Black soldiers found in a Union uniform will be [[summarily executed|executed]] as well as their white officers. They are offered, but turn down, a chance to take an honorable discharge. They undergo rigorous training with Sergeant-Major Mulcahy, which Shaw realizes is to prepare them for the challenges they will face.

Tripp goes [[AWOL]] and is caught; Shaw orders him flogged in front of the troops. He then learns that Tripp left to find shoes to replace his worn ones because his men are being denied supplies. He confronts the base's racist [[quartermaster]] on their behalf. Shaw also supports them in a pay dispute, as the [[U.S. Government|Federal government]] pays black soldiers $10, not the $13 per month white soldiers earn. When the men begin tearing up their pay stubs in protest of the unequal treatment, Shaw tears up his own pay stub in support of their actions. In recognition of his leadership, Shaw promotes Rawlins to the rank of Sergeant-Major.

Once the 54th completes its training, they are transferred under the command of General [[Charles Garrison Harker|Charles Harker]]. On the way to South Carolina they are ordered by Colonel [[James Montgomery (colonel)|James Montgomery]] to sack and burn [[Darien, Georgia]]. Shaw initially refuses to [[Superior orders|obey an unlawful order]], but agrees under threat of having his troops taken away. He continues to lobby his superiors to allow his men to join the fight, as their duties to date have involved mostly manual labor, for which they are mocked. Shaw finally gets the 54th into combat after he confronts Harker and threatens to report the illegal activities he has discovered. In their first battle at [[Battle of Grimball's Landing|James Island, South Carolina]], the 54th successfully defeats a Confederate attack that had routed other units. During the battle, Searles is wounded but saves Tripp. Shaw offers Tripp the honor of bearing the regimental flag in battle. He declines, not believing the war will result in a better life for slaves.

General George Strong informs Shaw of [[Second Battle of Fort Wagner|a major campaign]] to secure a foothold at [[Charleston Harbor]]. This involves assaulting [[Morris Island]] and capturing [[Fort Wagner]], whose only landward approach is a strip of open beach; a charge is certain to result in heavy casualties. Shaw volunteers the 54th to lead the attack. The night before the battle, the black soldiers conduct a religious service. Several make emotional speeches to inspire others. On their way to the battlefield, the 54th is cheered by the same Union troops who had scorned them earlier.

The 54th leads the charge on the fort, suffering serious losses. As night falls, the regiment is pinned down against the walls of the fort. Attempting to encourage his men, Shaw is killed. Tripp lifts the flag, rallying the soldiers to continue, but he too is soon shot dead. Forbes takes charge, and the soldiers break through the fort's defenses. On the brink of victory, Forbes, Rawlins, Searles, Sharts, and the two Color Sergeants are fired upon by Confederate artillery. The morning after the battle, the beach is littered with bodies of Union soldiers; the Confederate flag is raised over the fort. The dead Union soldiers are buried in a mass grave, with Shaw and Tripp's bodies next to each other.

Closing text reveals Fort Wagner never fell to the Union Army. However, the courage demonstrated by the 54th resulted in the Union accepting thousands of black men for combat, and President [[Abraham Lincoln]] credited them with helping to turn the tide of the war.

==Production==
[[File:St_GaudensShaw_Mem.jpg|thumb|Memorial at Boston Common by [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]]]]
Kevin Jarre's inspiration for writing the film came from viewing [[Robert Gould Shaw Memorial|the monument to Colonel Shaw and the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry]] in [[Boston Common]].&lt;ref name="ebert" /&gt;  The [[54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment|54th]] was the first formal unit of the [[U.S. Army]] to be made up entirely of African-American enlisted men; all of the officers were white men.  His screenplay was based on two books, Lincoln Kirstein's ''Lay This Laurel'' (1973) and [[Peter Burchard]]'s ''[[One Gallant Rush]]'' (1965), and the personal letters of [[Robert Gould Shaw]].&lt;ref name="Canby"&gt;Canby, Vincent (December 14, 1989). [https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=950DE4D8113FF937A25751C1A96F948260 Glory (1989)]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. Retrieved 2010-11-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Exterior filming took place primarily in Massachusetts and Georgia. Opening passages, meant to portray the Battle of Antietam, show volunteer military [[Historical reenactment|reenactors]] filmed at a major engagement at the [[Gettysburg Battlefield Historic District|Gettysburg]] battlefield. Zwick did not want to turn ''Glory'' "into a black story with a more commercially convenient white hero".&lt;ref name=TCM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=194041&amp;rss=mrqe |title=Glory (1989) |publisher=Turner Classic Movies |accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actor Morgan Freeman noted: "We didn't want this film to fall under that shadow. This is a picture about the 54th Regiment, not Colonel Shaw, but at the same time the two are inseparable."&lt;ref name=TCM /&gt; Zwick hired the writer [[Shelby Foote]] as a technical adviser; he later became widely known for his contributions to [[Ken Burns]]' PBS nine-episode documentary, ''[[The Civil War (TV series)|The Civil War]]'' (1990).&lt;ref name=TCM /&gt;

The film contains numerous inaccuracies. The movie implies that most of the soldiers in the regiment were former slaves, when in fact a majority had been born free in the North. The regiment was not formed until early 1863, so they were not in camp for Christmas of 1862, and on the day the recruits arrived at Readville, they were given uniforms and new boots so soldiers were not reduced to marching barefoot in cold mud, as the film depicts. While the film shows Shaw volunteering his unit immediately after hearing General Strong describe Fort Wagner's defenses, the regimental commanders had conferred among themselves before going back to Strong and telling him that the 54th was to make the charge. Another inaccuracy is in showing the 54th attacking the fort from north to south with the ocean on their left.  The actual attack occurred from the opposite direction, with the ocean on the right parallel to the regiment. Despite the film's closing statement that Wagner was never taken by U.S. forces, it fell to Union hands in September 1863 after further shelling from the U.S. Navy.

''Glory'' was the first major motion picture to tell the story of black U.S. soldiers fighting for their freedom from slavery during the Civil War.  The 1965 [[James Stewart]] film ''[[Shenandoah (film)|Shenandoah]]'' also depicted black soldiers fighting for the Union, but the script suggested the Union army at that time was integrated.

A nonfiction study of the regiment first appeared in 1965 and was republished in paperback in January 1990 by [[St. Martin's Press]] under the title ''One Gallant Rush: Robert Gould Shaw and His Brave Black Regiment''.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Film critic [[Vincent Canby]]'s review in ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated, "[Broderick] gives his most mature and controlled performance to date....[Washington is] an actor clearly on his way to a major screen career...The movie unfolds in a succession of often brilliantly realized vignettes tracing the 54th's organization, training and first experiences below the [[Mason-Dixon line]]. The characters' idiosyncrasies emerge."&lt;ref name="Canby" /&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' called it "a strong and valuable film no matter whose eyes it is seen through".&lt;ref name="ebert" /&gt; He believed the production design credited to Norman Garwood and the cinematography of Freddie Francis paid "enormous attention to period detail".&lt;ref name="ebert" /&gt;

| style="text-align: left;" |Watching ''"Glory,"'' I had one reccuring [''sic''] problem. I didn't understand why it had to be told so often from the point of view of the 54th's white commanding officer. Why did we see the black troops through his eyes — instead of seeing him through theirs? To put it another way, why does the top billing in this movie go to a white actor?

The film was not without its detractors. [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' was not impressed at all with the overall acting, calling Broderick "catastrophically miscast as Shaw".&lt;ref&gt;Travers, Peter (December 1989). Glory (1989). ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. Retrieved 2010-11-07.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, [[Richard Schickel]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' described the picture by saying, "the movie's often awesome imagery and a bravely soaring choral score by James Horner that transfigure the reality, granting it the status of necessary myth".&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, Richard (December 5, 1989).

Retrieved 2010-11-07.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Desson Howe]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', pointed out some flaws that included mentioning Broderick as "an amiable non-presence, creating unintentionally the notion that the 54th earned their stripes despite wimpy leadership".&lt;ref name="howe"&gt;Desson, Howe (January 12, 1990).

[[James Berardinelli]] writing for ''[[ReelViews]]'', called the film "without question, one of the best movies ever made about the American Civil War," and noted that it "has important things to say, yet it does so without becoming pedantic".&lt;ref name="reelview"&gt;Berardinelli, James (December 1989). [http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/g/glory.html Glory]. ''[[ReelViews]]''. Retrieved 2010-11-07.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rating the film with four stars, critic [[Leonard Maltin]] wrote that it was "grand, moving, breathtakingly filmed (by veteran cinematographer Freddie Francis) and faultlessly performed" and called it "one of the finest historical dramas ever made".&lt;ref&gt;Maltin, Leonard (August 5, 2008). ''Leonard Maltin's 2009 Movie Guide''. Signet. p. 528. {{ISBN|978-0-452-28978-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the film a ''thumbs up'' review, saying, "like ''[[Driving Miss Daisy]]'', this is another admirable film that turns out to be surprisingly entertaining". He thought the film took on "some true social significance" and felt the actors portrayed the characters as "more than simply black men". He explained: "They're so different, that they become not merely standard Hollywood blacks, but true individuals."&lt;ref&gt;Siskel, Gene (December 1989).

American Civil War historian [[James M.

The '''Gruber Collection''' is a collection of books and manuscripts housed at the [[Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago]] in [[Chicago]], Illinois. The collection contain more than 300 books from the 15th to 18th centuries and 14 manuscripts of Greek New Testament (minuscules and lectionaries). Special value have works of [[Martin Luther|Luther]], copies of his letters, original letters written by [[Philipp Melanchthon]], the [[Novum Instrumentum omne|Greek New Testament]] of Erasmus,&lt;ref&gt;[http://collections.lstc.edu/gruber/ref_docs/erasmus.php]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101090802/http://collections.lstc.edu/gruber/ref_docs/erasmus.php |date=January 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other documents of [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] era.&lt;ref name=Gruber&gt;[http://collections.lstc.edu/gruber/about.php]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229224117/http://collections.lstc.edu/gruber/about.php |date=December 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
All manuscripts and majority of books were collected by [[L. Franklin Gruber]] (1870–1941), the former president of the [[Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago]] in [[Maywood, Illinois]].&lt;ref name = Gruber/&gt; 
He purchased them in Europe and brought to Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce M. Metzger]], [[Bart D. Ehrman]], "The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption and Restoration", ''[[Oxford University Press]]'' (New York - Oxford, 2005), p. 90-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hastings School of Art''' was an [[art school]] in [[Hastings]], England, located at the Brassey Institute on the top two floors of the library building at Claremont.

==Background and history==
This applies to Hastings College of Art in Hastings Nebraska&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hastings.edu/about-hastings-college/facts-about-hastings/our-history&lt;/ref&gt;
The Hastings School of Art was established in 1882 as a private college, coeducational, and focused on the liberal arts. 

In August 1873, the proposal for a Christian college directed towards the liberal arts was presented to the Kearney Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church, having been approved by the community. 

On 13 September 1882, the first class of 44 students with five teachers entered the new college located on the second floor of the old Post Office. It took two years to complete the first building of Hastings Art School called the McCormick Hall.&lt;ref name=HISTORY&gt;{{cite web|title=Full History|url=http://www.hastings.edu/igsbase/igstemplate.cfm/SRC=DB/SRCN=/GnavID=18/SnavID=128|publisher=Hastings College|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school had many Victorian casts for the students to work from including a Vatican reproduction of [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[Madonna and Child]]'' relief, which is still on show at the current art department. The art department was moved to the main college campus in Archery Road, [[St Leonards-on-Sea]] in 1982.

'''''Hitchcock/Truffaut''''' is a 1966 book by [[François Truffaut]] about [[Alfred Hitchcock]], originally released in French as '''''Le Cinéma selon Alfred Hitchcock'''''.&lt;ref name="Truffaut"&gt;{{cite book|work=[[Google Books]]|authorlink=François Truffaut|title=Hitchcock/Truffaut|author=Truffaut, François|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NnE_sPb3XBQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=1983|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First published by [[Éditions Robert Laffont]], it is based on a 1962 exchange between Hitchcock and Truffaut, in which the two directors spent a week in a room at Universal Studios talking about movies. After Hitchcock's death, Truffaut updated the book with a new preface and final chapter on Hitchcock's later films.&lt;ref name="Singer"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://screencrush.com/hitchcock-truffaut-review/|title='Hitchcock/Truffaut' Review: One of the Best Film Books of All Time Is Now a Movie|last=Singer|first=Matt|date=10 September 2015|work=Screen Crush|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hospital at Arles''''' is the subject of two paintings that [[Vincent van Gogh]] made of the hospital in which he stayed in December 1888 and again in January 1889. The hospital is located in [[Arles]] in [[southern France]]. One of the paintings is of the central garden between four buildings titled ''Garden of the Hospital in Arles'' (also known as the ''Courtyard of the Hospital at Arles''); the other painting is of a ward within the hospital titled ''Ward of the Hospital in Arles''. Van Gogh also painted a ''Portrait of Dr. Félix Rey'' his physician while in the hospital.

==Arles==

[[Arles]] is located in a region called [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]], department of [[Bouches-du-Rhône]] in [[southern France]].  It is about {{convert|32|km}} southeast of Nîmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arles-guide.com/arles_guide/where_is_arles_in_france |title=Where is Arles? |year=2011 |work=Arles Guide |publisher=Arles-guide.com |accessdate=2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===

Arles became a successful port for trade in France during the Roman period.  Many immigrants from [[North Africa]] came to Arles in the 17th and 18th centuries; their influence is reflected in many of the houses of the town that were built during that period.&lt;ref name=ArlesHistory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arles-guide.com/arles_guide/arles_history |title=Arles History |year=2011 |work=Arles Guide |publisher=Arles-guide.com |accessdate=2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arles remained economically important for many years as a major port on the Rhône. The arrival of the railway in the 19th century eventually took away of much of the river trade, reducing the city's commercial business.  Because Arles maintained Provençal charm it attracted artists, like Van Gogh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.provence-hideaway.com/205.html |title=Arles |year=2011 |work=Provence Hideaways |publisher=Travel Writers Coop |accessdate=2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Van Gogh===

[[File:Vincent van Gogh - The yellow house ('The street').jpg|thumb|''[[Yellow House (painting)|The Yellow House]]'' (1888) [[Van Gogh Museum]], Amsterdam (F464)]]
Van Gogh came to Arles on February 20, 1888 and initially stayed at the lodgings at Restaurant Carrel. Signs of spring were evident in the budding almond trees and of winter by the snow-covered landscape. To Van Gogh the scene seemed like a [[Japanese art|Japanese]] landscape.&lt;ref name=Leeuw353&gt;Van Gogh; Leeuw, 353&lt;/ref&gt;

Arles was quite a different place than anywhere else he had lived.  The climate was sunny, hot and dry and the local inhabitants had more of an appearance and sound of people from Spain. The "vivid colors and strong compositional outlines" of Provence led van Gogh to call the area "the Japan of the South."&lt;ref name=NGAsun&gt;{{cite journal|title=Effects of the Sun in Provence |journal=National Gallery of Art Picturing France (1830-1900) |page=121 (starting 1 of pdf) |publisher=National Gallery of Art |location=Washington, D.C. |url=http://www.nga.gov/education/classroom/france/picfrance_7.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512000557/http://www.nga.gov/education/classroom/france/picfrance_7.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this time he produced more than 200 paintings including ''The Starry Night'' [''[[Starry Night over the Rhone]]''], ''[[The Night Café|Café de Nuit]]'' and ''[[Sunflowers (series of paintings)|The Sunflowers]]''.&lt;ref name=ArlesHistory/&gt;

Van Gogh had few friends in Arles, although through acquaintance with Joseph Roulin, a postman, and Ginoux, the owner of Cafe de la Gare where he next roomed, he made many portraits of the [[The Roulin Family (Van Gogh series)|Roulin family]] and of [[L'Arlésienne (painting)|Madame Ginoux]]. Part of his difficulty in making friends was his inability to master the [[Provençal dialect]], "whole days go by without my speaking a single word to anyone, except to order my meals or coffee." In the beginning of his time in Arles, though, he was so enthused by the setting in  Provence that the lack of connection with others hadn't troubled him.  In October 1888 [[Paul Gauguin]] came to Arles and joined van Gogh in his rented rooms at ''[[Yellow House (painting)|The Yellow House]]''.&lt;ref name=Leeuw385&gt;Van Gogh; Leeuw, 385&lt;/ref&gt; 
Unfortunately many of the places that van Gogh had visited and painted were destroyed during bombing raids in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=ArlesHistory/&gt;

===Events leading up to stay at Arles hospital===

Van Gogh's mental health deteriorated and he became alarmingly eccentric, culminating in an altercation with [[Paul Gauguin]] in December 1888 following which van Gogh cut off part of his own left ear.&lt;ref&gt;Maurer, 192&lt;/ref&gt; He was then hospitalized in Arles twice over a few months. His condition was diagnosed by the hospital as "acute mania with generalised delirium".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concordance, lists, bibliography: Documentation|url=http://vangoghletters.org/vg/documentation.html#id8May1889|work=Vincent van Gogh: The Letters|publisher=''[[Van Gogh Museum]]''|accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Portraits by Vincent van Gogh#Doctor Rey|Dr. Félix Rey]], a young intern at the hospital, also suggested there might be "a kind of epilepsy" involved that he characterised as ''mental'' epilepsy.&lt;ref&gt;Naifeh and Smith (2011), 701 ''ff.'', 729, 749&lt;/ref&gt; Although some, such as [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger|Johanna van Gogh]], [[Paul Signac]] and posthumous speculation by doctors Doiteau &amp; Leroy have said that van Gogh just removed part of his earlobe and maybe a little more,&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, 106&lt;/ref&gt; art historian Rita Wildegans maintains that without exception, all of the witnesses from Arles said that he removed the entire left ear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wildegans.de/vangogh/english/index.html | title=Van Gogh's Ear | author=Wildegans, Dr. R | publisher=Dr. Rita Wildegans | accessdate=2011-04-27 | postscript="''It can be said that with the exception of the sister-in-law [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger]], who had family-related reasons for playing down the injury, not a single witness speaks of a severed earlobe. On the contrary, the mutually independent statements by the principal witness Paul Gauguin, the prostitute who was given the ear, the gendarme who was on duty in the red-light district, the investigating police officer and the local newspaper report, accord with the evidence that the artist's unfortunate "self-mutilation" involves the entire (left) ear. The existing handwritten and clearly worded medical reports by three different physicians, all of whom observed and treated Vincent van Gogh over an extended period of time in Arles as well as in the [[Saint-Paul Asylum, Saint-Rémy (Van Gogh series)|Saint-Paul asylum in Saint-Rémy]] ought to provide ultimate proof of the fact that the artist was missing an entire ear and not just an earlobe.''"}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1889, he returned to the Yellow House where he was living, but spent the following month between hospital and home suffering from hallucinations and delusions that he was being poisoned. In March 1889, the police closed his house after a petition by 30 townspeople, who called him "fou roux" (''the redheaded madman''). Signac visited him in hospital and van Gogh was allowed home in his company. In April 1889, he moved into rooms owned by Dr. Félix Rey, after floods damaged paintings in his own home.&lt;ref&gt;Pickvance (1986). ''Chronology'', 239–242&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tralbaut (1981), 265–273&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, he wrote, "Sometimes moods of indescribable anguish, sometimes moments when the veil of time and fatality of circumstances seemed to be torn apart for an instant." Finally in May 1889 he left Arles for the [[Saint-Paul Asylum, Saint-Rémy (Van Gogh series)|Saint-Paul asylum]] in [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence]],&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, 145&lt;/ref&gt; having understood his own mental fragility and with a desire to leave Arles.&lt;ref&gt;Maurer, 86&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arles Hospital===
The courtyard of the former Arles hospital, now named "Espace Van Gogh," is a center for van Gogh's works, several of which are masterpieces.&lt;ref name=Fodor&gt;Fisher, 563&lt;/ref&gt; The garden, framed on all four sides by buildings of the complex, is approached through arcades on the first floor.  A circulation gallery is located on the first and second floors.&lt;ref name=ArlesTourism/&gt;

The Old Hospital of Arles, also known as Hôtel-Dieu-Saint-Espirit, was built in the 16th and 17th centuries. Its main entrance was on Rue Dulau in [[Arles]].  In the early 16th century there were thirty-two charitable institutions serving the city.  The archbishop of Arles decided to consolidate the institutions into one organization at the center of Arles.  Construction was conducted over two centuries.  During excavations remains were unearthed from a [[protohistory]] period  [a period between [[prehistory]] and written [[history]] ] revealing an unknown part of the ancient urban framework, as well as a [[necropolis]] from the [[Roman architecture|Roman]] [[esplanade]].&lt;ref name=ArlesTourism/&gt;

In 1835 three wings were built to accommodate a severe [[cholera]] [[epidemic]].  In the beginning of the 20th century the hospital was modified to bring it up to medical standards of the day.  In 1974 the Joseph-Imbert Hospital was opened and many functions of the Old Hospital of Arles transferred to the new hospital.  By 1986 all medical departments had vacated the buildings and the hospital became part of a restoration project to create a cultural and university center.  The center includes "a media library, the public records, the International College of the Literary Translation (C.I.T.L.), the university radio, a vast showroom, as well as a few shops." Architects Denis Froidevaux and Jean-Louis Tétrel, chosen for the project, preserved historic features, such as the Roman [[esplanade]].&lt;ref name=ArlesTourism&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arles-tourisme.com/en_GB/Ville_visite.aspx?Code=79736750-9df2-47a6-b634-62518b8773b5&amp;Page=1&amp;Ville=Arles |title=Espace Van Gogh |work=Visiter, Places of Interest |publisher=Arles Office de Tourisme |accessdate=2011-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323102647/http://www.arles-tourisme.com/en_GB/Ville_visite.aspx?Code=79736750-9df2-47a6-b634-62518b8773b5&amp;Page=1&amp;Ville=Arles |archivedate=2012-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding by benefactors meant the hospital serviced all patient's needs, including abandoned children and orphans.  Starting in 1664 nuns of the [[Augustinians|Order of Saint Augustin]] cared for the patients.&lt;ref name=ArlesTourism/&gt;

==Paintings==
The ''Ward of Arles Hospital'' portrays the institution and the ''Garden of the Hospital in Arles'' the scene outside his hospital room window&lt;ref name=HSW/&gt; or off of a balcony.&lt;ref name=Fell28&gt;Fell, 28&lt;/ref&gt; Van Gogh was also occasionally able to leave the hospital complex and paint the fields.&lt;ref name=HSW/&gt;

===''Garden of the Hospital in Arles''===
Van Gogh made a drawing of the courtyard of the hospital in June 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/20/595.htm |title=Letter from Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh, Saint-Rémy, 17 or 18 June 1889  |editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits| accessdate=2011-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vantage point for the painting was his room within the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bobharris.com/2008/10/ |title=A visit to Van Gogh’s Arles |author=Harris, B |year=2008 |publisher=bob.harris.com |accessdate=2011-04-30 | postscript=" See photo that shows the vantage point that matches exactly to the painting." }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Van Gogh's description and his painting of the garden allow for identification of its flowers, such as: blue bearded irises, forget-me-nots, oleander, pansies, primroses,  and poppies.  The original design of the courtyard as described by Van Gogh has been preserved.  Radiating segments are surrounded by a "plante bande" now filled with irises.  A difference between the painting and the garden is that van Gogh increased the size of the central fish garden for better composition.&lt;ref name=Fell30&gt;Fell, 30&lt;/ref&gt; Adept at using color to convey mood, the shades of blue and gold in the painting seem to suggest melancholy. The yellow, orange, red and green in the painting are not vivid shades seen in other work from Arles, such as ''Bedroom in Arles.''&lt;ref&gt;Acton, 109-110&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ward in the Hospital in Arles''===
In October 1889 van Gogh resumed painting of a fever ward titled ''Ward in the Hospital in Arles''.  The large study had been unattended for a while and van Gogh's interest was sparked when he read an article regarding [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s book ''[[The House of the Dead (novel)|''Souvenirs de la maison des morts'' ("Memories of the House of the Dead")]].&lt;ref name=LW15&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/20/W15.htm  |title=Vincent van Gogh.

Vincent described the painting to his sister [[Wil van Gogh|Wil]], "In the foreground a big black stove around which some grey and black forms of patients and then behind the very long ward paved in red with the two rows of white beds, the partitions white, but a lilac- or green-white, and the windows with pink curtains, with green curtains, and in the background two figures of nuns in black and white. The ceiling is violet with large beams."&lt;ref name=LW15/&gt;

Debra Mancoff, author of ''Van Gogh's Flowers,''&lt;ref&gt;Mancoff&lt;/ref&gt; comments, "In his painting, Ward of Arles Hospital, the exaggerated length of the corridor and the nervous contours that delineate the figures of the patients express the emotional weight of his isolation and confinement."&lt;ref name=HSW&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/arts/artwork/vincent-van-gogh-paintings-from-saint-remy5.htm |title=Ward of Arles Hospital by Vincent van Gogh |author=Mancoff, D |year=2006–2011 |work=HowStuffWorks |publisher=Publications International, Ltd. |accessdate=2011-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Portrait of Dr. Félix Rey''==
Van Gogh made a portrait of the physician who had treated his ear, Dr. Félix Rey, whom he had described in letters to his brother, [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]], as “brave, hardworking, and always helping people.” By January 17, 1889 Van Gogh had given the portrait to Rey as a keepsake.&lt;ref&gt;Van Gogh; Suh, 242&lt;/ref&gt; Rey's mother reportedly deemed the portrait “hideous” and used to close a hole in the family's chicken coop. In 1901, an art dealer, possibly Lucien Molinard– who had received six Van Goghs to sell from Rey in 1900 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Feilchenfeldt |first1=Walter |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NfziAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA306|title=Vincent Van Gogh: The Years in France: Complete Paintings 1886-1890 |date=2013 |page=306 |publisher=Philip Wilson |isbn=1781300194 |accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; –acquired three paintings from Dr. Rey, including the portrait which was in the possession of [[Ambroise Vollard]] by 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Khoshbin |first1=Shahram ||last2=Katz |first2=J.T. |title=“Van Gogh’s Physician” |journal=Infectious Diseases Society of America - Open Forum Infectious Diseases, Volume 2, Issue 3, 1 September 2015, ofv088, |date=September 15, 2015 |volume=2 |issue=3 |doi=10.1093/ofid/ofv088 |url=https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/2/3/ofv088/2460268 |accessdate=1 October 2018 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the portrait was installed at the [[Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts]], with an estimated value of over $50&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vangoghstudio.com/portrait-of-doctor-felix-rey/|title=Portrait of Doctor Félix Rey Oil Painting Reproduction, 1889|website=van gogh studio|language=nl-NL|access-date=22 October 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023061312/http://www.vangoghstudio.com/portrait-of-doctor-felix-rey/|archivedate=23 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hypocatastasis''' is a [[figure of speech]] that declares or implies a [[wikt:resemblance|resemblance]], representation or comparison. It differs from a [[metaphor]], because in a metaphor the two nouns are both named and given; while, in hypocatastasis, only one is named and the other is implied, or as it were, is put down underneath out of sight. Hence hypocatastasis is an implied resemblance or representation: that is an implied simile or metaphor. A hypocatastasis has more force than a metaphor or simile, and expresses as it were a superlative degree of resemblance.

Attribution for the creation of the term is given derisively to a Mr. Lord by G. Bush in 1850.  The latter accuses the former of inventing this category of Biblical comparisons which do not seem to fit into the standard categories of metaphor or [[simile]].&lt;ref name="Bush1850"&gt;{{cite journal|author=George Bush|journal=Anglo-American New Church Repository and Monthly Review: 1851-Feb., 1854|title=The Letter and the Spirit, No. XI|volume=III|issue=4|date=April 1850|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EdgRAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA157|publisher=John Allen|pages=157–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then the term has mostly been confined to analysis of Biblical rhetoric, and it has never migrated to general public usage.  It does not appear in the 2009 version of the [[Oxford English Dictionary]].

Bush says of Lord's term:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Hypocatastasis is the substitution, without a formal notice, of agents and objects of one sphere, or of one species, in the place of the persons or objects of another, as in [[Book of Isaiah|Is.]] iii. 15, "What mean ye that ye crush my people, and grind the faces of the poor?"  These acts, says Mr. L., are not literally impracticable, and therefore are not used metaphorically.  They are violent and extraordinary, and are employed by ''substitution'',  to signify analogous acts of extreme oppression and tyranny.&lt;ref name=Bush1850/&gt;  [Italics in original]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bullinger gives the following example: one may say to another, “You are ''like'' a beast.”&lt;ref&gt;Ethelbert William Bullinger, Figures of Speech Used in the Bible (London; New York: Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode; E. &amp; J. B. Young &amp; Co., 1898), 744.&lt;/ref&gt; This would be simile, tamely stating a fact. If, however, he said, “You ''are'' a beast” that would be metaphor. But, if he said simply, “'''Beast!'''” that would be hypocatastasis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Companion Bible: The Authorized Version of 1611 with the Structures and Critical, Explanatory, and Suggestive Notes and with 198 Appendixes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wiKjA4sqF_0C&amp;pg=RA1-PA25|accessdate=26 September 2013|date=1 August 1994|publisher=Kregel Publications|isbn=978-0-8254-2177-8|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the other part of the simile or metaphor (“you”), would be implied and not stated.  This figure, therefore, is calculated to arouse the mind and attract and excite the attention to the greatest extent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7366">The '''inverted spectrum''' is the [[wikt:hypothetical|hypothetical]] concept of two people sharing their [[color]] vocabulary and discriminations, although the colors one sees &amp;mdash; one's [[qualia]] &amp;mdash; are systematically different from the colors the other person sees. 

[[Image:Inverted qualia of colour strawberry.jpg|thumb|250px|Inverted qualia]]

The concept dates back to [[John Locke]].&lt;ref&gt;(In this passage, Locke uses "idea" to mean something like "mental image", rather than its modern meaning. He also uses "texture" to mean the physical property that gives rise to a color-sensation) "Neither would it carry any Imputation of ''Falshood'' to our simple ''Ideas'', if by the different Structure of our Organs, it were so ordered, That ''the same Object should produce in several Men's Minds different'' Ideas at the same time; v.g. if the ''Idea,'' that a ''Violet'' produced in one Man's Mind by his Eyes, were the same that a ''Marigold'' produces in another Man's, and vice versâ. For since this could never be known: because one Man's Mind could not pass into another Man's Body, to perceive, what Appearances were produced by those Organs; neither the ''Ideas'' hereby, nor the Names, would be at all confounded, or any ''Falshood'' be in either. For all Things, that had the Texture of a ''Violet'', producing constantly the ''Idea'', which he called ''Blue'', and those that had the Texture of a ''Marigold'', producing constantly the ''Idea'', which he as constantly called ''Yellow'', whatever those Appearances were in his Mind; he would be able as regularly to distinguish Things for his Use by those Appearances, and understand, and signify those distinctions, marked by the Names ''Blue'' and ''Yellow'', as if the Appearances, or ''Ideas'' in his Mind, received from those two Flowers, were exactly the same, with the Ideas in other Men's Minds." Locke, J., 1689/1975, Essay Concerning Human Understanding, Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It invites us to imagine that we wake up one morning, and find that for some unknown reason all the colors in the world have been inverted. Furthermore, we discover that no physical changes have occurred in our brains or bodies that would explain this phenomenon. Supporters of the hypothesis of qualia as [[Non-physical entity|non-physical entities]] argue that, since we can imagine this happening without contradiction, it follows that we are imagining a change in a property that determines the way things look to us, but that has no physical basis. In more detail:

#Metaphysical [[identity (philosophy)|identity]] holds of necessity
#[[Modal logic|If something is possibly false, it is not necessary]]
#It is conceivable that qualia could have a different relationship to physical brain-states
#If it is conceivable, then it is [[Logical possibility|possible]]
#Since it is possible for qualia to have a different relationship with physical brain-states, they cannot be identical to brain states (by 1).
#Therefore, qualia are non physical.

The argument thus states that if we find the inverted spectrum plausible, we must admit that qualia exist (and are non physical). Some philosophers find it absurd that an "armchair argument" can prove something to exist, and the detailed argument does involve many assumptions about conceivability and possibility, which are open to criticism. Perhaps it is not possible for a given brain state to produce anything other than a given quale in our universe, and that is all that matters.

The idea that an inverted spectrum would be undetectable is also open to criticism on more scientific grounds:&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia-inverted/ ''Inverted Qualia'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, C. L., 1987, “Qualia and Materialism: Closing the Explanatory Gap”, Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, 48: 281-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|...there are more perceptually distinguishable shades between red and blue than there are between green and yellow, which would make red-green inversion behaviorally detectable. And there are yet further asymmetries. Dark yellow is brown (qualitatively different from yellow), whereas dark blue is blue[..] Similarly, desaturated bluish-red is pink (qualitatively different from saturated bluish-red), whereas desaturated greenish-yellow is similar to saturated greenish-yellow. Again, red is a “warm” color, whereas blue is “cool” — and perhaps this is not a matter of learned associations with temperature.}}

Inverted spectrum arguments have applications to [[behavioralism]], [[physicalism]], [[representationalism]], [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], [[skepticism]] and the [[hard problem of consciousness]].

Vincent Conitzer has illustrated the possibility of an inverted spectrum using the following scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conitzer|first=Vincent|title=A Puzzle about Further Facts|journal=Erkenntnis|arxiv=1802.01161|doi=10.1007/s10670-018-9979-6|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10670-018-9979-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Someone is observing a [[simulated reality]] through a [[virtual reality|VR]] headset, and is not aware that she is wearing a headset or that what she is observing is a simulation.  Conitzer argues that the [[computer code|code]] responsible for the physics of the simulation can be separated from the code that determines ''in which colors'' the simulation is displayed by the headset (as well as determining ''which perspective'' in the simulation to display).  So, it would be possible to change that additional code, inverting the displayed colors, without changing anything about the simulated physics.  Hence, which (real-world) colors are displayed is a [[further facts|further fact]] over and above the facts of the simulated physics.

In his book ''[[I Am A Strange Loop]]'', [[Douglas Hofstadter]] argues that the inverted spectrum argument entails a form of [[solipsism]] in which people can have no idea about what goes on in the minds of others—contrary to the central theme of his work. He presents several variants to demonstrate the absurdity of this idea: the "inverted [[political spectrum]]", in which one person's concept of [[liberty]] is identical to another's concept of [[imprisonment]]; an [[Voice inversion|inverted "sonic spectrum"]] in which low [[musical notes]] sound like "high" ones and vice versa (which he says is impossible because low sounds can be felt physically as vibrations); and a version in which random, complex [[qualia]] such as riding a roller coaster or opening presents are reversed, so that everyone perceives the world in radically different, unknowable ways.

'''John Trobaugh''' (born 1968) in [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]], [[Michigan]] is an [[United States|American]] artist specializing in [[photography]] and based in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]]. Trobaugh received his BFA in 1996 with honors from [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]] and went on to study photography at the [[School of Visual Arts]]. In 2003 he received his Masters in Fine Art from the [[University of Alabama]] in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]], [[Alabama]].

His photography has been published in [[Art Papers]], selected as the cover artist. He has also been published in [[The Chronicle of Higher Education]], [http://nyartsmagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6663&amp;Itemid=199 NY Arts Magazine], [[The Washington Post]] and [[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] as well as [[The Birmingham News]] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928090420/http://worldofwonder.net/archives/2005/Oct/26/why_we_havent_seen_barbie_with_ken_lately.wow World of Wonder], among many others.

While teaching at Sheldon State in Tuscaloosa Alabama, Trobaugh's work was censored before a planned exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbhm.org/News/Public_Arts_Funding.html wbhm.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The case has yet to be resolved but gained national attention due to censorship issues. He was  forbidden to discuss this censorship as part of his art appreciation class. Trobaugh later resigned his post.

Richard Meyer, Chair of the Art Department at The [[University of Southern California]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]], spoke about Trobaugh's work at various national conferences about censorship. Trobaugh was also presented in The [[Smithsonian]] National Gallery and is the author of several articles including [[Art Papers]].

==Work==
In 2005, Space One Eleven exhibited Trobaugh's work alongside [[Karen Graffeo]] for''"In This Place"''. M. K. Matalon organized this exhibition to investigate place and location in relationship to contemporary Southern issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaceoneeleven.org/pr/Graffeo_and_Trobaugh_SOE_Press_Release.html "''Graffeo/Trobaugh''" ''"In This Place''"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929034351/http://www.spaceoneeleven.org/pr/Graffeo_and_Trobaugh_SOE_Press_Release.html |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trobaugh's work was selected to be part of ''Patterns of Nature'' in Denver, Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.colorado.edu/~farsi/conference/slide_trobaugh.html ''Patterns of Nature''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612172359/http://math.colorado.edu/~farsi/conference/slide_trobaugh.html |date=2010-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trobaugh was included in "Politics, Politics: Nine Artists Explore the Political Landscape" curated by [[Anne Arrasmith]] and Peter Prinz of Space One Eleven. This exhibition was funded by the [[Andy Warhol]] Foundation for the Visual Arts and included [[Pinky Bass]], [[Clayton Colvin]], Peggy Dobbins, Randy Gachet, binx Newton, Arthur Price, Paul Ware, and Stan Woodard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaceoneeleven.org/press_releases.html Space One Eleven Press Release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020194416/http://www.spaceoneeleven.org/press_releases.html |date=2006-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trobaugh was a presenter for ''Photography in the Digital Age'' by The Society For Photographic Education South Central Regional Conference, 2003. This meeting took place at the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]] and [[Birmingham Museum of Art]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uab.edu/scrcphoto/SPE_PDF.pdf Society For Photographic Education South Central Regional Conference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508220308/http://www.uab.edu/scrcphoto/SPE_PDF.pdf |date=2006-05-08 }}, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
* In ''Potentially Harmful: The Art of American Censorship'', Trobaugh's work was shown alongside Dread Scott, [[Robert Mapplethorpe]], [[Sue Coe]], [[Lynda Benglis]], [[Andres Serrano]], [[Karen Finley]], Alma Lopez, John Jota Leaos, [[Benita Carr]], Anita Steckel, [[Renee Cox]], Gayla Lemke, Marilyn Zimmerman, John Sims, The Critical Art Ensemble, [[Eric Fischl]], Tom Forsythe, Nancy Worthington, David Avalos, Scott Kessler, Louis Hock and Elizabeth Sisco. This project was funded by a major grant from The [[Andy Warhol]] Foundation for the Visual Arts with considerable local support from the Atlanta Bureau of Cultural Affairs, and the [[Georgia State University]] College of Arts and Sciences Visiting Artists and Scholars Fund, the College of Law, the Ethics Center, [[Women's Studies]], [[African American Studies]], the Department of Communications and additional private donors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsu.edu/~wwwart/gallery/exhibition_current.html ''Potentially Harmful: The Art of American Censorship''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213033118/http://www2.gsu.edu/~wwwart/gallery/exhibition_current.html |date=2007-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes==
* Photographs by John Trobaugh were removed from display for “inappropriate” content at an exhibition at Shelton State Community College in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]], [[Alabama]]. The photographs portray [[Ken Carson|Ken]] and [[G.I. Joe]] posed in romantic (though not sexually explicit) couplings. this decision involved the [[National Coalition Against Censorship]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncac.org National Coalition Against Censorship]&lt;/ref&gt; -Queer Caucus for Art
* The censoring of my work from this faculty exhibition served to illustrate this point because administrators “loved” the images, yet the president of the college removed the whole series. People ask why would I want to show my work in the South anyway? I was raised here, the fantasy world was created here, and the images are made or based in the South. Why shouldn’t the South see what the South created? -John Trobaugh &lt;ref&gt;[http://nyartsmagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6663&amp;Itemid=199 NYArts Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;
* His most recent series, called ''Double Duty'', are photographs using the 12" dolls to make social commentary," the text says. "Trobaugh's photographs uncannily portray human likeness and gesture." True. In fact, for a second, we thought someone had found and posted photos we took in the '70s. Just for a second. -Stephen Saban of [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928090420/http://worldofwonder.net/archives/2005/Oct/26/why_we_havent_seen_barbie_with_ken_lately.wow The WOW Report]
* Actually I like Trobaugh's photos more than [[David Leventhal]]. Nothing is more subjective than art and nothing is more common in art than homoeroticism. -Stephen Smith, [http://www.birminghamfreepress.com/v4.html Birmingham Free Press], 2004

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4176">A '''Kunsthalle''' or '''Kunsthaus''' is a term in [[German language|German]]-speaking regions for a facility that mounts [[art exhibition]]s. The term roughly means "Art Gallery" in English but with a somewhat more specific meaning. A ''Kunsthalle'' is often operated by a non-profit ''Kunstverein'' ("Art Association") and a ''Kunsthaus'' ("Art House") refers more to a gallery or museum with associated artists, symposia, studios and workshops. A ''Kunsthalle'' is also similar to a ''Kunstmuseum'' ("Art Museum"), but the terms mean different things historically. In the strictest sense a ''Kunstmuseum'' has its own permanent collection and a ''Kunsthalle'' does not.

Today the boundaries between these terms are free flowing. In German-speaking countries there are many ''Kunstmuseum'' which are named ''Kunsthalle'' and vice versa. In addition, the activities of a traditional ''Kunsthaus'' are found in all forms of these art institutions.

The purpose of this list is to specifically list those exhibition venues, museums, and art societies which are officially named "Kunsthalle".

'''''Late Night Woman's Hour''''' (LNWH) is a late night edition of the long-running, [[BBC Radio 4]] programme ''[[Woman's Hour]]''. It started in 2015 with a one month pilot run, scheduled twice weekly on Thursday and Friday at 11 pm for one hour.&lt;ref name=Spec/&gt;  The presenters for this first run were [[Lauren Laverne]] and [[Jane Garvey (broadcaster)|Jane Garvey]] who led panels of five guests in discussion of a particular topic such as [[fan fiction]] or [[lust]].&lt;ref name=G15/&gt;  Lauren Laverne then became the permanent host when the programme started a regular schedule in 2016, being scheduled as a monthly podcast which was then broadcast on Radio 4 at 11 pm on the last Thursday of each month.&lt;ref name=RT/&gt;&lt;ref name=G16/&gt; 

The topics discussed in the first run included the dating app, [[Tinder (app)|Tinder]], and lying.  The conversation was frank and adult, being broadcast after the [[Watershed (broadcasting)|watershed]].&lt;ref name=Spec/&gt;  This resulted in a gaffe when one of the guests, Guardian journalist Hannah Jane Parkinson, used an expletive, for which the host apologised.&lt;ref name=G15/&gt;  Other guests have included [[Irma Kurtz]], [[Kellie Maloney]] and [[Richard Herring]].&lt;ref name=Spec/&gt;

Placed by Leticia Green Stevenson Chapter, Daughters of the American Revolution, May 29, 1918. |This plaque marks the site of the Lost Speech.]]

'''Lincoln's''' "'''Lost Speech'''" was a speech given by [[Abraham Lincoln]] at the [[Bloomington Convention]] on May 29, 1856, in [[Bloomington, Illinois]]. Traditionally regarded as lost because it was so engaging that reporters neglected to take notes, the speech is believed to have been an impassioned condemnation of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]. It is possible the text was deliberately "lost" owing to its controversial content.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Speech==
Lincoln's Lost Speech was given at the  since demolished building at the corner of East and Front Streets in downtown [[Bloomington, Illinois]], known as [[Major's Hall]] on May 29, 1856.&lt;ref name=descriptive/&gt; Lincoln gave the speech at the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act|Anti-Nebraska]] [[Bloomington Convention]] that culminated with the founding of the state [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref name=descriptive&gt;[[Federal Writer's Project]], ''Illinois: A Descriptive and Historical Guide'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=soYJZ1cXqr8C&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq=Lincoln+%22Lost+SPeech%22&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=tfSA0O7JzmCIOIGMyMedGqaaFuc Google Books]), A.C. McClurg &amp; Company, Chicago: 1939, p. 164, ({{ISBN|1603540121}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no known transcripts or written accounts of the Lost Speech, other than a brief summary in the local press. Eyewitnesses have offered snippets of some of Lincoln's content that day. [[William Herndon (lawyer)|William Herndon]] asserted that some of [[Lincoln's House Divided Speech]] was not based on new concepts at the time of its delivery. He wrote that Lincoln's "house divided against itself cannot stand" originated with the famous Bloomington speech of 1856.&lt;ref name=briggs&gt;Briggs, John Channing. ''Lincoln's Speeches Reconsidered'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=DV_JviCyOJ4C&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=Lincoln+%22Lost+SPeech%22&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=nHRjHK4lziG35ncN8bIOsjJZ0WE#PPA165,M1 Google Books]), JHU Press, 2005, pp. 165&amp;ndash;66, ({{ISBN|0801881064}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Editor of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' [[Joseph Medill]] claimed that Chicago lawyer [[Henry Clay Whitney]]'s transcript of the speech was accurate; Whitney's version was later debunked.&lt;ref name=ida/&gt;&lt;ref name=peterson/&gt;

It is thought that the speech was a strongly worded derision of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]].&lt;ref name=btown&gt;"[http://www.downtownbloomington.org/content.php?section=history The Historical Significance of Downtown Bloomington] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213033750/http://www.downtownbloomington.org/content.php?section=history |date=2008-02-13 }}", Our History, ''Downtown Bloomington Association'', accessed April 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=February 2018}} It is known that Lincoln's condemnation of the expansion of slavery was strong.&lt;ref name=pantagraph&gt;Cima, Greg. "[http://www.pantagraph.com/articles/2006/05/30/news/114095.txt Inspiration found in 'lost speech']{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}", ''The Pantagraph'' ([[Bloomington, Illinois]]), May 30, 2006, accessed April 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional reason given for the lack of any written recollection of the Lost Speech is that Lincoln's skilled and powerful oration had mesmerized every person in attendance. Reporters were said to have laid down their pencils and neglected note taking, as if hypnotized by Lincoln's words. When the speech ended no notes existed, so media reports of the day simply recorded the fact that the speech had been delivered.&lt;ref name=peterson&gt;Peterson, Merrill D. ''Lincoln in American Memory'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=D_FjY_ARcGoC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=Lincoln+%22Lost+SPeech%22&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=aCWgQidhecgrdIC3JM1tsWn_4X0 Google Books]), Oxford University Press, 1994, p. 154, ({{ISBN|0195096452}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence in Herndon's recollections that the fact that the speech was "lost" may not have been an accident. So strongly worded was Lincoln's oration that others in attendance feared the words might lead to a crumbling of the Union and that Lincoln consented to suspending "its repetition" for the duration of the 1856 campaign.&lt;ref name=briggs/&gt;

==Whitney version==
In 1896, Chicago attorney [[Henry Clay Whitney]] published his [https://archive.org/details/abrahamlincoln00linc account of the speech] in an issue of ''[[McClure's Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name=mcclures&gt;[[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln, Abraham]], Whitney, Henry Clay and [[Joseph Medill|Medill, Joseph]]. "Lincoln's Lost Speech", Now First Published from the Unique Report", ([https://books.google.com/books?id=gyQXHAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Henry+Clay+Whitney+Lost+SPeech&amp;client=firefox-a Google Books]), ''McClure's Magazine'', S.S. McClure, September 1896, pp. 319&amp;ndash;31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lifeoflincoln/&gt; Whitney claimed he had taken notes during the speech and based his version of the speech upon those notes.&lt;ref name=lifeoflincoln&gt;Whitney, Henry Clay and Miller, Marion Mills. ''Life of Lincoln'' ([https://books.google.com/books?id=F5rlYX9XSZMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA327&amp;dq=Lincoln+%22Lost+SPeech%22&amp;client=firefox-a Google Books]), The Baker &amp; Taylor Company, New York: 1908, pp. 327&amp;ndash;52.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Whitney's version was given some credibility. [[Ida Tarbell]] sought out Joseph Medill, who was present at the Lost Speech, and he claimed that Whitney's version displayed "remarkable accuracy".&lt;ref name=ida&gt;[[Ida M. Tarbell|Tarbell, Ida M]]. ''All In a Day's Work: An Autobiography'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=qrZBbVRIO10C&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq=Lincoln+%22Lost+SPeech%22&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=OyvDtlAWc7cCOYSDfceobVtfj-Q#PPA173,M1 Google Books]), 2003, University of Illinois Press, p. 173, ({{ISBN|0252071360}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Tarbell was unwittingly carried away by the story, but others were skeptical. Former Lincoln private secretary [[John George Nicolay]] declared Whitney's version devoid of Lincoln's style and a fraud.&lt;ref name=peterson/&gt; [[Robert Lincoln]], Abraham's son, agreed with Nicolay's assessment.&lt;ref name=peterson/&gt; In 1900, the [[McLean County, Illinois|McLean County]] Historical Society&lt;ref name=mclean&gt;The location of the speech, Bloomington, Illinois, is found in [[McLean County, Illinois|McLean County]].&lt;/ref&gt; declared their skepticism.&lt;ref name=mclean2&gt;Prince, Ezra M., ed.  ''[http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3543:20.lincoln Meeting of May 29, 1900 Commemorative of the Convention of May 29, 1856 That Organized the Republican party in the State of Illinois (Transactions of the McLean County Historical Society v. 3)''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610230629/http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3543%3A20.lincoln |date=June 10, 2011 }}, 1900, Abraham Lincoln Historical Digitization Project, [[Northern Illinois University]], accessed April 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, Lincoln researcher and Director of the [[Chicago Historical Society]] Paul M. Angle exposed Whitney's version of the speech and his claims of its validity as a "fabrication".&lt;ref name=peterson/&gt;

==Importance==
Lincoln's Lost Speech was famous, with a status considered legendary by the time Tarbell became enamored with Whitney's version of it.&lt;ref name=peterson/&gt; Lincoln was said to have spoken "like a giant inspired" and the tale of how the speech came to be lost was well known.&lt;ref name=peterson/&gt; Many who attended the speech considered it the greatest of Lincoln's life.&lt;ref name=angle&gt;Angle, Paul M. ''Abraham Lincoln by Some Men Who Knew Him'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=SNRoMIHas8wC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=lincoln+%22lost+speech%22&amp;lr=&amp;sig=546Akyu1x2NCbyiroi7iUYBYhxU Google Books]), Ayer Publishing, 1950, pp. 29&amp;ndash;30, ({{ISBN|083691242X}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Given at the first state convention, which essentially founded the [[Illinois Republican Party]], the speech thrust Lincoln into the national political limelight.&lt;ref name=pantagraph/&gt;&lt;ref name=angle/&gt;

Though it was known as the Lost Speech, its content influenced people nonetheless. Those who heard it were often asked to repeat what they heard and a frenzied group of supporters spearheaded Lincoln's drive toward a second-place finish among [[U.S. Vice President|U.S. vice presidential]] candidates in 1856.&lt;ref name=illtimes&gt;Wheeler, Samuel P. "[https://archive.is/20130127033640/http://www.illinoistimes.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid:7179 Adultery, Murder and Lincoln]," ''Illinois Times'', December 27, 2007, accessed April 18, 2088.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Magic:  The Gathering'' Pro Tour Hall of Fame''' was started in 2005 to honor the most successful ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' [[Pro Tour (Magic: The Gathering)|Pro Tour]] players. The first inductions came on the tenth anniversary of the first Pro Tour event, and new Hall of Famers will be determined annually. Players who are eligible for the ballot (as below) can be voted in the Hall of Fame if they get more than 60% of the election committee's votes. As of 2018, there are 48 players from 12 different countries in the Hall of Fame.

{{TOC right}}

==Eligibility==
In order to appear on the [[Hall of Fame]] selection ballot, a player must meet the following five requirements (Or the first four requirement if they never appeared in any previous ballots):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Pro Tour Hall of Fame Updates Plus RPTQ Decks | publisher = [[Wizards of the Coast]] | date = 8 June 2017 | accessdate = 24 June 2017 | url = http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/organized-play/pro-tour-hall-fame-updates-plus-rptq-decks-2017-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Hall of Fame Rules | publisher = [[Wizards of the Coast]] | date = 16 June 2013 | accessdate = 4 August 2013 | url = http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/HallOfFame.aspx?x=mtgevent/hof/rules}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The player must have participated in his or her first ''Magic: the Gathering'' Pro Tour at least 10 seasons prior to the current voting year.
# The player must have at least 150 lifetime Pro Tour Points. (Prior to 2013, the threshold was 100 lifetime Pro Tour Points.)
# The player must have at least 2 single-elimination round finishes in Pro Tours. (From 2017 onwards)
# The player must not currently be suspended from playing ''Magic'' or be under investigation by the [[The DCI|DCI]] (Previous suspension does not disqualify a player from entering the Hall of Fame.)
# The player must not currently be removed from ballot by the voting committee. If they are currently removed by the ballot, they must finish with at least 4 Pro Points in period between the previous and current voting.

(* Pro Tour includes all [[Magic: The Gathering World Championship|''Magic: The Gathering'' World Championship]] before year 2011)

==Voting process==
The Selection Committee votes on who to induct into the Hall of Fame. The committee includes [[Wizards of the Coast]] employees, [[The DCI|DCI]] members, judges, long-time reporters, developers, all Hall of Famers, and every ''Magic'' player with at least 150 Pro Points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Selection Committee | year = 2016 | accessdate = 17 July 2016 | publisher = [[Wizards of the Coast]] | url = http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/top-players/pthof/2016/selection-committee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every member of the Selection Committee gets to vote for up to five of the eligible players. Afterwards every player with at least 60% of the votes gets inducted into the Hall of Fame. If nobody gets 60% of the vote, the player with the most votes will be inducted into the Hall of Fame.

If a player received 10% or less of the votes in 3 consecutive votings, they will be removed from the Hall of Fame ballot. They will be eligible again if they score 4 Pro Tour Points during a specific period (roughly the same period between two consecutive votings).

===Historical selection process===
The selection procedure was changed several times. In 2005 the Selection Committee voted for five players, and the four players receiving the most votes were inducted. Then a Players' Committee voted for one player that was not already selected, and the player receiving the most votes was also inducted.

From 2006 members of the Selection Committee and the Players' Committee received the list of players eligible for induction. Each member selected five players for induction. The votes were tabulated by a weighted percentage:  Selection Committee votes counted 2/3, and Players' Committee votes counted 1/3. In 2006 and 2007 the five players with the highest percentages were inducted into the Hall of Fame. Between 2008 and 2016 only the players with over 40% of the weighted votes were inducted or if no one mets this criterion the player with the highest percentage was inducted.

==Benefits==
The Hall of Fame inductees will receive a number of benefits for the rest of his or her life (unless suspended by the DCI). As of 2016–17 season, it includes the benefits below:
#A guaranteed entry to any Pro Tour event and [[Magic: The Gathering World Championship#World Magic Cup|World Magic Cup]] Qualifiers
#Appearance fee at the Pro Tour featuring the yearly Hall of Fame induction.
#Bye(s) in Grand Prix and World Magic Cup Qualifiers.
#Additional [[Magic: The Gathering Online|''Magic Online'']] Championship Series seasonal QPs.
If a Hall of Fame player is a current Platinum level member of the Pro Players Club, the higher reward will apply to them (i.e. they receive two instead of one bye in World Magic Cup Qualifiers, 20QP instead of 15QP in the ''Magic Online'' Championship Series).

Players who enter the Hall of Fame since will also receive a special commemorative ring at the induction ceremony.

==Controversies==

===Tomoharu Saito banning===
In the ballot of 2010, [[Tomoharu Saito]] was voted into the Hall of Fame with a weighted percentage of 47.74%.&lt;ref name="Ballots2010"/&gt; However, two weeks prior to the induction Saito was disqualified during Grand Prix Florence leading to an 18-month suspension from the game. The rules do not allow currently-suspended players to be voted into the Hall of Fame. Wizards announced without further explanation that Saito would not be part of the Hall of Fame based on the 2010 ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Saito removed from Hall of Fame selection | publisher = [[Wizards of the Coast]] | date = 8 December 2010 | accessdate = 8 December 2010 | url = http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/news/120810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bram Snepvangers miscalculation===
In the original ballot results for 2010, Bram Snepvangers received a weighted percentage of 39.95%, barely missing the required 40%. However, in the days following the publication of results it was discovered that there had been an error in the calculations. Weights of 0.667 and 0.333 had been used for the votes from the Selection Committee and Players Committee respectively while the rules clearly stated that 0.67 and 0.33 were the correct numbers. After recalculating the scores Snepvangers landed at 40.03% and was inducted into the Hall of Fame along with Nassif and Kibler.&lt;ref name="Snepvangers"/&gt;

'''''Micki &amp; Maude''''' is a 1984 American [[comedy film]] directed by [[Blake Edwards]] and starring [[Dudley Moore]]. It co-stars Tony Award-winning actress and dancer [[Ann Reinking]] as Micki and [[Amy Irving]] as Maude.

With the exception of appearances as herself, as in the documentary ''[[Mad Hot Ballroom]]'' in 2005, this has been Reinking's last film role as of 2016.

The film co-stars [[Wallace Shawn]] and includes two scenes with wrestler [[André the Giant]] in which he is introduced by his own name. Unlike their later roles in ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'', the two do not appear together onscreen. 

This film was remade in Tamil as ''[[Rettai Vaal Kuruvi]]'' starring Mohan, Archana, and Rathika Sarathkumar, and directed by [[Balu_Mahendra|Balu Mahindra]]. It was also remade in Malayalam as ''Paavakoothu'' (1990) starring [[Jayaram]], [[Parvathy Jayaram|Parvathy]] and [[Ranjini (actress)|Ranjini]].

==Plot==
Rob Salinger ([[Dudley Moore]]) is an overworked television reporter. He is happily married to Micki ([[Ann Reinking]]), a lawyer who is a candidate to become a judge.  Rob wants a child badly, but Micki is reluctant due to a previous miscarriage and wanting to focus on her career. On an assignment, Rob interviews a young cellist, Maude Guillory ([[Amy Irving]]). He is smitten with her and begins a relationship with her. When she becomes pregnant, the two decide to get married, with Maude and her father, [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] Barkhas Guillory ([[Hard Boiled Haggerty]]) planning the wedding.

Rob prepares to confess to Micki and get a divorce. But before he can reveal his affair with Maude, Micki stuns him by announcing that she, too, is pregnant. She confesses that she initially planned on having an abortion as pregnancy would interfere with her career and not tell him, but realized how much she wants to have a family with him. However, she cannot exert or stress herself too much as it would endanger her and the baby. Rob becomes a [[Bigamy|bigamist]]. With his television boss and best friend Leo ([[Richard Mulligan]]) covering for him, he sees one wife during the daytime and the other at night, using work as an excuse. He gets away with it until the fates collide: Micki and Maude going into labor at the same time, in the same hospital, on the same floor.

The two women end up becoming friends, but realizing that Rob had been dishonest with them, they ban Rob from their lives and the lives of the children. Rob follows them around, spying on both families from a distance. Eventually Rob reconciles with both Micki and Maude, though it is not clear if the two women are aware he has reconciled with the other. The film ends with the women pursuing their careers: Micki as a judge presiding in a courtroom, Maude playing cello in a symphony orchestra. The film closes with a shot of Rob in a park years later, with two babies and his six other children he has had over the years with Micki and Maude.

[[File:FemaleMobiledj2.jpg|thumb|Mobile disc jockey]]
'''Mobile disc jockeys''' (also known as '''mobile DJs''' or '''mobile discos''') are [[disc jockey]]s that tour with portable sound, lighting, and video systems.&lt;ref name="answers.com"&gt;http://www.answers.com/topic/mobile-disc-jockey&lt;/ref&gt; They play music for a targeted audience from a collection of pre-recorded music using [[Gramophone record|vinyl records]], [[Compact Cassette|cassettes]], [[Compact disc|CDs]], or digital music formats such as [[USB flash drive]]s or [[Laptop|laptop computers]].&lt;ref name="answers.com"/&gt;

Mobile DJs perform at a variety of events including [[wedding reception]]s, [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah]] receptions, company parties, school dances, anniversaries, and birthday parties. They also perform in public at taverns, nightclubs, and block parties.&lt;ref name="Zemon, Stacy 2002"/&gt;
 
Business models for mobile disc jockeys include full-time, part-time, multi-operator, and single-operator companies.&lt;ref name="Zemon, Stacy 2002"&gt;Zemon, Stacy.  ''The Mobile DJ Handbook: How to Start &amp; Run a Profitable Mobile Disc Jockey Service'', Second Edition.  St. Louis:  Focal Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept of mobile discos started in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1966, when Roger Squire began an entertainment service in North [[London]] named "Roger Squire's Mobile Discothèques". The word ''discothèque'' is French for "disco". Within two years, Squire had fifteen mobile discothèques performing approximately sixty functions each week. He performed at events attended by celebrities and royalty, at countless college dances, wedding receptions, and all kinds of social events. Over the next few years, many copycat "Mobile Discos" started to emulate his successful formula. During this period, London got its "[[Swinging London]]" reputation. Squire later set up a disco equipment supply service that sold disco sound and lighting systems to budding DJs, both in the United Kingdom and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Jerry 1983 "The Beginning" Disco International &amp; Club News (UK Magazine), August edition, pages 49 – 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s and 1990s, mobile DJs began to form associations and create professional business networks that evolved into annual trade shows and internet discussion forums. The early 1990s saw the emergence of organized professional trade shows such as the "Mobile Beat Show" in [[Las Vegas]], Nevada, and the "DJ Times Expo" in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], New Jersey. Seminars by numerous respected DJs such as John Rozz, Ray "Ray Mar" Martinez, Stacy Zemon, Mark Ferrell, [[Peter Merry]], Randy Bartlett, and Steve Moody{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} have helped DJs to better understand their profession, how to be more professional and to treat being a DJ as a business operation.

1991 saw the publication of ''Mobile Beat'', a magazine geared specifically toward mobile DJs. In 1992, the [[Moving Picture Experts Group]] (MPEG), released The MPEG-1 file standard, designed to produce reasonable sound from a digital file using minimal storage. The lossy compression scheme MPEG-1 Layer-3, popularly known as [[MP3]], later revolutionized the digital music domain.

In 1998, [[Final Scratch]] debuted at the BE Developer Conference, marking the first digital DJ system to give DJs control of MP3 files through special time-coded vinyl records or CDs. While it would take some time for this novel concept to catch on with the "die hard" vinyl-oriented DJs, it was the first step in the new digital DJ revolution. Manufacturers joined with computer DJ pioneers to offer professional endorsements, the first being "Professor Jam", also known as William P. Rader, who went on to develop the industry's first dedicated computer DJ convention and learning program, the "Computerized Performance System" (CPS) known as "DJ Summit", which helped spread the word about the advantages of this emerging technology.

The American Disc Jockey Awards Show was established, and its first edition was held in Las Vegas, Nevada. Since then, thirteen mobile DJs have been elected to the American Disc Jockey Hall of Fame. The thirteen members include John Rozz, Al Lampkin, Joe Martin, Robert A. Lindquist, Jon Michaels, Mike Buonaccorso, Sid Vanderpool, Bobby Morganstein, John Roberts, Ken Knotts, Ray "Ray Mar" Martinez, Cesar Cosio, and Bernie Howard-Fryman.&lt;ref&gt;Mobile Beat Magazine May 2006 Issue Page 48&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Disc Jockey Awards Show annually recognizes and honors individuals who have given of themselves to benefit their community or a charitable cause in the name of the ADJA or the DJ Trade as a whole. &lt;!-- Known as the Michael Butler Humanitarian Award, recipients include the following:&lt;br /&gt;
1998 – Mark “Peace” Thomas&lt;br /&gt;
1999 – Ray Martinez&lt;br /&gt;
2000 – Professor Jam (aka William P. Rader)&lt;br /&gt;
2003 – Patrick McDonald&lt;br /&gt;
2006 – Larry Williams&lt;br /&gt;
2007 – Jeremy Miller&lt;br /&gt;
2007 – Roy Dueitt&lt;br /&gt;
2007 – Bill Dunsing&lt;br /&gt;
2008 -  Louie Castellanos&lt;br /&gt;
2009 -  Ed Frank&lt;br /&gt;
2011 -  Eric Horne&lt;br /&gt;
2012 – Geoffrey Sandler&lt;br /&gt;
2013 – Mitch Taylor
--&gt;

The "DJ of the Year" winners at the DJ Times Expo include three-time winner Marcello Pedalino, Roxanne Greene, K.C. KoKoruz, Shawn "Big Daddy" McKee, Marz Lawhorn, Gerry Siracusa, Adam Weitz, Steve Moody and Pascal Levesque who, in 2013, was the first Canadian to take part in the competition. Pascal Levesque from Québec, Canada, was named "DJ of the Year Runner-Up" and won the "Best Dance" award.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Developments==
A number of books have been written about the business, and by furthering their education at trade shows and seminars, mobile DJs have gained a positive public perception. In the 1970s Mobile DJs were averaging $350–500 per four-hour event; now a wedding reception can cost between $800–2,500 per event, with the national average being around $1,038.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xogroupinc.com/press-releases-home/2014-press-releases/2014-03-27-real-weddings-study-average-cost-of-wedding.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620151633/http://www.xogroupinc.com/press-releases-home/2014-press-releases/2014-03-27-real-weddings-study-average-cost-of-wedding.aspx |archivedate=2014-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many club disc jockeys still use traditional vinyl records, many mobile DJs also currently use [[compact disc]]s, computer-based files (such as [[MP3]]s), or a combination of sources. In addition, professional-grade equipment created by a variety of companies expressly for the mobile DJ industry has allowed for faster set-up and break down times and improved quality of performance.&lt;ref name="Graudins, Charles A. 2004"&gt;Graudins, Charles A. "How to Be a DJ''.  Boston:  Course Technology PTR, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advance of in-home sound systems, the audience expectation level of sound and lighting shows for concerts, conventions, and weddings has increased. [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] technology is the most recent light show technology incorporated by the trade. A large selection of music, professional-grade equipment, good organizational skills, vocal talent as a Master of Ceremonies, mixing skills, quality lighting, insurance for [[Legal liability|liability]], and on-site back-up equipment are typical of the expectations customers have when hiring a mobile DJ.&lt;ref name="Graudins, Charles A. 2004"/&gt; Suggestions for hiring mobile disc jockeys include requests for referrals, approximate age of equipment, level of insurance, contract terms and fees, and provision of electrical sources.

Many mobile DJs also promote themselves as event planners, organizers, and [[Master of ceremonies]] (MC). They work closely with their customers, guests, and the event's other vendors (e.g. venue staff and photographers/videographers) to provide quality entertainment that fits the event in terms of style and performance.&lt;ref name="Zemon, Stacy 2002"/&gt;

This increased role in event planning has been facilitated by the emergence of [[Sweet sixteen (birthday)|sweet sixteens]], popularized by the [[MTV]] reality show, ''[[My Super Sweet 16]]''. Today's mobile DJs are tasked with putting together major productions for these events, which require customization in every element of “her big night”. As huge as the demand for qualified teen-event DJs is, the equipment list to bring a full production on the road for a successful event is more than most can afford. With large-screen video, fog, light up dance floors, glow lights, lasers, high end dance lighting, and booming sound, today's Sweet Sixteens are setting the bar high for future generations.

[[File:Bobbio flasks ampullae VIc.jpg|thumb|A flask from [[Bobbio]], with the ''[[Myrrhbearers|Women at the empty tomb]]'']]
The '''Monza ampullae''' form the largest collection of a specific type of Early Medieval [[pilgrimage]] [[ampullae]] or small flasks designed to hold holy oil from pilgrimage sites in the [[Holy Land]] related to the life of Jesus.  They were made in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], probably in the fifth to early seventh centuries,&lt;ref&gt;"datable more or less between 500 and 650" says Vikan (1998), 241, but ranges vary with authors.&lt;/ref&gt; and have been in the Treasury of [[Monza Cathedral]] north of [[Milan]] in Italy since they were donated by [[Theodelinda]], queen of the [[Lombards]], (c. 570–628).  Since the great majority of surviving examples of such flasks are those in the Monza group, the term may be used to cover this type of object in general.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 57–59&lt;/ref&gt;

The second largest group was discovered in a burial at [[Bobbio Abbey]], not far from Monza, and names such as '''Monza/Bobbio flasks''' ampullae or [[flagon]]s are among the many terms by which these objects are described.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 57–59&lt;/ref&gt;  The few other examples are now scattered across the world; this article deals with the whole group of over fifty known ampullae, wherever located.&lt;ref&gt;There are perhaps 36 from Monza, at least 10 from Bobbio (some are fragments), three in Germany and two in the US, plus an example from Catalonia that probably falls rather outside the date range of the others—see locations section below.&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of comparable ampullae from pilgrimage sites outside the [[Holy Land]] have also survived, for example a very similar one from a Syrian site related to [[Saint Sergius]], now in the [[Walters Art Museum]], Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learn.columbia.edu/treasuresofheaven/relics/Pilgrim-Flask-of-St-Sergios.php Comparable ampulla] of St Sergius from Syria, Walters Art Museum, Baltimore (illustrated, right).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ampullae are [[Casting|cast]] in various metals, including [[silver]] (perhaps "silvered" would be more accurate),&lt;ref&gt;Descriptions of the metals used vary widely.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[tin]] and [[lead]], and are mainly of interest because of the images they carry, which come from a period which has left very few traces in art, and was of crucial importance in establishing the [[iconography]] of many Christian subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Leroy, 320–321&lt;/ref&gt; They are also believed to represent buildings and shrines found in [[Jerusalem]] in the sixth and early seventh centuries, giving important evidence as to the early appearance of these.&lt;ref&gt;Hackel, 177&lt;/ref&gt;  They were brought back from the [[Holy Land]] filled with oil which had been used in lamps burning before important pilgrimage shrines.&lt;ref&gt;Milburn, 264; Beckwith 57–60, and many other of the references&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their ending up in the heart of the institutional church under royal patronage, the ampullae were made as mass-produced souvenirs, probably relatively inexpensive, whose designs reflect the experiences and concerns of pilgrims as well as those of the church.

==General description==
The ampullae are round when seen from the front, with a flattened body giving convex faces and a small neck, often with a fitting round the neck for a chain or cord by which they could be suspended, or perhaps worn. There are records of similar blessed objects, or [[eulogia]], being hung on the bedpost for protection from demons at night,&lt;ref&gt;Vikan (1982), 12&lt;/ref&gt; and the oil, or just the relic, was believed to be able to heal the sick when applied to them.&lt;ref&gt;Vikan (1998), 235&lt;/ref&gt;  Often there is a strip in a different metal running round the edge of the faces and up the sides of the neck, with little rings for a suspension cord.  In the Monza examples these strips are secured by wire wound rather untidily round the neck.  A diameter for the main body of about 5–7&amp;nbsp;cm is typical, and in a side view the body swells to a maximum thickness of about 3&amp;nbsp;cm.  Those at Monza are in generally good condition, but those from Bobbio and other examples such as the one at [[Dumbarton Oaks]] are flattened and damaged; they are now mostly black in colour.&lt;ref&gt;Dumbarton Oaks ''''Catalogue of the Byzantine and Early Mediaeval Antiquities'' contains a detailed catalogue description of a single example.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their small size, the images are typically crowded multi-figure compositions, sometimes with extensive depiction of architectural elements, and somewhat crude in execution.  They appear in low [[relief]], typically occupying all the space of the faces on both sides of the ampulla, though some have figureless decoration, usually centred on a cross, on the reverse face. There are often inscriptions and ''[[Titulus (inscription)|tituli]]'' in medieval Greek, many running round the outside of a face, or dividing an upper scene from a lower one.  A smaller scene may occupy the lower part of a face, or scenes may appear in small [[roundel]]s grouped across the overall design.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 57–59; Dumbarton Oaks. A good illustration of a typical example is at the [http://www.egeriaproject.net/mov_display.aspx?id=179 Egeria website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subjects==
Subjects were linked with the most famous pilgrimage sites of the Holy Land, and especially [[Jerusalem]], where the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] contained both the greater part of the [[True Cross]] and the Tomb of Christ,&lt;ref&gt;Vikan (1998), 241&lt;/ref&gt; as well as an altar dedicated to the [[Adoration of the Magi]].&lt;ref&gt;Milburn, 264&lt;/ref&gt; Common subjects, which account for the great majority of the designs, are:
*The ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' summarized in a number of scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Monza no. 2, silver, with seven scenes on one side. Schiller I, 26 and fig. 55&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''[[Adoration of the Magi]]'' combined with the ''[[Annunciation to the Shepherds]]''; the ampullae are the first surviving depictions to show both Magi and shepherds together paying homage to the infant Jesus held by his mother, which remain very common throughout the later history of Christian art.  As often later, a balanced composition is created by having the magi to the left of the Virgin and Child, and the shepherds to the right. It has been speculated that the compositions reflect a lost [[mosaic]] then in the [[apse]] of the [[Church of the Nativity, Bethlehem]].&lt;ref&gt;Monza no.1, silver and no.3. See Schiller I, 104 &amp; fig. 258 and Milburn, 264. Beckwith, 57 has an illustration. Though the link with the mosaic remains a common view, Vikan (1998), (p. 241 and elsewhere) discounts such precise derivations, ? perhaps following Grabar.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''[[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism of Christ]]''
*The ''[[Crucifixion of Jesus]]'', where ampullae show the emerging depiction of the scene, which was a famously late arrival in the repertory of Christian imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Monza nos. 6, 10, 13, Dumbarton Oaks [https://books.google.com/books?id=P1_BBK-LsesC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=Bobbio+flask&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KGnpS-WCC8v0_Abs8-njCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Bobbio%20flask&amp;f=false image], and others. Schiller II, 90 and fig. 324;  [http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07072009-210837/unrestricted/HostetlerBThesis.pdf Monza no. 6 is fig 21 here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312012759/http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07072009-210837/unrestricted/HostetlerBThesis.pdf |date=2012-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ampullae often show an empty cross with a bust of Christ above it, and kneeling pilgrims at its foot; this is thought to depict the scene around the large ''[[crux gemmata]]'' installed in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre at the time - some therefore prefer to call these scenes the ''[[Adoration of the Cross]]''.  The two thieves are often shown on their crosses even when Christ's central cross has no ''corpus'', as in the Dumbarton Oaks example.
[[File:S. Apollinare Nuovo Marys at Tomb.jpg|thumb|300px|Early 6th century [[mosaic]] in [[San Apollinare Nuovo]], [[Ravenna]] with a depiction of the ''[[Myrrhbearers|Women at the empty tomb]]''  similar to that on ampullae, though reversed and with no [[censer]].]] 
*''Jesus and [[Doubting Thomas]]'';&lt;ref&gt;Monza no. 9, Bobbio no. 10, see Leroy, 322; Milburn, 264&lt;/ref&gt; since these seem to have been sold at Jerusalem, not where the biblical episode was located in tradition, it seems these suggested a link between the experience of Thomas, who doubted until he saw and touched the physical evidence of Christ's wounds, and that of the pilgrim, whose faith was also reinforced by the sight of, and physical contact with, the scenes and [[relic]]s of Christ's life.&lt;ref&gt;Vikan (1982), 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''[[Resurrection of Jesus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Monza nos. 10 and 11 both have a ''Crucifixion'' and ''Resurrection'' on one side, and an ''Ascension'' on the reverse. Noga-Banai, 104&lt;/ref&gt; usually represented by the ''[[Myrrhbearers|Women at the empty tomb]]'', with the tomb represented by the "aedicula" or shrine built by [[Constantine I]] within the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on what was believed to be the appropriate spot.  This is now covered or replaced by later accretions, and its 6th century appearance is only known from such representations.&lt;ref&gt;Milburn, 264. See also the Dumbarton Oaks and Schiller examples, and Monza no. 6 -  [http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07072009-210837/unrestricted/HostetlerBThesis.pdf image fi. 21 here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312012759/http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07072009-210837/unrestricted/HostetlerBThesis.pdf |date=2012-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically, two women approach from the left of the tomb, while an angel sits to its right.  One of the women, perhaps to be identified as [[Mary Magdalene]], often seems to be carrying a [[censer]], suggesting to scholars a reflection of the contemporary rituals performed at the tomb. The door or lid of the tomb, which has been pushed aside by the angel to allow Christ to exit,&lt;ref&gt;according to  {{Bibleref2c|Mt|28:1-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be represented by a [[lozenge]] shape, as in the [[mosaic]] at right, apparently reflecting the contemporary display in the aedicula.&lt;ref&gt;as in Monza no. 5, see King&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''[[Ascension of Jesus]]'', usually with the ''[[Pentecost]]'' below.&lt;ref&gt;Milburn, 264. See also the ''Resurrection'' note above.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Saints, typically on the reverse side, with a ''[[New Testament]]'' scene on the [[obverse]].&lt;ref&gt;Milburn, 264&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourteen of the Monza and Bobbio ampullae combine on one face ''Crucifixions'' above the ''Women at the empty tomb'', which are also on the two faces in other examples.&lt;ref&gt;Dumbarton Oaks&lt;/ref&gt;  Two of the flasks, one each at Bobbio and Monza, show a large Christ [[Jesus walking on water|walking on water]] and rescuing [[Saint Peter]] from drowning, as the other apostles watch from a boat, perhaps reflecting the anxieties of the sea voyages many pilgrims faced as they returned home.&lt;ref&gt;Vikan (1998), 247–248; Milburn, 264&lt;/ref&gt; Another Bobbio scene shows a Virgin [[Orant]] flanked by [[John the Baptist]] and his father [[Zechariah (priest)|Zacharias]].&lt;ref&gt;Pitarakis, 159&lt;/ref&gt; Figures that appear to be images of pilgrims, as a kind of generalised [[donor portrait]], appear in many scenes, usually kneeling,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Dumbarton Oaks&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the emphasis on the pilgrim experience noted above in discussing the ''Doubting Thomas'' scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Peers, 41–42; Vikan (1982), 24–25; Wharton, 26–27; Hackel, 177&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context and style==
[[File:Jerusalem Holy Sepulchre BW 7.JPG|thumb|left|Modern pilgrims at the ''[[aedicule]]'' over the tomb of Christ in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]].]]
The ampullae join other small-scale Christian works of art from this period, from which almost no major works have survived, and very few manuscript illuminations.  These include [[amulet]]s, [[devotional medal]]s and other forms of pilgrimage souvenirs.  Many of these are in the cheaper material of [[terracotta]], such as the [[Menas flask]]s that have been found from [[Cheshire]] to the [[Sudan]] and come from [[Abu Mena]] in [[Egypt]], the exceptionally popular shrine of [[Saint Menas]].&lt;ref&gt;Vikan (1982), 16&lt;/ref&gt;  Small round terracotta "pilgrimage tokens" or ampullae for oil, water or earth from the Holy Land, are often excavated, and examples of the tokens are also in the Monza treasury; the [[Piacenza Pilgrim]] records that in the 570s earth was kept piled up in the tomb of Christ to be taken by pilgrims.&lt;ref&gt;Vikan (1982): on earth, 12, on water, 15, on a clay token at Bobbio, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of these pieces, in the words of John Beckwith, "rate as works of art little more than a [[hot cross bun]]".&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 57&lt;/ref&gt;  However few of these works have images with the complexity of those on the ampullae.  There is a small wooden box in the [[Vatican Museums]] containing earth and rocks from the Holy Land, some tied up in cloth and labelled with their site of origin.  The inside of the top cover has five painted scenes from the New Testament relating to the main sites, or sights, on the pilgrimage route, in similar style to the ampullae, and believed to be made in Palestine in around 600.&lt;ref&gt;Vikan (1982), 18–20; Beckwith, 60; good image [http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07072009-210837/unrestricted/HostetlerBThesis.pdf fig. 22 of this thesis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312012759/http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07072009-210837/unrestricted/HostetlerBThesis.pdf |date=2012-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was long thought that the ampullae reflected the style of art of Palestine itself, and as such they became involved in the intense scholarly debate over "Oriental" influences on Early Medieval art, which preoccupied scholars of the subject in the early decades of the 20th century, and for which the style of [[Syria]] and Palestine was a key battleground.  In his monograph of 1957, which for the first time gave scholars good images of all the Monza and Bobbio ampullae, and an extensive analysis of their iconography, [[André Grabar]] proposed instead that they derived from the style of [[Constantinople]] itself, spread to the provinces by Imperial patronage, which is clearly recorded for the major pilgrimage sites.&lt;ref&gt;Leroy&lt;/ref&gt;  This view has gained considerable influence.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Beckwith, 59&lt;/ref&gt; After the Persians under [[Khosrau II]] took and sacked Jerusalem in 614, and the  [[Muslim conquest]] of the region in the 630s, pilgrimages to the Holy Land sites were greatly reduced, and pilgrim souvenirs with them.&lt;ref&gt;Vikan (1982), 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of the somewhat variant example from Sant Pere de Casseres (see below), which may be later, it is usually assumed that all the Monza-type ampullae predate the Persian sack, and probably come from the late sixth century, a few years before Theodelinda's reign. After a nearly complete gap of three centuries or so, different styles of pilgrimage souvenirs begin to appear from the 10th century, reflecting rather different pilgrimage experiences and customs.

==Queen Theodelinda's gift==
[[File:Syrian - Pilgrim Token from the Shrine of St Symeon - Walters 481939.jpg|thumb|Syrian pilgrim token in clay from the [[Church of Saint Simeon Stylites|shrine of St Symeon]] near [[Aleppo]], 6th century]]
[[Theodelinda]] was a [[Bavaria]]n princess who married [[Authari]], King of the [[Lombards]] in 588.  When he died in 590, she was allowed to choose his cousin [[Agilulf]] as her next husband and the next king. He was baptised, initially as an [[Arian]] like most Lombards, but Theodelinda persuaded him and his son to convert to Catholicism in 603.  Together they founded the cathedral at Monza, and endowed it with many treasures, a collection which has remained unusually intact, and includes the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]] (strictly only on deposit there initially), the [[Late Antique]] [[Poet and Muse diptych]], a [[Gospel book]] and the collection of ampullae. An early inventory survives, although some objects traditionally associated with Theodelinda may actually be made well after her death in 628, when she was buried at Monza.

The collection in the treasury was famous, and later augmented by other royal gifts.  It was taken to [[Avignon]] during the [[Avignon Papacy]] but later returned. However the ampullae were incorporated in the high altar and forgotten until rediscovered in the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Leroy, 320. They were first published in 1794 by Frisi.&lt;/ref&gt; Their identification in the earlier inventories is complicated by the existence of a further set of glass vials, also used for holy oil.  The ''notula'' ("little note"), a very early [[papyrus]] document, now itself regarded as a treasure, records that a cleric called John, during the reign of Pope [[Gregory the Great]] (died 604), transferred (the nature of the transaction, whether a gift from Gregory, or John, or a purchase, is not clear) to Theodelinda small containers with oil that had been in lamps burning before the tombs of saints in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, 98&lt;/ref&gt;  The saints are listed; it seems that in most cases, but not those of Saints Peter and [[Saint Paul|Paul]], the oil was blended from that used in several places. There is some scholarly confusion as to how this list relates to the glass and metal ampullae.&lt;ref&gt;Compare Burrus, 109 and Elsner, 98. The mentions in other works cited here give further variations.&lt;/ref&gt;  The origin of ampullae other than those produced by John is unknown, although scholars are unanimous that, wherever they went afterwards, the metal ampullae had been made in Palestine. Gregory is recorded as presenting gifts to Theodelinda in 603 after the conversion of Agilulf and his son, and also sending holy oil in ampullae.&lt;ref&gt;Letters of Gregory the Great, 701, note f&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bobbio Abbey]] was founded in 613 by the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Irish missionary]] [[Saint Columbanus]] in 613, with land and funds from Theodelinda. The Bobbio ampullae were discovered in the 1920s in the [[crypt]] of the abbey church, and are presumed to have been given by Theodelinda or her family.

==Locations==
Apart from the collections at Monza and Bobbio, other examples include two owned by the [[Staatliche Museen]] of [[Berlin]] and one in the [[Landesmuseum Stuttgart]]. Two examples in the United States, one at [[Dumbarton Oaks]] near [[Washington, D. C.]] and one in the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]], appear to be cast from the same mould.&lt;ref&gt;Dumbarton Oaks&lt;/ref&gt;  There is an example with a ''Crucifixion'' and ''Ascension'' in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] (clear image online).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learn.columbia.edu/treasuresofheaven/relics/Pilgrim-Flask.php Pilgrim Flask, The Cleveland Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

A single example was found in 1952 at the monastery church of Sant Pere de Casseres, near [[Tavèrnoles]] in [[Catalonia]].  As at Monza, it was discovered within the main altar, adapted as a [[reliquary]] for a piece of bone, and near a glass vial similarly used. It is made of an iron alloy, is rather larger than most at 7.5&amp;nbsp;cm high and 5.7&amp;nbsp;cm wide, and has two handles at the neck.  The decoration is a ''Crucifixion'' on the obverse, and [[Greek cross]] on the reverse.&lt;ref&gt;Arad, 59–60&lt;/ref&gt; This may be later than the Monza and Bobbio ampullae by some considerable time.&lt;ref&gt;Arad suggests the 8th to 10th centuries&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Horseshoe Falls, Niagara Frederic Edwin Church.jpg|thumb|The final study for the painting. ''Horseshoe Falls, Niagara'', 1856–57, oil on two pieces of paper, 29.2 × 90.5 cm. [[Olana State Historic Site]]&lt;ref name="h69"/&gt;]]

'''''Niagara''''' is an oil painting by [[Frederic Edwin Church]]. ''Niagara'' was his most important work to date, and confirmed his reputation as the premier American landscape painter of the time.&lt;ref name="olana"/&gt; In his history of Niagara Falls, [[Pierre Berton]] writes, "Of the hundreds of paintings made of Niagara, before Church and after him, this is by common consent the greatest."&lt;ref name="Berton2011"/&gt;

==Background==
The Falls were commonly painted, being such an attraction to landscape artists that, writes John Howat, they were "the most popular, the most often treated, and the tritest single item of subject matter to appear in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century European and American landscape painting".&lt;ref name="h69"&gt;Howat, 69–72&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the public was captivated by the natural wonder of the Falls, considered a landmark of the North American landscape and a major tourist destination. It was the "Honeymoon Capital of the World", and prints of Niagara were given as wedding gifts. In the 1850s, Niagara was the subject of millions of [[stereograph]]s, and its image could be found on wallpaper, china, and lamp shades, among other consumer items.&lt;ref name="raab38"/&gt;  In 1853, a 1600-foot [[moving panorama]] of Niagara Falls was exhibited in New York City.&lt;ref name="olana"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9fTXgbL63XQC&amp;pg=PA69 |title=Treasures from Olana: Landscapes by Frederic Edwin Church |last=Church |first=Frederic Edwin |last2=Avery |first2=Kevin J. |last3=Pataki |first3=George E. |date=2005 |publisher=Cornell University Press |isbn=0801444306 |pages=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For Americans, the Falls symbolized the grandeur and expansionism of the United States. David C. Huntington, whose writing on Church in the 1960s revived interest in the painter, explained how Americans, in an era of spiritual optimism and [[manifest destiny]], would have perceived such a vivid painting of Niagara, with all that it symbolized:

{{quote|Church presented his fellow-men with the "soul" and "spirit" of Niagara, this "most suggestive" of nature's spectacles: this archetype of the universe. ''Niagara'' is the substance of a great American metaphor; indeed, for its original viewers, a certain something more than a metaphor.... Nature and its Bible, the Science of Design, would unfold the transcendent truth of the universe to the New Chosen People in the New World. Nature in the Era of Manifest Destiny was prophecy, and Church as the "interpreter" of Niagara was therefore painting as American prophet.

''Niagara'' is the American's mythical Deluge which washes away the memory of an Old World so that man may live at home in a New World. The painting is an icon of psychic natural purgation and rebirth. Poetically a New World emerges as the waters of a flood subside. The rainbow, sign of the "God of Nature's" covenant with man, transfixes the beholder.... ''Niagara'' is a revelation of the cosmos to each and every man. Before this greatest of American landscapes the self-reliant, democratic American becomes his own prophet: he stands and sees as a New Noah. Thus through the work of art did Mr. Church help his fellow-men to discover themselves in their New World.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Landscapes of Frederic Edwin Church: Vision of an American Era |last=Huntington |first=David C. |date=1966 |publisher=George Braziller |lccn=66-16675 |page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Church studied Niagara Falls extensively leading up to 1857, making dozens of pencil and oil [[study (art)|studies]]. In 1856 Church visited the Falls for probably the fifth time.&lt;ref name="h69"/&gt; His teacher [[Thomas Cole]] had also visited the Falls. A writer in ''Art and Artists in Connecticut'' (1879) reported that the painting itself took about six weeks, and that Church used two similar canvases simultaneously: a "draft" upon which he tested a painting idea, and the final canvas, to which he transferred the results he found satisfactory.&lt;ref name="h69"/&gt;

==Description==
Church's painting is of [[Horseshoe Falls]], the largest and most iconic of Niagara's three waterfalls. With a width of {{convert|2.3|m}}, it is more than twice as wide as it is high. The canvas's unusual proportions allowed him to paint a panoramic view from the Canadian side of the falls; the composition leads the eye laterally. The vantage point was dramatic and unique, leaving behind the "canonical banality" of many other paintings before it,&lt;ref name="met"/&gt; the merely picturesque, and immersing the viewer directly in the scene, as if airborne or even in the water. The lack of a ''[[repoussoir]]'' aids this effect. Before the advent of modern photography, which made such images common, this was a revelation.&lt;ref name="Berton2011"&gt;Berton, 73–77&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Niagara'' is highly naturalistic, more so than Church's previous ''[[The Andes of Ecuador]]'' (1855), and shows the influence of [[John Ruskin]]'s aesthetics on Church.&lt;ref name="avery"/&gt; Church brings the viewer to the lip of the falls, highlighting the impressive drop by painting in streams of water and cloudy mists.&lt;ref name="Revie2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Revie, Linda L. |title=The Niagara Companion: Explorers, Artists, and Writers at the Falls, from Discovery through the Twentieth Century |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tNJ0CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA51 |date=2006 |publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press |isbn=978-0-88920-635-9 |page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only foreground object is a floating tree trunk, which might be confused for a branch but for its roots, providing a sense of scale. The white foam near the trunk has some build-up of paint on a canvas that is otherwise smooth. The foam might suggest that the tree is caught on an unseen rock; there is ambiguity in whether this location is a small respite of stability or highlights the imminent danger of reaching the fall's edge.&lt;ref&gt;Raab, 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Church's extensive study of the falls allowed him to capture the effect of mist and turbulent water with unprecedented realism. The light creates a partial rainbow beyond the precipice, whose arc is strong where the mist is thick, and absent elsewhere, a highly realistic rendering and a technical achievement.&lt;ref name="rain"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kZcCtT1ZeaEC&amp;pg=PA93 |title=The Rainbow Bridge: Rainbows in Art, Myth, and Science |last=Lee |first=Raymond L. |last2=Fraser |first2=Alistair B. |date=2001 |publisher=Penn State Press |isbn=0271019778 |pages=92–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distant on the horizon are a number of buildings, including [[Terrapin Point|Terrapin Tower]], on the platform of which stands a tiny person.&lt;ref&gt;Raab, 25–26&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting accumulated damage over time, requiring Church to repaint some of it in 1886. He re-worked the sky so that it was more unified with the water, "more subservient to the cataract", but felt limited in the changes he could make by the many copies of the popular ''Niagara'' that existed at that point, in engraving and chromolithography.&lt;ref&gt;Raab, 42–43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibition and legacy==
Church developed ''Niagara'' with public exhibitions in mind. Between May 1 and 29, 1857, tens of thousands paid 25 cents to view the painting—which was greatly praised by local critics—in a darkened [[Manhattan]] gallery in which only the painting was illuminated.&lt;ref name="avery"&gt;Avery, 21–22&lt;/ref&gt; Some would spend an hour in front of the painting: "Spectators forgot that they were looking simply at pigment ... The painting became the surrogate of a visit in person to the site."&lt;ref name="hunt"/&gt; Many artists, writers, and politicians reportedly visited the painting's exhibition, including [[Horace Greeley]], [[Henry Ward Beecher]], [[George Bancroft]], [[George Ripley (transcendentalist)|George Ripley]],  [[Charles Anderson Dana]], and [[Fitz James O'Brien]].&lt;ref name="hunt"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Huntington |first=David C. |date=1983 |title=Frederic Church's ''Niagara'': Nature and the Nation's Type |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/40754705 |journal=Texas Studies in Literature and Language |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=100–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over a thousand subscriptions to a planned [[chromolithograph]] were sold; $30 for an [[artist's proof]] and $15 for a print, both in color.&lt;ref name="raab38"&gt;Raab, 38–41&lt;/ref&gt; ''Harper's'' magazine called ''Niagara'' "more widely known and admired in this country than any other picture ever painted in America".&lt;ref&gt;Raab, 30&lt;/ref&gt;  

The painting was shown in England and Scotland in the summer of 1857. After a showing in London, a chromolithograph was made by Day &amp; Son in June, followed by more exhibitions in Glasgow, Manchester, and Liverpool. London's ''[[The Art Journal|Art-Journal]]'' wrote, "No work of its class has ever been more successful: it is truth, obviously and certainly. Considered as a painting, it is a production of rare merit: while admirable as a whole, its parts have been carefully considered and studied; broadly and effectively wrought, yet elaborately finished."&lt;ref name="met"&gt;Metropolitan Museum of Art, 243–246&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="h73"&gt;Howat, 73–74&lt;/ref&gt; Famed art critic [[John Ruskin]] was impressed, as reported by Church's friend [[Bayard Taylor]]: "The exhibitor told me that Ruskin had just been to see it, and that he had found effects in it which he had been waiting for years to find." Ruskin was said to have marvelled at the rainbow, believing at first that the play of light through a window was projected onto the canvas.&lt;ref name="rain"/&gt; In September 1858 ''Niagara'' returned to the United States, where, after another New York showing, it travelled to Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Richmond, and New Orleans.&lt;ref name="raab38"/&gt; ''Cosmopolitan Art Journal'' wrote, "The reputation of this work has greatly increased by its English tour. It is now regarded as the finest painting ever executed by any American artist."&lt;ref name="h73"/&gt; Another exhibition in New York followed. ''Niagara'' was exhibited at the 1867 [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Exposition Universelle]] in Paris, where it won a silver medal&lt;ref name="raab38"/&gt; and improved the European view of American art. ''Harper's Weekly'' wrote, "The European critics declared that the 'Niagara' gave them an entirely new and higher view both of American nature and art.&lt;ref name="rodriguez"&gt;Rodriguez Roque, 42&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Study for "Under Niagara" Frederic Edwin Church.jpg|thumb|This study for ''Under Niagara'' (1862) is similar  in composition to the lithograph of the lost painting.]]

Church's composition was the first painting from the [[Hudson River School]] to be an "instant success".&lt;ref name="rodriguez"/&gt; It was uniquely realistic and "without 'manner'", marking the beginning of a new era for Hudson River artists,&lt;ref name="rodriguez"/&gt;  such as [[Jasper Francis Cropsey]], [[Martin Johnson Heade]], [[John Frederick Kensett]], [[Albert Bierstadt]], and [[Régis François Gignoux]].&lt;ref name="met"/&gt; Heade especially took to ''Niagara'', which may have influenced some of his choices in canvas size. He wrote, "Church's picture ... far exceeds my expectations; &amp; I don't wonder that Ruskin, after looking at it for half an hour, could only utter 'marvelous'. I look upon it as the most wonderful picture I ever saw."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Life and Work of Martin Johnson Heade: A Critical Analysis and Catalogue Raisonné |last=Stebbins |first=Theodore E. |last2=Comey |first2=Janet L. |last3=Heade |first3=Martin Johnson |last4=Quinn |first4=Karen E. |date=2000 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0300081839 |pages=21-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Niagara'' was sold to the New York art dealers and print sellers Williams, Stevens &amp; Williams—where it was first exhibited—for US$4,500 in 1857, including $2,000 for reproduction rights.&lt;ref name="Berton2011"/&gt;  It was acquired at auction in 1861 by the businessman [[John Taylor Johnston]] for US$5,000, and then bought at auction in 1876 by [[William Wilson Corcoran]] for his [[Corcoran Gallery of Art|Gallery]] for $12,500, then a record for a painting by an American artist.&lt;ref name="Berton2011"/&gt; When the Corcoran closed in 2014, its collection was transferred to the [[National Gallery of Art]], also in [[Washington, D.C.]]

Church made two more finished paintings of the Falls. ''Under Niagara'' (1862) is now lost, but survives in lithographs, including an overpainted lithograph at Olana. It was a 4-by-6 foot painting said to be completed in a day.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 61&lt;/ref&gt; The third painting, ''[[Niagara Falls, from the American Side]]'', was made in 1867 and is the largest of Church's paintings by surface area.

'''Patrick Jane''' is a fictional [[Character (arts)|character]] and the [[protagonist]] of the [[CBS]] crime drama ''[[The Mentalist]]'', portrayed by [[Simon Baker]]. Jane is an independent consultant for the [[California Bureau of Investigation (fictional)|California Bureau of Investigation]], and helps by giving advice and insight from his many years as a fake [[psychic]] [[mediumship|medium]]. He uses his keen powers of observation, deduction, and knowledge of [[social engineering (security)|social engineering]] coupled with his [[genius]] to help lead the investigations.

==Character background==
Patrick Jane is a consulting member of the CBI (California Bureau of Investigation) crime fighting unit. He is unconventional and commonly defies police procedure, often acting without apparent empathy for suspects or families suffering losses.
 
His past is revealed slowly through five of the show's seven seasons. The revelations come through [[flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] and Jane's statements. In the episode "[[The Mentalist (season 1)|Throwing Fire]]" it is revealed that Jane was raised by a swindler father who included his young son in his carnival [[psychic]] act, touting Jane as "the boy wonder". Jane never went to school, as revealed in the episode "[[The Mentalist (season 2)|Rose-Colored Glasses]]".

He married Angela Ruskin, who was from a similar background, her family being members of a [[traveling carnival]] and "[[carny|carnival royalty]]". The couple had a daughter, Charlotte. According to The Mentalist Code (2013), Charlotte Jane was named after two films written by the father of [[Bruno Heller]], [[Lukas Heller]]: [[Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte]] and [[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962 film)|Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Daniel, David (2013). ''The Mentalist Code and the Search for Red John''. (1st ed.). Rajanata. {{ISBN|978-1495942228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to working at the CBI, Jane suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] due to guilt over the death of his family. He has kept the incident a secret from his CBI co-workers, and it is not in his records.

Jane uses his [[mentalism|mentalist]] abilities to solve crimes, but his main objective is to find Red John. He has stated that he plans to kill Red John rather than to commit him to legal incarceration, though his direct supervisor, [[Teresa Lisbon]], appears to doubt his sincerity in this regard.

Jane initially joined the CBI one year after the death of his wife and daughter. The season 5 episode "[[The Mentalist (season 5)|Red Dawn]]" revealed Jane originally came to the CBI in an attempt to gain access, as a civilian, to the Red John case files. He was discouraged from doing so, but when assaulted by a then-agent of the CBI, Stephen Hannigan, he was allowed to look at the files out of an attempt to appease him and avoid a lawsuit. He became engaged in a then-current investigation of Lisbon and her team, managed to solve the case using his unique abilities, and as a result was employed as a consultant by then-CBI Head Virgil Minelli.

Two years after the events of "Red John", Jane resides in an unnamed Spanish-speaking island, eventually agreeing to return to the U.S. as a consultant for the FBI in exchange for his charges being dropped, on the condition that Lisbon works with him.

==Relationship with Red John==
Jane has suggested on a number of occasions that he considers Red John's death or capture to be a higher priority than his own life. In turn, Red John appears to hold a similar obsession with Jane, to the point of risking capture for the purpose of observing him. In the episode "[[The Mentalist (season 2)|His Red Right Hand]]", he is described as being similar to Jane in his ability to "see through people". Red John has a CBI team murdered with help from a mole on the inside, just so he can have Jane back on his case.

During the second season finale, Jane and Red John finally meet. However, Jane is unable to see Red John's face because it is hidden by a rubber mask, and Jane is tied to a chair. Ironically, Red John saves Jane from three students who have committed Red John [[copycat crime]]s and are about to kill Jane.

At the end of the third season finale, Jane meets a man whom he believes is Red John. During their conversation, "Red John" encourages Jane to forget about him, and says that seeking vengeance is a waste of his valuable life. Patrick asks if he is the real Red John, to which the man gives detailed comments about Patrick's wife and daughter. When "Red John" attempts to walk away after their brief talk, Jane shoots him with a handgun, then sits down and waits to be arrested. It is revealed in season 4 that the man Jane shot was an imposter, and Red John remains at large.

In the fourth season finale, Red John extends a hand of friendship to a distraught and derelict Jane, believing that Jane has lost all hope and has lost his way in life.  Jane, however, has contrived his own nervous breakdown in order to draw out his adversary. Jane meets with Red John inside a limousine, unable to see his face. Red John proposes his offer for friendship yet again, but Jane replies, "Go to hell". Later, the FBI closes in on the vehicle, arresting Red John's friend Lorelei Martins, but discovering Red John was never in the limousine and was communicating via a [[burner phone]] attached to the kidnapped Luther Wainright, who is inadvertently killed.

In season 5, Jane becomes determined to discover Red John's identity. In episode 16, he reveals that he will do anything to get to Red John. In episode 8, Lorelei Martins accidentally reveals to Jane that he has already shaken hands with Red John. Although Jane doesn't identify Red John in season 5, in the finale, in a pre-mortem video, Red John delivers a message via the now dead Lorelei Martins. This video reveals the final seven Red John suspects and predicted how Jane would come across the video nearly two months after its filming; having done that, she reveals Red John's prediction of Jane's suspect list, which matches Jane's actual list exactly.

In season 6 of the series, Jane finally tracks down Red John and, in a gambit exploiting Red John's fear of birds, manages to shoot him. Though Red John briefly gets away, Jane ultimately apprehends him. To go through with his revenge, he strangles Red John to death.

A symbolic relationship also exists between the two. They represent [[The Tyger]] and [[The Lamb]] by [[William Blake]]. They are a part of a "fearful symmetry" that expresses itself in the actual drama of the series and in a secret code that presents itself covertly throughout the series.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Relationship with Teresa Lisbon==
Since the beginning of the show, Jane is shown to care deeply about Lisbon, who is not only his supervisor, but, in the final season, his eventual lover. Throughout the series they are shown to have a very close relationship and trust each other. Bruno Heller has stated that some people interpret the relationship between the two characters as romantic while others view it merely as a brother-sister type of bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Benson|first=Jim|title=The Mentalist Bruno Heller Radio Interview about Simon Baker and Robin Tunney (Lisbon and Jane)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LGPEiA8BXc|publisher=Youtube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sixth season, Lisbon gets engaged to FBI agent Marcus Pike, which causes Jane to realize his true feelings for her. In the season finale, "Blue Bird," Patrick openly admits his love for Teresa and at the end of the episode, they finally kiss. Lisbon consequently breaks off her engagement to Pike.

In the seventh season of "The Mentalist," Jane and Lisbon start a romantic relationship. However, at Teresa's request, they keep their love affair secret from their team members.

In the series finale, White Orchids, Jane proposes to Lisbon and she tearfully accepts. In a simple ceremony, Patrick and Teresa exchange vows in front of family and friends, on the land Jane has purchased for their future home. At the end of the episode, Teresa turns to Patrick and says, "There's something I need to tell you". Patrick looks down to see Teresa's hand on her belly. He is rapt with joy as Teresa confirms she is pregnant with the newlyweds' first child together.

==Appearance and personality==

===Personal style===
Jane characteristically wears a three-piece suit with no tie (though in flashback episodes, pre-CBI, he does wear the tie), and the same brown, leather shoes. His wearing of the suit with the vest has been explained by the show's creator, Bruno Heller, as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bruno Heller Q &amp; A: "The Mentalist" |url=http://gointothestory.blcklst.com/2008/11/bruno-heller-q-mentalist.html |first=Scott |last=Myers |date=2008-11-29 |accessdate=2013-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"The thinking is these were the suits he used to wear as a mentalist and he would have them dry cleaned and pressed. Now he gets them out of the bottom of the cupboard. It's also a magician thing. They wear vests because they need to be able to hide things.}}

Jane wears the same brown, scuffed leather shoes in each episode. In the episode "[[The Mentalist (season 5)|Not One Red Cent]]" in season 5, he finally has them re-soled.

Jane drives a pristine condition Citroën [[Citroën DS|DS 21 Pallas]].

Midway through season 6, and after the death of Red John, Jane's appearance changes. He stops wearing his characteristic vests, though he wears battered suits and his scruffy shoes. Also, he changes his vehicle to the 1985 [[Airstream]] 270.

In the fourth episode of season 7, Jane decides to wear the vest again and continues wearing it until the end of the series.

===Skepticism and abilities===
Jane professes disbelief in anything in subject areas of [[paranormal]] or [[supernatural]], and often insists "there is no such thing as a psychic". He is often seen to employ [[cold reading]], [[hot reading]], and an expertise in [[kinesics]] such as [[muscle reading]] and [[paralanguage]], often as a means to discern clues but also to manipulate suspects into confessing their crimes or otherwise revealing themselves as guilty. At times, such as when he feels the wrist of suspects to gauge their pulse or through his near-instantaneous discernment of [[microexpressions]], [[proteans (body language)|proteans]] or [[calypsis|calypses]], and the insight that subjects have looks showing "guilt", his powers seem exaggerated and almost [[superhuman]].

He has knowledge of [[hypnosis]] and has been seen to employ it from time to time, though Lisbon insists that use of hypnotism on suspects or witnesses is illegal and can cause cases to be thrown out of court. He is adept at [[legerdemain]] including a presumably undetectable skill at [[pickpocketing]]. He professes to maintain a mental "[[method of loci|memory palace]]" and claims extraordinary powers of recollection. In the season 5 episode "[[The Mentalist (season 5)|Red Barn]]" he confides in Lisbon that in his attempt to identify Red John (whom he has been told he has met personally), he has remembered the names of the 2,164 people he has met since the death of his family.

Though Jane himself seems proficient at reading body language, he nevertheless expresses skepticism for more [[empirical]] means of evaluating or "[[criminal profiling|profiling]]" suspects, such as his doubt of the approach of Agent Montague in the episode "[[The Mentalist (season 3)|Bloodhound]]".

It has not been revealed to what degree Jane, raised in a carnival environment, has been formally educated, although he has stated he never attended high school. He nevertheless has exhibited throughout the series many qualities of a [[polymath]], including refined knowledge of art, food, wine, literature, and music. He also demonstrates considerable skill at [[chess]] (in the episode [[The Mentalist (season 2)|18-5-4]] ), and is an accomplished [[card sharp]]. He may also be a pool shark, as he makes an impressive shot in [[The Mentalist (season 2)|Aingavite Baa]]. In [[The Mentalist (season 1)|Miss Red]], he demonstrates his skill at cheating with dice, in the course of a [[backgammon]] game. He also creates elaborate [[sandcastle]]s ([[The Mentalist (season 1)|Red Tide]]) and plays [[pinball]] extremely well ([[The Mentalist (season 1)|Red Sauce]]).

===Personality===
Jane's personality has undergone a dramatic change since the death of his family. Though the season 2 episode "[[The Mentalist (season 2)|Throwing Fire]]" shows a teenage Jane tutored by an unscrupulous father, the young Jane seems to have nevertheless had somewhat of a conscience. However, in his adult life as a "mentalist", he has been shown to have manipulated and conned numerous people for profit. In his mentalist heyday, this brought him both a great deal of money (enough to buy a house in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]]) and a certain amount of fame (his photo can be seen gracing the cover of framed magazines in his home at the time). The season 4 episode "[[The Mentalist (season 4)|Fugue in Red]]", where Jane partially loses his memory as a result of a near drowning, reveals to some degree the selfishness and amorality of the pre-CBI Jane. This prompts fellow CBI agent [[Kimball Cho]] ([[Tim Kang]]) to remark to his CBI colleagues, "Don't take this the wrong way, but the death of Jane's family made him a better person."

Jane is [[camera shy]], and often expresses reluctance to be interviewed or otherwise filmed, presumably another change in personality since his heyday as a television mentalist. He also consciously avoids situations where he will be thanked (e.g. by a murder victim's family when the culprit is apprehended) or made the center of attention.

Jane has been shown to have an affinity for and unusually good rapport with children. On multiple occasions he befriends them and addresses them with empathy. Conversely, he has little regard for figures of authority, and often expresses himself to such individuals brusquely or even rudely.

Despite his obsession with finding Red John and his anguish and guilt over the loss of his family, Jane occasionally behaves in a spontaneous, even lighthearted fashion, expressing delight in simple pleasures such as open air, music, and natural beauty. Heller has stated, of Jane's temperament: "(Jane) is on the surface a happy person and kind of graceful and light. The idea is to show that grace and lightness is an act of heroism; it's not simple-minded happiness. It's a conscious decision he is making to live his life positively."&lt;ref name="darker side"&gt;{{cite web |title='Mentalist' finale: Creator talks Red John reveal, Jane going darker next season |first=James |last=Hibberd |url=http://the-mentalist.frenchboard.com/t234-bruno-heller-interviews |date=2012-05-18 |accessdate=2013-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jane appears to have a strong aversion to violence. When threatened or attacked, his first response is always to run away or hide behind his colleagues, and when he is actually struck or beaten he does not retaliate. Despite this apparent pacifism, he does use violence when he considers it absolutely necessary. As of season 6, Jane has killed four men. Jane shoots the first, police officer Dumar Hardy, with a shotgun in the episode "[[The Mentalist (season 1)|Red John's Footsteps]]", in order to save Lisbon's life. He throws down the shotgun immediately afterward, visibly shocked by his actions. In the season three finale "[[Strawberries and Cream (The Mentalist)|Strawberries and Cream Part II]]" Jane shoots with a pistol a man he believes to be Red John himself, though it is later revealed the man's name was Timothy Carter and he was merely an impersonator. In the episode "Red John" (season 6), Jane finally exacts his revenge on Red John, shooting him with a pistol before chasing him down and strangling him to death.  In the process he kills Oscar Cordero, Red John's henchman, by shooting him as he rushes into the church to save Red John.

Jane has expressed a dislike of coffee, but drinks tea in nearly every episode. He appears to have basic computer literacy but typically expresses no interest in using such technology. In one episode, he asks Grace Van Pelt to "bigify" something on the computer, meaning to zoom in.

==Reception==

Simon Baker has been nominated for several awards for his portrayal of Jane, including the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor – Drama Series]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=61st Primetime Emmy Awards Nominations |publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]] |url=http://www.emmys.tv/sites/emmys.tv/files/61stemmys_noms_1.pdf |accessdate=2011-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama]], and a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 16th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards |publisher=[[Screen Actors Guild]] |url=http://www.sagawards.org/awards/nominees-and-recipients/16th-annual-screen-actors-guild-awards |accessdate=2011-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick Jane was also included in ''[[TV Guide]]''{{'}}s list of "TV's Sexiest Crime Fighters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TV's Sexiest Crime Fighters |url=http://www.tvguide.com/special/summer-tv/PhotoGallery/TVs-Sexiest-Crime-1034736/1034738 |work=[[TV Guide]] |accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Redirect|Patron||Patron (disambiguation)}}

'''Patronage''' is the support, encouragement, privilege, or financial aid that an organization or individual bestows to another. In the history of art, '''arts patronage''' refers to the support that kings, popes, and the wealthy have provided to artists such as musicians, painters, and sculptors. It can also refer to the right of bestowing offices or [[Benefice|church benefices]], the business given to a store by a regular customer, and the [[patron saint|guardianship of saints]]. The word "patron" derives from the {{lang-la|patronus}} ("patron"), one who gives benefits to his clients (see [[Patronage in ancient Rome]]).

In some countries the term is used to describe '''political patronage''', which is the use of state resources to reward individuals for their electoral support. Some patronage systems are legal, as in the Canadian tradition of the Prime Minister to appoint [[Senate of Canada|senators]] and the heads of a number of commissions and agencies; in many cases, these appointments go to people who have supported the political party of the Prime Minister. As well, the term may refer to a type of [[Political corruption|corruption]] or favoritism in which a party in power rewards groups, families, ethnicities for their electoral support using illegal gifts or fraudulently awarded appointments or government contracts.&lt;ref&gt;For a recent study of political patronage in the People's Republic of China, see Hillman, Ben. [http://www.sup.org/book.cgi?id=18534 ''Patronage and Power: Local State Networks and Party-state Resilience in Rural China''] [[Stanford University Press]], 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts==

From the [[Ancient history|ancient world]] onward, patronage of the [[arts]] was important in [[art history]]. It is known in greatest detail in reference to [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] Europe, though patronage can also be traced in [[History of Japan|feudal Japan]], the traditional [[Southeast Asia]]n kingdoms, and elsewhere—art patronage tended to arise wherever a [[royal family|royal]] or [[Empire|imperial]] system and an [[aristocracy]] dominated a society and controlled a significant share of resources. [[Samuel Johnson]] defined a patron as "one who looks with unconcern on a man struggling for life in the water, and, when he has reached ground, encumbers him with help".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Michael Rosenthal, ''Constable'', London: Thames and  Hudson, 1987, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rulers, nobles and very wealthy people used patronage of the arts to endorse their political ambitions, social positions, and prestige. That is, patrons operated as [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]]s. Most languages other than English still use the term ''mecenate'', derived from the name of [[Gaius Maecenas]], generous friend and adviser to the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Augustus]]. Some patrons, such as the [[Medici]] of [[Florence]], used artistic patronage to "cleanse" wealth that was perceived as ill-gotten through [[usury]]. Art patronage was especially important in the creation of [[religious art]]. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] and later [[Protestantism|Protestant]] groups sponsored art and [[architecture]], as seen in [[Church (building)|churches]], [[cathedral]]s, [[painting]], [[sculpture]] and [[handicraft]]s.

While sponsorship of artists and the [[commission (art)|commissioning]] of artwork is the best-known aspect of the patronage system, other disciplines also benefited from patronage, including those who studied [[natural philosophy]] ([[History of science|pre-modern]] [[science]]), [[music]]ians, [[literature|writers]], [[philosophy|philosophers]], [[alchemy|alchemists]], [[astrology|astrologers]], and other [[scholar]]s. Artists as diverse and important as [[Chrétien de Troyes]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]], [[William Shakespeare]], and [[Ben Jonson]] all sought and enjoyed the support of noble or ecclesiastical patrons.&lt;ref&gt;F. W. Kent et al., eds.,''Patronage, Art, and Society in Renaissance Italy,'' Oxford, [[Oxford University Press]], 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cedric C. Brown, ''Patronage, Politics, and Literary traditions in England, 1558–1658,'' Detroit, Wayne State University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Figures as late as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] also participated in the system to some degree; it was only with the rise of bourgeois and capitalist social forms in the middle 19th century that European culture moved away from its patronage system to the more publicly supported system of museums, theaters, mass audiences and mass consumption that is familiar in the contemporary world.    
  
This kind of system continues across many fields of the [[arts]]. Though the nature of the sponsors has changed—from churches to charitable foundations, and from aristocrats to plutocrats—the term ''patronage'' has a more neutral [[connotation]] than in politics. It may simply refer to direct support (often financial) of an artist, for example by [[Grant (money)|grants]]. In the latter part of the 20th century, the academic sub-discipline of patronage studies began to evolve, in recognition of the important and often neglected role that the phenomenon of patronage had played in the cultural life of previous centuries.

==Charity==
Charitable and other non-profit making organisations often seek an influential figurehead to act as patron. The relationship often does not involve money. As well as conferring credibility, these people can use their contacts and charisma to assist the organisation to raise funds or to affect government policy.  The [[British Royal Family]] are especially prolific in this respect, devoting a large proportion of their time to a wide range of causes.&lt;ref name="Royal Patronage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/CharitiesandPatronages/Suggesting%20a%20Patronage/Suggesting%20a%20Patronage.aspx|title=British Monarchy website, London.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Custom]] --&gt;
Sometimes consumers support smaller or local businesses or corporations out of loyalty even if less expensive options exist. Their regular custom is referred to as 'patronage'.  Patronage may entitle members of a [[cooperative]] to a share of the surplus or profit generated by the co-op, called a ''[[patronage refund]]''.  This refund is a form of [[dividend]].

==Ecclesiastical==
===Anglican===
:''See main article [[Parish#England|Parish]]''
In the [[Church of England]], ''patronage'' is the commonly used term for the right to present a candidate to a benefice.

===Catholic===

====Patronage of Our Lady====
The [[liturgical feast]] of the Patronage of Our Lady was first permitted by [[decree (canon law)|Decree]] of the [[Sacred Congregation of Rites]] on 6 May 1679, for all the ecclesiastical provinces of [[Spain]], in memory of the victories obtained over the Saracens, heretics and other enemies from the sixth century to the reign of [[Philip IV of Spain]]. Pope [[Benedict XII]] ordered it to be kept in the [[Papal States]] on the third Sunday of November. To other places it is granted, on request, for some Sunday in November, to be designated by the [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]]. In many places the feast of the Patronage is held with an additional Marian title of '''Queen of All Saints, of Mercy, Mother of Graces'''. The Office is taken entirely from the Common of the Blessed Virgin, and the Mass is the "Salve sancta parens".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11560b.htm Mershman, Francis. "Feast of the Patronage of Our Lady." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 11 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presbyterian===
The [[Church Patronage (Scotland) Act 1711]], (in force until 1874) resulted in multiple [[First Secession|secessions]] from the [[Church of Scotland]], including the [[First Secession|secession of 1733]], which led to the formation of the Associate Presbytery, the [[Second Secession|secession of 1761]], which led to the formation of the [[Relief Church]], and the [[Disruption of 1843]], which led to the formation of the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)|Free Church of Scotland]].

==Journalism==
While most news companies, particularly in North America are funded through [[advertising]] revenue,&lt;ref name="Silicon Valley Watcher"&gt;{{cite web| title =Pew: Impact Of Billionaire Funded Journalism Is Tiny| url =http://www.siliconvalleywatcher.com/mt/archives/2014/03/pew_impact_of_billion.php|website=Silicon Valley Watcher|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; secondary funding sources include audience members and philanthropists who donate to for-profit and non-profit organizations.

==Politics==
[[Political leader]]s have at their disposal a great deal of patronage, in the sense that they make decisions on the appointment of [[official]]s inside and outside government (for example on [[quango]]s in the UK). Patronage is therefore a recognized  power of the [[executive (government)|executive branch]]. In most countries the executive has the right to make many appointments, some of which may be lucrative (see also [[sinecure]]s). In some [[Democracy|democracies]], high-level appointments are reviewed or approved by the [[legislature]] (as in the [[advice and consent]] of the [[United States Senate]]); in other countries, such as those using the [[Westminster system]], this is not the case. Other types of political patronage may violate the laws or ethics codes, such as when political leaders engage in [[nepotism]] (hiring family members) and [[cronyism]] such as fraudulently awarding non-competitive government contracts to friends or relatives or pressuring the public service to hire an unqualified family member or friend.

===Philippines===

Political patronage, also known as "''[[Padrino System]]''" also a slang call as ''balimbing'' ([[carambola|starfruit]]), in the Philippines, has been the source of many controversies and corruption.  It has been an [[open secret]] that one cannot join the [[Politics of the Philippines|political arena of the Philippines]] without mastery of the Padrino System. From the lowest [[Barangay]] official, to the [[President of the Philippines|President of the Republic]], it is expected that one gains political debts and dispenses political favor to advance one's career or gain influence, if not wealth.

===Russia===
After [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leader [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s retirement from politics in March 1923 following a stroke, a power struggle began between [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Soviet Premier]] [[Alexei Rykov]], [[Pravda]] editor [[Nikolai Bukharin]], [[Profintern]] leader [[Mikhail Tomsky]], [[Red Army]] founder [[Leon Trotsky]], former Premier [[Lev Kamenev]], [[Comintern]] leader [[Grigory Zinoviev]], and [[General Secretary of the CPSU|General Secretary]] [[Joseph Stalin]]. Stalin used patronage to appoint many Stalinist delegates (such as [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], [[Lazar Kaganovich]], [[Grigory Ordzhonikidze]], and [[Mikhail Kalinin]]) to the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party]] [[Politburo of the CPSU|Politburo]] and [[Sovnarkom]] in order to sway the votes in his favour, making Stalin the effective leader of the country by 1929.

===South Africa===
During 2012, the African National Congress (ANC) mayor of Beaufort West in the Western Cape Province wrote a letter which openly and illegally solicited funds from the Construction Education and Training Authority for the ANC's 2016 election campaign. This episode, amongst many others including instances revolving around president Jacob Zuma, revealed how the African National Congress as ruling political party utilized patronage to reward supporters and strengthen the leading faction of the party's control over governmental institutions.&lt;ref name="dailymaveric"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2016-02-02-analysis-power-patronage-and-gatekeeper-politics-in-the-time-of-truman-prince/#.VrGtyctf0iQ |title=Power, patronage and gatekeeper politics in the time of Truman Prince|newspaper=Daily Maverick|location= Johannesburg|date= 3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main|Spoils system}}
In the [[United States]] during the [[Gilded Age]], patronage became a controversial issue. [[Tammany Hall|Tammany]] boss [[William M. Tweed]] was an American politician who ran what is considered now to have been one of the most corrupt political machines in the country's history. Tweed and his cronies ruled for a brief time with absolute power over the city and state of New York. At the height of his influence, Tweed was the third-largest landowner in [[New York City]], a director of the [[Erie Railway]], the [[Tenth National Bank]], and the New-York Printing Company, as well as proprietor of the [[Metropolitan Hotel (New York City)|Metropolitan Hotel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Boss Tweed |last=Ackerman |first=Kenneth D. |year=2005 |publisher=Carrol &amp; Graf Publishers |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7867-1686-9 |page=2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nzMoAc-iew0C&amp;dq=boss+tweed&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times he was a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]], the New York City Board of Advisors, and the [[New York State Senate]]. In 1873, Tweed was convicted for diverting between $40 million and $200 million of public monies.&lt;ref name="gotham"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gothamgazette.com/article//20050704/202/1467 |title=Boss Tweed |newspaper=Gotham Gazette |location=New York |date=4 July 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427090825/http://www.gothamgazette.com/article//20030602/4/408 |archivedate=2007-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six months after [[James Garfield]] became [[President of the United States|president]] in 1881,  [[Charles J. Guiteau]], a disappointed office-seeker, assassinated him. To prevent further political violence and to assuage public outrage, Congress passed the [[Pendleton Act]] in 1883, which set up the [[United States Civil Service Commission|Civil Service Commission]]. Henceforth, applicants for most federal government jobs would have to pass an examination. Federal politicians' influence over bureaucratic appointments waned, and patronage declined as a national political issue.

Beginning in 1969, a Supreme Court case in Chicago, [[Michael L. Shakman v. Democratic Organization of Cook County]], occurred involving political patronage and its constitutionality.  Shakman claimed that much of the patronage going on in Chicago politics was unlawful on the grounds of the first and fourteenth amendments.  Through a series of legal battle and negotiations, the two parties agreed upon [[Shakman Decrees|The Shakman Decrees]].  Under these decrees it was declared that the employment status of most public employees could not be affected positively or negatively based on political allegiance, with exceptions for politically inclined positions.  The case is still in negotiation today, as there are points yet to be decided.&lt;ref name=chic&gt;{{cite web| title =Shakman Decrees| website=Encyclopedia of Chicago| url =http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1138.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cook&gt;{{cite web| title =The Shakman Decrees| website =Cook FP Shakman| url =http://www.cookfpshakman.com/background.html| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20130826024721/http://cookfpshakman.com/background.html| archivedate =2013-08-26| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=leagle&gt;{{cite web| title =SHAKMAN v. DEMOCRATIC ORGANIZATION OF COOK CTY| website=Leagle| url =http://www.leagle.com/decision/19791796481FSupp1315_11605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political patronage is not always considered corrupt. In the United States, the U.S. Constitution provides the president with the power to appoint individuals to government positions. He or she also may appoint personal advisers without congressional approval. Not surprisingly, these individuals tend to be supporters of the president. Similarly, at the state and local levels, governors and mayors retain appointments powers. Some scholars have argued that patronage may be used for laudable purposes, such as the "recognition" of minority communities through the appointment of their members to a high-profile positions. Bearfield has argued that patronage be used for four general purposes: create or strengthen a political organization; achieve democratic or egalitarian goals; bridge political divisions and create coalitions; and to alter the existing patronage system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Science==
There are historical examples where the noble classes financed scientific pursuits.

Many [[Barmakids]] were patrons of the sciences, which greatly helped the propagation of Indian science and scholarship from the neighbouring [[Academy of Gundishapur]] into the Arabic world. They patronized scholars such as [[Gebir]] and [[Jabril ibn Bukhtishu]]. They are also credited with the establishment of the first [[paper mill]] in Baghdad. The power of the Barmakids in those times is reflected in ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]''; the vizier Ja'far appears in several stories, as well as a tale that gave rise to the expression "Barmecide feast".

{{quote|We know of Yahya b Khalid al Barmaki (805) as a patron of physicians and, specifically, of the translation of Hindu medical works into both Arabic and Persian. In all likelihood however, his activity took place in the orbit of the caliphal court in Iraq, where at the behest of Harun al Rashid (786 -809), such books were translated into Arabic. Thus Khurasan and Transoxania were effectively bypassed in this transfer of learning from India to Islam, even though, undeniably the Barmakis cultural outlook owed something to their land of origin, northern Afghanistan, and Yahya al Barmaki's interest in medicine may have derived from no longer identifiable family tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Civilizations of Central Asia|volume=4, Part 2 |authors=Bosworth, C. E. Bosworth&amp; Asimov, M.S.| page =300}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Sports==
In the same manner as commercial patronage, those who attend a sporting event may be referred to as patrons, though the usage in much of the world is now considered archaic—with some notable exceptions.  Those who attend the [[Masters Tournament]], one of the four major championship of professional [[golf]], are still traditionally referred to as "patrons," largely at the insistence of the [[Augusta National Golf Club]]. This insistence is occasionally made fun of by [[sportswriter]]s and other media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.golf.com/golf/tours_news/article/0,28136,1607332,00.html Davis, Seth: The difference between patrons and fans, Golf.com, April 6 2007.]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015081922/http://www.golf.com/golf/tours_news/article/0%2C28136%2C1607332%2C00.html |date=October 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[polo]], a "patron" is a person who puts together a team by hiring one or more professionals. The rest of the team may be amateurs, often including the patron himself (or, increasingly, herself).

Also, people who attend [[hurling]] or [[Gaelic football]] games organised by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] are referred to as patrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''''Philosophy and Real Politics''''' is a 2008 book by British philosopher and scholar [[Raymond Geuss]] whose main subject is the relationship between [[politics]] and human needs. The book is an expansion of a lecture given at the [[University of Athens]] in April 2007 under the title '[[Lenin]], [[John Rawls|Rawls]] and [[Political Philosophy]]'. The book has been regarded as a remarkable contribution to the [[social sciences]] due to its author's rejection of the popular ''politics as [[applied ethics]]'' approach in the current philosophical and political landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alasdair MacIntyre]] - Review of the book at [http://press.princeton.edu/catalogs/polisci08text.pdf Princeton]&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Geuss argues that a dried and disembodied view of politics is the result of certain western philosophical traditions. Geuss points out that the recent and ongoing [[social conflict]]s call into question whether politics can be reduced to the realm of ethics without previously taking into account the needs, motivations and goals behind people's actions.

==Part 1: Realism==
The first part of the book deals with what Geuss calls the 'realist approach to political philosophy'. According to him, since [[Hobbes]] this approach has been persistent among [[political science|political scientists]] but it tends to overlook the fact that historical and geographical differences among societies and cultures play a major role in the concepts of '[[Social order|order]]' and 'intolerable [[civil disorder|disorder]]'. Geuss notes that nowadays the freedom to own private [[firearm]]s is generally rejected in western European societies, while in the United States this is something considered natural. The way a given society adopts cultural and [[behavioural]] traits may be completely different from, and sometimes, opposed to, another; leading to conflicts and frictions that are perfectly supported by either side but incomprehensible to third parties.

== Part 2: Failures of Realism ==
Part two is devoted to the failures of the realist approach in political philosophy. The author discusses a variety of concepts such as [[social equality|equality]], [[Social justice|fairness]], [[ignorance]] and [[impartiality]]. Using many examples from history ([[William Morris]]' utopias, [[Kantian]] philosophy) and everyday social life, Geuss concludes that those concepts are subject to many conditions and a closer inspection is needed in order to overcome their apparent universality. Then, politics is not a framework of theories, Geuss argues, but more like a skill or a craft that needs to be practised and improved through critical inspection.

The '''Romanian Athenaeum''' ({{lang-ro|Ateneul Român}}) is a [[concert hall]] in the center of [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]] and a landmark of the Romanian capital city. Opened in 1888, the ornate, domed, circular building is the city's main concert hall and home of the [[George Enescu Philharmonic Orchestra|"George Enescu" Philharmonic]] and of the [[George Enescu]] annual international music festival.

== History ==

In 1865, cultural and scientific personalities such as [[Constantin Esarcu]], [[V. A. Urechia]], and [[Nicolae Creţulescu]] founded the Romanian Atheneum Cultural Society.  To serve its purposes, the Romanian Athenaeum, a building dedicated to art and science, would be erected in Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fge.org.ro/ateneul-roman/ The Romanian Athenaeum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107042923/http://fge.org.ro/ateneul-roman/ |date=2008-01-07 }} on the official site of the George Enescu Philarmonic&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was designed by the [[France|French]] architect [[Albert Galleron]], built on a property that had belonged to the [[Văcărescu family]] and inaugurated in 1888, although work continued until 1897.  A portion of the construction funds was raised by public subscription in a 28-year-long effort, of which the slogan is still remembered today: "Donate one ''[[Romanian leu|leu]]'' for the ''Ateneu''!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hotel-bucuresti.com/blog/2015/05/14/ateneul-roman-un-simbol-al-culturii-romanesti/ Page about the Romanian Athenaeum] provides a detailed description of the scenes from Romanian history portrayed in the frescoes of the Atheneum. {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 29, 1919, the Atheneum was the site of the conference of leading Romanians who voted to ratify the unification of [[Bessarabia]], [[Transylvania]], and [[Bukovina]] with the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]] to constitute [[Greater Romania]].

Extensive reconstruction and restoration work has been conducted in 1992 by a Romanian construction company and restoration painter Silviu Petrescu, saving the building from collapse.  The 9 million Euro required were contributed in equal shares by the government and the [[Council of Europe|Council of Europe Development Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constructiv.ro/arhiva/2003/06_iunie/curent_cuprins1.html 1992 reconstruction work] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041107040331/http://www.constructiv.ro/arhiva/2003/06_iunie/curent_cuprins1.html |date=2004-11-07 }} includes an excellent image of the inside of the dome during construction. {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Building and facilities ==

[[File:Flickr - fusion-of-horizons - Ateneul Român (4).jpg|300px|thumb|right|Romanian Athenaeum]]
The overall style is [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]], with some more [[Romanticism|romantic]] touches.  In front of the building there is a small park and a statue of Romanian poet [[Mihai Eminescu]].

Inside, the ground floor hosts an ornate conference hall as large as the [[auditorium]] above; the auditorium seats 600 in the stalls and another 52 in loge seating.

A 75-sqm long and 3-m wide [[fresco]] by [[Costin Petrescu (painter)|Costin Petrescu]] decorates the inside of the circular wall of the concert hall.  Painted using the ''al fresco'' technique, the piece depicts the most important moments of Romanian history, starting with the conquest of [[Dacia]] by Roman emperor [[Trajan]] and ending with the realization of [[Greater Romania]] in 1918.

Recognized as a symbol of Romanian culture, the building has been inscribed in 2007 on the list of the [[European Heritage Label|Label of European Heritage]] sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nato.mae.ro/index.php?lang=en&amp;id=31&amp;s=23698&amp;arhiva=true Romanian Athenaeum awarded Label of European Heritage], Romania's Permanent Delegation to NATO&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides selling character goods, Sanrio takes part in movie production and publishing. They own the rights to both the [[Peanuts]] and [[Mr. Men]] characters in Japan. Their [[animatronics]] branch, called Kokoro Company, Ltd. ("Kokoro" being Japanese for "heart"), is best known for the [[Actroid]] android. They participate in the fast food industry, running a franchise of [[KFC]] in [[Saitama Prefecture|Saitama]].

==History==
'''Sanrio''' was founded by [[Shintaro Tsuji]] as the Yamanashi Silk Company in 1960, using 1 million yen in capital. In 1962, Tsuji expanded his enterprise from silk to rubber sandals with flowers painted on them.&lt;ref name="Belson"&gt;Belson, K. (2003). Asia times online. The cat who turned kawaii into cash. Retrieved May 19, 2011, from http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Japan/EL13Dh01.html&lt;/ref&gt; Tsuji noted the profits gained by simply adding a cute design to the sandals and hired cartoonists to design cute characters for his merchandise in response.&lt;ref name="Belson" /&gt; In 1973 the company was officially established under the name "Sanrio". The company's European website says the name comes from the Spanish words ''san'' (holy) and ''río'' (river.)&lt;ref name="Europe" /&gt; The book {{nihongo|''korega Sanrio no himitsu desu''|これがサンリオの秘密です}} or ''This is the Sanrio Company Secret'' gives another origin of the name.&lt;ref name="これがサンリオの秘密です" /&gt; According to this book, Tsuji, Sanrio's founder, said that {{nihongo|Yamanashi|山梨}}, part of the company's former name, has an alternative [[on'yomi]] reading of ''sanri''.  The remaining ''o'' was added from the {{nihongo|ou|オウ}} sound people make when they are excited.&lt;ref name="これがサンリオの秘密です"&gt;これがサンリオの秘密です (1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

The company produced a line of character merchandise around gift-giving occasions.&lt;ref name="Europe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanrioeurope.com/about.asp |title=Sanrio Europe |accessdate=2009-09-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001063109/http://www.sanrioeurope.com/about.asp |archivedate=October 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hello Kitty was added to the lineup of early Sanrio characters in 1974 and the first related merchandise was released the following year. The popular feline whose mouth is usually invisible has had both peaks and drops in sales over the years, but always has been the highest contributor to Sanrio's sales. Other notably popular characters through the years have been ''[[Little Twin Stars|The Little Twin Stars]]'' (created by Mr. Tsuji himself), ''[[List of Sanrio characters#My Melody|My Melody]]'', ''[[Keroppi]]'', ''[[List of Sanrio characters#Tuxedo Sam|Tuxedo Sam]]'', ''[[Badtz-Maru]]'', ''[[Chococat]]'', ''[[Cinnamoroll]]'', ''[[Sugarbunnies]]'', ''[[Jewelpet]]'' and ''[[Wish me mell]]''. Sanrio constantly adds new characters to its lineup. Specific characters are rotated in and out of active production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanrio.com/smallgift/more_characters/?chr=a-f Characters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223050502/http://www.sanrio.com/smallgift/more_characters/?chr=a-f |date=2010-12-23 }} - Sanrio.com&lt;/ref&gt; For a short time, [[Osamu Tezuka]]'s baby unicorn character [[Unico]], who starred in two feature-length anime movies in the early 1980s, was also part of the Sanrio empire; however, the rights to Unico shifted to Osamu Tezuka's own company after Tezuka's death in 1989.

In late 2003, Sanrio won the "Top Brand with a Conscience" award from the Medinge Group of Sweden for its communication principles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://medinge.org/brands-with-a-conscience/past-winners/2004/ The Medinge Group - Brands with a Conscience Past winners 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217130913/http://medinge.org/brands-with-a-conscience/past-winners/2004/ |date=2010-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has partnered with [[UNICEF]] since 1984. In 2006, Sanrio launched [[Sanrio Digital]] together with [[Typhoon Games]] to expand to the Internet, [[online game]]s and mobile services. 2010 was Sanrio's 50th anniversary. In conjunction with this, [[Build-A-Bear Workshop]] released limited edition [[stuffed toy]]s of several Sanrio characters, including Hello Kitty, Chococat, My Melody and Keroppi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100804005380/en/Kitty-Sanrio-Friends-Celebrate-Sanrio%E2%80%99s-50th-Anniversary Hello Kitty and Sanrio Friends Celebrate Sanrio's 50th Anniversary at Build-A-Bear Workshop]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hello Kitty is alleged to be drawn in a similar style to the rabbit [[Miffy]].

'''Susanne Katherina Langer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|æ|ŋ|ər}}; ''née'' '''Knauth'''; December 20, 1895 – July 17, 1985) was an American philosopher, writer, and educator and was well known for her theories on the influences of art on the mind. She was one of the first women in American history to achieve an academic career in philosophy and the first woman to be popularly and professionally recognized as an American philosopher. Langer is best known for her 1942 book entitled, ''[[Philosophy in a New Key]]''. In 1960, Langer was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterL.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Born Susanne Katherina Knauth, Langer was raised in Manhattan's West Side in New York. She was the daughter of Antonio Knauth, an attorney, and Else Uhlich, both emigrants of Germany. Though she was American born, Langer's primary language was German, as it was strictly spoken in her household throughout her youth, and her German accent remained her entire life. She was exposed thoroughly to creativity and art, most specifically through music. She was taught to play the cello and the piano, and she continued with the cello for the remainder of her life. As a girl, Langer enjoyed reciting the works of great poets as well as traditional children's rhymes and tales. This sparked her love for reading and writing, and she would often write her own poems and stories to entertain her younger siblings. Her love of nature began during the summers her family spent in their cottage on Lake George. She married William Leonard Langer, a fellow student at Harvard in 1921, and in the same year they took their studies to Vienna, Austria. They had two sons and moved back to Cambridge, Massachusetts before the couple divorced in 1942. She died July 17, 1985.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/16/16-02412.html|title=American National Biography Online: Langer, Susanne K.|website=www.anb.org|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/topelius.htm |title=Susanne Langer |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221075501/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/topelius.htm |archivedate=21 February 2015 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
Her early education included attendance at [[Veltin School for Girls]], a private school as well as being tutored from home. In 1916, Langer enrolled at Radcliffe College. She earned the bachelor's degree in 1920 and continued with graduate studies in philosophy at Harvard, where she received the master's diploma in 1924 and the doctorate in 1926. She was a tutor in philosophy at Radcliffe from 1927 to 1942. She lectured in philosophy for one year at the University of Delaware and for five years at Columbia University (1945-1950). From 1954 to 1962 she taught at Connecticut College. She also taught philosophy at the University of Michigan, New York University, Northwestern University, Ohio University, Smith College, Vassar College, the University of Washington, and Wellesley College.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Philosophy ==

Susanne Langer's unexplored thesis revolving around the connection of consciousness and aesthetics as well as her unusual use of language in her writing ultimately caused her to be scrutinized by her fellow scholars. However, it led her to further explore the complexity and nature of human consciousness.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Shelley, C 1998, 'Consciousness, Symbols and Aesthetics: A Just-So Story and its Implications in Susanne Langer's 'Mind: An Essay on Human Feeling', ''Philosophical Psychology'', 11, 1, pp. 45-66, Philosopher's Index, EBSCOHost, viewed 4 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Langer's philosophy explored the continuous process of meaning-making in the human mind through the power of “seeing” one thing in terms of another. Langer's first major work is entitled, ''Philosophy in a New Key''. It put forth an idea that has become commonplace today: that there is a basic and pervasive human need to symbolize, to invent meanings, and to invest meanings in one’s world.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Howard Gardner, "Philosophy in a New Key Revisited: An Appreciation of Susanne Langer" ''Art, Mind, and Brain: A Cognitive Approach to Creativity'', New York: Basic Books, pp. 48–54&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with a critique of positivism, the work is a study of human thought progressing from semantic theory through philosophy of music, sketching a theory for all the arts. For Langer, the human mind "is constantly carrying on a process of symbolic transformation of the experiential data that come to it," causing it to be "a veritable fountain of more or less spontaneous ideas".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Susanne Langer's distinction between discursive versus presentational symbols is one of her better known concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann, Michael H. G., Geist und Welt – durch die Symbolisierungen der Kunst betrachtet, a review of Susanne K. Langer, Die lebendige Form menschlichen Fühlens und Verstehens (The living form of human feeling and understanding). Munich: Fink, 2000. {{ISBN|3-7705-3462-X}}, IASL Online, retrieved 2010-03-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Discursive symbolization arranges elements (not necessarily words) with stable and context invariant meanings into a new meaning. Presentation symbolization operates independently of elements with fixed and stable meanings. The presentation cannot be comprehended by progressively building up an understanding of its parts in isolation. It must be understood as a whole. For example, an element used in one painting may be used to articulate an entirely different meaning in another. The same principle applies to a note in a musical arrangement—such elements independently have no fixed meaning except in the context of their entire presentation.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Lachmann, Rolf (January 1998), From Metaphysics to Art and Back: The Relevance of Susan K. Langer’s Philosophy for Process Metaphysics 26, Process Studies, pp. 107–125&lt;/ref&gt;

Langer believed that symbolism is the central concern of philosophy because it underlies all human knowing and understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Littlejohn, Stephen W.; Foss, Karen A. (2008), ''Theories of Human Communication'' (9th ed.), Belmont, California: The Thomson Wadsworth Corporation, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; As with [[Ernst Cassirer]], Langer believed that what distinguishes humans from animals is the capacity for using symbols. While all animal life is dominated by feeling, human feeling is mediated by conceptions, symbols, and language. Animals respond to signs, but stimulus from a sign is significantly more complex for humans. The perspective also is associated with symbolic communication where animal societies are studied to help understand how symbolic communication affects the conduct of members of a cooperating group.

Langer is one of the earliest philosophers who paid close attention to the concept of the virtual. Inspired by Henri Bergson's notions of matter and memory, she connected art to the concept of the virtual. For her, figuring out the space of an art work by its creator was no less than building a virtual world. She describes virtuality as "the quality of all things that are created to be perceived." For her, the virtual is not only a matter of consciousness, but something external that is created intentionally and existing materially, as a space of contemplation outside of the human mind. Langer sees virtuality as a physical space created by the artist, such as a painting or a building, that is “significant in itself and not as part of the surroundings.” She particularly considers architecture not as the realization of a space for being, but its conceptual translation into virtuality for perceiving: “The architect, in fine, deals with a created space, a virtual entity.” In contrast to Bergson, for Langer, virtuality is tangible and can cause a contemplative interaction between humans and the machine.&lt;ref&gt;Susanne K. Langer, ''Feeling and Form'' (Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1953), 65 and 114–115.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her later years, Langer came to believe that the decisive task of her work was to construct a science and psychology based theory of the "life of the mind" using process philosophy conventions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Langer's final work, ''Mind: An Essay on Human Feeling'' represents the culmination of her attempt to establish a philosophical and scientific underpinning of aesthetic experience, relying on a three volume survey of a comprehensive set of relevant humanistic and scientific texts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== History of feeling ===
Langer's desire to study the mind and its connections with art was rooted in her theory that works of art are representations of human feeling and expression. This led Langer to construct a biological theory of feeling that explains that "feeling" is an inherently biological concept that can be connected to evolutionary genetics. In her essay, ''Mind'', Langer goes into depth to connect the early evolution of man to how we perceive the mind today. She explains that early organisms underwent refinery through natural selection, in which certain behaviors and functions were shaped in order for them to survive. Langer describes the body's organs to all operate within a specific rhythm, and these rhythms must cooperate with one another to keep the organism alive. This development, Langer explains, was the beginning of the framework for the Central Nervous System, which Langer believed to be the heart of cognitive interactions among humans.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Rhetoric ===
Susanne Langer's work with symbolism and meaning has led to her association with contemporary rhetoric, although her influence in the field is somewhat debated.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Lunsford, Andrea (1995). Reclaiming Rhetoric: Women in the Rhetorical Tradition. Pittsburgh, PA: University of Pittsburgh Press. pp. 265–284.&lt;/ref&gt; Langer established the use of symbols as the "epistemic unit of community",&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; suggesting that all knowledge in a community is gained and built from shared symbol-systems within a given culture. Langer's concept regarding language and dialogue may be understood to imply that language does not simply communicate, but it produces symbols from which humans then create their own reality.&lt;ref&gt;Innes, Robert (2008). Susanne Langer in Focus: The Symbolic Mind. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Claimed support of this perspective comes from Langer's statement that "language is intrinsic to thinking, imagining, even our ways of perceiving".&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;

According to Arabella Lyon, professor at State University of New York, Langer holds that meaning arises from the relationship between a community, its discourse, and the individual.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Lyon suggests that Langer's work may be viewed as a contradiction to the comparatively traditional theories of Aristotle, by way of Langer's argument that discourse forms through sensory experiences shared between speaker and hearer, rather than through logic as advocated by the philosopher. Langer's epistemic view of symbolism and language, which further examines the motivation of the speaker, the influential aspects of language that affect people, and the relationship between the speaker and the community,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; are often reflected in aspects of modern rhetorical studies.

== Influences ==
[[File:Susanne Langer - Filosofia é a contínua busca de sentidos - mais amplos, claros, negociados, articulados.svg|thumb|Poster with a quotation of Susanne Langer in Portuguese]]
Langer's works were largely influenced by fellow philosophers Ernst Cassirer and [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. Whitehead, an English mathematician and philosophy professor, was Langer's professor at Radcliffe. Whitehead introduced Langer to the history of human thought, the origins of the modern world, and contemporary philosophy. He helped shape her perspective on these topics which she presented in her first text, The Practice of Philosophy. Throughout her career, Whitehead continued to influence her understanding of the complicated world of human thought which guided her to pursue a philosophical career.  She shared Whitehead’s belief in going beyond the limitations of scientific research and believed that along with the new-found thinking and ideas that had initiated the modern era in science and philosophy, the opportunity for a rebirth of philosophical creativity would arise. Langer dedicated Philosophy in a New Key, to "Alfred North Whitehead, my great Teacher and Friend."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anthonyflood.com/drydenlangerwhitehead.htm|title=Dryden, "Whitehead’s Influence on Susanne Langer’s Conception of Living Form"|website=www.anthonyflood.com|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Susanne Langer's other main influence was the German philosopher Ernst Cassirer. Cassirer was a neo-Kantianist who studied the field of theories of symbolization. Cassirer influenced much of Langer's ides in ''Philosophy in a New Key'', where she stated that the creation of symbols is the essential activity of art, myth, rite, the sciences, mathematics, and philosophy. She stated, "It is a peculiar fact that every major advance in thinking, every epoch-making new insight, springs from a new type of symbolic transformation". She drew from Cassirer's view in her belief that art theory must be independent with a theory of mind.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
Susanne Langer is not an extremely well known philosopher; however, her work has influenced and continues to influence many. As one of the first female philosophers, her work has posed as an inspiration to many fellow women to pursue a future in philosophy and other related fields. Her imaginative views on the connections of art and aesthetics with the human mind were revolutionary during her time and sparked a wide interest in the complexity of human consciousness. Although her work is not often cited by today's philosophers, her theories on presentational symbolic activity are part of the "[[collective unconscious]]" where philosophy and psychology meet anthropology.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

[[Image:Vasnetsov Frog Princess.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Viktor Vasnetsov]], ''The Frog Tsarevna'', 1918.]]

'''The Frog Princess''' is a [[fairy tale]] that has multiple versions with various origins. It is classified as type 402, the animal bride, in the [[Aarne–Thompson|Aarne–Thompson index]].&lt;ref&gt;Georgias A. Megas, ''Folktales of Greece'', p 224, University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; Another tale of this type is ''[[Doll i' the Grass]]''.&lt;ref name="ashliman"&gt;D. L. Ashliman, "[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0402.html Animal Brides: folktales of Aarne–Thompson type 402 and related stories]"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russian language|Russian]] variants include the ''Frog Princess'' or ''[[Tsarevna]] Frog'' (''Царевна Лягушка'', ''Tsarevna Lyagushka'')&lt;ref&gt;{{wikisource-inline|Russian Wonder Tales/The Frog-Tzarevna|The Frog-Tzarevna}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also '''Vasilisa the Wise''' (''Василиса Премудрая'', ''Vasilisa Premudraya''); [[Alexander Afanasyev]] collected variants in his ''[[Narodnye russkie skazki]]''. [[Andrew Lang]] included an Italian variant titled '''The Frog''' in ''[[The Violet Fairy Book]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Lang, ''The Violet Fairy Book'', [http://www.mythfolklore.net/andrewlang/055.htm "The Frog"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italo Calvino]] included another Italian variant from Piedmont, '''The Prince Who Married a Frog''', in ''[[Italian Folktales]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Italo Calvino, Italian Folktales p 438 {{ISBN|0-15-645489-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he noted that the tale was common throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Italo Calvino, Italian Folktales p 718 {{ISBN|0-15-645489-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgios A. Megas included a Greek variant, '''The Enchanted Lake''', in ''Folktales of Greece''.&lt;ref&gt;Georgias A. Megas, ''Folktales of Greece'', p 49, University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The [[Monarch|king]] (or an old peasant woman, in Lang's version) wants his three sons to marry. To accomplish this, he creates a test to help them find brides. The king tells each prince to shoot an arrow. According to the King's rules, each prince will find his bride where the arrow lands. The youngest son's arrow is picked up by a [[frog]]. The king assigns his three prospective daughters-in-law various tasks, such as spinning cloth and baking bread. In every task, the frog far outperforms the two other lazy brides-to-be. In some versions, the frog uses magic to accomplish the tasks, and though the other brides attempt to emulate the frog, they cannot perform the magic. Still, the young prince is ashamed of his frog bride until she is magically transformed into a human princess.

In Calvino's version, the princes use slings rather than bows and arrows. In the Greek version, the princes set out to find their brides one by one; the older two are already married by the time the youngest prince starts his quest. Another variation involves the sons chopping down trees and heading in the direction pointed by them in order to find their brides.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.ca/Out-everywhere-Tales-new-world/dp/0888994028 Out of the Everywhere: New Tales for Canada, Jan Andrews]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ivan Bilibin 054 full.jpeg|thumb|250px|Illustration to ''The Frog Tsarevna'' by [[Ivan Bilibin]]]]
In the Russian versions of the story, Prince Ivan and his two older brothers shoot arrows in different directions to find brides. The other brothers' arrows land in the houses of the daughters of an aristocratic and wealthy [[merchant]]. Ivan's arrow lands in the mouth of a frog in a swamp, who turns into a princess at night. The Frog Princess, named Vasilisa the Wise, is a beautiful, intelligent, friendly, skilled girl who was forced to spend 3 years in a frog's skin for disobeying [[Koschei]]. Her final test may be to dance at the king's banquet. The Frog Princess sheds her skin, and the prince then burns it, to her dismay. Had the prince been patient, the Frog Princess would have been freed but instead he loses her. He then sets out to find her again and meets with [[Baba Yaga]], whom he impresses with his spirit, asking why she has not offered him hospitality. She tells him that Koschei is holding his bride captive and explains how to find the magic needle needed to rescue his bride. In another version, the prince's bride flies into Baba Yaga's hut as a [[bird]]. The prince catches her, she turns into a [[lizard]], and he cannot hold on. Baba Yaga rebukes him and sends him to her sister, where he fails again. However, when he is sent to the [[Rule of three (writing)|third]] sister, he catches her and no [[Shapeshifting#Transformation chase|transformations]] can break her free again.

In some versions of the story, the Frog Princess' transformation is a reward for her good nature. In one version, she is transformed by witches for their amusement. In yet another version, she is revealed to have been an enchanted princess all along.

==Variants==
This tale is closely related to ''[[Puddocky]]'' and its variants, in which a king sets three tasks to his sons to determine which is best suited to rule the country, and a transformed frog helps the youngest prince.

==Adaptations==
* ''[[Vasilisa the Beautiful (1939 film)|Vasilisa the Beautiful]]'', a 1939 Soviet film directed by [[Aleksandr Rou]], is based on this plot. It was the first large-budget feature in the [[Soviet Union]] to use fantasy elements, as opposed to the [[Socialist realism|realistic]] style long favored politically.&lt;ref&gt;James Graham, [http://www.endicott-studio.com/crossroads/crBabaYagaF.html Baba Yaga in Film] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109100659/http://www.endicott-studio.com/crossroads/crBabaYagaF.html |date=2013-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1953 the director [[Mikhail Tsekhanovsky]] had the idea of animating this popular national fairy tale. Production took two years, and the premiere took place in December, 1954. At present the film is included in the gold classics of "[[Soyuzmultfilm]]". &lt;!-- In 1960 it won the "Silver Oak Leaf" prize on the [[IFF]] in Mar del Plata (Argentina).  SEE TALK PAGE, "Mar del Plata".--&gt;
* ''[[Vasilisa the Beautiful (1977 film)|Vasilisa the Beautiful]]'', a 1977 Soviet animated film is also based on this fairy tale.
* In 1996, a animated Russian version based on an in-depth version of the tale in the film "Classic Fairy Tales From Around the World" on VHS. This version tells of how the beautiful Princess Vasilisa was kidnapped and cursed by the evil wizard Kashay to make her his bride and only the love of the handsome Prince Ivan can free her.
* Taking inspiration from the Russian story, Vasilisa appears to assist Hellboy against Koschei in the 2007 [[comic book]] ''[[Hellboy: Darkness Calls]]''.
* The Frog Princess was featured in ''[[Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child]]'', where it was depicted in a country setting. The episode features the voice talents of [[Jasmine Guy]] as Frog Princess Lylah, [[Greg Kinnear]] as Prince Gavin, [[Wallace Langham]] as Prince Bobby, [[Mary Gross]] as Elise, and [[Beau Bridges]] as King Big Daddy.

'''Theater of All Possibilities''' was an artistic practice network and touring theater founded in 1967 in [[San Francisco]] by [[John P. Allen|John Allen]], [[Kathelin Gray]] and Marie Harding.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/24/science/as-biosphere-is-sealed-its-patron-reflects-on-life.html The New York Times - As Biosphere Is Sealed, Its Patron Reflects on Life]&lt;/ref&gt; The group worked with collaborators from the sciences, technology, history, and ecology, with the [[Institute of Ecotechnics]] as a partner organization on many projects.

The Theater of All Possibilities network was based at [[Synergia Ranch]] near [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/156453374/ The Albuquerque Journal - Theater of All Possibilities Performing Faust in Old Town]&lt;/ref&gt; from 1969–1980 and again from 2000–2010. Other studios within the network included: Studio 3, the Blue Planet Ensemble, based on the Research Vessel Heraclitus; Studio 6, based at the [[October Gallery]] in London; Studio 7, based at the Naga Theatre at the Hotel Vajra in [[Kathmandu]]; and Studio 10, which operated until 1994 at the [[Biosphere 2]] laboratory in [[Oracle, Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Dreaming-Biosphere-Theater-All-Possibilities/dp/0826346731 Dreaming the Biosphere The Theater of All Possibilities by Rebecca Reider]&lt;/ref&gt;

An ensemble from the Theater of All Possibilities toured domestically and internationally from 1968 to 1989. A 1972 18-month world tour by the ensemble Caravan from Dramaturgia included a performance at [[Ellen Stewart]]'s [[La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club]] in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]], [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. The Caravan from Dramaturgia presented two pieces at La MaMa, ''Tamarand'' and ''The Caravan'', on October 4, 5, 6, and 7. A promotional flyer for the production reads: "Every day we make up and wipe out our sets."&lt;ref&gt;La MaMa's Digital Collections, [http://catalog.lamama.org/index.php/Detail/Object/Show/object_id/1660 "Promotional Flyer: 'Tamarand' and 'The Caravan' (1972)". Retrieved March 14, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Theater of All Possibilities extended their practice into contributing to the founding of multiple ecological and cultural demonstration and performance projects. These projects included performances in the [[Outback|Australian Outback]], the [[Peruvian Amazon]], and the [[Osun-Osogbo|sacred forest in Osogbo]], as well as traditional theater spaces.

The network was formally disbanded in 2009/2010. Allen and Gray subsequently formed the performance research initiative Theatre for the Reconstitution of Reality (THEATRRR), also based in [[New Mexico]].

'''''What We Lose''''' is the debut novel of American author [[Zinzi Clemmons]]. It was loosely based on her own experiences caring for her mother who was dying of cancer. 

==Background==
{{Expand section|date=May 2018}}

Clemmons was a graduate student in the fiction MFA program at [[Columbia University]], working on a novel, when her mother was diagnosed with [[breast cancer]]. She finished her degree but set aside the novel, instead writing journals of her experiences caring for and ultimately grieving her mother's death. These became the basis of a more experimental project than her unfinished linear novel, a fragmentary and chronologically disrupted "exercise in autofiction".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Plot==
Thandi, the daughter of an [[South Africa]] mother and an American father, comes of age in [[Pennsylvania]]. When she is in college, her mother is stricken by cancer and dies, causing Thandi's life to fall apart as she struggles to process her grief.

Shortly thereafter, Thandi discovers she is pregnant by her boyfriend Peter. She decides to carry the pregnancy to term and has a son she names Mahpee. She and Peter quickly marry and he moves to New York City to be with her and their child. However their marriage quickly falls apart and after she cheats on him, she decides to ask for a separation. 

Thandi begins to forget her mother and slowly begins to heal, though she realizes her mother's death will haunt her for the rest of her life.

==Style==
In ''[[The Guardian]]'', Marta Bausells described ''What We Lose'' as "highly experimental, told in intimate vignettes including blogposts, photos, hand-drawn charts and hip-hop lyrics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/10/zinzi-clemmons-what-we-lose-interview|title=Zinzi Clemmons on her first novel: 'I’m proud of it, because I didn’t hold anything back'|last1=Bausells|first1=Marta|date=August 10, 2017|work=The Guardian|accessdate=January 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', Megan O'Grady notes the book's "boldly innovative and frankly sexual" style, noting "the collage-like novel mixes hand-drawn charts, archival photographs, rap lyrics, sharp disquisitions on the [[Nelson Mandela|Mandelas]] and [[Oscar Pistorius]], and singular meditations on racism’s brutal intimacies."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/zinzi-clemmons-what-we-lose-interview|title=Zinzi Clemmons Has Written the Debut Novel of the Year|last=O'Grady|first=Megan|date=July 20, 2017|work=Vogue|access-date=2018-05-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Grady compared Clemmons to authors like [[Karl Ove Knausgård|Karl Ove Knausgaard]], [[Meghan O'Rourke|Meghan O’Rourke]], and [[Claudia Rankine]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Clemmons cites [[Toni Morrison]]'s ''[[The Bluest Eye]]'' as a significant influence for ''What We Lose''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
