      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2619">The '''Académie Delécluse''' was an [[atelier]]-style art school in Paris, France, founded in the late 19th century by the painter Auguste Joseph Delécluse. It was exceptionally supportive of women artists, with more space being given to women students than to men.

==History==
The academy was founded by the French painter Auguste Joseph Delécluse (1855-1928) and seems to have been in business by 1884.&lt;ref name=butlin/&gt; It moved several times before establishing a permanent location in Montparnasse on the Rue Notre Dame des Champs.&lt;ref name=butlin/&gt;&lt;ref name=tpweekly/&gt; Like the [[Académie Julian]], [[Académie Colarossi]], and [[Académie Vitti]], it accepted women students. Men and women were trained separately, and it had two studios for women and only one for men.&lt;ref name=leverton/&gt; It proved to be particularly popular among English&lt;ref name=leverton/&gt; and American&lt;ref name=butlin/&gt; women artists. During its heyday, it was one of the four best-known ateliers in Paris,&lt;ref name=leverton/&gt; but its influence and ability to attract good students waned in the early 20th century.

Among its faculty were [[Edward Frederick Ertz]], [[Svend Rasmussen Svendsen]], Georges Callot, Paul Delance, and Delécluse himself. Notable students included [[Gertrude Partington Albright]], [[Nathaniel Choate]], [[Colin Campbell Cooper]], [[Emma Lampert Cooper]], [[Jenny Eakin Delony]], [[Simon Elwes]], [[Agnes Goodsir]], [[Harold Harvey (artist)|Harold Harvey]], [[Sarah Noble Ives]], [[Andrew Law (artist)|Andrew Law]], [[Blanche Lazzell]], [[Harry Leith-Ross]], [[Anna Lownes]], [[Cedric Morris]], [[Hilda Rix Nicholas]],  [[Roland Hinton Perry]], and [[Edith Somerville]].

'''American studies''' or '''American civilization''' is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary field]] of scholarship that examines [[History of the United States|American history]], [[Society of the United States|society]], and [[Culture of the United States|culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Theories of American Culture, Theories of American Studies | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1ym7FW6rNnoC&amp;pg=PR9| isbn= 3-8233-4173-1 | publisher= Gunter Narr Verlag | year= 2003| author=Winfried Fluck| accessdate=2011-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It traditionally incorporates the study of history, [[American literature|literature]], and [[critical theory]], but also welcomes research methods from a variety of other disciplines.

Scholarship in American studies has most often concerned the [[United States]]. In the past decades, however, it has also sought to study other nations and territories in the Americas, as well as American interactions with countries across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rowe|first1=Juan Carlos|title=Transnationalism and American Studies|url=http://www.theasa.net/project_eas_online/page/project_eas_online_eas_featured_article/|website=American Studies Association|publisher=American Studies Association|accessdate=2015-09-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916062345/http://www.theasa.net/project_eas_online/page/project_eas_online_eas_featured_article/|archivedate=2015-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjects studied within the field are varied, but often examine the histories of American communities, ideologies, or cultural productions. Examples might include topics in American social movements, literature, media, tourism, folklore, and intellectual history.

Fields studying specific American ethnic or racial groups are considered to be both independent of and included within the broader American studies discipline. This includes [[African American studies]], [[Latin American studies]], [[Asian American studies]], [[American Indian studies]], and others.

==Founding notions==
[[Vernon Louis Parrington]] is often cited as the founder of American studies for his three-volume ''Main Currents in American Thought'', which combines the methodologies of [[literary criticism]] and historical research; it won the [[1928 Pulitzer Prize]]. In the introduction to ''Main Currents in American Thought'', Parrington described his field:

:I have undertaken to give some account of the genesis and development in American letters of certain germinal ideas that have come to be reckoned traditionally American&amp;mdash;how they came into being here, how they were opposed, and what influence they have exerted in determining the form and scope of our characteristic ideals and institutions. In pursuing such a task, I have chosen to follow the broad path of our political, economic, and social development, rather than the narrower [[Belles-lettres|belletristic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parrington|first1=Vernon Louis|title=Main Currents In American Thought Volume One 1620-1800 The Colonial Mind|date=1927 |publisher=Harcourt, Brace and Company, Inc|page=ix|url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.53378/2015.53378.Main-Currents-In-American-Thought#page/n9/mode/2up |accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "broad path" that Parrington describes formed a scholastic course of study for [[Henry Nash Smith]], who received a Ph.D. from [[Harvard]]'s interdisciplinary program in "History and American Civilization" in 1940, setting an academic precedent for present-day American Studies programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fsm76|title = Texas State Historical Association|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The first signature methodology of American studies was the "[[myth and symbol]]" approach, developed in such foundational texts as Henry Nash Smith's ''Virgin Land'' in 1950 and [[Leo Marx]]'s ''[[The Machine in the Garden]]'' in 1964.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}  Myth and symbol scholars claimed to find certain recurring themes throughout American texts that served to illuminate a unique American culture. Later scholars such as [[Annette Kolodny]] and [[Alan Trachtenberg]] re-imagined the myth and symbol approach in light of multicultural studies.

Beginning in the 1960s and 70s, these earlier approaches were criticized for continuing to promote the idea of [[American exceptionalism]]&amp;mdash;the notion that the US has had a special mission and virtue that makes it unique among nations. Several generations of American Studies scholars have critiqued this ethnocentric view, and have focused critically on issues of race, ethnicity, gender and sexuality, and both transnational and international concerns.

Institutionally, in the last decade the American Studies Association has reflected the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of the field, creating particularly strong connections to other interdisciplines such as ethnic studies, gender studies, cultural studies and post- or de-colonial studies. Environmental perspectives, in ascendance in related fields, such as literature and history, have not penetrated the mainstream of American studies scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/10231602/Necrocracy_in_America_American_Studies_Begins_to_Address_Fossil_Fuels_and_Climate_Change |title=Necrocracy in America: American Studies Begins to Address Fossil Fuels and Climate Change &amp;#124; Matthew Schneider-Mayerson |publisher=Academia.edu |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major theme of the field in recent years has been internationalization{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}&amp;mdash;the recognition that much vital scholarship about the US and its relations to the wider global community has been and is being produced outside the United States.

==Outside the United States==
Following [[World War II]] and during the [[Cold War]], the U.S. government promoted the study of the United States in several European countries, helping to endow chairs in universities and institutes in American history, politics and literature in the interests of [[cultural diplomacy]].  Many scholars and governments in Europe also recognized the need to study the U.S. The field has become especially prominent in Britain and Germany. The [[British Association for American Studies]] was founded in 1955, and is a constituent member of the [[European Association for American Studies]].

European centres for American studies include the [[Center for American Studies]] in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] and most notably the [[John F. Kennedy-Institute for North American Studies]] in Berlin, Germany. Other centers for American Studies in Germany include the Bavarian America-Academy, the [[University of Munich]], the [[Heidelberg Center for American Studies]] (HCA) and the Center for North American Studies (Zentrum für Nordamerikaforschung or ZENAF) at [[Goethe University Frankfurt]]. Graduate studies in the field of North American Studies can also be undertaken at the [[University of Cologne]], which works together in joint partnership with the North American Studies program at the [[University of Bonn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northamericanstudies.de/ |title=Home |publisher=Northamericanstudies.de |date=2015-10-01 |accessdate=2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Studies Leipzig program at the [[University of Leipzig]] offers both BA and MA degrees and is known for the graduate journal ''[[aspeers]]''. Founded in 1992, the Center for American Studies at the [[University of Southern Denmark]] now offers a graduate program in American Studies. In the [[Netherlands]] the [[University of Groningen]] and the [[Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen]] offer a complete undergraduate and graduate program in American Studies. The [[University of Amsterdam]], the [[University of Leiden]] and the [[University of Utrecht]] only offer a graduate program in American Studies. Both the [[University of Sussex]] and the [[University of Nottingham]] in England offer both a number of postgraduate and undergraduate programs. In [[Sweden]], the Swedish Institute for North American Studies at [[Uppsala University]] offers a minor in American studies. In [[Slovakia]], the [[University of Presov]] and [[Pavol Jozef Safarik University]] offer a complete undergraduate and graduate program in American Studies combined with British Studies.  The Eccles Centre for American Studies at the British Library also offers a range of events and fellowships, as well as promoting the American collections held at the British Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/americas/|title=American Collections blog|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia's main center for American studies is the [[Institute for US and Canadian Studies]] of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], founded in 1967.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In the Middle East, the oldest American Studies program is the American Studies Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://userspages.uob.edu.bh/asc/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307193645/http://userspages.uob.edu.bh/asc/ |archivedate=2009-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Bahrain]] in Sakhir.  Founded in 1998, the UOB ASC celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://userspages.uob.edu.bh/asc/tenth%20anniversary.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001011305/http://userspages.uob.edu.bh/asc/tenth%20anniversary.htm |date=October 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Established as a university minor, the ASC currently offers over 20 different courses for students, heralds weekly movies in its ASC Theater, regularly hosts diverse speakers, and sponsors gatherings and excursions for ASC students. There is a new American Studies program at the [[University of Tehran]], Iran. The new program, offered at the Faculty of World Studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fws.ut.ac.ir|title=دانشکده مطالعات جهان|author=|date=|website=دانشکده مطالعات جهان}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a multidisciplinary MA program focusing on American culture, politics, history and ethnicity.

In Oceania, the [[University of Canterbury]] in [[Christchurch]] New Zealand operated a full undergraduate and graduate American Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hums.canterbury.ac.nz/amst/|title=College of Arts - School of Humanities and Creative Arts - University of Canterbury - New Zealand|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; program until 2012, and in Australia, a postgraduate program in US Studies is run by the [[United States Studies Centre]] at the University of Sydney.

In Canada, the [[University of Alberta]] has the [[Alberta Institute for American Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanstudies.ualberta.ca/ |title=Home - University of Alberta |publisher=Americanstudies.ualberta.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-12-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222173722/http://www.americanstudies.ualberta.ca/ |archive-date=2015-12-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Western Ontario]] has a Centre for American Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cas.uwo.ca/ |title=CAS Main page - Western University |publisher=Cas.uwo.ca |date=2015-10-01 |accessdate=2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; that has both an undergraduate and master's program in American Studies, with specializations at the graduate level in American Cultural Studies, and Canadian-American Relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cas.uwo.ca/graduate/grad_program_information.html |title=Program Information - CAS - Western University |publisher=CAS |date= |accessdate=2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[York University]] offers an undergraduate program in United States Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://futurestudents.yorku.ca/program/us-studies |title=United States Studies &amp;#124; Future Students &amp;#124; York University |publisher=Futurestudents.yorku.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, due to the lack of communication between China and the United States since the communist party took up the power in 1949, the Chinese recognition of the U.S. was still limited to the communist political propaganda of the Cold War at the time when the two countries established the diplomatic relationship. Therefore, since the Sino-U.S. relationship was normalized in 1979, various research centers have been founded within Chinese universities in order to meet up to the needs of understanding the U.S. Thus, most of the prestigious American Studies centers in China established around 1980s, such as American Studies Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asc.bfsu.edu.cn/index.php/en/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110013928/http://asc.bfsu.edu.cn/index.php/en/ |archivedate=2014-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Beijing Foreign Studies University]]) in 1979, the Institute of American Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ias.cass.cn|title=中国社会科学院美国研究所|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Chinese Academy of Social Science]]) in 1981, Center For American Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cas.fudan.edu.cn|title=复旦大学美国研究中心|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Fudan University]]) in 1985, American Studies Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asc.pku.edu.cn/Pages/Default.aspx?id=b666eff9-c079-462e-a492-9a60f2bd7cfe |title=北京大学美国研究中心 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129011622/http://www.asc.pku.edu.cn/Pages/Default.aspx?id=b666eff9-c079-462e-a492-9a60f2bd7cfe |archivedate=2014-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Peking University]]) in 1980,Center for American Studies&lt;ref&gt;http://cas.tongji.edu.cn{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Tongji University]]), American Studies Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ascscu.scu.edu.cn|title=四川大学美国研究中心|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Sichuan University]]) in 1985, [[Hopkins-Nanjing Center|Johns Hopkins University-Nanjing University Center for Chinese and American Studies]] in 1986,  American Social and Cultural Studies Center ([[China Foreign Affairs University]]) and Center for American Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flold.ecnu.edu.cn/myzx/About_Us.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129012354/http://www.flold.ecnu.edu.cn/myzx/About_Us.htm |archivedate=2014-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[East China Normal University]]) in 2004. These centers do not have undergraduate programs. Based on the requirement of the curriculum setup of the China Department of Education, these centers only have graduate programs. In addition, there are also scholarly journals, such as ''American Studies Quarterly'',&lt;ref&gt;http://qk.cass.cn/mgyj/set{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; up in 1987 and organized by both the Institute of American Studies of Academy of Social Science and the Chinese Association of American Studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ias.cass.cn/zhmgxuehui/zc.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129030155/http://ias.cass.cn/zhmgxuehui/zc.asp |archivedate=2014-11-29 |df= }} and&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fudan American Review''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cas.fudan.edu.cn/far.php|title=复旦大学美国研究中心|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; organized by the Center of American Studies of Fudan University.

The American Studies in the U.S. is different from the American Studies in China. The former focuses more on one aspect, which is “civilization”; and the latter includes almost every aspects of the U.S., among which the civilization is just a constituent (Ye 207). Take the curriculum in the American Studies program in Beijing Foreign Studies University (BFSU) as an example. The American Studies program in BFSU is not only the oldest one but also the one in which all courses taught in English from the beginning of its founding. To help the students lay a comprehensive and interdisciplinary grounding in American Studies, the current ASC curriculum, made up of 28 courses, centers on three major areas: 1) American Government and Diplomacy, 2) American Society and Culture, 3) American Economy and Trade. In addition, there have been short courses and seminars offered by guest speakers from home and abroad to broaden the students’ horizon for better understanding of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Studies Center |url=http://asc.bfsu.edu.cn/index.php/en/about/american-studies-center |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129014049/http://asc.bfsu.edu.cn/index.php/en/about/american-studies-center |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 November 2014 |website=Beijing Foreign Studies University |accessdate=6 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Every master student is required to choose one of the three major areas as his or her study track and chooses the courses accordingly.

The affiliation of each center decides its different research focuses, although sometimes they have some study overlapping. According to the affiliations, these centers can be generally divided into two groups. The one, affiliated to the international relations department, academically tends to focus on U.S. politics, economy, law and diplomacy. The diploma conferred is the Politics. While the other, to the foreign language department, usually concentrate more on racial/gender issues, literature, religion, education, history and culture. The diploma conferred is English Language and Literature. For example, the American Studies Center of BFSU belongs to the School of English and International Studies, and the Center of American Studies of Fudan University is administered by the Institute of International Studies.

The researches on different areas are not equally developed. The researches on economy, politics and foreign policy have been much more developed than that on American culture and thoughts. Out of the all articles from the year of 1987 to 2008 published in ''American Studies Quarterly'', the ones, which deal with the Sino-U.S. relations including American foreign diplomacy, foreign commerce and military policies and strategies, accounts for 50.9%. Whereas, the articles, which have its topics on literature, history, gender, intellectual history, philosophy and culture, only take up about 20% (Ye 207).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=叶Ye|first1=英Ying|title=中美两国的美国研究及美国学在中国的学科建 (American Studies in the United States and China and the Curriculum Setup of American Civilization in China)|journal=西南民族大学学报（Journal of Southwest Universities for Nationalities)|volume=5|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the accelerating academic exchange between two countries, more and more students are coming to the U.S. to study American Studies and at the same time American Studies scholars coming to China to do researches and teaching.

In [[Republic of Korea]], [[Sogang University]]&lt;ref&gt;http://english.sogang.ac.kr&lt;/ref&gt; (Seoul, Korea) is the sole institution that offers regular degree program both in bachelor(BA) and master(MA) degree in American Studies, named American Culture. The American Culture division is run by the Department of English along with English Literature and Linguistics. The undergraduate program consists of classes covering topics such as Native American, Black American, Asian American, American history and the context of specific period of America.  [[Keimyung University]] (Daegu, Korea), [[Hansung University]] (Seoul, Korea), [[Pyeongtaek University]] (Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi-do, Korea), [[Kyunghee University]] (Yongin, Gyonggi-do, Korea) are also providing American Studies major.[[Seoul National University]] (Seoul, Korea) and [[Yonsei University]] (Seoul, Korea) offers undergraduate Interdisciplinary course about American Studies. The American Studies Association of Korea(ASAK) researches multicultural context of American into Korean circumstance. In contrast of Chinese Institution focuses on America after Cold War era, The ASAK focuses on multicultural problem and politics that affects modern day American society.

==International American Studies Association (IASA)==
Founded at Bellagio, Italy in 2000, the International American Studies Association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iasaweb.org/|title=IASA - International American Studies Association|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has held five World Congresses at Leyden (2003), Ottawa (2005), Lisbon (2007), Beijing (2009)and Rio de Janeiro (2011).

[[File:Areni-1_cave_entrance.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the [[Areni-1 cave complex|Areni-1 cave]]]]

The '''Areni-1 winery''' is a 6100-year-old [[winery]] that was discovered in 2007 in the [[Areni-1 cave complex]] in the village of [[Areni]] in the [[Vayots Dzor]] province of [[Armenia]] by a team of Armenian and Irish archaeologists. The excavations were carried out by Boris Gasparyan of the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Armenia]]  and Ron Pinhasi from [[University College Cork]] (Ireland), and were sponsored by the Gfoeller Foundation (USA) and University College Cork. In 2008 the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) also joined the project with Gregory Areshian as co-director of the Areni Project. Since then the excavations have been sponsored by UCLA and the [[National Geographic Society]] as well. The excavations of the winery were completed in 2010.

The winery consists of [[Fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] [[Barrel|vats]], a [[wine press]], storage jars, pottery sherds, and is believed to be at least a thousand years older than the winery unearthed in [[Judea and Samaria]] in 1963, which is the second oldest currently known.&lt;ref name= "LAT"&gt;Maugh II, Thomas H.

The [[Areni-1 shoe]] was found in the same cave in 2008.

==Discovery==
Excavations at the Areni-1 site began in 2007 and continued until September 2010. Armenian, American and Irish archaeologists fully unearthed a large, well-preserved 2-foot (60 centimeter) deep vat, along with a 3.5-foot (one meter) long basin made of clay and covered with [[malvidin]].&lt;ref name="NatGeo"/&gt; In addition to these discoveries grape seeds, remains of pressed grapes, prunes, walnuts, and desiccated vines were found. A number of drinking cups, found next to a set of ancient graves, were also excavated, suggesting that the site was used for funeral ceremonies and ritualistic practices.&lt;ref&gt;Belluck, Pam. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/11/science/11wine.html?_r=1&amp;ref=science Cave Drops Hints to Earliest Glass of Red]." ''[[New York Times]]''. January 11, 2011.

The team's full findings will be published in future.

==Analysis==
The results of the biochemical analysis of the residues from the bottom of the wine-press and the storage jars carried out by Hans Barnard and his colleagues at UCLA were published in the ''Journal of Archaeological Science'' in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Barnard, Hans et al. "[http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/science/YJASC_2685.pdf Chemical evidence for wine production around 4000 BCE in the Late Chalcolithic Near Eastern highlands]." ''Journal of Archaeological Science'', (2010), {{doi|10.1016/j.jas.2010.11.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Botanical analysis and [[radiocarbon]] tests carried out by researchers at the [[University of California, Irvine]] and [[Oxford University]] have revealed the date of the Areni-1 winery to around 4100 BC and 4000 BC or the [[Copper Age|Late Chalcolithic Period]].&lt;ref name="AFP"/&gt; According to Areshian, the vintners used their feet to press the wine in the clay basin, the juice of which would then drain into the vat, where it would remain to [[Fermentation (wine)|ferment]] until being stored in jars.&lt;ref name="NatGeo"/&gt; The capacity of the vat has been estimated to be about 14–15 gallons (US or imperial??) {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}.

According to Areshian, the discovery of the winery has provided greater insight to the study of [[horticulture]]. Patrick E. McGovern, a biomolecular archaeologist at the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum]], has likewise emphasized the importance of the discovery, describing it as "important and unique, because it indicates large-scale wine production, which would imply, I think, that the grape had already been domesticated."&lt;ref name="NatGeo"/&gt;

The exact identity of the people who lived in the region at the time is not known, although some researchers have postulated that they may have belonged to the [[Kura-Araxes culture|Kura-Araxes]] people and added that they may have been very involved in trade.&lt;ref name= "LAT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AFP"/&gt;

The word "astrochemistry" may be applied to both the [[Solar System]] and the [[interstellar medium]]. The study of the abundance of elements and [[isotope]] ratios in Solar System objects, such as [[meteorite]]s, is also called [[cosmochemistry]], while the study of interstellar atoms and molecules and their interaction with radiation is sometimes called molecular astrophysics. The formation, atomic and chemical composition, evolution and fate of [[molecular cloud|molecular gas clouds]] is of special interest, because it is from these clouds that solar systems form.

== History ==
As an offshoot of the disciplines of astronomy and chemistry, the history of astrochemistry is founded upon the shared history of the two fields. The development of advanced observational and experimental [[spectroscopy]] has allowed for the detection of an [[List of interstellar and circumstellar molecules|ever-increasing array of molecules]] within solar systems and the surrounding interstellar medium. In turn, the increasing number of chemicals discovered by advancements in spectroscopy and other technologies have increased the size and scale of the [[chemical space]] available for astrochemical study.

=== History of Spectroscopy ===
{{Main|History of spectroscopy|Astronomical spectroscopy}}

Observations of solar spectra as performed by [[Athanasius Kircher]] (1646), [[Jan Marek Marci]] (1648), [[Robert Boyle]] (1664), and [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi]] (1665) all predated Newton's 1666 work which established the [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectral]] nature of light and resulted in the first [[optical spectrometer|spectroscope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| accessdate = 24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These spectral lines were later quantified through the work of [[Joseph Von Fraunhofer]].

Spectroscopy was first used to distinguish between different materials after the release of [[Charles Wheatstone]]'s 1835 report that the [[Atomic emission spectroscopy|sparks]] given off by different metals have distinct emission spectra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| doi=10.1016/S0016-0032(36)91307-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This observation was later built upon by [[Léon Foucault]], who demonstrated in 1849 that identical [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] and [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]] lines result from the same material at different temperatures. An equivalent statement was independently postulated by [[Anders Jonas Ångström]] in his 1853 work ''Optiska Undersökningar,'' where it was theorized that luminous gases emit rays of light at the same frequencies as light which they may absorb.

This spectroscopic data began to take upon theoretical importance with Johann Balmer's observation that the spectral lines exhibited by samples of hydrogen followed a simple empirical relationship which came to be known as the [[Balmer Series]]. This series, a special case of the more general [[Rydberg formula|Rydberg Formula]] developed by [[Johannes Rydberg]] in 1888, was created to describe the spectral lines observed for [[Hydrogen]]. Rydberg's work expanded upon this formula by allowing for the calculation of spectral lines for multiple different chemical elements.&lt;ref&gt;Bohr, N Rydberg's discovery of the spectral laws. Page 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretical importance granted to these spectroscopic results was greatly expanded upon the development of [[quantum mechanics]], as the theory allowed for these results to be compared to atomic and molecular emission spectra which had been calculated ''a priori''.

=== History of Astrochemistry ===

While [[radio astronomy]] was developed in the 1930s, it was not until 1937 that any substantial evidence arose for the conclusive identification of an interstellar ''molecule''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

These findings were confirmed in 1940, when McKellar et al. identified and attributed spectroscopic lines in an as-of-then unidentified radio observation to CH and CN molecules in interstellar space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The discovery of interstellar formaldehyde - and later, other molecules with potential biological significance such as water or [[carbon monoxide]] - is seen by some as strong supporting evidence for [[Abiogenesis|abiogenetic]] theories of life: specifically, theories which hold that the basic molecular components of life came from extraterrestrial sources. This has prompted a still ongoing search for interstellar molecules which are either of direct biological importance - such as interstellar [[glycine]], discovered in 2009&lt;ref name="Glycine Discovery Announcement"&gt;{{cite web

== Spectroscopy ==
{{main|Spectroscopy}}
One particularly important experimental tool in astrochemistry is [[spectroscopy]] through the use of [[telescope]]s to measure the absorption and emission of [[light]] from molecules and atoms in various environments. By comparing astronomical observations with laboratory measurements, astrochemists can infer the elemental abundances, chemical composition, and [[temperature]]s of [[star]]s and [[interstellar cloud]]s. This is possible because [[ion]]s, [[atom]]s, and molecules have characteristic spectra: that is, the absorption and emission of certain wavelengths (colors) of light, often not visible to the human eye. However, these measurements have limitations, with various types of radiation ([[radio waves|radio]], [[infrared radiation|infrared]], visible, [[ultraviolet radiation|ultraviolet]] etc.) able to detect only certain types of species, depending on the chemical properties of the molecules. [[Interstellar formaldehyde]] was the first [[organic molecule]] detected in the interstellar medium.

Perhaps the most powerful technique for detection of individual [[chemical species]] is [[radio astronomy]], which has resulted in the detection of over a hundred [[interstellar species]], including [[Radical (chemistry)|radicals]] and ions, and [[organic compounds|organic]] (i.e. [[carbon]]-based) compounds, such as [[alcohol]]s, [[acid]]s, [[aldehyde]]s, and [[ketone]]s. One of the most abundant interstellar molecules, and among the easiest to detect with radio waves (due to its strong electric [[dipole]] moment), is CO ([[carbon monoxide]]). In fact, CO is such a common interstellar molecule that it is used to map out molecular regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/mmw/CO_survey_aitoff.jpg |title=CO_survey_aitoff.jpg  |publisher=Harvard University |date=18 Jan 2008 |accessdate=18 Apr 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The radio observation of perhaps greatest human interest is the claim of interstellar [[glycine]],&lt;ref name=Kuan&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kuan |first1=Y. J. |last2=Charnley |first2=S. B. |last3=Huang |first3=H. C. |title=Interstellar glycine |journal=[[Astrophys.

E. |last2=Lovas |first2=F. J. |last3=Hollis |first3=J. M. |title=A rigorous attempt to verify interstellar glycine |journal=[[Astrophys. J.]] |volume=619 |issue=2 |pages=914–930 |date=2005 |doi=10.1086/426677 |bibcode=2005ApJ...619..914S |arxiv=astro-ph/0410335|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the reasons why this detection was controversial is that although radio (and some other methods like [[rotational spectroscopy]]) are good for the identification of simple species with large [[Bond dipole moment|dipole moments]], they are less sensitive to more complex molecules, even something relatively small like amino acids.

Moreover, such methods are completely blind to molecules that have no [[dipole]]. For example, by far the most common molecule in the universe is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[hydrogen]] gas), but it does not have a dipole moment, so it is invisible to radio telescopes. Moreover, such methods cannot detect species that are not in the gas-phase. Since dense molecular clouds are very cold ({{convert|10|to|50|K|C F|disp=sqbr}}), most molecules in them (other than hydrogen) are frozen, i.e. solid. Instead, hydrogen and these other molecules are detected using other wavelengths of light. Hydrogen is easily detected in the ultraviolet (UV) and visible ranges from its absorption and emission of light (the [[hydrogen line]]). Moreover, most organic compounds absorb and emit light in the infrared (IR) so, for example, the  detection of [[methane]] in the atmosphere of Mars&lt;ref name= Mumma&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mumma |title=Strong Release of Methane on Mars in Northern Summer 2003 |journal=Science |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1165243 |pmid=19150811 |doi=10.1126/science.1165243 |date=2009 |volume=323 |pages=1041–5 |last2=Villanueva |first2=GL |last3=Novak |first3=RE |last4=Hewagama |first4=T |last5=Bonev |first5=BP |last6=Disanti |first6=MA |last7=Mandell |first7=AM |last8=Smith |first8=MD |issue=5917 |bibcode=2009Sci...323.1041M|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; was achieved using an IR ground-based telescope, NASA's 3-meter [[Infrared Telescope Facility]] atop Mauna Kea, Hawaii.

Infrared astronomy has also revealed that the interstellar medium contains a suite of complex gas-phase carbon compounds called [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon|polyaromatic hydrocarbons]], often abbreviated PAHs or PACs. These molecules, composed primarily of fused rings of carbon (either neutral or in an ionized state), are said to be the most common class of carbon compound in the galaxy. They are also the most common class of carbon molecule in meteorites and in cometary and asteroidal dust ([[cosmic dust]]). These compounds, as well as the amino acids, [[nucleobase]]s, and many other compounds in meteorites, carry [[deuterium]] and [[isotope]]s of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen that are very rare on earth, attesting to their extraterrestrial origin. The PAHs are thought to form in hot circumstellar environments (around dying, carbon-rich [[red giant]] stars).

Infrared astronomy has also been used to assess the composition of solid materials in the interstellar medium, including [[silicate]]s, [[kerogen]]-like carbon-rich solids, and [[ice]]s. This is because unlike visible light, which is scattered or absorbed by solid particles, the IR radiation can pass through the microscopic interstellar particles, but in the process there are absorptions at certain wavelengths that are characteristic of the composition of the grains.&lt;ref name="astrochem"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astrochemistry.org/observe |title=The Astrophysics &amp; Astrochemistry Laboratory |publisher=NASA Ames Research Center |date=10 Sep 2013 |accessdate=18 Apr 2014 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As above with radio astronomy, there are certain limitations, e.g. N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is difficult to detect by either IR or radio astronomy.

Such IR observations have determined that in dense clouds (where there are enough particles to attenuate the destructive UV radiation) thin ice layers coat the microscopic particles, permitting some low-temperature chemistry to occur. Since hydrogen is by far the most abundant molecule in the universe, the initial chemistry of these ices is determined by the chemistry of the hydrogen. If the hydrogen is atomic, then the H atoms react with available O, C and N atoms, producing "reduced" species like H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. However, if the hydrogen is molecular and thus not reactive, this permits the heavier atoms to react or remain bonded together, producing CO, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CN, etc. These mixed-molecular ices are exposed to ultraviolet radiation and [[cosmic ray]]s, which results in complex radiation-driven chemistry.&lt;ref name="astrochem" /&gt; Lab experiments on the photochemistry of simple interstellar ices have produced amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/links/020328/020328-3.html |title=Astrobiology: Photochemistry on ice |publisher=Macmillan Publishers Ltd. |date=28 Mar 2002 |accessdate=18 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The similarity between interstellar and cometary ices (as well as comparisons of gas phase compounds) have been invoked as indicators of a connection between interstellar and cometary chemistry. This is somewhat supported by the results of the analysis of the organics from the comet samples returned by the [[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust mission]] but the minerals also indicated a surprising contribution from high-temperature chemistry in the solar nebula.

Research is progressing on the way in which interstellar and circumstellar molecules form and interact, e.g. by including non-trivial [[Quantum tunnelling#Astrochemistry in interstellar clouds|quantum mechanical phenomena]] for synthesis pathways on interstellar particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url =https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3768233/pdf/COC-17-1758.pdf|last=Trixler|first=F|title=Quantum tunnelling to the origin and evolution of life.|journal=Current Organic Chemistry|date=2013|volume=17|number=16|pages=1758–1770|doi=10.2174/13852728113179990083|pmid=24039543|pmc=3768233}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research could have a profound impact on our understanding of the suite of molecules that were present in the molecular cloud when our solar system formed, which contributed to the rich carbon chemistry of comets and asteroids and hence the meteorites and interstellar dust particles which fall to the Earth by the ton every day.

The sparseness of interstellar and interplanetary space results in some unusual chemistry, since [[Woodward–Hoffmann rules|symmetry-forbidden]] reactions cannot occur except on the longest of timescales. For this reason, molecules and molecular ions which are unstable on Earth can be highly abundant in space, for example the [[Protonated molecular hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] ion. Astrochemistry overlaps with [[astrophysics]] and [[nuclear physics]] in characterizing the nuclear reactions which occur in stars, the consequences for [[stellar evolution]], as well as stellar 'generations'. Indeed, the nuclear reactions in stars produce every naturally occurring chemical element. As the stellar 'generations' advance, the mass of the newly formed elements increases. A first-generation star uses elemental hydrogen (H) as a fuel source and produces [[helium]] (He). Hydrogen is the most abundant element, and it is the basic building block for all other elements as its nucleus has only one [[proton]]. Gravitational pull toward the center of a star creates massive amounts of heat and pressure, which cause [[nuclear fusion]]. Through this process of merging nuclear mass, heavier elements are formed. [[Carbon]],  [[oxygen]] and [[silicon]] are examples of elements that form in stellar fusion. After many stellar generations, very heavy elements are formed (e.g. [[iron]] and [[lead]]).

In October 2011, scientists reported that [[cosmic dust]] contains [[organic compound|organic]] matter ("amorphous organic solids with a mixed [[aromatic]]-[[aliphatic]] structure") that could be created naturally, and rapidly, by [[stars]].&lt;ref name="Space-20111026"&gt;{{cite web |last=Chow |first=Denise |title=Discovery: Cosmic Dust Contains Matter from Stars |url=http://www.space.com/13401-cosmic-star-dust-complex-organic-compounds.html |date=26 October 2011 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=2011-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ScienceDaily-20111026"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[ScienceDaily]] Staff |title=Astronomers Discover Complex Organic Matter Exists Throughout the Universe |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111026143721.htm |date=26 October 2011 |publisher=[[ScienceDaily]] |accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature-20111026"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kwok |first1=Sun |last2=Zhang |first2=Yong |title=Mixed aromatic–aliphatic organic nanoparticles as carriers of unidentified infrared emission features |date=26 October 2011 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |doi=10.1038/nature10542 |bibcode=2011Natur.479...80K |pmid=22031328 |volume=479 |issue=7371 |pages=80–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 29, 2012, and in a world first, astronomers at [[Copenhagen University]] reported the detection of a specific sugar molecule, [[glycolaldehyde]], in a distant star system. The molecule was found around the [[protostar|protostellar]] binary ''IRAS 16293-2422'', which is located {{nowrap|400 light years}} from Earth.&lt;ref name="NG-20120829"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sugar Found In Space |journal=National Geographic |last=Than |first=Ker |date=August 29, 2012 |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/08/120829-sugar-space-planets-science-life/ |accessdate=August 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP-20120829"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Sweet!

In September, 2012, [[NASA]] scientists reported that [[polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons|polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)]], subjected to [[Interstellar medium|interstellar medium (ISM)]] conditions, are transformed, through [[hydrogenation]], [[Oxygenate|oxygenation]] and [[hydroxylation]], to more complex [[Organic compound|organics]] - "a step along the path toward [[amino acids]] and [[nucleotides]], the raw materials of [[proteins]] and [[DNA]], respectively".&lt;ref name="Space-20120920"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=NASA Cooks Up Organics to Mimic Life's Origins |url=http://www.space.com/17681-life-building-blocks-nasa-organic-molecules.html |date=September 20, 2012 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AJL-20120901"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gudipati |first1=Murthy S. |last2=Yang |first2=Rui |title=In-Situ Probing Of Radiation-Induced Processing Of Organics In Astrophysical Ice Analogs—Novel Laser Desorption Laser Ionization Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectroscopic Studies |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/2041-8205/756/1/L24 |date=September 1, 2012 |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Letters]] |volume=756 |doi=10.1088/2041-8205/756/1/L24 |accessdate=September 22, 2012 |bibcode=2012ApJ...756L..24G |issue=1 |pages=L24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, as a result of these transformations, the PAHs lose their [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic signature]] which could be one of the reasons "for the lack of PAH detection in [[interstellar ice]] [[Cosmic dust#Dust grain formation|grains]], particularly the outer regions of cold, dense clouds or the upper molecular layers of [[protoplanetary disks]]."&lt;ref name="Space-20120920" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AJL-20120901" /&gt;

The '''Biblical Archaeology Society''' is a non-denominational organization that supports and promotes [[biblical archaeology]]. It publishes ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]''. Its past publications included ''[[Bible Review]]'' (1985–2005) and ''Archaeology Odyssey'' (1998–2006). The Biblical Archaeology Society also publishes books about biblical archaeology aimed at a general readership. The Society has, for more than 30 years, run seminars and tours offering an opportunity to learn directly from world-renowned archaeologists and scholars. It also produces videos (DVD) and CDs on archaeology and biblical archaeology.

The society was founded by [[Hershel Shanks]] in 1975 and he served as editor for 42 years, retiring at the end of 2017. Robert R. Cargill was selected to replace Shanks as editor of the Society and associated publications.

The Biblical Archaeology Society has been at the center of several controversies. 

In 1991, the Biblical Archaeology Society published ''A Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls'', making the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] available to scholars around the world. Previously, access to the scrolls was limited to a small team of specialists who had been invited to translate them.

At a 2002 press conference co-hosted with the [[Discovery Channel]], the Biblical Archaeology Society announced the existence of the [[James Ossuary]]. Some critics have alleged that the ossuary, which may have once held the remains of [[James, brother of Jesus|James]], the brother of [[Jesus]], is a forgery. During the forgery trial, which lasted for several years, Shanks remained a staunch defender of the ossuary. On March 14, 2012, the defendants were acquitted of all charges of forgery because the ossuary's authenticity could not be determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Lorenzi, Rossella | title = Trial Does Not Settle 'Brother of Jesus' Controversy | work = Discovery News | date = March 14, 2012 | url = http://news.discovery.com/history/archaeology/james-ossuary-120314.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''binary moment diagram (BMD)''' is a generalization of the [[binary decision diagram]] (BDD) to linear functions over domains such as booleans (like BDDs), but also to integers or to real numbers.

They can deal with boolean functions with complexity comparable to BDDs, but also some functions that are dealt with very inefficiently in a BDD are handled easily by BMD, most notably [[multiplication]].

The most important properties of BMD is that, like with BDDs, each function has exactly one canonical representation, and many operations can be efficiently performed on these representations.

The main features that differentiate BMDs from BDDs are using linear instead of pointwise diagrams, and having weighted edges.

The rules that ensure the canonicity of the representation are:
* Decision over variables higher in the ordering may only point to decisions over variables lower in the ordering.
* No two nodes may be identical (in normalization such nodes all references to one of these nodes should be replaced be references to another)
* No node may have all decision parts equivalent to 0 (links to such nodes should be replaced by links to their always part)
* No edge may have weight zero (all such edges should be replaced by direct links to&amp;nbsp;0)
* Weights of the edges should be [[coprime]]. Without this rule or some equivalent of it, it would be possible for a function to have many representations, for example 2''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2 could be represented as 2&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x'') or 1&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;(2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2''x'').

== Pointwise and linear decomposition ==

In pointwise decomposition, like in BDDs, on each branch point we store result of all branches separately.  An example of such decomposition for an integer function (2''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y'') is:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} \text{if } x
\begin{cases}
 \text{if } y , 3
\\
 \text{if } \neg y , 2
\end{cases}
\\ 
 \text{if } \neg x
\begin{cases}
 \text{if } y \text{ , } 1
\\
 \text{if } \neg y \text{ , } 0
\end{cases}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

In linear decomposition we provide instead a default value and a difference:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
\text{always} 
\begin{cases}
\text{always } 0 \\
\text{if } y , +1
\end{cases}
\\
\text{if } x , +2
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

It can easily be seen that the latter (linear) representation is much more efficient in case of additive functions, as when we add many elements the latter representation will have only O(''n'') elements, while the former (pointwise), even with sharing, exponentially many.

== Edge weights ==

Another extension is using weights for edges. A value of function at given node is a sum of the true nodes below it (the node under always, and possibly the decided node) times the edges' weights.

For example, &lt;math&gt;(4x_2 + 2x_1 + x_0) (4y_2 + 2y_1 + y_0)&lt;/math&gt; can be represented as:
# Result node, always 1&amp;times; value of node 2, if &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt; add 4&amp;times; value of node 4
# Always 1&amp;times; value of node 3, if &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; add 2&amp;times; value of node 4
# Always 0, if &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; add 1&amp;times; value of node 4
# Always 1&amp;times; value of node 5, if &lt;math&gt;y_2&lt;/math&gt; add +4
# Always 1&amp;times; value of node 6, if &lt;math&gt;y_1&lt;/math&gt; add +2
# Always 0, if &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt; add +1

Without weighted nodes a much more complex representation would be required:
# Result node, always value of node 2, if &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt; value of node 4
# Always value of node 3, if &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; value of node 7
# Always 0, if &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; value of node 10
# Always value of node 5, if &lt;math&gt;y_2&lt;/math&gt; add +16
# Always value of node 6, if &lt;math&gt;y_1&lt;/math&gt; add +8
# Always 0, if &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt; add +4
# Always value of node 8, if &lt;math&gt;y_2&lt;/math&gt; add +8
# Always value of node 9, if &lt;math&gt;y_1&lt;/math&gt; add +4
# Always 0, if &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt; add +2
# Always value of node 11, if &lt;math&gt;y_2&lt;/math&gt; add +4
# Always value of node 12, if &lt;math&gt;y_1&lt;/math&gt; add +2
# Always 0, if &lt;math&gt;y_0&lt;/math&gt; add +1

'''BioCity Nottingham''' is a bioscience [[science park]] in central [[Nottingham]] in the United Kingdom. It is the UK's largest bioscience innovation and incubation centre.

==History==
In 2002, laboratories and office space were donated to [[Nottingham Trent University]] by BASF. Biocity was founded in September 2003 by the University of Nottingham, Nottingham Trent University (NTU) and the [[East Midlands Development Agency]] (which was based close to BioCity).

Biocity's premises were developed from the building donated by BASF. Phase 1 was completed in March 2004, providing {{convert|36000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of space, then Phase 2 in March 2006 provided {{convert|24000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. When Phase 3 of the development was completed in October 2008, with {{convert|45000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}, funding from emda also finished.

===Background===
Nottingham has long been an important centre for bioscience research, principally through work done at the University of Nottingham, Nottingham Trent University and by [[Boots UK|Boots]], Britain's largest retail [[pharmacy]] company, which is based in [[Dunkirk, Nottingham|Dunkirk]]/[[Beeston, Nottinghamshire|Beeston]]. Although Boots no longer engages in drug discovery, [[Ibuprofen]] (iso-butyl-propanoic-phenolic acid) was created by Boots scientists in Nottingham.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.york.ac.uk/enterprise/cetle/resources/WRCE/Case%20Study%20-%20Boots%20the%20Chemist.pdf Boots ibuprofen project] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001172448/http://www.york.ac.uk/enterprise/cetle/resources/WRCE/Case%20Study%20-%20Boots%20the%20Chemist.pdf |date=1 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2005 Nottingham was named as a Science City; the other 5 Science Cities were [[Birmingham]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birminghamsciencecity.co.uk/about-us/ About Us at Birmingham Science City]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bristol]], [[York]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncl.ac.uk/about/values/partnerships/civic/sciencecity.htm Newcastle Science City] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717002747/http://www.ncl.ac.uk/about/values/partnerships/civic/sciencecity.htm |date=17 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Manchester]].

==Structure==
It is [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/318420 situated] in former [[BASF]] buildings, which previously were used by Boots as research laboratories.

The [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/948642 site] on ''[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1899769 Pennyfoot Street]'', between the [[A60 road|A60]] and [[A612 road|A612]], is for bioscience [[Small and medium enterprises|SME]]s. The University of Nottingham has the largest collaboration with companies at BioCity, with a few having links with NTU.

There are three buildings –
* Innovation Centre Building
* Stewart Adams Building – named after Dr Stewart Adams OBE, who led the team at Boots (with John Nicholson) that discovered Ibuprofen, a [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]], in 1963&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/3351540/Dr-Stewart-Adams-I-tested-ibuprofen-on-my-hangover.html Dr Stewart Adams]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Laurus Building

In January 2012 BioCity opened a second site, BioCity Scotland, resulting from the acquisition of a former MSD research facility near Glasgow.

The '''Progressive Artists' Group''', PAG, was a group of [[modern art]]ists, mainly based in [[Mumbai|Bombay]], from its formation in 1947. Though it lacked any particular style, there might be said to have been a move towards a synthesis of influences from Indian art history together with styles prevalent in Europe and North America during the first half of the 20th Century, including [[Post-Impressionist|Post-Impressionism]], [[Cubist|Cubism]] and [[Expressionistic|Expressionism]].

==History==
The Progressive Artists' Group was formed by six founder members, [[F. N. Souza]], [[S. H. Raza]],  [[M. F. Husain]], [[K. H. Ara]], [[H. A. Gade]], and [[S. K. Bakre]] (the only sculptor in the group). Others associated with the group included [[Manishi Dey]], [[Ram Kumar (artist)|Ram Kumar]], [[Akbar Padamsee]] and [[Tyeb Mehta]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ngmaindia.gov.in/sh-pag.asp National Gallery of Modern Art]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The group wished to break with the revivalist nationalism established by the [[Bengal school of art]] and to encourage an Indian avant-garde, engaged at an international level.  The Group was formed just months after the 14 August 1947 "Partition of India" and Pakistan that resulted in religious rioting and death of tens of thousands of people displaced by the new borders. The founders of the Progressive Artists Group often cite "the partition" as impetus for their desire for new standards in India, starting with their new style of art.&lt;ref&gt;Ratan Parimoo and Nalini Bhagwat: Progressive Artists Group of Bombay: An Overview over The Spirit of Late 1940s and Early 1950s [http://www.artnewsnviews.com/view-article.php?article=progressive-artists-group-of-bombay-an-overview&amp;iid=29&amp;articleid=800]&lt;/ref&gt;  Their intention was to "paint with absolute freedom for content and technique, almost anarchic, save that we are governed by one or two sound elemental and eternal laws, of aesthetic order, plastic co-ordination and colour composition."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saffronart.com/sitepages/ArticleDetails.aspx?Articleid=9&amp;pageno=1 Overview of India Art: Progressive Artists Group]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, [[Vasudeo S. Gaitonde]], [[Prafulla Dahanukar]], [[Krishen Khanna]] and [[Mohan Samant]] joined the Group. Following the departure of the two main founders Souza and Raza from India few years later, S.K. Bakre also left the group, which ultimately disbanded in 1956.

European [[Modernism]] was the most distinctive influence on the group, but its members worked in dramatically different styles, from the Expressionism of Souza to the pure abstraction of Gaitonde. Specific Indian imagery and landscapes were also adopted, particularly by Mehta and Husain. Through the incorporation and mixture of new, abstract styles with traditional Indian art elements and Media, the PAG is one of the most influential art movements in India until today. 
In 2015, F.N. Souza's painting "Birth" set a new record for Indian art with a hammer price above US$ 4 Mio, which shows the worldwide appeal of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/souzas-birth-sets-new-record-sells-for-4-m-at-christies/138070/ | title=Souza’s ‘Birth’ sets new record, sold for $4 m at Christie’s | newspaper=Financial Express | date=19 September 2015 | accessdate=9 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15627">A '''calcium spark''' is the microscopic release of calcium ([[calcium|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]]) from a store known as the [[Sarcoplasmic reticulum|sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)]], located within [[myocytes|muscle cells]].&lt;ref&gt;Cheng H., Lederer W.J., Cannell M.B. 1993. Calcium sparks: elementary events underlying excitation-contraction coupling in heart muscle. Science. 262:740–744 10.1126/science.8235594&lt;/ref&gt; This release occurs through an [[ion channel]] within the [[lipid bilayer|membrane]] of the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum|SR]], known as a [[Ryanodine receptor|ryanodine receptor (RyR)]], which opens upon activation.&lt;ref&gt;Lanner, J.T., Georgiou, D.K., Joshi, A.D. and Hamilton, S.L. (2010) 'Ryanodine receptors: Structure, expression, molecular details, and function in calcium release', 2(11)&lt;/ref&gt; This process is important as it helps to maintain Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration within the [[cells|cell]]. It also initiates [[muscle contraction]] in [[skeletal muscle|skeletal]] and [[cardiac muscle]]s and [[muscle relaxation]] in [[smooth muscles]]. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sparks are important in physiology as they show how Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; can be used at a subcellular level, to signal both local changes, known as local control,&lt;ref&gt;Cannell, M. and Kong, C. (2011) 'Local control in cardiac E-C coupling', Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology, 52(2), pp. 298–303.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as whole cell changes.

==Activation==
As mentioned above, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sparks depend on the opening of ryanodine receptors, of which there are three types:
* [[RYR1|Type 1]] – found mainly in skeletal muscle 
* [[Ryanodine receptor 2|Type 2]] – found mainly in the heart 
* [[RYR3|Type 3]] – found mainly in the brain 
Opening of the channel allows Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to pass from the [[Sarcoplasmic reticulum|SR]], into the cell. This increases the local Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration around the RyR, by a factor of 10.&lt;ref&gt;Hoang-Trong, T.M., Ullah, A. and Jafri, S.M. (2015) 'Calcium sparks in the heart: Dynamics and regulation', 6&lt;/ref&gt; Calcium sparks can either be evoked or spontaneous, as described below.
[[File:Ca2+ sparks.jpg|thumb|440x440px|Figure 1: An evoked calcium spark, in a cardiac muscle cell.]]

===Evoked===
Electrical impulses, known as [[action potentials]], travel along the cell membrane (sarcolemma) of [[muscle cells]].&lt;ref&gt;Lodish, H., Berk, A., Zipursky, L.S., Matsudaira, P., Baltimore, D. and Darnell, J. (2000) The action potential and conduction of electric impulses. Available at: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21668/ (Accessed: 11 February 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;  Located in the sarcolemma of smooth muscle cells are receptors, called dihydropyridine receptors (DHPR). In skeletal and cardiac muscle cells, however, these receptors are located within structures known as T-tubules, that are extensions of the plasma membrane penetrating deep into the cell (see figure 1).&lt;ref&gt;Brette, F. and Orchard, C. (2003) 'T-tubule function in mammalian cardiac myocytes', Circulation research., 92(11), pp. 1182–92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cheng|first=Heping|last2=Lederer|first2=W.

R. L., Dan, P. &amp; Moore, E. D. W. Distribution of proteins implicated in excitation-contraction coupling in rat ventricular myocytes. Biophys. J. 79, 2682-2691 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; and activation, by the action potential causes the DHPRs to change shape.&lt;ref&gt;Araya, R., Liberona, J., Cárdenas, J., Riveros, N., Estrada, M., Powell, J., Carrasco, M. and Jaimovich, E. (2003) 'Dihydropyridine receptors as voltage sensors for a depolarization-evoked, IP3R-mediated, slow calcium signal in skeletal muscle cells', The Journal of general physiology., 121(1), pp. 3–16&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[cardiac muscle|cardiac]] and [[smooth muscle]], activation of the DHPR  results in it forming an [[ion channel]].&lt;ref&gt;Kotlikoff, M. (2003) 'Calcium-induced calcium release in smooth muscle: The case for loose coupling', Progress in biophysics and molecular biology., 83(3), pp. 171–91.&lt;/ref&gt; This allows Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to pass into the [[myocyte|cell]], increasing the local Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration, around the RyR. When four Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; molecules bind to the RyR, it opens, resulting in a larger release of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, from the SR . This process, of using [[calcium|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] to activate release of [[calcium|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] from the [[Sarcoplasmic reticulum|SR]] is known as [[calcium-induced calcium release]].&lt;ref&gt;Fabiato A. 1983. Calcium-induced release of calcium from the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum. Am. J. Physiol. 245:C1–C14&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in skeletal muscle the DHPR touches the RyR. Therefore, the shape change of the DHPR activates the RyR directly, without the need for Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to flood into the cell first. This causes the RyR to open, allowing Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to be released from the SR.&lt;ref&gt;Meissner, G. and Lu, X. (1995) 'Dihydropyridine receptor-ryanodine receptor interactions in skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling', Bioscience reports., 15(5), pp. 399–408.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spontaneous ===
Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sparks can also occur in cells at rest (i.e. cells that have not been stimulated by an action potential). This occurs roughly 100 times every second in each cell&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and is a result of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration being too high. An increase in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; within the SR is thought to bind to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensitive sites on the inside of the RyR causing the channel to open. As well as this, a protein called [[calsequestrin]] (found within the SR) detaches from the RyR, when calcium concentration is too high, again allowing the channel to open (see [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] for more details). Similarly, a decrease in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration within the SR has also proven to lower RyR sensitivity. This is thought to be due to the calsequestrin binding more strongly to the RyR, preventing it from opening and decreasing the likelihood of a spontaneous spark.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bassani|first=J.

== Calcium after release ==
There are roughly 10,000 clusters of [[Ryanodine receptor 2|ryanodine receptors]] within a single cardiac cell, with each cluster containing around 100 ryanodine receptors.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Cheng, H. and Lederer, W. (2008) 'Calcium sparks', Physiological Reviews., 88(4), pp. 1491–545.&lt;/ref&gt; During a single spontaneous spark, when [[Calcium in biology|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] is released from the SR, the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; begins to move around the [[Cell (biology)|cell]], in the same way that the smell of perfume spreads across a room when sprayed (see [[diffusion]] for more details). As the  RyRs in the heart are activated by Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, the movement of the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; released during a spontaneous spark, can activate other neighbouring RyRs within the same cluster. However, there usually isn't enough Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; present in a single spark to reach a neighbouring cluster of [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The calcium can, however, signal back to the DHPR causing it to close and preventing further influx of calcium. This is known as [[negative feedback]].&lt;ref&gt;Sham, J. S. K. et al. Termination of Ca2+ release by a local inactivation of ryanodine receptors in cardiac myocytes. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 95, 15096-15101 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

An increase in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration within the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] or the production of a larger spark, can lead to a large enough calcium released that the neighbouring cluster can be activated by the first. This is known as spark-induced spark activation and can lead to a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; wave of calcium release spreading across the cell.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

During evoked Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sparks, all clusters of [[ryanodine receptor]]s, throughout the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] are activated at almost exactly the same time. This produces an increase in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration across the whole cell (not just locally) and is known as a whole cell Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transient. This Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; then binds to a protein, called [[troponin]], initiating contraction, through a group of proteins known as myofilaments.&lt;ref&gt;Herzberg, O., Moult, J. and James, M. (1986) 'Calcium binding to skeletal muscle troponin C and the regulation of muscle contraction', Ciba Foundation symposium., 122, pp. 120–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[smooth muscle]] cells, the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; released during a spark is used for muscle relaxation. This is because, the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; that enters the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] via the DHPR in response to the [[action potential]], stimulates both muscle contraction and calcium release from the SR. The Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; released during the spark, then activates two other [[ion channels]] on the membrane. One [[ion channel|channel]] allows [[Potassium|potassium ions]] to enter the [[Cell (biology)|cell]], whereas the other allows [[chloride ions]] to leave the [[Cell (biology)|cell]]. The result of this movement of [[ions]], is that the membrane voltage becomes more negative. This deactivates the [[Cav1.1|DHPR]] (which was activated by the positive membrane potential produced by the action potential), causing it to close and stopping the flow of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;into the cell, leading to relaxation.&lt;ref&gt;Webb, R. (2003) 'Smooth muscle contraction and relaxation', Advances in physiology education., 27, pp. 201–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Termination==
The mechanism by which SR Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release terminates is still not fully understood. Current main [[Theory|theories]] are outlined below:

===Local depletion of SR Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;===
This theory suggests that during a calcium spark, as calcium flows out of the SR, the concentration of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; within the SR becomes too low. However, this is not believed to be the case for spontaneous sparks. This is because an average spark lasts around 200 milliseconds (one fifth of a second), however researchers have produced sparks lasting longer than 200 milliseconds, therefore showing that there is still enough Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;  left within the [[Sarcoplasmic reticulum|SR]] after a 'normal' (200ms) spark.&lt;ref name="Bers, D.M. 2002 pp. 198"&gt;Bers, D.M. (2002) 'Cardiac excitation-contraction coupling: Abstract: Nature', Nature, 415(6868), pp. 198–205. doi: 10.1038/415198a.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the activation of a large number of ryanodine receptors however, as is the case during evoked sparks, the entire [[Sarcoplasmic reticulum|SR]] is depleted of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and therefore  this mechanism could still play a part in the termination of evoked calcium sparks.

===Stochastic attrition===
Despite the complicated name, this idea simply suggests that all ryanodine receptors in a cluster, and the associated dihydropyridine receptors happen to randomly close at the same time. This would not only prevent calcium release from the SR, but it would also stop the stimulus for calcium release (i.e. the flow of calcium through the DHPR).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sham, J. S. K. et al. Termination of Ca2+ release by a local inactivation of ryanodine receptors in cardiac myocytes. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 95, 15096-15101&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the large numbers of RyRs and DHPRs in a single cell, this theory seems to be unrealistic, as there is a very small probability that they would all close together at exactly the same time.&lt;ref name="Bers, D.M. 2002 pp. 198"/&gt;

===Inactivation/adaptation===
This theory suggests that after activation of the RyR and the subsequent release of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, the [[ion channel|channel]] closes briefly to recover. During this time, either the channel cannot be reopened, even if calcium is present (i.e. the RyR is inactivated) or the channel can be reopened, however more calcium is required to activate it than usual (i.e. the RyR is in an adaptation phase). This would mean that one-by-one the RyRs would close, thus ending the spark.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Sticky cluster theory ===
This theory suggests that the above three theories all play a role in preventing calcium release.&lt;ref&gt;Sobie, E.A., Dilly, K.W., Cruz, J. dos S., Lederer, J.W. and Jafri, S.M. (2002) 'Termination of cardiac ca(2+) sparks: An investigative mathematical model of calcium-induced calcium release', 83(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
Spontaneous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sparks were discovered in  [[cardiac muscle cell]]s, of rats, in 1992 by Peace Cheng and Mark B. Cannell in Jon Lederer's laboratory at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, U.S.A.

Initially the idea was rejected by the scientific journal, [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], who believed that the sparks were only present under laboratory conditions (i.e. they were artifacts), and so wouldn't  occur naturally within the body. However they were quickly recognised as being of fundamental importance to muscle [[physiology]], playing a huge role in excitation-contraction coupling.

The discovery was made possible due to improvements in [[confocal microscopy|confocal microscopes]]. This allowed for the detection of the release of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, which were highlighted using a substance known as [[fluo-3]], which caused the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to glow. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; “sparks” were so called because of the spontaneous, localised nature of the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release as well as the fact that they are the initiation event of [[excitation-contraction coupling]].

==Detection and analysis==
Because of the importance of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sparks in explaining the gating properties of [[ryanodine receptor]]s in situ (within the body), many studies have focused on improving their detectability &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|date=February 1999|title=Amplitude distribution of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sparks in confocal images: theory and studies with an automatic detection method|journal=Biophysical Journal|volume=76|issue=2|pages=606–17|doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(99)77229-2|pmc=1300067|pmid=9929467|vauthors=Cheng H, Song LS, Shirokova N|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|date=January 2005|title=Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sparks in muscle cells: interactive procedures for automatic detection and measurements on line-scan confocal images series|journal=Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine|volume=77|issue=1|pages=57–70|doi=10.1016/j.cmpb.2004.06.004|pmid=15639710|vauthors=Sebille S, Cantereau A, Vandebrouck C|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the hope that by accurately and reliably detecting all Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; spark  events, their true properties can finally help us to answer the unsolved mystery of spark termination.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11363">'''Cell physiology'''  is the biological study about the activities that take place in a cell to keep it alive. This includes, among animal cells, plant cells and microorganisms.  The term "[[physiology]]" refers to all the normal functions that take place in a living organism. All of these activities in the cell could be counted as following ; nutrition, environmental response, cell growth, cell division, reproduction and differentiation. The differences among the animal cell, plant cell and microorganisms shows the essential functional similarity even though those cells have different structures. Absorption of water by roots, production of food in the leaves, and growth of shoots towards light are examples of plant physiology. The [[heterotrophic]] metabolism of food derived from plants and animals and the use of movement to obtain nutrients (even if the organism itself remains in a relatively stationary position) are characteristic of animal physiology.

In the context of [[human physiology]], the term ''cell physiology'' often specifically applies to the physiology of [[cell membrane|membrane]] transport, [[neuron]] transmission, and (less frequently) [[muscle]] contraction. In general, these cover the digestion of food, circulation of blood, and contraction of muscles and, therefore, are important aspects of human physiology. For a more complete description of the general physiological function of human cells (as well as the cells of other life forms), see the article on [[cell biology]].

Experimental approach in cell physiology is an important aspect in cell physiology because it utilizes the experimental methods in order to solve any scientific issue related to physiology. the following examples have been studied in cellular problems by using the experimental method: First, the key of understanding cells' activities in animal, plant cells and microorganisms was studied by identified the nature of organization of cells. Second, the differences of the environment plays a role of the nature of the cell environment, cell resistance and the adjustment. Third, the nature of the cell in regulating and transporting materials into and out the cells crossing the cell membrane. Fourth, Cell foods and its inter-conversions and the mechanism of respiration process to release energy from cell's food. Fifth, the use of energy in respiration in terms of performing the variety types of work. For example, maintenance, readiness, osmotic and for manufacturing of secretions.

The relation of cell physiology to different fields of physiology such as, animal physiology, comparative animal physiology, plant physiology and molecular biology are being fundamental parts of physiology field. Animal physiology plays a role of the work of various organs of the body which those organs coordinate to integrate the animal behavior. medical men in were concerned about vertebrate organ physiology precisely with mammals, because the information provided could be beneficially applied to the physiology of human in health and diseases. it is a beneficial to work on organ physiology as a medical approach. However, the Cellular level can be used as well. In addition, Comparative animal physiology is a part of studying the function of any organ in various types of animals such as, vertebrate and invertebrate to find the fundamental relations. Plant physiology is more likely concerns about the response, nutrition, growth and reproduction of different types of plants. and Since the functioning of the animal and plant depend on the function of the cells component. All of these physiological studies have been recognized by researchers whom were interested in organisms and worked at the cellular level to solve problems at the organs levels. on the other hand, Molecular biology turns to explain the cells activities in at the molecular level.In the past time, it has been limited in studying activities of viruses and bacteria. However, now it is being extended on studying the activities of the Eukaryota cells. Molecular biology has been contributed as an aim for cell physiology by being as powerful source of mutants (this method has been applied to many issues in cell physiology) such as, transportation across the cell membrane and the nature of the membranes. However, many of the cell physiology problems have not been solved by the molecular approach.

==General characteristics of cell physiology==
There are two types of cells: [[Prokaryote]]s and [[Eukaryote]]s.

[[Prokaryotes]] first came into existence and contain no self-contained nucleus, therefore making their mechanisms much simpler compared to the later-evolved [[Eukaryotes]], which do contain a [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] enveloping the cell's [[DNA]] and nuclear [[organelles]].  Because [[virus]]es, [[viroid]]s, [[prion]]s and such (see [[Acytota]]/[[Aphanobionta]]) depend entirely on the physiology of other cells (i.e., cells containing their own physiology), the former entities are often not considered to be "living" by the biologists who study them.

All living cells, whether prokaryotes or eukaryotes, contain the following distinguishing characteristics:

* The [[genetic code]] is based on [[DNA]].
** The DNA is composed of four [[nucleotide]]s ([[deoxyadenosine]], [[deoxycytidine]], [[deoxythymidine]] and [[deoxyguanosine]]), to the exclusion of other possible deoxynucleotides.
** The genetic code is composed of three-nucleotide [[codons]], thus producing 64 different codons. Since only 20 [[amino acids]] are used, multiple codons code for the same amino acids. This structure is arbitrary and shared by all [[eukaryotes]] and [[prokaryotes]]. [[Archaea]] and [[mitochondria]] use a similar code with minor differences.
** The DNA is kept double-stranded by a template-dependent [[DNA polymerase]].
** The integrity of the DNA is maintained by a group of maintenance enzymes, including [[DNA topoisomerase]], [[DNA ligase]] and other [[DNA repair]] enzymes. The DNA is also protected by DNA-binding proteins like [[histones]].
* The genetic code is expressed via [[RNA]] intermediates, which are single-stranded. 
** RNA is produced by a DNA-dependent [[RNA polymerase]] using nucleotides similar to those of DNA with the exception of Thymidine in DNA, replaced by Uridine in RNA. 
* The genetic code is expressed into [[proteins]]. All other properties of the organism (e.g. synthesis of [[lipids]] or [[carbohydrates]]) are the result of protein [[enzymes]].
* Proteins are assembled from free [[amino acids]] by [[Translation (genetics)|translation]] of an [[mRNA]] by [[ribosomes]], [[tRNA]] and a group of related proteins. 
** Ribosomes are composed of two subunits, one big and one small.
** Each ribosomal subunit is composed of a core of [[ribosomal RNA]] surrounded by [[ribosomal proteins]].
** The RNA molecules (rRNA and tRNA) play an important role in the catalytic activity of the ribosomes
* Only 20 [[amino acids]] are used, to the exclusion of countless non-standard amino acids; only the L-[[isomer]]s are used. 
** Amino acids must be synthesized from glucose by a group of specialized enzymes; the synthesis pathways are arbitrary and conserved.
* [[Glucose]] can be used as a source of energy and [[carbon]]; only the D-[[isomer]] is used.
** [[Glycolysis]] goes through an arbitrary degradation pathway.
* [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] is used as an energy intermediate.
* The cell is surrounded by a [[cellular membrane]] composed of a [[lipid bilayer]].
* Inside the cell, the concentration of [[sodium]] is lower, and [[potassium]] is higher, than outside. This gradient is maintained by specific [[ion transporter|ion pumps]].The concentration of [[Calcium]] inside of a cell is also lower than outside. 
* The cell multiplies by duplicating all its contents followed by [[cellular division]].

The earliest ancestor of all life that is hypothesized to contain these attributes is known as the [[last common ancestor]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2183">'''Clinical Linguistics''' is a sub-discipline of [[linguistics]] that involves the application of [[Theoretical linguistics|linguistic theory]] to the field of [[Speech-Language Pathology]]. Clinical linguistics, a branch of applied linguistics, is the use of linguistics to describe, analyze, and treat language disabilities. The study of linguistic aspect of communication disorders is of relevance to a broader understanding of language and [[linguistics|linguistic]] theory.

The [[International Clinical Phonetics and Linguistics Association]] is the unofficial organization of the field, and was formed in 1991. The journal of [[Clinical Linguistics and Phonetics]] is the major research journal of the field and was founded by [[Martin J. Ball]]. 

Practitioners of clinical linguistics typically work in Speech-Language Pathology departments or linguistics departments. They conduct research with the aims of (i) improving the assessment, treatment, and analysis of disordered speech/language, and (ii) offering insights to formal linguistic theories. While the majority of clinical linguistics journals still focus only on English linguistics, there is an emerging movement toward comparative clinical linguistics across multiple languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crystal|first=David|date=2013-04-01|title=Clinical linguistics: Conversational reflections|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.3109/02699206.2012.726312|journal=Clinical Linguistics &amp; Phonetics|volume=27|issue=4|pages=236–243|doi=10.3109/02699206.2012.726312|issn=0269-9206|pmid=23339337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''cloud drop effective radius''' (alternatively '''cloud effective radius''' or '''effective radius''') is a [[weighted mean]] of the size distribution of cloud droplets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/PIP/shtml/cloud_effective_radius.shtml |title=Cloud Effective Radius |work=Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center |accessdate=3 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724155507/http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/PIP/shtml/cloud_effective_radius.shtml |archivedate=24 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was defined in 1974 by [[James E. Hansen]] and [[Larry Travis]] as the ratio of the third to the second [[moment (mathematics)|moment]] of a droplet size distribution to aid in the [[inverse problem|inversion]] of [[remote sensing|remotely sensed]] data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hansen., J.E. and L.D. Travis |title=Light scattering in planetary atmospheres |journal=[[Space Science Reviews]] |volume=16 |issue =4 |year=1974 |doi=10.1007/BF00168069 |pages=527–610 |bibcode=1974SSRv...16..527H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physically, it is an area weighted radius of the cloud drop particles.

Mathematically, this can be expressed as
&lt;math&gt;r_e = \dfrac{\int\limits_{0}^{\infty} \pi \cdot r^3 \cdot n(r)\,dr}{\int\limits_{0}^{\infty} \pi \cdot r^2 \cdot n(r)\,dr}&lt;/math&gt;.

The global effective particle radius has different values for water and ice clouds: the former is around 14 μm, whereas for ice it is around 25 μm. Studies also indicate that the effective cloud droplet radius is larger over oceans than over ground by 15%-20%. By contrast, the difference in the ice particle size over land and oceans is much smaller (only 5%).&lt;ref name = "2013stubenrauch"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1737">'''Community development planning''' consists of a public participatory and usually interactive form of [[town]] or [[neighborhood]] planning and design in which diverse community members (often termed “stakeholders”) contribute toward formulation of the goals, objectives, planning, [[Funding|fund]]/[[resource]] identification and direction, planned project [[implementation]]s and re[[evaluation]] of documented local planning policy. It is a logical “bottom-up” evolution of (formerly “top-down”) [[region]]al, [[city]] and urban planning in an era of plateaued or diminishing public resources, increasing local burdens and responsibilities and [[public activism]]. It often promotes [[public/private partnership]] as a means to harness physical development activities in support of community-defined goals.&lt;ref&gt;The Practice of Local Government Planning, 2nd Edition (the "Green Book"). 1979. International City Management Association. Washington, DC. Pages 62 and 553-599.&lt;/ref&gt; At a minimum, it seeks community consensus for proposed allocations of scarce resources among competing demands. In more vigorous application, community members access a full gamut of planning tools, shaping and being shaped by shared understanding of a complex community information base, directly informing and guiding local plan content, influencing resulting development budgets, projects and thus future [[infrastructure]] and land uses, as well as helping coordinate the work of overlapping [[jurisdiction]]s, levels of [[government]], internal and adjacent communities and various providers, such as [[Chamber of commerce|business associations]], [[utilities]] and [[school]]s.

==History==
''See also'': [[History of genomics]]

Comparative genomics has a root in the comparison of [[virus]] genomes in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=koonin/&gt; For example, small [[RNA viruses]] infecting animals ([[picornaviruses]]) and those infecting plants ([[cowpea mosaic virus]]) were compared and turned out to share significant sequence similarity and, in part, the order of their genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 12| issue = 18| pages = 7251–7267| authors = Argos, P.; Kamer, G.; Nicklin, M.J.; Wimmer, E.| title = Similarity in gene organization and homology between proteins of animal picornaviruses and a plant comovirus suggest common ancestry of these virus families| journal = Nucleic Acids Research| year = 1984| doi = 10.1093/nar/12.18.7251}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the first comparative genomic study at a larger scale was published, comparing the genomes of [[varicella-zoster virus]] and [[Epstein-Barr virus]] that contained more than 100 genes each.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 14| issue = 10| pages = 4281–4292| first1 = D.J.|last1= McGeoch

The first complete genome sequence of a cellular organism, that of ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' Rd, was published in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fleischmann R, Adams M, White O, Clayton R, Kirkness E, Kerlavage A, Bult C, Tomb J, Dougherty B, Merrick J |title=Whole-genome random sequencing and assembly of ''Haemophilus influenzae'' Rd |journal=Science |volume=269 |issue=5223 |pages=496–512 |year=1995 | doi=10.1126/science.7542800 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/269/5223/496 |pmid=7542800|bibcode = 1995Sci...269..496F }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second genome sequencing paper was of the small parasitic bacterium ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' published in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fraser |first=Claire M. |year=1995 |title=The Minimal Gene Complement of ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' |journal=Science |volume=270 |issue=5235 |pages=397–404 |doi=10.1126/science.270.5235.397 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=7569993|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 1995Sci...270..397F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from this paper, reports on new genomes inevitably became comparative-genomic studies.&lt;ref name=koonin/&gt;

The first high-resolution whole genome comparison system was developed in 1998 by Art Delcher, Simon Kasif and Steven Salzberg and applied to the comparison of entire highly related microbial organisms with their collaborators at the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR). The system is called  [[MUMmer|MUMMER]] and was described in a publication in Nucleic Acids Research in 1999. The system helps researchers to identify large rearrangements, single base mutations, reversals, tandem repeat expansions and other polymorphisms.  In bacteria, MUMMER enables the identification of polymorphisms that are responsible for virulence, pathogenicity, and anti-biotic resistance. The system was also applied to the Minimal Organism Project at TIGR and subsequently to many other comparative genomics projects.

''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', the baker's yeast, was the first [[eukaryote]] to have its complete genome sequence published in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=A. Goffeau |author2=B. G.

With the publication of the large genomes of vertebrates in the 2000s, including [[Human Genome Project|human]], the [[Japanese pufferfish]] ''[[Takifugu rubripes]]'', and [[House mouse|mouse]], precomputed results of large genome comparisons have been released for downloading or for visualization in a [[genome browser]].

[[Next-generation sequencing]] methods, which were first introduced in 2007, have produced an enormous amount of genomic data and have allowed researchers to generate multiple (prokaryotic) draft genome sequences at once. These methods can also quickly uncover [[single-nucleotide polymorphisms]], [[Insertion (genetics)|insertions]] and [[Deletion (genetics)|deletions]] by mapping [[Sequence assembly|unassembled reads]] against a well [[Genome annotation|annotated]] reference genome, and thus provide a list of possible gene differences that may be the basis for any functional variation among strains.&lt;ref name=hu/&gt;

==Evolutionary principles==
One character of biology is evolution, evolutionary theory is also the theoretical foundation of comparative genomics, and at the same time the results of comparative genomics unprecedentedly enriched and developed the theory of evolution. When two or more of the genome sequence are compared, one can deduce the evolutionary relationships of the sequences in a phylogenetic tree. Based on a variety of biological genome data and the study of vertical and horizontal evolution processes, one can understand vital parts of the gene structure and its regulatory function.

Similarity of related genomes is the basis of comparative genomics. If two creatures have a recent common ancestor, the differences between the two species genomes are evolved from the ancestors’ genome. The closer the relationship between two organisms, the higher the similarities between their genomes. If there is close relationship between them, then their genome will display a linear behaviour ([[synteny]]), namely some or all of the genetic sequences are conserved. Thus, the genome sequences can be used to identify gene function, by analyzing their homology (sequence similarity) to genes of known function.

Orthologous sequences are related sequences in different species: a gene exists in the original species, the species divided into two species, so genes in new species are orthologous to the sequence in the original species. Paralogous sequences are separated by gene cloning (gene duplication): if a particular gene in the genome is copied, then the copy of the two sequences is paralogous to the original gene. A pair of orthologous sequences is called orthologous pairs (orthologs), a pair of paralogous sequence is called collateral pairs (paralogs). Orthologous pairs usually have the same or similar function, which is not necessarily the case for  collateral pairs. In collateral pairs, the sequences tend to evolve into having different functions.

[[File:BrowserFoxp2.jpg| Human [[FOXP2]] gene and evolutionary conservation is shown in and multiple alignment (at bottom of figure) in this image from the [[UCSC Genome Browser]].  Note that conservation tends to cluster around coding regions (exons). |thumb|right]]
Comparative genomics exploits both similarities and differences in the [[proteins]], [[RNA]], and [[regulatory regions]] of different organisms to infer how [[Selection (biology)|selection]] has acted upon these elements.  Those elements that are responsible for similarities between different [[species]] should be conserved through time ([[stabilizing selection]]), while those elements responsible for differences among species should be divergent ([[Directional selection|positive selection]]).  Finally, those elements that are unimportant to the evolutionary success of the organism will be unconserved (selection is neutral).

One of the important goals of the field is the identification of the mechanisms of eukaryotic genome evolution. It is however often complicated by the multiplicity of events that have taken place throughout the history of individual lineages, leaving only distorted and superimposed traces in the genome of each living organism. For this reason comparative genomics studies of small [[model organisms]] (for example the model [[Caenorhabditis elegans]] and closely related [[Caenorhabditis briggsae]]) are of great importance to advance our understanding of general mechanisms of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stein, L.D. |year=2003 |title=The genome sequence of Caenorhabditis briggsae: a platform for comparative genomics |journal=PLoS Biology |volume=1 |issue=2 |page=E45 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0000045 |pmid=14624247 |pmc=261899|display-authors=etal}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Newly Sequenced Worm a Boon for Worm Biologists | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = e4–e4 | year = 2003 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0000044}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
Computational approaches to genome comparison have recently become a common research topic in computer science. A public collection of case studies and demonstrations is growing, ranging from whole genome comparisons to gene expression analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Cristianini N., Hahn M. |url=http://www.computational-genomics.net |title=Introduction to Computational Genomics |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-521-67191-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has increased the introduction of different ideas, including concepts from systems and control, information theory, strings analysis and data mining.&lt;ref name="smash"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pratas|first=D. |author2=Silva, R. |author3=Pinho, A. |author4=Ferreira, P. |title=An alignment-free method to find and visualise rearrangements between pairs of DNA sequences.|journal=Scientific Reports (Nature Publishing Group)|date=May 18, 2015|volume=5|pmid=25984837|doi=10.1038/srep10203|bibcode = 2015NatSR...5E0203P|page=10203 |pmc=4434998}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is anticipated that computational approaches will become and remain a standard topic for research and teaching, while multiple courses will begin training students to be fluent in both topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002245| volume = 7| issue = 10| pages = e1002245| last = Via| first = Allegra |author2=Javier De Las Rivas |author3=Teresa K.

==Polymorphisms==
===Single nucleotide polymorphisms===

SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) refers to the genome level by single nucleotide position, such as transformation or transversion mutation caused the DNA sequence polymorphism. According to the SNP in gene location, it can be divided into 3 classes: the genes code area SNP (coding - region SNPS, cSNP), gene surrounding SNP (perigenic SNPS, pSNP) and gene SNP (intergenic SNPS, iSNP). Published on February 17, 2005, the first human gene polymorphisms mapping is based on gene "linkage disequilibrium theory", using gene chip in 71 European Americans (white), African Americans (black) and the han Chinese Americans (yellow race), this research identified 1.58 million single nucleotide mutation of DNA locus, the map will help to predict the likelihood of certain diseases and make the best treatment plan, make an important step in the journey which based on gene of individualized health goals.

===Copy number polymorphism===
Before the invention of whole genome sequencing and gene chip technology, limited by high-throughput DNA genome copy number detection means, within the scope of the whole genome copy number polymorphism (copy number polymorphism, CNP), people know very little about the number and distribution. In 2004, a number of "human genome project" research bases in the world accidentally found that in the phenotypes of normal population, there are some differences in some gene copy numbers between different individuals, some people lost a lot of gene copy, while others have extra, extend the copies of the gene, the researchers call this phenomenon of “polymorphic gene copy number". It was because the CNP that caused the different between individuals such as disease, appetite and efficacy. Research shows that it has average 11 differences between 2 individuals, the average length of CNP is 465 KB, of which more than half of the CNP are repeated in more than one individual, and often in other types of chromosome rearrangement nearby.

==Classification==
===Interspecific comparative genomics===
Through the comparison of different related species genome sequence, can identify coding sequences, regulation and control of non-coding sequences and unique sequence of a given species. And within the scope of genome sequence alignment, can understand the similarities and differences in gene sequence, nucleotide composition, linear relationship of different objects, and then get the aspects of information about forecasts and positioning of genetic analysis, evolutionary relationship between biological systems.

===Intraspecific comparative genomics===
With same population in genome，there are a lot of mutation and polymorphism, because of these differences in the genome sequence constitutes the different disease susceptibility and genetic basis of different reactions to drugs and environmental factors in individuals and groups.

==Tools==

Computational tools for analyzing sequences and complete genomes are developing quickly due to the availability of large amount of genomic data. At the same time, comparative analysis tools are progressed and improved. In the challenges about these analyses, it is very important to visualize the comparative results.&lt;ref name="Humana Press"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Bergman, N.H. |title=Comparative Genomics: Volumes 1 and 2 |location=Totowa, New Jersey |publisher=Humana Press |year=2007 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1732/ |isbn=978-193411-537-4 |pmid=21250292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visualization of sequence conservation is a tough task of comparative sequence analysis. As we know, it is highly inefficient to examine the alignment of long genomic regions manually. Internet-based genome browsers provide many useful tools for investigating genomic sequences due to integrating all sequence-based biological information on genomic regions. When we extract large amount of relevant biological data, they can be very easy to use and less time-consuming.&lt;ref name="Humana Press"/&gt;

An advantage of using online tools is that these websites are being developed and updated constantly. There are many new settings and content can be used online to improve efficiency.&lt;ref name="Humana Press"/&gt;

==Applications==

===Agriculture===

Agriculture is a field that reaps the benefits of comparative genomics. Identifying the [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] of advantageous genes is a key step in breeding crops that are optimized for greater yield, cost-efficiency, quality, and disease resistance. For example, one genome wide association study conducted on 517 rice [[landrace]]s revealed 80 loci associated with several categories of agronomic performance, such as grain weight, [[amylose]] content, and drought tolerance. Many of the loci were previously uncharacterized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Huang, X.H.  |year=2010 |title=Genome-wide association studies of 14 agronomic traits in rice landraces  |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=42 |issue=11 |page=961-U76 |doi=10.1038/ng.695 |display-authors=etal}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only is this methodology powerful, it is also quick. Previous methods of identifying loci associated with agronomic performance required several generations of carefully monitored breeding of parent strains, a time consuming effort that is unnecessary for comparative genomic studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Morrell, P.L., Buckler, E.S., Ross-Ibara, J. |year=2012 |title=Crop genomics: advances and applications |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=85–96 |doi=10.1038/nrg3097}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine===
The medical field also benefits from the study of comparative genomics. Vaccinology in particular has experienced useful advances in technology due to genomic approaches to problems. In an approach known as [[reverse vaccinology]], researchers can discover candidate antigens for vaccine development by analyzing the genome of a pathogen or a family of pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Seib, K.L., Zhao, X., Rappuoli, R. |year=2012 |title=Developing vaccines in the era of genomics: a decade of reverse vaccinology |journal=Clinical Microbiology and Infection |volume=18 |issue=SI |pages=109–116 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-0691.2012.03939.x}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applying a comparative genomics approach by analyzing the genomes of several related pathogens can lead to the development of vaccines that are multiprotective. A team of researchers employed such an approach to create a universal vaccine for [[Streptococcus agalactiae|Group B Streptococcus]], a group of bacteria responsible for severe neonatal infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maione, D.  |year=2005 |title=Identification of a Universal Group B Streptococcus Vaccine by Multiple Genome Screen |journal=Science |volume=309 |issue=5731 |pages=148–150 |doi=10.1126/science.1109869 |display-authors=etal |bibcode = 2005Sci...309..148M |pmid=15994562 |pmc=1351092}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative genomics can also be used to generate specificity for vaccines against pathogens that are closely related to commensal microorganisms. For example, researchers used comparative genomic analysis of commensal and pathogenic strains of E. coli to identify pathogen specific genes as a basis for finding antigens that result in immune response against pathogenic strains but not commensal ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rasco, D.A.  |year=2008 |title=The pangenome structure of Escherichia coli: Comparative genomic analysis of E-coli commensal and pathogenic isolates  |journal=Journal of Bacteriology |volume=190 |issue=20 |pages=6881–6893 |doi=10.1128/JB.00619-08|display-authors=etal |pmid=18676672 |pmc=2566221}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===

Comparative genomics also opens up new avenues in other areas of research. As DNA sequencing technology has become more accessible, the number of sequenced genomes has grown. With the increasing reservoir of available genomic data, the potency of comparative genomic inference has grown as well. A notable case of this increased potency is found in recent primate research. Comparative genomic methods have allowed researchers to gather information about genetic variation, differential gene expression, and evolutionary dynamics in primates that were indiscernible using previous data and methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Rodgers J.; Gibbs R.A. |year=2014 |title=Applications of Next-Generation Sequencing Comparative primate genomics: emerging patterns of genome content and dynamics |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=347–359 |doi=10.1038/nrg3707|pmc=4113315 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Ape Genome Project used comparative genomic methods to investigate genetic variation with reference to the six [[Hominidae|great ape]] species, finding healthy levels of variation in their gene pool despite shrinking population size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Prado-Martinez, J.  |year=2013 |title=Great ape genetic diversity and population history |journal=Nature |volume=499 |issue=7459 |pages=471–475 |doi=10.1038/nature12228 |display-authors=etal |bibcode = 2013Natur.499..471P }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study showed that patterns of DNA methylation, which are a known regulation mechanism for gene expression, differ in the prefrontal cortex of humans versus chimps, and implicated this difference in the evolutionary divergence of the two species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Zeng, J.; Konopa, G.; Hunt, B.G.; Preuss, T.M.; Geschwind, D.; Yi, S.V. |year=2012 |title=Divergent Whole-Genome Methylation Maps of Human and Chimpanzee Brains Reveal Epigenetic Basis of Human Regulatory Evolution |journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=91 |issue=3 |pages=455–465|doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2012.07.024 |pmid=22922032 |pmc=3511995}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3660">Broadly speaking, a '''conversion narrative''' is a narrative that relates the operation of conversion, usually religious. As a specific aspect of American literary and religious history, the conversion narrative was an important facet of [[Puritan]] sacred and secular society in [[New England]] during a period stretching roughly from 1630 to the end of the [[First Great Awakening]].

==Definition==
As defined by Patricia Caldwell, the conversion narrative was "a testimony of personal religious experience…spoken or read aloud to the entire congregation of a [[gathered church]] before admission as evidence of the applicant's visible sainthood"&lt;ref name="caldwell1"&gt;Caldwell, Patricia. ''The Puritan Conversion Narrative: The Beginnings of American Expression.'' New York: Cambridge UP, 1983. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Edmund S. Morgan describes the typical "morphology of conversion" related in the conversion narrative as involving the stages of  "knowledge, conviction, faith, combat, and true, imperfect assurance."&lt;ref name="Morgan72"&gt;Morgan, Edmund S. "Visible Saints: The History of a Puritan Idea." Ithaca:Cornell UP, 1963. p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Puritan New England==
The conversion narrative was one of the distinguishing features of the Massachusetts Puritan churches; the relation of a conversion narrative emphasized their belief in "faith as the essence of the church: and they were to ensure the presence of faith in their members by a screening process that included narratives of religious experiences."&lt;ref name="Morgan104"&gt;Morgan, Edmund S. "Visible Saints: The History of a Puritan Idea." Ithaca:Cornell UP, 1963. p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; In adopting this requirement for membership, Bremer argues that the New England churches were extending the beliefs of their English brethren that "admission to the communion table should be limited to those with saving faith."&lt;ref name="Bremer106"&gt;Bremer, Francis J. "The Puritan Experiment: New England Society from Bradford to Edwards." Rev. Ed. Lebanon, New Hampshire: University Press of New England, 1995. p.106&lt;/ref&gt; As Morgan goes on to point out, the adaptation of the conversion narrative as a requirement for church membership "was as important politically as religiously, for it altered not only the character of church membership but the character of [[Freeman (Colonial)|freemanship]]."&lt;ref name="Morgan104" /&gt; Freemanship was restricted to church members and with the adaptation of this requirement for church membership, given the force of law with an act by the [[Massachusetts General Court|General Court]] in 1636, "the new system of church membership may be said to have reached full definition, legal establishment, and coordination with the civil government in Massachusetts"&lt;ref name="Morgan105"&gt;Morgan, Edmund S. "Visible Saints: The History of a Puritan Idea." Ithaca:Cornell UP, 1963. p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

A key figure in the development and adaptation of the conversion narrative to the New England Puritan churches was [[John Cotton (Puritan)|John Cotton]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9825">'''Dau al Set''' ({{IPA-ca|ˈdaw əl ˈsɛt}}), the first post-[[World War II]] artistic movement in [[Catalonia]], was founded in [[Barcelona]] in September 1948 by poet [[Joan Brossa]].  The movement, best known for translating the conscious and unconscious mind into art, was heavily influenced by both the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] and [[Dada]]ist movements. In [[Catalan language|Catalan]] Dau al Set means "the seventh face of the dice", which expresses the movement's rupturist character.

== History ==
Dau al Set first began as an [[avant-garde]] artistic collective led by [[Joan Brossa]], a Catalan poet, in  September 1948. [[Joan Brossa]] established the group in response to the period’s conservative reigning government, which gained power after the [[Spanish Civil War]] known as the "[[:es:Guerra Civil Española|Guerra Civil]]". Under the new [[Fascism|fascist]] regime, [[Francisco Franco]]  radically changed many areas of the previous culture. One such example was the Spanish art community as seen in [[art and culture in Francoist Spain]]. During this time counterculture movements in Catalonia and Spain in general came to an abrupt halt.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.macba.cat/en/revista-dau-al-set-modest-cuixart-2016|title=Revista Dau al Set. Modest Cuixart|website=www.macba.cat|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such artistic groups were replaced with [[Art and culture in Francoist Spain|Nationalist Fascist Art]], which often functioned as a means for government endorsement and propaganda. In an attempt to revive the avant-garde scene in Spain Dau al Set was formed.

In 1949, with help from [[Joan-Josep Tharrats]]'s private printing press, Dau al Set published its first self-entitled magazine journal. The majority of the publication was written in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], a language prohibited under the [[Francoist Spain|Franco Regime]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cirlot|first=Lourdes|date=December 2008|title=El grupo Dau al Set|url=http://www.triarte.es/catalogos/Cat%20Dau%20al%20Set.pdf|journal=El Mundo de Dau al Set|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dau al Set typically ran a print between one hundred and two hundred copies,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; consisting of four to twelve pages.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Franco Lahoz|first=Amado|date=December 2008|title=Sumario de la revista Dau al Set|url=http://www.triarte.es/catalogos/Cat%20Dau%20al%20Set.pdf|journal=El Mundo de Dau al Set|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine journal was delivered throughout Barcelona to those with subscriptions and served a niche population at the time. The format of the magazine was 22.5&amp;nbsp;cm x 18.7&amp;nbsp;cm in the [[broadsheet]] style and never bound.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These publications continued on a regular basis until the end of 1951 at which point Dau al Set began to dissolve.

In 1952, Dau al Set founding member [[Antoni Tàpies]] left the group to promote his own independent work in the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] and [[Informalism|Informal]] art styles. The following year [[Joan Ponç]] left to Brazil to continue to paint and spread his unique style. And one year later [[Modest Cuixart|Modest Cuixcart]] left the group as well. During this time from 1953 till 1956 Dau al Set continued to be created and published by Joan-Josep Tharrats.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During the final years the magazine decreased from an issue a month to an issue every season to then two issues a year. The final issue was created and distributed in 1956.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Style ==
Initially, Dau al Set began as an offshoot of [[Surrealism]], but slowly grew into a distinct style with many existing components. One such component began with the incorporation of the surrealist world of dreams, where in Dau al Set expands upon by combing scientific and philosophical articles with magical undertones derived from [[Joan Brossa|Joan Brossa's]] personalized style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lletra.uoc.edu/ca/revista/dau-al-set-1948-1956/detall|title=Dau al Set (1948-1956) - lletrA - Literatura catalana a internet|last=Catalunya|first=Universitat Oberta de|website=lletra.uoc.edu|language=ca|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of magical elements pervaded throughout the entire movement to showcase an esoteric world of inner exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elcultural.com/revista/arte/Dau-al-set/14686|title=Dau al set|website=www.elcultural.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; While magic was seen consistently the different members each contributed a unique style to Dau al Set. One of the most drastic was the contributions from [[Joan Ponç]]. Ponç's art frequently contained demonic images actualized with a series of different monsters throughout the work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In contrast, [[Modest Cuixart|Modest Cuixart's]] work often contained images of fantasy influenced by [[German Expressionism|German expressionism]] and [[Joan Miró]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Finally, [[Antoni Tàpies|Antoni Tápies]] often emulated the style of [[Paul Klee]] with obscure images surrounded by a dark atmosphere and phosphorescent lighting. With the base of magical elements these three unique techniques joined together to create the style seen in the Dau al Set movement.

== Influences ==
Dau al Set  was heavily influenced by two movements before its creation, those two being [[Dada]]ism and [[Surrealism]].  Dadaism was a European art movement in the early 20th century which focused on the avant-garde. This style was meant to fight against the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] in society with the belief that their reason and logic were the cause of war. With an anti-reason and anti-logic sentiment most of the works of art often contained elements of chaos and irrationality. Dadaist art also utilized the following techniques of [[cubism]], [[collage]]s, [[cut-up technique]], [[photomontage]]s, and [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]] which can be seen in Dau al Set's work. From this movement spawned the pre-war avant-garde which was the community Dau al Set were trying to revive. Some influential artists on Dau al Set from this movement are [[Francis Picabia]] and [[Max Ernst]].

Another influence on Dau al Set was [[Surrealism]], a cultural movement greatly influenced by Dadaism, which began in the 1920s. This style was often considered a portrayal of the dream world; a reality which existed right below everyday life. It also had a large political focus which was often used to contradict a given community's social norms often imposed by the bourgeois. Some artists from this movement that influenced Dau al Set were [[Joan Miró]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Josep Vicenç Foix]], and [[Salvador Dalí]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other methods that were influenced was the idea of magical aspects that were often seen in the dream world surrealism created. However, in Dau al Set these magical aspects were developed and expounded upon.

== Members ==
There were six founding members of Dau al Set including a poet [[Joan Brossa]], a philosopher [[Arnau Puig]], three artists [[Joan Ponç]], [[Antoni Tàpies]], and [[Modest Cuixart]], as well as a dual painter and editor [[Joan-Josep Tharrats]].

Over the years Dau al Set ran there were occasional contributors, such as [[Juan Eduardo Cirlot]], [[Antonio Saura]], [[Enrique Tábara]], and [[Manolo Millares]]. Their contributions came often in the form of writings which helped to continued to establish Dau al Set as an intellectual piece of work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Impact ==
Dau al Set has had a lasting impact throughout history the most notable being the continuation of the avant-garde in Spain throughout a repressive regime. Moreover, Dau al Set contributed to the creation of the [[Informalism|Informalist]] movement seen in Spain during the fifties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arteespana.com/grupodaualset.htm|title=Grupo Dau al Set|website=www.arteespana.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also the magical and fantasy elements of Dau al Set was seen to later emerge again in Spain in the eighties.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This group also stood as a large influence for other artistic movements in Spain such as the [[Grup d'Elx|Grup d’Elx]] and El Paso, with important artists such as [[Joan Castejón]], [[Eusebio Sempere]] or [[Manolo Millares]]. Additionally, each of the members made their own impacts after the movement was dissolved. Most notably is [[Antoni Tàpies]] who continued with his style based heavily in surrealism and later became a notable artist for his work in Abstract art.

'''Depyrogenation''' refers to the removal of pyrogens from solution, most commonly from injectable pharmaceuticals.

A [[wikt:pyrogen|pyrogen]] is defined as any substance that can cause a fever. Bacterial pyrogens include [[endotoxins]] and [[exotoxins]], although many pyrogens are endogenous to the host. Endotoxins include [[lipopolysaccharide]] (LPS) molecules found as part of the cell wall of [[Gram-negative]] bacteria, and are released upon bacterial cell [[lysis]]. Endotoxins may become pyrogenic when released into the bloodstream or other tissue where they are not usually found. Although the colon contains Gram-negative bacteria in abundance, they do not cause a pyrogenic effect as the bacteria are not undergoing gross lysis, and the immune system is not exposed to free endotoxin while the colonic wall is intact.

When LPS is released upon bacterial cell lysis, the lipid A component is first bound by serum LPS-Binding Protein (LBP) and then transferred to CD14 (either free CD14 in the serum or bound to the cell surface of macrophages or monocytes). This monomerises the aggregated LPS, as the LPS receptor Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4) cannot recognise LPS while aggregated. Monomeric LPS is then transferred to MD-2 pre-complexed with TLR4 on [[macrophages]] and [[monocytes]]. This leads to release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide, which may lead ultimately to septic shock depending on the strength of response. Vascular [[endothelial]] cells also express TLR4 and MD-2 and so respond to LPS directly, as well as via cytokines and nitric oxide. Bronchial epithelial cells and colonic epithelial cells also express TLR4, but as they do not express MD-2 they rely on LPS precomplexed with serum MD-2 in order to signal to LPS.

== Maximum acceptable endotoxin level ==
Because endotoxin molecular weight may vary a great deal (10,000 to 1,000,000 Da), endotoxin levels are measured in "endotoxin units" (EU). One EU is approximately equivalent to 100 pg of E. coli lipopolysaccharide—the amount present in around 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; bacteria. Humans can develop symptoms when exposed to as little as 5 EU/kg body weight. These symptoms include, but are not limited to, fever, low blood pressure, increased heart rate, and low urine output; and even small doses of endotoxin in the blood stream are often fatal.

The [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] has set the following maximum permissible endotoxin levels for drugs distributed in the United States:
* Drug (injectable, [[intrathecal]]) - 0.2 EU/kg body weight
* Drug (injectable, non-intrathecal) - 5 EU/kg body weight
* Sterile water - 0.25-0.5 EU/ml (depends on intended use)

== Pyrogen detection ==

=== Rabbit Test ===
Early endotoxin detection was accomplished by injecting rabbits with the sample and observing the response in their body temperature. Rabbits have similar endotoxin tolerance to humans, and were thus an ideal choice. However, this method was costly, time consuming, and prompted protests from animals rights advocates. But perhaps the biggest drawback of this test was its inability to quantify the endotoxin level.

=== [[Limulus Amebocyte Lysate|LAL test]] ===
Currently, one common method for endotoxin detection is the [[Limulus Amebocyte Lysate]] (LAL) test. This test is based on Dr. Frederik Bang's [https://web.archive.org/web/20061010205452/http://commprojects.jhsph.edu/sphheros/default.cfm?detail=17] observation that horseshoe crab blood forms clots when exposed to endotoxins. Amoebocyte extract from horseshoe crab blood is mixed with a sample suspected of endotoxin contamination, and a reaction is observed if endotoxins are present. The FDA has approved four variations of the LAL test: gel-clot, turbidimetric, colorimetric, and chromogenic assay. The differences in these variations refer to the characteristics of the amoebocyte/endtoxin reaction (e.g. gel-clot produces a precipitate and colorimetric changes color). This test is fast (approx. 30 minutes) and highly sensitive (up to 0.001 EU/ml sensitivity). However, because it only detects LPS endotoxins, some pyrogenic materials can be missed. Also, certain conditions (sub-optimal pH conditions or unsuitable [[cation]] concentration) can lead to false negatives. [[Glucans]] from carbohydrate chromatography matrices can also lead to false positives.

Since 2003, a synthetic substitute for the LAL test has been commercially available. It is based on the [[Limulus clotting factor C]] protein, produced by genetically modified insect gut cells. The adoption of this test was slow, which began to change in 2016 when the [[European Pharmacopoeia|European Pharmacopeia]] listed this test as an accepted bacterial-toxin test.

=== Monocyte Activation Test ===
The [[Monocyte Activation Test]] (MAT) uses the [[monocyte]]s in human blood ''[[in vitro]]'' to detect pyrogens. It was added to the European Pharmacopeia in 2010 and accepted by the FDA in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/guidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM310098.pdf Guidance for Industry Pyrogen and Endotoxins Testing: Questions and Answers], FDA, June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pyrogen removal (depyrogenation) ==
Pyrogens can often be difficult to remove from solution due to the high variability of their molecular weight. Pyrogens are also relatively thermally stable and insensitive to pH changes. However, several removal techniques exist [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282704534_A_Practical_Approach_to_Depyrogenation_Studies_Using_Bacterial_Endotoxin].

'''[[Ion exchange chromatography]]'''

Endotoxins are negatively charged, and will bind to an ''[[anion exchanger]]''. If the target substance is not also negatively charged, it will pass through the column before the endotoxin, and an effective separation can be achieved. This method is sometimes used in the purification of [[albumins]] (details follow). [[Ligands]] of known affinity to endotoxins can be coupled to an anion exchange system to increase its endotoxin binding strength and further improve the purity of the final product. Typical examples of endotoxin binding ligands include [[histamine]], nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds, and [[polymyxin B]]. However, [[polymyxin B]] is known to induce production of interleukin-1, an exogenous pyrogen, and thus must be shown to be absent in the final product if used.

Example of using [[anion exchange chromatography]] to purify albumin (Uppsala):
* 2% of the endotoxin ''does not'' bind to the column. However, this 2% washes out before the albumin peak, and can thus be removed simply by starting collection after this 2% has washed out.
* 10% of the endotoxin that ''does'' bind to the column (9.8% of the original total) will eventually wash out after the albumin peak. This can be prevented from entering the final product by stopping collection before this happens.
* The remaining 90% of the bound endotoxin (88.2% of the original total) must be cleaned off the column using NaOH

An alternative to anion exchange is ''[[cation exchange]] chromatography'', in which positively charged solutes bind to the solid chromatographic media. In this method, the target binds to the column instead of the endotoxin. The endotoxin then washes through the column, and a pure target is later eluted off the column. Cation exchange chromatography has been shown to effectively purify β-interferon. (Dembinski, et al.)

'''[[Ultrafiltration]]'''

Because the molecular weight of endotoxins is usually over 10 kD, ultrafiltration can sometimes be used to perform as a size based separation. Due to the high variability of endotoxin size, it can be difficult to select the correct membrane, hence this method is best used only when all endotoxins present are larger than 300,000 Da. Commercially available ultra filters have been shown to remove pyrogens to a level below 0.001 EU/ml.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

'''[[Distillation]]'''

This method is also based on the large molecular weight and heat stability of endotoxins. Low molecular-weight solvents can be easily purified by boiling and collecting the condensed vapor in an endotoxin free vessel (see "heating" below). The large LPS molecules do not easily vaporize, and are thus left behind in the heating vessel. This is the method of choice for the purification of water.

== Inactivation/destruction ==
Because pyrogens are often difficult to remove, inactivation or destruction of the LPS molecule can sometimes be preferable.

'''Acid-base [[hydrolysis]]''' 
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Endo3.jpeg|right]] --&gt;
This method has been shown to cleave Lipid A from the polysaccharide in the LPS molecule (see right). The [[lipid]] moiety alone is not soluble in water. Thus unable to bind to [[endothelial]] cells, it is rendered inactive. However, acid-base hydrolysis can denature a target protein, and is thus unsuitable when purifying a protein.

'''[[Oxidation]]'''

Oxidation using hydrogen peroxide is often used as a low cost pyrogen destroying solution. The mechanism for this destruction is unknown, but hydrogen peroxide can easily be removed further downstream in the purification process, and is therefore a useful method of pyrogen removal. However, like acid-base hydrolysis, it is not suitable when purifying proteins.

'''Heating'''

Heating methods are often used to ensure that glass and other lab equipment are free of pyrogenic material. Heat is applied by baking in a dry heat oven that is designed specifically for the depyrogenation process. Although endotoxins are relatively thermally stable, sufficient heating (250&amp;nbsp;°C for 30 min) results in a [[Log reduction|3-log reduction]] of endotoxin levels. Due to the high temperature levels, this method is also not suitable when purifying proteins.

'''Sodium Hydroxide'''

When purifying proteins, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) can be used safely and effectively. It is also widely used for depyrogenation of non-autoclavable equipment (e.g. plastics) and chromatography columns. In fact, when using an anion exchanger to remove pyrogens, it is necessary to clean the column with NaOH after each batch.

== Preventive methods ==
Because virtually all raw materials involved in a production process, including factory employees, can be potential sources of pyrogen contamination, raw material screening and depyrogenation can often go a long way to ensuring the final product is free of pyrogens and does not require costly removal or inactivation methods. Ultrafiltration of chemicals and buffer solutions, applying appropriate hygienic practices, and performing regular tests can all be helpful.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8719">Cell polarity is a fundamental feature of many types of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s.  Epithelial cells are one example of a polarized cell type, featuring distinct 'apical', 'lateral' and 'basal' [[plasma membrane]] domains. Epithelial cells connect to one another via their lateral membranes to form [[epithelia|epithelial sheets]] that line cavities and surfaces throughout the animal body.  Each plasma membrane domain has a distinct protein composition, giving them distinct properties and allowing directional transport of molecules across the epithelial sheet.  How epithelial cells generate and maintain polarity remains unclear, but certain molecules have been found to play a key role.

A variety of molecules are located at the apical membrane, but only a few key molecules act as determinants that are required to maintain the identity of the apical membrane and, thus, epithelial polarity.  These molecules are the proteins [[Cdc42]], [[Protein kinase C|atypical protein kinase C]] (aPKC), [[PARD6A|Par6]], [[PARD3|Par3]]/Bazooka/ASIP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Izumi Y, Hirose T, Tamai Y, Hirai S, Nagashima Y, Fujimoto T, Tabuse Y, Kemphues KJ, Ohno S |title=An Atypical PKC Directly Associates and Colocalizes at the Epithelial Tight Junction with ASIP, a Mammalian Homologue of ''Caenorhabditis elegans'' Polarity Protein PAR-3|journal=J Cell Biol|volume=143|issue=1|pages=95–106|year=1998|id=|pmid=9763423|pmc=2132825|doi=10.1083/jcb.143.1.95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crumbs, "Stardust" and protein at tight junctions (PATJ).  These molecules appear to form two distinct complexes: an aPKC-Par3-Par6 "aPKC" (or "Par") complex that also interacts with Cdc42; and a Crumbs-Stardust-PATJ "Crumbs" complex.  Of these two complexes, the aPKC complex is the most important for epithelial polarity, being required even when the Crumbs complex is not.  Crumbs is the only transmembrane protein in this list and the Crumbs complex serves as an apical cue to keep the aPKC complex apical during complex cellular shape changes.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Basolateral membranes==
In the context of [[renal tubule]] physiology, the term '''basolateral membrane''' or '''serosal membrane''' refers to the [[cell membrane]] which is oriented ''away'' from the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the tubule, whereas the term '''luminal membrane''' or '''apical membrane''' refers to the [[cell membrane]] which is oriented ''towards'' the lumen.  The principal function of this basolateral membrane is to take up [[metabolic]] waste products into the [[epithelial cell]] for disposal into the lumen where it is transported out of the body as [[urine]].  A secondary role of the basolateral membrane is to allow the recycling of desirable substrates, such as [[glucose]], that have been rescued from the lumen of the tubule to be secreted into the [[interstitial fluid]]s.&lt;ref

name="pmid16403838"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sekine T, Miyazaki H, Endou H | title = Molecular physiology of renal organic anion transporters | journal = Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. | volume = 290 | issue = 2 | pages = F251–61 |date=February 2006 | pmid = 16403838 | doi = 10.1152/ajprenal.00439.2004 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Basal and lateral membranes share common determinants, the proteins Lethal Giant Larvae (Lgl), Discs Large (Dlg) and Scribble (Scrib).  These three proteins all localize to the basolateral domain and are essential for basolateral identity and for epithelial polarity.

==Mechanisms of polarity==
How epithelial cells polarize is still not fully understood.  Some key principles have been proposed to maintain polarity, but the mechanisms behind these principles remain to be discovered.

The first principle is [[positive feedback]].  In computer models, a molecule that can be either membrane-associated or cytoplasmic can polarize when its association with the membrane is subject to positive feedback: that membrane localization occurs most strongly where the molecule is already most highly concentrated.  In the yeast [[saccharomyces cerevisiae]], there is genetic evidence that Cdc42 is subject to positive feedback of this kind and can spontaneously polarize, even in the absence of an external cue.  In the fruit fly [[Drosophila melanogaster]], Cdc42 is recruited by the aPKC complex and then promotes the apical localization of the aPKC complex in a probable positive feedback loop.  Thus, in the absence of Cdc42 or the aPKC complex, apical determinants cannot be maintained at the apical membrane and consequently apical identity and polarity is lost.

The second principle is segregation of polarity determinants.  The sharp distinction between apical and baso-lateral domains is maintained by an active mechanism that prevents mixing.  The nature of this mechanism is not known, but it clearly depends on the polarity determinants.  In the absence of the aPKC complex, the baso-lateral determinants spread into the former apical domain.  Conversely, in the absence of any of Lgl, Dlg or Scrib, the apical determinants spread into the former baso-lateral domain.  Thus, the two determinants behave as if they exert mutual repulsion upon one another.

The third principle is directed [[exocytosis]].  Apical membrane proteins are trafficked from the Golgi to the apical, rather than baso-lateral, membrane because apical determinants serve to identify the correct destination for [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicle]] delivery.  A related mechanism is likely to operate for the baso-lateral membranes.

The fourth principle is lipid modification.  A component of the lipid bilayer, [[phosphatidyl inositol]] phosphate (PIP) can be phosphorylated to form PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.  In some epithelial cells, PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is apically localised while PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is basolaterally localised.  In at least one cultured cell line, the MDCK cell, this system is required for epithelial polarity.  The relationship between this system and the polarity determinants in animal tissues remains unclear.

==Basal versus lateral==
Since basal and lateral membranes share the same determinants, another mechanism must make the difference between the two domains.  Cell shape and contacts provide the likely mechanism.  Lateral membranes are the site of contact between epithelial cells, whereas basal membranes connect epithelial cells to the [[basement membrane]], an extracellular matrix layer that lies along the basal surface of the epithelium.  Certain molecules, such as [[Integrin]]s, localise specifically to the basal membrane and form connections with the extracellular matrix.

==Epithelial cell shape==
Epithelial cells come in a variety of [[epithelia|shapes]] that relate to their function in development or physiology.  How epithelial cells adopt particular shapes is poorly understood, but it must involve spatial control of the [[actin|actin cytoskeleton]], which is central to cell shape in all plant cells.

==Epithelial cadherin ==
All epithelial cells express the transmembrane [[adhesion molecule]] [[E-cadherin]], a [[cadherin]] which localises most prominently to the junction between the apical and lateral membranes.  The extra-cellular domains of E-cadherin molecules from neighbouring cells bind to one another via a homotypic interaction.  The intra-cellular domains of E-cadherin molecules bind to the [[actin|actin cytoskeleton]] via the adaptor proteins [[alpha-catenin]] and [[beta-catenin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Knudsen KA, Soler AP, Johnson KR, Wheelock MJ |title=Interaction of alpha-actinin with the cadherin/catenin cell-cell adhesion complex via alpha-catenin |journal=J. Cell Biol. |volume=130 |issue=1 |pages=67–77 |date=July 1995 |pmid=7790378 |pmc=2120515 |url=http://www.jcb.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7790378 |doi=10.1083/jcb.130.1.67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, E-cadherin forms [[adherens junctions]] that connect the actin cytoskeletons of neighbouring cells.  Adherens junctions are the primary force-bearing junctions between epithelial cells and are fundamentally important for maintaining epithelial cell shape and for dynamic changes in shape during tissue development.  How E-cadherin localizes to the boundary between apical and lateral membranes is not known, but polarized membranes are essential for maintaining E-cadherin at adherens junctions.

{{God}}
'''Fideism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|iː|d|eɪ|ɪ|z|əm|,_|ˈ|f|aɪ|d|i|-}}) is an [[epistemology|epistemological theory]] which maintains that [[faith]] is independent of [[reason]], or that reason and faith are hostile to each other and faith is superior at arriving at particular [[truth]]s (see [[natural theology]]). The word ''fideism'' comes from ''fides'', the Latin word for [[faith]], and literally means "faith[[-ism]]".{{Sfn | Amesbury | 2005}}

[[Theology|Theologians]] and [[Philosophy|philosophers]] have responded in various ways to the place of faith and reason in determining the truth of [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] [[idea]]s, [[morality]], and [[religious belief]]s. A fideist is one who argues for fideism. Historically, fideism is most commonly ascribed to four philosophers: [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], [[Kierkegaard]], [[William James]], and [[Wittgenstein]]; with fideism being a label applied in a negative sense by their opponents, but which is not always supported by their own ideas and works or followers.{{Sfn | Amesbury | 2005 | loc = [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fideism/#2.2  section 2.2]}}  There are a number of different forms of fideism.&lt;ref name = Quinn2000&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Quinn | editor-first = Philip L | last = Taliaferro | first = Charles | year = 2000 | title = A companion to philosophy of religion | page = 376 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=9X-3sPj9m34C&amp;pg=PA376 | isbn = 0-631-21328-7 | publisher = Blackwell | location = Malden, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[Alvin Plantinga]] defines "fideism" as "the exclusive or basic reliance upon faith alone, accompanied by a consequent disparagement of reason and utilized especially in the pursuit of philosophical or religious truth". The fideist therefore "urges reliance on faith rather than reason, in matters philosophical and religious", and therefore may go on to disparage the claims of reason.{{Refn | Plantinga, Alvin (1983). "Reason and Belief in God" in Alvin Plantinga and Nicholas Wolterstorff (eds.), ''Faith and Rationality: Reason and Belief in God'', page 87. (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press).{{Sfn | Amesbury | 2005 | loc = [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fideism/#1  section 1]}}}}  The fideist seeks [[truth]], above all: and affirms that reason cannot achieve certain kinds of truth, which must instead be accepted only by faith.{{Sfn | Amesbury | 2005 | loc = [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fideism/#1  section 1]}} Plantinga's definition might be revised to say that what the fideist objects to is not so much "reason" per se—it seems excessive to call [[Blaise Pascal]] anti-rational—but ''[[evidentialism]]'': the notion that no belief should be held unless it is supported by evidence.

=== History ===
{{main article |Relationship between religion and science}}

=== Theories of truth ===
{{main article |Truth#Major theories}}
The doctrine of fideism is consistent with some, and radically contrary to other theories of truth:
* [[Correspondence theory of truth]]
* [[Pragmatic theory of truth]]
* [[Constructivist epistemology]]
* [[Consensus theory of truth]]
* [[Coherence theory of truth]]
* [[Subjectivism]]

Some{{Which|date=June 2012}} forms of fideism outright reject the correspondence theory of truth, which has major philosophical implications. Some{{Who|date=June 2012}} only claim a few religious details to be [[axiom]]atic.

=== Tertullian ===

Tertullian's ''De Carne Christi'' (On the Flesh of Christ])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Beyond Fideism: Negotiable Religious Identities| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=tyTSs_dqwkcC | publisher= Ashgate| year= 2010| first = Olli-Pekka | last = Vainio| page= 25 | series = Transcending boundaries in philosophy and theology | ISBN = 978-1-40940679-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; says "the Son of God died; it is by all means to be believed, because it is [[Absurdity|absurd]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0315.htm | last = Tertullian | publisher = New Advent | title = On the Flesh of Christ | series = Fathers}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The statement ''"[[Credo quia absurdum]]"'' ("I believe because it is absurd") is sometimes cited as an example of views of the [[Church Fathers]], but this appears to be a misquotation of Tertullian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tertullian.org/articles/sider_credo.htm|title=Tertullian:  Sider, R.D., Credo Quia Absurdum?, Classical World 73 (1980) pp.417-9|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tertullian's statement, however, is not a fideist position; Tertullian was critiquing intellectual arrogance and the misuse of philosophy, but he remained committed to reason and its usefulness in defending the faith.{{Sfn | Amesbury | 2005}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= Tertullian, First Theologian of the West| first =Eric | last = Osborn | publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|page= 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Luther ===
[[Martin Luther]] taught that faith informs the Christian's use of reason. Regarding the mysteries of Christian faith, he wrote, "All the articles of our Christian faith, which God has revealed to us in His Word, are in presence of reason sheerly impossible, absurd, and false." And "Reason is the greatest enemy that faith has." However, Luther conceded that, grounded upon faith in Christ, reason can be used in its proper realm, as he wrote, "Before faith and the knowledge of God reason is darkness in divine matters, but through faith it is turned into a light in the believer and serves piety as an excellent instrument. For just as all natural endowments serve to further impiety in the godless, so they serve to further salvation in the godly. An eloquent tongue promotes faith; reason makes speech clear, and everything helps faith forward. Reason receives life from faith; it is killed by it and brought back to life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Luther | first = Martin | year = 1883–2009 | ISBN = 0-85964-464-2 | place = Weimar | language = German | title = Tischreden |trans-title=Table talks | series = Werke: kritische Gesammtausgabe | publisher = Hermann Böhlau | volume = 3. aus den dreißiger Jahren | section = Die Sammlung von Konrad Cordatus (Schluß) | number = 2938a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blaise Pascal and fideism ===
[[File:Blaise Pascal Versailles.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Blaise Pascal]]]]
Another form of fideism is assumed by [[Pascal's Wager]]. Blaise Pascal invites the [[atheism|atheist]] considering [[faith]] to see faith in God as a cost-free choice that carries a potential reward.{{Sfn | Geisler | 1976 | p = 49}} He does not attempt to argue that God indeed exists, only that it might be valuable to assume that it is true. Of course, the problem with Pascal's Wager is that it does not restrict itself to a specific God, although Pascal did have in mind the Christian God as is mentioned in the following quote. In his ''[[Pensées]]'', Pascal writes:
{{Quote | Who then will blame Christians for not being able to give reasons for their beliefs, since they profess belief in a religion which they cannot explain? They declare, when they expound it to the world, that it is foolishness, ''stultitiam''; and then you complain because they do not prove it! If they proved it, they would not keep their word; it is through their lack of proofs that they show they are not lacking in sense. | ''Pensées'', no. 233}}

Pascal moreover contests the various proposed proofs of the existence of God as irrelevant. Even if the proofs were valid, the beings they propose to demonstrate are not congruent with the deity worshiped by historical faiths, and can easily lead to [[deism]] instead of revealed religion: "The God of [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]—not the god of the philosophers!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Pensées | last = Pascal | first = Blaise | language = French |trans-title=Thoughts | publisher = Charles Louandre | place = Paris | year = 1854 | page = 40}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hamann and fideism ===
Considered to be the father of modern antirationalism, [[Johann Georg Hamann]] promoted a view that elevated faith alone as the only guide to human conduct. Using the work of [[David Hume]] he argued that everything people do is ultimately based on faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Redmond |first=M.|year=1987|title= The Hamann-Hume Connection|journal= Religious Studies|volume= 23|issue=1|pages= 97|publisher=Cambridge University Press|jstor= 20006314|doi=10.1017/s0034412500018564}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without faith (for it can never be proven) in the existence of an external world, human affairs could not continue; therefore, he argued, all reasoning comes from this faith: it is fundamental to the human condition. Thus all attempts to base belief in God using reason are in vain. He attacks systems like [[Spinozism]] that try to confine what he feels is the infinite majesty of God into a finite human creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first = Isaiah | last = Berlin | title=Three Critics of the Enlightenment: Vico, Hamann, Herder|author-link = Isaiah Berlin |page=297|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2000|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=U1373duui04C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kierkegaard===
Natural theologians may argue that Kierkegaard was a fideist of this general sort: the argument that God's existence cannot be certainly known, and that the decision to accept faith is neither founded on, nor needs, rational justification, may be found in the writings of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and his followers in [[Christian existentialism]]. Many of Kierkegaard's works, including ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'', are under [[pseudonym]]s; they may represent the work of fictional authors whose views correspond to hypothetical positions, not necessarily those held by Kierkegaard himself.

In ''Fear and Trembling'', Kierkegaard focused on Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac. The New Testament apostles repeatedly argued that Abraham's act was an admirable display of faith. To the eyes of a non-believer, however, it must necessarily have appeared to be an unjustifiable attempted [[murder]], perhaps the fruit of an insane delusion. Kierkegaard used this example to focus attention on the problem of faith in general.{{Sfn | Geisler | 1976 | pp = 50–51}} He ultimately affirmed that to believe in the incarnation of Christ, in God made flesh, was to believe in the "absolute paradox", since it implies that an eternal, perfect being would become a simple human. Reason cannot possibly comprehend such a phenomenon; therefore, one can only believe in it by taking a "[[leap of faith]]".

===James and "will to believe"===
{{expand section|date=May 2013}}
American [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] philosopher and psychologist [[William James]] introduced his concept of the "[[The Will to Believe|will to believe]]" in 1896. Following upon his earlier theories of truth, James argued that some religious questions can only be answered by believing in the first place: one cannot know if religious doctrines are true without seeing if they work, but they cannot be said to work unless one believes them in the first place.

William James published many works on the subject of religious experience. His four key characteristics of religious experience are: 'passivity', 'ineffability', 'a noetic quality', and 'transiency'. Due to the fact that religious experience is fundamentally ineffable, it is impossible to hold a coherent discussion of it using public language. This means that religious belief cannot be discussed effectively, and so reason does not affect faith. Instead, faith is found through experience of the spiritual, and so understanding of belief is only gained through the practice of it.

=== Wittgenstein and fideism&lt;!--Linked from 'Template:Wittgenstein'--&gt; ===
The philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] did not write systematically about religion, though he did lecture on the topic. Some of his students' notes have been collected and published. On the other hand, it has been asserted that religion as a "form of life" is something that intrigued Wittgenstein to a great degree. In his 1967 article, entitled "Wittgensteinian Fideism", [[Kai Nielsen (philosopher)|Kai Nielsen]] argues that certain aspects of Wittgenstein's thought have been interpreted by Wittgensteinians in a "fideistic" manner. According to this position, religion is a self-contained—and primarily expressive—enterprise, governed by its own internal logic or "[[grammar]]". This view—commonly called '''Wittgensteinian fideism'''—states: (1) that religion is logically cut off from other aspects of life; (2) that religious concepts and discourse are essentially self-referential; and (3) that religion cannot be criticized from an external (i.e., non-religious) point of view.{{Sfn | Amesbury | 2005 | loc = [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fideism/#2.2 section 2.2]}} Although there are other aspects that are often associated with the phenomena of Wittgensteinian fideism, Kai Nielsen has argued that such interpretations are implausible misrepresentations of the position. It is worth noting, however, that no self-proclaimed Wittgensteinian actually takes Nielsen's analysis to be at all representative of either Wittgenstein's view, or their own.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} This is especially true of the best-known Wittgensteinian philosopher of religion, [[Dewi Zephaniah Phillips|D. Z. Phillips]], who is also the best-known "Wittgensteinan fideist". In their book ''Wittgensteinian Fideism?'' (SCM Press, 2005), D. Z. Phillips and Kai Nielsen debate the status of Wittgensteinian fideism. Both agree that the position "collapses", though they think it fails for different reasons. For Nielsen, the position is socially and politically irresponsible since it ignores prudential, practical, and pragmatic considerations as a basis for criticizing different language games. For Phillips, the position fails because it is not Wittgensteinian, and thus is a caricature of his position. Amongst other charges, Nielsen argues most forcefully in an article entitled "On Obstacles of the Will" that Phillips' Wittgensteinian view is relevantly fideistic and that it, therefore, fails on the grounds that it cannot account for the possibility of external, cultural criticism. Phillips, in turn, in the last article in the book, entitled "Wittgenstein: Contemplation and Cultural Criticism", argues that the position is not Wittgensteinian at all, and that Wittgenstein's considered view not only allows for the possibility of external, cultural criticism, but also "advances" philosophical discussion concerning it.

=== Fideism and presuppositional apologetics ===
[[Presuppositional apologetics]] is a Christian system of [[apologetics]] associated mainly with [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] [[Protestantism]]; it attempts to distinguish itself from fideism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|page= 117|title= Epistemological crises, dramatic narratives, and apologetics: the ''ad hominem'' once more| first = Michael W | last = Payne|url=http://files.wts.edu/uploads/pdf/publications/wtj/payne-spring-02.pdf|journal=Westminster Theological Journal|issue=63|year=2002|publisher=Westminster Theological Seminary | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It holds that all human thought must begin with the proposition that the [[revelation]] contained in the [[Bible]] is [[axiom]]atic, rather than [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendentally]] necessary, else one would not be able to make sense of any human experience (see also epistemic [[foundationalism]]). To a non-believer who rejects the notion that the truth about God, the world, and themselves can be found within the Bible, the presuppositional apologist attempts to demonstrate the incoherence of the epistemic foundations of the logical alternative by the use of what has come to be known as the "Transcendental Argument for God's existence" (TAG). On the other hand, some presuppositional apologists, such as [[Cornelius Van Til]], believe that such a condition of true unbelief is impossible, claiming that all people actually believe in God (even if only on a subconscious level), whether they admit or deny it.

[[Presuppositional apologetics]] could be seen as being more closely allied with [[foundationalism]] than fideism, though it has sometimes been critical of both.

== Criticism ==

=== Fideism rejected by the Catholic Church ===
Catholic doctrine rejects fideism. The ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', representing [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]]'s great regard for [[Thomism]], the teachings of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]], affirms that it is a Catholic doctrine that God's existence can indeed be demonstrated by reason. Aquinas' position, which is to be distinguished from [[rationalism]], has deep roots in Western Christianity; it goes back to St. [[Anselm of Canterbury]]'s observation that the role of reason was to explain faith more fully: ''fides quaerens intellectum'', "faith seeking understanding", is his formula.

The official position of the Catholic Church is that while the existence of the one God can in fact be demonstrated by reason, nevertheless on account of the distortion of human nature caused by the first sin, humans can be deluded to deny the claims of reason that demonstrate God's existence. The [[Anti-Modernist oath]] promulgated by [[Pope Pius X]] required Catholics to affirm that:
{{Quote | God, the origin and end of all things, can be known with certainty by the natural light of reason from the created world (cf. Rom. 1:20), that is, from the visible works of creation, as a cause from its effects, and that, therefore, his existence can also be demonstrated&amp;nbsp;...}}

Similarly, the ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' teaches that:
{{Quote | Though human reason is, strictly speaking, truly capable by its own natural power and light of attaining to a true and certain knowledge of the one personal God, who watches over and controls the world by his providence, and of the natural law written in our hearts by the Creator; yet there are many obstacles which prevent reason from the effective and fruitful use of this inborn faculty. For the truths that concern the relations between God and man wholly transcend the visible order of things, and, if they are translated into human action and influence it, they call for self-surrender and abnegation. The human mind, in its turn, is hampered in the attaining of such truths, not only by the impact of the senses and the imagination, but also by disordered appetites which are the consequences of original sin. So it happens that men in such matters easily persuade themselves that what they would not like to be true is false or at least doubtful. | ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', ss. 37.}}

[[Pope John Paul II]]'s [[encyclical]] ''[[Fides et Ratio]]'' also affirms that God's existence is in fact demonstrable by reason, and that attempts to reason otherwise are the results of sin. In the encyclical, John Paul II warned against "a resurgence of fideism, which fails to recognize the importance of rational knowledge and philosophical discourse for the understanding of faith, indeed for the very possibility of belief in God".

==== Fideist currents in Catholic thought ====
Historically, there have been a number of fideist strains within the Catholic orbit. Catholic traditionalism, exemplified in the nineteenth century by [[Joseph de Maistre]], emphasized faith in [[tradition]] as the means of divine revelation. The claims of reason are multiple, and various people have argued rationally for several contradictory things: in this environment, the safest course is to hold true to the faith that has been preserved through tradition, and to resolve to accept what the Church has historically taught. In his essay ''[[Du pape]]'' ("On the [[Pope]]"), de Maistre argued that it was historically inevitable that all of the Protestant churches would eventually seek reunification and refuge in the Catholic Church: [[science]] was the greater threat, it threatened all religious faith, and "no religion can resist science, except one".

Another refuge of fideist thinking within the Catholic Church is the concept of "[[sign of contradiction|signs of contradiction]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Wojtyla | first = Carol | author-link = Pope John Paul II | title = Sign of contradiction | publisher = St. Paul Publications | year = 1979 | page = 8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this belief, the holiness of certain people and institutions is confirmed by the fact that other people contest their claims: this opposition is held to be worthy of comparison to the opposition met by Jesus Christ himself. This opposition and contradiction does not inherently prove something is true in Catholic thought, but only acts an additional possible indication of its truth. The idea of the sign of contradiction is related to the conviction that, while human reason is still operative, the distortion of fallen human nature causes concrete instances of reasoning to grope and often to go astray.

=== As sin ===
Fideism has received criticism from theologians who argue that fideism is not a proper way to worship God. According to this position, if one does not attempt to understand what one believes, one is not really believing. "Blind faith" is not true faith. Notable articulations of this position include:
* [[Peter Abelard]]&amp;nbsp;– ''[[Sic et Non]]''
* [[Lord Herbert]]&amp;nbsp;– ''[[Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury#De Veritate|De Veritate]]''

=== As relativism ===
Fideism can lead to [[relativism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year= 1998|title = Rationality and cultural relativism|encyclopedia=[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis|page=85|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NfRXYYhpLekC |editor-link = Edward Craig (philosopher)| editor-first = Edward | editor-last = Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of other religions puts a fundamental question to fideists—if faith is the only way to know the truth of God, how are we to know which God to have faith in? Fideism alone is not considered an adequate guide to distinguish true or morally valuable revelations from false ones. An apparent consequence of fideism is that all religious thinking becomes equal. The major monotheistic religions become on par with obscure [[fringe religions]], as neither can be advocated or disputed.

=== A case for reason ===
{{main article |Relationship between religion and science#Philosophy of science}}
These critics note that people successfully use reason in their daily lives to solve problems and that reason has led to progressive increase of knowledge in the sphere of science. This gives credibility to reason and argumentative thinking as a proper method for seeking truth. [[Galileo Galilei]], for example, said that "I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense, reason and intellect has intended us to forgo their use."

On the other hand, according to these critics, there is no evidence that a religious faith that rejects reason would also serve us while seeking truth.

Many [[virus]]es, [[bacteria]], [[protozoa]], [[fungi]], [[helminthes]] and [[prion]]s are identified as a confirmed or potential pathogen. In the United States, a [[Centers for Disease Control]] program, begun in 1995, identified over a hundred patients with life-threatening illnesses that were considered to be of an [[Infection|infectious]] cause, but that could not be linked to a known pathogen.&lt;ref name="DAY_1997"/&gt;  The association of pathogens with disease can be a complex and controversial process, in some cases requiring decades or even centuries to achieve.

==Factors impairing identification of pathogens==
Factors which have been identified as impeding the identification of pathogens include the following:

:'''1. Lack of animal models''': Experimental infection in animals has been used as a criterion to demonstrate a disease-causing ability, but for some pathogens (such as ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', which cause disease only in humans) animal models do not exist. In cases where animal models were not available, scientists have sometimes infected themselves or others to determine an organism's disease causing ability.&lt;ref name=autobiography&gt;{{cite web  | last =Barry   | first =Marshall  | title =Autobiography  | publisher =[[Nobel Foundation]]  | year =2005  | url =http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2005/marshall-autobio.html  | accessdate = 2007-01-28 | authorlink = Barry Marshall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''2. Pre-existing theories of disease''': Before a pathogen is well-recognized, scientists may attribute the symptoms of infection to other causes, such as [[Toxicology|toxicological]], [[Psychosomatic illness|psychological]], or [[Genetics|genetic]] causes. Once a pathogen has been associated with an illness, researchers have reported difficulty displacing these pre-existing theories.&lt;ref name="MARSHALL_2002"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Marshall  | first = Barry  | title = Helicobacter Pioneers: Firsthand Accounts from the Scientists who Discovered Helicobacters, 1892-1982  | publisher = Blackwell Publishing Limited  | date = May 1, 2002  | isbn = 978-0-86793-035-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BENT_1995"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bentivoglio M, Pacini P |title=Filippo Pacini: a determined observer |journal=Brain Res.

:'''4. Organisms that look alike but behave differently''': In some cases a harmless organism exists which looks identical to a disease causing organism with a microscope, which complicates the discovery process.&lt;ref name=Kolata_1998&gt;{{cite news | last = Kolata | first =Gina | title = Detective Work and Science Reveals a New Lethal Bacteria  | publisher = New York Times  | date = January 6, 1998  | url =  https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B00E7DD1230F935A35752C0A96E958260&amp;sec=health&amp;spon=&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink  | accessdate = 2007-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Vibrio cholera'' (1849-1884)===

Vibrio cholera bacteria are transmitted through contaminated water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=WHO|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs107/en/ | title=WOrld Health Organisation factsheet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once ingested, the bacteria colonizes the intestinal tract of the host and produces a toxin which causes body fluids to flow across the lining of the intestine. Death can result in 2–3 hours from dehydration if no treatment is provided.&lt;ref name="RYAN_2004"&gt;{{cite book | last=Ryan | first=KJ | title=Sherris Medical Microbiology, 4th ed | publisher=McGraw Hill | year=2004 | pages=276–7 | isbn=978-0-8385-8529-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the discovery of an infectious cause, the symptoms of [[cholera]] were thought to be caused by an excess of bile in the patient;&lt;ref name="CHAPIN_2006"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Shapin  | first = S  | title = Sick City:Maps and Morbidity in the Time of CHolera  | journal = New Yorker  | date = 2006-11-06  | url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/11/06/061106crbo_books  }}&lt;/ref&gt; the disease cholera gets its name from the Greek word ''[[choler]]'' meaning bile. This theory was consistent with [[humorism]], and led to such medical practices as [[bloodletting]].&lt;ref name="CHAPIN_2006" /&gt; The bacterium was first reported in 1849 by [[Gabriel Pouchet]], who discovered it in [[human faeces|stools]] from patients with cholera, but he did not appreciate the significance of this presence.&lt;ref name="BULLOCH_1979"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Bulloch  | first = William   | title = The History of Bacteriology  | journal = Nature   | volume = 142   | issue = 3600   | year=1979  | pages=771-773  | isbn=978-0-486-23761-9| bibcode = 1938Natur.142..771D   | doi = 10.1038/142771a0   }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first scientist to understand the significance of ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' was the Italian anatomist [[Filippo Pacini]], who published detailed drawings of the organism in "Microscopical observations and pathological deductions on cholera" in 1854.&lt;ref name="BENT_1995" /&gt; He published further papers in 1866, 1871, 1876 and 1880, which were ignored by the scientific community.&lt;ref name="BENT_1995" /&gt;  He correctly described how the bacteria caused diarrhea, and developed treatments that were found to be effective.&lt;ref name="BENT_1995" /&gt; Whilst [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s edpidemiology maps were well recognised, and led to the removal of the Broad Street pump handle, e.g. [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak]]. In 1874, scientific representatives from 21 countries voted unanimously to resolve that cholera was caused by environmental toxins from ''[[Miasma theory of disease|miasmatas]]'', or clouds of unhealthy substances which float in the air.&lt;ref name="HOWARD-JONES_1984"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Howard-Jones N |title=Robert Koch and the cholera vibrio: a centenary |journal=British Medical Journal (Clinical Research Ed.) |volume=288 |issue=6414 |pages=379–81 |year=1984 |pmid=6419937 |doi=10.1136/bmj.288.6414.379 |pmc=1444283}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1884, [[Robert Koch]] re-discovered ''Vibrio cholerae'' as a causal element in [[cholera]]. Some scientists opposed the new theory, and even drank cholera cultures to disprove it:

{{"
|Koch announced his discovery of the cholera vibrio in 1884. His conclusions were based upon the constant finding of the peculiar "comma bacillus" in the stools of cholera patients, and the failure to demonstrate this organism in the feces of other persons. It was not possible to reproduce typical cholera in laboratory animals. At the time the "germ theory" of disease had not yet obtained general acceptance, and Koch's announcement was received with considerable skepticism, particularly after it was found that similar "comma bacilli" could be found at times in the feces of persons not suffering from cholera, and often in all sorts of other environments - well and river waters, cheese, etc. We now know that these were saprotrophic species of Vibrio, which may be differentiated from the cholera vibrio by cultural and immunological methods. But the correctness of Koch's opinion was dramatically demonstrated by von Pettenkofer and Emmerich who, doubting the etiological relationship of Koch's organisms, deliberately drank cultures of it. Von Pettenkofer developed merely a transient diarrhea, but Emmerich suffered from a typical and severe attack of cholera. 
|by A. T. Henrici, ''The Biology of Bacteria'', DC Heath and Company, 1939. ASIN B00085GABK, 
}}

Von Pettenkofer considered his experience proof that ''Vibrio cholerae'' was harmless, as he did not develop cholera from consuming the culture.  Between 1849 when Pouchet discovered ''Vibrio cholerae'' and 1891, over a million people died in cholera epidemics in Europe and Russia.&lt;ref name="STITT_1922"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Stitt  | first = Edward  | title = The Diagnosis and Treatment of Tropical Diseases  | publisher = P. Blakiston's Son, Philadelphia| year = 1922 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1995, researchers published a study in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' explaining why some persons are able to be infected with cholera without symptoms, possibly explaining why Pettenkofer did not get sick.&lt;ref name="GABE_1994" /&gt;  The study showed that a series of genetic mutations in some people provide resistance to cholera toxin; but these mutations come at a price. If too many of them occur in a person, they will develop [[cystic fibrosis]], an incurable and often fatal genetic disorder.

===''Giardia lamblia'' (1681-1975)===

Giardiasis is a disease caused by infection with the protozoan ''[[Giardia lamblia]]''.  Infection with ''[[Giardia]]'' can produce diarrhea, gas, and abdominal pain in some people. If untreated, infection can be chronic. In children, chronic ''[[Giardia]]'' infection can cause [[Stunted growth|stunting]] (stunted growth) and lowered intelligence,&lt;ref name="ALI_2003"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ali SA, Hill DR |title=Giardia intestinalis |journal=Curr.

Since 2002, ''[[Giardia]]'' cases must be reported to the [[Center for Disease Control]], according to the CDC’s Reportable Disease Spreadsheet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/labs/aboutlabs/lpd/gastrointestinalParasitesSection/nash.htm Gastrointestinal Parasites Lab] studies ''[[Giardia]]'' almost exclusively.

However, ''[[Giardia]]'' experienced an extraordinarily long term of emergence, from its discovery in 1681, until the 1970s when it was fully accepted that infection with ''[[Giardia]]'' was a treatable cause of chronic diarrhea:

{{"
|''Giardia lamblia'' was first discovered by Leeuwenhoeck (1681) who found the parasite in his own {diarrheal} stools. It was long considered to be a harmless commensal organism, but in recent years has been recognized as a cause of intestinal disease often acquired by travelers to foreign countries, persons drinking contaminated water in this country, children in day care nurseries and homosexual males. It is the most common pathogenic intestinal parasite in the United States, being found in 4% of stool specimens submitted to state public health laboratories for parasite examination. Attesting to its increasing importance in the United States, a symposium on Giardiasis, sponsored by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], was held in the fall of 1978.&lt;ref name="SMITH_1980" /&gt;
|by JW Smith, ''Giardiasis'', 1980
}}

Some of the first evidence in modern times of ''Giardia's'' pathogenicity came during [[World War II]] when soldiers were treated for [[malaria]] with the antiprotozoal [[Quinacrine]], and their diarrhea disappeared, as did the ''[[Giardia]]'' from their stool samples. In 1954, Dr. R.C. Rendtorff  performed experiments on prisoner volunteers, infecting them with ''[[Giardia]]''.&lt;ref name=RENDTORFF&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rendtorff|first=RC |title=The experimental transmission of human intestinal protozoan parasites.

His experiments were described in the EPA Symposium on Waterborne Transmission of Giardiasis in 1979:

As a result we felt safe in exposing prisoners to Giardia...&lt;ref name=RENDTORFF/&gt;

In 1954-55, an outbreak of ''[[Giardia]]'' infection occurred in [[Oregon]] (US), sickening 50,000 people.&lt;ref name="VEAZIE_1969"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Veazie L |title=Epidemic giardiasis |journal=N.

In the communication, Veazie notes that he was unable to find a publisher for his account of the epidemic.  The communication was re-published in the ''EPA Symposium on Waterborne Transmission of Giardiasis'' in 1979, and that version included the following quote from the Director of the Oregon State Board of Health, suggesting that diarrhea from ''[[Giardia]]'' was still being attributed to other causes by health authorities in 1954:

===''Helicobacter pylori'' (1892-1982)===

Infection with the bacteria ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' is the cause of most stomach ulcers. The discovery is generally credited to Australian gastroenterologists Dr. [[Barry Marshall]] and Dr. J Robin Warren, who published their findings in 1983. The pair received the Nobel Prize in 2005 for their work. Before this, nobody really knew what caused stomach ulcers, though a popular belief was that the "stress" played a role. Some researchers suggested that ulcers were a [[psychosomatic]] illness.&lt;ref name="PAULLEY_1975"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paulley JW |title=Cultural influences on the incidence and pattern of disease |journal=Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=2–11 |year=1975 |pmid=1178798 |doi=10.1159/000286889}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KELLNER_1975"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kellner R |title=Psychotherapy in psychosomatic disorders |journal=Arch.

In ''H Pylori Pioneers'', Dr. Marshall noted that other physicians had produced evidence of ''[[H. pylori]]'' infection as early as 1892.&lt;ref name="MARSHALL_2002" /&gt; Marshall writes that earlier reports were disregarded because they conflicted with existing belief. The first description of ''H. Pylori'' came in 1892 from Giulio Bizzozero, who identified acid-tolerant bacteria living in a dog’s stomach. Later, a theory would be developed that no bacteria could live in the stomach.&lt;ref name="MARSHALL_2002" /&gt; Although the theory has no scientific basis, it would become a stumbling block for scientists, discouraging them for searching for infective causes of stomach ulcers. In 1940, two physicians, Dr. A. Stone Freeberg and Dr. Louis E. Barron published a paper describing a spiral bacteria found in about half of their gastroenterology patients who had stomach ulcers. Dr. [[John Lykoudis]], a Greek physician, was one of the first physicians to treat stomach ulcers as an infectious disease. Between 1960 and 1970, he treated over 10,000 ulcer patients in Athens with antibiotics.&lt;ref name="RIGAS_1999"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rigas B, Feretis C, Papavassiliou ED |title=John Lykoudis: an unappreciated discoverer of the cause and treatment of peptic ulcer disease |journal=Lancet |volume=354 |issue=9190 |pages=1634–5 |year=1999 |pmid=10560691 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(99)06034-1|last2=Feretis |last3=Papavassiliou }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lykoudis tried to publish a paper on his findings, but they conflicted with traditional theory, and his work was never published.&lt;ref name="MARSHALL_2002" /&gt;  Lykoudis' experience was followed in 1975 by a further publication in Gut magazine that included spiral bacteria living on the borders of duodonal ulcers.&lt;ref name="STEER_1975"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Steer HW, Colin-Jones DG |title=Mucosal changes in gastric ulceration and their response to carbenoxolone sodium |journal=Gut |volume=16 |issue=8 |pages=590–7 |year=1975 |pmid=810394 |doi=10.1136/gut.16.8.590 |pmc=1411007|last2=Colin-Jones }}&lt;/ref&gt; The medical significance of Steer’s findings was disregarded, but he “continued to publish papers on ''[[H. Pylori]]'', mostly as a hobby."&lt;ref name="MARSHALL_2002" /&gt;

''[[H. pylori]]'' can infect the stomach of some people without causing stomach ulcers. In investigating asymptomatic carriers of ''[[H. pylori]]'', researchers identified a genetic trait called Interleuik-1 beta-31 which causes increased production of stomach acid, resulting in ulcers if patients become infected with ''[[H. pylori]]''. Patients without the trait do not develop stomach ulcers in response to ''[[H. pylori]]'' infection, but instead have increased risk from stomach cancer if they become infected.&lt;ref name="EL-OMAR_2000" /&gt; Investigation into other gastrointestinal infections has also shown that the symptoms are the result of interaction between the infection and specific genetic mutations in the host.

===Pathogenic variants of ''Escherichia coli'' (1947-1983)===

There are different types of ''[[E. coli]]'', some of which are found in humans and are harmless.  [[Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli]] (ETEC) is a type found to cause illness in humans, possessing [[gene]] that allows it to manufacture a substance toxic to humans. Cattle are immune to its effects but when people eat food contaminated with cattle feces, the organism can cause disease.

AIDS was first reported June 5, 1981, when the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] recorded a cluster of [[Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)|''Pneumocystis carinii'' pneumonia]] (now still classified as PCP but known to be caused by [[Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)|''Pneumocystis jirovecii'']]) in five homosexual men in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=MMWR2&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of the virus took several years of research, and was announced in 1984 by Dr. Gallo of the National Cancer Institute, Dr. Luc Montagnier at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, and Dr. Jay Levy at the University of California, San Francisco.

However, HIV existed long before the 1981 CDC report. Three of the earliest known instances of HIV infection are as follows:

Two species of HIV infect humans: [[HIV-1]] and [[HIV-2]]. HIV-1 is more virulent and more easily transmitted. HIV-1 is the source of the majority of HIV infections throughout the world, while HIV-2 is not as easily transmitted and is largely confined to [[West Africa]].&lt;ref name=Reeves&gt;{{cite journal

It is hypothesized that HIV probably transferred to humans as a result of direct contact with primates, for instance during hunting, butchery, or inter-species sexual contact.&lt;ref name=CohenOrigns&gt;{{cite journal

===''Cyclospora'' (1995)===

[[Cyclospora]] is a gastrointestinal pathogen that causes fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and severe weight loss.  Outbreaks of the disease occurred in [[Chicago]] in 1989 and other areas in the United States.&lt;ref name=GOLEMAN_1995&gt;{{cite news   | last = Goleman  | first =Daniel  | title = Tiny Clinic in Katmandy Solves Mystery  | publisher = New York Times  | date = January 3, 1995  | url =  https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEFD7163AF930A35752C0A963958260&amp;sec=travel&amp;spon=&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink  | accessdate = 2007-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But investigation by the [[Center for Disease Control]] could not identify an infectious cause. The discovery of the cause was made by Mr. Ramachandran Rajah, the head of a medical clinic's laboratory in [[Kathmandu]], Nepal. Mr. Rajah was trying to discover why local residents and visitors were becoming ill every summer.&lt;ref name="GOLEMAN_1995" /&gt; He identified an unusual looking organism in stool samples from patients who were sick. But when the clinic sent slides of the organism to the [[Center for Disease Control]], it was identified as blue-green algae, which is harmless. Many pathologists had seen the same thing before, but dismissed it as irrelevant to the patient's disease.&lt;ref name="GOLEMAN_1995" /&gt; Later, the organism would be identified as a special kind of parasite, and treatment would be developed to help patients with the infection. In the United States, [[Cyclospora]] infection must be reported to the [[Center for Disease Control]] according to the [https://www.cdc.gov/epo/dphsi/phs/infdis2007r.htm CDC's Reportable Disease Chart]

==Present day discoveries==

The process of identifying new infectious agents continues. One study has suggested there are a large number of pathogens already causing illness in the population, but they have not yet been properly identified.&lt;ref name="DAY_1997"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Day M |title=Stalking the diseases with no name |journal=New Scientist  | date=June 7, 1997 | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15420850.600-stalking-the-diseases-with-no-name.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gastrointestinal pathogens===

Many recently emerged pathogens infect the [[gastrointestinal tract]]. For example, there are three gastrointestinal protozoal infections which must be reported to the [[Center for Disease Control]].&lt;ref name=CDC2007&gt;{{cite web

== Operations ==

Since the establishment in 2008, ISHK promotes [[ichthyology|ichthyological]]-[[science]] to the public by following activities:
*Ichthyological workshops
*Stream guidance tours
*Guided tours (Day and overnight tours)
*Publication of literature&lt;ref&gt;[[Dee-hwa CHONG]] ([[:zh:莊棣華|莊棣華]]), the President of ISHK, has a weekly column for introduction of fishes in [[Ta Kung Pao]] ([[:zh:大公報]]) See [http://www.takungpao.com/news/search.asp?hName=hValue&amp;word=%B2%F8%B4%D0%B5%D8&amp;news_column=0_all&amp;BckpMode=false&amp;Submit=%C0%CB%AF%C1]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} and [http://www.takungpao.com/news/search.asp?hName=hValue&amp;word=%B2%F8%B4%D0%B5%D8&amp;news_column=0_all&amp;BckpMode=true&amp;Submit=%C0%CB%AF%C1 ]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, as well as the website of ISHK.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the society works on matters for promoting ichthyology:
*Academic studies and seminars
*Setup of fish displaying facilities (e.g., aquariums)
*Runs popular lectures (workshops) to the public
*Holds exhibitions and seminars upon organizations' invitations
*Provides fish-related services (including consultation and support) for the Government, organizations and institutions, mainly on protection and conservation of fishes, ecology, environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mytv.tvb.com/news/newsmagazine/104067|title=河流污染 (River pollution)|publisher=''News Magazine'' ([[:zh:新聞透視|新聞透視]]) by [[TVB]]|date=21 January 2010|language=Chinese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125172114/http://mytv.tvb.com/news/newsmagazine/104067|archivedate=25 January 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sina.com.hk/cgi-bin/nw/show.cgi/2/1/1/1403563/1.html|title=屯門河死魚臭熏天 環署調查 (Environmental Protection Department investigation against fish deaths on Tuen Mun River)|publisher=[[Ming Pao]] ([[:zh:明報|明報]])|date=22 January 2010|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institut français du Proche-Orient''' (IFPO), or [[France|French]] Institute of the [[Near East]], is part of the network of French Research Centres abroad. It has branches in [[Syria]],  [[Lebanon]] and [[Jordan]].

== History ==

The IFPO was created in 2003 by bringing together three existing French Institutes in the area : IFEAD (French Institute for [[Arab]] Studies in [[Damascus]], established in 1922), IFAPO (French Institute of near Eastern Archaeology established in [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]] in 1946) and CERMOC (Centre for Study and Research on the Contemporary Middle East, est. 1977 in [[Lebanon]] and 1988 in [[Jordan]]). The IFPO has the status of a "Joint Entity of French Research Institutes Abroad" (UMIFRE no6, Unité Mixte des Instituts français de recherche à l’étranger) and is under the aegis of the [[French Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] and the [[CNRS]] (National Centre for Scientific Research).

== Fields of research and area purposes ==

IFPO is active in [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Jordan]], and hopes to be able to extend its activities to [[Iraq]] and the [[Palestinian Territories]]. Its Director-General, who is based in Damascus, is [[Eberhard Kienle]], who was preceded by [[François Burgat]] (2008-2013), Jean-Yves L’Hôpital (June 2005-May 2008) and Christian Décobert (Jan. 2003-Aug. 2004). The Institute’s tasks are research, research training, the diffusion of knowledge and cooperation with local and international institutions. These tasks are carried out with the support of the local Ministries in charge of Research and Higher Education, and in close cooperation with both. 
 
The Institute acts as a centre for study and research in all fields relating to the ancient and modern civilizations of the Near East. On the basis of the numerous activities and publications of its researchers, the institute aims at raising the French contribution to research to the highest academic standards in the various fields of research related to these civilizations, from the earliest times to the contemporary period. The Institute also trains young researchers for careers in teaching and research.

== Organization ==

The Institute is organised into three scientific departments : Archeology and Ancient History (Director Frédéric Alpi) ; Arab, Medieval and Modern Studies (director : Bruno Lory) ; Contemporary Studies (director : Myriam Catusse). 
 
In its different locations, the Institute recruits experienced researchers (at various levels in their careers) from [[France]], from the three countries in which it is established, from [[Europe]] and from the rest of the world. They come for a maximum of four years and are selected to take part in the various academic projects initiated by the Institute. It also welcomes receives young researchers (PHD candidates, grant holders, etc.) of all nationalities to take part in its activities. The duration of their stay varies according to their individual situation.
 
The Institute also awards some short-term grants for limited projects. Since many of these researchers also belong to other research teams or programmes in France and elsewhere, the Institute hopes that these projects will strengthen and broaden its academic network.

==Goals==
Systems biology attempts to study biological systems in a holistic manner by integrating data at all levels of the biological information hierarchy, from global down to the individual organism, and below down to the molecular level. The vision of ISB has been to integrate these concepts using a cross-disciplinary approach combining the efforts of biologists, chemists, computer scientists, engineers, mathematicians, physicists, and physicians.&lt;ref name=Hood2008/&gt;

On its website, ISB has defined four areas of focus:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute for Systems Biology - Research|url=http://www.systemsbiology.org/research|publisher=Institute for Systems Biology|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* P4 Medicine - This acronym refers to predictive, preventive, personalized and participatory medicine, which focuses on wellness rather than the mere treatment of disease.
* Global Health - Use of the systems approach towards the study of infectious diseases, vaccine development, emergence of chronic diseases, and maternal and child health.
* Sustainable Environment - Applying systems biology for a better understanding of the role of microbes in the environment and their relation to human health.
* Education &amp; Outreach - Knowledge transfer to society through a variety of educational programs and partnerships, including the spinout of new companies.

==Early history==
[[File:Leroy Hood podium PITT2008.JPG|thumb|right|Leroy Hood, 2008]]
[[File:Aderem 00044.jpg|thumb|right | Alan Aderem, 2012]]
[[File:Ruedi Aebersold 2012.JPG|thumb|right| Ruedi Aebersold, 2012]]

[[Leroy Hood]] co-founded the Institute with [[Alan Aderem]] and [[Ruedi Aebersold]] in 2000.&lt;ref name=ISB/&gt;

However, the story of how ISB got started actually begins in 1990.&lt;ref name=Dietrich1992&gt;{{cite news|last=Dietrich|first=Bill|title=Future Perfect -- Thanks To Bill Gates' $12-Million Endowment, Scientist Leroy Hood Continues His Search For A New Genetic Destiny|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19920209&amp;slug=1474735|accessdate=17 March 2012|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=9 February 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee Hood was the director of a large molecular biotechnology lab at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in Pasadena, and was a key advisor in the [[Human Genome Project]], having overseen development of machines that were instrumental to its later success. The [[University of Washington]] (UW), like many other universities, was eager to recruit Hood, but had neither the space nor the money to accommodate Hood's large laboratory.&lt;ref name=Dietrich1992/&gt;

Lee Huntsman, director of UW's Center for Bioengineering, was attending a UW football game, sharing a luxury box with [[Bill Gates]], the former CEO and current chairman of [[Microsoft]]. Huntsman took the opportunity to tell Gates about Hood. Bill Gates already had a considerable interest in biotechnology, both as a philanthropist and as an investor, and after meeting Hood, donated $12 million to UW to enable him to head a new department of molecular biotechnology,&lt;ref name=Dietrich1992/&gt; where Hood continues to hold a faculty position as the Gates Professor of Molecular Biotechnology.&lt;ref name=UWBiotechnology&gt;{{cite web|title=Department of Molecular Biotechnology|url=http://nick-lab.gs.washington.edu/mbt-web/|publisher=University of Washington|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISB represents a spin-off of Hood's labs at UW.&lt;ref name=ISEPP_Hood&gt;{{cite web|title=Revolutionary New Science|url=http://www.isepp.org/Pages/01-02%20Pages/Hood.html|publisher=Institute for Science, Engineering and Public Policy|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achievements==
ISB is in the top ranks of scientific institutions worldwide. In 2012, the  SCImago Research Group, based in Spain, ranked ISB 4th worldwide on its Excellence Rate scale.&lt;ref name=SCImago&gt;{{cite web|title=SCImago Research Group|url=http://www.scimago.es/index.php|publisher=SCImago Research Group|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISB currently hosts 10 research groups with expertise ranging across [[genetics]], [[microbial genetics]], complex molecular machines, macromolecular complexes, [[gene regulatory networks]], [[immunology]], molecular and cell biology, cancer biology, [[genomics]], [[proteomics]], protein chemistry, [[computational biology]] and [[biotechnology]].&lt;ref name=ISB/&gt; The ISB web site lists 985 peer-reviewed publications for the years 2000 through early 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute for Systems Biology - Publications|url=http://www.systemsbiology.org/publications|publisher=Institute for Systems Biology|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In late 2005, the ISB began to emphasize the application of systems biology to P4 medicine (predictive, preventive, personalized, participatory), ''i.e.'' the development of techniques for predicting and preventing disease, possibly before patients even know they are sick. The ''P4 Medicine institute'' was co-founded in 2010 by ISB and [[Ohio State University]].&lt;ref name=P4&gt;{{cite web|title=P4 Medicine Institute|url=http://p4mi.org/|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Education and Outreach efforts of ISB include creating the Logan Center for Education whose mission is to enable educators to produce [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] literate students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Logan Center for Education |url=http://logancenter.systemsbiology.net |publisher=Institute for Systems Biology |accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISB offers paid research internships for high school and undergraduate students, and offers advanced systems science courses throughout the year.

ISB has partnered in several high-profile research projects, the most significant one thus far being with the [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] to create the ''Center for Systems Biology Luxembourg''&lt;ref name=Seattlepi2008&gt;{{cite news|last=Tartakoff|first=Joseph|title=Seattle, Luxembourg research projects set|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/article/Seattle-Luxembourg-research-projects-set-1275714.php|accessdate=17 March 2012|newspaper=Seattlepi.com (Seattle Post-Intelligencer)|date=5 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Seattle Proteome Center''.&lt;ref name=SPC&gt;{{cite web|title=Seattle Proteome Center |url=http://www.proteomecenter.org/ |publisher=Seattle Proteome Center|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISB faculty members have launched five companies: Cytopeia (acquired by BD in 2008), Integrated Diagnostics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Integrated Diagnostics|url=http://www.integrated-diagnostics.com/|accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macrogenics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Macrogenics |accessdate=17 March 2012|url=http://www.macrogenics.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NanoString Technologies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NanoString |url=http://www.nanostring.com/ |accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Accelerator Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Accelerator Corporation |url=http://www.acceleratorcorp.com/ |accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accelerator Corporation, in particular, is an investment company that provides venture capital funding and management for biotech startup companies. Its portfolio companies and graduates have focused on improved biotherapeutics, vaccines, biomarkers and other such products.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xxxi,1}} Beyond the digital aspect, interaction design is also useful when creating physical (non-digital) products, exploring how a user might interact with it. Common topics of interaction design include [[design]], [[human–computer interaction]], and [[software development]]. While interaction design has an interest in form (similar to other design fields), its main area of focus rests on behavior.&lt;ref name="AboutFace3" /&gt;{{rp|1}} Rather than analyzing how things are, interaction design synthesizes and imagines things as they could be. This element of interaction design is what characterizes IxD as a design field as opposed to a science or engineering field.&lt;ref name="AboutFace3" /&gt;{{rp|xviii}}

While disciplines such as software engineering have a heavy focus on designing for technical stakeholders,  &lt;!-- re-read sections in Inmates are running the asylum for citations: When designing to meet the needs and desires of users as opposed to technical stake holders, the results are unequivocally different.... --&gt;interaction design is geared toward satisfying the majority of users.&lt;ref name="AboutFace3" /&gt;{{rp|xviii}}

== History ==
The term ''interaction design'' was coined by [[Bill Moggridge]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ws-soa-busmodeling/index.html|title=Integrate business modeling and interaction design|date=8 June 2007|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212063437/http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ws-soa-busmodeling/index.html|archivedate=12 February 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bill Verplank]] in the mid-1980s, but it took 10 years before other designers the concept started to take hold.&lt;ref name="AboutFace3" /&gt;{{rp|xviii}} To Verplank, it was an adaptation of the computer science term ''user interface design'' for the [[industrial design]] profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billverplank.com/professional.html|title=Bill Verplank - Professional|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123153501/http://www.billverplank.com/professional.html|archivedate=23 January 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Moggridge, it was an improvement over ''soft-face'', which he had coined in 1984 to refer to the application of industrial design to products containing software.&lt;ref name="DesigningInteractions"&gt;*{{cite book

|isbn=0-262-13474-8
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Moggridge's book, ''Designing Interactions'' explores a number of prominent examples of interaction design (e.g., the [[input device]], laptop, handheld) and includes interviews with some of its best-known practitioners.--&gt;

The earliest programs in design for interactive technologies were the Visible Language Workshop, started by [[Muriel Cooper]] at MIT in 1975, and the [[Interactive Telecommunications Program]] founded at NYU in 1979 by Martin Elton and later headed by Red Burns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/nyregion/red-burns-godmother-of-silicon-alley-dies-at-88.html|title=Red Burns, ‘Godmother of Silicon Alley,’ Dies at 88|last=Martin|first=Douglas|date=2013-08-26|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-08-01|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160524195449/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/nyregion/red-burns-godmother-of-silicon-alley-dies-at-88.html|archivedate=24 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first academic program officially named "Interaction Design" was established at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in 1994 as a Master of Design in Interaction Design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.design.cmu.edu/show_program.php?s%3D2%26t%3D3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130142448/http://www.design.cmu.edu/show_program.php?s=2&amp;t=3 |archivedate=30 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the outset, the program focused mainly on screen interfaces, before shifting to a greater emphasis on the "big picture" aspects of interaction—people, organizations, culture, service and system.

In 1990, Gillian Crampton Smith founded the Computer-related Design MA at the [[Royal College of Art]] (RCA) in London, changed in 2005 to Design Interactions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interaction.rca.ac.uk RCA Design Interactions Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710032805/http://www.interaction.rca.ac.uk/ |date=10 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; headed by Anthony Dunne.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.design-interactions.rca.ac.uk/anthony-dunne RCA Design Interactions About Students Staff &amp; Guests Research Graduating Projects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205163817/http://www.design-interactions.rca.ac.uk/anthony-dunne |date=5 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Crampton Smith helped found the [[Interaction Design Institute Ivrea]], a small institute in [[Olivetti|Olivetti's]] hometown in Northern Italy, dedicated solely to interaction design. The institute moved to Milan in October 2005 and merged with [[Domus Academy, Postgraduate School of Design|Domus Academy]]. In 2007, some of the people originally involved with IDII set up the [[Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design]] (CIID). After Ivrea, Crampton Smith and Philip Tabor added the Interaction Design (IxD) track in the Visual and Multimedia Communication at Iuav, University of Venice, Italy, between 2006 and 2014.

In 1998, the [[Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research]] founded [[The Interactive Institute]]—a Swedish research institute in the field of interaction design.

==Methodologies==

===Goal-oriented design===
Goal-oriented design (or Goal-Directed design) "is concerned with satisfying the needs and desires of the users of a product or service."&lt;ref name="AboutFace3" /&gt;{{rp|xviii}}

[[Alan Cooper]] argues in ''The Inmates Are Running the Asylum'' that we need a new approach to solving interactive software-based problems.&lt;ref name="Inmates"&gt;{{cite book |title=Inmates Are Running the Asylum, The: Why High-Tech Products Drive Us Crazy and How to Restore the Sanity |last=Cooper |first=Alan |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2004 |publisher=Sams Publishing |location= |isbn=0-672-32614-0 |pages=288 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} The problems with designing computer interfaces are fundamentally different from those that do not include software (e.g., hammers).  Cooper introduces the concept of cognitive friction, which is when the interface of a design is complex and difficult to use, and behaves inconsistently and unexpectedly, possessing different modes.&lt;ref name="Inmates"/&gt;{{rp|22}}

Alternatively, interfaces can be designed to serve the needs of the service/product provider. User needs may be poorly served by this approach.

===Usability===
Usability answers the question "can someone use this interface?". Jacob Nielsen describes usability as the quality attribute &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/|title=Usability 101: Introduction to Usability|author=|date=|website=nngroup.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160901213207/https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/|archivedate=1 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; that describes how usable the interface is. Shneiderman proposes principles for designing more usable interfaces called "Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://faculty.washington.edu/jtenenbg/courses/360/f04/sessions/schneidermanGoldenRules.html|title=Shneiderman's Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design|author=|date=|website=faculty.washington.edu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109012011/http://faculty.washington.edu/jtenenbg/courses/360/f04/sessions/schneidermanGoldenRules.html|archivedate=9 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;—which are well-known heuristics for creating usable systems.

===Personas===
[[Persona (user experience)|Personas]] are archetypes that describe the various goals and observed behaviour patterns among users.&lt;ref name="Designing for the Digital Age"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goodwin|first1=Kim|title=Designing for the Digital Age|date=2009|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-22910-1|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A persona encapsulates critical behavioural data in a way that both designers and stakeholders can understand, remember, and relate to. Personas use storytelling to engage users' social and emotional aspects, which helps designers to either visualize the best product behaviour or see why the recommended design is successful.&lt;ref name="Designing for the Digital Age"/&gt;

===Cognitive dimensions===
The [[cognitive dimensions]] framework&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Instructions and Descriptions: some cognitive aspects of programming and similar activities |author=T. R. G.

Cognitive dimensions offer a lightweight approach to analysis of a design quality, rather than an in-depth, detailed description. They provide a common vocabulary for discussing notation, [[user interface]] or programming language design.

Dimensions provide high-level descriptions of the interface and how the user interacts with it: examples include ''consistency'', ''error-proneness'', ''hard mental operations'', ''viscosity'' and ''premature commitment''. These concepts aid the creation of new designs from existing ones through ''design maneuvers'' that alter the design within a particular dimension.

===Affective interaction design===
Designers must be aware of elements that influence user emotional responses. For instance, products must convey positive emotions while avoiding negative ones.&lt;ref name="Sharp 2007"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other important aspects include motivational, learning, creative, social and persuasive influences. One method that can help convey such aspects is for example, the use of dynamic icons, animations and sound to help communicate, creating a sense of interactivity. Interface aspects such as fonts, color palettes and graphical layouts can influence acceptance. Studies showed that affective aspects can affect perceptions of usability.&lt;ref name="Sharp 2007"/&gt;

Emotion and pleasure theories exist to explain interface responses. These include [[Don Norman]]'s [[emotional design]] model, Patrick Jordan's pleasure model&lt;ref&gt;http://changingminds.org/explanations/emotions/happiness/four_pleasures.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and McCarthy and Wright's Technology as Experience framework.&lt;ref&gt;https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/technology-experience&lt;/ref&gt;

==Five dimensions==
The concept of dimensions of interaction design were introduced in Moggridge's book ''Designing Interactions.'' Crampton Smith wrote that interaction design draws on four existing design languages, 1D, 2D, 3D, 4D.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moggridge|first=Bill|title=Designing Interactions|year=2007|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-13474-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silver later proposed a fifth dimension, behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Silver|first=Kevin|title=What Puts the Design in Interaction Design|url=http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2007/07/what-puts-the-design-in-interaction-design.php|publisher=UX Matters|accessdate=6 March 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115072245/http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2007/07/what-puts-the-design-in-interaction-design.php|archivedate=15 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Words===

This dimension defines interactions: words are the element that users interact with.

===Visual representations===

Visual representations are the elements of an interface that the user perceives; these may include but are not limited to "typography, diagrams, icons, and other graphics".

===Physical objects or space===

This dimension defines the objects or space "with which or within which users interact".

===Time===

The time during which the user interacts with the interface. An example of this includes "content that changes over time such as sound, video or animation".

===Behavior===

Behaviour defines and how user respond to the interface.

;[[Industrial design]]&lt;ref name="interactiondesign.com.au - disciplines and domaines"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interactiondesign.com.au/disciplines-and-domains|title=Disciplines &amp; Domains of Interaction Design|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:The core principles of industrial design overlap with those of interaction design. Industrial designers use their knowledge of physical [[Shape|form]], color, [[aesthetics]], [[Perception|human perception]] and desire, and [[usability]] to create a fit of an object with the person using it.

;[[Human factors and ergonomics]]
:Certain basic principles of ergonomics provide grounding for interaction design. These include [[anthropometry]], [[biomechanics]], [[kinesiology]], [[physiology]] and [[psychology]] as they relate to human behavior in the built environment.

;[[Cognitive psychology]]&lt;ref name="interactiondesign.com.au - disciplines and domaines" /&gt;
:Certain basic principles of cognitive psychology provide grounding for interaction design. These include [[mental model]]s, mapping, [[interface metaphors]], and [[affordance]]s. Many of these are laid out in [[Donald Norman]]'s influential book ''[[The Design of Everyday Things]].''

;[[Human–computer interaction]]&lt;ref name="interactiondesign.com.au - disciplines and domaines" /&gt;
:Academic research in human–computer interaction (HCI) includes methods for describing and testing the usability of interacting with an interface, such as [[cognitive dimensions]] and the [[cognitive walkthrough]].

;[[Design research]]
:Interaction designers are typically informed through iterative cycles of user research. User research is used to identify the needs, motivations and behaviors of end users. They [[design]] with an emphasis on user goals and experience, and evaluate designs in terms of [[usability]] and affective influence.

;[[Architecture]]&lt;ref name="interactiondesign.com.au - disciplines and domaines" /&gt;
:As interaction designers increasingly deal with [[ubiquitous computing]], [[urban informatics]] and [[urban computing]], the architects' ability to make, place, and create context becomes a point of contact between the disciplines.

;[[User interface design]]
:Like user interface design and [[experience design]], interaction design is often associated with the design of system interfaces in a variety of media but concentrates on the aspects of the interface that define and present its behavior over time, with a focus on developing the system to respond to the user's experience and not the other way around.

[[Image:Mandelpart2 red.png|right|thumb|upright=1.4|This image illustrates part of the [[Mandelbrot set]] [[fractal]]. Simply storing the 24-bit color of each pixel in this image would require 1.62 million bytes, but a small computer program can reproduce these 1.62 million bytes using the definition of the Mandelbrot set and the coordinates of the corners of the image. Thus, the Kolmogorov complexity of the raw file encoding this bitmap is much less than 1.62 million bytes in any pragmatic model of computation.]]

In [[algorithmic information theory]] (a subfield of [[computer science]] and [[mathematics]]), the '''Kolmogorov complexity''' of an object, such as a piece of text, is the length of the shortest [[computer program]] (in a predetermined [[programming language]]) that produces the object as output. It is a measure of the [[computation]]al resources needed to specify the object, and is also known as '''descriptive complexity''', '''Kolmogorov–[[Gregory Chaitin|Chaitin]] complexity''', '''algorithmic complexity''', '''algorithmic entropy''', or '''program-size complexity'''. It is named after [[Andrey Kolmogorov]], who first published on the subject in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=Andrey Kolmogorov|first=Andrey|last=Kolmogorov|year=1963|title=On Tables of Random Numbers| journal=Sankhyā Ser. A.|volume=25|pages=369–375|mr=178484}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=Andrey Kolmogorov|first=Andrey|last=Kolmogorov|year=1998|title=On Tables of Random Numbers| journal=Theoretical Computer Science|volume=207|issue=2|pages=387–395|doi=10.1016/S0304-3975(98)00075-9 |mr=1643414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of Kolmogorov complexity can be used to state and [[Proof of impossibility|prove impossibility]] results akin to [[Cantor's diagonal argument]], [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]], and [[halting problem|Turing's halting problem]].
In particular, for almost all objects, it is not possible to compute even a [[lower bound]] for its Kolmogorov complexity ([[#Chaitin's incompleteness theorem|Chaitin 1964]]), let alone its exact value.

==Definition==
Consider the following two [[string (computer science)|strings]] of 32 lowercase letters and digits.

: Example 1: &lt;code&gt;abababababababababababababababab&lt;/code&gt;
: Example 2: &lt;code&gt;4c1j5b2p0cv4w1x8rx2y39umgw5q85s7&lt;/code&gt;

The first string has a short English-language description, namely "&lt;tt&gt;ab 16 times&lt;/tt&gt;", which consists of '''11''' characters. The second one has no obvious simple description (using the same character set) other than writing down the string itself, which has '''32''' characters.

More formally, the [[complexity]] of a string is the length of the shortest possible description of the string in some fixed [[Turing complete|universal]] description language (the sensitivity of complexity relative to the choice of description language is discussed below). It can be shown that the Kolmogorov complexity of any string cannot be more than a few bytes larger than the length of the string itself. Strings like the ''abab'' example above, whose Kolmogorov complexity is small relative to the string's size, are not considered to be complex.

The Kolmogorov complexity can be defined for any mathematical object, but for simplicity the scope of this article is restricted to strings. We must first specify a description language for strings.  Such a description language can be based on any computer programming language, such as [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], or [[Java virtual machine]] bytecode.  If '''P''' is a program which outputs a string ''x'', then '''P''' is a description of ''x''. The length of the description is just the length of '''P''' as a character string, multiplied by the number of bits in a character (e.g. 7 for [[ASCII]]).

We could, alternatively, choose an encoding for [[Turing machine]]s, where an ''encoding'' is a function which associates to each Turing Machine '''M''' a bitstring &lt;'''M'''&gt;. If '''M''' is a Turing Machine which, on input ''w'', outputs string ''x'', then the concatenated string &lt;'''M'''&gt; ''w'' is a description of ''x''. For theoretical analysis, this approach is more suited for constructing detailed formal proofs and is generally preferred in the research literature. In this article, an informal approach is discussed.

Any string ''s'' has at least one description. For example, the second string above is output by the program:

  '''function''' GenerateExample2String()
     '''return''' "4c1j5b2p0cv4w1x8rx2y39umgw5q85s7"

where the first string is output by the (much shorter) pseudo-code:

  '''function''' GenerateExample1String()
     '''return''' "ab" * 16

If a description ''d''(''s'') of a string ''s'' is of minimal length (i.e. it uses the fewest bits), it is called a '''minimal description''' of ''s''.  Thus, the length of ''d''(''s'') (i.e. the number of bits in the description) is the '''Kolmogorov complexity''' of ''s'', written ''K''(''s''). Symbolically,

:''K''(''s'') = |''d''(''s'')|.

The length of the shortest description will depend on the choice of description language; but the effect of changing languages is bounded (a result called the ''invariance theorem''). The standard textbook is authored by [[Ming Li]] and [[Paul Vitanyi]]  
in the references.

==Invariance theorem==

===Informal treatment===
There are some description languages which are optimal, in the following sense: given any description of an object in a description language, said description may be used in the optimal description language with a constant overhead. The constant depends only on the languages involved, not on the description of the object, nor the object being described.

Here is an example of an optimal description language. A description will have two parts:

* The first part describes another description language.
* The second part is a description of the object in that language.

In more technical terms, the first part of a description is a computer program, with the second part being the input to that computer program which produces the object as output.

'''The invariance theorem follows:''' Given any description language ''L'', the optimal description language is at least as efficient as ''L'', with some constant overhead.

'''Proof:''' Any description ''D'' in ''L'' can be converted into a description in the optimal language by first describing ''L'' as a computer program ''P'' (part 1), and then using the original description ''D'' as input to that program (part 2). The
total length of this new description ''D&amp;prime;'' is (approximately):

:|''D&amp;prime;''| = |''P''| + |''D''|

The length of ''P'' is a constant that doesn't depend on ''D''. So, there is at most a constant overhead, regardless of the object described. Therefore, the optimal language is universal [[up to]] this additive constant.

===A more formal treatment===
'''Theorem''': If ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the complexity functions relative to [[Turing complete]] description languages ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, then there is a constant ''c''&amp;nbsp;– which depends only on the languages ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; chosen&amp;nbsp;– such that

:∀''s''.  −''c'' ≤ ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') − ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') ≤ ''c''.

'''Proof''': By symmetry, it suffices to prove that there is some constant ''c'' such that for all strings ''s''

:''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') ≤ ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') + ''c''.

Now, suppose there is a program in the language ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; which acts as an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] for ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:

   '''function''' InterpretLanguage('''string''' ''p'')

where ''p'' is a program in ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The interpreter is characterized by the following property:

: Running &lt;code&gt;InterpretLanguage&lt;/code&gt; on input ''p'' returns the result of running ''p''.

Thus, if '''P''' is a program in ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which is a minimal description of ''s'', then &lt;code&gt;InterpretLanguage&lt;/code&gt;('''P''') returns the string ''s''. The length of this description of ''s'' is the sum of

# The length of the program &lt;code&gt;InterpretLanguage&lt;/code&gt;, which we can take to be the constant ''c''.
# The length of '''P''' which by definition is ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'').

This proves the desired upper bound.

==History and context==
[[Algorithmic information theory]] is the area of computer science that studies Kolmogorov complexity and other complexity measures on strings (or other [[data structure]]s).

The concept and theory of Kolmogorov Complexity is based on a crucial theorem first discovered by [[Ray Solomonoff]], who published it in 1960, describing it in "A Preliminary Report on a General Theory of Inductive Inference"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Ray Solomonoff | last=Solomonoff |first= Ray | url=http://world.std.com/~rjs/rayfeb60.pdf |format=PDF | title=A Preliminary Report on a General Theory of Inductive Inference | journal= Report V-131 | date= February 4, 1960 }} [http://world.std.com/~rjs/z138.pdf revision], Nov., 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; as part of his invention of [[algorithmic probability]]. He gave a more complete description in his 1964 publications, "A Formal Theory of Inductive Inference," Part 1 and Part 2 in ''Information and Control''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Andrey Kolmogorov later [[multiple discovery|independently published]] this theorem in ''Problems Inform. Transmission''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|volume=1 |issue=1 |year=1965 |pages=1–7 |title=Three Approaches to the Quantitative Definition of Information |url=http://www.ece.umd.edu/~abarg/ppi/contents/1-65-abstracts.html#1-65.2 |journal=Problems Inform.

Gregory Chaitin also presents this theorem in ''J. ACM''&amp;nbsp;– Chaitin's paper was submitted October 1966 and revised in December 1968, and cites both Solomonoff's and Kolmogorov's papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chaitin | first1 = Gregory J. | title = On the Simplicity and Speed of Programs for Computing Infinite Sets of Natural Numbers| url=http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~chaitin/acm69b.pdf| journal = Journal of the ACM | volume = 16 | pages = 407–422| year = 1969 | doi = 10.1145/321526.321530 | issue = 3| citeseerx = 10.1.1.15.3821 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theorem says that, among algorithms that decode strings from their descriptions (codes), there exists an optimal one. This algorithm, for all strings, allows codes as short as allowed by any other algorithm up to an additive constant that depends on the algorithms, but not on the strings themselves. Solomonoff used this algorithm, and the code lengths it allows, to define a "universal probability" of a string on which inductive inference of the subsequent digits of the string can be based. Kolmogorov used this theorem to define several functions of strings, including complexity, randomness, and information.

When Kolmogorov became aware of Solomonoff's work, he acknowledged Solomonoff's priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Kolmogorov | first1=A. | title=Logical basis for information theory and probability theory | journal=IEEE Transactions on Information Theory | volume=14|issue=5 | pages=662–664 | year=1968 | doi =10.1109/TIT.1968.1054210 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For several years, Solomonoff's work was better known in the Soviet Union than in the Western World. The general consensus in the scientific community, however, was to associate this type of complexity with Kolmogorov, who was concerned with randomness of a sequence, while Algorithmic Probability became associated with Solomonoff, who focused on prediction using his invention of the universal prior probability distribution. The broader area encompassing descriptional complexity and probability is often called Kolmogorov complexity. The computer scientist Ming Li considers this an example of the [[Matthew effect (sociology)|Matthew effect]]: "…to everyone who has more will be given…"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1007/978-0-387-49820-1_1 |chapter=Preliminaries |title=An Introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and its Applications |pages=1–99 |series=Texts in Computer Science |year=2008 |last1=Li |first1=Ming |last2=Vitányi |first2=Paul |isbn=978-0-387-33998-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several other variants of Kolmogorov complexity or algorithmic information. The most widely used one is based on [[self-delimiting program]]s, and is mainly due to [[Leonid Levin]] (1974).

An axiomatic approach to Kolmogorov complexity based on [[Blum axioms]] (Blum 1967) was introduced by Mark Burgin in the paper presented for publication by Andrey Kolmogorov.&lt;ref name=Burgin1982&gt;Burgin, M. (1982), "Generalized Kolmogorov complexity and duality in theory of computations", ''Notices of the Russian Academy of Sciences'', v.25, No. 3, pp.&amp;nbsp;19–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic results==
In the following discussion, let ''K''(''s'') be the complexity of the string ''s''.

It is not hard to see that the minimal description of a string cannot be too much larger than the string itself&amp;nbsp;— the program &lt;code&gt;GenerateFixedString&lt;/code&gt; above that outputs ''s'' is a fixed amount larger than ''s''.

'''Theorem''': There is a constant ''c'' such that

:∀''s''. ''K''(''s'') ≤ |''s''| + ''c''.

===Uncomputability of Kolmogorov complexity===

'''Theorem''': There exist strings of arbitrarily large Kolmogorov complexity. Formally: for each ''n'' ∈ ℕ, there is a string ''s'' with ''K''(''s'') ≥ ''n''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;However, an ''s'' with ''K''(''s'') = ''n'' need not exist for every ''n''. For example, if ''n'' is not a multiple of 7 bits, no [[ASCII]] program can have a length of exactly ''n'' bits.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proof:''' Otherwise all of the infinitely many possible finite strings could be generated by the finitely many&lt;ref group="note"&gt;There are 1 + 2 + 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ... + 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 different program texts of length up to ''n'' bits; cf. [[geometric series]]. If program lengths are to be multiples of 7 bits, even fewer program texts exist.&lt;/ref&gt; programs with a complexity below ''n'' bits.

'''Theorem''':  ''K'' is not a [[computable function]]. In other words, there is no program which takes a string ''s'' as input and produces the integer ''K''(''s'') as output.

The following [[indirect proof|indirect '''proof''']] uses a simple [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]-like language to denote programs; for sake of proof simplicity assume its description (i.e. an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]]) to have a length of {{val|1400000}} bits.
Assume for contradiction there is a program

   '''function''' KolmogorovComplexity('''string''' s)

which takes as input a string ''s'' and returns ''K''(''s''); for sake of proof simplicity, assume the program's length to be {{val|7000000000}} bits.
Now, consider the following program of length {{val|1288}} bits:

   '''function''' GenerateComplexString()
      '''for''' i = 1 '''to''' infinity:
         '''for each''' string s '''of''' length exactly i
            '''if''' KolmogorovComplexity(s) &gt;= 8000000000
               '''return''' s

Using &lt;code&gt;KolmogorovComplexity&lt;/code&gt; as a subroutine, the program tries every string, starting with the shortest, until it returns a string with Kolmogorov complexity at least {{val|8000000000}} bits,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;By the previous theorem, such a string exists, hence the &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop will eventually terminate.&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. a string that cannot be produced by any program shorter than {{val|8000000000}} bits. However, the overall length of the above program that produced ''s'' is only {{val|7001401288}} bits,&lt;ref group=note&gt;including the language interpreter and the subroutine code for &lt;code&gt;KolmogorovComplexity&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which is a contradiction. (If the code of &lt;code&gt;KolmogorovComplexity&lt;/code&gt; is shorter, the contradiction remains. If it is longer, the constant used in &lt;code&gt;GenerateComplexString&lt;/code&gt; can always be changed appropriately.)&lt;ref group=note&gt;If &lt;code&gt;KolmogorovComplexity&lt;/code&gt; has length ''n'' bits, the constant ''m'' used in &lt;code&gt;GenerateComplexString&lt;/code&gt; needs to be adapted to satisfy {{nobreak|''n'' + {{val|1400000}} + {{val|1218}} + 7·log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(''m'') &lt; ''m''}}, which is always possible since ''m'' grows faster than log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(''m'').&lt;/ref&gt;

The above proof uses a contradiction similar to that of the [[Berry paradox]]: "&lt;sub&gt;{{color|#8080ff|1}}&lt;/sub&gt;The &lt;sub&gt;{{color|#8080ff|2}}&lt;/sub&gt;smallest &lt;sub&gt;{{color|#8080ff|3}}&lt;/sub&gt;positive &lt;sub&gt;{{color|#8080ff|4}}&lt;/sub&gt;integer &lt;sub&gt;{{color|#8080ff|5}}&lt;/sub&gt;that &lt;sub&gt;{{color|#8080ff|6}}&lt;/sub&gt;cannot &lt;sub&gt;{{color|#8080ff|7}}&lt;/sub&gt;be &lt;sub&gt;{{color|#8080ff|8}}&lt;/sub&gt;defined &lt;sub&gt;{{color|#8080ff|9}}&lt;/sub&gt;in &lt;sub&gt;{{color|#8080ff|10}}&lt;/sub&gt;fewer &lt;sub&gt;{{color|#8080ff|11}}&lt;/sub&gt;than &lt;sub&gt;{{color|#8080ff|12}}&lt;/sub&gt;twenty &lt;sub&gt;{{color|#8080ff|13}}&lt;/sub&gt;English &lt;sub&gt;{{color|#8080ff|14}}&lt;/sub&gt;words". It is also possible to show the non-computability of ''K'' by reduction from the non-computability of the halting problem ''H'', since ''K'' and ''H'' are [[turing degree#Turing equivalence|Turing-equivalent]].&lt;ref&gt;Stated without proof in: [http://www.daimi.au.dk/~bromille/DC05/Kolmogorov.pdf "Course notes for Data Compression - Kolmogorov complexity"], 2005, P. B. Miltersen, p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a corollary, humorously called the "[[full employment theorem]]" in the programming language community, stating that there is no perfect size-optimizing compiler.

==== A naive attempt at a program to compute ''K'' ====

At first glance it might seem trivial to write a program which can compute ''K''(''s'') for any ''s'' (thus disproving the above theorem), such as the following:

   '''function''' KolmogorovComplexity('''string''' s)
      '''for''' i = 1 '''to''' infinity:
         '''for each''' string p '''of''' length exactly i
            '''if''' isValidProgram(p) '''and''' evaluate(p) == s
               '''return''' i

This program iterates through all possible programs (by iterating through all possible strings and only considering those which are valid programs), starting with the shortest. Each program is executed to find the result produced by that program, comparing it to the input ''s''. If the result matches the length of the program is returned.

However this will not work because some of the programs ''p'' tested will not terminate, e.g. if they contain infinite loops. There is no way to avoid all of these programs by testing them in some way before executing them due to the non-computability of the halting problem.

:''K''(''X'',''Y'') ≤ ''K''(''X'') + ''K''(''Y''|''X'') + ''O''(log(''K''(''X'',''Y''))).

It states that the shortest program that reproduces ''X'' and ''Y'' is [[Big-O notation|no more]] than a logarithmic term larger than a program to reproduce ''X'' and a program to reproduce ''Y'' given ''X''. Using this statement, one can define [[Mutual information#Absolute mutual information|an analogue of mutual information for Kolmogorov complexity]].

==Compression==
It is straightforward to compute upper bounds for ''K''(''s'')&amp;nbsp;– simply [[data compression|compress]] the string ''s'' with some method, implement the corresponding decompressor in the chosen language, concatenate the decompressor to the compressed string, and measure the length of the resulting string&amp;nbsp;– concretely, the size of a [[self-extracting archive]] in the given language.

A string ''s'' is compressible by a number ''c'' if it has a description whose length does not exceed |''s''| − ''c'' bits. This is equivalent to saying that ''K''(''s'') ≤ |''s''| − ''c''.  Otherwise, ''s'' is incompressible by ''c''. A string incompressible by 1 is said to be simply ''incompressible''&amp;nbsp;– by the [[pigeonhole principle]], which applies because every compressed string maps to only one uncompressed string, [[incompressible string]]s must exist, since there are 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; bit strings of length ''n'', but only 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 shorter strings, that is, strings of length less than ''n'', (i.e. with length 0, 1, …, ''n&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1).&lt;ref group=note&gt;As there are {{nobr|1=''N''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;''L''&lt;/sup&gt;}} strings of length ''L'', the number of strings of lengths {{nowrap|1=''L'' = 0, 1, …, ''n'' − 1}} is {{nobr|''N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''N''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + … + ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;}} = {{nobr|2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + … + 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which is a finite [[geometric series]] with sum {{nobr|2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + … + 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} = {{nobr|1 = 2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; × (1 − 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) / (1 − 2) = 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the same reason, most strings are complex in the sense that they cannot be significantly compressed&amp;nbsp;– their ''K''(''s'') is not much smaller than |''s''|, the length of ''s'' in bits. To make this precise, fix a value of ''n''. There are 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; bitstrings of length ''n''. The [[Uniform distribution (discrete)|uniform]] [[probability]] distribution on the space of these bitstrings assigns exactly equal weight 2&lt;sup&gt;−''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to each string of length ''n''.

'''Theorem''': With the uniform probability distribution on the space of bitstrings of length ''n'', the probability that a string is incompressible by ''c'' is at least 1 − 2&lt;sup&gt;−''c''+1&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;−''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

To prove the theorem, note that the number of descriptions of length not exceeding ''n'' − ''c'' is given by the geometric series:

: 1 + 2 + 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + … + 2&lt;sup&gt;''n'' − ''c''&lt;/sup&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''−''c''+1&lt;/sup&gt; − 1.

There remain at least

: 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''−''c''+1&lt;/sup&gt; + 1

bitstrings of length ''n'' that are incompressible by ''c''.  To determine the probability, divide by 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Chaitin's incompleteness theorem==
[[File:Kolmogorov complexity and computable lower bounds.gif|thumb|right|500px|Kolmogorov complexity {{color|#800000|''K''(''s'')}}, and two computable lower bound functions &lt;code&gt;{{color|#808000|prog1(s)}}&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;{{color|#008000|prog2(s)}}&lt;/code&gt;. The horizontal axis ([[logarithmic scale]]) enumerates all [[string (computer science)|strings]] ''s'', ordered by length; the vertical axis ([[linear scale]]) measures Kolmogorov complexity in [[bit]]s. Most strings are incompressible, i.e. their Kolmogorov complexity exceeds their length by a constant amount. 17 compressible strings are shown in the picture, appearing as almost vertical slopes. Due to Chaitin's incompleteness theorem (1974), the output of any program computing a lower bound of the Kolmogorov complexity cannot exceed some fixed limit, which is independent of the input string ''s''.]]
We know that, in the set of all possible strings, most strings are complex in the sense that they cannot be described in any significantly "compressed" way. However, it turns out that the fact that a specific string is complex cannot be formally proven, if the complexity of the string is above a certain threshold. The precise formalization is as follows. First, fix a particular [[axiomatic system]] '''S''' for the [[natural number]]s. The axiomatic system has to be powerful enough so that, to certain assertions  '''A''' about complexity of strings, one can associate a formula '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;'''A'''&lt;/sub&gt; in '''S'''. This association must have the following property:

If '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;'''A'''&lt;/sub&gt; is provable from the axioms of '''S''', then the corresponding assertion '''A''' must be true. This "formalization" can be achieved, either by an artificial encoding such as a [[Gödel numbering]], or by a formalization which more clearly respects the intended interpretation of '''S'''.

'''Theorem''': There exists a constant ''L'' (which only depends on the particular axiomatic system and the choice of description language) such that there does not exist a string ''s'' for which the statement

:''K''(''s'') ≥  ''L'' (as formalized in '''S''')

can be proven within the axiomatic system '''S'''.

Note that, by the abundance of nearly incompressible strings, the vast majority of those statements must be true.

The proof of this result is modeled on a self-referential construction used in [[Berry's paradox]]. The proof is by contradiction. If the theorem were false, then

:'''Assumption (X)''': For any integer ''n'' there exists a string ''s'' for which there is a proof in '''S''' of the formula "''K''(''s'')&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''n''" (which we assume can be formalized in '''S''').

We can find an effective enumeration of all the formal proofs in '''S''' by some procedure

   '''function''' NthProof('''int''' ''n'')
which takes as input ''n'' and outputs some proof. This function enumerates all proofs. Some of these are proofs for formulas we do not care about here, since every possible proof in the language of '''S''' is produced for some ''n''. Some of these are complexity formulas of the form ''K''(''s'')&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''n'' where ''s'' and ''n'' are constants in the language of '''S'''. There is a program

   '''function''' NthProofProvesComplexityFormula('''int''' ''n'')

which determines whether the ''n''th proof actually proves a complexity formula ''K''(''s'')&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''L''. The strings ''s'', and the integer ''L'' in turn, are computable by programs:

   '''function''' StringNthProof('''int''' ''n'')

   '''function''' ComplexityLowerBoundNthProof('''int''' ''n'')

Consider the following program

   '''function''' GenerateProvablyComplexString('''int''' ''n'')
      '''for''' i = 1 to infinity:
         '''if'''  NthProofProvesComplexityFormula(i) '''and''' ComplexityLowerBoundNthProof(i) ≥ ''n''
            '''return''' StringNthProof(''i'')

Given an ''n'', this program tries every proof until it finds a string and a proof in the [[formal system]] '''S''' of the formula ''K''(''s'')&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''L'' for some ''L''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''n''. The program terminates by our '''Assumption (X)'''. Now, this program has a length ''U''. There is an integer ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; such that ''U''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''C''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''C'' is the overhead cost of

    '''function''' GenerateProvablyParadoxicalString()
       '''return''' GenerateProvablyComplexString(''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)

(note that ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is hard-coded into the above function, and the summand log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) already allows for its encoding). The program GenerateProvablyParadoxicalString outputs a string ''s'' for which there exists an ''L'' such that ''K''(''s'')&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''L'' can be formally proved in '''S''' with ''L''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. In particular, ''K''(''s'')&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is true. However, ''s'' is also described by a program of length ''U''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''C'', so its complexity is less than ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  This contradiction proves '''Assumption (X)''' cannot hold.

Similar ideas are used to prove the properties of [[Chaitin's constant]].

==Minimum message length==
{{Main|Minimum message length}}
The minimum message length principle of statistical and inductive inference and machine learning was developed by [[Chris Wallace (computer scientist)|C.S. Wallace]] and D.M. Boulton in 1968. MML is [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] (i.e. it incorporates prior beliefs) and information-theoretic. It has the desirable properties of statistical invariance (i.e. the inference transforms with a re-parametrisation, such as from polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates), statistical consistency (i.e. even for very hard problems, MML will converge to any underlying model) and efficiency (i.e. the MML model will converge to any true underlying model about as quickly as is possible). C.S. Wallace and D.L. Dowe (1999) showed a formal connection between MML and algorithmic information theory (or Kolmogorov complexity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |citeseerx=10.1.1.17.321 |title=Minimum Message Length and Kolmogorov Complexity |journal=Computer Journal |volume=42 |pages=270–283 |year=1999 |last1=Wallace |first1=C. S. |last2=Dowe |first2=D. L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kolmogorov randomness==
{{See also|Algorithmic randomness}}
''Kolmogorov randomness'' defines a string (usually of [[bit]]s) as being [[randomness|random]] if and only if it is shorter than any [[computer program]] that can produce that string.  To make this precise, a [[Universal Turing machine|universal computer]] (or universal Turing machine) must be specified, so that "program" means a program for this universal machine. A random string in this sense is "incompressible" in that it is impossible to "compress" the string into a program whose length is shorter than the length of the string itself.  A [[counting argument]] is used to show that, for any universal computer, there is at least one algorithmically random string of each length.  Whether any particular string is random, however, depends on the specific universal computer that is chosen.

This definition can be extended to define a notion of randomness for ''infinite'' sequences from a finite alphabet. These [[algorithmically random sequence]]s can be defined in three equivalent ways. One way uses an effective analogue of [[measure theory]]; another uses effective [[Martingale (probability theory)|martingales]].  The third way defines an infinite sequence to be random if the prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity of its initial segments grows quickly enough&amp;nbsp;— there must be a constant ''c'' such that the complexity of an initial segment of length ''n'' is always at least ''n''−''c''.  This definition, unlike the definition of randomness for a finite string, is not affected by which universal machine is used to define prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/s0019-9958(66)80018-9 |title=The definition of random sequences |journal=Information and Control |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=602–619 |year=1966 |last1=Martin-Löf |first1=Per }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to entropy==
For dynamical systems, entropy rate and algorithmic complexity of the trajectories are related by a theorem of Brudno, that the equality K(x;T) =  h(T) holds for almost all x.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Stefano Galatolo, Mathieu Hoyrup, Cristóbal Rojas |title=Effective symbolic dynamics, random points, statistical behavior, complexity and entropy | journal=Information and Computation | volume=208 | pages=23–41 | year=2010| url=http://www.loria.fr/~hoyrup/random_ergodic.pdf | doi=10.1016/j.ic.2009.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be shown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |author=Alexei Kaltchenko |title=Algorithms for Estimating Information Distance with Application to Bioinformatics and Linguistics  |year=2004 |eprint=cs.CC/0404039}}&lt;/ref&gt; that for the output of [[Markov information source]]s, Kolmogorov complexity is related to the [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] of the information source. More precisely, the Kolmogorov complexity of the output of a Markov information source, normalized by the length of the output, converges almost surely (as the length of the output goes to infinity) to the [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] of the source.

==Applications==
The notion of Kolmogorov complexity has been used to evaluate the complexity of geographical areas from maps or from field observations.&lt;ref name=Papadimitriou2002&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1470-160X(02)00052-3 |title=Modelling indicators and indices of landscape complexity: An approach using G.I.S |journal=Ecological Indicators |volume=2 |pages=17–25 |year=2002 |last1=Papadimitriou |first1=F. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conditional versions==
{{expand section|date=July 2014}}
The conditional Kolmogorov complexity of two strings &lt;math&gt;K(x|y)&lt;/math&gt; is, roughly speaking, defined as the Kolmogorov complexity of ''x'' given ''y'' as an auxiliary input to the procedure.&lt;ref name="Rissanen2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jorma Rissanen|title=Information and Complexity in Statistical Modeling|year=2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-387-68812-1|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ming Li|author2=Paul M.B.

{{Expand French|La Tribune de l'art|date=October 2017}}
'''''La Tribune de l'art''''' (''The Art Tribune'') is a French online magazine on art history and western heritage from the Middle Ages to the 1930s. It was set up on 7 April 2003 by [[Didier Rykner]], art historian and former agronomist.&lt;ref name="Monde"&gt;{{fr icon}} [[Harry Bellet]], ''Didier Rykner Le gardien du temple'', [[Le Monde]], 19 January 2007 [http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=973505&amp;clef=ARC-TRK-NC_01 online (chrage)] (page accessed 28 March 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;. &lt;!---Selon la déclaration d'intention de son fondateur&lt;ref&gt;Didier Rykner, ''Qu’est-ce que La Tribune de l’Art ?'', editorial, 7 April 2003 [http://www.latribunedelart.com/qu-est-ce-que-em-la-tribune-de-l-art-em-article002241.html online] (page accessed 28 March 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;, ce magazine vise à :
* dénoncer les atteintes « inadmissibles » au patrimoine
* contribuer aux débats sur la protection du patrimoine, la restauration ou l’attribution d'œuvres d'art
* présenter des dossiers d'investigation
* publier des articles scientifiques inédits ou « parus dans des publications peu accessibles »
* rendre compte des expositions concernant son domaine d'étude sur reconnaissance directe et non « à partir des dossiers de presse »
* faire part des nouvelles acquisitions des musées.

== Développement ==

Le magazine propose des [[Éditorial|éditoriaux]], des actualités sur les expositions, les publications, les musées, le patrimoine, le marché de l'art, l'ensemble étant accompagné de brèves et de débats. Le courrier des lecteurs dénote l'intérêt des professionnels, qu'ils soient à l'inspection des [[Monument historique (France)|monuments historiques]] (tel Olivier Poisson&lt;ref&gt;Courrier, ''Courrier d’Olivier Poisson, en réaction à la brève du 8/10/05 à propos des architectes des monuments historiques'', La Tribune de l'art, 16 octobre 2005 [http://www.latribunedelart.com/courrier-d-olivier-poisson-en-reaction-a-la-breve-du-8-10-05-a-propos-des-architectes-des-monuments-historiques-article001751.html lire en ligne] (page consultée le 31 mars 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}&lt;ref&gt;Courrier, ''Réponse d’Olivier Poisson aux derniers arguments d’Anne Vuillemard et de Didier Rykner'', La Tribune de l'art, 26 octobre 2005 [http://www.latribunedelart.com/reponse-d-olivier-poisson-aux-derniers-arguments-d-anne-vuillemard-et-de-didier-rykner-article001755.html lire en ligne] (page consultée le 31 mars 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;) ou à de hauts postes de conservation (comme Pierre Arizzoli-Clémentel, ancien directeur du [[Château de Versailles|château et domaine de Versailles]]&lt;ref&gt;Courrier, ''Courrier de Monsieur Pierre Arizzoli-Clémentel, suite à notre article sur Versailles'', La Tribune de l'art, 12 avril 2007 [http://www.latribunedelart.com/courrier-de-monsieur-pierre-arizzoli-clementel-suite-a-notre-article-sur-versailles-article002234.html lire en ligne] (page consultée le 31 mars 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}&lt;ref&gt;Monsieur Arizzoli-Clémentel a été nommé depuis président de la commission du musée du Luxembourg (juillet 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;).

Le caractère incisif des éditoriaux du directeur de publication, par ailleurs [[rédacteur en chef]] du magazine, est très régulièrement souligné&lt;ref name="Monde"/&gt;{{,}}&lt;ref&gt;Actualités, ''Didier Rykner : Le tribun de l’art'', [[Le Nouvel Observateur]], n° 2413, 3 février 2011&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}&lt;ref&gt;François Dufay, ''Les folies de Versailles'', [[Le Point]], 5 avril 2007 [http://www.lepoint.fr/culture/les-folies-de-versailles/249/0/177601 lire en ligne] (page consultée le 28 mars 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;.

''La Tribune de l'art'' est à l'origine de la pétition « Les musées ne sont pas à vendre » (7 janvier 2007&lt;ref&gt;Didier Rykner, ''Non'', éditorial du 7 janvier 2007 [http://www.latribunedelart.com/non-article00193.html lire en ligne] (page consultée le 28 mars 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;) contre le prêt payant d'œuvres d'art nationales à des musées étrangers (''loan fees'') et l'implantation d'une [[Louvre Abou Dabi|antenne du Louvre à Abou Dabi]]&lt;ref name="Monde"/&gt;{{,}}&lt;ref&gt;Annick Colonna-Césari, ''Faut-il exporter le Louvre ?'', [[L'Express]], 7 février 2007 [http://www.lexpress.fr/culture/art-plastique/musee/faut-il-exporter-le-louvre_478428.html lire en ligne] (page consultée le 28 mars 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;. Il lui arrive d'être le premier à souligner, voire à publier, des informations sensibles comme la mise en vente (retirée ''in extremis'') chez [[Sotheby's]] d'un [[Edgar Degas|Degas]] volé&lt;ref&gt;Harry Bellet, ''Le mystère de la blanchisseuse'', Le Monde, 18 novembre 2010 [http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=1140663 lire en ligne (sur abonnément)] (page consultée le 28 mars 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; ou, plus notablement, le projet controversé de [[Contrat de bail|location]] par l'État de l'[[hôtel de la Marine]], édifice classé situé [[place de la Concorde]] à Paris&lt;ref&gt;Didier Rykner, ''L’État va-t-il se débarrasser de l’Hôtel de la Marine ?'', éditorial du 23 février 2009 [http://www.latribunedelart.com/l-etat-va-t-il-se-debarrasser-de-l-hotel-de-la-marine-article001515.html lire en ligne] (page consultée le 28 mars 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;.

En [[2008]], le rédacteur en chef du magazine a reçu le prix de ''[[La Demeure historique]]'' dans la catégorie « prix du journaliste, presse écrite - internet »&lt;ref&gt;Communiqué, ''Didier Rykner'', [[La Demeure historique]], Palmarès des prix 2008 [http://www.demeure-historique.org/spip.php?article803 lire en ligne] (page consultée le 28 mars 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;.

Une version anglaise du site nommée ''The Art Tribune'', qui reprend les principaux articles de la version française, a également vu le jour&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thearttribune.com/ Site internet « The Art Tribune ».]&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Lost artworks''' are original pieces of art that credible sources indicate once existed but that cannot be accounted for in museums or private collections or are known to have been [[Iconoclasm|destroyed deliberately]] or accidentally, or neglected through ignorance and lack of [[connoisseurship]].

The US [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] maintains a list of "Top Ten Art Crimes";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/violent-crime/art-theft|title=FBI — Art Theft|work=FBI}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 2006 book by Simon Houpt&lt;ref name="Houpt2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Houpt |first=Simon |title=Museum of the Missing: The High Stakes of Art Crime |year=2006 |publisher=Key Porter Books |isbn=978-1-86189-316-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several other media outlets have profiled the most significant outstanding losses.

==Chronology of notable loss events==
&lt;!-- Consistent and concise format is: Identifying place proper name as indicated elsewhere on English wiki (should be linked out to that page) followed by a 1-2 word event-type descriptor ("fire", "theft") then comma plus the most specific date possible in euro format: "Gosford House fire, 1940". Use a geographic designation only to differentiate between places with exactly the same name (i.e. Museum of Modern Art). If event has a globally recognized standard name (i.e. "Bonfire of the Vanities" that supersedes this convention) ---&gt;

== Research and recovery efforts ==

The [[Art Loss Register]] is a commercial computerized international database which captures information about lost and stolen art, antiques and collectables. It is operated by a commercial company based in London.

In the U.S., the FBI maintains the [https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/violent-crime/art-theft/national-stolen-art-file|National Stolen Art File], "a database of stolen art and cultural property. Stolen objects are submitted for entry to the NSAF by law enforcement agencies in the U.S. and abroad."&lt;ref name="FBI20160930"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Stolen Art File|url=https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/violent-crime/art-theft/national-stolen-art-file|website=fbi.gov|publisher=FBI|accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of search and recovery efforts were created in response to major loss events, notably:
*[[Monuments Men|Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program ("Monuments Men"), 1943–1946]]
*[[World War II looting of Poland#Efforts to locate and reclaim the lost art|Bureau of Revindication and Damages (Poland), operated from 1945 to 1951]]
*[[World War II looting of Poland#Efforts to locate and reclaim the lost art|Bureau of the Government Representative for Polish Cultural Heritage Abroad, 1991-]]

The '''Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities''' is a [[nonprofit organization]] dedicated to furthering the education of residents of the state of [[Louisiana]].  In its [[Mission statement|mission]], the Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities provides access to and promotes an appreciation of the history of Louisiana and its literary and [[cultural history]].&lt;ref name="Mission"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission Statement|url=http://www.leh.org/our-mission/|website=Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities|accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1972 as a result of initial funding by the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]].&lt;ref name="NEHfounding"&gt;{{cite web|title=Initial funding of state humanities councils by the NEH|url=http://www.neh.gov/about/history/timeline|website=National Endowment for the Humanities|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding and history==
Beginning in 1971, the National Endowment for the Humanities initiated an experimental [[adult education]] program to various states, consisting of grants to the states to promote state-based programs of informal adult education in the humanities.&lt;ref name="TP1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Grants Given for Education: Louisiana Among Group in Humanities|publisher=''[[The Times-Picayune]]''|date=July 5, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities came into existence in 1972, as the 17th program of its kind in the United States.  Initially, the Louisiana Committee for the Humanities administered the program, as the Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities was becoming a formalized institution.  It is one of more than fifty [[List of state humanities councils|state humanities councils]] established to give individual states greater autonomy in the [[humanities]].

The Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities has been headquartered at Turners' Hall in the [[New Orleans Central Business District|Central Business District of New Orleans]] since 2007.  Its location in this building is historically significant because of the construction of this building in 1868 by the [[Turners|Society of Turners]] as a [[social club]] for [[German-American]] citizens.&lt;ref name="Turners' Hall"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Turners' Hall|url=http://www.leh.org/lhc/|website=Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities|accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs and publications==

During the period 2008 to 2012, the Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities in partnership with the National Endowment for the Humanities funded $6.4 million in projects to institutions and individuals to preserve the cultural heritage of Louisiana.&lt;ref name="NEH2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Talking Points: Louisiana|url=http://www.neh.gov/news/talking-point/louisiana|website=National Endowment for the Humanities|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization funds programs of types including: discussions, documentaries, digital media, exhibition development, festivals pertinent to Louisiana's cultural heritage, publications, and scholar-in-residence programs.

The Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities administers the Louisiana Humanist of the Year Award.&lt;ref name="Awards"&gt;{{cite web|title=LEH Humanities Awards|url=http://www.leh.org/humanities-awards/|website=Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some representative winners of this award are listed in the table.  Other awards administered by the Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities include, and are not limited to:  the Champion of Culture Award, the Humanities Book Award, the Humanities Documentary Film Award, and the Light Up for Literacy Award.&lt;ref name="Awards" /&gt;  Criteria for each award are articulated for purposes of nominations.&lt;ref name="Drum"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nominations accepted for the 2015 Humanities Awards|url=http://www.thedrumnewspaper.info/?p=2863|website=The Drum Newspaper|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the deep ocean, '''marine snow''' is a continuous shower of mostly organic [[detritus]] falling from the upper layers of the [[water column]]. It is a significant means of exporting [[energy]] from the [[light]]-rich [[photic zone]] to the [[aphotic zone]] below.  The term was first coined by the explorer [[William Beebe]] as he observed it from his [[bathysphere]].  As the origin of marine snow lies in activities within the productive photic zone, the prevalence of marine snow changes with seasonal fluctuations in [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] activity and [[ocean current]]s. Marine snow can be an important food source for organisms living in the aphotic zone, particularly for organisms which live very deep in the water column.

==Composition==
Marine snow is made up of a variety of mostly organic matter, including dead or dying animals and [[phytoplankton]], [[protist]]s, fecal matter, sand, and other inorganic dust. Most trapped particles are more vulnerable to grazers than they would be as free floating individuals and can be classified as "olive green" or "gray body" cells, which are plant parts and degrading plant material. A majority of marine snow composition is actually made up of aggregates of smaller particles held together by a sugary mucus, transparent extracellular [[polysaccharide]]s (TEPs). These are natural [[polymer]]s exuded as waste products mostly by phytoplankton and [[bacterium|bacteria]]. [[Mucus]] secreted by [[zooplankton]] (mostly [[salps]], [[appendicularia]]ns, and [[pteropoda|pteropods]]) also contribute to the constituents of marine snow aggregates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Miller | first=Charles B. | title=Biological Oceanography | year=2004 | publisher=Blackwell Science Ltd.| pages=94–5, 266–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These aggregates grow over time and may reach several centimeters in diameter, traveling for weeks before reaching the ocean floor.

Marine snow often forms during [[algal bloom]]s. As phytoplankton accumulate, they aggregate or get captured in other aggregates, both of which accelerate the sinking rate. Aggregation and sinking is actually thought to be a large component of sources for algae loss from surface water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Mann| first=K.H. |last2=Lazier |first2=J.R.N | title=Dynamics of Marine Ecosystems | year=2006 | publisher=Blackwell Publishing| page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most organic components of marine snow are consumed by [[microbe]]s, [[zooplankton]] and other filter-feeding animals within the first 1,000 metres of their journey. In this way marine snow may be considered the foundation of deep-sea [[mesopelagic]] and [[benthic]] [[ecosystem]]s: As sunlight cannot reach them, deep-sea organisms rely heavily on marine snow as an energy source. The small percentage of material not consumed in shallower waters becomes incorporated into the muddy "ooze" blanketing the ocean floor, where it is further decomposed through biological activity.

Marine snow aggregates exhibit characteristics that fit Goldman's "aggregate spinning wheel hypothesis". This hypothesis states that phytoplankton, microorganisms and bacteria live attached to aggregate surfaces and are involved in rapid nutrient recycling. Phytoplankton have been shown to be able to take up nutrients from small local concentrations of organic material (e.g. fecal matter from an individual zooplankton cell, regenerated nutrients from organic decomposition by bacteria).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McCarthy J.J |author2=Goldman J.C. | title=Nitrogenous nutrition of marine phytoplankton in nutrient-depleted waters | doi=10.1126/science.203.4381.670  | year=1979 | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume=203 | pages=670–672 | pmid=17813381}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the aggregates slowly sink to the bottom of the ocean, the many microorganisms residing on them are constantly respiring and contribute greatly to the [[microbial loop]].

==Aggregation==
Aggregates begin as the colloidal fraction, which typically contains particles sized between 1&amp;nbsp;nm and several micrometers.  The colloidal fraction of the ocean contains a large amount of organic matter unavailable to grazers.  This fraction has a much higher total mass than either phytoplankton or bacteria but is not readily available due to size characteristics of the particles in relation to potential consumers.  The colloidal fraction must aggregate in order to be more [[bioavailability|bioavailable]].  Aggregation theory outlines main mechanisms by which marine aggregates may form and are as follows:
;[[Brownian motion]]
:Brownian motion, also known as the Brownian Pump in this case, describes the interaction between individual particles in the colloid fraction.  Particles in Brownian motion interact randomly due to the impact of solute molecules.  These interactions lead to collision and aggregation of these small particles.  The small aggregates then collide and aggregate with other aggregates and particles until the aggregate in question is several micrometers in diameter.
;[[shear (fluid)|Shear]]
:Once particles have aggregated to several micrometers in diameter, they begin to accumulate bacteria, since there is sufficient site space for feeding and reproduction. At this size it is large enough to undergo sinking.  It also has the components necessary to fit the "aggregate spinning wheel hypothesis". Evidence for this has been found by Alldredge and Cohen (1987) who found evidence of both respiration and photosynthesis within aggregates, suggesting the presence of both [[autotrophic]] and [[heterotrophic]] organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Alldredge, A.L.  |author2=Cohen, Y.  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Can microscale chemical patches persist in the sea?  Microelectrode study of marine snow, fecal pellets. | year=1987 | journal=Science | volume=235| pages=689–691 | doi = 10.1126/science.235.4789.689 | issue=4789 | pmid=17833630}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Differential [[settling]]
:This form of aggregation involves particles sinking at different rates and their collision to form aggregates.
;[[diffusion|Diffusive]] capture
:Diffusive capture describes a particle that is advected into the diffusion-limited boundary layer of another particle and is eventually captured/collides with that particle.
;Surface [[coagulation]]
:Aggregates may also form from colloids trapped on the surface of rising [[Liquid bubble|bubble]]s.  For example, Kepkay et al. found that bubble coagulation leads to an increase in bacterial respiration since more food is available to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Kepkay, P.E.| title=Particle aggregation and the biological activity of colloids| year=1994 | journal=Marine Ecology Project Series | volume=109 | pages=293–304 | doi=10.3354/meps109293}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, a storm at sea could increase bacterial respiration by up to 36 fold for two to four hours.
;[[Filtration]]
:Particles and small organisms floating through the water column can become trapped within aggregates.  Marine snow aggregates are porous, however, and some particles are able to pass through them.
;Bacterial motility
:It is unclear how relevant this mode of aggregation is to marine snow, but there have been limited observations of bacteria moving fast and far enough to capture colloidal particles.

Aggregation theory represents a two state system.  At low cell concentrations aggregation is relatively unimportant and somewhat more unlikely.  However, at higher cell concentrations it becomes increasingly important.  A model has been proposed to characterize the formation of marine aggregates and the loss due to sinking:

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d} C_{1} }{\mathrm{d} t} = g C_1 - 20.8\alpha r^{3} G C_1^2|&lt;/math&gt;}}
where
*''C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the concentration of the cells
*''r'' is the radius of each cell
*''G'' is the shearing rate
*''&amp;alpha;'' is the stickiness coefficient
*''g'' is the growth rate.

Thus, aggregation of marine particles is more prevalent when cell and particle concentration is higher (e.g. algal blooms)

==Study==
'''Export production''' is the amount of [[organic matter]] produced in the [[ocean]] by [[primary production]] that is not recycled ([[remineralisation|remineralised]]) before it sinks into the [[aphotic zone]].  Because of the role of export production in the ocean's [[biological pump]], it is typically measured in units of [[carbon]] (e.g. [[milligram|mg]] C [[square metre|m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[day|d&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;]]).

The fraction of primary production that is exported to the aphotic zone is generally higher when primary production occurs in short (seasonal) bursts, than when it occurs more evenly spread out across a year.

Because of the relatively long residence time of the ocean's [[thermohaline circulation]], carbon transported as marine snow into the deep ocean by the [[biological pump]] can remain out of contact with the atmosphere for more than 1000 years.  That is, when the marine snow is finally decomposed to inorganic nutrients and dissolved [[carbon dioxide]], these are effectively isolated from the surface ocean for relatively long time-scales related to [[ocean circulation]].  Consequently, enhancing the quantity of marine snow that reaches the deep ocean is the basis of several [[climate engineering|geoengineering]] schemes to enhance [[carbon sequestration]] by the ocean.  [[Ocean nourishment]] and [[iron fertilisation]] seek to boost the production of organic material in the surface ocean, with a concomitant rise in marine snow reaching the deep ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lampitt | first=Richard | title=Ocean fertilisation: a potential means of geoengineering? | year=2008 | journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc. A]] | volume=366 | pages=3919–3945 | doi=10.1098/rsta.2008.0139 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These efforts have not yet produced a sustainable fertilization that effectively transports carbon out of the system.

Increases in ocean temperatures, a projected indicator of [[climate change]], may result in a decrease in the production of marine snow due to the enhanced [[stratification (water)|stratification]] of the water column.  Increasing stratification decreases the availability of phytoplankton nutrients such as [[nitrate]], [[phosphate]] and [[silicic acid]], and could lead to a decrease in primary production and, thus, marine snow.

Marine snow has also begun to garner interest from [[microbiology|microbiologists]], owing to the microbial communities associated with it. Recent research indicates transported bacteria may exchange [[gene]]s with previously thought to be isolated populations of bacteria inhabiting the breadth of the ocean floor. In such an immense area there may be as yet undiscovered species tolerant of high pressures and extreme cold, perhaps finding use in [[bioengineering]] and [[pharmacy]].

'''Mission Muralismo''' was an artistic movement that brought awareness of issues as well as depicted everyday life as lived by the people in the [[Mission District, San Francisco|San Francisco Mission District]] and other barrios around the world. The Mission was an artistic playground for muralists to speak out about injustices and social issues around their city, the country and the world. Latin American muralists voiced their cries for international attention and aimed to create awareness for the social and political problems of Latin America through the murals they painted. The [[Nicaraguan]] community especially contributed to artistic projects to shed light on the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]] and their struggles from 1979 to the 1990s.

== Origins and Influences ==

Murialismo can credit its origins to agencies like the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA), a [[New Deal]] federal program established during the Great Depression to employ millions of struggling Americans to carry out public works projects along with supporting large arts, drama, media, and literacy projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kennedy|first=David|title=Freedom From Fear|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-9650868-9-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WPA helped fund artists like [[Diego Rivera]] in the 1930s, who helped bring an international muralist perspective to the Mission District. Other muralists like [[David Siqueiros|David Alfaro Siquieros]] and [[José Clemente Orozco]] who, with Rivera, made up the group Los Tres Grandes, also continued to innovate and bring “stylistic orthodoxy” to make “ideological and religious tableaux”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacoby|first=Annice|title=Street Art San Francisco: Mission Muralismo|year=2009|publisher=Abrams|isbn=978-0-8109-9635-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This foundation and influence was at the core of Mission Muralismo as values like being “outscale” and “outspoken” became standard in the murals and projects painted throughout the decades. The nature of being outspoken is what helped contribute to the precedent that murals in the Mission District aimed to present.

== Solidarity with Latin American Movements ==

Beyond Mexican muralists in the 1930s to the 1960s, there was a growing Central American refugees escaping political turbulence and civil war in the 1970s, some of whom found refuge in the Mission District. Nicaraguan artists and poets in particular found a home in San Francisco to build a solidarity movement with the Nicaraguan struggle. [[Roberto Vargas (poet)|Roberto Vargas]], a famed literary figure in the Nicaraguan community, critically stated, “we came in the human wave fleeing the brutality of the Somoza regime”—the human wave being the vast migration of Nicaraguan refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perez|first=Gina M.|title=Beyond El Barrio|year=2010|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8147-9129-5|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; With poets and artists like Vargas, along with the aftermath of the political atmosphere of the late 1960s in the Bay Area, the struggle to liberate Nicaragua from Somoza’s regime continued in the Mission District. The Nicaraguans who came from that human wave banded together and created a movement from the barrio, showing a strong sense of solidarity for the Sandinista struggle in Nicaragua by setting up offices for the Sandinista Front and spreading the word on the uprising through La Prensa, a newspaper from Managua, Nicaragua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perez|first=Gina M.|title=Beyond El Barrio|year=2010|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8147-9129-5|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Murals ==

The Sandinista victory brought forth a great sense of pride from the Nicaraguan community as well as building bridges with other Latin American communities. The exterior of Casa Nicargua in the Mission District boasts a mural featuring “Chilean and Nicaraguan symbols beneath a handshake of support between the two countries,” reflecting the respect the Nicaraguan community has for the [[Chile]]an government under the fallen President [[Salvador Allende]] and celebrating the Sandinista victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perez|first=Gina M.|title=Beyond El Barrio|year=2010|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8147-9129-5|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the decade that the Sandinistas controlled Nicaragua, “close to three hundred murals were created” by muralists who traveled to Nicaragua from the Bay Area to bring the solidarity movement back to the homeland, showing an American support from the barrio of the Mission District to the barrios in Nicaragua.

== Recognition ==

Although the murals exist in the Mission District and in Nicaragua, more notable movements like the United States’ government support for the Contra War, the effort to establish a counter military movement to combat and overthrow the Sandinista government, suppress the artistic movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perez|first=Gina M.|title=Beyond El Barrio|year=2010|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8147-9129-5|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mission Muralismo and its influence on the Nicaraguan solidarity struggle is imperative to understand how the politics and atmosphere of political turbulence affected the barrios in Nicaragua and the barrios created in the United States as a result of the conflict. The murals serve as a voice for the barrio, one of the many tools used to make concerns vocal and visible to their communities in Nicaragua and in their new American home.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12599">{{distinguish|Refeudalization}}
'''Neo-feudalism''' or '''new feudalism''' refers to a theorized contemporary rebirth of policies of [[governance]], [[economy]], and public life reminiscent of those present in many [[feudalism|feudal]] societies, such as unequal rights and legal protections for common people and for nobility.&lt;ref name=Huggins /&gt;

The concept of "neofeudalism" may focus on economics. Among the issues claimed to be associated with the idea of neofeudalism in contemporary society are [[class stratification]], [[globalization]], mass immigration/illegal immigration, [[open border]]s policies, [[multinational corporation]]s, and "[[corporatism|neo-corporatism]]".&lt;ref&gt;'''Thom Hartmann''', "[http://www.commondreams.org/views/2002/11/06/time-remove-bananas-and-return-our-republic-democracy Time to Remove the Bananas...and Return Our Republic to Democracy]", ''CommonDreams.org'', 6 November 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use and etymology==
In early use, the term was deployed as both a criticism of the political Left and of the Right.

An early example critical of the Left the essay 'Neo-Feudalism' by [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] published in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Reisman]] ''Human Events'', February 1961 [http://www.mises.org/web/2793]&lt;/ref&gt; The term is still used by some on the right in that sense in the twenty-first century:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although he would later become a naturalized American citizen, Soros remains in social outlook very much a European and believer in the paternalistic neo-feudalism euphemistically called "[[democratic socialism]]" or "[[social democracy]]."&lt;ref&gt;Lowell Ponte, "[http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=15491 George Soros: Billionaire for the Left] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824094507/http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=15491 |date=2017-08-24 }}" ''Front Page Magazine'', November 13, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, [[Jürgen Habermas]] used the term ''Refeudalisierung'' ('[[refeudalisation]]') in his 1962 ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere]]'' to criticise the privatisation of the forms of communication that he believed had produced an [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]-era [[public sphere]]. While not talking about 'neo-feudalism' as such, later commentators have noted that these ideas are similar to the idea of neo-feudalism.&lt;ref&gt;Sighard Neckel, ‘[http://www.mpifg.de/pu/workpap/wp10-6.pdf Refeudalisierung der Ökonomie: Zum Strukturwandel kapitalistischer Wirtschaft]’, MPIfG Working Paper 10/6 (Cologne: Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies, July 2010), pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondingly, in 1992 [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] expressed views on global development, listing neo-feudalism among three other variants. By ''neo-feudalism'', Wallerstein referred to [[autarky]] regions with a localised hierarchy and hi-tech goods available only for elite.&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein I. Capitalist civilization. -Binghampton (N.Y.), 1992. &lt;br/&gt; {{cite journal |author= Malinovsky P. V. |year= 2001|title= Globalisation as a Civilization Shaping Process|url= http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=9952491|journal=Russia and the modern world (Россия и современный мир)|publisher=ИНИОН РАН|volume= |issue= 2 |pages= 7 (5–30) |issn=1726-5223 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Privatized governance==
According to Les Johnston, Clifford Shearing's theoretical approach of neofeudalism has been influential.&lt;ref name=Johnston1999&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnston |first1=Les |year=1999 |doi=10.1023/A:1008753326991 |title=Private Policing in Context |journal=European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=175–196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shearing "use[s] this term in a limited sense to draw attention to the emergence of domains of mass private property that are ‘gated’ in a variety of ways".&lt;ref name=Shearing2001&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shearing |first1=Clifford |year=2001 |title=Punishment and the Changing Face of the Governance |journal= Punishment &amp; Society |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages= 203–220 |doi= 10.1177/1462474501003002001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shearing1983&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shearing |first1=Clifford D. |year=1983 |title=Private Security: Implications for Social Control |journal=[[Social Problems]] |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=493–506 |url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=89492 |issn=0037-7791 |doi=10.1525/sp.1983.30.5.03a00020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucia Zedner responds that this use of neo-feudalism is ''too'' limited in scope; Shearing's comparison does not draw parallels with earlier governance explicitly enough. Zedner prefers more definitive endorsements.&lt;ref name=Zedner2006&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zedner |first1=Lucia |authorlink=Lucia Zedner |year=2006 |title=Policing Before and After the Police: The Historical Antecedents of Contemporary Crime Control |doi=10.1093/bjc/azi043 |journal=The British Journal of Criminology |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=78–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neofeudalism entails an order defined by commercial interests and administered in large areas, according to Bruce Baker, who argues that this does not fully describe the extent of cooperation between state and non-state policing.&lt;ref name=Baker2004&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baker |first1=Bruce |year=2004 |title=Protection from crime: what is on offer for Africans? |journal=Journal of Contemporary African Studies |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=165–188 |doi=10.1080/cjca0258900042000230005 |url=http://www.ssrnetwork.net/uploaded_files/3606.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317005318/http://www.ssrnetwork.net/uploaded_files/3606.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of the comparison to feudalism, for Randy Lippert and Daniel O'Connor, is that corporations have power similar to states' governance powers.&lt;ref name=Lippert2006&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lippert |first1=Randy |authorlink1=Randy K.

The widening of the wealth gap, as poor and marginalized people are excluded from the state's provision of security, can result in neofeudalism, argues Marina Caparini, who says this has already happened in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name=Caparini2006&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Caparini |first=Marina |editor-first=Alan |editor-last=Bryden |editor2-first=Marina |editor2-last=Caparini |encyclopedia=Private Actors and Security Governance |title=Applying a Security Governance Perspective to the Privatisation of Security |url=http://kms1.isn.ethz.ch/serviceengine/Files/ISN/96894/ichaptersection_singledocument/D52C839B-6A34-48DD-98E1-BE33926FCE17/en/chapter14.pdf |year=2006 |publisher=LIT Verlag |isbn=3-8258-9840-7 |pages=263–282 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319221311/http://kms1.isn.ethz.ch/serviceengine/Files/ISN/96894/ichaptersection_singledocument/D52C839B-6A34-48DD-98E1-BE33926FCE17/en/chapter14.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neofeudalism is made possible by the [[commodification]] of policing, and signifies the end of shared citizenship, says Ian Loader.&lt;ref name=Loader1999&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Loader |first1=Ian |year=1999 |doi=10.1177/S003803859900022X |title=Consumer Culture and the Commodification of Policing and Security |journal=Sociology |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=373–392}}&lt;/ref&gt; A primary characteristic of neofeudalism is that individuals' public lives are increasingly governed by business corporations, as Martha K.

[[File:Wood block pavement South Camac Street - details.jpg|thumb|Wood block pavement]]

'''Nicolson pavement''', alternatively spelled "'''Nicholson'''" and denominated '''wooden block pavement''' and '''wood block pavement''', is a road surface material consisting of wooden blocks. Samuel Nicolson invented it in the mid 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Nicolson pavement, invented by Samuel Nicolson, of Boston, Mass. | url = http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=moa;idno=AJR3196.0001.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wooden block pavement has since become unfavored because of its poor surface quality and high cost of maintenance.

Wood block pavement may have originated in Russia in the 14th century, but it gained prominence in the 1820s and 1830s as a road building alternative to the irregularly surfaced cobblestone streets common during that era.&lt;ref name="manhattanpast1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Manhattan’s First Experiments with Wooden Streets|url=http://www.manhattanpast.com/2012/manhattans-first-experiments-with-wooden-streets/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood block was also favored because stone was scarce and wood was abundant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Wood Block Alleys  | url = http://forgottenchicago.com/articles/wood-block-alleys/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, horse traffic reportedly made less noise on wood-surfaced streets.&lt;ref name="post-gazette2004"&gt;{{cite web| title = Shadyside's wooden street paves its way to greatness | url = http://www.post-gazette.com/life/lifestyle/2004/03/21/Shadyside-s-wooden-street-paves-its-way-to-greatness/stories/200403210204}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the drawbacks of Nicolson pavement include slippery surfaces when wet or icy,&lt;ref name="post-gazette2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pghcitypaper1"&gt;{{cite web| title = I was told that there was a wooden street located in Shadyside or Squirrel Hill.

 |quote  = M. Gourieff introduced [to St. Petersburg] the hexagonal wooden pavement with which, in London, we are all acquainted. This, with continuous reparation, answers pretty well, taking into consideration that equality of surface seems utterly unattainable, that the knavish contractors supply blocks so rotten as to be worthless a few days after they are put down, and that the horses are continually slipping and frequently falling on the perilous highway. It is unpleasant, also, to be semi-asphyxiated each time you take your walks abroad, by the fumes of the infernal pitch-cauldrons, round which the moujik workmen gather, like witches.

Nicolson pavement was the focus of a Supreme Court case, [[City of Elizabeth v. American Nicholson Pavement Co.]] which held that while the public use of an [[invention]] more than one year prior to the inventor's application for a [[patent]] normally causes the inventor to lose his right to a patent, there is an exception to this rule for public uses for experimental purposes.

The project has led to the construction of an [[apartment]] which is only 25 square meters (270 square feet) in area. The single-room living space has the [[furniture]] built into the floor and the room can be changed from a [[living room]] to a [[bedroom]], to a [[dining room]], and back. The [[kitchen]] area is affixed to the wall and does not change. {{fact|date=March 2011}}

'''p-nuclei''' (''p'' stands for [[proton]]-rich) are certain proton-rich, naturally occurring [[isotope]]s of some [[Chemical element|elements]] between [[selenium]] and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] inclusive which cannot be produced in either the [[S-process|s-]] or the [[r-process]].

Cameron]]: ''Nuclear Reactions in Stars and Nucleogenesis.'' In: ''Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific'', Vol. 69, 1957, p. 201-222. ([http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-data_query?bibcode=1957PASP...69..201C&amp;link_type=ARTICLE&amp;db_key=AST online])&lt;/ref&gt; showed how the majority of naturally occurring [[nuclide]]s beyond the element [[iron]] can be made in two kinds of [[neutron capture]] processes, the s- and the r-process. Some proton-rich nuclides found in nature are not reached in these processes and therefore at least one additional process is required to synthesize them. These [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] are called '''p-nuclei'''.

Since the definition of the p-nuclei depends on the current knowledge of the s- and r-process (see also [[nucleosynthesis]]), the original list of 35 p-nuclei may be modified over the years, as indicated in the Table below.
For example, it is recognized today that the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|abundances]] of &lt;sup&gt;152&lt;/sup&gt;Gd and &lt;sup&gt;164&lt;/sup&gt;Er contain at least strong contributions from the [[s-process]].&lt;ref name="s-contrib"&gt;C. Arlandini, F. Käppeler, K. Wisshak, R. Gallino, M. Lugaro, M. Busso, O. Straniero: ''Neutron Capture in Low-Mass Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars: Cross Sections and Abundance Signatures.'' In: ''The Astrophysical Journal'', Vol. 525, 1999, p. 886-900. ( {{doi|10.1086/307938}})&lt;/ref&gt; This also seems to apply to those of &lt;sup&gt;113&lt;/sup&gt;In and &lt;sup&gt;115&lt;/sup&gt;Sn, which additionally could be made in the [[r-process]] in small amounts.&lt;ref name="r-contrib"&gt;Zs. Nemeth, F. Käppeler, C. Theis, T. Belgya, S. W. Yates: ''Nucleosynthesis in the Cd-In-Sn region.'' In: ''The Astrophysical Journal'', Vol. 426, 1994, p. 357-365. ( {{doi|10.1086/174071}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Half-life|long-lived]] [[radionuclide]]s &lt;sup&gt;92&lt;/sup&gt;Nb, &lt;sup&gt;97&lt;/sup&gt;Tc, &lt;sup&gt;98&lt;/sup&gt;Tc and &lt;sup&gt;146&lt;/sup&gt;Sm are not among the classically defined p-nuclei as they no longer occur naturally on Earth. By the above definition, however, they are also p-nuclei because they cannot be made in either the s- or the r-process. From the discovery of their [[decay product]]s in [[presolar grains]] it can be inferred that at least &lt;sup&gt;92&lt;/sup&gt;Nb and &lt;sup&gt;146&lt;/sup&gt;Sm were present in the [[solar nebula]]. This offers the possibility to estimate the time since the last production of these p-nuclei before the formation of the [[solar system]].&lt;ref name="dauphas"&gt;N. Dauphas, T. Rauscher, B. Marty, L. Reisberg: ''Short-lived p-nuclides in the early Solar System and implications on the nucleosynthetic role of X-ray binaries.'' In: ''Nuclear Physics'', Vol. A719, 2003, p. C287-C295 ( {{doi|10.1016/S0375-9474(03)00934-5}}, [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0211452 arXiv.org:astro-ph/0211452])&lt;/ref&gt;

p-nuclei are very rare. Those isotopes of an element which are p-nuclei are less abundant typically by factors of ten to one thousand than the other isotopes of the same element. The abundances of p-nuclei can only be determined in [[Geochemistry|geochemical]] investigations and by analysis of [[meteorite|meteoritic]] material and [[presolar grains]]. They cannot be identified in [[Astronomical spectroscopy|stellar spectra]]. Therefore, the knowledge of p-abundances is restricted to those of the Solar System and it is unknown whether the solar abundances of p-nuclei are typical for the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref name="arnould"&gt;M. Arnould, S. Goriely: ''The p-process of stellar nucleosynthesis: astrophysics and nuclear physics status.'' In: ''Physics Reports'' 384, 2003, p. 1-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of the p-nuclei ==

The [[Astrophysics|astrophysical]] production of p-nuclei is not completely understood yet. The favored ''γ-process'' (see below) in [[Type II supernova|core-collapse supernovae]] cannot produce
all p-nuclei in sufficient amounts, according to current [[computer simulation]]s. This is why additional production mechanisms and astrophysical sites are under investigation, as outlined below. It is also conceivable that there is not just a single process responsible for all p-nuclei but that different processes in a number of astrophysical sites produce certain ranges of p-nuclei.&lt;ref name="posnic2010"&gt;T. Rauscher: ''Origin of p-Nuclei in Explosive Nucleosynthesis.'' In: ''Proceedings of Science'' [http://pos.sissa.it/archive/conferences/100/059/NIC XI_059.pdf PoS(NIC XI)059]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 2010 ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.2213 arXiv.org:1012.2213])&lt;/ref&gt;

In the search for the relevant processes creating p-nuclei, the usual way is to identify the possible production mechanisms (processes) and then to investigate their possible realization in various astrophysical sites. The same logic is applied in the discussion below.

=== Basics of p-nuclide production ===

In principle, there are two ways to produce proton-rich [[nuclide]]s: by successively adding [[proton]]s to a nuclide (these are [[nuclear reaction]]s of type (p,γ) or by removing neutrons from a nucleus through sequences of [[photodisintegration]]s of type (γ,n).&lt;ref name="arnould" /&gt;&lt;ref name="posnic2010" /&gt;

Under conditions encountered in astrophysical environments it is difficult to obtain p-nuclei through proton captures because the [[Coulomb barrier]] of a nucleus increases with increasing [[proton number]]. A proton requires more energy to be incorporated (''captured'') into an atomic nucleus when the Coulomb barrier is higher. The available average energy of the protons is determined by the [[temperature]] of the stellar [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. Increasing the temperature, however, also speeds up the (γ,p) photodisintegrations which counteract the (p,γ) captures. The only alternative avoiding this would be to have a very large number of protons available so that the effective number of captures per second is large even at low temperature. In extreme cases (as discussed below) this leads to the synthesis of extremely short-lived [[radionuclide]]s which [[Radioactive decay|decay]] to stable nuclides only after the captures cease.&lt;ref name="arnould" /&gt;&lt;ref name="posnic2010" /&gt;

Appropriate combinations of temperature and proton density of a stellar plasma have to be explored in the search of possible production mechanisms for p-nuclei. Further [[parameter]]s are the time available for the nuclear processes, and number and type of initially present nuclides (''seed nuclei'').

=== Possible processes ===

==== The p-process ====
{{Main article|P-process}}
In a p-process it is suggested that p-nuclei were made through a few proton captures on stable nuclides. The seed nuclei originate from the s- and r-process and are already present in the stellar plasma. As outlined above, there are serious difficulties explaining all p-nuclei through such a process although it was originally suggested to achieve exactly this.&lt;ref name="b2fh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cameron" /&gt;&lt;ref name="arnould" /&gt; It was shown later that the required conditions are not reached in [[star]]s or stellar explosions.&lt;ref name="truran"&gt;J. Audouze, J. W. Truran: ''P-process nucleosynthesis in postshock supernova envelope environments.'' In: ''The Astrophysical Journal'', Vol. 202, 1975, p. 204-213. ( {{doi|10.1086/153965}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on its historical meaning, the term ''p-process'' is sometimes sloppily used for any process synthesizing p-nuclei, even when no proton captures are involved.

==== The γ-process ====
p-Nuclei can also be obtained by [[photodisintegration]] of s- and r-process nuclei. At temperatures around 2–3&amp;nbsp;[[giga]][[kelvin]]s (GK) and short process time of a few seconds (this requires an explosive process) photodisintegration of the pre-existing nuclei will remain small, just enough to produce the required tiny abundances of p-nuclei.&lt;ref name="arnould" /&gt;&lt;ref name="woosley"&gt;S. E. Woosley, W. M. Howard: ''The p-process in supernovae.'' In: The Astrophysical Journal Supplement, Vol. 36, 1978, p. 285–304. ({{doi|10.1086/190501}})&lt;/ref&gt; This is called '''γ-process''' because the photodisintegration proceeds by [[nuclear reaction]]s of the types (γ,n), (γ,α) and (γ,p), which are caused by highly energetic [[photon]]s ([[Gamma ray]]s).&lt;ref name="woosley" /&gt;

==== The ν-Process ====
If a sufficiently intensive source of neutrinos is available, [[nuclear reaction]]s can directly produce certain nuclides, for example &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li, &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B, &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F, &lt;sup&gt;138&lt;/sup&gt;La in [[Type II supernova|core-collapse supernovae]].&lt;ref name="nu-process"&gt;S. E. Woosley, D. H. Hartmann, R. D. Hoffman, W. C. Haxton: ''The &amp;nu;-process.'' In: ''The Astrophysical Journal'', Vol. 356, 1990, p. 272-301. ( {{doi|10.1086/168839}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rapid proton capture processes ====

In a p-process protons are added to stable or weakly [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[atomic nuclei]]. 
If there is a high proton density in the stellar plasma, even short-lived [[radionuclides]] can capture one or more protons before they [[beta decay]]. This quickly moves the [[nucleosynthesis]] path from the region of stable nuclei to the very proton-rich side of the [[Chart of Nuclides]]. This is called ''rapid proton-capture''.&lt;ref name="posnic2010" /&gt;

Here, a series of (p,γ) reactions proceeds until either the [[beta decay]] of a nucleus is faster than a further proton capture, or the [[proton drip line]] is reached. Both cases lead to one or several sequential beta decays until a nucleus is produced which again can capture protons before it beta decays. Then the proton capture sequences continue.

It is possible to cover the region of the lightest nuclei up to &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Ni within a second because both proton captures and beta decays are fast. Starting with &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Ni, however, a number of ''waiting points'' are encountered in the reaction path. These are nuclides which both have relatively long [[half-life|half-lives]] (compared to the process timescale) and can only slowly add another proton (that is, their [[Cross section (physics)|cross section]] for (p,γ) reactions is small). Examples for such waiting points are: &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Ni, &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Zn, &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Ge, &lt;sup&gt;68&lt;/sup&gt;Se. Further waiting points may be important, depending on the detailed conditions and location of the reaction path. It is typical for such waiting points to show half-lives of minutes to days. Thus, they considerably increase the time required to continue the reaction sequences. If the conditions required for this rapid proton capture are only present for a short time (the timescale of explosive astrophysical events is of the order of seconds), the waiting points limit or hamper the continuation of the reactions to heavier nuclei.&lt;ref name="schatz"&gt;H. Schatz, et al.: ''rp-Process Nucleosynthesis at Extreme Temperature and Density Conditions.'' In: ''Physics Reports'', Vol. 294, 1998, p. 167-263. ( {{doi|10.1016/S0370-1573(97)00048-3}})&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to produce p-nuclei, the process path has to encompass nuclides bearing the same [[mass number]] (but usually containing more protons) as the desired p-nuclei. These nuclides are then converted into p-nuclei through sequences of beta decays after the rapid proton captures ceased.

Variations of the main category ''rapid proton captures'' are the rp-, pn-, and νp-processes, which will be briefly outlined below.

===== The rp-process =====
{{Main article|Rp-process}}
The so-called '''rp-process''' (''rp'' is for ''rapid proton capture'') is the purest form of the rapid proton capture process described above. At proton densities of more than {{val|e=28}} protons/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and temperatures around 2 GK the reaction path is close to the [[proton drip line]].&lt;ref name="schatz" /&gt; The waiting points can be bridged provided that the process time is 10-600 s. Waiting-point nuclides are produced with larger abundances while the production of nuclei "behind" each waiting-point is more and more suppressed.

A definitive endpoint is reached close to &lt;sup&gt;107&lt;/sup&gt;Te because the reaction path runs into a region of nuclides which decay preferably by [[alpha decay]] and thus loop the path back onto itself.&lt;ref name="rp-end"&gt;H. Schatz, et al.: ''End Point of the rp Process on Accreting Neutron Stars.'' In: ''Physical Review Letters'', Vol. 86, 2001, p. 3471-3474. ([https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.86.3471 ] {{doi|10.1016/10.1103/PhysRevLett.86.3471}})&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, an rp-process would only be able to produce p-nuclei with [[mass number]]s less than or equal to 107.

===== The pn-process =====
The waiting points in rapid proton capture processes can be avoided by (n,p) reactions which are much faster than proton captures on or beta decays of waiting points nuclei. This results in a considerable reduction of the time required to build heavy elements and allows an efficient production within seconds.&lt;ref name="arnould" /&gt; This requires, however, a (small) supply of free [[neutron]]s which are usually not present in such proton-rich plasmas. One way to obtain them is to release them through other reactions occurring simultaneously as the rapid proton captures. This is called ''neutron-rich rapid proton capture'' or '''pn-process'''.&lt;ref name="pn-proc"&gt;S. Goriely, J. José, M. Hernanz, M. Rayet, M. Arnould: ''He-detonation in sub-Chandrasekhar CO white dwarfs: A new insight into energetics and p-process nucleosynthesis.'' In: ''Astronomy and Astrophysics'', Vol. 383, 2002, p. L27-L30. ( {{doi|10.1051/0004-6361:20020088}})&lt;/ref&gt;

===== The &amp;nu;p-process =====
Another possibility to obtain the neutrons required for the accelerating (n,p) reactions in proton-rich environments is to use the anti-neutrino capture on protons ({{nowrap|{{SubatomicParticle|Electron antineutrino}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Proton}} → {{SubatomicParticle|Positron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Neutron}}}}), turning a proton and an anti-neutrino into a [[positron]] and a neutron. Since (anti-)neutrinos interact only very weakly with protons, a high [[flux]] of anti-neutrinos has to act on a plasma with high proton density. This is called '''νp-process'''.&lt;ref name="nup-process"&gt;C. Fröhlich, G. Martínez-Pinedo, M. Liebendörfer, F.-K. Thielemann, E. Bravo, W. R. Hix, K. Langanke, N. T. Zinner: ''Neutrino-Induced Nucleosynthesis of A&amp;gt;64 Nuclei: The &amp;nu;p Process.'' In: ''Physical Review Letters'', Vol. 96, 2006, article 142502. ( {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.142502}})&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Possible synthesis sites ===

==== Core-collapse supernovae ====
Massive [[star]]s end their life in a [[Type II supernova|core-collapse supernova]]. In such a supernova, a shockfront from an explosion runs from the center of the star through its outer layers and ejects these. When the shockfront reaches the O/Ne-shell of the star (see also [[stellar evolution]]), the conditions for a γ-process are reached for 1-2 s.

Although the majority of p-nuclei can be made in this way, some [[mass number|mass]] regions of p-nuclei turn out to be problematic in model calculations. It has been known already for decades that p-nuclei with mass numbers {{nowrap|A &amp;lt; 100}} cannot be produced in a γ-process.&lt;ref name="arnould" /&gt;&lt;ref name="woosley" /&gt; Modern simulations also show problems in the range {{nowrap|150 ≤ A ≤ 165}}.&lt;ref name="posnic2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rhhw"&gt;T. Rauscher, A. Heger, R. D. Hoffman, S. E. Woosley: ''Nucleosynthesis in Massive Stars with Improved Nuclear and Stellar Physics.'' In: ''The Astrophysical Journal'', Vol. 576, 2002, p. 323-348. ( {{doi|10.1086/341728}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The p-nucleus &lt;sup&gt;138&lt;/sup&gt;La is not produced in the γ-process but it can be made in a ν-process. A hot [[neutron star]] is made in the center of such a core-collapse supernova and it radiates neutrinos with high intensity. The neutrinos interact also with the outer layers of the exploding star and cause nuclear reactions which create &lt;sup&gt;138&lt;/sup&gt;La, among other nuclei.&lt;ref name="nu-process" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rhhw" /&gt; Also &lt;sup&gt;180m&lt;/sup&gt;Ta may receive a contribution from this ν-process.

It was suggested&lt;ref name="nup-process" /&gt; to supplement the γ-process in the outer layers of the star by another process, occurring in the deepest layers of the star, close to the neutron star but still being ejected instead of falling onto the neutron star surface. Due to the initially high flow of neutrinos from the forming neutron star, these layers become extremely proton-rich through the reaction {{nowrap|{{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Neutron}} → {{SubatomicParticle|Electron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Proton}}}}. Although the anti-neutrino flux is initially weaker a few neutrons will be created, nevertheless, because of the large number of protons. This allows a ''&amp;nu;p-process'' in these deep layers. Because of the short timescale of the explosion and the high [[Coulomb barrier]] of the heavier nuclei, such a νp-process could possibly only produce the lightest p-nuclei. Which nuclei are made and how much of them depends sensitively on many details in the simulations and also on the actual explosion mechanism of a core-collapse supernova, which still is not completely understood.&lt;ref name="nup-process" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nup-process2"&gt;C. Fröhlich, et al.: ''Composition of the Innermost Core-Collapse Supernova Ejecta.'' In: ''The Astrophysical Journal'', Vol. 637, 2006, p. 415-426. ( {{doi|10.1086/498224}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Thermonuclear supernovae ====

A [[thermonuclear supernova]] is the explosion of a [[white dwarf]] in a [[binary star]] system, triggered by thermonuclear reactions in matter from a companion star [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accreted]] on the surface of the white dwarf. The accreted matter is rich in [[hydrogen]] (protons) and [[helium]] ([[Alpha particle|&amp;alpha; particles]]) and becomes hot enough to allow [[nuclear reaction]]s.

A number of models for such explosions are discussed in literature, of which two were explored regarding the prospect of producing p-nuclei. None of these explosions release neutrinos, therefore rendering ν- and νp-process impossible. Conditions required for the rp-process are also not attained.

Details of the possible production of p-nuclei in such supernovae depend sensitively on the composition of the matter accreted from the companion star (the ''seed nuclei'' for all subsequent processes). Since this can change considerably from star to star, all statements and models of p-production in thermonuclear supernovae are prone to large uncertainties.&lt;ref name="arnould" /&gt;

===== Type Ia supernovae =====
The consensus model of thermonuclear supernovae postulates that the white dwarf explodes after exceeding the [[Chandrasekhar limit]] by the accretion of matter because the contraction and heating ignites explosive [[carbon burning]] under [[Degenerate matter|degenerate]] conditions. A nuclear burning front runs through the white dwarf from the inside out and tears it apart. Then the outermost layers closely beneath the surface of the white dwarf (containing 0.05 [[solar mass]]es of matter) exhibit the right conditions for a γ-process.&lt;ref name="Ia-gamma"&gt;W. M. Howard, S. B. Meyer, S. E. Woosley: ''A new site for the astrophysical gamma-process.'' In: ''The Astrophysical Journal Letters'', Vol. 373, 1991, p. L5-L8. ( {{doi|10.1086/186038}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The p-nuclei are made in the same way as in the γ-process in core-collapse supernovae and also the same difficulties are encountered. In addition, &lt;sup&gt;138&lt;/sup&gt;La and &lt;sup&gt;180m&lt;/sup&gt;Ta are not produced. A variation of the seed abundances by assuming increased [[s-process]] abundances only scales the abundances of the resulting p-nuclei without curing the problems of relative underproduction in the nuclear mass ranges given above.&lt;ref name="arnould" /&gt;

===== subChandrasekhar supernovae =====
In a subclass of [[type Ia supernova]]e, the so-called '''subChandrasekhar supernova''', the white dwarf may explode long before it reaches the Chandrasekhar limit because nuclear reactions in the accreted matter can already heat the white dwarf during its accretion phase and trigger explosive carbon burning prematurely. Helium-rich accretion favors this type of explosion. [[Helium burning]] ignites degeneratively on the bottom of the accreted helium layer and causes two shockfronts. The one running inwards ignites the carbon explosion. The outwards moving front heats the outer layers of the white dwarf and ejects them. Again, these outer layers are site to a γ-process at temperatures of 2-3 GK. Due to the presence of α particles (helium nuclei), however, additional nuclear reactions become possible. Among those are such which release a large number of neutrons, such as &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O(α,n)&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;Ne, &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;Ne(α,n)&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;Mg, and &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg(α,n)&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;Si. This allows a ''pn-process'' in that part of the outer layers which experiences temperatures above 3 GK.&lt;ref name="arnould" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pn-proc" /&gt;

Those light p-nuclei which are underproduced in the γ-process can be so efficiently made in the pn-process that they even show much larger abundances than the other p-nuclei. To obtain the observed solar relative abundances, a strongly enhanced [[s-process]] seed (by factors of 100-1000 or more) has to be assumed which increases the yield of heavy p-nuclei from the γ-process.&lt;ref name="arnould" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pn-proc" /&gt;

==== Neutron stars in binary star systems ====
{{Main article|Rp-process}}
A [[neutron star]] in a [[binary star]] system can also accrete matter from the companion star on its surface. Combined [[hydrogen burning|hydrogen]] and [[helium burning]] ignites when the accreted layer of [[degenerate matter]] reaches a density of
{{nowrap|{{val|e=5}}–{{val|e=6}} g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} and a temperature exceeding {{val|0.2|u=GK}}. This leads to [[thermonuclear]] burning comparable to what happens in the outwards moving shockfront of subChandrasekhar supernovae. The neutron star itself is not affected by the explosion and therefore the nuclear reactions in the accreted layer can proceed longer than in an explosion. This allows to establish an rp-process. It will continue until either all free protons are used up or the burning layer has expanded due to the increase in temperature and its density falls below the one required for the nuclear reactions.&lt;ref name="schatz" /&gt;

It was shown that the properties of [[X-ray burster|X-ray bursts]] in the [[Milky Way]] can be explained by an rp-process on the surface of accreting neutron stars.&lt;ref name="x-bursts"&gt;S. E. Woosley, et al.: ''Models for Type I X-Ray Bursts with Improved Nuclear Physics.'' In: ''The Astrophysical Journal Supplement'', Vol. 151, 2004, p. 75-102. ( {{doi|10.1086/381553}})&lt;/ref&gt; It remains unclear, yet, whether matter (and if, how much matter) can be ejected and escape the [[gravitational field]] of the neutron star. Only if this is the case can such objects be considered as possible sources of p-nuclei. Even if this is corroborated, the demonstrated endpoint of the rp-process limits the production to the light p-nuclei (which are underproduced in core-collapse supernovae).&lt;ref name="rp-end" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6792">'''Progesterex''' is a fictitious [[date rape drug]] that would purportedly cause [[sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]]. It is part of a [[hoax]] that began to circulate in 1999 via [[e-mail]] on the [[internet]]. No actual drug by this name or even with these properties exists, and no such incident has ever been documented or confirmed.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160308085250/http://tribune.ie/archive/article/2007/apr/29/beaumont-hospital-investigates-fake-email-warning- Beaumont Hospital investigates fake email warning of rape drug&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The most high profile person falling for the hoax was British MP [[Lynne Featherstone]], who asked a question about the fake drug in Parliament.

==Email contents==
Typical contents of the e-mail [[hoax]] are as follows, although different versions tend to turn up over time:
	
{{Blockquote|"A woman at a nightclub called _______ on Saturday night was taken by 5 men, who according to hospital and police reports, gang raped her before dumping her. Unable to remember the events of the evening, tests later confirmed the repeat rapes along with traces of [[Rohypnol]] in her blood and Progesterex, essentially a small sterilization pill. The drug is now being used by rapists at parties to rape AND sterilize their victims. Progesterex is available to vets to sterilize large animals. Progesterex is being used together with Rohypnol, the date rape drug. As with Rohypnol, all they have to do is drop it into the girl's drink. The girl can't remember a thing the next morning, of all that had taken place the night before. Progesterex, which dissolves in drinks just as easily, is such that the victim doesn't conceive from the rape and the rapist needn't worry about having a paternity test identifying him months later. The drug's effects ARE NOT TEMPORARY - Progesterex was designed to sterilize horses. Any female who takes it WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO CONCEIVE. The weasels can get this drug from anyone who is in the vet school or any university. It's that easy, and Progesterex is about to break out big on campuses everywhere. Believe it or not, there are even sites on the Internet telling people how to use it. Please forward this to everyone you know, especially girls. Be careful when you're out and don't leave your drink unattended. Please make the effort to forward this on to all you know. Guys, please inform all your female friends and relatives."}}

==Debunking==
There is no "sterilization pill" under any name that exists for sterilizing horses. Sterilization of male horses is performed surgically, while mares are usually left unaltered

==Notable examples==
A version of this e-mail was translated and sent around in Brazil in 2008–2009.

A version of this hoax also made the rounds via bulletins on [[MySpace]], [[Bebo]], [[Facebook]], and [[Tagged]] and in the form of a group named "Heads Up Ladies".

According to the Spanish language website VSAntirus.com at least two versions in Spanish have made the rounds since 2001 as well.

A Swedish and later Norwegian version circulated 2008–2009 with a signature of Birgitta Olofsson, Dr Med in nursing science of Umeå University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/myt-om-valdtaktsdrog-pa-ny-turne-1.684112 Myt om våldtäktsdrog på ny turné - DN.se&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==UK Parliament incident==
On 18 April 2006 [[UK]] [[Member of Parliament]] [[Lynne Featherstone]] submitted a Written Question to the [[Home Secretary]] on whether the Home Office had calculated the number of [[date rape]] incidences that had been connected with Progesterex.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1282573/In-bath-thinking---Minister-warned-1am-tweets.html ¿In the bath thinking...¿: Minister warned over 1am tweets | Mail Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Home Office Minister [[Paul Goggins]] replied that "Progesterex does not exist".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2006-04-18c.63360.h&amp;s=Progesterex#g63360.q0 Date Rape: 18 Apr 2006: Written answers and statements (TheyWorkForYou.com)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lynnefeatherstone.org/2006/05/progesterex.htm Delivery, canvassing, stuffing… | Lynne Featherstone&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827180051/http://www.lynnefeatherstone.org/2006/05/progesterex.htm |date=2008-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Featherstone criticised the government stating they "need to do more to discover the unearthly monster who sends them out" and that "their cavalier attitude will not do."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2006/05/02/exclusive-email-on-date-drug-is-a-hoax-115875-17018651/ Exclusive: Email On Date Drug Is A Hoax - Mirror.Co.Uk&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG7909143/Mad-Men-star-Christina-Hendricks-is-great-role-model-says-Equalities-Minister.html Mad Men star Christina Hendricks is great role model, says Equalities Minister - Telegraph&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics such as fellow Liberal Democrat James Graham castigated Featherstone's conduct in "criticising the Home Office for not having a response to made up drugs and made up crimes", stating "trivialising rape in this way without bothering to do basic research first doesn’t help anybody".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.theliberati.net/quaequamblog/2006/05/02/bombd/ Quaequam Blog! » Cook’d and Bomb’d&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''rave''' (from the [[verb]]: ''[[wikt:rave#English|to rave]]'') is an organised dance party at a [[nightclub]], outdoor festival, warehouse, or other private property typically featuring performances by [[Disc jockeys|DJ]]s, playing a seamless flow of [[electronic dance music]]. DJs at rave events play electronic dance music on vinyl, CDs and digital audio from a wide range of genres, including [[techno]],&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/02/how-rave-music-conquered-america&lt;/ref&gt; [[hardcore (electronic dance music genre)|hardcore]], [[house music|house]],&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; [[drum &amp; bass]],&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2273707/Mother-41-takes-month-old-baby-drum-bass-rave-Wales.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dummymag.com/lists/the-10-best-drum-and-bass-tracks-according-to-goldie&lt;/ref&gt; [[dubstep]],&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; and [[post-industrial music|post-industrial]]. Occasionally [[Live music|live]] performers have been known to perform, in addition to other types of performance artists such as [[go-go dancers]] and [[Fire performance|fire dancers]]. The music is amplified with a large, powerful [[sound reinforcement system]], typically with large [[subwoofer]]s to produce a deep bass sound. The music is often accompanied by [[Laser lighting display|laser light shows]], [[Image projector|projected coloured images]], [[visual effects]] and [[fog machines]].

While some raves may be small parties held at nightclubs or private homes, some raves have grown to immense size, such as the large festivals and events featuring multiple DJs and dance areas (e.g., the [[Castlemorton Common Festival]] in 1992). Some [[list of electronic music festivals|electronic dance music festivals]] have features of raves, but on a larger, often commercial scale. Raves may last for a long time, with some events continuing for twenty-four hours, and lasting all through the night. [[Law enforcement]] raids and anti-rave laws have presented a challenge to the rave scene in many countries.  This is due to the association of illegal drugs such as [[MDMA]]&lt;ref name="drugabuse"&gt;https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/club-drugs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nih"&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4458153/&lt;/ref&gt; (often referred to as a "[[club drug]]" or "party drug" along with [[3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine|MDA]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thejournal.ie/scott-weiland-drugs-death-2511702-Dec2015/&lt;/ref&gt;), [[LSD]],&lt;ref name="drugabuse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt; [[gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]],&lt;ref name="drugabuse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt; [[ketamine]],&lt;ref name="drugabuse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://qz.com/681175/ketamine-better-known-as-the-rave-drug-special-k-could-be-our-next-anti-depressant/&lt;/ref&gt; [[methamphetamine]],&lt;ref name="drugabuse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt; [[cocaine]],&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt; and [[cannabis]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ministryofcannabisblog.com/2018/02/06/marijuana-in-the-rave-culture-of-the-90s/&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to drugs, raves often make use of non-authorized, secret venues, such as [[squat parties]] at unoccupied homes,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.propertyguardianprotection.com/blog/rave-squat-party-revival&lt;/ref&gt; unused warehouses,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/16/illegal-raves-return-with-social-media-messages&lt;/ref&gt; or aircraft hangars.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/66df895b-af1c-416f-b32a-bb3576dbcb82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-ravers-return-how-underground-parties-are-making-a-comeback-a7036131.html&lt;/ref&gt; These concerns are often attributed to a type of [[moral panic]] surrounding rave culture.

==History==

===Origin of 'rave' (1950s–1970s)===
In the late 1950s in [[London]], England the term "rave" was used to describe the "wild [[bohemian]] parties" of the [[Soho]] [[beatnik]] set.&lt;ref name="outofsight"&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://hehe.org.free.fr/hehe/texte/rave/#hist
| title = OUT OF SIGHT, OUT OF MIND: An Analysis of Rave culture
| accessdate =25 October 2007 | author=Helen Evans
| quote = The term rave first came into use in late 50s Britain as a name for the wild bohemian parties of the time.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jazz musician [[Mick Mulligan]], known for indulging in such excesses, had the nickname "king of the ravers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jan/04/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1|title=Obituary: Mick Mulligan|last=Fordham|first=John|date=2007-01-04|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, [[Buddy Holly]] recorded the hit "Rave On," citing the madness and frenzy of a feeling and the desire for it never to end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wordroutes/1687/|title=Buddy Holly, Wordsmith|author=Thinkmap, Inc.|work=visualthesaurus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "rave" was later used in the burgeoning [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] youth culture of the early 1960s as the way to describe any wild party in general.  People who were gregarious party animals were described as "ravers". Pop musicians such as [[Steve Marriott]] of [[The Small Faces]] and [[Keith Moon]] of [[The Who]] were self-described "ravers".{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}
[[File:Mur Ultim Atom&amp;Biobanas.jpg|thumb|240px|A huge bank of speakers and [[subwoofer]]s from a rave [[sound reinforcement system]].]]

Presaging the word's subsequent 1980s association with [[electronic music]], the word "rave" was a common term used regarding the music of mid-1960s [[garage rock]] and [[psychedelia]] bands (most notably [[The Yardbirds]], who released an album in the US called ''[[Having a Rave Up]]''). Along with being an alternative term for partying at such garage events in general, the "rave-up" referred to a specific crescendo moment near the end of a song where the music was played faster, more heavily and with intense soloing or elements of controlled feedback. It was later part of the title of an [[electronic music]] performance event held on 28 January 1967 at London's [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]] titled the "Million Volt Light and Sound Rave". The event featured the only known public airing of an experimental sound collage created for the occasion by [[Paul McCartney]] of [[The Beatles]] – the legendary ''[[Carnival of Light]]'' recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.delia-derbyshire.org/unitdeltaplus.php
| title = Unit Delta Plus
| accessdate =25 October 2007
| publisher=Delia Derbyshire
| quote = Perhaps the most famous event that Unit Delta Plus participated in was the 1967 ''Million Volt Light and Sound Rave'' at London's Roundhouse, organised by designers Binder, Edwards and Vaughan (who had previously been hired by Paul McCartney to decorate a piano). The event took place over two nights (28 January and 4 February 1967) and included a performance of tape music by Unit Delta Plus, as well as a playback of the legendary ''Carnival of Light'', a fourteen-minute sound collage assembled by McCartney around the time of the Beatles' ''Penny Lane'' sessions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rapid change of British pop culture from the mod era of 1963–1966 to the [[hippie]] era of 1967 and beyond, the term fell out of popular usage. During the 1970s and early 1980s until its resurrection, the term was not in vogue, one notable exception being in the lyrics of the song "[[Drive-In Saturday]]" by [[David Bowie]] (from his 1973 album ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'') which includes the line, "It's a crash course for the ravers." Its use during that era would have been perceived as a quaint or ironic use of bygone slang: part of the dated 1960s lexicon along with words such as "groovy".

The perception of the word "rave" changed again in the late 1980s when the term was revived and adopted by a new youth culture, possibly inspired by the use of the term in Jamaica.&lt;ref name="outofsight"/&gt;

===Birth of acid house (1980s)===
[[File:Rave - Juiz de Fora - MG.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Rave – Juiz de Fora – MG, featuring bright psychedelic theming common at many raves.]]

In the mid to late 1980s, a wave of psychedelic and other [[electronic dance music]], most notably [[acid house]] music, emerged from [[acid house music party|acid house music parties]] in the mid-to-late 1980s in the [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] area in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://music.hyperreal.org/library/history_of_house.html |title = The History Of House |accessdate = August 13, 2013 | author = Phil Cheeseman-fu |publisher = ''[[DJ Magazine]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Chicago acid house artists began experiencing overseas success, acid house quickly spread and caught on in the [[United Kingdom]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fantazia.org.uk/Scene/themusic.htm|title=Acid House Music – The Timeline (The History of House – "Garage, Techno, Jungle.

In the late 1980s, the word "rave" was adopted to describe the [[subculture]] that grew out of the acid house movement.&lt;ref name="Simon Parkin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperreal.org/raves/database/visuale/ve1.htm|title=Visual Energy|author=Simon Parkin|date=May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activities were related to the party atmosphere of [[Ibiza]], a Mediterranean island in Spain, frequented by British, Italian, Greek, Irish and German youth on vacation, who would hold raves and dance parties.&lt;ref name="pop"&gt;"The Problem of Rave Parties", Michael S. Scott, Center for Problem Oriented Policing, 2009, webpage: [http://www.popcenter.org/problems/rave_parties/ popc-rave].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth of the scene (1990s–present)===
[[File:MTAC Prime Rave dance.ogv|thumb|right|200px|dancing at a rave in 2007]]
{{see also|List of electronic dance music festivals|Doof}}
By the 1990s, genres such as [[Acid house|acid]], [[breakbeat hardcore]], [[hardcore (electronic dance music)|hardcore]], [[happy hardcore]], [[gabber]], [[post-industrial music|post-industrial]] and [[electronica]] were all being featured at raves, both large and small. There were mainstream events which attracted thousands of people (up to 25,000{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}&lt;!-- Previously cited with a ref named "Energy Flash" if anyone knows what happened to that. --&gt; instead of the 4,000 that came to earlier warehouse parties). Acid house music parties were first re-branded "rave parties" in the media, during the summer of 1989 by [[Genesis P-Orridge]] (Neil Andrew Megson) during a television interview; however, the ambience of the rave was not fully formed until the early 1990s. In 1990, raves were held "underground" in several cities, such as [[Berlin]], [[Milan]] and [[Patras]], in basements, warehouses and forests.&lt;ref name="Generation Ecstasy"&gt;Timeline and numbers {{cite book

British politicians responded with hostility to the emerging rave party trend. Politicians spoke out against raves and began to [[fine (penalty)|fine]] promoters who held unauthorized parties. Police crackdowns on these often unauthorized parties drove the rave scene into the countryside. The word "rave" somehow caught on in the UK to describe common semi-spontaneous weekend parties occurring at various locations linked by the brand new [[M25 motorway|M25 London orbital]] motorway that ringed London and the [[Home Counties]]. (It was this that gave the band [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]] their name.) These ranged from former warehouses and industrial sites in London, to fields and country clubs in the countryside.

[[File:OZORA Festival.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Rave in Hungary in 2010, showing the fantastical thematic elements at such events.]]
Prior to the commercialization of the rave scene, when large legal venues became the norm for these events, the location of the rave was kept secret until the night of the event, usually being communicated through [[answering machine]] messages,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-39960232|title=The rave that changed the law|last=Chester|first=Jerry|date=2017-05-28|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; mobile messaging, secret flyers, and websites. This level of secrecy, necessary for avoiding any interference by the police, on account of the illicit drug use, enabled the ravers to use locations they could stay in for ten hours at a time.  It promoted the sense of deviance and removal from social control.&lt;ref&gt;Tammy L. Anderson, "Understanding the Alteration and Decline of a Music Scene: Observations from Rave Culture". ''Sociological Forum'', vol.24 no.2 (2009) 309–311. Accessed 10/02/2013 16:19, Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/40210403 .&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 2000s, this level of secrecy still exists in the underground rave scene.  However "after-hours" clubs, as well as large outdoor events, create a similar type of alternate atmosphere, but focus much more on vibrant visual effects, such as props and décor. In more recent years,{{When|date=November 2017}} large commercial events are held at the same locations year after year with similar reoccurring themes every year. Events like [[Electric Daisy Carnival]] and [[Tomorrowland (festival)|Tomorrowland]] are typically held at the same venue that holds mass numbers of people.

Some raves make use of [[paganism|pagan]] symbolism.  Modern raving venues attempt to immerse the raver in a fantasy-like world.  Indigenous imagery and spirituality can be characteristic in the Raving ethos.  In both the New Moon and Gateway collectives, "pagan altars are set up, sacred images from primitive cultures decorate the walls, and rituals of cleansing are performed over the turntables and the dance floor"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hutson | first1 = Scott R. | year = 2000 | title = The Rave: Spiritual Healing in Modern Western Subcultures | journal = Anthropological Quarterly | volume = 73 | issue = 1| pages = 40–41 | jstor=3317473}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of spatial strategy is an integral part of the raving experience because it sets the initial "vibe" in which the ravers will immerse themselves.  This said "vibe" is a concept in the raver ethos that represents the allure and receptiveness of an environment's portrayed and or innate energy.  The landscape is an integral feature in the composition of rave, much like it is in pagan rituals.  For example, The Numic Ghost Dancers rituals were held on specific geographical sites, considered to hold powerful natural flows of energy.  These sites were later represented in the rhythmic dances, in order to achieve a greater level of connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carroll | first1 = Alex K. | last2 = Zedeno | first2 = M.

A sense of participation in a group event is among the chief appeals of rave music and dancing to pulsating beats is its immediate outlet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Joining In: An investigation in participatory music | author=Everit, Anthony | quote=A rave or a rock concert is not simply a presentation which audiences attend, but a communal event (like a secular church service) in which everyone has an active part. | url=http://www.gulbenkian.org.uk/pdffiles/Joining-in-text-no-photos.pdf | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731195611/http://www.gulbenkian.org.uk/pdffiles/Joining-in-text-no-photos.pdf | archivedate=31 July 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Music as Social Life: The Politics of Participation. | publisher=Chicago: University of Chicago Press | author=Turino, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raving in itself is a syllabus-free dance, whereby the movements are [[freestyle dance|not predefined and the dance is performed randomly]], dancers take immediate inspiration from the music, their mood and watching other people dancing. Thus, the electronic, rave and club dances refer to the [[street dance]] styles that evolved alongside electronic music culture. Such dances are street dances since they evolved alongside the underground rave and club movements, without the intervention of [[dance studios]]. These dances were originated in some 'scenes' around the world, becoming known only to ravers or clubgoers who attempt to these locations. They were originated at some point that certain moves had begun to be performed to several people at those places, creating a completely freestyle, yet still highly complex set of moves, adaptable to every dancer change and dance whatever they want based on these moves. Many rave dancing techniques suggest using your body as an extension of the music, to loosen up, and let the music flow through the body to create a unique form of movement.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

A common feature shared by all these dances, alongside with being originated at clubs, raves and music festivals around the world and in different years, is that when [[YouTube]] and other social media started to become popular (around 2006), these dances began to be popularized by videos of raves performing them, recording and uploading their videos.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Therefore, they began to be practiced outside their places of origin, creating different 'scenes' in several countries. Furthermore, some of these dances began to evolve, and these dance 'scenes' are not totally related to the club/rave scenes they were originated. Also, the way of teaching and learning them have changed. In the past, if someone wanted to learn one of these dances, the person had to go to a club/rave, watch people dancing and try to copy them. Now,{{When|date=November 2017}} with social media, these dances are mostly taught on video tutorials and the culture spreads and grows inside those social media, like Flogger on [[Fotolog]], Rebolation, Sensualize and Free Step on [[Orkut]] and Cutting Shapes on [[Instagram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/100325/1/Heller_David_r.pdf|title=I-Rave: digiphrenia's transformation of a culture|first=David|last=Heller|publisher=[[University of Hawai'i at Mãnoa]]|accessdate=November 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due the lack of studies dedicated to those dances, combined with poor and inaccurate information of them available on the Internet, it is hard to find reliable information.

The loose, casual and sports clothing was originally adopted by the acid house set earlier on in [[Ibiza]], utilizing easy-to-dance-in attire from hip hop and football/soccer culture. As well as clothing there developed a range of accessories carried by many ravers including: [[Vicks VapoRub]], which ravers find pleasant under the influence of MDMA, [[pacifier]]s to satiate the need to grind one's teeth ([[bruxism]]) caused by taking MDMA, and [[glow stick]]s which adjunct the mild [[psychedelia]] of MDMA's effect.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In the United States and other countries, rave fashion is characterized by colorful clothing and accessories, most notably "kandi" jewellery, that [[Fluorescence|fluoresce]] under ultraviolet light. They contain words or phrases that are unique to the raver and they can choose to trade with each other using "PLUR" (Peace, Love, Unity, Respect). In European countries, this kandi culture is much less common. Most raves are illegal and take place outside or in poorly heated warehouses, so keeping warm is a priority.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} [[Dreadlocks]], dyed hair and [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawks]] are popular, as are tattoos and piercings. Clothing is vibrant and alternative, often taking inspiration from new-age [[punk rock|punk]] and [[grunge]] style. However, there is no set dress code for the illegal rave scene.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Some global rave events such as [[Sensation (event)|Sensation]] adopted a strict minimalistic dress policy, either all white or black attire.

Since rave culture has seen such an explosion in the US since 2010 as the rave scene is no longer illegal or underground, raves in the US are now{{When|date=November 2017}} so popular that there are many brands, retailers, and websites selling apparel, costumes, and accessories just for those who go to dress up at raves. This style of attire, along with the entire rave culture, is now{{When|date=November 2017}} spilling out into the mainstream, especially in the US. Sometimes called "rave fashion" or "festival fashion," it now includes all kinds of accessories to create unique looks depending on the person and event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/the-evolution-of-rave-fashion-4391090|title=The Evolution of Rave Fashion|author=Mary Grace Cerni|work=L.A.

Some ravers participate in one of four light-oriented dances, called ''glowsticking'', ''glowstringing'', ''gloving'', and ''lightshows''. Of the four types of light-orientated dances, gloving in particular has evolved beyond and outside of the rave culture. Other types of light-related dancing include [[LED]] lights, flash-lights and blinking strobe lights. LEDs come in various colours with different settings.
[[Gloving]] has evolved into a separate dance form that has grown exponentially in the last couple of years.{{When|date=November 2017}}  Since then the culture has extended to all ages, ranging from kids in their early teens to college students and more. The traditional Rav'n lights are limited now, but many stores have developed newer, brighter, and more advanced version of lights with a plethora of colors and modes—modes include solid, stribbon, strobe, dops, hyper flash, and other variations.

===Drug use===

Among the various elements of 1970s disco subculture that ravers drew on, in addition to basing their scene around dance music mixed by [[DJ]]s, ravers also inherited the positive attitude towards using [[club drug]]s to "enhanc[e]...the sensory experience" of dancing to loud music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2004/0601/p2619.html|title=Club Drugs: MDMA, Gamma-Hydroxybutyrate (GHB), Rohypnol, and Ketamine|first=Paul M.|last=Gahlinger|date=1 June 2004|journal=American Family Physician|volume=69|issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, disco dancers and ravers preferred different drugs. Whereas 1970s disco scene members preferred [[cocaine]] and the depressant/sedative [[Quaaludes]], ravers preferred MDMA, 2C-B, [[amphetamine]], [[morphine]] and other pills. According to the FBI, raves are one of the most popular venues where [[club drugs]] are distributed, and as such feature a prominent drug subculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/clubdrugs |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329215407/https://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/clubdrugs |archivedate=29 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AdlafSmart1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adlaf|first1=Edward M.|last2=Smart|first2=Reginald G.|title=Party Subculture or Dens of Doom?

"[[Poppers]]" is the street name for [[alkyl nitrites]] (the most well-known being [[amyl nitrite]]), which are inhaled for their intoxicating effects, notably the "rush" or "high" they can provide. Nitrites originally came as small glass capsules that were popped open, which led to the nickname "poppers." The drug became popular in the US first on the disco/club scene of the 1970s and then at dance and rave venues in the 1980s and 1990s. In the 2000s, synthetic [[phenethylamines]] such as [[2C-I]], [[2C-B]] and [[2,5-Dimethoxy-4-bromoamphetamine|DOB]] have been referred to as club drugs due to their stimulating and psychedelic nature (and their chemical relationship with [[MDMA]]).&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.bbc.co.uk/onelife/drink_drugs/2ci/ BBC-2C-I]&lt;/ref&gt; By late 2012, derivates of the [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] 2C-X drugs, the [[NBOMe]]s and especially [[25I-NBOMe]], had become common at raves in Europe. In the U.S., some law enforcement agencies have branded the subculture as a [[Recreational drug use|drug-centric]] culture, as rave attendees have been known to use drugs such as [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[2CB]], and [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Groups that have addressed alleged drug use at raves e.g. the Electronic Music Defense and Education Fund (EM:DEF), The Toronto Raver Info Project ([[Canada]]), [[DanceSafe]] ([[United States|USA]] and [[Canada]]), and [[Eve &amp; Rave]] ([[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]]), all of which advocate [[harm reduction]] approaches. In 2005, Antonio Maria Costa, Executive Director of the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], advocated drug testing on highways as a countermeasure against drug use at raves.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
Much of the controversy, [[moral panic]] and law enforcement attention directed at rave culture and its association with drug use may be due to reports of drug overdoses (particularly MDMA) at raves, concerts and festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Armenian, Mamantov, Tsutaoka, Gerona, Silman, Wu, Olson |title=Multiple MDMA (Ecstasy) Overdoses at a Rave Event-A Case Series |journal=Journal of Intensive Care Medicine |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=252–258 |year=2012 |url=http://jic.sagepub.com/content/28/4/252 |doi=10.1177/0885066612445982|pmid=22640978 |citeseerx=10.1.1.668.2071 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History by country==

=== Canada ===
In 2001 Calgary, Alberta became the first major municipality in Canada to pass a bylaw with respect to raves. The intent of the bylaw was to ensure that raves would be safe for participants, and also not unduly disruptive to adjacent neighbourhoods. The bylaw was created in consultation with representatives from the municipality, the province of Alberta, and the rave community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunter|first=Sylvia|date=2002|title=Raves reviewed: An extended dance event bylaw|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.25316/IR-158|journal=Plan Canada|language=en|volume=42 | issue = 1 |pages=27–28|doi=10.25316/ir-158|issn=0032-0544|via=VIUSpace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1988, acid house was making as significant an impact on popular consciousness in Germany and Central Europe as it had in England.&lt;ref&gt;Short [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpC0qlWKb_Q excerpt] from special on German "Tele 5" from Dec.8, 1988. The show is called "Tanzhouse" hosted by a young Fred Kogel. It includes footage from Hamburg's "Front" with Boris Dlugosch, Kemal Kurum's "Opera House" and the "Prinzenbar".&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 German DJs [[Westbam]] and Dr. Motte established the [[Ufo (Club, Berlin)|Ufo Club]], an illegal party venue, and co-founded the [[Love Parade]].&lt;ref name=ROBB&gt;Robb, D. (2002), Techno in Germany: Its Musical Origins and Cultural Relevance, ''German as a Foreign Language Journal'', No.2, 2002, (p. 134).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pioneeringdays"&gt;{{cite web|title=The pioneering days of techno|url=http://www.spiegel.de/einestages/die-pioniertage-des-techno-a-949509.html| publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]|date= 31 July 2008|accessdate=25 February 2017| language=de|}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 November 1989 the [[Berlin Wall]] fell, free underground Techno parties mushroomed in [[East Berlin]], and a rave scene comparable to that in the UK was established.&lt;ref name=ROBB/&gt; East German DJ [[Paul van Dyk]] has remarked that the Techno-based rave scene was a major force in re-establishing social connections between East and West Germany during the unification period.&lt;ref&gt;Messmer, S. (1998), ''Eierkuchensozialismus'', TAZ, 10.7.1998, (p. 26).&lt;/ref&gt; In urbanized Germany raves and techno parties often preferred industrial sceneries such as decommissioned power stations, factories, the canalization or former military properties of the cold war.&lt;ref name="illegalraves"&gt;{{cite web|title=Youth: Love and Cabbage|url=http://magazin.spiegel.de/EpubDelivery/spiegel/pdf/9085950 | publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]|date= 26 August 1996|accessdate=25 February 2017| language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 a number of party venues closed, including [[Ufo (Club, Berlin)|Ufo]], and the Berlin Techno scene centred itself around three locations close to the foundations of the Berlin Wall: the [[E-Werk]], the [[Bunker (Berlin)|Bunker]] and the now legendary [[Tresor (club)|Tresor]].&lt;ref&gt;Henkel, O.; Wolff, K. (1996) ''Berlin Underground: Techno und Hiphop; Zwischen Mythos und Ausverkauf'', Berlin: FAB Verlag, (pp. 81–83).&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period, German DJs began intensifying the speed and abrasiveness of the sound, as an acid-infused techno began transmuting into [[hardcore techno|hardcore]].&lt;ref&gt;Schuler, M. (1995), "Gabber + Hardcore" (p. 123), in Anz, P.; Walder, P. (eds.) (1999 rev. edn, 1st publ. 1995, Zurich: Verlag Ricco Bilger) ''Techno''. Reinbek: Rowohlt Taschenbuch Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; This emerging sound was influenced by Dutch [[gabber]] and Belgian hardcore. Other influences on the development of this style were European [[Electronic Body Music]] groups of the mid-1980s such as [[Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft|DAF]], [[Front 242]], and [[Nitzer Ebb]].&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, S. (1998), ''Energy Flash: a Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture'', Pan Macmillan, (p. 110).&lt;/ref&gt;

Across Europe, rave culture was becoming part of a new youth movement. DJs and electronic-music producers such as Westbam proclaimed the existence of a "raving society" and promoted [[electronic music]] as legitimate competition for [[rock and roll]]. Indeed, [[electronic dance music]] and rave subculture became mass movements. Since the mid 1990s, raves had tens of thousands of attendees, youth magazines featured styling tips, and television networks launched music magazines on House and Techno music.&lt;ref name="technoculture"&gt;{{cite web|title=Young is the Night: Nightlife from A to Z |url=http://magazin.spiegel.de/EpubDelivery/spiegel/pdf/7441075 | publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]|date= 1 August 1998|accessdate=25 February 2017| language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="munichfoundcom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Corpus Techno: The music of the future will soon be history |url=http://www.munichfound.com/archives/id/27/article/496/|publisher=MUNICHfound.com|date=July 1997|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual [[Love Parade]] festivals in Berlin and later the Metropolitan Ruhr area repeatedly attracted more than one million party-goers between 1997 and 2010. Dozens of other annual [[technoparade]]s took place in Germany and Central Europe at that time, the largest ones being [[Union Move]], Generation Move, Reincarnation and Vision Parade as well as [[Street Parade]] and [[Lake Parade]] in Switzerland. Large commercial raves since the nineties include [[Mayday (music festival)|Mayday]], [[Nature One]], [[Time Warp Festival|Time Warp]], [[SonneMondSterne]] and [[Melt! Festival|Melt!]]. Beyond Berlin, further centers of the techno and rave scene of the 1990s and 2000s in Germany were Frankfurt (famous clubs were ''Omen'', ''[[Dorian Gray (club)|Dorian Gray]]'', ''[[Cocoon (club)|Cocoon]]'' and ''U60311'') and Munich (''Ultraschall'', ''KW – Das Heizkraftwerk'', ''Natraj Temple'', ''Harry Klein'' and ''Rote Sonne'').&lt;ref name="ronaldhitzler"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hitzler |first1=Ronald |last2=Pfadenhauer |first2=Michaela |last3=Hillebrandt |first3=Frank |last4=Kneer |first4=Georg | last5=Kraemer|first5=Klaus | title=Loss of safety?

Further popular venues include ''Stammheim (Aufschwung Ost)'' in Kassel, ''Tunnel Club'' in Hamburg and ''Distillery'' in Leipzig. Since the late 2000s, Berlin is still called the capital of electro music and rave, and techno clubs such as [[Berghain]], [[Tresor (club)|Tresor]], ''Watergate'' or [[KitKatClub]] and the way to party in barely renovated venues, ruins or wooden shacks such as, among many others, [[Club der Visionaere]], ''Wilde Renate'', ''Fiese Remise'' or ''Bar 25'', attracted international media attention.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite web|title=In Berlin, Still Partying in the Ruins |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/23/travel/in-berlin-still-partying-in-the-ruins.html?_r=0|publisher=New York Times|date=21 November 2014|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One movie that portraits this scene of the 2000s is [[Berlin Calling]] starring Paul Kalkbrenner. In the 2010s, there remains a vivid rave and techno scene throughout the country, including numerous festivals and world-class techno clubs also outside of Berlin, such as for example ''MMA Club (Mixed Munich Arts)'' in Munich, ''Institut für Zukunft'' in Leipzig or ''Robert Johnson'' in Offenbach.&lt;ref name=" electronicbeats"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.electronicbeats.net/10-best-clubs-germany-arent-berlin/ |title= The 10 best clubs in Germany that aren’t in Berlin | publisher=[[Electronic Beats]] |date=30 January 2017 |accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

====Birth of UK rave scene (1980s–1990s)====
{{See also|Second Summer of Love|Acid house party}}
The UK was finally recognized for its rave culture in the late 1980s and early 1990s. By 1991, organisations such as [[Fantazia (dance)|Fantazia]] and [[Raindance (rave)|Raindance]]  were holding massive legal raves in fields and warehouses around the country. The Fantazia party at Castle Donington, July 1992 was an open-air, all-night event.  The Vision at Pophams airfield in August 1992 and Universe's [[Tribal Gathering]] in 1993 had a more festival feel.

By the middle of 1992, the scene was slowly changing, with local councils passing by-laws and increasing fees in an effort to prevent or discourage rave organisations from acquiring necessary licences.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} This meant that the days of the large one-off parties were numbered. By the mid-1990s, the scene had also fragmented into many different styles of dance music, making large parties more expensive to set up and more difficult to promote. The sound driving the big raves of the early 1990s had by the end of 1993 split into two distinct and polarising styles, the darker [[oldschool jungle|jungle]] and the faster [[happy hardcore]]. Although many ravers left the scene due to the split, promoters such as ESP Dreamscape and [[Helter Skelter (rave music promoter)|Helter Skelter]] still enjoyed widespread popularity and capacity attendances with multi-arena events catering to the various genres. Notable events of this period included ESP's outdoor Dreamscape 20 event on 9 September 1995 at Brafield aerodrome fields, [[Northamptonshire|Northants]] and Helter Skelter's Energy 97 outdoor event on 9th Aug 1997 at Turweston Aerodrome, Northants.

====Free parties and outlawing of raves (1992–1994)====
{{See also|Free party}}
The illegal [[free party]] scene also reached its zenith for that time after a particularly large festival, when many individual sound systems such as Bedlam, Circus Warp, DIY, and [[Spiral Tribe]] set up near [[Castlemorton Common Festival|Castlemorton]] Common. The government acted. Under the ''[[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]]'', the definition of music played at a rave was given as:

{{quote|"Music" includes sounds wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats.|Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1994/ukpga_19940033_en_8#pt5-pb2 |title=Public Order: Collective Trespass or Nuisance on Land – Powers to remove trespassers on land – Powers to remove persons attending or preparing for a rave |work=Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 |publisher=[[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]] |accessdate=9 June 2008| year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sections 63, 64 &amp; 65 of the Act targeted [[electronic dance music]] played at raves. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act empowered police to stop a rave in the open air when a hundred or more people are attending, or where two or more are making preparations for a rave. Section 65 allows any uniformed constable who believes a person is on their way to a rave within a five-mile radius to stop them and direct them away from the area; non-compliant citizens may be subject to a maximum fine not exceeding level 3 on the [[standard scale]] (£1000). The Act was officially introduced because of the noise and disruption caused by all night parties to nearby residents, and to protect the countryside. However, some participants in the scene claimed it was an attempt to lure youth culture away from MDMA and back to taxable [[alcohol]].&lt;ref&gt;Simon Reynolds, ''Energy Flash: A Journey through Rave Music and Dance Culture'', Pan Macmillan, (p. 149) ({{ISBN|0330350560}})&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1994, the Zippies staged an act of [[Intervasion of the UK|electronic civil disobedience]] to protest against the CJB (i.e., [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994|Criminal Justice Bill]]).

====Legal and underground raves (1994–present)====
After 1993, the main outlet for raves in the UK were a number of licensed parties, amongst them [[Helter Skelter (rave music promoter)|Helter Skelter]], Life at Bowlers (Trafford Park, Manchester), The Edge (formerly the Eclipse [Coventry]), The Sanctuary (Milton Keynes) and Club Kinetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

"The Laser Dome" featured two separate dance areas, "Hardcore" and "Garage", as well as over 20 video game machines, a silent-movie screening lounge, replicas of the "Statue of Liberty", "San Francisco Bridge", and a large glass maze. In Scotland, event promoters Rezerection held large-scale events across the country.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

By 1997, the popularity of weekly Superclub nights had taken over from the old Rave format, with a raft of new club-based genres sweeping in (e.g. Trance, Hard House, Speed and UK garage) alongside the more traditional House sound that had regained popularity.  Clubs like Gatecrasher and Cream rose to prominence with dress codes and door policies that were the polar opposite of their rave counterparts; stories of refused entry due to not wearing the right clothing were commonplace, but seemingly did nothing to deter Superclub attendance.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

====Origins in disco and psychedelia (1970s)====
{{See also|Circuit party}}
American ravers, following their early UK &amp; European counterparts, have been compared to the hippies of the 1960s due to their shared interest in non-violence and psychedelia.&lt;ref&gt;Energy Flash, Simon Reynolds, (p276 &amp; 290), 1998, Macmillan Publishers ({{ISBN|0330350560}})&lt;/ref&gt; Rave culture incorporated disco culture's same love of dance music spun by DJs, drug exploration, sexual promiscuity, and hedonism. Although disco culture had thrived in the mainstream, the rave culture would make an effort to stay underground to avoid the animosity that was still surrounding disco and dance music. The key motive for remaining underground in many parts of the US had to do with curfew and the standard 2:00 am closing of clubs. It was a desire to keep the party going past legal hours that created the underground direction. Because of the legality, they had to be secretive about time and place.

====New York raves and party promoters (1980s)====
In the late 1980s, rave culture began to filter through into North America from English expatriates and from US DJs who would visit Europe. However, rave culture's major expansion in North America is often credited to [[Frankie Bones]], who after spinning a party in an aircraft hangar in England, helped organize some of the earliest American raves in the 1990s in New York City called "Storm Raves". Storm Raves had a consistent core audience, fostered  by zines by fellow Storm DJ (and co-founder, with Adam X and Frankie Bones, of the US techno record store, Groove Records.). [[Heather Heart]] held Under One Sky. Simultaneously in NYC, events were introducing electronic dance music to this city's dance scene. Between 1992 and 1994, promotional groups sprung up across the east coast.

====San Diego and Latin America (1990s)====
In the 1990s, San Diego held large raves with audiences of thousands. These festivals were  held on Indian reservations and ski resorts during the summer months and were headlined by DJs such as Doc Martin, Dimitri of [[Deee-lite]], Afrika Islam and the [[Hardkiss]] brothers from San Francisco. They helped to create the Right to Dance movement—a non violent protest held in San Diego and later in Los Angeles.

Featuring local San Diego DJs Jon Bishop, Steve Pagan, Alien Tom, Jeff Skot and Mark E. Quark performed at these events. The events used large props and themes. The fairy and pixie craze, with ravers getting fairy tattoos and wearing fairy wings to parties was associated with the region. The percussive group [[Crash Worship]] was active here.

====Growth in California====
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a boom in rave culture in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. At first, small underground parties sprung up all over the [[South of Market, San Francisco|SOMA]] district in vacant warehouses, loft spaces, and clubs. The no alcohol rule fueled the ecstasy-driven parties. Small underground raves were just starting out and expanding beyond SF to include the East Bay, the South Bay area including San Jose, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz beaches.

In late 1991, raves started to expand across northern California, and cities like Sacramento, Oakland, Silicon Valley (Palo Alto, San Jose). The massive parties were taking place in outdoor fields, airplane hangars and hilltops that surround the valley. San Francisco's early promoters and DJs were from the UK and Europe. Raves took place in some of the SOMA art museum event such as, 'Where the wild things are' in the museum on top of the Sony Metreon, and in the Maritime hall (1998–2002).

By the end of 1994, a new generation of ravers were attracted by the new sounds. EDM began to become popular. Raves could be found in many different kinds of venues, as opposed to just basements and warehouses. Promoters started to take notice and put together the massives of the late 1990s with many music forms under one roof for 12-hour events. 2000 saw the demise of massive raves as curfews were placed on permits handed out to promoters. Instead of all night and into the next day, parties now had to end at 2 a.m.  Smaller, intimate venues continued just like they had from the start and underground raves became the norm. The [[Electric Daisy Carnival#2010|death of an attendee who had taken MDMA]] at the [[Electric Daisy Carnival]] in 2010 put a negative spin on raves in LA and California.

====Seattle====
Through the mid 1990s and into the 2000s the city of Seattle also shared in the tradition of West Coast rave culture. Though a smaller scene compared to San Francisco, Seattle also had many different rave crews, promoters, Djs, and fans. Candy Raver style, friendship and culture became popular in the West Coast rave scene, both in Seattle and San Francisco. At the peak of West Coast rave, Candy Raver, and massive rave popularity (1996–1999,) it was common to meet groups of ravers, promoters, and Djs who frequently travelled between Seattle and San Francisco, which spread the overall sense of West Coast rave culture and the phenomenon of West Coast "massives".

====Recent years (2000s)====
{{See also|List of electronic dance music festivals}}
By 2010, raves were becoming the equivalent of large-scale rock music festivals, but many times even bigger and more profitable. The [[Electric Daisy Carnival]] in Las Vegas drew more than 300,000 fans over three days in the summer of 2012, making it the largest EDM music festival in North America. [[Ultra Music Festival]] in Miami drew 150,000 fans over three days in 2012 while other raves like [[Electric Zoo]] in New York, [[Beyond Wonderland]] in LA, Movement in Detroit, [[Electric Forest]] in Michigan, Spring Awakening in Chicago, and dozens more now attract hundreds of thousands of "ravers" every year. These new EDM-based rave events (now simply referred generically to as "[[music festivals]]") sell out. Festival attendance at the Electric Daisy Carnival (EDC) increased by 39.1%, or 90,000 attendees from 2011 to 2012. In 2013, EDC had attendance of approximately 345,000 people, a record for the festival. The average ticket for EDC cost over $300 and the event contributed $278 million to the Clark County economy in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://w.insomniac.com/newsDetails.php?news=607 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150121204609/http://w.insomniac.com/newsDetails.php?news=607 |archivedate=21 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This festival takes place at a 1,000-acre complex featuring a half dozen custom built stages, enormous interactive art installations, and hundreds of EDM artists. [[Insomniac Events|Insomniac]], a US EDM event promoter, holds yearly EDC and other EDM events.

====1980s and 1990s: outdoor raves and the Sydney scene====
Rave parties began in Australia as early as the 1980s and continued well into the late 1990s. They were mobilised versions of the 'warehouse parties', across Britain. Similar to the United States and Britain, raves in Australia were unlicensed and held in spaces normally used for industrial and manufacturing purposes, such as [[warehouses]], [[factories]] and carpet showrooms. In addition, suburban locations were also used: basketball gymnasiums, train stations and even circus tents were all common venues. In [[Sydney]], common areas used for outdoor events included [[Sydney Park]], a reclaimed garbage dump in the inner south west of the city, Cataract Park and various other natural, unused locations and bush lands. The raves placed a heavy emphasis on the connection between humans and the natural environment, thus many raves in Sydney were held outdoors, notably the 'Happy Valley' parties (1991–1994), 'Ecology' (1992) and 'Field of Dreams 4' (July 6, 1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.snarl.org/youth/chrispagan2.pdf|title=Rave culture in Sydney, Australia: mapping youth spaces in media discourse|first=Chris|last=Pagan|publisher=[[University of Sydney]]|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sydneyravehistory.com/#!rave-timeline/c66t|title = Timeline of Sydney Raves from the website – Sydney Rave History}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mid-late 1990s saw a slight decline in rave attendance, attributed to the [[Anna Wood (born 1980)|death of Anna Wood]] at a licensed inner-city Sydney venue, which was hosting a rave party known as "Apache". Wood had taken [[MDMA|ecstasy]] and died in hospital a few days later, leading to extensive media exposure on the correlation of drug culture and its links to the rave scene in Australia.

====2000s&amp;ndash;present====
The tradition continued in [[Melbourne]], with 'Earthcore' parties. Raves also became less underground as they were in the 1990s, and many were held at licensed venues well into the 2000s. Despite this, rave parties of 1990s size became less common. Nonetheless, the rave scene in Australia experienced a resurgence after 2010. During this period the resurfacing of the "Melbourne Shuffle", a Melbourne club/rave dance style, became a YouTube trend and  videos were uploaded. The rave subculture in Melbourne was strengthened with the opening of clubs such as Bass Station and Hard Candy and the rise of [[free party]] groups such as Melbourne Underground. Melbourne helped keep raving culture alive with young people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21231">In [[applied statistics]], '''regression-kriging (RK)''' is a spatial prediction technique that combines a [[regression analysis|regression]] of the dependent variable on auxiliary variables (such as parameters derived from digital elevation modelling, remote sensing/imagery, and thematic maps) with [[kriging]] of the regression residuals. It is mathematically equivalent to the interpolation method variously called ''[[universal kriging]]'' and ''kriging with external drift'', where auxiliary predictors are used directly to solve the kriging weights.&lt;ref name="Pebesma2006IJGIS"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pebesma|first=Edzer J|title=The Role of External Variables and GIS Databases in Geostatistical Analysis|journal=Transactions in GIS|date=1 July 2006|volume=10|issue=4|pages=615–632|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9671.2006.01015.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== BLUP for spatial data ==

[[File:The universal model of spatial variation.jpg|thumb|400px|The universal model of spatial variation scheme.]]

Regression-kriging is an implementation of the [[best linear unbiased prediction|best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP)]] for spatial data, i.e. the best linear interpolator assuming the [[universal model of spatial variation]]. Matheron (1969) proposed that a value of a target variable at some location can be modeled as a sum of the deterministic and stochastic components:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Matheron|first=Georges|title=Le krigeage universel|year=1969|publisher=École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris|chapter=Part 1 of Cahiers du Centre de morphologie mathématique de Fontainebleau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
Z(\mathbf{s}) = m(\mathbf{s}) + \varepsilon '(\mathbf{s}) + \varepsilon ''
&lt;/math&gt;

which he termed ''universal model of spatial variation''. Both [[deterministic system|deterministic]] and [[stochastic process|stochastic components]] of spatial variation can be modeled separately. By combining the two approaches, we obtain:

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat z(\mathbf{s}_0 ) = \hat m(\mathbf{s}_0 ) + \hat e(\mathbf{s}_0 )= \sum\limits_{k = 0}^p {\hat \beta _k \cdot q_k (\mathbf{s}_0 )} + \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n \lambda_i \cdot e(\mathbf{s}_i )
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\hat m(\mathbf{s}_0)&lt;/math&gt; is the fitted deterministic part, &lt;math&gt;\hat e(\mathbf{s}_0)&lt;/math&gt; is the interpolated residual, &lt;math&gt;\hat \beta _k&lt;/math&gt; are estimated deterministic model coefficients (&lt;math&gt;\hat \beta _0&lt;/math&gt; is the estimated intercept), &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt; are kriging weights determined by the spatial dependence structure of the residual and where &lt;math&gt;e(\mathbf{s}_i)&lt;/math&gt; is the residual at location &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{s}}_i&lt;/math&gt;. The regression coefficients &lt;math&gt;\hat \beta _k&lt;/math&gt; can be estimated from the sample by some fitting method, e.g. [[ordinary least squares]] (OLS) or, optimally, using [[generalized least squares]] (GLS):&lt;ref name=Cressie2012Wiley&gt;{{cite book|last=Cressie|first=Noel|title=Statistics for spatio-temporal data|year=2012|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=9780471692744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{\hat \beta }_\mathtt{GLS} = \left( \mathbf{q}^\mathbf{T} \cdot
\mathbf{C}^{ - \mathbf{1}} \cdot \mathbf{q} \right)^{ - \mathbf{1}} \cdot

&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat \beta}_\mathtt{GLS}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of estimated regression coefficients, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt; is the covariance matrix of the residuals, &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{q}}&lt;/math&gt; is a matrix of predictors at the sampling locations and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of measured values of the target variable. The GLS estimation of regression coefficients is, in fact, a special case of the geographically weighted regression. In the case, the weights are determined objectively to account for the spatial auto-correlation between the residuals.

Once the deterministic part of variation has been estimated (regression-part), the residual can be interpolated with kriging and added to the estimated trend. The estimation of the residuals is an iterative process: first the deterministic part of variation is estimated using OLS, then the covariance function of the residuals is used to obtain the GLS coefficients. Next, these are used to re-compute the residuals, from which an updated covariance function is computed, and so on. Although this is by many geostatisticians recommended as the proper procedure, Kitanidis (1994) showed that use of the covariance function derived from the OLS residuals (i.e. a single iteration) is often satisfactory, because it is not different enough from the function derived after several iterations; i.e. it does not affect much the final predictions. Minasny and McBratney (2007) report similar results—it seems that using more higher quality data is more important then to use more sophisticated statistical methods.&lt;ref name="MinasnyMcBratney2007Geoderma"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Minasny|first=Budiman|author2=McBratney, Alex B. |title=Spatial prediction of soil properties using EBLUP with the Matérn covariance function|journal=Geoderma|date=31 July 2007|volume=140|issue=4|pages=324–336|doi=10.1016/j.geoderma.2007.04.028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Decision tree for selecting a suitable spatial prediction model.jpg|thumb|400px|Decision tree for selecting a suitable spatial prediction model.]]

Many (geo)statisticians believe that there is only one Best Linear Unbiased Prediction model for spatial data (e.g. regression-kriging), all other techniques such as ordinary kriging, environmental correlation, averaging of values per polygons or inverse distance interpolation can be seen as its special cases. If the residuals show no spatial auto-correlation (pure nugget effect), the regression-kriging converges to pure multiple linear regression, because the covariance matrix (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt;) becomes an identity matrix. Likewise, if the target variable shows no correlation with the auxiliary predictors, the regression-kriging model reduces to ordinary kriging model because the deterministic part equals the (global) mean value. Hence, pure kriging and pure regression should be considered as only special cases of regression-kriging (see figure).

== RK and UK/KED ==

The geostatistical literature uses many different terms for what are essentially the same or at least very similar techniques. This confuses the users and distracts them from using the right technique for their mapping projects. In fact, both universal kriging, kriging with external drift, and regression-kriging are basically the same technique.

Matheron (1969) originally termed the technique ''Le krigeage universel'', however, the technique was intended as a generalized case of kriging where the trend is modelled as a function of coordinates. Thus, many authors reserve the term ''universal kriging'' (UK) for the case when only the coordinates are used as predictors. If the deterministic part of variation (''drift'') is defined externally as a linear function of some auxiliary variables, rather than the coordinates, the term ''kriging with external drift'' (KED) is preferred (according to Hengl 2007, "About regression-kriging: From equations to case studies"). In the case of UK or KED, the predictions are made as with kriging, with the difference that the covariance matrix of residuals is extended with the auxiliary predictors. However, the drift and residuals can also be estimated separately and then summed. This procedure was suggested by Ahmed et al. (1987) and Odeh et al. (1995) later named it ''regression-kriging'', while Goovaerts (1997) uses the term ''kriging with a trend model'' to refer to a family of interpolators, and refers to RK as ''simple kriging with varying local means''. Minasny and McBratney (2007) simply call this technique Empirical Best Linear Unbiased Predictor i.e. ''E-BLUP''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahmed|first=Shakeel|author2=De Marsily, Ghislain|title=Comparison of geostatistical methods for estimating transmissivity using data on transmissivity and specific capacity|journal=Water Resources Research|date=1 January 1987|volume=23|issue=9|pages=1717|doi=10.1029/WR023i009p01717}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Odeh1995&gt;{{cite journal|last=Odeh|first=I.O.A.|author2=McBratney, A.B. |author3=Chittleborough, D.J. |title=Further results on prediction of soil properties from terrain attributes: heterotopic cokriging and regression-kriging|journal=Geoderma|date=31 July 1995|volume=67|issue=3-4|pages=215–226|doi=10.1016/0016-7061(95)00007-B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hengl2004Geoderma&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hengl|first=Tomislav|author2=Heuvelink, Gerard B.M. |author3=Stein, Alfred |title=A generic framework for spatial prediction of soil variables based on regression-kriging|journal=Geoderma|date=30 April 2004|volume=120|issue=1-2|pages=75–93|doi=10.1016/j.geoderma.2003.08.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MinasnyMcBratney2007Geoderma" /&gt;

In the case of KED, predictions at new locations are made by:

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{z}_\mathtt{KED} (\mathbf{s}_0 ) = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n
w_i^\mathtt{KED} (\mathbf{s}_0 ) \cdot z(\mathbf{s}_i )
&lt;/math&gt;

for

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n w_i^\mathtt{KED} (\mathbf{s}_0 ) \cdot q_k (\mathbf{s}_i ) = q_k (\mathbf{s}_0 )
&lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;k = 1,\ldots,p&lt;/math&gt; or in matrix notation:

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat z_\mathtt{KED} (\mathbf{s}_0 ) = \mathbf{\delta}_\mathbf{0}^\mathbf{T} \cdot \mathbf{z}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is the target variable, &lt;math&gt;q_k&lt;/math&gt;'s are the predictor variables i.e. values at a new location &lt;math&gt;({\mathbf{s}}_0)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{\delta }}_{\mathbf{0}}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of KED weights (&lt;math&gt;w_i^{\mathtt{KED}}&lt;/math&gt;), &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the number of predictors and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; observations at primary locations. The KED weights are solved using the extended matrices:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{\lambda }_\mathbf{0}^\mathtt{KED} = \left\{ w_1^\mathtt{KED} (\mathbf{s}_0 ), \ldots ,w_n^\mathtt{KED} (\mathbf{s}_0 ),\varphi_0 (\mathbf{s}_0 ), \ldots ,\varphi _p (\mathbf{s}_0 ) \right\}^\mathbf{T} = \mathbf{C}^{\mathtt{KED} -1} \cdot \mathbf{c}_\mathbf{0}^\mathtt{KED}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{\lambda }}_{\mathbf{0}}^{\mathtt{KED}}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of solved weights, &lt;math&gt;\varphi _p&lt;/math&gt; are the Lagrange multipliers, &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{C}}^{\mathtt{KED}}&lt;/math&gt; is the extended covariance matrix of residuals and &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{c}}_{\mathbf{0}}^{\mathtt{KED}}&lt;/math&gt; is the extended vector of covariances at new location.

In the case of KED, the extended covariance matrix of residuals looks like this (Webster and Oliver, 2007; p.&amp;nbsp;183):&lt;ref name=WebsterOliver2007&gt;{{cite book|last=Webster|first=Richard|title=Geostatistics for environmental scientists|year=2007|publisher=Wiley|location=Chichester|isbn=9780470028582|edition=2nd|author2=Oliver, Margaret A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{C}^\mathtt{KED} = \left[
\begin{array}{ccccccc}
C(\mathbf{s}_1 , \mathbf{s}_1) &amp; \cdots &amp; C(\mathbf{s}_1, \mathbf{s}_n ) &amp; 1 &amp; q_1 (\mathbf{s}_1 ) &amp; \cdots &amp; q_p (\mathbf{s}_1 ) \\
\vdots  &amp;  &amp;  \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;  &amp; \vdots \\
C(\mathbf{s}_n, \mathbf{s}_1 ) &amp; \cdots  &amp; C(\mathbf{s}_n ,\mathbf{s}_n ) &amp; 1 &amp; q_1 (\mathbf{s}_n ) &amp;  \cdots  &amp; q_p (\mathbf{s}_n ) \\
1 &amp;  \cdots  &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
q_1 (\mathbf{s}_1 ) &amp; \cdots  &amp; q_1 (\mathbf{s}_n ) &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
\vdots  &amp;  &amp;  \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp;  &amp; \vdots \\
q_p (\mathbf{s}_1 ) &amp; \cdots  &amp; q_p (\mathbf{s}_n ) &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots  &amp; 0 
\end{array}
\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c}_{\mathbf{0}}^{\mathtt{KED}}&lt;/math&gt; like this:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{c}_\mathbf{0}^\mathtt{KED} = \left\{ C(\mathbf{s}_0, \mathbf{s}_1
), \ldots , C(\mathbf{s}_0, \mathbf{s}_n ), q_0 (\mathbf{s}_0 ), q_1 (\mathbf{s}_0 ), \ldots ,q_p (\mathbf{s}_0 )
\right\}^\mathbf{T};  q_0 (\mathbf{s}_0 ) = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, KED looks exactly as ordinary kriging, except the covariance matrix/vector are extended with values of auxiliary predictors.

Although the KED seems, at first glance, to be computationally more straightforward than RK, the parameters of the [[variogram]] for KED must also be estimated from regression residuals, thus requiring a separate regression modelling step. This regression should be GLS because of the likely spatial correlation between residuals. Note that many analyst use instead the OLS residuals, which may not be too different from the GLS residuals. However, they are not optimal if there is any spatial correlation, and indeed they may be quite different for clustered sample points or if the number of samples is relatively small (&lt;math&gt;\ll 200&lt;/math&gt;).

A limitation of KED is the instability of the extended matrix in the case that the covariate does not vary smoothly in space. RK has the advantage that it explicitly separates trend estimation from spatial prediction of residuals, allowing the use of arbitrarily-complex forms of regression, rather than the simple linear techniques that can be used with KED. In addition, it allows the separate interpretation of the two interpolated components. The emphasis on regression is important also because fitting of the deterministic part of variation (regression) is often more beneficial for the quality of final maps than fitting of the stochastic part (residuals).

Regression-kriging can be automated e.g. in [http://r-project.org R statistical computing] environment, by using gstat and/or geoR package. Typical inputs/outputs include:

INPUTS:
* Interpolation set (point map) — &lt;math&gt;z(\mathbf{s}_i)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;i=1,\ldots ,n&lt;/math&gt; at primary locations;
* Minimum and maximum expected values and measurement precision (&lt;math&gt;\Delta z&lt;/math&gt;);
* Continuous predictors (raster map) — &lt;math&gt;q(\mathbf{s})&lt;/math&gt;; at new unvisited locations
* Discrete predictors (polygon map);
* Validation set (point map) — &lt;math&gt;z*(\mathbf{s}_j)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;j=1,\ldots ,l&lt;/math&gt; (optional);
* Lag spacing and limiting distance (required to fit the variogram);

OUTPUTS:  	
* Map of predictions and relative prediction error;
* Best subset of predictors and correlation significance (adjusted R-square);
* Variogram model parameters (e.g. &lt;math&gt;C_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;)
* GLS drift model coefficients;
* Accuracy of prediction at validation points: mean prediction error (MPE) and root mean square prediction error (RMSPE);

== Application of regression-kriging ==

Regression-kriging is used in various applied fields, from meteorology, climatology, soil mapping, geological mapping, species distribution modeling and similar. The only requirement for using regression-kriging versus e.g. ordinary kriging is that one or more covariate layers exist, and which are significantly correlated with the feature of interest. Some general applications of regression-kriging are:

* Geostatistical mapping: Regression-kriging allows for use of hybrid geostatistical techniques to model e.g. spatial distribution of soil properties.
* [[Downscaling]] of maps: Regression-kriging can be used a framework to downscale various existing gridded maps. In this case the covariate layers need to be available at better resolution (which corresponds to the sampling intensity) than the original point data.&lt;ref name="Hengl2008CG"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hengl|first=Tomislav|author2=Bajat, Branislav |author3=Blagojević, Dragan |author4= Reuter, Hannes I. |title=Geostatistical modeling of topography using auxiliary maps|journal=Computers &amp; Geosciences|date=1 December 2008|volume=34|issue=12|pages=1886–1899|doi=10.1016/j.cageo.2008.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Error propagation]]: Simulated maps generated by using a regression-kriging model can be used for scenario testing and for estimating propagated uncertainty.

[[File:Simulations of zinc using regression-kriging model.png|thumb|none|Simulations of zinc concentrations derived using a regression-Kriging model. This model uses one continuous (distance to the river) and one categorical (flooding frequency) covariate. Code used to produce these maps is available [http://r-spatial.sourceforge.net/gallery/#fig07.R here].]]

Regression-kriging-based algorithms play more and more important role in geostatistics because the number of possible covariates is increasing every day.&lt;ref name="Pebesma2006IJGIS" /&gt; For example, [[Digital Elevation Model|DEM]]s are now available from a number of sources. Detailed and accurate images of topography can now be ordered from remote sensing systems such as [[SPOT (satellite)|SPOT]] and [[Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer|ASTER]]; SPOT5 offers the High Resolution Stereoscopic (HRS) scanner, which can be used to produce DEMs at resolutions of up to 5 m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Toutin|first=Thierry|title=Generation of DSMs from SPOT-5 in-track HRS and across-track HRG stereo data using spatiotriangulation and autocalibration|journal=ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing|date=30 April 2006|volume=60|issue=3|pages=170–181|doi=10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2006.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finer differences in elevation can also be obtained with airborne laser-scanners. The cost of data is either free or dropping in price as technology advances. NASA recorded most of the world's topography in the [[Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rabus|first=Bernhard|author2=Eineder, Michael |author3=Roth, Achim |author4= Bamler, Richard |title=The shuttle radar topography mission—a new class of digital elevation models acquired by spaceborne radar|journal=ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing|date=31 January 2003|volume=57|issue=4|pages=241–262|doi=10.1016/S0924-2716(02)00124-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; From summer of 2004, these data has been available (e.g. via [https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/get_data/data_pool USGS ftp]) for almost whole globe at resolution of about 90 m (for the North American continent at resolution of about 30 m). Likewise, [[MODIS]] multispectral images are freely available for download at resolutions of 250 m. A large free repository of Landsat images is also available for download via the [http://glcf.umiacs.umd.edu/ Global Land Cover Facility] (GLCF).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21234">'''Remodernism''' revives aspects of [[modernism]], particularly in its early form, and follows [[postmodernism]], to which it contrasts. Adherents of remodernism advocate it as a forward and radical, not reactionary, impetus.&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt;&lt;ref name=medina/&gt;

In 2000, [[Billy Childish]] and [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]], founders of the [[stuckism]] art movement instigated remodernism,&lt;ref name=packer/&gt; with a manifesto, ''Remodernism'' in an attempt to introduce a period of new spirituality into art, culture and society to replace postmodernism, which they said was cynical and spiritually bankrupt. In 2002, a remodernism art show in [[Albuquerque]] was accompanied by an essay from [[University of California, Berkeley]] art professor, Kevin Radley, who said there was a renewal of artists working without the limitation of irony and cynicism, and that there was a renewal of the sense of beauty.

In 2006, the [[Stedelijk Museum]] and the [[University of Amsterdam]] held a talk on remodernism with Daniel Birnbaum and Alison Gingeras; the introduction to this talked of the revival of painting as a possible return to traditional modernist values, such as [[Authenticity in art|authenticity]], self-expression and autonomy, as opposed to multimedia practice.
&lt;ref name=amsterdam/&gt; In 2008, London ''[[Evening Standard]]'' critic, Ben Lewis, applied the term to three [[Turner Prize]] nominees and saw them amongst a movement which was reviving the formalism of the early 20th century; he advocated values of an aesthetic informed by modesty, generosity and genuine emotion.&lt;ref name=lewis-turner/&gt;

==History==
[[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]] and [[Billy Childish]], the founders of the [[stuckism]] art movement, inaugurated the period of remodernism.&lt;ref name=packer&gt;Packer, William. "Childish artists coming unstuck", p.13, and "Young pretenders of art have much to learn", p. 20, ''[[Financial Times]]'', March 13, 2001. The text from different editions is the same: "Childish and his co-founder, Charles Thomson, ushered in remodernism, 'a period of art . . . to reclaim the vision and spiritual values of the early Modernists and replace the ennui of Post-Modernism'."&lt;/ref&gt; Their ''Remodernism'' manifesto was published on March 1, 2000 to promote vision, authenticity and self-expression, with an emphasis on painting, and subtitled "towards a new spirituality in art." Its premise is that the potential of the [[Modernism|modernist]] vision has not been fulfilled, that its development has been in the wrong direction and that this vision needs to be reclaimed, redefined and redeveloped. It advocates the search for truth, knowledge and meaning, and challenges [[formalism (art)|formalism]].

|}

It has a short introduction, summing up: "Modernism has progressively lost its way, until finally toppling into the bottomless pit of Postmodern balderdash." This is followed by 14 numbered points, stressing bravery, individuality, inclusiveness, communication, humanity and the perennial against nihilism, scientific materialism and the "brainless destruction of convention." Point 7 states:
{{quote|Spirituality is the journey of the soul on earth. Its first principle is a declaration of intent to face the truth. Truth is what it is, regardless of what we want it to be. Being a spiritual artist means addressing unflinchingly our projections, good and bad, the attractive and the grotesque, our strengths as well as our delusions, in order to know ourselves and thereby our true relationship with others and our connection to the divine.}}
Point 9 states: "Spiritual art is not religion. Spirituality is humanity's quest to understand itself and finds its symbology through the clarity and integrity of its artists." Point 12 links its use of the word "God" to enthusiasm&amp;mdash;from the Greek root ''en theos'' (to be possessed by God).

The summary at the end starts, "It is quite clear to anyone of an uncluttered mental disposition that what is now put forward, quite seriously, as art by the ruling elite, is proof that a seemingly rational development of a body of ideas has gone seriously awry," and finds the solution is a spiritual renaissance because "there is nowhere else for art to go. Stuckism's mandate is to initiate that spiritual renaissance now."&lt;ref&gt;Childish, Billy, and Thomson, Charles. [http://www.stuckism.com/remod.html "Remodernism"], stuckism.com, March 1, 2000.

In April, remodernism was quoted in ''The Gulf News'' ([[UAE]]).&lt;ref&gt;Lethbridge, Lucy (2000)[&lt;!--http://www.gulf-news.co.ae/18042000/FRIDAY/fri6.htm DEAD LINK REPLACED WITH INTERNET ARCHIVE CACHE --&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20010222155937/http://www.gulf-news.co.ae/18042000/FRIDAY/fri6.htm "Letter from London"] ''The Gulf News'', May 14, 2000.

I like the idea of filmmakers teaching themselves to paint pictures, to try acting in their own movies and those of others (especially if they are shy), to be nude models for other artists, to meditate, worship if they are religious, to do things that affect their levels of consciousness, try things that make them nervous or uncomfortable, to go out and be involved in life, to find adventure, to jump in the ocean.

In 1956, [[Anthony F. C. Wallace]] published a paper called '''"Revitalization Movements"''' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sjsu.edu/people/mira.amiras/courses/c10/s2/AFC_Wallace_RevitalizationMvt.pdf   Wallace, Anthony F.C. 1956. "Revitalization Movements," ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' 58: 264-281.]&lt;/ref&gt; to describe how [[culture]]s change themselves.   A revitalization movement is a "deliberate, organized, conscious effort by members of a society to construct a more satisfying culture" (p.&amp;nbsp;265), and Wallace describes at length the processes by which a revitalization movement takes place.

Wallace' model 1956 describes the process of a '''revitalization movement'''. It is derived from studies of a Native American religious movement, The Code of [[Handsome Lake]], which may have led to the formation of the [[Longhouse Religion]]. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{Plainlist|
*I. ''Period of generally satisfactory adaptation'' to a group's social and natural environment.
*II. ''Period of increased individual stress''. While the group as a whole is able to survive through its accustomed  cultural behavior, changes in the social or natural environment frustrate efforts of many people to obtain normal satisfactions of their needs.
*III. ''Period of cultural distortion''. Changes in the group's social or natural environment drastically reduce the capacity of accustomed cultural behavior to satisfy most persons' physical and emotional needs.
*IV. ''Period of revitalization'': (1) reformulation of the cultural pattern; (2) its communication; (3) organization of a reformulated cultural pattern; (4) adaptation of the reformulated pattern to better meet the needs and preferences of the group; (5) cultural transformation; (6) routinization, when the adapted reformulated cultural pattern becomes the standard cultural behavior for the group.
*V. ''New period of generally satisfactory adaptation'' to the group's changed social and/or natural environment.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}
}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wallace derived his theory from studies of so-called primitive peoples (preliterate and homogeneous), with particular attention to the [[Iroquois]] revitalization movement led by [[Seneca nation|Seneca]] religious leader and [[prophet]] [[Handsome Lake]] (1735-1815). Wallace believed that his revitalization model applies to movements as broad and complex as the rise of [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], or [[Wesleyanism|Wesleyan Methodism]].

Revitalizaton is a part of social movements.

Scholars such as Vittorio Lanternari (1963) and Peter Worsley (1968) have developed and adapted Wallace's insights.

'''Sexual inversion''' is a term used by [[sexologist]]s, primarily in the late 19th and early 20th century, to refer to [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Havelock Ellis]]'s definition was "sexual instinct turned by inborn constitutional abnormality toward persons of the same sex".  Ellis, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13611/13611-h/13611-h.htm#2_Page_1 1].&lt;/ref&gt;  Sexual inversion was believed to be an inborn reversal of [[gender]] traits:  male inverts were, to a greater or lesser degree, inclined to traditionally female pursuits and dress and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Doan, 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  The sexologist [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] described female sexual inversion as "the masculine soul, heaving in the female bosom".&lt;ref name="Taylor-288"&gt;Taylor, 288–289.&lt;/ref&gt;  In its emphasis on [[gender role]] reversal, the theory of sexual inversion resembles [[transgender]], which did not yet exist as a separate concept at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Prosser, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially confined to medical texts, the concept of sexual inversion was given wide currency by [[Radclyffe Hall]]'s 1928 [[lesbian fiction|lesbian novel]] ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]'', which was written in part to popularize the sexologists' views.  Published with a foreword by the sexologist [[Havelock Ellis]], it consistently used the term "invert" to refer to its protagonist, who bore a strong resemblance to one of Krafft-Ebing's case studies.&lt;ref&gt;Prosser, 133; Taylor, 288–290.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
According to this theory, [[gay men]] and [[lesbian]]s were sexual "inverts", people who appeared physically male or female on the outside, but felt internally that they were of the "opposite" [[anatomical sex]] (according to the [[gender binary|binary view of gender]]). Therefore, same-gender desires and attraction were explained as "latent heterosexuality", and bisexual desire was known as ''psychosexual hermaphroditism'' – in other words, gay men and lesbians were really just [[heterosexual]]s who were "born in the wrong body", and "[[bisexual]]s" were what modern-day sexologists would call [[intersexual]]s (formerly ''[[hermaphrodite]]s'') by this theory (the bisexual person's "male" part supposedly has attractions towards females, and the "female" part have attractions towards males).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eisner|first1=Shiri|title=Bi: Notes for a Bisexual Revolution|date=2 Jul 2013|publisher=Seal Press|isbn=9781580054751|pages=8-9|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CbJaZIosLwQC&amp;pg=PT8|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory fails to explain though the attraction of a "male" part towards males.

'''Sonia M. Altizer''' (born 1970) is a Professor and Associate Dean of Academic Affairs and the Athletic Association Professor of [[Ecology]] in the [[University of Georgia]], [[Odum School of Ecology]].&lt;ref name=uga&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecology.uga.edu/facultyMember.php?Altizer-1/|title=Odum School of Ecology|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ocone /&gt;

==Early life==
Altizer was born as the daughter of Jim and Chris Altizer of [[Watkinsville, Georgia]].&lt;ref name=ocone&gt;{{cite news|title=Sonia Altizer named UGA Athletic Association Professor in Ecology|url=http://www.oconeeenterprise.com/news/article_abb49ae0-4efe-11e4-b97e-c375eeb85f2b.html|accessdate=1 March 2015|agency=The Ocone Enterprise|publisher=The Ocone Enterprise|date=October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her passion for [[biology]] and the natural world began when she received a gift of a [[microscope]] and a grown-your-own-butterflies kit on her twelfth birthday.&lt;ref name=tedxuga&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tedxuga.com/sonia-altizer/|accessdate=28 February 2015|title=Ted x UGA|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150228001609/http://tedxuga.com/sonia-altizer/|archivedate=28 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Altizer received a B.S. from [[Duke University]] in 1992 and a [[Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Minnesota]] and in 1998. She also did a postdoctoral work at [[Princeton University]] and [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref name=uga /&gt;

==Career==
For 20 years since a graduate student of the University of Minnesota, Altizer traveled the world to study [[monarch butterfly]] migration, ecology, and interactions with a [[protozoan]] [[parasite]]. She has researched how [[seasonal]] [[Lepidoptera migration|migration]] of these butterflies affects parasite transmission, and also developed collaborative databases of mammalian infectious diseases, on host behavior, ecology, and life history interact with global-scale patterns of [[parasitism]]. She also focused her research on songbird-pathogen dynamics, including studies of house finch [[conjunctivitis]], [[West Nile virus]], and [[salmonellosis]]. Altizer has published several publications and she recently co-edited a book that would be published in 2015, titled Monarchs in a Changing World: Biology and Conservation of an Iconic Insect. She also and participated in high-level task forces dedicated to monarch butterfly conservation. A citizen science project called Monarch Health is run by her students at University of Georgia, which is now the 8th year. There are hundreds of volunteers across [[North America]] in sampling wild monarchs for a debiliating disease.&lt;ref name=tedxuga /&gt;

==Research areas==
Altizer's research interests are ecology of [[infectious diseases]] in natural populations, evolution of host resistance and [[parasite virulence]], insect ecology and [[evolution]], [[animal migration]]s, and [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] change and infectious disease dynamics.&lt;ref name=ucdavis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entomology.ucdavis.edu/News/Sonia_Altizer__Migratory_Immunity__Parasite_Infection,_Host_Defense_and_Fitness_Costs_in_Monarch_Butterflies/|title=UC Davis Sonia Altizer|accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
When Altizer is not on campus or traveling for work, she rides on her horse in rural Watkinsville with her husband, with whom she has one son.&lt;ref name=tedxuga /&gt;

A tactical decision game is a [[decision game]] that puts students in the role of the commander of a tactical unit who is faced with a challenging problem.  While most tactical decision games depict problems faced by the commanders of military units, &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The tactical decision game is known by a variety of names.  These include ''map problem'', ''tactical problem'', ''one-step [[Military simulation|war game]]'', and ''tactical decision exercise''.

Like other types of decision games, tactical decision games may either be historical or fictional.  If the scenario is based entirely upon a reliable historical narrative, a tactical decision game is also a ''decision-forcing case''.  (Such an exercise may also be called an ''historical map problem''.)  However, if any of the elements in the scenario of a tactical decision game is fictional, then the exercise is a kind of ''fictional decision game''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Tactical Decision Games Before 1800==

In Chapter 14 of ''[[The Prince]]'', [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] tells the story of the Greek general [[Philopoemon]], who made extensive use of tactical decision games.

&lt;blockquote&gt;“Philopoemon, Prince of the Achaeans, among other praises which writers have bestowed on him, is commended because in time of peace he never had anything in his mind but the rules of war; and when he was in the country with friends, he often stopped and reasoned with them: “If the enemy should be upon that hill, and we should find ourselves here with our army, with whom would be the advantage? How should one best advance to meet him, keeping the ranks? If we should wish to re-treat, how ought we to set about it? If they should retreat, how ought we to pursue?” And he would set forth to them, as he went, all the chances that could befall an army; he would listen to their opinion and state his, confirming it with reasons, so that by these continual discussions there could never arise, in time of war, any unexpected circumstances that he could deal with.”

==Tactical Decision Games in Prussia and Germany==

[[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder|Helmuth von Moltke]], who served as chief of the [[Prussian General Staff]] from 1857 to 1888, made extensive use of tactical decision games to train his subordinates and inform contingency planning.  Called "tactical assignments" (''taktische Aufgaben''), these problems employed fictional scenarios in which ideal units were employed on actual terrain.  Some of these games were gathered into a book, ''Moltkes taktische Aufgaben aus den Jahren 1858 bis 1882'', which was published in 1892 as the second volume of a multi-volume set of Moltke's collected works.  Two years later, an English translation of this book came out under the title ''Moltke's Tactical Problems from 1858 to 1882''.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

| url=https://archive.org/details/moltkestactical00armegoog 
| postscript= .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In sharp contrast to Moltke's tactical decision games, which had no direct connection to actual engagements, those published by [[Julius von Verdy du Vernois]] often made explicit use of real-world events.  The problems contained in the first volume of Verdy's ''Kriegsgeschichtliche Studien nach der applikatorischen Methode'' (''Military Historical Studies by means of the Applicatory Method'') were all based on incidents of the battle that took place between Austrian and Italian forces on 24 June 1866. However, in an attempt to make the games more useful to German officers, he replaced the actual (Austrian and Italian) formations engaged in the battle with an imaginary German infantry division, thereby converting what would have been decision-forcing cases into fictional decision games.  (Originally published in 1876, this work was later translated into English as ''A Tactical Study Based on the Battle of [[Battle of Custoza (1866)|Custozza]]''.)

In his earlier (and more famous) work, the four volume ''Studien über Truppen-Führung''), Verdy also used historical events as the starting point for his games.  However, in addition to fictionalizing orders of battle, he also changed the outcomes of particular engagements.  (The word [[Truppenführung | ''Truppen-Führung'']], which is often translated as "troop leading" or "the leading of troops",  refers to the art of handling of combined arms formations:  infantry divisions, cavalry divisions, and army corps.)

==Tactical Decision Games in the United States Armed Forces==

In 1975, the Simulation Center of the [[9th Infantry Division (United States) | 9th Infantry Division]] of the [[United States Army]] published a training package for junior leaders called ''What Now, Lieutenant?''.  Designed to be used in conjunction with a war game of the same name, this package consisted of scenarios that described situations faced by the commanders of battalions, companies, and platoons.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
| last= United States Army, 9th Infantry Division 
| year=1975 
| title=What Now, Lieutenant?
| publisher=9th Infantry Division, Fort Lewis, Washington   
| postscript= .}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1982, the [[United States Marine Corps Training and Education Command |Education Center]] of the United States [[Marine Corps Combat Development Command|Marine Corps Development and Education Command]] used this package as the starting point for a series of three "instructional pamphlets": ''Tactical Problems for Battalion Commanders'', ''Tactical Problems for Platoon Leaders/Company Commanders'', and ''Tactical Problems for Squad Leaders''.  In addition to twelve problems taken from ''What Now, Lieutenant?'', the ''Tactical Problems ...'' series contained sixteen games that were written expressly for the series by Chief Warrant Officer Bryan N. Lavender, USMC.

Like the scenarios in ''What Now, Lieutenant?'', the games in the ''Tactical Problems ...'' series were based them on descriptions of actual engagements that took place between 1914 and 1953.  Some of these were first-hand accounts written by [[S.L.A. Marshall]], [[Erwin Rommel]],and [[Friedrich von Mellenthin]].  Others were secondary works composed by military historians.) Regardless of the actual events that inspired them, all of the problems were modified to reflect the organization and equipment of the 1980s.  Thus, none of these historically-inspired games can be classified as [[case method | decision-forcing cases]].)

The article received a humorous positive review which was published alongside the article.&lt;ref name=realclearscience/&gt;

{{cquote|I have studied this manuscript very carefully with lemon juice and X-rays and have not detected a single flaw in either design or writing style. I suggest it be published without revision. Clearly it is the most concise manuscript I have ever seen-yet it contains sufficient detail to allow other investigators to replicate Dr. Upper's failure. In comparison with the other manuscripts I get from you containing all that complicated detail, this one was a pleasure to examine. Surely we can find a place for this paper in the Journal-perhaps on the edge of a blank page.}}

'''[[Timeline]] of [[neutron star]]s, [[pulsar]]s, [[supernova]]e, and [[white dwarf]]s'''

Note that this list is mainly about the development of knowledge, but also about some supernovae taking place. For a separate list of the latter, see the article [[List of supernovae]]. All dates refer to when the supernova was observed on Earth or would have been observed on Earth had powerful enough telescopes existed at the time.

[[File:Cartuja1.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The Valldemossa Charterhouse]] 
[[File:Cartuja kartäuserkloster2.JPG|thumb|Tower]]
The '''Valldemossa Charterhouse''' (Catalan: ''Cartoixa de Valldemossa'', Spanish: ''Cartuja de Valldemosa''), translatable as: Carthusian Monastery of Valldemossa) is a palace in [[Valldemossa]], [[Majorca]] that was residence of the king [[Sancho of Majorca]] former royal residence and Royal [[Charterhouse (monastery)|Charterhouse]] (15th century).

== History ==
The origin of the complex dates back to the time of King [[James II of Majorca]], who chose this exceptional place in the [[Sierra de Tramuntana]], located more than 400 meters high, to build a palace for his son Sancho, known as the "Palace of the King Sancho". In the year 1399 [[Martin of Aragon]] yielded all the royal possessions of Valldemossa to the [[Carthusian]] friars. These founded the Charterhouse and inhabited it until 1835, when it happened to private hands by the [[Spanish confiscation|Ecclesiastical confiscations of Mendizábal]].

The church, a neoclassical building decorated by great artists and craftsmen of the time, began to be built in 1751 on the primitive church erected in 1446. The complex has a cloister -one of the oldest parts of the current buildings-, the old pharmacy of the Carthusians, garden and the rooms of the Prioral Cell-chapel, former library, audience room, bedroom ...- where the historical and artistic legacy of the Carthusians is preserved, showing how the monks lived. In the cells there are the documents and memories of the stay of the musician [[Frédéric Chopin]] and the writer [[George Sand]] the winter of the years 1838-1839. In the cell 4 Chopin composed his '' [[Preludes (Chopin)|Preludes Op. 28]]'' and Sand wrote ''[[A Winter in Majorca]]''.

The '''Waterfront Historic Area LeaguE''', also known as '''WHALE''', is a non-profit [[historic preservation]] organization located in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]].  Its mission is: "to promote the value and reuse of greater New Bedford's historic structures through preservation, education and advocacy".&lt;ref name="waterfrontleague.org"&gt;WHALE - Waterfront Historic Area League. 26 May 2009 &lt;http://www.waterfrontleague.org&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization often promotes its cause with the words of one of its founders, Sarah Delano (President of WHALE, 1966-1982).  Delano said, "if you bulldoze your heritage, you become just anywhere".&lt;ref name="McCabe, Marsha 1995"&gt;McCabe, Marsha, and Joseph D. Thomas. Not Just Anywhere. New Bedford, MA: Spinner Publications, Inc., 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

                                                                  
== History ==

The organization was founded by a group of concerned citizens in 1962, at a time when urban renewal threatened much of the city's history and architectural heritage.  The original focus was on the city's waterfront district, a dense area of [[whaling]] era buildings suffering from severe neglect and disrepair.&lt;ref name="McCabe, Marsha 1995" /&gt;  WHALE took on the preservation/restoration of as many as 20 buildings within the district's boundaries over the years.  This became the organization's first neighborhood revitalization project and lead to the establishment of Bedford Landing Waterfront National Register [[Historic District]].  With WHALE's leadership, the district would later be designated, [[New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park]].&lt;ref name="waterfrontleague.org"/&gt;  Over time, WHALE expanded to properties beyond this district, taking on preservation projects throughout the city.  WHALE has now completed over 45 preservation and restoration projects in the greater New Bedford area between 1962 and 2009.&lt;ref name="waterfrontleague.org"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19318">[[File:Pieter Bruegel der Ältere - Landschaft mit der Flucht nach Ägypten.jpg|thumb|upright=2|[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], ''[[Landscape with the Flight into Egypt (Bruegel)|Landscape with the Flight into Egypt]]'', 1563, 37.1 × 55.6 cm (14.6 × 21.9 in)]]

The '''world landscape''', a translation of the German '''''Weltlandschaft''''', is a type of composition in Western painting showing an imaginary panoramic landscape seen from an elevated viewpoint that includes mountains and lowlands, water, and buildings.  The subject of each painting is usually a Biblical or historical narrative, but the figures comprising this narrative element are dwarfed by their surroundings.

The world landscape first appeared in painting in the work of the [[Early Netherlandish painter]] [[Joachim Patinir]] (c. 1480–1524), most of whose few surviving paintings are of this type, usually showing religious subjects, but commissioned by secular patrons. "They were imaginary compilations of the most appealing and spectacular aspects of European geography, assembled for the delight of the wealthy armchair traveler",&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Ann Sutherland, ''Seventeenth-century Art and Architecture'', 378, 2005, Laurence King Publishing, {{ISBN|1856694151}}, 9781856694155, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Xd0CuzsPYJcC&amp;pg=PA378 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; giving "an idealized composite of the world taken in at a single Olympian glance".&lt;ref&gt;Schama, 431&lt;/ref&gt;

The compositional type was taken up by a number of other Netherlandish artists, most famously [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]. There was a parallel development by Patinir's contemporary [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] and other artists of the [[Danube school]].  Although compositions of this broad type continued to be common until the 18th century and beyond, the term is usually only used to describe works from the [[Low Countries]] and Germany produced in the 16th century.  The German term ''Weltlandschaft'' was first used by Eberhard Freiherr von Bodenhausen in 1905 with reference to [[Gerard David]],&lt;ref&gt;In his monograph on Gerard David and his School (Munich, F. Bruckmann), Weemans, 263&lt;/ref&gt; and then in 1918 applied to Patinir's work by [[Ludwig von Baldass]], defined as the depiction of "all that which seemed beautiful to the eye; the sea and the earth, mountains and plains, forests and fields, the castle and the hut".&lt;ref&gt;Weemans, 263, quoting von Baldass&lt;/ref&gt;

==Netherlands==
[[File:Patinir rocks (Bayard, Chandelle).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Rocks at [[Dinant]] and in a Patinir detail]]

The treatment of landscape backgrounds in [[Early Netherlandish painting]] was greatly admired in Italy, and Flemish specialists were employed in some Italian workshops, including that of [[Titian]].  The backgrounds to many of [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s early prints were appropriated by a number of Italian artists. Patinir, "emboldened by the Italian taste for Northern rusticity, began as early as the 1510s to expand the backgrounds of his paintings out of all proportion" in a way that "violently reversed the ordinary hierarchy of subject and setting".&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 42–45, 43 and 45 quoted in turn&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1520 he was well known for these subjects, and when Dürer visited him in [[Antwerp]] he described him in his diary as "the good painter of landscapes" (''gut landschaftsmaler'') in the first use of ''Landschaft'' in an artistic context.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, 138; Wood, 45 (dating the visit to 1521)&lt;/ref&gt;

The paintings are relatively small and use a horizontal format; this was to become so standard for landscapes in art that it is now called "landscape" format in ordinary contexts, but at the time it was a considerable novelty, as "portable panel paintings were almost always vertical in format before 1520" and "Patinir's landscapes were among the first small horizontal panels of any sort".&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 47, quoted&lt;/ref&gt; He typically uses three base colours to articulate his compositions, with a brownish foreground, a blue-green middle zone, and blues in the distance.  The horizon-line is relatively high on the picture plane.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, 139; Jenson, 280&lt;/ref&gt;  Patinir (and [[Herri met de Bles]]) came from [[Dinant]] on the [[Meuse]] (in modern [[Belgium]]) where, in "a startlingly un-Netherlandish landscape", there are dramatic rock cliffs and free-standing crags along the river. These are frequently recalled in his paintings, and came to form a common feature of works by other artists.  [[Image:Crossing the River Styx.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''[[Landscape with Charon Crossing the Styx]]'', [[Joachim Patinir]], c. 1515–1524, Prado]]
With other vertical features, these are painted as though seen straight on even when in the lower parts of the landscape, and thus "reassert the integrity of the picture plane" in his works, against the sprawling horizontal impetus of the main landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 410; Harbison, 139, quoted ("reassert"); Silver, 30; Schama, 416–417, 416 quoted ("startlingly un-Netherlandish")&lt;/ref&gt;  Both [[Kenneth Clark]] and [[Simon Schama]] see these as "the last survivors of the landscape of symbols", relating them to medieval and even earlier "corkscrew" representations of mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 25–27, 27 quoted; Schama, 415–417&lt;/ref&gt;

The style is related to the landscape backgrounds of [[Hieronymous Bosch]], although in his main works these function as a backdrop to his crowds of figures and are not as concerned to include a variety of landscape elements; but those of smaller works such as his ''[[St. Jerome at Prayer (Bosch)|St. Jerome at Prayer]]'' anticipate the new style.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, 27&lt;/ref&gt; In most respects the paintings retain the same elements as many 15th-century treatments of the same subjects but show, in modern cinematic terms, a [[long shot]] rather than a [[medium shot]].

Most art historians regard the figure subject as continuing to be important in the works of Patinir and his followers, rather than mere [[staffage]] for a landscape, and most are of subjects where a wide landscape had relevance.  Among the most popular were the [[Flight to Egypt]], and the Netherlandish 15th-century innovation of the ''Rest on the Flight to Egypt'', and subjects showing hermits such as Saints [[Jerome]] and [[Anthony the Great|Anthony]] with the world from which they had withdrawn laid out beneath them.  As well as connecting the style to the [[Age of Discovery]], the role of [[Antwerp]] as a booming centre both of world trade and [[cartography]], and the wealthy town-dweller's view of the countryside, art historians have explored the paintings as religious metaphors for the pilgrimage of life.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, 26–36; Wood, 274–275&lt;/ref&gt;    
[[File:Cornelis massys-huida egipto-prado.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|''Rest on the Flight into Egypt'', [[Cornelis Massys]], c. 1540]]

The style is also an early example of the 16th-century artistic trend to "Mannerist inversion" (the term devised by [[Max Dvořák]]) or the "inverted composition", where previously minor or background elements come to dominate the picture space. In the 1550s [[Pieter Aertsen]] began a style of large canvasses dominated by great spreads of food [[still life]] and large [[genre art|genre figures]] of cooks or market-sellers, while in the background small biblical scenes can be glimpsed. Some paintings by [[Jan Sanders van Hemessen]] place genre figures in the foreground of paintings on religious or moral subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, 152–153; Falkenberg, throughout&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century all these subject areas became established as independent genres in Dutch and Flemish painting, and later throughout Western painting.

Patinir's invention was developed by [[Herri met de Bles]] (1510 – c.1555–1560), who was probably his nephew. He took the type into the new style of [[Northern Mannerism]].&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 432, 441–2&lt;/ref&gt;  Other artists were [[Lucas Gassel]], the [[Brunswick Monogrammist]], and [[Cornelis Massys]].&lt;ref&gt;Silver, 35–39; Baldwin, 362&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Pieter Bruegel de Oude - De val van Icarus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''[[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus]]'', [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]], now seen as a good early copy of Bruegel's original]]

Massys was the son of [[Quentin Massys]], a friend of Patinir, who had added the figures to at least one Patinir landscape, the ''Temptation of St Anthony'' ([[Prado]]),&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 45; Snyder, 409&lt;/ref&gt; and who had used the style in some of his own works, such as a ''Madonna and Child'' (1513) in [[Poznań]]. Patinir increasingly left the larger figures in his works to other masters, and also seems to have had a large workshop or circle of followers in Antwerp.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 410; Silver, 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;

The style was adopted and made more natural in the landscapes of [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]], who had travelled to Italy via the Alps.  Back in Antwerp he was commissioned in the 1550s by the publisher [[Hieronymus Cock]] to make drawings for a series of [[engraving]]s, the ''Large Landscapes'', to meet what was now a growing demand for landscape images.  Some of his earlier paintings, such as his ''[[Landscape with the Flight into Egypt (Bruegel)|Landscape with the Flight into Egypt]]'' ([[Courtauld Institute of Art|Courtauld]], 1563, illustrated at top), are fully within the Patinir conventions, but his ''[[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus]]'' (known from two copies) had a Patinir-style landscape, but already the largest figure was a [[genre painting|genre figure]] and not part of the supposed narrative subject.

Other works explored variations on the theme, with his famous set of landscapes with genre figures depicting the seasons being the culmination of his style; the five surviving paintings use the basic elements of the world landscape (only one lacks craggy mountains) but transform them into his own style.  They are larger than most previous works, with a [[genre scene]] with several figures in the foreground, and the panoramic view seen past or through trees.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, 39–52; Snyder, 502–510; Harbison, 140–142; Schama, 431–433&lt;/ref&gt;  Bruegel was also aware of the Danube landscape style through [[old master print|prints]].&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Chapter 5, especially 275–278&lt;/ref&gt;

==Danube school==
[[Image:Albrecht Altdorfer, The Battle of Alexander at Issus.jpg|thumb|[[Albrecht Altdorfer]], ''[[The Battle of Alexander at Issus]]'', 1529, 158.4 cm × 120.3 cm (62.4 in × 47.4 in)]]

The [[Danube school]] was a contemporary group of German and [[Austria]]n artists who were also pioneers of landscape painting, and the first to regularly paint pure landscapes without figures.  Their landscapes revel in the forests of the Upper Danube, and the place of a foreground figure is often taken by a single tree, a formula invented by [[Albrecht Altdorfer]], the most significant artist of the group, and used, mostly in drawings and prints, by [[Wolf Huber]] and [[Augustin Hirschvogel]]. Other innovative works showed close-up views of dense forest with hardly any distant view or even sky.  But many of their landscapes are panoramic in a version of the Netherlandish style, although the river winding out of sight normally replaces the sea that occupies the horizon of many Netherlandish works.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, throughout, especially 160–168; Snyder, 357–359, 362–364; Harbison, 142–143&lt;/ref&gt;  It is probable that at least Altdorfer had seen a Patinir by about 1531; one was in [[Augsburg]] from 1517 (an ''Assumption'' now in [[Philadelphia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 267&lt;/ref&gt;

Altdorfer's painted landscapes are usually vertical,&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 49&lt;/ref&gt; and, if only because it was commissioned for a vertical space, this is the case for the most extreme of all large world landscapes, his ''[[The Battle of Alexander at Issus]]'' (1529, Munich). This extraordinary painting shows a view right across the [[Mediterranean]], with a mass of tiny figures fighting a great battle in the foreground. They are in modern [[Turkey]], and the view extends beyond the island of [[Cyprus]] to the coast of [[Egypt]] and the [[Sinai peninsula]] and the [[Red Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 22–23, 201–202, 266–267; Snyder, 362–363; Harbison,&lt;/ref&gt; The painting originally formed one part of a set of historical paintings in the same format.

==Influence on later landscape painting==
Both the Netherlandish and Danubian approaches to landscape painting were greatly influential for later artists.&lt;ref&gt;On Danubian influence: Wood, 165–171, 234–235, 267–275&lt;/ref&gt; Later generations of Flemish artists such as [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]], [[Anton Mirou]], [[Lucas van Valkenborch]] and [[Gillis van Coninxloo]] continued to produce late Mannerist versions of the full formula, as developed by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, before in the 1590s van Coninxloo let the trees move in like curtains from the sides to restrict and then eliminate a distant view, pioneering the Flemish development of the dense forest views of the Danube school.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 175–176, 179–180&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rubens]] had studied in the 1590s with his relative [[Tobias Verhaecht]], an especially conservative artist who continued to use world landscape styles derived from Pieter Bruegel the Elder until the 1620s.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 182–183&lt;/ref&gt;  Though [[Rubens]] rapidly outgrew his influence, in some of his later landscapes, such as the ''Summer, Peasants going to Market'' (c. 1618, [[Royal Collection]]), "the tradition of the old 'world landscape' plainly lives on".&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 189–192, 191 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Peasants going to market PP Rubens.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|''Summer, Peasants going to Market'', [[Peter Paul Rubens]], c. 1618]]

Aspects of the particular formula of the world landscape, though no longer usually described by that term, continue to reappear in different versions until the 19th century.  In [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] the idiosyncratic paintings and prints of [[Hercules Seghers]] (c. 1589 – c. 1638), as rare as Patinirs, were great panoramic views, very often with mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Silvers, 162–163&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[Philips Koninck]] (1619–1688) used the panoramic elevated view, and often included water, but showed vistas of flat farmland or town roofs with a low horizon.

The Italian [[Niccolò dell'Abbate]], part of the [[School of Fontainebleau]], introduced the Flemish world landscape into French art in works such as the ''[[Orpheus]] and [[Euridice]]'' in the [[National Gallery, London]] and the ''Rape of [[Proserpina|Prosperine]]'' in [[the Louvre]], both large paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Blunt|Blunt, Anthony]], ''Art and Architecture in France, 1500–1700'', p. 61, 2nd edn 1957, Penguin&lt;/ref&gt;  In French Baroque or classical painting many artists including both [[Claude Lorrain]] and [[Nicolas Poussin]] painted "Landscape with ..." subjects, and for Claude wide panoramic views with mixed elements of mountains, water and small figures formed the bulk of his work, although both the viewpoint and horizon are generally much lower than in 16th-century works. Claude in turn became enormously influential, and until the early 19th century his style continued to have the advantage of giving a painting of a "landscape with" a higher place in the [[hierarchy of genres]], and consequently a higher price, than a mere pure landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, 74&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[Romanticism]] this changed, but panoramic views continued to be painted in the 19th century, and artists such as those in the [[Hudson River School]], [[Edward Lear]] and Russian landscape painters took the compositional style to new landscapes around the world in works such as ''[[The Heart of the Andes]]'' (1859, [[Frederic Edwin Church]]), though often excluding all people and buildings. These still featured in the huge apocalyptic religious paintings of the English painter [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]], which are often literally "end of the world landscapes", taking the history of the genre back to its origins with Bosch.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20423">[[X-ray]] emission occurs from many [[Celestial sphere|celestial]] objects. These emissions can have a [[pattern]], occur intermittently, or as a [[transient astronomical event]]. In [[X-ray astronomy]] many sources have been discovered by placing an [[X-ray astronomy detectors|X-ray detector]] above the [[Earth]]'s atmosphere. Often, the first X-ray source discovered in many [[constellation]]s is an '''X-ray transient'''. These objects show changing levels of X-ray emission. [[US Naval Research Laboratory|NRL]] astronomer Dr. Joseph Lazio stated:&lt;ref name=Lazio&gt;{{ cite web |author=Lazio J |title=Astronomers Detect Powerful Bursting Radio Source Discovery Points to New Class of Astronomical Objects |url=http://www.nrao.edu/pr/2005/newsource/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; " ... the sky is known to be full of transient objects emitting at X- and gamma-ray wavelengths, ...". There are a growing number of recurrent X-ray transients. In the sense of traveling as a transient, the only stellar X-ray source that does not belong to a constellation is the [[Sun]]. As seen from Earth, the Sun moves from west to east along the [[ecliptic]], passing over the course of one year through the twelve constellations of the [[Zodiac]], and [[Ophiuchus]].

==Nova or supernova==

Most astronomical X-ray transient sources have simple and consistent time structures; typically a rapid brightening followed by gradual fading, as in a [[nova]] or [[supernova]].

==Transient binary X-ray source==

[[XTE J1650-500]] is a transient binary X-ray source located in the [[constellation]] [[Ara (constellation)|Ara]].

==Soft X-ray transient==

"[[Soft X-ray transient]]s" are composed of some type of compact object (probably a neutron star) and some type of "normal", low mass star (i.e. a star with a mass of some fraction of the Sun's mass). These objects show changing levels of low-energy, or "soft", X-ray emission, probably produced somehow by variable transfer of mass from the normal star to the compact object. In effect the compact object "gobbles up" the normal star, and the X-ray emission can provide the best view of how this process occurs.&lt;ref name=Corcoran&gt;{{ cite web |author=Corcoran MF |title=The Fall of Aquila X-1 |date=October 2001 |url=http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/objects/heapow/archive/compact_objects/sax_aqlx1.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soft X-ray transients Cen X-4 and Apl X-1 were discovered by [[Hakucho]], [[Japan]]'s first [[X-ray astronomy]] [[satellite]].

==X-ray burster==

[[X-ray burster]]s are one class of [[X-ray binary|X-ray binary stars]] exhibiting periodic and rapid increases in [[luminosity]] (typically a factor of 10 or greater) peaked in the [[X-ray]] regime of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. These astrophysical systems are composed of an [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accreting]] [[compact object]], typically a [[neutron star]] or occasionally a [[black hole]], and a companion 'donor' star; the mass of the donor star is used to categorize the system as either a high mass (above 10 [[solar mass]]es) or low mass (less than 1 solar mass) X-ray binary, abbreviated as LMXB and HMXB, respectively. X-ray bursters differ observationally from other X-ray transient sources (such as [[X-ray pulsar]]s and [[soft X-ray transient]]s), showing a sharp rise time (1 – 10 seconds) followed by spectral softening (a property of cooling [[Black body|black bodies]]). Individual bursts are characterized by an integrated flux of 10&lt;sup&gt;39-40&lt;/sup&gt; ergs.&lt;ref name=Lewin&gt;{{ cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00196124 |author=Lewin WHG |author2=van Paradijs J |author3=Taam RE | title=X-Ray Bursts |journal=Space Sci Rev |volume=62 |issue=3–4 |pages=223–389 |date=1993 |bibcode=1993SSRv...62..223L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gamma-ray burster==

A [[gamma-ray burst]] (GRB) is a highly [[luminosity|luminous]] flash of [[gamma ray]]s — the most energetic form of [[electromagnetic radiation]]. [[GRB 970228]] was a GRB detected on Feb 28 1997 at 02:58 [[UTC]]. Prior to this event, GRBs had only been observed at gamma wavelengths. For several years physicists had expected these bursts to be followed by a longer-lived [[Afterglow (gamma-ray burst)|afterglow]] at longer wavelengths, such as [[radio waves]], [[x-rays]], and even [[visible light]]. This was the first burst for which such an afterglow was observed.&lt;ref name=Schilling&gt;{{ cite book |title=Flash! The hunt for the biggest explosions in the universe |author=Schilling, Govert |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |date=2002 |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-80053-6 |page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A transient x-ray source was detected which faded with a [[power law]] slope in the days following the burst. This x-ray [[Afterglow (gamma-ray burst)|afterglow]] was the first GRB afterglow ever detected.&lt;ref name=Costa&gt;{{ cite journal |author=Costa E|display-authors=etal |title=Discovery of an X-ray afterglow associated with the γ-ray burst of 28 February 1997 |journal=Nature |volume=387 |issue=6635 |pages=783–5 |date=1997 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v387/n6635/full/387783a0.html |accessdate=2009-04-02 |doi=10.1038/42885 |arxiv = astro-ph/9706065 |bibcode = 1997Natur.387..783C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transient X-ray pulsars==

For some types of [[X-ray pulsar]]s, the companion star is a [[Be star]] that rotates very rapidly and apparently sheds a disk of gas around its equator. The orbits of the [[neutron star]] with these companions are usually large and very elliptical in shape. When the neutron star passes nearby or through the Be circumstellar disk, it will capture material and temporarily become an X-ray pulsar. The circumstellar disk around the Be star expands and contracts for unknown reasons, so these are transient X-ray pulsars that are observed only intermittently, often with months to years between episodes of observable X-ray pulsation.

[[SAX J1808.4-3658]] is a transient, accreting millisecond [[X-ray pulsar]] that is intermittent. In addition, [[X-ray burster|X-ray burst]] oscillations and quasi-periodic oscillations in addition to coherent X-ray pulsations have been seen from SAX J1808.4-3658, making it a Rosetta stone for interpretation of the timing behavior of [[low-mass X-ray binary|low-mass X-ray binaries]].

==Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs)==

There are a growing number of recurrent X-ray transients, characterized by short outbursts with very fast rise times (~ tens of minutes) and typical durations of a few hours that are associated with OB [[supergiant]]s and hence define a new class of massive X-ray binaries: Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs).&lt;ref name=Negueruela&gt;{{cite journal |author=Negueruela I|author2=Smith DM|author3=Reig P|author4=Chaty S|author5=Torrejon JM |title=Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients: A new class of high mass X-ray binaries unveiled by INTEGRAL |date=2006 |volume=604 |issue=165 |journal=ESA Spec.Publ. |arxiv=astro-ph/0511088 |bibcode = 2006ESASP.604..165N }}&lt;/ref&gt; XTE J1739–302 is one of these. Discovered in 1997, remaining active only one day, with an X-ray spectrum well fitted with a thermal [[bremsstrahlung]] (temperature of ∼20 keV), resembling the spectral properties of accreting pulsars, it was at first classified as a peculiar Be/X-ray transient with an unusually short outburst.&lt;ref name=Sidoli&gt;{{ cite arXiv |author=Sidoli L |title=Transient outburst mechanisms |date=2008 |eprint=0809.3157 |class=astro-ph }}&lt;/ref&gt; A new burst was observed on Apr 8 2008 with [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission|Swift]].&lt;ref name=Sidoli/&gt;

==The Sun as an X-ray transient==

The quiet [[Sun]], although less active than active regions, is awash with [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] processes and [[transient astronomical event|transient]] events (bright points, [[nanoflares]] and jets).&lt;ref name=Aschwanden&gt;{{cite book |author=Aschwanden MJ |title = Physics of the Solar Corona. An Introduction |publisher= Praxis Publishing Ltd. |date=2004 |isbn=3-540-22321-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[coronal mass ejection]] (CME) is an ejected plasma consisting primarily of [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s (in addition to small quantities of heavier elements such as helium, oxygen, and iron), plus the entraining coronal closed [[magnetic field]] regions. Small-scale energetic signatures such as plasma heating (observed as compact soft X-ray brightening) may be indicative of impending CMEs. The soft X-ray sigmoid (an S-shaped intensity of soft X-rays) is an observational manifestation of the connection between coronal structure and CME production.&lt;ref name=Gopalswamy&gt;{{ cite journal |display-authors=5|author=Gopalswamy N|author2=Mikic Z|author3=Maia D|author4=Alexander D|author5=Cremades H|author6=Kaufmann P|author7=Tripathi D|author8=Wang YM |title=The pre-CME Sun |journal=Space Sci Rev |date=2006 |volume=123 |issue=1–3 |pages=303–39 |url=http://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/publications/gopal2006/SSSI.pdf |format=PDF|doi=10.1007/s11214-006-9020-2 |bibcode = 2006SSRv..123..303G }} {{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first detection of a [[Coronal mass ejection]] (CME) as such was made on Dec 1 1971 by R. Tousey of the [[US Naval Research Laboratory]] using the 7th Orbiting Solar Observatory ([[OSO 7]]).&lt;ref name=Howard&gt;{{ cite web |title=R.A.Howard, A Historical Perspective on Coronal Mass Ejections |url=http://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/summerschool/lectures/vourlidas/AV_intro2CMEs/additional%20material/corona_history.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier observations of '''coronal transients''' or even phenomena observed visually during [[solar eclipses]] are now understood as essentially the same thing.

The largest geomagnetic perturbation, resulting presumably from a "prehistoric" CME, coincided with the first-observed [[solar flare]], in 1859. The flare was observed visually by [[Richard Christopher Carrington]] and the [[geomagnetic storm]] was observed with the recording magnetograph at [[Kew Gardens]]. The same instrument recorded a '''crotchet''', an instantaneous perturbation of the Earth's ionosphere by ionizing soft [[X-rays]]. This could not easily be understood at the time because it predated the discovery of X-rays (by [[Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen|Roentgen]]) and the recognition of the [[ionosphere]] (by [[Arthur Edwin Kennelly|Kennelly]] and [[Heaviside]]).

==Transient X-rays from Jupiter==
[[File:Jupiter.Aurora.HST.mod.jpg|thumb|400 px|Image of [[Jupiter]]'s northern aurorae, showing the main auroral oval, the polar emissions, and the spots generated by the interaction with Jupiter's natural satellites]]

Unlike Earth's aurorae, which are transient and only occur at times of heightened solar activity, [[Jupiter]]'s aurorae are permanent, though their intensity varies from day to day. They consist of three main components: the main ovals, which are bright, narrow (&lt; 1000&amp;nbsp;km in width) circular features located at approximately 16° from the magnetic poles;&lt;ref name=Palier/&gt; the satellite auroral spots, which correspond to the footprints of the magnetic field lines connecting their ionospheres with the ionosphere of Jupiter, and transient polar emissions situated within the main ovals.&lt;ref name=Palier&gt;{{cite journal |author=Palier L |title=More about the structure of the high latitude Jovian aurorae |journal=Planet. Space Sci. |volume=49 |issue=10–11 |pages=1159–73 |date=2001 |bibcode=2001P&amp;SS...49.1159P |doi= 10.1016/S0032-0633(01)00023-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bhardwaj&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1029/1998RG000046| last1 = Bhardwaj| first1 = Anil| last2 = Gladstone| first2 = G.

==Detecting X-ray transients==

The X-ray monitor of [[P78-1|Solwind]], designated NRL-608 or XMON, was a collaboration between the [[Naval Research Laboratory]] and [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]. The monitor consisted of 2 collimated argon proportional counters. The instrument bandwidth of 3-10 keV was defined by the detector window absorption (the window was 0.254&amp;nbsp;mm beryllium) and the upper level discriminator. The active gas volume (P-10 mixture) was 2.54&amp;nbsp;cm deep, providing good efficiency up to 10 keV. Counts were recorded in 2 energy channels. Slat collimators defined a FOV of 3° x 30° (FWHM) for each detector; the long axes of the FOVs were perpendicular to each other. The long axes were inclined 45 degrees to the scan direction, allowing localization of transient events to about 1 degree.

The [[Granat#PHEBUS|PHEBUS]] experiment recorded high energy transient events in the range 100&amp;nbsp;keV to 100&amp;nbsp;MeV. It consisted of two independent detectors and their associated [[electronics]]. Each detector consisted of a bismuth germinate (BGO) crystal 78&amp;nbsp;mm in [[diameter]] by 120&amp;nbsp;mm thick, surrounded by a plastic anti-coincidence jacket. The two detectors were arranged on the spacecraft so as to observe 4[[Pi|π]] [[steradian]]s. The burst mode was triggered when the count rate in the 0.1 to 1.5&amp;nbsp;MeV energy range exceeded the background level by 8 σ (standard deviations) in either 0.25 or 1.0 seconds. There were 116 channels over the energy range.&lt;ref name="NASA2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/granat/granat_about.html |title=GRANAT |publisher=NASA HEASARC |accessdate=2007-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on board the [[Granat]] International Astrophysical Observatory were four [[Granat#WATCH|WATCH]] instruments that could localize bright sources in the 6 to 180 keV range to within 0.5° using a Rotation Modulation Collimator. Taken together, the instruments' three fields of view covered approximately 75% of the sky. The energy resolution was 30% [[Full width at half maximum|FWHM]] at 60&amp;nbsp;keV. During quiet periods, count rates in two energy bands (6 to 15 and 15 to 180&amp;nbsp;keV) were accumulated for 4, 8, or 16 seconds, depending on onboard computer memory availability. During a burst or transient event, count rates were accumulated with a [[Temporal resolution|time resolution]] of 1 s per 36 s.&lt;ref name="NASA2007"/&gt;

The [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] (CGRO) carries the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) which detects in the 20 keV to 8 MeV range.

[[Image:WIND.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The WIND satellite is the first of [[NASA]]'s Global Geospace Science (GGS)]]
WIND was launched on Nov 1 1994. At first, the satellite had a lunar swingby orbit around the Earth. With the assistance of the Moon's gravitational field Wind's apogee was kept over the day hemisphere of the Earth and magnetospheric observations were made. Later in the mission, the Wind spacecraft was inserted into a special "halo" orbit in the solar wind upstream from the Earth, about the sunward Sun-Earth equilibrium point (L1). The satellite has a spin period of ~ 20 seconds, with the spin axis normal to the ecliptic. WIND carries the Transient Gamma-Ray Spectrometer (TGRS) which covers the energy range 15 keV - 10 MeV, with an energy resolution of 2.0 keV @ 1.0 MeV (E/delta E = 500).

The third US [[Third Small Astronomy Satellite|Small Astronomy Satellite (SAS-3)]] was launched on May 7, 1975, with 3 major scientific objectives: 1) determine bright X-ray source locations to an accuracy of 15 arcseconds; 2) study selected sources over the energy range 0.1-55 keV; and 3) continuously search the sky for X-ray novae, flares, and other transient phenomena. It was a spinning satellite with pointing capability. SAS 3 was the first to discover X-rays from a highly magnetic WD binary system, AM Her, discovered X-rays from Algol and HZ 43, and surveyed the soft X-ray background (0.1-0.28 kev).

[[Tenma]] was the second Japanese X-ray astronomy satellite launched on Feb 20 1983. Tenma carried [[Goddard Space Flight Center|GSFC]] detectors which had an improved energy resolution (by a factor of 2) compared to proportional counters and performed the first sensitive measurements of the iron spectral region for many astronomical objects. Energy Range: 0.1 keV - 60 keV. Gas Scintillator Proportional Counter: 10 units of 80&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; each, FOV ~ 3deg (FWHM), 2 - 60 keV. Transient Source Monitor: 2 - 10 keV.

[[India]]'s first dedicated [[astronomy]] [[satellite]], scheduled for launch on board the [[PSLV]] in mid 2010,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ptinews.com/pti%5Cptisite.nsf/0/0ABCF4096F0C0BFF652575A000276ADD?OpenDocument PTInews.com]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Astrosat]] will monitor the X-ray sky for new transients, among other scientific focuses.
