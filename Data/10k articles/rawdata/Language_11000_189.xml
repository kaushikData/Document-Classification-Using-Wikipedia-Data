== Background ==

In 2012, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) launched a new programme on the development of adverse outcome pathways. A guidance document describes in detail how AOPs are to be developed, reviewed, agreed and published at the OECD level.&lt;ref name="THE DEVELOPMENT OF AOPs"&gt;{{cite web|title=THE DEVELOPMENT OF AOPs|url=http://www.oecd.org/env/ehs/testing/AOP%20process_10%20June%202013.pdf|website=oecd.org |publisher=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AOP development and reviewing workflow is intended to take place via a web-based IT management tool: the Adverse Outcome Pathway Knowledge Base (AOP-KB)&lt;ref name=AOP-KB&gt;{{cite web|title=Adverse Outcome Pathway Knowledge Base (AOP-KB)|url=https://aopkb.oecd.org/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; which  is currently still under development. It is the wiki-based, user-friendly tool providing open-source interface for collaborative sharing of established AOPs and building new AOPs. 
The AOP-KB gives the scientific community the possibility to enter, share and discuss their AOP-related knowledge at one central point of information.
The AOP-KB allows for building AOPs by entering and then linking information about MIEs, KEs, AOs and ''' Chemical Initiators'''.
Knowing that pathway elements are not necessarily unique to a single AOP, value is added to existing knowledge by facilitating the re-use of MIE, KE and AO information in multiple AOPs, which prevents redundancy and make the collective knowledge about those entities available in all AOPs in which they appear.

The AOP-KB is a combination of individually developed applications, synchronised and orchestrated in a way that gives users the possibility to capture, review, browse and comment on AOPs shared by the AOP stakeholder community.

The AOP-KB project is an [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]  initiative, which is executed as close collaboration between the [[Joint Research Centre]] of [[European Commission]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] and the  [[Engineer Research and Development Center]] of [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] for the purpose of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]'s programme on the development of AOPs &lt;ref name="Adverse Outcome Pathways, Molecular Screening and Toxicogenomics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Adverse Outcome Pathways, Molecular Screening and Toxicogenomics|url=http://www.oecd.org/chemicalsafety/testing/adverse-outcome-pathways-molecular-screening-and-toxicogenomics.htm|publisher=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[theoretical computer science]], '''Arden's rule''', also known as '''Arden's lemma''', is a mathematical statement about a certain form of [[language equation]]s.

==Background==
A [[formal language|(formal) language]] is simply a set of strings. Such sets can be specified by means of some [[language equation]], which in turn is based on operations on languages. Language equations are mathematical statements that resemble numerical equations, but the variables assume values of formal languages rather than numbers. Among the most common operations on two languages ''A'' and ''B'' are the [[set union]] ''A'' ∪ ''B'', and their [[Concatenation#Concatenation_of_sets_of_strings|concatenation]] ''A''⋅''B''. Finally, as an operation taking a single [[operand]], the set ''A''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the [[Kleene star]] of the language ''A''.

==Statement of Arden's rule==
Arden's rule states that the set ''A''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;⋅''B'' is the smallest language that is a solution for ''X'' in the [[linear equation]] ''X'' = ''A''⋅''X'' ∪ ''B'' where ''X'', ''A'', ''B'' are sets of strings. Moreover, if the set ''A'' does not contain the empty word, then this solution is unique. &lt;ref name="Arden's Rule"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O11-Ardensrule.html|title=Arden's Rule|last=Daintith|first=John|year=2004|accessdate=10 March 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100213122543/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O11-Ardensrule.html| archivedate= 13 February 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sutner"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cdm/pdf/KleeneAlg.pdf |title=Algebra of Regular Languages |last=Sutner |first=Klaus |accessdate=15 Feb 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708171054/http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cdm/pdf/KleeneAlg.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aulus Cornelius Celsus''' ({{circa}} 25 BC {{ndash}} {{circa|lk=no}} 50 AD) was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] encyclopaedist, known for his [[Extant literature|extant]] medical work, ''[[De Medicina]]'', which is believed to be the only surviving section of a much larger [[encyclopedia]]. The ''De Medicina'' is a primary source on [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[pharmacy]], [[surgery]] and related fields, and it is one of the best sources concerning medical knowledge in the Roman world. The lost portions of his encyclopedia likely included volumes on agriculture, law, [[rhetoric]], and military arts. He made contributions to the classification of human skin disorders in  [[dermatology]], such as [[Myrmecia (skin)|Myrmecia]], and his name is often occurring in medical terms about the skin, e.g., [[kerion celsi]] and [[area celsi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Aulus Cornelius Celsus - his contributions to Dermatology | author=Rosenthal T | journal=Arch Dermatol | year=1961 | volume=84| issue=4 | pages=613–618 | doi=10.1001/archderm.1961.01580160077013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Nothing is known about the life of Celsus. Even his [[praenomen]] is uncertain; he has been called both Aurelius and Aulus, with the latter being more plausible.&lt;ref&gt;"Traditionally he is called Aurelius, but Aurelius is a clan name, not a praenomen; hence Aulus, a common first name among the Cornelii, has been suggested and has manuscript support." - ''The McGraw-Hill encyclopedia of world biography'', (1973), page 448.&lt;/ref&gt; Some incidental expressions in his ''[[De Medicina]]'' suggest that he lived under the reigns of [[Augustus]] and [[Tiberius]]; which is confirmed by his reference to [[Themison of Laodicea|Themison]] as being recently in his old age.&lt;ref&gt;Celsus, ''De Medicina'', praef.; iii. 4&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known with any certainty where he lived. He has been identified as the possible dedicator of a gravestone in [[Rome]], but it has also been supposed that he lived in [[Gallia Narbonensis|Narbonese Gaul]], because he refers to a species of [[vine]] (''marcum'') which, according to [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]],&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Hist. Nat.'' xiv. 32&lt;/ref&gt; was native to that region.&lt;ref&gt;"He has been identified with the dedicator of a gravestone from Rome. On the other hand, the rare name Cornelius Celsus occurs on a few inscriptions from Tarraco and Narbo. ... In the part of his work on agriculture, Celsus mentioned (Col. 3. 2. 25) a species of vine (''marcum'') which, according to Pliny (Nat. 14. 32), is native to Narbonese Gaul." - D. R. Langslow, (2000), ''Medical Latin in the Roman Empire'', page 43. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; It is doubtful whether he practised medicine himself, and although Celsus seems to describe and recommend his own medical observations sanctioned by experience, [[Quintilian]] says that his volumes included all sorts of literary matters, and even [[agriculture]] and [[military tactics]].&lt;ref&gt;Quintilian, xii. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the numerous volumes of his encyclopedia, only one remains intact, his celebrated treatise ''On Medicine'' (''De Medicina''). "The work’s encyclopedic arrangement follows the tripartite division of medicine at the time as established by [[Hippocrates]] and [[Asclepiades Pharmacion|Asclepiades]] — diet, [[pharmacology]], and [[surgery]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is divided into eight books.

* Book 1 &amp;ndash; The History of Medicine (includes references to eighty medical authors, some of whom are known only through this book&lt;ref name="MagillAves1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Magill|first1=Frank Northen|last2=Aves|first2=Alison|title=Dictionary of World Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wyKaVFZqbdUC|accessdate=25 August 2013|year=1998|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781579580407}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

* Book 3 &amp;ndash; Specific Diseases 
* Book 4 &amp;ndash; Parts of the Body 
* Book 5 and 6 &amp;ndash; Pharmacology 
* Book 7 &amp;ndash; Surgery
* Book 8 &amp;ndash; Orthopedics

In the "Prooemium" or introduction to ''De Medicina'' there is an early discussion of the relevance of theory to medical practice and the pros and cons of both [[animal experimentation]] and [[human experimentation]]. Celsus discusses, for example, the case of [[Herophilos]] and [[Erasistratos]], who he asserts practised [[vivisection]].&lt;ref&gt;Preface, 23-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the treatment of disease, Celsus' principal method was to observe and watch over the operations of [[Nature]], and to regulate rather than oppose them, conceiving that fever consisted essentially in an effort of the body to throw off some morbid cause, and that, if not unduly interfered with, the process would terminate in a state of health. On occasions, however, he boldly recommends the use of the [[scalpel]]; his rules for [[blood letting]] and [[purgative]]s are laid down with detail and precision;&lt;ref&gt;Celsus, ''De Medicina'', ii. 10, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; and many of the rules he prescribes were not very different from those still in use at the beginning of the 19th century. His work contains detailed descriptions of the symptoms and different varieties of [[fever]],&lt;ref&gt;Celsus, ''De Medicina'', iii. 3, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; and he is credited with recording the [[cardinal sign (pathology)|cardinal sign]]s of [[inflammation]] known as "Celsus tetrad": ''calor'' (warmth), ''dolor'' (pain), ''tumor'' (swelling) and ''rubor'' (redness and [[hyperaemia]]). He goes into great detail regarding the preparation of numerous ancient medicinal remedies including the preparation of [[opioid]]s. In addition, he describes many 1st century Roman surgical procedures which included removal of a [[cataract]], treatment for [[Urolithiasis|bladder stones]], and the setting of [[Bone fracture|fractures]].

During the twentieth century, many historians claimed that Celsus believed that the crystalline lens is in the exact center of the eye.  In fact, Celsus made no specific statement about the position of the crystalline lens, and his Graeco-Roman contemporaries did understand that the lens is located to the front.&lt;ref name="Clinical Ophthalmology"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leffler CT, Hadi TM, Udupa A, Schwartz SG, Schwartz D |title=A medieval fallacy: the crystalline lens in the center of the eye |journal=Clinical Ophthalmology |volume=2016 |issue=10 |pages=649–662 |year=2016 |url=https://www.dovepress.com/a-medieval-fallacy-the-crystalline-lens-in-the-center-of-the-eye-peer-reviewed-article-OPTH#}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hippocrates]] used the Greek word ''carcinos'', meaning crab or crayfish, to refer to malignant tumors. It was Celsus who translated the Greek term into the Latin ''cancer'', also meaning crab.

The first printed edition of Celsus' work was published in 1478. His style has been much admired as being equal in purity and elegance to that of the best writers of the Augustan age.

Also, Celsus wrote a technical work on agriculture, on which [[Columella]] partly based his ''[[De Re Rustica]].''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5650">In [[linguistics]], '''balancing''' and '''deranking''' are terms used to describe the form of [[verb]]s used in various types of [[subordinate clause]]s and also sometimes in co-ordinate constructions.

* A verb form is said to be '''balanced''' if it is identical to forms used in independent declarative clauses
* A subordinate verb form is said to be '''deranked''' if it cannot be used in independent declarative clauses

==Deranked verb forms==
Verb forms that occur in subordinate clauses of various languages that cannot occur in independent clauses are of various types, but there do exist some typical patterns that differentiate these forms from main-clause verb forms in the same language.

# There are verb forms that possess the same type of person and [[grammatical tense|tense]] marking as the verb forms used in independent declarative clauses, but differ in [[grammatical mood|mood]]. Typical examples include such forms as [[subjunctive mood|subjunctives]] and [[Irrealis mood|irrealis]] moods. In the [[Eskimo–Aleut languages]], there are special "dependent moods" used only in subordinate clauses.
# There are verb forms that have the same distinctions of person, tense and aspect as are found in main-clause verbs, but which indicate them using special forms distinct from those of main clause verbs.&lt;ref&gt;Croft, William; '''Typology and Universals'''; pp. 216-217. {{ISBN|0-521-00499-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# There are verb forms that do not have the distinctions of person, tense and aspect found in main-clause verbs, such as [[participles]]. These are used for certain types of subordinate clauses in [[English language|English]] like "Being so busy, I couldn't come home."
# There are verb forms that add extra morphemes never found on main clause verbs. Often these are [[adposition]]s or [[grammatical case|case]] suffixes.

==Subordination deranking hierarchy==
Languages that use deranking for their subordinate-clause verb forms do so according to a definite pattern.

There are relatively few languages that use deranked verb forms for ''all'' subordinate clauses (examples are found amongst the [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] and [[Salishan languages]]&lt;ref&gt;Cristofaro, Sonia; Subordination; pp. 298-300. {{ISBN|0-19-928200-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;) but most languages with significant verb inflection use deranking for at least some of their subordinate clauses. Exceptions can be found only amongst certain rigidly [[head-marking language]]s such as [[Ainu language|Ainu]] and [[Lakota language|Lakhota]]. Languages with deranking far down (rightward) on the hierarchy are most typically those with extensive nominal [[grammatical case|case]] systems. This is because in their presence information expressed by person marking on the verb is already expressed on nouns. If relations of core noun phrases are marked only on the verb, it is less uneconomic to express them in a dependent clause.

The distribution of balancing and deranking in languages that do not belong to one of the two polar types briefly discussed in the previous page follows a definite hierarchy. If balancing is used at any point, it is used for all points below it on the following list ("to the right" in traditional wording of the deranking hierarchy)&lt;ref&gt;Croft; '''Typology and Universals'''; p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; Relevant clauses for each example are italicised.

# [[Modal verb|Modals]] and phasals (e.g. "I ''begin to run''")
# Purpose clauses (e.g. "I went into the phone booth ''in order to ring up my friend''")
# Desideratives (e.g. "I ''want to write a letter''") and manipulatives (e.g. "I ''made John fight''")
# Perception (e.g. "I ''see the bus passing''")
# "Before", "when" and "after", plus [[nominative case|nominative]] or [[absolutive case|absolutive]] [[relative clause|relativisation]].
# Reason (e.g. "I cannot leave him alone, ''because he's gone mad''") and reality condition (e.g. "''If capitalism did not cause the Great Depression'', government was responsible"), plus [[accusative case|accusative]] or [[ergative case|ergative]] relativisation.
# Knowledge (e.g. "I ''know that the weather will be very hot''") and propositional attitude (e.g. "I ''think that we should stay at home today''"), plus oblique and indirect object relativisation.
# Utterance (e.g. "He said ''that he was tired''").

===Explanations for the deranking hierarchy===
The commonly accepted explanation for the hierarchy outlined in the previous section is that the types of relation at the top of the deranking hierarchy are much more semantically integrated than those at the bottom. Being semantically integrated means that the events in the main and subordinate clauses are linked, which is true of purpose, perception, "before", "when" and "after" clauses, but not of those further rightward in the hierarchy. This integration leads to the use of verb forms not marked for tense, person or aspect, since they are much simpler than verb forms with these markers. 

Relations that are temporal and imply that the dependent event takes place within a particular time reference relative to the main event favour verb forms that are unmarked for tense or aspect for the same reason. This is why temporal relations like "before", "when" and "after" come above relationships that have no temporal implication of this type like conditionals.

Another factor influencing use of deranking is lack of realisation of the dependent event, which often leads in purpose, desiderative and manipulative clauses to the use of moods that cannot be used in independent clauses.

[[File:Messdeck Accommodation MOD 45154791.jpg|thumb|200px|A berth on a Royal Navy vessel]]
A '''berth''' is a bed or sleeping accommodation on vehicles.  Space accommodations have contributed to certain common design elements of berths.  

==Beds in boats or ships==
[[Image:Bed berth.jpg|thumb|A bed on a boat is sometimes known as a berth]]
{{see also|Cabin (ship)}}
While beds on large [[ship]]s are little different from those on shore, the lack of space on smaller [[yacht]]s means that bunks must be fit in wherever possible. Some of these berths have specific names:

;V-berth: Almost all yachts have a bed in the extreme forward end of the hull (usually in a separate cabin called the '''forepeak''').&lt;ref name="Claiborne"&gt;{{cite book|author=Young, Claiborne|title=Power Cruising: The Complete Guide to Selecting, Outfitting, and Maintaining Your Power Boat|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_7XwuOd800wC&amp;pg=PA50|publisher=Pelican Publishing|isbn=978-1-4556-1064-8|pages=50–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the shape of the hull this bed is basically triangular, though most also have a triangular notch cut out of the middle of the aft end, splitting it partially into two separate beds and making it more of a V shape, hence the name. This notch can usually be filled in with a detachable board and cushion, creating something more like a double bed (though with drastically reduced space for the feet; 12" wide is typical). The term "V-berth" is not widely used in the UK, instead the cabin as a whole (the forepeak) is usually referred to.

;Settee berth: The archetypal layout for a small yacht has seats running down both sides of the cabin, with a table in the middle. At night, these seats can usually be used as beds. Because the ideal [[ergonomic]] distance between a seat-back and its front edge (back of the knee) makes for a rather narrow bed, good settee berths will have a system for moving the back of the settee out of the way; this can reveal a surprisingly wide bunk, often running right out to the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] side underneath the lockers. If they are to be used at sea, settee berths must have [[#Lee-Cloths|lee-cloths]] to prevent the user falling out of bed. Sometimes the settee forms part of a double bed for use in harbour, often using detachable pieces of the table and extra cushions. Such beds are not usually referred to as settee berths. [[File:USS John C. Stennis (CVN-74) bunks.jpg|thumb|Sailors in their bunks aboard [[USS John C. Stennis (CVN-74)]].]] 

;Pilot berth: A narrow berth high up in the side of the cabin, usually above and behind the back of the settee and right up under the deck. Sometimes the side of this bunk is "walled in" up to the sleeper's chest; there may even be small shelves or lockers on the partition so that the bed is "behind the furniture". The pilot berth is so called because originally they were so small and uncomfortable that nobody slept in them most of the time; only the pilot, if he had to spend a night on board, would be offered it.

;Quarter berth: A single bunk tucked under the [[Cockpit (sailing)|cockpit]]. Usually found in smaller boats where there is not room for a cabin in this location.&lt;ref name="Marshall1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger Marshall|title=The Complete Guide to Choosing a Cruising Sailboat|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TVXR_NyINHoC|date=21 May 1999|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-041998-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Lee cloths: Are sheets of [[canvas]] or other fabric attached to the open side of the bunk (very few are open all round) and usually tucked under the [[mattress]] during the day or when sleeping in [[harbour]]. The lee cloth keeps the sleeping person in the bunk from falling out when the boat [[Sailing#Heeling| heels]] during sailing or rough weather.&lt;ref name="Dix2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dudley Dix|title=South Atlantic Capsize|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ES7QCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA92|date=30 April 2015|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-329-07233-6|pages=92–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Berths in trains==
Long-distance trains running at night usually have sleeping compartments with sleeping berths.  In the case of compartments with two berths, one is on top of the other in a double-bunk arrangement. These beds (the lower bed in a double-bunk arrangement) are usually designed in conjunction with seats which occupy the same space, and each can be folded away when the other is in use.&lt;ref name="Williams2009"/&gt;

[[Sleeping car|Sleeper trains]] are very common especially in [[Europe]].  There are nightly sleeper trains in most countries. Sleeper trains usually consist of single or double-berth compartments&lt;ref name="Williams2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=China Williams|title=Thailand|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oc0LoROKM0MC&amp;pg=PA769|year=2009|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74220-385-0|pages=769–}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as couchettes which have 4 or 6 beds (a bottom, middle and top bunk on each side of the compartment).&lt;ref name="TimothyTeye2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dallen Timothy|author2=Victor Teye|title=Tourism and the Lodging Sector|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kkJro7zYe2YC&amp;pg=PA202|date=26 October 2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-43398-6|pages=202–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Berths in long-distance trucks==
[[Trucking#Trucking_and_hauling|Long-haul truckers]] sleep in berths known as [[sleeper cab]]s contained within their trucks. The sleeper-berth's size and location is typically regulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Truck parking areas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Xl2cziobgsC&amp;pg=PA6|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-1-4289-9649-6|pages=6–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently there are three translations of the [[Bible]] into modern [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]].

Ray of Hope (Боорукерликтин өкүлдүгү «ҮМҮТ НУРУ») produced a translation from the [[Russian Synodal Bible|Russian Synodal Version]]. This is the most commonly used translation.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Lingua Service («Лингвосервис» борбору) together with the United Bible Society (Бириккен Ыйык Китеп Коомдору) published a new translation of the [[New Testament]] in 2005. They are currently working on the Old Testament.

Askar Mambetaliev has translated a large portion of the Bible into a more dynamic equivalent/paraphrase translation.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} This translation is specially intended for [[evangelism]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] have revised the Ray of Hope translation to match closer to the English [[New World Translation]] producing a Kyrgyz "New World Translation", ''Жаңы дүйнө котормосу''.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

A '''binary-to-text encoding''' is [[code|encoding]] of [[data (computing)|data]] in [[plain text]]. More precisely, it is an encoding of binary data in a sequence of [[character (computing)|printable characters]]. These encodings are necessary for transmission of data when the channel does not allow binary data (such as [[email]] or [[NNTP]]) or is not [[8-bit clean]]. [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] documentation ({{IETF RFC|4880}}) uses the term '''ASCII armor''' for binary-to-text encoding when referring to [[Base64]].

==Description==
The [[ASCII]] text-encoding standard uses 128 unique values (0–127) to represent the alphabetic, numeric, and punctuation characters commonly used in [[English language|English]], plus a selection of [[C0 and C1 control codes|control codes]] which do not represent [[graphic character|printable characters]].  For example, the capital letter ''A'' is ASCII character 65, the numeral ''2'' is ASCII 50, the character ''&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' is ASCII 125, and the [[metacharacter]] ''carriage return'' is ASCII 13.  Systems based on ASCII use seven bits to represent these values digitally.

In contrast, most computers store data in memory organized in eight-bit [[byte]]s. Files that contain machine-executable code and non-textual data typically contain all 256 possible eight-bit byte values.  Many computer programs came to rely on this distinction between seven-bit ''text'' and eight-bit ''binary'' data, and would not function properly if non-ASCII characters appeared in data that was expected to include only ASCII text.  For example, if the value of the eighth bit is not preserved, the program might interpret a byte value above 127 as a flag telling it to perform some function.

It is often desirable, however, to be able to send non-textual data through text-based systems, such as when one might attach an image file to an e-mail message. To accomplish this, the data is encoded in some way, such that eight-bit data is encoded into seven-bit ASCII characters (generally using only alphanumeric and punctuation characters—the [[ASCII#ASCII printable characters|ASCII printable characters]]). Upon safe arrival at its destination, it is then decoded back to its eight-bit form. This process is referred to as binary to text encoding. Many programs perform this conversion to allow for data-transport, such as [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] and [[GNU Privacy Guard]] (GPG).

==Encoding plain text==
Binary-to-text encoding methods are also used as a mechanism for encoding [[plain text]]. For example:
* Some systems have a more limited character set they can handle; not only are they not [[8-bit clean]], some cannot even handle every printable ASCII character.
* Other systems have limits on the number of characters that may appear between [[line break (computing)|line break]]s, such as the "1000 characters per line" limit of some [[SMTP]] software, as allowed by {{IETF RFC|2821}}.
* Still others add [[header (computing)|header]]s or [[trailer (information technology)|trailer]]s to the text.
* A few poorly-regarded but still-used protocols use [[in-band signaling]], causing confusion if specific patterns appear in the message.  The best-known is the string "From&amp;nbsp;" (including trailing space) at the beginning of a line used to separate mail messages in the [[mbox]] file format.
By using a binary-to-text encoding on messages that are already plain text, then decoding on the other end, one can make such systems appear to be completely [[Transparency (telecommunication)|transparent]].
This is sometimes referred to as 'ASCII armoring'. For example, the ViewState component of [[ASP.NET]] uses [[base64]] encoding to safely transmit text via HTTP POST,
in order to avoid [[delimiter collision]].

The 95 [[isprint]] codes 32 to 126 are known as the [[ASCII#ASCII printable characters|ASCII printable characters]].

Some older and today uncommon formats include BOO, BTOA, and USR encoding.

Most of these encodings generate text containing only a subset of all [[ASCII]] printable characters: for example, the [[base64]] encoding generates text that only contains upper case and lower case letters, (A–Z, a–z), numerals (0–9), and the "+", "/", and "=" symbols.

Some of these encoding (quoted-printable and percent encoding) are based on a set of allowed characters and a single [[escape character]]. The allowed characters are left unchanged, while all other characters are converted into a string starting with the escape character. This kind of conversion allows the resulting text to be almost readable, in that letters and digits are part of the allowed characters, and are therefore left as they are in the encoded text.
These encodings produce the shortest plain ASCII output for input that is mostly printable ASCII.

Some other encodings ([[base64]], [[uuencoding]]) are based on mapping all possible sequences of six [[bit]]s into different printable characters. Since there are more than 2&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;64 printable characters, this is possible. A given sequence of bytes is translated by viewing it as stream of bits, breaking this stream in chunks of six bits and generating the sequence of corresponding characters.  The different encodings differ in the mapping between sequences of bits and characters and in how the resulting text is formatted.

Some encodings (the original version of BinHex and the recommended encoding for [[CipherSaber]]) use four bits instead of six, mapping all possible sequences of 4 bits onto the 16 standard [[hexadecimal]] digits.
Using 4 bits per encoded character leads to a 50% longer output than base64, but simplifies encoding and decoding—expanding each byte in the source independently to two encoded bytes is simpler than base64's expanding 3 source bytes to 4 encoded bytes.

Out of [[PETSCII]]'s first 192 codes, 164 have visible representations when quoted: 5 (white), 17–20 and 28–31 (colors and cursor controls), 32–90 (ascii equivalent), 91–127 (graphics), 129 (orange), 133–140 (function keys), 144–159 (colors and cursor controls), and 160–192 (graphics).&lt;ref&gt;http://sta.c64.org/cbm64pet.html et al&lt;/ref&gt; This theoretically permits encodings, such as base128, between PETSCII-speaking machines.

[[Pandit]]a [[Brahmacharya|Brahmacharini]] '''Chandabai''' (1880–1977) was a [[Jain]] scholar and a pioneer of women's education in India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jainsamaj.org/rpg_site/literature2.php?id=2741&amp;cat=62 Pandita Chandabai, JainSamaj.org]&lt;/ref&gt; She was the founder of the oldest women's publication in India that is still published, ''[[Jain Mahiladarsh]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jainmahiladarsh.com/ New Page 1&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325114719/http://www.jainmahiladarsh.com/ |date=25 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
The daughter of Narayandas Agrwal of [[Vrindavan]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], a prominent citizen and a proponent of Indian's independence, she was married at the age of 11 to Dharmakumar, the 18-year-old grandson of the [[zamindar]] and scholar Prabhudas Jain of [[Arrah]]. Dharmakumar died the next year. His older brother, Devkumar Jain, himself a Jain scholar, encourage Chandabai to study, which was uncommon in that period.&lt;ref&gt;Nemichandra Jyotishacharya, Ma Shri, in ''Jain Jagaran ke Agraduta'', 1952, Bharatiya Jñanapitha&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Overview==
Chandabai studied the classical subjects including [[Sanskrit]], [[Prakrit]], [[dharmaśāstra]], [[nyaya|nyāya]] (logic), literature and grammar. She earned the title "pandita" from Kashi. She was a good orator, she gave her first speech at [[Panipat]] during a [[Panch-kalyanak Pratishtha]] at the age of 17.

She established a school for girls in 1907, which came to be known as the Jain Balasharm in 1921. Dr. Nemichandra Jyotishacharya, who later emerged as a major Jain scholar, was appointed by her to be the director of the Balasharm in 1939. During the interview, she asked him questions on Sanskrit and Prakrit texts such as ''Devagama Stotra'', ''Atmanushasana'', and ''Gommatsar Jivakanda''.

She often herself served sick students at the Balashrama. She nursed a girl sick with typhoid in 1943, who eventually got better and later earned the ''Nyayatirtha'' degree.

==Magazines==
{{See also|Jain Mahiladarsh}}
She started a magazine, ''Jain Mahiladarsh'', in 1921 and edited it for many years. She wrote several books including ''Updesh Ratna Mala'', ''Saubhagya Ratna Mala'', ''Nibandh Ratna Mala'', ''Adarsh Kahaniyan'', ''Adarsh Nibandh'', and ''Nibandh Darpan''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2214">In the [[Hacker (computer security)|computer hacking]] scene of the 1980s, '''demon dialing''' was a technique by which a [[computer]] was used to repeatedly dial a number (usually to a crowded [[modem]] pool) in an attempt to gain access immediately after another user had hung up.  The expansion of accessible [[internet service provider]] connectivity since that time has rendered the practice more or less obsolete.

A similar technique was sometimes used to get the first call for prizes in radio "call-in" shows, thus leading to the adoption of random "fifth caller," "seventeenth caller" etc. by radio stations to circumvent this practice.

The term "demon dialing" derives from the Demon Dialer product from Zoom Telephonics, Inc., a telephone device produced in the 1980s which repeatedly dialed busy telephone numbers under control of an extension phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Demon Dialer | publisher = [[Zoom Telephonics]] | url = http://www.zoomtel.com/techsupport/dialer/demon_dialer.html | accessdate = 2014-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Demon dialing" was popularized by the movie ''[[WarGames]]'', which demonstrates the hacking technique (the technique eventually evolves into a technique called "phreaking")&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/31933/demon-dialer|title=What is a Demon Dialer? - Definition from Techopedia|work=Techopedia.com|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. After giving the program an area code and 3 digit prefix, the program then serially dialed every phone number in that prefix in order, recording which phone numbers were answered by a computer modem. Soon after, most likely because it was popularized by the movie, serial dialing was outlawed.  Hackers got around this by simply randomizing the order the program dialed all the numbers. Later the terms "demon dialing" and "[[war dialing]]" became synonymous.

In [[philately]] a '''Die Proof''' is a printed image [[Pull (philately)|pulled]] directly from the [[Die (philately)|master die]] for an engraved [[Postage stamp|stamp]].

As a stamp is engraved it is necessary to check progress and a series of proofs are printed or 'pulled' from the die. These are known as progressive or contemporary die proofs.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, L.N. &amp; M. ''Fundamentals of Philately'', The American Philatelic Society, State College, Penn., 1971, pp. 93-97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Progressive proofs also form part of the design and approval process for a stamp. Any changes made during this process turn the proofs into ''essays'' which may be identified retrospectively because they differ from the issued stamp. Die proofs for engraved stamps are normally printed under great pressure onto oversized card and, as they are printed from the master die, they are normally of high quality. By contrast they may also be printed on [[India paper|India Paper]], a strong, thin, opaque paper. The proofs are not necessarily in the same colour(s) as the issued stamp. A proof on India or other paper mounted on a die-sunk card is known as a ''hybrid proof''.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick, Douglas &amp; Mary. ''The Hodder Stamp Dictionary'', Hodder &amp; Stoughton, London, 1973, p.113. {{ISBN|0-340-17183-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the die is completed, it is transferred multiple times to the ''plate'' from which the stamps are printed.

Any pulls from the master die after the stamp has been printed are known as ''posthumous die proofs'' and are normally produced for presentation purposes, as samples of the printer's work or to satisfy [[philately|philatelic]] demand (demand for the item amongst collectors of stamps).

This article explains the conjugation of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] verbs.

==Classification of verbs==
{{see also|Germanic verb}}
There are two different ways in which Dutch verbs can be grouped: by conjugational class and by derivation. These two categorizations describe different aspects of a verb's conjugation and therefore are complementary to each other.

===By conjugational class===
Dutch verbs can be grouped by their conjugational class, as follows:

* Weak verbs: past tense and past participle formed with a dental suffix
** Weak verbs with past in ''-de''
** Weak verbs with past in ''-te''
* Strong verbs: past tense formed by changing the vowel of the stem, past participle in ''-en''
** Class 1: pattern ''ij-ee-ee''
** Class 2: pattern ''ie-oo-oo'' or ''ui-oo-oo''
** Class 3: pattern ''i-o-o'' or ''e-o-o''
** Class 4: pattern ''ee-a/aa-oo''
** Class 5: pattern ''ee-a/aa-ee'' or ''i-a/aa-ee''
** Class 6: pattern ''aa-oe-aa''
** Class 7: pattern ''X-ie-X'' (specifically, ''oo-ie-oo'', ''a-ie-a'', ''a-i-a'', ''ou-iel-ou'', ''aa-ie-aa'' or ''oe-ie-oe'')
** Other strong verbs, which don't follow any of the above patterns
* Mixed verbs
** Weak past tense (''-de'' or ''-te''), but strong past participle (''-en'')
** Strong past tense (vowel change), but weak past participle (''-d'' or ''-t'')
* Irregular verbs: verbs that do not clearly conjugate as any of the above
** Preterite-present verbs: verbs that originally had present tense forms identical to the past of a strong verb
** Weak verbs with past in ''-cht''
** Other irregular verbs

===By derivation===

Another way to group verbs is by the type of derivation. The following can be distinguished:

* Basic: underived, compounded, or derived without prefixation
* Prefixed: with an unstressed prefix
* Separable: with a stressed adverbial (or rarely object-like) prefix

Most of this article shows the conjugation of basic verbs. The differences in prefixed and separable verbs are described here, and can be applied to any verb regardless of conjugation.

====Prefixed verbs====
{{wiktionarycat|category=Dutch prefixed verbs|type=Dutch prefixed verbs}}
Prefixed verbs are verbs whose stem begins with an unstressed prefix. The prefix is usually one of ''be-'', ''ge-'', ''her-'', ''ont-'', ''ver-'', but others are also possible, often derived from adverbs or prepositions. Prefixed verbs are conjugated like basic verbs, except in the past participle. In the past participle, the inflectional prefix ''ge-'' is replaced by the verb's own prefix, and it is not added on. The past participle of ''heropenen'' ("to reopen") is ''heropend'' (not *''geheropend''), and for ''betalen'' ("to pay") it is ''betaald'' (not *''gebetaald'').

In some cases, two verbs exist that are spelled identically, but with one treating an adverb as a prefix, while the other treats it as separable. Such pairs are stressed and thus pronounced differently, and accent marks are sometimes written when there is a chance of confusion: ''voorkómen'' ("to prevent", prefixed) versus ''vóórkomen'' ("to occur", separable), or ''ondergáán'' ("to undergo", prefixed) versus ''óndergaan'' ("to go under, to set", separable).

Prefixed verbs can be derived from basic verbs or from another prefixed verb. With the prefix ''her-'' ("again, re-"), it is also possible to derive prefixed verbs from separable verbs, but such verbs are often [[Defective verb|defective]], with the separated ([[V2 word order|V2-affected]]) forms often being avoided by speakers. For example, the verb ''herinrichten'' ("to rearrange, to redecorate") is a combination of the prefix ''her-'' and the separable verb ''inrichten''. According to the syntactical rules, this must become ''Ik '''richt''' de kamer '''herin'''.'' ("I redecorate the room"), but using ''herin'' as a separable particle is often avoided as it is not an independent word (unlike the separable particles of most other verbs). Many speakers choose to rephrase it using the adverb ''opnieuw'' ("again, anew"): ''Ik richt de kamer '''opnieuw''' in.''. In subordinate clauses or with a non-finite verb, there is less objection: ''Mijn vriend keek toe, terwijl ik de kamer '''herinrichtte'''.'' ("My friend looked on, while I redecorated the room.") or ''Ik heb de kamer '''heringericht'''.'' ("I have redecorated the room.").

====Separable verbs====
{{wiktionarycat|category=Dutch separable verbs|type=Dutch separable verbs}}
{{see also|Separable verb}}
Separable verbs are combinations of a main verb (which can be basic or prefixed) and a particle. This particle is usually an adverb, but sometimes it can be a direct object or adjective instead. The particle is stressed more strongly than the main verb, which distinguishes separable verbs from prefixed verbs in pronunciation. The main verb of a separable verb is conjugated like it otherwise would, and can be basic (with ''ge-'' in the past participle) or prefixed (without ''ge-'').

The particle is treated syntactically as a separate verb, and is placed before or after the main verb as syntax dictates:
* When the [[V2 word order|V2 rule]] is in effect (in main clauses with a finite verb), the particle is placed after the main verb and separated from it with a space. It can also be separated from it by other words, just like in a sentence with multiple distinct verbs.
* When the V2 rule is not applied (in subordinate clauses or with a non-finite verb), the particle is placed directly before the main verb and is attached to it without a space.

The following table shows some examples of this in practice:

{| class="wikitable"
! Infinitive
! With V2
! Without V2&lt;br/&gt;(subordinate clause)
! Without V2&lt;br/&gt;(non-finite verb)
|-
| ''omvallen'' ("to fall over")&lt;br/&gt;basic main verb, strong class 7
| ''Ik '''val om'''.''&lt;br/&gt;I '''fall over'''.
| ''Hij ziet niet dat ik '''omval'''.''&lt;br/&gt;He doesn't see that I '''fall over'''.
| ''Ik ben '''omgevallen'''.''&lt;br/&gt;I have '''fallen over'''.
|-
| ''uitkomen'' ("to come true")&lt;br/&gt;basic main verb, strong class 4
| ''Mijn wens '''kwam''' vandaag '''uit'''.''&lt;br/&gt;My wish '''came true''' today.
| ''Het is ongelooflijk dat mijn wens vandaag '''uitkwam'''.''&lt;br/&gt;It is unbelievable that my wish '''came true''' today.
| ''Mijn wens is vandaag '''uitgekomen'''.&lt;br/&gt;My wish has '''come true''' today.
|-
| ''uitbetalen'' ("to pay out")&lt;br/&gt;prefixed main verb, weak in ''-d''
| ''Gisteren '''betaalde''' zij het geld '''uit'''.''&lt;br/&gt;Yesterday she '''paid out''' the money.
| ''Ik weet niet of zij het geld gisteren '''uitbetaalde'''.''&lt;br/&gt;I don't know if she '''paid out''' the money yesterday.
| ''Zij heeft het geld '''uitbetaald'''.''&lt;br/&gt;She has '''paid out''' the money.
|}

==Forms and endings==

Dutch verbs conjugate for [[Grammatical tense|tense]] in present and past, and for [[Grammatical mood|mood]] in [[Indicative mood|indicative]], [[Subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] and [[Imperative mood|imperative]]. The [[Subjunctive in Dutch|subjunctive mood in Dutch]] is archaic or formal, and is rarely used. There are two [[grammatical number]]s (singular and plural) and three [[grammatical person]]s. However, many forms are identical to others, so the conjugation doesn't have distinct forms for all possible combinations of these factors (that is, there is considerable [[Syncretism (linguistics)|syncretism]]). In particular, there is always just one form for the plural, and only in the present indicative is there a clear distinction among the different singular persons.

Each second-person pronoun may have its own form. The following can be distinguished:

* singular informal ''jij''
* singular and plural formal ''u''
* singular and plural southern ''gij''
* plural informal ''jullie''

All regular verbs, whether weak, strong or mixed, form the present tense in the same way. This also includes the infinitive and present participle. Only the formation of the past tense differs among regular verbs, depending on whether the verb is strong, weak or mixed. The endings are as follows:

{| class="wikitable"

| (ge-) -en&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;
|}

Notes:
# When the stem of a verb ends in ''-t'' already, the ending ''-t'' is not added on as a word cannot end in ''-tt''. Similarly, when the stem ends in ''-d'' the additional ''-d'' in the weak past participle is not added.
# When the second-person ''jij''-form is followed immediately by the subject pronoun itself (''jij'' or ''je''), it loses its ''-t'': ''Jij werkt'' → ''Werk jij?'' ("You work" → "Do you work?"). The ''-t'' is present in all other cases.
# The additional ''-t'' of the second-person ''gij''-form is optional in the past tense for weak verbs and is usually considered archaic. For strong verbs, the -t is always required.&lt;ref&gt;http://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/vraag/343/gij_had_hadt/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vrt.be/taal/gij&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://taalhelden.org/bericht/kwaamt-en-werdt&lt;/ref&gt;
# The prefix ''ge-'' of the past participle is not added when the verb is a prefixed verb. See above for more information.

All forms of a given regular verb can be predicted from just three forms, or sometimes four. These are the '''[[principal parts]]''' of a verb.

* The infinitive, which represents the present tense.
* The past singular, which represents the past tense (except the past participle).
* The past plural, for some strong verbs. Normally, the past plural can be predicted from the past singular, but in class 4 and 5 strong verbs, the past singular has a short vowel while it is long in the plural. The past subjunctive singular, and the past indicative second-person singular ''gij'' form have the same long vowel as the past plural, if it is distinct.
* The past participle, by itself.

In the sections that follow, only the principal parts of each verb are given when this is sufficient to describe the full conjugation of the verb.

==Present tense==

As noted above, the present tense of all regular verbs is formed the same, and follows the same rules. The following table shows the conjugation of two verbs in the present tense:
{| class="wikitable"

If the stem ends in ''-t'', then no additional ''-t'' ending is added when this would otherwise be required, as a word cannot end in a double consonant (''-tt'' in this case) in Dutch spelling. This makes all present singular forms identical.

==Past tense==

The past tense is formed differently depending on whether the verb is weak, strong or mixed.

===Weak verbs===
{{wiktionarycat|category=Dutch weak verbs|type=Dutch weak verbs}}
{{see also|Germanic weak verb}}

Weak verbs are the most common type of verb in Dutch, and the only productive type (all newly created verbs are weak). They form their past tense with an ending containing a dental consonant, ''-d-'' or ''-t-''.

Whether ''-d-'' or ''-t-'' is used depends on the final consonant of the verb stem. If the stem ends in a [[voiceless]] consonant, then ''-t-'' is used, otherwise ''-d-''. It is often summarised with the mnemonic "[['t kofschip]]": if the verb stem ends with one of the consonants of ''[['t kofschip]]'' (''t, k, f, s, ch, p''), then the past tense will have ''-t-''. However, it also applies for ''c'', ''q'' and ''x'' and any other letter that is voiceless in pronunciation.

The following tables show the past tense forms of a weak verb with a past tense in ''-d-'' (stem does not end in voiceless consonant), and with a past tense in ''-t-'' (stem ends in voiceless consonant).
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! colspan="2" |Infinitive
|vull'''en''' ("to fill")
|werk'''en''' ("to work")
|-
! rowspan="6" |Indicative mood
! 1st sing.
| rowspan="2" | vul'''de'''
| rowspan="2" |werk'''te'''
|-
! 2nd sing. ''jij''
|-
! 2nd sg+pl ''gij''
| vul'''de(t)'''
|werk'''te(t)'''
|-
! 2nd sg+pl ''u''
| rowspan="2" | vul'''de'''
| rowspan="2" |werk'''te'''
|-
! 3rd sing.
|-

|werk'''ten'''
|-
! rowspan="2" |Subjunctive mood
! Singular
| vul'''de'''
|werk'''te'''
|-
! Plural
| vul'''den'''
|werk'''ten'''
|-
! colspan="2" |Participle
|'''ge'''vul'''d'''
|'''ge'''werk'''t'''
|}If the stem ends in ''-v'' or ''-z'', then these are spelled ''-f'' and ''-s'' at the end of a syllable, as in the present tense. However, they are still pronounced as voiced {{IPA|/v/}} and {{IPA|/z/}} when the past tense ending is added, so the stem is still considered voiced, and the past endings have ''-d-'':

* ''leven, lee'''fd'''e, gelee'''fd''''' ("to live")
* ''blozen, bloo'''sd'''e, gebloo'''sd''''' ("to blush")

If the stem ends in ''-d'' or ''-t'', then no ending is added in the past participle, as a word cannot end in a double consonant (''-dd-'' or ''-tt'' in this case) in Dutch spelling. The past tense stem will be pronounced the same as the present, but it is still spelled with ''-dd-'' or ''-tt-'', even when the spelling rules would allow this to be simplified. Thus:
* ''baden'', ''baadde'', ''gebaad'' ("to bathe").
* ''redden'', ''redde'', ''gered'' ("to save, to rescue").
* ''praten'', ''praatte'', ''gepraat'' ("to talk").
* ''zetten'', ''zette'', ''gezet'' ("to set, to place").
Compare this to English ''set'', which has a similar homophony between present and past.

===Strong verbs===
{{wiktionarycat|category=Dutch strong verbs|type=Dutch strong verbs}}
{{see also|Germanic strong verb}}

Strong verbs form their past tenses by changing the vowel of the stem, a process known as [[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]]. There are far fewer strong verbs than weak verbs in Dutch, but many of the most commonly used verbs are strong, so they are encountered frequently. There are about 150 strong roots, giving rise to about 800 strong verbs in total, if all derived verbs with separable and inseparable prefixes are included.

Strong verbs use a different set of endings from weak verbs. However, the same rules for final ''-t'', ''-v'', ''-z'' apply.

|}The vowels that occur in present and past are not random, but follow clear patterns. These patterns can be divided into seven "classes", some with subgroups. Some verbs are a mixture of two classes or belong to none of the existing classes.

In the following subsections, the vowel patterns of each class are described. For clarity, long vowels are always written doubled in the patterns. In the actual conjugated verb, they will be single or double according to normal Dutch spelling rules.

====Class 1====
{{wiktionarycat|category=Dutch class 1 strong verbs|type=Dutch class 1 strong verbs}}

Class 1 follows the vowel pattern '''ij-ee-ee''':
* ''schijnen'', ''scheen'', ''geschenen'' ("to shine").
* ''blijven'', ''bleef'', ''gebleven'' ("to stay, to remain").

====Class 2====
{{wiktionarycat|category=Dutch class 2 strong verbs|type=Dutch class 2 strong verbs}}

Class 2 is divided into two subclasses.

Class 2a follows the vowel pattern '''ie-oo-oo''':
* ''bieden'', ''bood'', ''geboden'' ("to offer").
* ''schieten'', ''schoot'', ''geschoten'' ("to shoot").

Class 2b follows the vowel pattern '''ui-oo-oo''':
* ''sluiten'', ''sloot'', ''gesloten'' ("to close").
* ''buigen'', ''boog'', ''gebogen'' ("to bend").

The verbs ''vriezen'' and ''verliezen'' show [[grammatischer Wechsel]], with ''s/z'' changing to ''r'' in the past tense:
* ''vrie'''z'''en'', ''vroo'''r''''', ''gevro'''r'''en'' ("to freeze").
* ''verlie'''z'''en'', ''verloo'''r''''', ''verlo'''r'''en'' ("to lose"; a prefixed verb, so no ''ge-'' in the past participle).

====Class 3====
{{wiktionarycat|category=Dutch class 3 strong verbs|type=Dutch class 3 strong verbs}}

Class 3 is divided into two subclasses.

Class 3a follows the vowel pattern '''i-o-o''':
* ''drinken'', ''dronk'', ''gedronken'' ("to drink").
* ''binden'', ''bond'', ''gebonden'' ("to bind").
The vowel is usually followed by ''m'' or ''n'' and another consonant.

Class 3b follows '''e-o-o''':
* ''smelten'', ''smolt'', ''gesmolten'' ("to melt").
* ''vechten'', ''vocht'', ''gevochten'' ("to fight").
The vowel is usually followed by ''l'' or ''r'' and another consonant.

====Class 4====
{{wiktionarycat|category=Dutch class 4 strong verbs|type=Dutch class 4 strong verbs}}

Class 4 follows the vowel pattern '''ee-a/aa-oo''':
* ''stelen'', ''stal''/''stalen'', ''gestolen'' ("to steal").
* ''nemen'', ''nam''/''namen'', ''genomen'' ("to take").
The vowel in these verbs is usually followed by ''l'', ''r'', ''m'' or ''n'' and no other consonant.

The verb ''komen'' has an irregular pattern with short ''o'' in the present singular, long ''oo'' in the remaining present tense, and an additional ''w'' in the past:
* ''kom''/''komen'', ''kwam''/''kwamen'', ''gekomen'' ("to come").

====Class 5====
{{wiktionarycat|category=Dutch class 5 strong verbs|type=Dutch class 5 strong verbs}}

Class 5 follows the vowel pattern '''ee-a/aa-ee''', with the same change in length as in class 4:
* ''geven'', ''gaf''/''gaven'', ''gegeven'' ("to give").
* ''lezen'', ''las''/''lazen'', ''gelezen'' ("to read").
The vowel is usually followed by an [[obstruent consonant]].

The verbs ''bidden'', ''liggen'' and ''zitten'' follow the pattern '''i-a/aa-ee''' instead:
* ''bidden'', ''bad''/''baden'', ''gebeden'' ("to pray").
* ''liggen'', ''lag''/''lagen'', ''gelegen'' ("to lie (down)").
* ''zitten'', ''zat''/''zaten'', ''gezeten'' ("to sit").
These three verbs are descended from the old Germanic ''j-present'' verbs, which had an additional suffix ''-j-'' before the endings in the present tense. This suffix caused doubling of the preceding consonant (the [[West Germanic gemination]]) and changed the preceding vowel from ''e'' to ''i''.

The verb ''eten'' is regular but has an extra ''-g-'' in the past participle:
* ''eten'', ''at''/''aten'', ''ge'''g'''eten'' ("to eat").
Originally, it was simply ''geten'', contracted from earlier ''ge-eten''. An additional ''ge-'' was added on later. Compare German ''essen, ge'''g'''essen'', which shows the same development.

====Class 6====
{{wiktionarycat|category=Dutch class 6 strong verbs|type=Dutch class 6 strong verbs}}

Class 6 follows the vowel pattern '''aa-oe-aa'''. It is the smallest of the strong verb classes, with only a few verbs.
* ''graven'', ''groef'', ''gegraven'' ("to dig").
* ''dragen'', ''droeg'', ''gedragen'' ("to carry").

====Class 7====
{{wiktionarycat|category=Dutch class 7 strong verbs|type=Dutch class 7 strong verbs}}

Class 7 follows the vowel pattern '''X-ie-X''', where the two X's are identical. There were originally five subgroups depending on the vowel of the present tense. Class 7a (with ''ee'' or ''ei'' in the present) has disappeared in Dutch, so only four subgroups remain.

Class 7b has '''oo''' in the present tense:
* ''lopen'', ''liep'', ''gelopen'' ("to walk, to run").

Class 7c has '''a''' in the present tense:
* ''vallen'', ''viel'', ''gevallen'' ("to fall").
Two verbs have shortened the past tense vowel to ''i'':
* ''hangen'', ''hing'', ''gehangen'' ("to hang").
* ''vangen'', ''ving'', ''gevangen'' ("to catch").

In present tense of the verb ''houden'', the original combination ''-ald-'' underwent [[L-vocalization]], and became ''-oud-''.
* ''houden'', ''hield'', ''gehouden'' ("to hold, to keep").
It also has an alternative form which lacks ''-d'' when it occurs at the end: ''hou'' alongside the regular ''houd''.

Class 7d has '''aa''' in the present tense:
* ''laten'', ''liet'', ''gelaten'' ("to let, to allow").

Class 7e has '''oe''' in the present tense:
* ''roepen'', ''riep'', ''geroepen'' ("to call").

====Other strong verbs====

Several strong verbs have vowel patterns that don't fit with any of the above types.

A number of class 3b strong verbs have replaced their original past tense vowel with the ''-ie-'' of class 7, creating a "hybrid" class. The past participle vowel ''o'' of class 3 remains.

* ''helpen'', ''hielp'', ''geholpen'' ("to help")
* ''sterven'', ''stierf'', ''gestorven'' ("to die")
* ''werpen'', ''wierp'', ''geworpen'' ("to throw")
* ''werven'', ''wierf'', ''geworven'' ("to recruit")
* ''zwerven'', ''zwierf'', ''gezworven'' ("to wander, to roam")

The verb ''worden'' also belonged to class 3b, but the past and present vowels appear to have been swapped:
* ''worden'', ''werd'', ''geworden'' ("to become").
Contrast this with German ''werden'', which kept the older vowel.

Class 6 originally had three ''j-present'' verbs, like ''liggen'' of class 5. These verbs originally followed the pattern '''e-oe-aa'''. All three have changed this in one way or another in modern Dutch:
* ''heffen, hief, geheven'' ("to lift, to raise"). This now has a class 7 past, and its past participle vowel was changed to ''ee''.
* ''scheppen, schiep, geschapen'' ("to create"). This now has a class 7 past.
* ''zweren, zwoer, gezworen'' ("to swear, (an oath)"). This kept its class 6 past, but replaced the past participle vowel with the ''oo'' of class 4.

three verbs appear to follow a class 3b pattern, but have a long vowel instead of a short one:
* ''wegen, woog, gewogen'' ("to weigh"). Originally class 5.
* ''scheren, schoor, geschoren'' ("to shave, to shear"). Originally class 4.
* ''zweren, zwoor, gezworen'' ("to fester"). Originally class 4.

The verb ''uitscheiden'' is the only remaining class 7a verb, but it now has a class 1 past (note that ''ei'' and ''ij'' are pronounced the same):
* ''uitscheiden, scheed uit, uitgescheiden'' ("to excrete"; this is a separable verb).
Even the form ''scheed uit'' is falling out of use, and is being replaced with a weak past ''scheidde uit'', making it a mixed verb.

===Mixed verbs===
{{wiktionarycat|category=Dutch mixed verbs|type=Dutch mixed verbs}}

Some verbs have a mixture of strong and weak forms. These are called "mixed verbs" and are relatively common in Dutch. Most mixed verbs are originally strong verbs that have replaced some strong forms with weak forms. However, a few were originally weak but have become strong by analogy.

The most common type of mixed verb has a weak past tense, but a strong past participle in ''-en''. Most mixed verbs of this type have the same vowel in the present and in the past participle, and therefore appear to be original class 6 and 7 verbs. A few still have the older strong past as an archaic form.

Mixed verbs that originally had class 6 pasts:

* ''bakken, bakte, gebakken'' ("to bake").
* ''lachen, lachte, gelachen'' ("to laugh"). The strong past ''loech'' still exists, but is archaic.
* ''laden, laadde, geladen'' ("to load").
* ''malen, maalde, gemalen'' ("to grind").
* ''varen, vaarde, gevaren'' ("to fare"). The sense "to travel by boat" has a class 6 past ''voer''.

Mixed verbs that originally had class 7 pasts:

* ''bannen, bande, gebannen'' ("to ban").
* ''brouwen, brouwde, gebrouwen'' ("to brew").
* ''houwen, houwde, gehouwen'' ("to hew"). The strong past ''hieuw'' still exists, but is archaic.
* ''raden, raadde, geraden'' ("to guess"). The strong past ''ried'' still exists.
* ''scheiden, scheidde, gescheiden'' ("to separate"). But note ''uitscheiden'' has the alternative past ''scheed uit''.
* ''spannen, spande, gespannen'' ("to span, to stretch").
* ''stoten, stootte, gestoten'' ("to bump, to knock"). The strong past ''stiet'' still exists, but is archaic.
* ''vouwen, vouwde, gevouwen'' ("to fold"). From older ''vouden'' with loss of ''-d-'' as is common in Dutch; the past originally had ''-ield-'' like ''houden''.
* ''wassen, waste, gewassen'' ("to wash"). The strong past ''wies'' still exists, but is archaic.
* ''zouten, zoutte, gezouten'' ("to salt"). The past originally had ''-ielt-'', like ''houden''.

Mixed verbs from other classes:

* ''barsten, barstte, gebarsten'' ("to burst, to crack"). Originally class 3; the older vowels ''e'' and ''o'' changed to ''a'' in standard Dutch, but are still found in some dialects.
* ''wreken, wreekte, gewroken'' ("to take revenge"). Originally class 4, like ''breken''.
* ''weven, weefde, geweven'' ("to weave"). Originally class 5, like ''geven''.

A smaller group of verbs, all belonging to class 6, has the reverse situation. The past tense is strong, but the past participle is weak.

* ''jagen, joeg, gejaagd'' ("to hunt"). The weak past ''jaagde'' also occurs.
* ''vragen, vroeg, gevraagd'' ("to ask"). The weak past ''vraagde'' also occurs, rarely.
* ''waaien, woei, gewaaid'' ("to blow (of the wind)"). The weak past ''waaide'' also occurs.

==Irregular verbs==
{{wiktionarycat|category=Dutch irregular verbs|type=Dutch irregular verbs}}
{{wiktionarycat|category=Dutch preterite-present verbs|type=Dutch preterite-present verbs}}

The following verbs are very irregular, and may not fit neatly into the strong-weak split.

An important subset of these verbs are the preterite-present verbs, which are shared by all Germanic languages. In the present tense, they originally conjugated like the past tense of a strong verb. In Dutch, this means that they lack the ''-t'' in the third-person singular present indicative, much like their English equivalents which lack the ''-s''. Their past tense forms are weak, but irregularly so. Most of these verbs have become [[auxiliary verb]]s, so they may be missing imperative forms, and perhaps the participles as well.

===''zijn''===

The verb ''zijn'' "to be" is [[Suppletion|suppletive]], and uses a different root in the present and past. Its present tense is highly irregular, and the past shows [[grammatischer Wechsel]] like the strong verb ''vriezen'' (''s/z'' becomes ''r'').

===''kunnen''===

The verb ''kunnen'' also has a vowel change in the present, and a variety of alternative forms. In the past tense, it has both a vowel change and, in the plural, the weak dental suffix. With 'u' and 'jij' both 'kunt' and 'kan' are possible. While 'kan' is usually used in speech, in writing 'kunt' is preferred in the Netherlands. 'Kan' is considered to be more informal.&lt;ref&gt;http://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/vraag/442/je_wil_zal_kan_je_wilt_zult_kunt/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/vraag/1464/&lt;/ref&gt;

===''zullen''===

The verb ''zullen'' is the most irregular of the preterite-presents. In the present, the forms strongly resemble those of ''kunnen''. The past is different, and has changed earlier ''-old-'' to ''-oud-'', and then dropped the ''-d-'' in many forms.

Like its English equivalent ''would'', the past tense ''zou'' does not literally indicate past time. Instead, the distinction is one of certainty: the present indicates certain future time, while the past indicates a conditional event. Compare:
* ''Zonder eten zal ik niet kunnen slapen.'' "Without food, I will not be able to sleep." (The speaker knows this for sure)
* ''Zonder eten zou ik niet kunnen slapen.'' "Without food, I would not be able to sleep." (The speaker expects this, hypothetically)

===''willen''===

The verb ''willen'' is not a preterite-present verb in origin, but nowadays it inflects much the same.

There are two different past tense forms. The original form ''wou(den)'' has a change of ''-old-'' to ''-oud-'', like in ''zullen'', but this form is now considered colloquial or dialectal. The newer, regular form ''wilde(n)'' is considered more standard.

===Contracted vowel stems===

A handful of common verbs have a stem ending in a vowel in the present tense. The endings contract with the stem, losing any ''-e-'' in the ending. The following table shows an example.

|}The verbs have a variety of past tense forms, reflecting their differing origins:

* ''zien'', ''zag''/''zagen'', ''gezien'' ("to see"). This is a class 5 strong verb that originally had ''-h-'' in the stem, which disappeared. [[Grammatischer Wechsel]] occurred in the past.
* ''slaan'', ''sloeg'', ''geslagen'' ("to hit, to beat"). As ''zien'', but class 6.
* ''doen'', ''deed'', ''gedaan'' ("to do, to put"). The past looks like it's weak, but actually shows the remnants of older [[reduplication]].
* ''gaan'', ''ging'', ''gegaan'' ("to go"). The past comes from a different, extended form of the stem (''gang-''), which was class 7 like ''vangen'' and ''hangen''.
* ''staan'', ''stond'', ''gestaan'' ("to stand"). The past comes from a different, extended form of the stem (''stand-'', like the English verb).

===Weak verbs with past in ''-cht''===
{{wiktionarycat|category=Dutch weak verbs (-cht)|type=Dutch weak verbs in ''-cht''}}
{{see also|Germanic spirant law}}

A few verbs form their past with irregularly because of an early Germanic development called the "Germanic spirant law". Both the vowel and the consonant change, sometimes in rather unexpected ways. However, these verbs are still weak even though the vowel changes, because the past tense and participle have a dental suffix (''-t-''). The vowel change is not caused by [[ablaut]] (which is the origin of the vowel changes in strong verbs), but by an entirely different phenomenon called [[Rückumlaut]].

Six verbs have this type of conjugation. Note that their English equivalents often have similar changes.

* ''brengen'', ''bracht''/''brachten'', ''gebracht'' ("to bring").
* ''denken'', ''dacht''/''dachten'', ''gedacht'' ("to think").
* ''dunken'', ''docht''/''dochten'', ''gedocht'' ("to seem, to be considered"). The irregular past is rare and archaic, the regular weak ''dunkte'' is more common.
* ''kopen'', ''kocht''/''kochten'', ''gekocht'' ("to buy"). In this case the ''-cht'' is from earlier ''-ft'' (a regular change in Dutch).
* ''plegen'', ''placht''/''plachten'', ''geplacht'' ("to do habitually"). Rarely used.
* ''zoeken'', ''zocht''/''zochten'', ''gezocht'' ("to seek, to look for")

===''zeggen''===

The verb ''zeggen'' ("to say") is weak, but is often conjugated irregularly in the past. There is also a regular conjugation, which is more common in the south. In some dialects, a similar conjugation is followed for ''leggen'' ("to lay").
* Irregular: ''zeggen'', ''zei''/''zeiden'', ''gezegd''. The irregular ''gij''-form of the past is ''zeidt''.
* Regular: ''zeggen'', ''zegde''/''zegden'', ''gezegd''. The regular ''gij''-form of the past is ''zegde(t)''.

'''Efficacy''' is the ability to get a job done satisfactorily. The word comes from the same roots as ''[[effectiveness]]'', and it has often been used synonymously, although in [[pharmacology]] a [[pragmatic clinical trial#Efficacy versus effectiveness|distinction is now often made between efficacy and effectiveness]]. The word ''efficacy'' is used in [[pharmacology]] and [[medicine]] to refer both to the maximum response achievable from a [[pharmaceutical drug]] in research settings,&lt;ref name = HolfordSheiner/&gt; and to the capacity for sufficient therapeutic effect or beneficial change in clinical settings.

{{main article|Intrinsic activity}}
In pharmacology, efficacy ({{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;}}) is the maximum response achievable from an applied or dosed agent, for instance, a small molecule drug.&lt;ref name = HolfordSheiner&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Holford NHG &amp; Sheiner LB | year = 1981 | title = Understanding the dose-effect relationship: Clinical application of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models | journal = Clin. Pharmacokinet. | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 429–453 | quote = | pmid=7032803}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intrinsic activity]] is a relative term for a drug's efficacy relative to a drug with the highest observed efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neubig|first1=RR|last2=Spedding|first2=M|last3=Kenakin|first3=T|last4=Christopoulos|first4=A|last5=International Union of Pharmacology Committee on Receptor Nomenclature and Drug|first5=Classification|title=International Union of Pharmacology Committee on Receptor Nomenclature and Drug Classification. XXXVIII. Update on terms and symbols in quantitative pharmacology.|journal=Pharmacological Reviews|date=December 2003|volume=55|issue=4|pages=597–606|pmid=14657418|doi=10.1124/pr.55.4.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a purely descriptive term that has little or no mechanistic interpretation.

In order for a drug to have an effect, it needs to bind to its target, and then to affect the function of this target. The target of a drug is commonly referred to as a [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]], but can in general be any chemically sensitive site on any molecule found in the body. The nature of such binding can be quantified by characterising how tightly these molecules, the drug and its receptor, interact: this is known as the [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]]. Efficacy, on the other hand, is a measure of the action of a drug once binding has occurred. The maximum response, {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;}}, will be reduced if efficacy is sufficiently low, but any efficacy greater than 20 or so gives essentially the same maximum response.

The definition of efficacy has been object for discussion.&lt;ref name = Colquhoun98&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Colquhoun D | year = 1998 | title =  Binding, gating, affinity and efficacy. The interpretation of structure–activity relationships for agonists and of the effects of mutating receptors | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 125 | issue = 5 | pages = 923–948 | pmid=9846630 | doi=10.1038/sj.bjp.0702164 | pmc=1565672}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The only way in which absolute measures of efficacy have been obtained is by single ion channel analysis of ligand gated ion channels. It is still not possible to do this for G protein-linked receptors.

In the case of the glycine receptor and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (muscle type), it has been proposed by Sivilotti ''et al''. that opening of the ion channel involves two steps after agonist is bound. Firstly a conformation change to a higher affinity (but still shut) form, followed by the conformation change from shut to open.&lt;ref name = vb2004&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Burzomato V, Beato M, Groot-Kormelink P, Colquhoun D &amp; Sivilotti LG | year = 2004 | title =  Single-channel behavior of heteromeric alpha1beta glycine receptors: An attempt to detect a conformational change before the channel opens | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 24 | issue = 48 | pages = 10924–10940 | pmid=15574743 | doi=10.1523/jneurosci.3424-04.2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = lcs2008&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Lape R,  Colquhoun D, Sivilotti L | year = 2008 | title =  On the nature of partial agonism in the nicotinic receptor superfamily | journal = Nature | volume = 454 | issue = 7205 | pages = 722–728 | pmid = 18633353 | doi=10.1038/nature07139 | pmc=2629928}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that partial agonism results from deficiency in the first step, and that the opening and shutting steps are essentially the same for both full and partial agonists. This has been confirmed and extended by Sine and colleagues (2009).&lt;ref name = sine2009&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Mukhtasimova N, Lee WY, Wang HL, Sine SM | year = 2009 | title =  On the nature of partial agonism in the nicotinic receptor superfamily | journal = Nature | volume = 459 | issue = 7245 | pages = 451–454. | quote = | doi=10.1038/nature07923 | pmid=19339970 | pmc=2712348}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implication of this work&lt;ref name="lcs2008" /&gt; is that efficacy has to be defined by at least two equilibrium constants (or, more generally, by four rate constants).

It is the combined influence of both affinity and efficacy which will determine how effectively a drug will produced a biological effect, a property known as [[potency (pharmacology)|potency]].

== Medicine ==
In medicine, efficacy is the capacity for beneficial change (or [[therapeutic effect]]) of a given intervention (for example a drug, [[medical device]], [[surgical procedure]], or a [[public health]] intervention).{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Establishment of the efficacy of an intervention is often done relative to other available interventions, with which it will be compared.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/919860667|title=Nursing research : generating and assessing evidence for nursing practice|vauthors=Polit DF, Beck CT|isbn=9781496300232|edition=Tenth|location=Philadelphia|oclc=919860667}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, efficacy refers to "whether a drug demonstrates a health benefit over a placebo or other intervention when tested in an ideal situation, such as a tightly controlled clinical trial."&lt;ref name = ThaulCRS12&gt;{{cite book | author = Thaul, Susan | date = 2012-06-25 | title = How FDA Approves Drugs and Regulates Their Safety and Effectiveness (CRS 7-5700, R41983) | page = 4 | format = CRS Report for Congress | location = Washington, DC | publisher = Congressional Research Service (CRS) | url = https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41983.pdf | access-date = 22 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies focus on a primary parameter to be shown statistically different between placebo and intervention groups. Comparisons of this type are called 'explanatory' [[randomized controlled trial]]s, whereas 'pragmatic' trials are used to establish the ''effectiveness'' of an intervention regarding also non-specific parameters.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Effectiveness refers "how the drug works in a real-world situation," and is "often lower than efficacy because of interactions with other medications or health conditions of the patient, sufficient dose or duration of use not prescribed by the physician or followed by the patient, or use for an off-label condition that had not been tested."&lt;ref name = ThaulCRS12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Porta, Miquel, Ed. | date = 2008 | title = A Dictionary of Epidemiology | edition = 5th | format = | location = Oxford, ENG | publisher = Oxford University Press | url =  | access-date =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34467">An '''electronic signature''', or e-signature, refers to [[data]] in electronic form, which is logically associated with other data in electronic form and which is used by the [[signature|signatory]] to sign.&lt;ref name="Cryptomathic_WHATISADIGITALSIGNATURE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eIDAS_Reference" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.signable.co.uk/what-are-e-signatures|title=What Are E-Signatures? {{!}} Signable {{!}} |access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of signature provides the same legal standing as a handwritten signature as long as it adheres to the requirements of the specific regulation it was created under (e.g., [[eIDAS]] in the [[European Union]], [[Digital Signature Standard|NIST-DSS]] in the [[United States|USA]] or [[ZertES]] in [[Switzerland]]).&lt;ref name="Cryptomathic_MajorStandardsDigSig" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rules.htm#Rule1001 |title=Federal Rules of Evidence &amp;#124; Federal Rules of Evidence &amp;#124; LII / Legal Information Institute |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electronic signatures are a legal concept distinct from [[digital signature]]s, a cryptographic mechanism often used to implement electronic signatures. While an electronic signature can be as simple as a name entered in an electronic document, [[digital signature]]s are increasingly used in [[e-commerce]] and in regulatory filings to implement electronic signatures in a [[Cryptography|cryptographically protected]] way. Standardization agencies like [[NIST]] or [[ETSI]] provide standards for their implementation (e.g., [[Digital Signature Algorithm|NIST-DSS]], [[XAdES]] or [[PAdES]]).&lt;ref name=Cryptomathic_MajorStandardsDigSig&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn|title=Major Standards and Compliance of Digital Signatures - A World-Wide Consideration|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/major-standards-and-compliance-of-digital-signatures-a-world-wide-consideration|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CryptomathicDigSigServicesAshiqJA&gt;{{cite web|last1=JA|first1=Ashiq|title=Recommendations for Providing Digital Signature Services|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/recommendations-for-providing-digital-signature-services|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept itself is not new, with common law jurisdictions having recognized [[telegraph]] signatures as far back as the mid-19th century and faxed signatures since the 1980s.

==Description==
An electronic signature is intended to provide a secure and accurate identification method for the signatory to provide a seamless transaction.
Definitions of electronic signatures vary depending on the applicable [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]]. A common denominator in most countries is the level of an [[advanced electronic signature]] requiring that:
# The [[signature|signatory]] can be uniquely identified and linked to the signature
# The signatory must have sole control of the [[Public-key cryptography|private key]] that was used to create the electronic signature
# The signature must be capable of identifying if its accompanying data has been tampered with after the message was signed
# In the event that the accompanying data has been changed, the signature must be invalidated&lt;ref name="Turner-AdvancedESig" /&gt;

Electronic signatures may be created with increasing levels of security, with each having its own set of requirements and means of creation on various levels that prove the validity of the signature. To provide an even stronger [[Relevance (law)|probative value]] than the above described advanced electronic signature, some countries like the European Union or Switzerland introduced the qualified electronic signature. It is difficult to challenge the authorship of a statement signed with a [[qualified electronic signature]] - the statement is [[non-repudiation|non-reputable]].&lt;ref name="Turner-Understanding-eIDAS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=Understanding eIDAS|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/understanding-eidas|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Technically, a qualified electronic signature is implemented through an advanced electronic signature that utilizes a digital certificate, which has been encrypted through a security signature-creating device &lt;ref name="Turner-QualifiedElectronicSignature"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=QUALIFIED ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES FOR EIDAS|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/qualified-electronic-signatures-for-eidas|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which has been authenticated by a [[Qualified_electronic_signature#Qualified_Trust_Service_Providers|qualified trust service provider]].&lt;ref name="Turner-TSPs"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=Trust Service Providers according to eIDAS|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/trust-service-providers-according-to-eidas|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In contract law==
Since well before the [[American Civil War]] began in 1861, [[morse code]] was used to send messages electrically by telegraphy. Some of these messages were agreements to terms that were intended as enforceable [[contract]]s. An early acceptance of the enforceability of telegraphic messages as electronic signatures came from the [[New Hampshire Supreme Court]] in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crawls-wm.us.archive.org/katrina/20051022073309/http://www.cato.org/speeches/sp-ss031799.html#1b |title=Privacy Issues In Federal Systems: A Constitutional Perspective |publisher=Crawls-wm.us.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, many companies and even some individuals began using fax machines for high-priority or time-sensitive delivery of documents. Although the original signature on  the original document was on paper, the image of the signature and its transmission was electronic.&lt;ref name="ib"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isaacbowman.com/the-history-of-electronic-signature-laws |title=The History of Electronic Signature Laws |publisher=Isaac Bowman |date= |accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Courts in various jurisdictions have decided that enforceable electronic signatures can include agreements made by email, entering a [[personal identification number]] (PIN) into a bank [[Automated teller machine|ATM]], signing a credit or debit slip with a digital pen pad device (an application of [[graphics tablet]] technology) at a [[point of sale]], installing software with a [[clickwrap]] [[software license agreement]] on the package, and signing electronic documents online.

The first agreement signed electronically by two sovereign nations was a Joint Communiqué recognizing the growing importance of the promotion of electronic commerce, signed by the United States and Ireland in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asil.org/ilib/ilib0104.htm#04 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316083906/http://www.asil.org/ilib/ilib0104.htm#04 |date=March 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enforceability ===
In 1996 the United Nations published the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncitral.org/pdf/english/texts/electcom/05-89450_Ebook.pdf |format=PDF |title=UNCITRAL : Model Law on Electronic Commerce with Guide to Enactment 1996 |publisher=Uncitral.org |accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 7 of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce was highly influential in the development of electronic signature laws around the world, including in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unidroit.org/english/publications/review/articles/2000-4-gabriel-e.pdf|title=The New United States Uniform Electronic Transactions Act: Substantive Provisions, Drafting History and Comparison to the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce|last1=Gabriel |first1=Henry |publisher=International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT) |accessdate=30 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, UNCITRAL concluded work on a dedicated text, the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Signatures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncitral.org/pdf/english/texts/electcom/ml-elecsig-e.pdf |format=PDF |title=UNCITRAL : Model Law on Electronic Signatures with Guide to Enactment 2001 |publisher=Uncitral.org |accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been adopted in some 30 jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/electronic_commerce/2001Model_status.html |title=Status |publisher=Uncitral.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest UNCITRAL text dealing with electronic signatures is article 9, paragraph 3 of the [[United Nations Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts]], 2005, which establishes a mechanism for functional equivalence between electronic and handwritten signatures at the international level as well as for the cross-border recognition.

Canadian law ([[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act|PIPEDA]]) attempts to clarify the situation by first defining a generic electronic signature as "a signature that consists of one or more letters, characters, numbers or other symbols in digital form incorporated in, attached to or associated with an electronic document", then defining a secure electronic signature as an electronic signature with specific properties. PIPEDA's secure electronic signature regulations refine the definition as being a digital signature applied and verified in a specific manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showtdm/cr/SOR-2005-30//?showtoc=&amp;instrumentnumber=SOR-2005-30 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605050917/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showtdm/cr/SOR-2005-30//?showtoc=&amp;instrumentnumber=SOR-2005-30 |date=June 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the European Union, EU [[Regulation (European Union)|Regulation]] No 910/2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the European [[internal market]] ([[eIDAS]]) sets the legal frame for electronic signatures. It repeals [[Directive (European Union)|Directive]] 1999/93/EC.&lt;ref name="eIDAS_Reference" /&gt; The current and applicable version of eIDAS was published by the [[European Parliament]] and the [[European Council]] on July 23, 2014. Following Article 25 (1) of the eIDAS regulation, an [[advanced electronic signature]] shall “not be denied legal effect and admissibility as evidence in legal proceedings". However it will reach a higher [[Relevance (law)|probative value]] when enhanced to the level of a [[qualified electronic signature]]. By requiring the use of a [[Secure signature creation device|qualified electronic signature creation device]]&lt;ref&gt;eIDAS regulation Article 3 (12)&lt;/ref&gt; and being based on a certificate that has been issued by a qualified trust service provider, the upgraded advanced signature then carries according to Article 25 (2) of the eIDAS Regulation the same legal value as a handwritten signature.&lt;ref name="eIDAS_Reference" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner-AdvancedESig"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=Advanced Electronic Signatures for eIDAS|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/advanced-electronic-signatures|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is only regulated in the European Union and similarly through [[ZertES]] in [[Switzerland]]. A qualified electronic signature is not defined in the United States.&lt;ref name="TurnerDSS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tuner|first1=Dawn M.|title=Is the NIST Digital Signature Standard DSS legally binding?|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/is-the-nist-digital-signature-standard-dss-legally-binding|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DSS-Ref"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Information Technology Laboratory National Institute of Standards and Technology|title=FEDERAL INFORMATION PROCESSING STANDARDS  PUBLICATION (FIPS PUB 186 -4): Digital Signature Standard (DSS)|url=http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-4.pdf|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Code defines an '''electronic signature''' for the purpose of US law as "an electronic sound, symbol, or process, attached to or logically associated with a contract or other record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record."&lt;ref name="US ESIGN Act of 2000"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=106_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ229.106.pdf |format=PDF |title=Public Law 106-229 : June 30, 2000 : Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce act |publisher=Frwebgate.access.gpo.gov |accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be an electronic transmission of the document which contains the signature, as in the case of [[facsimile]] transmissions, or it may be encoded message, such as [[telegraphy]] using [[Morse code]].

In the United States, the definition of what qualifies as an electronic signature is wide and is set out in the [[Uniform Electronic Transactions Act]] ("UETA") released by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/ulc/fnact99/1990s/ueta99.htm |title=Biddle Law Library: Library: • Penn Law |publisher=Law.upenn.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was influenced by [[American Bar Association|ABA]] committee white papers and the uniform law promulgated by NCCUSL. Under UETA, the term means "an electronic sound, symbol, or process, attached to or logically associated with a record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record." This definition and many other core concepts of UETA are echoed in the U.S. [[Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act|ESign Act]] of 2000.&lt;ref name="US ESIGN Act of 2000"/&gt; 47 US states, the District of Columbia, and the US Virgin Islands have enacted UETA.&lt;ref name="nccusl.org"&gt;[http://www.nccusl.org/Update/uniformact_factsheets/uniformacts-fs-ueta.asp]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115172742/http://www.nccusl.org/Update/uniformact_factsheets/uniformacts-fs-ueta.asp |date=January 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only New York, Washington State, and Illinois have not enacted UETA,&lt;ref name="nccusl.org"/&gt; but each of those states has adopted its own electronic signatures statute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cio.ny.gov/Policy/ESRA/esra.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506185818/http://www.cio.ny.gov/Policy/ESRA/esra.htm |date=May 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=19.34 |title=Chapter 19.34 RCW: WASHINGTON ELECTRONIC AUTHENTICATION ACT |publisher=Apps.leg.wa.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=89&amp;ChapterID=2 |title=5 ILCS 175/ Electronic Commerce Security Act |publisher=Ilga.gov |date=2003-10-17 |accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal definitions===

=== Digital signature ===
{{further|Digital signature}}
[[Image:Digital Signature diagram.svg|thumb|right|280px|A diagram showing how a digital signature is applied and then verified.]]
[[Digital signature]]s are [[Cryptography|cryptographic]] implementations of '''electronic signatures''' used as a proof of [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]], [[data integrity]] and [[non-repudiation]] of communications conducted over the [[Internet]]. When implemented in compliance to digital signature standards, digital signing should offer end-to-end privacy with the signing process being user-friendly and secure. Digital signatures are generated and verified through standardized frameworks such as the [[Digital Signature Algorithm]] (DSA).&lt;ref name=CryptomathicDigSigServicesAshiqJA /&gt;&lt;ref name="NIST_DigitalSignatureStandardDSS" /&gt; by [[NIST]] or in compliance to the [[XAdES]], [[PAdES]] or [[CAdES (computing)|CAdES]] standards, specified by the [[ETSI]].&lt;ref name="Turner_Diff-Electronic-Digital-Sig"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE AND A DIGITAL SIGNATURE|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/the-difference-between-an-electronic-signature-and-a-digital-signature|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are typically three algorithms involved with the digital signature process:
* Key generation – This algorithm provides a private key along with its corresponding public key.
* Signing – This algorithm produces a signature upon receiving a private key and the message that is being signed.
* Verification – This algorithm checks for the authenticity of the message by verifying it along with the signature and public key.&lt;ref name="Turner-what-is-a-digsig"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn|title=What is a digital signature - what it does, how it work|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/what-is-a-digital-signature-what-it-does-how-it-works|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of digital signing requires that the signature generated by both the fixed message and private key can then be authenticated by its accompanied public key. Using these cryptographic algorithms, the user’s signature cannot be replicated without having access to their private key.&lt;ref name="Turner-what-is-a-digsig" /&gt; A [[secure channel]] is not typically required. By applying asymmetric cryptography methods, the digital signature process prevents several common attacks where the attacker attempts to gain access through the following attack methods.&lt;ref name=Cryptomathic_WHATISADIGITALSIGNATURE&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn|title=What is a Digital Signature - What  It Does, How It Works|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/what-is-a-digital-signature-what-it-does-how-it-works|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most relevant standards on digital signatures with respect to size of domestic markets are the [[Digital Signature Algorithm|Digital Signature Standard (DSS)]]&lt;ref name=NIST_DigitalSignatureStandardDSS&gt;{{cite web|title=FIPS PUB 186-4: Digital Signature Standard (DSS)|url=http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-4.pdf|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) and the [[eIDAS]] Regulation&lt;ref name=eIDAS_Reference&gt;{{cite web|title=REGULATION (EU) No 910/2014 of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG|publisher=THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; enacted by the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref name=Cryptomathic_MajorStandardsDigSig /&gt;  [[OpenPGP]] is a non-proprietary protocol for email encryption through [[public key cryptography]]. It is supported by [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] and [[GnuPG]], and some of the [[S/MIME]] [[IETF]] standards and has evolved into the most popular email encryption standard in the world.&lt;ref name=OpenPGPAllianceReference&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to The OpenPGP Alliance|url=http://openpgp.org|publisher=OpenPGP Alliance|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biometric signature===

Electronic signature may also refer to electronic forms of processing or verifying identity through use of biometric "signatures" or biologically identifying qualities of an individual. Such signatures use the approach of attaching some biometric measurement, or hash of said measurement, to a document as evidence. For instance, fingerprints, hand geometry (finger lengths and palm size), iris patterns, or even retinal patterns. All of these are collected using electronic sensors of some kind. Since each of these physical characteristics has claims to uniqueness among humans, each is to some extent useful as a signature.&lt;ref name="ManikpuriBiometric17"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qrw6DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20 |title=Biometric Security Systems for Beginner |author=Manikpuri, M.M. |publisher=Educreation Publishing |pages=20–26 |year=2017 |isbn=9781545708323 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biometric measurements of this type are useless as [[passwords]], as they can't be changed if compromised. However, they might be serviceable as electronic signatures of a kind, except that to date they have been so easily spoofable that they can carry little assurance that the person who purportedly signed a document was actually the person who did.  Unfortunately, each is easily spoofable by a replay of the electronic signal produced and submitted to the computer system responsible for 'affixing' a signature to a document. Wiretapping techniques often suffice for this. In the particular case of fingerprints, a Japanese professor and some graduate students managed to spoof all of the commercially available fingerprint readers available to them with some ordinary kitchen chemistry ([[gummy bear]] candy gel) and a little ingenuity. No actual fingers were needed to successfully spoof every reading device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |citeseerx=10.1.1.100.8172 |title=Impact of artificial gummy fingers on fingerprint systems |author=Matsumoto |authorlink=|date=2002|booktitle=Proceedings of SPIE |pages=275–289}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another example, researchers in Vietnam successfully demonstrated in late 2017 how a specially crafted mask could beat [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] [[Face ID]] program on iPhone X.&lt;ref name="BkavBkav17"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bkav.com/news-in-focus/-/view_content/content/103968/bkav%E2%80%99s-new-mask-beats-face-id-in-twin-way-severity-level-raised-do-not-use-face-id-in-business-transactions |title=Bkav’s new mask beats Face ID in "twin way": Severity level raised, do not use Face ID in business transactions |work=News In Focus |publisher=Bkav Corporation |date=27 November 2017 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Graphic design''' is the process of visual communication and problem-solving through the use of [[typography]], [[photography]] and [[illustration]]. The field is considered a subset of [[visual communication]] and [[communication design]], but sometimes the term "graphic [[design]]" is used synonymously. Graphic designers create and combine symbols, images and text to form visual representations of ideas and messages. They use [[typography]], [[visual arts]] and [[page layout]] techniques to create [[Composition (visual arts)|visual compositions]]. Common uses of graphic design include [[corporate design]] (logos and branding), editorial design (magazines, newspapers and books), [[wayfinding|wayfinding or environmental design]], [[advertising]], [[web design]], [[communication design]], product [[Packaging and labeling|packaging]] and [[signage]].

==History==
{{Main article|History of graphic design}}
[[Image:KellsFol114vTuncDicit.gif|thumb|Page from the [[Book of Kells]]: Folio 114v, Decorated text. ''Tunc dicit illis'']]The term graphic design was coined by [[William Addison Dwiggins]] in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Johanna and McVarish, Emily, 'Graphic Design History: A critical Guide'. [[Pearson Education]], 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, the origins of graphic design can be traced from the origins of human existence, from the caves of [[Lascaux]], to Rome's [[Trajan's Column]] to the [[illuminated manuscript]]s of the Middle Ages, to the neon lights of [[Ginza]], [[Tokyo]]. In "Babylon, artisans pressed cuneiform inscriptions into clay bricks or tablets which were used for construction. The bricks gave information such as the name of the reigning monarch, the builder, or some other dignitary".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Advertising In America|last = Ulanoff|first = Stanley M.|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first known road sign announcing the name of the governor of a state or mayor of the city. The Egyptians developed communication by hieroglyphics that used picture symbols dating as far back as 136 B.C. found on the [[Rosetta Stone]]. "The Rosetta stone, found by one of Napoleon's engineers was an advertisement for the Egyptian ruler, Ptolemy as the "true Son of the Sun, the Father of the Moon, and the Keeper of the Happiness of Men"" &lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The Egyptians also invented [[papyrus]], paper made from reeds found along the Nile, on which they transcribed advertisements more common among their people at the time. During the "[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]", from 500 &lt;small&gt;AD&lt;/small&gt; to 1450 &lt;small&gt;AD&lt;/small&gt;, monks created elaborate, illustrated manuscripts.

In both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of [[visual communication]] in the 20th and 21st centuries, the distinction between [[advertising]], art, graphic design and [[fine art]] has disappeared. They share many elements, theories, principles, practices, [[language]]s and sometimes the same benefactor or client. In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic design, "the essence is to give order to information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts that document human experience."&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, Philip B., 'A history of graphic design'. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

Graphic design in the United States began with [[Benjamin Franklin]] who used his newspaper ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette|The Pennsylvania Gazette]]'', to master the art of publicity to promote his own books and to influence the masses. "Benjamin Franklin's ingenuity gained in strength as did his cunning and in 1737 he had replaced his counterpart in Pennsylvania, [[Andrew Bradford]] as postmaster and printer after a competition he instituted and won. He showed his prowess by running an ad in his ''General Magazine and the Historical Chronicle of British Plantations in America'' (the precursor to the [[The Saturday Evening Post|Saturday Evening Post]]) that stressed the benefits offered by a stove he invented, named called the ''Pennsylvania Fireplace''. His invention is still sold today and is known as ''the [[Franklin stove]]''. "&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Advertising Age. How It Was In Advertising: 1776-1976. Chicago, Illinois: Crain Books, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

American advertising initially imitated British newspapers and magazines. Advertisements were printed in scrambled type and uneven lines that made it difficult to read. Franklin better organized this by adding 14-point type for the first line of the advertisement; although later shortened and centered it, making "headlines". Franklin added illustrations, something that London printers had not attempted. Franklin was the first to utilize [[logo]]s, which were early symbols that announced such services as opticians by displaying golden spectacles. Franklin taught advertisers that the use of detail was important in marketing their products. Some advertisements ran for 10-20 lines, including color, names, varieties, and sizes of the goods that were offered.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===The advent of printing===
{{Main article|History of printing}}
During the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907) wood blocks were cut to print on textiles and later to reproduce Buddhist texts. A Buddhist scripture printed in 868 is the earliest known printed book. Beginning in the 11th century, longer scrolls and books were produced using [[movable type]] printing, making books widely available during the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279).&lt;ref&gt;" Printing" The Silk Road Foundation. Retrieved May 31, 2008. [http://www.silk-road.com/artl/printing.shtml Silk-road.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509141910/http://www.silk-road.com/artl/printing.shtml |date=2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 17th-18th century movable type was used for handbills or trade cards which were printed from wood or copper engravings. These documents announced a business and its location. English painter [[William Hogarth]] used his skill in engraving was one of the first to design for business trade.

In Mainz Germany, in 1448, [[Johann Gutenberg]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;introduced movable type using a new metal alloy for use in a [[printing press]] and opened a new era of commerce. This made graphics more readily available since mass printing dropped the price of printing material significantly. Previously, most advertising was word of mouth. In France and England, for example, [[Town crier|criers]] announced products for sale just as [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] had done.

The printing press made books more widely available. [[Aldus Manutius]] developed the book structure that became the foundation of western publication design. This era of graphic design is called [[Renaissance Humanism|Humanist]] or Old Style. Additionally, [[William Caxton]], England's first printer produced religious books, but had trouble selling them. He discovered the use of leftover pages and used them to announce the books and post them on church doors. This practice was termed ''"squis"'' or ''"pin up" posters,'' in approximately 1612, becoming the first form of print advertising in Europe''.'' The term ''Siquis'' came from the Roman era when public notices were posted stating ''"if anybody..."'', which is Latin for ''"si quis"''. These printed announcements were followed by later public registers of ''wants'' called ''want ads'' and in some areas such as the first periodical in Paris advertising was termed "advices". The "Advices" were what we know today as ''want ad media'' or ''advice columns''.

In 1638 [[Harvard University]] received a printing press from England. More than 52 years passed before London bookseller [[Benjamin Harris (publisher)|Benjamin Harris]] received another printing press in Boston. Harris published a newspaper in serial form, ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'[[Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick|Publick Occurrences Both Foreign and Domestick'&lt;nowiki/&gt;]]''. It was four pages long and suppressed by the government after its first edition.

John Campbell is credited for the first newspaper, the ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'[[The Boston News-Letter|Boston News-Letter]]'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'', which appeared in 1704. The paper was known during the revolution as ''"Weeklies"''. The name came from the 13 hours required for the ink to dry on each side of the paper. ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'The solution was to first, print the ads and then to print the news on the other side the day before publication.

Campbell's first paid advertisement was in his third edition, May 7 or 8th,  1704. Two of the first ads were for stolen anvils. The third was for real estate in [[Oyster Bay (town), New York|Oyster Bay]], owned by [[William Bradford (Colonial printer)|William Bradford]], a pioneer printer in New York, and the first to sell something of value. Bradford published his first newspaper in 1725, New York's first, the [[New-York Gazette]]''. Bradford's son preceded him in Philadelphia publishing the ''[[Andrew Bradford|American Weekly Mercury]]'', 1719. ''The Mercury'' and William Brooker's ''Massachusetts Gazette'', first published a day earlier.

===Design industry===
In late 19th-century Europe, especially in the United Kingdom, the first official publication of a printed design was released, marking the separation of graphic design from fine art.

In 1849, [[Henry Cole]] became one of the major forces in [[design education]] in Great Britain, informing the government of the importance of design in his ''Journal of Design and Manufactures''. He organized the [[Great Exhibition]] as a celebration of modern industrial technology and Victorian design.

From 1891 to 1896, [[William Morris]]' Kelmscott Press published some of the most significant of the graphic design products of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], and made a lucrative business of creating and selling stylish books. Morris created a market for works of graphic design in their own right and a profession for this new type of art. The Kelmscott Press is characterized by an obsession with historical styles. This historicism was the first significant reaction to the state of nineteenth-century graphic design. Morris' work, along with the rest of the [[Private Press]] movement, directly influenced [[Art Nouveau]].&lt;ref name=mccarthy&gt;Fiona McCarthy, ''William Morris'', London: Faber and Faber, 1996 {{ISBN|0-571-17495-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "graphic design" first appeared in print in the 1922 essay "New Kind of Printing Calls for New Design" by [[William Addison Dwiggins]], an American book designer in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Johanna and McVarish, Emily, 'Graphic Design History: A critical Guide'. Pearson Education, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Raffe's ''Graphic Design'', published in 1927, was the first book to use "Graphic Design" in its title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=Steve |year=1990|title=The Sign of the Self in the Metropolis |journal=Journal of Design History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |volume= 3|jstor=1315763|issue= 4|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The signage in the [[London Underground]] is a classic design example&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Designing Modern Britain - Design Museum Exhibition | url = http://designmuseum.org/design/london-transport | accessdate = December 10, 2009 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100107205325/http://designmuseum.org/design/london-transport | archivedate = January 7, 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the modern era&lt;!-- 'The modern era' should be introduced.

In the 1920s, Soviet [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]] applied 'intellectual production' in different spheres of production. The movement saw individualistic art as useless in revolutionary Russia and thus moved towards creating objects for utilitarian purposes. They designed buildings, theater sets, posters, fabrics, clothing, furniture, logos, menus, etc.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

[[Jan Tschichold]] codified the principles of [[modern typography]] in his 1928 book, ''New Typography''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8CPmMRRx1DEC&amp;pg=PT333&amp;dq=Jan+Tschichold+codified+the+principles+of+modern+typography+in+his+1928+book,+New+Typography&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0luGFltDYAhVGLmMKHdq3B18Q6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Jan%20Tschichold%20codified%20the%20principles%20of%20modern%20typography%20in%20his%201928%20book,%20New%20Typography&amp;f=false|title=Advertising Design and Typography|last=White|first=Alex W.|date=2010-09-21|publisher=Allworth Press|isbn=9781581158205|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111150056/https://books.google.com/books?id=8CPmMRRx1DEC&amp;pg=PT333&amp;dq=Jan+Tschichold+codified+the+principles+of+modern+typography+in+his+1928+book,+New+Typography&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0luGFltDYAhVGLmMKHdq3B18Q6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Jan%20Tschichold%20codified%20the%20principles%20of%20modern%20typography%20in%20his%201928%20book,%20New%20Typography&amp;f=false|archivedate=2018-01-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later repudiated the philosophy he espoused in this book as fascistic, but it remained influential.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Tschichold, [[Bauhaus]] typographers such as [[Herbert Bayer]] and [[László Moholy-Nagy]] and [[El Lissitzky]] greatly influenced graphic design.

The following years saw graphic design in the modern style gain widespread acceptance and application.&lt;ref&gt;Crouch, Christopher. 2000. ''Modernism in Art Design and Architecture'', New York: [[St. Martins Press]]. {{ISBN|0-312-21830-3}} (cloth) {{ISBN|0-312-21832-X}} (pbk)&lt;/ref&gt; The post-World War II American economy revealed a greater need for graphic design, mainly in advertising and packaging. The spread of the German [[Bauhaus]] school of design to Chicago in 1937 brought a "mass-produced" minimalism to America; sparking "modern" [[architecture]] and design. Notable names in mid-century modern design include [[Adrian Frutiger]], designer of the [[typeface]]s [[Univers]] and [[Frutiger (typeface)|Frutiger]]; [[Paul Rand]], who took the principles of the Bauhaus and applied them to popular advertising and logo design, helping to create a uniquely American approach to European minimalism while becoming one of the principal pioneers of the subset of graphic design known as [[corporate identity]]; [[Alex Steinweiss]], credited with the invention of the album cover; and [[Josef Müller-Brockmann]], who designed posters in a severe yet accessible manner typical of the 1950s and 1970s era.

The professional graphic design industry grew in parallel with [[consumerism]]. This raised concerns and criticisms, notably from within the graphic design community with the [[First Things First 1964 manifesto|First Things First manifesto]]. First launched by [[Ken Garland]] in 1964, it was re-published as the [[First Things First 2000 manifesto]] in 1999 in the magazine ''[[Emigre (magazine)|Emigre]]'' 51&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=1&amp;id=14 |title=฿Emigre Essays |publisher=Emigre.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106152041/http://emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=1&amp;id=14 |archivedate=2012-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; stating "We propose a reversal of priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic forms of communication - a mindshift away from product marketing and toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning. The scope of debate is shrinking; it must expand. Consumerism is running uncontested; it must be challenged by other perspectives expressed, in part, through the visual languages and resources of design."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://maxbruinsma.nl/index1.html?ftf2000.htm |title=max bruinsma |publisher=Maxbruinsma.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219160927/http://maxbruinsma.nl/index1.html?ftf2000.htm |archivedate=2011-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both editions attracted signatures from practitioners and thinkers such as [[Rudy VanderLans]], [[Erik Spiekermann]], [[Ellen Lupton]] and [[Rick Poynor]]. The 2000 manifesto was also published in [[Adbusters]], known for its strong critiques of visual culture.

==Applications==
[[File:Secretary.jpg|thumb|[[Colour]]]]
Graphic design is applied to everything visual, from [[Traffic sign|road signs]] to technical schematics, from interoffice [[memorandum]]s to reference [[User guide|manuals]].

Design can aid in selling a [[Product (business)|product]] or [[idea]]. It is applied to products and elements of company identity such as [[logo]]s, colors, [[packaging]] and text as part of [[brand]]ing (see also [[advertising]]). Branding has become increasingly more important in the range of services offered by graphic designers. Graphic designers often form part of a branding team.

Graphic design is applied in the [[entertainment]] industry in decoration, scenery and visual story telling. Other examples of design for entertainment purposes include novels, vinyl [[album cover]]s, comic books, DVD covers, [[opening credits]] and [[closing credits]] in [[filmmaking]], and programs and props on stage. This could also include artwork used for T-shirts and other items screenprinted for sale.

From scientific journals to news reporting, the presentation of opinion and facts is often improved with graphics and thoughtful compositions of visual information - known as [[information design]]. Newspapers, magazines, blogs, television and film documentaries may use graphic design. With the advent of the web, information designers with experience in interactive tools are increasingly used to illustrate the background to news stories. Information design can include [[data visualization]], which involves using programs to interpret and form data into a visually compelling presentation, and can be tied in with [[information graphics]].

==Skills==
A graphic design project may involve the stylization and presentation of existing [[writing|text]] and either preexisting [[image]]ry or images developed by the graphic designer. Elements can be incorporated in both traditional and digital form, which involves the use of visual arts, typography, and page layout techniques. Graphic designers organize pages and optionally add graphic elements. Graphic designers can commission photographers or illustrators to create original pieces. Designers use digital tools, often referred to as [[interactive design]], or [[multimedia]] design. Designers need communication skills to convince an audience and sell their designs.

The "process school" is concerned with communication; it highlights the channels and media through which messages are transmitted and by which senders and receivers encode and decode these message. The semiotic school treats a message as a construction of signs which through interaction with receivers, produces meaning; communication as an agent.

===Typography===
{{Main article|Typography}}

Typography includes type design, modifying type [[glyphs]] and arranging type. Type glyphs (characters) are created and modified using illustration techniques. Type arrangement is the selection of typefaces, point size, tracking (the space between all characters used), kerning (the space between two specific characters) and leading (line spacing).

Typography is performed by typesetters, compositors, typographers, graphic artists, art directors and clerical workers. Until the digital age, typography was a specialized occupation. Certain fonts communicate or resemble stereotypical notions. For example 1942 Report is a font which types text akin to a typewriter or a vintage report.&lt;ref&gt;Butterick, Matthew. "Butterick's Practical Typography." Butterick's Practical Typography. Jones McClure, 2010-14. Web. 17 Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Page layout===
{{Main article|Page layout}}
[[File:Golden section in book design.svg|thumb|Golden section in book design]]
Page layout deals with the arrangement of elements (content) on a page, such as image placement, text layout and style. Page design has always been a consideration in printed material and more recently extended to displays such as web pages. Elements typically consist of [[typography|type]] (text), [[image]]s (pictures), and (with print media) occasionally place-holder graphics such as a [[dieline]] for elements that are not printed with ink such as [[Die (manufacturing)|die]]/[[laser cutting]], [[foil stamping]] or [[Embossing (paper)|blind embossing]].

===Printmaking===
{{Main article|Printmaking}}

Printmaking is the process of making artworks by printing on [[paper]] and other materials or surfaces. The process is capable of producing multiples of the same work, each called a print. Each print is an original, technically known as an impression. Prints are created from a single original surface, technically a matrix. Common types of matrices include: plates of metal, usually copper or zinc for engraving or etching; stone, used for lithography; blocks of wood for woodcuts, linoleum for linocuts and fabric plates for screen-printing. Works printed from a single plate create an edition, in modern times usually each signed and numbered to form a limited edition. Prints may be published in book form, as artist's books. A single print could be the product of one or multiple techniques.[[Image:Pencils hb.jpg|thumb|The [[pencil]] is one of the most basic graphic design tools.]]

Aside from technology, graphic design requires [[judgment]] and [[creativity]]. Critical, observational, quantitative and analytic thinking are required for design layouts and [[artistic rendering|rendering]]. If the executor is merely following a solution (e.g. sketch, script or instructions) provided by another designer (such as an [[art director]]), then the executor is not usually considered the designer.

==Tools==
The method of presentation (e.g. Arrangements, style, medium) is important to the design. The development and presentation tools can change how an audience perceives a project. The image or layout is produced using [[media (arts)|traditional media]] and [[technical drawing tools|guides]], or [[digital image editing]] tools on computers. Tools in [[computer graphics]] often take on traditional names such as "scissors" or "[[pen]]". Some graphic design tools such as a [[Grid (graphic design)|grid]] are used in both traditional and digital form.

In the mid-1980s [[desktop publishing]] and [[graphic art software]] applications introduced computer image manipulation and creation capabilities that had previously been manually executed. Computers enabled designers to instantly see the effects of layout or typographic changes, and to simulate the effects of traditional media. Traditional tools such as [[pencil]]s can be useful even when computers are used for finalization; a designer or art director may sketch numerous concepts as part of the [[creative process]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacci Howard Bear, [http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/basic/a/thumbnails.htm?terms=squiggle desktoppub.about.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206171848/http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/basic/a/thumbnails.htm?terms=squiggle |date=2013-12-06 }} Retrieved 2008-03-19&lt;/ref&gt; Styluses can be used with tablet computers to capture hand drawings digitally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/6986303 Milton Glaser Draws &amp; Lectures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321100020/http://vimeo.com/6986303 |date=2014-03-21 }}. retrieved 31-01-2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computers and software===
Designers disagree whether computers enhance the creative process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1030.0.html Designtalkboard.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629214914/http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1030.0.html |date=2007-06-29 }}, topic 1030 and [http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1441.msg6356.html#msg6356 Designtalkboard.com], topic 1141. retrieved 3-18-2007&lt;/ref&gt; Some designers argue that computers allow them to explore multiple ideas quickly and in more detail than can be achieved by hand-rendering or [[paste up|paste-up]].&lt;ref&gt;Jann Lawrence Pollard and Jerry James Little, ''Creative Computer Tools for Artists: Using Software to Develop Drawings and Paintings,'' November 2001 Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; While other designers find the limitless choices from digital design can lead to paralysis or endless iterations with no clear outcome.

Most designers use a hybrid process that combines traditional and computer-based technologies. First, hand-rendered [[Comprehensive layout|layouts]] are used to get approval to execute an idea, then the polished visual product is produced on a computer.

Graphic designers are expected to be proficient in software programs for image-making, typography and layout. Nearly all of the popular and "industry standard" software programs used by graphic designers since the early 1990s are products of [[Adobe Systems]] Incorporated. [[Adobe Photoshop]] (a [[Raster scan|raster]]-based program for photo editing) and [[Adobe Illustrator]] (a vector-based program for drawing) are often used in the final stage. Designers often use pre-designed [[Raster graphics|raster images]] and [[vector graphics]] in their work from online design databases. Raster images may be edited in Adobe Photoshop, logos and illustrations in Adobe Illustrator, and the final product assembled in one of the major page layout programs, such as [[Adobe InDesign]], [[PagePlus|Serif PagePlus]] and [[QuarkXPress|QuarkXpress]]. Powerful open-source programs (which are free) are also used by both professionals and casual users for graphic design. These include [[Inkscape]] (for vector graphics), [[GIMP]] (for photo-editing and image manipulation), [[Krita]] (for painting) and [[Scribus]] (for page layout).

==Related design fields==
===Interface design===
{{Main article|User interface design}}
Since the advent of personal computers, many graphic designers have become involved in [[interface design]], in an environment commonly referred to as a [[Graphical user interface|Graphical User Interface]] (GUI). This has included [[web design]] and [[software design]], when [[end user]] [[interactivity]] is a design consideration of the layout or interface. Combining visual communication skills with an understanding of user interaction and online branding, graphic designers often work with [[software developer]]s and [[web developer]]s to create the [[look and feel]] of a web site or [[software application]]. An important aspect of interface design is [[icon design]].

===User experience design===
{{Main article|User experience design}}
User experience design is the study, analysis, and development of a person's interaction with a company or its products.

===Experiential graphic design===
{{Main article|Environmental Graphic Design}}

Experiential graphic design is the application of communication skills to the built environment. This area of graphic design requires practitioners to understand physical installations that have to be manufactured and withstand the same environmental conditions as buildings. As such, it is a cross-disciplinary collaborative process involving designers, fabricators, city planners, architects, manufacturers and construction teams.

Experiential graphic designers try to solve problems that people encounter while interacting with buildings and space. Examples of practice areas for environmental graphic designers are [[wayfinding]], [[placemaking]], branded environments, exhibitions and museum displays, public installations and digital environments.

==Occupations==
{{Main article|Graphic design occupations}}

Graphic design career paths cover all parts of the [[creative industries|creative spectrum]] and often overlap. Workers perform specialized tasks, such as design services, publishing, advertising and public relations. As of 2017, median pay was $48,700 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm|title=Graphic Designers: Occupational Outlook Handbook: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bls.gov|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=no|access-date=2018-06-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main job titles within the industry are often country specific. They can include [[graphic designer]], art director, [[creative director]], [[animator]] and entry level [[production artist]]. Depending on the industry served, the responsibilities may have different titles such as "[[DTP associate|DTP Associate]]" or "[[Graphic Artist]]". The responsibilities may involve specialized skills such as [[illustration]], [[photography]], [[animation]] or [[interactive design]].

Employment in design of online projects was expected to increase by 35% by 2026, while employment in traditional media, such as newspaper and book design, expect to go down by 22%. Graphic designers will be expected to constantly learn new techniques, programs, and methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm#tab-6|title=Graphic Designers :     Occupational Outlook Handbook: :     U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-10-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027215647/https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm#tab-6|archivedate=2017-10-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graphic designers can work within companies devoted specifically to the industry, such as design consultancies or branding agencies, others may work within publishing, marketing or other communications companies. Especially since the introduction of personal computers, many graphic designers work as in-house designers in non-design oriented organizations.  Graphic designers may also work [[Freelancer|freelance]], working on their own terms, prices, ideas, etc.

A graphic designer typically reports to the [[art director]], [[creative director]] or [[senior media creative]]. As a designer becomes more senior, they spend less time designing and more time leading and directing other designers on broader creative activities, such as [[brand]] development and [[corporate identity]] development. They are often expected to interact more directly with clients, for example taking and interpreting briefs.

===Crowdsourcing in graphic design===
{{Main article|Crowdsourcing creative work}}
Jeff Howe of ''[[Wired Magazine]]'' first used the term "[[crowdsourcing]]" in his 2006 article, "The Rise of Crowdsourcing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Howe|first=Jeff|title=The Rise of Crowdsourcing|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=4&amp;topic=crowds&amp;topic_set=|publisher=WIRED Magazine|accessdate=24 October 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209044356/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=4&amp;topic=crowds&amp;topic_set=|archivedate=9 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilmour|first=Julia|title=The Long History of Crowdsourcing – and Why You’re Just Now Hearing About It|url=http://www.crowdsource.com/blog/2013/08/the-long-history-of-crowdsourcing-and-why-youre-just-now-hearing-about-it/|publisher=Crowdsource.com|accessdate=24 October 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829172727/http://www.crowdsource.com/blog/2013/08/the-long-history-of-crowdsourcing-and-why-youre-just-now-hearing-about-it/|archivedate=29 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It spans such creative domains as graphic design, architecture, apparel design, writing, illustration etc. Tasks may be assigned to individuals or a group and may be categorized as convergent or divergent. An example of a divergent task is generating alternative designs for a poster. An example of a convergent task is selecting one poster design.

'''Hebrew Braille''' ({{lang-he|ברייל עברי}}) is the [[braille]] alphabet for [[Hebrew]]. The International Hebrew Braille Code is widely used. It was devised in the 1930s and completed in 1944. It is based on [[unified international braille|international norms]], with additional letters devised to accommodate differences between [[English Braille]] and the [[Hebrew alphabet]].&lt;ref name=Candle/&gt; Unlike Hebrew, but in keeping with other braille alphabets, Hebrew Braille is read from left to right instead of right to left.,&lt;ref name="MackenzieMackenzie1954"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mackenzie|first1=Clutha Nantes|author2=Sir Clutha Nantes Mackenzie|title=World Braille Usage: a survey of efforts towards uniformity of braille notation|year=1954|publisher=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; and unlike English Braille, it is a [[Abjad]], all consonants.

==History==
Prior to the 1930s, there were several regional variations of Hebrew Braille, but no universal system.&lt;ref name=Candle&gt;{{cite news | title = I Shall Light a Candle | last = Okin | first = Tessie | date = August 15, 1952 | accessdate = October 19, 2010 | work = Canadian Jewish Chronicle | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5rMqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PGEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6631,2004612&amp;dq=jewish-braille-institute&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, the [[JBI International|Jewish Braille Institute of America]] assembled an international panel to attempt to produce a unified code. Among the greater challenges faced by the panel was the accommodation of the Hebrew vowel points. The panel completed its first iteration of the International Hebrew Braille Code in 1936,&lt;ref name=Candle/&gt; the same year in which the first Hebrew Braille book was published with sponsorship from the [[Library of Congress]]: a volume of excerpts from the ''[[Talmud]]'' and other sources.&lt;ref name="Blumenthal1969"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blumenthal|first=Walter Hart|title=Bookmen's Bedlam: an Olio of Literary Oddities|year=1969|publisher=Ayer Publishing|isbn=978-0-8369-1022-3|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; The code underwent further refinements for the better part of a decade until its completion in 1944.&lt;ref name=Candle/&gt;

==Basic alphabet==
Because Hebrew Braille derives from English Braille, there is not a one-to-one match between Hebrew letters in print and in braille.  Most obviously, four consonants with the ''[[dagesh]]'' point in print have distinct letters in braille, but three others require a ''dagesh'' prefix {{bc|45}} in braille.  The different placements of the dot on the print letter ''shin'' also correspond to two different letters in braille.  On the other hand, the distinct final forms of some letters in print are not reflected in braille.

In the table below, the braille letters corresponding to basic letters in print are in the top row, while those derived by pointing in print, and which have a distinct pronunciation in Modern Hebrew, are in the second row.

|}

For other pointed print consonants, such as ''gimel'' with ''dagesh'' {{hebrew|גּ}}, the braille prefix is used:  {{bc|45|g}}.  Historically, this sequence has two values: a 'hard' gee {{IPA|[ɡ]}} (cf. plain ''gimel'' {{bc|g}} {{IPA|[ɣ]}}), and a double/long gee {{IPA|[ɡː]}}.  However, it is not distinct in Modern Hebrew.  It is not clear if the prefix can be added to letters that have partners in the bottom row of the table above to distinguish, say, dagesh hazak ''kk'' from dagesh kal ''k'', or ''ww'' from ''û''.

When transcribing completely unpointed print texts, only the top row of braille letters is used.

==Vowel pointing==
Apart from those written with {{hebrew|ו}} and {{hebrew|י}} and thus obligatory in print, vowels are optional in braille just as they are in print.  When they are written, braille vowels are full letters rather than diacritics.

|}

Print digraphs with {{hebrew|אְ}} schwa ({{hebrew|אֱ}} ''ĕ'', {{hebrew|אֲ}} ''ă'', {{hebrew|אֳ}} ''ŏ'', bottom row), and the ''[[matres lectionis]]'' ({{hebrew|וּ}} ''û'', {{hebrew|וֹ}} ''ô'', {{hebrew|יִ}} ''î'') are derived in braille by modifying (lowering or reflecting) the base vowel.  {{hebrew|יֵ}} ''ê'' does not have a dedicated braille letter, and is written as the vowel {{bc|34}} ''e'' plus {{bc|y}} yod.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18157">The '''history of [[Interlingua]]''' comprises the formation of the language itself as well as its community of speakers.

Ultimate credit for Interlingua must go to the American heiress [[Alice Vanderbilt Morris]] (1874–1950), who became interested in [[linguistics]] and the [[international auxiliary language]] movement in the early 1920s. In 1924, Morris and her husband, [[Dave Hennen Morris]], established the non-profit International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA) in [[New York City]]. Their aim was to place the study of IALs on a scientific basis.&lt;ref name="Falk, Julia S 1995"&gt;Falk, Julia S. "Words without grammar: Linguists and the international language movement in the United States, ''Language and Communication'', 15(3): pp. 241-259. Pergamon, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigations of the auxiliary language problem were in progress at the International Research Council, the American Council on Education, the American Council of Learned Societies, the British, French, Italian, and American Associations for the advancement of science, and other groups of specialists. Morris created IALA as a continuation of this work.&lt;ref name="iala1971_foreword"&gt;Bray, Mary Connell [1951] (1971), "Foreword", ''Interlingua-English: A dictionary of the international Language'', Second Edition, New York: Frederick Ungar Publishing Company. {{ISBN|0-8044-0188-8}}. OCLC 162319. Retrieved on 2007-03-05.&lt;/ref&gt; She developed the research program of IALA in consultation with [[Edward Sapir]], [[William Edward Collinson]], and [[Otto Jespersen]].&lt;ref name="Falk, Julia S 1995"/&gt;

== International Auxiliary Language Association ==

The IALA became a major supporter of mainstream American linguistics, funding, for example, Sapir's cross-linguistic semantic studies of totality (1930) and grading phenomena (1944). Morris herself edited Sapir and [[Morris Swadesh]]'s 1932 cross-linguistic study of ending-point phenomena, and Collinson's 1937 study of indication. Although the Morrises and their family provided most of IALA's funding, it also received support from such prestigious groups as the [[Carnegie Corporation]], the [[Ford Foundation]] and the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].&lt;ref name="gopsill1990"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gopsill|first=F. P.|title=International languages: a matter for Interlingua|year=1990|publisher=British Interlingua Society|location=[[Sheffield]], [[England]]|isbn=0-9511695-6-4|oclc=27813762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its early years, IALA concerned itself with three tasks: finding other organizations around the world with similar goals; building a library of books about [[language]]s and [[interlinguistics]]; and comparing extant IALs, including [[Esperanto]], [[Esperanto II]], [[Ido (language)|Ido]], [[Latino sine flexione|Peano’s Interlingua]] (Latino sine flexione), [[Novial]], and [[Occidental language|Interlingue]] (Occidental). In pursuit of the last goal, it conducted parallel studies of these languages, with comparative studies of national languages, under the direction of scholars at American and European universities.&lt;ref name="iala1971_foreword"/&gt;  It also arranged conferences with proponents of these IALs, debating features and goals of their representative languages. With a "concession rule" that required participants to make a certain number of concessions, early debates at IALA sometimes grew from heated to explosive.&lt;ref name="gopsill1990"/&gt;

At the Second International Interlanguage Congress, held in [[Geneva]] in 1931, IALA began to break new ground. Its conference was attended by recognized linguists, 27 of whom signed a testimonial of support for IALA's research program. An additional eight added their signatures at the third congress, convened in [[Rome]] in 1933.&lt;ref name="gopsill1990"/&gt;

Also in 1933, Professor [[Herbert N. Shenton]] of [[Syracuse University]] organized an intensive study of the problems encountered with interlanguages when used in international conferences. Later that same year, Dr. [[Edward L. Thorndike]] published a paper about the relative learning speeds of "natural" and "modular" constructed languages. Both Shenton and Thorndike were major influences on IALA's work from then on.&lt;ref name="iala1971_foreword"/&gt;

In 1937, the first steps towards the finalization of Interlingua were taken when a committee of 24 eminent linguists from 19 universities published ''Some Criteria for an International Language and Commentary''. However, the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939 cut short the intended biannual meetings of the committee.&lt;ref name="gopsill1990"/&gt;

==Development of a new language==
Originally, the association had not set out to create its own language. Its goal was to identify which auxiliary language already available was best suited for international communication, and how to promote it most effectively. However, after ten years of research, more and more members of IALA concluded that none of the existing [[interlanguage]]s were up to the task. By 1937, the members had made the decision to create a new language, to the surprise of the world's interlanguage community.&lt;ref name="Profunde recerca duce a un lingua"&gt;Gopsill, F. P., and Sexton, Brian, [http://www.interlingua.com/historia/diverse/historia-2.htm "Profunde recerca duce a un lingua"], ''Historia de interlingua'', 2001, revised 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

To that point, much of the debate had been equivocal on the decision to use naturalistic (e.g., [[Novial]] and [[Occidental language|Occidental]]) or systematic (e.g., [[Esperanto]] and [[Ido (language)|Ido]]) words. During the war years, proponents of a naturalistic interlanguage won out. The first support was Dr. Thorndike's paper; the second was a concession by proponents of the systematic languages that thousands of words were already present in many &amp;ndash; or even a majority &amp;ndash; of the European languages. Their argument was that systematic derivation of words was a [[Procrustes|Procrustean bed]], forcing the learner to unlearn and re-memorize a new derivation scheme when a usable vocabulary was already available. This finally convinced supporters of the systematic languages, and IALA from that point assumed the position that a naturalistic language would be best.

At the outbreak of [[World War II]], IALA's research activities were moved from Liverpool to New York, where [[Ezra Clark Stillman|E. Clark Stillman]] established a new research staff.&lt;ref name="iala1971_foreword"/&gt;  Stillman, with the assistance of Dr. [[Alexander Gode]], developed a ''prototyping'' technique &amp;ndash; an objective methodology for selecting and standardizing vocabulary based on a comparison of ''control languages''.&lt;ref name="gopsill1990"/&gt;

In 1943 Stillman left for war work and Gode became Acting Director of Research. In 1945, IALA published a ''General Report'' &amp;ndash; largely Morris's work &amp;ndash; which presented three models for IALA's language:
* Model P was a naturalistic model that made no attempt to regularize the prototyped vocabulary.
* Model E was lightly schematicized along the lines of Occidental.
* Model K was moderately schematicized along the lines of Ido (i.e., somewhat less schematicized than Esperanto).&lt;ref name="Profunde recerca duce a un lingua"/&gt;

From 1946 to 1948, the renowned French linguist [[André Martinet]] was Director of Research. During this period IALA continued to develop models and conducted polling to determine the optimal form of the final language. An initial survey gauged reactions to the three models of 1945. In 1946, IALA sent an extensive survey to more than 3,000 language teachers and related professionals on three continents.&lt;ref name="Gopsill, F. P. 2006"&gt;Gopsill, F. P., and Sexton, Brian, [http://www.interlingua.com/historia/diverse/historia-3.htm "Le natura, si &amp;ndash; un schema, no"], ''Historia de interlingua'', 2001, revised 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The four models===
Four models were canvassed: Model P and K, plus two new models similar to Model E of 1945.&lt;ref name="gopsill1990"/&gt;

{| border=0  
|- valign=top
| &amp;nbsp; || Model&amp;nbsp;P || &amp;nbsp; || highly&amp;nbsp;naturalistic || &amp;nbsp; || ''Jo habe nascite, o dea cum le oculos azure, de parentes barbare, inter le bone et virtuose Cimmerios''
|- valign=top
| &amp;nbsp; || Model&amp;nbsp;M || &amp;nbsp; || moderately&amp;nbsp;naturalistic || &amp;nbsp; ||''Io have nascit, o dea con le ocules azur, de parentes barbar, inter le bon e virtuos Cimmerios ''
|- valign=top
| &amp;nbsp; || Model&amp;nbsp;C || &amp;nbsp; || slightly&amp;nbsp;schematic || &amp;nbsp; ||''Yo ha nascet, o deessa con le ocules azur, de parentes barbar, inter le bon e virtuose Cimerios ''
|- valign=top
| &amp;nbsp; || Model&amp;nbsp;K || &amp;nbsp; || moderately&amp;nbsp;schematic || &amp;nbsp; ||''Yo naskeba, o dea kon le okuli azure, de parenti barbare, inter le bone e virtuose Kimerii ''
|- valign=top
| &amp;nbsp; || colspan=3 | (modern Interlingua) || &amp;nbsp; ||''Io ha nascite, o dea con le oculos azur, de parentes barbar, inter le bon e virtuose Cimmerios''
|- valign=top
| &amp;nbsp; || colspan=3 | (English) || &amp;nbsp; ||'I was born, O goddess with the blue eyes, of barbarian relations, among the good and virtuous Cimmerians'
|}

Model P was unchanged from 1945; Model M was relatively modern in comparison to more classical P. Model K was slightly modified in the direction of Ido.

The results of the survey were striking. The two more schematic models, C and K, were rejected &amp;ndash; K overwhelmingly. Of the two naturalistic models, M attracted somewhat more support than P. Taking national biases into account (for example, the French who were polled disproportionately favored Model M), IALA decided on a compromise between models M and P, with certain elements of C.&lt;ref name="Gopsill, F. P. 2006"/&gt;

==Finalization==
When Martinet took up a position at [[Columbia University]] in 1948, Gode took on the last phase of Interlingua's development.  His task was to combine elements of Model M and Model P; take the flaws seen in both by the polled community and repair them with elements of Model C as needed; and simultaneously develop a vocabulary.

The vocabulary and verb conjugations of Interlingua were first presented in 1951, when IALA published the finalized ''[[Interlingua: A Grammar of the International Language|Interlingua Grammar]]'' and the 27,000-word ''[[Interlingua-English Dictionary]]'' (IED). In 1954, IALA  published an introductory manual entitled ''[[Interlingua a Prime Vista]]'' ("Interlingua at First Sight").

==Success, decline, and resurgence==
 
An early practical application of Interlingua was the scientific newsletter ''Spectroscopia Molecular'', published from 1952 to 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Breinstrup, Thomas, [http://www.interlingua.com/historia/publicationes/spectroscopia.htm "Un revolution in le mundo scientific" (A revolution in the scientific world).] Accessed January 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954 Interlingua was used at the Second World Cardiological Congress, in [[Washington DC]], for both written summaries and oral interpretation. Within a few years, it found similar use at nine further medical congresses. Between the mid-1950s and the late 1970s, some thirty scientific and especially medical journals provided article summaries in Interlingua. [[Society for Science and the Public|Science Service]], the publisher of ''Science Newsletter'' at the time, published a monthly column in Interlingua from the early 1950s until Gode's death in 1970. In 1967, the powerful [[International Organization for Standardization]], which normalizes terminology, voted almost unanimously to adopt Interlingua as the basis for its dictionaries.&lt;ref name="gopsill1990"/&gt;

The [[International Auxiliary Language Association|IALA]] closed its doors in 1953 but was not formally dissolved until 1956 or later.&lt;ref name="esterhill2000"&gt;Esterhill, Frank, [http://www.interlingua.org/html/copy_of_ii-history.htm ''Interlingua Institute: A History''. New York: Interlingua Institute, 2000.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603163852/http://www.interlingua.org/html/copy_of_ii-history.htm |date=2007-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its role in promoting Interlingua was largely taken on by Science Service,&lt;ref&gt;F. P., and Sexton, B. C., [http://www.interlingua.com/historia/diverse/historia-3.htm Gopsill, "Le natura, si &amp;ndash; un schema, no".] Accessed January 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; which hired Gode as head of its newly formed [[Interlingua Division of Science Service|Interlingua Division]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interlingua.com/historia/biographias/gode.htm Biographias: Alexander Gottfried Friedrich Gode-von Aesch]. Accessed January 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hugh E. Blair]], Gode's close friend and colleague, became his assistant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interlingua.com/historia/biographias/blair.htm Biographias: Hugh Edward Blair.] Accessed January 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A successor organization, the Interlingua Institute,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interlingua.com/historia/diverse/organisationes.htm Portrait del organisationes de interlingua.] Access January 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1970 to promote Interlingua in the US and Canada. The new institute supported the work of other linguistic organizations, made considerable scholarly contributions and produced Interlingua precis for scholarly and medical publications. One of its largest achievements was two immense volumes on phytopathology produced by the American Phytopathological Society in 1976 and 1977.&lt;ref name="esterhill2000"/&gt; 

The Interlingua Institute was adrift for a while after the deaths of Blair in 1967 and Gode in 1970. According to Esterhill,&lt;ref name="esterhill2000"/&gt; however, publishing slowed only briefly in the late 1960s and revived soon afterward, at about the time of the 1971 second edition of the IED. Flourishing interest in [[Europe]] may have counterbalanced the struggles taking place in America.

Interlingua had attracted many former adherents of other international-language projects, notably [[Occidental language|Occidental]] and Ido. The former Occidentalist [[Richard Berger|Ric Berger]] founded The [[Union Mundial pro Interlingua]] ([[Union Mundial pro Interlingua|UMI]]) in 1955,&lt;ref name="interlingua.com"&gt;[http://www.interlingua.com/historia/diverse/organisationes.htm Portrait del organisationes de interlingua.] Accessed January 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and by the late 1950s, interest in Interlingua in Europe had already begun to overtake that in North America. Media coverage at the time, for example, was apparently heaviest in Northern and [[Eastern Europe]]. Frequent European coverage has continued to date, joined by media attention in [[South America]] in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interlingua.com/historia/publicationes/pressa.htm Interlingua in le pressa.] Accessed January 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Beginning in the 1980s UMI has held international conferences every two years (typical attendance at the earlier meetings was 50 to 100) and launched a publishing programme that eventually produced over 100 volumes. Other Interlingua-language works were published by university presses in [[Sweden]] and [[Italy]], and in the 1990s, [[Brazil]] and [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interlingua.com/libros/pt.htm Bibliographia de Interlingua.] Accessed January 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interlingua.com/historia/biographias/stenstrom.htm Biographias: Ingvar Stenström.] Accessed January 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[Scandinavia]]n schools undertook projects that used Interlingua as a means of teaching the international scientific and intellectual vocabulary.

In 2000, the Interlingua Institute was dissolved amid funding disputes with the UMI; the American Interlingua Society, established the following year, succeeded the institute and responded to new interest emerging in [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="interlingua.com"/&gt;

==Behind the Iron Curtain==

Interlingua was spoken and promoted in the Soviet empire, in spite of persecution and efforts to suppress information about the language. In [[East Germany]], government officials confiscated the letters and magazines that the UMI sent to Walter Raédler, the Interlingua representative there.&lt;ref&gt;"Interlingua usate in le posta". [http://www.interlingua.com/historia/diverse/stampaspostal.htm Historia de Interlingua], 2001, revised 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Július Tomin (Interlingua)|Július Tomin]] received threatening letters after his first article on Interlingua was published.&lt;ref&gt;Breinstrup, Thomas. "Persecutate pro parlar Interlingua." ''[[Panorama in Interlingua]]'', 1995, Issue 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite continuing persecution, he went on to become the Czech Interlingua representative, teach Interlingua in the school system, and author a long series of published articles and books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interlingua.com/historia/biographias/tomin.htm Biographias: Július Tomin.

==Interlingua today==
: ''See also: [[Interlingua#Community|Community of Interlingua]]''

Today, interest in Interlingua has expanded from the scientific community to the general public. Individuals, governments, and private companies use Interlingua for learning and instruction, travel, online publishing, and communication across language barriers. Interlingua is promoted internationally by the [[Union Mundial pro Interlingua]] (president: Barbara Rubinstein, Sweden; secretary-general: Petyo Angelov, [[Bulgaria]]). Periodicals and books are produced by many national organizations, such as the [[Societate American pro Interlingua]] (president: [[Stanley A. Mulaik]]), the [[Swedish Society for Interlingua|Svenska Sällskapet för Interlingua]] (secretary: Ingvar Stenström), and the [[Brazilian Union for Interlingua]] (president: Gilson Passos).

Currently, [[Panorama In Interlingua]] is the most prominent of several Interlingua periodicals. It is a 28-page magazine published bimonthly that covers current events, science, editorials, and Interlingua. Thanks to the Internet, Interlingua has seen a resurgence over the last decade, with the number of speakers jumping tenfold by some estimates.

'''Isaac Leib Peretz''' ({{lang-pl|Icchok Lejbusz Perec}}, {{lang-he-n|יצחק־לייבוש פרץ}}) (May 18, 1852 – 3 April 1915), also sometimes written '''Yitskhok Leybush Peretz''', best known as '''I. L. Peretz''', was a  [[Yiddish language]] author and playwright from [[Poland]]. Payson R. Stevens, Charles M. Levine, and [[Sol Steinmetz]] count him with [[Mendele Mokher Seforim]] and [[Sholem Aleichem]] as one of the three great classical Yiddish writers. [[Sol Liptzin]] wrote: "Yitzkhok Leibush&lt;!--sic--&gt; Peretz was the great awakener of Yiddish-speaking Jewry, and Sholom Aleichem its comforter... Peretz aroused in his readers the will for self-emancipation, the will for resistance..."

Peretz rejected cultural universalism, seeing the world as composed of different [[nation]]s, each with its own character. Liptzin comments that "Every people is seen by him as a chosen people..."; he saw his role as a Jewish writer to express "Jewish ideals...grounded in Jewish tradition and Jewish history."

Unlike many other [[Haskalah|Maskilim]], he greatly respected the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jews]] for their mode of being in the world; at the same time, he understood that there was a need to make allowances for human frailty. His [[short story|short stories]] such as "If Not Higher", "The Treasure", and "Beside the Dying" emphasize the importance of sincere piety rather than empty religiosity.

==Biography==
[[Image:Dinezon, Peretz and Sholem Aleichem.jpg|thumb|Left to right, [[Sholem Aleichem]], Peretz, and [[Yacov Dinezon]]]]
[[Image:Dinezon and Peretz.jpg|thumb|Dinezon and Peretz]]
Born in the city of [[Zamość]], [[Lublin Governorate]], [[Congress Poland]], and raised in an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] home he gave his allegiance at age fifteen to the [[Haskalah]], the Jewish enlightenment. He began a deliberate plan of secular learning, reading books in [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[German language|German]], and [[French language|French]]. He planned to go to the theologically liberal [[Rabbi]]nical school at [[Zhytomyr]], but concern for his mother's feelings got him to stay on in Zamość. He married, through an arranged marriage, the daughter of [[Gabriel Judah Lichtenfeld]], whom Liptzin describes as a "minor poet and philosopher".

He failed in an attempt to make a living distilling [[whiskey]], but began to write [[Hebrew language]] poetry, songs, and tales, some of them written with his father-in-law ; this collaboration, however, did not prevent his divorce in 1878, after which he promptly remarried (his second wife was Helena Ringelheim). At about the same time, he passed the examination to become a lawyer, a profession which he successfully pursued for the next decade, until in 1889 his license was revoked by the [[Imperial Russia]]n authorities, on the basis of suspicion of [[Poland|Polish]] [[nationalism|nationalist]] feelings. From then on he lived in [[Warsaw]], where his income came largely from a job in the small bureaucracy of the city's Jewish community. There he founded [[Hazomir]] (''The Nightingale''), which became the cultural centre of pre-World War I Yiddish Warsaw.

His first Yiddish work appeared in 1888, notably the long ballad ''Monish'', which appeared that year in the landmark anthology ''Folksbibliotek'' ("People's Library"), edited by [[Sholom Aleichem]]. This ballad tells the story of an ascetic young man, Monish, who unsuccessfully resists the temptress [[Lilith]].

A writer of social criticism, sympathetic to the [[labor movement]], he wrote stories, folk tales and plays. Liptzin characterizes him as both a realist and a romanticist, who "delved into irrational layers of the soul"... ; "an optimist who believed in the inevitability of progress through enlightenment", and who, at times, expressed this optimism through "visions of [[messiah|Messianic]] possibilities". Still, while most Jewish intellectuals were unrestrained in their support of the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], Peretz's view was more reserved, focusing more on the [[pogrom]]s that took place within the Revolution, and concerned that the Revolution's universalist ideals would leave little space for Jewish non-conformism.

Peretz assisted other Yiddish writers in publishing their work, including [[Der Nister]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berdichev.org/der_nister_1.html Der Nister]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lamed Shapiro]].

Much as [[Jacob Gordin]] influenced [[Yiddish theater]] in New York City in a more serious direction, so did Peretz in Eastern Europe. Israil Bercovici sees Peretz's works for the stage as a synthesis of Gordin and of the more traditional and melodramatic [[Abraham Goldfaden]], an opinion which Peretz himself apparently would not have rejected: "The critics", he wrote, "the worst of them thought that M.M. Seforim was my model. This is not true. My teacher was Abraham Goldfaden."

Some of Peretz's most important works are ''Oyb Nisht Nokh Hekher'' ("If not Higher") and the short story "Bontshe Shvayg" ("Bontsche the Silent"). "Bontsche" is the story of an extremely meek and modest man, downtrodden on earth but exalted in heaven for his modesty, who, offered any heavenly reward, chooses one as modest as the way he had lived. While the story can be read as praise of this meekness, there is also an ambiguity in the ending, which can be read as showing contempt for someone who cannot even imagine receiving more.

Peretz's 1907 play ''A Night in the Old Marketplace'' has been adapted into a [[multimedia]] theatrical presentation, with music by [[Frank London]] and book and lyrics by [[Glen Berger]], slated to open in 2007; the [[CD]] is already on sale. Set in a Jewish [[shtetl]], the comedy presents the [[philosophical]] and [[theological]] questions of living and dying, in Peretz's typical style.

Peretz died in the city of Warsaw, [[Congress Poland]], in 1915. There are streets in Warsaw, in Zamość and in Wrocław (also a square) named after him (''ulica Icchaka Lejba Pereca'' in Polish). He was buried at the [[Okopowa Street Jewish Cemetery]] with a huge crowd, about 100 000 strong,&lt;ref&gt;[http://rosaluxemburgblog.wordpress.com/2012/07/25/rosa-luxemburg-and-jewish-zamosc/]&lt;/ref&gt; attending the burial ceremony.

[[Peretz Square]] in [[Lower Manhattan]] (New York City, USA), which marks the spot where Houston Street, First Avenue, and First Street meet, is named after him. It was dedicated on November 23, 1952.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_your_park/historical_signs/hs_historical_sign.php?id=6509 PERETZ SQUARE - Historical Sign&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The American journalist [[Martin Peretz]] is one of his descendants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ha-historion.blogspot.com/2007/01/of-yiddish-and-american-writers-and.html The Jewish History Channel: SERIES Sephard in Ashkenaz and Ashkenaz in Sephard.

==Work==

Peretz wrote in both [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]. His work ''The Magician'' found inspiration in the [[Jewish folklore|folklore]] of [[Hasidic Judaism]]. The story focuses around [[Elijah]], who anonymously visits a poor couple and helps to make them rich. The 1917 edition was illustrated by [[Marc Chagall]]. Chagall did not know Peretz and did not read Peretz's work until he was commissioned to create the drawings.&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/9615/ |title = The Magician |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1917 |accessdate = 2013-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jewish Palestinian Aramaic''' (abbreviated JPA) was a [[Western Aramaic languages|Western Aramaic language]] spoken by the Jews during the [[Classical antiquity|Classic Era]] in [[Judea]] and the [[Levant]], specifically in [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean]], [[Herodian kingdom|Herodian]] and [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman Judea]] and adjacent lands in the late first millennium BCE and later in [[Syria Palaestina]] and [[Palaestina Secunda]] in the early first millennium CE. A dialect of this language ([[Galilean Aramaic]]) was [[Language of Jesus|spoken]] by [[Jesus]].&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1697899|title ='Passion' Stirs Interest in Aramaic|publisher = [[National Public Radio]]|quote=Jesus would have spoken the local dialect, referred to by scholars as Palestinian Jewish Aramaic, which was the form common to that region, Amar says.|date=25 February 2004|accessdate = 3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[4Q246|Son of God Text]] ([[4Q246]]), found in [[Qumran]] is written in this language as well.

There were some differences in dialect between Judea and [[Galilee]], and most surviving texts are in the [[Galilean dialect]]: Michael Sokoloff has published separate dictionaries of the two dialects.

==Overview==
After the defeat of the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] in 135 CE, the center of Jewish learning in the land of Israel moved to [[Galilee]]. With the Arab conquest of the country in the 7th century, [[Arabic]] gradually replaced this language.

The most notable text in this dialect's corpus is the [[Jerusalem Talmud]], which is still studied in Jewish religious schools and academically, although not as widely as the [[Babylonian Talmud]], most of which is written in [[Jewish Babylonian Aramaic]]. There are some older texts in Jewish Palestinian Aramaic, notably the [[Megillat Taanit]]: the Babylonian Talmud contains occasional quotations from these.

Many extant manuscripts in Jewish Palestinian Aramaic have been corrupted over the years of their transmission by Eastern Aramaic-speaking scribes freely correcting "errors" they came across (these "errors" actually being genuine Jewish Palestinian Aramaic features). To date, all formal grammars of the dialect fall victim to these corruptions, and there is still no published syntax.

'''Kores''' is a leading international brand of school and office products best known for solid glue sticks, dry correction tapes and Kolores coloured pencils. Kores was founded in 1887 by Wilhelm Koreska, the great-grandfather of Clemens Koreska, the current president of Kores Group. The worldwide HQ of Kores is based in [[Vienna]], Austria and its main offices are in Czech Republic (Prague), Germany (Rommerskirchen), Mexico (Mexico City), Colombia (Bogotá) and Venezuela (Caracas). Kores has 2 key production facilities in Mexico City and Strmilov (Czech Republic). The iconic Kores dactylo was also portrayed on the cover poster of the Pedro Almodóvar’s movie "The Flower of my Secret".

==History==

In the first part of 20th century, Kores expanded to become one of the world’s first globalized companies that produced chemical office products such as [[carbon paper]], in countries as far and wide as China and Egypt. Kores had its own company magazine, Kores Revue, and an official sales handbook on how to sell carbon paper, which are displayed at the Kores museum display at the Vienna HQ. Following a decline in carbon paper sales due to changing office technology, Kores began focusing on the production of glue sticks and correction products from the 1990s, expanding into the new markets of Eastern Europe, as well as supplying global businesses in Western Europe and the United States.

[[File:Kores-girl.jpg|thumb|Kores Carbon Paper]]

In the 2000s, under the leadership of Peter Koreska, Kores International Product Management began innovating a growing number of products such as [http://www.kores.com/products/correction/scooter-red-correction-tape/ Scooter] and 2Way [[correction tape]]s, Neon coloured glue sticks, Bright Liner [[highlighter]]s and Desk Pot and Design Line [[adhesive tape]] dispensers. Kores also introduced one of the largest ranges of coloured index notes for bookmarking and referencing. In 2009, the Kolores range of [[Colouring pencils|coloring pencils]] were launched worldwide as Kores expanded into school products. Kolores coloured pencils are known for their soft application, vivid colours and clean sharpening. Following the success of Kolores, Kores launched [[Crayons|wax crayons]], [[Felt tip pen|felt tip]] pens, pencils and sharpeners.

==2010 - today==
By 2010, Peter and Robert Koreska had purchased back the Kores trademark rights for the key markets of Germany, France, Italy, United Kingdom, Netherlands and Scandinavia, thereby optimizing the Kores brand distribution potential. In the same year, Kores Germany launched a complete program of printer consumables, including [[Toner cartridge|laser toners]], [[ink jet cartridge]]s and [[typewriter ribbons]], which are offered to the international Kores network of customers. In 2016 Kores celebrated 20 years of production at its [[Strmilov]] production plant. In 2017 Kores celebrated 130th anniversary!

==The Future==
The recent CEO message celebrating 130 years of Kores by Kores President, Clemens Koreska, looks forward to a future where Kores continues to develop high quality, innovative products in line with lifestyle, office and school trends.

==Awards and recognition==
In 2014 Kores was awarded with the [https://www.umweltzeichen.at/cms/en/products/content.html Austrian Ecolabel]. Now the glue sticks, produced in millions at the Kores factory in Czech Republic, can proudly carry the quality label awarded by the Austrian government. For more than 20 years the Austrian Ecolabel marks environmentally friendly products and services and thus provides guarantee to the customers.

'''Lokenath Bhattacharya''' ({{lang-bn|লোকনাথ ভট্টাচার্য }}; 1927–2001) was a prolific [[Bengali language|Bengali]] writer who chose to remain in isolation. Though 15 of his books have been translated into French, only 'Babughater Kumari Maach' (The Virgin Fish of Babughat) has been translated into English. He finished his doctorate study in [[Paris]]. After spending his working life in [[India]], he went back to [[France]] to spend the last decade of his life with his wife who is French. He has translated the poetry of [[Rimbaud]], [[Henri Michaux]] into Bengali. He died in Egypt in a car accident.

==Life and education==
He was born in an Orthodox family in Bhatpara, North 24 Parganas [[West Bengal]], [[India]]. His initial training was in [[Sanskrit]]. He then went to the [[Visva-Bharati University]] in [[Santiniketan]] for higher studies. After studying French in the [[Alliance Française]] in [[Calcutta]], he went to [[University of Paris]] for his doctoral degree on French government scholarship. He immersed himself in French literature and translated Rimbaud, Henri Michaux and [[Descartes]] into Bengali. Despite his significant literary output, Lokenath never received the kind of critical attention he deserved in the Bengali literary circle. As Meenakshi Mukherjeer writes in the introduction of her English translation of the book ''The Virgin Fish of Babughat'', "He remained a writers' writer, discussed in little magazines and exclusive literary journals, forever an outsider in the mainstream literary world of Kolkata. Apart from the unfamiliarity of his imaginative world, the fact that he spent most of his adult life outside Bengal might also have accentuated his alienation."&lt;ref&gt;Published by Oxford University Press, New Delhi, India (2003){{ISBN|9780195665772}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/2001/01/07/stories/1307017m.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Lokenath was married to France Bhattacharya who in her turn spread Bengali Literature in France.&lt;ref&gt;View profile of France in https://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/tagoreconference/bios/&lt;/ref&gt; France Bhattacharya, holder of a doctorat d’état in Indian Studies, is emeritus professor, Inalco, member of the Centre for the study on India and South Asia, CEIAS, and was till recently director of the Fondation Maison des Sciences de l’Homme programme for India and South Asia. She works on Bengali pre-colonial literature mainly from a perspective of religious and social history.

She has translated several Bengali novels into French such as: Le monastère de la félicité (Ânandamath) (Paris, Le serpent à plumes, 2003) and Celle qui portait des crânes en boucles d’oreilles (Kapâlkundalâ) by Bankim Chandra Chatterji (Paris, « Connaissance de l’Orient », Gallimard, 2005), Quatre chapitres (Châr adhyây) and Chârulatâ (Nasta nîr) by Rabindranath Tagore (Paris, Zulma, 2004 and 2009), La complainte du sentier (Pather Pâncâlî) by Bibhuti Bhushan Banerji, (Paris, Gallimard, 1969), as well as several fictions by her late husband Lokenath Bhattacharya, and his prose poems Ghar.

==Major works==
Novels:
* Bhor ({{lang-bn|ভোর}}, Daybreak ) 1966
* Jato Dawa Tato Aranya (যত দাওয়া তত অরণ্য, As Many Doors as Forests) 1966
* Dui-ekti Ghar, Du-ekti Swar (দুই-একটি ঘর, দুই-একটি স্বর, One or Two Rooms, One or Two Voices) 1967
* Babughater Kumari Maach (বাবুঘাটের কুমারী মাছ, The Virgin Fish of Babughat) 1972
* Theater Arambho Sare Saattay (থিয়েটার আরম্ভ সাড়ে সাতটায়, The Play Begins at Seven-Thirty) 1983
* Ashwamedh (অশ্বমেধ, 1997)
* Gangabataran (গঙ্গাবতরণ, 1998)

He also wrote four volumes of poetry, three plays,  two collections of short stories, and two books of discursive prose.

===The Virgin Fish of Babughat===
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Virgin_fish.jpg|right|thumb|book cover]] --&gt;
'Babughater Kumari Maach' (বাবুঘাটের কুমারী মাছ, The Virgin Fish of Babughat, 1972) is the only works of his that has been translated into English. Here's the description from the back flap of Meenakshi Mukherjee's translation:

"The novel is set in a sinister detention camp where men and women are divested of their clothes and their past, but provided with all the luxuries of life including unlimited sexual gratification.

The narrator, a writer before he was brought to the prison, has been meted a unique punishment: he must fill up a stack of paper with words every day. He turns this task into a life line, writing frantically to recapture a world that is he has lost, to resuscitate the very language that he is in dance of forgetting, and to record the systematic dehumanization which is taking place around him. Yet, his account is not altogether bleak: there are lively accounts of people and events, humour, tenderness, love, and even hope."

This book has some interesting similarity with [[Margaret Atwood|Margaret Atwood's]] [[The Handmaid's Tale]] (1985).

When the novel was written, India and West Bengal was going through a troubled times. The [[Naxalite|Naxal]] movement was at its peak in West Bengal. The government was using repressive measures to suppress the violence generated by the Naxalites. According to Mukherjee, the novel may have been a reference to the incidents. Kiranmoy Raha, a critique wrote this after Emergency was declared in India in 1975 (cited in Mukherjee):
"'Babughater Kumari Maachh' is a futuristic allegory which projects the culmination of what the author feels to be present tendencies. It is an examination of the human situation in extremis. For an observer of the social scenre around, Lokenath Bhattachary's novel gives an uncomfortable feeling that the future may not be that far away, after all. It may be already there"

'''Martine Nida-Rümelin''' (born 1957 in [[Munich]]) is a [[philosopher]]. Since 1999, she has been a professor at the [[University of Fribourg]] in Switzerland. Her main areas of interest are [[philosophy of mind]], [[theory of knowledge]] and [[philosophy of language]]. The major part of her published work is concerned with the special status of conscious individuals and aims at developing a non-[[materialist]] account which avoids the weaknesses of traditional [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]]. [[Phenomenal consciousness]], identity of conscious beings through time and across possible worlds, and the active role of the subject in its doings are central themes of her research. Rational intuitions and phenomenological reflexion play a prominent role in her philosophical approach.

Nida-Rümelin studied [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[mathematics]] and [[political science]] at the [[University of Munich]].

In her doctoral thesis, she discussed the [[knowledge argument]], by the Australian philosopher [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]], which is directed against a materialist conception of phenomenal consciousness, and presents one of the most important [[Qualia]]-based arguments. Her transformed version of the Mary-thought-experiment, has been much discussed and coined the "Nida-Rümelin room" by [[John Perry (philosopher)|John Perry]].&lt;ref&gt;Perry, John, Knowledge, Possibility, and Consciousness, Jean Nicod Lectures, Cambridge, Mass.: MIT, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In her habilitation she developed a non-[[reductionist]] view about the identity of conscious individuals. 

She is the daughter of the sculptor [[Rolf Nida-Rümelin]], the granddaughter of the sculptor [[Wilhelm Nida-Rümelin]] and the sister of the philosopher and politician [[Julian Nida-Rümelin]].

'''Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh''' (also spelled '''Mohammad-Jafar Pooyandeh '''or''' Mohammad Jafar Poyandeh''',''' '''{{lang-fa|محمد جعفر پوینده}}) (7 June 1954 – 8 or 9  December 1998) was an Iranian writer, translator and activist. He was a member of the [[Iranian Writers Association]], a group that had been long banned in Iran due to their objection to censorship and encouraged freedom of expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://iranian.com/News/Feb99/voice.html|title = Iran Giving Voice to Freedom|date = February 22, 1999|accessdate = December 28, 2014|website = The Iranian|publisher = Newsweek International|last = Dickey|first = Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was most likely murdered during the [[Chain murders of Iran]] in 1998.

Pouyandeh worked at the Cultural Research Institute and was working on translating a book called ''Questions &amp; Answer about Human Rights'' at the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://iranian.com/BTW/2002/December/Pouyandeh/index.html|title = You will answer, one day|date = December 12, 2002|accessdate = December 28, 2014|website = The Iranian|publisher = |last = Sahebi|first = Sima}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pouyandeh was not a well known writer, translator, or activist in Iran and he is essentially known for his unusual circumstance of death.

Pouyandeh was last seen alive leaving his office at four o'clock in the afternoon of December 8, 1998 and still hadn't returned home three days later when his wife wrote and delivered a letter to Iran's President expressing her anguish over his disappearance. His body was discovered December 11.  in the [[Shahriar County|Shahriar district]] of Karaj, south of [[Tehran]], and he appeared to have been strangled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2704023.stm|title = Iranian killers spared death penalty|date = January 29, 2003|accessdate = December 28, 2014|website = BBC News|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Oath of the Horatii''''' ({{lang-fr|Le Serment des Horaces}}), is a large painting by the French artist [[Jacques-Louis David]] painted in 1784 and now on display in the [[Louvre]] in Paris. The painting immediately became a huge success with critics and the public, and remains one of the best known paintings in the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical style]].

It depicts a scene from a Roman legend about a dispute between two warring cities, [[Roman Kingdom|Rome]] and [[Alba Longa]], and stresses the importance of patriotism and masculine self-sacrifice for one's country. Instead of the two cities sending their armies to war, they agree to choose three men from each city; the victor in that fight will be the victorious city.  From Rome, three brothers from a Roman family, the [[Horatii]], agree to end the war by fighting three brothers from a family of [[Alba Longa]], the Curiatii. The three brothers, all of whom appear willing to sacrifice their lives for the good of [[Roman Kingdom|Rome]], are shown [[Roman salute|saluting]] their father who holds their swords out for them.&lt;ref name="Roth"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Roth|first=Michael |title=Rediscovering history: culture, politics, and the psyche|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1994|pages=308|chapter=Facing the Patriarch in Early Davidian Painting|isbn=9780804723138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the three Horatii brothers, only one shall survive the confrontation. However, it is the surviving brother who is able to kill the other three fighters from Alba Longa: he allows the three fighters to chase him, causing them to separate from each other, and then, in turn, kills each Curiatii brother. Aside from the three brothers depicted, David also represents, in the bottom right corner, a woman crying whilst sitting down. She is Camilla, a sister of the Horatii brothers, who is also betrothed to one of the Curiatii fighters, and thus she weeps in the realisation that, in any case, she will lose someone she loves.

The principal sources for the story behind David's ''Oath'' are the first book of [[Livy]] (sections 24–26) which was elaborated by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]] in book 3 of his ''Roman Antiquities''.&lt;ref name="Marvin"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Marvin|first=Roberta Montemorra |author2=Downing A.

It grew to be considered a paragon of [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] art. The painting increased David's fame, allowing him to take on his own students.&lt;ref name="DAVID"&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/his/CoreArt/art/neocl_dav_oath.html Jacques-Louis David: The Oath of the Horatii] (from the [[Boston College]] website.

==Commissioning the work==
[[File:David Brutus.jpg|thumb|David's ''[[The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons]]'', 1789]]
In 1774, David won the Prix de Rome with his work ''[[Erasistratus Discovering the Cause of Antiochus' Disease|Érasistrate découvrant la cause de la maladie d’Antiochius]]''. This allowed him to stay five years (1775–1780) in Rome as a student from the French government. Upon his return to Paris he exhibited his work, which [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] greatly admired; the success was so resounding that King Louis XVI of France allowed him to stay in the Louvre, a very ancient privilege desired by artists. There he met Pecoul, contractor for the actual buildings, and Pecoul's daughter, whom he married. The king's assistant, Charles-Claude Flahaut de la Billaderie, commissioned ''Oath of the Horatii'' with the intention that it be an allegory about loyalty to the state and therefore to the king. Nevertheless, David departed from the agreed-upon scene, painting this scene instead.  The painting was not completed in Paris, but rather in Rome, where David was visited by his pupil Jean-Germaine Drouais who had himself recently won the Prix de Rome. Ultimately, David's picture manifests a progressive outlook, deeply influenced by Enlightenment ideas, that eventually contributed to the overthrow of the monarchy. As the [[French Revolution]] approached, paintings increasingly referred to the loyalty to the state rather than the family or the church. Painted five years before the Revolution, the ''Oath of the Horatii'' reflects the political tensions of the period.

In 1789, David painted ''[[The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons]]'', a picture that was also a royal commission. Shortly afterward, the king went up to the scaffold also accused of treason, as the sons of Brutus, and with the vote of the artist in the National Assembly, which supported the execution of Louis XVI.

==Symbolic theme==

[[File:Jacques-Louis David - Oath of the Horatii - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Oath of the Horatii'', a second smaller version painted in 1786 by David and his pupil [[Girodet]], now in [[Toledo, Ohio]]]]
The painting depicts the Roman [[Horatii|Horatius]] family, who, according to [[Titus Livius]]' ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'' (''From the Founding of the City'') had been chosen for a ritual duel against three members of the Curiatii, a family from [[Alba Longa]], in order to settle disputes between the Romans and the latter city. As [[French Revolution|revolution in France]] loomed, paintings urging loyalty to the state rather than to clan or clergy abounded. Although it was painted nearly four years before the revolution in France, ''The Oath of the Horatii'' became one of the defining images of the time.

In the painting, the three brothers express their loyalty and solidarity with Rome before battle, wholly supported by their father. These are men willing to lay down their lives out of patriotic duty. With their resolute gaze and taut, outstretched limbs, they are citadels of patriotism. They are symbols of the highest virtues of Rome. Their clarity of purpose, mirrored by David's simple yet powerful use of tonal contrasts, lends the painting, and its message about the nobility of patriotic sacrifice, an electric intensity. This is all in contrast to the tender-hearted women who lie weeping and mourning, awaiting the results of the fighting.

The mother and sisters are shown clothed in silken garments seemingly melting into tender expressions of sorrow. Their despair is partly due to the fact that one sister was engaged to one of the Curiatii and another is a sister of the Curiatii, married to one of the Horatii. Upon defeat of the Curiatii, the remaining Horatius journeyed home to find his sister cursing Rome over the death of her fiancé. He killed her, horrified that Rome was being cursed. Originally David had intended to depict this episode, and a drawing survives showing the surviving Horatius raising his sword, with his sister lying dead. David later decided that this subject was too gruesome a way of sending the message of public duty overcoming private feeling, but his next major painting, ''The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons'' depicted a similar scene - [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] brooding as the bodies of his sons, whose executions for treason he had ordered, are returned home.  This was a subject the tragedy ''Brutus'' by [[Voltaire]] had made familiar to the French. 
[[File:Study for the Oath of the Horatii- Camilla.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Study for Camilla, black chalk and white highlights]]

The painting shows the three brothers on the left, the Horatii father in the center, and the three women along with two children on the right.  The Horatii brothers are depicted swearing upon (saluting) their swords as they take their oath. The men show no sense of emotion. Even the father, who holds up three swords, shows no emotion. On the right, three women are weeping—one in the back and two up closer. The woman dressed in the white is a Horatius weeping for both her Curiatii fiancé and her brother; the one dressed in brown is a Curiatius who weeps for her Horatii husband and her brother. The background woman in black holds two children—one of whom is the child of a Horatius male and his Curiatii wife. The younger daughter hides her face in her nanny’s dress as the son refuses to have his eyes shielded.
According to Thomas Le Claire:
{{quote|This painting occupies an extremely important place in the body of David’s work and in the history of French painting. The story was taken from [[Livy]]. We are in the period of the wars between Rome and Alba, in 669 B.C. It has been decided that the dispute between the two cities must be settled by an unusual form of combat to be fought by two groups of three champions each. The two groups are the three Horatii brothers and the three Curiatii brothers. The drama lay in the fact that one of the sisters of the Curiatii, Sabina, is married to one of the Horatii, while one of the sisters of the Horatii, Camilla, is betrothed to one of the Curiatii. Despite the ties between the two families, the Horatii's father exhorts his sons to fight the Curiatii and they obey, despite the lamentations of the women.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.leclaire-kunst.de/katalog-17.pdf Master Drawings - Recent Acquisitions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009204905/http://www.leclaire-kunst.de/katalog-17.pdf |date=2007-10-09 }} - Le Claire, Thomas - Kunsthandel XVII&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Compositional technique==
[[File:Schhoraces5.jpg|thumb|300px|Schematic showing the convergence of many elements in the composition at the central point]]
This painting shows the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] art style,&lt;ref name="DAVID"/&gt; and employs various techniques that were typical of it:

*The background is de-emphasized, while the figures in the foreground are emphasized.
*Overlapping ranks of profile figures are a common motif in classical art, and that of other ancient Near Eastern cultures. 
*The central point of the hand clasping the swords is placed in front of the [[vanishing point]] of the [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] scheme, which is emphasized by the straight lines of the edges of the wall blocks and floor slabs of the architectural setting leading to it (see schematic). 
*The use of dull colors is to show the importance of the story behind the painting over the painting itself.
*The picture is clearly organized, depicting the [[3 (number)#Abrahamic religions|symbolism of the number three]] and of the moment itself.
*The focus on clear, hard details and the lack of use of the more wispy brushstrokes preferred by [[Rococo]] art.
*The brushstrokes are invisible, and the painter's technique is not displayed as a distraction from the subject
*The men are all depicted with straight lines mirroring the columns in the background signifying their rigidity and strength while the women are all curved like the arches which are held up by the columns.
*The use of straight lines to depict strength is also demonstrated in the swords, two of which are curved while one is straight, perhaps foreshadowing that only one brother would survive the encounter.
*The brother closest to the viewer (presumably destined to be the sole survivor) is dressed in colors matching that of the father while the garb of the other brothers is obscured but seems to mimic the colors being worn by the women.
*The frozen quality of the painting is also intended to emphasize rationality, unlike the Rococo style.
*The only emotion shown is from the women, who were allowed to feel, while the men show [[Stoicism|stoic]] determination to do their duty.&lt;ref name="DAVID"/&gt;
*That it depicts a morally uplifting story, promoting civic duty over the personal, reflects the values of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and neoclassical idealism.

==Reception==
When the royalty, churchmen, and aristocrats went to view the painting, they eulogised it; the Pope himself expressed his desire to view ''The Oath of the Horatii''. The painting was exhibited in the Salon of 1785, but it was delivered late. David's enemies at the Academy took advantage of the delay to exhibit the painting in a poor locale in the gallery. The public's dissatisfaction with the painting's poor viewing conditions obliged the gallery to move it to a more prominent location. David kept ''The Oath of the Horatii'' on exhibit for longer than expected to permit reporters to write about all of the paintings exhibited, not just his.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

'''Old Burmese''' was an early form of the [[Burmese language]], as attested in the stone inscriptions of [[Bagan|Pagan]], and is the oldest phase of Burmese linguistic history. The transition to [[Middle Burmese]] occurred in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="herbert"&gt;{{cite book|last=Herbert|first=Patricia|author2=Anthony Crothers Milner|title=South-East Asia: Languages and Literatures: a Select Guide|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=1989|pages=5|isbn=9780824812676}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transition to Middle Burmese included phonological changes (e.g. mergers of [[Minimal pair|sound pairs]] that were distinct in Old Burmese) as well as accompanying changes in the underlying [[orthography]].&lt;ref name="herbert"/&gt; [[Word order]], grammatical structure and vocabulary have remained markedly comparable, well into Modern Burmese, with the exception of lexical content (e.g. [[function word]]s).&lt;ref name="herbert"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lapolla"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wheatley|first=Julian|editors=Randy J. LaPolla, Graham Thurgood|title=Sino-Tibetan Languages|chapter=12. Burmese|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=9781135797171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
Unlike most [[Tibeto-Burman languages]], Burmese has a phonological system with two-way aspiration: [[preaspiration]] (e.g. {{my|မှ}} ''hma.'' vs. {{my|မ}} ''ma.'') and [[Aspirated consonant|postaspiration]] (e.g. {{my|ခ}} ''kha.'' vs. {{my|က}} ''ka.'').&lt;ref name="hill"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yanson|first=Rudolf A.|title=Aspiration in the Burmese Phonological System: A Diachronic Account|editor=Nathan W. Hill|publisher=BRILL|year=2012|series=Medieval Tibeto-Burman Languages IV|pages=17–29|isbn=9789004232020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Burmese, this distinction serves to differentiate [[causative|causative and non-causative]] verbs of Sino-Tibetan etymology.&lt;ref name="hill"/&gt;

In Old Burmese, postaspiration can be reconstructed to the proto-Burmese language, whereas preaspiration is comparatively newer, having derived from proto-prefixes.&lt;ref name="hill"/&gt; The merging of proto-prefixes (i.e., {{my|ဟ}} as an independent consonant used as a prefix) to preaspirated consonants was nearly complete by the 12th century.&lt;ref name="hill"/&gt;

==Orthography==

Old Burmese maintains a number of distinctions which are no longer present in the orthography of standard Burmese.

===Diacritics===
Whereas Modern Standard Burmese uses 3 written medials ({{IPA|/-y-/}}, {{IPA|/-w-/}}, and {{IPA|/-r-/}}), Old Burmese had a fourth written medial {{IPA|/-l-/}}, which was typically written as a stacked consonant {{my|္လ}} underneath the letter being modified.&lt;ref name="lapolla"/&gt;

Old Burmese orthography treated the preaspirated consonant as a separate segment, since a special [[diacritic]] (''ha hto'', {{my|ှ}}) had not yet been innovated.&lt;ref name="hill"/&gt; As such, the letter ''ha'' ({{my|ဟ}}) was stacked above the consonant being modified (e.g. {{my|ဟ္မ}} where Modern Burmese uses {{my|မှ}}).&lt;ref name="hill"/&gt;&lt;!---Another example is the Burmese phrase "long ago," now spelt {{my|ရှေးသရော}} but in Old Burmese, written {{my|ဟြောသြော ဟ္ရောသ္ရော}}&lt;ref name="hill"/&gt;--&gt;

===Gloss===

Examples of such differences include the consonant ''yh-'' and the lateral clusters ''kl-'' and ''khl-''. The earliest Old Burmese documents, in particular the Myazedi and [[Lokatheikpan]] inscriptions frequently have ''-o-'' where later Burmese has ''-wa''.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Old Burmese also had a final ''-at'' and ''-an'' distinct from ''-ac'' and ''-any'' as shown by Nishi (1974).

==Vocabulary==
Aside from [[Pali]], the [[Mon language]] had significant influence on Old Burmese orthography and vocabulary, as Old Burmese borrowed many lexical items (especially relating to handicrafts, administration, flora and fauna, navigation and architecture), although grammatical influence was minimal.&lt;ref name="gartner"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Uta Gärtner, Jens Lorenz|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|year=1994|series=Tradition and Modernity in Myanmar|pages=366–426|chapter=3|isbn=9783825821869}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Mon [[loan word]]s are present in Old Burmese inscriptions, including words that were absent in the Burmese vocabulary and those that substituted original Burmese words. Examples include:&lt;ref name="gartner"/&gt;
*"widow" - Mon {{mnw|ကၟဲာ}} &gt; Burmese {{my|kamay}}
*"excrement" - Mon {{mnw|...}} &gt; Burmese {{my|haruk}}
*"sun" - Mon {{mnw|တ္ၚဲ}} &gt; Burmese {{my|taŋuy}}

Moreover, Mon influenced Old Burmese orthography, particularly with regard to preference for certain spelling conventions:
*use of -E- ({{my|-ဧ-}}) instead of -Y- ({{my|ျ}}) (e.g. "destroy" {{my|ဖဧက်}}, not {{my|ဖျက်}} as in modern Burmese)&lt;ref name="gartner"/&gt;
*use of RH- ({{my|ဟြ &gt; ရှ}}) instead of HR- as done with other preaspirated consonants (e.g. "monk" {{my|ရှင်}}, not {{my|ဟြင်}})&lt;ref name="gartner"/&gt; - attributed to the fact that Old Mon did not have preaspirated consonants

==Grammar==
Two grammatical markers presently found in Modern Burmese are extant to Old Burmese: 
*{{my|၏}} - finite predicate (placed at the end of a sentence)&lt;ref name="gartner"/&gt;
*{{my|၍}} - nonfinite predicate (conjunction that connects two clauses)&lt;ref name="gartner"/&gt;

In Old Burmese, {{my|၍}} was spelt ''ruy-e'', following the pattern in [[Pali]], whose inflected verbs can express the main predicate.&lt;ref name="gartner"/&gt;

Pali also had an influence in the construction of written Old Burmese [[Grammatical modifier|verbal modifiers]]. Whereas in Modern Burmese, the verb + {{my|သော}} (''sau:'') construction can only modify the succeeding noun (e.g. {{my|ချစ်သောလူ}}, "man who loves") and {{my|သူ}} (''su'') can only modify the preceding verb (e.g. {{my|ချစ်သူ}}, "lover"), in Old Burmese, both constructions, verb + {{my|သော}} and verb + {{my|သူ}} were interchangeable.&lt;ref name="gartner"/&gt; This was a consequence of Pali grammar, which dictates that participles can be used in noun functions.&lt;ref name="gartner"/&gt;

Pali grammar also influenced negation in written Old Burmese, as many Old Burmese inscriptions adopt the Pali method of negation.&lt;ref name="gartner"/&gt; In Burmese, negation is accomplished by prefixing a negative particle {{my|မ}} (''ma.'') to the verb being negated. In Pali, {{my|အ}} (''a.'') is used instead.

Such grammatical influences from Pali on written Old Burmese had disappeared by the 15th century.&lt;ref name="gartner"/&gt;

==Surviving inscriptions==
The earliest evidence of Burmese script (inscription at the [[Mahabodhi Temple]] in India) is dated to 1035, while an 18th-century recast stone inscription points to 984.&lt;ref name=mat-2005-167-178-197-200&gt;Aung-Thwin (2005): 167–178, 197–200&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most well known inscription is the Old Burmese face of the [[Myazedi inscription]]. The most complete set of Old Burmese inscriptions, called ''She-haung Myanma Kyauksa Mya'' ({{my|ရှေးဟောင်း မြန်မာ ကျောက်စာများ}}; lit. "Ancient Stone Inscriptions of Myanmar") was published by [[Yangon University]]'s Department of Archaeology in five volumes from 1972 to 1987.&lt;ref name=mat-1996-900&gt;Aung-Thwin 1996: 900&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Optical character recognition''' (also '''optical character reader''', '''OCR''') is the [[Machine|mechanical]] or [[Electronics|electronic]] conversion of [[image]]s of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo (for example the text on signs and billboards in a landscape photo) or from subtitle text superimposed on an image (for example from a television broadcast).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dev.havenondemand.com/apis/ocrdocument#overview|title=OCR Document|first=HPE Haven|last=OnDemand|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Widely used as a form of information entry from printed paper data records – whether passport documents, invoices, [[bank statement]]s, computerised receipts, business cards, mail, printouts of static-data, or any suitable documentation – it is a common method of digitising printed texts so that they can be electronically edited, searched, stored more compactly, displayed on-line, and used in machine processes such as [[cognitive computing]], [[machine translation]], (extracted) [[text-to-speech]], key data and [[text mining]]. OCR is a field of research in [[pattern recognition]], [[artificial intelligence]] and [[computer vision]].

Early versions needed to be trained with images of each character, and worked on one font at a time. Advanced systems capable of producing a high degree of recognition accuracy for most fonts are now common, and with support for a variety of digital image file format inputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dev.havenondemand.com/docs/ImageFormats.html|title=undefined|first=HPE Haven|last=OnDemand|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some systems are capable of reproducing formatted output that closely approximates the original page including images, columns, and other non-textual components.

Early optical character recognition may be traced to technologies involving telegraphy and creating reading devices for the blind.&lt;ref name=Scantz82&gt;{{cite book|last=Schantz|first=Herbert F.|title=The history of OCR, optical character recognition|year=1982|publisher=Recognition Technologies Users Association|location=[Manchester Center, Vt.]|isbn=9780943072012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, [[Emanuel Goldberg]] developed a machine that read characters and converted them into standard telegraph code.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Concurrently, Edmund Fournier d'Albe developed the [[Optophone]], a handheld scanner that when moved across a printed page, produced tones that corresponded to specific letters or characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=d'Albe|first=E. E. F.|title=On a Type-Reading Optophone|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|date=1 July 1914|volume=90|issue=619|pages=373–375|doi=10.1098/rspa.1914.0061|bibcode=1914RSPSA..90..373D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1920s and into the 1930s [[Emanuel Goldberg]] developed what he called a "Statistical Machine" for searching microfilm archives using an optical code recognition system. In 1931 he was granted USA Patent number 1,838,389 for the invention. The patent was acquired by [[IBM]].

With the advent of smart-phones and [[smartglasses]], OCR can be used in internet connected mobile device applications that extract text captured using the device's camera. These devices that do not have OCR functionality built into the operating system will typically use an OCR [[Application programming interface|API]] to extract the text from the image file captured and provided by the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://community.havenondemand.com/t5/Blog/Extracting-text-from-images-using-OCR-on-Android/ba-p/1883|title=Extracting text from images using OCR on Android|date=27 June 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://community.havenondemand.com/t5/Blog/Tutorial-OCR-on-Google-Glass/ba-p/1164|title=[Tutorial] OCR on Google Glass|date=23 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OCR API returns the extracted text, along with information about the location of the detected text in the original image back to the device app for further processing (such as text-to-speech) or display.

===Blind and visually impaired users===
In 1974, [[Ray Kurzweil]] started the company Kurzweil Computer Products, Inc. and continued development of omni-[[typeface|font]] OCR, which could recognise text printed in virtually any font (Kurzweil is often credited with inventing omni-font OCR, but it was in use by companies, including CompuScan, in the late 1960s and 1970s&lt;ref name=Scantz82/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Data processing magazine |title=The History of OCR |volume=12 |year=1970 |page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Kurzweil decided that the best application of this technology would be to create a reading machine for the blind, which would allow blind people to have a computer read text to them out loud. This device required the invention of two enabling technologies{{spaced ndash}}the [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] [[flatbed scanner]] and the text-to-speech synthesiser. On January 13, 1976, the successful finished product was unveiled during a widely reported news conference headed by Kurzweil and the leaders of the [[National Federation of the Blind]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} In 1978, Kurzweil Computer Products began selling a commercial version of the optical character recognition computer program. [[LexisNexis]] was one of the first customers, and bought the program to upload legal paper and news documents onto its nascent online databases. Two years later, Kurzweil sold his company to [[Xerox]], which had an interest in further commercialising paper-to-computer text conversion. Xerox eventually spun it off as [[Scansoft]], which merged with [[Nuance Communications]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} The research group headed by [[A. G. Ramakrishnan]] at the [[Medical intelligence and language engineering lab]], [[Indian Institute of Science]], has developed PrintToBraille tool, an open source GUI frontend&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=PrintToBraille Tool |title=ocr-gui-frontend |url=https://code.google.com/p/ocr-gui-frontend/ |publisher=MILE Lab, Dept of EE, IISc |accessdate=7 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225115650/https://code.google.com/p/ocr-gui-frontend/ |archivedate=December 25, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that can be used by any OCR to convert scanned images of printed books to Braille books.

In the 2000s, OCR was made available online as a service (WebOCR), in a [[cloud computing]] environment, and in mobile applications like real-time translation of foreign-language signs on a [[smartphone]].

[[Comparison of optical character recognition software|Various commercial and open source OCR systems]] are available for most common [[writing system]]s, including Latin, Cyrillic, Arabic, Hebrew, Indic, Bengali (Bangla), Devanagari, Tamil, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters.

==Applications==
OCR engines have been developed into many kinds of domain-specific OCR applications, such as receipt OCR, invoice OCR, check OCR, legal billing document OCR.

They can be used for:
* [[Data entry clerk|Data entry]] for business documents, e.g. [[check clearing|check]], passport, invoice, bank statement and receipt
* [[Automatic number plate recognition]]
*In airports, for passport recognition and information extraction
* Automatic insurance documents key information extraction
* Extracting business card information into a contact list&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://community.havenondemand.com/t5/Blog/javascript-Using-OCR-and-Entity-Extraction-for-LinkedIn-Company/ba-p/460|title=[javascript] Using OCR and Entity Extraction for LinkedIn Company Lookup|date=22 July 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* More quickly make textual versions of printed documents, e.g. [[book scanning]] for [[Project Gutenberg]]
* Make electronic images of printed documents searchable, e.g. [[Google Books]]
* Converting handwriting in real time to control a computer ([[pen computing]])
* Defeating [[CAPTCHA]] anti-bot systems, though these are specifically designed to prevent OCR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andrewt.net/blog/how-to-crack-captchas/ |title=How To Crack Captchas |publisher=andrewt.net |date=2006-06-28 |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~mori/research/gimpy/ |title=Breaking a Visual CAPTCHA |publisher=Cs.sfu.ca |date=2002-12-10 |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Resig |url=http://ejohn.org/blog/ocr-and-neural-nets-in-javascript/ |title=John Resig – OCR and Neural Nets in JavaScript |publisher=Ejohn.org |date=2009-01-23 |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose can also be to test the robustness of CAPTCHA anti-bot systems.
* Assistive technology for blind and visually impaired users

==Types==
* Optical character recognition (OCR){{spaced ndash}}targets typewritten text, one [[glyph]] or [[character (symbol)|character]] at a time.
* Optical word recognition{{spaced ndash}}targets typewritten text, one word at a time (for languages that use a [[Space (punctuation)|space]] as a [[word divider]]).  (Usually just called "OCR".)
* [[Intelligent character recognition]] (ICR){{spaced ndash}}also targets handwritten [[printscript]] or [[cursive]] text one glyph or character at a time, usually involving [[machine learning]].
* [[Intelligent word recognition]] (IWR){{spaced ndash}}also targets handwritten [[printscript]] or [[cursive]] text, one word at a time.  This is especially useful for languages where glyphs are not separated in cursive script.

OCR is generally an "offline" process, which analyses a static document. [[Handwriting movement analysis]] can be used as input to [[handwriting recognition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tappert | first1 = C. C. | last2 = Suen | first2 = C. Y. | last3 = Wakahara | first3 = T. | doi = 10.1109/34.57669 | title = The state of the art in online handwriting recognition | journal = IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence | volume = 12 | issue = 8 | pages = 787 | year = 1990 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of merely using the shapes of glyphs and words, this technique is able to capture motions, such as the order in which [[Segment (handwriting)|segments]] are drawn, the direction, and the pattern of putting the pen down and lifting it.  This additional information can make the end-to-end process more accurate.  This technology is also known as "on-line character recognition", "dynamic character recognition", "real-time character recognition", and "intelligent character recognition".

==Techniques==

===Pre-processing===
OCR software often "pre-processes" images to improve the chances of successful recognition. Techniques include:&lt;ref name="nicomsoft"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nicomsoft.com/optical-character-recognition-ocr-how-it-works/ |title=Optical Character Recognition (OCR) – How it works |publisher=Nicomsoft.com |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* De-[[Skew (fax)|skew]]{{spaced ndash}}If the document was not aligned properly when scanned, it may need to be tilted a few degrees clockwise or counterclockwise in order to make lines of text perfectly horizontal or vertical.
* [[Despeckle]]{{spaced ndash}}remove positive and negative spots, smoothing edges
* Binarisation{{spaced ndash}}Convert an image from color or [[greyscale]] to black-and-white (called a "[[binary image]]" because there are two colours). The task of binarisation is performed as a simple way of separating the text (or any other desired image component) from the background.&lt;ref name=Sezgin2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sezgin|first1=Mehmet|last2=Sankur|first2=Bulent|title=Survey over image thresholding techniques and quantitative performance evaluation|journal=Journal of Electronic imaging|date=2004|volume=13|issue=1|page=146|url=http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~nray1/CMPUT605/track3_papers/Threshold_survey.pdf|accessdate=2 May 2015|bibcode=2004JEI....13..146S|doi=10.1117/1.1631315}}&lt;/ref&gt; The task of binarisation itself is necessary since most commercial recognition algorithms work only on binary images since it proves to be simpler to do so.&lt;ref name=Gupta2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gupta|first1=Maya R.|last2=Jacobson|first2=Nathaniel P.|last3=Garcia|first3=Eric K.|title=OCR binarisation and image pre-processing for searching historical documents.|journal=Pattern Recognition|date=2007|volume=40|issue=2|page=389|url=http://www.rfai.li.univ-tours.fr/fr/ressources/_dh/DOC/DocOCR/OCRbinarisation.pdf|accessdate=2 May 2015|doi=10.1016/j.patcog.2006.04.043}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the effectiveness of the binarisation step influences to a significant extent the quality of the character recognition stage and the careful decisions are made in the choice of the binarisation employed for a given input image type; since the quality of the binarisation method employed to obtain the binary result depends on the type of the input image (scanned document, scene text image, historical degraded document etc.).&lt;ref name=Trier1995&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trier|first1=Oeivind Due|last2=Jain|first2=Anil K.|title=Goal-directed evaluation of binarisation methods.|journal=IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence|date=1995|volume=17|issue=12|pages=1191–1201|url=http://heim.ifi.uio.no/inf386/trier2.pdf|accessdate=2 May 2015|doi=10.1109/34.476511}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Milyaev2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milyaev|first1=Sergey|last2=Barinova|first2=Olga|last3=Novikova|first3=Tatiana|last4=Kohli|first4=Pushmeet|last5=Lempitsky|first5=Victor|title=Image binarisation for end-to-end text understanding in natural images.|journal=Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR) 2013|date=2013|volume=12th International Conference on|url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/pkohli/papers/mbnlk_icdar2013.pdf|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Line removal{{spaced ndash}}Cleans up non-glyph boxes and lines&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://grooper.com/image-optimization.html|title=Image Optimization|last=|first=|date=September 20, 2018|website=Grooper Document Capture|at=Bottom of the web page|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Document Layout Analysis|Layout analysis]] or "zoning"{{spaced ndash}}Identifies columns, paragraphs, captions, etc. as distinct blocks.  Especially important in [[Column (typography)|multi-column layouts]] and [[Table (information)|tables]].
* Line and word detection{{spaced ndash}}Establishes baseline for word and character shapes, separates words if necessary.
* Script recognition{{spaced ndash}}In multilingual documents, the script may change at the level of the words and hence, identification of the script is necessary, before the right OCR can be invoked to handle the specific script.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference  | last1=Pati  | first1=P.B.  | last2= Ramakrishnan    |  first2=A.G.  |  title = Word Level Multi-script Identification  | date =1987-05-29  | journal=Pattern Recognition Letters, Vol. 29, pp. 1218 - 1229, 2008 | doi=10.1016/j.patrec.2008.01.027 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Character isolation or "segmentation"{{spaced ndash}}For per-character OCR, multiple characters that are connected due to image artifacts must be separated; single characters that are broken into multiple pieces due to artifacts must be connected.
* Normalise [[aspect ratio]] and [[Scale (ratio)|scale]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.damiles.com/2008/11/20/basic-ocr-in-opencv.html |title=Basic OCR in OpenCV &amp;#124; Damiles |publisher=Blog.damiles.com |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Segmentation of [[fixed-pitch font]]s is accomplished relatively simply by aligning the image to a uniform grid based on where vertical grid lines will least often intersect black areas.  For [[proportional font]]s, more sophisticated techniques are needed because whitespace between letters can sometimes be greater than that between words, and vertical lines can intersect more than one character.&lt;ref name="Tesseract overview" /&gt;

===Character recognition===
There are two basic types of core OCR algorithm, which may produce a ranked list of candidate characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dataid.com/aboutocr.htm |title=OCR Introduction |publisher=Dataid.com |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matrix matching involves comparing an image to a stored glyph on a pixel-by-pixel basis; it is also known as "pattern matching", "[[pattern recognition]]", or "[[digital image correlation|image correlation]]". This relies on the input glyph being correctly isolated from the rest of the image, and on the stored glyph being in a similar font and at the same scale.  This technique works best with typewritten text and does not work well when new fonts are encountered.  This is the technique the early physical photocell-based OCR implemented, rather directly.

Feature extraction decomposes glyphs into "features" like lines, closed loops, line direction, and line intersections.  The extraction features reduces the dimensionality of the representation and makes the recognition process computationally efficient. These features are compared with an abstract vector-like representation of a character, which might reduce to one or more glyph prototypes.  General techniques of [[Feature detection (computer vision)|feature detection in computer vision]] are applicable to this type of OCR, which is commonly seen in "intelligent" [[handwriting recognition]] and indeed most modern OCR software.&lt;ref name="ocrwizard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocrwizard.com/ocr-software/how-ocr-software-works.html |title=How OCR Software Works |publisher=OCRWizard |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nearest neighbour classifiers]] such as the [[k-nearest neighbors algorithm]] are used to compare image features with stored glyph features and choose the nearest match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.damiles.com/2008/11/14/the-basic-patter-recognition-and-classification-with-opencv.html |title=The basic pattern recognition and classification with openCV &amp;#124; Damiles |publisher=Blog.damiles.com |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Software such as [[CuneiForm (software)|Cuneiform]] and [[Tesseract (software)|Tesseract]] use a two-pass approach to character recognition.  The second pass is known as "adaptive recognition" and uses the letter shapes recognised with high confidence on the first pass to recognise better the remaining letters on the second pass.  This is advantageous for unusual fonts or low-quality scans where the font is distorted (e.g. blurred or faded).&lt;ref name="Tesseract overview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tesseract-ocr.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/tesseracticdar2007.pdf|title=An Overview of the Tesseract OCR Engine|year=2007|accessdate=2013-05-23|author=Ray Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OCR result can be stored in the standardised [[ALTO (XML)|ALTO]] format, a dedicated XML schema maintained by the United States [[Library of Congress]].

For a list of optical character recognition software see [[Comparison of optical character recognition software]].

===Post-processing===
OCR accuracy can be increased if the output is constrained by a [[lexicon]]{{spaced ndash}}a list of words that are allowed to occur in a document.&lt;ref name="nicomsoft" /&gt;  This might be, for example, all the words in the English language, or a more technical lexicon for a specific field.  This technique can be problematic if the document contains words not in the lexicon, like [[proper noun]]s. Tesseract uses its dictionary to influence the character segmentation step, for improved accuracy.&lt;ref name="Tesseract overview" /&gt;

The output stream may be a [[plain text]] stream or file of characters, but more sophisticated OCR systems can preserve the original layout of the page and produce, for example, an annotated [[PDF]] that includes both the original image of the page and a searchable textual representation.

"Near-neighbor analysis" can make use of [[co-occurrence]] frequencies to correct errors, by noting that certain words are often seen together.&lt;ref name="explain"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.explainthatstuff.com/how-ocr-works.html |title=How does OCR document scanning work? |publisher=Explain that Stuff |date=2012-01-30 |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, "Washington, D.C." is generally far more common in English than "Washington DOC".

Knowledge of the grammar of the language being scanned can also help determine if a word is likely to be a verb or a noun, for example, allowing greater accuracy.

The [[Levenshtein distance|Levenshtein Distance]] algorithm has also been used in OCR post-processing to further optimize results from an OCR API.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://community.havenondemand.com/t5/Wiki/How-to-optimize-results-from-the-OCR-API-when-extracting-text/ta-p/1656|title=How to optimize results from the OCR API when extracting text from an image? - Haven OnDemand Developer Community|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Application-specific optimisations===
In recent years,{{when|date=March 2013}} the major OCR technology providers began to tweak OCR systems to better deal with specific types of input.  Beyond an application-specific lexicon, better performance can be had by taking into account business rules, standard expression,{{clarify|date=March 2013}} or rich information contained in color images.  This strategy is called "Application-Oriented OCR" or "Customised OCR", and has been applied to OCR of [[license plate]]s, [[invoice]]s, [[screenshot]]s, [[ID card]]s, [[driver license]]s, and [[automobile manufacturing]].

==Workarounds==
There are several techniques for solving the problem of character recognition by means other than improved OCR algorithms.

===Forcing better input===
Special fonts like [[OCR-A font|OCR-A]], [[OCR-B]], or [[MICR]] fonts, with precisely specified sizing, spacing, and distinctive character shapes, allow a higher accuracy rate during transcription in bank check processing. Ironically however, several prominent OCR engines were designed to capture text in popular fonts such as Arial or Times New Roman, and are incapable of capturing text in these fonts that are specialized and much different from popularly used fonts. As Google Tesseract can be trained to recognize new fonts, it can recognize OCR-A, OCR-B and MICR fonts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://trainyourtesseract.com/|title=Train Your Tesseract|last=|first=|date=September 20, 2018|website=Train Your Tesseract|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

"Comb fields" are pre-printed boxes that encourage humans to write more legibly{{spaced ndash}}one glyph per box.&lt;ref name="explain" /&gt;  These are often printed in a [[Drop out ink|"dropout color"]] which can be easily removed by the OCR system.&lt;ref name="explain" /&gt;

[[Palm OS]] used a special set of glyphs, known as "[[Graffiti (Palm OS)|Graffiti]]" which are similar to printed English characters but simplified or modified for easier recognition on the platform's computationally limited hardware. Users would need to learn how to write these special glyphs.

Zone-based OCR restricts the image to a specific part of a document.  This is often referred to as "Template OCR".

===Crowdsourcing===
[[Crowdsourcing]] humans to perform the character recognition can quickly process images like computer-driven OCR, but with higher accuracy for recognising images than is obtained with computers.  Practical systems include the [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] and [[reCAPTCHA]]. The [[National Library of Finland]] has developed an online interface for users correct OCRed texts in the standardised ALTO format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.helsinki.fi/fennougrica/2014/02/21/ocr-text-editor/|title=What is the point of an online interactive OCR text editor? - Fenno-Ugrica|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crowdsourcing has also been used not to perform character recognition directly but to invite software developers to develop image processing algorithms, for example, through the use of [[Tournament theory|rank-order tournaments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Riedl, C. |author2=Zanibbi, R. |author3=Hearst, M. A. |author4=Zhu, S. |author5=Menietti, M. |author6=Crusan, J. |author7=Metelsky, I. |author8=Lakhani, K. |title=Detecting Figures and Part Labels in Patents: Competition-Based Development of Image Processing Algorithms |journal=[[International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition]] |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=155 |date=20 February 2016 |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s10032-016-0260-8 |bibcode= |doi=10.1007/s10032-016-0260-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accuracy==
{{update|date=March 2013}}
Commissioned by the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] (DOE), the Information Science Research Institute (ISRI) had the mission to foster the improvement of automated technologies for understanding machine printed documents, and it conducted the most authoritative of the ''Annual Test of OCR Accuracy'' from 1992 to 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://code.google.com/p/isri-ocr-evaluation-tools/|title= Code and Data to evaluate OCR accuracy, originally from UNLV/ISRI|publisher=Google Code Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognition of [[Latin alphabet|Latin-script]], typewritten text is still not 100% accurate even where clear imaging is available. One study based on recognition of 19th- and early 20th-century newspaper pages concluded that character-by-character OCR accuracy for commercial OCR software varied from 81% to 99%;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; total accuracy can be achieved by human review or Data Dictionary Authentication. Other areas—including recognition of hand printing, [[cursive]] handwriting, and printed text in other scripts (especially those East Asian language characters which have many strokes for a single character)—are still the subject of active research. The [[MNIST database]] is commonly used for testing systems' ability to recognise handwritten digits.

Accuracy rates can be measured in several ways, and how they are measured can greatly affect the reported accuracy rate. For example, if word context (basically a lexicon of words) is not used to correct software finding non-existent words, a character error rate of 1% (99% accuracy) may result in an error rate of 5% (95% accuracy) or worse if the measurement is based on whether each whole word was recognised with no incorrect letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference  | last1=Suen  | first1=C.Y.  | last2= Plamondon    |  first2=R.  | last3= Tappert  | first3=A.  | last4=Thomassen  | first4=A.  | last5=Ward  | first5=J.R.  | last6=Yamamoto  | first6=K.  | title = Future Challenges in Handwriting and Computer Applications  | date =1987-05-29  | conference=3rd International Symposium on Handwriting and Computer Applications, Montreal, May 29, 1987  | url=http://users.erols.com/rwservices/pens/biblio88.html#Suen88  | accessdate = 2008-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the difficulties inherent in digitising old text is the inability of OCR to differentiate between the "[[long s]]" and "f" characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Research and Advanced Technology for Digital Libraries|author=Sarantos Kapidakis, Cezary Mazurek, Marcin Werla|date=2015|page=257|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319245928|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kEyGCgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=OCR+and+long+s&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Web-based OCR systems for recognising hand-printed text on the fly have become well known as commercial products in recent years{{when|date=March 2013}} (see [[tablet computer|Tablet PC history]]). Accuracy rates of 80% to 90% on neat, clean hand-printed characters can be achieved by [[pen computing]] software, but that accuracy rate still translates to dozens of errors per page, making the technology useful only in very limited applications.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Recognition of cursive text is an active area of research, with recognition rates even lower than that of hand-printed text. Higher rates of recognition of general cursive script will likely not be possible without the use of contextual or grammatical information. For example, recognising entire words from a dictionary is easier than trying to parse individual characters from script. Reading the ''Amount'' line of a [[cheque]] (which is always a written-out number) is an example where using a smaller dictionary can increase recognition rates greatly. The shapes of individual cursive characters themselves simply do not contain enough information to accurately (greater than 98%) recognise all handwritten cursive script.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}} 

Most programs allow users to set "confidence rates". This means that if the software does not achieve their desired level of accuracy, a user can be notified for manual review.

==UNICODE==
{{Main article|Optical Character Recognition (Unicode block)}}

Characters to support OCR were added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in June 1993, with the release of version 1.1.

Some of these characters are mapped from fonts specific to [[MICR]], [[OCR-A]] or [[OCR-B]].

'''Parabaik''' ({{lang-my|ပုရပိုက်}}; {{IPA-my|pəɹəbaiʔ|pron}}) is a type of [[paper]], made of thick sheets of paper that are blackened, glued, and folded together. Along with paper made from [[bamboo paper|bamboo]] and [[palm leaf paper|palm leaves]],{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=556}} parabaiks were the main medium for writing and drawing in [[early modern period|early modern]] [[Myanmar|Burma/Myanmar]].&lt;ref name=vr-4-14&gt;Raghavan 1979: 4–14&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
There are two types of parabaiks: historically, '''black parabaiks''' ({{lang|my|ပုရပိုက်နက်}}) were the main medium of writing while the '''white parabaiks''' ({{lang|my|ပုရပိုက်ဖြူ}}) were used for paintings and drawings. The extant black parabaiks consist of works of scientific and technical importance like medicine, mathematics, astronomy, astrology, history, social and economic commentary, music, historical ballads, fiction, poetry, etc. The extant '''white parabaiks''' show colored drawings of kings and court activities, stories, social customs and manners, houses, dresses, hair styles, ornaments, &amp;c.&lt;ref name=vr-6&gt;Raghavan 1979: 6&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of [[Burmese chronicles]] were originally written on parabaiks.&lt;ref name=uhp-37&gt;Hla Pe 1985: 37&lt;/ref&gt; A 1979 UN study finds that "thousands upon thousands" of rolls of ancient parabaiks were found (usually in monasteries and in homes of private collectors) across the country but the vast majority were not properly maintained.&lt;ref name=vr-4-14&gt;Raghavan 1979: 4–14&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NATIVE AMERICAN INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF EL SALVADOR IN CENTRAL AMERICA ISTHMUS.png|thumb|right|El Salvador's indigenous groups at the time of the [[Spanish conquest of El Salvador|Spanish conquest]]]]
'''Pipil''' (natively '''Nawat''') is a Uto-[[Toltec]] or Uto-[[Nicarao language|Nicarao]] language of the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]] family, which stretches from [[Utah]] in the [[United States]] down through [[El Salvador]] to [[Nicaragua]] in [[Central America]]. The name of the language family was created to show that it includes the greatest extent perimeter from the [[Ute language]] of [[Utah]], to the former [[Toltec]] predecessor and the expanse margin Pipil-[[Nicarao people|Nicarao]] successors,&lt;ref name="Campbell1985"&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Lyle|title=The Pipil Language of El Salvador|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N5bmUh7jproC&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=January 1, 1985|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-088199-8|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was spoken in several parts of present-day Central America before the [[Spanish conquest]]. Although it has been on the verge of extinction in western [[El Salvador]] and has already gone extinct elsewhere in [[Central America]], as of 2012, new second language speakers are starting to appear.

In El Salvador, Nawat was the language of several tribes: [[Nonualcos]], [[Cuscatlecos]], [[Mazahuas (El Salvador)|Mazahuas]], and [[Izalcos]]. The name ''Pipil'' for this language is used by the international scholarly community, chiefly to differentiate it more clearly from [[Nahuatl]]. In this article the name ''Nawat'' will be used whenever there is no risk of ambiguity.

==Status==
Most authors refer to this language by the names ''Pipil'' or ''Nawat''. However, ''Nawat'' (along with the synonymous ''Eastern Nahuatl'') has also been used to refer to Nahuatl [[Variety (linguistics)|language varieties]] in southern [[Veracruz]], [[Tabasco]], and [[Chiapas]], states in the south of Mexico, that like Pipil have reduced the earlier /t͡ɬ/ consonant (a lateral [[affricate]]) to a /t/.&lt;ref&gt;Ligorred, E: ''Lenguas Indígenas de México y Centroamérica''&lt;/ref&gt; Those Mexican [[lect]]s share more similarities with Nawat than do the other Nahuatl varieties.

Pipil specialists ([[Lyle Campbell|Campbell]], Fidias Jiménez, [[Pedro Geoffroy Rivas|Geoffroy Rivas]], [[Alan R. King|King]], [[Jorge Ernesto Lemus|Lemus]], and Schultze, ''inter alia'') generally treat Pipil/Nawat as a separate language, at least in practice. [[Yolanda Lastra|Lastra de Suárez]] (1986) and [[Una Canger|Canger]] (1988) classify Pipil among "Eastern Periphery" dialects of Nahuatl.

==Classification==
(Campbell 1985)
*Uto-Aztecan
**Southern Uto-Aztecan
***Nahuan (Aztecan, Nahuatlan)
****Pochutec ''(extinct)''
****General Aztec
*****Core Nahua
*****Pipil

Uto-Aztecan is uncontroversially divided into eight branches, including Nahuan. Research continues into verifying higher level groupings. However, the grouping adopted by Campbell of the four southernmost branches is not yet universally accepted.

==Status==
As of 2012, extensive [http://alanrking.info/nawat.php online resources for learning Nawat] are available at the website of linguist Alan R. King, including video lessons and a Facebook group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A video documentation project is also underway, in collaboration with the [[Living Tongues Institute]], focusing on "Pipil culture, such as natural medicines, traditions, traditional games, agricultural practices, and childhood songs," which is intended for language learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The varieties of Nawat in [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], and [[Panama]] are now [[extinct language|extinct]]. In El Salvador, Nawat is endangered: it is spoken mostly by a few elderly speakers in the Salvadoran departments of [[Sonsonate Department|Sonsonate]] and [[Ahuachapán Department|Ahuachapán]]. The towns of [[Cuisnahuat]] and [[Santo Domingo, San Vicente|Santo Domingo de Guzmán]] have the highest concentration of speakers. Campbell's 1985 estimate (based on fieldwork conducted 1970–1976) was 200 speakers. Gordon (2005) reports only 20 speakers were left in 1987. Official Mexican reports have recorded as many as 2000 speakers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

The exact number of speakers has been difficult to determine because persecution of Pipil speakers throughout the 20th century (massacres after suppression of the [[1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising]], laws that made speaking Nawat illegal) made them conceal their use of the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

A young Nawat language activist, Carlos Cortez, explained in 2010 that this fear is worse for older speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

A few small-scale projects to revitalize Nawat in El Salvador have been attempted since 1990. The Asociación Coordinadora de Comunidades Indígenas de El Salvador ([http://www.oekohaus-rostock.de/accies/ ACCIES] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302090700/http://www.oekohaus-rostock.de/accies/ |date=2 March 2007 }}) and [http://www.udb.edu.sv/ Universidad Don Bosco] of San Salvador have both produced some teaching materials.

Thus, as the number of native speakers continues to dwindle, there is growing interest in some quarters in keeping the language alive, but as of 2002, the national government had not joined these efforts (cf. Various, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

According to a 2009 report in ''[[El Diario de Hoy]],'' Nawat had started to make a comeback as a result of the preservation and revitalization efforts of various non-profit organizations in conjunction with several universities, combined with a post-civil war resurgence of Pipil identity in El Salvador. In the 1980s, Nawat had about 200 speakers. By 2009, 3,000 people were participating in Nawat language learning programs, the vast majority being young people, giving rise to hopes that the language might be pulled back from the brink of extinction.&lt;ref name="elsalvador.com"&gt;{{Cite news

Dallas, Texas: SIL International. {{ISBN|9781556712166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaufman (1970:66) lists [[Escuintla]] and [[Comapa, Jutiapa|Comapa]] as former Pipil-speaking areas of [[Guatemala]], and [[San Agustín Acasaguastlán]] as a former "Mejicano"-speaking town.&lt;ref&gt;[[Terrence Kaufman|Kaufman, Terrence]]. 1970. ''Proyecto de alfabetos y ortografías para escribir las lenguas mayances''. Antigua: Editorial José de Pineda Ibarra.&lt;/ref&gt; The genetic position of San Agustín Acasaguastlán Mejicano is still uncertain (''see [[Alagüilac language]]''). However, Nahuan languages are currently no longer spoken in Guatemala.

==Pipil and Nahuatl compared==

{{main|Pipil grammar}}

===Phonology===
Two salient features of Pipil are found in several Mexican dialects: the change of [t͡ɬ] to [t] and [u] rather than [o] as the predominant [[allophone]] of a single basic rounded vowel phoneme. These features are thus characteristic but not diagnostic.

However, Pipil {{IPA|/t/}} corresponds to not only the two Classical Nahuatl sounds {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/t͡ɬ/}} but also a word final ''saltillo'' or [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|/ʔ/}} in nominal plural suffixes (e.g. Pipil ''-met'' : Classical ''-meh'') and verbal plural endings (Pipil ''-t'' present plural, ''-ket'' past plural, etc.). This fact has been claimed by Campbell to be diagnostic for the position of Pipil in a genetic classification, on the assumption that this /t/ is more archaic than the Classical Nahuatl reflex, where the direction change has been {{IPA|/t/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ʔ/}} ''saltillo''.

One other characteristic phonological feature is the merger in Pipil of original geminate {{IPA|/ll/}} with single {{IPA|/l/}}.

===Grammar===
{{main|Pipil grammar}}
Pipil lacks some grammatical features present in Classical Nahuatl, such as the past prefix ''o-'' in verbs. It distributes others differently: for example, 'subtractive' past formation, which is very common in the classical language, exists in Pipil but is much rarer. On the other hand, [[reduplication]] to form plural nouns, of more limited distribution in the language of the Aztecs, is greatly generalised in Pipil. Still other grammatical features that were productive in Classical Nahuatl have left only fossilised traces in Pipil: for example, synchronically Pipil has no [[postposition]]s, although a few lexical forms derive etymologically from older postpositional forms, e.g. ''apan'' 'river' &lt; *'in/on the water', ''kujtan'' 'uncultivated land, forest' &lt; *'under the trees'; these are synchronically unanalyzable in modern Pipil.

Pipil has developed two widely used [[Article (grammar)|article]]s, [[definite article|definite]] ''ne'' and [[indefinite article|indefinite]] ''se''. The [[demonstrative]] pronouns/determiners ''ini'' 'this, these' and ''uni'' 'that, those' are also distinctively Pipil in form. The obligatory marking of [[grammatical number|number]] extends in Pipil to almost all [[plural]] [[noun phrase]]s (regardless of [[animacy]]), which will contain at least one plural form, most commonly marked by [[reduplication]].

Many nouns are invariable for [[construct state|state]], since ''-ti'' (cf. Classical ''-tli'', the absolute suffix after consonants) is rarely added to polysyllabic noun stems, while the Classical postconsonantal construct suffix, ''-wi'', is altogether unknown in Pipil: thus ''sin-ti'' 'maize' : ''nu-sin'' 'my maize', ''uj-ti'' 'way' : ''nu-uj'' 'my way', ''mistun'' 'cat' : ''nu-mistun'' 'my cat'.

An important number of nouns lack absolute forms and occur only [[Possession (linguistics)|inalienably]] possessed, e.g. ''nu-mey'' 'my hand' (but not *''mey'' or *''mey-ti''), ''nu-nan'' 'my mother' (but not *''nan'' or *''nan-ti''), thus further reducing the number of absolute-construct oppositions and the incidence of absolute ''-ti'' in comparison to Classical Nahuatl.

[[Postposition]]s have been eliminated from the Pipil grammatical system, and some monosyllabic [[preposition]]s originating from [[relational noun|relational]]s have become [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]].

To form the [[past tense]], most Pipil verbs add ''-k'' (after vowels) or ''-ki'' (after consonants, following loss of the final vowel of the present stem), e.g. ''ki-neki'' 'he wants it' : ''ki-neki-k'' 'he wanted it', ''ki-mati'' 'he knows it' : ''ki-mat-ki'' 'he knew it'. The mechanism of simply removing the present stem vowel to form past stems, so common in Classical Nahuatl, is limited in Pipil to polysyllabic verb stems such as ''ki-talia'' 'he puts it' → ''ki-tali(j)'' 'he put it', ''mu-talua'' 'he runs' → ''mu-talu(j)'' 'he ran', and a handful of other verbs, e.g. ''ki-tajtani'' 'he asks him' → ''ki-tajtan'' 'he asked him'.

Pipil has a [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] in ''-tuk'' (synchronically unanalyzable), plural ''-tiwit''. Another tense suffix, ''-tuya'', functions both as a [[pluperfect]] (''k-itz-tuya ne takat'' 'he had seen the man') and as an [[imperfect]] of [[stative]] verbs (''inte weli-tuya'' 'he couldn't'), in the latter case having supplanted the ''-ya'' imperfect found in Mexican dialects.

Pipil has two [[Conditional mood|conditional]] tenses, one in ''-skia'' expressing possible conditions and possible results, and one in ''-tuskia'' for impossible ones, although the distinction is sometimes blurred in practice. A [[future tense]] in ''-s'' (plural ''-sket'') is attested but rarely used, a [[periphrastic]] future being preferred, e.g. ''yawi witz'' (or ''yu-witz'') 'he will come'.

In [[serial verb|serial]] constructions, the [[present tense]] (really the [[markedness|unmarked]] tense) is generally found except in the first verb, regardless of the tense of the latter, e.g. ''kineki / kinekik / kinekiskia kikwa'' 'he wants / wanted / would like to eat it'.

There are also some differences regarding how [[prefix]]es are attached to verb-initial stems; principally, that in Pipil the prefixes ''ni-'', ''ti-'', ''shi-'' and ''ki-'' when word-initial retain their ''i'' in most cases, e.g. ''ni-ajsi'' 'I arrive', ''ki-elkawa'' 'he forgets it'.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3073">'''Rikuda Potash''' (1906–May 15, 1965)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; was a Polish-born Israeli [[Yiddish|Yiddish language]] poet and short story writer.  [[Sholem Asch]] called her "the Poetess of [[Jerusalem]]".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/potash-rikudah|title=Rikudah Potash {{!}} Jewish Women's Archive|website=jwa.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Potash was born in [[Ojców]].  Her father [[Yekutiel Potash]] was a correspondent for the Yiddish newspaper ''[[Unzer Lebn]]''.   Her brother Mordekhai Narkiss (1898–1957) later became director of the [[Israel Museum|Bezalel Museum]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Potash's early work was written and published in [[Polish language|Polish]], but following the [[Lwów pogrom (1918)|Lwów pogrom]] of 1918 she turned to Yiddish.  Beginning in 1922 she published a variety of works in Yiddish, including nature poetry, short stories, children's stories, and translations of Polish works.  In 1924, she moved to [[Łódź]], which at the time had the Poland's second-largest population of Jews and was a center of [[Modernism|modernist]] experimentation.  She married poet [[Khayim-Leyb Fuks]] (1897–1953) and they had a daughter,  Avivit, in 1926.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chaver|first=Yael|date=2007-01-01|title="How Shall I, So Poor, Go Forth?" The European Poetry of Rikuda Potash|jstor=10.2979/pft.2007.27.1.54|journal=Prooftexts|volume=27|issue=1|pages=54–81|doi=10.2979/pft.2007.27.1.54}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She first came to widespread attention after the inclusion of four of her poems in [[Ezra Korman]]'s ''Yidishe dikhterins: antologye'' ("Yiddish Women Poets: Anthology", 1928).  Her first collection of poetry, ''Vint oyf klavishn'' ("Wind on Keys"), was published in Łódź in 1934.  The title refers to the lyre of King David, which, according to [[Berakhot (Talmud)|''Berakhot'']], hung over his bed and played by itself when the wind blew across it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1934, she divorced Fuks and emmigrated with Avivit to Jerusalem, where she worked as librarian for the [[Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design|Bezalel Art School and Museum]] for the rest of her life.  She published two more volumes of poetry, ''Fun Kidron Tol'' (1952) and ''Moled iber Timma'' (1959).  Two more books were published posthumously, ''Lider'' ("Poems", 1967) and ''Geslekh fun Yerusholayim'' ("In the Alleys of Jerusalem", 1968), the latter her only collection of prose, stories about [[Mizrahi Jews|Mizrahii]] immigrants to Israel and their children.

==The practice==
The ''Riyaaz'' or ''Sadhakam'', which often starts early in the morning at four,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Bonding with the Gurus|author= |url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2008/07/04/stories/2008070451360300.htm |newspaper= The Hindu|date= |accessdate=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is taken seriously by the students for it requires intensity, discipline and commitment for years and forms an important component in the ''Guru - Shishya parampara'' (teacher-student tradition).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Music is the only Constant in my life:Asha Bhosle|author= |url= http://www.indianexpress.com/news/music-is-the-only-constant-in-my-life-asha/520017/|newspaper= Indian Express|date= |accessdate=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Carnatic music, the impression is that the assiduous sadhakam of the [[Trinity of Carnatic Music]] was the bedrock of the excellence of the old-world vidwans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Bakti and sadhaka - Pillars of Excellence|author= |url= http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/ms/2001/12/01/stories/2001120100020100.htm|newspaper= The Hindu|date= |accessdate=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an article of June 2015 SoundHound Inc. had raised a total of $40 million in funding from [[Global Catalyst Partners]], Translink Capital, Walden Venture Capital, and other investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/06/02/soundhound-app-emerges-to-take-on-apple-and-google-in-voice-search/|title=SoundHound App Emerges to Take On Apple and Google in Voice Search|date=2015-06-02|work=|publisher=Wall Street Journal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612042040/https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/06/02/soundhound-app-emerges-to-take-on-apple-and-google-in-voice-search/|archive-date=2015-06-12|via=|last1=Winkler|first1=Rolf|accessdate=2016-03-01|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included $7 million in a Series B funding round the company secured in October 2008, bringing total funds raised to $12 million at this time. The round was led by TransLink Capital with the participation of JAIC America and Series A investor Global Catalyst Partners. In 2009 it attracted additional funding from Larry Marcus at Walden Venture Capital, who had previously invested in music startups [[Pandora Radio|Pandora]] and [[SNOCAP|Snocap]]. The $4 million funding round was led by Walden Venture Capital VII, with the participation of an unnamed device manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wauters|first1=Robin|title=Music Search Startup SoundHound Partners With Spotify For Instant Streaming|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/25/music-search-startup-soundhound-partners-with-spotify-for-instant-streaming/|accessdate=1 March 2016|publisher=TechCrunch|date=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, the company raised another $75 million in an investment round that included [[Nvidia]], [[Samsung]], [[Kleiner Perkins Caulfield &amp; Byers]], and others. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/01/31/soundhound-raises-75-million-to-expand-access-to-its-houndify-voice-powered-platform/|title=SoundHound raises $75 million to expand access to its Houndify voice-powered platform|last=Yeung|first=Ken|date=2017-01-31|website=VentureBeat.com|publisher=VentureBeat|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[radio]] [[broadcasting]], '''stunting''' occurs when a [[radio station|station]] abruptly airs content that is seemingly uncharacteristic compared to what they normally play.  The tactic is commonly used when a station is about to undergo a major change (such as a change in [[radio format|format]], [[brand name|branding]], [[frequency]], ownership or management, or even the acquisition of a high-profile program or personality), or simply as a prank on listeners and rival broadcasters. Either way, stunting is intended as [[publicity stunt|a way to generate a greater amount of media publicity and audience attention]] to the station, by virtue of its shock value, than a straightforward format change could provide.  Depending on the station's situation and its management's preference, stunt formats can last anywhere from a few minutes to several weeks before the permanent change is launched.

==Types of radio stunting and noted examples==

===Continuous loop===
A station may stunt by repeating the same song or songs over and over on a continuous loop, sometimes hinting towards the new format.
* The song(s) in question are commonly in relation to the coming format or branding; in March 2014, San Francisco's [[KVVF]] and [[KVVZ]] stunted for 3 days with a loop of "[[Hot in Herre]]" by [[Nelly]], which led into their impending flip from a Spanish format to rhythmic contemporary ''Hot 105.7''. The stunt notably attracted mainstream media attention, with the [[hashtag]] "#nelly1057" being used to discuss the event on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/why-is-a-radio-station-playing-hot-in-herre-on-an-endless-loop-20140315|title=Why Is a Radio Station Playing 'Hot in Herre' on an Endless Loop?|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/stew/2014/03/15/latino-radio-station-wont-stop-playing-nellys-hot-in-herre/|title=Bay Area Latino radio station 105.7 won’t stop playing Nelly’s ‘Hot in Herre’|date=2014-03-15|work=SFGate Blog|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://radioinsight.com/blogs/88034/how-nelly1057-became-a-viral-sensation/|title=How #Nelly1057 Became A Viral Sensation|date=2014-03-16|work=RadioInsight|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Oftentimes the song chosen for the loop does not pertain to either the old or new format.  A prime example is [[XEWW-AM|XEAK]], [[San Diego]]/[[Tijuana]], which in one of the earliest radio stunts recorded played "Mope-itty Mope" by [[The Bosstones]] for 72 hours straight in 1961 before unveiling an [[all-news radio|all-news]] format, one of the first such radio formats in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asktog.com/lighterside/worstsong.html |title=The Bizarre Demise of Mighty 690 |first=Bruce |last=Tognazzini |work=AskTog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a reference to the [[Rickroll]] [[Internet meme|meme]], the new Toronto radio station [[CIND-FM]] stunted with a loop of [[Rick Astley]]'s "[[Never Gonna Give You Up]]" prior to its official launch as ''Indie 88''.&lt;ref name=postlaunch&gt;{{cite news|title=Indie88, Toronto's newest radio station, puts the listener in charge|url=http://arts.nationalpost.com/2013/07/31/indie88-torontos-newest-radio-station-puts-the-listener-in-charge/|accessdate=August 1, 2013|newspaper=National Post|date=July 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In May 1990, the staff of [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] radio station [[Triple J]] engaged in an [[industrial action]], protesting the suspension of its news director for playing a clip of the [[N.W.A.]] song "[[Fuck tha Police]]" in a segment discussing its subject matter (despite the full song having been played by the station without incident). During the action, Triple J played another N.W.A. song, "[[Express Yourself (N.W.A song)|Express Yourself]]", 82 times in a row. On April 28, 2014, in an homage to the event, ABC Dig Music began stunting with a loop of "Express Yourself" (including covers of the song by Australian musicians) to lead into its flip to Triple J's new sister station [[Double J (radio)|Double J]] on April 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/music/double-j-pays-homage-to-past-with-express-yourself-stunt-20140429-37emb.html|title=Double J pays homage to past with Express Yourself stunt|last=Vincent|first=Peter|date=2014-04-28|website=The Age|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/express-yourself-the-day-triple-j-played-the-same-nwa-song-82-times-in-a-row-20150902-gjdk0d.html|title=Express yourself: The day Triple J played the same N.W.A. song 82 times in a row|last=Casimir|first=Paul Chamberlin and Jon|date=2015-09-02|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*For four days before the July 8, 2012 relaunch of [[KOKE-FM]], a radio station in [[Austin, Texas]] that popularized [[progressive country]] in the early 1970s, a live recording of [[Dale Watson (singer)|Dale Watson's]] "Country My Ass" played in a continuous loop.  This example of stunting is notable for the station-specific nature of the song's lyrics.  Watson re-recorded the song for the occasion, adding a new coda in which he sings, "Now Austin's on track, 'cause KOKE-FM's back."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://radioinsight.com/headlines/58752/koke-fm-returning-to-austin/|title=KOKE-FM Returning To Austin|date=2012-07-04|work=RadioInsight|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sound effects===
In a prelude to a format flip, a series of audio clips and [[sound effects]] centered around a certain theme may be played. Known as a [[sound collage]], the theme under which these bits of audio fall may or may not have something to do with the previous and/or new format.
*A common stunting collage consists of [[construction site]] noises (sawing, hammering, etc.), signaling the building of a new station; two examples are this are [[WKRU|WZNN]]/[[Green Bay, WI]] (which transitioned to [[alternative rock]] in March 2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wisconsinbroadcasting.com/Format%20Change%20Files/WZNN%20Starts%20Stunting.mp3 |title=WZNN Starts Stunting |publisher=Wisconsin Broadcasting |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927181731/http://www.wisconsinbroadcasting.com/Format%20Change%20Files/WZNN%20Starts%20Stunting.mp3 |archivedate=2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[KROI]]/[[Houston]] (which transitioned from [[gospel music]] to [[all-news radio]] in November 2011).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zshare.net/audio/96396414de5f1771/ Audio of KROI's "construction" stunting in 11/2011]{{dead link|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The collage may include sounds of a [[test pattern]] tone, an [[explosion]] (to "blow up" the previous format), or the sound of a flat-lining and/or beating [[heart rate monitor]] (signifying the death of one format and the birth of another).  A classic example of this occurred when KLSX/[[Los Angeles]] transitioned from [[hot talk]] to [[Contemporary hit radio|CHR]] in February 2009.  The "explosion" was provided by ''[[The Tom Leykis Show]]'' upon its [[Tom Leykis#End of terrestrial radio broadcast|conclusion and cancellation]] (fittingly, the show's slogan was "Blow me up, Tom!"), followed by the sound of a flatlining and beating monitor, with a 3-minute montage of Top 40 acts and LA-centric soundbites leading up into the launch of the new Top 40 format (as [[KAMP-FM]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=bO17NIofISM|title=KLSX Format Switch}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Often the collage will give a hint at the new format, as happened when [[WMVP|WCFL]]/[[Chicago]] aired 2 hours of ocean wave sounds in its switch to the equally-soothing [[beautiful music]] in March 1975, and when [[WCBS-FM]]/[[New York City|New York]] played a half-hour of audio clips and songs with the word "Jack" excised as a lead-up to its new [[Jack FM]] format in June 2005. In July 2006, Statesville, North Carolina heritage country station 105.7 WFMX signed off from its longtime home in Statesville and moved to Clemmons, a suburb of Winston-Salem, in order to move the station from the Charlotte market, where owner Clear Channel (now iHeart Media) was one station over the market cap, to the Greensboro market, where they only had four FM stations and had room for one more. When the new transmitter was turned on, WFMX began stunting with a 12-minute loop of audio clips centered around the word "Kiss" before flipping to soft R&amp;B as "105.7 Kiss-FM." This station is now rock-flavored WVBZ "105.7 Man Up." The WFMX stunt loop, meanwhile, would later be incorporated into a longer stunt loop in Raleigh, North Carolina, when soft rocker WRSN "Sunny 93.9" flipped to rhythmic AC as "93.9 Kiss-FM" in December 2006. This station has since changed formats again, to its current country-flavored WNCB "B93.9" in November 2013.

===Sneak preview===
When changing formats, a station may be upfront about the nature of the new format by using a limited playlist of songs or highlights of the new format, an approach intended to preview what to expect after the format change takes place.
*[[WPEN (FM)|WJJZ]]/[[Philadelphia, PA]], in a transition from [[smooth jazz]], played the same 15 [[Hot AC]] songs over and over again, prior to permanently establishing a new Hot AC format as WNUW ("Now 97.5").
*After acquiring rights to ''[[The Rush Limbaugh Show]]'' from a rival station in April 2008, [[talk radio|talk]] station [[WRNO-FM]]/[[New Orleans]] stunted under the brand "Rush Radio", airing exclusively repeats of the show for a full week before returning to a schedule which integrated a single daily broadcast of Limbaugh's show into the station's normal program lineup.  WRNO's [[Greensboro, NC]] sister station, [[WPTI]], repeated this stunt the first week of January 2010. (Both stations would permanently adopt the "Rush Radio" branding.)
*The aforementioned [[WWIQ]]/[[Camden, New Jersey|Camden, NJ]] used a similar stunt in 2012, except with ''[[The Sean Hannity Show]]'' as the show of choice under the "Hannity @ 106.9" branding.
*Clear Channel introduced Progressive Talk on WXKS 1430 and WKOX 1200 in Boston with a loop featuring Neil Young's "Rockin in a Free World" and an audiobook snippet from Al Franken's "Lies" book ("Chapter 37. What is a Liar?") Franken's show was to be carried on the stations.
*When WXKS (AM), formerly WKOX, went to conservative talk in 2010, it took a similar approach to the above "Rush Radio" stations in March 2010, previewing its own "Rush Radio" format with a collage of the shows they would present (including ''Limbaugh'') along with patriotic speeches from American history.  KPMZ/[[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] took a similar route that same month, exclusively airing speeches by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] before installing a [[WBAP-FM|simulcast]] of sister talk station [[WBAP (AM)|WBAP]]. This was also done on WJKR (now [[WTOH]]) when flipping from adult hits to conservative talk as "98.9 The Answer".
*On August 7, 2014, Clear Channel sold off the entire [[intellectual property]] unit of conservative talker [[WPGB-FM]]/[[Pittsburgh]] to Frank Iorio, who was taking over operations of [[WJAS]]. WJAS dropped their longtime [[adult standards]] format at noon that day and began a three-hour simulcast of WPGB-FM (the duration of ''[[The Rush Limbaugh Show]]''). Both stations replaced all local commercial breaks with sweepers prompting listeners to move to WJAS, interspersed with a [[heart monitor]] sound effect. At 3 p.m., WPGB abruptly cut away from the top-of-the-hour newscast (fed from the [[Total Traffic Network]] facilities in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]]) and, after playing a few song snippets poking fun at the format change - notably ''[[No More Words (Berlin song)|No More Words]]'' by [[Berlin (band)|Berlin]] - debuted a [[country music]] format as "Big 104.7."&lt;ref&gt;http://formatchange.com/wpgb-becomes-big-104-7/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temporary formats===
Occasionally a station dropping an old format will stunt with a temporary transitional format, one intended to tease not so much the listener but competing stations who are not privy to the station's new plans.  The fake format, more often than not, is only intended as a transition to a new format or existing format adjustment. A similar, but smaller, effect can be produced by registering numerous [[domain name]]s suggesting various formats, in an effort to throw off "net gnomes" and generate buzz.
*The "Wheel of Formats" (a play on the game show ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'') is one variation of this, in which several short-lived formats are aired for a short time (between an hour and a day), then replaced by another equally short-lived format, then another, etc. until finally the new permanent format is revealed. These formats can range from legitimate mainstream formats to novelties that would never be seriously considered as a full-time format.
*On January 17, 1991, after 35 years as a full service [[top 40]]/[[adult contemporary]] station, [[WBZ-AM]]/[[Boston]] used [[Operation Desert Storm]] to subtly end their former format and transition to a mixed format of [[all news radio]] and [[talk radio]], pre-empting the format with continuing coverage of news from the Persian Gulf. By the declaration of 'end of combat' on February 28, the transition to News-Talk as "NewsRadio 1030" had been complete.
*In response to the aforementioned 2009 change of [[WCIS-FM|WOLF-FM]]/Syracuse, NY to [[country music]], competitor [[WSYR-FM|WPHR-FM]] temporarily changed its usual [[urban adult contemporary]] format to country as "Young Country 106.9," with WPHR changing back at the end of the weekend.  Usually, this type of stunt happens as part of a hedging effort—a station threatened by an upstart using a sister station to draw listeners away from the upstart (in this case, WPHR's sister station, [[WBBS]], using WPHR to fend off WOLF).
*In summer 2011, two stations who had recently been sold to the same new owner transitioned from [[alternative rock]] to [[all-news radio]] by using the same [[adult contemporary]] music transition branded as "FM New."  The stations, [[WKQX (FM)|WWWN]]/[[Chicago]] and [[WFAN-FM|WEMP]]/[[New York City|New York]], interspersed the music with news, traffic, and weather updates from personalities who would serve under the new "FM News" formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/95030/wemp-new-york-wakes-up-with-news-friday |title=WEMP/New York Wakes Up With News Friday |work=All Access Music Group |date=August 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In July 2008, [[WQNU|WRKA]]/[[Louisville, KY]] dropped their long-running oldies format with a long farewell montage. After some fake static (in which the conclusion of "[[Beginnings (Chicago song)|Beginnings]]" by [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]] could faintly be heard), the station was "relaunched" as "News Talk 103.1 WRKA," with a fake newscast similar in tone to sister station [[WSB (AM)|WSB]]/[[Atlanta, GA]]. (WSB's imaging voice, Jeff Davis, even voiced the station ID and a promo for "Louisville's Morning News.") Three minutes later, the "newscast" slowly became interference-ridden while airing a "Breaking [[Fox News]] Alert" of power failures around Louisville before fading into fake static again, to be followed by the unveiling of a [[country music]] format as [[WQNU]].&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=lS_1M_M6YB4|title=WRKA Radio, Louisville changes format 7-18-2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In July 2009, [[WWQM-FM]]/[[Madison, WI]] stunted with various formats during a 3-1/2 day period (including [[smooth jazz]] and [[novelty song]]s), only to emerge post-stunting with an adjusted version of its previous [[country music]] format.
*In October 2, 2009, [[WDZH|WVMV]]/[[Detroit]] dropped their long-running [[smooth jazz]] format by playing a montage of jingles and airchecks from a prior format on the station, [[album-oriented rock]] WLLZ "Detroit's Wheels." However, the first song played ("[[Welcome To The Jungle]]" by [[Guns 'n Roses]]) abruptly cut out with [[Kanye West MTV Video Music Awards controversy|Kanye West's 2009 MTV Video Music Awards outburst]], segueing into "[[Sweet Dreams (Beyoncé Knowles song)|Sweet Dreams]]" by [[Beyoncé]]. The station immediately switched to a CHR format initially dubbed "98.7 Takeover" (eventually titled "98.7 AMP Radio").&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=o_fl4Ldk0Es |title=WVMV Format Change}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On separate occasions in 2009, [[WVHT]]/[[Hampton Roads, VA]] and [[CIGM-FM|CIGM]].[[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury, ON]] both stunted a [[Chinese pop music]] format branded as "[[Kung Pao chicken|Kung Pao]]".
*In May 2009, [[WSKS]]/[[Utica, NY]] announced that, due to "financial constraints," its [[Contemporary hit radio|CHR]] format would be replaced by the [[beautiful music]] format similar to what was broadcast on sister station [[WUTQ-FM|WUTQ]].  The "change" came complete with on-air [[kayfabe]]-style complaining from the station's staff.  The "new format," however, lasted for only 2 hours before WSKS management came clean, restored the CHR format, and confirmed the stunt was a way to promote a new [[disc jockey]] lineup on the WSKS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Just a publicity stunt - KISS FM remains on air despite weekend claims | first=Dave | last=Dellecese | url=http://www.wktv.com/news/local/45294832.html | work=[[WKTV]] | date=2009-05-18 | accessdate=2009-05-18 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521103548/http://www.wktv.com/news/local/45294832.html | archive-date=2009-05-21 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*During [[Memorial Day]] weekend 2010, [[WJZX-FM]]/[[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] stunted with songs about adultery as [[Tiger Woods|"Tiger FM."]]  The station was expected to change to a [[Top 40]] format with the new call sign WNQW, but was beaten to the punch by [[WRNW|a competitor]]. With that avenue blocked, WNQW reverted to temporary formats with all-patriotic music and all-[[The Beatles|Beatles]] music before settling on a permanent format in June 2010 (as [[classic country]] station [[WNRG-FM|WZBK-FM]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Duane |last=Dudek |url=http://www.jsonline.com/entertainment/tvradio/95380169.html |title=Ratings games spur radio identity crisis |work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |date=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*As had occurred in the above all-Beatles stunt, a station may stunt temporarily with consecutive songs by the same artist, either as a tribute to the departing format or a clue to the new one. The former occurred when [[CHMT-FM]]/[[Timmins, Ontario|Timmins, ON]] played songs by Timmins native [[Shania Twain]] before changing from [[country music|country]] to [[adult hits]] in March 2006; the latter occurred when [[WHLD]]/[[Niagara Falls, NY]] transitioned from [[brokered programming]] to [[adult standards]] by playing [[Frank Sinatra]] songs exclusively in August 2010.
* In October 2014, after dropping a failing news radio format, [[KROI]] stunted as "B92", playing only songs by Houston native [[Beyoncé]], until switching to a [[classic hip-hop]] format known as "Boom 92".&lt;ref name=chron-boom&gt;{{cite news|title=Former news station turns to 'classic hip-hop'|url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Former-news-station-turns-to-classic-hip-hop-5820272.php|work=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=2 November 2014|date=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In June 29, 2016, [[WMGC-FM]] stopped broadcasting its sports format and started simulcasting sister station [[WCSX-FM]] HD-2, with an oldies format. On July 1st, the format was revealed to be Throwback R&amp;B, as 105.1 The Bounce.
* For a week in September 2013, [[WYDL]] stunted by playing Nothing but [[Elvis Presley]] after WYDL played [[Daylight (Maroon 5 song)|Daylight]] by [[Maroon 5]]. CHR Format returned to WYDL in 2017.

A station may stunt by temporarily formatting a series of [[novelty song]]s, a song style that usually wouldn't support itself as a stand-alone commercial radio format.
*On separate occasions in 2007, [[KBVB]]/[[Fargo, ND]] and [[KXLP]]/[[Mankato, MN]] repeated the song "[[Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport]]" by [[Rolf Harris]] for multiple days.
*[[WJMP]]/[[Kent, OH]], in a protest over the [[1994–95 Major League Baseball strike|1994 strike that affected Major League Baseball]], played 2 versions of "[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]" continuously, sunrise-to-sunset (the station [[Daytimer|operates only during daytime hours]]), for 2 months (and 57,161 total plays) from August to October 1994.  The stunt merited WJMP an entry in the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of Sports Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Here's one for the books |url=http://www.jhu.edu/~gazette/aprjun95/jun2695/26briefs.html |journal=Johns Hopkins Gazette |volume=24 |number=38 |date=June 26, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overlap in music formats===
A station may mix musical selections from both its old and new formats for a period of time. This smooth transition works best if the formats have little to no normal overlap in their playlists, such as a shift from [[country music]] to [[rhythmic contemporary]] or [[alternative rock]]; it may not be as effective or obvious if the transition is from, for example, [[modern rock]] to [[alternative rock]]. This type of stunting does not occur as often as other forms, as the approach does not increase the shock and anticipation value as much as with the other forms.

===Christmas music===
The popular practice of radio stations [[Christmas_music#Radio_broadcasting_of_Christmas_music|playing Christmas music]] during the lead-up to (and occasionally the week after) [[Christmas Day]] has also been used as a means of transitioning to a new format,  either following the conclusion of this programming, or in some cases, prematurely interrupting it instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.insideradio.com/free/tis-the-season-for-format-flips/article_4aee3230-cc0a-11e6-a0dc-ef30940bdbd1.html|title=‘Tis the Season for Format Flips.|work=Insideradio.com|access-date=2018-05-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar spirit to ironic "[[Christmas in July]]" promotions, such a stunt can also occur outside of the holiday season.

*As a [[soft launch]] in April 2008, [[Saskatoon]]'s new radio station [[CFWD-FM]] briefly stunted with Christmas music as ''Santa FM'', accompanied by a promotional campaign in which publicists in Santa costumes paraded through the city. The station defended the debut of its actual format, CHR ''Wired 96.3'', by joking that its staff would eventually grow tired of listening to "[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (song)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]". In November 2012, the station laid off its airstaff and switched to Christmas music again (this time, over the holiday season), emerging with a new variety hits format, ''Cruz FM'', on December 26, 2012.&lt;ref name="starphoenix-wired"&gt;{{cite news|title=Radio station takes down the tree|url=http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=ea2e5bed-7be4-46b7-8614-1d47379b94c9|accessdate=11 March 2016|work=Saskatoon Star-Phoenix|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320030155/http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=ea2e5bed-7be4-46b7-8614-1d47379b94c9|archivedate=20 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="saskatoon-jinglealltheway"&gt;{{cite news|title=New station jingles all the way|url=http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=2b3f4df6-2c4d-452c-848b-69cfed580c53|accessdate=11 March 2016|work=Saskatoon Star-Phoenix|publisher=Postmedia|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320024644/http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=2b3f4df6-2c4d-452c-848b-69cfed580c53|archivedate=20 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ri-cruz"&gt;{{cite web|title=96.3 Cruzes in Saskatoon|url=https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/80206/96-3-cruzes-in-saskatoon/|website=Radio Insight|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc-wireddone"&gt;{{cite web|title=Saskatoon radio station lays off staff|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/saskatoon-radio-station-lays-off-staff-1.1193957|website=CBC News|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In late-September 2015, [[Duluth]]'s [[WEBC]] dropped its [[sports radio]] format in favor of ''Ho Ho 106.5'', before emerging in early-October as [[classic rock]] ''Sasquatch 106.5''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/3855042-all-christmas-radio-moves-classic-rock|title=All-Christmas radio moves to classic rock|work=Duluth News-Tribune|access-date=2018-06-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/3851756-duluth-radio-station-switches-sports-christmas-music-%E2%80%94-now|title=Duluth radio station switches from sports to Christmas music...|work=Duluth News-Tribune|access-date=2018-06-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2015/10/02/duluth-radio-station-claims-permanent-switch-to-year-round-christmas-music/|title=Duluth Radio Station Claims Permanent Switch To Year-Round Christmas Music|work=CBS Minnesota|date=2015-10-02|access-date=2018-05-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In November 2017, [[CBS Radio]] and [[Entercom]] merged, bringing Seattle's two country music stations—[[KSWD (FM)|KMPS]] and [[KKWF]], under common ownership. On the day the merger was completed, KMPS switched to Christmas music, ostensibly for the holiday season. However, on the morning of December 4, 2017, KMPS abruptly ended the all-Christmas programming and flipped to [[soft adult contemporary]] as ''94.1 The Sound''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.insideradio.com/free/kmps-christmas-flip-fuels-talk-of-post-holiday-changes/article_0d51bc3c-ce41-11e7-8dbc-339949101329.html|title=KMPS Christmas Flip Fuels Talk Of Post-Holiday Changes.|work=Insideradio.com|access-date=2018-05-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/seattlenews/article/Seattle-radio-s-king-of-country-goes-soft-rock-12405420.php|title=Seattle radio’s king of country goes soft rock|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|access-date=2017-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Entercom's Detroit station [[WDZH]] flipped from CHR to the same format in a similar manner, spending three days as ''The Rudolph Network at 98.7'' before official launch of its new format, ''The Breeze''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crainsdetroit.com/media/987-swaps-pop-hits-soft-contemporary-breeze|title=98.7 swaps pop hits for soft contemporary as The Breeze|website=Crain's Detroit Business|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==On television==
Radio-like stunts on television are not as commonplace as they are on radio, usually due to iron-clad programming commitments, a general lack of concrete formats in television (especially among local television stations, which still mostly use a homogenized and [[dayparting|daypart]]-driven [[block programming]] strategy), and a lower level of shock value in a multichannel universe. 

Instead, a TV station or network may stunt in the form of a heavily-promoted event, as in the case of promoting new on-air branding, station affiliation change, or acquisition of programming or personnel; an increase in publicity (and with it, the station hopes, viewer anticipation) will increase as the changeover date nears. A prime example of this promo-type stunting involved [[United Kingdom|British]] [[cable television|cable channel]] [[Bravo (UK TV channel)|Bravo]], which in January 1997 used a series of eerily-produced promos to herald a change in programming tone (including mutations of the network's old and new visual presentations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/otherchannels/bravo.html |work=TVARK |title=Bravo |first=Hayden |last=Walker |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224123845/http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/otherchannels/bravo.html |archivedate=2007-02-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marathon (television)|Marathons]], the sequential broadcast of several episodes of the same series, are quite common during network transitions.

At least two networks have used stunting-type events prior to their formal launches. [[MLB Network]], for example, aired a continuous loop of baseball highlights and promos as a "soft launch" in the weeks before its formal debut on January 1, 2009, while [[Canada|Canada's]] [[Sun News Network]] employed an on-screen countdown clock graphic in the hours before its April 18, 2011 launch.&lt;ref name=GlobeAndMailLaunchDay&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Ladurantaye |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/television/sun-news-network-launches-with-anchor-posing-as-sunshine-girl/article1989501/ |title=Sun News Network launches with anchor as Sunshine Girl |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nick Jr. Too]], a sister to the British [[Nick Jr. (UK and Ireland)|Nick Jr.]] channel, has occasionally aired long-term marathons of ''[[Peppa Pig]]'', during which it has branded as "Nick Jr. Peppa".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wallop |first=Harry |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/relationships/10361996/Dad-of-four-a-family-united-by-Peppa-Pig.html |title=Dad of four: a family united by Peppa Pig |work=The Telegraph |date=2013-10-08 |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tangsa''', also '''Tase''' and '''Tase Naga''', is a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] languages or [[language cluster]] spoken by the [[Tangsa people]] of [[Burma]] and north-eastern [[India]]. Some varieties, such as Shangge, are likely distinct languages. There are about 60,000 speakers in Burma and 40,000 speakers in India.

==Geographical distribution==
Tangsa is spoken in the following locations of [[Myanmar]] (''[[Ethnologue]]'').

*[[Hkamti District]], [[Sagaing Division]]: [[Nanyun]], [[Pangsau]], [[Lahe, Burma|Lahe]], and [[Hkamti Township|Hkamti]] townships
*[[Myitkyina District]], [[Kachin State]]: Shinbwiyan and [[Tanai Township|Tanai]] townships

In India, Tangsa is spoken in [[Arunachal Pradesh]] and [[Assam]]. Below are locations for some varieties of Tangsa.

*'''Jugli''': Kantang, Longlung, and Rangran villages, central [[Tirap District]], Arunachal (Rekhung 1988)&lt;ref&gt;Rekhung, Winlang. 1988. ''Jugli Language Guide''. Itanagar: Directorate of Research, Government of Arunachal Pradesh.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Lungchang''': [[Changlang]], Rangkatu, and Kengkhu villages, eastern [[Tirap District]], Arunachal (Rekhung 1988)&lt;ref&gt;Rekhung, Winlang. 1988. ''Lungchang Language Guide''. Itanagar: Directorate of Research, Government of Arunachal Pradesh.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Tutsa''': Sabban area, Changlang Subdivision, western [[Changlang District]] (also in southeastern [[Tirap District]]), Arunachal (Rekhung 1992)&lt;ref&gt;Rekhung, Winlang. 1992. ''Tutsa Language Guide''. Itanagar: Directorate of Research, Government of Arunachal Pradesh.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Mungshang''': Nayang village, Miao area &amp; Theremkan village, Nampong circle, [[Changlang District]], Arunachal (Rekhung 1999)&lt;ref&gt;Rekhung, Winlang. 1999. ''Mungshang Language Guide''. Itanagar: Directorate of Research, Government of Arunachal Pradesh.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ethnologue'' also lists the following languages.
*'''Lao''' Naga (Law, Loh) ({{ethnolink|nlq|ISO 639 ''nlq''}}): 1,000 speakers (as of 2012) in [[Lahe, Burma|Lahe]] Township. Most similar to Chen-Kayu Naga and the Chuyo and Gakat dialects of Tase Naga.
*'''Chen-Kayu''' Naga (Kyan-Karyaw Naga) ({{ethnolink|nqq|ISO 639 ''nqq''}}): 9,000 speakers (as of 2012) in 13 villages of [[Lahe, Burma|Lahe]] Township. Dialects are Chen (Kyan) and Kayu (Kahyu, Kaiyaw, Karyaw, Kayaw). Most similar to the Chuyo and Gakat dialects of Tase Naga.

In [[agriculture]], a '''terrace''' is a piece of sloped plane that has been cut into a series of successively receding flat surfaces or platforms, which resemble steps, for the purposes of more effective farming. This type of landscaping is therefore called '''terracing'''. Graduated terrace steps are commonly used to farm on hilly or mountainous terrain. Terraced fields decrease both [[erosion]] and [[surface runoff]], and may be used to support growing crops that require [[irrigation]], such as [[rice]]. The [[Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras]] have been designated as a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] because of the significance of this technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= World Heritage List | url= http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/722 | work=UNESCO | accessdate=2012-09-22}}they are Broad flat steps&lt;/ref&gt;

Terraced [[paddy field]]s are used widely in [[rice]], [[wheat]] and [[barley]] farming in [[East Asia|east]], [[South Asia|south]], and [[southeast Asia]], as well as the Mediterranean, Africa, and South America. Drier-climate terrace farming is common throughout the [[Mediterranean Basin]], where they are used for vineyards, olive trees, cork oak, etc.

In the South American [[Andes]], farmers have used terraces, known as ''[[anden]]es,'' for over a thousand years to farm [[potato]]es, [[maize]], and other native crops. Terraced farming was developed by the [[Wari culture]] and other peoples of the south-central Andes before 1000 AD, centuries before they were used by the [[Inca civilization|Inca]], who adopted them. The terraces were built to make the most efficient use of shallow soil and to enable [[irrigation]] of crops by allowing runoff to occur through the outlet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/terrace-cultivation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Inca built on these, developing a system of [[canal]]s, [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]], and [[puquios]] to direct water through dry land and increase fertility levels and growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Farming Like the Incas | url= http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/farming-like-the-incas-70263217/?no-ist | work=Smithsonian Magazine | accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; These terraced farms are found wherever mountain villages have existed in the Andes. They provided the food necessary to support the populations of great Inca cities and religious centres such as [[Machu Picchu]].

[[Terrace (gardening)|Terracing]] is also used for sloping terrain; the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]] may have been built on an artificial mountain with stepped terraces, such as those on a [[ziggurat]].{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} At the seaside [[Villa of the Papyri]] in [[Herculaneum]], the villa gardens of [[Julius Caesar]]'s father-in-law were designed in terraces to give pleasant and varied views of the Bay of Naples.

Terraced fields are common in islands with steep slopes. The [[Canary Islands]] present a complex system of terraces covering the landscape from the coastal irrigated plantations to the dry fields in the highlands. These terraces, which are named ''cadenas'' (chains), are built with stone walls of skillful design, which include attached stairs and channels.&lt;ref&gt;Martín, Lidia &amp; González Morales, A &amp; Ojeda, Antonio A.. (2016). Towards a new valuation of cultural terraced landscapes: The heritage of terraces in the Canary Islands (Spain). 26. 499-512. 10.19233/ASHS.2016.31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Old English]], a terrace was also called a "lynch" ([[lynchet]]). An example of an ancient Lynch Mill is in [[Lyme Regis]]. The water is directed from a river by a duct along a terrace. This set-up was used in steep hilly areas in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whittington|first=G.|date=1967-01-01|title=Towards a Terminology for Strip Lynchets|jstor=40273237|journal=The Agricultural History Review|volume=15|issue=2|pages=103–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]], some of the ''100 Selected Terraced Rice Fields'' (in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: [[:ja:棚田#日本の棚田百選一覧|日本の棚田百選一覧]]), from [[Iwate, Japan|Iwate]] in the north to [[Kagoshima, Japan|Kagoshima]] in the south, are slowly disappearing, but volunteers are helping the farmers for keeping their tradition and/or for the sightseeing purpose. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nippon.com/en/images/i00027/ An Agricultural Wonder: Japan’s Vanishing Terraced Rice Fields (Photos)] (Nippon.com) &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tharu''' ([[Tharu people|Tharu]]: थारु, {{lang-hi|थरुवा}}) or '''Tharuhat''' ({{lang-ne|थरुहट}}) languages are any of the [[Indo-Aryan languages]] spoken by the [[Tharu people]] of the [[Terai]] region in Nepal, and neighboring regions of [[Uttarakhand]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Bihar]] in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Tables_Published/SCST/dh_st_uttaranchal.pdf | author = Office of the Registrar General, India (2001) | title = Uttaranchal.

Data Highlights: The Scheduled Tribes. Census of India 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although their own precise classification within Indo-Aryan remains uncertain, Tharu languages have superficial similarities with neighbouring languages such as [[Awadhi]], [[Maithili language|Maithili]], and [[Bhojpuri language|Bhojpuri]]. Moreover, the lexicon of certain Tharu households is indicative of an archaic, 'indigenous' substratum, potentially predating both [[Tibeto-Burman and Tai peoples of Assam|Sino-Tibetan]] or [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] settlement. Moreover, Tharu languages appear to be transitional within the context of Indo-Aryan. &lt;ref&gt;The Indo-Aryans of Ancient South Asia: Language, Material Culture and Ethnicity&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chitwania Tharu''' is spoken by approximately 250,000 speakers east of the [[Gandaki River]], in and around the [[Chitwan Valley]]. Chitwania, as a whole, has superficial similarities with Awadhi. Nevertheless, certain Chitwania variants appear to have considerable lexical similarities with [[Manchad language|Manchad]], a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] language.&lt;ref&gt;George van Driem, 2007, "Endangered languages of South Asia", in Matthias Brenzinger, Mouton de Gruyter&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dangaura''', '''Rana''', and '''Buksa''' refer to a triumvirate of mutually-intelligible Tharu variants spoken west of the [[Gandaki River]], spoken by approximately 1.3 million people. Furthermore, an additional variant of Tharu, known as '''Sonha''', is largely mutually intelligible with Dangauru.

'''[[Kochila Tharu|Kochila]]''', a diverse Tharu variant, is also spoken by approximately 250,000 people, in regions of eastern Nepal. Many ethnic Kochila have adopted [[Maithili language|Maithili]].

{{refimprove|date=September 2014}}

"'''The King is dead, long live the King!'''"&lt;ref&gt;The exact punctuation used when written varies from source to source, with the [[full stop]] on occasion being replaced by a [[semicolon]], a [[colon (punctuation)|colon]], or a [[dash]].&lt;/ref&gt;, or simply "'''Long live the King!'''", is a traditional proclamation made following the [[coronation|accession]] of a new [[monarch]] in various countries. The seemingly contradictory phrase is used to simultaneously announce the death of the previous monarch and assure the public of continuity by saluting the new monarch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=King Solomon: The Temptations of Money, Sex, and Power | author=Ryken, Philip Graham | year=2011 | publisher=Crossway | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vY8v8-bxyTIC | isbn=978-1-4335-2154-6 | page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, this phrase has become a popular [[phrasal template]]. Given the memorable nature of the phrase (owing to [[epanalepsis]]), as well as its historic significance, the phrase crops up regularly as a headline for articles, editorials, or advertisements on themes of succession or replacement. [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Robert Cecil]], one of the architects of the [[League of Nations]], famously concluded his speech at the final session of the League of Nations with the phrase: "The League is dead. Long live the [[United Nations]]."&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book |last = Scott |first = George |year = 1973 |title = The Rise and Fall of the League of Nations |publisher = Hutchinson &amp; Co LTD |isbn = 0-09-117040-0 |ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Platypus Affiliated, a campus-based educational organization centered on Marxism, uses the slogan "The Left is dead! Long live the Left!" &lt;ref&gt; {{cite website | title = Platypus Affiliated Society | ref = harv | url = "www.platypus1917.org"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
The original phrase was translated from the [[french language|French]] {{lang|fr|Le roi est mort, vive le roi!}}, which was first declared upon the accession to the French throne of [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] after the death of his father [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]] in 1422. In [[France]], the declaration was traditionally made by the [[Viscounts and Dukes of Uzès|duc d'Uzès]], a senior [[Peerage of France|peer of France]], as soon as the coffin containing the remains of the previous king descended into the vault of [[Saint Denis Basilica]]. The phrase arose from the law of {{lang|fr|le mort saisit le vif}}&amp;mdash;that the transfer of sovereignty occurs instantaneously upon the moment of death of the previous monarch.  "The King is dead" is the announcement of a monarch who has just died.  "Long live The King!" refers to the heir who immediately succeeds to a throne upon the death of the preceding monarch.

At the time, French was the primary language of the nobility in [[Kingdom of England|England]], and the proclamation was quickly taken up as ideally representing the same tradition&amp;mdash;which in England dates back to 1272, when [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] died while his son, [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], was fighting in the [[Crusades]]. To avoid any chance of a [[civil war]] erupting over the [[order of succession]], the [[Royal Council]] proclaimed: "The throne shall never be empty; the country shall never be without a monarch." Thus, Edward was declared king immediately, and he reigned ''[[wikt:in absentia|in absentia]]'' until news of his father's death reached him and he returned to England.  Another example is among the French royalty. In France, [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] was the predecessor of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]].  Upon Louis XV's death at around 11:00&amp;nbsp;pm on 10 May 1774, [[heir-apparent]] Louis-Auguste, [[Dauphin of France|le Dauphin]], immediately became King Louis XVI of France.  This quick transition of sovereignty was made within the phrase "The King is dead, long live The King!"

== Usage ==
In Denmark, the prime minister makes a similar proclamation upon the death of a monarch—''Kongen leve, kongen er død'' (hail the king, the king is dead)—from the balcony of [[Christiansborg Palace]] (the Danish Parliament building).&lt;ref&gt;[http://denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Samfund/Kongehuset_og_hoffet/kongen_leve_kongen_er_d%C3%B8d Kongen leve, kongen er død]. Den Store Danske.&lt;/ref&gt; This declaration is official and marks the ascension of a new monarch immediately after the death of the old. This is due to the fact that [[Frederick III of Denmark|Frederick III]] abolished the coronation ceremony with the introduction of the hereditary and absolute monarchy in 1660. The king was now supreme and accountable only to God, so the crown became a birthright, and not something to be bestowed only after the father's death with the nobles and the church's approval. With the introduction of constitutional monarchy in 1849, the monarch's power over the State was again limited, but his claim to the throne remained undisputed and absolute.

In some monarchies, such as the United Kingdom, an [[interregnum]] is usually avoided by using the idea of immediate transferral of power behind the phrase (i.e., the [[heir to the throne]] becomes a new monarch immediately on his predecessor's death). This famous phrase signifies the continuity of [[sovereignty]], attached to a personal form of power named ''[[Auctoritas]]''. This is not so in other monarchies where the new monarch's reign begins only with [[coronation]] or some other formal or traditional event. In the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] for instance, kings were elected, which often led to relatively long interregna. During that time it was the Polish [[Primate (bishop)|primate]] who served as an [[interrex]] (ruler between kings). [[Ernst Kantorowicz]]'s famous theory of ''the king's two bodies'' (1957) showed how ''auctoritas'' (Kantorowicz used the synonym term—here—of ''dignitas'') was transferred from the defunct sovereign to the new one.

In the United Kingdom and other realms which permit female succession to the throne, the phrase can be altered to accommodate succession between monarchs of different sexes, e.g. "The King is dead, long live The Queen!", as happened in 1952, when [[George VI|King George VI]] died and was succeeded by his daughter, [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], or "The Queen is dead, long live The King!" as happened in 1901, when [[Queen Victoria]] was succeeded by her son, [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=February 6, 1952 Toronto Telegram |url=http://papertrail.candutch.ca/shopping/pgm-more_information.php?id=416 |website=Paper Trail |accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The King is dead, long live The King!" was last properly used in the United Kingdom in January 1936 when [[George V|King George V]] was succeeded by his son [[Edward VIII|King Edward VIII]], who later [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdicated]],{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} or "The Queen is dead, long live The Queen!" as happened in 1558, when [[Queen Mary I]] was succeeded by her half-sister, [[Queen Elizabeth I]].

In the Kingdom of [[Thailand]], to conclude the national televised address on October 13, 2016 regarding the passing of His Majesty [[King Bhumibol Adulyadej]], the Prime Minister proclaimed "His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej, Rama IX, has passed away. Long live His Majesty the new King."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thaigov.go.th/index.php/en/government-en1/item/108035-id Statement by Prime Minister General Prayut Chan-o-cha after the announcement of Royal Household Bureau]. Royal Thai Government.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|a type of wine|the horticultural term|cultivar}}
[[File:Cuvee.jpg|thumb|A varietal Californian wine, a [[Zinfandel]].]]

A '''varietal wine''' is a [[wine]] made primarily from a single named [[grape]] [[Variety (biology)|variety]], and which typically displays the name of that variety on the [[wine label]].&lt;ref&gt;The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OCW-varietal&gt;winepros.com.au. {{Cite web|last= ''Oxford Companion to Wine''| title= varietal |url= http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=3370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of grape varieties commonly used in varietal wines are [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Chardonnay]] and [[Merlot]]. Wines that display the name of two or more varieties on their label, such as a Chardonnay-[[Viognier]], are blends and not varietal wines. The term is frequently misused in place of [[vine]] variety; the term variety refers to the vine or grape while varietal refers to the wine produced by a variety.&lt;ref name=OCW-varietal/&gt;

As [[vintner]]s and consumers have become aware of the characteristics of individual varieties of wine grapes, wines have also come to be identified by varietal names.

The term was popularized in the US by Maynard Amerine at the [[University of California, Davis]] after [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] seeking to encourage growers to choose optimal vine varieties, and later promoted by [[Frank Schoonmaker]] in the 1950s and 1960s, ultimately becoming widespread during the California wine boom of the 1970s.&lt;ref name=OCW-varietal/&gt; Varietal wines are commonly associated with [[New World wine]]s in general, but there is also a long-standing tradition of varietal labelling in [[German wine|Germany]] and other German-influenced wine regions including [[Austrian wine|Austria]], [[Alsace wine|Alsace]], and the [[Czech wine|Czech Republic]].

==Marketing relevance==

The alternatives to the marketing differentiation of wines by grape variety are branded wine, such as Hearty Burgundy, or geographical [[appellation]]s, such as [[Champagne (wine region)|Champagne]] or [[Bordeaux wine|Bordeaux]]. The poor quality and unknown provenance of many branded wines and the multitude of potentially confusing appellations leaves varietal labeling as perhaps the most popular for quality wines in many markets.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} This is much less the case in places where [[appellations]] have a long and strong tradition, as for instance [[Appellation d'origine contrôlée|in France]]. In the past, the grape variety was very uncommonly mentioned on the labels of French [[wine bottle]]s, and was forbidden for almost all [[Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée|AOC]] wines. New World varietal wines from newcomers like [[Australian wine|Australia]] and [[Chilean wine|Chile]] have made a significant dent in traditional French export markets like the [[United Kingdom|UK]], and so the French are adopting varietal labeling in some cases, particularly for [[vin de pays]]. Also, in its own way, [[Chardonnay]] is now a powerful [[brand]].

==Australia==
{{main|Australian wine}}
Australia has virtually completed a three decade long transition from labelling by style, e.g. "claret", "burgundy", "hock", "chablis" to a varietal system.  While this has been done in response to pressure from the EU, particularly France, it has paved the way for growing interest among Australian consumers for so called alternative varietals, such as [[Pinot gris|Pinot grigio / (Pinot gris)]], [[Sangiovese]] and [[Tempranillo]].

==Europe==
[[File:French corbieres Guy Chevalier wine with varietal labelling.jpg|thumb|right|220px|French estate bottled wine from the [[Corbières AOC]] in the [[Languedoc-Roussillon]] that features the grape variety [[Grenache noir]] on the label. Unique for French wines]]

Within the [[European Union]], a wine using a varietal label must contain at least 85% of that variety.&lt;ref name="UK FSA"&gt;http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/euwineregs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 85% is a common minimum standard; national regulations may set the limit higher in certain cases, but not lower.

===France===
{{main|French wine}}
In most regions of France, [[terroir]] is thought to surpass the impact of variety, so almost all French wines traditionally have no variety listed at all, and would in many cases not be allowed for AOC wines. [[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]], for instance, is typically a blend of [[Chardonnay]], [[Pinot noir]] and [[Pinot Meunier]], but this is not indicated anywhere on the label. In Alsace, [[winemaker]]s adopt the [[German wine|German]] custom of varietal labeling.

In recent years, varietal labels have become more common for French wines. Most of these wines are Vin de pays rather than AOC wines, but varietal names are also seen on some regional AOCs.

==United States==
{{main|American wine}}
In the United States, the [[Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau]] regulations specify a minimum variety content of 75% of the labeled grape, for ''[[Vitis vinifera]]'' wines, and 51% for ''[[Vitis labrusca]]'' wines.&lt;ref name=OCW-varietal/&gt; There is no restriction on the identity of the balance. Many states in the United States require specific compositions to qualify for sale under a particular varietal labels. For example, in [[Oregon wine|Oregon]], wines subject to its regulation must be identified by the grape variety from which it was made, and certain varietals must contain at least 95% of that variety, although the new "Southern Oregon" sub-[[American Viticultural Area|AVA]] allows for the minimum 75% figure.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

'''ǂKxʼao-ǁʼae'''{{pronunciation?}} (ǂKxʼauǁʼein{{pronunciation?}}, Auen, Kaukau) is a southeastern variety of the [[ǃKung language|!Xuun]] [[dialect continuum]], spoken in [[Botswana]] (the settlements of [[Groote Laagte]], [[East Hanahai]], Kanagas and [[Ghanzi]] in [[Ghanzi District]] and on the commercial farms) and in [[Namibia]] (the city of [[Gobabis]] and settlements along the C22 road to [[Otjinene]] as far as [[Eiseb]], [[Omaheke Region]]) by about 7,000 people. In Botswana, most speakers are bilingual in [[Naro language|Naro]] or [[Tswana language|Tswana]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

There are numerous spellings of the name, including ''ǁAuǁei, ǁX’auǁ’e,'' and ''Auen''. Endonyms are ''Juǀʼhoan, ǃXuun ''in Namibia and ''ǂKx'ao||'ae'' (predominantly in Botswana) meaning "northern people" in Naro. It also goes by the names ''Gobabis ǃKung'' and ''Kaukau ''(which can take the noun class prefixes in [[Tswana language|Tswana]] to give ''Mokaukau ''for one person, ''Bakaukau'' for the group and ''Sekaukau'' for the language).

In Namibia, ǂKx'ao||'ae'' ''tends to refer literally to the !Xuun speakers to the north in the [[Caprivi Strip|Caprivi area]]. With the exception of a few cultural traits, speakers of ǂKx'ao||'ae'' ''in Botswana and those of Ju|'hoan in Namibia argue that they are one and the same people, speaking one language, with some dialectal attributes.

The non-Latin characters used by the language predominantly refer to [[click consonants]] and follow the orthography by Patrick Dickens for [[Juǀ'hoan dialect|Juǀ'hoan]].

The limited data on these dialects is poorly transcribed, but as of 2015 fieldwork is in progress.
